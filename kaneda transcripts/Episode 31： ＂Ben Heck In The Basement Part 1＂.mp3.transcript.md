[00:00] I'm sure you knew

[00:03] When I fit off

[00:06] More than I could chew

[00:09] But through it all

[00:12] When there was doubt

[00:15] I ate it up

[00:18] And spit it out

[00:21] I faced it all

[00:25] And I used to tell

[00:28] And it in my way

[00:33] Welcome to Episode 31 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:38] I'm losing track with all the different special editions and other episodes that we've been doing as well.

[00:43] I want to thank everyone

[00:46] We have a great episode today

[00:49] Interviewed Ben Heck Wednesday night

[00:52] After a happy hour with the show

[00:56] So if Canada is a little bit buzzed during the interview

[00:59] Cut him some slack

[01:01] It was a hard work week

[01:03] And we were letting off some steam

[01:06] But before he gets to that interview

[01:08] And we're going to break it up into two parts again

[01:11] Because I do think it's better that way

[01:13] Instead of listening to like an hour and a half of straight Canada Ben Talk

[01:17] It's better to split it up

[01:19] Before I get that I want to just address real quickly

[01:21] What's been going on in the forum

[01:23] And I know that we've been moved to the basement

[01:26] And that the last podcast I went up

[01:29] Sort of ruffled some feathers and caused quite a commotion

[01:32] And here's what I want to say about that matter

[01:34] And then I want to get on to the interview

[01:36] Because I don't want to belabor this point

[01:38] I've always said on this podcast

[01:40] We want to talk about topics that I think are interesting

[01:42] And I think that the community should hear

[01:45] And I don't think that dialogue and conversation around pinball should be censored very often

[01:50] At all

[01:51] And it's a little bit of a shame to see how some people react

[01:56] When you bring up things that are out in the open

[01:59] I'm not putting words in people's mouths

[02:01] I'm not slandering individuals

[02:04] I'm simply stating what people are saying about the hobby and about the community

[02:08] And I'll say this

[02:11] It's still to this day boggles my mind

[02:14] That grown men, grown men

[02:17] Hear something being said about pinball or about the hobby

[02:21] And they run to the moderators and complain about it on a daily basis

[02:25] I really don't understand that

[02:28] Aren't we all the adults? Can't we have a conversation about pinball

[02:31] Without running to the moderators

[02:33] And there's a lot of people, it's not many

[02:35] But there are some that really aren't a mission

[02:38] To censor what you can hear

[02:40] To censor the conversation around pinball

[02:42] And you see those individuals

[02:43] They actually take credit for getting individuals banned

[02:47] For getting people threat ejected

[02:49] For getting threats moved

[02:50] For getting threats deleted

[02:51] And these individuals, as much as they oftentimes congratulate themselves on doing it

[02:58] They're the first ones whenever people respond

[03:01] And are like, well why did you do that? Like why can't you have a conversation?

[03:04] Like why did you really complain?

[03:06] They're always like, I didn't do anything

[03:07] I'm just kidding, I'm joking

[03:09] But they're not kidding

[03:10] Actually these people send paragraph emails to the moderators on daily basis

[03:16] Complaining about the conversations we're having on this podcast

[03:20] And the conversations that people want to have on pinside

[03:23] So I hope cooler heads prevail

[03:25] I hope that people can realize that we're just talking about pinball

[03:28] We're talking about personalities in the pinball hobby

[03:31] And everything can be hashed out and discussed like grown adults

[03:36] Without crying about it

[03:38] And I still don't understand when people do that

[03:40] But anyway, this podcast is not going away

[03:42] We're not going to eliminate the way we approach this podcast

[03:46] I do admit that maybe having a person's name in the thread

[03:50] Might look like a personal insult or attack against that person

[03:54] But again, if you listen to the podcast

[03:56] It is simply me just saying what that person is saying

[03:59] And if you want someone to call pinside douche side

[04:04] And make fun of the hobby

[04:06] And call people in it backstabbers and snakes

[04:09] And all sorts of names

[04:11] And you want to protect that individual

[04:14] That's your prerogative

[04:15] But I'm not going to protect people like that

[04:17] I actually will call them out when that happens

[04:19] So without further ado though, let's turn a page

[04:22] It's a beautiful day

[04:23] Let's get to the Benhek interview

[04:25] I hope you enjoy it

[04:26] Ben does talk a lot about AMH and its ghost

[04:29] And I tried to move on as fast as I could

[04:31] But I wanted Ben to be able to talk about his machine

[04:33] And what he loves about it

[04:35] And I think you're really going to enjoy this two-part series of

[04:37] Canada's pinball podcast

[04:39] Without further ado, let's get to the interview

[04:41] All right, well ladies and gentlemen

[04:43] Coming from the pinside basement now officially

[04:47] Canada would love to introduce Benhek back for the second time

[04:52] To Canada's pinball podcast

[04:54] Ben, welcome back to the show

[04:56] I'm back, so this is in the basement

[04:58] It's in the basement

[04:59] Where nobody goes

[05:01] Yeah, it's like when you're at a convention and they stick you in the back hall

[05:05] Next to like the cough drop display or something

[05:09] Dude, it's terrible

[05:10] We're like the wedding table

[05:12] That's like the work obligation invite table

[05:16] That's like there's like a raptor blocking our view from the bride and groom's table

[05:21] Like nobody wants to be in the basement

[05:23] But we're here, and it's going to be great

[05:25] Yeah, of course, as you just said that I was picturing weddings up into it

[05:31] I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, I guess I have been on that table before

[05:35] Man, I'm there at the time

[05:36] As a disabled segregation

[05:38] Right

[05:39] So Ben, tonight we want to talk about game design

[05:44] Right, so we want to go down a list of like games that people have been saying

[05:50] They want to have made into pinball machines

[05:53] And we're going to discuss those themes and how viable we think those themes are to a pinball machine

[05:59] Yeah, and even I even made a list and sorted it via Excel

[06:03] So I did a keyword search on pinside

[06:05] Because I have noticed that some time

[06:07] I'm like, how often do people actually talk about X title and the results may surprise you?

[06:12] Right

[06:13] Yeah, so like let's just jump into it

[06:16] Well, I think we should also talk about things I like to do with game design

[06:20] Last time I was on here we kind of talked about a lot of things

[06:23] But I thought it'd be kind of cool if we just talked about like, you know, like

[06:26] When I made America's most haunted like why I did it

[06:29] And that does tie into why a theme may work or why it may not work

[06:33] So that's a lot of things that people want as themes that might not fit pinball

[06:37] All right, so let's start there

[06:39] Tell us, Ben

[06:41] Yes

[06:42] Game design, how did you approach it?

[06:45] With America's most haunted?

[06:47] Yeah, I mean what other game have you designed? That's the game

[06:50] Phil Paxon pinball

[06:52] Oh come on, Bill Paxon pinball

[06:54] Just came up from it

[06:55] Yeah, but see

[06:56] Well with America's most haunted I wanted to have like

[06:59] I wanted to be very story-driven

[07:01] You know, like you felt like you were in the story

[07:04] And you know, it's an original theme so you have to actually

[07:07] You have to set up the humor and the characters

[07:09] I think a lot of people don't realize that

[07:11] Obviously that's a value of a license

[07:13] But if it's something new, you have to say

[07:16] Okay, well this character is like a

[07:18] Valley girl, this character is a hippie

[07:20] So then I'm like, okay, well which ghost would conflict the most with a hippie or a Valley girl

[07:25] And I would kind of combine the characters in a way that would kind of be funny

[07:28] Or like if we have the tech guy who's always getting you know put down

[07:31] We hook him up with the ghost horror, you know, and she's like spooning him

[07:35] So I really wanted to have like you know interesting characters

[07:38] I mean there's stereotypes but you know they're kind of fun

[07:41] And you know kind of use that to drive the story

[07:44] That way as you're making the shots you're learning the backstory of the game

[07:48] And then the game design kind of

[07:50] Derived from that

[07:52] And if I ever did another game I would actually

[07:54] Almost make the rules first

[07:56] And then design the table based off the rules

[07:58] Because rules are what someone once said

[08:00] I can't remember who said this it was some pinball person

[08:03] It's like you fuck a game for the theme but you marry it for the rules

[08:07] And I've taken that to heart

[08:09] Right

[08:10] So Ben, you did a story first before the layout

[08:16] Like talk to me about like what was the first?

[08:18] No not with America's most haunted

[08:20] America's most haunted it was

[08:22] Well I was like okay this is a ghost hunting game

[08:25] And my reason for doing it quite honestly was there were two main reasons

[08:29] One I wanted to do an original theme so we could sell it

[08:32] This is back before we could afford a license or anything

[08:34] Or this before a spooky was even a company

[08:36] Because remember I started making America's most haunted as a side project on my own

[08:41] And then it's like well I guess we'll make this into a game now

[08:44] Which kind of stuck because a lot of things I had done were not really appropriate for a mass produced game

[08:49] So we had to fix a lot of things

[08:51] Like what?

[08:52] Like what?

[08:53] I mean come on

[08:54] You're gonna drop a bomb like that with $1

[08:56] I'll tell you I'll like the rails

[09:00] Like when the ball go around

[09:02] So what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to have layers of plastic or metal

[09:06] And the ball hits those and you know it curves

[09:08] But I was designing it using I think I was using wood or plastic

[09:12] Which would have been fine for a homebrew game but it wouldn't stand up

[09:15] You know in any sort of like you know repetitive environment

[09:18] So Chuck had to go in and rejol out of the stuff

[09:21] And instead of plastic we had to turn it into metal

[09:24] But then the metal if you have like I don't know

[09:26] 063 or 050 steel

[09:28] It's thinner than the plastics

[09:30] So that changed the heights of the rings

[09:32] And I used all these stupid spacers like these half inch aluminum threaded spacers

[09:36] Which cost a effing fortune by the way

[09:38] Instead of posts

[09:40] And so that makes the game harder to assemble

[09:43] And it also makes it cost a little bit more

[09:45] And Chuck fixed a lot of that with the Rob Zombie

[09:47] Because Chuck's you know he's been in a pinball a lot longer than I have

[09:50] So he knows he has a better idea of how games are built

[09:53] Because I've never even like rebuilt a play field or shopped out a game

[09:56] I'm so lazy I have other people

[09:57] So you're like the last man you should be designing a pinball play field but go on

[10:01] Right right oh no I would love to work with someone

[10:05] Like I would love to do like the rules and the theme and blah blah blah

[10:08] Then when I'll see what's better do the table

[10:11] Although I think I'm okay at it

[10:12] Anyway so we had to go back and basically re-engineer a lot of things

[10:16] Like I had 3D printed an entire custom 3 bank drop target thing

[10:21] And then it's like oh Terry can get the AFM slider

[10:25] Which is also used on Tron and Spider-Man and a bunch of other games

[10:28] But we only have to make the motor Mac so you know a lot of stuff that I've done

[10:33] You know we were able to do with more custom parts

[10:36] Or I'm sorry more standard parts

[10:38] So Chuck had to spend a lot of time bless us hard going back and making those things production ready

[10:45] But again that's because the game didn't really start off from a production standpoint

[10:48] So I wanted to make ghosts because I would see things like Waz

[10:53] And I would troll Pinside all the time you know always

[10:56] And it's always like I gotta have a game the wife likes

[10:59] The wife has to like the wife the wife the wife

[11:01] And I'm like well you know women like ghost shows and that kind of crap

[11:05] And I'm like maybe this would be kind of like a good gateway pin

[11:09] I don't know if that entirely worked

[11:11] But that was part of my reason for picking that theme

[11:13] Because I wanted something that was you know that you know women might enjoy

[11:18] Because you know they tend to like a lot of them like supernatural stuff

[11:22] Or they like the shows or the ghosts or the killers or whatnot

[11:26] Like macabre stuff sometimes it seems

[11:29] So that was one approach and then also I was like okay

[11:32] Original theme because we can sell it

[11:35] And then I'd also done on the Ben Hex show I think it was Halloween 2011

[11:40] We did a spoof of a ghost hunting show

[11:43] And corporate hated it

[11:45] And it didn't get very many good views

[11:47] Because if you do a show that people expect you to do one thing like solder

[11:51] Or review bad video games

[11:53] And if you do anything else they'll crucify you

[11:55] You probably know how that works

[11:57] Sure everyone in my app is my podcast is like that

[12:00] Right

[12:02] But I was like well you know what it was really really fun

[12:05] It was still my most favorite episode of my show to make after like 240 episodes

[12:09] And I'm like that was really fun

[12:11] Maybe this would be a good theme like a generic spoof

[12:13] Making fun of all these ridiculous ghost hunting shows on television

[12:17] Because it's like every other show on cable now

[12:20] I mean that whole industry is going to collapse once cable collapses

[12:23] So you know I guess if you've got a ghost show better get it done quick

[12:26] Yeah so then I was like okay ghosts

[12:28] And I wanted to think about like what the archetypes of the ghosts were

[12:32] So I was like okay it was all driven by location like okay

[12:36] So where are these people going to be looking for ghosts

[12:39] And so I thought like what are the most kind of a stereotypical haunted places

[12:43] And that's why you have the six ghosts the six ghosts they weren't derived by the characters

[12:48] They were derived by their location

[12:50] So it's like okay you have a hospital like my a cousin of mine like swears

[12:54] Swear is in the Bible that the fourth floor of the hospital she works out like nobody wants to go up there at night because it's haunted right

[13:00] You know we've all heard ghost stories whether or not we believe them a lot of people do

[13:04] And you can draw a lot of inspiration for that so we had a hospital

[13:08] Theater hotel like in any place it's for whatever reason

[13:12] That people think these places are haunted or claim their haunted it's usually places with a lot of like humanity going through it

[13:18] So you know again hospital hotel theater bar and war fort because you know getty spurred you know people like oh there's ghosts everywhere

[13:26] So I'm like okay so I have these six locations you know six is like the magic number for modes and pinball

[13:32] So who are the ghosts?

[13:34] And originally they were a little different like two of the ghosts I don't know how familiar you are with the game

[13:39] I mean no one's that familiar and there's only 150 I mean he's all like I've seen this thing in every arcade

[13:45] So not very familiar but go out

[13:47] Yes so Hilton was over at my shop this afternoon and you know wise snow on pizza

[13:52] Yeah we all know who he is

[13:54] Okay and we you know we were working on the tilt you know to make the tilt better for the next one

[14:00] And then he was like asking me he's like okay so how do you qualify these modes I'm like you own two of these games and you don't know

[14:06] Well one's new in box he has an open it as he's like a snow multiple times

[14:10] Yes it's definitely there I've seen it so I guess

[14:14] What does he like sleep on top of it like what's the deal with that machine is he gonna sell it?

[14:18] Well he has a lot of games so maybe he just doesn't have room to set everything up like he was he's gonna pick up a ghost bus this week

[14:25] And he's got a new location does a new bar near here which was pretty cool I didn't know about it

[14:30] So I bought some like super before we go and like what do you think about?

[14:34] Okay so the the the re so the re-save of America's most haunted like it's again like I mean you've designed a game that is now like almost double the price of what it was originally

[14:49] I mean are you happy you must be happy I think it's double it's like I think it's sold for nothing

[14:54] I think it's sold for nine grand new box yeah but there's someone on the inside right now they got one for 60 at 100

[15:00] Which I'm sure will be gone is probably already gone is it new box was just homie's only no it's not homie's only I mean I like I

[15:06] I would rather buy a homie's only because at the end of day once you open that box up your homie's only like well yeah it's like 30 seconds

[15:15] Well yeah it's like it's like buying a new car you drive it off the lot and it's like setting $5,000 on fire you know it's just life

[15:21] Right but you know that minty like I got a ghostbusters premium on order it'll be my first nib a pinball machine

[15:27] Just because it's almost like I mean I'm really stingy and I actually am like an anti-horter

[15:33] I love getting rid of stuff right I was I was telling Felix that today I was like I'm like it's it's like you know how you have a zip file

[15:40] It's like compression you can take you can take up this thing that requires like 12 square feet or whatever it would be in your house

[15:46] And you can compress it down to a small little envelope full of money I love that I definitely want to talk to you about why you ordered a ghostbusters premium

[15:55] But let's get through the AMH because we're right we're in the middle this so continue

[16:01] All right so let me just back up so regarding the price increase on AMH I think it's really cool I guess that's you know by having it be limited

[16:09] We gave people the potential for for to appreciate and value and that helped itself and actually Hilton was a big proponent of limiting the number to like a magic speed bump

[16:19] He's a marketing genius. Yeah he really is and it took actually it took a long time for us to convince Chuck of that

[16:24] Like we're both like yeah I like what was Chuck thinking like they're not selling yeah I don't know I mean I can't really you know speak to what he was thinking

[16:32] But in the end you know I think we probably could have gone a little higher in quantity and by that you know I'm just selfishly thinking of like you know the new car

[16:40] Like I've got my driver for that but you know whatever forget the quantity I mean go hire him price I've said this to you before Ben I'm like you sell out rob zombie and like one day at like 6 grand it's like

[16:52] Yeah I'm gonna sold it for 8 grand and I'm on the same I'm the same token I saw a video on YouTube about this Nintendo could sell a Mibo is for $50

[17:01] And they would do really well for a while but they would probably burn out the demand a lot faster if they raise the price to actually meet the demand. Yeah but Nintendo is selling 100 to 1000 units you're selling 300 like it's over

[17:16] Well if I do another game I would basically demand that it had a price increase which I mean yeah you guys like honestly Chuck left the money in the table but it's alright because you know what I think it works to your benefit

[17:28] That spooky pinball machines have a higher resale in the secondary market than they do new in box that is an am right and here's that's something you guys would like the Ferrari of pinball only Ferrari sell for more than they do MSRP.

[17:43] Well that's one thing I'd like to address everyone talks about how pinball should not be an investment and I agree it's not investment but the fact that you can sell a game for almost what you paid for it if not make a little money

[17:56] That is a major contributor to why it's so popular I mean it's the same reason why foreign cars kicked the shit out of American cars in the past because they had a higher resell value like oh I can drive this Honda Core for ten years.

[18:11] And actually you know I'm going to get a lot more money when I go to sell it than I will out of this like Dodge Neon and perceived resell value or why not perceived real resell value is a major driver in pin so I mean if you think about it like if you

[18:25] If you can afford one pinball machine, you can afford every pinball machine because

[18:31] you can just sell it and get another one.

[18:32] Sell it and get another one.

[18:34] I sold my attack from Mars mostly because I know the price is going to come down.

[18:38] I don't know for sure that's the next remake but if it is, that price is going to just drop

[18:42] to the floor.

[18:43] It definitely is.

[18:45] I'm getting out.

[18:47] But then I'm like, well shit, I could buy another beaterspace shuttle and still buy

[18:52] Ghostbusters premium and that's so awesome.

[18:55] Everyone who buys a pinball machine thinks about the resale price.

[19:02] It's an investment.

[19:05] Everything else you buy, hot tubs, boats, motor, motor, everything else just drops through

[19:09] the floor.

[19:11] But pinball, I mean, they think it's not a bad investment at all.

[19:17] It's like a $6,000 toy.

[19:19] If there's $6,000 toy turned into a $2,000 toy, if it had the same amount of depreciation

[19:24] that every other hobby thing does and not nearly as many middle class people would be able

[19:30] to, well they might get into the hobby but they won't stay in it for very long.

[19:34] Let me tell everyone a sobering story real quick.

[19:36] I bought a $32,000 engagement ring.

[19:40] Oh.

[19:41] $32,000 I spent, all right?

[19:43] Is that?

[19:44] I sold it then.

[19:45] I sold it.

[19:46] It's like, it's different in New York, I suppose.

[19:50] It was a vintage ring from a San Francisco vintage dealer.

[19:53] It was the ring that my fiance wanted.

[19:57] I sold it back to them, to the same jeweler a year later for $16,000.

[20:06] So you tell me.

[20:07] That's worse than GameStop.

[20:09] And that is the best offer I got from all the jewelers in New York who offered me like

[20:14] $6,000 for it.

[20:16] So pinball is a decent investment, ladies and gentlemen.

[20:20] Oh yeah, definitely.

[20:21] No, I agree because I talked about you, how you can compress it down into your envelope

[20:26] and it's true.

[20:27] It's like it's sitting there and it's like, wow, anytime I want, you know, or if you're

[20:30] hard up for cash or if you have like a big bill, you sell that and it's not like going

[20:35] to the pawn shop and you get like, you know, 30 cents on the dollar because again, when

[20:40] you're selling back at an engagement ring, trading in a car, taking something to the pawn

[20:44] shop, whatever, taking something to GameStop, you're selling it to a business and like a typical

[20:48] retail business has to triple the price usually.

[20:51] So you don't get that but with pinball, it's so easy to sell.

[20:54] You get 100% of the value.

[20:56] One that's the thing is you'll sell it fast.

[20:58] I mean, it's like, if I list my Lord the Rings for seven grand, you know, Lord the Rings

[21:04] Ellie with all the mods, like someone will be there like in a week and they pick it up.

[21:08] It's like, it's great.

[21:09] I love it.

[21:10] All right.

[21:11] So let's talk about big enough topics.

[21:12] Well, I'm not saying, yeah, America's most haunted.

[21:15] We're going to like circle around.

[21:17] This is how it's going to be.

[21:18] I've had a few glasses of red wine tonight.

[21:21] Ben's back on the show.

[21:23] Let's go back to America's most haunted.

[21:25] Ben, tell us what you want to tell us about America's most haunted before we talk

[21:32] about pinball themes tonight.

[21:34] Okay.

[21:35] So I was like, okay, so what are the locations the ghost should be at?

[21:39] Those are the modes.

[21:40] And then the locations drove what the ghost bosses would be.

[21:43] So hospital, you have a doctor bar.

[21:47] We have like a prostitute.

[21:48] What else was there?

[21:49] Oh, a couple of the ones that changed, there is a hotel mode or location and there's also

[21:54] a war fort.

[21:55] And originally those ghosts were different.

[21:58] They were benevolent ghosts.

[21:59] The war fort was going to be the ghost of a little girl who got hit with a straight bullet

[22:04] in the civil war, which is like a ghost story out east.

[22:07] And then she was going to talk to you via a Ouija board, but it wouldn't be called that

[22:10] because that's the trademark of Hasbro, I think.

[22:12] Sure.

[22:13] Yeah, it was spirit board.

[22:15] And then the other one was going to be like this, some Bellboy who was in love with a movie

[22:19] star saying in a hotel and he was going to be the ghost in the hotel.

[22:23] And I was trying to write those characters and I'm like, this sucks.

[22:26] These ghosts are not interesting.

[22:28] Then I'm like, I need to make them just as antagonistic as the other ghosts.

[22:32] So I rewrote them.

[22:33] I'm like, okay, so hotel hotel.

[22:36] And so the hotel, when I'm like, oh, I'll make it based off H.H. Holmes.

[22:39] I don't know if you're familiar with that guy.

[22:41] The devil.

[22:42] Yeah.

[22:43] So for anyone who doesn't know, there was like the, what was it?

[22:47] The 1893 World's Fair, which was the really famous in Chicago.

[22:50] Yeah, with the Tesla lights and whatnot.

[22:53] And this is guy, his real name wasn't H.H. Holmes, but he was like a pharmacist and he built

[22:57] this basically a murder castle right across the street.

[23:01] And he would have his drugstore and then he would rent rooms.

[23:04] And he always liked to rent rooms to like young women.

[23:07] And all these people would keep disappearing during the World's Fair.

[23:09] Because the World's Fair went on for like six months.

[23:11] You know, it's like a year long thing or a long thing.

[23:15] And it turns out his murder castle had all these hidden rooms and secret passages and

[23:19] like lie pits in the basement.

[23:21] He was just dissolving all these people.

[23:23] So I'm like, okay, I'm gonna basically, instead of having like a bellboy who's got a crush

[23:26] on someone, I'm gonna turn this ghost into a vicious psychopath.

[23:30] And then I had Brian Kelly, the famous old pinball codger Brian Kelly.

[23:34] I was like, you know what, Brian?

[23:36] I got this ghost who's this old creepy psychopath and I think he'd be perfect to voice him.

[23:41] And he was.

[23:42] Yeah, so then the other thing with the little girl ghost.

[23:47] I was like, oh, maybe you're trying to communicate with the ghost.

[23:49] But the thing is, if we have four of the ghosts be antagonists and two of them are benign,

[23:54] that's lame.

[23:55] So I'm like, okay, yeah, sorry, little girl ghost, you're gone.

[23:58] And I'm like, okay, war fort.

[23:59] And I'm like, well, what would be funny?

[24:01] And that's where I came up with like the overly super stereotyped Southern Confederate

[24:05] General, which is actually voiced by Chuck.

[24:07] And he says things like, you're softer than the soft one on the belly of a possum with

[24:12] a soft one on the belly.

[24:14] And yeah, so I just wanted to, you know, make the characters way over the top and super

[24:19] stereotyped.

[24:20] And I think that really helped because it gave them identity and whatnot.

[24:23] And they just, they were more fun that way.

[24:25] Or like the prison ghost.

[24:27] I'm like, okay, what would an evil warden do?

[24:30] And I was like, I guess he'd eat people.

[24:32] Then of course that means he has to be fat.

[24:34] And you know, everything just kind of piles upon itself.

[24:37] And then, or like the doctor ghost.

[24:39] And I was like, well, the doctor ghost is kind of based off some reality.

[24:43] I think it was out east.

[24:46] I can't remember what the actual affliction is, but they were used to be called melon

[24:49] heads, like people that had like water attention in the head.

[24:53] And there was some doctor out east.

[24:55] And this is like a hundred years ago, he was taking these people to the affliction.

[24:58] And of course back then, they just threw you in an asylum and you, you know, forget about

[25:02] you.

[25:03] And he was doing experiments on them, like almost like kind of torturing them.

[25:06] And I'm like, hey, this is a great, a great premise for my doctor.

[25:10] So I'm going to have like this really awful doctor from like the early, you know, 19,

[25:14] you know, the 1900s.

[25:16] And I don't know.

[25:17] So, basing the ghost or and then the ghost horror was based off a, oh, what's your name?

[25:22] Elizabeth.

[25:23] What is it?

[25:24] There's a, it was a, I can never remember her last name, Bathory.

[25:28] Basically, she was this, this is like in medieval times, well, not quite medieval times.

[25:33] It was this young woman who inherited a bunch of land.

[25:36] And the rumor is that people accused her of being like a satanic witch just so they

[25:40] could basically get her land.

[25:42] But she was rumored to like get young virgin women, slice them up and like bathe in their

[25:47] blood.

[25:48] So I'm like, hey, that, okay, so old.

[25:49] That sounds pretty cool.

[25:51] Yeah, I'm just based off, you know,

[25:53] history.

[25:54] Um, and so I'm like, okay, what if he had a hooker ghost that does that?

[25:57] And she's like an old used up hooker.

[25:59] We don't call her a hooker ghost.

[26:00] We call her a woman of the night.

[26:02] But she's ghost horror in the script.

[26:05] And she could sound like, she could sound like a Southern bell, you know, and talk about

[26:09] bathing in blood.

[26:10] And then we have the Valley girls like I've tried that it totally doesn't work.

[26:13] And I think I was just kind of fun to, you know, base the ghosts off the locations and

[26:18] then have as much fun as we could with the characters and just play them off against

[26:21] our fairly straight list.

[26:22] Though goofy ghost hunters.

[26:24] Right.

[26:25] And we've heard in a lot of different sort of commentary on America's Rose Hanna that

[26:31] people do love the comical nature of the narrative, the call outs.

[26:36] You know, the game is different.

[26:37] It's like little wacky.

[26:38] It's a little fun.

[26:39] Yeah.

[26:40] Well, that's what separates it from like a lot of the other stuff that's out there.

[26:43] Well, there hasn't been a humorous pinball machine since, you know, what cactus Canyon?

[26:47] I mean, everything.

[26:48] Why is everything so serious?

[26:50] What's going on?

[26:51] I don't know.

[26:52] What is this?

[26:53] I don't know.

[26:54] I don't know.

[26:55] I don't know.

[26:56] What is this?

[26:57] Really.

[26:58] I mean, I kind of, even with ghost busters, you know, it's going to just be these are lines

[27:01] from the movie that you think are funny.

[27:03] I mean, I don't know.

[27:04] Maybe there's more writing in the game.

[27:05] But, oh, Big Lebowski is even better example.

[27:08] It's like, how many times can you hear nobody fucks with a Jesus?

[27:10] It's like, okay, I get it.

[27:11] Right.

[27:12] I don't know about the game.

[27:13] Well, it's funny when I play, when I play Lebowski.

[27:15] And like, and the lines from the movie that like make you laugh and are funny and like

[27:20] shocking, they're so like, expected in the pinball.

[27:24] It's like, we are like, I just, I don't feel anything when I play that game.

[27:30] Well, again, see, I kind of learned that when I was making the billpaks to the game.

[27:35] You know, I learned things from doing that.

[27:36] I learned a lot of things.

[27:38] And you know, if you might be like, how about a nice greasy pork sandwich served in the

[27:43] duty-estry?

[27:44] Now, that's how you do an impression of chat from Weird Science.

[27:47] Right.

[27:48] And the actual movie, he like barely whispers that line.

[27:51] Like, I squeeze you so much.

[27:53] Or aliens when he says game over, man, game over.

[27:55] He's like halfway in the background.

[27:57] There's wind blowing.

[27:58] And then after that, Newt says something.

[28:00] So it's, you're, you're, how you remember those lines in the context of the movie?

[28:06] It's not really how they're delivered.

[28:07] And they certainly weren't packaged in a way to be separated and delivered.

[28:11] Sometimes you get lucky like with the Star Trek's, you know, I know Paramount gave Stern like

[28:15] a clean audio versions of both of those, both of those movies, which was a big benefit.

[28:21] But older films, you don't have that luxury and it's a lot harder.

[28:24] So I don't know.

[28:25] I think it's, I think if I were to do something based off a movie, I would want to actually

[28:29] add additional speech and content to flush it out.

[28:32] Because otherwise, yeah.

[28:33] Then you just got, you know, Jesus, you know, rubbing his ball and saying nobody fucks

[28:37] with me over and over and over again.

[28:39] And I don't know.

[28:40] And there's really no context to it.

[28:42] It's just like, hey, here's that funny line you'll be thinking about.

[28:44] That's exactly right.

[28:45] It's like these lines are awesome in the movies because of what is before and after them.

[28:51] And when you just drop them in, it's like, I don't know, I think they'll lose some of

[28:54] the impact.

[28:55] So let's talk about what seems would be great for pinball machines.

[29:00] But before then, you've mentioned that you have a Ghostbusters premium on order.

[29:05] And I want to talk about that because you're the man who made America's most haunted.

[29:09] Like probably the most, the rare is ghost theme pinball machine of all time.

[29:14] Or as I like to call it, it's one of the two best ghost hunting related pinball machines

[29:19] ever made.

[29:20] Right.

[29:21] What's number one?

[29:22] I'm just, it's one of the two.

[29:24] It's Ghostbusters the other.

[29:26] Well, of course it is, but I'm just saying.

[29:28] All right.

[29:29] It's like when, if you asked James Cameron about the movie piranha to his responses, it's

[29:34] certainly the finest flying killer fish movie ever made.

[29:38] And he's right.

[29:39] Yes, although I'm sure sci-fi has made something.

[29:41] Right.

[29:42] Okay.

[29:43] So what made you order a Ghostbusters premium?

[29:44] Because I want to talk about this pin because there's been a lot of conversation about

[29:47] this pin recently.

[29:48] Well, you know, I, I didn't get to play it a lot.

[29:50] I played it a couple times in Texas.

[29:52] The thing that really struck me, well, first of all, I just wanted to buy a nib stern.

[29:57] I mean, who does it at some point?

[29:58] What, what made you like want to just get a nib stern?

[30:02] Just to do it.

[30:03] It's like, okay, cool.

[30:05] But in this, but I actually like, I really, I thought I wanted to get a nib.

[30:09] And I was like, what do you think of it as a game of thrones?

[30:10] And I'm like, oh, yeah, that'd be really cool.

[30:12] And but then I didn't really get to hyped up when I saw it.

[30:15] I just, I don't know, but then Ghostbusters, I'm like, well, you know, this would be a

[30:19] great.

[30:20] I'm obviously this game is going to again, it's going to be a desirable title in the

[30:23] future.

[30:24] It'll be easy to resell.

[30:25] It looks amazing.

[30:27] And the thing that really struck me about it is like everyone gets hung up on the fact

[30:29] that it's monochromatic and, you know, maybe that's a little longer than the tooth.

[30:33] But the presentation was really, really good.

[30:37] It was just so alive and it had a lot of energy, you know,

[30:40] along with all the, you know, Ghostbusters stuff.

[30:43] What do you mean monochromatic? Like, it's black and white dots.

[30:48] Oh, and a DMD, okay.

[30:50] Yeah, because I was like, the playfield.

[30:53] Oh, it's got lots of colors, okay.

[30:57] So, and look, we all know a color DMD is going to come out for this thing

[31:01] and going to make it look great.

[31:03] Okay, so like-

[31:04] We're talking about the rumored color DMD upgrade.

[31:07] I mean, like, whether it's from Stern or not, at the end of the day, like,

[31:11] the dots are great, even though they are, like, just red, which sucks.

[31:15] Well, I mean, it's, I think it's, yeah, it sucks, but I got to wonder,

[31:19] if the people who just get so hung up on a monochrome display,

[31:23] maybe they're the, the same people who won't watch a black and white movie

[31:27] or won't watch a movie with subtitles,

[31:29] it's not necessarily the medium in which it's delivered.

[31:33] It's how the story is told.

[31:35] And honestly, I mean, I think the presentation on Ghostbusters with its ancient display

[31:39] is leagues better than the Big Lebowski.

[31:42] Because the playing the Big Lebowski, the display and the presentation,

[31:45] it just felt inert to me.

[31:48] And I usually try not to say anything negative about other still-in-business

[31:53] pinball companies. I mean, I'll trash, just get me and Jay Pop all day long.

[31:56] But I mean, Dutch, I, you know, I was really excited when I saw that, you know,

[32:00] two years ago and everyone else does, but was as well.

[32:02] But I don't know. I think the license kind of held them back.

[32:04] Because if you look at, you played Brighton Pinball 2.0, right?

[32:08] I mean, like a couple times it shows, but that's it.

[32:11] Okay, so I, that's another game I would love to have.

[32:13] Because it has, it's covered with space shuttles.

[32:15] I love space shuttles.

[32:17] Anyway, the presentation on that, so it has like a color display,

[32:22] and then I think it has p-rock or something.

[32:24] The rules are already done.

[32:26] But the music, the speech, the sound, the graphics are all so well done.

[32:30] I mean, I saw that and I'm like, this is awesome.

[32:32] So, you know, they're going to do great things with Big Lebowski.

[32:34] But it just kind of feels like Big Lebowski, I don't think it's, I don't think it's their fault.

[32:39] I think the license kind of held it back, you know?

[32:42] They can't bring the energy, they can't bring the necessary energy through

[32:45] because of the, like the restrictions.

[32:47] Like with the speech, you know, well, like you have to have the movie plane

[32:51] whenever you have a clip.

[32:53] So if he says market zero, you have to see that scene from the movie.

[32:56] But why is that? Like no one else?

[32:58] I would assume it's a licensing issue.

[33:00] Well, that's, I think it's a bad, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very sharp.

[33:05] It varies by studio though.

[33:07] But, but, but, but, but, but, but, here's the thing.

[33:09] What studio, like really understands pinball?

[33:14] Like none, right?

[33:16] So like, if they're like, if they're like, here's our law, here's our rules of using a clip.

[33:20] And you're like, isn't it Roger Sharf's job to be like, well, if we do this in pinball,

[33:27] it's going to like not make for the best experience of your property.

[33:31] Like, here's what works best for pinball.

[33:34] Like, I don't, because what, I think when I play when I play La Bousky,

[33:37] the game is beautiful looking.

[33:40] It bores me to death the way the game like, like presents the theme.

[33:46] Yeah, I, I don't know.

[33:47] I personally think that's probably a byproduct of a licensing restriction.

[33:53] And, you know, we don't know what kind of restrictions they had to deal with.

[33:56] I mean, but we know the, the restrictions were more severe than people originally thought,

[34:02] and, or even Dutch thought.

[34:04] And all they didn't have the license.

[34:06] They had, they didn't have the license.

[34:08] They like, they, they, they, they, they have like a half life.

[34:11] Well, I mean, they had a half life, half life three confirmed.

[34:16] Well, whatever they had, they didn't have like, they didn't have everything ready before they showed it,

[34:22] which is a big problem.

[34:23] Right. Well, that's, that's the issue with older media.

[34:26] It was never designed to be turned into a pinball machine.

[34:30] If you have a newer, a newer show or a newer movie, maybe you get lucky and you have like a Seth MacFarlane

[34:36] who loves pinball, and they'll do a bunch of voices for free.

[34:39] Or, you know, you have a couple of, and they don't look at the pinball machine.

[34:42] Any differently than they would a lunch box.

[34:44] But then why would anyone, and this is always what always confuses me,

[34:48] why would anyone go after a license that didn't lend itself well to a pinball machine?

[34:56] And, and I mean that by like the restrictions of the studio, if they are like really bad and really like.

[35:02] Well, you probably, why bother?

[35:05] You probably wouldn't know that going in.

[35:07] Yeah, but, but you can know that like, okay, for a good pinball machine, I need the following.

[35:12] Like, I need the actors from the movie. I need, I need call out.

[35:15] I need to be able to use clips without having to like show the whole thing without playing music.

[35:20] Like, there's like, it's not that much.

[35:22] But like, I think when I watch like the alien whole, you know, when they reveal their machine,

[35:28] it's like, well, why would you go get a license if you can't even have the freaking actors from the movie on the play field?

[35:34] Um, well, I can't speak to their decision, but that I can see.

[35:40] But, but, but, but, but, but the, but the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the.

[35:43] Firstly, I, I wouldn't, I mean, I would, when we've looked at, when we've looked at stuff and you know,

[35:49] I think you said once that you expect spooky to do nothing but licenses going forward and, yeah, I think they should.

[35:54] I, I think you, you were correct in that assumption.

[35:58] Um, anyway, there was one we were looking at. I won't say what it was, but, um, it's like, well, it was golden girls.

[36:05] Wasn't it?

[36:06] Yeah.

[36:07] Murder she wrote Finn. That'd be pretty bad.

[36:09] That'd be amazing.

[36:10] It's a landsbury everywhere.

[36:12] Yeah.

[36:13] Uh, great. I just jinxed this. He's probably going to die tomorrow.

[36:15] Right.

[36:16] Anyway, we have this, we have this bad habit of killing actors at work.

[36:19] So far, we've killed Roddy Piper, um, Christopher Lee and who is the other one?

[36:23] Someone else.

[36:24] I think it was like, I don't know why I was like, hey, Max, have you ever seen, because my camera man is like 24.

[36:29] And my camera everybody's seen, but he's a film buff.

[36:31] Asking if he'd seen they live.

[36:33] And he's like, no, and I'm like, well, let me tell you about it in great detail.

[36:36] Well, we're setting up a shot.

[36:37] And then the next day, you're out of your apartment dead.

[36:40] I mean, granted, all wrestlers die young, but anyway, going back.

[36:44] Uh, so whenever we've looked at something, we want to make sure that.

[36:48] It's all there. So it's like, you pay this, you get this.

[36:51] You know, it's really, um, I don't want to say nicely packaged, but yeah, nicely packaged.

[36:57] And even like, you know, it's like, okay, if we do this, does it also give us the option to hire.

[37:02] X actor to speak additional lines in character in reference to this beyond what we can use from the property.

[37:11] Right. And so yeah, anything we've looked at, we want to make sure that, uh, you know, all that stuff is in place.

[37:16] But that's just, because otherwise it's just too hard to do.

[37:19] You don't have any.

[37:20] But that seems like so common, sensical, right?

[37:24] To like anyone who's approaching a new, like an in IP.

[37:28] Well, I mean, you might have kind of like, I don't want to say deer and headlights.

[37:32] Uh, but it's like, oh my gosh, I have a chance to get this really great license.

[37:36] And they, and maybe they just go for it.

[37:38] And then afterwards, like, oh crap, you know, they may not, you know, realize everything about it.

[37:43] Yeah, I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I give Dutch a pass because I mean, they played the whole like we weren't really sure how like it all worked.

[37:55] At least they were like 80% there when they had to bring Roger's shop on board.

[37:59] Um, but then you know, whatever.

[38:01] So I don't even want to go down like the predator.

[38:03] And that was just fucking stealing the license.

[38:05] So, um, all right.

[38:07] So let's talk about pinball machine licenses that we constantly hear on the forum.

[38:16] Oh, yes, I made a, I made a list.

[38:18] You made a list.

[38:19] So let's go down your list of themes that people think would make great.

[38:24] I think ball machines.

[38:25] Before we, yeah, go on.

[38:27] I need another beer first.

[38:28] I mean, do it.

[38:29] I'll be right back.

[38:30] All right.

[38:31] Well, we're going to break there.

[38:32] That's going to be part one.

[38:33] His Ben goes to get his beer.

[38:35] So just imagine that he's in the refrigerator right now.

[38:38] It's sort of funny listening back to his interview, knowing that I was a few red wines in when we were talking.

[38:44] But it's always fun to talk to Ben.

[38:47] And I think you guys are really going to enjoy part two of this interview where we really go into the, the themes that people think would make.

[38:53] For great pinball machines and we discussed that.

[38:56] So that is that part two is going to be uploaded tomorrow.

[39:00] So you guys can have both parts to listen to over the weekend.

[39:03] Again, I want to thank you guys for listening.

[39:05] Hope you're enjoying.

[39:06] Can it is pinball podcast.

[39:08] Until next time.

[39:10] Have a good one.
