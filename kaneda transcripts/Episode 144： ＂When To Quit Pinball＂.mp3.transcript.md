[00:00] Welcome to Kineita's Pinball Podcast, your weekly pinball podcast that gets right to it.

[00:22] I even cut the intro even shorter to like 10 seconds to get right to pinball news.

[00:28] That is something that I wish every other pinball podcast out there would do.

[00:33] Enough of these long introductions.

[00:36] We know what you're going to talk about.

[00:38] Pinball.

[00:39] Alright, I'm excited.

[00:40] I've got some coffee in me.

[00:42] I've got a fun episode planned for you guys.

[00:44] We're going to switch stuff up a little bit.

[00:46] But first I need to make a big announcement.

[00:49] Kineita is back in on Star Wars Ellie.

[00:52] I actually called up a distributor.

[00:54] I ordered a game.

[00:55] I went to bed last night and I said, why am I ragging on Star Wars?

[00:59] It really is.

[01:00] This amazing immersive game.

[01:03] It's built around my favorite theme of all time.

[01:05] How can I not get Star Wars?

[01:07] So I'm back in.

[01:08] I also have another announcement to make.

[01:11] The previous announcement that I made is a total lie.

[01:15] There is no way I'd go back in on Star Wars Ellie.

[01:18] But we're going to talk about Star Wars later.

[01:20] We've talked a lot about it.

[01:21] I want to start out this episode by starting in a different area.

[01:26] We'll get to Star Wars.

[01:27] We'll get to some of your feedback.

[01:28] I know I've been down on the game.

[01:31] But we're going to switch up the news a little bit.

[01:33] We're going to start with Chicago Gaming and the news coming out of there.

[01:39] The news this week is for those of you who ordered attack from Mars, remake, limit additions.

[01:46] The good news is those games are about to ship.

[01:48] So being told those games are going to ship this week.

[01:52] I've always thought that the limited addition remake is the way to go.

[01:56] The green armor actually looks really good in person.

[01:59] But what you really get is that amazing topper, which is incredible.

[02:03] They're not going to sell separately.

[02:04] You have to buy the limited edition.

[02:07] What is it?

[02:08] It's July 19th today.

[02:11] The games have not come out as fast as people would have liked.

[02:15] But the good news is you're going to get your game.

[02:18] They're asking people to be patient.

[02:20] There's a great photo on Pinside from Chicago Gaming Company of about 50 or 80 limited

[02:26] addition machines just lined up in a room waiting to go into final testing and then shipment.

[02:34] What they're waiting on right now is to get the toppers all ready to go with the machines.

[02:40] Because you can't ship this game without that awesome interactive topper.

[02:45] So for you guys out there who are in Tech Promars remake, good news is happening this week.

[02:50] I'll say this about Tech Promars remake because it is a remake.

[02:54] This just goes the same thing happen with medieval madness.

[02:57] There's never the amount of conversation or chatter that happens when people get their

[03:03] remakes.

[03:04] When they do the unboxings, it's not the same level of excitement as people unboxing

[03:10] Star Wars right now or Aerosmith or dialed in.

[03:14] It's just because even though there's enhancements to the game, it's still just an older game.

[03:20] Now that being said, if you want an attack from Mars, you've got to be crazy to go get an

[03:23] old one with what the new one delivers.

[03:25] So that is exciting news.

[03:29] What else is going on that I want to talk about on this episode 144 of Canadian Spinball

[03:34] Podcast?

[03:35] So this was an interesting thread that popped up.

[03:38] So we talk a lot about the new games.

[03:41] We talk a lot about Star Wars.

[03:43] We talk a lot about Dialding.

[03:45] We talk a lot about Lebowski on this podcast.

[03:48] I did get an email from someone asking me to consider talking about older titles.

[03:55] I also did a little jab at one of my favorite pinball YouTube series, which is straight

[04:03] down the middle pinball show.

[04:06] I love it.

[04:07] Zach and those guys over there put on a great show.

[04:09] I was about to record a podcast and I saw they had posted on Pinside.

[04:14] Their new topic was they're going to review the shadow and I was like, well, we're not

[04:19] the podcast to go review games that are that old.

[04:22] I'm actually going to hopefully be on their show soon.

[04:25] We've been talking about possibly doing a Star Wars review.

[04:30] I want to say this.

[04:32] Anyone who picks up a mic, anyone who has a pinball show or podcast, all of us collectively

[04:39] are in support of each other.

[04:41] I think a lot of times people want there to be some sort of division, want there to be

[04:46] some sort of competition, but I don't see it like that at all.

[04:49] I really do appreciate anybody who wants to make pinball content and put it up there.

[04:55] The kind of content I make and the way I direct my show is the way I want to do it.

[05:02] I think it's the way my listeners want to receive pinball news.

[05:06] There are plenty of shows out there that review older games.

[05:08] There are plenty of shows out there that talk about pinball strategy and what to do in

[05:13] games and look back and review old games.

[05:17] Here's five games that I hate.

[05:18] Here's five games that I love.

[05:20] We don't really go into that.

[05:21] I see this program as primarily the only pinball program that is focused on news and new

[05:29] games.

[05:30] We'll continue to be that way.

[05:32] Don't worry.

[05:33] We're not going to start going too much into the past.

[05:34] That being said, a lot of times when we talk about the news and new games, we have to

[05:39] talk about them within the context of pinball collecting and older titles.

[05:44] We will do that from time to time.

[05:48] There was an interesting thread that popped up on Pinside that was revisiting a game that's

[05:52] not ancient.

[05:53] It's pretty recent and that game is the Hobbit.

[05:56] The Hobbit is a game that has now been out what a year and a half, two years came out

[06:03] in 2016.

[06:06] The Hobbit is a game that I think it's been a very polarizing game for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:13] I've never been a big fan of the Hobbit.

[06:15] I've always felt the game played really slow.

[06:19] I've always felt the theme itself disappointed me because the movies were so lackluster.

[06:26] I always felt like the game just never clicked.

[06:29] I think Crazy Levy said it to me the best when we were playing at once.

[06:32] He said it's just like chopping wood.

[06:34] You just keep chopping wood.

[06:35] That was early on.

[06:37] What's happening now with the Hobbit is an interesting thing because as code as matured,

[06:43] as more and more people have played the game with Keith's code progressing, more and

[06:49] more people are enjoying the game.

[06:53] Here's what I want to go down a list of what people who have owned this game for a while

[06:57] are now saying the pros and cons of the game are.

[07:01] The reason why I want to talk about the Hobbit is with where Pinball prices are going now.

[07:07] If you're a Pinball player, a Pinball collector, you have to be somewhat curious as to where

[07:15] you should spend your money if you want to spend, say, $7,500.

[07:20] The $7,500 can now get you an Aerosmith premium.

[07:25] It can get you an attack from Mars remake.

[07:27] It can get you a Star Wars.

[07:31] It could pay a little bit more.

[07:33] It could get you a dialed in.

[07:34] It could get you a really nice home-use only Smalg edition Hobbit.

[07:40] Remember those games sold for closer to $9,000 new.

[07:45] All of a sudden, with where prices are at, Hobbit starts to look like an attractive

[07:50] thing to consider for that kind of money.

[07:54] Let's go down the pros and cons.

[07:57] This is from individuals who have the game in their home.

[08:01] The pro number one is it's a beautiful machine.

[08:03] It is one of the prettiest machines that has ever been made.

[08:07] I would agree with that.

[08:08] I think when you stand over a Hobbit and you look at it, it's gorgeous.

[08:12] I think it shows that Photoshopped artwork doesn't have to be a complete turd fest like

[08:17] Star Wars and Game of Thrones.

[08:20] Hobbit is a big license, but look what they did with it.

[08:23] Look at the detail in that Photoshop job.

[08:25] I think whoever did that far more talented than the way Stern is arranging their Photoshop.

[08:31] I got to stop like ragging on the Star Wars.

[08:33] I can't stop.

[08:34] I just loved the theme so much.

[08:36] I am just so heartbroken.

[08:37] Okay, I'll go on.

[08:39] Another pro for the Hobbit is it's got the best light show, one of the best light shows

[08:44] in Pimble.

[08:45] I would have to also agree with that.

[08:47] If you've ever stood over a Hobbit and watched someone play it, the full RGB LEDs, how they

[08:53] are incorporated into the game, into the modes, into the theme, how they sync up with the

[08:57] music, absolutely stunning to watch a Hobbit.

[09:01] Keith's code is considered a pro.

[09:04] There's 31 modes in this game.

[09:07] Keith is obviously famous for his Lord of the Rings code.

[09:11] I would argue that this game, yes, has a ton of depth.

[09:15] So people who have it in their home, they enjoy the amount of stuff there is to do.

[09:21] I heard to you a lot of people talk about, and this is one of the cons, but I'll talk

[09:25] a little bit about it in the pros, is the way Keith coded the machine, there are a lot

[09:32] more shots than people think because of how the code works.

[09:36] So for example, the ramp in the Hobbit, the ramp looks like it's just a fish tail's

[09:41] cross ramp, but in actuality when you learn the game, that ramp turns into activating different

[09:49] things within the mode.

[09:50] So it's more than just a ramp.

[09:53] This ramp becomes switches, it becomes rollovers, it becomes, I'm just saying a bunch of

[09:57] words, I don't even know what I'm talking about, but what I've been told is that the code

[10:01] creates far more shots than meets the eye.

[10:06] I don't even know if I believe that after saying it, I kind of just said it because I read

[10:10] it.

[10:11] I still think without code, these are the shots, right?

[10:16] I mean, you can't kind of add shots because this area turns into activating something else.

[10:21] That doesn't make it a new shot, it might activate something new in the code.

[10:25] Okay, so I'm going to put that as a quasi-pro.

[10:31] It has the best sound in a game is what people are saying, and if you've listened to a Hobbit

[10:35] or a Jersey Jack Pan, I think you hook up a subwoofer to a smougadish in Hobbit, and

[10:40] it's going to sound incredible.

[10:42] So those are the pros, right?

[10:43] Sounds good, looks good, it's got great code.

[10:46] The cons, the cons list starts to get, you know, still equally as long, if not longer,

[10:51] that the gameplay is just meh, meh.

[10:55] I've always felt that the gameplay in the Hobbit suffers from one thing.

[10:59] It's a wide body, and I just for the love of me, I don't understand why wide body

[11:06] pinball machines are made.

[11:09] There's never been an example where I've played a wide body and enjoyed it more than a standard

[11:14] body, and I think dialed-in is a proof point that you can put more in a standard body than

[11:22] you can even in a wide body if you just get creative, if you get creative with the pinball

[11:28] machine.

[11:29] I think the reason why people are loving dialed in so much more than the Hobbit and

[11:33] even Wizard of Oz is the standard body layout, and the fact that it's all the shots are

[11:39] tighter, all the shots flow better together, that you don't have this massive wide open

[11:45] center playfield like you do in the Hobbit.

[11:48] And the ball still to me floats around in the Hobbit, you'll never get a Hobbit to play

[11:52] as fast as a standard body.

[11:53] I don't care if you jack up the legs 10 feet, you're still not going to get it to play

[11:59] as fast as a standard body.

[12:01] Another con is that there's not much to shoot at, we were just talking about that.

[12:05] Again, if you look at the game, you've got the three pop-up trolls, or the three or five,

[12:11] at least forget.

[12:12] You've got the cross ramps, you've got, you know, there's not much.

[12:18] The pop-up area, you've got a vertical upkick, but the game has always suffered from a lack

[12:24] of shots in most people's minds.

[12:27] Another con is the LCD screen is very confusing, there's a lot going on on it.

[12:31] You look at the Hobbit screen and it's like, what am I doing?

[12:34] I can't figure this out.

[12:35] I think that also plagued wasps that has been completely fixed with dialed in.

[12:41] Then the last con is no final wizard mode, that people who own the game are still waiting

[12:45] for a final wizard mode.

[12:47] So, that is like where the Hobbit stands today.

[12:51] Now, what do I think will be the Hobbit's legacy?

[12:54] How will the Hobbit go down in history?

[12:56] The way I think about it is this.

[12:59] It's not just Hobbit.

[13:00] I think that, and this is my belief, right now, if you look at Pinball, and the way new

[13:07] Pinball machines are coming out, the quality of machines from Jersey Jack, from Stern, from

[13:13] Highway Pinball, from Dutch Pinball, from Chicago Gaming, all the games.

[13:18] Okay, you put all the games, spooky Pinball, all the manufacturers, P3, everything coming

[13:23] out now.

[13:24] If you were to ask me, five years from now, can eight, a ten years from now, how will

[13:28] these games be judged?

[13:31] Will people want these games in their collection?

[13:34] My honest answer is this.

[13:36] Jersey Jack Pinball is the modern day version of Valley Williams.

[13:41] These games are going to be seen years from now as the best built games that tried the

[13:49] hardest to put the best elements and be the most innovative and use the best materials

[13:53] possible to make Pinball machines.

[13:56] Stern Pinball games, if they keep going the way they're going, are going to look like

[14:00] Sega games.

[14:02] Ironic, that Sega turn into Stern.

[14:03] I don't think Stern is up the game very much.

[14:06] I don't think people are going to want these Stern games so many years from now.

[14:09] I think they're going to look at the Jersey Jack games as being the high quality games.

[14:14] Now, who wants to think five, ten years in the future?

[14:17] Nobody really does, because you know what?

[14:18] There might be so many games that come out in that time period that no one will give

[14:22] a shit about any of these games.

[14:24] That's a very good possibility.

[14:27] Also, if you haven't, go try PlayStation VR.

[14:30] Strap it on.

[14:31] We're all fucked.

[14:33] Nobody, no kids are going to want these machines.

[14:35] There is not going to be a Pinball collectible community twenty, thirty years from now.

[14:41] This is it, people.

[14:43] Go try PlayStation VR and do the car chase scene where you're actually sitting inside

[14:49] this car chase.

[14:51] You're inside Gramp that auto.

[14:53] Pinball is so archaic when you see where video games are going.

[14:57] Now a lot of you guys don't want to do that.

[14:58] You think, well, there's no replacement for this.

[15:00] I get it.

[15:01] But yes, there's no way to replicate and virtualize pinball, but people won't even want it.

[15:07] You know, anyway, so what I'm saying is you have to enjoy pinball in the here and in

[15:12] the now, because it's not going to be around forever and it's not going to have decades

[15:16] more excitement and new games coming out for decades.

[15:20] So I think right now though, if you have $1,700 should you buy a habit?

[15:24] I still think the answer is probably no.

[15:28] And I'll explain why.

[15:29] I've never seen a game that continues to require so much explanation and justification for

[15:37] why it's great, but every time people jump on it, they're just not getting it.

[15:42] I understand that it needs to be in a home use only environment and you have to spend

[15:46] a lot of time with it for the game to grow on you.

[15:48] But I really don't want to spend $7,500, $8,000.

[15:54] And then I find out it's not the game for me.

[15:57] Okay, I think pinball should be more immediately gratifying.

[16:01] I think it should be more immediately fun.

[16:03] And that is what the Bally Williams games brought to the tables.

[16:07] You don't need to jump on a whitewood or a funhouse or a toad in or a theater of magic.

[16:13] You don't need to bring it home and spend intimate amounts of days with it before the game

[16:19] becomes fun and you feel the magic of the game.

[16:22] So I think it is kind of ironic that a game that's got the best sound, best lights, the

[16:26] best is the best that still takes a really long time to get under people's skin.

[16:32] But look, you wait a year, Hobbit Ellie's, Smog editions, they'll be going for $6,000.

[16:39] They will.

[16:40] There's so many games coming out and then it's a real steal.

[16:43] I mean, it's really becoming a secondhand market.

[16:46] All right, let's move on.

[16:48] There was another great thread before that.

[16:50] Let's go to Star Wars because I know you guys are like, canators going to say something

[16:53] about Star Wars and then Steve Richie's never going to come on his show.

[16:58] Well, I don't expect Steve or Dwight to come on the show anytime soon.

[17:00] I happily would welcome them on the show, but I have been saying some disparaging remarks

[17:06] about Star Wars.

[17:08] I've been on the Aussie arcade forums explaining my rationale.

[17:12] And one of the points I made about Star Wars and why I'm so disappointed is basically this.

[17:18] To summarize, canators' opinions about Star Wars, I think Star Wars is a fun pinball machine.

[17:24] I think it shoots fast.

[17:25] I think it has flow.

[17:27] I think as a pinball game, it's fun.

[17:29] I think as a Star Wars pinball game, it's a complete failure.

[17:34] I think you have to understand that a pinball machine that is based on a license has a responsibility

[17:44] to bring that license to life in the best possible way.

[17:48] And I don't think Star Wars does that.

[17:50] I don't think Alien does that.

[17:52] And let me explain why.

[17:54] If you were to think about the Star Wars movies and just go down a list, I listed this

[17:59] on the Aussie arcade forums.

[18:00] A list of all the iconic scenes that are in that film that could have been brought to life.

[18:05] Han Solo being frozen in carbonite could have been a lower play field thing.

[18:08] The Emperor's Chamber could have been an upper play field thing.

[18:12] You could have had the Ewok Village.

[18:13] You could have had the Escape from Hoth.

[18:16] You could have had the land speeders on the Ewok planet.

[18:23] You could have had Yoda raising the X-wing with Luke.

[18:26] You could have had Obi-Wan in Luke training.

[18:29] You could have had Luke trying to beat the Sam people.

[18:31] All these things that you could have had.

[18:34] And instead, we just get ramps and we get targets and we get a tie fighter on the spring.

[18:41] So I made my point clear.

[18:44] I'm not in on Star Wars.

[18:45] I'm not going to beat a dead horse.

[18:46] I want to read what some people have sent me in terms of their feedback on Star Wars.

[18:52] So I got from listener Shilor.

[18:55] He said Chris, just got done listening to your Star Wars review.

[18:58] I own a pro and granted I only have about 20 games on it personally, but do feel it

[19:04] is really fun at this point in time.

[19:06] I'm weird in the fact that I like a game that kicks my ass and makes me work for it, which

[19:11] this one does.

[19:12] The mixture of how fast it is, with a couple of awkward shots like the Death Star

[19:17] shot, has me hitting the start button over and over after training.

[19:22] I do have a degree with a lot of what you have said about the lack of immersion for the

[19:26] player.

[19:27] I feel like it's a double edged sword.

[19:30] This is now the fifth Star Wars pin and by far the best one to date, but it's still a

[19:34] long ways off in the aspects of theme immersion.

[19:38] You mention how linear the Star Wars story is and how the machine could easily follow that

[19:43] storytelling.

[19:45] Ghostbusters, which was done by Dwight also, so shows he can do linear games, has been

[19:51] rake through the coals for having the same mode and the same order over and over again.

[19:56] I feel like the designers are fucked either way.

[19:59] They go off the books and design a game, whatever they want it to be and get kicked and ridiculed.

[20:05] They make a game too linear and the same thing happens.

[20:09] Perhaps there truly is no satisfying pinball players with huge license theme games.

[20:14] How many license pinball themes have there been over the years and how many of them can

[20:18] say they truly immersed you via nothing but gameplay?

[20:23] Lord the Rings is about the one exception in my book.

[20:30] Look at Williams Indiana Jones, which is one of my favorite games, but even it doesn't

[20:33] suck you into the Indiana Jones world the way it could.

[20:37] The big toy feature is the tilting bridge, which is cool, but after you do it a few times,

[20:42] it's more annoying than anything.

[20:44] Let me know your thoughts.

[20:45] Well, Sharlor, thank you for the note and look.

[20:51] I agree that trying to make Star Wars may be difficult and trying to code Star Wars to

[21:00] capture the way the film unfolds is a challenge.

[21:04] But they spent two years making this game two years.

[21:09] What is that?

[21:10] 700?

[21:11] And is it 820 days?

[21:13] I can't even do math anymore.

[21:15] Whatever it is.

[21:16] No, it's like 700 and I can't.

[21:19] Whatever.

[21:20] I spent over 700 days working on this game going and conceptualizing it and I just think

[21:26] what they dropped on the play field just did.

[21:29] Look, it just doesn't bring enough of it to life.

[21:32] It just doesn't.

[21:33] And I kind of feel that they had this design, like because when you look at it too, it's

[21:37] like they're still cherry picking.

[21:41] This comes from ACDC.

[21:42] This comes from this game.

[21:43] This comes from that game.

[21:44] It's like the stuff's not even original.

[21:47] I'm sorry, but that LCD screen with the three sterile targets underneath it that don't

[21:54] even move, that don't even drop, that is to me that is just like, how can you use such

[21:59] a big piece of real estate in a game and have nothing there.

[22:03] And then if you lift up the play field on Star Wars, it almost feels like there were supposed

[22:08] to be a big magnet in the middle of the game because if you look at underneath it where

[22:12] that Millennium Falcon is, if you look underneath the play field, there is just a

[22:16] humongous empty spot there where you could stick your hand.

[22:21] There's no lights, there's no feature, there's no mechanism, there's nothing there.

[22:27] So that leads me to believe that they made it, they may have taken something out.

[22:33] And I just think Star Wars deserved more.

[22:35] Now in terms of coding, I get it that Dwight, you know, his ghost buster's coding wasn't

[22:41] the most popular.

[22:42] But man, he's just porting over the same approach for Game of Thrones to Star Wars and I don't

[22:47] think it works combining different modes with the game.

[22:50] I just don't.

[22:52] I think that it should have been looked at separately and not just a rehash of what they've

[22:59] been trying before.

[23:00] But again, that's my whole point.

[23:02] Is that Stern Pinball people right now, they just keep doing the same stuff over and over

[23:07] again so it doesn't matter what theme you throw onto the table or what assignment you give

[23:11] them, you're going to get Steve's game, you're going to get Dwight's game, you're not going

[23:17] to get sort of the best possible Star Wars game and that's my issue.

[23:22] Is these guys are just, they're just using and rehashing what they've done before.

[23:27] Come on, look down at Star Wars people, is it just me?

[23:30] Look down at that game and tell me what you see on that play field that is innovative.

[23:37] What do you see on that play field that is magical?

[23:40] Do you want to see the ball do that is spectacular?

[23:45] The reason why people who play tournaments and they love it and the people who go to all

[23:50] the barcades and all the different pinball bars around the country, they love it is simple

[23:54] because those people love any new pinball machine and they love the challenge of understanding

[24:00] how to score in the game and that's what they enjoy and that's what they love it.

[24:04] I'm not knocking those people but those people don't care at all about seeing the ball

[24:10] do magical things about progressing through the actual modes in the game to hear lights

[24:16] and sounds.

[24:17] That's not the stuff that moves them because in their world all they're looking to do

[24:22] is exploit the code to get to the points that get them to win, to get them to hold up the

[24:27] trophies, to get them the glory that they want within their pinball circle.

[24:31] But for the rest of us, which is like 90% of us are not those people, probably more.

[24:36] What we want to see is a magical game in our homes that when people come over we can

[24:41] say let me show you how to do this.

[24:44] If you have a friend come over to play Star Wars, how are you going to explain to them all

[24:48] the different complexities of Dwight's code?

[24:50] You can't.

[24:51] And then what you're left with is oh man just shoot here, shoot there, wait wait you see

[24:56] what this happens, you're not going to be able to really show them magic happening on

[25:02] the playbook because there's just nothing there.

[25:04] Alright I'm going to go on to someone else's comment because I'll just keep going.

[25:08] Will wrote me, Will and Jeanette said hello canada I am a pinball will from pinside love

[25:15] your podcast looks fun to be on your podcast and talk some pinball.

[25:21] So he's coming on he's from Holland we're going to get will we're going to get you on

[25:24] the show we've already been talking back and forth.

[25:26] Alright I got a I got an email from from Jared.

[25:30] Jared Jobs about my his my take on Star Wars he basically says linear versus stacking world

[25:35] under glass versus LCD.

[25:37] What could what could have been versus what is story versus competitive pinball.

[25:42] This is why you are so get it what you do great angle smart and logical thanks Jared I

[25:46] appreciate it.

[25:47] You know I kind of I'm not just reading comments from people who say create canada you're

[25:51] absolutely right.

[25:53] Alright this is a long one from Dan.

[25:56] Judy Eras and Dan thank you for writing and listening to canada pinball podcast.

[26:01] Now Dan was able to play Star Wars pro recently he told me he got about 10 games on it and

[26:06] here's what he said he said I have to say it did grow on me a bit after I started to

[26:11] get a feel for the shots but overall I wasn't all that thrilled about it.

[26:15] In contrast I also played a game on pirates and a game on Williams Indy and both of those

[26:23] were far more straight forward than Star Wars.

[26:25] I suppose overall it was just confusing and I never felt like I actually knew what

[26:29] I was shooting for after a few games I was starting to warm up to the location and feel

[26:34] the physical shots but game rule wise I never felt like any of the shots I made were actually

[26:40] getting me through the modes or closer to anything or accomplishing much of anything.

[26:47] Okay so so here's the thing Dan first of all thank you for for writing and for those

[26:53] of you out there who want your opinions heard you know how to do it canada pinball at

[26:56] gmail.com.

[26:57] Look I think a lot of us also have unfair expectations of knowing what to do with a pinball

[27:03] machine the second we walk up to it and you're not going to do it with these modern

[27:07] stirrns with dialed in there is no way all of these games all of these games require a

[27:12] tutorial that goes far deeper than the rule card that's on the apron of the game.

[27:19] You don't know what to do.

[27:20] It's not as a parent is just bash the genie and toad in or shoot for the ring up the

[27:24] ramp you know to start a mode.

[27:26] What what you need to do in these games requires a lot so people's initial impressions of

[27:32] all pinball machines is always going to be somewhat underwhelming because we're confused

[27:36] about what is going on.

[27:39] That being said that being said I talk to a lot of people who played a lot of Star Wars

[27:44] Pro and it's a lot like game of thrones and how many of you out there show of hands really

[27:49] know what the hell is going on when you play game of thrones.

[27:52] Exactly.

[27:53] You can expect more from Star Wars at least Ghostbusters even in its linear fashion.

[27:59] The mistake Dwight made was you couldn't time out a mode so people were playing the

[28:03] modes over and over and the fact that they changed that made it much better but for the

[28:08] most part I still think that Star Wars is so confusing and it's going to be this complex

[28:18] nightmare and look Josh Sharp said it who else do you need to confirm that this game is

[28:24] too confusing.

[28:25] Josh Sharp when he talked to Nate Chiver said it he doesn't even it's just it's gotten

[28:30] ridiculous and the fact that he's confused and this man has played every single pinball

[28:36] machine probably ever he's confused he's and he but he's not confused in like well it's

[28:41] really deep and you should go learn it because it's so rewarding.

[28:45] No he's saying it's confusing it's complex this isn't where pinball should be going if

[28:51] pinball wants to get more people into the hobby and if pinball wants to be immediately

[28:56] fun the way it's supposed to be you know he's saying it in the sense that it's we've

[29:00] gone too far we need to go back and make these games easier to understand and put the magic

[29:06] back on the play field and not on the screens and the magic can't only be deep deep deep

[29:12] into these like codes that are complex all right we're going to change topics enough

[29:16] Star Wars if you like it go buy it the last point I'll make is this I'm really shocked

[29:20] how many people are buying Star Wars pro the pro is so stripped down it looks like stern

[29:26] the pin the Spider-Man pin if you have fifty three hundred dollars to buy a Star Wars

[29:31] pro why don't you just don't you have two thousand dollars more don't you have two thousand

[29:37] dollars more to buy the premium which has the main feature of the game which is the

[29:42] hyper drive which has the death star that you shoot the ramp up to it that opens up don't

[29:47] you have see that's my thing about like I don't get it you shouldn't be buying five thousand

[29:52] dollar pinball machines if you don't have seven thousand dollars to buy a pinball machine

[29:56] are people really sort of getting by just enough money to buy a pro I'm shocked I think

[30:03] I thought that only operators only people that put this game on location would even go

[30:09] within a country mile of a pro which leads me to the next topic there was a great topic

[30:15] started by long time listener and friend of the show Beasel Boo or Beasel Bob Beasel

[30:21] Boo Hanseman no I joke so he wrote a good topic though he wrote why do people leave this

[30:28] hobby and it was a question he poised on pin son and I think it's a really great one

[30:33] and I want to talk about it a little bit on this podcast because it's a question I think

[30:38] we all ask ourselves at one point or another have I had enough am I still getting enjoyment

[30:45] from this hobby is it time for me to take a break so let's dive into this question and ask

[30:51] ourselves that very question so when they they gave a bunch of reasons why they think

[30:56] people leave the hobby number one was financial one of the reasons was pinside one of the reasons

[31:01] was people move on to other hobbies one of the reasons was Beasel Boo himself rejoining

[31:06] pinside what I want to do is this I want to read some people's responses in that thread

[31:12] as to why they think people leave the hobby and then I'm going to give you my reasons

[31:15] that I have for why I would leave the hobby and I'm going to give you my reasons why I

[31:21] stay in this hobby okay actually you know it was interesting because wise snow our friend

[31:26] wise snow sometimes has moments of clarity and intelligence and I wish he would only post

[31:33] when he had an intelligent thing to say you know so he wrote and I think these are all really

[31:38] valid reasons why people leave the pinball hobby he wrote they liked the hustle of finding

[31:44] new games and fixing reselling but that has dried up they liked competing but that got

[31:50] boring after a while and they aren't as good as the 13 year olds they liked getting the

[31:54] newest game on the block and flipping in three months later but now the prices are too high

[31:59] they liked to mod but then overspent and got burned on a sale so they stopped they tried to fix

[32:06] a game and got defeated and quit so he's got a lot of topics there that are reasons why people

[32:12] quit the pinball hobby and ultimately look everything you do when you choose a hobby it's exciting

[32:20] when you get into it the the newness of any hobby oftentimes leads people to sort of overinvest

[32:26] and go overboard and want too much too fast and it's something that I encountered when I did my

[32:32] bedroom arcade I wasn't an arcade collector I knew that I didn't even know that you could go

[32:39] by restored arcade games I didn't know what club was I didn't know what these forms were and what

[32:45] happens is when you start becoming part of a hobby you naturally enter into the forum and that's

[32:51] where you learn sort of all the different aspects and what's possible of the hobby you also ask

[32:56] people for advice on what games you should get you ask people for advice on like what things are

[33:01] priced at you ask people for advice on all sorts of things right but oftentimes when you're new

[33:08] to a hobby what you don't understand is do like what is the price of things like what should I pay

[33:13] for stuff and when I went into the arcade collecting world I got ripped off so badly I won't name

[33:18] who ripped me off I knew exactly who it was he's actually one of the a notable figure in the arcade

[33:24] collecting world and and he charged me so much more for games than they were worth and I didn't

[33:30] know like what condition games you know what condition the game should be into be $3,000 versus

[33:36] $1,000 and I just I just want an arcade I wanted to just fast as possible and I think a lot of people

[33:42] who get into pinball they hear like oh these are the 10 best games they go buy them this is like

[33:47] collectors right they go buy them they they put them on their game room and they're not even

[33:51] sure if they love those games and I think that also leaves people with an empty feeling that these

[33:57] aren't maybe the games for me and when I built my arcade I put the games in my arcade that I

[34:01] thought everyone would want to play which was Tron Donkey Kong and Miss Pac-Man and let me tell you

[34:08] the three games I never really played much of were Tron Donkey Kong and Miss Pac-Man because I

[34:14] wasn't even really a child who grew up with those being my favorite games I liked the games from

[34:21] the 90s more Street Fighter I liked Neo Geo I liked fighting games I liked Daytona USA and so I

[34:30] you know I made the mistake I built what I thought would be the iconic looking game room but I

[34:36] filled it with stuff that really was in my favorite stuff and and then one stuff sits there and

[34:42] is not played very often you really are like well why am I even bothering why don't I get rid of

[34:46] this stuff my my arcade has been gone now for a few months and I don't miss I don't miss the games

[34:51] I don't miss the games like if I sold them tomorrow I'd be fine with that another response was

[34:58] from a Pinside user 85 vet he wrote I still play my games but I do find it hard to enjoy them now

[35:05] by myself ever since I started playing in tournaments I used to hit the ball round for fun of which I

[35:12] now have a goal to achieve when I play I miss the days of just naive play as it was more fun because

[35:18] of this and the money I've seriously thought about selling off things I'm 85 vet I think that's

[35:24] a really poignant and powerful thing you captured there and I think it's a lot of what we talk about

[35:31] with the difference between playing pinball for fun and trying to get through the modes of the game

[35:37] and and and see the lights go and the sound go and and and watch like watch the physical stuff

[35:44] happen in the game that naive sort of casual play I believe is what makes pinball the most fun

[35:51] trying to set the high score and compete and and and seeing these games as you know competitive

[35:58] devices I think takes away from the fun because I look at pinball machine like super mario brothers

[36:06] and I want to get through the levels of the game and get to the really cool like final levels and

[36:12] boss levels right I want to get to like battle the genie I want to get to um destroy the ring I

[36:17] want to get to there and back again you know I want to get to those parts of the game horde mode in

[36:22] the walking dead like that's what makes pinball fun and that's what makes people excited um

[36:29] not the score how many of you have ever like played through these those games and got into fun modes

[36:35] in those games and actually gave two shits about what your score was at that point no you felt

[36:39] the sense of accomplishment because you got to that part in the game and you know and that's what

[36:44] I think pinball is missing I think these new designers are designing it for guys who are really

[36:49] just competitive players and if you want to compete at something go go learn a competitive game I

[36:55] mean I don't really think pinball is I imagine if pinball game the winner was just the person who

[37:00] got the furthest in the game forget the score how far did you get you know I even like total

[37:06] annihilation because you could you could code that game where it's just the winner is who got the

[37:11] most reactors blown up and you don't even have to score it in an nutritional sense like you got 87

[37:17] percent of the way there you win you got 57 percent of the way there you lose all right pinball

[37:23] new broat how in the how would pinside make someone get out of pinball the two can be very much

[37:28] mutually exclusive like I've seen people burn out of pinball because of pinside guys like

[37:34] Beasel Booble tell you rare hero the hyper users center flank it pinside is a vortex it's a black hole

[37:44] it is a place where you can get sucked into it and it can destroy your love of the hobby and

[37:49] and I'll explain why because there's a lot of negativity on pinside there's a lot of name

[37:55] con there's a lot of personal attack and that goes on on that site and for people who go on

[38:01] pinside every day it's also a humongous amount of time they spend making pinball the center of

[38:07] their universe so guys like health and wise know I know it makes fun of them but the reality is

[38:12] this health and wakes up and spends the majority of his free time in life the majority of his internet

[38:18] usage is on pinside like that's his second world his second life is his pinside avatar and there's

[38:25] other people like that you know who they are they're on there every weekend they're on every night

[38:30] they never go a day they never go a week without being on pinside I mean I feel like my friend

[38:35] iceman's like that they're always on there and the reality is this they're addicted they're

[38:40] addicted to pinside they're addicted to keeping up their social cloud on the site and when you go

[38:47] down that rabbit hole it's really not healthy because what happens is you start to place a very

[38:53] large emphasis on something that isn't really that important like you're literally screaming and

[39:00] threatening someone over pinball and I've gotten in you know I like I've had all torquations with

[39:06] some of these individuals where they're basically like threatening me they're gonna ruin my life they're

[39:11] gonna call my boss up all over a pinball dispute and all over name calling that originated because

[39:17] we differed on a pinball topic and you start to realize I'm a grown man and this is the thing

[39:24] that's making me lose my temper lose my cool this is the thing that's really upsetting me in the world

[39:30] and you get really ashamed that you've allowed it to do that and you want out I mean pinside can

[39:36] cause people to burn out I also think pinside is so poorly moderated these days the moderator

[39:42] should be ashamed of themselves they let so much of the negativity occur and it's almost like

[39:46] they want it to be there I mean they could easily implement a policy we're like if you personally

[39:51] attack anyone you're out of the site for good that's it if you did that once the change of

[39:56] behavior would be so much different and the way people talk to each other but yeah pinside is

[40:01] definitely a real problem Jeff Rivera friend Jeff Jarwh is a one five five Jeff wrote I think

[40:07] for people who came in from a collector's angle rather than a player's angle can just one day

[40:13] realize that they've collected what they want and the thrill of the chase is gone for those who

[40:18] really love to play and it's not just a flavor the month obsession they stick around I agree Jeff

[40:25] I think that collecting when you enter any hobby as a collector whether you're a car collector

[40:31] whether you're a pinball collector a toy collector an arcade collector here's the difference

[40:37] collectors want to keep their collections pristine mint usually in good condition now there are

[40:44] some collectors out there that will buy pinball machines and bang on them and not care and just

[40:48] have fun with them but for the most part the need to collect they need to have a nice pinball

[40:54] machine when you enter collections usually collectors want to have some rare games they want to have

[40:59] things that others don't have because that's part of the thrill like I want to find that rare

[41:04] transformer toy like the the variant addition I want to find that boba fett that only three of them

[41:10] had the ejecting spring sort of backpacks all that stuff right that's what drives collectors you

[41:17] know I want to collect magic girl because there's only 25 but at the end of the day I think what

[41:23] happens with collectors is you do you hit a wall you hit a wall and you you look at your collection

[41:29] and you realize man I haven't really turned these things on man I don't really want these things

[41:33] to break I'm so tired of maintaining them I don't get a thrill in repairing them man there's all

[41:38] these new games out that I also want to collect and now I can't financially do that unless I get rid

[41:44] of these things but another part of collecting that sucks is a lot of collectors become hoarders

[41:50] and they really have an emotional problem letting go of something letting go of that elite because

[41:56] what if I want it back and so the items that you collect start to take control of your life and

[42:02] you start to become a slave to them and again all these emotions and all these feelings that you

[42:09] get they're not fun they're not fun and my advice is this really sometimes you have to just say

[42:17] you know what I'm done I'm done with these things it no longer brings me the joy at once did

[42:23] I'd rather someone else have it and it wasn't easy for me to sell off my transformers it wasn't easy

[42:30] for me to get rid of some of my other stuff that I had collected but at the end of the day I'm really

[42:34] happy I did because you'll notice the less you have in life the less you collect the less you sort

[42:40] of hoard and the less you the less possessions and material things you have to maintain the happier you

[42:47] will be the happier you will be there is some guy in America with one pinball machine that he bangs

[42:53] on every day and he spent 500 bucks on it and he's got a smile from ear to ear he's got a refrigerator

[42:59] full of bud light he watches sports on the weekends and he takes his wife out for nice dinners every

[43:04] once in a while and he's happy as a pig and shit and then there's the guy who's got 150 pinball

[43:10] machines who's constantly fixing them constantly on pin side constantly trying to like keep up with

[43:15] everything going on and he's he's never getting to where he wants to go because he there is no no

[43:21] goal for him and you know that's the thing is you got to find the balance that works for you now

[43:25] I have a lot of friends with a lot of money you have a lot of machines and and I don't think they're

[43:28] obsessed with it because I think for those guys they have the balance they've also got like a car

[43:35] collection and then you got pinball and they've got a watch collection they got a cigar collection

[43:39] they've got other things I've got you know like my friend Ted's got he collects movie posters he

[43:44] collects cigars he collects watches like he's into other things you know so with pinball if Ted

[43:49] gets rid of all his pinball machines he's not suffering but I think if you took away like

[43:54] wise nose pinball machines I think you'd have a seizure and have a heart attack so

[44:00] look why do people get out of the hobby it's a question we all ask ourselves let me give you my

[44:04] reasons why I would get out of pinball I have eight reasons and then I have two reasons why I would

[44:09] stay in pinball okay so this is canators top eight reasons why I would leave pinball it's expensive

[44:16] okay at the end of the day I look at these 10k machines and nine k machines and 23,000

[44:22] dollar magic roll machines and I just really think these things are getting way overpriced

[44:27] for the amount of entertainment they provide and especially if I look at how much fun arcade games

[44:32] are and video games in my home it's really hard for me to justify how mario kart for 60 bucks can

[44:40] be more fun than Star Wars pinball but the reality is that it is and I'd play way more mario kart

[44:46] than I would Star Wars pinball and so why would I go spend eighty five hundred dollars when I can

[44:51] spend sixty bucks okay I can put that eighty five hundred dollars in the stock market and yes

[44:56] I'm a 40 year old adult I like making money with my money I don't and I am making money with my

[45:02] money but my financial advisor would tell me Chris every 10 grand you put in matters and she's right

[45:08] she's absolutely right number two I can play on location I am lucky enough to live in New York City

[45:13] there are locations all over New York City where I can play pinball all the hot games you can think of

[45:19] look I can play Star Wars Pro before most of American can play because it's here first because we

[45:23] got guys like ow who's got uh who who gets the games first we got uh guys like john at jack bar

[45:30] get the games first you know sunshine Peter over there gets the games first so New York City is a

[45:37] pinball mecca and I'm happy that I can ride my bike and play these games for 10 bucks number three

[45:41] time consuming you get sucked in the amount of time people spend in this hobby it's it's a lot

[45:48] every morning I wake up I do podcasts like this for your entertainment I could be reading the Wall

[45:52] Street Journal in the New York Times which would probably make me smarter which would probably

[45:57] give me more ideas for work which would probably make me more successful at work which would probably

[46:03] make me more money you see I'm saying this doesn't give me any return um compared to other things

[46:11] but I enjoy it that's why I do it but it's a lot of freaking time a lot of freaking time number four

[46:18] you talk about pinball more than you play all right that's a real reason why I think people get out

[46:23] of a lot of hobbies is they wake up one day and they realize all they do the only reason they're

[46:29] in it and what they they're sort of what their world has evolved into is they're just on the

[46:35] forums all day long and they talk about pinball and they rarely turn their games on and then you

[46:39] wake up one day and you realize that that can be very shallow and unfulfilling and ultimately

[46:45] who gives a fuck with 50 hyper users on pin sight think about you who gives a fuck about their

[46:52] opinions and who cares get out in the real world and go into any bar and try to spark up a

[46:59] conversation about pinball and look at people be like what the fuck are you talking about mate

[47:04] like grow up right nobody really cares except for a small handful of people all right number five

[47:11] move I would move on to other hobbies once you get you know look hobbies are hobbies and like you

[47:16] can easily once you find a new set of interests you can move in that direction like right now I've

[47:21] been spending a lot more time on the hellcat and demon forms thank you whoever keeps bookmarking

[47:25] my podcast whenever I say that but I'm more excited to hear what people are saying about the demon

[47:30] coming out than I am about people speculating what the next turn is and that's just I'm looking

[47:36] for videos I'm looking for media reviews of the car and also with cars there's way more car

[47:42] enthusiasts and car collectors out there than pinball people so I it's also gets me out of the house

[47:47] like every Sunday morning I can go to cars and coffee and drive and go hang out with car enthusiasts

[47:53] to me that's much more social and much more rewarding than walking into jack bar on a beautiful

[47:58] Saturday and there's crazy levy on a beautiful sunny day in a dark bar playing pinball you know

[48:05] part of me I can't escape the fact that pinball does force people to spend time indoors and I kind

[48:14] of like hobbies that also get me outdoors especially when it's the summertime and number six you

[48:20] no longer feel connection to others in the hobby I call this the Star Wars effect but I mean by

[48:25] that is sometimes I feel when I read people and I and this is the reason I call this a Star Wars

[48:32] effect when I saw how many people were just defending Star Wars arbitrarily and saying how great of a

[48:38] game it was and how great this is and how great Stern is and I saw I'm just like I don't fucking

[48:45] want to be a part of a hobby anymore where people accept this as as pinball where people standards

[48:52] of what a pinball machine could be is this freaking low now where Star Wars pro is people are saying

[49:00] is one of the best turns of all time I that makes me want to leave the hobby because I'm I just feel

[49:06] like I don't want to be associated with a hobby that's filled with so many people who have such

[49:11] low expectations and who aren't dreamers who don't even understand what magic is that wouldn't

[49:16] even recognize magic now the reason I don't leave the hobby because I know the majority of you

[49:20] out there the majority of you out there aren't satisfied with Star Wars the majority of you out there

[49:26] are always on the sidelines and have common sense and understand what a good pinball machine can be

[49:33] you do understand what value Williams used to bring out for the money and you do look at these

[49:38] new games like they are cheap games that are cutting corners that aren't bringing pinball magic back

[49:43] and the reason I know that the reason I know that is because alien Ellie never sold out that theme

[49:49] is a juggernaut it never sold out because the majority of you out there wasn't just Andrew

[49:53] highways like inadequacies you looked at the game and you don't want it you didn't see magic and you

[49:58] did it they couldn't even sell 500 so I know the majority of you out there agree with me on Star Wars

[50:04] I know you do I know you do and some of the few minority that will try and justify it

[50:09] the they're you know time will say which one was right all right number seven kind of that point

[50:18] the games aren't magical one reason I would want to get out of this hobby is if the games lose

[50:24] their magic I cover pinball news I cover new games coming out if the games coming out just don't

[50:29] excite me aren't interesting to me do you think I want to fill this airspace talking about things

[50:34] that just fundamentally bore me no so if the games lose their magic I lose my ability to be

[50:40] interested in them I lose my ability to read the threads you know it's like it's like for example

[50:45] rob zombie it's not a magical game I I really it would take a gun to my head to force me to open

[50:52] up the rob zombie thread and read what's going on in the rob zombie thread I actually did did I

[50:56] because I was like is there anything happening new it's the same thing every every week they're

[50:59] updating the code it's not going to change that the game's not magical nothing the code can do

[51:03] will make the game a magical game if the games lose their magic I'm not interested if games just

[51:08] become remakes of old games I'm not interested all right number eight you've lost money or you know

[51:16] people that have and I think this is probably for a lot of people one of the main reasons why a lot

[51:21] of people freak recently have gotten out is they got burned they got burned because they lost

[51:27] money in La Bousske on J-Pop they might have got burned because they lost money on Kevin you know

[51:33] they might have lost money on other ventures or they might have waited two years for Hobbit and

[51:37] it's got burned by the way I think for me this is the one that really pushes people over the edge

[51:45] the quickest when you lose money when I when I when I paid for magic girl without knowing it was

[51:51] definitely coming out if I had lost twenty three thousand dollars in in that venture I mean I told

[51:57] Brendan every night I'm out I'm done I need something if I don't get anything out of this I'm done

[52:01] all right my reason to stay I have two reasons the first reason is something that my executive

[52:09] crater director told me when I was walking down the street and I was telling him I do a pinball

[52:14] podcast and he kind of looked at me is like wait you have a pinball podcast like I never knew that

[52:17] about you I'm like yeah I explained him like been really in a pinball I got booty from the forums

[52:23] robin over there the moderator just won't let me back on but I still love it so I decided to

[52:27] create my own podcast people actually enjoy it it's a lot of fun I do about three a week I get

[52:32] almost like a thousand lists or listens per episode and he was like wow and he said you know Chris

[52:38] he told me one thing he said he said this to me the happiest people in life know a lot and get

[52:44] excited by stuff that is utterly trivial but to them means the world and that's such a powerful

[52:53] statement that I'm happy because I feel like I know a lot about something that's fun like I'm an

[53:00] expert on pinball and for those of you who think I'm not a pinball expert yes I'm not an expert on

[53:06] pinball history but I am an expert on what's currently going on in the pinball world I know everything

[53:13] that's going on in this hobby for the most part I know stuff that's going on I know games that are

[53:17] being worked on that you don't even know exist how's that try that out and for size I know of two

[53:24] games that are coming out that you don't even know exist all right so and then he you know I also

[53:29] would say life would be emptier for me without pinball and the pinball people I know and that's the

[53:36] most important thing to me is I've met a lot of awesome people you guys are great I love talking

[53:41] you guys on Facebook all the time I love hearing your emails I love that you listen that there's

[53:46] a thousand people that listen to this show every episode I don't know who all of you are half of

[53:51] you probably hate me and are just listening to see if I talk shit about you but um at the end of

[53:56] the day I think my life would be a little bit emptier if I removed pinball from it and it's harmless

[54:01] out of all things I could talk about out of all the things I could focus on as a distraction from

[54:07] the serious parts of life I think pinball is a fun thing to get into I really do because it's

[54:14] unique too if you go if you're at a party a cocktail party like oh I you know I like the Yankees

[54:20] like so white so do millions of people but if you tell people you know what like I restore pinball

[54:25] games or I have a pinball podcast or I run a pinball bar you immediately in my mind are at the

[54:31] top of the most interesting person in the room list now when I go to pinball Xbox shows you're

[54:37] probably also the worst dress person at that event as well guys dress better I get him back

[54:43] and forth with rare here all the time because I'm also into fashion and he's like that's stupid I'm

[54:48] like you don't get it looking good and feeling good is is important to me and I get it pinball people

[54:53] want to look really comfortable but you know out to what expense you know I mean I'm working in

[54:59] in I'm working in your city I don't want to look like a slob going in a nice restaurant all right

[55:03] all right and the number two reason the number two reason why canada needs to stay in the pinball hobby

[55:09] is simple somebody has to finish raza and it will be me you heard it here I will get you your

[55:17] razzas if if it's the last thing I do all right a couple more things and then we're gonna end this

[55:20] episode it's going a little long I got to get to work um total nuclear annihilation

[55:26] Scott uploaded about a minute sound clip of one of the new reactor mode audio files to sound cloud

[55:34] really cool um if you're not friends with Scott denny see on facebook you should be uh he's cool

[55:40] guy check it out game sounds great we look forward to seeing that game it's coming up right I mean

[55:45] next month we're gonna see Alice Cooper and then after that we're gonna get total nuclear annihilation

[55:49] big Lebowski that thread is just like take your penis take a pair of scissors and cut it off and

[55:57] eat it game of thrown style edg shireen and game of thrones how stupid was that I love the fact that

[56:03] fans made him quit twitter I love it I love fan bases then drive celebrities to run run away like

[56:09] babies anyway the big Lebowski owners are finally realizing the difficulties with the new contract

[56:15] manufacturer and what is finally um coming to coming to their attention is the difficulties

[56:23] of manufacturing parts and switching from one contract manufacturer to another and what that

[56:28] means for the parts availability for people who bought the air a game what that means for the parts

[56:34] that a array development designed in house and how will those be transferable to the new contract

[56:40] manufacturer I think it's a great question I don't have the answer nobody knows what really

[56:45] is going on over there nobody knows the realistic sort of chances of of this thing succeeding I would

[56:52] get my money out but you can't if for those of you who paid in full your stock your stock on this

[56:58] train to these guys either figure it out or finally go belly up but the bottom line is what a shitshow

[57:06] what a total and utter shitshow I think touch pinball is done after this if they can even figure

[57:14] this out how are they gonna how is this company gonna turn it around and make you feel confident

[57:19] going forward there's no way there's no way um and I I I'm almost want to put a stake in the

[57:26] ground right now okay canada's gonna do this so I used to make these bets remember when I make

[57:30] the bets with highway pinball I'm gonna make this bet you will not see the big Lebowski by the

[57:38] new contract manufacturer in October they will not show you a the first zero series production

[57:45] game or pre-production game you're it's not gonna happen it is not gonna happen if it happens here's

[57:50] what'll happen if they come out with it canada will I will wear a Dutch pinball outfit to

[58:00] expo 2017 all right if they can if they can bring it there I will come head to toe head to toe I'll

[58:06] make something like pants suit maybe a whole Dutch pinball suit and I'll wear it to expo 2017 that's

[58:12] my bet all right okay let's see what else real quick um alien pinball not much going on there the

[58:20] they're shipping people the alien head mechanism did you guys see that meck it looks like a total

[58:25] piece of shit here's the thing here's the thing that I I can talk about finally now that it's

[58:31] all gone belly up I want people to realize one thing this has always been my thought all along I'm

[58:35] not sure if I shared this do you all realize that Andrew highway had more money in his pocket when

[58:43] he developed and made full throttle then he did when he developed and made alien which is why

[58:50] I think alien is up there with Star Wars in one of the worst ways to create a pinball machine

[58:58] based on a theme that the alien world does not come to life physically in that game at all and

[59:03] it's because Andrew didn't have much money everything was was done on a shoestring budget and

[59:09] you know look everything relies on LCD screens talk about like every single scene from the alien

[59:15] movie everything but the Xeno head is is it is a screen is is using screens to show you the scene

[59:24] or the moment or the vehicle or the characters it's all using screens also the fact that he didn't

[59:29] get Sigourney Weaver I guarantee you that that was all about money he didn't have money to secure

[59:35] her he couldn't afford it and that's what that was and so making alien without Sigourney Weaver

[59:42] is still the dumbest decision ever it's still hugely disappointing the fact that people are still

[59:48] saying oh it doesn't really matter you play as Ripley no you don't you don't play as Ripley

[59:52] you don't it's it the game is such a mediocre version of that theme it's not even funny

[01:00:00] and whatever these guys are doing all this effort to bring it out but again I think the game is

[01:00:04] slow I think it's a wide body I think it's a terrible interpretation of the alien universe

[01:00:11] and I think missing the main character is also laughable and so I don't think this game is like

[01:00:17] needs to be resurrected if you were to ask me the big Lebowski's the game that really needs to come

[01:00:23] out because it really is an amazing game it really is a great interpretation of the film it really

[01:00:28] does have magic in it I don't get any of that from alien but for you alien guys at least you have

[01:00:33] a chance at getting something because canada was right and you were all gonna lose your money

[01:00:36] you all were gonna lose your money and I can't believe that wise snow and hilton is still on

[01:00:42] there you still let that guy into your home after he convinced you guys that nothing was wrong with

[01:00:46] highway pinball last point of the day is a few four sale items hey if you guys want a white

[01:00:52] water how's one for 95 hundred dollars sound how about a tron ellie on pin side for 11,500

[01:01:01] it's not even new in box the guy claims he took it out of the box but never played it

[01:01:06] what who the fuck would do that let me take it out of box never play it and then sell it to you

[01:01:13] as if it's new in box real smart ghost buster's ellie for sale for $7,500 but here's the problem

[01:01:20] it doesn't have a new playfield but the guy says he's only played it two hundred times and there's

[01:01:24] only light ghosting on one of the inserts yet but here's the problem jerky if you've only

[01:01:30] played it two hundred times the bad ghosting hasn't shown up yet and if the bad ghosting hasn't

[01:01:36] shown up yet who the hell wants to buy this and then have to go through the ordeal of swapping

[01:01:41] playfields from stern if you have a ghost buster's ellie regardless of the condition I would like

[01:01:47] take a hammer to get a new playfield because the only ones people are ever gonna want and the

[01:01:51] ghost buster's ellie used market world are ones with replacement playfields that's the bottom line

[01:01:57] no one's gonna want one that hasn't had it replaced no one's gonna no one's gonna trust that there's

[01:02:01] isn't a ticking time bomb and finally there's a tales of the rebe and nights for $8,600 way too

[01:02:07] much for a game that doesn't have fully brass played it everything look at the game it's got

[01:02:12] stated cabinet artwork for $8,600 get out of here then I'll sell mine for $12,000 anyway we

[01:02:19] hit an hour wow just me talking guys I got to run out of a 10 o'clock meeting I'm presenting

[01:02:23] it I'm not even ready love you guys we'll talk to you soon that was episode 144 of
