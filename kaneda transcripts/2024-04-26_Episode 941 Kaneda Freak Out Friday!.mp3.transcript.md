[00:00] Welcome, everybody, happy Friday, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] I know I wasn't able to get a show up on Wednesday because work has been super busy also by the

[00:28] baby is due May 4th, so any minute, any hour, any second, this baby number two for Canada

[00:35] could drop into this world.

[00:36] I'm super excited, but I'm not going to stop doing this pinball podcast, so get ready.

[00:41] And I bet Stern Pinball has delayed the release of John Wick just to interrupt with the delivery

[00:48] of Canada's second child.

[00:50] I'm super excited for John Wick.

[00:52] I'm just going to hit you guys right now because you didn't have a Wednesday show.

[00:56] I'm going to hit you with some confirmation news.

[00:58] It is absolutely going to be John Wick.

[01:01] And I'm hearing now 100% that it is a brand new designer making this game.

[01:06] It is not Tim Sexton.

[01:08] He is doing the code, but the designer of this game.

[01:11] This will be the first pinball machine he's ever made.

[01:15] So I also know the gender of the designer.

[01:18] It's a man's world in the world of pinball design.

[01:22] Who's it going to be over at Stern Pinball?

[01:24] I don't even know how to guess who it might be.

[01:27] I was trying to look to see maybe it's someone who worked on the design team with Foo Fighters.

[01:31] I don't know where to find that list, but you've been hearing it here first from Canada's

[01:35] Pinball podcast that John Wick is going to be designed by a brand new gentleman over

[01:42] at Stern Pinball.

[01:43] And we've all been waiting for this game.

[01:46] And I think we're going to see this game within the next two to three weeks.

[01:49] I think the teaser for this game actually might come out next week.

[01:53] So that is super exciting.

[01:54] Stern just released this damn game.

[01:57] We've all been waiting for this game.

[01:58] And what excites me about a brand new designer is this.

[02:02] We're going to get a new point of view from a new individual on what makes pinball fun.

[02:08] This is what we need more of in pinball.

[02:10] I'd rather have new designers than tribute games designed somewhat by Berio.

[02:17] I'd rather have new designers than Dennis Nordman, Whitewater 2, or Galactic Tank Force.

[02:25] I'd rather see what new young designers want to bring to the world of pinball.

[02:30] Because what's exciting about a new designer versus an old designer is simply this.

[02:34] When you're new and you want to make a name for yourself, you're going to work harder.

[02:39] You're going to work longer hours.

[02:41] You need to establish your legacy.

[02:44] When you're an old designer like Pat Lawler was with Jersey Jack, did he do anything new?

[02:50] Did he bring any innovation whatsoever to all of his games at Jersey Jack?

[02:54] He didn't do anything new.

[02:55] And his older games are still better than his newer games.

[02:59] And that's that.

[03:00] So I'd rather have someone who's trying to make a name for themselves and become the

[03:04] new greatest pinball designer in the world.

[03:07] I mean, think about it right now.

[03:08] Imagine a world in which Stern Pinball didn't even get Keith Elwin onto its roster.

[03:14] And every game was still just George Gomez, John Borg, and Steve Ritchie.

[03:18] Would we get new and exciting pinball machines?

[03:21] As great as Elton John is as a game, it's not a brand new design by Steve Ritchie.

[03:26] There's not a lot of innovative stuff happening in that game.

[03:30] If you've owned all of Steve Ritchie's games and you walk up to an Elton John, you're not

[03:34] seeing some radically new way to create pinball.

[03:38] Sure, it's fun.

[03:39] Sure, it's fun.

[03:40] But I'm going to use a metaphor.

[03:41] Like, imagine building an amazing roller coaster, right?

[03:44] This incredible roller coaster that everybody in the world loves.

[03:48] And you build it at Disney World, right?

[03:50] That's Steve Ritchie making his games over at Stern.

[03:53] And then you build the same exact roller coaster over at a newer, nicer theme park.

[03:58] And that's Elton John at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[04:01] It's the same ride.

[04:02] It's just maybe got nicer lights.

[04:05] It's got nicer seats.

[04:06] It's maybe got more interesting things you see along the ride.

[04:10] But the track itself, the pathway of the ball, it's been done many, many, many, many times

[04:15] over again.

[04:16] And what people love about Foo Fighters with Jack Danger's first game, it feels fresh.

[04:20] It feels new.

[04:21] And that's why people love the game.

[04:23] Same thing with all the Keith Elwin machines.

[04:25] It's like it just feels fresh.

[04:26] It feels new and it gets everybody very excited.

[04:29] Now look, nobody loves the price of these new games.

[04:32] Will a new designer be able to sell you 1,000 units of John Wick at $13,000 a pop?

[04:40] I don't think Stern's going to sell those games out immediately.

[04:43] But there is going to be a lot of excitement for a new designer.

[04:47] When they roll this game out, here's what I hope Stern does.

[04:50] First and foremost, I don't know who this guy is, but I hope he's got some charisma.

[04:55] Because when you show a game to the world for the first time ever and you're brand new to

[04:58] the pinball space, I do think marketing matters.

[05:02] I do think you're going to need to get people excited.

[05:04] It's like every time they release a game and Dwight is on code, how boring is it watching

[05:09] that guy for 20 minutes, spoil everything in the game, take the glass off, and just mumble

[05:15] through 20 minutes of complex code.

[05:17] It doesn't get anybody excited.

[05:19] So I hope whoever is designing this game first and foremost designs an amazing game.

[05:24] Secondarily, has some charisma and excitement and has some personality.

[05:29] And I know that doesn't really matter.

[05:31] It's like Keith Owen doesn't really have that charisma.

[05:34] He's very soft spoken and no one really cares, right?

[05:36] Because he designed some of the best pinball machines out there.

[05:39] All right, so new designer, John Wick coming out any day now.

[05:42] All right, what else is going on?

[05:43] A lot's going on in the Stern world, people.

[05:46] New code for James Bond has just dropped.

[05:48] It's at 1.0.

[05:50] That doesn't mean the game is done, but it does mean that the rule sets are in place.

[05:54] I think that's what 1.0 means.

[05:56] And just reading the feedback on 1.0 code, they've added a wizard mode.

[06:01] Her Majesty's like Secret Service or something like that.

[06:04] And it's funny about these final wizard modes.

[06:06] When I was reading what you need to do to get to that final wizard mode,

[06:11] I was like, man, no one's going to get here.

[06:14] Like 99% of you are never going to get to this mode.

[06:17] And then what Stern's going to do is they're going to be like, well,

[06:20] you got to buy a topper and that's your shortcut to getting to the final wizard mode.

[06:25] And for many of us out there who are never going to be good enough to lining up all those things

[06:30] and getting through all those modes, all you got to do,

[06:34] you never have to buy a topper or some DLC to get to the final wizard mode.

[06:40] All you got to do is take the glass of the machine off

[06:44] and then stretch your fingers and just start hitting all the switches to get through the game.

[06:50] And then you can get to the final wizard mode with the glass off.

[06:54] And then you can experience it for free.

[06:55] I did that with Lord of the Rings.

[06:57] I was never going to get to like Valinor, whatever the heck the thing is at the end.

[07:01] But I did it with the glass off and I don't care.

[07:04] I had fun cheating on my own pinball machine.

[07:07] So James Bond 1.0.

[07:09] The other thing after reading all the feedback, I still think a lot of you out there,

[07:13] you do like the game, you're happy where this game is at,

[07:16] but you just want a lot more clips and you want a lot more callouts because that's the thing.

[07:21] It's like a lot of times they'll drop these code updates

[07:24] and there's like balancing of score and there's fixing a lot of the issues

[07:28] or they're finally turning on inserts that don't do anything

[07:32] or they're giving features to the lock bar button.

[07:35] But what you really want is you want more of the theme you love in the game.

[07:40] And you also want to see that as you're playing the game.

[07:44] It's like when Foo Fighters dropped code 1.0,

[07:47] it drastically changed the game with all the callouts.

[07:50] It felt like an all new game.

[07:52] And I think what I'm sensing with the James Bond code

[07:55] is a lot of people waited six months and they installed the code

[07:59] and they were expecting a radically awesome new way to play James Bond

[08:04] and all this new stuff was going to come at them.

[08:07] And I just don't think they're feeling that.

[08:09] We also got new code for Jaws Pinball the other day,

[08:13] which is really great and I'm hearing in that thread

[08:15] there's a lot more clips and callouts and stuff happening in that game.

[08:19] So Jaws continues to come along very nicely.

[08:22] I have heard from people who work over at Stern in the coding department,

[08:26] it's a really tough job.

[08:28] It really is.

[08:29] There's so much pressure to get these games coded after they're released.

[08:34] But I will say Stern has done a really good job recently

[08:38] of not making people wait years to get to a final code update.

[08:42] It's not like Guns N' Roses where it's been over three years

[08:47] and even the way Jersey Jack releases code, I don't like it.

[08:51] Like Stern officially releases a code, puts a number to it

[08:55] and that number does indicate how far they have to go

[08:59] to get to somewhat of a code complete game.

[09:02] Jersey Jack doesn't do that.

[09:03] It's like all these weird like beta drops of code.

[09:07] I don't even know what number it's on.

[09:09] I don't even know what number signifies it's going to be done.

[09:12] And they promised this major code update for Guns N' Roses by Q2 of 2024,

[09:18] which would be by June of this year.

[09:21] But there's no real release date and all these beta things are trickling out.

[09:26] It's just a little confusing, but I will say this.

[09:29] I've been reading really positive things about the Guns N' Roses code

[09:33] and I think people are enjoying the game much more

[09:36] now that they've sort of addressed a lot of the issues and complaints on that game.

[09:41] Now look, it's a little day late and a dollar short for a lot of G&R owners

[09:47] that have been waiting this many years.

[09:49] I mean, there really is no excuse why Jersey Jack took their best selling

[09:54] pinball machine of all time.

[09:55] It's Guns N' Roses.

[09:56] This game has sold more than Wizard of Oz and any other game they've made.

[10:00] They had the most amount of people excited about their product

[10:04] and they did nothing on the code for three years.

[10:07] Through all the complaining and all the this and all the that,

[10:10] it makes absolutely no sense.

[10:12] And think about all the coding resources they put towards two games

[10:16] that nobody wanted, Toy Story 4 and to Godfather, right?

[10:21] And they really should have done a better job of making sure G&R

[10:24] was exactly where it needed to be within a year of that game coming out.

[10:29] So shame on you Jersey Jack.

[10:31] I'm happy that you're finally doing it.

[10:33] I mean, it's just so funny to me that I haven't even unboxed my Guns N' Roses

[10:37] and by the time I unboxed it, it'll be almost four years since I bought it

[10:41] and the code is still not complete.

[10:43] It shouldn't be that way.

[10:44] It just should never be that way.

[10:46] So we've got that happening over at Stern Pimball.

[10:49] The reason why code is so important in Pimball is we really want a game

[10:53] to have great coding.

[10:54] It's what keeps you coming back.

[10:56] It's what creates that replay value.

[10:58] The code is what creates those Pimball moments.

[11:01] It is because think about it.

[11:02] If you don't have code in a Pimball machine and you just have a white wood,

[11:06] even if it's lighting up left and right, there's no moments.

[11:09] It's the combination of the design with the code that creates the Pimball moments

[11:14] that we love so much about Pimball.

[11:17] And that's why code is so important.

[11:20] You know, it's funny to me is over in the land of CGC.

[11:23] All these guys that bought Cactus Canyon Remake, right?

[11:26] They bought that game thinking Lyman Sheets was going to make that game

[11:30] his next masterpiece.

[11:32] Unfortunately, he's no longer with us.

[11:35] But how many years ago was that?

[11:37] How many years ago has this game been out?

[11:40] And they haven't done anything to improve the code on Cactus Canyon Remake.

[11:44] And what's getting funny really now in the thread is that these owners are like,

[11:48] well, it's not the code that's the problem.

[11:51] It's that the game is too easy.

[11:53] Let me read you something that someone wrote on Pinside.

[11:56] This is from Pimball in Reno.

[11:58] He writes, he said that you have to open up the out lanes at least 65%

[12:03] in Cactus Canyon to make it more fun.

[12:05] This makes the game fun, enjoyable, with good ball times for multiplayer games.

[12:12] The mission is to have fun.

[12:14] And once in a while, get on a roll to blow up the score.

[12:18] And once in a great while, get to high noon.

[12:21] The game is amazing, witty, sarcastic with great William style humor.

[12:26] People who say it's too easy don't know how to set up a game.

[12:31] If you are getting to high noon on ball one, remove the out lane posts.

[12:36] My game is brutal, yet balanced, tons of fun.

[12:41] I mean, really?

[12:42] Is this where we're at?

[12:43] You got to remove the out lane posts, make the game harder,

[12:47] and then it becomes more fun?

[12:49] I don't know.

[12:50] Some people might subscribe to that.

[12:52] I don't.

[12:53] I think Pimball is hard enough.

[12:55] When I went over to Jack Barr and John raised the out lane posts on Pulp Fiction,

[13:00] I don't know why.

[13:01] It's silly.

[13:02] You have to keep nudging the game left and right.

[13:04] And he's like, improve your pinball skills.

[13:07] And I'm like, why do I need to improve my pinball skills?

[13:09] Why don't you not make the game harder than it came from the factory?

[13:13] I don't understand why people want to play pinball and just be nudging all day long

[13:16] to keep it out of the out lanes.

[13:18] Does that make it more fun?

[13:19] I don't know.

[13:19] Maybe some of you love that.

[13:21] Some of you love throwing the machines around, and that's where you get enjoyment.

[13:24] But I think the best pinball machines out there have that right balance,

[13:28] where the balltimes are not super long, and you don't have to adjust the post to have fun.

[13:34] Like, I had a lot of fun playing Jaws, and I don't think you need to make the game harder.

[13:38] I had a lot of fun playing Elton John.

[13:40] You don't have to make the game harder.

[13:42] And when I was playing Pulp Fiction, I just felt like there were a lot of cheap drains,

[13:46] and that made the game not fun.

[13:48] You know, there's certain games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[13:50] This is another example of a game where you just get all these cheap drains on the left out lane side,

[13:56] same with the Wizard of Oz, and it makes it not fun.

[13:59] And I think that's bad design.

[14:01] And the pinball machines that people love the most, they can be hard, but there shouldn't be anything cheap.

[14:05] Everybody hates cheap drains in pinball.

[14:08] It's just not what we want.

[14:10] So do I have to talk about this home pin version of the Blues Brothers?

[14:14] I mean, it's absolutely atrocious.

[14:17] The art package is terrible.

[14:19] The layout is horrendous.

[14:21] This is going to be the first and last open source pinball machine ever.

[14:26] Mike over at Home Pin, it's an absolute tragedy.

[14:29] Everything he's putting into these pinball machines.

[14:31] I think Spinal Tap now has a third flipper installed in the game.

[14:36] Has anyone even got a Spinal Tap machine?

[14:39] And now he's announcing this.

[14:41] This company makes no sense.

[14:43] Nobody wants to hear me talk about home pin.

[14:46] Stick a fork in these guys.

[14:48] They're done.

[14:49] Now, speaking of companies to stick a fork in,

[14:51] let's talk quickly about Haggis Pinball and American Pinball.

[14:54] I was reading Pinside and someone over in Australia said the following.

[14:59] He said, I live in Melbourne, Australia, and I know a Haggis employee,

[15:04] recently ex-employee.

[15:06] All I can say is you won't be seeing any more games produced.

[15:11] Wow.

[15:12] Now, this is coming from Adam Sebas in Melbourne, Australia.

[15:16] Now, look, I'm not sure if this is true or not.

[15:18] I'm just reading what a guy is saying.

[15:21] Now, do you believe that they're done?

[15:23] I mean, look, we all know the writing is on the wall.

[15:27] There is no way they're going to recapitalize and get enough money

[15:30] to keep this ship in the ocean.

[15:32] And now that fathoms are selling for $7,000 and they're easy to get,

[15:38] and they're losing money, and they're so expensive for Damien to make,

[15:43] nobody's going to go in on this $17,000 or oblivion addition.

[15:48] And now it's probably going to be a dark cloud going over those distributors.

[15:53] I think it was Nitro and Flippin' Out.

[15:55] They've got those deposits on these Centaur games.

[15:59] And the more and more time goes on where there's no remarks from Damien,

[16:04] it's going to come down to a point where, at what point do people deserve a refund?

[16:09] I mean, you got to remember the timeframe, people.

[16:12] You got to remember the timeframe.

[16:14] And I'm going to remind everybody what was said to these people when they gave

[16:17] deposits on these oblivion additions.

[16:20] Let me read this to you.

[16:21] And this is from a guy who ordered these games from Damien,

[16:25] and he's not a frequent poster on Pinside.

[16:27] But this really just gets right at the heart of why what they're doing is

[16:32] terrible and why Damien and Marty should be ashamed of themselves,

[16:37] that they've taken people on this journey.

[16:40] You know how I feel about both of them?

[16:41] I think they're weaseling their way out of all of this by not communicating every

[16:45] week with these paying customers.

[16:47] And yeah, Marty, you're in it with Damien.

[16:50] And yeah, you have a podcast.

[16:51] And yeah, you never talk about it.

[16:53] And then you tell people, like, oh, Damien's the official spokesperson of Haggis

[16:57] Pimbal, not me.

[16:58] Marty, we know those are your shoes in the corner.

[17:00] Step out from behind the curtain, brother.

[17:02] Man up and give people a response.

[17:05] And it's not funny that you go on the airwaves and you're ignoring your very

[17:08] own customers.

[17:09] It's absolutely pathetic.

[17:11] All right, so this guy writes, well, imagine being a season ticket holder and

[17:15] paid in fall for not one but two fathoms.

[17:18] And I ordered a Centaur revisited or oblivion.

[17:21] Okay, so right away, this guy is in on a lot of money.

[17:25] Receive the request for payment and finally make the payment on 126 only to

[17:31] receive their email on 216, like everyone else regarding the problems and delays.

[17:38] It royally sucks, but it's my fault for proceeding.

[17:42] I've only made a few posts in all the years I've been on here, but felt this one

[17:47] deserved a real story and a person associated with it.

[17:51] I just want to say this.

[17:52] It is not your fault.

[17:54] This whole victim blaming of people that have been abused, they've been abused,

[17:59] manipulated, and let's just use the word they were lied to.

[18:03] So when Damian and Marty took your money on that 126 date,

[18:09] they were lying to you that the business was doing well.

[18:12] They were lying to you that you were gonna get your game in just a few weeks.

[18:16] They were lying to you the entire time.

[18:19] Because the entire time they knew that that 216 email was gonna go out.

[18:24] They knew they were up SHIT Creek with money issues.

[18:28] They've lied to us and we need to stop this false narrative that they're good

[18:34] guys that are just trying to figure it out and making pinball this hard.

[18:38] And we understand all that.

[18:40] But the moment they decided to shield this Centaur or

[18:43] oblivion edition, the moment they got all these content creators to shield the game,

[18:47] the moment distributors were trying to give you confidence on sending more money

[18:51] to haggis pinball after they've lied to us year after year after year.

[18:56] We're gonna finish the games by the end of the year.

[18:58] All of it has been lies people.

[19:00] When they've been telling people it's gonna be eight weeks until you get your game.

[19:03] If you pay me in fall and then you pay in fall and nine months go by.

[19:07] And then there's a dude in Europe who's got like eight or something fathoms and

[19:10] now he has to sue them and get a lawyer.

[19:13] It's all been lies when that duck pinball guy went over there.

[19:17] And he was all excited to make games with Damien.

[19:20] And then what happened?

[19:21] He's no longer with the company.

[19:22] They don't mention anything.

[19:24] They've gone radio silent.

[19:25] They are lying to everybody.

[19:27] If they don't wanna lie to us then tell us the truth Damien and Marty.

[19:30] You don't get to hide like this.

[19:32] You don't get to take hundreds of thousands of dollars from this community.

[19:36] And no other pinball podcaster wants to call you out.

[19:38] You don't get to go on your show Marty and hide your sneakers in the corner Marty.

[19:43] You gotta come out man up.

[19:44] These are people's hard earned money.

[19:46] These are people with children, people with mortgages, people with things to pay.

[19:50] People they'd rather spend this money on and you took their money and you misled them.

[19:54] You are a bunch of liars.

[19:57] And if I ever see you at a show, I'll tell you that to your face because this is lying.

[20:01] When my boss asked me Chris when am I gonna get these ideas and

[20:04] I say you're gonna get these ideas in eight days and then I don't give them those ideas for eight weeks.

[20:09] You think I still have a job?

[20:11] Why are you guys doing this?

[20:13] Why are you still misleading people?

[20:14] I know it's tough.

[20:16] I know you're waking up and you're sweating it out.

[20:18] I know you have children.

[20:19] I know you have families.

[20:21] I know you probably have family members that invested in Haggis Pinball.

[20:24] But at some point the lying's gotta stop.

[20:27] And if you need more money, don't come to us.

[20:29] Don't come to the community, the content creators, the distributors and

[20:32] fill all of us with your lies.

[20:34] If you need more money, go to a bank.

[20:37] Raise capital like a grown adult.

[20:39] And I'm so tired of this.

[20:40] It's 2024.

[20:41] Haggis, you're done.

[20:42] You're done.

[20:43] And the next company that might be done is American Pinball.

[20:46] So let's think about it for a minute, right?

[20:48] American Pinball.

[20:49] No one's buying this barbecue game.

[20:51] Nobody.

[20:52] Nobody's buying it, right?

[20:53] Nobody.

[20:54] All right.

[20:55] So that means Ryan McQuade's game is up next.

[20:57] Okay.

[20:58] Now look, I was looking and wondering when did Ryan McQuade join American Pinball?

[21:02] And I was shocked to see that he joined American Pinball two years ago.

[21:06] It was April 22nd of 2022.

[21:09] Okay.

[21:10] What has Ryan McQuade been doing over at American Pinball for two freaking years?

[21:17] Nothing has come to market.

[21:19] He's got nothing out the door.

[21:21] He doesn't work on Sonic the Hedgehog.

[21:23] And I think it's Cuphead.

[21:24] And this is what I don't get.

[21:25] So no one's buying the barbecue game.

[21:28] And now we're hearing that Ryan's game is not ready to go yet.

[21:32] They have to rush to get it to Pinball Expo?

[21:35] That doesn't make any sense.

[21:37] How is this game not done?

[21:39] Keith Elwin could design five games in two years and Ryan McQuade can't finish one game

[21:44] over at American Pinball?

[21:46] Is it because Steve Bowden is sleeping in the corner?

[21:48] I mean, what's going on with this company?

[21:51] David Fix, what are you doing?

[21:52] This whole thing is a disaster.

[21:54] Nobody's going to care about freaking Ryan McQuade's Cuphead at Pinball Expo because

[22:00] now we're hearing that back to the futures come into Expo.

[22:04] And so is John Borg's newly designed Metallica game.

[22:09] So this is why if you don't got talent and you don't got a theme people want, you're

[22:15] going to march into Expo with Cuphead.

[22:17] And then we're going to get back to the future and we're going to get a new Metallica game

[22:22] on all new Spike 3 with all new features or Cuphead.

[22:26] It's game over American Pinball.

[22:28] You had your window and you failed.

[22:31] Canada is the only one who talks like this.

[22:34] It's a reason why you're a club member.

[22:36] And speaking of being a club member, I want to give a big shout out to Drew S who just

[22:41] became a member at $30 a month.

[22:44] Drew, you are a member of the Omokase Club.

[22:48] And that means if we're ever in the same city together, Omokase on me brother.

[22:52] Thank you Drew S for joining the Canada Club.

[22:54] And you know some of you out there, you're ready.

[22:56] You're ready to go from $5 to $10 or $10 to $30.

[23:00] You know you're ready.

[23:01] You know you don't even need me to ask you to get there.

[23:03] You know what?

[23:04] As I was just saying this though, this is funny.

[23:06] As I was just doing that whole thing about what's coming to Expo, I'm here to tell you

[23:10] right now because I just got a text from Barry.

[23:13] It just came through.

[23:15] And you're hearing it here first on Canada's Pinball podcast that they are not presenting

[23:20] back to the future at Expo in October.

[23:23] And the reason why he responded to me is I said to him, you should not be revealing this

[23:29] game at Pinball Expo to 2,000 people or however many people go through that show.

[23:36] You should be revealing that game at Comic Con in New York City to hundreds of thousands

[23:42] of people and that's going to get you way more exposure for your back to the future

[23:46] pinball machine.

[23:48] And he said that's not a bad idea.

[23:50] So you're hearing it here first real time and live on a recorded show that back to the

[23:54] future will not be at Expo this year.

[23:57] And speaking of Dutch Pinball, that kind of makes sense because I can't figure out and

[24:02] I know Barry and Melvin might listen to this show.

[24:04] I can't figure out how this company that still has to make all of these Lebowski's by the

[24:09] end of the year and they still have a bunch of orders to go through.

[24:12] And then you're going to try to make 500 Alice in Wonderlands.

[24:16] I know those games are slated to go on the line in July.

[24:21] But how are you going to make 500 Alice's all of these big Lebowski's and get back to

[24:27] the future on the line in October?

[24:30] My guess is that back to the future won't be on the line in October but they might show

[24:36] it by the end of the year.

[24:38] I also think Barry, knowing that he has back to the future, he doesn't have to take a penny.

[24:43] He doesn't have to take a dime in pre-order money.

[24:46] Like there's no like oh we got to gauge the interest on this title.

[24:49] Let's take some non-refundable deposits.

[24:51] I don't think he has to go down any of that shenanigans road.

[24:55] I don't think he has to do any of that stupid stuff.

[24:57] You know, he knows he's got a winner.

[24:59] I mean he's going to be making back to the future for the next 10 years and I'm super

[25:03] excited to see the game finally.

[25:05] And the more I think about Alice in Wonderland, the more I'm like I don't know.

[25:09] You know 500 of these games.

[25:11] I don't even think Jersey Jack can sell 500 Elton John collectors editions.

[25:17] So how are you going to sell 500 Alice in Wonderlands for like 14,000 something?

[25:22] I just don't know.

[25:24] I think a lot of these people were planning this stuff during the COVID frenzy and the

[25:29] market is so much softer right now.

[25:32] It's so much flatter.

[25:33] I don't really know.

[25:35] Now that being said, I have interest on my Batman SLE.

[25:39] You know in that game is always going to hold value around $30,000 and every time Stern

[25:44] releases another LE with a thousand units.

[25:49] Guess what that does to the price of my Batman SLE?

[25:53] And there's only 80 in the world and all you're doing is oversaturating what an LE is and

[25:59] what a collector's edition is.

[26:02] All that's going to do is make collectors seek out games like Batman 66 SLE even more

[26:09] because everyone's got a Jaws LE.

[26:12] Everyone's got a Foo LE.

[26:14] Everyone's got a Bond LE.

[26:16] Everyone can have an Elton John CE and not just that because there's so many of them.

[26:21] All of them are just tanking in price.

[26:23] I mean everything.

[26:24] Every Stern LE that was $13,000 will slide down to being around $10,000.

[26:30] Trust me everybody.

[26:32] Wait and see is always the way to go.

[26:34] I remember back in the day like it wasn't impossible even after Stern launched Batman

[26:39] SLE when they only made like 80 at $15,000 a pop.

[26:44] If you go on pin side, we were still normal then.

[26:47] It was still a normal marketplace and there were people that bought it and then when they

[26:51] went to sell the game, they got like 16 or 17,000 for it and you could get it.

[26:57] They popped up every once in a while.

[26:59] The world's just become stupid now.

[27:01] I remember during the height of COVID, Jurassic Park LEs were selling for $18,000.

[27:07] $19,000 for Stranger Things LEs.

[27:10] Stupid.

[27:12] Those games are all crashing back down now.

[27:15] They're all crashing down in price now.

[27:17] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[27:20] The baby is coming any day now.

[27:23] It is a boy.

[27:24] We are going to have two boys.

[27:26] It's going to be nuts.

[27:28] Their daddy is the world's favorite pinball podcaster and you're my favorite audience.

[27:33] We'll talk to you soon, later.

[27:35] Don't stop believing.

[27:37] Hold on to that feeling.

[27:39] Streetlight people.

[27:40] Don't stop believing.

[27:47] Don't stop believing.

[27:54] Hold on to that feeling.

[28:01] Don't stop believing.

[28:08] Hold on to that feeling.

[28:13] Streetlight people.
