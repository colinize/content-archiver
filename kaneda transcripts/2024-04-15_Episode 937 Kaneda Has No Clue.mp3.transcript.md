[00:00] It's a new day, but it all feels old, it's a good life, that's what I'm told, but everything

[00:06] at all just feels the same.

[00:14] Ah, welcome everybody, happy Monday, it's Canadian Spinball Podcast, I'm your host,

[00:18] Canada, we're gonna talk all about what's going on in the pinball world, we're at mid-April,

[00:24] are we gonna get John Wick any day now?

[00:28] What is the next title from Jersey Jack Pinball, can Canada be more off and all over the place

[00:34] on these rumors?

[00:37] Are we gonna sell any barbecue challenges?

[00:41] Is Dutch Pinball X gonna be able to sell Alice in Wonderland?

[00:45] Where is Funhouse from Andretti, Padretti or whatever Padretti gaming, where's that

[00:50] damn remake?

[00:52] Is Abba gonna sell any units?

[00:54] You're seeing ACDC Lucys for $12,000 and nobody wants to buy a Pulp Fiction LE for

[01:02] $2,500 over Sticker, let's go around the pinball horn and talk about what's going on in pinball,

[01:08] ladies and gentlemen.

[01:09] Alright, so if you've been wanting a Black Knight from Stern Pinball, good news, you

[01:16] can go get a Black Knight Pro Remade by Stern Pinball in the new factory, where the quality

[01:24] is not as good as the old factory, but I think this move makes total sense, there's been

[01:29] a lot of demand for Black Knight, well not a lot of demand, but some demand, and that's

[01:34] all it takes if there's a few hundred people that want this game and Stern's got parts

[01:40] lying around because people forget this, when Black Knight first came out, it didn't sell

[01:45] very well, and Stern doesn't order just a few parts when they make a game, so they probably

[01:52] had a bunch of Black Knight parts on a shelf, they had the Knight, that mechanism in the

[01:57] middle, and they said to themselves, alright, we've got enough to make another 500 of these,

[02:03] let's just do it right now, and for those of you who have played Black Knight sort of

[02:07] rage, the Pro version is much better than the LE and the premium, the upper playfield

[02:14] does nothing for the gameplay, and so I think this is a smart move, what I would have liked

[02:19] to have seen Stern do though, is add a shaker motor, add some other elements to the Pro

[02:25] machine, maybe some inner art blades or mirror blades inside that game, just make it look

[02:31] a little bit nicer, you know, add a few more elements to this that make someone who's buying

[02:36] this game feel like they're getting a special version of this game, they re-released the

[02:41] Black Knight topper a few months ago for a lot more money than it was originally, and

[02:46] I know some people out there like bought the topper waiting for the premium to be remade,

[02:53] and maybe some of those people are disappointed that they spent like 1500 bucks on a topper

[02:58] or $1800 whatever it is, and now all they get is the Pro version of the game, so Black

[03:04] Knight is back, do most of you care?

[03:08] No, we're waiting for what's next from Stern Pinball, we're waiting for John Wick, how

[03:14] is Jaws doing, how do you think Jaws is doing, I got more time on Jaws premium and a lot

[03:21] more time on Elton John, I did a nice breakdown of both machines on Facebook the other day,

[03:27] I will summarize it for you like this, I think both games are really good, I do, I think both

[03:33] Jaws and Elton John are really good pinball machines, I wouldn't classify either of them

[03:39] as like a masterpiece or one of the top 10 best games of all time, but I think in modern

[03:46] pinball times both of these games are really good, I think they're both overpriced, yes

[03:53] I absolutely do, I think both of these games if they were $3000 less for the LE and the

[04:00] CE and like $2000 or $1500 less for a premium or a platinum, I think a lot more of you are

[04:08] looking at these games and when you put them side by side, I will say this, there's a lot

[04:14] more to shoot at in Jaws pinball, there just is, as much as we complain that the shark

[04:20] doesn't eat the ball, there's a lot of pathways in this game and when you really jump on Jaws

[04:26] and you see what Keith Elwin did with this game, I think it's very deceiving at first

[04:31] glance what's in this game and because so much of the focus was on the lack of a shark

[04:38] eating a ball, I think a lot of us are not appreciating what's in this game in terms

[04:43] of like the different shots, all the different pathways of the ball and yes, shots are not

[04:50] the new toys, would I have liked there to have been? A wow mechanical moment in Jaws

[04:56] pinball, absolutely, is it there? No it's not, but what this game does have is a layout

[05:03] that is really fun to shoot and also where this game is going to win, it's loaded with

[05:09] assets and they keep putting more assets into the game and unlike Elton John, I think Jaws

[05:16] is going to have more replay value. I think Elton John is just a pure fun game to shoot,

[05:23] it's obviously the greatest Jersey Jack of all time to shoot and I think for people out

[05:28] there who haven't owned a lot of Steve Richie games, if you jump on Elton John in modern

[05:35] times and you haven't owned a Star Trek and you haven't owned a Spider-Man and this is

[05:40] sort of like your entry into Steve Richie games, I think you're going to love Elton John

[05:45] so damn much more, I think you're absolutely going to love this pin. I think Elton John

[05:51] immediately satisfies more than Jaws when you just walk up to the machine, the shots

[05:57] are a lot easier to hit. I will say some of those shots and Jaws are really tight but

[06:02] once you figure them out, you start to enjoy the game more and more but for a casual player,

[06:08] just walking up to Elton John, you're going to hit a lot more shots, you're going to have

[06:13] longer ball times and because in Elton John, you sort of pick your song and you start the

[06:18] game, you almost feel like you've achieved something the moment you plunge the game where

[06:23] if you go up to Jaws, you're not really going to be sure what you're doing but in Elton John,

[06:30] you feel like you're in it right away so it has more immediate gratification. Now that being said,

[06:36] I think the team over at Stern just blew everybody away by getting all of the assets from this Jaws

[06:42] movie and they're going to keep putting more and more of it into the game. Remember, all of us

[06:46] were worried that Jaws was going to be more like a Jurassic Park, an animated adventure based on

[06:52] the movies from Jaws but no, it's everything you want to see up on that screen. The callouts are

[06:58] great, the music kind of works. I didn't think it would work but it really teleports you into

[07:04] that Jaws world and there's just a lot to do in the game and a lot to explore. Now look, Elton John

[07:11] also has deep code but here's the difference. When I'm playing Jaws, I have a deeper connection to

[07:16] what's happening with the modes and the code than I do with Elton John and if you think about it,

[07:22] like what are you really doing in Elton John Pimbal? Like I know in Jaws, you're trying to catch

[07:28] and kill sharks, you're trying to save people, you're going on a night swim, you're tying knots,

[07:33] you're doing all these things and when you play Elton John, I just don't feel like you're really

[07:39] journeying through anything really translatable to somebody. Like for example, I think Elton John is

[07:45] all about collecting all of the different items in his wardrobe and you just don't feel like you're

[07:51] doing that when you play the game. Sure, stuff is happening, sure they're giving you callouts and

[07:56] stuff is popping up on the screen but you don't really physically and viscerally feel like you

[08:02] are playing as Elton John or collecting his items and going around the world and going from being

[08:09] like a nobody to a rock and roll star globally. Like you don't really feel any of that progression

[08:14] in the game and so Elton in a lot of ways is another really, really fun to play musical jukebox and

[08:22] that's what it does best. I know it does other stuff but for the most part that is what Elton John is

[08:29] and Jaws is much more of an adventure. Now that being said, both really good games,

[08:35] both fun games to stand over. When it comes to Flipper feel, I still give Stern the advantage.

[08:41] They still feel snappier, they feel stronger. That being said, Jersey Jack Flippers on Elton John

[08:48] are the best to date of any Jersey Jack game to date and my overall summary of both of these games,

[08:56] these are great games that are just overpriced and that's just it. I think both of them suffer

[09:03] from post-COVID pricing and more people should have both of these games in their lineup because I

[09:10] do think they are really, really solid efforts from both Jersey Jack and from Stern but my feeling

[09:16] is a few months from now hype on both of these games will be absolutely dead and a lot of you

[09:22] are just going to wait to pick one up at used pinball prices. So that being said, we've been hearing

[09:29] that John Wick was going to come out sometime in April. We are now in mid-April. It's now looking

[09:35] like it might be end of this month or early May but it has to be right around the corner. We know

[09:42] Tim Sexton is working on the game. We know that an anthrax band member is going to be providing

[09:47] the music for John Wick. Will John Wick have clips from the movies? Will there be a continental? Will

[09:54] there be a Mustang? Will there be a dead dog? Are there going to be gold coins? The thing about

[09:59] pinball marketing is this. I think if you make a John Wick pinball machine, how do you make it

[10:05] where the owner doesn't get some gold coins from the continental to put into that game itself? It

[10:12] would be super cool if that was like a feature of the game. Like there was a larger coin slot that's

[10:19] somewhere in the game. You could take out of your pocket a large continental gold coin and put it

[10:26] into the game and that unlocks a special feature in the game. How awesome would that be? We're not

[10:34] going to see it because as I said on my other show, all pinball marketing is stale. Every company does

[10:42] it the same way every single time. We never see truly creative and innovative stuff being put into

[10:52] these games based on the themes they're based on. It just doesn't happen. You think about all the

[10:58] things you could do with Jaws and the Orca and there's the oxygen tank in his mouth and you get

[11:05] one shot to send that SOB to hell and it never comes. It never comes and it will never come.

[11:12] You know there was a moment I was playing Jaws and I actually was shooting so quickly up the middle

[11:16] that I forced the ball to go into Jaws' mouth a little bit as he was going back down the play

[11:22] field and then it just pops up and ball kicks it out. It wasn't like a moment, it just happened by

[11:27] mistake. So we're going to see John Wick. I just don't expect John Wick to take over the pinball

[11:32] world. So that's happening over at Stern. After John Wick, I think we're going to get John Borg's

[11:39] Metallica. Whether or not it's a remake or it's an all-new Metallica game, it's going to be the

[11:45] first game on Spike 3. We will see what that means. Alright, let's go to Jersey Jack now. So I've

[11:51] been all over the map on this rumor. Is it going to be Matrix? Is David Thiel coming back? Is it

[11:58] not going to be Matrix? Is it going to be the Muppets? I'm here to tell you right now ladies

[12:03] and gentlemen, yes my sources have been all over the place and here's why I think my sources have

[12:09] been all over the place. I think people know Nuggets. I think they know bits and pieces of what's

[12:15] happening over there but no, I don't know anymore. I just don't know anymore. What is next from Jersey

[12:22] Jack pinball? What I can tell you for certain is this. It is Mark Sidon's game and what I've also

[12:30] heard is that if we warm up to the theme, we're really going to like this game and I heard that

[12:37] from someone who spoke to an employee at Jersey Jack. So what does that mean if you warm up to

[12:44] the theme? Now here's my last guess on this whole thing and we might not see it for a while so I might

[12:52] make this guess 10 times more before we get the game but here's the thing. Why would they say that?

[12:58] If it was the Matrix, there's no way someone would say you have to warm up to the theme. So then I feel

[13:03] like it's not that. If it was the Muppets, yes that feels like a theme you'd have to warm up to

[13:10] and we know that the Muppets was part of that list years ago when there was the whistleblower at Jersey

[13:18] Jack who said they're going to make Dialed in, they're going to make Willy Wonka and they also

[13:23] have the license for the Muppets. Now everything on that whistleblower's list has come true except

[13:31] for the Muppets but I don't think it's the Muppets. I really don't think it's the Muppets.

[13:37] Here's what I think it might be. I think it might be the game based on Harry Potter. Now you could

[13:43] be saying Chris, Kaneda, what are you talking about? What do you mean you have to warm up to this game?

[13:48] If it's Harry Potter, there's no way you'd have to warm up to it but what if it's not based on the

[13:53] Harry Potter movies? What if it's based on Wizarding World and what if it's a completely original

[14:00] Harry Potter adventure? See once you do something like that now you're into the realm of another

[14:08] potential Toy Story 4 where you're making something based on a property people love but it's not what

[14:16] people want from that property and I think that might be what that means you're gonna have to warm

[14:24] up to it because if it's not the original Harry Potter movies and even worse imagine if it's like

[14:30] Fantastic Beasts or one of the movies that came out after the major Harry Potter films if it's more

[14:36] of those Wizarding World movies I don't know if that's gonna work so I don't know what I do know

[14:42] is this I saw someone say like Kaneda you've been so wrong on this people are gonna unsubscribe and

[14:48] you're gonna lose fans of the show really are you gonna depart Kaneda's pinball podcast because

[14:55] I'm not 100% sure what's next from Jersey Jack what I am 100% sure about is Elton John is not

[15:03] selling and this next game from Jersey Jack has to come out sooner than later and the reason why I

[15:09] know Elton John is not selling very well I went on pin side and you can still go order a collector's

[15:16] edition easily not only that this is the real problem for Jersey Jack when it comes to manufacturing

[15:22] there are a bunch of distributors that have Elton John Platinum's sitting in a box at their factory

[15:30] like in their warehouse and so if those games are unsold you know what that means it means there's no

[15:38] demand for the game and how can they keep making more Elton John Platinum's if distributors are

[15:45] sitting on them new in box if there was demand for this game at $12,000 or $15,000 they wouldn't

[15:54] be sitting in a box at a distributor and so there's gonna come a point and it's only April

[16:00] like May June by July that there's no way they're gonna be able to make more Elton John machines

[16:06] because nobody's gonna be buying them on a distribution level and so they're gonna have

[16:10] to move on to the next game and if I were Jersey Jack I would do something smart I would just announce

[16:17] we're only gonna make this many Elton John's I would be transparent about how many total you made

[16:24] and say look after this date if you don't order an Elton John we are never making them again

[16:33] to date we've made this many collector's editions and this many Platinum's and that will be that

[16:40] anyone who got one we thank you for your loyalty we know you're gonna have a machine people are

[16:45] gonna want to pay over to get it out of your collection and I would start to make moves like

[16:50] that like start to have some swagger JJP if people want to push back against you and say your games

[16:56] are overpriced and I'm just gonna wait until this game is on the used market we'll just push back

[17:02] and say it's probably not gonna be on the used market because we're not gonna keep making this

[17:06] game because we've got so many exciting games coming down the road that we're not gonna do this

[17:12] and I think they should have done this from the very beginning I think they should have said

[17:16] Elton John is a beautiful game we're making 500 CEs and 2000 Platinum's and that's it forever

[17:23] they need to start baking some scarcity into these Jersey Jack products because that's why

[17:28] everyone's just waiting on the sidelines all right so we shall see I fully expect to see Jersey

[17:34] Jack's next game by the summer and here's the thing I just want Jersey Jack to nail it I feel

[17:41] like we get our expectations up for them all the time and even though Elton John does nail it as

[17:48] far as an Elton John game goes it doesn't nail it as far as demand and enthusiasm for the theme

[17:56] and the price is just pricing everybody out all right so talk about demand and manufacturing

[18:04] let's talk real quick about barrels of fun so I read on Naps Arcade there was a seminar this weekend

[18:10] at Fantastic barrels of fun was up there and we finally got a line of sight into how many games

[18:18] this company is making they've definitely had delays and so the word on the street is that they

[18:25] can make four to five games a day so let's say on a good week you're at 25 games a week a week people

[18:34] that's not a lot that's not a lot and so when you're making 1100 games now they're not going to be

[18:40] hitting that every week so it roughly is going to take this company eight months to a year if

[18:46] they're making that many games to finish the run of labyrinth so it's a slow trickle it's a very

[18:53] slow trickle and as I've already showed you you can go get a used labyrinth with a topper for cheaper

[19:02] than it would cost you if you ordered one today from barrels of fun and this is a problem that all

[19:09] these boutiques have that just trickle games out and want to lock you in to a non-refundable

[19:17] deposit when they reveal the game if you go in early and you get a late number in the run so let's

[19:26] say your number 800 for your labyrinth and they're making 1100 and you might have like six to eight

[19:34] months to wait for your game within three months of ordering your game you will be able to go get a

[19:41] used labyrinth with low plays for less money than your new in box game is that you have to now

[19:48] wait many more months to get that's always why it's hard for these boutiques to keep the demand and

[19:54] the hype going on a game and as of today the game is still not sold out they are confident it will

[20:01] sell out I'm not sure you know I'm really not sure and as I said on my other show if they picked a

[20:06] more universally loved theme I think they easily sell 1100 games if they picked a theme more people

[20:14] want labyrinth is pretty niche I get that the game is really cool it's got some innovative things but

[20:21] it's just not mass market theme and so I'm hoping this company on their next title makes something

[20:29] that's more appealing to most of us and I know most of you have not been clamoring for labyrinth

[20:36] I know most of you are not clamoring for ABBA doesn't it feel like ABBA has been out now for months

[20:43] right because we knew it was ABBA for months and now it's out and now they want to take orders

[20:49] and I just don't think they're gonna come and now that the pinball brother guy said that if demand

[20:55] is there they're gonna make even more games I think that's gonna turn people off to buying one of these

[21:01] 800 games ABBA music is great people it's absolutely great high-energy music I just don't see the pinball

[21:10] experience being worth the money especially when you look at how cheap it is to get an alien

[21:17] ABBA feels severely overpriced but hey at least they're making games at least they're giving you

[21:23] options there's nothing wrong with that if a company wants to make a game that's not for you

[21:28] that's cool if they want to price it at 10 and 11 thousand dollars that's cool I'd rather pinball

[21:34] companies do stuff than not do stuff right I'd rather this be the case I still have more faith

[21:41] in pinball brothers than I do in American pinball I mean I think David Fix's company is done I think

[21:48] they keep uploading photos of him smiling in front of barrio's barbecue challenge it's the biggest

[21:55] joke in the entire industry it's one of the worst pinball machines ever made and everyone associated

[22:01] with green lighting that game should be shown the door that's how I feel about American pinball

[22:07] they're just not viable anymore they're absolutely not viable and if you go on the pinside marketplace

[22:12] the problem is when you destroy a brand like what David Fix has done to AP he's destroyed the brand

[22:18] and now that he's destroyed the brand people don't want to collect your products like go look at

[22:23] how cheap you can go get a Houdini now in october fest a freaking legends of a hall of these games

[22:29] are all now like five to six thousand dollars it's because nobody wants that American pinball game

[22:35] in their lineup and the company's going in the wrong direction so everyone's just going to cut

[22:40] bait on anything associated with American pinball all right what else is going on in pinball canada

[22:47] has been trying to test the markets on this pulp fiction le nobody's buying this game over sticker

[22:53] if it's 2,500 over sticker now trying to see if someone will pay 1500 over sticker for a pulp

[23:00] fiction le is the market done are the days of flipping anything over sticker are they over

[23:09] they might be people I mean I haven't seen anything like this before I think people were able to flip

[23:14] some pulp fictions for a profit right when the game came out because there was so much hype there

[23:19] was so much hype but now that all of these sds are going to ship I don't know like are people going

[23:24] to put value on the different back box on the topper are people really going to want it maybe

[23:31] some people who have an sd that absolutely love it are going to want to trade up for an le the

[23:37] problem there is to trade up you got to put your game on the market or sell it used and you're just

[23:43] over saturating the pulp fiction market to begin with so yeah we might just be at a point now

[23:49] where there's no money to be made right I saw a jaws le is now already $500 off there's no money

[23:55] to be made everything's gonna head south and what that's gonna do is good it's gonna make everybody

[24:02] just stop speculating stop running at FOMO stop buying every single new game on the week it's

[24:10] released it's gonna make all of us reflect more and make sure we make wise decisions so

[24:17] what does that mean for canada and his house that can absorb like 15 bimbal machines at most

[24:24] I'm gonna put two machines into my house I am really struggling with which machines go into my home

[24:31] here's the reason why is that I really want back to the future more than everything I want back to

[24:37] the future more than guns and roses I want it more than Batman SLE and I don't want to be moving

[24:42] games in and out so if I know that back to the future is coming out at the end of the year and

[24:49] I'm getting ready to put pins into my home and most likely those pins have to go up and downstairs

[24:56] I'm sort of okay waiting I've got my games in storage there's no rush I haven't had a pinball

[25:03] machine in my apartment in so long so you know what's a few more months as I wait to the end of

[25:10] this year especially with baby number two on the way coming any week now especially because I'm

[25:18] buying furniture for a home and when you go furniture shopping I'll tell you what it does to

[25:23] you it makes you realize how much we are over paying for pinball there's no way around it people

[25:32] I mean the price of a freaking Foo Fighters topper is a nice piece of furniture that's got real

[25:39] craftsmanship I can't get over this the pinball prices have like warped our sense of what things

[25:44] should cost it's just bonkers and I'm only gonna be a 30 minute drive to automate it so that's my

[25:52] plan when I want to go play stuff I'm gonna wake up in the morning get in the demon drive to automate

[25:59] it and jump on all of these great games get to know them get to play them Mike doesn't know this

[26:05] yet but Mike I'm gonna be knocking on the door and instead of owning everything I'll just find

[26:11] great locations to play these machines like I did at Jack bar this weekend it was so much fun going

[26:18] there interviewing John during the Saturday morning show and then watching so many of you

[26:24] contribute to the tip for Sam the bartender and I think at the end of Saturday night we had raised

[26:31] over $500 for Sam as a tip I want to say thank you to each and every one of you who contribute it

[26:40] who gave some money you guys are the best this canada army isn't an army it's a group of grown men

[26:47] mostly with really big hearts and some of you have even bigger wallets and I love the fact that you

[26:54] sign up every month to hear the world's favorite pinball humble podcaster who's got the twippy

[26:59] six years in a row everybody happy Monday we'll talk to you soon canada out
