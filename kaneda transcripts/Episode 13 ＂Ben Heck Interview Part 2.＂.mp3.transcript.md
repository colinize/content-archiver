[00:00] Oh, it's like a cosmic rebirth!

[00:11] Alright, here we are, Kaneda's pinball podcast.

[00:23] We're gonna get right into it.

[00:24] We're gonna air right now the second part of my interview with Ben Hack, where we kicked

[00:29] things off initially with talking about his working with J-Pop, John Papaduke.

[00:34] I also will go into what my connection with J-Pop was for a little bit of a very tenuous

[00:41] and short-lived relationship.

[00:44] But without further ado, I want to turn it back over.

[00:47] And when we last left off, we were talking about how Magic Girl was Circus Voltaire on

[00:52] crack.

[00:53] So let's get right back into it.

[00:55] Let's talk a little bit about J-Pop.

[00:58] And I know we've alluded to some of what it was like working with him.

[01:02] I actually was talking to him until a while back in.

[01:06] I wanted to say...

[01:07] Yeah, I wanted to try to become PR man.

[01:08] Yeah, I was.

[01:09] I was.

[01:10] Kaneda, my real name, but I actually have a Zidware email address, his PR Zidware.

[01:19] I got so much shit for that.

[01:21] But as anyone who's contacted John who offered to help, here's a lot of people trying to help

[01:28] John.

[01:29] Right.

[01:30] And here's what I was trying to help him with.

[01:32] And I was basically, I came on board right before, remember he was supposed to reveal

[01:38] it in December.

[01:39] Magic Girl reveal was going to be December.

[01:41] I believe it was 2014.

[01:43] And I connected with him a couple months before.

[01:46] And my suggestion to him was very simple.

[01:48] And I thought the pin was almost done like everyone else.

[01:52] I said, look, you're going to reveal this to the world.

[01:55] Let me help you get a nice media outlet to reveal what has been your labor of love for

[02:02] so many years.

[02:03] And we can get more people into pinball and seeing the kinds of cool stuff that pinball

[02:08] is doing.

[02:09] It wasn't about selling more than right because they were all sold out.

[02:12] He only was making at that time like 16 or 50 magic girls.

[02:16] And so I put together a marketing plan and set up an exclusive with wire that was going

[02:21] to reveal to the world.

[02:22] They were all on board.

[02:23] And it was funny because every month my wired guys be like, I don't know what's happening.

[02:28] I don't know what's happening.

[02:29] And basically it's like whatever is just never happening.

[02:31] And then I sent them the link when like the pentagio thing imploded.

[02:34] Yeah.

[02:35] You look up with a large publication.

[02:36] You better put up a shut up.

[02:37] They're not going to wait around.

[02:38] Right.

[02:39] And it's funny because when I was talking about that and I was ripping on stern for the

[02:42] longest time about having the worst marketing when they revealed pins, they sort of they

[02:48] did exactly what I suggested.

[02:49] And now they do IGN, right.

[02:51] They get it out there to the world in a larger with a larger outlet that is just bringing

[02:57] more eyeballs to their product, which equals more sales.

[03:00] I mean, as much as eventually you have to go for a younger market because the old people

[03:05] will die.

[03:06] I mean, it's just, you know, so John, so did John because something I can never get out

[03:10] of him.

[03:11] I worked a little bit closely with him.

[03:13] From what I could take, he could never get magic girl to work properly.

[03:18] That big center toy mechanism with the hands and the whatever the, the gesture that's

[03:24] in that middle, that play field, never never worked.

[03:28] Like he couldn't.

[03:29] Okay.

[03:30] Well, during the time that I worked with him, I never saw a working game of anything.

[03:35] Never.

[03:36] Never saw anything flipping in his shop.

[03:39] And granted, so I didn't, we didn't really work on it a whole lot.

[03:43] That's the thing.

[03:44] It's like people think that we're like, oh, yeah, you know, we're buddy, buddy business

[03:47] partners.

[03:48] But it was basically like, well, I was started.

[03:51] It was a 2011.

[03:54] And I was doing an episode of my show and Jerry Ellsworth was on and we were doing like

[03:57] pinball stuff in an episode.

[03:58] And then I see this random comment on my website.

[04:03] And it's like, oh, cool pinball.

[04:05] I could show you how it's done.

[04:07] Sign John Papa Duke.

[04:08] And I was like, oh, wow, John Papa Duke commented on my website, you know, like Starstruck,

[04:13] right?

[04:15] But even looking back at the comment now, it was like that air of ecotism and like, I'm

[04:19] the teacher, you're the learner blah, blah, blah.

[04:22] And I did learn stuff from John, but I think he took it a little too far.

[04:26] And it wasn't just with me, like with anybody, you know?

[04:30] I think the best boss hires people that are better than them.

[04:34] They hire people that can do what they cannot.

[04:37] Instead of like, I can do everything and I'll show you how to do it.

[04:40] Right.

[04:41] Well, and he very much had an attitude of it's like a privilege to work with me, right?

[04:45] And that you almost should be doing it for free.

[04:47] In fact, I almost feel like he felt like people should be paying him to work for him.

[04:52] Oh, you mean like pinball school?

[04:54] Right, right.

[04:55] Well, I also like, that's a thing, you know, people will work for free.

[05:01] Like I didn't make a goddamn cent off America's most haunted until like, oh shit.

[05:07] December of 2014, like two years after I started, but I did make money.

[05:12] Whereas with John, it was like, oh, you're going to make money some day blah, blah, blah, blah.

[05:15] It's like, hey, when, you know, at least with AMH, it was a slow start.

[05:19] But it's like, okay, we're going to make these games.

[05:22] If everyone you sell, you'll make X amount.

[05:24] If it's a Drexiella or X amount, if it's to a distributor, blah, blah, blah.

[05:28] You know, it was cut and dried, right?

[05:30] The Rob Zombie.

[05:31] It's like, hope with the Rob Zombie.

[05:33] You'll get this much blah.

[05:34] You know, if that's what I like.

[05:35] Like the Joker says in Batman, he figured it's not they never do it for free.

[05:38] Right.

[05:39] And yeah, with John, it was like, you know, yeah, he would sign, well, yeah, here's an example.

[05:43] Like he had his customers sign an NDA's blah, blah, blah.

[05:46] But then he designed a game with my likeness, but did not have a contract with me.

[05:50] Which is stupid because I could go back and say, hey, I'm going to sue you because you're using my license without a contract.

[05:57] And then he changed, he changed it because he didn't like the fact I was working with spooky.

[06:01] But without a contract, you can't bind someone to be exclusive.

[06:05] Well, he also put God.

[06:06] So I mean, I don't honestly know who really wanted a game with me in it anyway.

[06:10] I mean, as I told John, there are infinitely number of more attractive people who are more popular than me to put in a game.

[06:16] You know, have like match or zombie chick or something.

[06:19] Well, he was a balding ginger on their game.

[06:21] Right.

[06:22] He also, well, he also threw, um, he threw Godzilla on there.

[06:26] He threw the, the, the Martians.

[06:28] Oh, yeah, that's what he felt, but it had to be reached on.

[06:31] Even though it wasn't 95% complete.

[06:34] If you, if you looked at the pictures when he was trying to cobble that together, he had like spinners directly or like his rotating

[06:40] Totten Spinner's directly in front of ramps that would never work.

[06:43] That's the thing.

[06:44] John taught me, he taught me a lot of cool stuff.

[06:47] And like foam core foam core hot glue tested in that.

[06:51] But he was a classic example of not practicing what he preached.

[06:56] You know, like building a game on foam core and shooting.

[06:59] That's what we do with AMH.

[07:00] We built in a foam core and we made sure it shot well.

[07:02] Before we even used wood or plastic or anything.

[07:06] But John, John was like building a house by putting up the wallpaper before even built the foundation.

[07:12] It was complete backwards.

[07:14] And I think that's why people who might not have known better thought the games were complete or 95% complete

[07:19] because they looked like they were all there.

[07:23] However, yeah, example with the, um, the zombie game.

[07:30] I mean, nonwithstanding the fact that the shots didn't look like they would work.

[07:33] I mean, you had, so yeah, you get sued by Toho.

[07:37] You get sued by who has Robby now, Warner Brothers.

[07:40] And there's something else on there too that they probably, oh yeah, the Martha Tax.

[07:43] So you get sued by tops because guess what?

[07:45] That that is still a valid franchise like Alex Horley just did a series in New York.

[07:50] For that.

[07:51] Right.

[07:51] And it's kind of like a shame because I think J-pop, I mean, like I don't feel.

[07:56] But at least it got us zombie Yeti, right?

[07:57] Yeah, exactly.

[07:58] Well, the silver, yeah, and the thing that I think John just,

[08:02] if he would have waited and just, he's the kind of guy who needs to be in a big company.

[08:08] I kind of, I'm a, my career, I'm a little bit of a creative.

[08:12] And I need to be around people that also can take ideas and help me execute them

[08:17] and bring them the market.

[08:18] I mean, that's, you got to know your limitations.

[08:21] Working in a vacuum is a terrible idea.

[08:23] No, and he needs to, he needed to be, you know,

[08:26] because he, I think people all agree that he knows how to design a beautiful looking machine.

[08:31] He just needs to be surrounded by people who will actually make it work.

[08:36] And by himself, he's redesigning screws and bolts.

[08:40] And things you won't even see.

[08:41] Like you get to that level of like, this is pointless.

[08:45] You're making glass, you know, the glass bigger on a machine.

[08:48] And let's talk about, let's talk about, because, you know, the, the bomb, right?

[08:52] The build of materials.

[08:53] I know Ben, you talk a lot about that.

[08:56] Well, here's what I want to get your opinion on, because from what I've noticed,

[09:00] and this is not just, I mean, I mean, I know any other beard again into this one.

[09:03] Well, here's the, go get another beer.

[09:07] The, the build of materials is, you know, the cost of all the supplies to make a product.

[09:13] And I'm still shocked, though.

[09:15] Well, also, it would include the labor to assemble the product.

[09:19] The labor.

[09:19] And it should, it should include the tax you pay on the profit.

[09:23] And then you get to keep the money.

[09:25] Right. So here's, here's my observation.

[09:28] And I want, I want to hear what your thoughts are.

[09:30] I think that almost, mostly, every new pinball startup that I've seen for the most part,

[09:38] just arbitrarily price is something before they understand the bomb.

[09:42] And oh, yeah, they, they pull numbers out of the rest.

[09:45] No doubt.

[09:45] And, and it seems like business 101 would be, let's see how much everything's going to cost for us.

[09:50] Like, let's see how much it's going to cost if we have to pay,

[09:53] so going to weaver to do alien.

[09:55] Let's see how much it costs to do this.

[09:57] Let's see how much, and then put a price.

[10:00] But the prices, these guys already have a price up.

[10:03] Like, alien's going to be this much money.

[10:04] Here's how much it is to preorder it.

[10:06] Well, I hate to say this, but,

[10:08] Jack did that too.

[10:10] Right, right.

[10:10] And I look, I've gone on the record by saying,

[10:13] if Jersey Jack Pinball did his bomb properly,

[10:18] realized how much it would cost to keep the business afloat without going under

[10:22] and losing money.

[10:25] Was might be $12,000 a machine.

[10:27] And,

[10:29] I don't think everyone in quite that much,

[10:31] but if you remember, when he announced it at 6,500,

[10:33] people were like, this is insane.

[10:35] Right.

[10:35] I mean, because remember, that was back when the game was like four grand, if that.

[10:38] So he didn't even, he didn't, he didn't, he probably,

[10:40] he probably couldn't have had it much higher than that, unfortunately.

[10:44] So it's almost like a loss leader, so to speak, as you'd say, and other,

[10:48] you know, like, especially in the video game world.

[10:51] But you can't, you can't do that when you're a startup and you only have one product,

[10:55] right? I mean, Microsoft can take a huge loss on every Xbox,

[10:59] the first Xbox unit because they've got billions in the bank from, from Windows, right?

[11:04] They, they're just trying to get it to get into the marketplace and, you know,

[11:07] get a user base going.

[11:09] But Pinball, I mean, so I think this is one, I think what happened.

[11:12] What happens is, I don't think this is why spooky has done better is with all of our games,

[11:19] it's like, we actually finished the game first and then we're like, oh,

[11:23] here are all the parts in the game. We can compute a bomb.

[11:27] And then we're like, okay, here's the price.

[11:29] Right.

[11:31] Whereas if your game isn't really in its final form, you don't know what the bomb is,

[11:36] so you have to guess. And then if you're wrong, you have to stick with it.

[11:40] You can't change it later on.

[11:43] Right.

[11:43] And well, you guys, I think is where people get into trouble.

[11:46] Well, walk me through it too, because like you guys like did it and people love you for doing it.

[11:51] You didn't have to take like pre-order money where you're selling the entire machine years in advance.

[11:57] You built them, you guys have some really, the main secret is build your game first.

[12:03] I would say that's the number one thing you should do.

[12:07] Like, that way, here's what happens.

[12:09] That way, people are paying you in order to build the game rather than them paying you to develop the game.

[12:15] That is the crucial difference.

[12:17] Right.

[12:18] Because if they're paying you to develop the game and the cost of development exceeds the profit of the game,

[12:22] then the cost of development eats into the actual build costs.

[12:26] And therefore, you cannot afford to build the games.

[12:28] And then you kind of end up in the cycle.

[12:31] Right.

[12:31] And then we had to fight extra harbor.

[12:33] We had, well, the thing is, you know, we couldn't say, hey, you know that awesome license you love.

[12:37] America's most haunted, cricket, crickets, crickets, crickets.

[12:40] We had to build a game in order to sell a game.

[12:43] Because we couldn't sell it based off the license because there wasn't one.

[12:47] It's like the, it's like the, yeah, I don't know what the best analogy for that would be.

[12:53] But the thing is, almost like a trial by fire that helped us in a way.

[12:57] We didn't have that crutch.

[12:59] Right.

[12:59] Well, and I think what's really helped spooky so well is, no one is wondering if they'll get their

[13:05] Rob Zombie, right?

[13:06] I mean, because there's a precedence for manufacturing and the ability to manufacture,

[13:13] there's confidence.

[13:14] And I think that goes a long, long way, long way.

[13:16] And like, like, talk about in terms of bomb and how do you,

[13:20] where do you price it when you do have a license team?

[13:22] Because I've gone, I've said on Pinside and I got downloaded.

[13:26] I mean, people, I don't know, you know this, but people don't find me very popular at times.

[13:30] And I said, when you guys sold Rob Zombie,

[13:32] well, I think I think you should narrow down your trolling, like pick one thing to troll about.

[13:38] I mean, like, if you look at me on Pinside, I mostly troll about other boutiques and remakes.

[13:45] So, troll about one thing consistently and I think that will help.

[13:50] Because everyone trolls on Pinside.

[13:52] I do it.

[13:52] Maybe I should start a poll to see which thing they'll allow me to troll and I'll just stick to that.

[13:58] Yeah.

[13:59] Before they close that thread in 30 seconds.

[14:02] Well, here's, when you guys price Rob Zombie and when you guys price it, I went out there and

[14:07] I was like, look, I, it sold out so quickly that I was like, well, I bet you guys could have

[14:12] charged another grand for each one and still sold out knowing that the weight list was twice as long.

[14:17] Now, talk to me about that.

[14:18] It's Chuck's game.

[14:20] I mean, if he's comfortable with that price, he can sell it for that price.

[14:25] Right.

[14:26] Um, I mean, they will make money at that price.

[14:30] The thing is, that's one advantage they have now is they know what, not just, well, I guess we can

[14:36] get into this not just how much it costs to make a game, but how long it takes to make a game,

[14:40] which a lot of people have complained about the number of Rob Zombie games.

[14:44] But the thing is, you know, now spooky has the experience, right?

[14:47] Like they're like, okay, we know how long it takes to make America's little haunted.

[14:51] It was something like Rob Zombie.

[14:53] You know, they picked, you know, by moving the numbers around.

[14:57] Although more people are making money on Rob Zombie than an America's most haunted because it's

[15:02] been more of a team effort, you know?

[15:04] So it's kind of democratized the, the profit.

[15:08] But another thing people don't always think about is the number of games.

[15:11] Everyone's like, oh, why don't you make 600 Rob Zombies or 800?

[15:14] So they had like what 300 people on the pre-order list or whatever, right?

[15:19] And then I don't think, I don't even think the Rob Zombie fan club knew about the game until

[15:24] after Pinniside did.

[15:26] Yeah, I was sold out already.

[15:27] Yeah, so it's like sold out twice.

[15:30] Then I want to say, oh, God, not that many people dropped out from the first 300,

[15:35] even like the complaints about some of the artwork.

[15:38] Yeah, it was like less than maybe around like 20 to 30 at most, I want to say.

[15:42] Not that many, yeah.

[15:44] And then so it's like, okay, why didn't you sell 600?

[15:46] But the thing is, you know, Chuck is being realistic about how many he can build.

[15:50] Here's the key factor in the time he has with license because licenses are more so about time

[15:56] than units.

[15:57] Right. And I'm sure two like you guys want to you guys want to build Rob Zombie for three,

[16:02] four years, you know, you want to you want to move on to your next and I think it's I think

[16:06] you guys I really do think you've found I do think there's some money on the table you guys are

[16:12] leaving. But I think that's fine because I think you guys are you it's it's always better to have

[16:16] much more demand and supply. Yeah, are you?

[16:21] Yeah, I can't I can't really speak to Chuck's decisions on Rob Zombie, but I will say that if I

[16:26] do another game with spooky, I will just I'll just jack up the price of thousand bucks.

[16:31] I already told Chuck that I've said that in interviews because I'm like, hey, let's just jack up the

[16:35] price and we'll split it. Well, I mean, that's my decision to make. You know, Chuck, if Chuck is

[16:42] happy with this profit, but now from zombie, that's great. But he lives in rural Wisconsin. He's not

[16:46] going to a rubah three times a year. Right. You know, that's good for him. But another 300,000

[16:50] dollars, you know, get you a really nice pool and a big house there. So no, but also not

[16:58] in greedy keeps your games at a reasonable price and makes your customers happy because you're

[17:04] giving the value to the customers not keeping it for yourself. Yeah, you're right. I mean,

[17:09] looking at the resell value of things like AMH $6000 does seem pretty cheap, but the thing is you'll

[17:15] definitely sell out. And, you know, you keep people happy. Whereas if he tries to raise a price,

[17:21] the highest point where he can get it to, it might not be so stable. Right. No, I completely agree.

[17:27] I mean, I see both sides of it. And, you know, I think there's it's going to be interesting to see

[17:32] what the second hand market on Rob Zombie is. And I think we'll probably see that pretty quickly

[17:37] after pin start shipping because I think a few people, you I think you'd be a dope if you were on

[17:43] the pre-order list to not just get it. You know, I mean, I get the whole giving it my place in line

[17:49] for someone. Oh, I thought of wanting when AMH without about 10 units. I thought about buying one

[17:53] just to flip. I'll be honest. I was going to go in on my hats. I was going to go in a number 150

[17:58] at expo. And I'm like 16 grand. I'm like, but that was for a good cause. So I'm glad you guys did

[18:02] that. That was that was really awesome thing. Yeah, I didn't I did not think it would get that much.

[18:06] That was pretty cool. I mean, you give enough, you know, people are drinking. You're around a

[18:10] bunch of collectors. I mean, anything can happen. You know, it's it wasn't it wasn't $16,000

[18:15] past. It was actually all the money passed the right. So we put our profit into the donation as

[18:23] well. Right. That was great. So in terms of like Rob Zombie, you're what what what what are you

[18:29] working on with that game? So you're not coding it. Did you were you involved with what what what

[18:34] how were you involved with Rob? So yeah, let's see Rob Zombie Rob Zombie Rob Zombie started.

[18:41] Well, of course, you know, it was based off the pinball zombie games that Chuck did. But

[18:46] it was about one year ago that we got the license, I want to say.

[18:51] And so originally we were talking about rules and Chuck and I came up with an original concept

[18:57] for the for the rules or the story. And unfortunately, that's not the one they went with.

[19:05] My original pitch was that you're like a new Rody working for Rob Zombie. And it turns out that

[19:10] all these creatures are actually real, you know, kind of like monster squad or toyster or anything.

[19:16] And it's like, you think you can be my tour manager, be it the super based. That's kind of what I was

[19:21] pitching. Right. And the mode progression would be like Rody, sound guy, lights guy and then

[19:27] the top would be wizard mode, be like tour manager. But then Rob wanted it to be just more like,

[19:32] you know, like more about the horror like in the stories themselves, like not like a meta band game.

[19:38] And that that's cool, you know, because then that basically allowed us to make like a really

[19:42] bloody violent horror game with lots of blood. And now that we have a color display, we can make

[19:50] the blood even bloodier. Yay. Right. So yeah. So, you know, early on, I was coming up with some

[19:57] rule, rule ideas that ultimately didn't work out for the game. So what my role became was basically,

[20:04] I'm kind of like the system engineer for it. The code on America's most haunted. Like if you

[20:12] look at the source code, it's a fricking mess, right? Because there's a cobble together. So for

[20:16] Rob Zombie, we actually took all that. We made it into proper libraries and whatnot for development.

[20:20] That way we could give it to the new guy, David, the programmer. So he could take the ball and run with it.

[20:26] And I mean, originally Chuck asked me to program it. But looking back now, if I had to program the

[20:31] rules and do all like the base system stuff that I've had to do, it just would have been impossible.

[20:36] So it's been it's worked out. For music pins to have like a narrative. And it sounded like you're

[20:44] trying to create that with like the the young Rodi trying to make his way to the top. I always whenever I

[20:50] play like pins like Metallica, ACDC, I'm always like, well, I don't like there's like modes based

[20:54] around songs and everything. But you know, there's not really like the like a narrative the way there

[21:00] is with like a movie theme or a story we're familiar with. That is definitely a challenge when you're

[21:07] working with that. And I think, you know, that's actually kind of one of the reasons I kind of found

[21:12] pinball interesting back in the 90s is I was I was really intrigued by the fact that they were

[21:18] using this arbitrary ball flying around a piece of wood to tell a story a narrative, you know.

[21:24] And I thought that was kind of abstract and interesting. That's that's why I was interested in

[21:28] pinball. Originally, I remember playing like back the future and you know, some of the early,

[21:32] why not early, but like the early 90s data East games. And yeah, I mean, I I definitely had that

[21:39] approach to the merges most haunted where I wanted to be really story driven. And I thought that

[21:44] it would be really interesting if you use the story to drive the rules. And when you get into a

[21:50] music pin, it is a lot more arbitrary. And again, I wasn't really involved with the rules for

[21:56] Rob Zombie. So I didn't have to think about it that much. But if I would have had to, yeah, as I

[22:01] mentioned, I, you know, in my brain, I'm immediately like, okay, I got to find a story to this.

[22:06] Like monster bash is a really good example. If you look at monster bash, it was like, oh,

[22:11] look, we had the license to all these monsters, right? From universal, how do we tie them together?

[22:16] And the monsters are not tied together in any intrinsic way. You know, they're random monsters.

[22:21] I know universal is trying to make a stupid shared universal to all them, but non-muffstanding that.

[22:26] And I think it was really a masterstroke in that game that they're like, well, what if all the

[22:30] monsters were in a band? Now, if you think about that now, like the kind of reaction that must

[22:35] have got that, I mean, that's a really insane idea. It's really blue sky stuff. Like now we're,

[22:41] now we think it's obvious because we've had that game, you know, around for like 18 years,

[22:44] but back in the day, I would have been like, what? They're on a patient. So it's a way that's

[22:48] eye everything together. It's a commonality that gives all the modes of glue.

[22:52] Right. I think if you announced that if that game never existed and you announced you're

[22:56] going to have those characters and they were going to be in a band, Pinside, which is absolutely

[23:02] lose its shit and demand that something else happened in the game. But there's something to think

[23:09] about on that note. Again, if you look at the tide, those from like the late 90s, they're all,

[23:14] I would consider monster bash a fairly original theme because none of the universal monsters are

[23:19] original. It's universal interpretations of the monsters that are original. Like Frank, Frank

[23:24] Einstein is out of copyright, but if you make a Frankenstein with bolts coming out of his neck,

[23:28] then that's the universal Frankenstein, whereas you are on a capriot. But it's still, you know,

[23:32] those are old stories. They're all pretty generic. But those games even, you know, those games weren't

[23:38] super high sellers, but it's the fact that we've been enjoying them for nearly 20 years. That creates

[23:44] the license and the value. Or I guess you look at medieval madness is basically an unlicensed

[23:49] money Python game. But still, you know, it's the the cache of the enjoyment of those titles have

[23:56] created a license. Right. Like if we were to make a follow up to Merge's most haunted, which we've

[24:01] discussed, it that would not be an original game because we're using the cache of the first game

[24:08] to justify a second one. So it's people's enjoyment and, you know, memories of a certain title that

[24:14] actually creates like the value and the nostalgia. Have you ever thought about when we think about

[24:21] like the story and progressing through a pin? Having more of like a linear progression through the

[24:27] narrative, the way like a video game, like a middle gear solid, where everyone's sort of experiencing

[24:32] the same sort of linear path to get to the end. And it might, you could have the scoring go on

[24:38] throughout that narrative that could make it interesting. But it, I don't know if it's going to

[24:43] become completely linear though. I mean, even something like America's most haunted, it's more like

[24:47] mega man. We're like, okay, now I'm going to beat defeat this ghost boss. And if I defeat them all,

[24:53] I get to Dr. Wiley. So I think, I don't know, I think you're kind of, you kind of almost have to

[24:59] be a little bit more abstract. It's like as long as a player is shooting something, something is

[25:03] progressing, you kind of have to keep that. Okay. I mean, there are games that are, you know,

[25:08] incredibly linear. But I don't know if it would work in pinball. I mean, we have definitely tried to

[25:14] apply video game principles to Americans, but on it and Rob Zombie has it as well. I wish every

[25:21] and this is just me because I don't want to read like pages and pages of PDFs and rule sets

[25:25] before playing a pinball machine. I really wish though there was a way, the what, you know,

[25:30] when you start a video game, like a modern one and you go through that little bit of a tutorial,

[25:35] what you need to do. Oh, you're crawling over the logs and jumping over things. Like why? I just

[25:40] played Game of Thrones early all weekend and there's like seven houses that choose from you.

[25:48] The whole time we were having fun. We had no idea what we were doing and it'd be great if there

[25:53] was like a tutorial mode that would actually be like, talk to you and show on the screen. Welcome

[25:57] to like this is what you need to do with House Greyjoy. Yeah. The Neo Geo games had that back

[26:02] in the 90s, remember? Right. And these are like, here's like a jump, here's like a shoot.

[26:08] I think that for the casual person that even walks up to a pinball machine, it is impossible to

[26:17] figure out what to do with these new machines and even for guys that played a lot, the learning

[26:24] curve that just figured these things out are just getting so complex that I wish there was like,

[26:28] even if it was, you know, you really have to own a game or have one near you to like have any

[26:33] chance of knowing what to do. Well, even I've only, and I've only learned the rings for a year

[26:39] and more than a year now. And I'm I think I finally got it all down because you just, you,

[26:46] there's just new things you're learning all the time and you know, in terms of now with the games

[26:50] like, how you stack stuff and I mean Game of Thrones is, is a ton of fun, but it is definitely a pin

[26:58] that you're going to need to spend so much time like a game like Waz or Hobbit with all the LCD

[27:05] information. Do you feel that helps with that problem? Well, you know, it's it's it's I don't, you

[27:11] know, I don't I haven't played enough Waz. I've played, you know, enough Hobbit now just to

[27:19] get a sense of what they're going for with the screens. I don't know. I think when there's

[27:23] too much to look at, I don't like it. I think Hobbit and Waz look amazing, but I looked at a still

[27:29] screenshot of the Hobbit LCD and there's like eight things happening at once on the screen. And I'm

[27:35] sure like once you own it though, right, you know exactly where to look when to look and and you

[27:41] get trained on how to look at that kind of display. But coming from the DMD world, that's a huge

[27:50] sort of learning curve for I think people that are used to just seeing all right, I just started

[27:55] this mode and I'm seeing one thing with maybe a countdown clock of what I need to do and then I'm

[28:00] just looking for the flashing lights on the play field. There's just so much going on in in in Hobbit.

[28:06] But again, like I think it'll all be second nature once people spend a ton of time with it and and

[28:11] learn how to look and when to look, you know, yeah, you should tell the player what to do. Like you

[28:16] should flash a light, have a voice prompt and show it on the screen like three three ways like, you

[28:23] know, just really hit him over the head with it. And then one thing actually we added it pretty

[28:27] late on in America's most haunted was the ghost minions like just bashing the center targets.

[28:34] And I would call that the dumb dumb shot. It's like, okay, if you just walk up to the game, what is the

[28:38] most obvious thing to hit? The ghost and the three targets. Okay, make some sort of simple mode

[28:44] progression happen. If if that's all the player does, they will feel like they have accomplished.

[28:49] I mean, like something will progress, you know, I think every, I have to do that just to make an

[28:54] easy progression, although it's not a deep progression. Now, but every pen needs that because I

[28:58] think that's why when you look at stuff like the walking dead and Metallica, I mean, it's so obvious,

[29:03] you just shoot up the center and there's a magnet there. Just hit hit Sparky, you know, just to get

[29:09] into the game. I think when games don't have that, it's a lot harder to sort of invite people in.

[29:16] And, you know, I was just playing the hobbit a lot and I, you know, I hope like the flipper

[29:23] strength can go up and the game speed increases and then when the pitch is right and everything.

[29:28] But when you, if you just look at the play field, it's not, you know, in terms of what the shoot

[29:32] and are there interesting shots. I think, you know, we'll see if when people get that into their

[29:36] home collections, if they find the shots to be that rewarding versus like the Ghostbusters, even

[29:41] just the leak of the Ghostbusters CAD design. It looks like there's going to be a lot of fun and

[29:46] interesting things to shoot at because I think it did in a day of pinball machine needs to be fun.

[29:49] I think you need to look down to like, oh, it looks like it would be really fun to shoot there,

[29:53] shoot over there. I can't wait to see what happens and the ball goes over here or travels around this

[29:57] area. That, yeah, it needs, it needs obvious for people. I mean, I, what, like,

[30:06] theater of magic with the trunk, which is probably like the best toy ever in a game going back to

[30:10] J-pop. It's like, look, there's this thing that rotates and oh, now there's a magnet. Now there's a

[30:15] hole like I should shoot this. And you know, it kind of almost becomes a joke. Shoot for the magic

[30:20] trunk, but you at least know what to do. Right. So let's, let's, let's talk about one more subject,

[30:27] then I'll let you, let you go and we'll hopefully we can do this again because what I want to do is

[30:32] when there's interesting topics on Pinside happening, hopefully I can give you a call and we can

[30:36] discuss it because I know that people definitely find these conversations more enjoyable than,

[30:43] than just crazy, canator, ranting, drunken, noralean. So it goes, it goes back to what you say. I mean,

[30:49] you shouldn't create an vacuum and you shouldn't podcast in a vacuum. Right. Right. Well, it's,

[30:54] you know, what I really wanted to do to is get other just collectors and guests on and yeah,

[30:59] it'll be a mix. I mean, sometimes I'm just going to see stuff and I'll put up my commentary on

[31:03] and other times I want to have people on and ideally I'd like to get even, you know, let's take

[31:08] Hobbit, for example, I'd love to get someone who's pre-ordered the Hobbit to talk about why they love

[31:13] it and love to get someone who bowed out of it after playing it at a show and have have those guys

[31:19] talk about why they're making those decisions because I that kind of back and forth, which makes

[31:24] Pinside interesting and entertaining. It's not really captioning the podcast. I feel like I

[31:29] don't all the podcasts everyone's just always loving everything. But what I want to talk about

[31:33] just innovation in games and one area in particular, when do you think games are actually going to

[31:40] get connected and to each other? And we've, we've, I've heard there, oh, you mean over the internet?

[31:46] Over the internet. You know, when are we going to, when is my Lord the Rings or, you know, my

[31:51] Rob Zombie? When is that going to be connected to the other 300 Rob Zombies so people can

[31:57] can play and play? I have this, it'd be awesome if they could play each other in real time so

[32:02] you're seeing your opponent score go as you're going and just trying to figure out if you're doing

[32:08] back to the Neo Geo. You had those memory cards you could stick in and like have your progress.

[32:14] Yeah, I mean, I think you'd have to figure out some sort of assistance. It's really kind of

[32:17] ridiculous that we don't have that. I mean, everyone and I mean, everyone has a smartphone now.

[32:22] It's like, why can't you set the smartphone down on the game and use the NFC to log yourself in,

[32:26] for instance, have some sort of app on your phone to keep the scores up to date.

[32:31] I mean, the first thing I would jump to mind is like, maybe this one sort of attack vector.

[32:35] That's why they don't hook the games up to the internet. But then you've had like internet connected

[32:39] John Madden and golden T games for like what 10 years now? So it can't be impossible.

[32:45] I mean, how can we not make an $8,000 toy not have the connectivity of a $400 council?

[32:53] You know, so it takes X amount of time to program a game. It's going to take X plus Y in order

[33:00] to have the internet connectivity to it. And I think the thing is, I mean, I guess you maybe get

[33:06] like a persistent overall, almost like a maybe like a progressive nationwide jackpot,

[33:12] which sounds like some sort of car insurance ad. You know, it's like, you know, here are the

[33:16] nation's top players. So when you're not just playing against people who are on the game itself,

[33:20] you're playing against everyone in the world. And maybe there's like a certain log in you have.

[33:24] Who knows? Maybe you can set you again. Well, here's the thing I would do. I'm like, if

[33:30] what's this room with Pat Waller's dialed in game where like calls your cell phone or something like that?

[33:36] I was joking with their friend in the night. I'm like, the game's going to call you and tell you that

[33:41] it's it's non-refundable. But like, yeah, I don't know how to connect to your cell phone. I mean,

[33:47] it's it's we'll see. I mean, a computer could call your cell phone. I just I don't understand

[33:54] really have to create all the ball and then pick up your phone. And I mean, we'll see. I mean,

[33:59] that when that when that when that. No, I would do. I would just make it like if you want someone to

[34:03] put like a pinball machine in an airport, you play the game. It charges your phone. You know, give

[34:09] the player something for it. You know, like, you know, there's a piece of glass there. You can

[34:13] NFC through glass like put some sort of RFI well to RFID, but you know, put some sort of NFC

[34:19] communication device in the apron so you can talk to your phone like it's like that the dialed in

[34:25] concept. If it's if it's true, it must be true. It was taken off pinside. But I could like

[34:33] oh, smartphones are popular. Let's make a game about smartphones. It's like, no, you need to make

[34:38] something that interacts with smartphones like smartphones are almost like someone having money

[34:43] in their pocket or a key chain. It's like this ubiquitous thing that everyone has now. You don't

[34:48] need to concentrate on the fact that they have it. You need to integrate with it. Like, you know,

[34:52] they can take the experience with them or like this is their universal log in or who knows? Maybe

[34:56] this, you know, you could charge Google wallet. You don't need to put coins in the machine. Like,

[34:59] it could charge your Google wallet. Right. I mean, I don't really think they're far enough with it.

[35:04] I mean, there's so far you could go with the technology. I thought it'd be super cool too,

[35:08] because I one of my favorite Neo Geo games is bus to move, right? With puzzle Bobo. It's called a

[35:13] lot of different names where you're like, I had the puzzle Bobo one. Yeah, that was a,

[35:19] whenever we had our drunken parties, everyone loved that one. That Neo turf master is awesome.

[35:24] You're right. And you're lining up three colored balls. And you want to get more than three to

[35:28] drop down and that'll send over balls to the person playing next to you. But it'd be so cool. Imagine,

[35:33] imagine a versus pinball machine where you could put it in versus mode where you're playing live

[35:38] against someone. And depending on how you're doing, you know, you could steal someone's ball away

[35:43] like in the middle of their multi ball or you could, you could, you could make it so like one of

[35:47] their flipper stop working for five seconds. As you know, you're like battling each other. How would

[35:51] you know that someone's on the other end? Well, it would have to connect like almost the way,

[35:57] you know, mad and sparks. Yeah, like, oh, it's like, when playing battlefront right now,

[36:01] yeah, you're now you're now connected to another player with this machine and and you're,

[36:06] you're connected in a versus mode, right? And they could change the whole dynamic of how

[36:12] that that thing that, you know how, you know, of course, you know, who Nolan Bushnell is.

[36:17] Right. But if his ideas was that was a you wink media bistro, you remember hearing about that?

[36:22] No. It was like some sort of like bar slash cafe. And I think it was like, you know,

[36:27] San Jose or something. And it was like, every table had like some sort of interconnected game to it.

[36:33] So you could play a game on your table and they would interact with someone across the room.

[36:38] So you could kind of use it. I guess you could use it as like digital flirting maybe.

[36:42] And we've kind of lost that in the war. Like, you know, we could have aliens in Vader right now

[36:48] in the sky. And no one would see it because they're all looking at their cell phones. It's like,

[36:52] maybe what we had to do is like, you know, just use the games as a way to get people to interact

[36:56] more. I don't know if it would work across like just instances, but

[37:01] yeah, no, it's just be cool. I think, you know, I think it's definitely going to come one day where

[37:07] you're going to you're going to have machines connected. And then probably be a forward facing camera

[37:11] as well that so you can see the person that you're you're playing a game. Oh, you could,

[37:15] you could maybe it's like for an extra quarter, you could upload it to YouTube and me I could

[37:20] let's react to video to Lvira 3. Right. Then the main challenge would be how do you prevent people

[37:27] from tampering when you're playing against someone right? So you'd have to detect that the glass was

[37:33] on and that the pitch was, you know, because you could that because you can't you can't really modify

[37:39] your your Xbox to give you an advantage in in Madden or when you're playing like

[37:44] Street Fighter online. I don't know about head to head though because I mean you're talking about

[37:50] a $400 game console, the $60 game in it versus a $7,000 machine that someone else

[37:57] has been playing at the same time. I don't know if the market is saturated enough to actually have

[38:01] enough live competition. What's that game? Have you ever played Capcom's flipper football?

[38:07] That was I think their last game before they won under that was a pen flipper football. Yeah and

[38:16] the football has in soccer. Okay, you know, I've never never played that. Okay, so I want to say

[38:24] that when they're going under or in the last year of life, Capcom was like let's make flipper football,

[38:33] a game about soccer and releasing in America. That was a better idea apparently than Big Bang Bar.

[38:40] And obviously it wasn't and there's not a whole lot of them in there, maybe a thousand,

[38:43] but you can achieve them pretty cheaply. And it's a kind of the game where like okay, yeah,

[38:48] I can see why this bomb, you know, it was a it was a soccer game in America in 1996. It's all green,

[38:54] you know, the cursed pinball color. But if you're at a party and you're playing it, you can play it

[39:00] in like three groups of three groups of two. It's super fun. Right. Because it's like competitive.

[39:06] So it's weird if you look at it, it's like, you know, if this was in the right situation,

[39:10] if this was like in a bar where all you did was play this, this was what I was going to go over super

[39:16] well. But as a standalone unit, this doesn't really work. So I don't think it's necessarily just

[39:21] connecting pinball machines. But if you were to connect pinball machines, you have to connect a

[39:25] pinball machine with the right type of theme that lends itself to connectivity.

[39:29] Right. Why?

[39:30] I think a whole game or something. Well, the midway point would have been if they actually made that

[39:35] total recall pinball machine right where you'd be standing right next to someone and you'd be

[39:41] battling that way sort of. Oh, yeah. They game almost looked like kind of a mute like it was growing

[39:46] off the side of another game. All right. Yeah, how's there? Then I appreciate you taking the time.

[39:54] And hopefully we can do this again real soon because I know the community does not want to hear

[39:57] me all the time by myself. And hopefully I can pick your brain when there's some fun topics to talk

[40:02] about. There's plenty of people who can talk to me. I think the idea of just like, you know,

[40:07] randomly interviewing pin-siders who are willing to go on the show like, you know, Tiger Long,

[40:11] why not? It's really cool because people can kind of put in a voice and an identity behind

[40:16] these people they see. Well, do me a favor because I know why Snow said he'll join. So I want to

[40:22] definitely get him on and talking. It's funny because he's like, I don't have much to talk about.

[40:26] I'm like, man, you you took all day log on pitside. You got to play. You can just have

[40:32] a different entire conversation with Y Snow about why there should be all four scores on the screen

[40:38] at all times. That's the big thing. Right. Right. You know, if you talk to him, you should talk

[40:44] about turning stuff because he's really big in a tournament stuff. And he gave us really good ideas

[40:48] for our game. Like, here's what turning players want. So I don't know. That's the thing. Everyone

[40:54] has a cross to bear. It is like turning stuff, turning stuff and operator stuff. So talk to him about

[40:58] that. Okay. Good. Good suggestions. All right. Ben. Well, thank you so much. Have safe travels

[41:03] back. And I really appreciate you for joining. Can it is pinball podcast and we'll talk soon.

[41:11] Sounds good. Have fun. All right. Ben. All right. There we are. Our interview with Ben Hick. I had

[41:17] a cut out about a half hour. We went off on some crazy tangents about 80s movies and remakes and

[41:24] stuff like the rocket tier and how it should have been set in World War II error. But we won't go

[41:29] there. I want to give you guys just most of the pinball stuff we talked about. And look, if you

[41:35] want to be a guest on his pinball podcast, just hit me up. Canada pinball K and EDA pinball
