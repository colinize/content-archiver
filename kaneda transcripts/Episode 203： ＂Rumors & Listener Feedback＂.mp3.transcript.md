[00:00] Is there any better feeling than waking up on a Friday morning?

[00:29] Or staring at the weekend?

[00:31] And there's a new episode of Canatus Pimball Podcasts ready for you to download and listen to.

[00:36] So welcome to episode 203 of Canatus Pimball Podcasts.

[00:40] Here's what we're going to do in this podcast.

[00:41] I want to go over just a few Pimball news items, but then I want to read some of the feedback I've

[00:47] been getting from people out there who listen to the show. I haven't done this in a while,

[00:53] so I want to go down. I'm just going to actually open up emails and read what people have said.

[00:58] Because some of what I've been podcasting of late has led you guys to react.

[01:05] And not everybody agrees with me, which is good. I don't want everyone to think that everything I say

[01:11] is always spot on. I do make mistakes, and I own up to those mistakes when I do make them.

[01:16] And I change my mind sometimes in the world of Pimball.

[01:20] All right. First, I want to say I'm actually excited because the guys over at Slamtilt Podcast

[01:26] actually talked about this podcast winning the Twippy. They still didn't explain why they left

[01:33] that category out when they went down the list of shows. They also said that they stopped listening

[01:40] to this show because they thought I was a little crazy. Well, look, I'm glad they do what they do.

[01:49] I support all Pimball Podcasts, but it was nice that we finally got a little bit of recognition,

[01:53] and even if not all recognition, but I do appreciate that they said thank you for the win.

[01:58] All right. So on my last podcast, I've been opening up the thread and I saw there was even more

[02:05] discussion around Deeproot Pimball. And here's the deal. Here's the deal. We have 18 months to go

[02:12] before the delivery date of Deeproot's machines. And the debate really now falls along this path.

[02:21] You either say to yourself, why is anybody angry? They haven't taken anyone's money. Let's see

[02:27] how things pan out. Okay. The other side of the debate is, are you kidding me? We shouldn't let

[02:34] these guys be in the Pimball community because they're partnering with J-Pop who has destroyed and

[02:41] hurt a lot of the goodwill in the hobby. Okay. Now my overall opinion about the whole thing is this.

[02:49] As I said on my last podcast, getting something is better than nothing. I think everyone who lost

[02:56] money, they were never going to see a raza or an Alice in Wonderland ever. So these guys doing this

[03:02] to try and get those games out. I don't applaud it, but I also think it's the best chance you got.

[03:09] I also think that nothing anyone does will negatively impact or shut down this company's attempts

[03:16] to make this stuff happen. So it's funny how sometimes we like to think that if we are screaming

[03:23] on a forum, that somehow that's going to hurt a company's business abilities. It's not like

[03:30] highway Pimball. So highway Pimball needs money. They need money badly. Deeproot Pimball,

[03:35] they seem to be health-healthily self-financed by Robert Mueller. And I don't think anyone can

[03:44] look at what's going on there though and say because he's got Dennis Nordman, you know,

[03:49] Barrio and John Norris, that's a sign that things must be great over there. As crazy levee said,

[03:54] or someone said, look at Dennis Nordman and highway Pimball would happen once he left that place or

[03:59] once he joined highway Pimball. All of these dudes need paychecks. They need paychecks. They don't

[04:05] make much money. I think people fail to realize that Pimball designers are not making six-figure plus

[04:12] salaries. Maybe a couple do and their names are like Pat Lawler, but for the most part, for the most

[04:19] part, Dennis Nordman, Barrio, John Norris, when it comes to Pimball, they need paychecks. They're not

[04:26] collecting like royalties on old machines that they made. They need money. So look, we are all now

[04:34] in a wait and see pattern. Well, wait and see what happens. I don't know when we'll hear from them

[04:41] again. We might see them at TPS. Again, I invite Robert and anyone over there to come on the show and

[04:46] talk about how they're going to actually make this happen. Because to me, the main question I have

[04:51] is how are they going to make multiple games within 18-month period. Games that have not yet been

[04:57] coded, games that need a lot of mechanical help, and games that also have legal issues associated

[05:03] with them. But it's not just the J-Pop games. Remember, they've got three other designers that are

[05:08] working on games as well. Lots of excitement, lots more skepticism, and many more questions about

[05:17] deep-rood Pimball. I don't know if you guys saw, but there's actually Skitbee Pimball. Their website

[05:24] is live again, which must mean that things might have taken a turn for the better. I actually

[05:28] encourage all you guys to go to SkitbeePimball.com and just see, this is probably the final

[05:35] result of this whole fiasco. I think it's a fitting end to Skitbee Pimball. What's on their website

[05:41] right now? All right. I've been reading the Attack from R's remake thread. It seems like most

[05:50] people are enjoying their Attack from R's remakes. There are some people that are having some quality

[05:55] issues with their games. I've been reading about the plastics. Some people are having problems with

[06:00] them cracking. Some people's the bolts on the side of the cabinet have been coming loose, which

[06:05] has caused the play field to drop into the game, which is never good. But for the most part,

[06:12] for the most part, the people are kind of asking themselves, what will the long-term reliability be

[06:18] of people who go in on these new remakes? Will the remakes hold up as well as the older versions

[06:25] of the games impossible? Impossible for anyone to predict yes or no. We know that the old games

[06:34] have been around for 20 plus years, so we have that. But look, over at Chicago Gaming, Doug over

[06:41] there, they've been very, very good on handling all customer complaints and quality issues, and they

[06:49] have been very quick to respond with fixes and to get people what they need. Okay? And that's a good

[06:55] sign. I think the other side of the coin, whenever we think about supporting these new Boutique

[07:00] companies, it's not just will I get my game, is will I have support going into the future? And if you

[07:06] don't, it's like not even worth owning a machine that you're nervous about long-term support,

[07:13] because then you don't want to play it. Because if something breaks, there's no one there to help.

[07:17] And there's nothing worse than having a machine in your home that is not functioning. It is the

[07:22] most frustrating thing. All right. Speaking of sending people parts and responding to people on time

[07:29] and being a good customer service, a good communicating company, we have to talk about what happened

[07:37] at Highway Pimball, and one of their customers over there has been waiting for a really long time

[07:43] for his alien parts to come in. Now this gentleman, his name's T. Diddy, I believe, on Pinside.

[07:51] He bought one of the original Highway Pimball alien machines from Andrew Highway before

[07:57] he stepped down from the company, and he's been waiting for the fix. Okay? So there's things like

[08:02] the scoop, there's things like the computer PCB, there's things like the cables, the alien head

[08:09] wasn't working. So all these things he needed to make his game function properly. So what happens?

[08:15] This guy gets a box in the mail with supposedly all the parts he needs. Okay? And it's an interesting

[08:23] photo. It's all these cables. There's computer components. There's an alien head. It's all just thrown

[08:30] into a box. Okay? Now you would think that over at Highway Pimball, the everything, every single

[08:40] sort of shipment that goes out to customers would be triple checked. You would think that they

[08:46] would really ensure that when this arrives, are we confident that this buyer has everything he needs

[08:55] to install the parts that he will not say anything negative about our company because we know

[09:03] right now we're in this sensitive area where every word of mouth, every feedback we get is going to

[09:10] either instill confidence in us moving forward or make more people run for the hills. And so what

[09:17] happens? The box comes in and they didn't package the alien head properly. So it broke. It broke.

[09:24] He waited months and the thing breaks when it arrives. And then in addition, he's got this box

[09:30] of parts and there's no instructions on what to do with anything. And look, it's not as easy as

[09:37] like here's the new scoop here, you know, replace it with the old scoop. He's got all these cables

[09:42] and computer parts and he doesn't know what goes where. And I think that is just crazy town

[09:48] that nobody at Highway Pimball thought, hey, maybe we need to give instructions on how to install

[09:55] all this stuff and maybe someone should sit with an old machine and itemize out. Here's the

[10:02] here's the steps you need to take to go from this to this. Nope, they didn't do that. And again,

[10:08] it's it's it's really unfortunate because I think these guys need to be more careful on everything

[10:15] they do. Every move they make is going to be under a microscope and we all know why. All right.

[10:21] Well, there's nothing really new going on in the Sternworld. So what Sternworld and and

[10:25] elsewhere. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to talk about rumors I'm hearing that are

[10:30] very, very sort of they're coming from very credible sources and you can take it or leave it. We're

[10:35] going to call those Kandados rumor zone brought to you by Nifty LEDs. You know, I'm going to start

[10:43] just making up Pimball companies that sponsor segments of this show because I never do get any

[10:48] sponsors. So I'm just going to do it like I'm just going to randomly pick different Pimball companies.

[10:52] So rumor number one, I'm hearing that there has been a divide or a a parting of people

[11:02] over at spooky Pimball between Charlie and family and someone else who has been part of the spooky

[11:08] movement since day one who you all know very well. I'm heard they are going separate ways. So that

[11:15] is interesting and in terms of why that's happening and what caused that I'm curious to learn more

[11:21] about it. But that is what I'm hearing. Another rumor, I'm hearing that we might actually see

[11:28] two Stern titles arrive at the same time that it might not just be one new game we might say. We

[11:35] might see two. And if you were to think about which two games could those be, I mean the two that

[11:41] I'm seeing he talked about the most are Iron Maiden and Deadpool. So we know that that's happening.

[11:49] I also know that there is an image of Deadpool that's going around and I know this because people

[11:54] have hit me up and asked me if I want to see it and they share you know people are sharing it. It's

[11:59] why it's it's kind of like one of those Ghostbusters Translate LED images. It wasn't just the LED.

[12:05] It was the Ghostbusters Translate. But anyway, that inner circle of people are sharing the

[12:11] Deadpool image. Now I'm always shocked that nobody takes an image like that and just throws it up onto

[12:19] you know like maybe throw it up onto Rex Games Pimball with an anonymous Gmail account and just let

[12:25] people see it. See I always think it's annoying that there is that like all these little people

[12:30] sharing everything. No look I'm not sharing anything. If you share something with me that is I

[12:35] that is sensitive that people can't see I'm not sharing it. I'm not sharing it okay. But I'm just

[12:40] saying I hear it's floating around. So which means Deadpool is pretty much confirmed which we all know.

[12:46] I mean no there's no stern coming out that we don't all know. We know that Deadpool, Iron Maiden,

[12:52] monsters and beetles are going to be the four titles we see from Stern Pimball with the possibility

[12:58] maybe of another vault edition but I doubt it. Elvira is way way way in the past and now Elvira

[13:05] is a big question mark because of Dennis Norman going to deep route. All right the rumor that

[13:10] Lyman Sheets is retiring. I started that rumor. I heard it from people. I got no one else to say

[13:15] otherwise. We want to congratulate this is not part of the rumors this is actually the truth. I want

[13:21] to congratulate Tim Sexton on becoming a new employee over at Stern and a code engineer. I think

[13:28] that is awesome Tim Balls congratulations. We are I'm always very happy to see someone who loves

[13:34] Pimball so much to actually make a career out of it. I think that's incredible. All of us wish we

[13:40] could work on the thing that we would we would do for free and I think that's incredible. So Tim I look

[13:46] forward to seeing what you do over at Pimball sorry at Stern. I hope this means you can still go on

[13:53] podcast and talk about what's going on behind the closed doors at Stern. All right what else is going

[13:58] on in terms of the rumor mail. You guys all know like the rumor titles for Jersey Jack it's nothing new

[14:04] I do think the rumor of Toy Story being after Pirates or the Caribbean has to be a little bit of

[14:11] a thorn in the side of Jersey Jack because again it's like I think people are always like it's

[14:17] almost like they're always waiting for the next Jersey Jack game and I think Pirates is sounds like

[14:24] it's turning out to be a really phenomenal game. I can't wait to play more of it but I think Jack

[14:29] has enough space between titles where it doesn't really matter. You know because I do think if you

[14:34] go on on Pirates you're not going to see Toy Story ship for like at least maybe 18 months maybe

[14:40] you know and then in that case you know that's played by a game play game for a year and a half

[14:45] enjoy the hell out of it and if it's keeper it's a keeper if it's not you could probably sell it

[14:49] and then you can go get Toy Story. I mean we're getting to the point now where all Pimball Machine

[14:53] purchases are like car purchases you're gonna lose like 10 to 20% of what you went in on the game with

[15:00] and and but you could enjoy a Pimball Machine for you know year how many plays is that worth you

[15:07] got to factor that in if you have to go on location and pay money every time you play it you got

[15:11] to play it for free but nothing is truly free you're gonna lose some value on the game itself but

[15:18] that's fine I think people need to approach it without that understanding and and you'll you'll

[15:24] go in and on games the right way you won't be like the guy who buys a Guardians of the Galaxy with

[15:29] 32 plays and sells it for like a $10,000 loss in in a one week of ownership real smart move

[15:36] real smart move him you know especially as a stock market is now it seems to be crashing around us

[15:41] will that hurt Pimball sales I don't know I don't know probably a little bit right I don't know

[15:46] I my money goes to my financial advisor I don't check in on my finances every week I'm in it for

[15:52] the long term I'm not a young I'm young I don't need to look at it every week all right what else

[15:58] is going on in the rumor mail um do do do let's see I'm not hearing any other rumors from American Pimball

[16:06] I'm not hearing any rumors from Dutch Pimball I'm not hearing any other rumors from Chicago gaming

[16:13] so those are like the big ones those are the big ones so take it for what it's worth

[16:18] I'm not confirming or denying any of those rumors they are just what they are all right now let's

[16:24] get to your feedback you have decided that something I said or this show in general has made you

[16:33] want to respond to me and I appreciate that again I implore all of you out there to email me at

[16:39] knadapimball.com with your thoughts on the show with any questions you may have because then you

[16:44] get to have your statements read on air and I don't even read them beforehand I'm going to go down a

[16:51] list from the top to the bottom from most frequent to some things from a maybe like a week ago

[16:57] and I'm going to read your feedback on air right now so let's dive in I'm opening up the mailbox

[17:03] at gmail.com all right my first email is from Gabriel Denonzio we all know Gabe he runs

[17:13] fantastic up there in the New England area he says hey man you say no one ever asks you for

[17:19] marketing help well I am asking you for the third time I want to make you head of fantastic

[17:26] sponsorship marketing join the team man well Gabe thank you thank I know Gabe look Gabe and I

[17:33] have talked for for like it feels like a couple years now about getting people to help sponsor

[17:41] fantastic up in New England and here's the thing about the marketing that I do I don't do

[17:47] sponsorships by that I mean I can't go to my brands that I work with and get them to sponsor

[17:54] events it's not what I do and I'll explain the difference between what I do and people who work

[17:58] on the sponsoring side of marketing a sponsor someone who focuses on sponsorships they have money

[18:06] right they and they they have money to align the brand with different moments and time events what

[18:11] not they then go with the budget they have and they pay to become a sponsor of that event okay so

[18:18] like Bud Light will pay millions of dollars to be a sponsor of the NFL I do earned media okay so

[18:24] earned media means I have to do stuff that earns press coverage I don't have a budget to then go

[18:31] buy media like I don't pay for banner ads I don't pay for ads and newspapers I have to do something

[18:37] like give free Bud Light and fill it out if you did everyone in fillies what we did yesterday

[18:42] and it went amazingly well but we didn't like paid a sponsor that parade we were just in it

[18:48] organically now look Gabe I will happily talk to you about maybe some ideas we can do to create

[18:52] some fun moments in time but my recommendation for all pinball shows from an earn standpoint is I

[18:59] would go to as many of the local media as you can and I would try to get them to write stories about

[19:04] pinball's resurgence the popularity of it I would also try to do the local morning shows because

[19:10] that's like really the key for local market events I bring some pinball machines getting on TV

[19:15] let people know that they can come down with a family and play pinball it's an amazing day you know

[19:20] that's like that's like what I would do from a block and tackle standpoint but Gabe will talk we'll

[19:25] talk because I don't want to leave you hanging all right I got an email from John Gardiner John

[19:30] thank you for listening to Canada's pinball podcast John writes thank you for your podcast I

[19:36] always look forward to them they're often pretty contentious but they're the ones I like best you

[19:41] said you're on your last podcast it would have set us all and get you a flood of complaints

[19:48] well here's a complaint you weren't expecting please stop persisting this myth that the 90s

[19:55] machines are better than anything made since it's a self perpetuating wisdom everybody knows

[20:02] it's true so everybody says it's so everybody knows it's true but really is that why you spend

[20:08] thousands of dollars on your Batman super duper Ellie you bought it because it's a second rate

[20:14] machine and there are far better more fun pins you could have got a whole lot cheaper he's asking

[20:19] a question there do you really did you really make that decision I take the walking dead before

[20:25] any of those 90s machines it's just so much more exciting to play some 90s pinballs are great no

[20:31] doubt about it but to say they're better than anything made today is simply wrong and it denigrates

[20:37] the efforts of every modern pinball manufacturer John Gardner well John thank you I think you said

[20:45] something that has made me think a lot in the last one second no actually I actually read this one

[20:52] last night but John I understand what you're saying and I do understand what you're saying and I

[20:58] you know I was thinking about it and in here's sort of what I think is going on I think from a

[21:02] code standpoint right from from from a games from from being able to play a game with depth there

[21:10] is nothing there is nothing from the 90s that even comes within a country mile of what modern

[21:16] pinball gives you in terms of rule sets and certain in terms of modes in terms of longevity so I

[21:24] agree I agree with you that like the walking dead like horde mode like Batman the game I'm looking

[21:29] at right now what's going on in this game there is there's nothing from a code standpoint that

[21:34] even comes close from anything like Twilight Zone medieval madness any that stuff like attack

[21:39] from Mars maybe it's got really good code but we all agree that pinball machines in the 90s were

[21:45] designed to go into our Cades and to pretty much immediately excite people they weren't designed to

[21:51] be in homes and have people play them for months and explore them for a long period of time but I'll

[21:58] say this when it comes to mechanical engineering of pinball when it comes to shots when it comes to

[22:05] magic of things happening in a game I don't think anything in the modern pinball world even comes

[22:11] close to the level of engineering and the level of satisfaction from the shots themselves that the

[22:18] 90s games provided okay and so that's always been my issue is it's a trade off it's always been a

[22:25] trade off now here's the thing that always angers me about modern pinball why is it that those games

[22:32] from the 90s for like two to three thousand dollars brand new came with so much more mechanical

[22:38] engineering innovation and magic than games that come out now that cost three times as much money

[22:45] and that's what I can't stand about the the promise of modern pinball in being like the best

[22:51] version of pinball because yeah I get it you've used better lights and sounds and code but you

[22:58] also got really freaking cheap on your mechanical engineering of pinball so it just seems like if I put

[23:04] my Batman next to a tails of the Arabian nights and you asked someone like which ones got more

[23:11] engineering wow it totally is tails the Arabian nights which is twenty years prior so I just I

[23:19] just think that modern pinball has created an interesting dilemma and compromise for people look

[23:24] and the one company that I think has tried to do both which is innovate both from a code standpoint

[23:32] and and you know LCD standpoint but also the mechanics was Jersey Jack pinball I would even throw

[23:39] Dutch in but here's the problem is Jersey Jack has not successfully yet sort of made that game

[23:44] and then also had the wow now I think dialed in is probably as close as it gets if you were to

[23:49] ask me like which one game gives you everything I think dialed in is probably the one that looks like

[23:56] it came from the nineties with all the mechanical wow but also has all the modern features and that's

[24:00] that's why I think dialed in unanimously got the most votes at the twippy is because I think people

[24:05] finally said we can do it we can do it um the walking dead yeah I mean look it's I think from a

[24:12] code standpoint but there's a lot of things in the walking dead to me that still feel sort of

[24:15] cheap and like they cut corners and and and you know isn't isn't the full package but I get why

[24:21] people love it from a pinball experience but but again John thank you so much for the email

[24:26] I think I think what you said warns a very healthy discussion I got a very long email I'm

[24:32] gonna paraphrase this email from Tim went and Tim I Tim writes me often and Tim thank you again

[24:38] for listening to the show and and challenging something I said on the show I want to read what Tim

[24:43] wrote he said canada what the f was the last podcast I love the show I was so freaking happy that you

[24:50] won best podcast I love that you speak your mind but w t f with that last episode but it took every

[24:58] ounce of my patience to suffer through it hopefully you'll not take offense at my little rant

[25:04] back at you I'm sure you want your listeners to be truthful with you as you try to be with us

[25:11] so he goes on to say you sound it like an arrogant ass where is the humble positive host I've been

[25:18] called arrogant before and it doesn't suit me so it's better to be humble and he said it was the

[25:23] october fest rant that was really hard to stomach with all of yourself a grand adeisman I I don't

[25:31] use that word but it's a big word I don't think I said it even right he said one of the reasons I

[25:35] love canada is your marketing sense and knowledge I know a little about marketing as intentional

[25:41] as international marketing and brand valuation was the focus of my master's degree I very much

[25:47] agree with your take on many things but occasionally I scratch my head he then goes on to say for

[25:52] example you slam on titles like clean animal house and october fest without gaining any market

[25:58] knowledge or understanding of the demographics associated with these themes you tout themes like

[26:04] big trouble in little china w t f I love that film but it made 11 million at the box office do a

[26:11] little research on clean there are very few brands that cross cut as many demographics as queen

[26:18] animal house is considered to be one of the greatest comedy films of all time all right I love

[26:24] this part where you says I certainly wouldn't have thought to pick october fest as a theme but it

[26:28] draws six million people to a party every year when was the last time a banger six million people to a

[26:35] concert there are october fest all across the world tap her give me a break how many people know

[26:41] about that obscure arcade game sorry but that seemed um that segment of the podcast was silly

[26:47] and self-absorbed all right looking at I love your show and hope that you take at least in open

[26:52] mind to my advice all right first of all Tim thank you thank you thank you thank you I wish I

[26:59] got more emails like this that told me can either you're an idiot what did you say that for think twice

[27:06] but here's my response to Tim first and I wrote back to Tim and I said this I want to tell you what

[27:11] I told Tim first and foremost I don't question queens popularity I do not I don't question whether or

[27:20] not there will be buyers of a clean pinball machine I think queen is a humongous band queen is

[27:26] influence more musicians than almost anybody I love their music do I think a queen pinball machine

[27:32] would sell yes do I think peanut queen is a is a good pinball music act to make a machine on sure

[27:40] what I do question with all the music pins is just like what's the storyline of queen I get it

[27:45] don't don't make something up now look highway pinball is making queen so that to me is the only

[27:51] thing I be worried about if I was a queen fan that if they don't get it right will the people who

[27:57] handle the queen license will they ever be excited about making another music pinball machine

[28:04] around their franchise I don't know so let's just put queen to the side because I think if I said

[28:10] queen wouldn't sell or I'm not interested in queen then yeah I was an idiot and I'm wrong okay now

[28:16] when I said animal house was a stupid theme to create I didn't mean that the John Baluci

[28:22] animal house that we all know in love that is not what I'm talking about the animal house that

[28:29] Andrew highway was making was not that animal house it was like surseys or surcays or whatever

[28:37] animal house go google highway pinball animal house that is the animal house I was shitting on so

[28:43] let's remove that from this argument let's talk about October fest versus big trouble in little

[28:49] china now Tim if you think October fest pinball would sell more than big trouble in little in

[28:58] big trouble in little china I am willing to bet my entire annual salary on the fact that I think

[29:07] big trouble in little china would run circles around October fest in terms of which machine would

[29:13] you buy in fact will somebody please will one of my listeners out there who is on pinside do me a

[29:19] favor will you go to pinside and start a simple poll don't say my name because then the moderators will

[29:26] take the poll down start a poll because Tim you're all about market research let's go right to the

[29:31] market start a poll and ask which pinball machine would you rather own October fest or big trouble

[29:39] in little china and just let people vote let's do that let's not argue it out but here's the thing

[29:46] I told Tim why I think October fest is the dumbest theme for pinball because saying that six

[29:53] million people visit October fest every year and that's why there's popularity and that's why

[29:59] it would make a good pinball theme and that's why it's a better theme than tap or I'll tell you why

[30:04] that doesn't that logic doesn't work just because people visit something doesn't make it a pinball

[30:10] theme people want a hundred million people probably travel to New York City every year does that mean

[30:17] a pinball machine about New York City is a good pinball theme you see it doesn't matter it's just

[30:23] think about it like this pinball machines they should tell a story pinball machines work best

[30:30] with in themes that create like I don't know a lot of energy a lot of enthusiasm a lot of this a lot

[30:35] of that I just think October fest I get it drinking and music and dancing like it it it is what it

[30:43] is but it's an event to drink beer it's not I don't understand why that makes a good pinball theme

[30:48] again I'm not going to argue why I think it's terrible I will go on the record by saying if American

[30:53] pinball makes October fest I think the company could possibly go out of business that's just my

[30:58] opinion if you disagree here's the thing if you think I'm wrong and they make October fest

[31:04] Tim would you buy it I would love to see people actually go buy that title I think they would

[31:09] struggle to sell a couple hundred October fest all right how well did perhaps blue ribbon sell

[31:15] all right or the cancrusher game that they made I'm just saying I'm just saying there's so

[31:21] many better themes out there all right let's go to our next our next email in this canate is

[31:27] Friday email rants all right I got an email from Donzie he said no need to read on air and he said

[31:36] L.O.L. but he said Chris hey just wanted to say thank you I all good stuff said he's in his 40s

[31:43] lives in New Jersey he's been in the hobby for 25 years and he loved episode two oh two where I

[31:48] went off and he said he's in the cars he's a big G&R fan and he's got a nice lineup and he said

[31:56] Philly Philly thanks again well thank you thank you Don I appreciate it I I I really love that

[32:04] so many of you out there are into the same things I'm into it because I I think it goes beyond pinball

[32:09] I think a lot of us are into cars we're into pinball we're in a rock and roll music we're in the

[32:14] movies we're geeks we're freaking nerds you have to be an ultra nerd and an ultra geek to to

[32:21] listen to a pinball podcast the fact that you're spending your free time to listen to a show like

[32:26] this your geek your nerd and look we might have differences but I love you because you're geek

[32:32] and a nerd the the world is dominated by geeks and nerds I don't understand people that are not

[32:38] that don't geek out over stuff I mean how boring would it be to wake up and not geek out over stuff

[32:45] right and that's always the advice I give a lot of my female friends in the world when they're like

[32:49] you know they they get bored I mean become a geek about something you can't spend your whole life

[32:54] just trying to like find a husband and have a family like what makes families awesome is like

[32:59] when there's a lot of stuff for kids to get excited about and kids can't get excited about stuff

[33:04] if their parents aren't geeks and nerds all right let me go down the list of the next email I

[33:10] got see you guys are gonna start writing and I can feel it I got an email from Brad wall this

[33:16] Brad thank you for listening to the show he said bro thanks for putting out your podcast his

[33:21] title here was relax he said I have to say though why the fuck do you get so worked up about these

[33:28] piece of shit pinball companies that can't ship a fucking game by the way I will read your

[33:35] curses out loud on the air so cover your children's ears ladies and gentlemen who cares anymore

[33:42] it's clear that you don't know what the hell they are doing and if anyone sends them money at

[33:47] this point they are clearly idiots fuck highway fuck Dutch etc don't waste your time and energy

[33:55] talking about these clowns well Brad thank you for your very poignant and and and very direct email

[34:05] now look I'll tell you why I talk about these guys because I wouldn't have a show I wouldn't

[34:10] have a show man if I didn't talk about the the the companies in this hobby that we're flailing

[34:16] that we're struggling to get games out I don't think it would be very interesting to talk about

[34:22] just the other companies that are shipping games because here's why let's talk about guardians of

[34:28] the galaxy right now on canators pinball podcasts all right I'm gonna talk about guardians of the

[34:34] galaxy it feels like that's if I were to do that it would feel like that scene in Wayne's world

[34:40] where they're like we're in Delaware right now hi I'm in Delaware hi I'm gonna try and fill a half

[34:47] hour of canators pinball podcasts talking about a pinball machine that's been out for a couple

[34:52] months that has no real code in it and people aren't really enjoying that much I hope you enjoy

[34:59] this podcast see you know I'm saying or I could say hey guys highway pinball shipped a guy his alien

[35:05] head it's freaking broken and what the hell is this company doing you know so it's like I I have to

[35:11] cover them because most of the news is about these companies and they're failure to launch and

[35:18] they're failure to get their games out and the and most of the interesting conversation is happening

[35:25] around the consumers who have been you know dragged over the calls over the years look there's

[35:31] a reason why if you go to any major news site is it all the good news or is it the stuff that's

[35:35] going wrong in the world that people are are tuning into and and maybe it's a little clickbait maybe

[35:41] it's a little listen bait if I if I pick the more dramatic sides of the hobby but like I'm gonna

[35:45] cover it all I'm gonna cover it all I appreciate you listening hopefully you can stomach when I do

[35:52] start to cover some of the the the companies that you say I should move on from all right I got an

[35:58] email from Michael shall this who said and this email is long well I'm not going to read the whole

[36:02] thing so dear Chris or canada um happy 200 I never had any interest in listening to your podcast

[36:10] until you won the trippy award so for those of you think the trippies don't matter here we go I got

[36:15] a new listener because I won the trippy there were this was nothing against you since I never really

[36:20] knew who you were I did hear you on straight down the middle and enjoyed your conversation with

[36:26] Zach and Greg but I had um but I had listened to a couple podcasts from your competitors and found

[36:32] them rather boring so I did not seek your podcast out I also did not know your reputation on

[36:38] Pinside though I have owned at least one Pimble machine since 2008 and during that time I knew

[36:44] about Pinside it was only this year I decided to become a member and follow some of the game threads

[36:50] all right well Michael you know you'll probably hear my name and not so positive context on Pinside

[36:57] but trust me I'm not that bad all right he said he then said then you got the award and decided

[37:03] it and I decided to check you out and I was impressed I was not um stalking you but it does not

[37:09] make much of a search to find out it must be years of marketing pitches that allows you to express

[37:15] yourself so well without making me feel like I'm listening to an AM talk radio show host filling

[37:20] airspace in the hopes that someone will call the show I also enjoy listening to your insights stories

[37:26] and your opinions and being a dog person how could I not be a fan of Bubba right of course um

[37:32] all right so of course once I start listening to your podcast um cherry picking through the back

[37:38] catalog I also went to look for infamous canada post on Pinside after reading through some of them

[37:44] and the responses to them I am not sure how you got banned for life but the truth is I much prefer your

[37:51] takes on the podcast then your comments on Pinside I usually agree with everything you say or at

[37:57] least I think you make legitimate points uh let's see I think you offer sound advice about playing

[38:03] a game before you buy it and making sure actually you have the income to afford it all right I want

[38:10] to see okay I find your comments about pimple marketing to be spot on I have two questions for you

[38:15] okay so Michael thank you first of all for all that and I agree I agree that I was a little

[38:20] troll bastard on Pinside and I definitely deserve to have my hands slapped from time to time

[38:27] but you will never find anything you will never find one thing on Pinside that warns a lifetime

[38:35] ban on the site I do find it amazing that the world's number one voted pinball podcast is banned for

[38:42] life on the world's number one pinball form and again and again robin it and Robin told me why

[38:49] Robin told me why there was a period remember when this podcast got really positive he said to me

[38:56] that there was a female moderator which was the main reason or maybe it wasn't Robin or it was

[39:01] Tiger Law but all I know is this there was a female moderator on there who would not allow them to

[39:08] let me back on she said that letting me back on would cause too many problems so whoever she is

[39:15] I don't know who she is we can go on a witch hunt but she's the main reason why can a

[39:19] candidate not on there but I don't really care whatever all right his two questions are this

[39:23] how big is pinball is the pinball market is there data or studies out there about the size of the

[39:28] market you talk about how relatively small the market is and I'm sure you are right all right and

[39:34] he said this leads to my second question and and the one I am most interested in hearing your response

[39:42] okay so let me let me tackle the first one first so how big is the pinball market

[39:47] is there data and studies that show okay so let me let me put it this way the only people that

[39:52] probably have the kind of data about how big the pinball market is it's probably stern pinball

[39:58] and probably Jersey Jack I would think those two companies would know and I and I'll tell you the

[40:04] data you need well here's the thing it's hard because you'll have data on how big is the the

[40:10] pinball buyer's market right right how many people actually buy pinball machines nobody knows

[40:14] that better than stern you know why because they sell like they have like 92% of the market

[40:19] okay from there you have to ask the question well how many people are actually playing pinball

[40:25] and I would say the people actually playing pinball is significantly larger than the people who buy

[40:31] pinball machines I would say that current day my estimation would be that a very successful pinball

[40:39] buyers market right the amount of people on there are the world that will buy a game

[40:43] is anywhere from five to seven thousand people okay I think that's probably like the base you're

[40:50] looking you're you're looking at maybe it's ten thousand people overall but a great selling

[40:55] game will sell five to seven thousand units maybe is that growing I don't know in terms of the

[41:01] pinball players market impossible all the shows all the bars all the barcades I would say the people

[41:06] who play pinball probably maybe worldwide it's I struggled to guess this because there's so many

[41:12] casual players but I would say you're looking at a few hundred thousand people that actually probably

[41:17] play pinball on an annual basis now a few hundred thousand people it's so tiny considering a

[41:24] billion people play like video games two billion people probably play video games so maybe pinball

[41:31] even if pinball is like a million people out there play pinball on an annual basis two billion

[41:36] people play arcade games and video games all right his next question was how do you grow the pinball

[41:42] market it seems to me that all of these companies entering the market are doing so with the belief

[41:46] that they will capture more of the existing market than their competitors when I'm not hearing

[41:51] is how they hope to expand the market I know that because barcades are popping up in cities here in

[41:57] Cleveland there are a few there are also a few arcades but this depending on where you live in the

[42:01] area you need to be willing to drive to them forgive me if you have touched on this in the past but with

[42:07] 200 plus pockets out there it's hard to catch up anyway I just wanted to ask you a couple questions

[42:11] okay thank you so much Mike shallis for emailing me these questions okay so the second question is

[42:17] how do you grow the pinball market and here is the answer to that you make great pinball games all

[42:24] right that is the only way to grow this market is to make amazing pinball machines but you need to

[42:30] also make amazing pinball machines that aren't complex coated nightmares you need to make games that are

[42:38] are able for casual people to jump on and have fun but also hardcore people can like enjoy now they're

[42:45] only see to me there's only two people in the world capable of making that happen lineman sheets and

[42:53] because here's the thing I think they're the only two coders who actually understand how to make a

[42:58] pinball experience that is immediately satisfying to casual people but also gives hardcore people

[43:06] the depth they want in a game and I think the other coders out there I think they struggle to make

[43:10] the games immediately enjoyable all right maybe they're some of them are but again like when you take

[43:16] the coder out of it it's still the game itself like if you want to grow pinball you need to make

[43:23] pinball machines that are fun and based on things that people want and that's why things like

[43:27] Star Wars things like Ghostbusters things like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you know pick themes

[43:33] that have billions of fans and chances are you're more likely to get people to jump on that machine

[43:39] now but I also want to say this do I think there is a lot of growth left in this hobby I don't

[43:47] I do not I think the resurgence of barcades I think it's peaked I don't think it's growing I think

[43:56] pinball tournaments are growing I think more people are getting into tournaments of pinball but I

[44:01] don't think we're going to see more and more and more of this like explosion of 80s and 90s retro

[44:07] gaming happening in the world I think what we're where we're at now I think is the peak I think

[44:13] we're at the peak of this sort of heritage movement I'm seeing it in other parts of marketing

[44:18] you know with Nintendo like re-releasing their retro systems and selling out but here's the thing

[44:24] ultimately pinball is still an old toy there's no real way to make pinball new and you know I

[44:32] was talking to Greg Colton about this my buddy rare hero and he said it perfectly he's like

[44:36] pinball is just old he's like when my friends come over and they see a brand new pinball machine

[44:42] they look at it and say wow like how old is that like you could look at a Batman and still think

[44:48] it came from like 19 like 2001 like think about that what would someone look at a video game from

[44:54] 17 years ago and think it just came out recently but see that's a thing with pinball all pinball

[45:01] is old it's an old it's an old device we might be making new versions of it but it's still an

[45:08] old thing and because of that I don't think there's any way to like truly like expand the pinball

[45:15] market other than making freaking awesome games um you know because young people are not into it

[45:22] I I love how like people like to think because their kids play or some kids go to shows

[45:28] that the youth of America will be in the pinball they will not you you guys who who haven't

[45:34] put on a VR headset who don't play modern councils who don't understand mobile gaming you don't

[45:41] get it the 99% of the youth doesn't give a shit about pinball they just don't and so many of you

[45:48] even with children where your kids attentions it's buried into their phones and into their

[45:54] iPads and into their computers it's not like oh man like run home to play pinball like we all

[46:00] used to run home and play Nintendo and Sega and things like that or used to run to the arcade when

[46:05] we were kids I used to go to the arcade every like week like multiple times to play games these kids

[46:11] don't give a shit all right it's not like cars were like you know driving has billions of fans

[46:18] pinball's very small but I think the best way to grow it is to make good games all right

[46:26] I'm gonna stop there I'm gonna stop there I think you know you guys have been great with your

[46:32] feedback I look forward to hearing more feedback it's fun to read what you guys say on the show

[46:38] it is fun and I'm gonna get more of you as guests on the show uh but I hope you guys all enjoy

[46:44] your weekends there's no more football there's no more football it sucks there's like nothing going

[46:49] on now other than me watching the weather channel to see if it's gonna be above 40 degrees which I

[46:56] think it is tomorrow morning which means the demon will finally come out again it's got 80 miles

[47:02] on it I'm trying to break her in she's an absolute beast absolute beast I I for those of you who come

[47:09] to New York if the weather's right and we want to hang out I'll give you the option we can play pinball

[47:14] we can go for a ride in the demon and let me tell you one is far more exciting than the other have

[47:19] a great week and everyone we'll talk to you soon

[47:44] so
