[00:00] I don't blame people for the mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.

[00:05] SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT! SIT!

[00:09] Alright, children! Welcome to Jurassic Park! We finally have seen the game that has been hyped behind the scenes for such a long time.

[00:19] And today is one of those glorious days in the Pimball world in which those of us, all 0.001% of the population,

[00:28] who really cares about these new game releases, got to see a new Pimball machine for the first time.

[00:34] And yes, we are talking about Stern Pimball's Jurassic Park on this episode, 374 of Canadian Pimball podcasts.

[00:42] Where do I want to start? Alright, so here's where I want to start this episode. So first and foremost,

[00:47] we're going to talk about the good, we're going to talk about the bad, and we're going to talk about the debate that's been raging on around this machine.

[00:56] But before we do that, I want to start with one thing. I want to start the podcast in this one area, and that is,

[01:04] why doesn't Stern Pimball release high res images of these games on the same day that they walk the distributors through the webinar

[01:16] in which they show the game? Because here's what's happening. Here's what's happening.

[01:20] People who are watching that webinar are simply screen grabbing, or taking cell phone photos of the game,

[01:28] and that's what we have to go on in the Pimball fan community. And it's always so bad to see a game for the first time in low res,

[01:37] crappy quality images. They do it every single time. And you know why they do it? Because they're saving those assets for whoever the media outlet is,

[01:47] that's supposed to break the reveal of the game. But here's what Stern doesn't understand. The game's been revealed.

[01:53] It has been shared and passed around and talked about amongst everyone who cares about this stuff. I really do.

[02:02] I really do get confused as to why the marketing team over at Stern doesn't realize that that we're the ones who care the most.

[02:11] And I just think they could do a better job of synchronizing it all at once. So what I mean by that is Zach Sharp. Here's what you guys should do.

[02:18] You should have it all happen on the same day, right? Why don't you have your media outlet embargoed to go live right after you do your webinar

[02:30] so that everything can go up into the world in the best possible way. But for some reason, they keep deciding to do it like this.

[02:39] And for some reason, the first time we get to see these games is through blurry pixelated images. And if you saw today,

[02:46] it was hysterical because I think I released the first image of the game, albeit pixelated and crappy,

[02:53] but I released the first image of the game out into the world. And I put my canada face on the on the back box screen. It was pretty funny. Anyway, okay.

[03:02] So what do we think about Jurassic Park Pimble? And I want to sort of go down my first impressions of the game.

[03:08] My first impression is this. It's like holy crap. Like this thing is loaded. Like it is packed. I mean, there is a lot going on in this game.

[03:17] And so from just standing back and looking at the what Stern dropped into this game, my first thought was,

[03:24] oh my god, they forgot to put half of this game into black night because black night compared to this has absolutely nothing.

[03:31] So it is incredible how much Stern put into the Jurassic Park Pimble machine. I think anyone who looks at the game

[03:39] is seeing what I've been saying Stern is going to do. They're going to put more mechanisms. They're going to be more creative with ramps.

[03:46] They're going to put more toys in the game. And I think from a purely sort of like, is there a lot to shoot at in this game?

[03:53] It looks like there is a lot under this glass that this is a world under glass. And you know,

[04:00] that's always first and foremost, does this game look fun to shoot? And I think you cannot look at this game

[04:06] and walk away thinking it does not look fun to shoot. I mean, it absolutely does. Okay, so I think that was the

[04:11] first thing that jumped out at me. The second thing, after we did see the breakdown of the pro machine,

[04:17] the premium machine, and the Ellie machine, the second thought I had was, my god. Like Stern is really packing

[04:24] the pro machines with almost everything. I don't think there's anything in this game that significantly

[04:31] removed between the premium and the pro. The major difference is that T-Rex head in the upper left

[04:39] corner on the pro machine. I don't think it moves back and forth. I think it just gobbles the ball.

[04:45] I think it has more movement on the premium and the Ellie. There might be a few other things like a

[04:51] missing spinner here or there, maybe not a shaker motor, but for the most part, for the most part,

[04:57] I mean, this pro is packed. You really can't tell the difference when you look at the pro and the

[05:04] premium and really see a lot missing from the game. So kudos to Stern for jam packing this game

[05:12] in the pro model. I think a lot of people are going to be very satisfied with the pro version of this

[05:18] game. I think that's a really important thing. As Jersey Jack is moving their price point towards

[05:26] the premium, it's interesting to see Stern starting to give more in the pro editions.

[05:34] What else did I say? The T-Rex, that's the first thing I went to. That is cool. The T-Rex

[05:41] breaking through the wire in the movie. I think that is really awesome. He's breaking through

[05:47] the fence. I love that corkscrew ramp on the right side. Something about corkscrew ramps.

[05:56] The ramp goes into the corkscrew wire form. Something about being creative with the way you can make

[06:04] the ball travel around a pinball play field. I think it's awesome to see. I think we saw something

[06:12] very fun with October festival. Hold on to that work. You're going to hear me say it again.

[06:18] I'll explain why. I think the game from a mechanical standpoint, I think Stern put a ton of stuff

[06:26] into this game. There's a lot I didn't even mention. It's got the Velociraptor cage. It's got the

[06:31] Jeep that spins around. It looks like there's a lot in this game. It's got a third flipper.

[06:37] The third flipper is in on the pro. I was laughing because someone's like they were impressed that

[06:42] Stern put a third flipper into the pro model. Are we really at that point though or how much is

[06:47] it actually cost to put a third flipper in a machine like eight bucks for them? Anyway, so I think

[06:53] there's a I think the initial response to seeing this stuff in the game is exciting to people.

[06:59] I think a lot of people out there want a game that has more in it, not less. The game feels loaded,

[07:05] especially coming from the Star Wars home edition, especially coming from Black Knight. This feels like

[07:11] one of Stern's, I have to just say this, this feels like one of their most loaded pinball machines

[07:17] ever that I've ever seen. It reminds me of the first time I saw Ghostbusters in terms of the

[07:23] amount of stuff in the game. So kudos to Stern to putting a lot in this machine. I don't think you

[07:30] could deny that there's a lot going in this machine. Okay, now before I go into the cons and some

[07:37] things I've been hearing people gripe about, I just want to also say that we are giving our just

[07:42] initial response to low res images of a pinball machine. I have not flipped the machine. I have not

[07:49] played the machine. I have not seen the code in the machine. And here's what we know about the

[07:55] game. Then I'll go into the cons. We know the game is based around Jurassic Park, not Jurassic

[08:00] World. And I think that was like a holly lulah. Can't even talk today. holly lulia moment for so many of

[08:06] you out there who did not want to see this game based on Jurassic World. So you got you got your dream

[08:12] in that it's the original Jurassic Park theme. Okay, now how that comes to life in the game is pretty

[08:19] interesting because you'll notice on the play field itself. There's only the nerdy character like

[08:24] Newman's character in on the play field. We're not seeing any of the characters from the original film.

[08:31] And that leads me to something that I want to talk about is the big debate. And I'm not going to

[08:36] put that yet into the cons section because I think this debate falls somewhere in between a pro

[08:43] and a con. And I'll explain why I think people are on the fence about whether or not they're

[08:49] happy or sad that there are assets in this game. When I mean assets, I mean movie clips with sound,

[08:57] movie clips with voices from the movie itself. Like so the iconic scenes you remember from Jurassic Park,

[09:03] they are not going to be in the game. The game is going to be animated the way that iron maidens

[09:09] animations are. So you're going to see something more like that. And people are torn. Some people are

[09:15] like, you know, I want to see all the iconic stuff I love. Some people are saying, no, forget that.

[09:21] I don't play pinball to watch a movie I love. Just get creative with it. And everything should be

[09:26] focused on the world under glass. We shouldn't be putting so much emphasis on getting assets onto the

[09:32] screen. I rather the other thing I heard people say is I'd rather them spend money on putting that

[09:38] world under glass to life mechanically than to spend money getting the movie clips to put on the

[09:43] LCD screen. Okay. Now that is a debate. And I want to talk about this debate or maybe I should just

[09:51] do the cons first. And then I want to let's do that. Let's do that. I know I'm going to change Gearser.

[09:55] Let me talk about the cons that people are saying. Then I'll talk about the whole assets and how

[10:00] this theme is integrated. And what I what I think is going on. All right. So the major con. Can you

[10:06] guess what it's going to be? The major con that I keep reading about. And I want to give my personal

[10:11] opinion on this is that that people don't like the artwork in the game. And I have to agree

[10:18] that I do find the artwork on this game to be very lackluster considering the other art packages

[10:27] we've seen from Stern recently. Most most importantly beetles was nice but not even beetles right?

[10:35] Like the art package on Deadpool. I kept thinking about like how awesome zombie yetis dinosaur

[10:41] Deadpool Ellie cabinet was. And then I look at this Ellie cabinet and I'm like oh my god. It's not

[10:47] even close. And so you know the monsters spoiled us with incredible art. And I just think Stern has

[10:53] raised the bar in the art realm that this does doesn't look quite right. And someone said it and

[11:00] I agree it just doesn't look like the right kind of art style for Jurassic Park. And I kept trying

[11:07] to think about it. Two things popped into my head immediately. The first thing was oh my god. This

[11:11] looks like October Fest art package. Like it just looks like October Fest the way the entire

[11:18] middle area of the play field is just like it's just the island from Jurassic Park with all the

[11:24] inserts. It just reminds me of October Fest with all those inserts and the tenths. It just felt

[11:29] very like similar like just just one big graphical thing filled with like these inserts that are

[11:36] leading up to all the mechanical stuff. But I just felt like that art there just felt really

[11:42] uninspired. And then you got the cabinet artwork and the translate artwork. There's something about

[11:47] it. It's like cartoony. And that's the other thing you know we'll talk about when we talk about like

[11:52] what is this based on because those aren't the images from the Jurassic Park movie that we all

[11:59] know and love. Like that's not the truck from the film. Like what's going on here? Like that's not

[12:04] the iconic Ford Explorer. That's not the Jeep Wrangler. That's just some weird like new truck with

[12:10] like a supercharger and it looks more like a toy. And the more I looked at the art package on it,

[12:17] the thing I kept thinking about is that's what it looks like. It looks like the art package that you

[12:23] would see on a box of a Jurassic Park toy series at like toys or us if they were still around. But

[12:29] you know what I'm saying? It looked like that kind of art like more cartoony that would be like

[12:34] on a Jurassic Park play set. It doesn't really match with the artwork from the Jurassic Park movie

[12:42] that I remember or how I wouldn't how I would imagine that to be. Now I know people have brought up

[12:47] how crappy the artwork was on the Data East Jurassic Park machine and said it's so much better.

[12:53] And of course it is. Remember like nerdy like sausage hands on the Data East original. And if

[12:59] you put the Data East next to this one, I mean obviously this one blows it away. But look that's

[13:05] not really the question or the debate. The debate is does this art look like the right kind of

[13:11] package for Jurassic Park? The funny thing too is the artist responsible for this game, I'm not even

[13:17] making this up. His name is Johnny Crap. I'm not even making this up. If you look at the translate,

[13:24] his name is circle. And if you go to like Johnny Crap, he's got his own art page. That's who they

[13:29] chose to use for this game. His art on his page looks a lot like zombie Yeti. There's just something

[13:35] about this art package that just feels a little bit off. It just doesn't feel that cohesive. It

[13:43] doesn't feel like it's kind of like they just had existing art and they slapped it onto a

[13:49] pinball cabinet. I just don't see it integrated as well as the art packages we've seen from

[13:55] franchi and Yeti. So a new artist entering into the stern pinball realm is going to be held to

[14:01] very high standards. And I you know, I just don't think it's at that level. And I think that's

[14:08] a little bit disappointing for people. But I also will say this. I'll play devil's advocate.

[14:13] We're also judging this art with the worst images imaginable. And I think we do have to wait to

[14:20] see this game in high res glory and to have those colors come through and pop the way they

[14:26] they're supposed to and the way they will in real life before we make the ultimate judgment on

[14:31] the art package. Because I can't really get a sense of the depth and the coloring on the game

[14:37] itself as I see it the way it is. Okay. So we'll see what happens. We're going to see the game

[14:43] on Thursday. All right. What else? The toy, the Fisher price pickup truck that spins around

[14:49] and around looks really crappy. I mean, there's no way around it. Like what is that thing? It's like

[14:55] it's just I don't even understand like what what era of Jurassic Park is that truck from? And is

[15:01] it inspired by like the new Netflix Jurassic Park series coming out? Is it it's not from any of the

[15:06] movies I remember? It looks really cheap. It's an easy fix for the mod community to make a you

[15:13] know someone's going to just mod and put on the old Ford Explorer or the Jeep Wrangler from the

[15:17] original movie into that onto that toy easy fix but also got me thinking to like well what what

[15:25] is this based on right? And so like overall, you know, I think the game looks really fun to shoot.

[15:32] I can't wait to play it. That's for sure. You know, here's what I want to talk about. Then I'm

[15:37] going to get my overall thoughts. Sorry. I'm like jumping around a lot. You can tell because I'm kind

[15:40] of like excited. I've got I've got some notes but I kind of just want to give you my overall assessment

[15:46] of this whole thing. So the objective of the game is very much in line with the first Jurassic Park

[15:53] movie in which you're trying to get the dinosaurs like back in their cages like they've escaped

[15:59] from their cages and you're on this journey. But here's where I here's my question and this is

[16:05] my question. This is what I kept thinking about because you know, I read Pinside and people just

[16:09] either love it or hate it and I was just trying not to fall victim into that space especially because

[16:15] I haven't played it especially because there's more to come and especially because Thursday will

[16:20] see a lot more of the game. But here's my initial feeling. I think that we have to understand a new

[16:27] reality of pinball machines and how pinball machines can bring a property to life in a pinball medium.

[16:36] And we're now at this stage where each game is doing it differently. A game like Batman 66 had

[16:43] every single asset you would want in the game. A game like Guardians of the Galaxy not so much. They

[16:50] didn't have the voice actor rights. A game like Deadpool went a whole different direction and didn't

[16:55] even bother with the movie franchise. A game like the Munsters you know they had more access to

[17:01] those clips but they poorly implemented them. A game like Willie Wonka has access to the clips

[17:09] apparently but didn't really use them. A game like Pirates of the Caribbean didn't have any

[17:15] assets in terms of like voice actors and clips of actors in the film. You know if anything this is

[17:21] more like Pirates of the Caribbean Jurassic Park right. So the question I have is this. Is this

[17:28] pinball machine based upon Jurassic Park the movie we all grew up loving the original Steven Spielberg

[17:35] movie. Is it based it seems like it's based on the first three because there are dinosaurs that

[17:41] come from the second two films as well represent it in the game. But here's what I think people

[17:47] need to realize and here's what I just came to the conclusion on is this is not a pinball machine

[17:53] that's based upon the Jurassic Park movie you love okay Jurassic Park is more than a movie. Jurassic Park

[18:02] is a brand it's a franchise right Jurassic Park makes book bags they make raw thrills arcade games

[18:10] that are based on Jurassic Park they make amusement rides based on Jurassic Park it's a

[18:16] it's a brand it's a franchise and what when I look at a game like this to me it feels like

[18:23] this is Stern pinball licensing the Jurassic Park franchise and making a pinball machine based

[18:32] on that franchise and it's pulling elements from that franchise but I think what's happening in

[18:39] pinball is this I think that these companies are getting stuck in the middle and what I mean by

[18:46] that is they're getting stuck in the middle about how to creatively bring these franchises and

[18:52] these IPs to life in the pinball game and what I mean by that is is I I feel like they're stuck

[19:00] at this medium point of do we make a game built directly on top of the movie we know everyone

[19:08] loves and do we bring the Jurassic Park movies to life or do we not do that do we sort of make a

[19:16] game that's inspired by people's favorite elements from those movies but it's not really a game

[19:23] that is going to give you you know all the things from the movie that you would want in the game

[19:29] because when you look at that truck in the game I mean to me that is the ultimate like that truck

[19:34] doesn't come from any of those three movies why is it in there because that is probably a new design

[19:40] direction for the Jurassic Park property that they might want used in the pinball machine and so

[19:49] the storyline in the game itself will probably be a little bit of a mashup of the first three movies

[19:54] and I think these companies are kind of you know stuck and here's here's here's my here's my take

[20:00] away on all this I think that these companies should start to either go one way or the other

[20:07] make me a pinball machine that brings the Jurassic Park movie I love the first one that I've seen

[20:12] hundreds of times where I know all the movie clips bring that to life to me in a pinball machine

[20:18] and I'll be very happy or make a pinball machine inspired by Jurassic Park it could even be theme

[20:25] Jurassic Park but then create an entirely new pinball experience or Jurassic Park experience in

[20:32] that pinball machine right it's like it's like the same way you can get a Star Wars video game like

[20:39] night of the old Republic where it's it's inspired by the Star Wars universe but it's an all-new

[20:44] Star Wars journey and so I kind of feel like this game's a little bit of ball it's like it's the

[20:51] Jurassic Park property inspired by the films but it's like stuck in the middle it's somewhere in

[20:57] between and I hope that makes sense and and I think that like you know sometimes these these games

[21:03] like will they want to does the same thing to me it's like it's not really giving me the movie back

[21:09] in pinball form it's kind of like inspired by the movie but it's not taking me through the chocolate

[21:15] factory on the journey and and it just doesn't feel like the way the movie would come to life in a

[21:21] pinball machine and I say that because we know that this game has zero movie clips from the Jurassic

[21:28] Park films I think we're gonna get confirmation on that on Thursday and when I hear people say like

[21:33] what I don't want them I don't I don't want the movie clips I mean I don't know I disagree I

[21:38] disagree if you're trying to bring the life the Jurassic Park movie we all know and love I disagree

[21:44] that you don't want all those awesome clips from the film that we love okay but if they can't use

[21:50] those clips then I'm okay with them making a Jurassic Park game that's a new Jurassic Park journey

[21:56] for me because you know what it's it's always the same merry go around with the Jurassic Park theme

[22:01] you got dinosaurs they escape they're trying to eat the humans you're trying to like you know

[22:06] capture them you're trying to either kill them you're trying to like you know survive the Jurassic Park

[22:12] I mean that that is always the same formula so I don't know I don't know how you guys feel about

[22:18] that but that's sort of like where I feel like these brands or sorry these companies are at

[22:22] is they don't know which way to go creatively and I think there's also a lot of pressure behind

[22:28] the scenes from the licensores to do it one way or the other so I guess my final point on that is

[22:35] if you were thinking this is the Jurassic Park one movie you know and love being remade it's not

[22:43] it does feel like it's a little bit more of a homage to the daddy East Jurassic Park and it's like

[22:49] a modern version of that game or a combination of that game and the lost world put together

[22:56] in modern format which is fine I mean totally cool to do that I mean we're seeing

[23:01] Jersey Jack kind of tried to remake Lord the Rings with a Hobbit and he's remaking guns and roses

[23:05] so are we out of themes that we're already remaking stuff but we are we're we're remaking

[23:10] pinball machines that already have been given the pinball treatment um you know so look I the other

[23:17] thing I thought about when I when I saw all this stuff and I don't know about you and sorry if I

[23:22] keep hitting you know my mic on that thing the other thing I thought about was this um you know

[23:27] none of these art packages none of these versions just sort of screamed out like I have to have it

[23:33] and I think the the fear of missing out on getting a Stern Ellie like on day one or day two I kind

[23:39] of think like those days are getting to the point where they're over and I'm kind of glad that's

[23:45] happening I don't know there's just nothing about these Ellie's now screams like you need to spend

[23:51] nine thousand dollars on them and if Stern really wants to continue that fear of missing out they're

[23:57] just gonna have to go further they're gonna have to give us more for nine thousand dollars because

[24:02] remember like that pro looks packed and it's like what almost four thousand dollars less money

[24:09] and even the jump between the premium and the Ellie I mean they're gonna have to start giving you

[24:14] toppers with these Ellie's they're gonna have to start giving you maybe additional modes in the

[24:20] game maybe an additional mechanism in the game I'm just not seeing in this game especially any wow

[24:28] factor like even like the green on the Ellie it's just it's just doesn't pop it just doesn't say oh my

[24:34] god like I think they would have done better to have it more like the Jurassic Park maybe the you know

[24:41] I don't know that color palette from the I remember the original Ford Explorer color palette with

[24:46] like the red and the green and the yellow you know I would have had it look like a T-rex was like

[24:52] ripping at the decals on the side and some of the shiny foil stuff that we saw on Batman S. Ali

[24:58] they need to start giving us more for these Ellie packages I mean I see them and they're just very

[25:04] underwhelming and I think that you know there's just not the value there and I think a lot of people

[25:11] are not gonna run and just like you know buy these things site unseen or without playing them

[25:17] anymore okay uh what else is my final takeaways on this game it looks fun I mean it looks fun I

[25:25] mean hats off to Keith man Keith L. Win just packed this thing with with stuff and so if you can't

[25:33] stand over this game and not walk away being like I want to flip that I think you're crazy I think

[25:39] you're in the wrong hobby I think you need to get out of pinball I think it looks really fun it

[25:43] it does it just looks like it looks like October fest as if October fest had a good theme it's like

[25:50] you know if that's I don't know there's just something about like the way the ramps are crazy in it

[25:54] there's all this stuff in it it just feels like this is how Stern would have done it uh you know

[26:00] if you know if American pinball and Stern like traded themes like this is what it looks like

[26:05] I can't wait to play one I I want to jump on this I didn't have the same feeling with some of the

[26:11] previous Stern machines I think this one's gonna shoot like a dream I think it's gonna be a lot of fun

[26:18] I think that you know it's gonna be one of these games where you're just gonna really want to play it

[26:22] make sure you love it before you own it I encourage everyone to do that I look forward to seeing

[26:28] this game on Thursday being revealed in the right way um the other thing is I'm just happy we can

[26:34] have something other than Willy Wonka stream on flipping out Monday night streams I'm hoping they

[26:40] get a Jurassic Park so that's it I mean that my overall take is this game looks loaded art package

[26:49] looks pretty mediocre from what we can tell right now um game game seems to be more like a Jurassic

[26:57] Park themed game that's inspired by the films but I don't think you're gonna really feel I don't

[27:04] know those see that's the thing is I don't know it's probably too soon they might have all those

[27:08] iconic scenes from the movie um they might have them all like in on the screen as like animations

[27:16] right right they might have like so here's the thing for me it's like how awesome would this scene be

[27:22] they need to have a mode in which the T-Rex is coming and it needs to have an animation of the

[27:28] glass of water with the drop you know sort of like the ripple effect in the water and the shaker

[27:33] motor in the game needs to start shaking in you know and correspond with that water ripple

[27:39] as the T-Rex is coming and then you know you know I don't know like there there's such an

[27:44] opportunity for us to see how they're tying it all together with the animation so everything

[27:49] you might love from the movie it might just come through more in an animated way now that might

[27:55] work for some of you it might not but so much more on this game will come on Thursday because we

[28:01] haven't even seen it and I don't even you know look here's the thing I don't think we're gonna see it

[28:04] on Thursday I doubt we're gonna we're not gonna see anyone flipping it or streaming it um but we

[28:10] probably will get a a video like a YouTube video like Stern Stern presents like we did last time I

[28:18] think with monsters we'll probably get a nice YouTube video that will show some of the animations

[28:23] and we can go off of that good news is the John Williams theme song is in it the original score

[28:29] isn't it and it said John Williams on the Stern material so that's a good thing all right so

[28:35] look we're all we're all still in a wait and see period I think it looks very promising I think

[28:41] it looks really fun uh I think if you can get over maybe the art won't look so bad in person I think

[28:46] Stern is going to sell a ton of these all right I'll just say it they're gonna sell a ton of these

[28:51] this thing looks loaded I think Stern is giving you a lot more for the money right now

[28:57] and I think we're close we're so close to to a game firing off on all cylinders I just wish

[29:04] it could have looked a little bit sweeter like someone keeps bringing up ghost busters and how like

[29:09] ghost busters look the part does this look the part for Jurassic Park uh I'm not we're gonna have

[29:15] to see I have to see it in full color um but I'm sure when you stand over this machine this is the

[29:21] other thing that you don't get from these images you don't get the dimension like those ramps look

[29:25] high up you know in the game I mean this this this world is gonna pop at you as you're standing over

[29:32] it like like no other Stern I've seen in terms of like all that mechanical stuff coming at you uh you

[29:37] know so if you have a black knight Ellie you might want to list it for sale right now because uh

[29:42] the price is dropping a hundred dollars an hour every hour that goes by all right everyone

[29:48] have a great day send me your opinions about the game I will happily read them on air

[29:55] at canada pinballadgmail.com thank you everybody for listening to canada's pinball podcast uh

[30:02] it's a great day when we can enjoy a new pinball machine we should all be thankful that Stern gives

[30:07] us uh new games with such cadence in the pinball world and the other part I'll say before I sign

[30:12] off as this Stern is gonna get everybody they're Ellie's before jersey jack ships a single

[30:20] collector's edition willy-wanka jack how could you do it you left over six million dollars on

[30:25] the table by making people wait to the end of wanka to get the Ellie's Stern is gonna get all
