[00:00] I'ma tell you, like you told me, has rules everything around me, singing la la la billiard,

[00:06] Runna da la billiard, Runna da la billiard, Runna da la billiard, Runna da la billiard,

[00:19] Ah, that was like a little throwback to our original intro music. Welcome to episode 620 of

[00:25] Canadus Bimbal Podcast, the world's number one pinball podcast and now we are almost at 200 people

[00:33] contributing to Canadus Bimbal Podcast. I want to give a big shout out to my latest Patreon

[00:39] contributors Aaron C Danny T Bud and Martin J. Thank you so much guys. We're going to get to 200

[00:46] probably today and there is a new club episode coming tomorrow. So you're really going to want to

[00:52] sign up tonight because you're going to get my thoughts on the David Fix interview, on some other

[00:57] things happening in pinball. But on this episode, I want to talk a little bit about the David Fix

[01:02] interview, but I also want to talk about Stern's insider connected and how this is really going to be

[01:09] how Stern makes a lot, a lot of money for not doing very much, but they're smart, they're smart.

[01:16] This is the biggest untapped revenue stream in the history of pinball for Stern pinball and

[01:23] they are going to capitalize on it. So will it be fun for us or will it be a headache? We're

[01:28] going to talk about that. We're going to talk about Jersey Jack pinball having a fourth designer,

[01:33] join the design team, what that means for JJP. But first I want to start with something. I want to

[01:39] start with something that I read on pinside and before I talk about this topic, I want to ask all

[01:45] of you a question. It's a joke question, but I want to ask it. Before Mount Everest, what was

[01:52] the tallest mountain on planet earth? Think about it for a few seconds. Okay, the answer of the

[02:01] tallest mountain before Mount Everest is Mount Everest. It was still the tallest mountain on the

[02:10] planet before it was named. And I'm in the pinside thread. I'm in the spooky Halloween thread.

[02:17] And I'm reading some people say the following. They are saying that the insert issue on the

[02:23] Halloween games that cost $9,000. That that insert issue of hedge multi-baw, they keep saying that

[02:32] this was not an issue until canada said it was an issue. And I'm here to tell everybody

[02:40] that this was an issue way before I spotted it. When I played this game in the first three minutes

[02:48] of playing it, watching the game light up, I noticed this. And you're telling me that it's an

[02:55] issue now because I'm bringing attention to it on my show and on Facebook and making fun of it

[03:01] because this is not a deal breaker. Like if this thing annoys you so much that you're not going to

[03:06] buy the game, you're in the wrong hobby. But the reason I want to talk about this for a little bit

[03:11] because I think there's an underlying issue happening here. I think there's an issue of people

[03:17] accepting stuff that should never make it into production. And there are details that are

[03:24] important to get right when you're making stuff like a pinball machine that cost this much money.

[03:31] I've been criticized and my show has been criticized and it's why my show is number one because I don't

[03:35] care about those criticisms that I point stuff out that I think should be changed or altered or

[03:43] should have got caught at the pre-production level of the game. And my critics will say that this

[03:49] is canada being negative. And this is how canada turns his back on the manufacturers. Spooky came

[03:55] on his show and they did come on my show. And I'm still friends with the gang over at Spooky. I still

[04:00] have an ultra man on order. But because I support the company doesn't mean I should turn a blind

[04:07] zi if their games have issues. And because I interview you on my show and we had a great interview

[04:14] with Spooky Pimball episode number 600, it was an incredible interview and our numbers are doing

[04:19] better than they've ever done. Orbiter Albert is at 4,000 listens. And I'm not hiding my numbers.

[04:25] You can see how successful my show is weekend and week out. I share my numbers. David Fix got

[04:32] 2,000 listens in less than 24 hours. That's incredible. And I love that, right? But because I had

[04:39] Spooky on, it doesn't mean if I see this, I'm not going to say something. It doesn't mean if I don't

[04:44] like the animations in Halloween, I'm not going to say something. Because if I don't say something,

[04:50] and I don't point out some of these things, who is going to do it for you? No other shows are

[04:55] going to do it for you. But, but let's keep this thing in context. For those who say this was not

[05:00] an issue until Kaneda pointed it out. You're wrong. It was an issue. And with all the people over at

[05:06] Spooky, someone should have caught it. Like we know that. And now you've got a game that looks like

[05:11] something was overlooked. And is it a big issue? No. Will it take away your fun of the game? I don't

[05:16] know. It's going to be somewhat distracting. And I also love when people say, I'm not going to let

[05:21] Kaneda tell me whether or not I can enjoy my game. All right. Look, everybody, simmer down.

[05:27] Simmer down. There are other games out there that have insert issues just like this. But my other

[05:32] point, the other lesson in life is two wrongs don't make a right to point at other games that have

[05:40] these issues as justification for this current issue is also a name. These games are now costing

[05:49] so much money. If your expectations are higher of these products at these price points, guess what?

[05:57] They should be. And I'm not here slamming Spooky. It clearly was a mistake they didn't fix.

[06:03] It's clearly something now a lot of people are staring at. But that's why details matter.

[06:09] If you walk into a fine restaurant and there's a gravy stain on the white table cloth,

[06:15] that's not going to change whether or not the meal is any good coming out from the kitchen.

[06:19] It's not going to change if you enjoy every bite, but you will remember that stain on the table

[06:25] cloth. When I see a game like Halloween and I see how beautiful the art is and I see how nice the

[06:31] game shoots. And then you see hedge multi-bought. It's kind of like looking at a beautiful woman,

[06:36] right? You see a beautiful woman. She looks perfect. And then she smiles at you and she's missing a

[06:42] tooth. It's not a big deal, right? It's not a deal breaker. It's not a game changer. But there's

[06:48] just something about it that every time you look at it, you're going to notice it. And that's what

[06:53] little details like this when you get them wrong. That's what they do to pinball owners. Remember,

[07:00] a lot of these games are going into people's homes and they would like them to be without mistakes

[07:06] like this. And so what will spooky do to fix this issue if it's an issue? Well, now it's an

[07:12] issue, right? Because Canada said something we have to get his show off the air because we can't have

[07:16] someone holding companies accountable for these high-priced toys that nobody really needs. Well,

[07:22] look, spooky pinball is definitely not going to be able to send people out new playfields. It's not

[07:27] that big of an issue. The playfields themselves are still beautiful. They're not going to chip. They're

[07:32] not going to pull. I think the first hundred or so owners, if these issues are on those games

[07:37] only, they will joke and laugh. The more we make hedge multi-baw something to joke about, the more

[07:44] fun it is to actually have a hedge multi-baw edition of this game. The hedge multi-baw edition

[07:51] actually becomes the rarest version of Halloween. Remember, when they printed the airplane upside

[07:58] down on a stamp, it became more valuable. In the toy collecting world, it is the variants or the

[08:04] variations, the mistake prints that become the most expensive. So yes, on some crazy level,

[08:12] if this hobby continues to go down this road of valuing these pinball machines as collectibles,

[08:18] then absolutely the hedge multi-baw edition will go down as the rareer, more sought after version

[08:26] of Halloween. Does it sound stupid when I say it? Absolutely. Is it a joke? Absolutely. Should people

[08:33] stop taking this stuff so seriously? Absolutely. But canada will not stop pointing these things out

[08:40] and having a good laugh because it's entertaining to see these companies try so hard, right?

[08:45] Develop a game for two years and you've got all those people that spooky pinball and nobody looks

[08:51] down at the game and says, dude, it says hedge multi-baw every time it lights up. Then nobody see this?

[08:56] Come on. Chuck, call a meeting. Guys, from here on out, how about this? Canada will come and look

[09:02] over every new game before it goes out, before you go into production and let me go over it with a

[09:07] fine cynical comb and tell you what you need to change before people like me point it out after

[09:13] it's too late. So speaking of another funny thing here, and we've always joked on this show. We

[09:17] joked about how pinball marketing is so funny and so bad and usually so sloppy. And I was just

[09:24] laughing because in the photo in which Jersey Jack pinball is announcing their fourth designer.

[09:30] Welcome to the JJP team, Mr. Mark Sayden, I believe you say it, Sayden. And he's joining

[09:36] Steve Richie, Pat Lawler, and Eric Minier. Now, Jersey Jack on their official Facebook page put out

[09:42] a really funny photo of all four gentlemen in different parts of the factory. They were outdoors,

[09:48] they were indoors, but there's a funny photo that's really hilarious. And it's one of the photos

[09:53] of the four of them standing in front of the Jersey Jack pinball sign outside the company.

[09:59] And what I love about this, if you're framing this photo and you want your four designers to stand

[10:04] in front of Jersey Jack pinball with pride, go look at this photo. They take the photo and two of them

[10:11] are covering most of the letters of Jersey Jack pinball so that when you look at it, it says RC

[10:18] ACN ball RC ACN ball like like nobody said to them, Hey guys, could you just both of you in the

[10:24] middle just move a little bit out and then put your arm around the guy next to you and it'll say

[10:30] Jersey Jack pinball and you guys will look like you're actually having a good time. I mean, Steve

[10:34] Richie looks like he just found out that he can't access his crypto account in which he left 200

[10:39] million dollars in it and then even funnier, even funnier behind it, there's a sign that says now

[10:45] hiring Jersey Jack pinball. So I was just laughing at this because it's funny every time I take a photo,

[10:51] Brenda is always yelling at me how important it is to frame the photo properly. And this is your

[10:58] moment in which you're showing the four new designers and nobody said, Hey, we can't read the company

[11:04] so from here on out, I now consider there to be two versions of Jersey Jack pinball. There's

[11:10] Jersey Jack pinball as we know it and then there's RC ACN ball. And I'm almost more excited for RC

[11:18] ACN ball than I am for Jersey Jack pinball because maybe RC ACN ball is not going to have play field

[11:24] issues. Maybe RC ACN ball isn't going to have a warranty in which they won't cover anything in

[11:29] the game after you buy it. So we'll see. So I have high hopes for RC ACN ball as far as JJP,

[11:36] let's talk about the fact that they have a fourth designer. So everybody knows that Jersey Jack's

[11:41] main problem is manufacturing. And we've said this before, we said this when they hired Steve

[11:46] Richie, which is great. There's no issues with having more designers. I mean, having a lot of

[11:50] designers on your team is fine, but the real issue in pinball is never designed. It's manufacturing,

[11:58] manufacturing is where every company struggles. It's where all the delays occur. It's where all

[12:05] the problems happen with the pinball company. Now, Jersey Jack pinball has a manufacturing problem.

[12:11] And their problem remains the same thing as it did years ago. This company can't announce,

[12:18] reveal and ship two games in a timely manner. That is the number one problem of Jersey Jack pinball.

[12:26] It is not a design problem. It is a manufacturing problem. Now, I think in the past,

[12:33] there was a real delay from the design team to get products to manufacturing. And there was,

[12:40] it wasn't a parts issue. There was no COVID back in the day. The reason why it took so long to get

[12:46] games like dialed in out. The reason why there was normally a delay at JJP is that Pat Lawler takes

[12:52] a really long time to complete his games. There were also delays in the software department,

[12:59] right? Keith Johnson also takes a really long time to code his games. Now, look, you can debate

[13:05] whether or not it's worth it and to some people it is, to some people it's not, but at a company level

[13:11] where Jersey Jack pinball is today in 2021. They are still really slow when it comes to getting a

[13:19] portfolio of games out the door, especially when we look at what's happening down the block at Stern,

[13:25] in which Stern can get four to six games out a year. Four new titles, two remakes, a contract

[13:32] game, Stern is just so efficient at manufacturing. Stern doesn't just manufacture the game that's

[13:39] available today. They also make games from their back catalog. Now, Jersey Jack did just announced

[13:46] they're going to remake more Willy Wonka's, but what we really want and what everyone is really

[13:51] hoping to get is not more Willy Wonka. What we want is to see in a 12 month period, Guns and Rose

[13:59] is announced, revealed and shipped and within that 12 months are at the end of it because we just

[14:05] passed the one year anniversary of GNR's reveal within that window reveal your next game and ship

[14:13] your next game, not a previous game, but your next title. But we're still not seeing that.

[14:18] So when you see Mark come on board and Mark's known in the homebrew community, he made the

[14:23] Metroid pinball machine. When is Mark's game going to come out? If you just start to ask

[14:29] at the pace they're going, where it's one new game every 18 months, this guy's game is now going

[14:36] to follow Toy Story, Eric Minier's next game, Steve Richie's game, and then we get to his title.

[14:44] Now the rumor I'm hearing, and this is a rumor, so go ahead and grab it and say I got the facts wrong.

[14:50] The rumor I'm hearing is that Toy Story will most likely be Pat Lawler's final title. I'm not 100%

[14:57] confirmed on that. If he's not retiring, he can easily come out and say it, but I'm hearing that

[15:02] this might be his last title. Now that would make sense if they're bringing on Mark as a way to

[15:08] populate their design team with enough resources into the future. And I like that Mark is young.

[15:14] I like that he's young. I like that he's an unknown. I always feel like when you give young talent

[15:19] an opportunity to show us what they can do, this is how you get new thinking into pinball. I don't

[15:25] have as much faith in Steve Richie as I do in Mark to bring exciting new pinball designs and worlds

[15:31] under glass to life. I just don't. I've seen Steve's recent games and I hope he does it. I hope

[15:37] he turns a corner, but Mark is someone who's trying to make a name for himself. He's someone who wants

[15:43] to become pinball famous by joining a company like JJP. Steve Richie is already pinball famous.

[15:50] There's nothing he can do to solidify his legacy. It is solidified. He doesn't have to win people

[15:58] over, but what he needs to do now if you're Steve Richie, he needs to do this next game for himself,

[16:03] to prove to himself that he still has it. And if you don't still have it, if you don't, if the

[16:10] sales aren't there and the consumers don't gravitate to it and you don't reach your sales target for

[16:16] Jersey Jack pinball, there comes a time in every man's career where you just have to say,

[16:22] I don't have it anymore and I retire. Now I don't think Steve's ever going to retire. I think

[16:26] Steve's going to design to his very last day on Planet Earth and that's cool, but I just hope

[16:31] that this game is much better than his previous efforts at Stern. Now I made a bet. I made a bet with

[16:37] someone recently for a hundred bucks surrounding Jersey Jack pinball and I want to say this bet on

[16:42] air because I want this person to pay out when it doesn't happen. I made a $100 bet with Dr.

[16:49] Frightner on Pinside. You know him as Larry. Larry bet me $100 that toy story would be shown at

[16:58] IAPA in November. So IAPA is like the second week in November. It's the big amusement show down

[17:04] in Orlando and I was like, there is no way. There is no way. If we don't see it at Expo, there is no

[17:10] way toy story is going there and he's like, they have to show it there. It's the main show where

[17:15] everyone shows everything. It doesn't matter. Pinball does not need to be there. Pinball does not

[17:21] need to be at these big conventions where all these amusement devices are being shown because pinball

[17:26] will still sell without that. They didn't need to bring G&R to IAPA to sell 5,000 units. Nobody does.

[17:34] I know that operators go there to place orders on items, but it doesn't matter. Pinball is so small,

[17:40] it's so niche and you already know how to reach tens of thousands of potential pinball buyers

[17:47] without going to IAPA. So Larry, get your $100 ready because I would be shocked if toy story is

[17:56] at IAPA because it would have to be on the line already and I know for a fact it is not on the line.

[18:03] In fact, the rumor I'm hearing is that it's not even done yet. Look, you know I love toy story.

[18:08] You know I love toy story and I want to buy toy story. But for me, the big thing I want to see

[18:13] with Jersey Jack's toy story and the next title moving forward. I want to see that they've

[18:18] actually fixed these play field issues. They still don't want to talk about it. I saw Mirko

[18:22] cancelled being at Expo. He's no longer going to be there Saturday morning doing a panel about

[18:28] Mirko play fields. I want to know they fixed that problem. I would hate. I would hate, hate, hate

[18:34] to buy toy story and see that they have not removed the art from around the post and the game is

[18:40] filled with a bunch of cheap washers as an excuse not to fix the process of how they're making their

[18:47] play fields. I know this is an inconvenient thing to stay on but until they've proven to us that

[18:54] they've fixed this problem, why would we move on from this issue when we think about buying their

[19:01] products in the future. Am I the only one who thinks this way like, all right, like they've got

[19:06] this quality issue that they haven't really addressed. So they want everyone to go silent on it

[19:12] and they don't want people like Canadian to keep bringing it up. But with every new game

[19:18] and we're going to see how these Willy Wonka's hold up but I see the Willy Wonka's are once again

[19:23] shipping with washers under all these posts. Let me tell Jersey Jack right now. Every game that ships

[19:28] with a washer under the post is you telling us you haven't fixed the problem and the reason why I

[19:35] know that is every single company with good play field does not have washers like that under all

[19:43] those posts. So it's not a good look, it's not fooling anybody and we need you to fix the problem.

[19:50] But anyway, we'll see what Mark does. We'll see what Mark does. I have no idea like when his game

[19:55] would come out. At the pace they're going, Mark's title won't be out for like four years. So how can

[20:02] you get excited about this stuff? It's really strange to me. I hope they get their manufacturing

[20:07] fixed. The main news I want to see from JjP is that they've ramped up their manufacturing and I

[20:12] know they're working on that clearly. That's why they have Wonka's and G&R's on the line at the same

[20:17] time. I don't think they've made two separate titles ever in Chicago. So this is their approach to

[20:23] getting there. I want to see Jersey Jack within a 12 to 14 month period be able to make ship

[20:31] release and reveal two new titles, not just one two new titles. Let's talk about Stern Insider

[20:38] Connect. So I went to sign up as Canada on Stern Insider Connect and I knew what would happen and

[20:44] it happened. Somebody grabbed my Canadian name and my personal name and used the three greatest

[20:51] letters as my initials, SUX. And I'm happy they did this because they know that Canada does

[20:59] suck at playing pinball. So thank you so much whoever you are that grabbed the Canada avatar and

[21:04] used my personal name. But it does show a problem Stern's going to have here. If you give everybody

[21:09] the ability just to sign up with whatever Gmail address and can take anybody's name, can use anyone's

[21:15] personal name and then they're in the system as that. I don't think they thought this through how

[21:21] easy it is to sort of troll and hack and pretend to be somebody you're not. So it's fine. I don't

[21:27] really care. But let's talk about this Insider thing. I was not on the webinar but I read a lot of

[21:32] the notes and here's my take on this whole thing is until we use it until we actually see how this

[21:39] works. I don't think anyone out there really knows if this is going to be great. If this is going to

[21:44] be neat, if this is going to be annoying, if this is going to be a rip off, I don't think anyone

[21:50] knows yet. I think there's definitely going to be some really cool features that target like the

[21:56] hardcore weekly pinball player stuff like the badges and the achievements and going around to

[22:02] different locations could unlock things for you. If you play pinball frequently right now and you're

[22:07] in a league and you're in tournaments and you go all over the country in the world playing pinball,

[22:12] this is a great way for them to track you, know who you are, know how much you love pinball

[22:19] and reward you. So I think the community out there is really going to embrace this on a lot of

[22:25] levels like that because I think for those people, you're not really going to see a cost to that.

[22:31] You're not like Stern's going to use your behavior to reward you. The operators are going to be

[22:37] able to reward you and incentivize you to not only play the machines at their locations,

[22:44] but also reward you with things from those operators. So imagine you play a pinball machine and

[22:50] you could win a free beer. You could order the burger with the beer and the fries and if you order

[22:56] the combo, that could come with a QR code to have a free pinball game. That stuff is really cool.

[23:02] It's really neat and I think people are going to love that. The other thing I like about this

[23:07] connected machine is now you can upgrade the software without having to take off the back glass.

[23:12] If you're an operator, you can change the way the game is set up remotely, which is really cool.

[23:17] There's a lot of stuff to like, but the thing I'm worried about, the thing I'm worried about is

[23:22] the home buyer. I think Stern is going to use this as a Trojan horse to sort of get a lot more money

[23:29] from the home buyer, the collector. The person who's not out there playing pinball on location

[23:34] all the time, the person who can afford his own beer and doesn't need to win a free beer playing pinball.

[23:40] I think Stern pinball is going to bake into this new system. A lot of different revenue streams

[23:47] and micro transactions as ways to get you to have to keep spending money on your pinball machine

[23:54] well after you buy it. They are definitely going to do that. They're definitely going to add new

[24:00] modes. They're going to add new features and you're going to be able to get it and unlock the

[24:04] true potential of your machine at a cost. There is no way they're not going to charge you a monthly

[24:12] fee to get those things. There's no way the stuff they add to these games are just going to be

[24:17] minuscule things nobody wants. They know what they're doing. They're not stupid. Imagine if you have

[24:22] a game like Batman 66. The one main thing that I've always felt was missing from Batman 66

[24:28] was there was no season three option for the main villains, right? The minor villains all had

[24:34] three seasons of different modes you could select but the major villains were only two seasons

[24:40] which kind of made no sense because there were three seasons of the show. And so imagine if Stern

[24:46] pinball made a complete third season of all the modes and this and that. They don't need to do

[24:52] that. It doesn't complete the game. The game's already complete in their mind. What could they

[24:56] charge for that? And imagine if they were thinking of putting that in, right? Imagine if they were

[25:01] thinking of upgrading the code in a machine. Well why would you give it away for free? And I think

[25:06] those days are coming and I don't think people really want that. All I really want. All I really

[25:11] want. I'm telling you this. All they really want. I want to buy a game from a pinball company that

[25:17] is complete the day I buy it. And then I would like to have the opportunity for there to be some

[25:22] online features where maybe I could play with people and my friends. I would like there to be an

[25:27] ability to connect those machines and I don't mind paying like an annual fee, right? For Stern's

[25:32] ability to connect me to other pinball players and machines across the world. I don't mind paying

[25:37] 50, 60 bucks for that. I pay that for Xbox. So I don't mind that. But I don't really want to do a

[25:43] lot of micro things. And that works in the video game space because there's millions of users.

[25:48] But I'm not really sure it's going to work in pinball. But the thing I just don't know yet because

[25:53] I haven't used it and I haven't bought a new Stern machine with this. I just don't know as a player

[25:58] of pinball how easy it is going to be for me and for you to opt out of all this stuff if I don't

[26:06] want it. What if I don't want to do all these micro transactions? What if I don't want to spend extra

[26:10] money? What if I don't want this on my machine? Well, it's going to be on every machine and you're

[26:16] not going to be able to like pay for your machine cheaper if you don't want it. It's also going to

[26:20] give Stern the ability to know what you're doing with your machine. Do you want them spying on your

[26:25] machine because you will have to connect your machine to Stern. So they will now know if you've

[26:30] done modding if you've added stuff. I don't even like that either. I don't want them to know that

[26:36] because I put a Gandalf with light up staff on my machine, they can now somehow detect that

[26:42] and they might void my warranty because of that. So we are losing some of our own personal

[26:48] freedoms with our machines because they will be able to spy on our machines and the code

[26:53] and the mods if we do it. You know, so there's pros and cons here with this whole thing. I'm

[26:59] keeping an open mind on this. I'm not sure where it's going to net out. I'm keeping an open mind

[27:04] but I definitely I definitely think over the next year how Stern rolls this out is going to be

[27:10] interesting. I don't think they know what they're going to price this at. I think that's the big

[27:15] question mark. I think Stern is still debating and internally they're not sure what they can get

[27:22] away with and I think they're going to have to eventually say it's this much a month. Each new

[27:28] DLC is going to be this much and when they start doing that and now that we're already spending

[27:33] $10,500 on an LE and you are going to have to spend even more money to unlock that LE

[27:40] there's going to come a point where a lot of us just say this is not worth it. How much is an

[27:45] Xbox before you buy Xbox live? Think about it. How much are Xbox games and those games are

[27:52] connecting you to millions of people who play and you're going to spend $10,500 and now you got to

[27:57] spend more. $10,500 and you don't get a topper. $10,500 they don't even give you the upgraded

[28:04] shooter rod item. Right? You're not even getting Mothra's egg as the shooter rod when you buy the

[28:10] LE. Now speaking of the LE did you see the foiled artwork on Godzilla LE? Damn it looks nice.

[28:16] Thanks for sharing that Keith Ellen but I also think Stern is smart. Nobody else has done this.

[28:21] Nobody else has thought through online properly. Jersey Jack hasn't, P3 hasn't and nobody can

[28:28] do it like Stern because they have the user base. They have the games. They have the games both

[28:33] on location and in homes. They're in the driver's seat when it comes to this revenue stream and the

[28:40] potential revenue stream around Stern inside are connected and so we will see how this thing transpires.

[28:47] Personally I don't think pinball needs so much. I think there are elements here that are great.

[28:53] I think there are things here that are going to be fun. I also think some of this stuff is going

[28:58] to be annoying because I think they're going to charge you for things that you should get for $10,500.

[29:04] I do. I fully believe that. Like if you buy an LE shouldn't that come with a year free of Stern

[29:09] inside or connect and all the bonus features of the game you just bought? They're not going to do

[29:14] that. They're not going to do that. They're going to make you pay like everybody else like

[29:17] everyone who bought a pro. All right everybody this has been episode 620. I didn't even talk about

[29:22] David Fix. I'm going to talk about David Fix. I'm going to do that on my club show tomorrow.

[29:27] So if you're a club member look out for that. Thank you everybody for the support. Like I said the

[29:32] numbers are up. The Facebook live audiences have been amazing. The merchandise is coming. I have a

[29:40] merchandise solution. You're going to be able to get everything you want with the Canadian merch.

[29:44] I'm very very thankful for each and every one of you. I don't know what to tell the haters. They've

[29:48] been turning it on a little bit lately. It's okay. It's okay. I'm very confident in this show and the

[29:53] fact that we have the number one audience. We have the most listeners and we get people like David

[29:58] Fix on the show. You saw the way that interview went. Oh big bad Canadian. He's going to turn on these

[30:03] people. Look I'm always going to tell you how I really feel about these companies. They're products.

[30:09] I will hold them accountable for the games they make. I will not personally attack them. But that

[30:15] doesn't mean I want to attack a game that's got glaring issues or quality problems or shoots like

[30:21] crap. That's why we're here. That's why it's interesting. If I said everything in Pimbal was awesome

[30:27] I would have no listeners, no twippies and no fans. Thank you everybody. We'll be back shortly.

[30:40] Some lift for that bill. Some cute for that bill.

[30:42] Yeah.

[30:44] Mama money. She want for the bill.

[30:46] Great for the bill.

[30:48] Oh.

[30:50] Mama money.

[30:51] Still GDP. They got a big bill.

[30:53] Yeah.

[30:55] Mama money.

[30:56] Tonight we're going to see on that bill.

[30:58] Oh.

[31:00] Mama money.

[31:01] Yeah.
