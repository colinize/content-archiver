[00:00] Stern Pimbaugh, if they remade guns and roses, they wouldn't go license the guns and roses music.

[00:06] They probably would just get someone to redo it like this.

[00:30] Welcome to episode 181 of Canadian Pimbaugh podcast.

[00:47] And I think by now, a cold hard truth is setting in on this hobby.

[00:55] And I think it's about time because I think a lot of people are feeling the pain and the agony of what this podcast is going to talk about on this episode.

[01:06] And that is simply one thing.

[01:09] Paying for something before it's finished and what that means and what that has done to the Pimbaugh community, right?

[01:19] It's not just Stern Pimbaugh doing this.

[01:21] This has been, I would say, an epidemic in Pimbaugh that has been going on now for almost a decade now.

[01:31] Where companies have announced things, they've announced their intentions in Pimbaugh, and then they didn't deliver.

[01:39] And people paid for those things long before.

[01:43] There was a flipping machine in front of them long before anyone reviewed the product itself.

[01:49] And tonight we got probably one of the most sort of interesting examples of that unfolding before our eyes.

[02:00] Guardians of the Galaxy, a game that originally shipped a week ago with no callouts.

[02:06] Very, very spartan code.

[02:08] I think it was code.66 something like that.

[02:12] Received a code update today.

[02:14] And I want to say thank you to Pinside user waspinator who has been updating the game with the new code and putting his live stream on Twitch for those of us in the hobby.

[02:27] To actually see what the game plays like with the new code update.

[02:31] I mean, it's kind of amazing that the code update appears on Stern's website.

[02:35] This guy installs it.

[02:37] And he lets us into his home so we can see what it's like.

[02:40] And here is the reality of Guardians of the Galaxy Pimbaugh.

[02:45] None of the voice actors in the game itself are from the movie itself.

[02:53] What I mean by that, it's not just callouts that are not done by the voice actors.

[02:59] None of the video footage of the film features the actors from the film.

[03:06] So when you have a scene from the film where two characters are talking to each other, that's going to be dubbed over with these voice actors that are approved by Marvel.

[03:17] And I think I sort of speak for the majority of people who saw this footage so far.

[03:24] When I say it's kind of bad.

[03:27] And what I mean by that is it's just really bad to see a scene from a film you love.

[03:35] And then the audio coming from that scene is weird because the voice actors are not what you remember from the film.

[03:44] And the thing about the human voice is it's really really hard to replicate the sound of an actor, especially famous actors that we're so familiar with.

[03:56] Imagine Star Wars Pimbaugh if that machine came out and all of those iconic scenes from Star Wars were not delivered by Harrison Ford or Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher.

[04:10] And they brought in actors and they just read those lines over the original movie audio.

[04:19] I mean it's kind of like that and it just feels off.

[04:24] It just feels off.

[04:26] And this is sort of disappointing, right?

[04:28] I think for a lot of people out there, when we heard about the LCD implementation within Pimbaugh, people got really excited because they felt like now all of the classic movie scenes.

[04:39] And different sort of audio and visual stuff that I remember can be recreated perfectly for a Pimbaugh machine.

[04:48] But what's happening now is it's really hit or miss, right?

[04:52] We're not always getting what we want.

[04:56] And what's confusing to me is this.

[04:59] Is how can you get the rights to Star Wars and get all the rights to those actors, but not the rights to the new film?

[05:07] I think the answer is probably in the contracts that these new actors sign with the studios gives the individual actors the rights to that stuff.

[05:19] Whereas in 1996, when the first Star Wars film came out, I believe the studio owned all of that, right?

[05:28] So Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford didn't have to independently be contracted and paid for for those clips.

[05:37] But nowadays it's all different, right?

[05:40] And so I want to play for you a clip, a clip from a clip from the Twitch stream that was made or put up that everyone was just making fun of.

[05:51] It's the scene where Riyandu is talking to the collector guy about the orb and he just keeps saying,

[06:00] you'll hear.

[06:02] So what I want to do is I want to play first.

[06:06] I want to play for you the clip from Guardians of the Galaxy movie.

[06:10] And I want to hear the real actors articulating that scene.

[06:15] And then I want to play for you what it sounds like in the game.

[06:19] Now keep in mind I had ripped the audio from a Twitch stream that was not the best audio, but I want you to hear the difference between the two.

[06:28] Let's play the original one first.

[06:31] Who out there might want to buy?

[06:34] The high end community is a little more vulnerable.

[06:38] The high end community is a tight middle.

[06:43] The high end community is a very tight middle.

[06:46] I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers.

[06:52] Okay, so now let's play the Stern version using Marvel approved voice actors.

[06:58] And of course you're going to hear Waspinator laughing and chiming in in some pinball sounds, but let's play that now.

[07:04] Did that? Okay.

[07:28] I loved watching Waspinator play because it was just cracking them up.

[07:32] And people in the chat thread were all just like, oh my god, this is so bad.

[07:36] And he's like, what are you talking about guys? It's funny. Like I like it.

[07:39] Like I don't know why you're having such a problem with it.

[07:42] Look, that clip actually is not the worst representation of what's going on in the game.

[07:48] There are much worse examples where like Rocket doesn't really sound like Rocket.

[07:53] And the other actors, you know, they don't really match up with the sounds in the film.

[07:59] It's going to be like Avengers where you're not going to get a direct one to one sort of representation of what you're used to with the films.

[08:11] And you know, look, the problem is this. The problem I believe is this.

[08:17] Is you can't have this level of inconsistency with pinball machines because of one thing.

[08:26] Because all the machines are costing the same amount of money.

[08:30] If there were different costs, then I could understand why maybe one machine has a lot more in it and one doesn't.

[08:39] But it's apples to apples because Star Wars comes with everything in it.

[08:46] Guardians of the Galaxy does not and cost the same amount of money.

[08:52] So that I think is the real problem that is plaguing pinball right now is that some games are getting great theme integration and some games are not.

[09:02] And as a consumer, as a consumer, we know that everybody would want full integration.

[09:09] They'd want all the audio. They'd want all the clips from the movie that could be in it.

[09:14] They'd want all the voice actors from the movie in the machine itself.

[09:18] And I think it begs the question. It begs the question.

[09:22] If these modern pinball machines are going after current licenses that make it really difficult to license the voice actors from Hollywood stars,

[09:35] make it really difficult to license the music and the themes from the films.

[09:41] But it's a lot easier to get both of those things if you go after movies that come from maybe the 70s in the 80s and maybe the early 90s.

[09:50] I think it begs the question. Why are pinball companies bothering to go after some of these licenses if they're so restricted?

[10:01] It doesn't seem to make sense to me, especially when you look at the buyer of pinball machines is probably in his 40s and in his 50s.

[10:12] And the nostalgic themes that would play so well in the marketplace come from those errors where you could probably get more of that sort of licensing fall integrated package.

[10:28] I mean, when I was, you know, I got, I got some shit from people when I announced that I was getting Batman 66.

[10:34] But I meant it when I said it that one of the reasons why I really am excited to get Batman 66 is the theme integration.

[10:43] And I know I've like made fun of the machine because some of the physical shots on the, on the game aren't as great as they could be considering that universe.

[10:51] But it's got Adam West, it's got Bert Ward, it's got the theme song, it's got the music from the show, it's got all the call outs and the sounds from all the actors that were in those TV shows.

[11:03] It has access to every single clip from 120 episodes of Batman. The way I remember it, there's nothing different or change or altered.

[11:14] And I think that's sort of where we're at is there's going to be hits and misses when it comes to theme integration.

[11:22] But the notion that people are buying these things, these games are shipped into people's homes before people even know, they even know like what the call outs are going to sound like.

[11:37] I think that's a real problem and I think this is it. I really do. I think we're at the point where people are just fed up.

[11:46] I mean it's hard to watch this stream as a fan of Guardians of the Galaxy and know that your machine is going to have these like sound delights in it.

[11:55] Maybe if you're in on a pro, but it's really hard to feel excited about spending $9,000 on a limited edition version of this game knowing that it's never really accurately going to capture the franchise.

[12:10] And I think if you're going to spend that kind of money, the new sort of filter for a lot of people is how well is the theme integrated in this machine.

[12:22] I think the other big problem that's going to come out is over at Jersey Jack Pimble with pirates of the Caribbean is suffering from the same kind of restrictions.

[12:35] And it just for the life of me as a marketer, you know, if you think about the elements that would make a Pimble machine great and a classic sort of like these recreated lines, I don't really think they're going to fly anymore considering what the expectation of the consumer is.

[12:56] And for the companies out there, it was one thing when you were charging people $4,000 for new inbox games, but now people are being asked to spend two three times that and you've got to deliver them a product that doesn't feel like it's cutting corners.

[13:13] And if you can't afford those things, then go find a property or a franchise that you can afford to insert all of those elements into the game.

[13:24] And ultimately, ultimately, the onus is on all the buyers out there, on all of you out there.

[13:31] If you buy before the game is finished, you have no one to blame anymore but anyone but yourself.

[13:37] If you're not happy with the way the theme is integrated into the machine, I don't think you should look for external solutions and, you know, these sort of hacks people put together or new pinboards, people create, it's never going to be the same.

[13:52] You're going to want to have it come from the factory, code it the way you want it.

[13:57] I think what people are going to start demanding.

[14:02] And so it's an interesting error in Pimbal. It's an interesting error.

[14:07] You know, when we start to look at games that like Big Lebowski, and I've been saying this for a while, how good does that theme integration look right now?

[14:15] They've got the call outs from the actors from the movie. They got clips from the movie.

[14:20] The play field itself is that great world under glass. I mean, I think the Big Lebowski went about and did it right.

[14:28] And even though they had to lose the rights to some of the music, you know, that wasn't so bad.

[14:35] The recreation of it and that guy with the deep dude voice worked really well.

[14:40] But I think they found the right balance between stuff that you remember, that it was accurate from the films, stuff that was voice actor, that sounds really good.

[14:51] And then they had to figure out a solution for the music, which I think worked well.

[14:56] So I think that's a good example of a game that really sort of brought the theme to life and integrated it in a great way, even though they didn't have 100% theme integration.

[15:07] So I think we're at an interesting point.

[15:10] Interesting point. People remember that, you know, was it a foreigner or was it Arnold Schwarzenegger? Did the call outs? Was it for T2?

[15:21] So it seems like this is going to be more of like Avengers. And I'm already hearing some people being like, oh, this game's done now.

[15:29] Like stick a fork in it. Now I'm not going to get it. I don't know. I think it's a little premature on whether or not the call outs are going to really, you know, significantly hurt the sales of Guardians of the Galaxy.

[15:42] I don't think the title was going to sell nearly as well as Stern probably thought because I just don't think the demographic that buys Pimball is also the biggest fans of this franchise because it's a newer franchise.

[15:55] It doesn't have the nostalgic value of others.

[15:59] Another interesting thing that some people are saying this might change is they recorded the scenes from the movie with the new voice actors.

[16:09] But they didn't really record Pimball call outs, right? And that's kind of weird as well. You got these actors. They're recreating the scenes from the film.

[16:20] But you think they would also get them to recreate a lot more Pimball call outs to sort of guide you through the game in sort of the character that they're supposed to be representing from the film.

[16:34] And we didn't hear really any of that yet in this code. But it's still early on.

[16:39] And obviously we're going to get more code updates. Is it too early to say that Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be a miss?

[16:48] I want to hear what your thoughts are. You guys out there. You by the time you listen to this, go check out the Twitch stream by Waspinator.

[16:57] Let me see if I can give you. I think I might have is I don't have it up right now with his handle is on Twitch.

[17:05] But if you go on Pinside, it's all over the Guardians of the Galaxy thread. I want to hear from you, the listener.

[17:11] Do you think Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be a hit or a miss? And why do you feel that way?

[17:17] Send me an email at canada pinball that's K-A-N-E-D-A pinball at gmail.com and I will read your answers on the air during the next episode.

[17:29] Okay. All right. What else we're going to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[17:35] I want to touch base. I don't want to read people specific emails. I want to say this. I did get some emails from people who were like,

[17:41] how could you go on on Batman? You railed on that game. You're such a hit for create. I can't believe you're going in on Batman.

[17:47] I gave you my reasons why I think the game is fun. I think the game is great theme integration. And like I said, it's the nostalgic value.

[17:57] It's that emotional connection I have to that theme that drew me in. And the new code is great. And I really do.

[18:05] I really do think lineman just has this thing that even if the shots aren't the greatest.

[18:13] When you think about all the things that coders are responsible for nowadays, right? It's the lights. It's the clips.

[18:21] It's the sound. Everything. Everything comes down after the shots themselves comes down to the coder.

[18:29] I mean, really a pinball machine is just an instrument. It is like a piano. And lineman sheets is Beethoven sitting at that piano.

[18:41] And he just knows how to make every game as best as that game can be. And I'm sorry, but you know, Batman might not be the best in certain areas.

[18:53] But it's one of the best themes and it's going to have one of the best codes. And it's got one of the best emotional appeals that any machine can have for a lot of people. And it's fun.

[19:04] And so I add all those things up. Obviously, I'm compromising some things. But I tell you, I've got a huge box full of mods sitting in my apartment, just waiting. And I'm excited.

[19:16] I'm really excited. I don't know when though. I've got so much other stuff going on in my world that I just have to figure out, you know, when this machine will arrive.

[19:26] On my last sort of special edition podcast, I talked about circus Maximus guys making kingpin and my thoughts on the remake.

[19:37] And I got a bunch of emails from people to saying, Chris, what, why do you care? Why do you care? Should these machines were never meant to be these rare select items?

[19:49] Isn't it better that a lot of them get made and more people could enjoy games like kingpin and big bang bar and King Kong and whatever?

[19:58] And that only eight people having one does nothing good for the hobby. And I get it. And I get why people would say that. And I get why my argument about remakes spoiling the rarity of these holy grails kind of is counterintuitive to what I've been saying recently about happiness and pinball.

[20:18] And happiness is not just trying to hoard in ultra rare item happiness is just playing games and having fun.

[20:26] Now the truth is that is somewhere in the middle of that right because there's also a collector side to this hobby. And if you completely remove collectibles like things that are worth collecting and then every game is the same and every game is they make as many as people want.

[20:43] And there's just thousands of everything out there and nothing is truly collectible. God help the value on your collections everything would just plummet immediately if everything just became a commodity.

[20:55] If there was just 5,000 versions of every game. Yeah sure everyone can have the same experience and there's no fighting to get a game early or any of that shenanigans.

[21:05] But doesn't that don't you lose some of the fun of the collector hobby if everyone can have everything. And I think that's sort of what I was talking about.

[21:16] I also heard and people sent me a link to this back glass artwork that is supposedly the the circus Maximus Translite for Kingpin.

[21:31] I'm not sure if this is true or not but they made 13 of these back glasses. And I've been told that they're actually going to redo the artwork on Kingpin.

[21:44] Okay so I'm really really nervous because if you look at this Dave Christensen Kingpin limited edition back glass.

[21:57] Guys just go to circus Maximus Games.com under product and Dave Christensen limited edition back glass. If they make the king if they remake Kingpin with this artwork.

[22:10] I don't think anyone's going to want it. They they should not go in this direction like this. This just looks like a like a menu from a Times Square restaurant.

[22:22] I don't mean to me mean or anything but that this is just not pinball art or what it should look like. So we'll see what happens.

[22:32] What I do know is they haven't even made their first game let alone their second game. But I've also heard from people within the hobby that this thing's been going on for a while.

[22:43] And that's great. Lots of stuff goes on for a while and number never comes to fruition. So I mean we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

[22:51] I just again I think remakes will continue to create volatility in this hobby. And I just wish companies would stop boasting about remakes until they're real.

[23:06] Like just stop teasing us and stop making claims and then taking years to build the stuff in your basements. I just don't understand what good that does the hobby.

[23:17] Okay. Speaking of remakes and redoing things in this latest weeks edition of this week in pinball they interview deep root pinball. Now my friends over at this week in pinball they they did something smart.

[23:36] This is a smart marketing move. They basically said and this is from you know Jeff Patterson who runs the site. They're basically like we interview deep root and everyone always goes to the site on Monday.

[23:49] He's like we're going to air the interview on Thursday and it's going to be something that makes some of you maybe excited some of you angry but come back Thursday.

[23:59] Now Jeff I have to give you kudos bro because that's a great marketing move. Little bait and switch. Now you get two hits for the price of one and we're all curious to see how that interview went.

[24:12] Now I spoke to Robert Mueller. I talked to him on the phone. I talked to people who were contacted by deep roots legal team. I know what their plans are.

[24:24] I'm interested to see if Robert reveals the same more or less of what he told me but deep roots plans are to remake magic girl in unlimited quantities.

[24:40] They want to make raza and they want to make Alice in Wonderland. They are going to work with John Papaduke.

[24:50] Not only that they think very very highly of John Papaduke. All of John's errors and John's pain and John's sort of mismanagement and all the see all the people John has burned.

[25:04] Those people aren't in the room when Robert's having dinner with John and his family and John puts on the sympathy act really really well.

[25:15] He can act like a very very nice guy. I don't think he's evil and malicious like Kevin who just legitimately stole people's money when he said he was going to give it back.

[25:26] But I do think that John has burned so many more people and so many more bridges than meet the eye that these guys who want to remake his machines and make people whole they have no idea the amount of people that need to be made whole because John probably doesn't even have any records of all the different vendors and people who did things for him.

[25:54] Under the promise of getting a game or getting some money off on a game.

[26:01] And so if you're going to start a pinball company, if you're going to start a brand new pinball company in 2017 or 2018, why in the world would you ever ever start off with John Papaduke?

[26:17] And why would you ever want the first chapter in your pinball company's history to be a negative one?

[26:25] And then you have to fight and claw your way out of that to get to somewhere positive. There's only one, there's only two things that I think drive someone to do that, to like hitch up with John Papaduke to make a successful pinball company.

[26:40] You're either really stupid or you have the world's biggest ego. Now it's probably the latter or maybe it's the former or maybe it is just both right?

[26:52] Because it is a stupid thing to do. But only a ginormous ego thinks that they can be the ones who make it work.

[27:04] Even though so many smart people, hardworking people have tried to make this thing work and have failed.

[27:12] If we ever do see versions of John's games, we won't see anything that remotely looks like John's games.

[27:20] And that's not just because of the zombie Eddie artwork. I'm not sure they'll be able to use that.

[27:25] But it's also because John Papaduke's engineering and his design and his layout and his geometry, none of it really works.

[27:35] So you've got to redo the whole thing, the whole thing. I still predict that they will never make more magic girls. I think they will, you know, they were smart.

[27:46] They would just have John do Alice in Wonderland start there. It's an open IP. I would bank, Repzidware and I would just stop with the whole remake, you know, making everybody whole because you just can't do the numbers in a way that makes it work out.

[28:02] And something interesting that this week in pinball said, they said that deep roots intentions are to make for our ease and price them like a Kia.

[28:12] And how many times have we seen this over and over and over again, where newcomers to the hobby, think they can do it for less than it really cost.

[28:22] They don't understand the hurdles, the delays, how everything chips away at the bottom line. They don't understand about vendors and parts.

[28:33] And all the intricacies that go into making pinball machines, you know why Robert doesn't understand that because Robert's never made a pinball machine and he's never ran a pinball company.

[28:45] And even if he hires people from different pinball backgrounds, I guarantee you those people also probably didn't understand the business side of pinball.

[28:56] You know, there's something about being an employee within an industry or category and doing your job and doing it very well.

[29:04] There's another thing about running a business and a pinball business, right, because we're going to cover this next in the response from highway pinball investors and these guys who are very wealthy businessmen who have succeeded in a lot of other areas of business and how humbling and how ill prepared.

[29:25] They were to succeed in the business of pinball, okay, so we'll see Thursday what deep roots says, but I'm more I'm my prediction is they're going to say they're going to make John's games.

[29:37] They're not going to fully commit. They'll give some half answers. They won't give a real timeline. It'll probably take years and a few years from now who's going to give a shit about magic girl 2020, okay.

[29:49] I think guys who have magic girls, I think they're still going to be worth, you know, a small fortune because you're never going to see a game built like that with if these guys are trying to, you know, build a Ferrari and sell for the price of a Kia.

[30:03] So speaking of other investors and businessmen entering pinball and finding it pretty difficult, we've finally heard this past week from the highway pinball investors.

[30:18] We've covered highway, we've covered no one's covered highway pinball more than anyone, all right. I was even asking my friend Ryan over at head to head pinball.

[30:27] Like did you guys cover the highway pinball announcement that the investors he said, no, I think people are tired of hearing about that story.

[30:35] And I'm like, yeah, maybe, right. I mean, I think it does get a little old. The merry go round that is highway pinball, but it's news and we're hearing from these guys and I wanted to sort of just call out some things they said.

[30:47] I'm going to try not to read the entire letter from the new team, right. So let's see, they basically say like, hi, it's us.

[30:59] We inherited the company from Andrew highway in early June. There's been all this speculation from various pinball forms and from some journalists.

[31:08] I wonder if they're referring to me as a journalist that they'd be exciting. They might be legitimizing this podcast about what is going on at the company.

[31:17] So we wanted to tell you directly as you have invested interest in our company.

[31:23] They say nearly six months ago, we took over a business with a not quite finished alien machine in empty bank account.

[31:32] Many refund requests paid for and deposit down orders, supplier and other bills and hardly any part of the factory with which to make machines.

[31:43] So I think right there they have come clean and said highway pinball was flat broke.

[31:51] Not just that, they were heavily in debt and they didn't have any parts. They didn't have any money and they owed people money.

[32:01] So what does that mean if you had at that point in June of 2017, if you had your money with Andrew highway, your money was gone.

[32:14] You were never getting a machine. The company was in solvent. It was over. It was over.

[32:22] And as we all know, you can blame everyone or Andrew highway could take the blame. It was his company and it ended up where it was because of his business decisions.

[32:35] They go on to say we had hoped that more of you would have had their machines by now.

[32:41] But due to technical delays, unforeseen bills and more refund requests than anticipated to mention some, it is taking a little longer than we planned.

[32:52] We think that the extra time we are spending on quality control is paying off.

[32:58] The feedback we are now receiving on the alien is good from customers. There are still some improvements to be made, but we are working on these every day.

[33:07] We will dissect each paragraph as we go through this.

[33:14] The technical delays we all get. There are still some quality issues that are plaguing people's machines.

[33:21] But I think people in the hobby kind of expect that from a game that is coming out under this circumstance, that quality control and a lot of testing are going to be difficult.

[33:34] In terms of refund requests, we heard Andrew also blaming me for the refund request.

[33:44] If you start a business and you tell people you can get your money back if you want it back before we make your game, then you know what?

[33:54] If people want to refund, you can't then say, nope, we are not going to give you one.

[33:58] We still know there is something upwards of a moment that is $40,000 in refund requests that these gentlemen won't give out yet.

[34:06] They are going to talk about this. Let's keep going on.

[34:09] They say, we know that it has been frustrating sitting on the outside not knowing what is happening, but it has been just as frustrating for us due to all the unknowns and uncertainties that have been given.

[34:23] If we say something one week, we might have to change it the next week due to new developments.

[34:32] The difficult aspect for us is as proven, whenever we have said anything, it has been twisted and turned on social media and some of it has spun out of control.

[34:46] I want to stop there and talk about that line for a minute because I think this is a really important thing they are saying.

[34:55] I think it is something that we hear all the time.

[34:58] I would love to know this.

[35:01] What did social media say?

[35:04] You know they mean one thing and one thing only. Maybe two things. You know they mean pin-side.

[35:11] You know they mean podcasts like mine.

[35:15] When they say that things have been spun on social media, they are blaming the forum for holding them accountable to the very things that they say.

[35:27] You have to remember, if you just go back in their own words in June, they said they were going to be shipping lots and lots of machines by August and that Elise would be out by then.

[35:40] This Friday will be December 1st and not a single Ellie owner has their game.

[35:49] At the very beginning of this paragraph, when they are saying it has been frustrating for us, should we have sympathy for these men?

[36:00] That is what they are asking for.

[36:03] I know it has been hard on you guys but it has been hard on us. We inherited a company that had a lot more problems than we realized.

[36:09] Now my question is, if you really analyze the business you were getting into, shouldn't you have seen all of these issues?

[36:20] Now what happened, right? Did Andrew highway, did he sort of, on his way out the door, paint a picture that wasn't as bad as it really was?

[36:32] Knowing Andrew and knowing the way he operates, I am assuming he was very convincing on the fact that this whole thing could be turned around with just a little more money.

[36:43] That is always the solution with these failing companies, especially in Pimball, is they just think if I can get a little more money, then I can finish it.

[36:54] And once the games are out, orders are going to fly in. If I can just raise some money with Raza, I can finish building magic.

[37:02] It is the same story, just different company.

[37:05] I was disappointed to hear them blame social media. I don't think there is anybody to blame but Andrew highway.

[37:12] I think he is the main reason why people almost lost all their money. He is the main reason why these new investors are struggling to get this company off the ground.

[37:24] He is the reason why a lot of, as they will say, employees have quit. Why it is hard to get new talent over there, why it is hard to get vendors to be excited about working with them.

[37:36] Andrew highway, his name is on the door. I think what these gentlemen need to do is they need to change the name of the company.

[37:45] Why would you continue to keep it called Andrew highway when Andrew highway basically puts you into such a mess?

[37:51] They also go on to say, that is why we have decided to limit information from our side on these forums and keep our focus on getting the product out the door at the right quality.

[38:06] We also see that many of the social media comments are honest reactions and comments but some seem to be posted to pour gasoline on the fire.

[38:17] Even from people that we do not have on our order book, we hope you can understand our choice of silence in this matter.

[38:26] Let's analyze that. They are basically saying, we are going to go quiet. We are not going to talk on social media in the places where people discuss companies like ours.

[38:39] While some of the feedback is acceptable, we are also getting people that are not happy with us who do not even have an order of an alien pinball machine.

[38:51] Because of that, we are going to go into the dark and keep information to ourselves.

[39:00] Now the problem with that, as we all know, is the one thing that most people are always looking for in this hobby is transparency, is information.

[39:11] Why can't you simply give people a weekly update on where things are going with highway pinball?

[39:20] Why can't you give people information on where the LEDs are or what the LEDs will entail?

[39:27] Now the problem with blaming social media and blaming forms and doing what these gentlemen are doing is it's completely removing any responsibility from themselves.

[39:38] It's basically saying people are misconstruing what we're saying so we're not going to say anything anymore.

[39:44] And that's unfair. I'll tell you why it's unfair. It's unfair because then all the people who paid money, who have invested in this company, they deserve to know what's going on.

[39:56] And the status of their machines. So whether you want to do an email like once a week like Dutch was doing, you know, Stern's doing the monthly state of the union, whatever it is, the reason why you should never go silent, and this is the reason why, is because you as a company, you get to control what you say 100%.

[40:18] And if what you say is appropriate and doesn't have any false promises, then there shouldn't be any issue with you speaking your mind and telling people what's going on at highway pinball.

[40:32] The problem is, and this, and Andrew highway started this whole thing, is he started lying about the updates.

[40:41] He started lying about the timelines. He started saying things that he knew wouldn't come true because he was hoping people wouldn't ask for refunds.

[40:53] And I think these guys are kind of doing the same thing a little bit. I think they're just like, they're trying to stop the refund bleeding and just let the games do the talking.

[41:04] And I said that months ago, if you go listen to my old podcast, that was going to be their strategy. The problem is, they've been getting the games out too slow and too few to really stop people from wanting to get out for the time being.

[41:19] Okay. All right, let's go, let's just, let's keep going to this. So they said factory updates will be posted on our Facebook page. We promise to be in direct contact with all of our pre-order customers with good news and bad.

[41:33] And as soon as we have the plan production week for your machine, we will tell you we hope to have delivered the machines to all of you by late Q1 2018.

[41:45] So once again, the thing that always boggles my mind is the only thing that always gets all these companies into trouble are dates.

[41:55] Q1 2018, at least they said by late, they gave themselves enough time. But if I'm a pinball guy and I have a company that's always missed my deadlines and Q1 late Q1, I would just be like, why don't you say late Q2?

[42:13] Whatever, at this point, it's 2018. This game was announced in 2013, five years later. And then they said after that, but please don't kill us if it takes a little longer.

[42:27] People are already fed up. People have already given up. People don't have a choice. And that's sort of, that's sort of the point of all of this, right?

[42:38] I read through all of this and I read their entire response and I'm kind of not going to go through the rest of it because I'm still reading stuff where they're starting to talk about the LE trims.

[42:50] There's going to be three different trim levels of LEs, which again, I think goes to show that that makes no sense, that makes making LEs much harder for them.

[43:00] They tried to sort of say, oh yeah, we're going to give the PDI glass in the game that they've worked with Rome in PDI glass and he's going to supply the glass from our machines.

[43:15] This add-on is offered at $250 and this is what I don't get. What you're offering people, like this glass on the LE or for their machines, at the price that glass cost anybody.

[43:33] So you're not, I'm just confused, like if it's an add-on, how is that part of the LE package that people paid more for?

[43:42] So that part to me just didn't seem to make sense. So look, look, I just want to say this to these new investors, to Dave Sanders, to the people over at highway, to Orrick Lawson waiting for his machine, to all the people who still have not received their refunds.

[44:01] Because they said in here that they have a timeline of when they can pay money back and it's sort of spread out over a period of months.

[44:14] So the reality is this. And this is just something that everyone who's invested in highway pinball, everyone who's waiting for Anilian pinball, is you really, I finished reading this and I just said, no one has a choice.

[44:28] There's really nothing you can do. You are on this ride, whether you like it or not, whether you want to be on the ride or not. At this point, you can't get off.

[44:40] You can't get your refunds. All refund requests will go unheard now for an undisclosed amount of time.

[44:50] You know, it doesn't matter how many times you email them, it doesn't matter how many times you call them, they're not going to give you a refund immediately.

[44:57] So you have no choice but to just be on the ride. And I know the ride's not good. I know you don't want to be on the ride. You either want your machine, which gets you off the ride, or you want your money back, which gets you off the ride.

[45:13] But you don't want to be on the train of waiting with fingers crossed, not knowing when you're going to get your machine or when you're going to get your money.

[45:24] And I think people are tired. And I think these investors really shouldn't have blamed anyone else. They should have said, we're sorry.

[45:34] Here's what I would have said. We're sorry. This is what I would have coached them to say, we're sorry. We invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in Andrew Highway's dream of making the UK's first pinball manufacturer.

[45:52] Andrew Highway was building a large factory to be competitive with other manufacturers in this industry. Over a period of years, many decisions were made that led to the mismanagement of funds, many obstacles and hurdles developed along the way.

[46:11] And you highway was asked to step down and we are now taking over the organization. Because of that mismanagement, we are now sinking a lot more money into this company to make sure that you get your alien pinball machine.

[46:25] We are fully committed to that. Everything that has occurred or transpired is the fault of the company and the organization itself.

[46:36] Partially to blame on Andrew, partially to blame for us not overseeing things as well as we should have. But we are committed to making it right. We hope you have patience with us.

[46:46] If you ask for a refund, refunds will not go out that quickly. We hope you stay on for the ride. We are not going to stop until we get everyone their machine. We just hope you have patience. Thank you. If you have any questions, hit us up.

[47:01] What they need to do is talk to people who want to stay on but they went about it all wrong. They went about it in the silent approach. They made people anxious. They weren't responding to people's refund requests. All it takes is four or five people to say they are not giving me my money and then there is a run on the bank.

[47:24] You guys exhausted? I feel the pain of all of you that have been waiting for this game. What sucks is the reports of people are enjoying the game. People think the game is great. We have people cheerleading the game.

[47:43] But what people can't do is like that MK, whatever 86 dude who has the alien avatar, he is the one who started the thread about all the refund requests and the second the highway investors chimed in, he is like I am going to ask the mods to take down that thread and let's get rid of that.

[48:02] No, the whole point of that was to not scrub information that people need to know before a new people get suckered in the giving money. No one should be sending money until everyone who already bought games has made whole.

[48:19] But it never ceases to amaze me how quickly people believe whatever they are told whenever the Pimbal manufacturer speaks. And yet Stern, a company that at least ships machines every quarter is constantly chastised and be littled and made fun of.

[48:41] And yet all these other companies that are the real criminals are constantly given a past time and time again. And I think this hobby should be someone ashamed of itself.

[48:53] The constant crucifixion of the only company that has never stolen money from people or made people wait years for a machine or flat out lied over and over again.

[49:08] Alright, I mean spooky too. Right. So yeah, alright. Let's see what else is going on in the hobby. I had a few show notes. There's not too much going on. American Pimbal is getting ready to produce Houdini.

[49:27] The assembly line is going. I think production is like kind of started. They're just maybe waiting on a couple parts, but I see the assembly line. I didn't see any workers.

[49:38] So that always I think we're at the point out to where you can show an image of a bunch of games on a rotisserie and nobody there.

[49:47] I want to see a bunch of people with screwdrivers in hand and I mean a bunch of people because what we've all been burned by like three guys at highway with screwdrivers.

[49:57] But Josh Kugler uploaded a great video to YouTube of the most recent gameplay footage with new code and everything. And I encourage all of you to watch the video because I think it gives you a good feel for the game.

[50:15] What I did like about the game. I know some people might be torn on this. I love the callouts where each mode is actually like a tutorial on what to do. Right. It's not just like like blinking lights and you have to read.

[50:30] It's basically like shoot. Shoot the right red arrow then you're going to want to shoot the left arrow then shoot into the stage and then Houdini will catch the bullet with his teeth.

[50:42] Like it was very like matter of fact here's what you need to do. And I thought that was great because I think for people who are casual players. And when new people are going up to a machine.

[50:55] Those kinds of instructions are so freaking helpful. And I think most pinball machines are head scratching, confusing things for new to pinball people are just casual players. So I really thought that was neat.

[51:08] And so for you guys who watch that and see that and are like oh this is going to get boring and get old. You can turn it off after you learn the game. But I think it's great because you can start to learn and get a feel for a game with audio cues.

[51:22] And then turn those off when you memorize how to play the game which I think is great. I think Houdini at $7,000 is competitive. I hope they get production going soon.

[51:35] I do think not having games out during the holidays is a little unfortunate. Simply because I think people spend a lot of money during the holidays and their wallets are going to close up a little bit.

[52:18] So the stabilization kit for your node boards. Apparently those node boards can come loose which can cause problems with the game. So it looks like it's like some sort of like zip tie sort of deal to stabilize those.

[52:31] What else is going on in pinball? I mean I think that's kind of like the news news. I don't think I'm missing anything. I think this big thing you know nowadays is just all going to come down to people playing games with this kind of game.

[52:47] People playing games before they buy them. And I want to close this podcast with just you know just sort of that advice. I think we all will learn that sooner or later. Some of us learn that right away. Some of us don't even care about owning new machines.

[53:03] But I'll say this there's a liberating freedom when you stop caring about having to have the next thing when you just give up on it. And you just let a game come out. You let a game mature.

[53:17] You let a game develop. And then you make up your mind whether or not you want one. And the reason why I just think that's just such a smarter approach.

[53:28] Because no matter what game you want, no matter how rare it is, you can go get it at any time if you offer the right amount of money for that game. No matter what it is, you can go get it.

[53:43] And it's much better to go after something when you're completely sure it's the game you want, the game you've played, the game you've enjoyed. I'd rather spend like for example, let's say Batman Ellie, let's say Batman Ellie turns into an amazing game.

[54:04] And you know, it's maybe hard to get Ellie's and they originally sold for what was the only $10,000 right and you want a Batman Ellie. Let's say you go try and get one now.

[54:19] If you offered $10,000 for a Batman Ellie, I'm sure you might pry one from someone's hands. If you offered $11,000, I bet you'd have one immediately.

[54:32] Now, you'd pay $1,000 more, but you wouldn't have had to suffer for a year, you wouldn't have had anxiety, you wouldn't have any bad memories of owning a Batman, you would simply be paying a little bit of a premium, but you'd have none of that angst.

[54:52] And I think that's the lesson learned. I think especially as people see games like think about all the suffering people want through with the Hobbit. Think about it for a minute.

[55:01] All the years people waited for the Hobbit, their money was tied up. Now you can go get that game for like two to $3,000 cheaper than it was brand new with hardly any plays in perfect condition with final code.

[55:18] And what is the ultimate takeaway is that it just always pays to wait. If it weren't for just a few games like Tron Ali and a few other anomaly games where like the Ellie's were like you sold out right away, this whole hobby would be different.

[55:39] And so I think we're reached a point now, especially with like Guardians and these call outs and the really bad code at launch again with another Stern machine. Just wait a year, a year from now.

[55:52] You guys all know this, a year from now. If you really want to Guardians, you'll be able to get a Guardians of the Galaxy Ellie, which in 2017 and November sold for like $8,600, you'll be able to go get it.

[56:08] For like $6,800 a year from now, you just will because by then five new Stern machines are out. Nobody wants Guardians like the Avenger, you know, whatever, whatever happens to it. It's not going to go up and value ever.

[56:25] The code will be done and you'll just you'll just know what you're getting. Everything else I buy in my life, everything you guys buy in your life, you pay for it when it's finished.

[56:36] I just wouldn't pay for anything until it's pretty much finished or near finished. I know I said that it's like I have like a Batman that I'm looking for and it's it's not finished, but I know it's going to be finished. And I know it's now it's like a good game.

[56:52] So I hope I'm making the right decision. Guys, have a great week. We'll be back. I'm going to get some more guests on the show. I feel like it's just been me and bubba snowing in the background, but we'll talk to you all real soon.
