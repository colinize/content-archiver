[00:00] And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough to fill up this last can.

[00:04] Man, while I'm surviving this climate of what, they said I was washed up and got a bloodbath.

[00:08] I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter. I can adjust. Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust.

[00:14] So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss.

[00:16] Cedar, Cedar, Cedar, Cedar, Cedar, Cedar.

[00:30] And that's the greatest thing right now, right? We've got Naps Arcade giving everybody what's going on in Pinball.

[00:35] But the reason you tune into Canadian Pinball Podcast isn't because I'm gonna be playing

[00:40] a lot of games, but I'm gonna be playing a lot of games.

[00:42] I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, but I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[00:46] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[00:49] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[00:52] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:00] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:03] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:06] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:08] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:11] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:13] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:16] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:18] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:20] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:22] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:24] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:26] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:28] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:30] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:32] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:34] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:36] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:38] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:40] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:42] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:44] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:46] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:48] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:50] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:52] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:54] and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games, and I'm gonna be playing a lot of games,

[01:56] So Homepin continues to do the strangest pinball launch ever around their game, Spinal Tap.

[02:02] So have you seen this? Like basically they put out the manual,

[02:06] like the service manual on this game.

[02:09] So the first time we're seeing the true layout of Spinal Tap Pinball Machine,

[02:14] we're looking at it in like CAD format on a pinball manual.

[02:19] Now I will say like, I think some companies could use like some sort of teasers like this,

[02:25] like you could launch a pinball machine with just the schematics,

[02:28] and make people try to imagine what the game is like.

[02:31] The only thing is that only works if the game you have is gonna blow people away when they finally see it,

[02:38] and I think when people finally see Spinal Tap, they're gonna be like,

[02:41] this was not worth the wait.

[02:44] You know, they had Thunderbirds, which is arguably one of the worst games in the last 10 years,

[02:49] and now they're doing this.

[02:50] Now we will get the official reveal of this game sometime at the end of September at a pinball show in Australia.

[02:59] So don't hold your breath. Don't save your money,

[03:03] because I think when this game comes out, it is gonna be pretty much dead on arrival.

[03:09] Man, Kanata, why did you start out with Homepin?

[03:12] Like this is the worst way to start a podcast, because you're starting out with a company nobody cares about.

[03:18] Let's go on to American Pinball.

[03:20] So we know this about American Pinball's next game.

[03:24] We know they are going to preview it at the tailgating party,

[03:29] the super awesome pinball show, and Cointaker tailgating party over at Cointaker in Pennsylvania on Saturday, September 24th.

[03:38] We know it's Dennis Nordman's next game.

[03:41] We know Christopher Franci is on artwork.

[03:44] Now I think it's gonna be a tank-based game like Galactic Tank Force,

[03:48] and I think it's gonna be a follow-up to Dennis Nordman's game.

[03:52] I think it's gonna be a follow-up to his 1982 game, Rapid Fire.

[03:58] So if you look at this game, it's got like two Tron joysticks on the apron,

[04:03] and you fire these mini sort of like pinballs.

[04:06] They look like BB's at targets.

[04:08] And so if it's a tank-based game, and it's a follow-up to one of his previous games,

[04:13] I think it could be this.

[04:15] Now this game came out. It was a solid-state game in 1982,

[04:18] and they made 5,000 of them.

[04:21] Get ready for the price.

[04:22] Back then, it was like 900 bucks.

[04:24] So we will see.

[04:25] Is it gonna be a game in which you play as a tank operator,

[04:29] and you are firing balls up the playfield at targets?

[04:33] See, here's why I think it might be this,

[04:35] because I think American Pinball's strategy is to make something that is operator-friendly.

[04:40] And that means if you make this kind of game,

[04:42] I think it's gonna be a very simple, approachable walk-up to the machine

[04:46] and know what to do game.

[04:48] The problem is in pinball these days,

[04:50] is if you make something operator-friendly, that's simple and easy to understand

[04:55] and an easy game to get through,

[04:57] if you make your game that way,

[04:59] you're not gonna really find a lot of home buyers.

[05:02] And the primary audience for these machines at these prices

[05:06] is still gonna be the home buyers.

[05:08] The other question I had was this,

[05:10] is how is the Super Awesome Pinball show going to preview this at a tailgating party?

[05:17] Because there isn't like a scheduled moment in which American Pinball is doing something.

[05:22] And so are they gonna show some artwork?

[05:25] Are they gonna show a little bit of the playfield?

[05:28] Are they gonna release a video?

[05:30] Here's my advice for them.

[05:31] Whatever they do do.

[05:33] I hope it's more than just words.

[05:36] I hope it's more than just a little piece of artwork.

[05:39] I also hope whatever they do do.

[05:42] Can I say do do one more time?

[05:44] Do do, Scooby Doo do's coming out from spooky.

[05:46] I hope whatever they do.

[05:48] I hope they release it to the internet in a high quality format so everybody can enjoy it.

[05:54] Because it really does make absolutely no sense

[05:58] to preview this game for the very first time on planet earth

[06:02] at a tailgating party in which just a couple hundred people will be at

[06:06] when you could simply launch it on the internet in which a couple million people could possibly see it.

[06:11] Well, more like 2,000 people.

[06:13] This is pinball, not video games.

[06:15] And I also saw a good decision by American Pinball.

[06:18] They are now gonna start putting Titan rubbers and bands in all of their games moving forward.

[06:24] And I think this is a really good move.

[06:26] I also think it's long overdue.

[06:28] Because if you think about these pinball machines, you spend so much money on them.

[06:33] And then in just a few hundred plays, some of these games, like their rubbers just disintegrate.

[06:39] I'm looking right at you, Jersey Jack Pinball.

[06:42] Why is it that everyone who buys a super expensive machine from JJP,

[06:46] after 200 plays, the rubbers go to crap?

[06:50] I was looking up the rubbers on Toy Story at Jack Bar.

[06:53] They were also completely black, completely worn out so early on in a game's cycle.

[06:59] And these Titan rubbers, they last much, much longer.

[07:02] And they only cost like $25.

[07:05] So if you're gonna buy this like 8 to 10 to 12 to $15,000 toy,

[07:11] the least these companies could do is put quality rubbers in the game.

[07:16] So I think that's a good move by American Pinball.

[07:19] I'm not really seeing much traction on how many legends of Bahá'ála's are being made a week.

[07:25] For some reason, in the boutique world, the one question we can't get any company to answer,

[07:32] how many games a week are you capable of making?

[07:38] And the second question, why is it a secret?

[07:41] Why can't your customers know the time frame in which they can expect the product?

[07:47] It's a really strange thing.

[07:50] Alright, let's go over to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[07:53] Again, this is just random the order I'm doing these companies in.

[07:56] Now, a huge rumor was posted on Naps Arcade.

[07:59] And I hope this rumor is true.

[08:01] Dennis Kressel over at the Eclectic Gamers podcast talked about this on his rumor segment.

[08:06] He said that the rumor is this, that Jersey Jack Pinball has the license to make.

[08:13] This would be a take my money now theme for me, and that is Top Gun.

[08:18] Now, I didn't see much pickup of this on Pinside, and that just goes to show you,

[08:22] I think people don't really care much about rumors that are going to take years to come to fruition.

[08:29] But let's talk about this for a minute.

[08:31] Do we think Top Gun makes a great theme for Jersey Jack?

[08:34] Yes, it does.

[08:35] Would it be a great theme for Steve Ritchie because he made F-14 Tomcat?

[08:40] Yes, it does.

[08:41] Which Top Gun would you rather have?

[08:44] See, I'm torn now on this because the new movie is so damn good.

[08:49] Did you see the news yesterday?

[08:51] Top Gun Maverick, the new film, just surpassed Titanic as the seventh highest grossing movie of all time.

[09:00] I would argue that this new film is better than the first movie.

[09:05] You can't have this one without the first one.

[09:08] For most of us, I would argue that yes, the original Top Gun would be the smarter game to make

[09:15] because that's the film everybody grew up with.

[09:17] But I'm here to tell you right now, I would not be disappointed if this company made Top Gun Maverick.

[09:23] This isn't like Toy Story 4 level of disappointment.

[09:26] I also wouldn't be disappointed if it was just the first movie, and I would be super happy if it was both movies.

[09:33] So I think this is a no-lose situation if Jersey Jack-Pinball can get the Top Gun license.

[09:39] Now, if they do get the Top Gun license, they're going to need to get movie footage.

[09:46] And I mean this.

[09:47] This isn't the kind of film with those iconic lines.

[09:51] And both movies have like great lines and great scenes.

[09:54] I need to see Tom Cruise on a screen delivering the line to me.

[10:00] I need to see Tom Cruise and Goose say, I feel the need for speed.

[10:05] I need to have, you know, I know all you guys want this scene too.

[10:08] You gotta have the scene in the locker room when Iceman chomps.

[10:12] That's right Maverick.

[10:14] I'm dangerous, you know, and then chomps his teeth.

[10:16] Like we need to see that scene.

[10:18] So I hope if they get this license, they actually get the assets.

[10:22] But if history has shown us anything, Jersey Jack-Pinball just doesn't get the assets.

[10:28] You know, Jack got up there at TPF and said, we always get all the assets in all of our games.

[10:33] And I don't think anything can be further from the truth.

[10:36] But I think the overwhelming reaction, if this is true, I hope the Billy Joel rumor is false.

[10:43] I don't want Billy Joel Pinball.

[10:46] I was told Billy Joel Pinball by a good source of mind that that is something they are working on.

[10:52] Now, the other thing, Jack Winari went on the Super Awesome Pinball show and he said something along the lines.

[10:57] We have four games in production.

[11:00] Now, Jersey Jack-Pinball can have 18 games in production.

[11:04] It doesn't matter how many games you have in production.

[11:08] It doesn't matter how many games you're currently designing.

[11:11] It doesn't even matter how many designers you have on staff.

[11:14] What matters is how well you execute and how efficiently you execute.

[11:20] And I think all of us look at Jersey Jack-Pinball and we say, look, this company can only make one game

[11:26] every 18 months.

[11:28] And so if you were to go down that schedule and Jack even said, like, I'm hoping to get the next game out in nine months.

[11:35] So that's basically Jack hoping that they can cut in half the wait for the next game.

[11:40] Jack Winari, don't forget this people, has also gone on the record multiple times

[11:46] and guaranteed us years ago that this company would be able to ship two new games in a year

[11:52] or reveal two new games in a year.

[11:55] They have yet to do that.

[11:57] Will we see Godfather by the end of the year?

[11:59] I doubt it.

[12:00] I absolutely doubt it.

[12:02] But the one thing going in our favor to get the next Jersey Jack-Pinball machine is the sales of Toy Story 4.

[12:09] If these sales bottom out and I think they're starting to flat line already, I don't think they're dead.

[12:15] They're just flat.

[12:16] Like right now, Toy Story 4 sales are flat.

[12:19] You know, if you're looking at the market and you're studying this right now, as of today,

[12:24] you can go get an ellie of this machine for around $11,000 new in box.

[12:30] You can buy a brand new collector's edition for $14,000.

[12:35] But here's the scary part.

[12:36] If you're looking at the market, the games aren't even selling quickly at that price.

[12:41] In fact, the CEs aren't selling at all.

[12:44] And so if I were you and I was looking at Toy Story, I would do this.

[12:49] I would jump on one, make sure you really, really want to own it.

[12:54] And then the second thing I would do if I were you is I would just wait.

[12:58] I think Toy Story 4 is going to be one of these games that trades hands very often.

[13:04] And here's why.

[13:05] I think the game is overpriced.

[13:07] So I don't think you're going to see a lot of people buying it at full price new in box.

[13:11] When people do buy it, they're going to beat the game in about a month or two.

[13:15] And I think that's what's going to happen.

[13:17] I think that's the unfortunate thing about this game is I don't think it's a long term

[13:22] keeper for people that are even decent at pinball.

[13:25] And that's fine.

[13:26] Like you're going to buy it.

[13:27] You're going to get your fun for two months.

[13:29] But then I think you're going to want to move it on.

[13:31] The other part that's going to happen to is this is people who buy it, they know the market on this

[13:37] game is really soft.

[13:39] And so they're going to want to get out while the getting is somewhat good or not as bad.

[13:44] They're going to want to stop the bleeding on their investment.

[13:46] So that's my advice for all of you out there.

[13:49] Play the game, make up your mind if you want it.

[13:52] But I think if you wait, you're going to end up saving yourself thousands and thousands of dollars.

[13:58] And this isn't a game in which we're going to see some major code update down the road.

[14:03] That's going to bring everybody back to the game.

[14:05] A lot of people point out Willy Wonka as a game in which the demand came later on in the product cycle.

[14:11] And yes, there was a major, major code update in Willy Wonka that did one thing.

[14:16] It made the game much easier to get through.

[14:20] It's still not that easy.

[14:22] It's not nearly as easy to get through Willy Wonka as Toy Story.

[14:26] But I also just looking at both machines and looking at both games and seeing both games being played by people who are amazing.

[14:33] I still think Willy Wonka has such better moments and pinball moments than Toy Story 4 does.

[14:41] Like there's nothing in Toy Story 4 that's nearly as good as like Wonka's office or pure imagination

[14:48] or the Oompa Loompa mode in which they turn the camera around.

[14:52] Like I don't even see anything creative happening with the camera on Toy Story 4.

[14:57] And I think that's just going to be the pathway of this game.

[14:59] I think it's going to keep sliding in price.

[15:02] And I think the dealers and distributors and podcasters that need to sell you their allotment and their inventory are going to go on a never ending mission to sell you this game.

[15:13] But it's not going to work.

[15:14] Speaking of Jersey Jack in Prices, I got an email from someone who asked me, Chris,

[15:19] like what do you think the second hand price is on a Guns N' Roses limited edition?

[15:25] And this one is hard, right?

[15:27] Because GNRLE when it first came out, it was $9,500.

[15:32] And then they bumped the price all the way up to $11,000 for new and box games.

[15:37] And the word on the street is that they're still making GNRLEs.

[15:41] Now, distributors have them.

[15:43] Like if you want a GNRLE, you can go get one today.

[15:46] New and box.

[15:47] You could have it by the weekend.

[15:48] New and box.

[15:49] But would I pay $11,000 for a GNRLE?

[15:53] No, there's like so many of them out there.

[15:56] The used market right now, if you go on Pinside, it's somewhere around like $95,000 to $9,800.

[16:02] Like kind of like the original price of the game.

[16:04] I wouldn't pay that.

[16:05] I would also wait.

[16:06] Because here's the thing.

[16:07] They made about three to four thousand of these GNRLEs.

[16:11] And I think there are just so many out there.

[16:14] I think if you really want one today, you're probably going to have to spend around $9,500.

[16:20] I bet if you offered someone nine grand, you'd probably meet somewhere in the middle like $9,200.

[16:26] But where do I think the price of guns and roses will go in the future?

[16:31] And I mean it when I say this.

[16:32] I think the LES are going to slide down for a little bit.

[16:36] I think they're going to slide down to like 8,000 to 8,500 within a year from now.

[16:41] I also think the Collectors Editions are going to have a dip.

[16:44] They're already having a dip.

[16:45] I think they're going to dip down to $14,15,000.

[16:48] But here is what I think is going to happen in the long term.

[16:51] I don't think Jersey Jack Pinball is ever going to get a game with the amount of assets in it as GNR.

[16:57] I think guns and roses is going to age really, really well.

[17:02] I think the gameplay is not for everybody.

[17:05] And I think for people out there who don't like the constant multi-balls, I think that's going to be an issue for you.

[17:10] And I think if you don't love guns and roses, it's also going to be an issue for you.

[17:15] I just think this is the ultimate guns and roses concert in a box.

[17:18] But I understand why people are not going to get the same satisfaction out of it if they're looking for like an incredible shooting pin.

[17:25] Remember, this game still has like the weaker flippers.

[17:28] It's got tons of multi-balls, which you know, you do feel like you're chopping away versus using skill.

[17:34] It's more of a concert than a pinball experience.

[17:37] I mean, that's why I love it.

[17:39] Now, here's the thing I want someone to do for me.

[17:41] Can someone do me a favor?

[17:43] Because I think there is something happening that we're forgetting about.

[17:46] And that was the promise by Jersey Jack Pinball to sell us at cost replacement playfields for guns and roses machines.

[17:55] Many of us out there, many of us owners have machines where we would like to buy a backup playfield.

[18:02] They said they were going to do that for us when guns and roses production ceased in the summer of 2022.

[18:11] It is now mid-August 2022, and they have not officially said anything about these replacements.

[18:18] I talked to Ken Cromwell.

[18:20] He checked with his guys and the plan is still to offer these, but I would like for us to just know when.

[18:27] Because I think everyone out there who's got a CE playfield definitely wants a backup.

[18:32] And all of you LE guys that had a lot of issues, I know you would probably want one as well.

[18:37] Because when you go to sell your guns and roses machine, or if you want to keep it, it's just nice piece of mind knowing you've got a backup.

[18:45] And hopefully these backups are going to be made more like the Toy Story playfields, which are not having issues.

[18:52] So can someone do me a favor and start a pin side thread and just ask this question.

[18:59] Replacement playfields for guns and roses question mark and just say, hey, has anyone heard any news on whether or not Jersey Jack Pinball is going to sell us the playfields at cost as they indicated they would.

[19:13] Thank you so much.

[19:14] Whoever does that, I will send you a Canadian mug.

[19:18] Okay, it's worth it.

[19:19] It's the best mug in all the pinball podcasting.

[19:22] I'm going to send you the new Canadian non refundable mug.

[19:24] It's super funny.

[19:25] All right, let's go on to Chicago gaming company.

[19:27] The wait continues like people are still waiting for their cactus Canyon LEs.

[19:33] The rumor on the street is that this company can make 40 games a week.

[19:38] And if you start to do the math on how many orders they got, you're now looking at almost a two year production cycle to make all these cactus Canyon games.

[19:48] Now, here's the thing with CGC.

[19:50] It took them three years to get this game out.

[19:53] It's now going to take them two years to make them.

[19:56] That's a five year cycle for one title that is simply a remake five years people.

[20:04] Stern pinball in five years will put out 20 plus games, new inbox, new code, new art, everything designed from the ground up.

[20:15] This company to me continues to be embarrassing.

[20:18] And now it just becomes a question of this.

[20:20] It's like your time.

[20:22] I think when it comes down to it, I'm noticing this debate.

[20:25] I think the most valuable thing we have in life is time.

[20:29] And when it comes down to it, I think there are two camps of people.

[20:32] I think there are people that just set it and forget it.

[20:35] You give your deposit and you don't care.

[20:38] You're willing to wait as long as it takes to get your game because in the end you feel like it will be worth it.

[20:45] And then there are people who want their game now.

[20:47] Like I want it now.

[20:49] Like you sold me a product.

[20:50] You said it was going on the line soon.

[20:53] I gave you my money in a non refundable way and now you haven't told us anything.

[20:58] And I think, look, for most of us out there, if you went in on this game, you knew you were going to be waiting a long time.

[21:05] But my gripe in all of this, it's how these manufacturers are spending the time.

[21:11] They're not talking to us.

[21:13] They're not being transparent.

[21:15] They're not even saying what's going on.

[21:17] Months will go by with zero updates from Chicago Gaming Company, from Ryan White.

[21:23] Like what are they doing over there?

[21:25] Like how do you even have people who are in charge of sales and marketing if they go radio silent?

[21:32] I think it's really disrespectful to our time and to our peace of mind as a community and buyers when they don't communicate.

[21:41] Because for those people out there, this just starts to take over a lot of your mental waves.

[21:46] You're like, when am I getting my game?

[21:48] Like why do I have to be so in the dark and you go to bed every night and you're never sure when you're even going to get your new game?

[21:54] It's also like guys, when you think about it, it's like if you have to wait two years for a game, that's two years.

[22:00] You don't get to enjoy the product while they have your money locked up.

[22:05] Don't you want it now?

[22:06] Like I just don't understand this.

[22:08] Can you imagine like buying a TV you don't get for two years?

[22:11] But I think for a lot of you collectors out there, you've got so many damn games.

[22:15] You don't even need anymore, so it's easy to wait and I get it.

[22:18] And they're going to make the games.

[22:20] Alright, what is going on with the big dog, Stern Pinball?

[22:24] You know, I was just thinking about it today.

[22:26] I'm like, what in golden opportunity?

[22:28] It was for the boutique pinball industry to take advantage of the sleeping giant.

[22:33] I mean, Stern has been sleeping on New and Box games.

[22:36] They have been making old backorder titles.

[22:39] But during this period, this six month window in which no Stern New and Box machine has been released,

[22:47] no pinball company has capitalized on it.

[22:50] This was the biggest whiff for JJP because this was the ultimate opportunity for them to capitalize on this window in which Stern has nothing new.

[22:57] You know, right now, if you ask yourself, what is going to be the game of the year?

[23:02] What will be the game of the year in 2022?

[23:05] It's completely wide open.

[23:07] What a whiff by Pat Lawler, right?

[23:09] So Stern's been this sleeping giant, but the giant's about to wake up.

[23:13] And I think we're going to see their game by the end of this month, early next month.

[23:18] I think this game will be at Expo and I think it's going to be Venom.

[23:22] And you heard it here first, like, Canadian Pinball Podcast was the first podcast to tell you it was going to be Venom.

[23:27] As we wait for this game, what else is happening at Stern Pinball?

[23:30] Well, first, there's a cool new mod for Godzilla by T. Diddy.

[23:34] Diddy's Pinball Mods.

[23:36] It is a Nagel oil building mod for Godzilla.

[23:39] Super awesome.

[23:40] If you have a Godzilla, check it out.

[23:42] A lot of news around this elf pinball machine being banned from a tournament that a distributor was having last week.

[23:50] Let me give you the backstory real quick.

[23:52] A distributor is having a pinball tournament.

[23:55] They announced what games will be in the tournament.

[23:58] And this really fun, zany homebrew elf machine was one of the games in the tournament.

[24:04] Now, I like having homebrew games in tournaments because it shakes things up, right?

[24:08] It's like these players haven't played this game at all.

[24:11] They don't know the code at all.

[24:13] Like they don't know how to exploit this game at all.

[24:15] And Stern Pinball called over to this distributor and said,

[24:19] you need to remove this game from the tournament and also remove this game from all social media posts about the tournament.

[24:27] Now, why would Stern Pinball do this unless they were planning their own elf machine?

[24:33] You know, Stern's probably got somewhere around 20 licenses locked up for pinball at any given moment.

[24:41] Would elf make a good pinball machine?

[24:44] It's an amazing movie.

[24:46] Like it is one of the most popular holiday movies of all time.

[24:49] I think it would be a great theme for pinball.

[24:52] I don't think you're going to sell 5,000 of them, but if done right, I think this could be a really fun machine.

[24:59] I also think it's crazy that we don't have elf, but there's one Christmas movie that everybody wants, and that is Christmas Vacation.

[25:07] If they made Christmas Vacation, it would be an absolute take my money now game.

[25:11] I don't care.

[25:12] I think that film would translate into pinball in such an amazing way.

[25:15] I also think elf would translate into pinball in such an amazing way.

[25:19] Think about it.

[25:20] You know, you got a very easy to understand storyline.

[25:23] It's a feel good movie, both of them.

[25:25] And you've got all these iconic environments from each film that you could translate into pinball real estate on the play field.

[25:34] So for example, you could light the house up with all the lights.

[25:38] You could go sledding.

[25:39] You could go shopping.

[25:40] You could lock balls and Eddie's RV.

[25:42] And I'm not going to say the word, but crappers, full multi-ball.

[25:45] Like it's perfect.

[25:46] It's perfect.

[25:47] And then elf would be perfect.

[25:49] Absolutely be perfect.

[25:50] You could have the North Pole be these upper play field elements, and then you could have the New York City elements and the department store be all on the lower play field.

[25:58] I mean, both of these movies, like the modes just write themselves for pinball.

[26:04] Now, I was a little surprised on Naps Arcade.

[26:06] He put up a poll and he asked people, would you buy elf pinball?

[26:10] And 55% of people said no, I wouldn't buy it.

[26:13] And so like that's kind of surprising.

[26:15] But you know, if Keith Elwin made elf pinball, because that's just theme alone, like nobody's seen the game.

[26:22] And I get it.

[26:23] Like it's very seasonal.

[26:24] Are you going to want to play a Christmas movie pinball machine all year round?

[26:29] You play a Halloween pinball machine all year round.

[26:32] 

[26:32] What else is going on with Stern pinball?

[26:34] Here's another thing.

[26:35] I love it when I read like pinball media and I see stuff that I said months ago, you know, being presented as the news of the week and one of which is He-Man pinball.

[26:45] How many months ago did I tell you He-Man pinball is going to be made?

[26:49] Stern pinball is going to make it.

[26:51] And I think it's going to be Jack Danger's first title.

[26:54] So look out for that sometime in 2023.

[26:58] If they're going to make now the question becomes, when would they release He-Man?

[27:02] Now, if you think about Stern's order of designers, we had Keith Elwin's Godzilla, then we had John Borg's Rush.

[27:09] So who's up next?

[27:11] Brian Eddy with Venom.

[27:13] And then it's George Gomez is James Bond.

[27:16] I think Jack Danger's game is going to be after that.

[27:20] And I think it might be He-Man.

[27:22] And it would make sense to launch He-Man launch it in March for Toy Fair in New York City of 2023.

[27:31] That's just my guess.

[27:33] And then it makes total sense if Keith Elwin is making Jaws, release Jaws in the summertime.

[27:41] Okay, makes total sense.

[27:43] Oh, Canada doesn't know what he's talking about.

[27:45] What kind of marketer are you, Canada?

[27:47] Let's get through a few more then we'll be done.

[27:49] We're going a little long today.

[27:50] You guys are getting a treat.

[27:51] Spooky Pinball.

[27:52] There is a three part video series about the making of Rick and Morty.

[27:56] I will not watch it.

[27:58] Because I know that Rick and Morty is a reskin of a game that was meant to be total nuclear annihilation too.

[28:05] And unless they talk about that, they're not giving you the full story of the making of Rick and Morty Pinball.

[28:11] I also think Scooby-Doo is next.

[28:13] And I think Scooby-Doo is going to be the ultimate test of this new team over at Spooky.

[28:19] You know, for the most part, it was a swing and a miss with Halloween and Ultraman.

[28:23] Now this is going to be the game.

[28:25] Does Bug.

[28:26] Does Luke.

[28:27] Does the team over at Spooky Pinball, the current team on the field, are they going to be good enough to make a game that is going to wow you?

[28:39] I think after Ultraman and Halloween, this is going to be the ultimate test of Spooky Pinball.

[28:44] Because I do not think this community is going to throw non refundable deposits at this company ever again.

[28:51] There's no point in doing it because if you had just waited on these two titles that they just launched, you would have saved yourselves a few thousand dollars.

[29:00] So why would anyone go in early?

[29:02] Even if it is Scooby-Doo, it doesn't matter.

[29:05] Just wait.

[29:07] We need to end the non refundable deposit behavior.

[29:12] It needs to stop.

[29:13] These companies won't make masterpieces if we reward them before they've proven they deserve the reward.

[29:22] Okay, it's that simple.

[29:23] If you give them non refundable deposits, they can put out lackluster, mediocre, incomplete games like Halloween and Ultraman.

[29:32] They burn the community on it.

[29:34] And I'm encouraging everybody to just be patient and wait.

[29:38] Even if you get giddy about it on launch day.

[29:40] This is the thing.

[29:41] I think the best way to avoid all of the FOMO is when you know a new game is coming out, just take a week off of Pinside.

[29:49] Take a week off of this podcast.

[29:51] Don't go on Facebook and let all of the FOMO suckers get burned.

[29:56] And then you can march in a week later and pick up all of these games for less than MSRP.

[30:02] I mean, that's it.

[30:03] Unless it's Keith Elwin.

[30:04] Unless it's a crazy good stern machine.

[30:07] Everyone else's games have lost money.

[30:10] Every single one.

[30:12] Toy Story, Legends of Vahala, Ultraman, Halloween.

[30:16] Every single boutique game is going down in value.

[30:20] Cactus Canyon lost value.

[30:22] Nothing has gone up.

[30:23] And so just be patient.

[30:25] Also, these collectors, they take such good care of their games.

[30:30] You are basically getting like a new in-box game when you buy it used from someone who doesn't want it.

[30:37] Alright.

[30:38] Ready for the deal of the day, people?

[30:40] If you're a huge fan of total nuclear annihilation, the one-of-one Whitewood, which Scott Denisi brought around to shows years ago,

[30:49] you can have it for the bargain basement price of $14,000.

[30:55] It comes with no artwork.

[30:57] I'm not even sure the code is the same.

[30:59] So $14,000 to have the Whitewood of TNA.

[31:04] So if you're a TNA fanatic and you just have to have it and your life is not fulfilled unless you have the Whitewood of the game,

[31:12] you probably already have and you want to have two of the same machines in your house.

[31:18] Go ahead.

[31:19] Be my guest.

[31:20] Go on that pinside marketplace and show us how rich you really are.

[31:24] Alright.

[31:25] We got three more and then we're done.

[31:26] But the last one's going to be funny and short.

[31:28] Alright.

[31:29] Haggis Pinball.

[31:30] It's impossible to know how many games a week they're making.

[31:32] They won't tell us.

[31:33] Marty Robbins goes on his own podcast and says nothing about his own company's production.

[31:38] Just think about that for a minute.

[31:40] He says nothing about his own company's production and that's as much as we're ever going to get.

[31:44] All we're seeing is this.

[31:45] People are paying the air freight cost to get these games shipped to them via airplane, which is like $1,800.

[31:52] And these are still the series ticket holders, people, which means if you're not a series ticket holder,

[31:57] remember these are the people that gave 4,500 non-refundable on like the next four games.

[32:04] If you're behind them, they still haven't made a single one of your games.

[32:09] And they said they were going to make all these games by the end of the year.

[32:12] It's not happening.

[32:13] And that's that.

[32:14] Alright.

[32:15] Pinball Brothers bringing Queen Pinball.

[32:17] The Pinball Brothers are coming and bringing Queen Pinball with them to the tailgating party at CoinTicker.

[32:22] Wow.

[32:23] This is all of a sudden becoming the biggest Pinball event of the year is this tailgating party,

[32:27] which is great.

[32:28] I can drive to it and not even get on an airplane.

[32:31] But here's the thing about this game.

[32:33] I think they're stalling.

[32:34] I think they're stalling.

[32:36] Why have they not shown a single gameplay video?

[32:41] Think about it for a minute.

[32:43] They are taking non-refundable deposits.

[32:46] They are asking people to pay in full for the game if you want one of the early versions of the game.

[32:52] They won't show you the game.

[32:54] I don't like this behavior.

[32:56] I think it's disingenuous.

[32:58] I think they're hiding it back for a reason.

[33:01] Think about it.

[33:02] Why wouldn't they show you it if it was great?

[33:04] Why wouldn't they show you what they got if it was amazing?

[33:07] Why would they hold it back?

[33:09] So like, there it is.

[33:10] Alright.

[33:11] Multimorphic.

[33:12] The last one.

[33:13] This one's just funny.

[33:14] I mean, I want it to end with a real zinger.

[33:16] You know, you know what's funny about watching Jerry in Multimorphic?

[33:19] It's like, they're the greatest pinball company in their own heads.

[33:22] Like, they really are.

[33:23] Like, they think they've invented something that if just enough people experience it,

[33:28] it's going to create this tipping point in which we all see the value of the Multimorphic platform.

[33:35] Meanwhile, Stern Pinball has made more machines in one week than this company has made in 10 years.

[33:41] But it gets even more comical.

[33:42] Let me paraphrase what this hugely verbose email was from Jerry Steltenberg.

[33:47] It goes something like this.

[33:49] The P3 platform of your dreams developed 10 years ago is available to buy today.

[33:56] But we have nobody to make them.

[33:58] And even though the demand for our product has been non-existent for the last 10 years,

[34:02] if you compare us to anybody else in Pinball, we're raising prices tomorrow.

[34:07] So you better lock in your non-refundable order today.

[34:11] No global recession is coming to anyone who owns a Multimorphic P3 system.

[34:16] Okay, I added in that.

[34:17] No recession coming.

[34:18] But this is so crazy to me.

[34:20] Jerry, you don't have that much demand.

[34:24] And now you're raising prices on your platform.

[34:28] What you need to do, Jerry, is almost give your platform away to get your user base up.

[34:35] That's the only way it's going to make financial sense, Jerry,

[34:38] for anybody to actually develop good kits for your machine.

[34:43] That's the whole promise of this platform that people out in the Pinball world will develop for it.

[34:50] Like Jerry wants to make the Nintendo Entertainment System, and then developers make the games.

[34:56] Every single game that's been independently developed for the P3 is a joke.

[35:02] Jerry, you can't raise prices.

[35:04] What you should be doing, Jerry, is lowering your prices,

[35:08] as everyone is balking at the raising of prices by the other manufacturers.

[35:13] And ladies and gentlemen, this is why Canada Spinball Podcast is number one for five years in a row.

[35:19] And that's the ultimate news item that's a thorn in everybody else's side.

[35:22] Have a great day.

[35:23] We'll talk to you soon.

[35:38] To undyne this is the way that it takes it also take it all.

[35:51] So take it all.
