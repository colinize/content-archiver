[00:00] And I still can't get over the fathom video guys. I've been watching it more and more this week

[00:04] and I know some of you don't want me to talk about it, but I've never seen a more staged video in my life

[00:10] of a company trying to convince us that they have manufacturing figured out. Everything we saw in

[00:15] that video was staged, they clearly don't have manufacturing figured out and how easy would it have

[00:21] been for Marty and Damien to do a follow-up video this week in which they walk around the factory

[00:27] and show us how manufacturing is going on over at Haggis Pimbal. They're not going to show it

[00:33] because you all know deep down inside, not even deep down inside. You guys all know on the surface

[00:39] that what they showed us is fake. That is not a real manufacturing facility right now.

[00:45] And until they figure that out, you're going to be waiting so long to get your fathoms.
