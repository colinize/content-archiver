[00:00] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:17] Everybody, I tried to get Damien on the show.

[00:20] I offered him a chance to come on Canada's Pinball Podcast and he rejected the offer

[00:25] with one word.

[00:27] He said, Canada is unkind.

[00:30] He's not wrong.

[00:31] Canada has not been very kind to haggis pinball lately.

[00:35] I want to talk about that, whether I think it's more important to keep these companies

[00:40] honest, to keep them delivering what they promised the customers, or should I be kinder and should

[00:47] I cheerlead every single pinball manufacturer's efforts?

[00:51] Should I have more empathy for the companies, or should I stand up more for the consumers?

[00:57] I think you know where I'm going to go with this one.

[01:00] I've also played rush pinball.

[01:03] I went to Jack Bar.

[01:04] I played rush pinball.

[01:05] I played more Halloween.

[01:07] I played Legends of Valhalla and I played Guns N' Roses with weak flippers.

[01:12] We're going to talk about my thoughts on rush pinball, but let's get right to it.

[01:16] Let's get right to it.

[01:17] Let's start with rush.

[01:18] Let's end with my feelings about being called unkind.

[01:21] Rush pinball by Mr. John Borg, Stern pinball's latest machine.

[01:27] What did I think of it?

[01:28] Well, I'm going to say it right now.

[01:30] I think it shoots really good.

[01:33] It's a stern machine.

[01:35] It feels like a stern machine.

[01:37] It looks almost as good as other stern machines.

[01:40] It's a game where I feel like if you're a rush fan, you're really going to have a good

[01:44] time with this machine because it just oozes rush.

[01:48] There's nothing from the shot geometry layout that is actually blowing me away.

[01:53] It doesn't have as much flow as a game like Godzilla, but what is there is actually fun

[01:58] to shoot.

[01:59] I did find the game to be somewhat hard.

[02:02] You've got to learn these shots.

[02:04] The time machine isn't directly up the middle.

[02:07] It's a little off to the right and you've got the upper right flipper, which I do like

[02:11] the upper right flipper shot.

[02:13] It either goes up the ramp or it can go around in orbit.

[02:17] I thought that was very satisfying and I had a good time playing the machine.

[02:21] I was impressed by what's in the pro version of this game.

[02:24] I really don't think you get that much more with the premium and the LE.

[02:28] I don't.

[02:29] I think people who buy the pro of this game are going to have probably just as much fun

[02:34] as the people who buy the upgraded versions.

[02:37] I think that ramp that goes up into the time machine isn't really going to add anything

[02:42] to the game.

[02:43] I really don't.

[02:44] It was like a weird thing to put into the machine.

[02:47] I'm not the biggest fan of the three pop bumpers that are on the left side.

[02:51] When you go around the right orbit, you always end up sort of landing on those pops.

[02:55] Feels a little bit like Iron Maiden, but for the most part, what I liked about the game

[03:00] was the game sounded great.

[03:01] I mean, the music in this game was phenomenal.

[03:04] The screen and the LCD implementation of Rush up there was great.

[03:08] It does feel a little bit like they were trying to do what Guns N' Roses is doing.

[03:13] I almost wanted the screen to be bigger, right?

[03:15] Because I'm so used to seeing Guns N' Roses on the big 27 inch screen and it fills the

[03:21] entire screen with the band performance.

[03:24] This one, you know, it's like you want more.

[03:26] You just want more of it.

[03:27] You got all this great concert footage and it does feel a little bit small.

[03:31] There's a lot going on on the screen.

[03:33] Again, I didn't play this game that much, but for my first time playing Rush and not really

[03:38] knowing what to do in the game, I think the game plays fine.

[03:41] I think it plays fine.

[03:42] This is not going to be a stern machine that a year from now were mesmerized by anything

[03:47] in it.

[03:48] I think this is going to be a game that if you're a Rush fan, you will enjoy.

[03:52] But for everybody else, I don't think you're going to make room for this game if you're

[03:56] not a diehard Rush fan.

[03:58] And I think that's what they were going for.

[03:59] Like let's make the Rush fans happy.

[04:01] Let's put all the effort into the integration.

[04:04] But from a pinball standpoint, I just don't think this does something revolutionary, right,

[04:09] in the world of stern pinball.

[04:11] And if you've already got some stern machines you love, I don't think you're going to make

[04:15] room for Rush.

[04:16] The artwork is what it is.

[04:18] It's not great.

[04:19] When you stand over it, it is one of their more mediocre artwork packages.

[04:23] But again, when you're playing pinball, and I felt this way when I was playing it, you

[04:28] don't even notice the art when you're playing.

[04:30] You're so focused on the shots and what's going on in the game, you barely notice the

[04:36] art.

[04:37] Art is something that you appreciate when the game is standing still and it's turned

[04:40] off.

[04:41] When you are playing a game, it's all about the shot geometry and the gameplay.

[04:46] Now that being said, a game can have both.

[04:48] Like at these prices, games should have both.

[04:50] They should have stellar artwork and stellar gameplay and even stellar theme integration.

[04:56] So more to come on Rush, I hope to play the game more in the near future.

[04:59] Then I went over to Legends of Vahala, played some games of Legends of Vahala.

[05:03] Again, you know, it's an okay game.

[05:05] There's nothing in Legends of Vahala that blows me away, but it's fun.

[05:09] I mean, you know, again, I feel like Legends of Vahala is a $6,500 pin.

[05:14] I just can't see anywhere close to $8,700 for this machine.

[05:20] The other parts about Legends of Vahala that just annoyed me this time, the apron.

[05:24] They need to realize you can't read the apron card at all.

[05:29] And these details matter to me.

[05:30] So when they made this apron and they print it like gold lettering on a black apron and

[05:36] you can't read a single word of it when it's on location and you can't even really read

[05:41] it when you're in a bright room because I had the same issue at Expo.

[05:44] It's details like this that boggle me.

[05:47] If you're going to make a game and you're going to make a game and the rule set, which

[05:51] is important when you walk up to a game, the apron tells you on the rule card what to do

[05:58] in the game.

[05:59] So why would you make a game where you can't read what to do in the game?

[06:04] It's really embarrassing and they need to fix it.

[06:06] The other part I would change on Legends of Vahala, which again, I think it's just a tack

[06:10] on thing that doesn't really do anything and it actually detracts from gameplay.

[06:15] I never like it when you hide the pathway of the ball like arbitrarily.

[06:20] When you start to put too many plastics over the in lane so you can't really see how fast

[06:26] the ball is moving through the in lanes.

[06:28] Look at Legends of Vahala.

[06:30] For some unknown reason, they stuck these two plastic pieces over the in lane area and

[06:37] it's kind of wonky looking.

[06:39] I think one is like a werewolf and one is something else, but there's absolutely no

[06:44] need for it.

[06:45] It's almost like they tried to cover up this area with some art, but it doesn't need it.

[06:50] It actually blocks the pathway of the ball.

[06:53] And I just don't like stuff like that.

[06:55] I think this stuff looks tacked on.

[06:58] It looks pretty sloppy.

[06:59] For $8700, either sculpt something on top of the slingshot area, but don't just put

[07:05] flat plastics over it just to try to make it seem like there's more there because there's

[07:10] not.

[07:11] But Legends of Vahala is another game where when you play it, it's alright.

[07:15] I mean, but it's nothing special.

[07:17] I think we're at the point now where these alright games to me, they're fine to play

[07:21] on location, but I just don't understand why you would want to own this stuff.

[07:25] I mean, that's just my point of view.

[07:27] And then I went over and I played Halloween.

[07:29] I actually played Halloween more than anything else because I wanted to see, you know, I've

[07:33] been hard on this game.

[07:35] I've been sort of ragging on spooky that they need to get the code to a better place.

[07:39] I've been ragging on bug and Luke a little bit that they need to get better designers

[07:43] over at spooky pinball.

[07:45] And so I played Halloween.

[07:46] I played it a lot and I wanted to sort of see like, is this game getting unfairly sort

[07:51] of lambasted by the community?

[07:53] And I walked away from Halloween just feeling sort of the same way I did going into it.

[07:59] That it's a game that just lacks a lot of polish.

[08:02] The code needs so much work.

[08:04] Like you're playing a game and you can literally go like it seems like a few minutes where

[08:09] there's no call outs.

[08:10] Like there's nothing really pulling you through each of these modes and each of these journeys

[08:14] in the game.

[08:16] And it just feels like a little sterile.

[08:18] Like I guess maybe if you're in a dark basement and you've got the Halloween music cranked

[08:22] up, that's meant to creep you out.

[08:24] But for the most part as a player, when you go from a game like Godzilla, which I did,

[08:29] I went from Godzilla to Halloween.

[08:32] And there could be no more drastic example of one game that just comes to life with all

[08:38] this personality and you've got all these call outs and it's talking to you and you're

[08:42] in it.

[08:43] Like you're in the Godzilla world and it's so much fun.

[08:46] And then you go over to like Halloween and it's a little bit of a snooze fest.

[08:50] Like it just doesn't pull you in in the same way whatsoever.

[08:54] I know there's more code to come.

[08:56] And the other part is just the shot geometry in Halloween.

[08:59] Like there's nothing you're really going to be able to do to make the shot geometry better.

[09:04] And my takeaway this time was this.

[09:06] Most of the shots are right up the middle and those ramps are the easiest ramps to hit

[09:10] in the history of pinball.

[09:12] There's no real satisfaction in hitting those three shots on the left like the hedges.

[09:16] No satisfaction in that whatsoever.

[09:19] And then most of this is getting the ball to the upper playfields and it's fine.

[09:23] Like when you're up there it's OK.

[09:26] But nothing you're doing in those upper playfields is really that satisfying.

[09:31] You're just hitting like a drop target or a spinner.

[09:34] You know it just feels flat.

[09:35] I get that they put these upper playfields up there.

[09:38] But nothing about them like signifies like a new environment.

[09:42] Like you're in some new area of the Halloween universe.

[09:45] Look at the upper playfield in a game like the Big Lebowski.

[09:49] You're at the bowling alley and you're there trying to bash the car.

[09:52] Like there's a reason why they made that a separate section of the game.

[09:56] Look at the upper playfield in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[09:59] You're on the black pearl.

[10:01] Like there's a reason for getting up there.

[10:03] When I look at these spooky games it's just these flat upper playfields.

[10:07] There's no real feeling like you're entering into a new environment like a new area of the

[10:12] Halloween universe.

[10:13] And then they use like artwork that's just flatly put on those upper playfields maybe

[10:18] to signify where you got to.

[10:20] That's my thing.

[10:21] And this is where spooky needs to sort of grow up a little bit and graduate to understanding

[10:25] this.

[10:26] If you're going to physically add something to a different layer of a pinball machine,

[10:29] whether it's a lower playfield or an upper playfield, you need to make sure that that

[10:33] area makes sense.

[10:35] Like you're going underneath to go to grandpa's basement in the Munsters or the bowling alley

[10:40] in the Big Lebowski or hell in ACDC.

[10:43] But with these two games it all just seems pretty arbitrary.

[10:47] It's like they just made a design and then just slapped these themes over it and it doesn't

[10:52] work for me.

[10:53] It really doesn't work.

[10:54] And what's crazy to me is I think about these games were designed to be John Wick.

[10:59] And I still don't understand that.

[11:00] Like why would these upper playfields be the continental?

[11:04] I think that's what they said they were supposed to be.

[11:05] It's like going into the continental.

[11:07] But that makes no sense.

[11:08] If you were making a John Wick pinball machine and you wanted to give the player the feeling

[11:12] of going into the continental, then you would make the front of that continental

[11:17] hotel and like the doors would be like something that opens up and you go into the continental.

[11:23] The continental is like that iconic hotel front that's actually, I think it's a steakhouse

[11:28] in New York City.

[11:29] That is what you need to create.

[11:31] Not just make arbitrary upper playfields and just slap artwork on top of them and say,

[11:36] oh, now you're there.

[11:37] Because a pinball machine should teleport you to something you physically feel like you're

[11:41] going to.

[11:42] And I think Lebowski does it so well.

[11:44] Pirates of the Caribbean did it so well.

[11:47] Family Guy did it so well with the upper playfield as the miniature pinball machine like Stewie's

[11:51] pinball machine.

[11:52] But these games just don't do that.

[11:54] And so I walked away from Halloween feeling like not only is the code problematic, but

[12:00] the layout, it's just nothing really special.

[12:03] And I think that's going to be the primary takeaway from these games is just the design

[12:07] is not there.

[12:08] The code is not there.

[12:09] You know, overall, I just think these games aren't delivering what they need to deliver.

[12:13] And I'm not sure they could course correct these games.

[12:16] OK, and then I played Guns N' Roses at Jack Bar.

[12:19] And for some reason, just getting the flipper power to be strong enough just doesn't work

[12:24] on location.

[12:25] John said the coils get hot so quickly that if he cranks them up, you're only going to

[12:30] get a few games before they lose all of their power.

[12:33] I've said this before.

[12:35] Everyone has been saying this.

[12:36] Jersey Jack Pinball needs to have a meeting to figure out how to get their flippers to

[12:41] feel better.

[12:42] It might be a software issue.

[12:44] It might be a hardware issue.

[12:46] Whatever it is, these flippers just don't feel as good as stern or spooky machines.

[12:53] They don't.

[12:54] They don't sort of have that power.

[12:55] They don't have that snappiness.

[12:57] And it always comes back to haunt them when people talk about gameplay because I think

[13:02] people unfairly, they unfairly say like the designs at JJP are not good.

[13:07] The gameplay is not good.

[13:08] No, the number one problem with every Jersey Jack game is the way they feel.

[13:14] And I think they need to do some research and work in this area.

[13:17] If I walk into a conference room at Jersey Jack Pinball and I say, what are the problems

[13:21] we need to solve?

[13:23] What is the criticisms we're hearing?

[13:24] Well, there's the playfield quality issues.

[13:27] But the second thing you will hear over and over and over again is Jersey Jack machines

[13:32] just feel soft.

[13:34] The flippers feel weak.

[13:35] It almost feels like you're willing the ball up the playfield versus the flipper snapping

[13:40] the ball up the playfield.

[13:42] It's so much more fun to shoot a stern machine because of the flipper feel.

[13:48] And I think Jersey Jack can solve this problem.

[13:51] But again, it just always feels like a company that can never address these kinds of issues.

[13:57] It's like game after game after game.

[14:00] The feedback is always the same.

[14:03] Weak flippers and bad quality playfields.

[14:06] If they can nail those two things, if they can improve those two things, this company

[14:10] is going to get a lot more people excited about these games.

[14:14] And I don't know what the issue is.

[14:15] Like I don't make flippers.

[14:17] I don't make coils.

[14:18] I don't think we should have to be spending $11,000 and then installing like Pinmonks

[14:23] fans into the games.

[14:25] Like you should not have to do that.

[14:27] Like put like an intercooler or a radiator in a pinball machine.

[14:31] These companies should be figuring this stuff out in the factory.

[14:35] I mean, those fans are necessary.

[14:37] If you have a guns and roses, you need to buy the Pinmonks fan system.

[14:41] But why isn't Jersey Jack measuring the heat from the coils?

[14:45] Why aren't they doing this stuff?

[14:47] I don't want to have to add this stuff after the fact.

[14:50] Alright, so Haggis called me unkind.

[14:52] And Damien's not wrong.

[14:54] I have not been kind to Haggis Pinball.

[14:56] I have not been kind to Jersey Jack Pinball with their playfield issues.

[15:00] I have not been kind to Spooky Pinball with these latest two games.

[15:04] And I was thinking a lot about this.

[15:06] Like should I have been nicer?

[15:08] Should I have been softer?

[15:10] Should I have been more empathetic with what they're going through considering there's

[15:14] COVID, considering he's a family man, considering they're getting Celts out the doors.

[15:19] And everyone's telling me like the way they built Celts.

[15:22] Celts is built like a Rolls Royce.

[15:24] So I know that Haggis Pinball, when they screw a game together, it is going to be one of

[15:29] the best put together games.

[15:31] Does any of that erase the fact that they took money from customers and they gave customers

[15:38] a timeline that they didn't come anywhere close to reaching?

[15:42] And I look at it like this.

[15:43] I don't want to be friends with the Pinball manufacturers.

[15:46] I don't think it's necessary for me to be friends with the manufacturers because they

[15:50] have their own destiny in their hands.

[15:52] There is nothing I could say that would ever hurt a Pinball manufacturer's ability to sell

[15:59] their products if they make good games, if they get those games out on time, and if they

[16:06] don't screw over their customers.

[16:08] This show, since the very beginning, has always been, I believe, the number one Pinball podcast

[16:14] which has consumer advocacy as my mission.

[16:18] I am doing this show to look out for you, the customer, because nobody else was.

[16:23] When I started this podcast, everyone was saying Andrew Highway was going to get it done.

[16:28] Nobody was pre-ordering from Kevin Kulak.

[16:31] Nobody was like, well, wait a minute, maybe they're not going to be successful.

[16:34] Maybe these companies shouldn't be invested in.

[16:37] Maybe they should find their own investment capital and not take our pre-order dollars.

[16:42] So look, I still think, and I mean this when I say this, I still think people will get

[16:46] their fathom games.

[16:48] That's never been a worry of mine on whether or not Haggis Pinball will get people their

[16:52] fathoms.

[16:54] My point of view has always been this.

[16:56] I don't know how you go this many months and you have this many delays and you end up being

[17:02] able to make money off of the fathom project.

[17:06] Because what I've seen in the Pinball world over the years is that when companies do this

[17:11] and they have all these unforeseen delays, they end up burning through a lot more money

[17:16] they thought they would to get the game to market.

[17:19] And then you look at the common sensical thing.

[17:22] There is only one way for them to make up that lost revenue.

[17:26] So there's two ways to do it.

[17:27] You either cut your costs.

[17:30] You've got to cut your costs.

[17:31] You've got to get rid of some employees.

[17:33] You've got to cut your overhead.

[17:35] You've got to either cut there or you have to raise the price of the product.

[17:40] And this always becomes the issue.

[17:42] They took money on the games back in May and they said production would start in July.

[17:47] And they priced the games at a certain price.

[17:50] Now did they factor in a nine month delay into that price?

[17:55] And so for them to make money now or even make the same margins they planned on making,

[18:01] don't they either have to raise the price or lower their overhead?

[18:05] Now I'm not in manufacturing but it seems like you have to do one or two of those things.

[18:10] Am I not correct?

[18:11] And so here's where we're at.

[18:12] Like I think you're going to get your game.

[18:14] I think they're going to have a hard time making a profit on these games.

[18:18] But I don't feel like I've done anything wrong.

[18:22] And the reason why my show got a little bit more sharp elbowed in the last few weeks is

[18:26] that Damien promised people production would start in January.

[18:31] January came and went and he gave no update.

[18:34] And I'm sorry Damien.

[18:36] I know you're going to listen to this but I don't think that's how you should operate.

[18:40] Why did you say production in January and then give no update?

[18:45] That's not being unkind.

[18:47] I am simply holding you to your own words.

[18:50] I am simply holding you accountable for the very things you promised.

[18:53] I didn't promise those dates.

[18:55] I didn't say July.

[18:57] I know it's hard making pinball machines.

[18:59] I wouldn't go into pinball manufacturing.

[19:02] And I might have been unkind to you.

[19:04] But I'm not going to apologize.

[19:06] You don't owe me anything Damien.

[19:07] You owe me nothing.

[19:09] The only people you owe something to are your customers.

[19:12] And I do think you're going to get them their fathoms.

[19:15] But I also think you're probably looking at that balance sheet and realizing that there

[19:19] is now a big gap to overcome to make up for all those months where nothing was really

[19:24] on the line.

[19:25] And I'm going to end with this.

[19:26] My show has always been a reaction to people's behaviors.

[19:30] It has been.

[19:31] I reacted to the fact that they took orders.

[19:34] That they told people July.

[19:36] They then told people summer, end of year, January.

[19:40] I didn't say any of those things.

[19:42] I was simply witnessing what they were telling customers.

[19:46] And there was hardly anybody asking questions when January came and went.

[19:51] And then I did a show about it.

[19:52] And the thread started to blow up.

[19:54] And people started to ask questions about what's going on.

[19:58] And that's a good thing.

[20:00] We should not in this hobby just let these companies go radio silent after they've missed

[20:06] month after month of promised deadlines.

[20:09] For those of you who are customers, come on, wake up.

[20:12] Have a little bit of a backbone.

[20:14] Ask for a weekly update.

[20:15] I don't need a release date.

[20:17] Like I don't think he should give a release date.

[20:19] But every week he could at least update his customers.

[20:22] Oh, we're waiting on this.

[20:23] Or this just came in.

[20:25] Oh, we're working on this.

[20:26] Like you can't share any photos.

[20:28] You can't give us any update whatsoever on what's going on in the factory.

[20:33] Sorry.

[20:34] That's not how you would run a business.

[20:35] And I love how quick these companies go from being ultra transparent to nothing at all.

[20:41] That's not the way to do it.

[20:43] And he knows this.

[20:44] Damien knows this.

[20:45] He's been in this hobby long enough where he knows this.

[20:47] But I think he's feeling some of what Barry and Yop felt over at Dutch Pinball.

[20:53] Remember like you'd have your weekly updates and then you realize, holy crap, holy crap,

[20:57] sometimes a week will go by and nothing happens.

[21:00] Like there is no progress because when you're making pinball machines, a lot of times you're

[21:04] just waiting.

[21:05] You're like, you're waiting for vendors.

[21:07] You're waiting for parts.

[21:08] The whole machine is designed.

[21:10] The whole machine is finished.

[21:11] Now it's a waiting game.

[21:12] You've got to wait for stuff to come into the factory.

[21:15] You then have to hire people to put the games together and you might go three to four weeks

[21:19] where you know there's no significant updates.

[21:22] I need to wait for this part to be made and it's not going to be here for six to eight

[21:25] weeks.

[21:26] And oh my God, how can I tell people that?

[21:28] That I know that?

[21:29] Well, the first thing you can do is just never tell people production is going to begin in

[21:32] two months when you knew it was not going to.

[21:36] And I'm sorry, Damien, if I was unkind.

[21:38] But you know you shouldn't have said that.

[21:40] And that doesn't mean you're not a nice guy.

[21:42] It doesn't mean I don't want to hang out and have a beer with you, but I've got to keep

[21:46] these companies honest because if I don't, who's going to do it?

[21:49] But that's always been my role.

[21:51] I just want to keep these companies honest.

[21:53] If you say you're going to do something, then do it or explain to us why it didn't happen.

[21:58] And that's all it is.

[21:59] At the end of January, there should have been an update.

[22:02] There should have been some communication from the company and there wasn't.

[22:06] You know, Canada, the unkind has to have the unfortunate role of trying to keep these companies

[22:11] honest.

[22:12] And again, I don't care if you don't come on my show.

[22:14] Just get the customers, the games they pay for.

[22:16] And that's the only thing you owe.

[22:18] You don't owe me an explanation.

[22:20] All you do is owe those people games.

[22:22] And I do think you're going to get them their games.

[22:24] I still have a question mark about the long-term viability if you can go this long without

[22:28] getting machines on the line.

[22:30] And is it going to get better with the next game?

[22:31] Who knows?

[22:32] I look forward to seeing Fathom out in the wild and I'm sorry that I was unkind, but

[22:37] I'm not really that sorry because somebody has to keep these companies accountable.

[22:42] And I don't care if nobody will break bread with me because when I go to shows, believe

[22:46] me, the manufacturers don't want to talk to me.

[22:48] Like Eric Minier snubbed me.

[22:50] He walked right by me and he totally snubbed me.

[22:53] I mean, he said he did and but he did.

[22:55] And he didn't talk to me.

[22:56] You know, Stern doesn't want to talk to me.

[22:58] David Fix will talk to me.

[23:00] Jack Winari will talk to me.

[23:01] But there's a lot of people that just won't talk to me, but I don't care because guess

[23:04] what happens at the shows?

[23:06] I'm hanging out with all of you.

[23:08] You're the reason I do this show.

[23:11] You're the people who tune in every week.

[23:12] I don't care if they hate me.

[23:14] As long as I feel like I'm standing up for your rights in this community, I go to bed

[23:19] at night feeling just fine.

[23:21] Everybody, Canadian Spinball Podcast, we'll talk to you soon, later.
