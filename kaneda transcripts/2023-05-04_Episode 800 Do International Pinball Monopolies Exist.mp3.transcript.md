[00:30] the fourth be with you. Happy Cinco de Mayo tomorrow. I'm going to take the day off. Much

[00:35] needed day off. I'm going to put Killian in daycare and I'm going to go drink a bunch

[00:40] of Margaritas and hopefully Brenda does not listen to this so she can pick them up and

[00:44] I can just have my fun tomorrow.

[00:46] All right, so here's what we're going to talk about on this episode of Canadians Pinball

[00:49] Podcast. A couple things. I want to talk about spooky pinball answering the Canada Boutique

[00:56] Pinball Challenge. We saw the greatest walk around of spooky pinball. We saw Luke filming

[01:02] bug walk us around spooky pinball. I want to talk about why more boutique pinball companies

[01:08] need to do this. And for those who say canada does not do anything positive for pinball,

[01:13] look how amazing that video was. Look how great spooky pinball looked doing that video and look

[01:20] how good that video makes people feel about supporting spooky pinball. We're going to talk

[01:25] about that. We're going to talk a little bit about international pinball in this episode

[01:29] of Canadians Pinball Podcast and how Stern Pinball says, hey, there can only be one international

[01:35] distributor per region or per country. And what's happening in those places as these people want

[01:41] to buy pinball machines. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about this

[01:44] Toy Story topper, you know, a $12,000 machine gets a topper that looks pretty damn cheap.

[01:50] I don't know why Jersey Jack continues to do this stuff. And what other stuff do we want to

[01:54] talk about on this episode of Canadians Pinball Podcast? Well, let's start out by saying that

[01:58] Chicago Gaming Company might not be making any more remakes. Now we heard Butch Peelden in an

[02:03] interview and he pretty much said this that Chicago Gaming Company might not be doing more

[02:08] remakes. Now I think the reason why this would happen is not because they couldn't sell more

[02:13] remakes. There are a lot of classic Valley Williams games that they could remake and still

[02:19] make a lot of money. I think Planetary has moved on from CGC. I think we're going to see Planetary

[02:25] hook up with Pendretti Gaming. And I think we're going to see Pendretti maybe with Pinball Brothers

[02:30] start to release more of these remake games. The thing about Pinball is once you have a great

[02:36] pinball machine, it will always be great. None of the new stuff makes the old stuff really that

[02:43] obsolete. And when I say old stuff, I mean anything from the 90s, even though it has a DMD,

[02:49] we know those games were super awesome. Those games have a lot of toys and mechs. The only

[02:55] downside to some of those games is the code is very shallow. But you almost will never find a

[03:01] modern pinball machine that has more magical toys in it than the Valley Williams games. And so there

[03:06] are still a plethora of games from that period in time where if you remade them and put them new

[03:13] in box, you would sell a few thousand of each one easily, even though some of them already have

[03:19] like 10 or 15,000 of them that were made back in the day. It doesn't matter. Brand new, new in box

[03:27] like Indiana Jones, how do you think it would sell? Or brand new Twilight Zone, brand new Theater

[03:33] of Magic. I bet they would sell more Circus Voltaire's remade than they did of the original

[03:39] run of Circus Voltaire. If they ever remake Tales of the Arabian Knights and put new code in it,

[03:45] I will buy one right away. There are just so many great special games that people would want.

[03:50] So we will see what happens. I mean, I think remakes are also very interesting to see what

[03:55] they do in the pinball marketplace. If Toy Story is $12,000 in the new marketplace,

[04:01] what could you charge for Twilight Zone? What could you charge for Theater of Magic? Things

[04:05] that have a lot more in it. I think CGC has kind of been giving these games away. I mean, I really

[04:10] do. The modern pinball pricing, CGC's prices are not aligned with what collectors would spend on

[04:17] those fully featured games. You're like, Canada, shut up, stop telling them to charge more. All

[04:21] right, let's talk about the Canada Boutique Challenge and how proud I was to see Spooky Pinball just

[04:26] say, hey, look, Canada, they hashtagged me. They said, at Canada's Pinball Podcast, we are going

[04:31] to go live in 30 minutes from the Spooky Factory. And we saw a bug walk around that factory up and

[04:38] down the stairs all over the place, showing us how they make Scooby-Doo Pinball. There were some

[04:44] rooms he couldn't open up because there's secret stuff going on back there. But I think anyone

[04:49] who saw that video will walk away thinking to themselves, oh my gosh, making pinball is really

[04:55] damn hard. It takes a lot of dedicated, passionate people. It takes a lot of parts. It takes a lot

[05:02] of room. It takes a lot of money. It takes a lot. It is not easy. And also, when you look at Spooky

[05:08] Pinball, it does feel like they build their games their way. They don't have a traditional assembly

[05:14] line the way we see at Jersey Jack Pinball and Stern Pinball. That's why Spooky is still

[05:19] sort of like this really big boutique build. You could look at it and say, hey, it looks a little

[05:24] bit sloppy. This guy over there with his hat on backwards just working on coin doors and whatnot,

[05:30] they get it done. They make the games. They've made thousands of pinball machines. And I bet if they

[05:36] modernize their process a bit, they probably could get the quality to be even higher. And I have

[05:42] absolute faith in Spooky Pinball that they will continue to get better with each game. But that's

[05:47] not what I want to talk about. Here's what I want to talk about. When you sell a pinball machine,

[05:51] you need to manufacture that machine. So why would any pinball company that takes your money

[05:58] and asks for a nonrefundable deposit from you? Why would any pinball company who does that

[06:05] not open up the door to show you how they manufacture their machines? And the big challenge with the

[06:12] Canada Challenge, it's not some staged video. The big challenge is just going live, opening up the

[06:20] door on a random day in which games should be on the line because you took consumers money

[06:26] and show us what is happening. I think the two greatest ways to connect with your customers

[06:32] when you're a pinball company is through your product and your people. Nothing will ever be

[06:38] more impactful than those things. No marketing efforts, no song and dance, nothing. You sell them

[06:44] a product, make sure the product is great, and then sell them on the people. And if you do those two

[06:51] things well, you will win over people in the pinball community. You will start to develop a fan base

[06:57] and a following. And watching all those people make those games, I think it gives a lot more of us

[07:03] a lot of humility and humbleness on how we talk about these companies. Like, are you going to

[07:09] rag on a company when you feel like you know who the people are that put these things together?

[07:14] You know, you see a video like this, and now if your pinball machine has a little bit of an issue,

[07:19] you're not going to run to pinside and say, hey, this company and their quality sucks because now

[07:24] you know that it's really just human beings making these things. It's human beings earning a living

[07:31] in Benton, Wisconsin, putting together your Scooby-Doo machine. And it adds such a personal

[07:37] element to these games. And I think every single pinball company out there, I don't care if you're

[07:42] tiny like Haggis or big like Stern pinball, you should let the community in and you should

[07:49] celebrate not just the pinball, but also the people making the games. And so I am going to buy Spooky

[07:56] Pinball, a pizza lunch, the Canada's Pinball Podcast Pizza Party is coming to Spooky Pinball

[08:02] for doing what they did. Now I sent an email to Luke over there asking what's the best way to do

[08:07] this. So Luke, get back to me and let me know how many pizzas I need to order to make sure everybody

[08:13] there has a great lunch courtesy of Canada. So now the next question is this, who's going to take me

[08:19] up on the challenge next? And who do you think's afraid to do this? I think there are companies

[08:24] out there that will refuse to do this. I think Haggis pinball is afraid. I think multi-morphic

[08:30] is afraid. I think American pinball is afraid right now. I don't think anything's happening on the

[08:35] line over at AP or not much. I think CGC might be a little bit afraid. I don't think they want you

[08:40] to see how few people are there. I don't think they want you to see how little movement is maybe

[08:45] going on. But look, as you saw, the ball is in their court. They can decide when they want to go

[08:52] live. If they want to invite everybody in on a Thursday and say, hey, let's at least pretend for

[08:56] Canada and everybody else out there that we have some sort of manufacturing going on. And let's

[09:02] introduce Canada and the pinball community to the team over here. And I think that's the part that

[09:07] I love the most. I just want to know who's working at Haggis pinball. Why do we have to guess at this?

[09:13] Who's working over at multi-morphic? Who's working over at American pinball? Who's working over

[09:18] Chicago gaming company? Who's working over at Dutch pinball? It would be great to see it.

[09:24] All right, so we'll see. You know, the challenge is open-ended. They can do this any time. And I

[09:29] think people are realizing that stuff like this is important. Before you send any money over to a

[09:34] pinball company, you should have something like this so you feel good that you're going to get

[09:39] your game. And the other part of the challenge was this. How many games a week can you make?

[09:44] Why is that a secret? You should know how many games a week a pinball company can make. I mean,

[09:50] this is just basic, commonsensical stuff. So let's talk about what's going on in pinball. So Toy Story,

[09:55] it's got some new code update. It's not a real big code update. And now we've got these accessories

[10:00] for Toy Story 4. The ship has sailed on Toy Story 4. They're not going to sell more. Distros are now

[10:06] trying to unload Toy Story CEs for like $12,000 new in-box people. So if you want one, you can go

[10:15] get a new in-box Toy Story CE for like $3,000 off sticker. And now they're bringing out the topper

[10:20] for Toy Story LE. And much like the Guns N' Roses topper that came out for the LE, it's just flat

[10:28] plastic. I don't understand Jersey Jack. You want to make this premium pinball machine. You sell the

[10:34] most expensive pinball machine in the current marketplace. Other than like one-offs like James

[10:40] Bond 60th, your base level machine is now $12,000. Your CE is $15,000. If you're going to make an

[10:51] accessory to sit on top of a $12,000 product and then you want to make a crappy $200 flat plastic

[11:01] topper, how does this even get past the initial concept? Why isn't anybody over there saying,

[11:07] wait a minute, our brand is going to suffer if we make cheap accessories to put on top of expensive

[11:14] machines. Everything we do as a company should be top of the line, like everything. And so if you're

[11:20] over there, why aren't they looking at what Stern is doing on top of games like Elvira and Mandalorian

[11:26] and saying, hey, look, look at what Stern's bringing to market. Are we parallel with Stern when it

[11:30] comes to quality? Are we above them? Are we inferior or do we want to be superior when it comes to how

[11:37] people perceive our brand and our products and its accessories? And that's it. This stuff comes out.

[11:42] It looks really cheap. I think it makes JJP look really embarrassing. And I think they should make

[11:48] more of an effort. And that's my thing is Jersey Jack used to be the company that went above and

[11:53] beyond on the efforts it put into its machines. You know, their machines had more mechanically in

[11:58] them, had more code in them. But whenever it came to the toppers, this company has just always been

[12:04] mailing it in since day one. You know, only when Eric does his CE topper, is there any effort even

[12:11] being made? Go back and look at how crappy the toppers were for the Hobbit and for Wizard of Oz

[12:16] and for dial, then no effort whatsoever. And that's my thing. If you want to put a cherry on top

[12:22] of the most expensive Sunday and pinball, then put a nice cherry on top of that Sunday. All right,

[12:28] so I got a note from somebody. And this is a really interesting topic that we never talk about.

[12:33] And that is Stern's international sales policy. So apparently what happens is this,

[12:39] Stern picks one distributor in each market internationally. So let's take Australia,

[12:46] for example, if you want to buy a Stern machine, you have to buy it from one distributor in Australia.

[12:54] Not only that, they do not allow you to buy your game from a US distributor, even if you're willing

[13:01] to pay the air freight to get the game from the US to Australia, they will not let you do that.

[13:07] They also are making the games region specific. So that game won't even work in Australia if you

[13:14] do that. And this is making people feel like this creates a monopoly. And it does. It is the very

[13:21] definition of monopoly. And when you have a monopoly on the supply of games, the other thing

[13:27] happening is the distributors are setting the prices themselves. There's no ability for the

[13:33] market to set the price because there is no market. It's my way or the highway. It's one guy

[13:39] and his price, and that's what you got to pay to get the machine. And it's not just Stern machines.

[13:44] If that distributor can set the price for that market, let me give you an example that's going

[13:48] to make you cry. If you want to buy Pulp Fiction LE in the United States of America, it is basically

[13:55] $9,500. Everybody's going to buy it for that price if you buy it from a distributor selling it to you

[14:02] at MSRP. If you want to buy the same game in Australia, that game is $19,500. And that is

[14:10] because the one distributor, which is the only place you can get it, is setting the price at that.

[14:16] And the same is happening with Stern LEs. The same is happening with James Bond 60th. And when you

[14:21] only have one source to get the game, think about it. The distributor can then add on an additional

[14:27] three to $4,000 to its margins on the game simply because they know there's nowhere else you can

[14:36] go to get the machine. Now, look, this is a pain point for some of you out there who listen to

[14:40] Canadian Pinball Podcasts. And I've always watched these games and how much people spend on these

[14:46] games in Australia. And I've always wondered what all of you do for a living over there. This hobby

[14:52] to me would be so cost prohibitive. It would suck knowing that I'm buying a game for basically

[14:58] twice as much money as everybody else out in the world has to pay for the game. I mean, that would

[15:03] suck. Like how do you feel good at these prices? I know there's import tax in Europe. There's the

[15:08] VAT tax that goes on. But I still think there should be a way in which there can be more than

[15:14] one distributor per region. And that is just giving too much power to a singular distributor.

[15:20] How do you feel about this? Let me know at canadapinball.com. I would love to learn more about

[15:26] this. I fear if I try to go out and investigate this and talk to each of those distributors that

[15:31] has a monopoly, I don't think they're going to want to talk to me. I don't think they're going to

[15:34] want to come on the show. So I would love to know why this is happening and if there's a solution to

[15:39] it and what you think about this problem. Now, speaking of hearing what you think about stuff,

[15:44] I was super happy to see I got a lot. And I mean a good number of good suggestions from each and

[15:50] every one of you on different show topics we could do. And I think a lot of these are great. And I

[15:56] really want to incorporate them into the show. Let me read some of them to you right now. So

[16:00] Donald thinks I should find a way for paid subscribers to go on video live with me and

[16:06] show their game rooms. Don't do it on Facebook live because 99% of the people watching who come

[16:12] on to the show aren't even paid subscribers. That was really eye opening. We were going live one

[16:17] night. People were showing us they're like $300,000 in games and we're like, are you a canada

[16:22] subscriber? And they would say no. I'm going to look into like some content for Patreon only.

[16:27] Eric said I know it could be tricky, but I'd love more interviews. I agree, Eric. I'm going to try

[16:32] to get more interviews going. Good friend of the show, Derek. You know, Derek, he's the biggest

[16:37] JJP fanboy. He couldn't hold out. He just bought a brand new Godfather, Ellie. Derek, congrats on

[16:43] your game. But I said to Derek, I'd love to have you come on the show and let's talk about what

[16:49] your experience is like with the Godfather. Now look, he's the biggest JJP fanboy, but Derek will

[16:55] be honest with us. He will be. And I would love to get more personalities on the show. So I'm going

[17:00] to work on that. Kelly Daniel said more pinball rumors. Well, look guys, when I have a rumor,

[17:05] I'm going to tell you the rumor right now. There hasn't been a lot. Like we basically know what is

[17:10] coming out from Stern. We know that Venom is next. It's going to be Venom. We know they have Indiana

[17:16] Jones coming. They have Jaws coming. They probably have Back to the Future. It's all coming. Did you

[17:21] see by the way Jack Danger? He must be going through the catacombs of Stern Pinball. I think

[17:26] they're moving to their new facility and he's been sharing some of the craziest stuff he's finding

[17:32] in like the catacombs of Stern. Go look at it. There's like all these roll up play fields and

[17:37] design layouts of games they never made, one of which says King Kong on it and all the stuff must

[17:44] be incredible. And I think it's really fun that Jack is doing that because I'm sure he's going to get

[17:49] some inspiration from pinball designs that never saw the light of day. Can you imagine? It'd be so

[17:55] much fun to do a sleepover at Stern Pinball and just be able to walk around the place and see

[18:01] all the amazing stuff. I mean, I would love to spend a day in the design room or spend a day just

[18:07] going through all of George Gomez's files. It would be so much fun. Stern Pinball has been around for

[18:12] like over 30 years. Stefan said you could ask for our ideas and opinions more often. I think

[18:18] you'd quote and name the members on air and it would also attract your subscribers to participate

[18:24] more often. I agree with this. I'm going to start doing this more often. So Stefan, thank you for

[18:29] the great suggestion and I'm going to do more of that. You have my word. The only thing is this.

[18:34] I want to do stuff where when you comment it's not too long because that's the only thing I

[18:40] don't want to do is spend half my show reading stuff people write on my Patreon page. So keep it

[18:46] short and keep it sweet. Um, Stuart said if you know anyone in licensing, it would be interesting

[18:52] to interview them about getting an IP. I think that's a great idea, Stuart. I love what Victor

[18:57] said. You didn't get where you are by asking schlubs like us what to do. I don't want to think that

[19:03] hard anyway. Chad said could DLC actually benefit Pinball and how could it? Jerry said an operator's

[19:11] perspective is something he would find interesting. Eric Jackson said frequent back to the future

[19:16] updates. Eric, I wish I had any update for you on back to the future. Edwin said talk about Dream

[19:22] Mechs in pinball. What could be done? I like that topic. Brad said reliability of boutique games.

[19:29] Are they worth owning with all of the problems they're having? Felipe said I always like a classical

[19:35] discussion around dream themes. It's kind of too easy of a topic, but still from time to time. Yes,

[19:41] I will get that. I'm also going to do something called canada classics and I've done a lot of

[19:46] great podcasts in the past that some of you have not heard in which I talk about dream themes.

[19:52] I think I'm just going to re-air it. It'd just be more content on this channel. I think I'm just

[19:56] going to take everything down off of the free sound cloud page and just remove that so that this is

[20:02] the only place you can hear the content. Bond said a lot more in the vein of the often promised

[20:09] episode number 500. Now he's making fun of JJP here. Look, I don't think episode 500,

[20:16] you'd want to hear it because I think if you heard it, I think people might come after

[20:20] Canadian pinball podcast. You know me. I'm going to tell you almost everything you want to know.

[20:25] You're going to get the spirit of it all, but I still want to do this show and keep it more

[20:30] positive and that thing is just too much. Gregor says I always enjoy your marketing insights very

[20:36] much. It's maybe not a topic. As long as you find a way to let us be part of that world,

[20:40] I'm highly interested. Absolutely, Gregor. Steve News said do a roundup of all the manufacturers

[20:47] and choose a game you think they should make. I love this idea, Steve. I'm going to do this,

[20:52] not on this episode, but I think that's a great show topic. What should every pinball company

[20:58] make next based on who they are as a brand and the kinds of games they're capable of making?

[21:05] Bev said a show interviewing circus Maximus, find out what's going on with pinball circus

[21:11] and kingpin. Those guys are MIA. I mean, what a joke. They took money on those trans lights years

[21:17] ago. I don't think anyone knows where they are at. And then lastly, Curtis said it'd be great to

[21:23] talk about the new era of pinball and how a lot of people are being priced out of this hobby.

[21:28] More people are going to have to play on location and will high end pinball collectors be what drive

[21:34] the industry forward. Curtis, I think I touch on that a lot. I think we all know the answer to that

[21:39] question. As prices get more and more expensive for pinball and we don't see a ton of new innovation

[21:46] in pinball, I think more and more the rich collectors will drive where this industry goes.

[21:51] Unfortunately, the rich pinball collector does not really ask much of these companies. They don't

[21:58] demand a lot of magic. They don't demand amazing mechanisms. They don't demand like the code is

[22:03] finished. We have shown these pinball companies that a lot of people in this hobby have a lot more

[22:09] money than they do expectations. But I think that's what's going to change. Now that you're

[22:14] buying two games for $30,000 from Jersey Jack Pinball or two games for $25,000 for Stern,

[22:23] I think you're going to start asking for a lot more from these games. I think you're going to see

[22:27] people hit the brakes more if the games keep getting this expensive and there's not much in it that's

[22:33] unique. Why do you need another game? Why do you need a new game? If you've already got a bunch of

[22:38] games that are super fun, why are you going to write another check for this much money? Everybody

[22:44] have a great May the 4th be with you. Have so much fun on Cinco de Mayo and I'm still not sure if I

[22:50] will be going to Allentown this weekend. I've just got a lot of stuff I got to do with Killian and

[22:55] with Brenda and it's a long day away. It would be an hour and a half to get there and then walk

[23:01] the show floor. You can kind of see the whole show in like an hour and then it's a long drive back.

[23:06] So we'll see. I will keep you posted if I go. I think you'll know when you tune into my Saturday

[23:11] morning spectacular. If you see me in my bedroom, I'm not going to Allentown. If you see me at Allentown

[23:19] at 1030, I went to the show floor and I'm doing my show there. Everybody have a great, great week.

[23:24] We'll talk to you soon.
