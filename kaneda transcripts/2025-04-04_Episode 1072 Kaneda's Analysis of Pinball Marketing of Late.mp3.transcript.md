[00:00] You!

[00:05] You are still dangerous.

[00:11] You can be my wingman anytime.

[00:14] Bullshit.

[00:16] You can be mine.

[00:30] Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars.

[00:34] I'm coming in hot below the hard dick.

[00:36] It's Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[00:38] Welcome.

[00:39] Why is it that we are more excited about the April Fools themes

[00:45] than we are about the actual pinball themes we've been getting over the last three years?

[00:51] I want to talk about this because the thing is this, people,

[00:54] I know that Stern Pinball has a new CMO.

[00:57] I'm happy for them.

[00:58] I know Seth Davis wants to pick the right themes,

[01:02] but the reality is this.

[01:04] These pinball companies, for the most part, have not been listening to us, to what we want,

[01:12] and what happens when you treat your target audience like they are not the most important part of the marketing mix.

[01:21] We're at the top of the funnel, people.

[01:23] In the end, who's going to buy these games?

[01:27] It's not the dealers.

[01:29] It's not the distros.

[01:31] It's not the operators and the barcades.

[01:35] The majority of pinball machines need to sell to gentlemen like you and me.

[01:42] And when you go on Stern's website, do you see gentlemen like you and me represented as their lifestyle brand?

[01:53] Nope.

[01:54] You see the complete opposite of what the pinball buying demographic looks like.

[01:59] It's because this is what has happened in the world, and it's not just pinball.

[02:04] It's happened at Disney.

[02:06] It's happened at other places.

[02:08] You lose touch.

[02:10] You lose touch with your target audience, and you think the only way to grow your brand is to become attractive to a new audience that doesn't think about you,

[02:23] that doesn't care about you, and heck, wouldn't even spend any money on you.

[02:29] So that's how you're going to grow your audience.

[02:32] And that's what happens when you listen to people who don't know a thing about marketing.

[02:37] And look, there's a lot of really smart marketing people that are bad at their jobs.

[02:44] There's a lot of billion dollar companies that went down the wrong road in trying to attract new customers.

[02:53] And so when I look at the pinball landscape and I look at who we are, it's so easy to me.

[02:59] It's so easy to me to pick themes that people want in this demographic.

[03:06] And so why is it that we are getting so many things that this demographic is not excited about?

[03:14] And then you couple that with charging the most you've ever charged for this product and this industry in the history of the industry.

[03:24] You're going to charge this much money across the board and expect new people to come into the hobby in a world in which everybody is now nervous about what things are going to cost,

[03:38] nervous about keeping their jobs, nervous about customers going out and spending money.

[03:43] I mean, everybody's nervous.

[03:45] The damn manufacturers are nervous about tariffs.

[03:48] We're all nervous about should we be spending money on things we don't really need when everything is very shaky right now?

[03:55] Are you going to go out and travel the pinball shows now knowing that your finances are not going to be as strong as they were a year ago?

[04:03] Are you going to get that tax return?

[04:05] Are you going to be one of these crazy people that's not going to pay your taxes because you think the government's not going to be paying attention?

[04:11] Look, I'm just here to say right now, it is a new climate in pinball.

[04:17] Like never before and everybody needs to wake up to the new reality.

[04:24] The reality is this and yes, it is based on common sense.

[04:28] If you want to sell pinball machines for seven to fifteen thousand dollars, you need to release a game that is based on a theme that gentlemen ages like, I don't know now, like 40 or like 37

[04:46] to 60 find appealing.

[04:49] The primary buyer at this higher price point is going to be an older buyer.

[04:56] So first and foremost, if you're going to go down the road to make a pinball machine that this demographic wants, you need a theme that they want.

[05:07] Not a theme that you want to make a theme that they want.

[05:11] Anything that comes out now at these prices that does not achieve that step one of the marketing funnel, a theme they want is going to be dead on arrival.

[05:24] Okay, so let's get that out of the way and that is not hard.

[05:29] All you need to do is open up something called the Internet and look at the top musical acts, the top movies and the top TV shows starting in year.

[05:44] I don't know.

[05:45] Let's say 1978 to 1999.

[05:48] If you just make popular stuff in that timeframe, you are most likely going to land on a theme that people want.

[05:58] You know, it wasn't really popular then, John Wick.

[06:02] You know, it wasn't popular then, Avatar.

[06:05] Okay, so it is a real simple playbook and how can these companies be swinging and missing so damn hard when it's all right there?

[06:16] You also, if you only need to sell a thousand games and you're a boutique company, you can pick something in that timeframe that's not going to cost you

[06:27] in arm and a leg.

[06:29] Okay, there's a lot of movies out there, a lot of cult classics that will be successful.

[06:36] So pick a theme people want.

[06:38] Okay, it's not that hard.

[06:40] I just put up on my Facebook page.

[06:42] Would you rather have Dune Pinball or Tremors?

[06:46] Right?

[06:47] Tremors, the fun Kevin Bacon movie.

[06:49] So much fun that movie is.

[06:51] It's way more fun than a Dune Pinball machine theme.

[06:55] And guess what?

[06:56] Predominantly, most people want Tremors over Dune.

[07:01] Now look, I hope Barrels of Fun's next game is Tremors because I love that movie.

[07:06] It's most likely going to be Dune.

[07:09] And we saw their Shaker Motor, their teaser yesterday.

[07:13] Nobody cares if this company is making Dune.

[07:17] They are doing it all wrong.

[07:20] They are basically letting people for the last few weeks or couple months just mentally get over the theme.

[07:28] Nobody wants it and you got to make them want it.

[07:31] They're not doing anything.

[07:32] These teasers are not going to work.

[07:34] Trust me when I say this, David Van S is waiting too long and he's going to release this game on top of everything else.

[07:41] And it's just not going to work out.

[07:42] I'm going to get back to this.

[07:44] But I think all of these guys are missing what's happening in the Pinball buying demographic right now.

[07:50] And it's going to bite them in the buttocks.

[07:52] Okay, so you get a theme people want.

[07:54] All right, awesome.

[07:55] Yeah, okay.

[07:56] Then the other thing you need to do is read the room.

[07:59] COVID is over.

[08:01] This period we're in now where everything's going to be so expensive and we're supposed to just accept it.

[08:09] We're supposed to not just only accept the high prices.

[08:12] We're also supposed to accept how much money every single one of these games is going to lose.

[08:17] And we're supposed to just like, okay, cool.

[08:19] I'll just buy it, lose $4,000, $5,000.

[08:21] And then I'll just move on to the next machine.

[08:24] It's not going to happen anymore.

[08:26] It's not going to happen.

[08:27] I even see Loser Kid is now doing a market reality show, which is awesome.

[08:33] And it's also terrifying because when you see the numbers they're sharing,

[08:37] some of these LEs are losing like $6,000.

[08:42] And if you accessorize them even more.

[08:46] Okay, so now you've got all of these pins losing so much money.

[08:51] Now, even the positive pinball content creators can't avoid this anymore.

[08:56] So couple that with the fact that there are thousands of unsold games sitting new in box that are just inventory.

[09:06] That have nowhere to go.

[09:08] When those games go out into the world, what do you think that's going to do?

[09:12] Here's the other thing.

[09:13] It's like we need to limit the supply.

[09:16] There's too much.

[09:18] You get a theme people want.

[09:20] Don't make it forever.

[09:22] Don't make unlimited amounts of them forever.

[09:25] You need to protect some of the collectability in this small marketplace.

[09:31] It's a very small marketplace.

[09:33] And if you oversaturated on every single game, if you keep making Godzilla premiums for 15 years,

[09:42] if you make unlimited Harry Potter CEs, if you make so many guns and roses machines to the point where nobody wants one ever again.

[09:51] Sure, you could do that, but you have to also factor in the long-term impact of oversaturating your entire community

[10:01] and your market.

[10:03] So you're basically handing everybody a more significant loss than need be.

[10:09] And I see it everywhere.

[10:11] Here's the part that makes no sense to me.

[10:13] And I've just been thinking about this lately.

[10:15] It's like how is it that every single Stern LE, every single Jersey Jack CE is going to cost either 13 or $15,000

[10:27] regardless of who designed it, regardless of what's in it, regardless of the theme, regardless of the demand.

[10:37] So imagine if Porsche charged $200,000 for every single Porsche, regardless how much horsepower, regardless the design, regardless this and that.

[10:50] Guess what would happen?

[10:51] Nobody.

[10:52] Nobody would want every single model.

[10:54] Nobody would absorb every single model at that price.

[10:57] But you're telling me a John Wick is the same price as a Keith L. Wynne LE?

[11:02] A John Wick LE.

[11:04] You're telling me that a Dungeons & Dragons LE should be the same price as a Star Wars LE, as a Ghostbusters LE.

[11:12] And this is the problem.

[11:14] This hobby could operate when everything was $6,500 for an LE, right?

[11:19] When it was that cheap.

[11:21] Again, remember people, we used to spend $6,500 on LEs and I just won't accept the excuse, well everything's just more expensive these days.

[11:29] Sure, sure, but to a point.

[11:32] And we didn't just get to a point, we flew past what would have been the acceptable amount for any pinball machine.

[11:39] The most collectible pinball machine in the world.

[11:42] We used to joke that the hottest machine ever might be 10K by Christmas.

[11:47] And now you've got basically mass produced games for $15K by both Jersey Jack and Stern.

[11:55] Yes, because if you put everything into a Stern LE that's in a Jersey Jack CE, you're talking $15,000 and you're just going to make a thousand of them.

[12:07] And now you're going to make unlimited amounts of Harry Potter CEs.

[12:11] But gang, here's the real issue.

[12:13] These pinball companies all these years got away with it.

[12:18] They got away with it.

[12:20] They didn't ask us what we wanted.

[12:22] Have you ever taken a legitimate survey until recently from a pinball company asking you what you want to buy?

[12:31] What features would you like to see in a game?

[12:34] And don't forget this.

[12:36] The only time we ever got invited as pinball media into the doors of Stern Pinball and they didn't even invite me.

[12:44] The only time they opened the door to media is when John Wick sales were horrendous.

[12:51] Now you've got to think about that for a minute.

[12:53] You've got pinball people that are out there that love your product that have been spending six, some people seven figures on your product

[13:02] and you never invited a group of them into your company to give you feedback on how to give more of what you love to you, the customer.

[13:13] They never did that.

[13:15] They passed on back to the future internally.

[13:19] They didn't ask us, would you like back to the future?

[13:23] Because 99.9% of us would have said yes.

[13:27] So you got to just understand what a catastrophic mistake that was by Stern Pinball and what that move indicates to everybody, right?

[13:38] One single move sometimes is all you need to see to know the reality.

[13:45] That's how out of touch Stern became.

[13:49] When they became a lifestyle company, a lifestyle brand that was fixated on getting a new generation of people to buy Stern Pinball machines, they turned their back on all of us.

[14:04] They turned their back on back to the future.

[14:08] I love George Gomez, but when I interviewed him, he said something to me, the audience I want is not the audience I have.

[14:17] George, I can't believe he even uttered those words.

[14:22] That is the last thing you want to hear from the man we admire, from the company we love.

[14:28] Why would you want to hear from a company you buy unnecessary toys from?

[14:33] I mean it.

[14:34] Why would you want to hear the leadership say that the people they want to attract are not you?

[14:41] And we have all given years of our lives.

[14:45] Like we've all spent small fortunes on these products and that's how you feel about us.

[14:53] So when I go on to your website, I see a bunch of people wearing t-shirts that don't look anything like us.

[15:02] It's almost like they are ashamed of the very people that have kept that company in business.

[15:10] When was the last time Jersey Jack did a focus group about what you want?

[15:16] Jersey Jack has been making games just for him.

[15:19] Nobody would have greenlit Toy Story 4.

[15:22] Nobody.

[15:23] Nobody would have said make the godfather.

[15:26] Nobody would have picked Avatar.

[15:28] All of these decisions, all of these years, nobody is immune to the reality.

[15:35] These companies think they know what we want.

[15:39] David Vaness, I've been speaking to him.

[15:41] He's going to make the same mistakes.

[15:44] I'm saying it right now.

[15:45] He thinks he knows what you want.

[15:48] He doesn't know if it's Dune.

[15:51] That's it people.

[15:53] Another example of people with resources, with talent, with the ability to make a product, but they did the carnal sin.

[16:03] They didn't ask the pinball buying demographic.

[16:07] What would you like?

[16:08] Go secure a few licenses and then go do some focus group testing and then make the product.

[16:15] Look, it's not even hard people.

[16:17] It's not even hard.

[16:19] It really isn't.

[16:21] That's why yesterday when I saw all this stuff, I'm just like here we go again.

[16:26] I feel like the joke's kind of over.

[16:28] It's like the joke's on all these companies.

[16:30] If they think they're going to keep selling product and if they think the pinball buying demographic is going to keep going back for more and more,

[16:37] and just lose a fortune on every game, it only works if every single game they've got is Harry Potter or Star Wars or Ghostbusters or Back to the Future.

[16:48] King Kong, it's going to be 13.6.

[16:50] It's going to be more money.

[16:52] A lot of people are going to hesitate.

[16:54] I mean it.

[16:55] I don't know.

[16:56] Why do you want to go in right away when they're going to make so many of them?

[16:58] With Harry Potter, it's like, yeah, I can't wait to see it, but if they're going to make a few thousand CEs,

[17:05] I mean you almost have to have your head examined to buy it on day one because you're going to be able to go get it for so much less.

[17:13] Look, I love covering this hobby, but you see it happening, man.

[17:16] People are getting burnt out.

[17:18] They're getting burnt out by the barrage of games that are about to come out.

[17:22] They're getting burnt out by like losing so much money on the stuff they've had.

[17:27] And I think they're also just getting burnt out because they're starting to wake up to the reality that these companies haven't really cared to listen to you.

[17:36] They haven't.

[17:37] There was a time when maybe they didn't need to.

[17:40] They did not need to, right?

[17:41] Like eight years ago, they did not need to listen to you because they were coming out with better themes and the prices were so much better.

[17:49] It was fun.

[17:50] The collectability was there.

[17:51] Games were selling out day one.

[17:53] Nobody who bought anything lost anything.

[17:56] And now I'm turning on loser kid and some of these stern pros are now worth $4,000.

[18:02] And guess where those prices are going to go people?

[18:05] They're going to keep going south.

[18:07] And again, thousands and thousands of games, thousands and thousands of unsold games.

[18:13] Get ready for the $3,000 stern pro error.

[18:17] It's coming.

[18:18] And when you've got some of these games for three grand used.

[18:22] Are you going to start writing checks for 7,500 for a new stern pro?

[18:26] A pro that they're going to make thousands of or need to make thousands of.

[18:30] So in the end people, in the end, the same, the same sentiment that people feel towards Disney right now.

[18:39] The same sentiment that's sweeping across the world.

[18:44] If you have a product that has a niche audience, you double down on that niche audience.

[18:52] The way you get more people into your industry and into your product is you just make the best damn product you can that is appealing to that niche audience.

[19:05] That will pull in more people like them.

[19:09] If you want to future proof, pinball to a new generation, just keep making great games that appeal to your target audience.

[19:19] Cause don't forget, we are all just children inside.

[19:25] The things that human beings will be attracted to won't change.

[19:30] We were young kids when we got excited by games like Adam's Family and Twilight Zone.

[19:37] For some of you, you might have been in your 20s when you got excited by stern machines like Metallica and Tron and Ghostbusters and AC DC.

[19:48] It's like, if your game is amazing and it speaks to the target audience, you will attract more people.

[19:56] You will attract the next generation by doing it that way.

[20:01] But if you try to make a game for them that excludes your target audience, you are going to fail.

[20:08] A great industry to look at is the cruising industry.

[20:12] I used to work on Royal Caribbean.

[20:14] You know what they do? They just keep making better and better cruises.

[20:19] And the cruisers who love it, even the older cruisers, they love seeing what's next.

[20:25] How far can we take the cruising experience?

[20:29] Of course, they want to get new cruisers on board.

[20:33] And guess what happens when they target the core audience and just keep making the cruise experience better?

[20:40] That's what makes younger people now more attracted to cruising.

[20:45] But if Royal Caribbean was like, I'm going to make a cruise ship for Gen Z.

[20:50] This is going to be everything Gen Z wants on a cruise.

[20:54] Guess what would happen? They would not get on board and your target audience would not get on board.

[21:01] And you know what's interesting about pinball people?

[21:03] It's such a small industry that any mistakes get magnified larger than they should.

[21:10] Any mistakes can be much more destructive because it's hard to pivot.

[21:15] Remember, when Stern gets the themes wrong and they've got like four to five games in development

[21:21] and they don't have like four to five appealing themes to the target demographic,

[21:26] it's going to get rough. It's going to get real rough.

[21:30] Because then their only solution to get out of that quagmire is to rerun older titles

[21:36] and then you end up just burning all the old collectors that thought they had the last version of Metallica LE

[21:43] or Walking Dead LE or Ghostbusters or Tron.

[21:47] Like that's not a winning strategy either.

[21:50] So yes, Stern's got a new marketing guy. He's a CMO. I heard he's a great guy.

[21:54] He's got his work cut out for him.

[21:56] In the end, gang, I mean this. I mean, Gary probably needs to retire and they need to double down on their audience.

[22:04] They need to focus on who's actually going to buy these things.

[22:08] They need to listen to us more. All these companies do is not just Stern.

[22:12] It's spooky. It's barrels. It's everybody. It's absolutely everybody.

[22:18] And again, listening to the market feedback is not just about the theme.

[22:22] We're not paying these prices. We're not. We're not paying these prices forever.

[22:26] This is not going to last forever. If pinball pricing is now this and it's not going to change,

[22:31] this industry is going to decline by 40 to 50% over the next three years.

[22:36] The moment the SHIT hits the fan for people financially and it looks like we might be headed there,

[22:42] it's over. It's absolutely over. You all know it.

[22:45] You're not going to keep buying these things at these prices and losing this much money.

[22:49] There's not enough multimillionaires that don't care to float the amount of games these companies need to sell

[22:56] because most multimillionaires are not into this. They're just not.

[23:01] All right, everybody, and that's it. That's it. I think prices need to come down and I think themes need to get better.

[23:08] They got greedy. They priced everything as if it was still COVID and that's it.

[23:14] Any other pinball news? Tim Sexton, left stern. I knew that. He's now over at CGC Play Mechanics.

[23:22] He's probably going to do the code for Halo. It is what it is.

[23:26] John Wick owners, you know you're screwed. Dude, you guys were screwed long before Tim Sexton bailed on the code.

[23:32] You were screwed the moment you bought the game. Anybody who bought John Wick examined their heads

[23:40] because if you knew anything about pinball, you knew this title was going to tank just like Venom

[23:46] and you went in on it. What's wrong with you?

[23:49] Some of you are a gluttony for punishment. Everybody look. A new day is coming, man.

[23:55] The world is kind of crazy. Everyone's feeling anxious. Everyone's feeling stressed out.

[24:02] There's a lot of soul searching going on, I bet, in all of our heads. Like, where's the world going?

[24:07] What is this world we're leaving for our children? Nothing seems like the answer to me.

[24:12] I mean, really? When you look at these political parties, I feel like nothing is the answer. Nothing.

[24:18] Where is the optimism we had in 1986 when Top Gun came out?

[24:23] It was the same year that we got Guns N' Roses' appetite for destruction. We used to go to malls.

[24:29] We used to get excited about going to the movies. We used to get excited about the content in the world.

[24:35] The political parties weren't arguing like this. The Cold War was starting to come to an end.

[24:41] The MTV generation gave the world so much optimism. We were having a lot of fun.

[24:47] A lot of people were making money. The quality of life, though, for mostly everybody was good.

[24:52] And most of our parents, they were more successful than their parents.

[24:57] And it just felt like we were going to keep climbing. We were going to keep having good vibes.

[25:02] That's it, man. The world was filled with good vibes.

[25:06] And now 2025. Think about it, right? Think about it. Where are the good vibes?

[25:12] Where? Where? It's just hard. It's hard to find.

[25:15] You know, it's almost like you have to create your own bubble and live in it.

[25:19] You got to tune out the media. You got to tune out all the negativity.

[25:23] You got to tune out Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[25:26] And you got to just live in your own little bubble. But that's not what the world used to be.

[25:31] Mainstream culture was the good vibes. Mainstream media was the good vibes.

[25:37] Like when you plugged into stuff, everybody universally was having a good time for the most part.

[25:43] They were. I mean, at least in my world. You know, because, look, it was before the internet.

[25:47] I mean, maybe we just didn't have a place where everybody could complain.

[25:50] I mean, maybe that's the difference about today versus then. But it was better.

[25:54] It was just so much better. You could wake up and be in the present.

[25:58] Nobody was putting pinball machines in their homes unless you were rich-y rich, you know, or silver spoons, you know.

[26:04] We used to walk into the arcade and play a pinball machine.

[26:07] We didn't have to spend an entire paycheck to buy a pinball machine that was going to lose 40% of its value in six months.

[26:13] Nobody was doing that. The most expensive pinball machine in 1986 was probably $1,800.

[26:21] Now, if you adjust that for inflation, it's probably like $5,000 today.

[26:26] No, there was no like $10,000 machine, $8,000 collectors additions.

[26:31] We didn't even have CEs and LEs. I'm so happy when we were kids that the greedy marketers didn't exist yet.

[26:40] They just made one version of Optimus Prime. There wasn't like five versions of Optimus.

[26:47] We weren't driving people to collect every single little thing.

[26:52] Sure, some things had collectability around them, but for the most part, there was one version of Nintendo.

[26:58] You know, one of everything. There wasn't like all this variety to sort of make these people feel the FOMO.

[27:04] The only FOMO that used to be fun was like the hot Christmas gift that nobody could get.

[27:10] The Tickle-Me-Elmos of the world, the Nintendo systems that were sold out. That was fun.

[27:15] How do I get my hands on one of these? It was a lot of fun when there was no internet,

[27:19] and you actually had to like drive over to the toy stores and see if they got a new shipment in.

[27:25] Everybody look. Rest in peace, Val Kilmer.

[27:29] Unbelievable loss today. 65 years old. I mean it when I say it like his death.

[27:35] Like it shook me this morning because I was just like, these were the characters of my childhood that left such an indelible impression.

[27:44] These were the sort of male figures, and role models, and characters that we wanted to be.

[27:51] Right? And they became caricatures of our gender and what masculinity was.

[27:56] And I mean this when I say this. It's over now. I walk into work every day.

[28:00] I have to become the most emasculated version of me to survive.

[28:04] You can't even bro out with anybody anymore in these companies.

[28:08] Like everyone's nervous. Men can't be men. Women can't even be women.

[28:13] We've just created this world where you gotta walk on eggshells.

[28:17] And what I love about the 80s, it was unapologetically the caricature of like our genders.

[28:24] To the extreme degrees, right? To the extreme degrees. And guess what? Guess what the vibes were? People loved it.

[28:31] Go look at a music video. Right? Go look at a music video from the 1980s.

[28:37] Go look at, here we go again on my own. You've got his supermodel girlfriend, you know, on the car.

[28:43] Dancing seductively. Every little boy like fawning over that. Nowadays they would be like, they're over sexualizing her.

[28:51] You know, the Rolling Stones just have that beautiful model in their new music video and that was the feedback.

[28:56] Like, you know, how dare you exploit the female form. The world's broken people. It's broken.

[29:03] But what doesn't need to be broken are the themes we make Pimball Machines out of.

[29:08] The prices of Pimball Machines need to come down. And we need to level set.

[29:14] We need to level set. I want to go on Stern's website in four months and see a dude that looks like Neil McCrae in a t-shirt.

[29:22] Or they've lost the narrative. Everybody, peace out.

[30:03] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
