[00:00] Be George Jetson!

[00:06] Beasboy Alroy!

[00:16] Episode 81 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts. Happy Monday everyone.

[00:21] We have a nice interview today with Spencer Klingon, who's a fan and friend of the show.

[00:27] And as I said to you guys out there, if you want to join the podcast, just hit me up and we can have a nice talk about Pimball.

[00:35] It's what we all love to do.

[00:37] We obviously heard the Jetson's theme song. We're going to talk a lot about that Pimball machine on this interview.

[00:42] We're just going to talk about the hobby in general.

[00:45] Before I do, I want to say this. I've heard so many people complain about the Jetson saying it's over price, $6,000, $6,500, $7,000.

[00:53] Yes, I think that price ladder is idiotic. You know, it's such a drive to get people to buy the first 100.

[00:59] But I'll say this, when I step back, Spooky's making more Pimball machines.

[01:05] I wouldn't buy it, but I know people out there will buy it. So that's all I'm going to say about that.

[01:11] And without further delay, let's roll this fun interview with Spencer.

[01:16] And you guys can hear us talk about all the fun stuff that only 0.0000001% of this world even cares about.

[01:25] Let's roll the tape.

[01:27] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian's Pimball podcast.

[01:31] One of my listeners, Spencer Klingen.

[01:34] This just goes the show that if you're a fan of the show and you hit me up, you can come on.

[01:39] It's that simple. Spencer, welcome to Canadian's Pimball podcast.

[01:42] Yes, thank you for having me.

[01:44] So Spencer is coming to us from Sacramento, California.

[01:49] Spencer, what is the Pimball scene like out there these days?

[01:54] Better.

[01:56] I moved from Chico to open a new branch in the company I worked for four years ago.

[02:01] And at that time, there were a few pizza places and bars that had machines that were, you know, terribly maintained.

[02:08] We now have three really good locations with a really good set of games, you know, modern games of fact, one place I've been trying to get by there.

[02:19] A coin op. It's downtown.

[02:22] It's a barcade.

[02:23] And they just got a Batman 66 in it.

[02:25] I just haven't been able to make it down there.

[02:27] Play it.

[02:28] Yeah, I haven't, I haven't played it on location yet either.

[02:30] I'm sort of waiting for the code to come along.

[02:32] We'll talk about Batman in a little bit.

[02:34] Tell our listeners before we jump in to the news going on in the Pimball hobby.

[02:38] What collection do you have right now?

[02:40] What's in your home?

[02:41] Right now a Twister, an old Stern split second, and a Bride of Pimball.

[02:49] Okay.

[02:50] All right, so nothing pretty recent.

[02:53] Are you in the market for like new inbox stuff?

[02:56] Are you sort of just seeing where the market's going right now?

[02:58] Like what's your overall sort of, what would make you buy a new game or add something to that collection?

[03:03] You know, it's got, well, you know, I really want to start track.

[03:10] Stern Star Trek, I, you know, I talked I played today earlier on location.

[03:14] I took my boys out and went to the water park and just spent the afternoon at the arcade.

[03:18] And I mean, you know, wait, see what it comes up.

[03:21] I mean, there's so much, you know, it's a very exciting time for Pimball since, you know, not since the early 90s.

[03:26] Have we seen, you know, so many manufacturers so much going on, so much excitement.

[03:30] And the fact that, you know, again, three or four years ago, there was nothing in a city of over, you know, 400,000 people.

[03:37] And now there's three solid locations and a lot of, you know, even, you know, the local movie theater, there's one local movie theater that's got a walking dead, a star track, and a ghost busters right now.

[03:50] So are you looking at a star track?

[03:52] Are you looking at a pro, a premium and Ellie?

[03:55] Does it, does it matter?

[03:56] Is it any pro, you know, so.

[03:59] I think pros are coming back, right?

[04:01] When we look at where Pimball pricing is headed nowadays, I think everyone's looking at the pros, especially with the newer prices, everything going from like 8 grand plus, all of a sudden like an Aerosmith Pro at 5200 seems like a pretty good deal.

[04:16] What are your thoughts on pricing and where, where we're headed right now?

[04:21] I mean, I get, you know, manufacturing, especially manufacturing, the US cost money, parts cost money, labor, you know, working in the field I work in, you know, my, my parts or my materials are 20% of the job, the rest is all labor.

[04:39] So, I mean, I can kind of see, obviously like anybody else, hey, we'd like prices to stay lower, but I think it's just it is where is it.

[04:47] If, you know, when people say, well, I want more toys and cool gizmos, hey, so do why, but that's the cost money.

[04:53] Do you, are you, are you in or out with these new prices, though, like, would you ever drop like 8000 to 10,000 on a new inbox stern?

[05:03] Right now it's just not in the cars. I thought young children in the house. So it's just not in the cars for me, you know, I'm a, you know, I'm the guy that gets, you know, I find the game, you know, I'm Craigslist or through a local collector.

[05:14] The nice thing about what I do for a living is I'm all over the place all over Northern California and I meet at face to face with, you know, many people every day and I find a way to interject pinball.

[05:26] And like if I see somebody, you know, I'm in their home doing an estimate and I see that they've got golf clothes. Yeah, you play a lot of golf. Yeah, I play occasionally, you know, my baby hobby is pinball.

[05:35] And I always find a way to skirt that in because you never know who's going to have a game and a garage or a basement or a shed that they just don't want.

[05:43] Well, there's, you know, I talked to a lot of friends to who collect and I think, you know, there's on one side of the coin you've got people who are all about new inbox, but you can really get a lot of amazing games between you.

[05:55] And there's a lot of amazing games between two and $3,000 games that are fun games are proven. And there is this whole like underbelly scene where on Craigslist where people are buying and selling games all the time.

[06:08] You know, the stuff that never even hits like pinside, there's just deals happening every day.

[06:13] So are you are you actively hunting for a star truck right now? Are you sort of waiting for the right one to come at the right price?

[06:21] Just wait and buy in my time and wait to one pops up, you know, you know, buddy mine just got a kiss pro a few months ago for four grand, you know, it had some, you know, had a problem with the with the side decals, you know, peeling a bit came with brand new decals.

[06:37] You know, other than that, the game had, you know, very low plays and it's pretty pristine and it, you know, four grand. That's a good price point for that game.

[06:44] Right. And I think we're going to see prices on. Oh, we got a dog. No, it's all right. I mean, I'm I'm a new dog owner now with with Bubba. So it he barks whenever he needs to know I need to take him out. But how is Bubba doing by the way?

[07:01] He's he's awesome. You know, best 150 bucks I've ever spent. Of course, the first vet visit was like $250. So I'm like, there we go. But he's great. He'll living in New York City for those of you out there. If you live in a city and you need a dog walker in the middle of the day, it's like 20 to 30 bucks a day. But Bubba doesn't require because he's an older bulldog. So it allows me to save more money for pinball because Bubba is being considered by holding it in all day long.

[07:30] Yeah, our dogs a shelter dog. He's a we got him shelter. Oh, couple years back. He's a German short haired pointer. Really good family dog. Great with the kids. He's a good boy. There you go. Sweet.

[07:45] So the point of saying, you know, is I think a lot of stern pros and a lot of stern machines from a few years ago are really going to keep dipping down and becoming more and more affordable.

[07:58] I think some people are hesitant to say that LCD error is going to lower the prices of DMD games. But I really do believe that LCD will will make everything seem a little bit dated. So you're going to see prices on star tracks.

[08:14] So I think it's going to be a little bit more affordable. So that's good news, I think. Because I think that I think games just can't just do not get a holder value forever. They need to dip down a little bit to let the second hand market absorb them.

[08:31] I you know, I tend to agree. I mean, or you know, you can go back a little further down the road, say like avatar, which was one location for why I always enjoyed playing it.

[08:41] If I see one or this show, I'll play a couple games, but I think that you know games like that, you know, the call the beleasters. Somebody wants a good game, but they don't want to pay five six eight 10 gram. You know, they can have a lot of fun. It's got all the modern features.

[08:55] You know, it's got a ramp. It's got you know, it's got a cool little toy magnet. So they can still get that value for a little bit less money. Still have a fun game and just not have, you know, an a list. Right.

[09:06] Let's talk about since we're talking about pins and pricing. Let's talk about the news that happened today. It's always exciting when a new pinball gets revealed and spooky pinball showed us the Jetsons. And this has been a probably one of the worst kept secrets that they were making the Jetsons.

[09:23] But it's not spooky's third game. They were commissioned to make this game by the pinball company. And we got to see it today. And we also got to see the pricing structure, which is kind of interesting. It's 6,000 for the first 100, then 6,500 for the second 100.

[09:42] And then 7,000 for the last 100. They're going to make 300 in total. What what were your thoughts Spencer when you saw the Jetsons revealed today?

[09:52] Well, you know, like a lot of people that have been posted on pinside. The artworks great. And I think the artwork itself captures the essence of the classic cartoon.

[10:03] You know, it is a little sparse, but again, for the market is going to not, you know, guys like you and me who are hardcore who study up, who know the designers, who know all the trivia.

[10:14] Just somebody who, like when I encounter people every day in life and I talked to them about pinball, they're not can ball people per say, but almost universally what I get fed back is, oh, I love pinball. I used to play a lot when I was younger.

[10:27] Do they even still make them anymore? So those are people that you know, you know, we got this extra family room. We can put in a pool table or we can put it, you know, we'll get a cocktail video game. Oh, God, we have to get a pinball.

[10:38] I think and I think that's where the market's going since it's being commissioned by the pinball company. And if you look at the pricing structure, you know, game like they got it. I checked it out today.

[10:49] They've got a earth shake. It's like 45 hundred bucks. So somebody's paying money for these and they're paying that money because they don't know and they don't care. So like I got an earth shake in my house. It's cool.

[11:00] So my my first reaction, you know me, canada. I tend to err on the dramatic side. So I look at it and I'm like, oh my God, like this is the most sparse, empty play field I've ever seen. And it's 6,000 for this.

[11:16] Like how is this thing 800 dollars more than an arosmith pro. But I, you know, and my first gut reaction to you and I saw that pricing structure was like, wait, I've never seen anything like this before where the same machine is going to go up in value as we get closer to the end of the run. And again, it just looks like they're trying to get those first 100 machines sold. Right. It's kind of like an incentive to go in early. I get that. But what I did was this before doing like a podcast where I would normally just go off the handle and say how dumb this was.

[11:45] I emailed Charlie and I was like, Charlie, like what what's with this pricing? Like I kind of think it makes spooky look a little bad if people are seeing this machine for 6 grand and it doesn't seem like the values there. And he said, look, Chris, we don't this not our pricing. Like we're building this machine for the pinball company. And he said they know what they're doing. And there's a market for this for for, you know, for like a family friendly game at this price point. And at this.

[12:14] And at this level of simplicity with the game, right. So let's see how it does. I mean, at the end of the day, if they make these games in their inbox and the pinball company is the ones commissioning it, it sounds like there must be a demand for it.

[12:32] That's kind of what I was thinking. I didn't see the pricing structure told much later in the day. You know, so I wasn't aware of it at the time. That was just my initial impression. And I'm kind of with you on that. But you know, and then what I've already heard and then heard from you was, you know, that like we're just come, you know, we're just building the game where to set up the price or anything else. And I think the they key on a couple of factors or you just keep on is simplicity.

[12:55] I mean, a lot of the modern machines for the casual player. I you know, it scares you don't know what to do. You know, that's why South Park still does really well on location. There's a couple here in Sacramento, a location. And from the roundoffs I talked to, they said it goes up against the newer games like walking dead and star trek and even ghost busters that it does really well.

[13:18] And in most hardcore people myself included hate that game because it's just it's boring. Right.

[13:23] But for the casual player that's picking up a pizza and says, oh cool South Park, they throwing a buck or two, they get to kill Kenny, they make a ramp shot, they get multi ball. They feel that that enjoyment. They've had a good time.

[13:35] And that's probably what's missing a lot from modern pinball for the, you know, to get more people. I'm excited about it for no other reason. Look back 10 years ago, stern was barely cleaning the live and look at now.

[13:50] I mean, when when when companies are coming up and saying, we need you to build some games for us and we're going to sell them. And then if there's a few left over, you can sell them. That's a good thing.

[13:59] And maybe the price point is a little high, but again, the game or the pinball company, these guys obviously got to know what they're doing to do that. Right.

[14:09] Well, you know, we'll see. I do think it's priced a little bit high. The other thing I was scratching my head at, if this is for like the family, it's like the family theme to get these guys to put it in their game room, I don't know any kids today that are really watching the Jetsons.

[14:27] Like I grew up with the Jetsons, right. You probably grew up with the Jetsons. It's like if my dad was going to buy me a theme, he picked the Jetsons. But if I'm a father and I have young kids, I don't know if they're even into the Jetsons. So it's a little bit, you know, people have said it on the, on the form. It's more like Minecraft or heck even like Justin Bieber pinball would probably resonate with more young kids.

[14:51] So it's, I think this is, I think this, this theme appeals to the guys who have the money, but I'm not necessarily sure their kids are going to want Jetsons. Do you think the theme is going to talk to kids today?

[15:06] Now you have kids, right Spencer? How old are your kids?

[15:08] Why have four? I have two grown and I have my youngest is seven and the next one up is nine. So I think they've seen the Jetsons like ever is even on TV.

[15:20] You know, I don't know anymore, but you know what a couple weeks ago, one of them did put on the Jetsons movie and you know, like a Netflix or Hulu. And I'm like watching the Jetsons. I'm like, I rather watch this little show, but and somebody else I know, I saw me on Pinside, I brought a Johnny Quest.

[15:34] And I went for guys like, all right, Johnny Quest, freaking sweet. But you know, yeah, I don't, you bring, you bring up a great point are kids in like my kids age group because for them, you know, was it roadblocks or, you know, angry birds would much better resonate with them than say, but my, my seven year old or he's a video game, more video game.

[16:01] My nine year old, whenever we go to a show or anything, he gravitate, they go to gravitate to the game games. They love the old game games. And again, I think that goes back to the simplicity.

[16:13] Yeah.

[16:14] No, it's, it's a good point. And, and you know, it's sort of like what Jerry's trying to do with P3 and multi morphic when he showed the other games that he has with that system.

[16:24] They were all pretty much very simple games that were targeting kids. And it, I think it's a sound strategy because for all these guys, you do have children.

[16:35] There's nothing that's really accessible to young kids in the world of Pimball, unless you go back to sort of the, the EM and some of the more simple solid state error games. So we'll see how it does.

[16:48] I think the verdict is out. If they don't sell the first 100, we might be seeing them selling for a little bit more of a discount. So on the, on the other end of the spectrum, Spencer is, you know, we now live in a world where we have $15,000 Pimball machines.

[17:05] So when, what do you think of Batman 66? Do you think the values there or do you think Stern sort of understands that the collector will has deep pockets and they sort of went, went to see how deep they could, they could go with that machine.

[17:22] You know, I'm going to be as objective as I care. I love the theme. I absolutely love the theme. You know, it was a little kid. I remember me and Mike has been watching, you know, the old Batman show was syndication and run around the house with, you know, bath towels, Pimball on our shirts and playing Batman and Robin love the theme.

[17:40] Adam West to me will always be Batman. I haven't played the game yet. Even though there's one they just put locally on location. I keep me to get down there and play it.

[17:51] I'm looking at it. You know, and pictures and even video never do a game, just as to your staring in front of it. And if the gameplay is good, you know, I'd be interested. I'm really interested to play it.

[18:04] But I'm looking at you talking about the high end like the super aliased 15 K and I'm looking at the game and I'm looking what's there. I'm looking at the features and I'm seeing a pro.

[18:14] Right. Like we'll say we'll take the premium. I'm seeing a pro with the mechanical cool gizmos and the toys and everything else. I see a pro there.

[18:24] The helicopter is now the pro. Yeah. Well, and I was looking at it today too because I'm watching people on the forum sort of mod there's out. And that just pains me to begin with where you spend 15 grand.

[18:37] These guys have to like upgrade the bat copter to be a nicer toy. But for 15 grand that damn propeller better spin. You know, like yes. I was thinking about it too. I was like, because I love the theme too.

[18:51] I think that it is one of the coolest themes for pinball. But I kept thinking about 15 grand. I was like, you know, I was talking to Brenda my girlfriend about it. I was like, for that much money.

[19:01] The most iconic thing in that show is when him and Robin would climb up the side of the building, you know, with the rope and it was just really comical and campy.

[19:10] For that much money, they should have built a mech where batman and Robin like climb up the side of the back box. Like fit like there's like a physical mechanism that has them going from the bottom to the top.

[19:23] And you know, some shot makes them go up further and further but like I'm talking like a mechanical thing that's a toy that brings that theme of life. Instead they just recycled the dark night.

[19:35] And I know that that new mech is like rotates targets, but I just don't see the money there. I really don't. I'm going to ask Gomez when we get him on like if he would buy it, if he had if it was his own money.

[19:46] Oh, ask the tough questions. Wow. No, that's good though. You know, I've taken the calling it the bat rotisserie or the bat lazy Susan.

[19:55] I mean, because it was well, I brought black night brought it up and and that show a couple of weeks back. It's already been done. You know, there's nothing we haven't seen me for nothing to like let's go back to fun house.

[20:06] You know, Rudy's head holy moly. I mean, my God, there's a talking dummy head and it turns you that's freaking cool. You know, and then and there's so many other things, you know, go with many more madness and you get to blow up the castle.

[20:19] You know, I mean, you could go on and on great games, even more modern games. You know, I know a lot of people, one of their all time favorite max is the ship and pirates of the Caribbean. You could sink the ship. That's cool. Yeah.

[20:31] It's like, oh, it spins around. There's a backbone. There's a TV on there. That's kind of okay. I think it's for some targets. I think it's a great point. I think if you look at and I talked about this in my last podcast about who's the next J pop and the magic being kind of gone and modern pinball.

[20:47] There should be one thing just one singular thing that has that wow that you can explain and articulate to someone before they play the machine. So I used to tell people the Lord of the Rings.

[20:59] It's got the ring and the ball spends in mid air like it's floating there. It's the coolest thing ever because it has magnets going around that it's just hovering there. And when people see that, it's like they're blown away.

[21:12] And I just think with Batman, the most expensive stern pinball machine of all time, there's not one toy or mecker thing that really would blow people away.

[21:22] I agree. I agree. And again, 15 grand. Well, you know, because I also used to own or the rings and you bring up such a good point. My personal favorite thing on there. I mean, the ring is great was on the rare opportunity that I would get in the fellowship multi ball when I would get everybody across the bridge. You hit that ball rock one last time.

[21:40] Oh, yeah. And you hear and you hear gandalf the alpha top of his lungs. You shell my past. That just sends goose bumps up and down your arms. Man, you're like, I did that.

[21:50] Well, we can know and that that is pinball. Well, and I would say to like, I mean, ball rock is just so awesomely implemented into that game. The way he swings out in the scenes.

[22:02] You know, the modes when he's in that scene of the movie, he comes out and he's bashable. I mean, I just I want more bash toys in stern pinball machines. And whenever they implement them properly, there's it's just fun to bash stuff with a pinball.

[22:18] It is it is an old school good batch toys because I love X men, you know, group ring the comic love the fact that they did comic art. I just the Magneto toy. Okay, I kind of get that because it's got the magnet and that all makes sense.

[22:34] But what's up with the Wolverine toy and that that walking dead I like walking dead. Play quite a bit on location and I have a friend that has one just up the road.

[22:43] Right. But the well walker toy, it honestly reminds me. I know it's just me, but they both kind of remind me of like the squeaky dog to play.

[22:52] You get it in the middle of it. You know, it's like, come on, let's get like I'll go back to champion pub had a great bash toy.

[22:59] You know, you got the heavy bag and it spins around in your box of the guy. What a cool neck. What a great idea. Right.

[23:06] Now, why do you think that is like, why do you think we've sort of we've lost some of these elements that used to be so prevalent in games that back then would cost like two to three thousand dollars.

[23:18] These full featured games right with bash toys and multiple level play fields. And now we're spending eight to fifteen.

[23:27] And it just it still seems like like we're missing some of the very basic things that made pinball so much fun.

[23:36] I think some of the more basic aspects were coming back. I mean a few years ago, you never saw drop targets or even in the ballet Williams area hardly ever saw spinner.

[23:45] And you're seeing a lot more of those, which is nice because for the older guys like me, we love those. We love the modern stuff too.

[23:51] As far as why I don't know is it just development costs. I think it may be because we went from alpha numeric displays, which have to have programming to adopt matrix, which requires more programming to full video, which I'm sure requires more programming.

[24:08] So that's time and money. It's all labor. Right. Or not all labor, but a lot of labor and that stuff, you know, that might be it. That might be where a lot of, you know, we might be causing, you know, our own problems as a community say, well, we want more. Well, we'll give you this.

[24:23] We got to have video display. Well, we'll give you this, but it's going to cost more. You know, and they have to sacrifice price somewhere. I mean, obviously, you or I have all the answers, but that's kind of why we're here going over this figure out.

[24:34] Hey, man, listen, and I think especially stern. I think the other companies are kind of listening, you know, because they are giving us the themes we want and like that. Yeah, I'm looking at like 50, we talk about that, man, you know, the super early at 15 grand for another five grand, you could get a new or either really, really pristine or in some cases, maybe even a new in the box.

[24:55] Big bang bar. Right. Well, there's one on eBay right now for 25 grand new in box. The problem with that, you know, on some inebriated nights, sometimes I have delusions that I'll go buy something like that, because I don't have kids.

[25:15] You know, when you're still single at 40, you know, you kind of you don't have to put money elsewhere, but I did go ring shopping or looking for rings this weekend. So that that was fun watching big bang bars flash in front of my eyes in like a matter of seconds.

[25:33] But the problem with new in box anything like that is once you open the box that machines like worth like 16 grand so you literally are you're taking like a nine thousand dollar hit.

[25:44] Once you that's like a new car once drive it off a lot. Right. It's five by lot. But I think you could find you could find big bang bars with very low mileage less than two in a place probably for for 10,000 less, but it's it's going to be interesting.

[26:01] So like Spencer like let's talk about did you do you go in any shows like you go to expo do you go in a T. P. F. like are you do you also do like the different shows around the country.

[26:13] I have an year. I do show I do pinnigogo every year, which is our local show. It's you know it's 25 30 minutes down the road and Dixon. So it's literally halfway point between Sacramento and San Francisco.

[26:27] And I've been going every year for well this this year will be my eight year. Right. And it's if you ever get the chance to come out come out. I think you really enjoy the show because I haven't been a lot of other shows like a lot of my buddies have been to expo, been to T. P. F.

[26:44] who've been to the Northwest show. But they all say the same thing. In fact, I ran into one last year was talking with one fairly famous I'll go ahead and drop it was Tim Maumali. And she goes, you know, I love the show more than any other because it's always like a family reunion.

[27:02] It's it's just you know it's it's it's it's for charity. It's for a great cause. All the money goes to the local Boys and Girls Club. And last year they raised and gave 30,000 to the local Boys and Girls Club. And it's just all the pin. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. So all the local pinheads from all over California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho. I mean all and they bring again. We all bring our games and we set them up and you know people just have a good time sparking you up to your spot here.

[27:31] Sparky on the side he does the little video mods. You know, he always does a barbecue and it's just like a big pot left and we all come and hang out and have good food. And it just it's just like a it's it's just a wonderful thing. It's always weekend after Mother's Day every year. And it's and it's held in Dixon at the fairgrounds.

[27:52] It sounds awesome. Yeah, so there folks there you have it. Pinnigogo. You have to check it out. I think you know for most people who listen to this show, I would assume that you guys are die hard pinball people. You probably go to shows whenever you can.

[28:06] And I think this shows really are the most rewarding parts of the hobby for me. You know, I I'm not really a tournament player. I don't really go out on league night very often. But when I go to shows.

[28:18] There's just that great camaraderie where you're sitting around probably drinking a little bit like just it's like talk be able to being able to talk pinball with other pinball nerds for hours on end is so enjoyable.

[28:33] And and like you said, everyone has a good time. It's like the drama of the forums dissipates and everyone treats each other with with great respect. So I'm looking forward to going to T. P. F. this show. I keep telling Ed. I'm going to keep plug in T. P. F.

[28:45] Because I do think it's an amazing show. And I'm also hoping he gives me a little bit of a discount on my full page ad in the brochure if I keep doing that. So we'll see.

[28:55] But with 2017 Spencer, what what games coming out down the line are you most excited to see and play. We know there's like alien possibly magic girls star wars maybe dialed in.

[29:09] What what's on your radar that you just are clamoring to jump on.

[29:13] Right now that I know 100% for sure is coming dialed in, you know, like so many people when I first saw the reveal. I was kind of like what the hell. But it's Pat Lawler and I'm a huge Pat Lawler fan.

[29:26] World wins my all time favorite game. And I just love his games. I love the ingenuity of of you know all the max and all the ideas he's come up with.

[29:35] And you know despite the themes, like, but I get I get why you know why they're doing like the selfies and stuff because that's it's part of what's going on today.

[29:45] This just at every day part of people's lives and it's an interesting interaction. So that one's number one on my radar. I say probably number two would be the Star Wars pin.

[29:56] If it if I'm one of Star Wars flesh shirt as we speak, you know, I've been a fan since all the little kids since the first movie came out and I want to seem just to this one right.

[30:09] You know, because none of the others have really had elements like your idea you had in the last show with the death star with all the lights going out and you got to make that shot.

[30:18] Funny side note when I was at the arcade with my kids today on that two pins spider man and a certain star truck saw his playing most of those but I played the Star Wars pod game.

[30:28] And I made sure all my kids played it. That thing is awesome. I'm if you've seen it or played it. That thing is freaking sweet. And now my you know my son you all had to explain this to me.

[30:39] I'm like what is the ticket because you know he's like dad tickets we get stuff you know kids are my hate redemption games but I'm like well ticket because we'll play basketball. I'm like no let's play we got to play some ski ball.

[30:50] Because we promised mom is my wife's other than him on my wife's favorite thing to do will actually have date nights and after dinner will go play ski ball.

[30:58] So yeah so so we're playing ski ball my guys were the tickets like no dad why fight this shoots it to your card I'm like a really.

[31:07] I'm like yeah and that is my semi-year-old knows that you got that is right there on the on the game you have to read it so.

[31:14] So those kind of technologies you know you incorporate those in the pinball which be really great to get pinballs back into places like Chuck E. Cheese where you know if you get multi-ball you get 20 tickets or something so I think that's another avenue that you know that the manufacturers could explore and continue to get new blood

[31:32] I mean I'm 51 man we're not getting any younger here you know you're you're looking at 40 and and looking at just you know congratulations by the way looking to get married and probably start a family down the road and you know yeah I got I got to buy my pins now.

[31:47] Brenna was already showing me plans for the the kitchen renovation every time we see so every time I look towards like the adult things I need to do that's one less pinball machine I'll be buying in the future.

[32:00] But I think you bring up a great point about dialed in because I played dialed in at expo extensively and I thought the pin was phenomenal and I and I really I had so much fun playing it Brenda loved playing it and all the people who are complaining about it had never played it right it they they they revealed it very poorly at expo so the the people who are watching online they sort of developed an opinion of the game before ever playing it but what I'm when I'm happy to see now Spencer if you want to see it.

[32:29] Now Spencer if you read Pinside more and more people are starting to play it and the feedback is is phenomenal on the game I mean the game shoots amazingly well you be hard pressed to find a game that has a lot of toys has a lot of interaction with the ball has a lot of fun stuff going on it's the best use of the LCD that jacks have are done.

[32:50] It's not as it's not as complicated as was and the hobbit when you look up at that LCD I think the game is going to be great I still think the theme might be difficult for them to sell it but I I did the one thing is I never look at dialed in and say doesn't feel like it's worth eight or 9000 it it when it was next the Batman it looked like it was twice as expensive as Batman twice.

[33:14] Wow and that's how good the quality is and it was right next it was right near alien to an alien if you fully load an alien elite that's like nine grand dial then we'll give you that bang for the buck I just hope Jack ships it when he says he's going to ship it I'm already disappointed though that he revealed it remember he said he wasn't going to reveal it until it was ready to ship.

[33:35] And it was just like here it is now wait eight months so I I just hope when it does ship the code is really far along and because to your point to about technology I think the fact that you you can use your cell phone to flip is awesome and if you're playing for player pinball and if they let the other players actually get the ability to use their phones to disrupt your game is awesome like I just think it's bringing a new element to you.

[34:05] I think that could make this more enjoyable for even like a newer generation of pinball players.

[34:11] Agreed we were just talking about you know what are they going to bring new to the table that we haven't seen before and that's one of the things I love about Pat Waller I also love Steve Ricky games because I like that's why I like Star Trek because it's up it's adrenaline pumping it's this senior face when you get multi ball it's it's you know everything else no universe closes out and we're focused singularly on just keeping those balls in play and trying to get the ball.

[34:34] You know the jackpot shots and a good game does that it completes Lord of the Rings is a classic example of that you know you're trying to destroy the ringer gets it there and back again and and everything else closes out and it gives you that you know that that singular focus and that that adrenaline rush just like a roller coaster ride.

[34:54] I think now go on I just I think you know the point you brought up about you know be able to have four players plan it you know at a local bar pizza place friends hanging out play pinball having some beers and it's like oh I can mess up with Joe's game while I'm on my phone this is cool.

[35:11] Now it's great so I I really have high hopes for Star Wars 2 I actually have a Star Wars or possibly 2 on order the the games gonna sell out before it even is announced but I when I look when I think of Star Wars as a theme you know I talked about that dead star shop but I I just would love there to be you know an X-wing that's in the swamp and dig about right you have to lift it up and it's moving up you know I'm not going to do that.

[35:41] I mean there's almost too much that you can put on a Star Wars pinball machine because of all you know you we have three movies of source material to choose from but I know there's a I know there's some mechanism that has to do around like hyper drive and speeding the ball up I don't know too much about it but it sounds really cool I think we're going to see something along the lines of Daytona and was it fast lane and I might see my man.

[36:11] I'm making this stuff up right now I don't even know are you talking about like NASCAR yeah NASCAR yeah like where the ball goes in and like goes around the track faster and faster right I think there's we're going to see something like that on Star Wars.

[36:25] That could be cool you know as long as it's well you know like the last movies are really enjoyed we won't even talk about episodes once or three because it's just too painful.

[36:37] But yeah so I guess it is going to be an original trilogy which it's definitely it's definitely the original I know that for a fact.

[36:43] Yeah good good because I mean look that's what we all love you know the new mood the last two minutes played row one I absolutely love row one.

[36:50] Yeah it was but yeah the original trilogy is really the meat potatoes of that franchise and that's where it should be I just man I just hope they know at this time you know because the other games have been okay but not great.

[37:05] Yeah the things that make me a little anxious about Star Wars is is richy is very much a flow guy and I'm a little worried that it's going to be more ramps than there than there are toys and I think Star Wars needs a little bit needs a lot of toy toys in the game I'm also just curious what they do with the art because.

[37:25] You know Ghostbusters raised the bar so high for how beautiful Stern machine could look I think Aerosmith is absolutely incredible looking with with with dirty donnies artwork I just love the artwork on Aerosmith and I love the animations the few that I've seen yeah I love that 70s cartoon animation it just just the theme well.

[37:48] So that's that's just begs the question for me with Star Wars is you know is it going to be hand drawn art probably not I would assume and then how are they going to make it look amazing if it's Photoshop drag and drop stop and that's the thing that I'm just kind of anxious about because I there are amazing star wars artists out there I mean if you go on devian art and type Star Wars and I mean you could hand draw Star Wars and get a proof.

[38:18] I'm not just a little bit more powerful from from Disney and Lucas on that stuff but I just fear that Stern is going to use Photoshop on this one and I think it deserves better than that.

[38:29] I agree and I'm hoping that they've learned because it let's go back to AC DC phenomenal game great use to the theme great toy integration great rule set kick ass fun game.

[38:42] The artwork the art package the horror package is less than stellar if there's an Achilles heel of that game the our package is that and then you come along and you have Metallica which is the total package the gameplay the rule set the sounds the call outs the artwork is phenomenal everything about that game is just awesome there's no I don't know that that came actually has a weakness and I'm looking at Aerosmith and of course the pro model because the premium elite like if I were going to buy one it's going to be a pro.

[39:11] Because it just I don't see the extra value that upper playfield doesn't really really I don't but I have to play you know but the product cool yeah the art the arts incredible I mean I really think that Aerosmith I think it even gives Ghostbusters a run for its money with the art just because I think Donnie even has this is like his what second rodeo is turned so he gets he gets had to really make a playfield sing with art.

[39:40] I you know this yeah I mean I don't know who's doing the art for Star Wars it's going to be interesting I think what's going to happen to me they're obviously going to use probably movie clips from Star Wars and I think people are on the fence to you know with the LCD the the opportunity there is to do more animations or use actual clips I do like Aerosmith being animated and not just being clips from their music videos it's probably a licensing nightmare though right when you have an L.C.D.

[40:10] to get the rights for let's say music videos from a band because those rights are owned by different maybe production companies and record labels and you got to do much more than just get the rights from the band themselves so Star Wars is the big one when you think they're going to announce it you think it's I'm hoping it's May 4th on Star Wars day they announce it and it comes out in in summer you think it's going to be later in the year.

[40:37] I don't know you know I hadn't thought that much about it but you brought a national point is you know Star Wars is turning 40 this May so that would be the launch point I mean my mind that would be I mean they did it with that man they rush back man out to make the launch point you know for 50th anniversary so it just makes sense that they would probably launch it in May and that gives what it's almost February now so that gives them three more months you know they get Aerosmith on the line and then get everything geared up for Star Wars.

[41:07] Yeah I mean so there's I mean I hope it's May 4th just because I don't want to I'm so tired of waiting to see what it looks like there's rumors of Pulp Fiction coming out sometime in between who knows I also heard this rumor that and this comes from a really good source that they are going to do a rerun of AC DC.

[41:29] It'll sell I mean there's still people looking for them all the time hell I'd love that my dad that's his new favorite game my dad's seven going to be 73 in July and I've been playing pinball with him since I mean you know I'm five six years old standing on milk crates at the local 7 11 or boy alley.

[41:47] You know playing pinball and it's like he's like I'm saying well all the old games you love you know Superman's going to be the rumor we play that pair of guys like I'm so jacked so we get there and it's all good we said and this was like two three years ago so I've been taking my rear sense and and it's always yeah those are cool but let's go play AC DC let's go play Star Trek you know let's go play Metallica and my wonder I wonder if they're going to redo the art on it you know because they know that to your point that that's the biggest weakness and if they're going to redo it

[42:16] why not have you know zombie Eddie or Donnie just just draw some amazing new playfield for that game and and stick it in I mean they might not do it because it might piss off all of the people who have the other additions that already did they'll remember the Lucy edition yep and Lucy's the one to own I mean when you look at

[42:39] the reason value Lucy's are right up there with like the back and blacks exactly so you know that's just one more point Star Wars mirrored back glass in my mind the old hill to brand

[42:53] Star Wars poster from when the movie first came out that every kid had I had it you know that would be in a mirrored back glass that would look sweet.

[43:00] Look we all know Stern is not going to go back to mirrored back glasses they that's I know that drives black night crazy but it's true it's like they took out the thing that really was like the premium quality material for back glasses

[43:19] and they didn't even put it into their 15,000 on machine that look they didn't even give you PDI glass or in Visi glass on Batman SLE they didn't powder coat the coin or like they said they were going to do it so like I hope you're right though I hope they look at Star Wars as being such a

[43:35] sacred theme that it deserves the highest quality and if they want to make like a Star Wars SLE heck they could charge 20 grand for 50 Vater editions or boba set editions

[43:50] oh yeah people would pay this is Star Wars but the quality has to be there and but you know as I say that I'm like people would still pay they Stern could give you like

[44:02] they could give you a piece of saran wrap instead of glass and people would pay 20 grand for Star Wars but we'll see what happens I it's definitely going to be this year I know everything was delayed with the Ghostbusters playfully issued issues from last year

[44:18] what else though it's Spencer's anything else that have you played big Lebowski's or one by you in in California

[44:25] there's one in the Bay Area in fact a good friend's been talking about it I got to get down to the San Francisco area and there's a big Lebowski and a I think it's the same place too

[44:36] I got a look up on Pimble Mapper's Sassman buddy now I haven't played big Lebowski it and I really want to I have played

[44:45] Rob Zombie that's the one that's on location because the buddy mine just got his he was one of my hosts of our local league

[44:51] and I played it for the first time two weeks ago in league and wow you know and I don't people are talking about what's 50 you know everybody loves them and but they need to raise a bar all the all the criticisms you've given them have all been constructed you know and that's one things I'm like wow man can you know I'm sorry it's really kind of hitting the

[45:11] nail on the head here it's just we love you do everything right just up the game just a little but when you play I don't know if you play Rob Zombie

[45:19] I I've played it yeah I've played it I've played it about I would say 10 games on it I love it I love it it's it's I'd love another ramp we all would but I just I love the speed I love the call

[45:31] I'll definitely not definitely not a kid friendly game but I'm having a blast playing it you know there's always things

[45:37] that you'll make it a little better but I'm I'm liking it yeah look I my my criticism and it's not even like a criticism

[45:46] because I still think like for the money it's not that bad spooky knows they need to up the game and

[45:53] here's I like to always give spooky the benefit of the doubt for a few reason they they ship machines

[46:00] which in today's day to day just seems to be the hardest thing for people to do they never lie to

[46:06] people they never take people's money and leave them hanging they manage expectations the way a

[46:11] company should and they're always very responsive with their customers that being said I think that

[46:18] both spooky pins one and two fall short of being where Stern pros are at now that being said

[46:26] when I was talking to Charlie today about Jetsons he said I can't wait to show you what we're working

[46:32] out with number three and I feel like they really have listened to the feedback and they are going to

[46:38] up the bar with their next title and I think it's great I mean they're they're still growing they're

[46:43] still learning a lot about how to make pinball machines and they'll become more advanced they'll

[46:49] become more complex and they'll they'll get better they will get better so I just love the company

[46:56] I can't say that about every single company out there but I think they're doing it right so we'll

[47:01] see they're going to show game number three at tp app so I think that's going to be an exciting

[47:05] reveal that everyone is looking forward to yeah you know I actually for when he asked me about what

[47:11] I'm excited about oh is excited to see a new spooky game like you said I'm just I'm dying to see

[47:16] what they come up with you know what the theme is you know there's so many rumors that it's Elvira you

[47:21] know that if that's the case awesome if not it's something else it's going to be cool I thought

[47:25] of viral isn't a virus isn't isn't Dennis Nordman doing it and it's like the third the third

[47:32] series of that trilogy I think he's doing it with Stern I want to say I'm maybe I'm making

[47:39] this stuff up I'm no I think there is because why I remember because I was listening to the

[47:44] spooky podcast and I remember Charlie saying he would never do it unless both Dennis and the artist

[47:52] whose name escapes me right now weren't in on it since they did the first two right yeah great

[47:59] yeah yeah I think they're I think it's happening but I don't know if it's happening with spooky I think

[48:03] it maybe I don't know we'll see I'm gonna I'm gonna stop just rambling with my my speculation but

[48:10] it's gonna be I think it's gonna be an interesting year so do you think let's talk about a

[48:14] couple other games that I thought we'd see by the end of January which we haven't do you think

[48:21] magic girl ever comes out oh man I've been really critical to the point where I've actually heard

[48:26] some people still in and if I did do that I think I did I'm sorry uh that wasn't my intent I just

[48:31] I get so frustrated because I know a couple people personally that went in on that game and other

[48:36] games and they're good people man they're hardworking people that you know that you know they're just

[48:42] there's good people you know like almost all people and and to see all that crumble the way it

[48:48] did and see if just get taken for a ride to see it's still going on it was three four five years

[48:53] it's just it just infuriates me with that said I'm really hopeful and but even if it gets done

[48:59] how good it's gonna be and if somebody's dropped a 16k on that game and they get a box of parts

[49:05] and pretty lights where nothing shoots good and you know the you know the the the job trees no good

[49:10] and it's just it's just not a good playing game man I mean you know how disappointing is that to

[49:16] be the end result right I think um so I've heard I've heard rumbling so I think there is a really

[49:25] good shot it's going to come out I think that I think there's been enough work put into it over

[49:30] last year I do think the the question that you raises the one that everyone has is like will it be

[49:36] any good uh I've heard from John that he feels that he didn't have to compromise anything in the

[49:44] final game and he's happy with where it's at and he considers it to be his best game ever

[49:52] take it for what it's worth uh I don't you know what what is he gonna say right that I spend six

[49:57] years on this thing and it's you know it's it's a disaster's method it doesn't shoot well

[50:02] I think the code is gonna be a big issue on it who coded it what where's the code at like we'll

[50:08] we'll see any polish I doubt it I think what people are gonna get is what they're gonna get

[50:13] it still looks like it's one of the most beautiful pins ever uh but I hope we see it soon I think

[50:19] if we've been waiting long enough American pinball promise us this machine by end of the year

[50:24] and I know they're close I just I know a little bit more than I can even say on this matter

[50:30] but I just I just I think it's close I think we could actually see magic girl come out before we

[50:35] see alien ship which leads me to alien because I'm gonna make you talk about alien because this is

[50:39] what I do okay the pinball podcast uh what are your thoughts because I went into thread today and

[50:45] a lot of conversation about refunds and delays and where things are at what do you think's going on

[50:50] over there you think we're gonna see it soon I hope so you know I don't really know at this point

[50:55] because you know you've made a great point if you're not shipping games you're not making money

[51:00] and if you're not making money you can't stay in business very long that's just the reality of

[51:03] business I will say this about the first game I played it at pinnacle go this last year

[51:10] the theme um you know but theme is always secondary to me if I like a theme that makes the game

[51:15] even better it's the shots it's the play it's that adrenaline rush does it give it to me full

[51:20] throttles a fun game I enjoyed playing it I had a lot of fun for a wide body it's fast

[51:27] it has some great shots it has some cool modes you know I played three or four games on it but

[51:31] I'll think oh wow this this is really fun I have a good time playing this you know and again I'm

[51:35] lukewarm on the theme I hated I don't love it um alien love the alien movies love the theme I

[51:42] mean my wife and I go back and forth and quote each other on aliens and a million other 80s

[51:46] movies all the time constantly you know in fact we look at each other all times we're gonna get new

[51:51] material uh so I'm really excited about it you know and and I actually you know look are they

[51:57] doing something hasn't kind of been done before in pinball no but nobody else really is either

[52:02] you know it's uh you know the the the alien come out grab in the ball that's kind of cool um the

[52:08] the little face huggers jumping but it's it's the modes gonna be good you know is it is it smooth

[52:14] flowing is it fast giving it the adrenaline rush right and if it does that then that's a winner

[52:20] I'm just like like you and everybody else I'm like get the game game out nice come on yeah

[52:24] you gotta get this thing on the streets or you're done right I actually watched alien tonight with

[52:29] Brenda she hadn't never seen it so we have a whole list of movies that she hasn't seen stuff like

[52:34] good fellows and alien and bunch of movies so we started with alien and it's such a good movie it's

[52:42] such a good theme I mean I it reminded me why people are so excited to have an alien pinball machine

[52:48] in the world uh I still have my beliefs that the theme deserved more justice in areas of art

[52:57] but it is what it is I can't change that um it's also what I was watching the movie tonight

[53:01] and it's like the last half hour of the movie is also Gourney Weaver all of it and I'm like how do

[53:06] you kind of accomplish this without her in the machine especially like she is like

[53:13] she's the main character you know it's gonna be I'm curious to see how that all works but we're

[53:18] at the stage now where it is the eleventh hour and I I'm always gonna be skeptical of what's going

[53:26] on with with highway in this machine but I do want to see it come out I do want to see

[53:32] Andrew get the machine out there I do want to see people play it and I do want to see what all

[53:38] of the their hard work adds up to and and and that's it right I think I want to judge it as a machine

[53:43] when it's available for me to play I just thought I'd be playing it by February of 2017 so we'll see

[53:51] the next month yeah yeah critical though man if you don't see it next month

[53:54] man I don't know if they can survive another month of no no machine shipping because we all

[53:59] know something else is not happening full throttles are not still being made in going out like

[54:05] this factory is geared up for alien and they need to get that thing out because this isn't canada

[54:12] you know I can't I can't sink a company I can't make a company succeed but you I know one thing

[54:19] you need to ship product to make money and if money's not coming in it's your cash flows

[54:24] dried up it's you're not going to be in business very long doesn't matter how much people want a

[54:29] machine there's a reality of business that's taking place right now exactly and they're in the

[54:34] man like Gary Strens says you know we're in the manufacturing business if you're not shipping

[54:39] product collecting payment on said product well you got nothing man what you guys are hobby

[54:45] and in a big big warehouse full of parts right that's a scary thought you bring up

[54:49] Sigourin Weaver which you know again she's the focal point of the first movie especially

[54:53] towards the end and largely the second film and you know the come on there's the one call out

[54:59] that everybody was dying to have in that game and that's get away from her you bitch I mean come

[55:05] on we all want it it's just like billpact because we know that's got to be in the game game over man

[55:10] game over it's got to be you know that's you know that's got to be it that's because it's part of

[55:17] it's part of the as part of the franchise it's part of the theme it's it's part of the you know what

[55:24] it's part of the movie so great and you know you know and then you know new kit from space yeah

[55:30] I'm wondering if with the coding now if the way people have added with the with the pin sound

[55:38] boards and you can actually add in music and and sound clips that weren't there originally I'm

[55:43] wondering if you know if alien is successful I'm sure the community will work together to get like

[55:48] a Sigourin Weaver patch put into it where even though it's not legal legal it's not like the movie

[55:56] studios really gonna give a shit if people make a mod that puts her into it somehow or adds those

[56:02] call out so we'll see February I look February people it's the month of love it's the month where

[56:09] I think if you don't see like magic girl if you don't see alien I think we're gonna see both

[56:16] those machines in February and it's just gonna be exciting to have two new physical machines out

[56:22] in the wild for people to review an unbox I mean I'm hoping for that so yeah yeah no again you know

[56:30] we talked about libarski it's the thing I haven't had chance to play yet I love the movie I'm dying

[56:34] to play it but you know and I have a friend that did uh they got the 2.0 kit on his uh Brian

[56:40] Pima actually I know two local collectors who have done it that's nothing's freaking sweet you know

[56:44] they did a bang up job on it and if but I mean we're not seeing libarski's man you know

[56:50] well I don't even have problems but you gotta get him out the door you know I'm not gonna name names

[56:55] but I was riding I was hanging with someone at stern and they were just like you know what like

[57:03] good luck when you're contract manufacturing pinball machines they're not gonna because of that

[57:08] they're gonna struggle and and that was like a year ago I heard that and so it's it's a little like

[57:17] head scratching what's going on over there I mean I keep hearing from guys like rare hero like

[57:21] the games are built supposedly they're waiting on some boards I think then they have that whole

[57:28] thing about the shipping container needs to contain at least 50 games before it goes out I I hope

[57:35] they make it because honestly when I heard rumors like Dutch number two might be back to the future

[57:41] I get really excited because I think out of all the companies these guys really are creative

[57:48] and design mechs and and really create a world underclass they put a freaking bowling alley in a

[57:55] pinball machine it's the coolest lower playfield I think I've ever seen the the you were talking

[58:01] about at the other night the the on the ramp on the return on the on the habit rail where it looks

[58:07] like the return for a bowling ball that's genius that's simple and genius and wow back to the

[58:14] future I mean because let's like look look you know I grew up in the movies too they're great films

[58:19] um you know we want to end the in the back to the future game you know even though it's not that

[58:24] creating game the daddy used to want it's okay but it's not you know but to have a modern game

[58:28] with you know have have the delorean where it folds up and flies you know I mean to be able to have

[58:35] video modes and go back and forth through time I mean that's just yeah that you know the creative

[58:40] side of that can be limitless right totally well Spencer we're approaching our hour mark and as
