[00:00] Oh, Happy Saturday everybody. I'm Amped. I got some great scoops for everybody out there. We're gonna talk all about what's happening in Pinball, and trust me, you're really gonna want to listen to this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast. Oh, take it away.

[00:16] Welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast everybody. 620 club members can't be wrong. Okay, so I'm so excited to do this episode of the show because I'm just gonna tell you some truth bombs on this episode, and you're really gonna want to listen to the end, because what I'm gonna tell you at the end of this episode should help guide each and every one of you as you think about what your

[00:32] gonna get in the pinball world. Pinball Expo is right upon us. We now have Jersey Jack Pinball confirming their next game is gonna be revealed what October 19th or 18th at Pinball Expo. We've got the Mystery Pinball Company also revealing their game at Pinball Expo.

[00:48] We've got a new game from Pinball Adventures at Pinball Expo. We've got a new game from freaking the Pinball Brothers at Pinball Expo. So at a four day pinball show, we're gonna get four pinball machines revealed to the world. And the real question I have is why?

[01:08] Why do these companies keep making these bone headed moves? There is almost like no news ever in pinball, and then you're gonna crowd all of these pinball reveals during a tiny window like this. Why would you do it? And I have some news about the Jersey Jack game that's very interesting.

[01:24] So here's what I'm hearing. This is just off the rumor mail. So take it for what it's worth. But I'm hearing the following. Yes, we are going to see the new machine from Jersey Jack Pinball at Pinball Expo. They said the game is launching. What launches a rocket like cat?

[01:40] They've got purple glitter there on the freaking Facebook page and we know it's gonna be Elton John. It's not gonna be Prince and the fanfare around this theme is at an all time low. And so here's the thing that I'm hearing though. Even though they're not gonna be launching, they're gonna be launching.

[01:50] And so here's what I'm hearing though. Even though they're gonna reveal this game at Expo, my sources that are very close to this company are telling me the following. Elton John is not on the line.

[02:02] Jersey Jack is not making this game right now. This is not what they did with Guns N' Roses. It's not what they did with Toy Story. It's not what they did with the Godfather. Why are they doing it? And then the air is not making it.

[02:12] And so here's what I'm hearing though. Even though they're gonna reveal this game at Expo, my sources that are very close to this company are telling me the following. Elton John is not on the line. Jersey Jack is not making this game right now. This is not what they did with Guns N' Roses. It's not what they did with Toy Story. It's not what they did with the Godfather. Why are they doing it? And then the air is not making it.

[02:30] Why are they doing it? And then the answer is kinda simple. It feels like they're desperate not to get lost in the conversation. Or maybe they think they have a game so damn good that this game is gonna make people hold on to their money and not buy the other stuff in the pinball world.

[02:49] Now here's the thing I'm curious about now. Because they are unveiling this game at Pinball Expo and showing people this game for the first time. Well look, they didn't say they were showing people the entire game. I don't think they're gonna bring a working Elton John to Pinball Expo.

[03:05] And I think if Jersey Jack Pinball reveals this game in just powerpoint format and doesn't have the game there, I think they're gonna get laughed at. And I think they need to bring the game. But this is my fear. Because the game is not on the line, I think maybe they're still tooling up but they weren't ready for this.

[03:24] And I think the reason why they're coming to Expo is they know if they don't get this game out now. If they don't secure some interest in this game right now, everyone is gonna wait and just get Jaws Pinball by Stern. And they see all this money going to Stranger Things. And now they've got this freaking mystery pinball company coming as well. And a new game from Pinball Brothers. Jersey Jack Pinball is in full panic mode. And we all know why. They didn't sell the last two titles.

[03:52] And will this third strike put Jersey Jack Pinball in a terrible situation? And here's my thing about all of this. If you're Jersey Jack Pinball, why go to Pinball Expo to reveal this game?

[04:04] If you really want to win people over with this new title, why not do like a 20 minute straight down the middle video like they did with Pulp Fiction and just release that into the world?

[04:15] I mean, that's all they did to get all those orders of Pulp Fiction. The problem is Pulp Fiction is a theme everybody loves. And we've been seeing everybody just crap all over Elton John as a theme.

[04:27] I don't think you've heard this anywhere else. I don't think we're gonna see an Elton John playable game. I hope we do. I think we might just get maybe a launch video and maybe some high res images of what they're working on.

[04:40] But I really don't think we're gonna see like a bunch of Elton John games on the floor. I think what Jersey Jack wants to do is take credit for revealing two games in a calendar year.

[04:51] But I don't think you're gonna see an Elton John in people's game rooms anytime in 2023. This just all feels really rushed. And I think these pinball companies need to wise up.

[05:03] I mean, look how many games sold during COVID with no pinball shows. You've got all these months in a calendar year and you're telling me everybody's going to drop their games on top of TPF and on top of freaking what pinball Expo, which is a tiny show, by the way, for you people going to pinball Expo.

[05:21] It's a small show. It's like not nearly as big as TPF. There's not nearly that many games. You're gonna walk around that show in like an hour and have seen it all. And it is exciting though that we've got all these new games.

[05:35] But I think all of these companies are kind of in a marketing sense. They're all canceling themselves out because how long is a game going to really have a window of hype?

[05:45] You know, you're gonna go from seeing like pinball brothers remake and then the next day you're gonna get Labyrinth and then the next day you're gonna get Elton John and then the next day, well, I'm not even gonna talk about pinball adventures because nobody cares.

[05:56] The three ones that are gonna have all the attention are those three games. And I think it's a mistake. The other part is this, people. If you've seen the way a pinball machine is revealed to the world at a show, it's always terrible.

[06:09] It's always terrible. There's usually a panel discussion about how we made the game, a really bad PowerPoint presentation, and then they just pull the curtain off the game.

[06:19] And the first time the world sees your new machine is over the shoulder, cell phone footage of the game, and everyone's crowding around it and you can't hear the sound. You can't hear the callouts.

[06:31] Nobody who's playing the game knows what they're doing. How is that the way you introduce to the world something you've been working on for years?

[06:40] And we see it time and time again and we're about to see it again. And my prediction is this, because all of these companies are crowding around one moment in time, nobody is gonna come out on top.

[06:52] Nobody. I think all of these games are gonna cancel each other out. The only real game I'm excited to see is the mystery pinball machine. I'm not excited for Elton John. I don't have faith in this game.

[07:04] And the reason I don't, there's just something about Richie and Jack. I think they're stuck in the past a little bit. I don't think they really know what a modern pinball consumer wants.

[07:16] And I think Jersey Jack has lost its mojo and it's the same team on the field. Do you really think like Steve Richie's the guy that's gonna bring the spark to bring the passion back to this company?

[07:28] It just feels like they're going through the motions. It feels like Jack is just collecting a paycheck and he's just gonna say what he needs to say.

[07:37] So I think Elton John is gonna land with a little bit of a DOA status. I don't think it's gonna take off. And the other thing I was thinking about was this, is how can this game be on the line?

[07:47] And how are they gonna show it right now? What's gonna happen to all of those people that just bought the Godfather? What's gonna happen to them? They're gonna lose even more money.

[07:57] This is a company over the last couple of titles, like everyone who's jumped in and bought their products has seen the thing sink like a lead balloon. I just don't buy it. I just don't see Jersey Jack pinball getting two brand new games on the line in a single calendar year.

[08:14] I hope I'm wrong. I hope they can prove all of us wrong. But that is what Canada's Pinball podcast is hearing as of like a day or two ago, that Elton John is not on the line.

[08:25] And if it is not on the line, you are not gonna see a playable game at Expo unless they bring the one prototype game that might be at the factory.

[08:35] But I have a hard time believing they're going to do that, that they're gonna let like a bunch of random people beat on the one prototype game that's at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:44] So we shall see if I'm right or wrong. But again, everybody, I implore these pinball companies. I said I want to give my advice to them.

[08:51] They've got to learn to space out their marketing efforts. Dropping a game right after Stern does a rerun of a popular theme, not a good idea.

[09:01] Going to a pinball show to reveal your game, not necessary. It's not a terrible idea, but it's not necessary.

[09:09] Why not save all of that money and just do a video that makes people want to get the product? I mean, and you got to do the video right, right?

[09:18] Remember what happened with American Pinball? They gave the game to the wrong guy to make the video and he made a horrible video and that game has never recovered from that initial video.

[09:28] It has never recovered. I'm not saying there's anybody on God's earth that could have made a better video to help sell that game because I think that game is almost unmarketable,

[09:38] but they didn't do what they should have done. They had to work harder and make sure they nailed the marketing to get interest in Galactic Tank Force and they didn't.

[09:46] And that is why I keep coming back to this mystery pinball company. Here's why I'm excited about this company and it's the only game I'm really excited to see.

[09:54] Because I think you and I, each one of us, we really want to see a new pinball company come into pinball and do something new.

[10:02] I think every single one of us is itching to support a new pinball company. We don't feel good anymore about supporting Jersey Jack Pinball.

[10:11] They never finish the code updates. They don't really communicate to the community very well and they don't really seem to understand the themes we want.

[10:18] So they've lost us. They've lost us. But with this new pinball company comes a new opportunity to win us over.

[10:26] And people want to feel good about supporting a new company in pinball. I mean, that's how Spooky Pinball survived all these years.

[10:33] Off of the goodwill of the community. And this community has a lot of goodwill, but you have to earn it. And you have to show us you care and you have to make decisions that show us you know what we want as customers.

[10:45] And that's why Jersey Jack is now like in the pinball penalty box. Nobody cares anymore. And this is not the theme that's going to get them back.

[10:53] And they know that. And so now we've got the labyrinth. And I think they did a smart move.

[10:57] Like they were the second company to come out and say, hey, we're going to be at Expo. It wasn't Jersey Jack. It wasn't Pinball Adventures.

[11:04] It was first. Pinball Brothers said they were going to be at the show with a new game.

[11:07] And then you have this mystery pinball company that's been teasing this game forever. And they put their finish line as pinball Expo as to when they would reveal the game to the world.

[11:15] So I'm excited to see it. I think a lot of you are. Labyrinth isn't going to be for everybody, but they're not going to make thousands of them.

[11:22] I think they're going to announce a limited run of this game. I think the price has to be competitive. There's no way they're going to rock in there and say Labyrinth is $15,000.

[11:32] I don't even think it can be $12,000. I think this game needs to be priced like a stern premium closer to $10,000.

[11:39] And we'll see what they do with different tier models, but I'm excited about this company. I can't wait to see what they drop.

[11:45] But everybody else, stop launching games at shows. Stop letting the first example of your game be crappy over the shoulder cell phone footage.

[11:56] Stop not having high res images with all the pinball media that are out there. Yes, I just said it.

[12:02] You'd think these companies would actually work a little bit with the pinball content creators so each of us could have something ready to go.

[12:09] I don't have anything. Maybe I'm expecting something in my inbox in my email closer to Expo.

[12:14] Obviously they don't trust any of us and for the right reasons because most of us would probably share it with our friends and then it would leak and then we would ruin all of their plans.

[12:25] So actually it is a smart move not to give any of us any assets beforehand.

[12:29] So look, that's my point of view on all of these companies launching around the same time. I think all of them are nervous.

[12:37] I think all of them know that Keith Elwyn is waiting at the gates and seeing Keith Elwyn's jaws at the gates of pinball has them all terrified.

[12:47] They know they only have like a three month window at most to get their game out and get their games ordered because that's the thing.

[12:55] They need orders with non-refundable deposits because here's what's going to happen.

[12:59] Imagine if these companies take all these orders and your deposits are refundable the way they used to be.

[13:06] What would happen? You're going to see jaws and you'd cancel your order.

[13:10] So I really do implore each and every one of you.

[13:13] Be careful. Don't run at any of this stuff. I mean it.

[13:17] And here's the part of my show that I've been waiting to tell you.

[13:20] Canada knows stuff now that nobody else knows and I can't tell you right now.

[13:26] But I will speak about this in a little bit of a roundabout way.

[13:30] You all are excited for Back to the Future.

[13:33] All I'm going to tell you is what I told you on my last rumor of that title.

[13:37] There is a very good chance Back to the Future is coming out and you are going to see it.

[13:42] In fact, I'm so certain it's coming out that if Back to the Future does not become a pinball machine,

[13:47] I will cancel my show. That's how confident I am that Back to the Future will be a machine.

[13:53] And so if you think about it, what game coming out do you want more than Back to the Future?

[13:58] Is there anything? Is it Jaws? Is it John Wick? Is it He-Man Masters of the Universe?

[14:03] I don't think there's any game out there that would have more interest than Back to the Future for 99% of you.

[14:10] So why wouldn't you just wait? And it's not happening from stern pinball. I told you that.

[14:14] It's not going to happen from stern pinball. That's what my rumor was.

[14:18] And so knowing that this thing is going to materialize one day and knowing that that Back to the Future thread is blowing up again,

[14:25] I just want each and every one of you to know it's a good time to wait and see.

[14:30] And that's not all that's coming in pinball.

[14:32] There are things happening next year that have me so excited.

[14:36] The only way you would get it from me is if you tortured me right now, but I'm telling you right now, I've ordered two games.

[14:44] Two games, you don't know what they are. And I don't plan to buy anything else in 2024 other than these two games.

[14:51] And I think these two games are going to blow people away. I think they're going to be unexpected by a lot of you.

[14:56] And I think for those of you who are patient and those of you who listen to Canada and those of you who don't fall for the FOMO

[15:04] by all the other content creators that are distributors that are giving kickbacks to the other content creators,

[15:10] that's the way the game's been over the last few years.

[15:13] If you don't fall victim to that, if you don't wake up every day and say,

[15:17] my job is to remove the inventory from my distributor friends so they don't find themselves in a pickle.

[15:23] Well, guess what? They're in a pickle. They all have a lot of inventory and it's going to keep stacking up.

[15:29] And I'm telling you right now, you might as well let this year's inventory stack up

[15:34] because you're going to be able to get all of it for so much less money because if you knew what I know,

[15:40] there's so much more that's going to be in demand than the current roster of games that we know about,

[15:46] that we're going to see at Pinball Expo.

[15:48] And I don't know about you, but this makes going into 2024 so exciting.

[15:52] And look, Keith Elwin's jaws is going to be bonkers. It's going to be bonkers.

[15:55] It's Elwin. He knows what it's doing.

[15:57] I think that is going to start us off into what we need.

[16:01] And that is a pinball year that is going to deliver more magic than the last few years combined.

[16:08] It's a pinball year where either you've got something people want or you're absolutely going to be dead on arrival.

[16:14] And I really do mean it when I say it.

[16:16] And who's willing to take the Canada Challenge?

[16:19] Who's willing to wait until next year to see what I know,

[16:24] to see what I'm talking about.

[16:26] And trust me, you're not going to be like,

[16:28] man, you led me astray. I should have gone in on this game.

[16:31] I'm telling you right now, the game you probably will want to get in on early is going to be Jaws.

[16:36] Other than that, you're not going to need to get in on anything early. You're not. You know that.

[16:40] You know, it's not going to be hard getting a stranger things premium.

[16:43] It's never going to be hard getting a Venom.

[16:45] I mean, man, where we're going, we don't need roads.

[16:47] Where we're going, you're going to need a lot of money is my point of view on all of this.

[16:51] And it's exciting to wait because at these prices, I've been so deflated.

[16:55] I've heard from so many of you.

[16:57] Nobody's excited about just tossing this much money at all of these titles that aren't really that magical.

[17:04] We're going to wake up next year and realize we've been staring down at games that don't have a lot of mechanical magic in them.

[17:12] They don't.

[17:13] We've been hoodwinked with a ton of beautiful artwork, a ton of great animations,

[17:18] and Stern Pimball has controlled the narrative exactly where they want it to be.

[17:22] We're now paying twice as much money for their games with not twice as much in them.

[17:27] And I get it. You love code and coding machines is fun.

[17:31] But are we buying Pimball machines for software or are we buying Pimball machines for software and mechanical magic?

[17:39] And we're going to get it. And we're going to get it in the most amazing way.

[17:42] And we're going to get machines that visually, I mean this, visually blow away anything you've ever seen before.

[17:49] So if you're someone who just likes pretty games, trust me.

[17:53] If you knew what I knew, you're going to want to free some space up in that collection right now.

[17:59] And it's all closer than you think.

[18:01] The objects I know about are closer than you can imagine.

[18:05] And I know it's hard to be patient.

[18:07] I know we've lived in this hobby for like a decade of FOMO.

[18:11] I know you're seeing all the content that your life will be better if you buy what's available now.

[18:17] And you know, for those of you who believe in Canada, those of you who are a part of this community,

[18:23] I just want you, I know I'm not giving you the details you want, but I just ask each and every one of you to trust me on this.

[18:31] By the end of next year, you're all going to say, I'm glad I listened to Canada.

[18:36] I'm glad I waited.

[18:38] I'm glad I didn't rush at all of the games trying to desperately get sales before Jaws comes out.

[18:44] And that is it for this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[18:47] It's a fun one.

[18:48] I'm out of breath.

[18:49] I'm out of breath.

[18:50] I'm just so excited for what you're going to be excited about.

[18:52] And no, don't bother trying to ask me to give you the details.

[18:56] It's not going to happen, all right, everybody?

[18:59] Just know if I don't make it to Pinball Expo, I won't even care.

[19:03] Because that's not the expo to be at, everybody.

[19:05] But look, have a good time there.

[19:07] It's going to be fun.

[19:08] I do wish my friends with the Mystery Pinball Company a great show.

[19:11] I hope Jersey Jack can change all of our minds and knock it out of the park with freaking Elton John.

[19:16] Man, they've got their work cut out for them.

[19:18] People are just not excited about this theme.

[19:21] Pinball Brothers, you know, I hope you deliver a remake that people really want.

[19:25] I think the remake world is running a little thin.

[19:28] But man, I just want new magic.

[19:30] And that's it.

[19:31] And that's why the only thing I'm really excited for is the Mystery Pinball Company.

[19:34] And again, because I think Jersey Jack needs to work twice as hard as this new company to win people back.

[19:40] You know, Jack made such a good first impression with this company.

[19:44] And man, after all of these games, after all of these games, Jack, Steve Ritchie,

[19:49] you're going to really have to blow us away.

[19:52] There's going to be no middle ground.

[19:54] And I just have this strange feeling they're not going to bring games to the show.

[19:58] I think they're going to show it on PowerPoint.

[20:01] And I think they're stalling because they want to lock in nonrefundable orders because they're terrified of Keith Elwyn.

[20:08] Everybody have a great day.

[20:10] And by the way, sometimes people think my songs are like a clue to what I'm talking about.

[20:15] No.

[20:16] And I did hear a rumor that Jersey Jack passed on the Beastie Boys.

[20:20] So that is why this song is on this episode.

[20:22] But that is not one of the titles I'm talking about for next year.

[20:26] Later.

[20:50] Thank you.
