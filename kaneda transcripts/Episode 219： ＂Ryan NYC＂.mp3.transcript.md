[00:00] Intro

[00:22] Welcome ladies and gentlemen to episode 219 of Canada's Pinball podcast.

[00:29] This is going to be a really, really, really fun podcast to air for you guys.

[00:34] So yesterday, Ryan C from Head to Head Pinball was in New York City during the blizzard and

[00:42] we were hanging out.

[00:43] I was able to work from home yesterday and so he came over and we had a nice little lunch

[00:47] at Wolfgang's Steakhouse on Park Avenue.

[00:51] I told Ryan, you can't just spend all your time in New York City playing pinball.

[00:57] You actually have to go eat something amazing.

[00:59] So we had a nice lunch, had a jump on a work hall and then we did a sort of like a trifecta

[01:04] we had myself.

[01:05] We had Ryan, we had Brenda join the podcast, even Bubba interfered every once in a while

[01:11] and I think even Marty chimed in at some points as well.

[01:14] You'll have to just listen and hear.

[01:17] But without further ado, I want to air this fun, fun podcast where we recap TpF and other

[01:23] stuff going on in the hobby and I want to get this up so so Ryan can listen to it on his

[01:28] way back to Australia.

[01:31] Here is episode 219, the combining of Head to Head Pinball and Canada's Pinball podcast

[01:38] for your listening pleasure.

[01:41] Welcome to the non-Canada's Pinball podcast.

[01:47] I don't give a shit what episode this is because we know that Canada is going to introduce

[01:50] it himself and probably branch for about 25 goddamn minutes before we even get into this

[01:56] interview.

[01:57] Special.

[01:58] Today I'm sitting here, the one and only, his better half, the mother of Bubba, Miss Brenda

[02:06] with Canada himself and our dear friend Ryan.

[02:10] Ryan, welcome.

[02:11] You have now spent the last God bless you four or five hours with us.

[02:16] And we've had a great meal.

[02:17] You've also put up the me being on an hour and a half conference call with work and God

[02:22] bless what else is going on.

[02:24] I'm trapped here, it's snowing outside.

[02:26] I can't actually leave.

[02:27] Precisely.

[02:28] I'm pretending to like you guys.

[02:29] God bless you're a fucking soul.

[02:30] It's like the movie Misery.

[02:32] Ryan's going to wake up in the bed with like a wood board between his feet.

[02:36] Can I read you if that's not the case?

[02:39] Yeah.

[02:40] But anyway folks, welcome.

[02:42] Welcome.

[02:43] Welcome.

[02:44] I always want to talk about TPS because apparently that just happened.

[02:47] They want to do a recap.

[02:48] I think that's kind of boring because I feel at this point everyone's done that, right?

[02:51] Not exactly.

[02:52] Chris doesn't listen to other podcasts.

[02:53] Yeah.

[02:54] Yeah.

[02:55] Yeah.

[02:56] I just think so.

[02:57] Chris hasn't done his TPS.

[02:58] I mean, I just want to know.

[02:59] I want to know Ryan agrees with everything I said about TPS.

[03:03] I am curious because we just both got back from the show.

[03:07] Okay.

[03:08] And do we want to talk a little bit about what we feel coming out of the show?

[03:13] Show.

[03:14] I know a lot you guys by the way.

[03:15] I know the majority of this like listenership is American but.

[03:17] We've got three different nationalities here.

[03:19] We have.

[03:20] You're a huge fan.

[03:21] And Irishman.

[03:22] And Irishman.

[03:23] Who's the Irishman?

[03:24] And an American man walked into a bar.

[03:27] Yeah.

[03:28] All right.

[03:29] And this change Jen is in the last 20 minutes.

[03:31] An Irish woman.

[03:32] An Australian man.

[03:33] The show really needs a lot track.

[03:36] Okay.

[03:37] Let's talk about coming out of TPS.

[03:40] All right.

[03:41] We both have now a few days to sort of compress and to digest everything we saw.

[03:48] Like, who do you think won that show?

[03:49] Like, what were you most impressed about Ryan coming out of TPS?

[03:52] Haven't you seen that spreadsheet that's being passed around Chris?

[03:55] Did you not get involved into it?

[03:57] No.

[03:58] I'm not.

[03:59] I'm not.

[04:00] Okay.

[04:01] There's a spreadsheet passed around.

[04:02] I can't be bothered bringing it out.

[04:03] But spooky one TPS because they announced three different things.

[04:09] They were all going and joining them.

[04:10] They announced 10 A co-op modes.

[04:13] What, they demoed it out.

[04:15] And I was keeping it up in their castle.

[04:17] So three big things.

[04:18] So no one really got close to that, right?

[04:21] Right.

[04:22] I mean, it was a big reveal.

[04:24] What did you think before we go?

[04:25] We'll talk a little bit about spooky boat.

[04:27] What do you think about Kingpan?

[04:29] The remake of Kingpan.

[04:30] Did you get a chance to play it?

[04:31] Yeah.

[04:32] I played a couple of games on it.

[04:33] I like it.

[04:34] I don't think they should make an unlimited amount because it just, I think, I

[04:39] would hold people back from buying it.

[04:41] But I believe they're making a special mode right up there, sending the software.

[04:47] So because right now, a decent player can finish that game in 15 minutes.

[04:52] So as I click this piece, sure, but as a game that people will buy and put on site, I think

[04:57] it doesn't need that extra bit of software.

[04:59] And it's Kingpan and existing game that they're like, re-enhancing or redoing, or is it

[05:04] a whole new-

[05:05] Basically, Capcom, like they weren't really in Depimble and they got into Pimble and

[05:08] they made a couple of games and they all sucked.

[05:10] I'm not sucked, but they weren't that great.

[05:12] And then they were bringing out, they made a prototype of Big Bang Bar and Kingpan and then

[05:17] they pulled the plug.

[05:19] So those two, Big Bang Bar was remade and they go for like $15,000, I guess.

[05:24] And then Kingpan, they had half of them, like seven or eight or something.

[05:28] There was nine, but like one was destroyed.

[05:30] Don't a fire.

[05:31] Yeah.

[05:32] So they go for like 30 to 50,000 US dollars.

[05:35] So they need to cover spin, so.

[05:36] So I have some folks who have those like nine or last games, but it's just how they

[05:42] feel about them.

[05:43] It's an interview, right?

[05:44] Well, they're clearly not happy because those games were selling for like $40,000.

[05:48] But it's not like they sell like every week.

[05:50] They probably sell every like five years or so.

[05:52] But that's completely compromised the value of their game right now.

[05:54] Well, they can say, I can puff their chairs and say, I have the one made by Capcom.

[05:58] You have the one made by someone else.

[06:00] But apparently the demo that was shown there wasn't made by them.

[06:06] It was kind of like the existing parts that kind of existed as part of Kingpanning's

[06:10] hand and Kingpanning's hand and all the stuff that he's sold.

[06:13] So I don't think they've actually made like they have to prototype all the parts and everything

[06:17] so they're very far away from producing this pin.

[06:21] Right.

[06:22] Yeah.

[06:23] I mean, I also agree that like, why would you remake the one of the rarest most expensive

[06:28] games of all time and basically say, we're going to make in a limited amount?

[06:33] Well, they're going to bring out the LA version, the not good art LA version.

[06:38] Have you seen it feature of this?

[06:39] No, I've not.

[06:40] But you also super made what was it they banned Barrow?

[06:41] Yes.

[06:42] And I remember when I started dating Chris first of all and he, him like basically, I'm

[06:45] like, oh, there's this game that's super cute and super rare.

[06:48] I don't like that.

[06:49] He just totally shuffled that.

[06:51] And but like we can't get our hands on one or whatever.

[06:53] So I can imagine that they do see that there is like this.

[06:56] But I was talking about Magic Girl.

[06:58] No, you weren't.

[06:59] And who was who you think would be looking to get their hands on this.

[07:03] So yeah, if you could create a version that was accessible, not this high end like prototype

[07:08] version or whatever it is.

[07:09] Right.

[07:10] And sure, there's demand for that.

[07:11] I mean, look, I think it's special when there's things in a hobby in a collectible

[07:17] hobby that there are a rare number of.

[07:20] If you just remake them, it loses some of its special.

[07:25] So Ryan right now is trying to look up the Ellie artwork for Kingkin.

[07:29] You might as well show, Brenda.

[07:30] I don't want Brenda to say that.

[07:31] You might as well just type into Google worst artwork ever.

[07:34] Okay.

[07:35] So the artwork already exists.

[07:36] I'm not going to show you the number one first, but this is the number one's pretty good.

[07:40] This is what I want the limited edition version to be.

[07:44] Right.

[07:45] What do you think about that?

[07:46] And it's kind of like a really poor man's got to be a student by a nine year old.

[07:53] Look at that.

[07:54] Look at that lingerie.

[07:55] Jesus Christ.

[07:56] Would you put your eyes away?

[07:57] But you're not afford the full pick pair of lingerie.

[08:01] Look at it.

[08:02] Look at it.

[08:03] It's the night I'm thinking.

[08:04] Look at the handwork.

[08:05] Look at the detail on the hand.

[08:06] I'm a great suit.

[08:07] It's like a kindergarten project.

[08:10] The artwork's terrible.

[08:11] I mean, I hope they don't use it.

[08:13] Alright, so Kingkin was there.

[08:15] We played it at the show.

[08:17] I like Ryan don't expect to see this game anywhere near 2018.

[08:22] I think we're going to see it maybe end of 2019.

[08:26] Okay.

[08:27] So after that, it was Alice Cooper's name or castle.

[08:30] Now you were at the reveal.

[08:32] Yeah.

[08:33] And how did you think the reveal went?

[08:34] This was spooky too.

[08:35] It was spooky.

[08:36] Yeah.

[08:37] It was fun for me because I just wanted to play it.

[08:42] But I guess I messaged Marty and I said, I kind of feel sorry for you because from

[08:47] what I can see them projecting on the screen, like you don't have no idea what's going

[08:52] on and now you have to wait a couple of hours for someone to take some hand video and

[08:56] upload it.

[08:57] But I know you're in marketing and you always hop on about you got one window to reveal

[09:01] the product and then after that, it's gone.

[09:04] It's not gone.

[09:05] I mean, I think my point is, I just wanted them to tell us more of a story behind the

[09:12] game and explain to us.

[09:14] Well, I can come later.

[09:15] It doesn't have to be when it's revealed.

[09:16] You want to sit there for, do you remember when Pat Lawler was telling us a story behind

[09:19] all the other?

[09:20] That was terrible.

[09:21] It's like the blind leading the blind when it comes to marketing with these pinball games.

[09:27] So Charlie gets up there 10 minutes later, you know, the game is on the floor and you

[09:32] had a chance to play it.

[09:33] So what were your initial impressions when you got to shoot the game?

[09:38] Yeah, I enjoy different things than you do back in the old Chris.

[09:41] I mean, everyone does.

[09:42] Some people just like it for the art, some people like it for the rarity, some people

[09:45] like the rules, everyone likes something different.

[09:48] Ryan likes it for the legs, the leg armor.

[09:51] Yeah, that's the one.

[09:52] The legs, the legs, the legs armor.

[09:55] So what did Chris have been drinking a little bit?

[09:57] Yeah, we've all been drinking.

[09:58] Oh, drink or not, drink that little sasley.

[10:00] Okay, so what did you, what do you look for in the first impression?

[10:06] Um, shot flow and some good sound and rules.

[10:10] Right.

[10:11] It was hard to hear it on the floor.

[10:12] Oh, yeah, they, they, they, next to TNA and just for the ball, you know.

[10:15] I mean, they're expecting for TNA to sell well as well.

[10:18] I'm pretty sure they got a lot of interest from TNA.

[10:21] There was like seven on there.

[10:22] Right.

[10:23] But TNA was overpowering the sound of Alice Cooper.

[10:26] Maybe that was a good thing because maybe I don't think there's any callouts from Alice

[10:29] Cooper in there yet.

[10:30] It was just kind of sound effects.

[10:31] It has the same sound system as total nuclear annihilation.

[10:35] So big plus there, that's better than, than Stern.

[10:37] It's better.

[10:38] Maybe equivalent to JGP.

[10:39] I'm not sure.

[10:41] Um, the, the, uh, what else?

[10:44] The rules.

[10:45] I guess they're not really there yet.

[10:47] It's, it's, it's an alpha code.

[10:48] You can, you can battle monsters, but it's quite hard.

[10:51] Um, yeah, it was hard to get a sense of like what you get, you got a sense of the flow.

[10:57] Yeah.

[10:58] You got a sense of the flow.

[10:59] You got a little bit of a sense of the music.

[11:00] But, but I, and whether that's what you expect to get though, uh, at a show like this

[11:04] where the game is basically in beta, right?

[11:06] A hand job.

[11:07] But, and if they, if they weren't making total nuclear annihilation, then they, they would

[11:11] have been kind of nothing being made now.

[11:14] So it might have been revealed earlier.

[11:15] So I guess maybe everyone's expecting a little bit more, um, to be shown, but that

[11:21] will come.

[11:22] I mean, they're busy now.

[11:23] It's a small company.

[11:24] So they, um, they're going to be making Tina and then that'll bring them up to Alice Cooper.

[11:28] So it's not, it's not, it's not flowable, right?

[11:30] No one was saying wow.

[11:31] This is like Steve Richie or, or Pat Law or like it, it's, it's a bit more kind of, um,

[11:35] stop and go.

[11:36] The shots are, some of them are tight, some of them aren't tight.

[11:39] Um, it's unique.

[11:40] They have like, uh, uh, big designers or, or like, folks working on it or is it true

[11:47] to these guys who are doing it themselves?

[11:49] The company's growing.

[11:50] So they just hired Bone Karen.

[11:52] So he's like maybe in the top 10 pinball players in the world.

[11:56] And he's, uh, like since he was 19 years old, I've no idea how all these now, but I don't

[12:01] know, maybe he's been like involved in pinball for 20 years.

[12:03] So he knows like rules back to front.

[12:04] He knows what makes a fun pinball for everyone, not just top players.

[12:08] So he is now being employed as their rule designer.

[12:12] So I think that that was one of the big things as well.

[12:16] Yeah.

[12:17] That's great.

[12:18] They're getting higher quality like coming on board with them.

[12:21] That's great.

[12:22] Great.

[12:23] It was designed by Charlie.

[12:24] Charlie's the guy who started the company and, um, I guess he, he designed, uh, Rob Zombie

[12:29] and this is his second game, I guess.

[12:30] Cool.

[12:31] They're includes dominoes.

[12:32] You know, you know what's interesting is so the order of banks are going to open up

[12:36] soon on this game and.

[12:38] Well, they already have them.

[12:39] Right.

[12:40] They just want to take any orders on the date in person.

[12:41] Right.

[12:42] Email how she's the email to grace.

[12:44] And it's, it's a non-refundable deposits.

[12:46] We've talked a lot about this because the non-refundable part of spooky pinball games came

[12:51] later on in the Rob Zombie ordering process because what happened there is all these people

[12:57] ordered up at the, you know, in day one and then they were baneling out later on.

[13:02] Like months later, they'd ordered their games specifically the way they wanted it and

[13:06] Charlie's like, I can't do it like this because now I'm stuck with again that someone else

[13:10] wanted.

[13:11] What was more about the customizations, I think, um, people ordered it with a certain

[13:16] customization.

[13:17] They made it and then the person bailed out.

[13:19] They bailed out.

[13:20] But they did, they did very fun to everyone and they did enough selling all of them.

[13:22] But, um, so do you, do you think, um, do you think there's enough to see right now to

[13:27] make up your mind to buy or do you think that we're going to wait?

[13:30] Not me personally, but, um, I've got friends that have already, uh, sent the email through

[13:35] to put money down, but they're the Alice Cooper fans.

[13:38] If they say good art and they've got the promise of, of code, um, that's enough of them.

[13:43] I think you guys also tend to, and I say you guys and Ryan Gopbas, I'm sorry, I'm branding

[13:47] you the same brush, but I brimed Chris here.

[13:49] We're pretty different.

[13:50] Chris typically takes just tends to like think about these things as being like, oh my

[13:54] gosh, this needs to appeal to the masses, but it doesn't.

[13:57] It sounds like these guys are appealing to a very English.

[13:59] It's 500.

[14:00] 500.

[14:01] There are many more than 500 Alice Cooper fans out there.

[14:04] And I know many Alice Cooper fans who would not even know what the fuck pinball is, but

[14:08] be very excited.

[14:09] 99.

[14:10] I'm excited.

[14:11] I'm excited to also take this on as being a piece of memorabilia that, you know, embodies

[14:16] Alice Cooper if you're truly a fan.

[14:18] Okay.

[14:19] You don't have to be a pinball fan to appreciate this as being part of the scene.

[14:23] But put an asterisk on that because this isn't like a music pinball.

[14:28] I'm not sure if you play like Metallica or ACD, ACB, you get to go.

[14:30] Those are cool.

[14:31] Yeah, you get to select just some of the stuff.

[14:32] Like, hey, I really like a high-weight hell.

[14:34] I'm going to get that.

[14:35] Okay, with Alice Cooper, you don't get to clip your song.

[14:38] And I don't believe the song plays until you get a little bit further in the game.

[14:43] And school's out for summer isn't in there.

[14:45] His greatest, this is not a greatest hits and this is that from the very start.

[14:49] So I'm not sure if an Alice Cooper fan would enjoy the pin as much as they would if it

[14:55] was done in the way of ACD, you see on the top.

[14:58] Okay, sorry.

[14:59] Okay.

[15:00] There goes my argument.

[15:01] No, it's true though.

[15:02] I mean, do they look that far into it?

[15:04] Like just saying, hey, Alice Cooper, I like Alice Cooper.

[15:06] I'm going to buy Alice Cooper stuff.

[15:07] I think it's definitely within that same niche of audience you're looking at, but it's

[15:12] certainly a smaller success.

[15:13] But I'll say this, it takes a really, really die-hard collector of memorabilia because

[15:19] I've met guys who have like $2 million Star Wars toy collections and I'm like, are you

[15:24] getting the pinball machine?

[15:25] They're like, no.

[15:26] But I like what's pinball?

[15:27] No, it's just, it's just...

[15:28] Why does kiss like the old kiss still go for a decent amount?

[15:31] I mean, there's so many.

[15:32] How many are there?

[15:33] 15,000 or something.

[15:34] Like something crazy.

[15:35] The old one.

[15:36] This is from like the 19th.

[15:37] The initial.

[15:38] The sold state.

[15:39] They don't go for 15,000, do they?

[15:41] No, no, there was 15,000.

[15:42] Like 15,000, you know?

[15:43] Yeah, yeah.

[15:44] So many of them made and they're in a fashion condition.

[15:46] They still, they sell for like more than anything else.

[15:48] I think a lot of people, that was like the popular pin when they were growing up and

[15:53] it's like the one they want now.

[15:54] It has like that nostalgia value.

[15:56] Was it really the popular pin?

[15:58] No, it's actually like a pretty average game.

[16:00] I think it's just like...

[16:01] Well, Dean's in the door says like, kiss stuff holds its value because there's so many

[16:06] kiss fans.

[16:07] Right.

[16:08] It's like the type of music that you're into that you like collecting stuff.

[16:10] And I don't know, is Alice Cooper the same as people like collecting Alice Cooper stuff?

[16:13] I don't think so.

[16:14] I think it's a smaller, smaller segment.

[16:17] Yeah.

[16:18] But that's why, I mean Charlie's not making an Alice Cooper pin.

[16:20] It's a horror themed castle game where Alice Cooper is sort of like the...

[16:25] Gatekeeper of the spooky castle.

[16:28] So, like I think they're going to sell off 500.

[16:31] I just don't think he's going to sell out the way Rob Zombie sold out in the first week.

[16:35] Well, you know why Rob Zombie sold that quickly because of the flippers.

[16:38] Yeah, like guys like me.

[16:40] Exactly.

[16:41] I was in on it.

[16:42] You were in Rob Zombie.

[16:43] I had like eight Rob Zombie's up here.

[16:44] No.

[16:45] No, I was in on one.

[16:47] I was in on one.

[16:48] I think I bought like Ted's Rob Zombie.

[16:51] Ah, let's just go through it.

[16:52] How many people machines have you been on that you haven't gone through?

[16:55] All right, Dalden.

[16:56] Dalden, I was in on a bell.

[16:58] The sea.

[16:59] The collectors edition.

[17:00] Yeah.

[17:01] Got out of that.

[17:02] I was in on Ghostbusters Ellie, which I sold mine before I even got it.

[17:04] Well, I'm talking about the ones that you didn't enough.

[17:07] Um, well, okay.

[17:08] So, there's Dalden.

[17:09] Star Wars.

[17:10] Star Wars.

[17:11] Star Wars.

[17:12] There was, um, Guardians of the Galaxy I bailed on.

[17:15] I also am in on Pirates of the Caribbean collectors edition, which I...

[17:19] You're not getting that.

[17:20] I don't think I'm getting that.

[17:21] I just...

[17:22] Okay.

[17:23] Let's talk about Pirates because like...

[17:24] Did you get a chance to play more of Pirates of the Caribbean?

[17:27] Just one game.

[17:28] I've got one next to my house in Melbourne.

[17:30] So, I didn't want to...

[17:32] I know it sounds horrible.

[17:33] I don't want to waste time playing it when I can't play it there.

[17:35] Whereas all these other games I've got can't play them anywhere else.

[17:37] Right.

[17:38] So...

[17:39] That was a line.

[17:40] Did you see?

[17:41] I mean, there was always people like to play.

[17:42] Right.

[17:43] Now, there has been news this week.

[17:44] It's sort of coming to light that this game is not ship in Q1 2018.

[17:48] And it's not even ship in Q2 now.

[17:51] And I was at the Jersey Jack Factory yesterday.

[17:53] I know what it's...

[17:54] I mean, it's what it's sounding like.

[17:56] August is the earliest.

[17:59] We're going to see this game.

[18:00] Is that sound right?

[18:02] Well, your summer.

[18:04] Like, summer around then it'll be in the line.

[18:06] Okay.

[18:07] Summer...

[18:08] Yeah.

[18:09] All the seasons are slip.

[18:10] I mean, I think it's summer's three months.

[18:12] Yeah, summer is summer.

[18:13] It'll be on the line.

[18:15] So not necessarily shipping.

[18:17] It doesn't matter.

[18:18] I mean, it doesn't matter when it really ships because that game has more in it than

[18:22] any other game.

[18:23] More software and more effort and more assets and more modes.

[18:26] So...

[18:27] You know.

[18:28] So you think it's going...

[18:29] Okay.

[18:30] So you think it'll do all right, but do you think it was announced too early?

[18:32] Yeah.

[18:33] 100%.

[18:34] I mean, I guess they wanted to announce it for whatever reason.

[18:38] You know, we'll never get a real answer to why.

[18:40] Maybe they wanted to win Expo because their thoughts to him was going to announce.

[18:44] It's pretty exciting.

[18:45] They wanted to win in Arbitro, show that means nothing.

[18:48] You want to tweet me?

[18:50] Yeah, it's equivalent of putting a crypti.

[18:52] I mean, it's like when I went in a marketing award, it's like, it means absolutely nothing.

[18:55] I mean, I think Jack definitely hurt the sales of dialed in by going early on pirates

[19:00] announcement.

[19:01] Well, I mean, possibly a bit.

[19:03] I mean, everyone knows about the games that are coming anyway.

[19:06] So does it really hurt the sales?

[19:08] Like, does it hurt the sales of Deadpool that we know that I'm making is coming?

[19:13] Like, does it really matter?

[19:14] If they really want the next thing, they're going to hold on to it.

[19:17] Yeah.

[19:18] I agree with you on a theme levels, but I think once you see the game, it definitely changes

[19:23] your opinion about it.

[19:24] So yeah, we all know that it's going to be Iron Maiden, then Deadpool, then Monsters,

[19:31] then Beatles.

[19:32] Now, if I'm a buyer, I don't know how to actually get excited about any of those until I see

[19:37] them.

[19:38] But once you see it, I think it changes and solidifies more of people's decision making.

[19:43] So the pirate seems to be great.

[19:45] I mean, I just, I worry about J.D.

[19:48] AP.

[19:49] I worry because of how long people are going to have to wait to get it.

[19:54] Do you think Ryan, people are going to, you know, we're probably going to see Iron Maiden

[19:59] and Deadpool before pirates of the Caribbean even starts shipping.

[20:03] I mean, if they lose sales from it, they lose sales, but they don't, I guess they follow

[20:08] a different kind of model where they want to be able to make any game they want.

[20:13] I went there yesterday, they were still making Wizard of Oz, they were still making Hobbit

[20:16] and they were making Dildan, and there was like, there are three pins were there in

[20:20] final testing at once.

[20:22] And then add pirates into that and then add their next game.

[20:25] Like they don't want to say we're done with this game with Bill and Timnay.

[20:28] They want to have a family of machines that people want to buy.

[20:31] So a great game is a great game for everyone.

[20:33] Why are people excited about Monster Bash when the game is 20 years old?

[20:37] Why?

[20:38] Like, listen to both of you guys now just like going off in your, your bit name for a

[20:43] second.

[20:44] I kind of have to lean on the side of like agreeing with Ryan here in that like I've never met

[20:49] the guys, other than it comes in Rose's concert for less than five goddamn seconds and we

[20:54] both had a couple of drinks and having great old time.

[20:56] But from what I hear and what I'm seeing and again, not as an advocate collector by any

[21:01] means in fact, not as a collector period, but it sounds like these guys put their heart

[21:05] into it and what they're going to do.

[21:07] They're going to deliver a pilot.

[21:08] It might take them a little bit longer when they do it, but their heart and soul goes into

[21:12] it and what you get is a game you can actually trust versus what we see coming out from

[21:16] Stern, which is a mass-fine facture copy and paste blueprint.

[21:19] Wow.

[21:20] I mean, that's right there with the snack down.

[21:22] I thought you were about to be saying nice, I heard a sentiment and then you just three

[21:25] stern on the bus.

[21:26] Let me ask you guys a question.

[21:27] I'll just give you like my.

[21:28] Okay.

[21:29] Let me ask you guys a question.

[21:31] So Jersey Jack's next three titles.

[21:34] I want to ask you guys which one excites you the most?

[21:38] Prior to the Carabans, Toy Story or Willy Wonka.

[21:42] Which Willy Wonka?

[21:43] Willy Wonka.

[21:44] Willy Wonka.

[21:45] What did you say before it lunch?

[21:46] Willy Wanker.

[21:47] Willy Wonka actually.

[21:48] But you would say Willy Wanker.

[21:50] Willy Wanker should be the collector's edition.

[21:53] I'm sure for the corrections he said, Willy Wonka.

[21:58] Andrew Highway's hand comes out of the car.

[22:00] This is the topic at lunch earlier on today.

[22:02] So yes, he's moving on and even Bubba is interrupted.

[22:06] Bubba, you want to Willy Wanker?

[22:08] No, no, he just doesn't.

[22:10] He does.

[22:11] I can hear him.

[22:12] Go pat him.

[22:13] So Brenna, which one is yours?

[22:14] So you said, you said Toy Story.

[22:16] Hands down.

[22:17] I don't want to do anything.

[22:20] I mean, Toy Story is the obvious one.

[22:22] But Toy Story is the obvious one because I think it'd be one that my kids can get involved

[22:27] with as well.

[22:28] Right.

[22:29] I think it's from the childhood.

[22:30] It kind of pulls on those heartstrings of me watching with my family when I was five

[22:34] years old, just like Wizard of Oz.

[22:36] So that is in the same category as Wizard of Oz for me and Alice in Wonderland.

[22:40] Those three things were the classic movies I saw walked with my parents.

[22:44] But Toy Story by Pat Lawler, if that's the room is coming out of JGP, you can't really

[22:50] beat that, right?

[22:51] Yeah.

[22:53] I think Jack's next two titles in Toy Story and in Wanka are going to like be the

[23:00] Wooder Shed Moment for the company.

[23:01] I think he needs to get there.

[23:04] They're still going to be expensive games.

[23:05] Yeah, I still expect them both to be like 9,500 per Nelly, 12,500 for a collector's

[23:10] edition.

[23:11] I think the big question for Toy Story is, is Jack going to get the right from Disney to

[23:16] have a video footage from the films, right?

[23:19] Is he going to have Tom Arnold, just a Tom Arnold, Tom Hanks.

[23:23] Who is Tom Arnold?

[23:25] He's a man Arnold from Tom Hanks, what's his name?

[23:30] Tim Arnold.

[23:31] Tim Arnold.

[23:32] Tim Arnold should be in it as well.

[23:34] Just a case to need a backup.

[23:36] But okay, so I think Jack's future looks pretty bright.

[23:40] I just don't want to wait like 18 months per game.

[23:42] And I think hopefully he can get pirates out sooner than later.

[23:46] Did you get a chance to play Houdini at all at Disney?

[23:49] Yeah, I played about 10 games of Houdini and only one of them was good.

[23:53] And luckily there was the ease of last one.

[23:55] So I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would because I couldn't find my shots.

[24:02] But then I found them.

[24:03] And I think it's a game that, yeah, I explained it on the podcast, I'm just repeating

[24:10] myself.

[24:11] But basically, I think it just needs to be made a little bit easier for the first time

[24:14] user just for the first couple of modes or give people a taste of what's to come.

[24:21] And then it can kind of be in the state that it's in now.

[24:25] It's definitely not the easiest game for the beginner.

[24:28] But I think people who have a lot of pinball machines and are pretty experienced of playing

[24:34] enjoy the level of difficulty in that game.

[24:37] All right, well, I've made some statements recently about at these shows.

[24:42] To me, the George Gomez, Ben?

[24:44] Well, no, the way these games are revealed.

[24:46] And I sort of considered us.

[24:49] And you and I collectively have two of the most popular podcasts in the general world.

[24:54] And I know the concept of us being pinball media, some people might laugh at that, some

[25:01] people might think that's a real thing.

[25:04] But you and I, we take to the airwaves and we have anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 people

[25:09] who listen to every episode in our opinions about these games matter.

[25:13] Do you think when we go to these shows, like dudes like us should get some sort of experience

[25:19] with the manufacturers and the games that are a little bit more tailored and personal,

[25:24] because in my industry, marketing, whenever a company is announcing a new product, they

[25:29] separate the mass consumer from the media.

[25:34] And they give the media a little bit more of an in depth look at it.

[25:37] Like an iPhone reveal or...

[25:39] Yeah, and we're treated like another freaking, you know, schlaugh from Texas who's just thrown

[25:43] into the mix.

[25:44] Well, maybe people are afraid that you won't give a favorable opinion on it.

[25:48] Are you a top?

[25:49] Which one?

[25:50] Which camera?

[25:51] Inzur-Laptrak.

[25:52] Is there a lap track that I have?

[25:54] Marty.

[25:55] Any end block?

[25:56] I feel like I need to go to the toilet right now.

[26:00] No, I'm just saying, so what do you think?

[26:02] Do you think we are?

[26:03] Should we start to be considered to be pinball media?

[26:07] I think we, as much as I didn't start podcasting for is, I think we definitely do have some

[26:13] kind of influence.

[26:14] As long as the listener respects your opinion, if you talk a lot of...

[26:20] Bubbles growing.

[26:21] Bubbles growing.

[26:22] If you talk a lot of crap all the time, then people might start to tune out and not respect

[26:26] your opinion and just listen for other reasons.

[26:29] But yeah, I mean, a lot of people recognize me just from kind of talking and it was

[26:36] fun to meet all the people that listen to the podcast.

[26:39] But sometimes I just prefer just to be a normal person and just kind of blending with the

[26:43] crowds and...

[26:44] Yeah.

[26:45] So, but I definitely understand.

[26:47] The fame gets to us at times.

[26:49] The target walker.

[26:50] The deal is slippery.

[26:51] No, I understand what you mean.

[26:53] I think they did that at Expo in Chicago with like Zach from straight down the middle,

[26:58] got some exclusive footage of pirates before it was revealed.

[27:03] Like the, you know, the dolding clickers edition people got that experience.

[27:06] Right.

[27:07] Plus him.

[27:08] And then he filmed all this video and then when it was revealed, then he uploaded it.

[27:12] So he had kind of better footage than everyone else because it wasn't in a loud room.

[27:16] Whereas the footage I was like, I was keeping that in my parcel, you can't hear, game,

[27:20] at all.

[27:21] So it's up to the companies to do things like that.

[27:24] I'm not going to be at every show anyway.

[27:26] You can.

[27:27] You can get to $100 flight.

[27:29] Right.

[27:30] I guess as I may make, they can think of.

[27:31] Right.

[27:32] Yeah.

[27:33] Well, these, these other podcasts too, some of them actually have like endorsement deals

[27:38] and these manufacturers, you know, have a really tight relationship with them.

[27:43] And I think, you know, they're definitely not going to come to my show for like a guaranteed,

[27:47] like, positive review of everything.

[27:50] Oh, that's, that's a thing.

[27:52] If you tell, if you don't have sponsors and you tell the truth all the time that when

[27:57] you actually like a game, I think it should hold more, more power than, you know,

[28:02] the same thing.

[28:03] Right.

[28:04] Someone who's sponsored by the same thing.

[28:05] I'm not saying that people are shilling for companies or anything like that, but like you

[28:09] said in the past, you can't shoot on someone that he buys into the house.

[28:11] Right.

[28:12] But best friends now, right?

[28:13] Well, you know, totally.

[28:14] And well, for you guys out there who, who have been listening to Bolt Head to Head

[28:17] and Canada's Pimble Podcast, you know, Ryan and I are really good friends.

[28:21] And I know some of you have heard us jab at each other back and forth.

[28:25] Our friends have Chris.

[28:26] Good night.

[28:27] Can I do a bit of an awesome.

[28:28] And we get, we get like emails from people who, like, are really

[28:32] like in this dilemma where they, where they feel like they have to choose one or the

[28:36] other.

[28:37] And what we're here to tell you as we hold hands and hold penises is that you don't

[28:42] have to.

[28:43] Like we're actually good friends.

[28:44] We're just having fun.

[28:46] Um, well, like I think, I think that it's time for the Pimble manufacturers to realize

[28:52] that there is some influence on the podcast, on the podcast.

[28:57] I'm like, that my awesome, uh, this week in Pimble, you know, Jeff over there is a really

[29:01] great resource for news and I, and we've even started to see him start to editorialize

[29:05] a little bit things that are happening.

[29:07] Um, but look, I mean, I, I do think we have some influence.

[29:11] I don't think we have like a ginormous amount because at the shows, you see that the majority

[29:15] of people who buy these things, they're not even on Pimple.

[29:18] They're not even listening to the podcast.

[29:20] We are, we are tailored to the hardcore person who just can't get enough, right?

[29:25] I mean, that's sort of our audience.

[29:27] Yeah.

[29:28] I mean, this is, this is Chris's opinion.

[29:29] I don't want any special.

[29:30] What's your opinion?

[29:31] Well, I don't feel like I need any, any special treatment, but, um, I don't know.

[29:37] I just, I like looking shit about Pimble.

[29:39] Right, right.

[29:40] You had enough money.

[29:41] I'm in the fun.

[29:42] I mean, that's the fun.

[29:43] I was thinking, well, Bob is barking or I mean, it's a, Boba, Boba is getting down.

[29:48] I mean, get him like bias.

[29:49] So what is, but we want to be part of the show.

[29:52] That's all that's happening.

[29:53] So I, I know I haven't disclosed the financial amount of money I spent on the left track,

[29:59] but it's, it's money responded to the left track.

[30:02] It is.

[30:03] I was going to do it.

[30:04] What I was going to do, but my, I didn't want to do it, is that I was going to say that we,

[30:09] I told you this other day, you probably drunk it, I remember.

[30:13] We purchased the, um, the last track from you as well.

[30:17] Yeah.

[30:18] But, but it wasn't you laughing.

[30:19] It was everyone laughing at you.

[30:21] I wanted to make a magic girl.

[30:24] I was going to spend 55,000 US dollars on two magic girls and get the whole room.

[30:30] You could buy Boba a lot together.

[30:32] No, I'm tell you, when that shrine is complete, John Papaduke magically appears.

[30:39] Chris and Lepa kind of care.

[30:41] And he's like, I've got a new company called.

[30:43] Hey, man, you need the leprechauns, I have this.

[30:45] Boba's about to take, okay, let's talk about deep root for a second, because I know that you had a deep root t-shirt on.

[30:50] Yes.

[30:51] Um, I had an advertisement in TPS that also made fun of deep root with my six days of canada.

[30:57] Do you think they're going to be able to actually get these games made in one year to have their five days of deep root happen at TPS 2019?

[31:06] Chris, it's the power of quads assembly.

[31:09] A lot of assembly.

[31:10] And that's sledgehammer quads.

[31:12] Now, you, you keep saying to me, quad assembly is for dudes.

[31:16] It's just around a play field like getting it together.

[31:19] That's what it means.

[31:20] I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure it means that instead of one person screwing into bolts, you know, all day, like the same bolts and then passing it on, passing it on.

[31:29] It's four people that work on the machine only, I believe.

[31:33] I mean, this is just what kind of came out of TPS, but I mean, the people that are working for him, I'm happy to work for him because he pays them.

[31:40] Who's going, they're going to pay.

[31:41] He has money and they want a steady job, right?

[31:44] So why not?

[31:45] But I didn't see him there.

[31:47] I had a little t-shirt that said, who's up to five days of deep rooting?

[31:51] And I got a Dennis Norman Barry Ausler and David Field to sign it, but I didn't find Robert.

[31:57] Oh, shit.

[31:59] All right.

[32:00] All right. Well, sorry guys, I just knocked over a glass.

[32:02] We'll have to edit that loud bang out.

[32:04] So Ryan was wearing a deep root shirt.

[32:07] I had a bunch of shirts on at TPS.

[32:09] So I look, I think that it's interesting that they're trying to remake the J-pop games.

[32:14] I think we're lucky around.

[32:16] You don't have to worry about that.

[32:17] You can sit from the sidelines finally and not stress out about the price of the Atlantic.

[32:21] What do you think?

[32:22] Because my friend is trying to sell his magic, right?

[32:24] And he started at like 23,000, then down to 22, then...

[32:29] The sunshine?

[32:30] Robert, this is Robert and New Jersey, my friend.

[32:33] What do you think it's worth now?

[32:36] I don't really care.

[32:37] I mean, like, I know you care about it, and it's really interesting, but...

[32:41] No one needs a shit about magic.

[32:43] I agree.

[32:44] I mean, I don't care anymore either.

[32:45] I mean, I just think like it's really...

[32:47] It's hard to get excited about the Zid where it titles anymore.

[32:51] I think people have been beating down so much.

[32:53] Well, it's always going to be red, because if they remake it, it wouldn't be the same.

[32:56] So, you think by magic ill because...

[32:59] Well, I guess you said that he's thought it was going to be like really good stuff again.

[33:02] I thought it was going to at least work.

[33:04] I mean, I thought after five, six years of development,

[33:08] he wouldn't put a game in a box unless all the features functioned, and I was wrong.

[33:14] You actually can sell the 20,000-hour Pimble machine that doesn't even work on any level.

[33:20] We'll see.

[33:21] I mean, what Robert has done, and he's made everyone talk about him without actually doing anything except hiring people.

[33:28] Right.

[33:29] And that was his plan, right?

[33:30] To kind of say outlandish things, and then we all talk about how silly it is,

[33:34] but at least we're talking about him.

[33:35] Right.

[33:36] We're not talking about home-pin and stuff like that.

[33:37] Do you want to talk about that?

[33:38] No, thank you.

[33:39] No, thank you.

[33:40] All right.

[33:41] All right.

[33:42] Okay, so home-pin, we don't want to talk about that game, it's not worth discussing.

[33:46] Let's talk about how we pinball.

[33:48] So, yeah, let's move on to a much more positive.

[33:51] No, but how do we pinball?

[33:53] Do you think 2018 or Zer, they bailed themselves out of the hall, or are they going to...

[34:00] Unfortunately, it's another manufacturer that I don't kind of currently care about too much,

[34:05] but it reports alien pinball when it's working is a pretty damn good pinball machine.

[34:10] But, yeah, I mean, unless you can sit there and actually buy it, I just...

[34:14] The saga's been going on for too long.

[34:16] Right.

[34:17] Right.

[34:18] How many episodes have you done concentrating on highway pinball?

[34:20] Probably 215, and my 215.

[34:23] Yeah.

[34:24] And how many alien pinball machines were there on the weekends?

[34:27] There were none.

[34:28] Yeah, none.

[34:29] There was one coin thing that you didn't have any.

[34:31] There was one big Lebowski, which wasn't even brought by Cointegger.

[34:34] It was brought by owner in the area.

[34:36] Yeah.

[34:37] And it's a shame, because I think at a bulk of those machines, I do still, when I stand over the big Lebowski,

[34:42] I love that machine.

[34:44] It was fun.

[34:45] I got forced to play a lineup for half an hour, and I didn't want to.

[34:50] And then I realized how fun it was.

[34:52] It's a fun game.

[34:53] I'm not saying it's the world's greatest game.

[34:56] But it's better than I guess people get credit for because of all the negative stigma that is surrounding it.

[35:01] Right.

[35:02] Right.

[35:03] Well, let me ask you just like a macro question about the hobby Ryan.

[35:06] And we've talked about this on our own time.

[35:09] But there's so many games coming out.

[35:12] Yeah.

[35:13] And is there just like a level of just maybe it's fatigue, maybe it's just exhaustion, maybe it's just really hardly get excited every month.

[35:21] Because someone else has a new idea for a new machine.

[35:25] And as someone who is always potentially a buyer, you know, how do you keep getting excited about Pimball

[35:33] and the market gets so inundated with everyone hoping to be the next big thing in Pimball?

[35:39] All right.

[35:40] So I guess the way to answer that is it depends who the person is.

[35:43] So you have a self-admitted like a collector.

[35:47] So I can see you not being excited about anything because the production numbers of all these things are too high.

[35:52] Not special.

[35:53] And even if they're at like three or four hundred, you know, once Stern announces a super early, you know, I'm sure you're going to be trying to jump on board with that.

[36:00] I'm going to read it.

[36:01] Right.

[36:02] So someone who is owns Pimball machines on site, they can be excited about a lot of Pimball machines, especially all the Stern pros that come out.

[36:09] They're like, wow, this is a brand new game.

[36:11] You put it on site.

[36:12] I can sell my game.

[36:13] It's been there for two years.

[36:14] It's kind of down in sales.

[36:16] For me, as a player, I can't get excited about new reveals anymore because I don't want the same thing to happen before where I get too hyped up about a Pimball machine and I get sold on the promise of code.

[36:31] And then it gets to a certain stage and they move on to the next.

[36:34] And then you're stuck with a Pimball machine for two years.

[36:36] And I don't know if they do that deliberately to stop people from selling it.

[36:39] They're like, hey, kiss code will come.

[36:41] Go to the post and code will come because if they say we're done and it sucks, then the math gets flooded with Pimball machines.

[36:47] Right.

[36:48] People are still like, okay, I haven't waited a year and a year turns into two or three years.

[36:52] Right.

[36:53] They're almost like held hostage.

[36:54] Exactly.

[36:55] And I'm not sure I'm not trying to, you know, I'm just playing Devils at the beginning, I guess.

[37:00] I don't know if that's their intention or it's just like George Gomez said, we don't intentionally do this.

[37:05] We just kind of get stuck behind kind of unrealistic schedules that we set ourselves and the outcome of that is kind of poor code.

[37:14] And we've made highs to address that.

[37:16] So do you think they're going to actually solve that problem, Stern?

[37:20] Because it's like, well, this is the thing.

[37:22] I mean, they hired a bunch of coders, but then they went and hired another designer.

[37:26] So that's why I kind of asked the question, does, you know, in these in George Gomez's talk, does that mean?

[37:33] Designs are going to get a longer time to design games.

[37:36] What does that mean that more games are going to come up for a year?

[37:39] I don't think you just said we're still going to aim for three cornerstone titles.

[37:42] And I can't remember what he said after that.

[37:44] It was two times.

[37:45] So I mean, I just don't think it should take longer than a year ever.

[37:49] Like this would be inexcusable in the video game world.

[37:52] It's just inexcusable to buy a product that's a toy that's a game where you would have to wait more than a year for the final thing to be complete.

[38:01] I guess the end is, I mean, they didn't do that back in the day, but the games were a lot more simple.

[38:06] I mean, I guess I got access to what Scott goes through to do code updates because I had a machine at my house that was my friend Nimis.

[38:15] And I was kind of trying to help squash some bugs and, you know, you fix one bug and then another one pops up and, you know, like 16 internal software updates before it was made final.

[38:25] And that was just for a bunch of small changes. So I can't imagine a more complex game.

[38:29] How the web of code just kind of gets harder and harder to fix.

[38:33] Right.

[38:34] I have to balance it out.

[38:35] I don't know. It's not a job that I envy being a code for a software.

[38:38] And we're still waiting for the final quiz code, right?

[38:41] KISS.

[38:43] Ghostbusters.

[38:44] There's more ACDC code coming, but no one's really complaining about that.

[38:48] The hobbit.

[38:49] There was a bad man.

[38:51] Yeah.

[38:52] You say final and I'm jumping back in.

[38:54] I've been out walking.

[38:55] But I feel like there's no space for this final right?

[38:59] Because it's constantly evolving.

[39:00] This is the beauty of code.

[39:01] You can always polish a game.

[39:03] You can always add more to it.

[39:04] I think even when I played the new Batman code this past weekend at T.P.F.

[39:09] There was a lot more in it in areas that didn't even need improvement.

[39:13] Like there were all new video clips from the Joker mode and from Catwoman.

[39:18] That's not even the stuff people are asking for.

[39:20] They're asking for back girl and they're asking just for like final wizard mode.

[39:25] And so it's a cathedral of pinball machine.

[39:29] It can be constantly polished and built on top of.

[39:33] Because even like the code that exists in any game, it gets boring.

[39:37] Like you could redo the entire code on all the Valley Williams classics.

[39:41] And people would find it refreshing just to have a new take on the play field.

[39:46] And that's why the total nuclear annihilation kind of new code updates have been so welcome.

[39:52] Because you got co-op mode.

[39:54] Did you and I playing that with anyone?

[39:55] I played it, yeah.

[39:56] Was it so?

[39:57] Yeah, I mean it's the first time that you kind of playing with someone to reach a goal.

[40:01] Is it the first time in pinball history?

[40:02] Yep.

[40:03] It is.

[40:04] I mean the funny thing is if me and you wanted to do it now on Batman, we opened up the coin door.

[40:08] We turned extra balls off and then we said it's a six ball.

[40:11] And we just used to go one back and forth.

[40:13] So you can do the same thing, but it's official so people on site can do it.

[40:17] It's just a menu option by pressing the start button for more than like a second and then it activates.

[40:23] So that's fun.

[40:24] Like you can play with Brenda.

[40:25] Hey, babe, before we get married, let's try and take down reactor nine.

[40:29] We want to get married so let's not play back again.

[40:31] Yeah.

[40:32] My wedding, the theme of my wedding is total nuclear annihilation.

[40:36] Because of the thing of our relationship.

[40:38] So the wedding is false.

[40:40] So you're dating a pinball pod guest or that's the theme of your life, really?

[40:44] Each reactor is it, is it baby?

[40:46] Yeah.

[40:47] The more kids you have, the more intense against.

[40:48] Good Lord.

[40:49] We've nine children already.

[40:50] You're from an Irish family, right?

[40:52] No birth control.

[40:53] Mur?

[40:54] Isn't that what it is?

[40:56] You have eight brothers.

[40:57] You have eight brothers.

[40:58] You have eight brothers.

[40:59] Yeah, something like that.

[41:00] Something like that.

[41:01] Yeah.

[41:02] More like four.

[41:03] Okay.

[41:04] So what?

[41:05] We know Sturms got all these new hires, right?

[41:07] They've got new designers.

[41:08] And do you think we're actually going to see an increase in the quality of their games?

[41:14] Because they keep getting slammed for cutting corners for, you know, it's sort of like a parts-bend company.

[41:19] They're not, they're not innovating.

[41:21] They're not coming up with new mechs.

[41:23] What do you think we're going to see with Iron Maiden?

[41:25] Are you expecting Iron Maiden?

[41:26] It's a Keith Allen game.

[41:27] Yeah.

[41:28] Are we going to see Sturms turn the corner a little bit?

[41:32] Well, I mean everyone's saying that Iron Maiden is Acha.

[41:35] So Acha has a pretty unique layout.

[41:38] So do you know this story, Brenda?

[41:40] Acha.

[41:41] Oh, no.

[41:42] Do you know Acha, the...

[41:43] TV show?

[41:44] Yeah.

[41:45] So like the number one pinball player in the world made that kind of any spare time with his brother.

[41:49] Hey, it's a cartoon.

[41:51] Yeah.

[41:52] So he made his own pinball machine.

[41:53] And just for himself, just one.

[41:55] Like a...

[41:56] And then Sturms hired them as a designer.

[41:58] And then all of these kind of projects on my head of blog just kind of like disappeared.

[42:03] And now Iron Maiden is coming out and it's rumored to be him using that design as Iron Maiden.

[42:10] So everyone's kind of already seen what is possibly going to be revealed.

[42:14] And yeah, I mean, that's a unique design.

[42:17] Let me show a question about that because to me that sounds lazy.

[42:20] Well, he designed a game for a show.

[42:23] And you design a game.

[42:24] I always think...

[42:25] It's insufficient.

[42:26] No, but I always feel like it is.

[42:27] You guys...

[42:28] A design, a physical design.

[42:29] Yeah.

[42:30] Should it represent...

[42:31] You should start with a theme in mind as you start to design it.

[42:34] So if he designed this for Archer, what if I had this Archer and Iron Maiden have to do with each other?

[42:38] I mean, they can change little aspects of it.

[42:40] It's not going to be exactly the same.

[42:42] And there was nothing on that play field that screamed Archer.

[42:45] Right?

[42:46] So...

[42:47] And from a creative mind to a creative mind, can I challenge you in the exact same way?

[42:50] Are you pointing to me for that second creative mind of Ryan?

[42:52] Yeah.

[42:53] And to Bella, exactly.

[42:55] From Bella to you, when you think about the clients that you pitch to,

[42:59] how many ideas do you essentially reskin?

[43:02] Because the premise or the core of what you're actually presenting doesn't actually matter what the theme is.

[43:07] You can reapply it.

[43:08] It's a fair point.

[43:09] I'll do a little note that point.

[43:12] But like, I just think that this game...

[43:15] I think people at high expectations for Iron Maiden.

[43:17] Because we know it's Zombie ID.

[43:18] It's Keith Ellens' first game.

[43:19] And I think whenever you're a new designer in your game's going to market, you want to make a name for yourself.

[43:25] But I like about it.

[43:26] And I'll tell you what excites me the most is everyone who's hungry will make the best thing.

[43:33] And I think that everyone is going to be hungry for people to say, I've arrived.

[43:37] This is my thing.

[43:39] You know, when they said, they said Brian Eddie has joined Stern, right?

[43:42] Yes.

[43:43] It's his design at some game.

[43:44] Which is your...

[43:45] Yes. I know what you're going to say.

[43:46] It's really interesting that Eddie has designed medieval madness and attack from art.

[43:51] Is that a more on-game of all time?

[43:53] Which...

[43:54] Well, critically, it sold like Harlow, like 3000 units.

[43:57] Or 4000.

[43:58] But in terms of...

[43:59] It's ranked number one.

[44:00] It's ranked number one because people are like, wow, this game has been sold.

[44:03] Yeah, Adam's fan made it on the show.

[44:04] Oh, so from a game made for his back to this one?

[44:06] Yes.

[44:07] But it's like...

[44:08] Now, what do you think, Brian Eddie's game is?

[44:10] Do you think it's monsters?

[44:11] Maybe beetles?

[44:13] Maybe beetles?

[44:14] You know this.

[44:15] So Gomez is one of those, you think, right?

[44:18] I have no idea.

[44:19] I mean, there's no point.

[44:20] I mean, there's no point.

[44:21] I'm worried.

[44:22] Do you like have like a one-on-four shot of getting this right?

[44:23] Yes, exactly.

[44:24] What do you think?

[44:25] Well, let me ask you a question, Brian.

[44:26] Do you get more excited by who's designing a game or who's coding a game?

[44:29] It depends on who the designer is and it depends on who the coder is.

[44:33] I've discussed that before.

[44:34] It's that when Steve Richard brings out a game, people say to Steve Richard game.

[44:39] But when Lyman cheats as the coder, it almost doesn't matter who's the designer.

[44:42] The designer is because he will make it good, right?

[44:45] Right.

[44:46] Like a Keith Johnson pin.

[44:47] Like you say, you know, seems to pin more probably.

[44:48] It's a Keith Johnson pin.

[44:49] But it was designed by Joe Balsall, right?

[44:51] Right.

[44:52] So it really depends on who people follow if they follow the coder or the design guy.

[44:56] Brian, any attack from Mars, many of them are madness.

[44:59] They're two very similar games, almost identical in software and layout.

[45:04] But they play differently.

[45:05] And then he has the shadow.

[45:06] And he also decoding for Black Rose, which is a less creepy.

[45:10] And Indiana Jones too, right?

[45:11] And the head of the intro.

[45:13] That was Mark Richey.

[45:14] Was he on that team?

[45:15] I'm not sure.

[45:16] I know for a fact.

[45:18] I think so.

[45:19] Okay.

[45:20] You guys say that Brian knows more about pinball than me.

[45:25] Guys, there it is.

[45:26] We're up to you.

[45:27] I knew he was going to have an extra hero.

[45:30] And I was like, what's your question?

[45:33] I thought it was being like, you know, the youngest energy in this space.

[45:37] I feel like every name I hear when I ask who these people are.

[45:39] All the people?

[45:40] All the people.

[45:41] He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like, he's good.

[45:43] Yeah, that's great.

[45:44] But who's like the young blue.

[45:45] It's not an AC and every.

[45:46] Who's that?

[45:47] And who's Eric?

[45:48] Scott Danese is the guy who made Twitter, nuclear annihilation.

[45:51] Right.

[45:52] So he was making it.

[45:53] Another one making it for himself.

[45:54] Spooky approached him.

[45:55] And then said, let's make this.

[45:56] And it's it.

[45:57] It's sold 350, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it's break broken their sales records.

[46:02] And they produce them pretty slowly.

[46:04] Eric Minier was a designer.

[46:06] He was like an individual engineer for a Jesy Jack.

[46:09] And then Jack built him, you know, in quotes.

[46:13] And he made his own parts of the Caribbean, which is now one of the coolest designs that's coming out now.

[46:19] So Eric's younger than me.

[46:20] He's like 29.

[46:21] He's cool dude.

[46:22] He's cool dude.

[46:23] He's the biggest price that's in Pimble.

[46:24] He's about five times as big.

[46:26] Yeah.

[46:27] And he's got you guys.

[46:28] I'm seeing big triceps.

[46:29] You know, I like about Eric and Scott.

[46:32] I mean, they're different.

[46:33] Like, Scott's like a nice humble.

[46:35] Like, you know, he's a very nice nice guy.

[46:37] And Eric's also really nice.

[46:38] But I like Eric because he's got the swagger.

[46:41] I feel like he kind of, do you remember what he said in that in that presentation at X-Phone?

[46:47] He was like, we don't release here at JGP code in complete games.

[46:52] Right.

[46:53] So it's kind of makes sense.

[46:54] I mean, if it was out now, there's still some time to go, right?

[46:57] There's nearly a couple of resumes.

[46:58] The game looks great.

[46:59] And I see it as like, I hear nothing of a positive stuff about pirates.

[47:03] The music, which I've sort of parked on, like, you don't have the rights to the original score.

[47:07] But David has done an amazing job of them.

[47:10] I'm not even going to say his last name because I always get it wrong.

[47:13] Had he said, is it feel?

[47:15] Yeah.

[47:16] I think so.

[47:17] Or teal.

[47:18] Feel.

[47:19] Teal's like a color.

[47:20] Exactly.

[47:21] Teal's a nice color.

[47:22] And you guys need to say ruins.

[47:23] Ruined.

[47:24] Ruined.

[47:25] Ruined.

[47:26] Ruined.

[47:27] I can say Andrew highway two weeks.

[47:31] So look, I think it sounds great.

[47:33] I think the game looks great.

[47:34] I think people, you know, I'm not sure about the barn.

[47:36] I'm not sure about the barnacles on the collector's edition.

[47:39] But I think they're going to do well with the game.

[47:42] I mean, Eric is doing, this is the exciting part for me.

[47:45] See, Jersey Jack's future looks really bright.

[47:48] Pat Lawler is doing toy story.

[47:50] And Eric is doing Willie Wonka.

[47:53] And maybe the wanker collector's edition.

[47:56] Oh, no.

[47:57] Boba.

[47:58] The wanker.

[47:59] Boba, come on.

[48:00] But, no, those are the two new guys.

[48:03] Now, keep that one.

[48:04] He's new.

[48:05] But he's not young.

[48:06] And then Brian Eddie's also been in the industry for a while.

[48:10] I wonder, do you think Stern, it sounds like Stern is training a new level of designers and coders?

[48:16] Because there's rumor that Lyman Sheets is not retiring, according to my own podcast.

[48:22] But he's actually going to be overseeing some new young talent in the co-department.

[48:27] Okay.

[48:28] So we'll see if that's true.

[48:29] So, at all these games, Ryan, which game?

[48:36] Do you feel like you're going to buy something in 2018?

[48:39] Or you're going to be like me and just sort of wait to see what happens.

[48:44] Yeah.

[48:45] I'm available.

[48:46] Yeah.

[48:47] I'll wait and see.

[48:48] And I kind of, in this secondary market now, because I've got 21 people in the machines, I believe.

[48:52] And 21.

[48:53] Yeah.

[48:54] I couldn't even name them all without kind of looking at my pink sandipot.

[48:57] I'm going to give it a try.

[48:58] I'm going to give it a try.

[48:59] Okay.

[49:00] I have to name them in order.

[49:01] So, I've got, I've signed from Mars, the shadow, Doctor Who, Wizard of Oz, Star Trek,

[49:09] LE, ACDC Premium, Demolition Man, Metallica, LE, Twilight Zone.

[49:16] Does that say Trion Ali already?

[49:18] No.

[49:19] No.

[49:20] Trion Ali, Walk in Dead Premium, Walk in Dead Pro, because one of them is on site.

[49:25] I should be like cagling the cost of all these in my head right now, where he does this.

[49:28] I'm already doing that.

[49:29] Uh, the getaway, the Hobbit, Spider Man, it's 15, I'm doing pretty good.

[49:35] You're a setting bulb here.

[49:36] I've got a TNA.

[49:37] By the way, Baba was like slipping on the new floorboards before.

[49:42] That's interesting.

[49:43] And I felt really sorry for him.

[49:44] So I kind of got down on my knees to like helping him.

[49:46] And he was trying to comment on me.

[49:47] I'm like, all right, I'll help you so you don't have to like slip.

[49:50] And then he started to try and make love to you.

[49:54] And I was really disgusted.

[49:56] There was an intimate affair.

[49:57] Yeah, Ryan, Chuck, Joseph, you know, I'll tell you something because I'm very, very subtle.

[50:02] That's also how Barry and Yacht get pre-orders, but go on.

[50:05] But this fourth lay.

[50:06] All right, so Ryan, you've got a good amount of money invested in pinball.

[50:11] So you've got like a wide variety of games.

[50:14] So for a new game to come in, what's it I'm going to look for?

[50:19] Well, I mean, games are so expensive now and people get sick of them.

[50:22] Like you kind of harp on about like, how can you play a game and then sell it after 20?

[50:26] Cool.

[50:27] I'll buy a game after 20 for a thousand dollars less.

[50:29] Right.

[50:30] And I won't lose as much.

[50:31] So, you know, dialed in is probably the one that's on my radar the most when it kind of hits the right price.

[50:37] Because that game is good.

[50:39] And it doesn't matter if it's not fresh and something else has been announced.

[50:42] Do you guys get the games at the same rate that the America gets on?

[50:46] Well, the these turns are kind of the same rate if you do a direct conversion and add 10% tax.

[50:51] Because they're not so paid here.

[50:53] Right.

[50:54] Can't get it from a different state and to national tax.

[50:56] The JGP ones and some of the other ones have a bit more, you know, maybe one or two thousand dollars.

[51:02] I don't want to add to it as a straight.

[51:04] And then there's travel and then there's like a legitimate transportation.

[51:06] I won't, I mean, more no, that's kind of including to the price.

[51:09] Okay, cool.

[51:10] And then it's also timeline.

[51:11] How much longer would it take you guys to get on that?

[51:13] Well, not that much longer because they make ours first because they know it takes a month or so to get on that.

[51:18] Oh, that's great.

[51:19] Okay.

[51:20] So we didn't answer that one.

[51:21] We're not like buying the five year old game.

[51:22] So it's not like already when I was growing up, we just wait like four weeks for like the next release of a movie to come out.

[51:28] Oh, that's nice.

[51:29] Yeah, well, there's only four million people in Ireland for that box office.

[51:32] For me, and best people you want to know.

[51:34] The huge box office grows.

[51:36] Well, look, I mean, I think the hobby is in an exciting place right now, right?

[51:40] And I think 2018 is going to be a, it's going to be an interesting year.

[51:43] There's a lot coming out from Stern.

[51:45] There's a lot of new games coming out from other manufacturers.

[51:48] Chris, I want to talk about your next shrine.

[51:50] Yeah, my next shrine.

[51:51] So are you going to make a Batman shrine now?

[51:55] I'm not.

[51:56] I think I'm happy with Batman SLE.

[51:59] And for you guys out here.

[52:00] How many Batman SLEs you want?

[52:02] So right now I am the top bitter on the one on eBay right now.

[52:06] Brian, I didn't know this.

[52:07] Excuse me, what?

[52:08] Yeah, I'm sorry.

[52:09] Are we saving for a wedding and for a honeymoon?

[52:12] For $13,000.

[52:13] I'm the top bitter for $13,000.

[52:16] And look at that price, I'll buy it.

[52:18] I doubt I will remain the top bitter, but there was actually a Batman SLE.

[52:22] I'm not about that much.

[52:23] There's one on eBay right now.

[52:25] For you guys who are looking for a Batman SLE, this is the great thing about having a podcast,

[52:29] is now I can send 1,500 dudes to go get me off the hook to take her out there.

[52:34] Look, I'm happy with Batman.

[52:36] I think it's a really fun pin.

[52:37] And I think Brian's, I always say Brian, I'm like, that's when I get drunk on my Brian.

[52:41] Brian's the type name of Brian that's put a B in front of Brian.

[52:44] I'm really embarrassed for him when he says that.

[52:47] So Brian, I think the thing is, he's like, he's a real man's renderer, right?

[52:50] And he says it's all the time.

[52:52] There will be a point.

[52:53] There will be a point.

[52:54] As much as I say Batman's a keeper and it's my only game, I'll have it forever.

[52:57] When I will get bored.

[52:59] I mean, everybody gets bored and every day.

[53:01] I've got to check your order.

[53:02] How many games you think you've put it on it?

[53:04] How many games you play?

[53:06] I die early.

[53:07] I would say in total, I've put about 400 games on my machine.

[53:12] Okay.

[53:13] We just keep on talking.

[53:14] I'm going to check.

[53:15] But I've new code though.

[53:16] It's new code.

[53:17] So it doesn't matter.

[53:18] They keep up thinking the code.

[53:19] He's coming back.

[53:20] But here's the thing.

[53:21] You have to add the code.

[53:22] But here's the thing.

[53:23] Here's the thing guys.

[53:24] And trust me on this.

[53:25] I have a play field protector.

[53:26] So when I go to sell it, less than two in your place.

[53:29] Ten plays.

[53:30] I don't have that shrapnel on that.

[53:33] That's what everybody does.

[53:34] They just put new code.

[53:35] They're like less than under plays.

[53:37] And it's like, come on.

[53:38] These guys are all lying.

[53:39] But the game will be meant.

[53:40] Look.

[53:41] Ryan.

[53:42] What?

[53:43] Mint.

[53:44] You're going to sell that to the game as Mint?

[53:46] Don't ruin his side.

[53:47] It's a shame.

[53:48] Sorry, man.

[53:49] First code.

[53:50] Nothing is wearing him tearing.

[53:52] So.

[53:53] Is Mint as that nice like Honda that you're buying off the lot from Johnny.

[53:57] Johnny salesman.

[53:58] I knew you're as a kid.

[53:59] All right.

[54:00] So Ryan, what?

[54:01] Your flight is tomorrow.

[54:02] It's a blizzard in New York today.

[54:04] You won't get stranded.

[54:05] When is the next time you're going to be in the States?

[54:08] Do you want to come back for another show?

[54:09] My wife said I'm not allowed to come anymore without her and the kids.

[54:13] So probably never.

[54:14] I don't want a little trip for a week to the US to a pinball show to cost $20,000.

[54:21] Pinball polozer.

[54:22] Oh, good one.

[54:23] Oh, good one.

[54:24] Wait a second.

[54:25] Did you put polozer in a name?

[54:26] I'm definitely telling her.

[54:27] Yeah.

[54:28] That means like an insane party, right?

[54:29] Pozer.

[54:30] I mean, it sounds like something's going on.

[54:31] I know.

[54:32] It is.

[54:33] So hold on.

[54:34] But to that point though, you said there was an Austrian pinball, fast war war.

[54:37] Yeah.

[54:38] So there's a guy called Lee.

[54:39] I'm trying to get him on the podcast, but he's just like, he, he, he, he, he kind of.

[54:44] Everyone's a bit obsessive and against the people, right?

[54:47] Right.

[54:48] Chris, like you're on your podcast, right?

[54:49] You don't have to explain that to me.

[54:50] You don't have to explain that to me.

[54:51] You don't have to explain that to me.

[54:52] You don't have to explain that to me.

[54:53] You don't have to explain that to me.

[54:54] Yeah.

[54:55] Good Lord.

[54:56] So when do you overtake NextShiv as the Gold Sandbergs?

[54:57] I know.

[54:58] Where that happens.

[54:59] Are you going to write it back on the show?

[55:00] I should.

[55:01] He was a good guest.

[55:02] I think he would actually have more fun just coming on one of our shows.

[55:03] And then he was like, oh, he's having to do like a recap of his lack of recaps.

[55:08] Yeah.

[55:09] Okay.

[55:10] Okay.

[55:11] So, yeah.

[55:12] So he did the show once, but it, like the shows here, they rely on everyone around to bring their

[55:15] people to machines, right?

[55:16] In Australia, we're so separated, like the city to Melbourne, right?

[55:20] It's like nine hours.

[55:21] So no one's driving and hauling up in there.

[55:23] So he just relied on him.

[55:25] And I think maybe one or two other people.

[55:27] And there was like 200 300 machines there.

[55:29] Wow.

[55:30] And then you really killed him in sleep, you know?

[55:32] And he pay for what's advertising.

[55:34] And then there was like, he's really big news of something that happened in Australia.

[55:37] And then they pulled the advertisement and refunded him.

[55:40] But it was, that was what kind of when I fell in love with Pimble.

[55:43] But he's not going to do that again.

[55:45] But I just logged into my, I was the arcade where Chris is definitely.

[55:49] Has he been banned from my house?

[55:50] I think so.

[55:51] I think so.

[55:52] Yeah.

[55:53] Okay.

[55:54] How long does that take like a week?

[55:55] I'm bad.

[55:56] Well, I invited him on.

[55:57] And he behaved himself.

[55:58] And everyone was like, wow, Chris is an alright guy.

[55:59] What happened?

[56:00] Okay.

[56:01] And Star Wars came out.

[56:02] And then you, you decide to jump on the story.

[56:04] High five.

[56:05] That should have been.

[56:06] Every day.

[56:07] Every day, like, you guys are fucking idiots.

[56:09] Why are you getting Star Wars?

[56:10] You just gotta let people think they want man.

[56:12] That should have been.

[56:13] They should have been.

[56:14] They should have been Steve Richie, not me.

[56:15] But anyway.

[56:16] Anyway, so, okay.

[56:17] So he is doing a something called the barn.

[56:19] So this guy has something called the back cave in his house, right?

[56:22] You're in, yeah.

[56:23] So it's like a house like this, right?

[56:24] And then you take an elevator down.

[56:26] And it's like, like 20 pins on each side.

[56:29] It's like 40 pins.

[56:30] And then it opens up to this massive room.

[56:32] And he has all of his good pins there, right?

[56:34] And then the windows to this place is his pool.

[56:36] So has this like massive pool in his house and you look out.

[56:39] Look out.

[56:40] So I'm broke.

[56:41] Look out the back cave.

[56:42] Now, he's a higgin of bodice.

[56:43] Look out the back cave.

[56:44] On the back cave.

[56:45] Maybe, Australia.

[56:46] Yes.

[56:47] Is this guy?

[56:48] What, what, what, Pardon?

[56:49] What ages is this guy?

[56:50] I think 40.

[56:51] Single.

[56:52] No.

[56:53] Okay.

[56:54] You better fly over with you.

[56:55] You better go over there.

[56:56] That turns you on, Bruno.

[56:57] Yeah.

[56:58] So a certain amount of people machines in his house, the best ones in his backyard, he has a barn.

[57:03] It's like what Rhoda David has.

[57:05] He has 80 people machines in there.

[57:07] Right.

[57:08] Right.

[57:09] Can you see by people over to the back cave and then I think it was a bit too much.

[57:12] Because he don't have people alike.

[57:13] They, you know, give him an inch.

[57:14] They take it like a mile.

[57:15] Right.

[57:16] And the higgin is my group.

[57:17] Exactly.

[57:18] So people using his shower and stuff.

[57:20] So he's going to have this awesome event.

[57:22] And he just lifted it up last week.

[57:24] And I think he's filled 120 people only.

[57:27] And it's sold out.

[57:28] Two of his house.

[57:29] Sold out.

[57:30] It's free.

[57:31] Yeah, it's his house.

[57:32] So I'm going to free.

[57:33] Yeah.

[57:34] This guy's a community of this guy before he kind of disappeared.

[57:35] He was like the face of Pimble and Australia.

[57:37] Whenever they did like a news piece on Pimble.

[57:38] Hey, Pimble's making a comeback.

[57:40] He was the guy because he's like a likable character that has like most pins and a media like

[57:46] interviewing a cool guy with a cool room and all that stuff.

[57:49] Like Jack Danger.

[57:50] And Jack Danger came to Australia.

[57:51] He was on TV and it was like, it was the best.

[57:53] Because he's a character.

[57:55] His character is in us guys.

[57:56] Good looking.

[57:57] Have you met Jack?

[57:58] By Met Jack?

[57:59] No.

[58:00] You don't watch out if he makes that.

[58:01] No, I've not met Jack.

[58:02] Jack's happily married.

[58:03] What is this like?

[58:04] We're all pipping each other out right now.

[58:06] It's like 10 minutes.

[58:07] I'm trying to make it by Christmas.

[58:09] It's in good spirits.

[58:11] He's still not blushing.

[58:12] It takes a lot more of that.

[58:13] Yeah, no, I mean, you know what?

[58:14] Do you know what he was blushing?

[58:15] When George got a mess called him out.

[58:18] Yeah.

[58:19] Comment, comment, podcast, provocative and bullshit at the same time.

[58:22] I think he was blushing because he was secretly petrified but also so terrible.

[58:26] Look at him.

[58:27] I said it my last podcast.

[58:28] George got mess drives a car with 350 horsepower.

[58:30] Oh, I got it.

[58:31] He had to say it.

[58:32] He had to say it.

[58:33] He had to say it.

[58:34] Any questions?

[58:35] Anyone come on the steamer?

[58:36] He's nothing to do with their cars.

[58:38] Look, George is a great guy.

[58:39] He's the one who stole the word.

[58:41] The thing is this.

[58:42] It's like as much as I give Stern Pimball shit every once in a while.

[58:45] I own a Stern Pimball machine.

[58:47] I mean, at the end of the day, my money's in his pocket.

[58:49] So he's doing something right.

[58:51] And he knows that.

[58:52] Well, Ryan, like, it's been fun having you here.

[58:55] So what are you doing tonight?

[58:56] You think you're going to sunshine still?

[58:58] Yeah, I'm hoping to.

[58:59] Well, hey, it's snowing like crazy outside.

[59:02] I saw snow for the first time.

[59:04] I've seen snow on the ground before but I've never seen snow falling from the sky.

[59:08] And I know New York has hated it because it means canceled plans and this and that.

[59:13] But when was the last time you ever saw something new as a kid?

[59:16] So yesterday when I saw it, I was like, I wasn't talking about the world.

[59:19] I wasn't talking about the world.

[59:20] I wasn't aware.

[59:21] This is the coolest shit that snow falls in from the sky.

[59:22] It's like, it's almost like seeing alien Pimball machines in a bar.

[59:25] It's kind of free.

[59:26] Exactly.

[59:27] I hear that, Ryan.

[59:28] I moved over.

[59:29] We didn't have much snow in it.

[59:30] Yeah.

[59:31] And by the way, it's like a very giddy, but my first used snowballs.

[59:34] Yeah.

[59:35] So I'm so excited.

[59:36] I'm going to see if I can get to Sunshine Lundrumet.

[59:38] Not only to see the place, but to meet up again with Greg Poveralli, who's inviting me there.

[59:43] And I know you don't like toilet Pimball, Chris.

[59:45] No, it's great.

[59:46] Yeah, it's not as bad as if you take away your ego and like, oh shit, this guy beat me.

[59:50] People there just have fun.

[59:51] I told Ryan, it's like, you're in New York City and you're going to waste a night at Pimball

[59:56] League night.

[59:57] Well, we made up for it because we went to have a nice sort of steak lunch.

[01:00:01] He's got a good sort of taste of a New York City dining experience.

[01:00:05] So you have permission now.

[01:00:06] I mean, you don't waste your food.

[01:00:07] This is like the day in New York.

[01:00:09] I've done the tourist side.

[01:00:11] I said I wasn't going to do them, but I went up to the bull thing.

[01:00:13] I was like, what are we not doing here?

[01:00:15] It's just a it's just a steel bull.

[01:00:16] I went on the thing.

[01:00:17] I said, bull straight the ball.

[01:00:19] The ball.

[01:00:20] The fearless girl.

[01:00:21] Yeah, yeah.

[01:00:22] The funny thing is, like, it's still there.

[01:00:24] So funny thing is the girl like, I didn't even know about the girl because everyone just

[01:00:28] takes a picture in front of the bull.

[01:00:30] And no one's looking at it.

[01:00:31] Like the girl has seen that around and everyone's like, yeah, I got the bull.

[01:00:34] Yeah.

[01:00:35] And there's hot people as a front and hot people the back touching the bulls.

[01:00:38] Right.

[01:00:39] Cool.

[01:00:40] He's exactly my brother, daddy, but his head right in his rear.

[01:00:42] I got it.

[01:00:43] I love him.

[01:00:44] I love him.

[01:00:45] I love him.

[01:00:46] That's sex.

[01:00:47] Okay.

[01:00:48] So if I wasn't going to Sunshine, what do you suggest?

[01:00:49] I think I'll find it Sunshine.

[01:00:50] I think I'll find it tonight too.

[01:00:51] Because actually, actually, I might join you.

[01:00:52] I might join you.

[01:00:53] I've been multiple times.

[01:00:54] Yeah.

[01:00:55] Tonight is actually a good night to hunker down and play some pinball because there's nothing

[01:01:00] else you want to be doing in New York City.

[01:01:02] Well, Ryan, I appreciate you coming on the show.

[01:01:05] It was fun hanging at T.P.F.

[01:01:06] It's fun having you here in New York.

[01:01:08] We will one day make our way over to Australia at some point.

[01:01:14] And Brendan doesn't spread his leg.

[01:01:16] I don't think I'd be like, I mean, we kind of didn't say we're the goddamn where we're

[01:01:19] going for money moon.

[01:01:20] I don't think we're going for money moon.

[01:01:21] This is great.

[01:01:22] We planned to go to Australia.

[01:01:23] Before you came on, you were telling me how Marty was super excited to have me come back

[01:01:27] on head to head pinball.

[01:01:28] And Marty, I want to accept that invitation and it's not happening.

[01:01:34] That's pinball.

[01:01:35] You just have to shrug it off and get your trophy for second.

[01:01:40] It's a good laugh.

[01:01:41] Hey, the most I've ever seen you laugh or heard you laugh is during your business call

[01:01:47] where you weren't listening.

[01:01:49] Right.

[01:01:50] And you were playing the laugh track.

[01:01:51] And you sooner laugh into yourself in the corner by yourself.

[01:01:54] It wasn't even for me.

[01:01:55] I know.

[01:01:56] So I'm glad that you can use yourself.

[01:01:58] Ryan got a sort of taste of what it's like to work at my job where I sign onto a call

[01:02:03] and I put it on mute and then just like start playing football.

[01:02:08] But nobody who I work with who is a client.

[01:02:12] They're going to have to sift through 299.

[01:02:15] I'm going to have to say, I'm going to get through this fucking length of the subject.

[01:02:18] By the time they get to this one, I'll be retired.

[01:02:21] Well, Ryan, thank you.

[01:02:22] We will get this up shortly.

[01:02:25] And yeah, I hope you enjoy the rest of your time in New York.

[01:02:28] How can people find you, Chris?

[01:02:29] Where can they subscribe on Instagram and Facebook?

[01:02:32] I don't know.

[01:02:33] I'm on SoundCloud, Canadian Pimball and Canada Pimball.

[01:02:36] How can you learn to update your Facebook page, Chris?

[01:02:38] Do you want me to, do you think I should?

[01:02:39] You got to build a community.

[01:02:40] You got to build a community.

[01:02:41] You want to, you want to, you want to keep those.

[01:02:43] Right now.

[01:02:44] Ryan, I don't even know me.

[01:02:45] Do you want to do Facebook page?

[01:02:46] Do you want me to do anything?

[01:02:47] Do you guys do Facebook?

[01:02:48] Yeah.

[01:02:49] Do you guys update frequently?

[01:02:50] Do you talk to people actually?

[01:02:51] Yeah, Jenny, Jenny, that was like take pictures of everything and post it up and give

[01:02:56] you a free Pimball machine.

[01:02:57] No, we do.

[01:02:58] That's it.

[01:02:59] There's no one ordering dialed in.

[01:03:02] Wait.

[01:03:03] Oh no.

[01:03:04] He's on Instagram, we just also don't use it.

[01:03:06] Instagram is Chris or Canada, but there's two different people, right?

[01:03:09] I think it's Canada, come on.

[01:03:10] Canada is my...

[01:03:11] There's Chris ever, like, he's ever done a podcast as Canada, like the art soul guy, right?

[01:03:15] And they've not been able to switch off.

[01:03:18] You mean when he gets off of it?

[01:03:19] There are times he gets into character before and I actually like stand back because he's

[01:03:24] like thinking about what he wants to do.

[01:03:25] What does it do to you?

[01:03:26] It's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[01:03:27] It's like when the old likes prepare for a match, right?

[01:03:32] But instead of that, it's like mental.

[01:03:34] Yeah, so Brett is using her rugby terminology, which nobody probably knows.

[01:03:40] I bet more people than you wouldn't just pay with it.

[01:03:43] You've got a lot of Australian and he's on list.

[01:03:45] Yeah, I wrote a name.

[01:03:47] Who's the moderator on Aussie Arcade form who booted me?

[01:03:50] What's his name?

[01:03:51] No, no point in calling it me.

[01:03:53] But you know who he is.

[01:03:55] Arcade King?

[01:03:56] Okay.

[01:03:57] That's his Travis puzzle.

[01:03:58] Is he?

[01:03:59] Okay.

[01:04:00] Travis Fairpager, good man, you're so good.

[01:04:01] It was funny that he'd be like, hey, keep booting it like off for good.

[01:04:04] Think about it Grace, you're on the podcast, right?

[01:04:06] So when you, when someone emails you and they're upset or they're annoying you, they're

[01:04:10] trolling you, you can just delete it, right?

[01:04:11] We can respond and say, if you, if you own the forum and people are doing nothing but

[01:04:17] trolling, right?

[01:04:18] And then it becomes work and how much money you're making off this forum, how the anything,

[01:04:23] you're going to have a real life job.

[01:04:24] Right.

[01:04:25] So when people start missing you, you're in real life and saying, hey, you've got to get

[01:04:27] this can hang out with the forum because he's upsetting people and they just spent $12,000

[01:04:31] and they kind of thought this game and they're buying it and he's doing nothing but upset

[01:04:34] them.

[01:04:35] What are you going to do?

[01:04:36] You're going to be like, oh, we'll just deal with it because, right?

[01:04:38] Yeah, yeah.

[01:04:39] There she is.

[01:04:40] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:04:41] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:04:43] it's annoying.

[01:04:44] It's funny that Mike at home can get like, booed it.

[01:04:47] He didn't get booed and he asked for his account to get deleted.

[01:04:50] Do you want to tell the story quickly?

[01:04:51] I don't know the story.

[01:04:53] You started it already.

[01:04:54] Okay, so when did you start it at all?

[01:04:58] When we were at lunch, I was telling you the story that I don't want to be in debt.

[01:05:02] Like, people own your money, I don't like people, me only in their money.

[01:05:07] So someone owed me some money for somebody.

[01:05:09] Somebody that they picked up or somebody knew.

[01:05:11] And I just wanted to get all my ducks who not before I went overseas and he hadn't paid

[01:05:15] me.

[01:05:16] So I reminded him, he's like, yeah, you remind me, I'll pay you.

[01:05:20] I'm like, when?

[01:05:21] He's like, I'll pay you.

[01:05:22] And then he just, and this guy has the money to do it.

[01:05:24] So he didn't pay me, he didn't pay me.

[01:05:26] And it kind of drove me crazy because he was, he was trolling.

[01:05:29] He was doing what you do on the forums, but it was with money.

[01:05:31] And for me, you don't do that.

[01:05:33] And I didn't want to drag on the money involved in the US.

[01:05:36] I just want to relax, right?

[01:05:37] So I kind of called him out on the forums, but I didn't mention his name.

[01:05:40] I'm like, it's right, it's RTIK member and he's not paying me and magically he paid me.

[01:05:46] But it was a long RTIK thread and Mike chimed in and he said something to the effect of

[01:05:52] new people in the forum.

[01:05:54] It wasn't referring to me.

[01:05:55] New people in the forum don't hold as much power as the people that are being on for a while.

[01:06:00] And then everyone kind of started to attack Mike and said, that's the kind of what forum

[01:06:03] cancer that makes places horrible.

[01:06:05] Exactly.

[01:06:06] You want to grow something or do you want to do something?

[01:06:09] Nothing to do with Mike, which sounds like a typical thread and Mike would jump into

[01:06:12] the place.

[01:06:13] Exactly.

[01:06:14] People didn't really agree with Mike and then Mike asked Travis to lay his account and then

[01:06:21] he's back on Pinsons.

[01:06:22] Right.

[01:06:23] Which he said he was not coming back to.

[01:06:25] Exactly.

[01:06:26] He's got no word left to say.

[01:06:27] This is like me.

[01:06:28] Chris, Chris, how many times have you said you've been having your final episode and you've

[01:06:32] come back?

[01:06:33] Mike?

[01:06:34] I've never had a solution.

[01:06:35] He's deleted them all.

[01:06:36] They've never happened.

[01:06:37] Mike and I should create our own forum called there's no word left to go.com.

[01:06:41] This is not a lie.

[01:06:42] This is not a lie.

[01:06:43] This is not a lie.

[01:06:44] This is not a lie.

[01:06:45] We're not going to go.

[01:06:46] We both have a...

[01:06:47] You'd be a Noah's ox anyway.

[01:06:48] Right.

[01:06:49] You'd be a Noah's ox anyway.

[01:06:50] You'd be a good man.

[01:06:51] And only us can like, we're the only two members of the forum just arguing with each other.

[01:06:55] Well, look, good job on that one.

[01:06:58] Maybe you can get him off of Pinsons.

[01:07:00] Are you going to buy...

[01:07:01] Yeah, so it's Australia.

[01:07:03] What's the word on home pin and Thunderbirds?

[01:07:05] Like our people are excited because that title is meant for you guys.

[01:07:08] No one in America knows what Thunderbirds is.

[01:07:10] Well, yeah.

[01:07:11] I think people thought...

[01:07:12] You know what Thunderbirds is?

[01:07:13] Yeah, if I can grow up with that fish.

[01:07:14] Well, yeah.

[01:07:15] Well, the Irish.

[01:07:16] You guys get the leftover content for most of the...

[01:07:17] So it's not a lie.

[01:07:18] Everyone is talking about...

[01:07:19] I thought it was actually an American show.

[01:07:20] It's an European show.

[01:07:21] Right.

[01:07:22] We should look at those.

[01:07:23] It's part of the cum-lums.

[01:07:24] Everyone that was...

[01:07:25] Okay.

[01:07:26] So you both...

[01:07:27] Well, you guys meant that then.

[01:07:28] Yeah.

[01:07:29] Gaming and G.I. Joe and Transformers.

[01:07:31] M...Yes.

[01:07:32] We don't want g-m-un, forgotten.

[01:07:33] Oh, okay.

[01:07:34] I've got a lot of friends that are in on Thunderbirds and...

[01:07:36] It's a given like a monter95 kind of situation.

[01:07:38] So, I guess I just have to get the game.

[01:07:40] And it was cheap enough.

[01:07:41] I don't think this is not like some 600 thousand Euro solar pop a Duke.

[01:07:45] It was five thousand four hundred Australian dollars.

[01:07:49] So that equies it 4 1-0-1-5 grand.

[01:07:52] So, if the game isn't that good,

[01:07:54] then I guess people sell it,

[01:07:55] and that is a bit money,

[01:07:56] and that's it. But by all accounts from people that I talk to, it isn't the world's worst game,

[01:08:02] but it's not up to the kind of standard you expect from a stone pro or anything else people

[01:08:06] are producing. But it isn't out yet. We'll see where it goes. No one's really played the

[01:08:10] new one yet. I know he made some changes. As we said before, there's so many games coming out, so

[01:08:15] you don't necessarily need to be excited by everyone. And if a game isn't that good, then it can

[01:08:20] just not be good. You don't need to hop on about it, right? No, that's what I do. What else would I

[01:08:24] talk about? Is this glass here that I'm drinking? Is it half empty or half full? It's half empty.

[01:08:31] It's half full, isn't it? Right. It's not even half full. I don't know.

[01:08:36] Chris is right. It's about like 20 pz.

[01:08:40] All right, guys. Well, I hope you enjoyed this impromptu podcast. That was episode 219. Ryan,

[01:08:46] thank you. Brenda, thank you for kind of joining this episode. You're welcome.

[01:08:51] We're going to I think I'm going to go to sunshine tonight with Ryan later. We'll see if anyone

[01:08:56] even shows up. It might be a canceled lead night, but maybe we can go see the demon because it's

[01:09:00] in that neighborhood. I'm very I'm very excited by Cal's career. So I just love cars.

[01:09:05] Yeah, friends. Let me great. I'm going to go look at it. Look at it. Take it out. He's petrified.

[01:09:10] I'll be always sitting in the car. I'll take a big lift.

[01:09:16] Smells three times better than George.

[01:09:17] George, I miss him. Four times as fast as I can. All right, guys.

[01:09:22] Later.
