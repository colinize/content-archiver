[00:00] Take the fire out, shake it out, break the love, break it up.

[00:10] Welcome to the public, in the name of love.

[00:15] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:20] Ah, in the name of love, that's why I do Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:24] It is three o'clock in the morning.

[00:26] And because I love doing this show so much, I am inside, this is the first time ever, I

[00:32] am inside the Toyota, inside the garage, because I don't want to wake up, Killian and Kassin,

[00:40] who are sleeping above me, and the ceiling is not that thick.

[00:44] So everybody, I just want to say, I love doing this show so much, and it's been a rough 24

[00:52] hours for me.

[00:53] You know, a lot of it just comes down to a real awakening inside my mind about why

[00:59] I do this show, and it was never really for the awards.

[01:02] It was always for the fans, and it was always to prove a point that you can't silence this

[01:11] kind of way to look at this hobby we love.

[01:15] I think people forget, when I started this show, there were no awards.

[01:21] There was really just Pinside, there was like a couple websites, and there was like five

[01:28] podcasts, and that was it.

[01:31] Fast forward to 2025.

[01:33] We've got 28 podcasts.

[01:36] We've got like 89 content creators.

[01:39] We've got Stern advertising all throughout the show this weekend, and we've got so much

[01:46] more happening.

[01:48] It is a golden age of this hobby.

[01:51] There are more games out there to talk about.

[01:54] There are more companies putting in the hard effort to make games.

[01:59] There are more men and women around the world that are working around the clock to make

[02:05] pinball magic happen.

[02:07] The prices are crazy.

[02:09] I know, I heard from some of you, you're like, Canada, to make the show better.

[02:14] Don't talk about prices so much.

[02:16] Look, it's unavoidable.

[02:18] We're still going to talk about prices, but I do agree.

[02:21] I think we can talk about more stuff every once in a while for sure, especially with

[02:26] the amount of shows that I put up.

[02:28] Now look, I just want to say this, and then I don't really want to talk about it again.

[02:32] First and foremost, I reached out to Kale, and I congratulated Electric Bat on winning.

[02:38] They won within the system that was in place.

[02:42] Even though I got almost 100 more first place votes.

[02:46] This was always the reason why they implemented the waiting score system, but that was what

[02:53] we knew going in.

[02:55] We didn't even get 300 votes though, people.

[02:58] I mean, I've got 700 subscribers, and we didn't even get 300 first place votes.

[03:04] To put this in context, in 2022, the last time I won the Twippy, we got over 600 votes

[03:12] for first place.

[03:14] It's interesting, because you could say, oh well, people just don't care about the Twippies,

[03:18] but it looks like they got more votes overall.

[03:21] I just think it was a series of factors.

[03:23] Because every single podcaster was listed, those shows are going to get more votes.

[03:28] In the past, it was right in the show you want to vote for, and I think that was laborious

[03:33] so people didn't really do it, and they just went with familiar names.

[03:38] Seeing those results does make me feel a little bit better about the way I reacted.

[03:43] I'll tell you this, I'm a human being, and I will react the way I want to react, and

[03:48] I will do my show when I want to do my show.

[03:51] I love the internet, it's easy, everybody's always got an opinion on how you should behave.

[03:57] I have opinions on how companies should behave.

[04:00] It's just what we do, so you've got to be able to take it all.

[04:04] In the end, all that glitters is not gold.

[04:08] The reason I do this show is not for a Twippy.

[04:11] The reason I do this show is for the fans, it's for my family that supports me all these

[04:16] years, it's for everybody that spends some of their hard earned money to get this pinball

[04:21] podcast product, and that's why I always want it so badly.

[04:26] When you hear my speeches over the years, it's always about the fans and what this hobby

[04:30] has brought each and every one of us.

[04:32] You know, I'd rather have 700 plus subscribers, that number is the most important to me, and

[04:38] it reminds me.

[04:39] It reminds me.

[04:40] I'd rather have that, and I'd rather have the best support, the most commitment, the

[04:45] most loyalty in all of pinball, the best friendships I've made in all of pinball.

[04:51] This crazy community we've created in all of pinball, all of that is much more valuable

[04:57] than a $5 trophy and 300 votes out of thousands of people that enjoy Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[05:04] Now look, it's going to get a little bit harder for some of those people who have been on the

[05:08] ride for free.

[05:10] I took down Facebook, and I don't foresee myself putting it back up because I'm just

[05:14] tired and it's not just the page itself and doing all that stuff there.

[05:18] The reason why I took down Facebook is I'm just tired of all of it.

[05:22] I wake up and it's a barrage of content.

[05:25] It's not just my pinball page, it's like every time I go on there.

[05:29] It's like I'm just tired of being fed by the algorithm, all the things I don't have.

[05:35] All the watches and cars and pinball machines and arcade machines and everybody's talking,

[05:39] it's everything louder than everything else.

[05:42] And I'm tired.

[05:43] And yes, I was extremely tired Saturday night after all of the hard work I put into this

[05:49] show.

[05:50] But you know what?

[05:51] It's over.

[05:52] And I don't want you guys to keep talking about it.

[05:54] This is the last time I'll talk about it.

[05:56] I spoke to Colin, I spoke to Ian, and I'm moving on.

[05:59] And it is what it is, everybody.

[06:01] But here's the thing.

[06:02] My commitment to each and every one of you is to keep doing this show, doing it multiple

[06:07] times a week, although I am having my hernia surgery on Friday.

[06:11] So give me a few days to recover.

[06:13] The good news is it doesn't require Canada lifting anything more than 10 pounds and it

[06:19] doesn't require any physical activity, any physical activity to make Canada's pinball

[06:24] podcast.

[06:25] Okay, so let's start this 3 AM show with a bit of news, a bit of news that I'm going

[06:30] to confirm for you right now.

[06:32] This is 100% a confirmation of something that's been floating around in the rumor mill.

[06:39] It's been on Naps Arcade, Jason.

[06:42] Congratulations on your victory.

[06:44] Congratulations Johnna Jackbar, who didn't even know the award show was going on.

[06:48] Hey, here's the thing.

[06:50] This has been out there and I just want to confirm that it is not happening.

[06:55] There is no The Walking Dead remake being worked on by John Borg and by Stern Pinball.

[07:04] So that gets really interesting.

[07:08] Maybe The Walking Dead is codename for Ghostbusters remake.

[07:12] All I know is this.

[07:13] Tron is being worked on.

[07:15] I also know that where Stern Pinball is at.

[07:20] Here's the vibe over there and I'm talking to people who work over there.

[07:25] The vibe is simply this.

[07:28] We need a hit.

[07:30] Like they really need a hit.

[07:33] Is D&D that hit game?

[07:35] I think D&D is doing alright, but it is not what this company is used to.

[07:42] You have to remember, they are used to like juggernaut sales with stuff like Ghostbusters

[07:49] and Star Wars.

[07:50] I still think Star Wars, even though I can't stand the pin, it is still probably the best

[07:56] selling Stern machine of all time.

[07:59] And that's the thing.

[08:00] It's like when you really, really do think about where Stern was at theme wise years ago.

[08:07] They haven't really had a juggernaut theme and they still don't.

[08:13] The King Kong is not a juggernaut triple A theme.

[08:19] Venom was not.

[08:20] John Wick was not.

[08:22] James Bond maybe, but not really.

[08:25] You go 1960s James Bond?

[08:28] I mean that's not really where it's at.

[08:32] When I think about juggernaut themes, I think about stuff like Star Wars, stuff like Back

[08:39] to the Future, stuff like Die Hard, stuff like The Matrix, Top Gun.

[08:46] I'm trying to think about movie properties that last like 25 years and it gets a little

[08:51] bit more difficult and the reason why is this is because of our age.

[08:56] Like all of us, we long for things that have stood the test of time and unfortunately once

[09:03] we lost decades, we lost a lot of like love for things.

[09:08] And I mean that and what I mean by that is this.

[09:11] Remember there used to be decades, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, the 90s.

[09:16] After that, when we used to group things during those like 10 year spans of time and also

[09:22] remember all of that and I think the reason why everything from the decades we think of

[09:27] so fondly is there was no internet.

[09:31] Like when a movie came out and you loved it, you went back to the theater six times to

[09:36] see it.

[09:37] You watched it on a VHS tape over and over and over again and for some of you out there

[09:43] you remember what I'm about to say.

[09:46] You went to Blockbuster and you wanted to rent it and they were all gone.

[09:52] And think about what that just does to you when you're younger.

[09:55] This thing is in so much demand and there's no more left here for me to watch it tonight.

[10:02] We had to go through life and sometimes not get access to the content we wanted so that

[10:09] in the moment in which we got access to that content, we were like on cloud nine.

[10:17] That feeling is gone.

[10:19] The world is over saturated.

[10:21] Have you ever seen, do you ever go on like Netflix and Paramount Plus and Peacock and

[10:26] just keep scrolling tens of thousands of pieces of content coming at you to the point

[10:34] where you don't want to watch any of it?

[10:36] I mean think about it.

[10:37] It's crazy, right?

[10:38] You go onto these platforms and there's only like one or two new shows you really want

[10:43] to check out.

[10:44] The rest of it is just noise.

[10:46] And so that is why the stuff that we still have so much affinity for comes from those

[10:52] decades.

[10:53] Star Wars, Batman, Pee Wee's Big Adventure.

[10:57] We just saw that beautiful mocked up cabinet by Mr. Christopher Franchi.

[11:02] It is gorgeous.

[11:04] And of course everybody would love Pee Wee's Big Adventure Pinball Machine.

[11:08] And the reason why is the movie is so campy.

[11:12] It's so fun.

[11:13] And the other thing I love about Pee Wee, it's such a visual world.

[11:17] If you made a pinball machine based on that visual world and you could see it in the

[11:22] cabinet, it would be incredible.

[11:26] The other thing I love about Pee Wee's Big Adventure is it's one movie.

[11:30] It's like an hour and a half at most.

[11:33] There's like a beginning, a middle and an end.

[11:36] It's a perfect story.

[11:39] It has everything that makes a story perfect and magical and it's not too much.

[11:45] And you could chop it up into different modes, different experiences.

[11:51] You know you could have the clown with the chains around him rotating.

[11:56] You know you could have Pee Wee's basement where they go and they try to uncover the

[12:00] mystery of who stole his bike.

[12:03] You could have Francis.

[12:04] I know you are, but what am I?

[12:06] Every time you hit the pop bumpers, there's a mode.

[12:08] I know you are, but what am I?

[12:09] You know you got to get to the Alamo.

[12:11] It's all right there.

[12:13] It's all right there.

[12:15] And I think about the Rube Goldberg Machine when he's making breakfast.

[12:18] You could figure out a way to make that into the pinball machine in a world under glass

[12:24] in a mechanical way everybody.

[12:26] But here's the thing.

[12:28] You know you could think about Pee Wee's Big Adventure and then you think about John Wick

[12:32] and you feel numb.

[12:33] You think about Avatar and you feel numb.

[12:36] You think about Venom and you feel numb.

[12:38] And I just am asking all these pinball companies stop picking themes that don't have that level

[12:45] of affinity and excitement.

[12:47] And I know it's hard.

[12:48] Because on paper, stuff like Avatar seems perfect, but they missed it.

[12:52] They missed it.

[12:53] There's no real affinity and love affair.

[12:55] And so as we look at this year coming up, it's going to get really interesting.

[13:00] And the reason why Stern needs a hit is you know, King Kong, we'll see.

[13:05] My worry about King Kong, and I've been thinking about it a lot recently.

[13:08] My worry about Kong is what's going to be on the screen.

[13:14] Godzilla worked so well because Godzilla is campy.

[13:19] There's a guy inside a rubber suit and Godzilla is fun.

[13:23] It doesn't take itself too seriously.

[13:26] King Kong is 100% the opposite.

[13:30] There's no guy inside a gorilla costume.

[13:33] It's not campy fun.

[13:35] It takes itself very seriously.

[13:38] It is a sad and depressing story when you think about it.

[13:43] They rob Kong from his island.

[13:46] They bring him to New York City to parade him around for money as a circus side show freak.

[13:53] And he climbs the building because it reminds him of home and he gets killed.

[13:59] Think about it.

[14:00] Godzilla never dies.

[14:02] When you watch Godzilla, he always survives at the end and comes back.

[14:07] When you watch King Kong, he falls like 80 stories to his death and is bleeding on the

[14:14] ground and he dies.

[14:17] And so what are they going to do?

[14:19] Are they going to make it Skull Island where you're just battling the big creatures on

[14:24] the island?

[14:25] And maybe so, but here's my thing is how many of you feel strongly about that?

[14:31] And I'm worried then if it is that, is it going to be from the recent King Kong movies?

[14:37] Again, none of us have a really strong affinity for those films.

[14:42] So I don't know how that's going to work or are they going to go another direction with

[14:46] it?

[14:47] Are they going to illustrate and animate the Skull Island moments a la Jurassic Park?

[14:54] But again, it's not going to work as well Jurassic Park because we've seen it so many

[14:59] times.

[15:00] I mean, think about it like this.

[15:01] When that Jurassic Park theme song hits.

[15:06] That's what wakes up in you.

[15:09] The inner child that loves Jurassic Park so much.

[15:13] There's something about that John Williams song.

[15:16] The same way John Williams did it with Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

[15:21] The moment that theme song hits when you hit the start button, they won.

[15:26] It is like I'm in it.

[15:28] Even though you're going to animate it and it's not movie clips, it doesn't matter.

[15:33] It teleports you to the world of Jurassic Park.

[15:38] You can't do that in King Kong.

[15:40] Is there even a King Kong theme song?

[15:42] I'm sure there is and I'm sure you don't even know what it is.

[15:47] And so that is why King Kong does have a tall building to climb to become the next huge

[15:54] hit from the Stern Pinball.

[15:56] But here's the thing.

[15:57] If anybody can do it, it's Keith Elwin.

[16:00] If I told you right now, King Kong is being worked on by Brian Eddy, would you be so

[16:07] excited?

[16:08] If I told you it was George Gomez, would you have faith?

[16:10] Maybe.

[16:11] Maybe.

[16:12] But Keith Elwin is their guy.

[16:14] So when Stern Pinball says they need a huge hit, there really is only one guy right now

[16:19] that's been delivering huge hits for Stern Pinball.

[16:23] Now how much more excited would you be if we all knew Keith Elwin was making back to the

[16:29] future?

[16:30] The game has not been shifted over to Stern Pinball.

[16:37] The game is in development by Barry over at Touch Pinball.

[16:41] I know that just makes us a little bummed out and wondering what are they going to do.

[16:45] I also did hear though that there's a lot of interesting stuff in the game and I think

[16:50] Barry wants to create another moment the way he did when he ushered out the big Lebowski

[16:57] into the world.

[16:58] The thing that Barry needs to remember because I've talked to people who saw the cabinet

[17:02] artwork on Back to the Future and it is just like the cabinet on the big Lebowski where

[17:08] it was absolutely plain with just the logo on it.

[17:12] And Barry, maybe 12 years ago that worked, it doesn't work anymore.

[17:18] You gotta go further.

[17:20] You gotta up the game because all of Pinball has upped its game and look at how beautiful

[17:26] like a Spooky Pinball machine is when the big Lebowski launched.

[17:31] Spooky Pinball was making America's most haunted.

[17:33] Remember, go back and look at that.

[17:36] And now look at where Spooky Pinball is.

[17:38] Evil Dead is one of the most beautiful and stunning pinball machines we've ever seen.

[17:43] I can't wait for these guys to make Beetlejuice but it is.

[17:46] And I'm happy to see them almost sell out of Evil Dead Pinball.

[17:50] But man, looking at it, it's absolutely stunning.

[17:52] You know, so Stern Pass is on Back to the Future.

[17:55] Dutch Pinball is gonna make it but they're not gonna be able to fulfill orders.

[17:58] They're gonna be making it for eight years.

[18:00] We're still delayed on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and here we are.

[18:05] It's almost March and not a single game has gone out the door.

[18:09] It's okay.

[18:10] They only need to sell 500 right now currently in development which will be the next game

[18:15] from DPX is a game you are familiar with.

[18:18] It is another return of J-Pop.

[18:21] Melvin, my friend, is on a mission to make these games viable and ownable in a way that

[18:27] works and he is working on Retro Atomic Zombie Adventureland as the next game from Dutch Pinball X.

[18:34] Now what's gonna be interesting is this.

[18:36] I think there's gonna be a little bit of a race that goes on.

[18:40] I think over the next year, because the game has already been developed and coded, he's

[18:46] making changes to the layout, just slight changes so everything works.

[18:50] Remember, when you look at the old Raza stream, people couldn't make it up the ramp.

[18:55] He's fixing all of that.

[18:56] The code is done but he's gonna remove the pin bar.

[19:00] Now what's interesting is he's gonna have to use the wide screen that is on the Raza

[19:06] Deeproot game.

[19:08] That's gonna have to be utilized into the back box of the new version because it was coded

[19:14] that way.

[19:15] Like you'd have to redo everything.

[19:17] You might as well just use what they created because they spent so much damn money on it.

[19:22] It'd be stupid not to.

[19:23] I think Raza could be developed and ready to go before back to the future and that's

[19:29] what's gonna be interesting.

[19:31] If we get to the end of this year and they're almost done with all the Owl-less builds and

[19:36] back to the future is not ready yet, does that mean that Raza will sneak in?

[19:41] Now I also know that if they do Raza, they're not doing 500.

[19:45] I think that Melvin wisely wants to create more of a demand and less of a supply.

[19:52] You know for you newbies out there, you forget.

[19:54] The whole reason Jaypop had all these people banging down his door.

[19:59] When he announced he was gonna make Magic Girl, he said he was only making 16 of them.

[20:05] 16!

[20:07] Not 1600.

[20:08] 16.

[20:09] Here's what's crazy.

[20:10] He was only making 16 and he was charging, I wanna say what, $16,000 for the game or

[20:17] something like that?

[20:19] Nowadays, we're being sold 1000 CEs for 15,000 a pop.

[20:26] Nothing rare about those games and look how expensive they are.

[20:29] So we need a hit game, right?

[20:30] We need a hit game.

[20:32] To me, when I hear stuff like Stern really knows they need a hit, I don't think Kong is

[20:38] gonna have that universal appeal that everybody thinks.

[20:42] I think it will appeal to Keith Elwyn enthusiasts and there's a lot of them.

[20:47] It obviously will appeal to pinball lovers.

[20:50] I don't think they'll sell half as many King Kongs as they sold of Star Wars.

[20:56] It's crazy that they're not just bringing back Ghostbusters and fixing some of the issues

[21:00] on that game.

[21:02] When I look at Ghostbusters now, in comparison to these recent Stern games, I still think

[21:08] it's Zambietti's best art package on a Stern machine.

[21:12] He's done some incredible work.

[21:14] It's just something about it, the colors of it and he used a really creative approach

[21:19] to it but it's just so colorful, so lively.

[21:24] I love it so much.

[21:25] The one thing I don't love about Ghostbusters is the pro and premium cabinets.

[21:30] They just look too similar.

[21:33] He wouldn't do that again.

[21:35] The Slimer version is amazing.

[21:38] I think it's the first time ever I've seen an artist actually design the art.

[21:43] To take into consideration, there's gonna be side railings on the game.

[21:48] The lollipop rails are designed so the artworks around them.

[21:54] Like normally on every game I see, I hate this.

[21:56] They design the artwork and then they slap these big side armors on the game and it blocks

[22:02] the artwork.

[22:03] It looks bad on D&D.

[22:05] It looks bad on John Wick.

[22:06] I don't understand that.

[22:08] If you know your Ellie is gonna have this side armor that takes up this space, why don't

[22:16] you design the art taking that into consideration?

[22:20] I think Franchi takes it into consideration now with his Evil Dead games and the games

[22:24] he does.

[22:25] It just makes sense.

[22:27] It looks bad.

[22:28] It just looks aesthetically bad.

[22:30] So the game that is the biggest question mark of the year.

[22:34] It's not Barrels of Fun's next game which is gonna come out anytime soon.

[22:38] I know they did a tour this weekend and people are telling me like, oh they made people sign

[22:43] an NDA this, this, this and that and I'm like, well I don't think they showed people though

[22:48] and told them what their next theme is and knowing David Van S.

[22:53] There's no way they did.

[22:54] This company is built on keeping secrets and if they brought people into a room even if

[23:01] you signed an NDA and they showed them, hey it's Dune or G.I. Joe, how would you ever prevent

[23:09] the people who saw it from just calling up their buddies and telling them or calling

[23:14] up Canada?

[23:15] You'd never be able to trace it back to them and enforce it.

[23:19] The only thing to be able to do is like, one of you did it.

[23:21] That's all you'd be able to do is one of you spilled the beans.

[23:24] Why would they even put themselves in that position?

[23:27] They did not share the theme.

[23:29] I love the fact that it is like basically either G.I. Joe or Dune.

[23:35] What's funny is it could just be something else that nobody's throwing into the rumor

[23:39] mail but it probably is one of those two themes and I think the majority of us, back to my

[23:46] thing about the 80s, back to my thing about what's stuff when you hear the theme song,

[23:53] when you see the artwork, when you hear the phrase like yo Joe, when you hear the phrase

[23:59] like G.I. Joe great American hero especially in the modern day of America where it's now

[24:04] the Gulf of America and everybody else is not American.

[24:08] Bringing out G.I. Joe Pimble in today's day and age is probably a much better idea than

[24:15] bringing out the melodramatic, sappy, not much fun, sci-fi Dune.

[24:21] Dune is no Star Wars.

[24:23] It's not, it's okay but again do you want to own something from the Dune world?

[24:31] Are there Dune collectors out there?

[24:33] So I'm hoping it's G.I. Joe and here's where it gets really fun.

[24:37] I feel like whatever Barrels does, it doesn't even matter what it is.

[24:41] Whatever they do is going to be an appetizer on a three course meal that is going to be

[24:49] so much fun over the next few months.

[24:51] So thank you for being here because we're going to cover it over the next four months

[24:54] but here's the three course meal.

[24:56] The appetizer is going to be Barrels of Fun and it's going to be I think G.I. Joe.

[25:03] Then we're going to get the next course which is Harry Potter from Jersey Jack Pimble and

[25:08] then we're going to get King Kong from Stern sometime in April May.

[25:13] So it's going to be bonkers.

[25:15] I think we're going to see Barrels of Fun in April.

[25:18] I think we're going to see Harry Potter in April and I think we're going to see King

[25:23] Kong in May.

[25:25] I think that's how it's going to shake out.

[25:28] I don't think any of these companies care about like needing it ready by a show.

[25:33] So for all of you out there being like it's going to be T.P.F.

[25:35] It's going to be fantastic.

[25:37] It's going to be MGC.

[25:38] I think it's going to be neither of all those things.

[25:41] Yes, if the games are revealed before those shows they will most likely show up but for

[25:46] the most part they're not going to launch it at any of these shows.

[25:50] So let's talk about Harry Potter real quickly.

[25:53] We all know it's Harry Potter.

[25:55] I mean I've spoken to someone who's seen the Harry Potter game.

[25:59] He was showed it by someone who's working on it at Expo this past year and Harry Potter

[26:06] is going to be one of those really interesting games because as a property it is Star Wars

[26:12] like in its size and its cultural impact.

[26:16] There are some pinheads who don't care.

[26:19] There are some pinheads who can't wait but regardless of which side you are on this

[26:25] game is going to have all of the attention.

[26:28] I mean it all of the attention because this is the biggest theme that Jersey Jack pinball

[26:34] has ever had.

[26:36] And if you talk about a company who needs a hit way more than Stern pinball needs a

[26:41] hit it is Jersey Jack pinball.

[26:43] And the reason why is Jersey Jack hasn't had many hits.

[26:47] Stern pinball has had many many hits and they can just keep remaking those hits and that's

[26:52] good enough to keep the lights on even if they do kill the collector market which they

[26:56] are going to do which they have done people.

[26:59] I mean look when a dude is selling to Stern E.S. and losing $10,000 you've killed your

[27:06] collector market it's over.

[27:09] But Jersey Jack needs a hit.

[27:12] Right now they are trying to sell like GNRLE is living let by for 9 grand.

[27:17] In opened up GNRLE is $6,000 all day long.

[27:22] So they need a hit and they need a game that finally puts all of the pieces together and

[27:30] what I mean by that is they need to put together the old JJP that really put a lot more into

[27:40] the games.

[27:41] They need to blend together old JJP with newer JJP which has more polish.

[27:48] It does like the newer JJP games I think they have more polish like if you put in Elton

[27:53] John next to a Wizard of Oz like it makes Wizard of Oz look a little sluggish look a

[27:58] little dated.

[28:00] But Wizard of Oz is packed with so many toys and Elton John is empty but Elton John is

[28:05] a much better shooter right.

[28:07] So I think what everybody is looking for from this game first and foremost is we want a

[28:11] game that's really fun to shoot.

[28:13] I can say this as someone who owns Guns N Roses is like man it's just not that fun to

[28:18] shoot.

[28:19] It really isn't.

[28:20] The experiential stuff is great but you can almost enjoy what the game does best just by

[28:25] putting the game in jukebox mode and not even playing pinball.

[28:29] So we want the game to shoot really well.

[28:31] We want Eric to give us a layout that is fun to go back to time and time again.

[28:37] We want them to put toys in the game.

[28:40] Yes you cannot be spending 12 to 15 thousand dollars on a game that doesn't have a lot

[28:47] of fun toys in it.

[28:49] And Harry Potter demands fun toys and magical things the ball needs to do.

[28:54] I mean that's it for me.

[28:55] It's a pin about magic.

[28:57] And if the ball doesn't do some magical things then what are we doing making this game.

[29:02] And if I were them you know where I would go for inspiration.

[29:05] I would go to the games that had the ball do magical things like Dracula like Tales of

[29:12] the Arabian Knights like Theater of Magic like go look at the games where it actually

[29:18] took a physical pinball and it did something magical with the ball.

[29:25] If they didn't do that or they didn't create similar things that make the ball do magical

[29:31] things then I don't know why we're here making pinball machines if you're them.

[29:38] And then it's all going to come down to you.

[29:39] I mean the big question mark around Harry Potter you know this is what's really on my

[29:44] mind it's how they integrate the theme.

[29:48] Is it going to be the first three movies only.

[29:50] Is it going to be all of the movies.

[29:52] Are they going to have access to the movie scenes where when you see the scene you hear

[29:59] the actors and you hear their voices synced up with the clips.

[30:04] To me if this game has muted clips I really will just take my microphone and throw it

[30:11] in to the Gulf of Connecticut everybody.

[30:13] You can't do that.

[30:14] I can't understand why Jersey Jack thinks that's an enjoyable way to play pinball.

[30:19] Stern doesn't mute the clips.

[30:20] Godzilla doesn't mute the clips.

[30:22] It's doable.

[30:23] We know it's doable.

[30:25] Look at all those clips in Batman.

[30:27] Look at all the clips in Jaws.

[30:29] It doesn't get old.

[30:30] It doesn't get repetitive.

[30:32] It works.

[30:33] And look this is just going to be in a few months.

[30:36] I'm so happy.

[30:37] It's like talking about Back to the Future is boring because it's going to be over a

[30:40] year from now.

[30:41] And here's what I love about this hobby is you've got other stuff happening on the side.

[30:45] We still got all these companies.

[30:47] Cuphead's also going to come out sometime soon.

[30:50] I don't know when you release Cuphead.

[30:52] I heard it's American Pinball's best game to date.

[30:55] But again I just think it's going to come out when there's just so much more attention

[30:59] on other themes.

[31:01] And let's face it.

[31:02] Cuphead is not a take my money now theme at all.

[31:06] And I still hear that AP has the He-Man license.

[31:10] I don't think it's like the He-Man license you want to have.

[31:14] I think it's more of a lunchbox deal.

[31:16] But still it's better than Cuphead.

[31:19] And then after Kong.

[31:21] This is where it gets really interesting.

[31:23] So after Kong.

[31:24] So we're talking like as we head into later summer.

[31:28] What's around the corner then is where I'm also very curious.

[31:34] So what's next?

[31:36] Like what's next from Stern after King Kong.

[31:40] It's going to be a John Board game.

[31:43] It may be a remake first.

[31:45] It may not.

[31:46] I think it's going to be a new game from John Borg.

[31:50] Here's the thing we don't talk about.

[31:52] When you think about theme and what is historically going to come out.

[31:56] How do you not land on John Borg is working on a music pin.

[32:03] Think about it.

[32:04] When was the last time Stern had a music pin.

[32:09] I feel like we're due for a musical pin.

[32:12] Am I wrong.

[32:13] Wasn't it Foo Fighters.

[32:15] Like I don't think there's been a music pin since Foo Fighters.

[32:19] And that was like two years ago.

[32:21] I could see John Borg working on Journey.

[32:25] I would love it if it was Nirvana.

[32:27] It's not going to be that.

[32:29] What about Def Leppard.

[32:30] Right.

[32:31] What about Motley Crue.

[32:32] They usually don't go this long without a music pin.

[32:36] Now I forgot one right.

[32:37] You can hit it.

[32:38] What are you talking about.

[32:39] They just released Metallica Remastered.

[32:42] So yes we have to consider that kind of a brand new game for Stern pinball.

[32:48] So maybe it's not going to be a music pin right.

[32:50] Maybe it's not.

[32:51] And now that I think about it.

[32:52] Yes.

[32:53] Probably not because they just did Metallica.

[32:54] Canada where you been.

[32:56] You're in a fog.

[32:57] But we've heard rumors that Stern has Pokemon.

[33:01] Stern has Super Mario Brothers.

[33:04] I would love Jack Danger to make Super Mario Brothers over Pokemon.

[33:12] And I would love for him to have the retribution he deserves the revenge if you will.

[33:18] After all of the slings and arrows he's taken over X-Men.

[33:22] I don't ever want to see Jack have happened to him.

[33:26] What happened around X-Men.

[33:29] And he didn't deserve it.

[33:30] I mean the layout is still phenomenal.

[33:32] It's just a series of unfortunate things surrounding that layout and rushing that game

[33:38] to market and not having the right code support.

[33:42] They owe them.

[33:43] They basically owe him.

[33:45] After what he did with Foo Fighters and he showed us the potential of his games.

[33:50] They did him wrong on X-Men.

[33:52] And he's got no leverage with them.

[33:54] I mean it's like look it's his dream job.

[33:56] He's there.

[33:57] He's not leaving.

[33:58] They just owe him.

[33:59] And George is a good guy.

[34:00] They know what they did to him.

[34:02] They made his game suffer where Brian Eddy's game clearly got way more effort.

[34:07] And you know D&D's interesting right.

[34:09] It's out there right.

[34:10] It's out there.

[34:11] The Ellies are out there.

[34:12] Stern's got an Ellie motor kit fixed.

[34:15] Did you see this.

[34:16] You gotta have like five tools.

[34:18] And you replace the motor.

[34:20] Like that's interesting to me because everyone said it was the node board and maybe it was

[34:23] the motor frying the node board.

[34:25] But I love that people were like well it's just the zip ties are too tight.

[34:28] Now clearly if you're replacing the whole motor.

[34:32] Everything was wrong with the motor itself.

[34:33] You know shocking they didn't catch this.

[34:36] They might have made around like a thousand games before the fix was implemented.

[34:40] But D&D's interesting.

[34:41] It's brought up this big debate.

[34:43] Is the future of pinball saving your progress.

[34:47] Now for a game like D&D.

[34:49] Yes.

[34:50] But I don't think we're going to see this in other games.

[34:52] I think if pinball allows you to save your progress and allows you to start off where

[34:58] you left off.

[35:00] And it makes it much easier to beat your game or see the end of the game.

[35:06] They're never going to do it because if that happens more frequently not only does it not

[35:12] work for tournament play but the reason why they really won't do it because they don't

[35:15] care about tournament play when it comes to making this kind of money.

[35:18] The reason they won't do it is if you see the end of your game more often and there

[35:24] isn't like a reason to keep replaying it.

[35:26] It can make sense with D&D because you're leveling up characters and there's so much

[35:31] to do and explore and there's so many ways to randomize it.

[35:35] That's not true of every game.

[35:37] But the real reason is they just don't want you to beat the game a lot because if you

[35:40] beat the game a lot you're going to get bored of it.

[35:42] That's the way it works.

[35:43] Like that's what happens when you play a video game.

[35:46] You know you play Grand Theft Auto.

[35:48] You play it for hours.

[35:49] You start off where you left off.

[35:51] You go through the whole story mode.

[35:52] You beat the game and then you never play it again.

[35:55] If you get that feeling around a $60 video game they don't want you to have that feeling

[35:59] around a $6,000 to $13,000 pinball machine.

[36:03] They want you to keep striving to get to the end and on a three ball game they want it

[36:09] to be really challenging.

[36:12] Not too challenging.

[36:13] Just challenging enough to keep you coming back for more.

[36:17] So I do think that saving your progress in a game changes pinball completely.

[36:24] Makes it more like a video game and it would destroy pinball sales.

[36:29] It wouldn't help them.

[36:31] Alright everybody thank you.

[36:33] It is probably almost four in the morning.

[36:35] The whole family is sleeping.

[36:37] I just want to thank each and every one of you for your support.

[36:40] I want to thank those of you who actually went in.

[36:43] This meant the world to me.

[36:45] Some of you went in.

[36:46] About four or five of you.

[36:47] You went in after seeing how upset I was and you upped your subscription amount.

[36:54] I shared it with Brenda.

[36:55] I was feeling a little bummed out and it made me smile.

[36:59] I've heard from some of you personally and I want to thank each and every one of you

[37:04] for reaching out.

[37:05] Now trust me you hear it on this show.

[37:06] I'm not in this depressed knuckle dragging mood.

[37:11] I know I have what's valuable in life.

[37:14] I have my family.

[37:17] I have my health.

[37:18] I have a beautiful house.

[37:20] I have a great show.

[37:22] I have a great job.

[37:23] I have great fans.

[37:24] I have a great community that is always there for me.

[37:29] You know who you are at any hour of the day.

[37:33] If I just need to feel some human connection in a world that can make you feel lonely.

[37:39] The number one pandemic in the world that's facing young kids is loneliness.

[37:45] I never feel lonely because of the community that we've built.

[37:51] That is why what we've built together is way more valuable than some stupid award.

[37:59] It's way more valuable than a 12 to 15 thousand dollar pinball machine.

[38:04] It's way more valuable than the prices of these machines.

[38:07] It's just something money can't buy.

[38:10] Money can't buy any of this.

[38:12] This came through years of hard work creating this show.

[38:16] Years of hard work.

[38:18] Years of hours putting into this show to make it entertaining, weekend and week out.

[38:24] That's why I appreciate each and every one of you.

[38:28] That's why I would get frustrated like multi-millionaires won't even show five dollars support after

[38:34] all the work you do.

[38:36] They feel entitled to this stuff and they're paying Facebook.

[38:40] They're paying Netflix.

[38:42] They're paying Disney Plus.

[38:44] But when it comes to all the hard work one individual is doing.

[38:47] They don't lift a finger yet they'll spend tens of thousands of dollars flying around

[38:53] the world for every pinball show.

[38:56] That is why my focus is on each and every one of you.

[39:00] My focus is on my Patreon subscribers now.

[39:04] We're still going to do the Saturday morning spectacular.

[39:06] But it's going to go back to being the way it was.

[39:11] You are going to get a private link every Saturday morning at 10 a.m.

[39:16] And we're going to hop on YouTube and we're going to talk about pinball.

[39:20] I know that won't bring in as much of an audience but I don't care.

[39:27] As long as some of us are hanging out and we're talking pinball for 90 minutes.

[39:31] I don't care if I don't have as much reach out there in the pinball world.

[39:35] My focus is on you.

[39:37] It is on my family.

[39:39] It is on my job.

[39:40] And that makes me feel good.

[39:43] It makes me sleep well at night and it makes me wake up in a good mood.

[39:48] Those who hate me will always hate me.

[39:51] I know who they are.

[39:53] They listen to every single show and I'm living rent free in their heads.

[40:00] They could never do this.

[40:02] They don't have the charisma.

[40:03] They don't have the talent and they don't even put in the time.

[40:07] They've wasted their way typing away on pin side.

[40:11] It's a sad use of time.

[40:12] Have a great week.

[40:14] The world's second most favorite pinball podcast is back baby.

[40:19] Pour some sugar on me.
