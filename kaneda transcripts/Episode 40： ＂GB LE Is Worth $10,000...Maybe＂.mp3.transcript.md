[00:00] This painting here I bought it 10 years ago for $60,000. I could sell it today for 600. The illusion has become real and the more real it becomes

[00:11] The more desperate they want it.

[00:14] Capitalism as finest.

[00:16] Welcome, welcome, welcome to episode 40 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada coming at you. It's Wednesday, New York City. Beautiful day. I think it's gonna be like 85 and sunny. And I want to make another podcast and talk to you guys about a few things today. And what do we want to talk about today? We want to talk about ghost busters as well.

[00:46] What I should do with my ghost busters, Ellie, there's been a lot of conversation happening around these 500 limited editions of ghost busters. Let's talk about that for a little bit. Let's talk about what we think it's worth. Let's talk about what I should do. I want to reach some of your comments from people who are nice enough to send in emails saying what I should do. I'm going to reach some of those to you guys. After that, I want to talk a little bit about what I should do.

[01:16] The Hobbit. And I want to just make a plea to those out there that we do something when it comes to talking about the Hobbit moving forward. I think time has come for everyone to just simmer down and let's look at the Hobbit the right way. And finally on this episode, I can eat this pinball podcast. I want to talk about vault editions.

[01:41] And the conversation happening around vault editions and what we should do in that land of speculation that just never seems to die. So let's start with ghost busters, Ellie. And as many of you know, I put a deposit down on ghost busters, Ellie months ago. I think right when the ghost busters leaks started happening. I just put down $100 to get an Ellie. And at that time, distributors couldn't even confirm that ghost busters was the next Ellie.

[02:09] They simply would take my money and say you're in on the next Ellie, but they would never say ghost busters, but we all knew it was going to be ghost busters. He was with the conversation sounds like right now for those of you who missed out on ghost busters, Ellie's but really wanted one.

[02:27] He sure she's worth a $1,000,000. He asked that's right kid. You did it. You hit the mother love. You saw these cyber a million with your own eyes. And it's right there just inches away.

[02:38] So it is just inches. Well, maybe a few weeks away ghost busters Ellie is going to come out. And I just want to talk about a thread that went up that I think really

[02:50] works me and I'll say why because I think that people need to just accept the hobby they're in and realize they're in a collecting hobby right now with a lot of people with deep pockets.

[03:03] And when things are limited, that's going to increase the value. And it's just that simple. I don't know why people try to make so much sense of it all.

[03:10] This post happened by Clank KK or K Clank from Glenn Ellen Illinois and his thread is ghost busters Ellie bubble question mark exclamation exclamation point. Who is the sucker right. Wow, that's a dramatic title.

[03:29] Here's what he writes. It's amazing. There seems to be quite a few collectors buying more than one slot just so they can keep one for themselves and use the other slot to make money on by flipping their ghost busters Ellie slot to another inside insider collector for a hefty premium.

[03:47] I've spoken to multiple pinciders who have bought more than one slot and offered to sell me one of their slots and most of them want over 10 grand for a machine that hasn't even been made yet. So they are trying to dramatically inflate the price on this machine.

[04:00] So I'm actually get a little ornery with me because they feel they took this big risk because they bought more than one slot. It's hilarious. I'm cool with it. It's a free market.

[04:10] But I can also warn everybody out there to not buy from these pinciders. Don't be a sucker or pay 10 grand.

[04:20] Okay, so that's what he writes and he got 19 positive thumbs up about that. So I want to tackle that because I think this directly relates to what I want to talk about with my ghost busters Ellie and where I'm at currently.

[04:37] And the fact that I do currently have someone willing to spend $10,000 on ghost busters Ellie. So let's tackle this first with the question. Do we think it's right that people buy two versions of a pinball machine, put one in their home and keep one in box and sell it for profit?

[04:56] Is that a bad thing? Is that an illegal thing? Is that something that people shouldn't be allowed to do? I don't I don't think you can stop it.

[05:04] So I don't think we should worry about it. I think as long as it's proven in the past that people have flipped Ellie's and made money, people are going to speculate.

[05:13] And it's something that people should it's not a personal thing. I always feel like people take this personally like these people are ruining the hobby. These people are fleecing the second hand market.

[05:23] And here's why they're not because the fact of the matter is there's only 500 Ellie ghost busters. And for those of you who keep saying, well the premiums the same as the Ellie, just stop saying that.

[05:38] I get it that there were two premiums out there and Ellie games that were different with Tron and it looks like Star Trek were like the really the only two that had different features per say with Tron.

[05:53] You had a mode, you had the light at ramps or you had different stuff and there was no premium with Tron. So Tron Ellie is just an anomaly. It goes from Ellie to pro.

[06:03] And Tron Ellie is really held their value right people paid I think $6,300 for Tron Ellie's when they first came out and those people who kept them a new in box and held on to them were selling them between 12 and 15,000 dollars.

[06:20] Okay, new in box a few years later. So that started the craze to buy Ellie's and then what happened right after that people speculated on Avengers Ellie and got burned.

[06:31] People who speculated on Transformers Ellie got burned people who speculated a lot of Ellie's got burned. But but that's the that's it. That's how it is in Pimble. That's how it's going to be in this collector market.

[06:43] Now when it comes to ghost busters Ellie, I think people just need to stop ragging on the Ellie. I think there's so many but hurt people that can accept the fact that there's a reason why people want the Ellie.

[06:57] And let me break it down for you why I personally wanted Ellie and I think other people can relate. I think the Ellie artwork is better. I think the slimer green with the slimer and ghost busters written on the side is more colorful and I like it better than the pro and premium artwork.

[07:14] I don't that doesn't mean I don't like the pro and premium artwork. I just like the green with the slimer better. And I think with the very bright colors of ghost busters, I think that package looks nicer.

[07:25] So there's that now there's also the fact that there's only going to be 500 and as much that's it. If you if you could just stop on one reason why ghost busters Ellie will well pretty much probably hold its value and maybe go up and value.

[07:39] It's simply because of the limited nature of it. It doesn't matter if there's limited game features or if there's special things on with lighting. I see so many people is being like well we start track Ellie gave you that fancy lighting.

[07:50] Yes, do I wish there was something a little bit different that set ghost busters Ellie apart versus the armor and the cabinet artwork and the little cheap plaque that goes on it. Of course I do everybody does. So anyone who says they don't is lying.

[08:04] What would I have done differently with ghost busters Ellie to separate it a little bit more. Well, I probably would have had unique maybe speaker panel artwork.

[08:13] I probably would have had a night much nicer plaque. I don't even want to go into the fact that stern plaques are the are the cheapest looking things right now to me and what's annoying about them if you look at the plaques on the LEDs.

[08:25] They don't line up with the artwork of the speaker panel at all. That that little detail irks me to know and it happened because they used to put the plaques there when the speaker panels were just all black right and it didn't mess up any of the lines of the artwork.

[08:39] But when I see that plaque now on games like it's horrible on game of Thrones it looks off centered. Same thing with ghost busters that speaker panel like that white line just hits the plaque in the middle and it looks bad like they need to certainly to think about if you're going to charge this premium to redesign it and do it right and look at every detail.

[08:58] They should have zombie yeti make a special plaque for ghost busters Ellie's that looked better than the 25 cent metal plaques that they put up there but anyway there's only going to be 500 only 250 of them will be in the states and Canada.

[09:14] And the rest are going to go overseas. So look if you want to go spusters and it's your favorite theme of all time and you want to have the one that's just a little bit different a little bit special because of the rarity that's the Ellie guys.

[09:26] Why do we have to keep debating the merits of the price of the Ellie and it sold out the Ellie sold out in like two days.

[09:36] So who's wrong is Gary Stern wrong for making Ellie is like this is he wrong for for he's in he's in a business guys he's trying to make money that's the point of business he's not fleacing you he's giving people what they want and I tell you this everyone who's getting a ghost busters Ellie.

[09:54] At around $8,000 is happy no one is feeling they got fleece no one is feeling like it doesn't have enough over the premium everyone is happy who's getting one okay.

[10:05] So people who bought two of them I think these people are going to make out on this and it's it's apparent they already are and I think that guys like clank they really wanted an Ellie and they but what they want is this they want to go get an Ellie after the Ellie's are sold out for the story.

[10:23] For the sticker price of the Ellie or what people are paying and that's not going to happen.

[10:29] I mean anyone who has to or anyone who has one who's thinking of selling doesn't want to shouldn't give up their spot for what they paid.

[10:39] This whole love of pinball help out your fellow pin cider it's all bullshit it's all bullshit it's and it's not that doesn't anywhere assholes it just means we're intelligent people.

[10:50] In a in a in a capitalistic society where people are going to get the most they can for the good or service that they can provide and for those of you who came in early on ghost busters Ellie congratulations I think you've got something that's going to be worth something more than you paid now how long will be worth more than what people paid that is a much more interesting question.

[11:12] So do I think ghost busters Ellie is going to go the way of tron Ellie and keep climbing I don't think so I really don't I don't think people are going to lose money on it if they keep it new in box.

[11:25] But I don't think you're going to see people opening up ghost buster Ellie's playing them for a year and then trying to flip them and you know for 10 grand or 9 grand I just don't see that's going to happen because I think we're going to we're going to we're the with the precipice of a whole new error of LCD's.

[11:41] Of LCD's and Stern's and and Stern's going to start to believe take their machines to a much higher level now it's so hard for me to predict any of this stuff and I'll tell you why because I think ghost busters is probably one of the greatest themes for a pinball machine ever and I think people have been waiting for it forever and it's so iconic and I'm really not sure because I think that people love ghost busters way more than they love Metallica I've heard so many people talk about how this thing's going to go the way of metallic.

[12:10] And the Metallica pinball machine but you can't tell me that ghost busters and Metallica in terms of people's love affair with them are equal and I'll explain why people yes people love Metallica and they have a huge fan base but there's tons of people that don't like Metallica at all at all and music is much more polarizing than film.

[12:34] And there are certain movies are just iconic that just majority of people are into love movies like back to the future movies like goonies movies like ghost busters movies like the Lord of the Rings star wars these are movies that 90% plus people out there who have seen them enjoy them and I think musical acts just they have they have hard core fan bases and they have tons and millions of fans but movies just transcend that and

[13:04] popular movies transcend what what the fan base of a musical act is so I think that ghost busters is going to sell much better than Metallica and I keep hearing this is going to be my first new inbox pin over and over for people okay so that being said let's talk about canators ghost buster Ellie now as you know I'm torn I this has been sort of tearing me up and and I'll say this flipping a pinball machine for a two thousand dollar profit

[13:32] and it's a machine that you really do love and you really want to have and and and but the money is just so good and you're not sure that that money will stay there it hasn't been fun at all this process is sucked like I I kind of regret even listing it even trying to sell it because I do feel if I sell it and the game turns out to be spectacular right if the premium Ellie's become just incredible gameplay those magnetic slings the Ecto

[14:01] goggles everything just comes together the code matures into just one of the greatest pins of all time I know again like this all speculation I'm going to regret that I let one of the 500 Ellie's go and that's how I look at it and a lot of people think I'm stupid think that I should just get the premium but again I think the

[14:19] Ellie is just so much sweeter looking in the premium and that's just me I think the pro cabinet actually looks much more detailed and intricate than the premium cabinet I don't know

[14:28] something about the premium next to the Ellie just seems plain Jane to me and that's just my opinion about it so let let me first do it I said I was going to do and read some of the feedback I got from you guys when I asked the question should I sell my ghost

[14:43] busters Ellie for $10,000 and I'm going to start out with let's see from Andrew this Andrew Henderson he wrote to me he said take the money and run the

[14:58] Ellie numbers on Ghostbusters are the same as Metallica so if you look at Metallica you may get a good idea of the future trend of Ghostbusters Ellie will

[15:06] use Ellie be worth $10,000 plus no I think that it's doubtful I think a home use only use Ghostbusters Ellie will go for around $7,500 to $8,000 with mods maybe a bit more or less it's hot now but what is

[15:21] next Star Wars Iron Maiden what if by the grace of God there is a beetle juice pin coming Ghostbusters Ellie is hot now but it won't be hot forever I say sell it for as much as you can

[15:33] and I really want to get one in a six months or a year for a lot less or go premium okay so I think those are good points I think that as much as the Ghostbusters effect might be

[15:47] sending a little bit ripple effects to the market because of how popular it is Star Wars will definitely I think override the hype that Ghostbusters has created

[16:01] and I as I said though I do think that Ghostbusters is above Metallica when it comes to a comparison of the two pins so I wouldn't use that so that's that's one vote there for me to take the money and run let's see let's go to

[16:16] another comment here I'm just pulling on my emails guys sorry for a little bit of delay all right so this is from Daniel Bollerman Daniel thanks for listening to Canada's

[16:26] simple podcast Daniel said hey Canada I think you should keep your Ghostbusters the excitement behind your voice in the last month about it is the same I once had about the

[16:35] hobbit your game will be ready in a few short months I know I'd be happy once I got it not really care about how much money I could have made on it just my

[16:45] opinion well thank you Daniel for that opinion and you're right I've been really excited about Ghostbusters Ellie I'm much more excited about Ghostbusters Ellie

[16:53] than I'm excited about two thousand dollars because for those of you who live in New York City or know someone who does two thousand dollars in this city is not much money it's I because in my head I think about the

[17:09] profit and then I think about how quickly that goes in this city and if I just don't go out to restaurants for two months I could save that much you know there's just it's just a different

[17:20] environment here and and you look at what people pay for rent and what they pay to live here and what things cost it's really that's not a lot of

[17:28] profitor things I can go do with that money and but I know I'd have hours hours of fun with Ghostbusters Ellie so that is a vote to keep my Ghostbusters Ellie slot let's see let's read another one all right let's see

[17:41] here this is from West Bentley over at Rebel guitars West thank you for listening to Canada's pinball podcast this guy's got

[17:49] one of the sickest game rooms I've seen it's it's absolutely incredible West says sell it before the premium hits the line roll the 2k into a premium and enjoy

[18:00] having roughly 4,500 in your game so that is I've heard that from from from many people that if if I get the profit and then I buy a premium I'll basically be getting a premium for the price of a pro

[18:15] and that is a very very tempting thing to consider I have to say the the the the two grand is just free money to play around with and the premium is the same experience but as I said there's just something about the premium that I don't know I don't know when I look at it I guess what I guess you know the problem with all this is when you stand over a game and you're playing it you don't really notice the cabinet that much and all that supporting artwork that's on the sides

[18:45] it's it's very much from a distance these things matter more so you know we'll see so that's another vote for for selling it taking the money and running let's see what else someone said all right so this is from Blake and Blake is a graphic designer who is actually doing the artwork for Domino's pinball for spooky and I had the great pleasure of talking with Blake for a while down at Texas pinball festival super cool guy

[19:13] loved hearing about his work on Domino's pinball and we're actually going to talk to Blake as we get closer or right after they reveal that pinball machine I'm super excited for Blake and the spooky team I mean it's just it's so cool how fast they've sort of made this game and how much passion's got into it so I was I was psyched when I got an email from Blake and here's what Blake said about Ghostbusters he said all right you said since you wanted some open thoughts and feedback on what you should do with your Ghostbusters Ellie I figured I would do that.

[19:43] I throw my two cents into the ring I absolutely think you should keep it I've put in a lot of plays on a few Ghostbusters pros down here in Houston and I honestly believe that Ghostbusters is the most fun pinball experience I've had since the 90s Valley Williams games were still being made

[19:59] while that's while that's quite a bold statement to make considering how many games have been made since the end of Valley Williams error ended the reason I feel this way is because it is the first game that's turned or any other existing manufacturer has made in the past 15 years that actually feels like one of the ballies William error games I know I don't need to tell you about how much fun the game is and how beautiful it is because I think we're on the same page about that so what I like to reflect upon is looking at the bigger picture of what this game is.

[20:29] The game is and why it has resonated so well with the community so then Blake goes on to really write a very articulate email to me about how Ghostbusters is just this perfect storm of all the elements we've been waiting for in a pinball machine.

[20:43] You know it's sort of like everything from the artwork to the theme to the music to the gameplay to the shots to the cabinet to the colors.

[20:52] It doesn't really have anything missing that we've looked for in pinball machines and I think that's true of Ghostbusters and I think when we look at some of the Valley Williams hits of yesterday years you never really walk up to machines and feel like things are off like they really really really put so much passion and love into a lot of those machines and I think Ghostbusters is indicative of that.

[21:17] So Blake is saying I should keep it. I think there's like let me see there's one more I want to read for you guys before I move on.

[21:27] So Simon Hastings, Simon thank you for listening to this show. Simon says, you should sell your Ghostbusters Ellie for a 2000 profit by the premium and effectively have a premium for the cost of a pro.

[21:39] PS I'm loving the kamikaze episodes which later disappear. I listened to the last rant in bed and woke up the next morning with it gone and I thought it was all a dream.

[21:51] All right. And then you write serious question are you bipolar? So I have not been diagnosed bipolar as I told him I transform into a different human being after five whiskies but that's pretty normal for most of us.

[22:07] So that's another one for sell it and I think this is where I'm at guys this is pretty much a 50 50 split I've been hearing both sides of the camp keep it sell it keep it sell it and I'm here to tell you right now that I still have yet to make up my mind and I'm leaning towards keeping it and just enjoying it.

[22:30] And because when I think about that when I think about setting up Ghostbusters Ellie when I think about putting it in my living room when I think about all the fun mods that are going to be made for the machine when I think about exploring the game exploring the code trying to get to stay puff.

[22:47] You know wizard mode and I think about the color DMD will come out for eventually I just think it's going to be this magical pin that if I sell it I'm going to regret it and I'm going to try and get one back and I will get one back and I'm spending more to get one back then then I would if I just had kept it right so that's a thing too is and there's the new box factor if I don't know if anyone's ever going to get a Ghostbusters.

[23:16] We're going to get a Ghostbusters Ellie new in box for for anywhere south of $10,000 we're going to I think we're going to see a lot of them opened up and people try and get 10 grand for the machines once they're open and you know what's that number we always see less than 200 plays I hate that stuff such BS like everything's got 200 plays or less it's always like the magic number to convince people to buy.

[23:41] So that's it for what I'm going to do right now I have a really nice gentleman who is looking to buy the pinball machine is not on pin side and some of you may have seen on pin side but what I'm trying to do to and I'm having a friend help me out is is just fine other people that are willing to sell their LEDs for 10k and if you know someone willing to sell your Ellie for 10k tell them to email me at canada pinball K and EDA pinball at gmail.com

[24:10] and I will happily connect them with my buyer who buy the way guys is not some idiot he's not a sucker he's not a fool.

[24:20] If you use a thing this is why I don't want this guy to go to pin side and I specifically want to help him and set him up with the deal without having to log on to that site because if he went on that site and said hey I'm looking to buy Ghostbusters Ellie and I'm offering $10,000 you know what would happen he would have an army of people telling him to buy the pinball machine.

[24:40] I'm a sucker calling him like all sorts of names saying he should go get the premium he doesn't know anything about pinball he's a newbie he's guys like him are rooting the hobby and incentivizing people to be flippers.

[24:52] Why would I subject this guy to that because you know what his story is he really wants the machine he missed out on it he wants the Ellie and it's for his autistic son.

[25:02] You think I want a guy like that to get beat up on by the bullies on pin side that love to just slam people who are looking for something that will make them happy and they're not afraid of paying that price.

[25:15] So for those trolls out there who constantly moan and whine about people paying more than what they think something's worth all those guys just need to shut up because again in any market supply to man and people will people will figure out what something's worth.

[25:31] Not the people that constantly whine and complain about rising prices.

[25:35] So hit me up if you have one and you want to get rid of it and you're looking to get 10 grand I think it's a good time to take the price and who knows I might still sell it.

[25:44] I'm still I'm just on the fence I really wish my tails the Caribbean nights was working and I had three months to play it so I can make up my mind and whether or not I want to keep toad in in the living room or replace it with ghost busters.

[25:58] But I'm saying that as I look at my totem right now with this brass coin door everything's brass out and the brass parts are coming from Mike Chestnut as amazing as ghost busters is I still think tells the Caribbean nights is like the most beautiful pinball machine I've ever seen.

[26:16] So that's it with ghost busters Ellie it's going to be very interesting to see what happens more to come as the pin gets off the line and starts to get into people's living rooms.

[26:27] I think you're trying to save your dwarves friends but it does not dissuade me from my course.

[26:33] You started this me friend here you will forgive me if I finish it.

[26:39] I have a plea for everyone out there in the pinball community and I've been I've been a fool to do this and I think everyone just needs to stop and that is the hobbit pinball machine.

[26:54] It's like this it's like the most polarizing pinball machine I've ever seen because it creates so much dramatic opinions on both sides of the fence of people who love it people who hate it people who waited for people who say they never would wait for it people who think it's got the you know great shot layout and people who think it's the most empty playfield ever.

[27:18] I'm all up for a good debate and I think there's a healthy debate around this pinball machine that has taken place but I think it's beyond exhausted at this point.

[27:29] I think what really has inspired me to say this is there's like a new threat out there that was started by Russell and the thread was my review the hobbit is the ultimate test for for Keith right and it's just like.

[27:46] Why why does pinside let this happen where there's obviously enough hobbit threads are ready and if someone has has played the game and has their personal review fine but to start your own thread and then then sort of bash the game and say how it's empty and this and that and and can Keith save it with code that is all we've heard about hobbit now for so long it's so old at this point guys I think anyone who.

[28:15] Who is like looking to just throw that comment out into the hobbit community it's just stop it I mean I used to do it picking on J.J.P. fanboys and picking on the hobbit people who waited years is the oldest game in the book but it's it's run its course and I'm really looking for people to stop doing it like can we just let.

[28:36] The hobbit develop at this point for all of jacks issues and all the idiotic things he said and done and and the annoyance of the wait it's shipping all right the game is shipping it's going out the door the code is being worked on there's finally a use for the third flipper it seems like Keith's vision for the layout with code is coming to light with the pop ups you know being timed and blocking shots and there's yes so there's a lot of.

[29:05] Of work to be done to get it to full maturation and and have it be the the you know was code is what it's 6.0 and hobbit is at 1.0 something so just but are we going to keep just shitting on it every chance we get.

[29:22] The answer might be yes but I think people who keep doing that just need to shut up and just stop it but also needs to happen is the people who are in on it should just stop defending it in the most idiotic ways possible you know I offered.

[29:38] I offered $25 to pans or freak if he could just stop talking about and reminding us that he's in on the hobbit every single day I really think this guy like lives on Pinside just every day.

[29:51] Every day no matter what hour it is no matter what time if you say something about the hobbit he is in that thread he's in that conversation immediately and pans or freak this is nothing personal but I think it be much healthier for you if you just would stop commenting on Pinside about the hobbit right because what you're doing and what he's what have you seen the thread to that I'm talking about that Russell started going it these the fanboys now are like arguing that the hobbit is better because it weighs more right.

[30:20] Let me stop there it weighs more guys look how much is packed under the playfield don't don't don't call the playfield empty it's loaded underneath I mean this is so idiotic are we really going to start putting different Pimbal machines on scales now and weighing them and saying this machine's got more to do because it weighs more like this is like when I saw that I was like oh my god and then and then all the fanboys started like counting the shots literally counting and questioning the shots.

[30:49] This is so idiotic a Pimbal machine is not meant to be deconstructed and analyzed like in this fashion at all what people should think about is is it fun like do I enjoy it are the shots rewarding I don't care if there's fucking a hundred shots in a Pimbal machine and they all suck but if there's one beautiful shot that is rewarding to hit every time over and over that is more interesting so I think both sides need to be able to do that.

[31:19] So I'm going to stop the people need to stop hating and the fanboys need to stop coming up with like ridiculous reasons why the game is awesome.

[31:27] I think we're going to see if the hobbit is awesome or not in probably a year.

[31:32] And so I'm going to make an offer to pans or freak is a 25 bucks you already blew through that he's been talking about it more than five times I said I would read the duck fight ours I will offer pans or freak right ready for this offer for those guys who know them should PMM I will offer pans or freak.

[31:48] 100 dollars 100 dollars if he will go two months without talking about the hobbit or he can't mention it he can't talk about it we know he's going to get one he can only he can break that he can break that silence with an unboxing if he gets his Pimbal machine within that two months and he wants to talk about fine but I will give him 100 dollars paypal if he goes two months without talking about the hobbit let's see if he can do it.

[32:17] And let's give him some slack because he needs some time to hear about the offer he's probably talking about the hobbit right now all right so the last point I want to make on this episode 40 of canada's pinball podcast has to do with vault additions okay this is the topic that I don't understand why there have been so many different threads about what stern next vault edition will be every day.

[32:46] Every time I see a new vault edition thread I scream over to Brenda in the next room and this is what I scream at her.

[32:53] I STILL HELL!

[32:58] I STILL HELL!

[33:00] There's a new stern vault edition coming out and I know what it is I'm so tired of the tron VE threads how many of them do we need I wish every time someone started a new tron vault edition thread

[33:15] their computer would blow their nuts off do we really need to ask that question again I think pin sides should have a rule if you start another tron VE thread you will be permanently banned I'll tell you why because there's already been 50 threads about tron vault additions stop with tron vault additions stop with Lord the Rings vault additions stop now the new one is oh yeah my distributor told me can either that it's Batman re-themed to 1966 version of Batman oh yeah that's the new vault edition.

[33:44] That's the new vault edition and it's coming out before erosmith and all that shit maybe so I don't really know I don't really care what is the point of speculating on vault additions when stern is ready to reveal a vault edition we'll get it spider man vault edition was a good example we'll know what it is sooner than it is revealed it's just stern cannot prevent the leaks is big factory now it's just just too much the distributors know what's going on to people are going to hear about this stuff beforehand but at the end of the day

[34:13] if you have a Lord the Rings or you have a tron I think you should just accept the fact that it's gonna get a vault edition one day George Gomez himself said all the ones people have been speculating the big ones you're gonna see them who knows when that's it I mean I know it hangs over people like a dark cloud because they're just panicking tron Ali owners are panicking if they make a premium tron Ali that like ups the ante a little bit and and creates like different artwork and brings the Eli lighting and

[34:43] all that jazz but it's just so annoying that's I just want to say that's like I want to just end this podcast by saying if you're thinking about starting another vault edition thread just stop put down the keyboard and relax it's gonna happen if it happens you're never gonna be able to stop the

[35:02] vault edition trend all right so that's it for episode 40 of canators pinball podcast so I have interviews coming up next and I want to give you guys a little bit of a

[35:14] sort of a rundown of who I'll be talking to you in the next next couple weeks so there's two that I want to call out I'm gonna be talking to the black night he is
