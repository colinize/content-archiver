[00:00] I have to issue a warning at the beginning of this podcast.

[00:21] If you simply mention on Pinside that you just listened to Canadian Pimbal podcast, the

[00:26] moderators will delete.

[00:28] If you just listen to the podcast, you can't even say the name or type it out.

[00:35] It is against the rules.

[00:36] I love it.

[00:37] Grown, white men, moderating a Pimbal forum that are all nervous about saying the word

[00:43] canada.

[00:44] I'm like Moses.

[00:45] I've been stricken by ramsys from all the history books of Ancient Egypt.

[00:50] You can't even say my name.

[00:52] But Moses, as we know, will go down in history as the one who liberated the Jews.

[00:57] I will liberate the Pimbal listeners.

[01:00] Here's episode 47.

[01:02] It's going to be awesome.

[01:04] We are going to talk to Blake.

[01:06] Blake is the creative director of Spooky Pimbal's Domino's Pimbal Machine.

[01:10] We're going to talk about how we got involved on that project.

[01:14] What it was like to creative director and also work with a really talented artist.

[01:18] I found it funny that he's a creative director and he's working side by side with someone

[01:22] who can draw.

[01:24] We know the other infamous creative director who tried to do it all by himself.

[01:28] We're going to talk about that.

[01:29] We're going to talk about that.

[01:30] We're also going to talk about the community.

[01:33] We're going to talk about the games that are coming out and what Blake is excited about.

[01:37] What game he's going to get new in box.

[01:39] Without further ado, I want to keep this to an hour.

[01:41] I want to give you Blake.

[01:43] Here we go.

[01:45] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce the Canada's Pimbal podcast, a very, very special

[01:51] guest.

[01:52] This man, he is a designer.

[01:55] He works in the aerospace industry.

[01:57] He works with NASA on a daily basis.

[02:00] But you know him because he is working on Spooky Pimbal's Domino's Pimbal Spectacular

[02:06] Machine.

[02:07] I want to welcome Blake Dumasnil to the show.

[02:10] Did I get that right, Blake?

[02:11] Yeah, yeah.

[02:12] How's it going, Chris?

[02:13] Awesome.

[02:14] Blake and I, we met down at Texas Pimbal Festival in March.

[02:18] I remember I was just sort of lurking around the Spooky area and there you were.

[02:23] The Domino's Machine was just the cabinet was there and you just came up and you're like,

[02:27] hey, are you Canada?

[02:29] That was before like I was like the evil, I was kind of evil on Pimbal.

[02:34] But you know, I gave you credit for having to encourage to talk to me.

[02:37] It was awesome.

[02:38] It was great talking to you.

[02:39] You had a reputation, I knew who you were, but I also really enjoyed the podcast.

[02:44] And you know, so it was one of the great things about shows like T.P.F and all of these

[02:49] big expos is getting to meet people who you only know online.

[02:53] So right.

[02:54] So I know I'm really glad that we got to chat and meet up in Dallas.

[02:58] Awesome.

[02:59] And we've been wanting to have this conversation for a while.

[03:01] I know we sort of waited because you guys were holding to reveal stuff on the Domino's

[03:06] Machine and then I sort of took a hiatus after I was getting death threats.

[03:09] So here we are finally in August talking about spooky and your relationship to Pimbal.

[03:15] So like give us for the listeners, give us sort of your background with Pimbal.

[03:21] Like have you been into it your whole life?

[03:23] Is it something that you got into later in life?

[03:26] Like how did you get into the silver ball?

[03:29] I, yeah, I've been an avid pinball fan really ever since I was a little kid.

[03:35] Probably since I was about five or six years old.

[03:37] My dad bought, he's owned a few machines over the years and he bought our first pinball

[03:42] machine.

[03:44] It was actually an EM rogo machine that has a pretty fun little horseshoe toy in the middle

[03:51] that you shoot the ball around.

[03:53] And that's, I kind of learned how to play pinball on that initially as a five or six year old.

[03:59] Then he ended up buying a couple more machines.

[04:01] He got a black knight, a firepower, and then eventually a speakeasy.

[04:07] So I grew up learning how to play pinball at home and have an access to three or four

[04:11] machines at a time.

[04:13] And it's been something I've always really, really loved.

[04:19] And up until just the last few years and about 10 years ago, I was able to finally purchase

[04:25] a machine when I was in college.

[04:27] And it's kind of just snowballed from there.

[04:30] I've kind of been lurking in the community and wanted to get involved.

[04:34] And then when Pinside popped up, that kind of made that, you know, a lot more accessible.

[04:40] So what game did you get in college 10 years ago?

[04:45] So actually I was in 2004, 12 years ago, I stumbled upon a very small arcade in the

[04:54] mall of the hometown where my parents are from, here in Texas, small town in Southeast

[05:02] Texas.

[05:03] And this was, you know, this was at a time when all the arcades were starting to close, but

[05:07] there were still a few tilts and stuff like that around in different malls.

[05:11] And I wandered into this tiny little arcade in the mall and they happened to have an

[05:17] Adam's family back in the corner.

[05:19] And it was a very lightly routed machine.

[05:21] Had a little bit of wear and stuff on it, but I ended up talking to them about it and

[05:26] acquiring if they would, you know, be willing to sell it and was able to finally work out

[05:30] a deal with them on it.

[05:31] And so I still have that, that is the one and only machine that I still have to this

[05:36] day in my house.

[05:38] So, so if you can only have one machine right now, at least that's a pretty decent one.

[05:42] Yeah, that's definitely not a bad one.

[05:45] Have you, have you given any thought to getting another machine or you sort of like a one

[05:50] machine guy?

[05:52] I'm not a one machine guy.

[05:53] I actually, I have room to expand.

[05:56] I could probably get about six machines or so in my house.

[06:00] And yes, I am looking to expand.

[06:02] I am, I am in on a Ghostbusters premium.

[06:08] So I am anxiously awaiting to get that machine.

[06:12] And you know, just patiently waiting, hoping that everything works out where these machines

[06:18] will start getting cranked out here in the next month or two.

[06:20] So, well, I definitely, we're definitely going to talk about Ghostbusters and stuff going

[06:25] on in the hobby.

[06:26] But first let's, let's talk about, let's talk about Domino's.

[06:28] Because I know you are involved with Domino's on, on many levels.

[06:34] What explain everything you're doing when it comes to helping spooky get the Domino's

[06:39] pinball spectacular finish and out to market?

[06:43] So, basically, my involvement with the game has been since the very tail ended December

[06:50] last year, basically January 2016 when they really started developing the game with Domino's.

[06:59] And I have, I have served basically as the art director on the game.

[07:03] I have overseen kind of the look and feel of the game.

[07:07] And I've helped out with a lot of the different kind of graphic design aspects of it.

[07:16] And was able to collaborate with Adam Gasek and Scott Gullix on developing the artwork,

[07:24] doing some of the artwork, and then fleshing out like the mode's objectives.

[07:28] And just overall, what was going to kind of be the storyline of the game, I guess you

[07:32] could say.

[07:33] And so, yeah, my involvement has ranged from everything from doing the cabinet artwork to the inserts

[07:42] to a few of the marketing materials that we've put out there, trying to be organized with

[07:49] the information that gets put out there about the game.

[07:52] And so, just for the listeners who aren't following the threats, who Adam Gasek works

[07:57] at Domino's, right?

[07:59] And am I correct there?

[08:01] He's the lawyer at Domino's?

[08:03] Correct, yeah.

[08:04] Adam is actually one of their VP attorneys at Domino's corporate headquarters in Ann Arbor,

[08:10] Michigan.

[08:12] This project would have never existed had it not been for Adam.

[08:16] This game is his baby.

[08:17] It was his idea from the get-go.

[08:21] And my understanding is that he along with some co-workers up there, they had a small pinball

[08:27] league that would get together periodically.

[08:31] And I guess he thought it would be a really neat idea to take the Domino's brand and try

[08:35] to apply it to a pinball machine.

[08:37] He ran it past his management and the executives over there.

[08:42] And they love the idea.

[08:43] So from there, he took the idea to expo in Chicago last fall.

[08:51] And that's when he first talked to Charlie about it and kind of got an idea if Charlie

[08:56] would be interested in trying to make something like this.

[08:59] So...

[09:00] It is amazing that you have someone who works internally at Domino's and I work in marketing.

[09:06] It is hard to get a company to green light and approve in using their IP, using the logo.

[09:15] And it's really cool to that they've been able to have a mixture on this game for people

[09:20] who have seen it.

[09:22] We've got the new Domino's logo, but you've got the noise.

[09:25] There's a lot of different throwback elements to the Domino's pizza that people grew up

[09:30] with as well, which I think was definitely a battle that they had to fight internally

[09:35] to make sure that all that could get in the game.

[09:37] What was it like in terms of figuring out the artwork?

[09:41] How was that process?

[09:42] Because we hear so much on Pinside in the community about getting approval from the company.

[09:46] Was it really easy working with Domino's in terms of getting them to approve the creative

[09:51] ideas that were in your guys' heads?

[09:53] Yeah, you're absolutely right.

[09:55] I mean, when you're working with a licensor, they have...

[09:59] Typically, they all have style guides in terms of how they want their corporate identity

[10:03] to be utilized and how their logo can be used.

[10:07] You know this is good as anybody that I mean, they've got details down to the spacing

[10:12] of the word Domino's with their tile logo and how far apart they have to be and very specific

[10:18] details.

[10:19] I'm very familiar working with those kind of guidelines because NASA is the same way.

[10:24] The NASA Meatball is one of the most recognizable logos in the world and they are sensitive

[10:29] about how it gets used and they want it used in a very particular way.

[10:34] So going into this project, and we can talk about how I initially got involved in a little

[10:40] bit, but I was a little unsure of how easy or difficult it was going to be to work with

[10:48] a major corporation like Domino's that has a very recognizable brand.

[10:55] I kind of wanted to feel adamant about it first to see if this was something I wanted

[10:59] to try to help out with.

[11:01] If it seemed like the branding was going to be hard to work with and try to incorporate

[11:05] and they weren't going to be flexible, then that might not have been a battle that I

[11:11] wanted to fight.

[11:12] But as soon as I talk to Adam about it, I mean, he was just like, look, we've got buy-off

[11:19] to do just about anything we want to do on this game and now that we've pretty much

[11:24] wrapped up all of the artistic aspects of it, I have to say...

[11:29] This group was just one of the easiest corporations to work with that I have ever, ever worked

[11:35] with.

[11:36] I mean, they were just...

[11:37] A lot of it, I credit to Adam for that because he's the one who really pushed it through

[11:41] the channels, through the marketing department, through the branding departments.

[11:45] But man, we didn't get pushback on like anything.

[11:50] We had some ideas that...

[11:54] And they were very, very small details that we would think of something one way and then

[12:01] they would say, well, we like your idea and you can definitely do that idea, but just

[12:06] take this out or just tone this down a little bit or something like that.

[12:10] And so we...

[12:11] I honestly don't think that there was anything that we pitched that did not get approved.

[12:16] I mean, it was just...

[12:18] It was unbelievable and I have to say that the only reason that this game was able to get

[12:24] a completely original hand drawn art package and be made within the last eight months is

[12:31] because they were so easy to work with and they let us kind of have free reign on it.

[12:37] So...

[12:38] My guess, as a marketer too, I think why it was so sort of efficient and so easy to work

[12:46] with them is this idea started with legal.

[12:50] Most of my good ideas died with the legal team.

[12:53] Once it gets to the legal team, they shut it all down.

[12:55] So the fact that this idea was born within the attorneys over there, I think that was

[13:00] probably one of the reasons why they were able to sort of move quickly.

[13:03] So let's talk about the beginning because we can't really talk about your involvement

[13:09] without talking a little bit about the controversy that began when Adam came onto the community

[13:16] and it was like eight months ago and he said, look, we're going to be doing a dominoes.

[13:21] Pinball machine with spooky and we wanted to have what I thought was an innocuous sort

[13:25] of fun contest to ask the community for some artistic ideas.

[13:31] And the first place person got $200, second place, $100, third place, $50.

[13:35] It was like in the form of dominoes, gift cards.

[13:38] And all of a sudden, there was a lot of vitriol from some of the designers on the community.

[13:46] And what were your thoughts when you saw some of the initial reaction that people were sort

[13:50] of complaining about when that offer was put out there?

[13:54] Yeah, it was an interesting start.

[14:00] So I think that Adam, of course, some of the, I don't want to say controversy, but some

[14:07] of the harsh thoughts that people had about the game dated back even farther back towards

[14:14] like October timeframe.

[14:15] I think right after Adam talked to Charlie and the word got out that they were thinking

[14:19] about making a dominoes game.

[14:20] You know, there were a lot of people that they were like, oh my god, of all the brands,

[14:25] you know, why would anybody waste their time making a dominoes machine?

[14:28] You know, the game's going to suck.

[14:30] It's not going to be cool.

[14:32] You know, there were a few people that they saw the potential in it.

[14:37] But then there was a lot of kind of just scrutiny over it.

[14:41] So anyways, I think around December, Adam got on there and he finally, I think they

[14:46] finally officially announced that dominoes was going to be a machine that speak he was

[14:50] making.

[14:51] And then a couple weeks later, they came up with this idea for the contest.

[14:54] And yeah, I have to admit that I was very surprised at the backlash that Adam's post

[15:03] got it.

[15:04] It was nothing in how he phrased anything.

[15:07] He was extremely professional, extremely polite about how he put it.

[15:12] And I just was surprised about the reaction.

[15:15] So I actually waited about a week after the threat initially started and basically all

[15:24] the dust had settled by that point.

[15:25] All the designers had gotten on there and said their piece.

[15:29] And I will say that I don't want to see critical of the other designers because I understand

[15:34] their perspective and I understand where they were coming from.

[15:37] I've participated in a lot of contests and yeah, typically people like holding contests

[15:43] because they want to not totally get free work but sort of get free work.

[15:49] So I understood the perspective, but at the same time, that's not the angle that I felt

[15:54] like Adam was coming at with this thread that he started.

[15:59] And so after that...

[16:01] I think what people were missing.

[16:03] I want to read what Adam wrote, because I think he wrote, we are seeking submissions

[16:07] for backlash and cabinet art that we will consider a long...

[16:11] And this is the part I think people miss, along with our current design efforts and the

[16:15] top three submissions will receive free Domino's pizza.

[16:18] I mean, I think some of the reaction people were acting as if they were asking them to

[16:21] design the entire thing for them, right?

[16:24] And then...

[16:25] Yeah.

[16:26] Which is...

[16:27] Yeah, in overreaction.

[16:28] I think that it was open to interpretation as far as people could take it.

[16:34] If people wanted to take the time to design something for this game, they could take it

[16:39] as far as they wanted to.

[16:41] If they wanted to do nothing but a napkin sketch, I think Adam and Charlie and everybody were

[16:46] open to seeing those ideas.

[16:48] If they wanted to put something a little bit more polished together, then I think that

[16:51] they were absolutely open to that as well.

[16:54] I personally...

[16:57] I kind of felt bad as a designer and there are...

[16:59] I was glad to see how many different designers there are in the pinball community.

[17:04] I kind of felt bad for Adam.

[17:07] I mean, I felt like that...

[17:09] Here's this guy who's really excited about this new project that they're going to be

[17:13] working on.

[17:14] And they kind of reamed him for it.

[17:18] I mean, I agree.

[17:20] The first comment right after Adam Post is...

[17:25] We all know who this came from and aren't to say it, but he writes, wow, seriously,

[17:29] much love the spooky, but this is bullshit.

[17:31] I mean, the level of anger was...

[17:34] If you're Adam, and I felt bad for Adam too, because he's convinced his company, this

[17:39] is a good thing to do.

[17:40] If his colleagues read this, and the next thing they read is the commentary from people

[17:46] who are overreacting, that's a hard thing to...

[17:50] Internally, to convince people, we're doing the right thing here, and now you have people

[17:55] saying, FU to the brand and the spooky, right?

[17:57] I mean, yes.

[17:58] Yeah, you know, my first impression when I read the thread was that was not that, oh,

[18:05] this is somebody looking for free work.

[18:07] My first impression was, this is somebody who really loves this community, and they're

[18:13] reaching out to try to involve the community to hopefully help make a better game that

[18:18] people, not just within their own company, but also within the pinball community, are

[18:23] going to enjoy and that they're going to like the things that they see on.

[18:27] So, you know, I actually applaud him reaching out to the community and wanting to try to

[18:33] put some things in there that, you know, we might nitpick over or that, you know, we

[18:38] as pinball enthusiasts would point out that maybe their employees who maybe buying these

[18:43] machines won't notice.

[18:45] So, so, no, I never interpreted it as a cheap out for getting artwork, you know, and

[18:53] like I said, I get where the other designers were coming from on it, and I understand

[18:58] their perspective, and there have been contests before where you kind of feel that way, but

[19:05] and I don't think this was one of those cases.

[19:06] I think this was a legitimately, you know, honest approach to just trying to get some good

[19:12] feedback from PINSIDE.

[19:14] So, Blake, when did you, so you saw the contest and when did you decide that you were going

[19:18] to enter and what was that process like?

[19:22] So basically, like I said, I waited about a week after I, the thread was initially started,

[19:27] and this happened, this was the week between Christmas and New Year's, and I was off

[19:31] from work for the holidays, and I started thinking about it, and I was like, you know,

[19:38] I've got some ideas for some things that might be fun to incorporate in this game,

[19:43] maybe some routes that they could take with brand incorporation stuff.

[19:48] Let me email this guy at him, and let me just pick his brain about the project a little

[19:52] bit.

[19:53] Let me get his perspective on what's going to be their approach, how flexible are they

[19:58] going to be with the brand, you know, one of the main things I was really curious about

[20:02] was how much could we use the noise, and in the back of my mind, to me, that was really

[20:07] a bit, going to be a big sales point for this game.

[20:11] That was something that was really going to harken back to the nostalgia that people have

[20:15] for, you know, dominoes in the 80s, and people have a lot of fond memories of playing

[20:20] pinball in the 80s and early 90s.

[20:21] So I felt like that could be a really great tie to try to make this sort of a throwback

[20:26] type of a game, and Adam sent me a response back the same day, and he was extremely polite

[20:32] about it, and he basically said, look, we've, we're open to anything, any ideas you've got,

[20:38] any rough or polished ideas.

[20:41] So I said, all right, look, let me, I've got, I've got a few things that I'd like to,

[20:45] to just test out, let me, let me throw some concepts together in Photoshop.

[20:50] Let me just start off with the, the cabinet template that they had posted, and let me run

[20:56] with it, and let me just send it back to you, and he said, hey, that would be great.

[21:00] We'd like to see what you, what you have.

[21:02] And so I did exactly that.

[21:04] I put something together over the next few days, and sent it back to them.

[21:09] I guess at this time they were still receiving some entries from different people of varying

[21:16] levels of detail, I guess.

[21:18] And so basically, I think in early January, Adam got back with me, and he basically said,

[21:26] look, we, we really like what you've put together, and I had pitched some other ideas that

[21:32] were not necessarily art related, but just game related.

[21:36] And he said, we, we like your approach.

[21:38] Would you be interested in coming aboard as the art director for the machine and helping

[21:41] me out with just fleshing the game out even more?

[21:46] You know, so I said, yeah, I'd love to do that.

[21:49] Right.

[21:50] And, and who's doing the hand drawn art?

[21:53] It's Scott, right?

[21:54] So Scott Gullix, who, of Riot Pinball, who did Wrath of Olympus, he, he did all of the

[22:02] illustration work on Wrath of Olympus, and then he also, you know, I believe that that

[22:06] game alongside a friend of his, that was their boutique project.

[22:12] You know, they came up with that game from scratch, and they did all the leg work on it.

[22:15] And so Scott is the one who ultimately did all of the illustrative work on this game.

[22:22] I, I was very honest with Adam, and I told him that, look, I, I do know how to draw, but

[22:30] I taught myself how to draw when I was a kid, but I, I just felt like my skills were a

[22:34] little rusty on doing figural design work like that.

[22:38] And I said, I don't want to sign up to do that aspect of this game.

[22:43] I think that this needs to be done by somebody even better at it than I am.

[22:47] And so he reached out to Scott, and Scott was very enthusiastic about coming on board,

[22:55] and felt like we had some good ideas.

[22:57] And so we, Adam and I had had sketched out some ideas.

[23:01] We had typed up, you know, some sort of paragraphs describing like what the back glasses could

[23:07] look like and what the play field could look like.

[23:10] And so that's what ultimately got pitched to Scott, and he took it from there.

[23:14] So then I ended up working with him on, you know, all of the, I did, all of the, anything

[23:21] that has text on it on the play field, I did that on the game.

[23:25] So all the inserts and a lot of this just branding ornamentation that Domino's had given

[23:32] us, I found ways to incorporate it into the ball paths and stuff like that, and, and then

[23:38] also onto the back glasses.

[23:40] So it was a fantastic collaborative effort.

[23:43] Right.

[23:44] Scott was just, he is an incredibly talented artist.

[23:48] And I'm sure you've seen obviously his wrath, the Olympus work, but you know, he's done

[23:52] like an alternate trans light for a game of thrones, which is just really stunning.

[23:57] And I just, you know, I'm laughing a little bit at the irony because I think you guys did

[24:03] do it perfectly where you have the art director and the artist sort of working together to deliver

[24:07] the best package.

[24:08] I do laugh inside because I know the person who was critiquing and yelling the loudest

[24:14] is an art director who took on the role also as the main play field designer for aliens.

[24:20] I'm just going to leave it at that.

[24:21] You will draw the conclusions, but I think you guys did it right.

[24:23] I must say you guys, when I'm looking at the Domino's play field right now, the inserts

[24:27] and everything look great.

[24:28] I think, you know, I actually think this is more cohesive and put together in a much

[24:33] nicer package than even Rob Zombie, which if there was one ding on Rob Zombie's artwork,

[24:39] it was like the inserts and things look like afterthoughts.

[24:41] But everything on this game just looks great.

[24:44] I mean, every, all the inserts, everything just seems to connect perfectly to the Domino's

[24:49] universe.

[24:50] Thank you.

[24:51] Yeah, I mean, you know, when I got involved and I went into this in the back of my mind,

[24:56] I'm like, look, I saw it kind of as a challenge because there were a lot of people on the

[25:00] pin side that were like, oh, this is not going to be a good game.

[25:04] It's not going to be a great theme.

[25:06] You know, making pizzas is boring.

[25:08] Bob, Bob, Bob.

[25:09] And I just took that as a challenge.

[25:10] I'm like, you know what?

[25:12] We've got the Noid, which is a very recognizable mascot.

[25:17] And certainly for the average age group of people that are in the pinball hobby.

[25:21] And I'm like, you know what?

[25:22] We're going to just, we're going to do whatever we can with this game.

[25:26] We're going to knock this out of the park.

[25:28] We're going to try to have fun with it.

[25:29] We're going to try to be creative.

[25:31] And ultimately, we wanted to make the game feel like a 1990s, you know, Valley Williams

[25:36] game.

[25:37] We wanted to have that really great hand drawn feel to it.

[25:41] We wanted it to have some clever, witty humor.

[25:44] And I wanted to see how we can incorporate the brand as best as possible between giving

[25:52] the cabinet a little bit more of the corporate look while letting the play field in the back

[25:56] glasses have all the color and all the real character, literally the characters and all

[26:04] the personality, you know?

[26:05] So we found a good balance.

[26:08] Yeah, I mean, I think it looks great.

[26:10] And you shared with me the new alternate translate that has like the big sort of noise

[26:15] stomping through the city like Godzilla.

[26:18] I mean, the detail is great.

[26:19] Are there any Easter eggs in this image for you guys who are, I mean, I know this is

[26:23] a podcast.

[26:24] You can't see it, but I would Google Domino's Translite pinball.

[26:28] I know it's in the on-pinside and people have seen the alternate translate.

[26:32] What?

[26:33] There's like a tank shooting item.

[26:34] Like, there's people here.

[26:35] Is there any of like the designers or people who are involved in the project in any of these

[26:40] like translates as Easter eggs?

[26:43] Yeah, yeah.

[26:44] I got to say the alternate translate was an idea that we had from the beginning of the

[26:49] project, but we knew that we were going to have to do something that was a little bit

[26:53] more historical, well, Domino's history based and a little bit more corporate for the standard

[26:58] translate.

[27:00] And so the standard translate has a lot of Easter eggs time back to their company history.

[27:05] But with this one, this was the fun idea that we wanted to run with.

[27:10] We knew we were going to do an alternate translate.

[27:13] And so we just, we kind of threw everything in the kitchen sink into this design.

[27:18] And I got to say it, it was a lot of work to put together.

[27:21] And Scott just busted his ass and did an amazing job cranking this thing out.

[27:26] But it was also such a thrill to work on it.

[27:31] So yeah, if you look in the lower right corner, a number of the people down here are actual

[27:38] people that were involved with the game in some capacity.

[27:42] So the gentleman in the gray suit holding the yo-noid sign up, I believe is a coworker

[27:49] or a friend of Adams.

[27:51] And then just to the left of him is Adam.

[27:54] And then to the left of Adam holding the pizza boxes is me.

[28:00] And then the guy who's on the top turret of the tank holding his arms up, that is one

[28:08] of Adams co-workers in the legal department or finance department, I think.

[28:13] His name is Dan.

[28:14] And he also collaborated with Adam on fleshing out some of the ideas for the coding, the

[28:20] rules and stuff like that.

[28:21] Well, you got to put the finance guy.

[28:23] I mean, he approved that.

[28:24] Right.

[28:25] Yeah.

[28:26] Well, I think that he was, you know, he was Adam's partner and crime on the domino

[28:29] side of the house on developing this game and helping convince people to do it.

[28:34] And I know that his name is Dan and Dan had some really fun ideas too.

[28:40] And then if you look past kind of back on the sidewalk there by the diner just below

[28:46] the cannon of the tank, just to the left of the fire hydrant, you'll see a ball gentleman

[28:52] holding a sign.

[28:54] And that is actually Scott Gullig's.

[28:58] So Scott got himself in there.

[28:59] So yeah, we got some fun representation from the team in there.

[29:03] And some of the other Easter eggs that I'll point out, I have to admit that it's really

[29:10] funny.

[29:11] Adam and I both had this idea of a sort of Godzilla or stay puff marshmallow man, Esk,

[29:19] Noid, terrorizing a city.

[29:21] And we both kind of ended up pitching the idea to each other.

[29:26] That's how on the same page we were throughout this project.

[29:31] And so I kind of saw it as a fun, this was before Ghostbusters was even announced actually.

[29:37] I'm a huge Ghostbusters fan.

[29:39] I've always loved the movie.

[29:41] And so I wanted to find a way to throw some fun little nods in there.

[29:46] And so aside from the Noid terrorizing the city, there's a lady holding a sign over

[29:52] to the left hand, lower left part of the trans-liet.

[29:57] She basically, her sign is a play on the Ian afraid of no ghosts.

[30:05] And so I sent you a high res and a one night.

[30:06] Yeah, it says Ian Alfredo No Noid.

[30:11] So yeah, there's a little really bad pizza humor in there.

[30:16] The sign, Scott's holding up says what a nightmare an era.

[30:21] And then the other little Ghostbusters Noid, or Ghostbusters Easter Egg that I threw in

[30:26] there is on the billboard that is below the left stop light.

[30:30] It's actually an advertisement for a pizza deal.

[30:33] But it says, now there's something you don't see every day, which was a fun little bill

[30:38] merry quote from the movie.

[30:40] That's awesome.

[30:41] That's awesome.

[30:42] So one other, one other little movie Easter Egg, I'll point out that most people will not

[30:47] pick up on because it's kind of hard to see.

[30:51] But if you look at the arcade building over to the left hand side, let me ask you, have

[30:57] you seen Days and Confused?

[31:00] Years ago.

[31:01] Okay.

[31:02] Well, the pool hall, the arcade and pool hall that they hang out at, especially where Matthew

[31:08] McConaughey has some of his more quotable lines, was called the Emporium.

[31:14] And it's got these big color balls painted on the entire front of the arcade.

[31:21] And so I end up recreating the front of that facade, basically, for the side wall of

[31:27] that building.

[31:28] So if you look just behind the Noid flag, you'll kind of see the word Emporium.

[31:34] You'll see the M and the P and the O tapering back alongside.

[31:38] So that was just another fun little little Easter Egg that most people won't pick up on.

[31:44] So when people ordered this machine, is they have the option to get the alternate translate

[31:50] as like an additional thing or as something, how is like spooky handling which translate

[31:54] you get?

[31:55] Yeah.

[31:56] So basically, my understanding was that Adam had agreed with Spooky that they would offer

[32:02] an L. Lee model of the game with an alternate translate design.

[32:07] However, Domino's basically immediately got around 70 to 80 commitments pre-orders on

[32:14] this machine.

[32:16] Really even before it was kind of first announced back around December of last year.

[32:22] And so the first 75 machines are essentially going to be the L. E.s. and they will have

[32:27] this back glass.

[32:28] However, they will also have a numbered plaque and everything.

[32:32] So they will be differentiated a little bit from the standard games.

[32:36] But their intention was always to offer the alternate translate as a purchasable translate

[32:45] for the people that get the standard machines.

[32:47] So the games will come with the standard machines.

[32:50] But if they want the alternate back glass, they will be able to buy that from Spooky.

[32:56] And it will be a reasonable price.

[32:57] It's not going to be a very expensive 100 or 200 dollar back glass.

[33:05] Did most of those orders come from Domino employees when they revealed it at the convention

[33:11] or is it like a mixture between Domino's owners and pinball fanatics?

[33:16] Well, I'll tell you what.

[33:19] The apparently a lot of the initial pre-orders on the game were, it's almost a kind of pinball

[33:26] blasphemy after the events that have happened with Skit B and Jay Pop over the last couple

[33:32] years.

[33:33] My understanding is that the first like roughly 80 or so games were sold site unseen to Domino's

[33:41] people in house just when they first sent their corporate communication out about the game.

[33:46] So these folks had not even seen one piece of artwork or anything about the game and

[33:53] they already committed to buying one.

[33:56] So from there, yeah, it did kind of grow.

[34:02] And once the game I think was shown, I think there were a few pre-orders prior to TPS.

[34:10] And then after the cabinet was shown at TPS and we pointed out some of the features and

[34:17] you know what was going to be in the game, then some more serious pre-orders from the

[34:22] pinball community started trickling in.

[34:25] And then my understanding from Adam is that since the game was fully revealed at the

[34:29] rally in June as well as with the gameplay footage this past week, they've gotten more

[34:35] commitment from the pinball community.

[34:38] That's great.

[34:40] Yeah, I think it's going to be a pretty healthy mix between Domino's folks and the pinball

[34:46] community.

[34:47] Yeah, I agree.

[34:48] I've always said, if there's a game inside a box that people can go get, and spooky is

[34:56] good.

[34:57] They're going to have both games on the line at the same time, both Rob Zombie and Domino's.

[35:02] People will buy it.

[35:03] I mean, the community loves to open up new in box and they want to try new stuff.

[35:07] And I'll say this too, the price point of this machine is not going to destroy people

[35:12] considering where other stuff is going.

[35:14] How much is it?

[35:15] It's like 5,800 am I making that up?

[35:17] No, actually, it's a little cheaper than that.

[35:20] So it is $52.99 plus shipping.

[35:24] So you're looking at $5,300 for the game, basically.

[35:29] However, this, a big part of this project and the reason that Domino's approved it is

[35:35] because they are going to donate $500 of every machine sold to their Domino's partners

[35:45] and foundation charity, I believe.

[35:48] And so basically, you will get a tax deductible receipt for $500 with the purchase of the

[35:57] game that you will be able to file.

[36:00] So if you factor that in and if you're able to take advantage of that with your tax filings

[36:06] for the year, then you could be potentially getting the game for $4800.

[36:10] That's great.

[36:11] That's great.

[36:12] When is the game shipping?

[36:14] So they are building the first few test-mule machines right now.

[36:21] The machine that was used for the live streams last week and this weekend, Adam has

[36:26] in Michigan now and he's test playing it.

[36:29] And basically, they are already starting to build the cabinets.

[36:32] They're already printing in plastics and they're already working on wiring and stuff.

[36:36] So they are underway on building these games.

[36:40] But I don't think you'll start seeing them go out until probably sometime in mid-September

[36:45] relates them to.

[36:46] I don't want to speak for spooky or Charlie.

[36:48] I don't want to hold them to that.

[36:50] But I know that that's the goal and they certainly plan to start having some of these go

[36:54] out before Expo.

[36:56] That's great.

[36:57] Well, I think that spooky continues to do great stuff like this and win people over

[37:04] because they always manage expectations right.

[37:08] And they're putting pinball out in the world.

[37:10] They don't do it with any drama.

[37:13] They don't do it with people's money being frozen for years.

[37:17] I think everyone, that good will is just going to continue to go on with this dominant

[37:22] pinball.

[37:23] So we wish this game the best of luck.

[37:25] I look forward to hopefully playing it at Expo this year.

[37:29] For those of you who want to see the gameplay, there's a dead flip video that's out there

[37:33] that I recommend watching.

[37:34] There's also another video of, bro, do you even pinball did a nice YouTube video of

[37:40] them playing in?

[37:41] I believe at the Domino's headquarters.

[37:44] So there's two really good videos out there.

[37:47] I'll let listeners go watch those to get an understanding of the gameplay because I think

[37:52] when you talk gameplay on podcasts, it's like you got to see it.

[37:56] It just gets really boring, really fast.

[37:59] So let's talk about some of the stuff going on in the community.

[38:02] So you personally, you said you have a Ghostbusters premium on order.

[38:06] I want to talk about that because we've heard a lot of people that I've heard from people

[38:13] in the grapevine that Ghostbusters is the fastest selling stern machine of all time.

[38:18] So many orders came in.

[38:19] We all know about the drama that happened over the summer with ghosted inserts and play

[38:24] field issues.

[38:26] You're sticking to your guns on your premium.

[38:28] You haven't been sort of swayed or you're not nervous about getting a machine that's

[38:33] not going to be a good quality.

[38:36] Where's your head at right now?

[38:38] I have not bad it and I haven't thought twice about telling my distributor that I want

[38:45] to hold off on the game.

[38:46] Look, I understand where people are coming from in terms of some of the complaints and that

[38:54] there are issues that need to be resolved.

[38:57] There's a reason that Stern's been in business as long as they have.

[39:00] There's a reason that they're the largest manufacturer and they've got their process

[39:03] honed in pretty well.

[39:06] I have a lot of faith that they are actively working on trying to figure this out, making

[39:12] sure that it gets fixed.

[39:15] I don't think that they're going to start letting more of these games go out until they

[39:20] really have it fixed.

[39:22] It seems like some of the folks that are getting some of the later alleys, the ones that have

[39:26] been produced maybe more around the beginning or middle of this month compared to June and

[39:31] July, seems like those play fields are holding up a little bit matter maybe.

[39:36] It's entirely possible that they very quietly already resolve this and they're already

[39:40] starting to trickle those games out that are fixed.

[39:44] I'm not worried about it.

[39:47] I think that I don't have the means to go by every single machine that I see that I enjoy

[39:55] playing and that I want to have it.

[39:56] I don't have the room for it either.

[39:58] But I'll say this, Ghostbusters is a theme that I have been wanting to see since I was

[40:03] a little kid.

[40:04] It's a game that I always felt like would have made a phenomenal pinball machine.

[40:08] I felt like it was just a totally complete package in terms of its storyline, its humor,

[40:15] the call outs from the movie, the sound effects, music and everything.

[40:21] There's no way that I'm going to pass up on this game and I'm just going to be patient

[40:25] and hope that they get these issues worked out.

[40:27] I'm not going to break them over the calls over it.

[40:31] Blake, you were one of the reasons why I decided to keep my early.

[40:34] I know we were talking months ago and when I was just trying to decide what to do with

[40:39] it and you wrote me this really nice email explaining all the reasons why you think

[40:44] Ghostbusters is just one of the modern day Adams family and how it's integrated with

[40:49] the movie and it's just the perfect package.

[40:52] I think Stern is not going to ship a single premium until the problem is fixed.

[40:55] I think that is a safe bet with the premium.

[40:59] I think where they're sort of still tripping a little bit, is there still setting out games

[41:04] with mismatched side rails?

[41:08] They're like losing, they're trying to win the war but they're losing the little skirmish

[41:13] that I think is just making people just scratch their heads and being like, is quality

[41:18] control just falling off?

[41:21] Even when I talk to people that I know are there, I'm like, I get that you guys don't

[41:24] make the playfields and you're figuring out the issues but the side rails, you got to

[41:29] win every point.

[41:30] They need to win every point they can get.

[41:33] They're still like, so hopefully all this is, I think it's going to be a non-issue in

[41:39] a couple of months.

[41:40] I think by the time we get to Expo, if Stern's going to have their big party and hopefully

[41:43] reveal another game, they don't want any issues.

[41:48] They're going to be sharing into October.

[41:50] I can't.

[41:51] No, no, I couldn't agree with you more.

[41:57] They're going to fix this, they're going to make it right.

[42:00] I think that all of the people that have received games that have had issues with them, I

[42:05] think Stern will absolutely do the right thing.

[42:08] I think they're figuring out what's the best way to handle it and when they have figured

[42:13] that out, they will start letting people know that.

[42:16] They're obviously very aware of the problem.

[42:19] I do agree with you.

[42:20] I think things like mismatched side rails, that's, hey, things happen.

[42:26] You got to have good quality control and you got to prevent those things from happening.

[42:30] Those things don't bother me as much because that's an easy fix.

[42:37] People need to give them a little bit of credit here.

[42:40] They have built some really damn good games.

[42:43] They've had pretty minimal issues over the years for the most part.

[42:46] And give them a little bit of a break.

[42:50] Chances are if the response to Ghostbusters has been as huge as everybody says it has

[42:57] been, I'm sure they want to crank these things out as quickly as they can and make that

[43:02] money and everything.

[43:04] So sure, things happen.

[43:08] They're going to fix it.

[43:09] I have no doubt they're going to fix it.

[43:11] Right.

[43:12] No, I agree.

[43:13] I think the communication on their part to be better, they could come out a little bit

[43:17] ahead of this a little bit and come out without, you know, they kind of get the mob going.

[43:22] But I agree.

[43:23] I think in two months, we're all going to laugh about Ghostbusters or Ellie ghosted

[43:26] inserts and how the irony of a game about ghost had ghosted inserts and they're going

[43:31] to fix it.

[43:32] I mean, it's, they're going to make everyone happy.

[43:35] I completely agree.

[43:36] So Blake, let's talk about like the games coming out because, you know, you chose Ghostbusters

[43:43] a lot that's currently available or will be available shortly.

[43:48] So we've got stuff like aliens, we got stuff like the big Lebowski is now shipping.

[43:53] We've got medieval madness remakes.

[43:56] We've got Hobbit.

[43:58] What's out of these games?

[44:00] Like have you played all the new stuff that's sort of the talk of the town and what are

[44:04] your thoughts on like these games?

[44:05] We can go down the list.

[44:06] Have you played the Hobbit?

[44:08] Yeah.

[44:09] So I have extensively played the Hobbit.

[44:12] It's been a part of our pinball league nights down here every week for well, really since

[44:17] the game came out.

[44:18] So yeah, you know, I, I had to warm up to the Hobbit a little bit.

[44:24] I will admit that without standing, sounding too stereotypical, you know, the game is

[44:30] a gorgeous machine.

[44:32] It makes a very nice appearance and I think it is a wonderful example of proving that Photoshop

[44:38] can be done well on, on pinball machines.

[44:40] People are very quick to criticize Photoshop and, you know, say that it's, it's an awful

[44:46] way to do a machine, but it can be handled well.

[44:49] And I, I applaud Jack and company for doing a beautiful job on the game.

[44:53] I, I was surprised at the feel of the game and the game played the first few times that

[45:00] I played it.

[45:01] It is something that I've now gotten used to, but, you know, the comments about the

[45:06] game being a little floaty and, you know, they were not unfounded.

[45:11] I, I had the same feeling when I played it.

[45:16] And, you know, you, you can make the shots, but you don't totally know what you're supposed

[45:22] to be doing on the game.

[45:23] So maybe a little bit of clarity in regards to the modes and stuff would be helpful.

[45:28] But overall, I think it's a good game for them.

[45:30] I'm sure it's going to be successful.

[45:33] So it's, it's a shame it took as long as it did to, to get produced and everything.

[45:38] But I think that's kind of water under the bridge and, and I think they're just going

[45:43] to be a lot of people that, that if they love the game, they're, they're going to love

[45:46] it and they're going to want to have it.

[45:48] And then there are folks that are just a little bit more lukewarm to it.

[45:50] So I think it is a polarizing game a little bit.

[45:54] But I don't think it's a, I still think it's a success for them.

[45:57] It's, it's not a bad game.

[45:59] Right. And I think, you know, like, I think both Jersey Jack games seem to be home environment

[46:05] games, right?

[46:06] These are games that on location, you just can't get into them in the right way, right?

[46:13] They're deep games.

[46:14] They have deep rule sets.

[46:16] And you need to like, you need to hear the music.

[46:18] You need to hear the call out.

[46:19] You need to know what to do.

[46:20] There's a high learning curve.

[46:22] And for some people, that's a turn off.

[46:24] For some people, they love that.

[46:26] So I think that's where a lot of the polarization comes.

[46:29] I personally like a game where in the first 30 seconds, my adrenaline's going.

[46:34] I think that's why Ghostbusters is like, it just hooks people from the first plunge.

[46:40] But yeah, I think you're right.

[46:41] And I think with Walters game coming third with Jersey Jack and rumor that Toy Story is

[46:47] number four.

[46:49] I think that company is going to start to soar.

[46:52] You know, I really do the qualities there.

[46:54] I think they need a non-wide body.

[46:57] And I think Laura's game is going to be that.

[46:59] And if they have a killer theme like Toy Story, I think Jersey Jack, if they can get games

[47:03] out faster, which is key, they're going to have a bright future in pinball.

[47:08] Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.

[47:10] And you really just hit the nail on the head in terms of my feelings about the game also.

[47:15] When I play a machine, I do want to feel immersed in the game.

[47:19] And I want to have that adrenaline rush and really get into it.

[47:24] And that is exactly why Ghostbusters is a game that it'll be the first new inbox game

[47:29] that I buy.

[47:31] And there aren't a whole lot of games that make me feel that way.

[47:35] And the Hobbit just doesn't quite give me that feeling.

[47:38] When I play that game, the one thing I'll say about it is, while I may not know what

[47:45] I'm actually doing in terms of the modes and trying to collect bonuses and multipliers

[47:50] and stuff, I don't feel like I have trouble making any of the shots.

[47:54] It doesn't feel that challenging, honestly.

[47:57] Ghostbusters on the other hand, it can be both things of the spectrum.

[48:02] I can have one game where it just totally kicks my ass and I can't make any of the shots.

[48:07] Then I have other games where I just really start tearing it up and you really get the

[48:11] game singing at you.

[48:14] That's the kind of game I want to play.

[48:16] Well, especially when you play with friends.

[48:18] I got rid of my Lord of the Rings.

[48:19] I love it.

[48:20] I think it's one of the best pinball machines ever.

[48:22] But literally, once you get good and people who are good at pinball, they have 30 to 40

[48:27] minute balls, like one ball for 40 minutes.

[48:30] And it's like so anti-social and it's not fun.

[48:32] So, what about the big Lebowski?

[48:34] Have you played Lebowski at any of the expos?

[48:37] Have you had a chance to jump on it?

[48:39] I did.

[48:40] I finally got to play it at T-P-F this year after...

[48:44] So it was at T-P-F in 2015 and I waited in line for 45 minutes to play that game and

[48:52] it broke on the people in front of me.

[48:55] I was next in line and the game broke.

[48:58] So I didn't get to play it.

[48:59] I waited a year.

[49:01] It was back at T-P-F again this year and so I finally got to get on the game.

[49:07] It's a beautiful, beautiful game.

[49:10] I think that it definitely has the right kind of vibe that some of those 90s value Williams

[49:15] games have in terms of the way the artwork is drawn out and the abundance of toys and stuff.

[49:24] I only got to play it one time and my initial impression of the game was that I thought it

[49:29] was fun.

[49:32] I felt like there probably was more to the game than what I was able to do with it for

[49:36] that one game.

[49:39] If I had one criticism of it, once again it didn't really get my blood pumping.

[49:47] I felt like that...

[49:49] I don't think the code was really that flushed out at the time even at T-P-F this year

[49:54] and I felt like it was very one-sided.

[49:57] The narration from Sam Elliott's character of the movie was...

[50:02] Well, I think in terms of theming to the movie, it's spot on making him the narrator

[50:06] of the game but it's not something that's going to really get you excited either.

[50:13] So that was a factor that I kind of missed a little bit on the game but overall I think

[50:17] it was a really well made game.

[50:19] It felt pretty good.

[50:21] It had some great toys on it and I think it will be a successful game.

[50:26] I've shared my opinions on the bass and I mirror a lot of your sentiment and I think

[50:32] it's a beautiful game.

[50:33] I think the biggest hurdle, I just don't know if the theme is a good theme for pinball

[50:37] because it's like a cold movie that's very chilled, very sedated and it's quirky but

[50:44] to your point, it doesn't have the music that gets you going.

[50:47] It doesn't have the call outs.

[50:49] It almost makes me want to smoke a joint and drink a white rye.

[50:56] It doesn't make me want to get my palms sweaty and want to keep flipping and get through

[51:01] the story of that movie.

[51:02] I think that's an interesting thing with themes.

[51:06] Aliens, I can see where that's going to go and where that's going to dive into that

[51:11] universe and have to survive.

[51:14] I'm really excited to see where they take that.

[51:17] Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Matrix, the kinds of movies that I think lend themselves perfectly

[51:23] to pinball themes.

[51:24] I think there's movies that might not.

[51:27] Raising Arizona pinball wouldn't really be something I'd want but it's a popular movie.

[51:33] Yeah, I don't really think any of the Cohen Brothers films are really great candidates

[51:36] for a pinball machine overall but that brings up a really good point because when I approach

[51:43] a pinball machine and I think the main factor that makes me decide whether I enjoy it or

[51:49] not is how well does that game draw me into the world below that glass.

[51:55] How well does it immerse me in the theme and the environments, the lighting, the sound

[52:01] effects.

[52:03] Just kind of like movies, they are a form of escapism and pinball machines are really the

[52:08] same way.

[52:09] If it can really draw me in and distract me from everything else going on in the world

[52:14] around me even in a noisy bar or an arcade.

[52:18] I'd say that's a pretty successful theme and I think that there have been a lot of games

[52:23] that have done a great job at that.

[52:25] Ghostbusters, they just hit a grand slam with it and I think it's one of the most immersive

[52:29] games ever but the Bigelbausky is not a theme, it's not an immersive theme.

[52:37] Like you said, it's a much more laid back chill type of a theme and I don't know, maybe

[52:43] some people like that.

[52:45] For a lot of collectors, they want variety so they have so many different types of machines

[52:54] that it definitely will be a different type of game in a collection.

[52:59] I think to a good point about immersion and feeling like you're part of the universe

[53:03] of whatever the theme is, I always look at a pinball machine and I think the artwork

[53:08] to me immerses me before I even plunge.

[53:12] If you can look down and you feel like you're seeing the universe of whatever that theme

[53:15] is, that's so important.

[53:17] I think a game of Thrones is a big mess and that's been talked about Adnazia but it's

[53:24] like you look down and I always feel like I'm playing a whitewood when I play that machine

[53:28] because it's just nothing there that artistically pulls me in.

[53:33] The music does, that theme song is great, the callouts are great, the code is great but

[53:39] it all has to work together in harmony and I think Ghostbusters to your point just does

[53:44] it.

[53:45] We should see aliens who know I am look, I've been on the record and I'm always going

[53:52] to be somewhat skeptical of aliens, the artwork and whatnot but I think alien as a theme

[53:58] is killer.

[53:59] I think Highway has an opportunity here to create a game like New Other when it comes

[54:05] to space survival.

[54:08] We haven't really had a theme like that in a really long time if ever.

[54:13] What are your thoughts?

[54:14] I'm excited to see what these guys show in about like six weeks I think we're going to

[54:18] see this thing.

[54:19] Yeah, I am with you.

[54:21] I'm super excited about seeing this game.

[54:23] I know that it is a very in demand game and the community is just chomping at the bit

[54:29] to see this thing and I think that I'm really glad to see Highway in the mix with these

[54:37] other companies.

[54:38] I'm glad to see some products coming over from Europe and seeing their take on pinball.

[54:44] I do think that at the end of the day, alien will be a successful game.

[54:48] I think they're putting the love into that game and I think that they really are embracing

[54:52] the little details and what makes those movies work so well and the way that they've talked

[54:59] about the immersion of this game.

[55:02] I think that that is something that's going to be very effective on it that you may

[55:07] not necessarily get on very many games.

[55:10] I make just to see how that works.

[55:12] Now, with that said, I will say that if the game is not able to include the lightness

[55:21] rights of the cast in the film, I don't think that that is a make or break aspect of it.

[55:28] I think they can still make a phenomenal game that just focuses on the Xenomorph aspect

[55:34] and that character design and just the atmosphere of the scenery and stuff.

[55:40] I do feel like the characters are certainly a big part of those films, especially the

[55:44] first two films.

[55:47] I guess if they're in the clips and if they can be in the collots and stuff, then maybe

[55:51] that'll be fine.

[55:52] Maybe they don't need to be on the play field or the plastics or anything.

[55:58] I wouldn't want a Ghostbusters game without the Ghostbusters being on there either.

[56:03] I think that's the big thing.

[56:05] If they're in the clips and the callouts, I think that's fine, especially with the great

[56:10] screen they have and the back box and the on the play field itself, if they don't, I think

[56:17] it would be hard because what people want when it's a movie based theme, is they want

[56:22] to be curiously put themselves into those scenes and you just can't do it without the

[56:28] callouts from the characters.

[56:29] It's like if Star Wars comes out and we don't have Kylo Ren and we don't have Rey and we

[56:34] don't have Finn and we don't have like Han Solo, you need it all.

[56:38] You need Harrison Ford's Han Solo.

[56:40] You can't get a voice actor to try and recreate it.

[56:45] I think it's pretty critical to have that stuff.

[56:49] We'll see.

[56:50] I mean, I've just heard rumors both way.

[56:52] How much of a license did Highway have and it is a little head scratching because we

[56:57] see Zen Pinball come out with the alien pinball digitally and it has all the characters and

[57:02] the likenesses and how did they deal that they have.

[57:07] All of our questions will be answered soon enough.

[57:10] I don't want to speculate more.

[57:13] No, no, I hear you.

[57:15] Like I said, I think that everything that they're doing, there is a reason for it.

[57:19] Whether it involves the legal side of it or the creative side of it and if they aren't

[57:25] able to use the likeness rights, that's unfortunate, but I'm not going to write the game off.

[57:30] I think that you can compensate for that by making it a truly memorable immersive experience

[57:37] and I think that that will make people kind of forget about, oh well, this character

[57:42] really needs to be on there.

[57:43] This isn't a true alien game.

[57:44] I think that at the end of the day, the xenomorph, that's the iconic aspect of those movies.

[57:52] That's the common thread throughout all of them, other than Sigourney Weaver and it is

[57:58] a strong enough iconography that you can make a game around that without having those

[58:04] characters in the game.

[58:06] So I'm anxious to see how they do that.

[58:08] I really, really am.

[58:09] I think that I could see a lot of potential for how they're going to use those screens and

[58:14] how they're going to use the lighting and from the sound of what toys are going to be

[58:18] in the game, they're doing all the things creatively that I would have wanted to do.

[58:22] The eggs on the pop bumpers is a great idea and the xenomorph eating a ball is a great

[58:28] idea.

[58:29] Those are things that immediately pop in your head when you think of what you can do

[58:32] with an alien pinball machine.

[58:34] I agree.

[58:35] I saw a photo a couple days ago of the underneath of the play field.

[58:43] It looks like there's a lot going on.

[58:48] This is going to be a machine that's packed with goodies.

[58:52] It's going to be exciting.

[58:54] Blake, I'm always trying to keep this to an hour and we are right at the 57 minute mark

[58:59] before I get my little intro.

[59:00] This has been awesome.

[59:02] We're going to do this again real soon.

[59:04] I just love talking about the hobby with people who are up to speed on it and you are.

[59:10] I know that the listeners of this show like to have someone else's opinion go back and

[59:16] force it mine.

[59:17] It's not just me on my soapbox going on crazy rants about Pinside Babies.

[59:22] I really want to thank you for taking the time and joining Canadian pinball podcast tonight.

[59:27] Let's do this again real soon and talk about developments in the hobby.

[59:31] That sounds great, Chris.

[59:33] Thank you so much for having me on and let me chat about sort of the creative process

[59:38] that went into the Domino's game.

[59:40] We're really proud of it and we're really thrilled with the response we've gotten from

[59:44] the community so far.

[59:46] Thank you for talking about the game and keeping people up to speed on it as well.

[59:52] Yeah, no.

[59:53] I mean, I say we would ever talk about Canada because it's like Chris and Canada, my

[59:57] split personality.

[59:59] We wish spooky the best of luck with the game.

[01:00:02] We are big fans of what they have done and we just think it's any company and any brand

[01:00:07] that's putting pinball out into the world and getting more people into this great hobby

[01:00:12] should be applauded and that's what's happening with this.

[01:00:14] So it's great.

[01:00:15] Absolutely.

[01:00:16] Well, hey, man, I will welcome the chance to talk to you again on another show.

[01:00:22] I love talking about the community and keeping up with what's going on.

[01:00:25] So it's been a blast.

[01:00:26] All right.

[01:00:27] We'll talk again soon.

[01:00:28] Thank you, Blake and thank you listeners for joining this episode number 47.

[01:00:34] What was all the commotion?

[01:00:35] Oh, nothing.

[01:00:36] Just.

[01:00:37] Oh, no.

[01:00:39] Oh, no.

[01:00:40] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:42] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:46] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:51] Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:00:56] Perhaps it was the nigh who should have avoided me.
