[00:00] You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

[00:05] Sip and coffee like you're on a late night show

[00:10] But then he watched me watch the front door all night

[00:13] Willing you to come and he said it's supposed to be fun

[00:18] Turnin' 21

[00:30] Welcome to the Canadian Club

[00:32] I'm your host, Canada

[00:33] This is episode 19

[00:35] We are going back to back

[00:37] Don't say I don't love my club members

[00:40] Okay, and I said it on my Facebook

[00:42] If we get to 300

[00:44] We are going to reveal

[00:46] I say it's me, Canada, and my bipolar personality Chris

[00:49] We are going to reveal to the world

[00:51] The next stern title after rush

[00:54] Okay, and that's almost there

[00:56] We're almost there, we're like 277

[00:58] I think we only need 26 more people to join

[01:02] So grab a friend, grab a child, grab your wife

[01:05] Let's make this number 300 happen

[01:07] So on this club episode I'm going to do two things

[01:10] I'm going to tell you responses from distributors

[01:14] Based on my last club episode yesterday

[01:16] In which I said

[01:18] Why does Stern Pimball and why do Pimball companies even need distributors

[01:23] Why don't they sell directly

[01:25] With all of the people banging on their door for product

[01:28] Right? Because you don't really need a sales force

[01:31] But that's not what distributors and dealers do

[01:34] I'm going to fill you in on what I heard

[01:36] Also want to talk quickly about spooky Pimball

[01:39] The hardest company in all of Pimball to talk about

[01:43] Because if you say anything people don't want to hear

[01:46] They jump down your throat

[01:49] It is just like if you say anything negative

[01:52] About a Keith L. Winpin

[01:54] Nobody will accept it

[01:56] But surely, surely there are some out lane draining issues

[02:00] Happening in Godzilla that nobody can talk about it

[02:03] I tried to talk about it on my Facebook page

[02:06] And people go crazy

[02:08] It's unbelievable you can't say anything bad about Keith L. Win

[02:12] Okay, so here is why in a world

[02:15] In which there is supply shortages

[02:17] In a world in which so many people have come into the Pimball house

[02:21] In a world in which so many rich guys want to collect Pimball machines

[02:26] Why don't Pimball companies sell you product directly

[02:30] And the top line answer to all of that is

[02:33] They don't want to deal with the headaches that are known as customers

[02:37] They don't want to deal with all of the payments

[02:40] And the shipping information and all of this stuff

[02:43] It is so much easier for a stern Pimball to have distributors

[02:48] Who act more like they're not like the sale showroom

[02:52] They are more like the service department of a car dealership

[02:57] And if you know anything about a car dealership

[02:59] It really is the service department where the most money is made

[03:03] But it's not so much about money

[03:05] What Stern really wants is peace of mind

[03:07] So they have all of these distributors all over the world

[03:10] And all over the country in America

[03:12] And they handle the customers

[03:14] They handle the financial transactions

[03:17] They handle whenever there's an issue

[03:19] If your node board 8 goes out

[03:21] They don't want to have to have thousands of people coming after them

[03:25] In a way it basically thins out

[03:28] It thins out their responsibility

[03:31] And it's the responsibility of the distributor and the dealer

[03:34] To help out each customer

[03:36] Now luckily for Stern

[03:38] Their quality issues are pretty damn good

[03:41] So that is why Stern wants to have distributors

[03:44] They want to have dealers

[03:46] They want to have more people out there handling more customers

[03:50] And that's less work they have to do

[03:52] So it makes total sense

[03:54] There really was only one time we saw Stern sell directly

[03:58] And that was the Batman SLE

[04:00] Now still many of those ended up with distributors

[04:03] As like thank yous for all the sales of games in the past

[04:06] So that begs the question then

[04:08] Should Jersey Jack sell their next CE directly

[04:12] We all saw the debacle that happened when they did it last time

[04:15] They undercut the allocation for their distributors

[04:18] Because they sold direct

[04:20] And that caused a huge headache

[04:22] And I doubt we're going to see Jersey Jack pinball do it again

[04:25] Because if there's any company think about it

[04:27] If there's any company out there

[04:29] That wants to have a distributor and a dealer force

[04:33] That helps deal with customer service quality issues

[04:36] If there's any company out there

[04:38] That needs all the help they can get

[04:41] And keeping customers happy

[04:43] It's Jersey Jack pinball

[04:45] The number one pinball company

[04:47] With the number one number of problems in pinball

[04:51] They have the greatest quality control issues

[04:55] But it's still strange right?

[04:56] When I got my replacement play field for guns and roses

[05:00] It wasn't done through my distributor

[05:02] They still made their customers email

[05:05] Jersey Jack pinball

[05:07] And I kind of feel like why?

[05:09] Like why did they do it that way?

[05:11] It's almost like they still don't utilize their distributors

[05:15] And their dealers appropriately

[05:17] It's like they're always kind of making it up as they go

[05:20] I still think it should have been handled through to the distributor

[05:23] Like if I want to get a replacement play field for my guns and roses collector's edition

[05:28] I should have gone to Joe Newhart at pinball star

[05:31] And done everything through him

[05:34] Why am I sending emails to JJP?

[05:37] Waiting for JJP to get back to me

[05:39] No, Joe should be collecting everything from all of his customers that want replacements

[05:44] And then Joe is the single point of contact between JJP and all of those customers

[05:51] Now JJP has to deal with each individual customer

[05:55] Why did they do it that way?

[05:57] Doesn't that seem like such a bigger headache to do it that way?

[06:01] Because now when you want to know

[06:03] Where's my play field?

[06:05] They're going to get emails from all of those people versus just getting one email from Joe Newhart

[06:11] And then Joe Newhart can go back to all of his customers in one single communication and tell them what's up

[06:18] The other big thing I heard and I heard this from coin taker

[06:21] Is they pay a lot of money monthly to stern pinball

[06:25] Like they're feeding stern pinball's bank account

[06:28] And they don't want to turn that off because it's basically like guaranteed revenue every month

[06:34] And it's not just coin taker, it's all these dealers and distributors

[06:37] Stern can pretty much bank on

[06:39] We're going to get this many orders from these many dealers and distributors

[06:44] And that is our constant revenue stream

[06:47] They would never turn that off

[06:50] And as we know, as we know, the way they do it for every LEU buy

[06:55] You have to buy premiums and pros

[06:58] It's such a super smart model and it works so well for them

[07:02] Now, there's still going to be a shortage of games

[07:05] There is still going to be a shortage of supply

[07:08] And if you're new to the pinball hobby

[07:10] And you just joined this hobby this year

[07:13] Your chances of getting an LE are getting further and further away

[07:18] The good news is if there are 25 new dealers popping up in America

[07:24] That will sell stern machines

[07:26] That is your shot to get in early with those new dealers

[07:31] And try to get on there forever list for each LE machine

[07:35] You need to find a way to do that

[07:37] You have to build those relationships

[07:39] It always annoys me when people get mad that I get games

[07:43] Like I haven't built relationships with these distributors over the years

[07:47] That I haven't made 650 podcasts about pinball

[07:51] That I'm not talking to people about pinball on a weekly basis

[07:54] I make this hobby fun for thousands of people every single week

[07:59] Well, not this week because it's only the club members

[08:02] But it's fun

[08:03] And so do the other pinball podcast content creators

[08:06] And do they get special treatment?

[08:08] Absolutely!

[08:09] Should they get special treatment?

[08:11] Absolutely!

[08:12] Because there are things in life that matter more than money

[08:16] And that is relationships and that is giving something of value to people that goes beyond money

[08:22] Money is the easy part

[08:24] There are so many rich people out there that want an LE

[08:27] But if you're a distributor, are you going to give this LE to someone you've known for 10 years that you love

[08:32] Or give it to a new rich guy who just wants to become the Johnny Cum Laithley collector?

[08:37] Ain't gonna happen!

[08:38] Ain't gonna happen!

[08:39] That's the guy that's gonna buy my machine when I flip it

[08:42] That's the guy who's gonna have to spend 50% more to get Godzilla

[08:46] That's just the way it goes people

[08:48] So let's move on to spooky pinball

[08:50] I just want to say this

[08:52] I've been in the Ultraman Threads

[08:54] I've been in the Halloween Threads

[08:56] I'm an owner of an Ultraman number 500

[08:58] And I want to say that the reason why I bought Ultraman is because I wanted to support a company like spooky

[09:06] I wanted to support a company that has never ripped anybody off

[09:10] I wanted to support a company that has the best playfields in pinball

[09:14] I wanted to support a company that is always delivered

[09:18] They haven't always delivered the best games

[09:20] They haven't always delivered the most magic under glass

[09:24] But I wanted to support them

[09:26] I also fell victim to the FOMO

[09:28] And as you know, last year, I didn't like Mandalorian

[09:32] And so when these games came out in July, I ran to them

[09:36] And I felt the FOMO like I need to get one

[09:38] They're only making 500

[09:40] The truth is this now, as I look back on it

[09:42] And I have a new perspective

[09:44] 500 Ultraman is too many for this hobby

[09:48] It's too many

[09:50] It's not the kind of title that has like take my money now

[09:54] I actually went against my own advice

[09:56] I actually am somewhat embarrassed and ashamed of myself

[10:00] That I did this because I can't go on the airwaves

[10:04] For five years

[10:06] I've been saying that everybody out there that listens

[10:08] That you should buy a dream theme

[10:10] That you should buy a game that's a world under glass

[10:12] That you should buy a game that has magical toys and real engineering

[10:16] That you should buy a game that emotionally moves you

[10:20] And ultimately creates pinball moments you'll never forget

[10:24] If I go down that list of all of those things

[10:28] I've been saying you should look for in a pinball machine

[10:30] This game delivers on none of them for me

[10:34] None of them, it's not a dream theme

[10:36] It doesn't have this magical world under glass

[10:38] There's no magical toy in the game

[10:40] There is absolutely no modes or codes or callouts right now

[10:44] That are memorable

[10:46] There's absolutely nothing that it checks other than

[10:50] Beautiful artwork

[10:52] Other than a company that I want to support

[10:54] Be a good will

[10:56] And other than it's Japanese base

[10:58] So it's perfect for my Japanese Neo Tokyo arcade

[11:02] But it is gorgeous

[11:04] And there's a reason why Spooky showed us the gorgeous artwork

[11:08] And didn't show us the gameplay

[11:10] Because they knew

[11:12] If they showed people playing the game

[11:14] They knew if they showed where these games were code wise

[11:18] They were not going to get

[11:20] 1750 people to buy them

[11:23] Day one if they showed that

[11:25] They knew that

[11:26] And it was smart like chucking company

[11:28] Super smart

[11:29] I mean they made at least

[11:31] $1.75 million in one day

[11:33] They made more than that

[11:35] Because some of the deposits were $2000

[11:37] They made that in one day

[11:39] A company that couldn't sell

[11:41] A 150 America's most haunted for almost two years

[11:45] So it was super smart

[11:47] And as a marketer

[11:49] When you go into a room and you say

[11:51] Hey, we gotta launch this thing

[11:53] We gotta keep the line moving

[11:55] We don't have the code anywhere near

[11:57] To be what should we do?

[11:59] Well here's what we should do

[12:01] The games look beautiful

[12:03] Let's just reveal the themes

[12:05] We'll reveal the beautiful artwork

[12:07] On the play field and on the cabinet

[12:09] But we won't show any of the software

[12:11] And it's exactly what they did

[12:13] And we have nobody to blame

[12:15] I mean this, none of us

[12:17] Who are feeling somewhat anxious now

[12:19] We have nobody to blame but ourselves

[12:21] Spooky didn't make us buy these games

[12:23] Spooky didn't make us like give money

[12:25] We knew we didn't see gameplay

[12:27] We knew we didn't see any code

[12:29] We knew we didn't hear any callouts

[12:31] We knew this, we didn't know how many assets were in Halloween

[12:33] We have no idea what's even in Ultraman

[12:35] I mean there is no way

[12:37] There are 500 diehard Ultraman fans

[12:41] Out there who bought these machines

[12:43] No, it looks fun

[12:45] It looks campy but is the game great

[12:47] We didn't know and yet we bought it

[12:49] And that is a primary example

[12:51] Of how FOMO works

[12:53] And it got too many of us

[12:55] And it got too many of us

[12:57] How am I feeling right now?

[12:59] I'm not really anxious because

[13:01] Look, I think I'm probably gonna end up losing

[13:03] At least 500 bucks on this game

[13:05] If I want to get out on Ultraman 500

[13:07] There's no way I'm getting out at sticker price

[13:09] There's no way

[13:11] There's no way

[13:13] There's too many of them

[13:15] There's too many Halloween's out there

[13:17] People don't really want these games right now

[13:19] And if you look at the Apologists

[13:21] And I see them on Pinside

[13:23] This is a bad sign

[13:25] The game just came out

[13:27] Guess what other game just came out

[13:29] Godzilla

[13:31] Look at what's happening with the enthusiasm around Godzilla

[13:33] And look what's happening around the enthusiasm with this game

[13:37] You can't get a Godzilla anywhere near sticker price

[13:39] Godzilla came out

[13:41] It's the number one ranked game of all time

[13:45] On Pinside

[13:47] Halloween comes out

[13:49] The ninth ranked game of all time on Pinside

[13:53] And if you look at the Halloween ranking

[13:55] It's deceiving because there's only 15

[13:57] But I've spoken to a lot of people

[13:59] They're not happy but they're not doing reviews

[14:01] And that's the other part

[14:03] Is like people have this sort of

[14:05] Thumper approach to pinball companies

[14:07] If you can say something nice about a pinball machine

[14:09] Or a pinball company

[14:11] Don't say anything at all

[14:13] And I'm telling you right now

[14:15] On this Club episode

[14:17] Because they're not really hearing the feedback

[14:21] The way they need to hear it

[14:23] And here is my feedback for spooky pinball

[14:25] You need to buy the games of your competitors

[14:27] You need to buy stern games

[14:29] And Jersey Jack games

[14:31] And you are now at a price point

[14:33] Where your games are close enough to all these games

[14:37] That you need to say to yourself

[14:39] How do we get our games to be at this standard

[14:41] It is not impossible

[14:43] To find illustrators in this world

[14:45] There are so many illustrators that can code for a pinball machine

[14:49] It's not just the guy in France doing Jersey Jack games

[14:53] It's not just who Stern has

[14:55] There are so many computer graphic designers that could make

[14:59] The animations in these games amazing

[15:01] There is no excuse

[15:03] There's no excuse

[15:05] And if you look at who they hired for Halloween

[15:07] Like go look at that company is like website

[15:09] They got what they paid for

[15:11] That's the level of animations

[15:13] He does and it is what it is

[15:15] And I'm not here like slam the guys company

[15:17] That's his talent level

[15:19] But for an 8 to 10,000 dollar pinball machine

[15:23] And then you look at what Stern has in its games

[15:25] You look at what J.J.P has

[15:27] You look at what CGC has

[15:29] Heck even like American pinball

[15:31] Before Legends of a Hala that has no animations

[15:33] They need to get this company

[15:37] Further along in the software department

[15:39] They also need to hire more people that understand engineering

[15:43] And put more into the games

[15:45] And I'm saying this

[15:47] Not because I'm trying to rag on spooky

[15:49] I'm saying this because I want spooky games to get better

[15:53] And we need to stop with this like

[15:55] Oh it's cruel to do that

[15:57] And I hear people say like

[15:59] Kaneda is turning on them now by saying

[16:01] There's no turning on them

[16:03] They've been around for seven years

[16:05] They're making a lot of money now

[16:07] They can make a decent amount of games a year

[16:11] But the fact that when you look at what's on the screen

[16:13] And you see the coding of the game

[16:15] You realize like man these guys really bit off way more than they could chew

[16:19] Way more

[16:21] It is hard enough to code one game at a time

[16:25] Was spooky pinball the company that could code two games at the same time

[16:29] Using the same rule set with different assets on radically different themes

[16:35] Like who thought that was a good idea

[16:37] We're gonna make two games with the same layout

[16:41] The same rule set

[16:43] And then we're gonna have to use radically different assets

[16:47] And make all the modes work in each

[16:49] That sounds so much harder than just doing what they should have done

[16:55] Which is make a thousand holoweens

[16:57] Make it its own game

[16:59] Code it everything a dedicated team to holoween

[17:03] And make a separate ultra man game

[17:05] I don't even think you should use the same layout

[17:07] But if you wanted to find use the same layout

[17:09] But it needed to be completely done differently

[17:13] Two separate teams working on two separate games

[17:17] If I call the meeting

[17:19] I would say team A, you're on holoween

[17:21] You focus on this game

[17:23] Team B, you're on ultra man

[17:25] You do what you want

[17:27] Don't even compare notes

[17:29] I want these games taken in the direction

[17:31] That's gonna do these themes justice

[17:33] And I don't want you to talk to each other

[17:35] I want you to make each of these games amazing

[17:37] I don't even want you to think about the fact that they're both the same design

[17:41] I don't, I want you individually

[17:43] To make this the greatest holoween experience possible

[17:47] And I want you to make this the greatest ultra man experience possible

[17:51] And that is how you need to do it

[17:53] You can't have Phasma sitting in the middle of both of these games

[17:57] Trying to figure out how to do it

[17:59] Because that's why we're getting what we're getting right now

[18:01] You're getting each on tray is half baked

[18:03] And he can't possibly cook both of these

[18:07] At the same time

[18:09] And all of the apologists hate that I'm saying this

[18:11] All of the apologists call this toxic and controversial

[18:15] No, this is common sense

[18:17] This is common sense

[18:19] If this was the way to do it

[18:21] We would see other companies do this

[18:23] We're not

[18:25] I think Spooky got ahead of themselves

[18:27] I think they were looking at the money and the number of games they could make

[18:31] And I think they jumped too far ahead

[18:33] They went from 750 games to a thousand more than that

[18:37] 1700 and 50

[18:39] But I don't think they really got in a room and said

[18:43] Hey, are we putting too much pressure on manufacturing

[18:47] And we're not going to have enough time to actually make these games magical

[18:51] We're not going to have enough time to take these games in the right direction from a code standpoint

[18:55] Do we have enough people in house who know how to do this?

[18:59] We are a young team

[19:01] We have lost some experienced people

[19:03] Do we have the ability to do this?

[19:05] And I think what we're witnessing right now

[19:07] Is they are building the ship in the ocean

[19:11] The ship has already been sold out

[19:13] Every room is spoken for on this ship

[19:15] But this ship is being built at sea

[19:19] And we don't know if it's going to be an amazing journey

[19:23] Or if it's going to sink

[19:25] And I'm not sure

[19:27] I'm not here to say that these games are going to stink

[19:29] I don't know but what I do know is this

[19:31] I don't want to have to wait 18 months to know

[19:35] Whether or not I made a good decision

[19:37] I want to know on day one

[19:39] This game is awesome

[19:41] That's what Godzilla was

[19:43] Day one, this game is awesome

[19:45] Guns and roses, day one

[19:47] This game is awesome

[19:49] Lord of the Rings, day one

[19:51] This is awesome, Tron, day one

[19:53] This game is awesome, you can go down the list of games

[19:55] Day one, this game is awesome

[19:59] If you're going to reveal a game

[20:01] And you're going to put it out on location

[20:03] I mean people forget this

[20:05] They ship these games on location

[20:07] With some of the buggyest software

[20:09] They had no business being on location

[20:11] They're not ready for prime time yet

[20:15] You can't put them in barcaids

[20:17] And have the code crashing left and right

[20:19] What is going on?

[20:21] Can Aida Club, episode 19

[20:23] Tell your friends to join the club

[20:25] I'm only one cup of coffee in

[20:27] Have an amazing Thanksgiving everybody

[20:29] I love you and I love talking about this hobby with you

[20:33] We'll be back later

[20:35] Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

[20:39] I'd like to be my old self again

[20:41] But I'm still trying to find it

[20:43] After a pleasure days

[20:45] And nights when you made me

[20:47] Your own

[20:49] Now you mail back my things

[20:51] And I walk home alone

[20:53] But you keep my old scarf

[20:55] From that very first week

[20:57] Cause it reminds you of innocence

[20:59] And it smells like me

[21:01] You can't get rid of it

[21:03] Cause you remember it all too well

[21:07] Yeah
