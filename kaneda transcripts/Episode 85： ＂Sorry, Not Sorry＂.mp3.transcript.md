[00:00] Is it really not a safe story?

[00:03] Yeah, I know I'm on it, I've been checked out,

[00:06] Is it really just a safe story?

[00:08] Now it's...

[00:16] Did you ever think we'd make it to episode 85 of

[00:19] Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[00:20] I know that a lot of people thought that when I started this,

[00:23] it would be a complete failure.

[00:25] And for many people out there, it probably is considered that.

[00:28] But for a lot of you, around five to 800,

[00:33] a week, I think you guys get great enjoyment in this podcast.

[00:37] So I thank you for listening and tuning into this show.

[00:40] On this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, episode 85,

[00:44] I'm going to call it sorry, not sorry.

[00:46] And I'm going to talk about just the overall sort of mood of the pinball

[00:52] industry and the hobby and the collector hobby in general

[00:55] and what I think is going on.

[00:57] I want to thank some of my listeners.

[01:00] I'm going to read some of the listener feedback that I've been

[01:02] getting recently.

[01:03] So I encourage you guys to email me and we will

[01:06] read your comments out on air.

[01:08] That's always exciting.

[01:10] We'll talk a little bit about Alien, a little bit about...

[01:15] Let's see what else is going on.

[01:16] Big Lebowski, a little bit about Kevin Koolik,

[01:19] a little bit about some for sale thread that is really

[01:24] interesting when you look at what's going on inside it.

[01:28] So let's start off with why I'm saying this is sorry,

[01:31] not sorry podcast.

[01:33] Just to be honest with you, the listener, because I always

[01:36] am pretty direct and honest with you, I've been getting some

[01:40] feedback that I've upset certain manufacturers in the pinball hobby.

[01:44] And I think you could guess who they are and that

[01:47] stuff I'm saying could be considered to be slanderous or

[01:50] libel by the words I'm saying.

[01:53] And I kind of scratched my head a little bit because

[01:56] I think recently I've done a better job.

[01:58] I will admit, I will apologize, I will say I'm sorry that in the past,

[02:03] I have had some podcasts that were pretty personal,

[02:06] pretty laser focused and pretty juvenile.

[02:10] And we deleted a lot of those podcasts and we sort of turned a

[02:13] chapter.

[02:14] I think since I've been back, things have been

[02:17] better. I think it'd been more fair in my assessment of companies and my

[02:23] critique of what goes on with pinball manufacturers.

[02:26] But I've noticed something that happens time and time again.

[02:30] And that is, there is this notion that when you give a company your money

[02:36] and they don't deliver the product that at that point,

[02:41] there's two camps form. One camp is the camp that cheerleads the company,

[02:47] waves the company's flag. And basically says

[02:52] we need to support them because they're making pinball.

[02:54] And that is the job of a pinball fan is to support companies that are making

[02:59] machines, right? Then you have the other side of the camp that

[03:03] is anxious, is nervous, is wondering, should we be asking tough questions and

[03:08] should we be asking what's going on with this company? And ultimately,

[03:12] should we hold a company to its word and when they do things that

[03:17] go against the word, should we should we voice our concerns?

[03:21] Right. And again, as I've said before, none of this really matters that much, right?

[03:26] At the end of the day, what I've been thinking about over the last three to

[03:29] four days is ultimately, if you have your money with a company,

[03:33] you really are the only one that should be truly concerned,

[03:38] that should be truly nervous or truly excited because you're either going to

[03:41] get a game or you're going to wait for a game or you're not going to get a game, right?

[03:46] Those are the three sort of states that all pinball buyers find themselves in lately, right?

[03:52] You're either waiting, you're either getting your game or you're not getting your game.

[03:57] And two out of the three of those is really frustrating and really annoying.

[04:02] And so it doesn't mean that if you don't have money in on a project though,

[04:08] that you're not allowed to talk about the project, right? And that has been

[04:13] debated back and forth many times on Pinsa. You hear people all the time say,

[04:18] you're not even in on the game, why are you even saying anything in this thread?

[04:22] And we're seeing that a little bit in the alien thread play out. I know Rob T has been

[04:28] pretty vocal about his concerns with highway pinball and people have said,

[04:32] like, look, man, you're not even in on it. And I think his response is fair.

[04:37] It's that I'm interested in this theme. I love alien. It's a dream theme of mine.

[04:43] Am I not allowed to come in here and ask what's going on?

[04:48] Simply because partially because he might want one. And partially because the questions he's

[04:54] asking are not unfair. And yes, when you do ask tough questions of a company. You are going

[05:00] to be accused of slanting negative, of trying to be on some sort of, and it's not even like a

[05:07] witch hunt. You're just seen as as as not being a fan that you're not championing the process.

[05:14] So on the last podcast or last few podcasts, I asked people one question. I said, look, you know,

[05:21] we are long delayed on alien. They are clearly working on it. We see the production video.

[05:26] I'm not debating any of this. I have debated the timeline and what exactly is going on.

[05:33] And when when I last left you, I asked people, I asked and no one did this. Nobody did this.

[05:38] And I have to say this. I got a lot of responses from people when I asked about something else.

[05:43] And I'm going to when I asked about my toad in switch. And I'm going to call you guys out that

[05:47] actually helped me and gave me responses in a little bit. But I asked people, I said, look,

[05:53] if you could do one favor, just go in and ask, was the Ellie artwork submitted for alien Ellie?

[06:00] And the reason I asked that question and I don't want to beat this dead horse.

[06:05] But I just think it's a fair question to ask because I know that in September, you guys got emails

[06:11] saying the games are ready for production. We need you to pay in full. And if at that point,

[06:17] the Ellie artwork was not submitted, I don't see how that is something that should just fly

[06:24] under the radar. I think people should be asking questions like this. And look, but I'm at the point

[06:28] now where it's all on the buyers of this machine now. You guys can decide whether or not you're

[06:37] comfortable with the journey or you're not. And I think the people that are love this theme and are

[06:42] in on it are going to stay in on it. And that's fine. That's fine. But if you listen, if you listen to

[06:51] some of the comments, it's pretty clear that the Ellie artwork probably was either just finished or

[06:58] was not submitted by last week. So that's it. I think I'm kind of done talking about alien. Some of you

[07:05] out there might be kind of sick of me mentioning it. But the reason I have mentioned it and have

[07:12] brought it up is it's basically when we look at the games that are coming out this year, it is the

[07:18] next game that should be out any week now. And so it's newsworthy. It's an interesting topic.

[07:25] And I really hope everybody gets their games. I really want to see the game being played. I saw

[07:32] a gameplay video was released this week. A new one that people hadn't seen before. And I'll say this,

[07:40] it looks like the game is going to have a really good light show. I think the lighting is really

[07:44] cool. I want to see more of it. I know you guys want to see more of it. And I hope they get everything

[07:50] in order soon. And I hope they get games out. I really think they're going to have to get out by

[07:56] T.P.F. And it's crazy saying that because we were saying back in the summer, they've got to get

[08:01] this out by Expo. But T.P.F in March seems to be the date where aliens should be shipping. And

[08:09] games will probably come to the show in box for people to buy. So let's see what happens there. But

[08:13] we're going to keep them to their word. I haven't really heard much new conversation or words from

[08:20] Andrew or Orrick or the people over there. A few little things here and there. But let's see what

[08:25] happens. Okay. Canada is not the bad guy. Canada is not on a witch hunt for this company.

[08:30] Andrew has full power to ship his games. And there's nothing I can do to stop that. And I can't make

[08:36] people do what they will do with their money. And that's just the way it is. And I think if you think

[08:40] I've been unfair or singled them out in any unique way or made up facts or do whatever you think,

[08:46] I'm happy to have you on the show to talk about it. I got no emails from people who are in

[08:52] Onalien or even many comments about it. So I take it you guys somewhat feel the same way I do

[08:59] about these companies who take money and then don't deliver. So let's talk about Dutch Pimble.

[09:05] Because I'm concerned about Dutch. As much as I've sort of been wav- waving some red flags with

[09:11] highway. I don't know how you feel anything but panic about what's going on at Dutch Pimble

[09:18] these days. The AKA nothing seems to be going on right now. It seems that games are built but

[09:25] waiting for boards and it's been months. But it's not that that's really got people concerned.

[09:33] It's the fact that there's zero communication. And I really feel bad. I think if rare hero

[09:40] doesn't get his the big Lebowski this entire hobby could just implode- no but he- it's just

[09:46] it's incredible to me that this game has sort of been frozen on the assembly line and nothing

[09:54] is being communicated to its owners. And I just think that's wrong. I think it's wrong and I think

[09:59] it shows or speaks volumes about the people running Dutch Pimble. How can you build a company

[10:08] with customer service like this? And again I really want so many people to be out of this state

[10:15] of waiting. Of waiting in pain to hear from their manufacturer about when they might get their

[10:22] game. We saw people wait for years for for was and years for Hobbit years for Alien years for

[10:31] the big Lebowski years right years. And I think that state of waiting and agonizing and being

[10:39] anxious. I didn't even talk about predator or magic girl or Razor right. I mean it's there's far

[10:45] more titles that people have stressed out over than I think they've truly enjoyed. And I think

[10:53] I think it's really chipping away at the fun of the hobby. And I do hope by the end of this year

[11:03] that we can get to a point where all this nonsense stops. I just I really think it's nonsense.

[11:09] I think it's absolute nonsense that people spend money and that are left in a suspended state

[11:17] of anxiety and frustration. Well it's just not worth it. It just it just doesn't seem

[11:24] that any of you hear something. I don't blame the buyers because you guys are like you're like

[11:28] drug addicts. Like you're like addicted to Pimble right. I mean anyone who comes on the Pinside

[11:34] anyone who collects Pimble machines like that's your thing like your drug is Pimble. And so when

[11:40] someone promises you a new Pimble machine you you wave money at them like you're waving money

[11:45] at a drug dealer and you're an addict and you're like take my money now. Take my money now.

[11:49] I mean people paid in full paid in full for magic girl Raza and Alice in Wonderland people paid

[11:57] for all three in full before anything was even done on any of them. People paid in full

[12:03] in predator. People paid in full in alien Ellie. People paid in full on the big Lebowski.

[12:08] People have paid in full on on P3 and and the question the question is why? Why do people wave

[12:16] money and then let themselves feel like shit for a really long period of time. Remember when

[12:23] Ghostbusters had like some delays like six month delay five month delay and people were stressing

[12:31] out but no one really felt like Stern wasn't going to get them their Ghostbusters right. So that

[12:36] was like you're frustrated but you never felt like your money could be gone. I think with everybody

[12:43] else with everybody else the fear is also that my money might be gone. It doesn't mean anything.

[12:52] If a company has made a game before it doesn't matter making Pimble's hard it's expensive

[12:59] and things can go wrong. Yes if you have financial backing and you can you can you can

[13:05] you can weather storms and you can handle a setback then fine but your money is never safe

[13:14] unless there's a physical game that you can touch with your hands and you see it with your eyes

[13:20] and it's real and you can take it home and even then you might get burned on a bad cell but

[13:25] you know what I'm saying I think people are starting to realize I think they're starting to

[13:29] realize that the new inbox chase is really it really is a race to the bottom in terms of how you'll

[13:37] feel emotionally and the more new inboxes you just keep buying and buying and buying I think it's

[13:43] like cigarettes right the less each one actually creates a high for you like that high is so short

[13:51] live and then you're on to the next on to the next and the promise of boutique Pimble I've said it

[13:56] before I think the promise of boutique Pimble has failed it's totally failed and it has yet to

[14:03] deliver games quick enough and it is yet to deliver the quality consistent Pimble that everyone is

[14:13] looking for when it comes to boutique and again when I say that I take spooky out of that all right

[14:20] so I am not sorry that this podcast will go after individuals who manufacture games who make

[14:30] mistakes or say things that are not accurate I'm not sorry anymore when I read people's anxieties

[14:36] and frustrations when they're buying new inbox I think we're at a stage now guys where everyone

[14:42] just needs to just hold on your money and wait it was my first Pimble was Lord of the Rings

[14:49] Ellie it was what it was old it was a used game it had few plays on it the code was finished

[14:58] and I've had I had fun with it since day one my second Pimble machine was a Tales of the

[15:03] Rear Arabian Knights it was real it came from someone in Canada and it worked until I broke it

[15:12] and then fixed it but it's always been a real game my money went to someone in a week later I

[15:17] had a game that's how it should be that's how it should be I walk into game stop and I walk out

[15:24] with a great game that brings me hours of joy that's how my entertainment toys should be I go to

[15:29] Dodge and I give them money for a Hellcat and I got my Hellcat when they said I'd get my Hellcat

[15:35] I think it's absolutely gotta be fatiguing and just destroying people the weights all right so

[15:42] will people do it will people wise up a little bit this year and stop throwing their money at every

[15:48] new thing they say the answer is probably no it probably will remain the same and people will

[15:54] continue to moan and groan now back to Dutch what do you do if you're in on the Lebowski as anyone

[16:01] even asked for a refund I haven't heard anyone say like I asked for a refund I didn't get it so

[16:07] I think the guys who are in on this they're just sort of like nothing I can do I'm powerless

[16:12] they're not getting back to me I'm just gonna stay in on it I've waited this long and what's a

[16:18] little bit longer it's crazy too because coin taker I know had one for sale a week or two ago I could

[16:24] have bought it I was offered to buy it I almost thought like man what if Dutch goes under and I got

[16:29] a Lebowski it'll probably be worth a ton one day but I don't want to buy a game like that under those

[16:36] premise you know under that premise and I don't want to I've never I still think the Lebowski code is

[16:42] so it's not there I'm with all the time it's taken I wish the game sort of spoke to me more

[16:48] it was more energetic but I just I kind of want to go to bed when I play the game it's a beautiful

[16:53] game I love it I think it's a world under glass I just think the code needs to wake the player up more

[16:58] and be a little bit more exciting but anyway I think Dutch needs to get their shit together they

[17:04] need to respond at our customers you took people's money man you took $8500 from people some people

[17:10] paid more respond to them respond all right what else is going on that I want to talk about on

[17:16] this episode so let me do some let me do some shout outs to the people who reached out to me and

[17:21] helped me with my totem switch so I want to read some from feedback from you guys let's see

[17:27] I got a nice email from Joe 86 he said so glad you're back doing the podcast zombie Eddie podcast was phenomenal

[17:37] uh in regard to episode 81 you had mentioned that ACDC could be a ve have you heard if it's the normal

[17:46] premium or the Lucy version have you heard anything about a Tron ve had two people tell me it's

[17:53] definitely going to happen so uh Joe 86 s s thank you for listening to Canadian Spinball podcast and

[18:04] I don't know really what the next V is from Stern I think there should there probably will be

[18:11] another VE this year if it's ACDC and it's just a remake of one of the ones that was already

[18:18] released I think that would kind of bore me I I am curious to see if Stern does one thing with the

[18:25] next round of vaults I'm curious to see if they put the LCD in them and find a way to move the

[18:33] game over to spike system to me that makes the most sense I kind of what don't want to see a Tron

[18:41] VE that has just the dots I really don't and I also think Tron might be the throwback to the original

[18:48] Disney movie but we'll see we've been hearing about Tron VE for years and it never materialized so

[18:56] I think Stern it just dangles that in front of us and I'm going to talk a little bit about remakes

[19:02] and VEs but I just I don't know there's no one knows anything you know when you say you hear from

[19:07] two people yep we all got friends who say stuff but at the end of the day nobody really knows

[19:15] all right I got a nice response from Louis Francois Roy I hope I said that right it's probably

[19:23] French you said Chris another great show I'm a fan because you're intelligent honestly keep up the

[19:29] podcast Robin should pay you you are the reason I still care about Pinside I'm not lying people I

[19:35] know it sounds like I made this one up but um Louis thank you so much no Robin does it need to pay

[19:42] me I'm handsomely employed I would I like to be back on Pinside would I like to be back on Pinside

[19:49] the answer is yes I never thought I should have been banned at all I don't think that I do anything

[19:57] that's any worse than anyone who's on there and I always told Robin like you let Canada back on

[20:03] and there's no more duplicate accounts there's no more nefarious behavior I will do what I do

[20:09] but the problem is is Robin said he'll never let me back on Pinside if I ever call out Pinside members

[20:17] on my podcast so I just don't really wish to allow him to dictate my material right Pinside says he

[20:26] can ban me that's cool my show is my show and I just I don't let anyone tell me what I'm going to

[20:34] do on my show this is my show on my terms so but if you want me back on Pinside hit Robin up tell

[20:41] him like why don't you let Canada back on it's been long enough right all right so I got a nice note

[20:48] from Jason Jason I see I don't want to butcher people's last names Jason I'm going to try and

[20:55] pronounce in birch birch if you I buy the Birk Birk fill Jason sorry I probably just

[21:01] butcher your last name but he said can you to actor listening to your recent episode devils

[21:06] abdakit I was thinking about the alien Elise what if the artwork isn't being shown because Andrew

[21:12] is trying to renegotiate a Ripley edition for the Ellie it would make sense that he is keeping

[21:19] quiet if he talked about it and couldn't come through with it people would bash them pretty hard

[21:24] all right and he says I remember how I've said people were that Ripley wasn't shown on the

[21:28] machine so what if so I I can't imagine that to be the case I can't imagine they would do that

[21:38] it would mainly because I think would would I want that yes I still fail to see how alien

[21:46] can take place without Ripley right I get that her likeness is not on the on the game but the

[21:51] fact that they're not even using her clips or her voice or her callouts I don't know how you do

[21:55] it I've told people it's like making Batman without Batman the first alien movie is all about Ripley

[22:01] so I think that was a huge blow and and the marketer in me if I found out that I could make an

[22:06] alien pinball machine but I couldn't use Ripley I wouldn't move on to a different theme I would have

[22:13] I just don't think you're gonna really capture those movies without her but I do not think that

[22:20] they're negotiating for a so-go any weaver I I don't know for sure why she said no because we

[22:25] saw her likeness in the Zen pinball games so we know she's amenable to that we also saw her likeness

[22:33] in Ghostbusters and I still speculate I could be wrong I think Gary like locked her down and got her

[22:40] to exclusively appear only on his pinball machine but I'm not sure I'm just making that up

[22:45] they don't hold me to it you're gonna hear tons of fake news on Canada's pinball podcasts

[22:50] but Jason thank you for listening to this show all right let me go so I want to thank Jimmy

[22:56] Jimmy Meyer for offering me help on the toad in switch I'm looking for so some of you know my

[23:04] toad in roll over switch by the where the ball locks isn't good and I got tons of people who

[23:10] replied with the part number and where to order it and Jimmy I want to thank you I also want to

[23:17] thank Mike Mike chimed in Mike Dennis Dennis I'm really sorry guys like really you need to like

[23:25] you need to like give me the phonical pronunciation of your names but Mike also hit me up and

[23:32] gave me the part to toad in so Mike I really appreciate that let's see Kevin Sanborn Kevin thank you

[23:40] for getting me the toad in switch part we also got one from Skylar he also gave me the part

[23:50] so it's it's it was awesome I mean I said this this is what I miss about pinside is when you have an

[23:56] issue how quick the community is to help but it goes to show like even without being on pinside I got

[24:02] a lot of great listeners out there who who helped me out which is great um all right so I want

[24:09] to also give a shout out to listener Todd Anderson Todd thank you for listening to get it

[24:14] canate pinball podcast Todd wrote to me and said you had me laughing my ass off while I was driving

[24:20] down the highway today the commentary on talking to friends in a bar about the situation with

[24:25] Jersey Jack and I'll leave you're right you would get punched in the face gotta say a lot of

[24:32] your commentary on the state of the industry is pretty much spot on and the dramatic concerns

[24:37] constantly expressed by a core of pinciders are utterly ridiculous almost embarrassingly so

[24:43] people need to regain perspective you voiced my own interest in pinball so well something along

[24:49] the lines of being entertained by magic happening in a world under glass to take it a little

[24:55] further I like to take these machines apart to see how they work all right a little scary he says

[25:02] when people start talking to life and death levels it's fun to be entertained but seriously this

[25:07] most certainly isn't life death or the end all be all of existence Todd thank you for that note

[25:13] and I agree it's just pinball and I think pinball machines should be a world under glass and I

[25:21] think most people agree and I think most people agree and I just want to think most people aren't

[25:25] very happy right now they really aren't happy I think you're going to see the price of Williams

[25:31] games continue to increase as people begin to realize that they've been duped they've been duped

[25:39] by so many of these new titles and they've paid so much money for stuff that delivers so little

[25:45] magic and they'll realize over time that the magic just isn't there in a lot of these new games

[25:52] and these games are either rushed out or corners are cut but I just think there's a lack of creativity

[25:58] let me give you guys an idea I'm going to throw something out there because I was talking to my

[26:01] friend about this and I was talking about how there just is not that much creativity in pinball

[26:08] these days that it's very cookie cutter that you know there's only a few people really trying to

[26:13] push the envelope and I'm going to give Jerry a p3 credit people trying to innovate do things a

[26:19] little bit differently or even just look at a pinball machine and just make a world under glass

[26:24] happen and I was we were talking about themes and I said you know I'm really I'm really concerned about

[26:31] like the themes that we have to buy from right now there just aren't that many great themes and I

[26:38] get that even if a license is expensive why not go rebuild the classic theme that would sell that

[26:46] is evergreen and the theme that I was like why doesn't someone make king Kong right king Kong

[26:52] is an amazing theme there was what eight prototype king Kong machines made back in the day they

[26:59] were never really finished but what a great theme all right and I was like and I was thinking about

[27:06] it creatively like here's how I would make king Kong and I would I think there needs to be guys who

[27:12] just think this way and then hand it to the engineers and say make it happen if we do this we'll sell

[27:17] 5,000 of them so king Kong should be a game that has the play field the upper half of the play field

[27:26] should rotate and here's what I would do the whole upper half should flip over somehow and here's

[27:31] what I would do you have it so that the first half of the game you're playing and the objectives are

[27:39] all about getting Kong off the island and so the shots at the back like the bash toy would be this

[27:47] you know this wall this big wall that you got to open up and get Kong and and get him to the wall

[27:53] to then like tranquilize him and and take him off the island right but your your first

[27:59] series of modes are all dedicated to that and then when that happens the back portion of the play

[28:05] field rotates over it flips over and all of a sudden we've got the New York skyline and you're

[28:11] your king Kong in the city and you got to get you got to get Kong off the building and he climbs up

[28:18] it and you got to hit the targets and he falls down and there's actually like a little mechanical

[28:23] ape that climbs up the building and falls down like just cool world under glass kind of shit

[28:29] I can dream right I know some of you engineers out there like that's impossible anything you can

[28:34] make this stuff can happen this stuff can happen the problem is right now we live in in the pinball

[28:42] world the new unbox games what people are putting out stern has got a formula and they know now

[28:50] that if they just switch the artwork up and go about doing it business as usual I don't think

[28:56] you're going to see extreme levels of creativity I really don't I think you're going to see great

[29:00] artists I hope I see high levels of creativity but I have yet to see anything truly truly truly

[29:09] that made me be like wow the Magnus Lings and Ghostbusters did that some of the other stuff but I

[29:16] don't think we're going to see it you know I don't think we're going to see it until you know

[29:21] I hope Jersey Jack brings it back with I think Donaldins kind of there but I have big hopes for

[29:26] toy story really big hopes all right let me see any other feedback here Leon months Moncla Leon

[29:37] Leon he also gave me the switch in the part number gave me the phone number to Marco or

[29:43] not the phone number the partner see this is why I'm like an idiot I thought that was the phone

[29:47] number to Marco is the part number but thank you Aaron Nicholis also hit me up with links to

[29:55] where to buy the part I'm just trying to call it everyone who who who hit me up with my tone

[30:00] all right so I want to also thank Philip from Switzerland emailed me and Philip said

[30:10] let's see talked about how he got in the pinball recently and he got seven pins from a from an

[30:15] operator who's went out of business he got an road show in episode one or revenge from Mars a

[30:20] Harley Davis in a junkyard Indy 500 NBA fast break all for $6,000 and they've been fixing

[30:27] him up which is great many wrote I don't want to bore you with all this nonsense to keep a long

[30:34] story short I started looking for some pinball podcasts found yours by accident downloaded it and

[30:39] had a smile on my face during the whole thing it was so funny how you got in a rage about those

[30:45] form guys you know I'm on some arcade form so I know these kind of guys as well you spoke for my

[30:51] heart being a lawyer myself and a family father I met some of these guys in person and it was not

[30:58] the most impressive but there are exceptions of course so thanks canate it for some entertaining

[31:04] funny and informative podcasts since I start listening to you I almost ordered a ghostbuster

[31:09] premium and thought about starting my own pinball factory which would of course been the dumbest

[31:14] thing ever my wife is very grateful so yeah I think I've talked some people making terrible

[31:21] career decisions and focusing too much on pinball but thank you thank you my friend from Switzerland

[31:27] for listening to canate his pinball podcast you know look I I love hearing from you guys I love

[31:33] hearing from you guys and I have some guests that are going to be coming on the show soon I'm trying

[31:37] to get Keith Owen on George Gomez owes me a visit I know zombie Eddie whispered in his year to come

[31:42] on Jersey Jack owes a visit Andrew highway has an invitation that's outstanding so look look it's

[31:50] it's always great when when I hear that you guys are enjoying this show because I need to hear it too

[31:55] I got I got to be honest there are days when I'm like I you know I don't really know if I want to

[31:59] always do this forever but it is the fact that I know a lot of you get enjoyment out of it that keeps

[32:05] me going so the last part I want to talk about on this episode is a four-sale thread in

[32:14] about Big Bang Bar and I don't know if you saw this on Pinside but there is a Big Bang Bar that is

[32:21] up for sale for 20 grand and I mentioned it before but I wanted to go into that thread because it

[32:26] was interesting seeing that this guy who's selling it you know he just can't catch a break it seems

[32:36] he's he I think he listed one of the greatest four-sale threads it's it's it's highly descriptive

[32:43] he writes out everything he has more than enough pictures to show you what you're getting

[32:49] and you know the the commentary is is good for a few days he's bumping it up people are sharing

[32:56] pictures and stuff of Vartons and talking about Pinball Rarity and then all of a sudden

[33:02] all of a sudden the typical Pinside thing happens and Pinside user what metalic comes in and

[33:11] and just like derails this thread with the typical typical like let me crap on the game I think he

[33:22] had a Big Bang Bar and he wrote like Big Bang Bar is great and has a cool history but it's also just

[33:30] another pinball machine and wallets at hell of a looker the game itself is average I haven't

[33:34] missed my much at all and then he goes on which which this part just irks me uh is he basically says

[33:43] there's nothing special about Totten it's a beginner level game and boring as hell so let's just

[33:51] stop there so don't you lose all credibility when you say there's nothing special about Totten

[33:58] I consider them to be fighting words because in my arguments of a world under glass and

[34:03] machines that used to have creativity and flair to them tonin circus Voltaire he writes circus

[34:10] Voltaire isn't much better you spend the whole game shooting three shots ramp left orbit and ring

[34:14] master uh so what so what if you have three magical shots or three shots you shoot over and over

[34:21] again it is the ring master toy and the coolness of that the in in toden the shooting star ball

[34:31] saves on the out lanes the genie the disappearing magnet let me talk about the ramp on Totten that is

[34:37] one of the coolest shots ever the way that ball diverts in in three or four different directions

[34:43] up that ramp is incredible I don't think I've seen a game that looks like it has two ramps

[34:48] but it only really has one uh so great you know I think we can all universally agree when you walk

[34:55] into someone's for sale thread and just say I don't think the game's that interesting you're just

[35:02] being a dick like and it's cool like I think I think this user doesn't mind being a dick it's like

[35:10] but why why do people do that and and I'm tempted to do it every once in a while and I used to do it

[35:17] back in my my my housey and days on pinside but it really is the most dickish behavior because the

[35:23] guys asking twenty k for a big bang bar has all these extras with it if you don't like it or think

[35:31] it's too much what what good does you coming into that thread and saying I had one I got rid of it

[35:40] it's not worth it it's not that great like why we all know that big bang bar is a game that the only

[35:48] people that will pay a premium or pay a price for it know the story they know the history uh they

[35:55] know what they're getting and I think certain people out there who have been looking long and hard

[36:00] for a big bang bar would love to have this entire package as as the OP or original posters has

[36:06] stayed at many times you're you'd be hard pressed to find any of those extra items or any of those

[36:12] extra parts um so when you add it all up twenty thousand dollars maybe right or best offer

[36:19] I think what's really not something the game is not because of metal lick and his his jerky comments

[36:25] I think it's simply because of the fear of remakes and that really sucks because big bang bar

[36:34] if it's remade uh we'll destroy the price of the originals destroy it uh there is a user on

[36:42] eBay who has a big bang bar still in box for twenty five thousand dollars and the black night

[36:48] was talking about this user and how he's the running joke because he's always tried to sell this thing

[36:53] way above market value and it I've always said it it makes no sense to buy a new in box big bang bar

[37:00] you might have battery damage the game might not even work once you open up the box you just lost

[37:05] nine thousand dollars for that moment of having a virgin game so not worth it I mean I saw a beautiful

[37:12] big bang bar last year at alan town and it was beautiful and it sold for like fifteen grand and it

[37:20] looked mint I mean it had LEDs it had everything it was it was great uh so big bang bar is a game that

[37:27] has settled around the fifteen thousand dollar mark maybe you know give or take a thousand here

[37:32] there depending on condition but if it's remade if it's remade it will slide down and they'll

[37:40] all be worth whatever the remake price is unless they only remake a certain amount but that doesn't

[37:48] seem like it would be worth the effort you know if they're gonna remake it if rickid pps is gonna

[37:53] remake it why not do a thousand and charge eight thousand nine thousand each and then all the

[37:59] originals will also become worth that I don't think people really respect originality when

[38:05] remakes come out I really I really don't think these people with medieval manises who have the

[38:10] original feel good right now I don't think that like I understand how certain people are like well

[38:18] pinball should just be played it shouldn't be collectors item then that's that's a bunch of bs like

[38:21] these are collector items it sucks when they get remade so we'll see what happens the game like

[38:27] that the bottom on is this it doesn't matter what anyone says the game is still sitting there the

[38:32] game is still sitting there so clearly twenty thousand is too much it's not it's not as we would say

[38:39] in the hobby this thing is not price to sell right it's price a little bit higher so we'll see what

[38:45] the best offers are that come in I haven't mentioned on any of the recent podcasts that I've done

[38:51] Kevin cool like round two I gotta be honest I can't really follow what's going on I think what's

[38:56] happening he went back into court there was another audio from the court hearing I think he was

[39:02] denied bankruptcy and now they're going to start going after the assets so we'll see where this

[39:09] where that train ends I you know I don't know who's going to get back anything if they even if

[39:15] they there's a few assets to divvy out but I think you're going to be looking at pennies to the

[39:19] dollar for people when that thing is finally said and done looking at just some games on pinside so

[39:25] who said that you need a ton of money to to get a pinball machine there's a judge dread for

[39:32] twenty eight hundred the Johnny new monarch for twenty five hundred let's go down the list

[39:38] a family guy for seven thousand five hundred dollars what the f that seems like too much and of

[39:46] course he's got twenty eight down votes this is from duggy L duggy L it was I mean come on if you

[39:55] come on the pinside this one looks nice it's got like yellow armor and everything but

[40:01] he's a few thousand dollars over see I'm doing the dickish thing already I'm like already ready to

[40:06] chime in and down vote but but I'll say that it does help because if you're a newbie to the hobby

[40:11] it does help newbies when people price police certain threads like that right so if you're a newbie

[40:18] and you like family guy and and you go in here and you see that pen and you think seven five hundred

[40:22] dollars is is reasonable you wouldn't know any better unless the community came in and just

[40:28] absolutely piled on the price of that game the way they did big bang bar different story it you

[40:33] could argue that it it would be worth that all right let's see what else is for sale we got I'm

[40:38] trying to think of the interesting one so a homie's only was emerald city Ellie eight thousand dollars

[40:46] interesting so that's pretty much what that game was new right so people are thinking was is

[40:54] are gonna just hold their value I don't know I really don't know I I think that when dialed in

[41:02] comes out people are gonna realize to that the standard body is just so much better so much better

[41:07] and dialed in is beautiful playing a standard body Jersey Jack machine is just a thing of beauty

[41:14] and I know he just put out a survey today and that's what most people told them so I don't think

[41:19] you're gonna see many more wide body Jersey Jack pimple games in the future all right I don't even

[41:26] know you know look I'm not gonna go down on list of all these things for sale but I did see a

[41:30] lower the rings Ellie on their pop up last week America's most haunted for sixty one hundred

[41:37] lots of games lots of games some jerky selling is Batman 66 Ellie for twelve thousand that's what I

[41:43] sold mine for and good looking at price again now that everyone realizes there aren't many interesting

[41:50] shots in the game but that's gonna be it guys I think what we're seeing is a little bit of the

[41:56] beginning of the stall lots of games for sale I think a little bit more than usual maybe people

[42:01] waiting for maybe waiting for their tax money to return before they pull the trigger on stuff but

[42:08] we're gonna keep covering the hobby we're gonna keep going at these manufacturers I think that

[42:15] this entire podcast I think there's a topic that I've been waiting to talk about I've been waiting

[42:23] to talk about this topic for for months and I've really just sort of scratched the surface of it

[42:30] on a few podcasts but the damn I hope is about to break wide open on this and this this podcast

[42:37] is gonna change directions and we are gonna have a topic that is gonna eat up many many podcasts in

[42:43] the future if this happens soon so I don't want to tell you what it is you might be able to guess

[42:50] but it's going to it's going to feel like a miracle has happened I'll just say that have a good

[42:57] night and we'll talk to you soon
