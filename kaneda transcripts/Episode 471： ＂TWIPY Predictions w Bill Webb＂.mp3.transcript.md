[00:00] You can't always get what you want

[00:06] But if you try sometime, where am I just fine?

[00:12] Then come back to New Year's Eve!

[00:15] Just one day to go ladies and gentlemen were one day away from the 2019 Twippy Awards

[00:24] And for many of you out there, this is going to be the last thing in a while

[00:29] In which we can get together as a pinball community and celebrate pinball

[00:34] There are not going to be new titles released, there won't be many games shipping

[00:38] But the Twippy's will go on and the great news is that everybody out there is in attendance

[00:44] No matter where you are in the world, if you're connected to the internet

[00:48] You can be a part of the 2019 Twippy Awards

[00:51] And so if you don't know, it's at 8.30 Eastern Standard Time

[00:56] Saturday night, March 28th

[00:59] The link to the site will be on this week in pinball.com

[01:03] It will also, it's Carrie Hardy's YouTube channel, it's YouTube premiere

[01:07] There's going to be a live chat

[01:09] I'm going to get there a little early

[01:11] I'll be there at 8 o'clock Eastern Standard Time

[01:13] That's one of the whole thing just kicks off

[01:16] And the chat opens up and it's going to be great

[01:18] Now on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I have a special guest

[01:22] Mr. Bill Webb from Special When Lit Podcast has joined the show

[01:27] It was great to have Bill come on and what we're going to do right now is we're going to go down

[01:32] All the Twippy categories and tell you who we think is going to win

[01:36] And who we think is going to get runner up in each category

[01:40] Because it's been a while since we voted

[01:42] And it's also been a while since we've thought about the 2019 games

[01:46] This is normally something that happens at Texas Pinball Festival

[01:49] I know we're all sad that that's not going to take place

[01:53] But this is going to be a really fun night for everyone involved and everyone watching it

[01:58] I know that Carrie and Amodo have put so much work into making this show happen

[02:04] And they weren't expecting it, you gotta remember this

[02:07] They were expecting it to be a live show for so long

[02:12] And then all of a sudden they had to switch gears and make a show happen on the internet

[02:17] So let's give them all the credit in the world and let's show up

[02:20] And appreciate all the hard work they put into it

[02:23] They also had to become the host of the show with Greg and Zach

[02:26] I'm not doing it this year, but I know Greg and Zach will be watching

[02:29] Everyone's going to be there who you know in the pinball industry and in the hobby

[02:33] Watching this thing at 8.30 Saturday night

[02:36] So set your calendars, I can't wait to hang out with you guys

[02:39] Fingers crossed we might win our third straight Twippy for Best Pinball Podcast

[02:44] But I'm excited to see everyone recognize and all those great different categories

[02:48] So thanks to Jeff over at this week in pinball for hosting the Twippies

[02:52] And putting this thing together three years ago

[02:54] It's been really a really a fun ride for everyone to sort of aggregate all the stuff we love in one location

[03:01] So here's Mr. Bill Webb and maybe you agree and don't agree with our selections

[03:06] But we're going to we're going to give our best at trying to decide who's going to win

[03:10] Come Saturday night.

[03:11] All right ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the show a man

[03:15] Who the first time we talked we could barely hear Mr. Bill Webb

[03:20] Bill from Special When Lit welcome to Canadian pinball podcast

[03:23] Chris what's going on man last time wasn't too flattered when we were on

[03:26] And I just was it was it on this show or was it when we were on your show because I forget

[03:31] We were on our show and the microphones we had a problem with them so that's all right though

[03:35] And then we've tried to do this for like four months and all honesty but dude you know you got heard

[03:40] We had things going on dude it's just been a long time in the making so glad to finally get the opportunity

[03:46] Yeah and it's great to hear you back on the airwaves how has it been in the hiatus from Special When Lit

[03:51] Have you missed being on the airwaves?

[03:53] I do miss doing the show but honestly with how much family stuff we got going on right now

[03:57] And then obviously with quarantine it's kind of been a blessing a little bit of free time to try and get some of the stuff tackled

[04:03] So right not too bad there is a lot of pressure when you do weekly podcast build that most people don't understand the amount of work

[04:10] That goes on behind the scenes right?

[04:13] Well you know what you never know what's going to happen on that Monday when you're trying to record and it's always something

[04:18] So but yeah I definitely miss it but we'll see what happens

[04:22] Well here we are back in the driver's seat Bill and here's what we're going to do on this

[04:26] episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast we are going to be all about the trippies which are this Saturday night

[04:32] 830 Eastern Standard Time and what Bill and I are going to do

[04:36] We are going to go down the list of all the trippy categories and we are going to say

[04:41] What we think is going to take each category and who we think the runner up is going to be how's that sound Bill?

[04:47] Oh it sounds awesome man.

[04:48] Alright let's jump right into it so the number one category the first category is best theme

[04:54] We've got Black Knight, Cosmic Carnival, Elvira, Jurassic Park, October Fest, Star Wars Home Edition, the Monsters and Willy Wonka.

[05:04] Bill what do you think is the best theme and what is your runner up?

[05:09] I think Jurassic Park is going to take it but I think Wonka is going to be the strong second.

[05:14] Okay I'm going to go with I think Willy Wonka is going to take best theme and I think runner up is going to be Jurassic Park.

[05:24] So we just switch on those.

[05:26] I like it dude it's perfect.

[05:28] Is it a weird that Star Wars Home Edition is on here?

[05:31] I mean I get it it is a pinball machine but I mean it's not really designed for the audience that the people are going to be watching the trippies.

[05:37] Right.

[05:38] But well it's also like I mean Star Wars is the biggest theme of all time right.

[05:41] If you were just saying theme alone Star Wars is the biggest but in the Home Edition format of the game it's like below a pro.

[05:49] So it's weird that it's here as a theme and the game came out two years ago.

[05:54] So best animations and display right.

[05:58] Here we go again it's a very similar list. Black Knight, Cosmic Carnival, Elvira, Jurassic Park, Medieval Madness Remake,

[06:07] October Fest, Star Wars Home Edition, Monsters and Wonka.

[06:12] So best animations and display bill.

[06:15] What do you think?

[06:16] And this is going to sound like a broken record for half this but I'm going to have to say Jurassic Park on that one.

[06:21] Those were sweet animations right.

[06:22] Even though there wasn't movie clips they did a phenomenal job with those animations.

[06:26] Yes.

[06:27] And they had to create all that stuff.

[06:29] You know I mean I'd love to give it to Wonka but Wonka they were able to use some of the movie assets and stuff like that.

[06:34] Runner up I would probably have to go with October Fest because they had to do that stuff too.

[06:40] And there were some cool stuff in that game.

[06:41] Wow.

[06:42] Wow.

[06:43] I'm shocked.

[06:44] But here's the thing.

[06:46] I'm not going to give it to Elvira because Elvira is not really done yet.

[06:50] You know what I mean?

[06:51] I think Elvira is going to be awesome when it's done.

[06:53] Kind of like Batman was.

[06:54] Right.

[06:55] Well I'm going to go with I agree.

[06:57] I think Jurassic Park is going to take this much to the chagrin of the hardworking folks who I think are going to come in in the runner up.

[07:03] Spot and I think Willie Wonka's animations with the chocolate factory screen and all the fun stuff they did with because a lot of that is animated to remember they don't have that many movie clips.

[07:14] So I think it is.

[07:16] I think that's going to be my runner up but I think Jurassic Park takes I think and here's the thing people were never going to know right bill who gets number two.

[07:23] What we want but that's okay.

[07:25] So on to best light show.

[07:28] Interesting that this is a category right because it's unique but it the light shows are important in Pimbal and once again we have black night cosmic carnival Elvira Jurassic Park medieval man is October best star wars monsters in Wonka bill.

[07:42] What's got the best light show.

[07:43] What's the runner up?

[07:44] I'm going to have to give this one to Wonka.

[07:46] Runner up would probably be.

[07:49] I do like a viral though so I'm going to like you know I'll give the runner up to a viral.

[07:53] It's interesting because I think right now if this included Rick and Morty or even maybe stranger things those two might be contenders in this category.

[08:03] I would agree that Willie Wonka I think we'll get the best light show and if you haven't stood over a Willie Wonka right with all those little new LEDs and the amount of full RGB LED in the game when that when that game lights up right bill it's it's incredible.

[08:19] I think it's going to take it.

[08:21] Oh yeah it is.

[08:22] Runner up.

[08:24] It's weird right I just I think medieval I don't know I just feels weird saying medieval madness is like that remake feels like it was a long long time ago right because medieval madness remake came out in 2016 2017.

[08:39] Why is it on this list because it's a vault basically but but okay so they announced it in October but none of those games even ship this year it's weird.

[08:48] I think the runner up is going to be I think Jurassic Park on that but again we won't know the best toys and gimmicks in a game now you know me bill I love a good toy I love yeah something mechanical that interacts with the ball that's magical we've got black night sort of rage which the toy in that they don't they don't list what the toy is it's the night with the shield and the flail yeah let's go up and down goes up and down knocks the ball back at you.

[09:15] Cosmic carnival what's the toy in that game dude I played it but I don't really think there is one maybe I know that sounds terrible but it's just it's just got gimmicks whatever that maybe the machine itself is a gimmick is that is that what they mean.

[09:30] Elvira House of Horrors we all know what that toy is I mean it's got multiple toys but it's got the big house I think that's what they're talking about right yes house windows light up in the ball goes behind.

[09:41] Jurassic Park has the T-Rex which is incredible October Fest has a lot of toys got the rollercoaster it's got the barrel it's got the I don't know what that all the auto I guess this is I guess what I'm doing here is incorrect I guess they're talking about all the toys in the game so we got

[09:59] Star Wars home edition the monsters which has the lower playfield that's really neat willy wonk and the chocolate factory it's got the God stopper right it's got the

[10:08] Wanker Vader it's got the wonky vision okay set of all these games bill which one best toys and gimmicks.

[10:15] So I'm going off of just like what's the single coolest toy out of all of them and I really like the house on Elvira wow okay now now you think that's going to win or you just that's the one you like what do you think

[10:27] win okay so get that runner up and I'm going to say wonka one more time okay I think you're I think you're going to know

[10:35] way here's why I think the Jurassic Park T-Rex is going to take this so easily in this category the T-Rex is like the coolest single mech and it has and you get the premium

[10:46] L.E. right you got the T-Rex you got the Raptor cage you got a lot of stuff in Jurassic Park I think Jurassic Park T-Rex takes it by by a dinosaur mile and then I think the runner up

[10:56] would be willy-wonka with the toys in the game that's that's my bet I don't know man see the the dinosaurs really really cool I just it's just doesn't

[11:06] uh yeah I it'll be interesting to find out man we'll have to do over here and it be it be boring if we had the same picks across the whole you know

[11:13] Twippy score sheet so we will here's the thing though one of us will be right or wrong this there's no areas of gray right coming up Saturday night

[11:22] no best theme integration black night cosmic carnival Elvira's house a horror is Jurassic Park October fest Star Wars monsters and wonka really interesting category right because some of these

[11:35] there's source material like the willy-wonka movie or Star Wars what's the source material for cosmic carnival yeah but anyway what are your picks here Bill honestly I'd have to say Jurassic Park is the winner

[11:48] with how they did the incorporated you know without using the movie as it's in how it's an adventure in the island in the layout I think that is just awesome how they put that all together right runner up

[12:01] probably Elvira I like Elvira yeah this category I think out of all the categories this one really pulls people in a lot of different directions right and this has been probably the source of so much debate with games like willy-wonka

[12:16] games like Jurassic Park because Jurassic Park doesn't have any of the assets from the movie but yet you get the feeling that you're going into Jurassic Park so well in that game right you don't really need the movie clips

[12:29] October fest like it or hate it or love it or hate it right did a good job like making it feel like in October fest sort of carnival sort of festival

[12:39] I would argue that Jurassic Park will win this I think that's going to be the winner I think and because people love Jurassic Park the game so much to bill it's going to have a significant advantage just because of the love affair with the game itself

[12:55] and the volume of people and I do think Elvira is a runner up the first time I played Elvira they nailed that game that game feels so like you're going into an Elvira sort of BC can't be movie kind of experience I think they did a great job

[13:08] Oh yeah well you know what with going on just to expand about a little on that Jurassic Park how many Jurassic Parks do you think that they've made and then how many walkers do you think that they've made so just by sheer exposure I think Stern got way more

[13:20] Jurassic Parks on the street than I do walkers than to JP as Walker it's a great point bill because the critics of the Twippies will say well it's not fair because it's not really the best it's the most popular and if more people go see or buy Jurassic Park then you have two times three times the voter base versus walk it be like Avengers would win best movie of the year if the Academy Awards were handled like the Twippies right because most people love them

[13:48] so it's all subjective it's the way they do it and I think it's the only fair way to do it right because if there was just a committee like the Academy Awards who voted these things people would moaning grown to know and at least this is up to the fans of Pimble best music and sound effects bill we got black night we have all the same games cosmic carnival Elvira Jurassic Park October Fest Star Wars monsters and Willy Wonka

[14:14] I'm gonna have to go with Jurassic Park man because literally and I this is gonna happen a few more times but literally pulls you in you know it really really sucks you in you feel in grossed and I hear I own both walk and a Jurassic Park for that reason runner up probably walk again.

[14:34] But you know and and and that's kind of a tie with black night because I kind of like how just kind of starts off real heavy I know that's your absolute favorite when they start off blazing the music in there that's your favorite thing in the world.

[14:46] The music is amazing in it I think it hits you like a title wave off the bad and that's what they were going for but look from just from a pure the music is great black night music and sound effects are phenomenal I do agree I think Jurassic Park is going to win this category again.

[15:01] It's amazing build to because the is the twippy is going to be boring bill of Jurassic Park keeps winning for like a half hour an hour.

[15:08] No you know what man no because right we were there it does deserve it I mean great accolades get great word but we were there the twippy's last year and it was you know basically you know flip a coin iron maiden or pirates of the Caribbean and you get the occasional deadpool or you know other stuff rolled in there but I mean it was still awesome it's still an awesome experience even if you're not there.

[15:29] Yes and we learned last year there will be surprises everyone might think this game is going to run away with everything but we could see some surprises for best music and sound effects for me I I do think it's going to be Jurassic Park and then runner up.

[15:45] I'll buy was amazing if you've ever played in a viral the music and sound effects in that game are incredible the only thing is with that game I just don't think enough people played it I don't think it's going to get the votes but to me that's the runner up in this category best callouts you know me I'm a fan of callouts I think callouts help set the atmosphere and the personality of a game we've got black night cosmic carnival.

[16:09] They should have just removed cosmic carnival from every single category except maybe artwork it would have made it easier on on us as we do this show Jurassic Park October Fest Star Wars monsters Willy Wonka what's got the best callouts I okay so we're going to flip this I want to hear your opinion is before I answer or let's do that I'll do the next we'll do the next few I'll go first okay I'll do it for best callouts in a game I think the best callouts I would give it to Elvira's House of Horrors.

[16:39] I love her callouts and my runner up would be black night sort of rage fair enough fair enough yeah I actually had black night because he's just sitting there taught you it's different from a lot of the other stuff on the spectrum right now and then followed up by Wonka even though the audio clips are synced with the video clips and I know it's a source of contention but you know still love the callouts good and walk I always hear the callouts being somewhat not the best are they good callouts it's all subjective and I do when I'm playing.

[17:09] No one's in my basement I like it so it doesn't matter right here's where it gets fun and these are all the same games people we don't have to read them out this is best rules in a game same games in every category here I think the best rules are going to go to Jurassic Park and and I just when people play this game the other thing they love about it is not just L wins design of the physical game itself I always hear that the rules set is great there's so much to do there's

[17:39] different ways to approach the game I even think people love that they incorporated that escape what is it no what's the name of the park

[17:46] I'm sure new new blur meblar yeah they've got that mode in it and I so I think that's going to win best rules I do think the runner up

[17:55] Elvira wasn't finished right so I don't think that's going to it's not done yet I think Willie Wonka would be the one that people would consider runner up

[18:03] I hate to say is that's literally what I wrote down to so because Elvira is kind of still in its infancy it got released real late in 2019 so I mean it still doesn't have legs yet which is kind of sad because I you know won't carry on to the 2020

[18:15] twit these but that's all right right this one this one's interesting the next one is best gameplay and layout now I have the game I think does have the best layout and and gameplay and then I have I think these two are going to battle it out back and forth

[18:30] and I think it's a toss up between Jurassic Park and Willie Wonka I think Pat Lawler designed an amazingly incredible layout and unique layout with Wonka same thing with Jurassic Park if I were to pick who's going to win I think this is one of those categories where it could go either way but I just think Jurassic Park wins it because it has a much bigger user base and fan base

[18:52] you know what I agree with you but I will take the opposite approach saying that Jurassic Park will be the runner up and Wonka will just narrowly miss this one out and the only reason why I'm going to say that is just because Lawler's a seasoned veteran everyone knows him for how he designs games and and I think he thought one did an amazing job on Jurassic Park but yep

[19:11] even when even when voting bill when you get to the votes a lot of people might feel like they've already voted enough for Jurassic Park that they might want to show some love to Jersey Jack and Lawler and incredibly designed game with Wonka in terms of layout.

[19:27] Oh yeah the hard part is man is there's the same six a games on this list and every one of them do you know you can find something you like on it or enjoy on it for the for the most part right so it's it's it's it's a hard part because you don't want to be like you know your games not as cool as this game this game suck everyone put their heart and soul into these games but just.

[19:47] The popular vote of what people like at the moment that we're kind of bases basing this on yeah and that brings up some of the

[19:54] the pre-twippy controversy right are there there's winners and losers and whenever there's a moment where a a victor will be declared

[20:02] do other people get mad and upset and discouraged from from what they've accomplished but I don't think anyone makes a pinball machine should ever be discouraged about what they're doing they're they're adding pinball into the world

[20:13] and and that's that's what's important so game of the year bill the big one do you want to go first on and I this one I think is the easiest one to pick game of the year I think we skipped over best artwork Chris we oh we did oh man look at that Christopher

[20:28] Franchie would have killed me because he gets my pick this is where monsters and Franchie Christopher Franchie finally his ship has come in he finally has delivered an

[20:38] art package that didn't have a zombie yeti to go up against it I know I he's going to kill me for saying that but no they're both phenomenal artists but the

[20:47] monsters art package is just a leagues above anything else that came out in 2019 so I think he runs away with it and then I think runner up is Star Wars

[20:57] comic book edition which weirdly just appears in this this drop down menu but the comic book art for Star Wars is really cool I'm going to have to

[21:06] agree with you on the monsters I've had one and dude just a beautiful machine I mean you'd rather just like sit next to it just because I

[21:13] how pretty it is just a stare at it followed up by a viral man I really liked the artwork on a viral you've only had one art

[21:22] package in all three models was that lame yeah but you know what I mean here like Jurassic Park I'm not the biggest fan of the pros

[21:31] artwork right I love that I'm arguing bill with your choices

[21:36] alright I I think Elvira's play field is beautiful I think where Elvira falls down for me is one translate across all three and then the

[21:46] the premium right just the logo on the side without Elvira thought that was like yeah in terms of which game has the best

[21:54] across all three but that's another interesting point is this doesn't take into consideration that some games

[21:59] only have one art package right and other games have three to choose from that's a great point and I think that

[22:07] Jurassic Park man you know the outside on the pro isn't my favorite thing but I think Johnny crapped it a

[22:13] awesome job on the play field yeah but because of the the cabinet it doesn't sit as well with me the cabinet and

[22:20] Jurassic Park all of them they just it just didn't feel like it was made for the pinball it's like they moved over

[22:26] artwork from a lunch box and put it on it yeah I think it could have been different and sure there's people that

[22:33] love it and there's people that hate it but that's okay all right the big one drum roll game of the year which is

[22:38] the easiest one and I'll just say it it's gonna easily go to Jurassic Park and I think runner up in this

[22:44] one would be Willie Wong yeah yeah I'm gonna take the opposite approach and say that wonka wins and Jurassic Park

[22:50] follows I don't think that's actually gonna happen that's my I think you nailed it I'm pretty sure

[22:56] that what you said is exactly the way that it's gonna go down and I think it's just based off numbers yeah well

[23:02] it's based off of sales too right and I like I think one day Jersey Jack will win a game of the year it's

[23:08] just just always runs up against Keith Owen so favorite pinball streamer this is where we get into the

[23:16] right in categories and I don't know about you bill and we just saw like it's it's all the same five or

[23:21] six or seven games to me this is where the twippies gets fun too because it gets really subjective really

[23:27] personal and a lot of personalities and people who are doing stuff for free so I know there's a lot

[23:34] of competitive spirit between streamers and podcasters and content creators so the favorite pinball

[23:40] streamer we got Buffalo Chuck Wirt dead flip flipping out pinball your boy Ken and even on that show too

[23:47] yeah JDL laser loose melbourne silver ball pop a TV pinball PB undesirables now I have to admit I

[23:57] haven't heard of like half of these I don't know if you have ever heard of all of them I've heard

[24:02] them but I you know I haven't had a chance to watch all of them so I can't I'm not as educated as I

[24:07] could be but that's okay I I think again this is another one where I think if I'm gonna look at

[24:12] audience and who I think is gonna win this category this one I think is gonna go to Mr. Jack

[24:17] Danger and dead flip I think so too man he's definitely been doing it a long time he definitely

[24:22] has the following and I think the runner up for me would be flipping out pinball I would see or

[24:31] Buffalo or Buffalo yeah yeah I would I would say that's a safe choice right there yeah I watch all

[24:36] those shows and it's always hard I think they they're so different too right I mean what I love

[24:41] about flipping out it's got more of like the live show with the chat and Buffalo is is they do more

[24:47] of like the live version of their podcasts and everyone does their show differently and Jack when

[24:52] he plays we know what makes Jack fun to watch is if you watch him is he's able to play and read the

[24:58] chats like instantaneously so when you're when you're watching him play he's also interacting with

[25:04] you so quickly that I think it makes it really fun for for people to be parts of those chats oh yeah

[25:10] I mean that's such a difficult thing to try and do definitely get the word just for that alone

[25:15] all right now maybe the most controversial subject matter of the 30 Saturday night the

[26:10] could maybe from this week in pinball podcast the head to head to yeah I don't even want to speculate

[26:16] on that man because everyone that's on this list really does put their heart and soul into this and

[26:20] I know they're like our most of them are friends and our we talked to them on a daily basis this one's

[26:24] always a hard one I'm hoping I take the third year in a row I know I have a large following

[26:30] for second for me I do think you know I love special one that I do think Zach in this week in

[26:36] pinball because they stayed consistently making shows all year and people love Zach and Dennis so much

[26:43] I think they have a huge following I would have normally said head to head but Marty like took off

[26:48] the month of January when everyone was voting so I just felt like he kind of threw in the towel

[26:53] when voting was happening so I that's why I don't think head to head is gonna would have I always

[26:58] think head to head as a legitimate chance chance to win it and I was surprised to see them just

[27:02] throw in the towel in the in the voting month okay things come up though so absolutely and look

[27:08] it's it's just voting like someone could have set up a laptop somewhere for a month and paid people

[27:13] a dollar to vote you know you never know favorite pinball YouTube channel do you want to read these

[27:18] out loud bill yes all right so favorite pinball YouTube channel uh carry hearty uh chases are

[27:24] arcade gameplay and restorations flipping out pinball a moto arcade uh pop up pinball pinball mayhem

[27:31] stern pinball straight down the middle of pinball show and TNT amusements think and two of these are

[27:37] hosting the twippies yeah yes the carry in a moto um okay so what do you think they'll what what

[27:44] are your favorites here uh favorites to win I'm gonna say probably straight down the middle yeah

[27:50] you know if there were somebody I'd like this to see when you know uh uh uh uh uh contender out

[27:57] of right field would be TNT amusements man because tired of been around forever doing this yeah and his

[28:02] shows are super fun he did an amazing tour of American pinball that I that I saw recently uh I

[28:08] I agree I mean straight down the middle is is gonna take this Zach and Greg and they haven't done

[28:14] as many shows as they used to right and I know people are calling for them to to do more episodes

[28:19] and we'll forgive Zach for those pinball crib's episodes right we've we've forgive him for that

[28:24] or what do you think dude I liked them so I can't you know I'm not gonna go they just stop doing them

[28:29] I think he's we'll see we'll see what happens there uh I think they take it and for runner-up for me

[28:36] would be uh do do do I mean I love carry hearty I love I was hoping you were gonna see that because

[28:42] that's another front of ours well I just I loved the fact that carry does video content pretty much

[28:48] in real time when news breaks and and and that's great like he aggregates the new story he's got a

[28:54] video up and he gives his opinion about it and I like that he's opinionated too right he puts stuff

[28:58] up and it's not like it like for example if it's like hot wheels he doesn't like it he's gonna tell

[29:03] you he doesn't like it he's not he's not there he doesn't say yeah he doesn't sugarcoat much no no

[29:09] favorite pinball mod of 2019 Bill what do we got on the mod list uh so uh Amber drastic park

[29:17] shooter ride by stern barbersaw can by flash on pinside chest mod for jjp pirates by pinball mod

[29:24] company deluxe light kit speaker light kits pin stadium hovers pin stadium extremes uh pinwoofer

[29:33] raptor pit by mazel mazl uh measle mods wonky factory mod by the mod couple and wonkyvator by

[29:39] lear mods yeah which one do you which ones your favorite you know you know he's not gonna win

[29:45] his pin stadium after after they spammed us with ads for the entire year no no no buddies

[29:51] even though i do love pin stadium lights um i think the coolest one out of all these that

[29:56] and i want to explain my answer here for the winner i think a mod should be more than something that

[30:02] just tax on to the game i love mods that actually physically maybe changed the game itself and that's

[30:11] why for me i think the best mod in pinball was the chess mod for jurzy jack pinballs pirate to

[30:18] the care being because it actually made the chest the treasure chest opening close again

[30:23] which to me like is a game changer for the experience of locking balls in that treasure chest

[30:29] so that's my favorite the runner up would probably be uh the wonkyvactory mod by mod couple just

[30:36] because the the jurzy jack standard factory look like a stick of butter i yeah i agree honestly

[30:42] i have that mod on my my game um so honestly my favorite out of those would probably be the

[30:48] uh wonkyvator by lear mods and all honesty yeah that's a cool one too yeah it changes it up

[30:53] dude when you have a standard yep absolutely i love categories like because to me these are the

[30:59] kinds of categories in the twippies where like nobody knows who's gonna win and these are the most

[31:05] fun categories uh yeah favorite home brew pinball machine we got kasil vania dead flip

[31:13] metroid space balls and undertale i got a google half of these i haven't seen half of these

[31:20] okay what do you think all right so honestly i i have to i think space balls will win but i

[31:26] think kasil vania by Justin will be runner up okay yeah i think um man this is like who's

[31:33] gonna win i agree i think space balls is gonna win and kasil yeah i got the same order as you

[31:39] uh okay rookie of the year this this is another category that i think a lot of people were like

[31:45] wait a minute like yeah who do you vote on here rookie of the year like this and there were just

[31:51] some people in here that were you know they almost got two shots to win because they might be a

[31:56] brand new podcaster i'm okay with it because i love the variety of people in this category so

[32:03] bill why don't you take us through who's nominated for rookie of the year all right so it's

[32:08] bad bread all bright for art package led zeppelin home brew christ frank christ franche for podcasting

[32:14] the super awesome pinball show how do you get on this list for doing an art package for just a home

[32:21] brew it isn't that don't you feel like there should have been a requirement that whatever you did

[32:26] had to be somewhat official in pinball i it's it's weird but if the get you know what though if

[32:32] they make the game you know then it's legit but you know what may it's just about popular well yeah

[32:38] i think what popularity i think what they should do for this category next year bill is they should

[32:42] make it rookie the year should be new people in the pinball industry so so for example uh what's

[32:50] his name uh johnny crap yep he's a rookie uh Tim sexin is a rookie scott and easy was a rookie last

[32:57] year right you get the people are actually industry folks who because think about you get rookie

[33:02] the year in the NBA when you're actually an NBA player you don't get rookie the year because you're

[33:08] the new like towel boy with the nicks but anyway i i dig right well yeah if you're in the industry

[33:14] and you jump and did something else yeah that's kind of you know you're not uh uh you know what

[33:18] behind the years dude i mean your season veteran in some degree so yeah i agree okay so keep us

[33:23] going cuz i cut you off is it what we're franching or podcast yeah uh jack danger for home

[33:28] brew designer jol de gusman for logo art american pinball which he is uh true blue rookie but he made he made

[33:35] one and and it's a nice it's a nice image but like he made one picture but that it listen you

[33:42] could play one game in the NBA you're still going to be in a rookie yeah you can't win rookie the year

[33:46] you have to play a minimum of 40 games i know this for a fact because i bet the rookie the year

[33:50] this year in Vegas okay go on okay i know i i i but you get my point though if he played this

[33:55] 40 games even though he he played five minutes of game whatever um johnny crab for our package

[34:00] Jurassic park that guy's name cracks me up every time what blows my mind is that's what he wants to be

[34:05] called yeah cuz it's not his real last name but hey whatever we all got preferences uh

[34:11] Lauren gray for podcasting back box pinball podcast loser kid pinball podcast for podcasting poor

[34:17] man spin ball podcast podcasting um ranny martina's for our package star wars comic ad adition

[34:24] Tim sexton for lead coder on black night sort of rage zack and the coal many for distribution

[34:29] flipping out pimple which is which is the funniest one right and they are new to the distributor game

[34:36] i think zack loves being on this list because he's anything but a rookie okay so bill what

[34:41] what do you think this this one this is another one right i think this is going to be the one of

[34:44] the most surprising categories to win who do you think gets it rookie of the year i'm gonna say

[34:51] Tim sexton for black night sort of rage yeah yeah i voted for tim too for this category because i do

[34:57] think that within this list he's he's it's as a inaugural game as a coder he put in a ton of work

[35:05] and the code in the game is actually really good especially for a first effort at coding

[35:11] and i i think he takes it who do you think could be a runner-up or who who wouldn't you be surprised

[35:17] bill might also be able to win this category uh johnny well oh yeah johnny crap johnny crap

[35:23] confer Jurassic Park because he's a rookie and do that game is popular right you know i i thought

[35:30] it would be funny if zack might get a lot of people to to troll the category and vote for him

[35:36] in this uh but i think that i'm just looking at right now i think the uh randy martina's i would

[35:42] argue that the star wars comic book art i i i think is better than the Jurassic Park art on that

[35:49] game like that boba fed and that stuff is super cool so we'll see i think we both pick artists as the

[35:54] backup winners here but which is good because i think people who actually contributed to a game

[36:00] should be who's in this category so favorite competitive pinball player this is i hope they

[36:05] just do this category first and it's nothing against these people but uh this is the one where like

[36:11] did you even write in for this i just i did i lost a little bit in this is ultimate popularity contest

[36:18] because if they wanted to give it to the best pinball player they simply could have gone off of i

[36:21] f p a rankings right and oh yeah whoever's number one at the end of january gets the twippy but all right

[36:28] so we got do you want to say these names because i'm going to butcher these names you probably know

[36:32] them better than me i don't think i do but we're gonna try so uh elexander elexander

[36:39] okay okay go there uh bone carons irick stone esher left cough holly caskin

[36:47] jack danger johannis ostomer ostomire yep we'll go with that uh Keith Owen Robert Gagnon

[36:55] and Steve Bowden right lots of lots of lots of people who are just the favorites just favorite

[37:01] people and pinball on this and some of them have designed games some of them have one major tournaments

[37:06] so what do you think i do honestly one of my favorite guys is robber gagnon yeah you know is he

[37:13] you know is does elwin rank higher than him sure but that's just my you know and robert's story is

[37:19] amazing right he suffers from autism and pinball is one of his greatest outlets and he's just

[37:24] naturally gifted at it right and it's one of the ways in which he he deals with his autism and he's

[37:29] he's become one of the best players in the world oh yeah yeah anyone that's uh got hbl watch

[37:35] real sports i think it's number four eighteen and it tells Robert's story and it's just incredible

[37:39] yeah so so he wins it um i i think the person who's going to win this might be Keith

[37:48] because i just think it might be carryover love i i do think this is like the year of elwin so

[37:54] he's my he's my first one and then robert is my my backup vote on this one

[37:59] but again this is a toss up it's it's see the thing too with this kind of category is

[38:05] people who are nominated some people will actually go out there and ask their friends and families

[38:11] to vote people in their companies to vote lobby for votes others won't now i'm under the

[38:17] i you know my approach if you're nominated go get votes it's an election more than it is

[38:24] uh uh a committee voting so you got to hit the populace favorite pinball website we've got

[38:31] ifpa pinball ipdb internet pinball database marco special specialties match play events pinball info

[38:40] pinball life pinball news pinside stern pinball this week in pinball and tilt forums bill what's your

[38:47] favorite i'm gonna say i i think the winner will be uh i think it will squeak it out this week in

[38:52] pinball really i'm i'm dude just put a lot of work into that man yeah i know pinside one last year

[38:59] so i i i love this week in pinball pin sides just a pin sides are religion it's a cult it's more like a

[39:08] cult and it it's it's a huge cult pin sides like it's like the Catholic church i i think they're going

[39:15] and i'm i'm roman Catholic people so don't send me hate mail uh but i just think they have like

[39:19] so many people on pin side and pin sides kind of like when people like you can make fun of your

[39:24] mother but when someone else makes fun of your mother it's like we got a problem now that's kind of

[39:28] pin side like they hate each other all those people go in there every day and just tear each other

[39:33] down but they'll defend the right of that institution when other websites claim to be the number one

[39:40] source for pinball it's it's it's weird thing so that's my vote is i i put pin side then this

[39:46] week in pinball i like it so favorite pinball publication writer or article next year i'm going to

[39:53] write one article uh a look at the year two yeah well that's right if i write a single pinball

[40:01] article am i then eligible as rookie the year as a writer i think it would be i think so too

[40:07] we'll keep jepp to the standard this low standard he set for that category all right a look at

[40:13] seados exciting pinball president and sketchy pass by Brendan Kylie coin up carnival

[40:20] you know it's weird it's like coin up carnival then there is like is that a publication

[40:26] you know what i'm not i don't follow it enough right Dennis Creasel so he's a right i know Dennis

[40:30] writes articles uh pinball magazine or for newsletters pin game journal skillshot seados pinball

[40:38] sign or no zine sorry pinball zine it's like magazine yeah uh what's your pick my pick is going to go

[40:48] i think what's gonna win and here's why i think this is gonna win i think it's gonna be i think it's

[40:53] gonna be skillshot i'll tell you why because i know that the people over there they have an arcade

[40:59] i believe that they're associated with i think they've been like everyone who's come through they've

[41:02] had them vote um but there are some more people it's between skillshot to me and Dennis Creasel

[41:10] because Dennis has a humongous fanbase in following is the smartest man in pinball is on every other

[41:16] week with the zack and people love Dennis i love Dennis i love his take on pinball and and it's

[41:22] recognizable i think everything else here is not that recognizable to people

[41:28] well you know pinball magazine for newsletters i think is kind of recognizable yep um that's another

[41:33] one that's pretty good but isn't that like Jonathan juston jouston jolly like jump he's got like eight

[41:39] jays in his name i i don't follow it enough but i've read the articles i just don't follow this

[41:44] part of pinball enough right so what's your pick i i'm gonna go with Dennis Creasel yeah i

[41:49] want to be surprised if Dennis takes it be nice to have Dennis with the twippy um favorite pinball

[41:55] location oh we've got einstein's pub in texas Logan arcade in chicago no quarter in

[42:03] Nashville pinball gallery in malvern pa pinball lounge in florida the game preserve in texas pinball

[42:10] asylum florida the pinball palace georgia tilt town pinball Wisconsin and what's brewing in texas

[42:20] what do you think the silence speaks volumes for the you haven't been to any no no no i've been to

[42:28] Logan so honestly hometown hometown guys i'm gonna say Logan i'm just still kind of surprised that

[42:34] new york didn't get on this list well and and yeah people said that and we've got a lot of good

[42:41] barcades here we've got jack bar we've got sunshine we've got pioneer bar i think it is

[42:47] a eight bit or two bits uh but you know it just came down to the people in those leagues who are

[42:54] on pinside who represent those institutions just didn't do a good job getting people to write

[43:01] in the category and so i think people were shocked places were left off but it was fair everyone

[43:06] had a chance to write in their favorite location i think Logan's gonna win because again i think

[43:11] it's the most recognizable and as a backup i would say i don't even know like the rest really the

[43:20] pinball palace i would say has a chance because i know that they were also doing a good job

[43:25] recruiting votes in in in brunswick uh favorite pinball convention what a sad sad category this

[43:33] is now to think about because we're missing all our conventions but we we can't wait to they return

[43:38] we've got expo free play florida grand old game room expo heuston arcade pinball expo midwest gaming

[43:45] classic pinfest allentown fantastic up there in new england replay fx southern fried gaming expo

[43:52] and texas pinball festival people love all of these bill for different reasons what do you think

[44:00] is going to win and and keep in mind that this show normally takes place in texas right so that has

[44:06] a tremendous advantage when people are voting because they know that the awards going to be giving out

[44:11] you're going to be given out at tpf oh yeah well it's just such a shock too that how this all played out

[44:18] i think texas pinball festival would win and i'm gonna say my runner up would be pinball expo yeah

[44:24] i i would agree that tpf is going to be the one that wins this and i think runner up for me is going to be

[44:31] uh do do do do do do do do do replay fx replay fx all right i'm surprised you didn't say allentown but okay

[44:38] well i don't think small like knowing it's it's a tiny show i don't think it would have the votes

[44:44] all right favorite we got three more categories ready favorite pinball tournament or competition

[44:51] do you want to read these bill 24 hour final battle at the sanctum bad city open city champ

[44:58] san francisco i'm thinking uh grand ogre at grand old game expo nashville ifpa pinball

[45:05] limpix 2019 in uh folder germany indisk new york city pinball championship pinball asylum

[45:13] annual point monsters pinberg space city open texas wizard tournament and i think for me i think

[45:22] pinberg's gonna win this one man i think they really did a lot of uh uh lobbying for the votes

[45:27] yeah i i think pinberg wins too and and when pinberg opens up registration it sells out right in like

[45:33] matter of minutes now oh yeah it did it's like the elite uh tournament to try and get into so

[45:40] easily they they take this one um favorite pinball league these categories are really interesting

[45:46] i really hope jeff and and and when they do the show i really hope they kind of don't end with these

[45:53] i hope these to me feel like the best academy award for like foreign feature short in a way

[46:00] you know just because here's why because just the majority of people have no connection to most of

[46:05] this and they don't know about this stuff and so whereas like a pinball machine everyone is excited

[46:12] and and can connect to it and i think with these categories well it's just it's it's it's it's it's

[46:19] local these are local market things not they don't have national appeal like the games themselves

[46:24] and i and i have even said this with the content creators ours our content bill anyone can listen

[46:30] to it no matter where you are we have listeners all over the world every show does but a league

[46:35] only people in these local towns can really enjoy them but that being said the favorite pinball

[46:40] leagues are bells and chimes in san antonio since the pinball league in sincere o'hio dfw pinball league

[46:48] in douse fort worth kid force collectibles pinball league

[46:52] Nashville pinball league new england pinball league san francisco pinball department

[46:58] space city pinball league in texas the pinball asylum in florida the pinball league at the pinball lounge

[47:04] lot of pinball in these names right now pin the till studio pinball league in arizona and tilt

[47:10] town pinball in Wisconsin so what is the best pinball league you think do i i voted on cheer

[47:17] geographical distance to my house and it was title town pinball nice i voted for bells and chimes

[47:23] because i don't i don't women in pinball are in under represented part of the community and i

[47:30] feel they don't have much chance to be recognized in the twippies and bells and chimes has done a great

[47:36] job marketing themselves and becoming a movement and i believe there's bells and chimes

[47:40] chapters i don't is there is it only in texas i thought there might be bells and chimes

[47:44] chapters in other parts there's chicago too right so i i i hope they win because i just want to see

[47:50] all of the great female gamers out there represent it at the twippy so here's the the last

[47:57] category and maybe the most popular topic of 2019 yeah favorite pinball topper the most important

[48:04] part of machine when you're trying to save money if you're stern pinball uh we've got the 3d

[48:10] hologram topper light it pinball mods what is that is that the is that the night that's been

[48:15] anything spins around i think so that that's weird um alice kouper's nightmare castle topper that

[48:22] weird brain and it looks that thing is strange as well Beatles topper black knight sort of rage topper

[48:29] Jurassic Park topper by tilt topper right kasturne doesn't have an official one out yet right

[48:35] i don't think so mid evil man is remake topper chrisifer francey worked on that beautiful piece

[48:41] star wars the infamous star wars are to d2 topper three years in the making

[48:47] seven hundred fifty dollar topper right there only five hundred and the plaque is on the back

[48:51] can't see it that was at five hundred or seven fifty seven fifty three yeah the car made

[48:56] 500 of them yeah yeah and then we've got the monsters topper the kukuklock that also came broken

[49:04] and everyone had to go get them fixed and but it is cool it is cool what's gonna win dude i think

[49:10] medieval manus has this yeah all that if you ask me i think medieval madness is gonna win because

[49:17] everyone loves that 3d sculpted topper the black knight topper to me is the coolest topper people

[49:23] just hate the black knight pin it's a polarizing pin and even though the topper is really neat i

[49:30] think the black knight topper is going to fall victim to people's apathy towards the game itself

[49:36] whereas medieval madness people love the game yeah i agree with that but you know what i mean if you

[49:41] the only thing i wish was different is on the black night pro it had the upper playfield if it had

[49:46] the upper playfield man i think that game would have a stronger chance for some of these games and

[49:50] it should have because black knight as a franchise was always known for the upper playfield it just

[49:55] seems weird that they removed it and and and did what they did and and they never that game never

[50:01] recovered from sort of that lackluster launch it was hard because during has been making such

[50:07] popular themes for so long right they took a chance on an on an unlicensed theme and and the rest

[50:12] is history all right so bill this concludes and we're gonna make sure we mark down what we picked

[50:18] and and obviously after the twippy saturday night we will we will go down and see who was right and

[50:24] who is wrong maybe we get you back on bill how's that sound and we do a follow-up show to see who

[50:27] was right and then discuss what we thought of the twippies sounds good man sounds good let's do it

[50:31] and where are you going to watch from where you quarantined at saturday night i'm quarantined in a

[50:36] laundry room so that's fine uh that's uh home renovation projects i'll be working on the laundry

[50:43] room while watching the twippies right now for listener of the show the the twippies start airing at

[50:50] eight o'clock eastern standard time and the chat room opens up then so make sure you join early because

[50:55] i know there's gonna be a lot of there's gonna be so much good smack talking sort of uh you know

[51:00] community and everyone's gonna be like enjoying a great night of pinball it's super fun and it's

[51:06] i know we would rather all be in person celebrating at texas but what i love about it being this way

[51:12] is everyone can get to the twippies now and and experience it the same way and it's gonna be great

[51:18] yeah you know what man it's just about finding the new normal and a crazy time and all getting

[51:21] together and thinking about something other than toilet paper and quarantine absolutely and this is

[51:26] this is most likely bill the last thing in pinball we have to look forward to over the next few months

[51:32] i mean this is it everyone else is they've stopped making games shut down i don't know what pinball

[51:39] podcasts are gonna talk about in in in in two weeks from now which is gonna be canada i'm gonna
