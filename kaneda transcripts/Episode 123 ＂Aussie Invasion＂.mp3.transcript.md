[00:00] Come on little big house, so you're my kind of man.

[00:03] So big and so strong, come on little big house, so I'm all alone.

[00:08] And tonight is summer.

[00:17] Welcome to episode 123 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] I am Canada, your sober host tonight.

[00:25] We are going to give you all of the details you've been waiting for

[00:29] on Star Wars Pinball.

[00:30] Are you ready?

[00:31] Here we go.

[00:32] No, there's nothing because we have no details.

[00:36] The game is not being revealed just yet.

[00:39] I can't believe we're like this far in the main.

[00:41] We still have no Star Wars confirmation.

[00:44] But on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:47] I want to sort of get right to it in a second.

[00:49] We interview another really interesting member of the Pinball world.

[00:54] I talked to my first Australian Ryan,

[00:58] all the way over in Australia is a great guy.

[01:01] He's a pinball collector.

[01:03] But he's one of us.

[01:04] He's one of these guys that just can't get enough of pinball.

[01:08] And we're going to discuss the entire hobby.

[01:11] What's been going on lately in the news with Ryan.

[01:13] And I think you're really going to enjoy his point of view

[01:16] and his take on the hobby.

[01:18] Before we get to that, a couple of things have happened

[01:21] since I recorded that podcast with Ryan.

[01:23] Number one, dialed in.

[01:26] Number one has been built.

[01:29] All right, it's on a test rig.

[01:30] But you can go look in the thread and see dialed in at number one.

[01:34] Something interesting you guys should look at when you see the pictures of that dialed in.

[01:39] They changed the subway station.

[01:41] It's station number three.

[01:42] If you look in the upper left corner of that play field,

[01:45] completely new plastics.

[01:47] I think it looks really good.

[01:49] The theater, the quantum theater, the Einstein's quantum theater,

[01:54] looks really barren though.

[01:55] I wonder if they're going to probably going to put that quantum theater sign up on top of it.

[02:01] But that's really, really exciting that a dialed in number one has been built

[02:05] on the production line over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:09] We still have no information on the collector's edition and what that will entail.

[02:15] I wonder when we're going to see that.

[02:18] Other news items.

[02:19] So I keep hearing more and more of the rumor mill and Ryan and I will talk about it.

[02:23] But ACDC, ACDC, Vault Edition, it's going to be in front of Star Wars.

[02:29] It's another one of these horrible kept secrets that a million people are talking about.

[02:34] I don't really care.

[02:35] I think there's so many ACDCs out there already.

[02:38] It is interesting watching all these people try to fire sail their ACDCs and get them out the door

[02:46] before this announcement hits because if you're sitting on a premium and sitting on a pro,

[02:51] your values are going down, down, down.

[02:56] All right, what else happened in the news recently?

[02:58] So Alien Pinball has shipped a few machines.

[03:01] I saw one went to Florida and one went to Germany, I believe.

[03:06] And Coin takers said five machines are headed their way.

[03:10] What do I think?

[03:11] You know, Ryan and I will talk about this, but I'll say this.

[03:15] I'm glad games are going out.

[03:17] I still don't think this indicates production.

[03:21] And that's always been my main question with highway pinball.

[03:25] If they can't get mass production going, they're going to be in big trouble.

[03:30] One game here, one game there, one game here, that doesn't make sense to me.

[03:35] It really doesn't make sense.

[03:37] I don't know why there's not a huge container filled with Alien Pinball machines at this point,

[03:43] heading to the US.

[03:44] The other thing that I'm confused about is the guy in Florida's machine,

[03:48] is it a 35th anniversary?

[03:50] Is it not?

[03:51] Right, he's got the plastics that say it on the side,

[03:54] but nothing else that's supposed to be Ellie is in the game.

[03:57] So I don't know what's up with that hybrid.

[03:58] The last point I want to make is this, if you get an Alien Pinball machine and you got one recently,

[04:05] make a video, please make a video and share what is happening with the game and share the experience.

[04:13] Everybody out there wants to see the Xeno head working.

[04:16] So make a video.

[04:18] It's so easy.

[04:19] Tell your wife, honey, take the camera, film it, put it on YouTube so the rest of us can see

[04:25] and enjoy these alien unboxings that are finally happening.

[04:29] All right, all right.

[04:30] Now we're going to cover this and much, much more on this great episode of Canadian Pinball podcast.

[04:37] Enjoy.

[04:39] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[04:43] A very special guest, a collector, a friend who's coming all the way from Australia to talk to

[04:50] Canadian Pinball podcast, Ryan. Welcome to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[04:55] Get hang, mate. How you going?

[05:00] I'll just speak normally.

[05:04] Now, Ryan, we're going to talk just about what's going on in the Pinball hobby because I know

[05:08] you're a collector and I haven't really had many just Pinball collectors and I've seen pictures

[05:13] of your house and you've got a really stellar Pinball collection. Talk us through quickly,

[05:19] like how you got into Pinball and what's in your collection today?

[05:24] Cool, man. So my dad was a Pinball operator back in the 90s.

[05:30] It was kind of like a side venture forum and he would rotate machines around and he'd keep

[05:34] him in our garage at home. So I was kind of like the luckiest kid in in school because I'd had

[05:39] twice-zone fish tails, white water, Indiana Jones, Adams family. I had him all there and he

[05:45] was letting me test him out. He put him on nine ball. I would just sit there for five hours a day,

[05:50] just playing Pinball. And then kind of like every other teenager, I got a PlayStation and I just

[05:56] forgot that Pinball existed because you know what it's like when you know when PlayStation came out,

[06:02] you just mesmerized by yeah, great video games and playing online. Yeah,

[06:09] crash bandicoot and all that kind of stuff. So I literally forgot that Pinball existed. I'm sure

[06:14] I saw it out in the public but it was just kind of like a piece of furniture. I didn't say,

[06:17] oh hey, I used to play them. And then I subleased a property for my business off a guy called Dave

[06:25] and he kind of nurtured me the Pinball. He invited me over to his house and he just

[06:31] had this this room he calls the Danger Shed and he just had like eight like stunning Pinball

[06:38] machines and there in the corner was Indiana Jones. And I was like, wow, I used to play as a kid and

[06:45] you know, I'd like to say I got hooked straight away but it took me a couple of months of going over

[06:48] his house and playing and I kind of slowly you know got those those feelings back you know trying

[06:54] to recreate your childhood and whatnot when things were a lot simpler. I mean like how how old are

[07:00] you when this was happening? Uh, 29 or 2028 around that. So I'm 32 now. Okay. So I had no

[07:11] intentions. I just thought cool, I've got a friend who's you know, cashed up and has awesome

[07:15] pins. I'll just go over his house like two days a week and just play Pinball's non-stuff.

[07:19] Right. He rotates machines around and I said, hey, when you sell Indiana Jones like, you know,

[07:24] maybe that could be like, you might want to know the Pinball and he's like, yeah, sure.

[07:28] Sure enough, you know, the time had come and he said, you know, hey, I'm going to sell in

[07:31] you know, Jones, you want to buy it. And you know, he didn't rip me off. I was really lucky I had him.

[07:35] He sold to me for cost price and he kind of held my hand through the entire process. He was kind of

[07:41] like the guy teaching me the the master in the student and basically, yeah, yeah, I thought cool.

[07:48] I got one pinball machine and that's it. And you know fast forward a couple of years later,

[07:52] I now have 14 machines. I got the head 13, yeah, I added another one. It's like a it's a hobby,

[08:00] but it's also like a disease. I just can't I can't stop. You know, I can't stop buying a can't stop

[08:05] right. And he involves the pinball. You have a decent sized house Ryan. So you've got like room,

[08:11] right? Are you at capacity right now? Or do you feel like you've got room? I'm pretty much at

[08:19] capacity. Well, this is the thing I don't like having this many pinballs. I try and get it down.

[08:24] I'm trying to get it down to around eight pinball machines. Because I think that's the that's the

[08:28] right number for me. But every time I sell one, I buy two. And I'm not capacity. Yeah. Well, I mean,

[08:37] the pinball machine I bought the other day was it was a getaway high speed too. And it just came

[08:42] up on on Gumtree, which is the Australian version of Craigslist. And it was it was just too cheap to

[08:47] pass up. It'd been, you know, home you suddenly for 18 years. And I just called my mate Dave,

[08:52] the same guy I've been talking about. And we just went and picked it up. And I said, can you

[08:56] just sort of your house for a while? And you know, he didn't say no to that. So I'll have to

[09:01] sell a machine to get it to my house. But, um, right. So you got to run right? Yeah. Ryan, what's in your

[09:08] collection now? Walk us through real quickly. Like what you got? All right. In my collection. And

[09:13] I'll be brutally honest about my collection. Like I'm not going to be one of those guys that says,

[09:18] I love every single one of my machines. You know, like if a machine is shit and I still own it,

[09:23] it's still a shit machine. All right. So I've got, I've got was Ali. I got the Hobbit, your favorite

[09:29] game. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Mr. Floody. I've got Tron Ali, which I almost sold, which would have been

[09:40] the biggest mistake I've made. I got to start trickle a an AC DC premium. I've got a Metallica

[09:47] LED incoming. I've got a Ghostbusters LED. I've got a Spider-Man, Simpsons Pimble Party,

[09:55] Lord of the Rings. I've got two walking dead pros at the moment. I've got a fish tails,

[10:02] attack from Mars and the getaway that I just bought. Okay. So you're, you're, you're like a

[10:07] stern guy for the most part. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. I didn't start off as that when I,

[10:12] when I went to that guy's house and I started playing all those machines, I mean,

[10:16] what I remembered Pimble was being was this fun experience and everything. You know, nothing

[10:20] was too serious. Indiana Jones and Adams family. And then, you know, he had one wall was, was

[10:26] belly Williams and the other wall was Stern. And I would get on his machines like, you know,

[10:31] he had, I think he had like transformers and he's rotated around a lot. And I thought, man,

[10:36] this, this pinball suck, man. Like, I mean, stuff's going on, but it's just not fun. Like, where's

[10:42] the magic? Where's that, that 90s, you know, jovial kind of feel to pinball. And, and that's when

[10:50] when I started collecting pinballs, it was pretty much all belly believe stuff. And then I kind of

[10:54] got a bit better at pinball and I kind of started to seek out different things. And, and you know,

[11:00] I'm very interested in the kind of, not the psychology of pinball, but you know, like what makes

[11:04] people like pinball, you know, like you were talking about it with Scott Dinesy, you know, you like,

[11:10] you know, you love artwork, but you're also like the sound and this and that. And I think a lot of

[11:14] people don't, don't actually know, they can't describe what they like about pinball. It's just

[11:19] something that kind of comes together as a collective of like, it is this experience that you have that,

[11:25] you can't get anywhere else. Right. And one, I think too with pinball,

[11:29] and so you brought up a good point, the better you get, right? When you, when you improve as a player,

[11:35] it's kind of like playing golf. If you kind of suck, you'll, you'll probably only enjoy being at a

[11:40] driving range or like a mini golf course. But when you get really good, then you look for challenging

[11:46] courses that challenge you and that becomes more rewarding. So I think as people get better at

[11:52] pinball, the stern games with the deeper code and the bigger depth within the game becomes more

[11:59] appealing than owning a lot of the older games. Yeah. And I think the important thing that I've learned

[12:06] is that everyone, you know, there's no right or wrong answer. I mean, everyone loves something

[12:10] different about pinball. It's very personal. So, you know, and it's great that the hubby kind of

[12:14] has so many, you know, lays of the onion and so many facets like, you know, you all more of the

[12:19] collector. I'm a bit more of a, you know, collector slash player. And there's people that are just

[12:24] competition players and I might not understand the psychology of why someone would want to sit there

[12:29] for four hours in a competition waiting in line and then kind of playing without, you know,

[12:34] with all that background noise and stuff. But that's what they enjoy out of pinball. Maybe their

[12:39] skill level has raised to a certain point where kind of sitting there playing by themselves, you

[12:45] know, isn't as fun as it could be. So, for me personally, I mean, I'm not sure what you enjoy

[12:51] out of pinball, you know, what's your ideal situation. But for me, I do enjoy the social aspect of it.

[12:57] But to truly enjoy a pinball machine, it needs to be just me alone in a dark room, no lights at all

[13:04] except for the pinball machine. If I have a headphone jack, that's even better. But otherwise,

[13:10] you know, the pinball pumping full blast with an external sub and no distractions at all.

[13:16] And the distractions can come, but pinball is the only thing for me that if I'm watching a really

[13:23] good movie, there'll still be a little bit of downtime where I might check my phone because I see

[13:28] it flashing in the backgrounds or pinball is the only thing in this world that has my attention

[13:33] completely. I can play for, you know, a 30 minute session or an hour session and it feels like

[13:41] two minutes to me. So you get like in that zone and it's a good point. I mean, there's kind of,

[13:47] we live in an error now where most of our entertainment allows us to have multiple screens going at once.

[13:52] I mean, I'll sit on the couch playing Xbox with an iPad surfing pinside with my phone texting people,

[13:59] or why I'm playing video games at the same time. It's sad, it's hard to stop, isn't it? Because

[14:06] it's said you have that moment of downtime between like if you're watching TV, there's an ad that's

[14:12] playing or there's a loading screen when you're playing video games and you say, oh well,

[14:17] what's happening on pinside? I need to be up to date on, you know, something happened with Alien is

[14:22] a finely shipping, you know, but when I'm playing pinball, it's just I'm, yeah, I'm in the zone.

[14:28] That's the best way to describe it. You're in the zone. It's just you in the machine.

[14:32] Right. And I think that's a really good point. And I think a lot of us struggle to sort of

[14:37] articulate sort of what it is specifically that makes us so addicted to it. And I think a lot of it is

[14:45] by nature, our ADD personalities are associated by the immediacy of pinball. I think also just

[14:51] even like the the analog nature of it, the randomness of it separates it from a lot of the other

[14:57] video games and other forms of entertainment. So you've got the bug. And but it's not just you

[15:01] Ryan, like your country Australia is loves pinball. So explain to us like has pinball always been a

[15:09] big part of Australian culture? Yeah, I mean, even when I was, you know, playing pinball at my

[15:16] house, and every time you go to a bowling alley or a fishing ship shop, I mean, just like in the US,

[15:22] like pinball was was everywhere in the in the 90s. And you know, it was just it's just an exciting

[15:29] thing to do as a kid. You know, you had your little arcade games and stuff, but you know, as Gary

[15:34] Stern says, you know, the ball is wild and it was just fun to play pinball. And and I think the

[15:40] you know, pinball is now researched in in Australia as well. There are barcades popping up.

[15:46] You know, there's three in Melbourne. And there's a couple around the country, but you know, I think

[15:53] the US is kind of always a little bit ahead in terms of, you know, the kind of, you know, the way

[16:00] things progress. And so I think, you know, more barcades will still start to pop up in the future.

[16:08] And then there's you were saying earlier, there's 25 million people in Australia?

[16:14] Yeah, there's 25 million people in Australia. So I'm not sure of the figures, but we might,

[16:19] you know, we might have the second largest market in the world just for a single country.

[16:24] I'm sure Europe gets more as a collective, but you know, Australians, Australians love

[16:30] their demo machines like, you know, every, every allocation of I think, I think, you know, the

[16:35] figure I gave you the other day, I mean, gamers throwing, you know, there's about, like, you know,

[16:39] 40 or so LEDs that came down here. So I'm not sure how many went in the US, but if you kind of

[16:46] split the figures of the population of the US, I know, you know, 300 million people or so.

[16:53] There's probably more PIMPLE machines in here per capita. And there's a lot of

[16:58] re-imports as well, you know, so we've got the normal distribution channels that you guys have,

[17:02] you know, buy new PIMPLE machines, but there's a lot of, you know, when there's a gap in the market

[17:08] and people want old games and, you know, that it only exists here and, you know, collect as a

[17:12] hoarding them. There's a lot of companies here that, you know, literally you guys are doing it

[17:16] full-time, they just, they re-import machines. We call them container pins here because they come

[17:21] down in containers like in 40-foot containers. And, you know, they're all, you know, a couple of years

[17:28] ago, apparently, there were almost pristine condition pins. They just needed a couple of things

[17:33] changed, but as the time goes by, they kind of scrape in the bottom of the battle now and they'll

[17:38] import anything and they'll have to do more work and fix them up. And I know a couple of the guys

[17:43] are doing it and I've helped them unload the pins and it's crazy, you know, it's just you open up

[17:49] this container and the pins are all just lying there, they're kind of, they're legs off and

[17:55] they're all just shoved in there and it's not sad, but it's, you know, you kind of see the pins in

[18:00] this state and you realize how much work there is to kind of get them back to an acceptable kind of

[18:05] condition. So, sort of like pinball traffic and going on, just throw them in, get them over there.

[18:09] Yeah, man. And the one that how much cocaine is sitting in like, you know, like,

[18:13] right. Right, right. So, Ryan, is there, are there a lot of texts and people who really have,

[18:22] have really good knowledge of fixing these machines, restoring them? Do you feel like there's a good

[18:28] balance between collectors players and then also the text to help service and maintain these games

[18:32] for you guys? Yeah, there is. There's, I mean, Australia is a big country, you know,

[18:39] geographically, it's almost as big as the US, but as I said, our population, you know, there's only

[18:45] 25 million people here, so it spreads, you know, further along, there's no one living in the

[18:50] center of Australia like there is in the US. It's more along the coast. So, the community is

[18:56] pretty good. I mean, we've got Aussie arcade, which is kind of like the Australian version of

[19:01] Pinsides. And, you know, when I joined that, it was, you know, pimples pretty overwhelming, you know,

[19:08] like it's crazy to think how little I knew back then, how much I know now and how much I still

[19:15] need to learn about repairs and the history of pimple and whatnot. But that's the wild love,

[19:22] the hobby so much is that people, people in this hobby are more kind than any other,

[19:29] any other hobby or any other place that I've been, you know, like people are so willing to help

[19:34] you out if you have an issue, if you need advice on purchase prices. I mean, there's still people

[19:41] out there that are idiots and there's still people that are trying to scam every dollar off you.

[19:47] But Australia has a really good community and I remember back at, you know, you see a pimple

[19:52] in a different state and you can go on Aussie arcade and you say, hey, I'm after this pimple,

[19:58] but you know, I'm not sure if the pictures are that accurate and someone go and check it out.

[20:02] And people just say, yeah, cool, I'll go and check it out and, and, you know, they drive half

[20:07] an hour for a stranger and, you know, taking million pictures and report back, you know, all conditions

[20:12] that pimples in. So it's a really good community and there's, yeah, there's plenty of people

[20:15] to this, restores, there's this repair is, there's, yeah, it's a good community.

[20:20] No, it's great. And I think we see that both in America and in Australia and Europe,

[20:27] whenever you have problems, I'm always amazed at how quick the community responds to,

[20:32] no matter what machine you have, no matter where it comes from. I mean, I even got a guy to come

[20:37] look at my manager girl on Wednesday just from a Facebook post right away. Someone's like, I know

[20:41] a guy who does surface mount LEDs and it's literally this hobby couldn't survive if there was

[20:48] in that sort of community base that helped each other out because I think a lot of people would

[20:52] just get frustrated when something went wrong and they would just get out of the hobby.

[20:56] But because of that support group, it's great. Now let's talk, let's talk like,

[21:01] I saw a picture of you wearing a dialed-in shirt. Did Jack come over there?

[21:08] Yeah, Jack came over for, well, I guess he wouldn't call it a holiday because he wasn't here for

[21:14] very long, but we had our own little kind of dialed-in launch. I know you don't like the word

[21:19] launch because, you know, launch is meant to be the product shipping, but it's a reveal.

[21:23] We go sort of like, well, it's kind of like a reveal party or a...

[21:28] Yeah. So the distributor here is Mr. Pimble Wayne, he's a good character. And

[21:37] his friends with Jack obviously, the sole distributor here. And basically he came down and we had

[21:45] this kind of big party launch reveal kind of thing and then we had a private dinner with Jack

[21:52] and he was like, I think everyone that had ordered the hobbit or Wizard of Oz was kind of invited

[21:55] to a private dinner with Jack and it was fun, man. It was good seeing Jack in a non-sales environment.

[22:03] You know, he has to represent the company when he's at shows and he's a nice guy to talk to,

[22:09] but he's still asked to, you know, everything has to be positive and this and that, but it was

[22:13] really good to talk to Jack over dinner and get his really opinions on certain things and talk

[22:21] about all the hurdles he had to overcome to build Wizard of Oz and say what you will about

[22:27] about Jersey Jack, but the guys got some balls and he doesn't give up. He's got a real fighting

[22:36] spirit. I don't think, like, it's Stern's relationship with Spooky, they're not worried about them,

[22:43] but I think when Jersey Jack kind of came along, they pretend like they don't care because they

[22:49] own the market, but I think Jersey Jack made them look very lazy and I think it ended up

[22:59] benefiting them at the end. I don't think Stern helped them in the manufacturing process.

[23:03] You know, if Jack didn't say that you heard rumors about Stern kind of stopping Jersey Jack from

[23:12] obtaining parts for their machine at the last minute that kind of held up everything. So

[23:17] the fact that he's kind of making game number three now and everything seems to be going a lot

[23:22] more smoothly is testament to him as an individual, I think. Yeah, and I think Jack, and we'll talk

[23:28] about all the manufacturers, but I think he definitely trailblazed and showed that the ceiling for what

[23:35] you could charge for a pinball machine was much higher than even Stern imagined it could be.

[23:40] I think we continue to see that ceiling rising higher and higher.

[23:44] Yeah, and I don't think we've seen the end of it to be honest, but I think, you know, to me,

[23:49] Jack's machines in the climate today, I think they're worth the price when you put them next to

[23:56] what Stern is trying to charge for an equal amount. And I don't think anyone would disagree with that.

[24:02] Like you can't put a Batman 66 next to a guy held in and say these two machines cost the same amount of money.

[24:09] You love Batman 66. I tell you a quick story about Batman 66. I pre-ordered that. It was,

[24:18] I can't remember why. I think it was because I really, I didn't have a walking dead at the time.

[24:23] I didn't have a Metallica and I thought, when's Lamon going to do his next game? You know,

[24:28] like this guy's a freaking genius. I really want his pin. And when that first fly I got leaked on

[24:35] on Pinslide. I say leaked, but you know, like purposefully leaked.

[24:40] Arranging up the distributor and I said, you know, what's the deal? What's the price?

[24:44] I've got pictures and he said, we don't have a price, but if you want to put you, you know,

[24:48] since it's being kind of like semi-announced, you can put a $1,000 deposit on it. And I said,

[24:54] well, you know, he's a refundable and this and then he said, yeah, it's fine. I'm like, all right,

[24:58] well, as he said, there's 14 coming to Australia. I said, all right, put me down for one. And if it's

[25:04] crap, then, you know, I'll just, I'll just cancel. I think it was the next week. I got an ounce,

[25:10] you know, it was $14,500 in Australia. These prices include GST, which is like 10% sales tax.

[25:19] The sales tax for Australia isn't like the US. I find it really weird in the US that you guys have

[25:23] to charge tax within your local state, but if you get it from interstate, you don't pay any tax,

[25:29] which is just it's kind of, if I was a business, it'd be so annoying because all your customers are

[25:34] kind of like, you know, from a different area. But in Australia, it's one kind of like, it's 10%

[25:40] tax and everyone pays it regardless of what state you're playing in. So the games are more for

[25:47] you guys, right? And you're paying more than a small amount of US, or is it pretty, is it, I don't know

[25:54] like what the, your dollar is, but how is it compared? Well, that's the thing. It's just that like,

[26:02] I think back when like ACDC came out, like, you know, the LEDs were, I want to say around $89,000,

[26:08] which, you know, everyone back then was saying it was a rip off. But now they're like 12 and a half.

[26:14] And, you know, some of it has got to do with the small price rises, but most of it has to do with

[26:20] the exchange rate. So, you know, it's, it's pretty much a monopoly here in Australia. So there's only one

[26:26] central distributor, which is AMD. This is first earn, by the way. And then he kind of like has two

[26:34] sub distributors as Zack's musements and kids just want to have fun, just a bit of a weird name for a

[26:40] company, but it's yeah, they just kind of fight.

[26:44] I don't know if I was a single male into Canadian Pimble or Gmail, the common and let, let Chris

[26:55] know what it sounds like. I mean, kids just want to have fun. That sounds like a

[26:59] thing. I'm like a pervert. Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm going to send the guy.

[27:08] All right. Well, yeah, basically they're sub distributors, but I think I'm pretty sure they have

[27:12] an agreement with the main distributor that they can't, they can't lower the price. So the price

[27:18] that the main distributor decides on is the price. So it's kind of anti-competitive in that nature

[27:24] to not have two distributors, but I guess they're thinking, you know, Australia is not large enough

[27:31] to kind of support this kind of, you know, like two companies battling against each other.

[27:36] Do they do they adjust their price based upon market demand or are they just going with the

[27:41] price stirring recommends and keeping it there? Well, it's hard to know because I'm not sure if

[27:47] Stern recommends a price in Australian dollars, you know, I guess they've got their retail price,

[27:52] but if you do the mass, we're pretty much paying, we're pretty much paying the price that Stern

[28:01] announces in US dollars. So I know you guys have the your street price, which is a couple of hundred

[28:05] dollars off. You know, might might throw in free shipping or whatnot. We're probably pretty much

[28:11] paying the full price. So it's a little bit more, but yeah, I don't know. We don't have an

[28:19] number choice. I mean, there was a guy up in Queensland in North and Australia who tried to

[28:27] kind of circumvent the whole sole distribution of Australia thing. And this was recently, and there's

[28:32] this big kind of thread on Aussie arcade about and everyone was arguing about it. Basically,

[28:38] I think the way he did it, he was importing brand new Stern machines and people were saying,

[28:42] well, where do these come from? If they're not from AMD, how is your getting Stern machines?

[28:47] Because Stern wouldn't send into him. And I think people figured out that there was possibly a

[28:52] European distributor who was just kind of over-ordering. So say he wanted 50 Pimble machines from Stern,

[28:58] he would order 60. And he would say, okay, Stern, deliver it to this kind of like bonded warehouse

[29:04] and we'll get it shipped to, you know, whatever European country. And then 50 would go off to Europe

[29:09] and then 10 would go off to Australia. And he was undercutting the Australian price by about

[29:16] $500 or so. And the Australian distributor got really mad and there was all these emails sent

[29:22] out to all these customers saying, you know, I don't understand why anyone, you know, I don't want to

[29:28] say it's unprofessional, but you know, there were kind of, you know, it was a bit of FUD, you know,

[29:31] like fear uncertainty and doubt, you know, why would you say 500 bucks from a parallel import when

[29:37] we have like the best warranty service? You ship you any part. And in the end, I think they reached

[29:44] the deal and I think, yeah, the guy, the guy stopped importing them. It wasn't illegal what he

[29:49] was doing, but I think they put the pressure on him and maybe they're now supplying him at a lower

[29:54] cost so he doesn't have to go through, you know, jump through all those hurdles to do it himself. But

[29:58] right. This is what happens when you leave in Australia. Yeah, well, Ryan, wasn't there,

[30:02] wasn't Australia also where this guy said he was importing Wizard of Oz machines and then took

[30:08] people's money and then just disappeared. Am I making that up or is that? No, that's yeah. And this

[30:14] is the, this is the weird thing is that like, you know, I came into the hobby after all of that,

[30:18] you know, Wizard of Oz was my second machine and I went to play it at like this, you know, the Australian

[30:24] equivalent to the Pimble Expo and they've only done it once. It's literally like a once off. And

[30:30] I saw Wizard of Oz there and how the anyone was playing it compared to the other machines and I

[30:35] went on and I played and I was like, wow, this is amazing. This is what I thought Pimble was going to

[30:39] be in like the 2014, you know, like Stern hasn't progressed and and everyone was like, yeah,

[30:46] was sucks. And I'm like, you know, what do you mean? And like, everyone had bad blood because

[30:50] many people lost money and it's a long, long story. Maybe you can interview, you know, Wayne

[30:55] from Australia about it, but the very short version of it, I believe and I hope I'm not

[31:00] saying this wrong is that a guy basically, you know, a guy called Pop Bumper

[31:07] musements, he took orders for it and he sent a certain amount of money to Jack for the machines

[31:13] and he kept another portion of the money. I believe then he wanted to sell his business to kind of

[31:20] get out of Pimble. I think he was sick and I think he's actually passed away now.

[31:24] But someone bought his business because they had a lot of kind of money in the bank say that

[31:30] had, I'm just making the figures up, but just say for example, $200,000 in the bank account,

[31:34] which belonged to kind of Jersey Jack for the Pimbles. And these guys were like a professional

[31:40] scam is pretty much and apparently they're done at five times previously where they basically bought

[31:47] the company, funneled on the money out and then closed the company and skip off.

[31:55] And it's been like a long legal process and basically it was, the resolution was a lot of

[32:01] a lot of legal things went on and everyone got I think maybe like 85 cents of the dollar back

[32:09] and the way they did that is that Jack made a special, it's the rarest Wizard of Oz there is,

[32:16] it's the rescue edition and there's 23 rescue editions out there. And basically it's the same as

[32:22] the original alley that was in America with the wooden apron with all those signatures. It just

[32:29] has a different badge it says rescue edition. And the Australian distributed pretty much sold

[32:37] them on the side. So he had his normal stock, but if you kind of asked about the rescue edition,

[32:42] he would sell that and pretty much make a very small margins or nothing offered and the profit

[32:48] would go to the people affected by it. So people do you have a rescue edition or do you have a regular one?

[32:55] I've just got a regular, yeah I call it the peasant edition because there's so many of them.

[33:00] And it's funny because he made another version, you talk about all the versions he's made. It's

[33:05] an Australian down under Emerald City edition and it says like mine's another like 65 of a thousand.

[33:13] So I'm not sure where they put the number of thousand on there, they were never going to sell a thousand

[33:17] alleys in Australia. I think about 80 or 90 ended up coming to Australia and that's it.

[33:24] Now it's just the Ruby Red edition that he keeps on making. So yeah.

[33:29] All right well Ryan let's let's talk about because you and I talk all the time and we're

[33:34] we're what I love about Ryan is like we're like we talk about like what's

[33:38] speculating is hobbit. Yeah we're like what's going on Star Wars this week ACDC. So let's let's

[33:44] go through like the news items of where we are with pinball. So the rumor now is that ACDC is

[33:50] going to be vaulted. I think we've talked about it on this podcast. People are speculating rumors.

[33:56] I'm seeing more and more ACDCs go up for sale this week than I've seen in a long time which

[34:01] leads me to believe yeah that an announcement is coming. Do you think we're going to get an

[34:04] announcement this week that a new ACDC vault is is coming our way? Yeah well someone someone you

[34:13] know dropped some information to me yesterday and said ACDC vault is coming like this week

[34:20] in a couple of days and it'll be a pro edition and a premium edition and that's all he and I was

[34:27] trying to try to get more information out of him because I think he knew a lot more than he was

[34:32] he was saying but apparently it's going to be this week. I mean I'm not sure how you know one

[34:38] week might turn to another week and another week but it is crazy to think you know we're talking

[34:42] about it before you know like if Star Wars is getting delayed by you know to kind of help

[34:48] Erasmus sales then releasing another music pen you know yeah it's not as big a Star Wars but

[34:54] it's almost in more competition than Star Wars because it's a music pen you know would you

[35:00] rather have ACDC which is an awesome pen to rock out to or Erasmus which yeah it's all new and

[35:07] everything but it hasn't you know been tried and proven as much as ACDC. I really don't understand

[35:12] this move if this move does happen. All I can assume is that they just feel that Star Wars

[35:19] is such a juggernaut that it doesn't matter when they release it that they're probably trying to

[35:26] slot in front of Star Wars. Everything they had planned coming out for the next like four to five

[35:33] months just to get orders in but I mean I two music pins back to back I think that's more competition

[35:41] for Erasmus. I also think the big question is going to be the artwork on this ACDC version.

[35:47] Is it going to be hand drawn? I know someone was sending email wondering if they thought maybe

[35:52] Donnie might do it. I don't think that's going to be the case at all but I if it is hand drawn

[36:00] man that kind of sucks right for everyone who's got yeah one of the older versions.

[36:04] Well yeah I mean I don't mind too much because I bought my I bought my ACDC premium

[36:12] pretty cheap I mean relatively cheap to what they're going for but it was funny because when I

[36:17] was doing price research when I was buying my ACDC I was looking back at all the for sale threads

[36:23] on on Aussie Arcades and it was just kind of like one month at one year previous that people

[36:28] couldn't sell ACDC it was literally the worst title in Australia to sell because so many of them

[36:35] came down here. I'm pretty sure someone told me that it was it's the largest earn that's ever sold

[36:42] in Australia because you know ACDC being Australian you know the music kind of fitting and molding

[36:50] into Australian culture there were like more alleys went here than like any other country

[36:56] and pros and whatnot and apparently like every pub you know this is like a bit before you know

[37:01] I got interested in Pimble but people saying that every pub had had ACDCs you just they were just

[37:07] everywhere and then when people kind of got sick of them you know people really struggling to sell

[37:12] them and and I don't know what happened like in the in kind of you know a year after that just

[37:19] all of a sudden I guess all the ones on site kind of like slowly made their way into into houses

[37:25] and people just they just dried up you couldn't get them anymore and then prices just kind of shut

[37:30] through the roof and like the Lucy version here you know it goes for you know it goes for for

[37:37] 12 for $13,000 so some guy just listed a Lucy on Pinside for $16,000 US yeah is it is it not in

[37:48] mind it's new in box and it's he's got a ton of mods to go with it but give me a break my friend

[37:54] got a Lucy new in box I think Lucy's new in box are like six grand like 500 maybe set up I do

[38:03] like the Lucy artwork but I mean I don't think it's amazing I think it's just it's so much better

[38:09] than the normal artwork it's hand-trawn yeah it looks better it looks better for sure it looks

[38:14] better but it's not I mean I think if it was dirty dyno or you know I'm not sure if zombie yeties

[38:20] art kind of you know suits AC DC but I don't know these guys are talented they can kind of adjust

[38:25] their artwork I mean if it was one of those two I mean what is what is Lucy then look like

[38:31] this is Lucy then does it still have its appeal because it's one of 172 or how how many they made

[38:37] or is it now you know yeah I like speculating about which way it's going to go but yeah what's

[38:45] interesting is you know I just really don't know if trim package alone is really enough

[38:52] to make these machines feel different and collectible in comparison to each other right and I

[38:58] have argued this with Batman it's how can a guy who's spending the same $1,000 have the same

[39:04] game of a guy who's spending eight I mean if I go buy an AMG Mercedes with 680 horsepower

[39:10] I don't want a guy to have the same exact engine who spends half as much as me you know so it's

[39:17] I think I think the trim package being the only differentiator will not make the values be so

[39:24] polarizing I do think games will will start to come all closer together and value

[39:31] um but we'll see I mean look this hasn't really always a resistance though I think I mean like

[39:36] the Lucy one should be the the ultimate LA because it has the clear window and you look at some of

[39:43] the I can even my premium is it one of the older ones it's got the cloudy window and what not I mean

[39:49] I almost attribute that like almost the same as like the Ghostbusters that has like ghosting

[39:53] inserts you know it's this big giant insert in the middle and it's it's cloudy and you kind of like

[39:58] you know I don't really play the songs that that pump the ball down there but if you have the

[40:04] choice between like an alley um for the same prices are Lucy and one has a clear window one has a

[40:09] cloud a cloudy window which one do you choose um a lot of yeah but the the the pinball

[40:15] community is kind of like a buddy buddy club you know like there's there's a bunch of people you

[40:19] know this is not like some conspiracy theory but it's like there's a bunch of people that kind of

[40:23] control people's thoughts you know they say not you know the the back and black alley is the best

[40:28] one like full stop um and you know that that kind of changes people's opinions I think they might

[40:33] say yeah I guess the Lucy that you know isn't really AC DC it's it's just some random artwork like

[40:39] who's that who's that girl that that's not really AC DC if you're real AC DC fan you've got to get

[40:43] the back in black because that's you know that's it's one of their best songs so yeah I mean you

[40:48] got those people kind of controlling the narrative I think of of which one is the best and which one

[40:52] isn't I think we're gonna see the same thing happen with Star Wars or I really do with you I think

[40:57] you're we're gonna get the LEDs and then they're gonna make other variations of it they are they're

[41:03] gonna do like a Lucy kind of thing where they'll have maybe like a boba fat or like a Vader edition

[41:09] and they there's they're gonna make Star Wars for like five years and there's no way they're just

[41:13] gonna pump out the same premium for five years in a row like no way and it'll be like the last

[41:18] run of a different variation that will ultimately I think be the rare one to have um but we'll see

[41:26] I don't know this it's so hard to speculate on this stuff so all right so we think AC DC might be

[41:31] next when so when do you think Star Wars do you think we're gonna get it I thought it would have been

[41:36] next week because the May 25th is the actual 40th anniversary of Star Wars so why are they giving

[41:43] this AC DC before then well I guess as I said that I guess the dates as you said don't really meta

[41:50] because it's it's Star Wars and maybe the whole issue with Ghostbusters just through their

[41:56] their schedule totally out of whack because they were still producing machines even though they

[42:01] they kind of had those those teething kind of issues even with the premiums and whatnot

[42:05] because they they can't just stop production but because everything took longer plus it was a

[42:12] title that sold probably beyond their expectations um you know Batman kind of had to get rushed in

[42:19] Aerosmith was delayed I mean everyone talks about the Aerosmith code being awesome it's probably

[42:24] because you know it was meant to be shown at Expo and what did we see when we first saw AC DC code

[42:31] it was literally a copy a Zona AC DC Aerosmith code it was a copy and paste of this um

[42:38] kiss including the exact same sounds when you hit the pop bumpers the slings the super ramps

[42:43] and if they've changed it around and and credit them for that but I think we saw Aerosmith in its

[42:49] kind of state at at Expo it wouldn't kind of be receiving the glowing views it it has now so

[42:56] yeah Stern Stern sort of fumbled the obviously fumbled the Ghostbusters launch with all the quality

[43:01] control issues and then Batman just felt it's like like another fumble like they sort of they got

[43:08] delayed because of Ghostbusters they and then they they had a rush Batman out to coincide with the

[43:14] anniversary of the Batman uh TV show yeah so what's crazy about that to me is like so you rush

[43:20] Batman to hit the anniversary um and they're just like blowing past all the Star Wars conventions

[43:28] and May 4th date and now we have the actual 40th birthday for the franchise and I think they might

[43:35] just like blow past it all right and maybe just ignore everything and so if they do ignore it

[43:41] but I keep hearing that we're gonna get Star Wars on the line within 60 days and I heard that like

[43:46] a couple weeks or maybe well this is the thing I'm hearing about Aerosmith or this is the thing

[43:51] that I heard originally this is the first time I heard about Aerosmith was months and months ago

[43:55] and the person that told me about it said it's gonna come out you know that it's gonna cost more

[44:02] than wouldn't normally cost he said I don't know how much more but you know for example it might

[44:07] be a premium at an alley price and I said this was very very early on um we're talking you know

[44:14] four or five months ago probably um so maybe that might be true and maybe maybe they make less money

[44:21] off each pin but they don't mind doing a shorter run um you know but it's maybe they paid more

[44:28] like more for the license I don't know but the Aerosmith price is not it's not higher right I mean

[44:33] the pros in US dollars the pros 5200 the premium is what like 6500 and well that's a thing if they

[44:43] if they release some killer art package you know probably not I don't think there's gonna be

[44:48] you know an LCD and better sound you know just say it's just literally just a brand new play field

[44:53] with amazing art um new cabinet art I mean so you're talking you're talking about ECDC yeah I think

[44:59] you said Aerosmith so you're talking ECDC yeah okay okay so you okay so no no this makes sense

[45:05] now um so ACDC is going the premium is gonna be priced like the alley so that makes sense I mean if

[45:13] if you're involved addition ACDC and you've made some improvements to it um I fully expected to be

[45:19] eight to nine grand for the premium yeah so if if if we think about it that way then maybe they can

[45:26] slow it in you know they really know how to make them do a short run and um and then bring in

[45:32] Star Wars you know get it out of the way now instead of instead of lighter yeah yeah we'll see what

[45:38] happens I mean I I think yeah it's it sounds like ACDC's gonna happen and I think we're still

[45:46] gonna be waiting on Star Wars so I think that gives other manufacturer a break because I think

[45:51] when Star Wars hits man it's just gonna money's gonna go in that direction yeah and I think the

[45:57] thing with um with Batman you said you know why did they rush it out for the 40th anniversary but

[46:02] you know they don't seem to be going in that direction for Star Wars is that you know Batman was

[46:08] with Adam West and that guy that guy's really old man like old people you know one day they're here

[46:17] and one day they're not and if they're doing this special edition um you know you gotta you gotta

[46:22] do it while he's still you know about what about my carry Fisher edition what what's up with that

[46:29] I mean no too soon all right so not happening no look so I get it so okay so Star Wars delayed

[46:37] definitely helps out other manufacturers I think the other manufacturer which probably is just

[46:46] got their fingers crossed that Star Wars doesn't get it now and so revealed anytime soon is highway

[46:50] pimples so let's talk about highway because right and I were sharing some images today of what looks

[46:57] like the first alien Ellie pimple machine to ship um from the UK I think it went to Florida and

[47:06] we'll probably see photos going up tonight um now Ryan when you when you when you saw this like what

[47:13] what were your thoughts like do you feel like production is going over there or is this another sort of

[47:18] attempt by Andrew to be like a laser ship in just like I promised even though he said they would

[47:24] ship in uh large quantities yeah I woke up in the morning and I I had a little message from my mate

[47:31] Charles uh who I met up in when I came to Expo last year and uh he's like check it out alien L.E

[47:38] and I'll I just woke up so my vision's all blurry and and then he sent me a photo I'm like that's

[47:42] not Nelly that's you know he has checked it out and he sent some more photos he's like check out the

[47:47] box it says alien L.E. I'm like holy shit that's like a it's an alley without fiber optic ramps

[47:53] or fiber optic uh lights on the ramps um maybe they listen to your podcast and they they ran out of um

[48:01] cable ties or something um yeah I think with alien I mean we're in a pretty

[48:08] bad situation here in Australia because people that want you know you talked about hey if you want

[48:13] alien order from coin taker protect your money um that doesn't exist in Australia there's no coin

[48:19] taker here um Andrew has tried to get an Australian distributor multiple times but no one

[48:28] has agreed to his terms I believe I mean they all signed on the exposure agreements so no one's

[48:33] going to tell you what what what really happens but if you kind of read between the lines um I think

[48:39] Andrew's looking for someone to bankroll his business and say okay hey you want to you want a

[48:45] container of uh of aliens give us you know pay for it up and full and we'll deliver him within

[48:50] a certain time um but these distributors aren't stupid I mean they you know some of them went

[48:56] through all the delays with the hoverd and and you know the fiasco with wizard of Oz so you can't

[49:01] you can't do it because if a distributor does that they completely go against the piece of

[49:07] money that they provide their customers because let's say they do that let's say a distributor

[49:11] pays for 20 aliens up front right right Andrew would check 20 times eight grand 160 thousand

[49:18] dollars go to Andrew's bank account and then the games failed to ship when he promised right so

[49:25] then the customer goes you know what I'm tired of waiting I want to go get something else can I

[49:30] get my money back distributor doesn't have the money right then he's got to go to Andrew highway

[49:37] and say hey I need eight grand back and then what is Andrew highway going to say like oh that's

[49:41] I need 60 days now to give you your money back you know it would create this environment and that's

[49:46] that's the best case scenario right Ryan that like they actually even get their money back in two

[49:50] months worst case scenario if things go if things go awry and they're you know the guy forbid the

[49:59] company goes under then everyone loses everybody loses and and and then the law who gets sued for

[50:06] what right the lawsuit there's a customer sued the distributor does the distributor sue highway it's

[50:11] it's a dangerous domino effect and that's the thing is that when people get sued they didn't say

[50:16] he's everything I have like please you know don't sue me I'll give you 50 cents to the dollar back

[50:22] you know what does Kevin Kool-Key do he's you know well I don't I don't want to you know compare

[50:26] highway to Kevin Kool-Key but people have to defend themselves you know like they've got assets

[50:31] on the line you know the car you drive the house you live in they might have people they're

[50:37] supporting financially so they have to defend themselves so and every picture so expensive we see

[50:44] it when the J-pop thread it's like you are just like given up because you're like well at this point

[50:50] it's just it's it's it's not worth our time because John has a lawyer fighting on his behalf and

[50:56] he's got John in a protective bubble that okay cool like you could go after him with litigation but

[51:03] you could be doing that for years and and a good friend of mine who was trying to go after John

[51:09] would tell me every time I call my lawyer Chris it's 500 bucks so do I want to keep doing it

[51:16] it's um I know a couple of people that are in on alien in Australia and there was also a

[51:23] couple more people and this is what kind of made you join us yeah okay I think I was there were

[51:28] a couple of people on the forum saying you know hey I've got an invoice and I'm ready to go on

[51:32] on alien and I was just trying to I wasn't saying you know a darn freaking do it I was just saying

[51:37] you know these are the facts and and you know like maybe you should wait and um I was trying to get

[51:43] you to join in I was just like Chris like I can't convince these guys like please and then you did

[51:48] that podcast I sent it to him and I think they're finally kind of cool their jets and and taking a

[51:53] step back because as I said there's no barrier of protection for for IZs I mean you pretty much

[51:58] you're sending money to Andrew and and hoping that you know that money goes towards your machine and

[52:04] not someone else's well I think we're at the point now to with with highway where

[52:10] it we're not seeing mass production and it's games are trickling out and but that's that's fine

[52:17] like you know you can't just snap your fingers and have mass production um but if you're if you're

[52:23] thinking of getting an alien like you need to think twice about waiting for production to really

[52:30] ramp up or you could be waiting forever or you could lose your money so it's just smarter because

[52:35] there's no limit on the number of standard additions he's gonna make and almost every single item

[52:40] that separates the standard from the LE you can purchase from my life anyway yeah so there's no reason

[52:46] so let's talk about this LE that went out today because I'm curious about this one because I saw

[52:50] this and I'm like here we go like canate has been I've been saying um that alien LE's will not go out

[52:56] in June I've said it because I've heard from multiple people that Andrew did not order the parts

[53:04] for the fiber optic ramps in time to fulfill his promise of large numbers of LEDs going out in

[53:11] June and July so here we have a machine in mid-May arriving with alien LE plastics

[53:20] but that's it right there's no fiber optic on the ramps um we're not seeing any of the other

[53:25] armor packages because I believe for the LE2 there was the option of having green and blue armor

[53:32] along with black we've never even seen of those look like ever like even just in a a sample game

[53:38] in the in the warehouse so that's the thing I mean how how to coding can be done by you know a lot

[53:44] of companies and it just takes a day kind of thing um so I don't think that would be delaying it but

[53:48] yeah this seems like a bit of a weird hybrid machine or almost like he just said chip my LE like

[53:54] you can take this out you can take that I just ship my LE and maybe ship me the rest of the

[53:58] parts later and I'll finish it off yeah and and the same is true with my friend in Texas bride

[54:03] who's got a machine he's waiting now on a new Xeno head mechanism but this is not how it's

[54:09] supposed to be guys you're not supposed to spend eight thousand dollars nine thousand dollars

[54:15] and then build the ship in the ocean I mean these games should not be going to customers until

[54:21] everything is in them that was promised you know it's turned this and send out I think I think

[54:25] almost any I think almost any LE owner though if they could be this guy they would say yeah

[54:31] that would take it to me now yeah that would take it absolutely and like but I also think

[54:37] that part of me is like are people really gonna be fooled by this move like because here's

[54:42] gonna happen the other LE guys are gonna be like where's mine where's mine where's mine and

[54:48] and there's a new money yeah I'm what if per see I'm still and Ryan all I want to see all I

[54:56] want to see and all I think people should ask ask for on Pinside on Ozzy Arcade form just ask

[55:04] to see a Facebook live video of highway pinballs production just Gary does it

[55:11] they probably do it I mean you know and I know that things aren't moving along so they they can't

[55:17] prove it because they're not doing it so the best they can do is show games packaged up you know

[55:24] once a week or whatnot I mean we talk about you know production wrapping up and whatnot it's

[55:30] kind of scary to think that you know spooky how many plays the spooky have was it the 14 or something

[55:36] um you know it's to make rob zombies uh 300 rob zombies it took him a year um so over the making

[55:44] one like a year and a half yeah over a year and I guess they were still making dominoes and

[55:48] and going to shows and white night but how does yeah and that was after making 150 Americans most

[55:55] haunted full throttle as you know been produced in in small quantities than that um so how how do

[56:05] if there's 500 LEDs and you're sitting somewhere down the end or a standard version that you've

[56:09] just ordered how long do you think it's going to take them to get up to your number um especially

[56:15] considering that they probably have some cash flow issues and people have to kind of like jump

[56:19] the you know jump the queue when they when they have immediate money um you can't go for making

[56:25] a game you can't go for making 100 pens you just don't you don't acquire the institutional

[56:32] knowledge right to be exactly as you go from 100 to a thousand you just don't like it takes years

[56:39] and it takes um that institutional knowledge that only comes from learning how to do this like this

[56:46] isn't yeah like yeah you know they're doing it for the first time right like this is almost like

[56:51] their first pin because yeah you can make 70 pins within like a four-year period or however long

[56:57] it's been full throttle but you know I mean that's not really a production line you can just kind of

[57:01] sit there and make one at a time but you don't need to follow a certain um production sequence and

[57:06] well I mean you do to test them out and and to put everything on the right order but you know

[57:11] I mean you I'm sure that the method they they they use to produce full throttle is not going to be

[57:16] the same method that's needed to produce yeah and and and and there is always more supply of full

[57:24] throttle than there was demand always like when Andrew would show up with four full throttles in a

[57:30] box at a show there weren't customers wind up for those machines yet like there were an order is

[57:36] placed um yeah aliens complete opposite and see aliens got tons of demand tons of demand and will

[57:44] they be able to do it um we're we're gonna monitor it we everyone knows that I just gonna keep

[57:50] them honest like if you're gonna mail someone an Ellie a hybrid quasi Ellie um you know I don't

[57:58] really think people are gonna fall for it but then on the other part of my brains like Chris what

[58:02] do you what do you mean like absolutely people are gonna fall for it and just say take my money now

[58:08] Ellie's are shipping so look I think this hobby has proven time and time again people will think with

[58:14] their you know with their hearts and not with their minds you know they're emotionally attached to

[58:19] the theme and they're willing to forgive so much and you get more rope than anybody I've ever seen

[58:25] in this hobby and you know like will that rope run out in june and july if Ellie's are not going

[58:30] out in large numbers I don't even think so people will just wait to two thousand eighty nine to get

[58:35] their Ellie because they love the theme so much so yeah let's let's talk about what I think I

[58:40] want to say before you go on to the next thing I mean I think people give you a hard time on you know

[58:45] like the stick you give you give alien but knowing what I kind of like have learned in the last

[58:51] couple of weeks about about highway and whatnot like the it feels like a bit of a burden to kind of

[58:58] like know everything that you probably know and then you know not be able to say it because you don't

[59:03] you want them to succeed but you don't want people to be in the same situation as all the other

[59:08] manufacturers so you know I you know I thank you for kind of trying to keep them honest without you

[59:17] know without trying to to ruin them so to speak I don't know how to put them well I mean like I

[59:23] taken a different approach where and I think the word you use is accurate I mean it is a burden when

[59:29] people are just sharing with you tons of information a lot of which is is very can be very slanderous

[59:35] but very damaging and when I came back after my hiatus I said flat out I'm not I'm not going

[59:42] down that road anymore where I'm just going to believe in ex employees disgruntled opinions about

[59:48] highway and believe me I got a lot of that stuff now a lot of what those guys were predicting actually

[59:53] came true but it's still just speculation on their part that the company is in is in you know

[59:59] is in over their heads but look all like when you find out that information it's not like you're

[01:00:03] trying to say oh this is you know this is going to sink them and this is going to you just want to

[01:00:08] help people you know like you want you don't want people to lose their money because you know but

[01:00:12] I'll be people who love the theme of alien there's no helping them because people all they want is

[01:00:22] their precious theme like that that's all they care about they don't care as I said in one of my

[01:00:26] other podcasts they don't care if if a hundred people get burned by anger but they get their

[01:00:31] machine first and cut the line like I would I could argue that the whole cutting of the line

[01:00:38] paying full policy is is disingenuous I think it has to be done right it has to be done I think

[01:00:45] it's a desperate financial move I think in any other industry that would be shunned upon and

[01:00:52] would there be an outcry but because we're this tiny little hobby off from the corner

[01:00:58] nobody really is is aware of it like no one would really pay attention to it but it's definitely

[01:01:03] not a good sign it's definitely not a good sign that this is occurring and the the refund policy

[01:01:09] being changed in the middle of the game is not a good sign so look and missing dates by years is not

[01:01:17] a good sign so look I think it's I just have never seen a good sign so the to people out there

[01:01:27] the only good sign and the only sign that ever does matter is when a game ships and that's all

[01:01:33] I want to see is people get their games people who paid for it I want to see people get their games

[01:01:38] who ordered them first get them first I just think that's fair we'll move on to he's an angel wait

[01:01:43] one thing one second he's an interesting one when do you think game three is going to be announced

[01:01:47] because we know what that is let's just announce it on this podcast it's queen it's queen is it

[01:01:54] yeah it's fine yeah but he's he's and that's like my holy holy grail thing he's going

[01:02:00] the license has to have had expired he's probably going to have to renew it but you think queen is

[01:02:06] designed and ready for when I was listening to your your podcast about Andrew and all the kind of

[01:02:16] promises he made I was not kind of unaware that you know John Trudeau was working for him and

[01:02:22] and all these other people and it's just like you know he's known as as Dr Flash because he can pump

[01:02:26] out a design really quickly I mean is you know is queen going to be a John Trudeau design that

[01:02:32] he made how many years ago that's just been sitting there kind of collecting dust you know ready to

[01:02:37] go I think it's Barry's game I think Barry did queen because I actually hit Barry up too and it was

[01:02:42] just like Barry like and Barry's like I designed three games for Andrew and I'm just waiting for them

[01:02:49] to come out so yeah like design a game whatever these designers like they can crank him out I mean

[01:02:56] these guys are they're they're designing in their free time probably their whole lives and for them

[01:03:01] to get a theme in their head and make some adjustments and then okay here's a good design take it's

[01:03:07] like it's like when Dr. Dre makes beats for musicians I've got all these beats M&M and two Pock and who

[01:03:13] wants the good beats and these are the good beats like these are the good designs and then we can

[01:03:17] just slap a theme on it I mean you could do that with these guys so we'll see how many how many aliens

[01:03:22] do you think they have to shift before they have the credibility to announce game number three because

[01:03:28] I mean a cash injection from game number three you know that won't go to game number three that'll

[01:03:34] go towards building aliens and then he's just going forever behind but you know my good friend Greg

[01:03:39] mr. Rare hero he's always said this he's always beat this drum and people have ignored him because

[01:03:45] Greg always remember that Andrew would constantly say we have three to four games already designed

[01:03:51] ready to go right so Greg would always say well if there's a delay with alien artwork right if

[01:03:56] there's a delay with the license then why isn't game three moved up ahead of alien and and

[01:04:04] and manufactured like he's and it makes sense like Stern would do that right if there was a catastrophic

[01:04:09] problem with the license they would simply put another game on a line that's been in development and

[01:04:14] we've seen them do that so like I don't think I think thinking about game three for highway is

[01:04:22] it's so premature I think they're gonna have to sell more than a thousand aliens to sort of a thousand

[01:04:28] wow well to financially get into well I'm not well I'm not talking about actually making them I'm

[01:04:36] talking about them possibly using it as well kind of like what Jack did with the Hubbard I mean the

[01:04:41] Hubbard was announced so early and it was pretty much to get people to funds Wizard of Oz

[01:04:47] and he kind of ended up clawing himself out of that that financial hole but he didn't but he didn't

[01:04:52] he didn't claw himself out he got bailed out right with an investor and like it's that that's

[01:04:57] still like yes I give Jack credit for finding an investor like businesses need cash influx like

[01:05:03] they need investors like I should not be an investor for Jersey Jack or highway pinball I

[01:05:09] if I'm buying a product I'm not investing in the overhead cost of your organization I'm not

[01:05:15] giving you money to pay wages I'm buying your product right so I think that's the issue with all

[01:05:21] these pinball companies is people think they're buying a game when they're really their money's

[01:05:26] being allocated for the meant like the R&D for the overhead for the operating cost so that when

[01:05:33] comes time to make your game so Ryan if your money's gone it's it's been spent on a million

[01:05:39] other things except for the parts to build your game so man that has people in the background

[01:05:44] of the factory I mean they're every night they're eating your money they gotta eat they gotta buy

[01:05:48] foods where's that money coming from you know and you have to pay his employees look we'll see

[01:05:53] like I I just want to see him ship I think sometimes I get a rep of like I'm like I don't want

[01:05:58] these companies to succeed and I think anything's but the case but I will be the only podcast that is

[01:06:02] asking these tough questions to try and help people not lose money so speaking of not losing

[01:06:07] money Dutch pinball we're waiting still I Barry has been communicating to some of the owners but

[01:06:16] again there's he keeps saying the talks are going positive but people just want that green light

[01:06:22] like we've inked the deal do you think that's gonna happen soon yeah I think they'll sort it out

[01:06:28] I mean you talked about kind of you know contract manufacturing being their their downfall

[01:06:36] and I guess we've seen those those issues but yeah it would be interesting to kind of you know

[01:06:41] to be a fly on the wall in those in those negotiations and and to see their their books and

[01:06:46] and I'm not sure if it's his full-time job you know the um yeah but maybe the contract

[01:06:52] manufacturing might actually save them so to speak because you know they don't have a factory

[01:06:56] and they don't have all these employees they have to they don't have these crazy overheads that

[01:07:01] that everyone else has that you know they have to keep the line moving um right they're not going

[01:07:05] they might have to go into the red every day they're they're frozen yeah exactly I mean they don't

[01:07:10] they don't need to pay those employees that aren't making their games um and they need to pay

[01:07:16] their rent so I mean what what what is that company you're gonna do with those 40 big Lebowski

[01:07:22] sitting there did you really think they're gonna hold them hostage forever and then you know

[01:07:26] bankrupt the company and then sell them off at an auction you know I'm sure they think

[01:07:30] I'd be I'd be at the auction with like my canada games on top of like my placker like holding it

[01:07:36] up bidding on everyone be great every single one I'd corner the market I'd buy 40 of them I'd sell my

[01:07:41] near-experiment and I'd I'd own uh 40% of the Lebowski market if you grade people people would love

[01:07:48] that if you want a Lebowski you have to go to canada and dig him for Lebowski yep 50 grand 50

[01:07:54] you know I I miss a great troll opportunity to actually get a Lebowski like a couple

[01:07:59] months ago new in box and it would have just driven those owners in like my goal too is like if I

[01:08:04] really want to be a jerk troll I'd go get an alien right now and just be like I got wood um

[01:08:11] all right well what else is so dialed in are you are you in on a dialed in right now I'm not

[01:08:17] and there's pretty much the the first question that everyone asked me because I was just such a

[01:08:22] big shirt you won the t-shirt yeah I was just a big Jesse Jack fanboy and uh you know I bought

[01:08:28] Wizard of Oz I bought the hub and everyone's like well you got to get dialed in right but um

[01:08:33] the price here is is pretty you know it's up 14 grand you know which is one and a half thousand

[01:08:39] dollars more than a Stern Ali's normal price um so the price is getting up there and um I've

[01:08:46] played it and I love it and I'm kind of echoing your thoughts is that it'll it'll be the best

[01:08:52] game that comes out this year it it feels fun and that's what pinball is to me but there's

[01:08:58] something that doesn't attach me to the pinball machine yet I mean maybe that'll come with software

[01:09:04] and whatnot but you know without a theme it needs it needs the hook you know it needs like that that

[01:09:10] call out that you just love all that light show and um I haven't played it enough it's it's sitting

[01:09:16] just half an hour away I can just go play it whenever whenever I want at the at the Melbourne

[01:09:20] distributor um but it's a wait and see and it's I think it's also the whole limited edition thing I

[01:09:27] mean I'm not a collector but if you tell me hey uh you know doldens coming out there's going to be

[01:09:34] 500 limited edition machines um or hey uh total nuclear annihilation is coming out it'll be eight grand

[01:09:41] that that price you mentioned um the other day eight thousand dollars that's pretty expensive but

[01:09:46] there's gonna be a hundred or there's gonna be two hundred that makes me think oh shit you know

[01:09:51] like if I buy it I can play it and then when it's time to sell it'll hold its value um whereas I

[01:09:58] think dialed in at fourteen thousand dollars and I think you know two and a half thousand machines

[01:10:05] you're pretty much like when you buy it in L.A. you're buying a premium it's it's an unlimited ride

[01:10:10] Jack did that I mean remember the first announcement of dialed in he said there was like

[01:10:15] six thousand nine hundred and nine L.A. I was I was I was in the room I was I was there in the room

[01:10:21] like he said he said taking the piss out of like the entire

[01:10:25] positioning went but then he himself is like the ultimate culprit of sort of using words where they

[01:10:32] don't fit like limited and then a thousand here a thousand nothing's limited about it. He was

[01:10:40] he was almost the pioneer of of limited edition machines for Stern have you heard that like he was

[01:10:45] the guy who pushed Gary Stern to build um uh a lot of the rings Ellie um you know because he had

[01:10:54] customers in his Pimble sales business and they were like well one of the lot of the rings you

[01:10:57] want to lower the rings and he was telling Gary you know like he should do another run he's like no

[01:11:01] we've done enough runs and he's like okay well have it you do another run we make it limited edition

[01:11:06] 500 units we'll make a a backlash instead of a translate we'll you know we'll powder coat a gold

[01:11:13] or or whatnot um and then you know it's almost like Jack was the one who who created that business

[01:11:20] for first turn I'm like I don't think that was the first Ellie but apparently he was the one who

[01:11:25] uh and he was the one who gave him the idea about Shrek from family guy what he's like he jack

[01:11:31] gets it in the salesman he knows how to make stuff have a little bit extra bling and entice

[01:11:36] people and you know the collectors edition dialed in the 12500 are going to be pretty interesting

[01:11:42] I think probably half of those were legitimate lawyer fans JJP fans ordering like maybe 75

[01:11:50] legitimate orders came in then the rest are just going to be distributors picking them up and

[01:11:54] like I don't I don't think they're going to have a problem selling like 150 is still just 150 it's

[01:11:59] not that many um I don't think he has the collectors edition even figured out yet and it's

[01:12:05] middle of May because he hasn't shown anything like there's well it was it was weird it's like

[01:12:09] you know they they you feel like they kind of copy that off stern for the super alleys but

[01:12:14] why don't you copy sterns other business model of you know 500 alleys far around 500 and then a

[01:12:20] premium which you can just keep on building forever and then a standard version I mean that model

[01:12:26] works because you with the first 500 machines you capture the crazy people like me and you with

[01:12:32] that they just want the best um and then with the premiums you get everyone else that wants the

[01:12:37] best features but they don't care about a plug and Gary's signature jacks but jacks approach is

[01:12:42] basically I'll make an L.E. I'll make another L.E. I'll make another L.E. and that's people

[01:12:48] complaining about that so now he's like okay well there's one L.E. but instead of the being

[01:12:53] one thousand of them there's two and a half it doesn't I don't know it doesn't work I don't think

[01:12:57] it's a good luck in this strategy. Dildin's interesting because he's he's gone on record saying he's

[01:13:02] not going to do any other special variations of the game so you know we're not going to see like a

[01:13:07] black arrow edition the way we did with Harvey at the very end but I don't think that's 2500 of a

[01:13:14] you know a non-licensed game that's that's plenty especially at the at the cost I don't think

[01:13:19] they'll ever they'll never make that many in the game subtality they'll never get them any orders

[01:13:23] for it they just won't like and not with piracy and coming out and not with toy story after

[01:13:30] yeah and when people you know ask me that question hey rhyme like why aren't you getting

[01:13:34] adult in and when I kind of give him an explanation yeah I think it's going to be a great game but

[01:13:39] I don't feel like I need to rush and get it some of some people tell me well yeah that's

[01:13:44] you shouldn't be collecting pimples for that reason you know you shouldn't be thinking about the

[01:13:48] the financial repercussions of you know if you like pimples you just buy it and I'm like well

[01:13:52] it's not your money it's my money you know like if like if I can buy a pimple machine and almost

[01:13:57] guarantee I'm not going to lose like that that get away that I bought the other day then I'll buy it

[01:14:01] oh yeah you know yeah and those people say that there's nobody who who who basically buys and sells

[01:14:09] a bunch of pimple machines that doesn't think about the resell of it like they it's natural

[01:14:15] a little bit more relaxed than than others yeah but it's just natural to think like oh like

[01:14:20] like for example if I'm gonna go buy a car and I go buy a $60,000 hellcat I'm gonna get

[01:14:27] shit for saying hellcat because people get mad when I talk about it I know that when I go to

[01:14:32] sell it in a few years you know maybe I'll lose like 15 20 grand on the price if I go and buy

[01:14:39] a $200,000 like McLaren I might lose like 80 grand when the new McLaren comes out and that's

[01:14:46] just the nature of like if I was gonna lose so much non-essentials that you're treating yeah

[01:14:54] if I was gonna lose a lot of money off every pimple that I bought then I don't think I'd be so

[01:14:59] aggressive in my you know collecting nature and I don't think I think I feel a bit guilty you know

[01:15:04] like I'm kind of wasting money that could go towards my kids future and what not you know

[01:15:10] just to fight for people they're gonna go they're gonna go to school soon so you know if I can

[01:15:14] if I can have an awesome hobby where I'm pretty much just parking my money somewhere else and I can

[01:15:18] I can sell my machines anytime and make the money back then that's what so that's what I like

[01:15:22] about the hobby I'm not I feel like I'm not wasting money I'm just moving it somewhere and yeah

[01:15:28] anyway one final topic and I want to have you come back on and on a somewhat of a recurring

[01:15:34] basis because I think this is this has been great and we could we could talk about the current

[01:15:37] stuff for hours talk to me about because you're over there in Australia talk to me about Thunderbirds

[01:15:42] like what's the deal and the best you look at this thing like is the Aussie community the Aussie

[01:15:48] community like are they excited for this thing because no one in America is so what's the deal

[01:15:53] I think that the people that have pre-ordered and I think I know about five people that have

[01:15:58] pre-ordered so in my little pinball circle so I'll get to play one for sure I'll be there at

[01:16:04] at least one unboxing party but yeah I think it's a weird theme for me I don't get it because I'm

[01:16:11] you know I'm 32 his old and Thunderbirds is kind of this thing that maybe you're around if you're

[01:16:16] around 50 or 60 you kind of watch it as a kid and you know yeah the theme needs nothing to me

[01:16:27] it's very exciting that he's there in China getting stuff done you know it's a bit of a

[01:16:32] slow tease with all these little updates every once in a while but he's I think he's he's very

[01:16:40] very dedicated to the engineering of the machine but as you know when we're talking about before

[01:16:48] what do you like out of pinball you know you like the magic under the glass and you know there's

[01:16:53] something about magic or even though it doesn't work probably you love it because it has like this

[01:16:57] vision and this artistic nature to it I really hope because he hasn't revealed the pinball machine yet

[01:17:02] I really hope that he has someone working with him that kind of brings that magic together because

[01:17:08] you can have the best design pinball machine in the world and you know the lowest fault rate of

[01:17:13] a switch and the most reliable hardware in there but never breaks down but if it's not fun to play

[01:17:20] then who cares you know like I hope I hope it's a fun pinball machine above anything else above

[01:17:27] above it's yeah yeah I need a cargument I mean it's like so many cars are engineered

[01:17:35] amazingly well like the new NSX engineered phenomenally well everything thought of everything

[01:17:40] the best of the best of the newest technology but it doesn't have a soul and that's like a

[01:17:47] any good pinball machine right there's that intangible that only certain designers and only

[01:17:52] certain games bring that separate them from the pack of games that are just you know there's

[01:17:58] plenty of games that are really reliable that'll never break down plenty of games that are engineered

[01:18:04] like tanks but nobody really wants them because they don't sort of stir them emotionally or it's

[01:18:10] not like a visceral experience so we'll see what happens with Thunderbirds it's definitely a

[01:18:14] questionable theme I always wonder who does market research on these companies who says you know

[01:18:18] it's from my inaugural game I'm gonna do full throttle I'm gonna do Thunderbirds man yeah it should have

[01:18:23] been alienated it should have been big trouble in little China it should have been jaws you know

[01:18:27] I feel like Stern's got every major theme locked down but we'll see when when Jetson's got announced

[01:18:33] he went on Aussie okay and he was like ah you know Jetson's that was like on our short list like

[01:18:38] that was like one of the games we really wanted then I was kind of thinking well like shouldn't

[01:18:42] you've got the license for it then like if that was really a game that you wanted and you've

[01:18:47] been doing this for how many years but this is the question I want to ask I mean um you know maybe if

[01:18:53] you know after a while like his his his pins aren't selling that much maybe he's better suited to be

[01:18:58] a contract manufacturer kind of like what Charlie's doing with with Jetson's and Domino's because

[01:19:03] if he's there in China like people talk about Chinese quality and whatnot but Chinese make good stuff

[01:19:08] as long as you're you're there you know managing everything and making sure things get done

[01:19:12] probably so you know yeah I mean like maybe yeah if he can if he can help bring people's

[01:19:21] imaginations to life via pinball um I've yet to see that happen tremendously well even you know

[01:19:28] even though spooky all the games that spooky contract manufacturers are like they're very basic

[01:19:34] pins you know they're not really complex they're not at the level of a storm pro yet um you know

[01:19:41] so we'll see I mean I think you got to come out with home runs you got to you got to get a big hit

[01:19:48] at your first major league at bat when it comes to pinball and it always makes me scratch my head

[01:19:54] when I see these companies sort of it's like they pick a theme that ties their hands behind their

[01:20:00] back it's like why not pick a theme you know that just you know you know has like that cult following

[01:20:08] that would just sell out if your goal is to sell just like 500 of them you know just I don't know

[01:20:12] maybe maybe the license was easy to get but we'll see I mean now that it's going to be a cheaper

[01:20:17] pinball so we'll actually see if people put their money where their mouth is when they say I'm out at

[01:20:22] this price you know new pinball pricing is too much you know so if he releases his pinball machine

[01:20:28] it's cheaper than a storm pro will that make people actually buy new people machines again or

[01:20:34] people just just boasting on the inside you know they look at the pin is good if the pins good

[01:20:39] the pin will sell we have we've seen that happen all right all right and I really appreciate you

[01:20:43] you're just like starting your day today I'm about to close out my day watch the basketball game

[01:20:48] the end of the basketball game here but I appreciate you coming on I love your point man in the hobby

[01:20:59] a big shout out to my wife who uh you know a lot of people go through divorces and crazy stuff when

[01:21:05] they get into pimple because it kind of overtakes their life but um yeah I've got I got 12, 13

[01:21:16] about so I do love her and a big shout out to her and and everyone in the strength community that's

[01:21:21] kind of embraced me as a a new person in the hobby and um yeah thanks for having what you're

[01:22:04] me add a little bit of an exit or outro for Ryan on this podcast so here's my thing I love people

[01:22:13] like Ryan I love the thousands of you guys out there who have a strong point of view about pinball

[01:22:19] and I love the fact that this hobby connects people like I have friends now in Australia friends in

[01:22:24] Europe friends in the south friends on the west coast friends in Canada all because of pinball

[01:22:30] and I and I think that's incredible um and for you out there who's a listener of the show if you

[01:22:52] of view I mean it's great it's it's it's it's refreshing um I love coupling that with talking to

[01:22:59] some of the luminaries in the hobby that are actually making pinball machines and it's a good mix

[01:23:04] I think it's a good mix and then you're also going to get canada solo ranting and raving all the time

[01:23:08] as well um but that was it episode 123 um disappointing that we're not getting star wars this week
