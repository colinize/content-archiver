[00:00] I'm glad Rush Pinball is exciting Rush fans, but we need a little reminder of what high energy rock and roll is.

[00:14] I mean, come on. The greatest vocalist ever.

[00:22] Women actually like this music.

[00:24] Can a Rush show start like this?

[00:30] Just picture all those Rush fans, all men sweating in their shirts.

[00:38] And G&R.

[00:42] Rule the world, 100 million albums sold.

[00:47] Can we all get along?

[00:50] Need more of a reminder?

[00:52] Just let it play for a little bit.

[00:56] I mean, come on. This ain't no top Sawyer.

[01:02] Alright, we're gonna talk about Rush on this episode.

[01:06] Canadian Pinball Podcast, let's get in.

[01:13] Can't we all get along in the pinball world?

[01:16] Maybe that toxic figure Canadian is the best.

[01:19] I want to give you my feelings on Rush Pinball.

[01:22] We saw a two and a half hour stream last night of Jack Danger, Ray Day, Tim Sexton, playing the game.

[01:29] John Borg was in chat. What do I think of this pinball machine and what kind of impact do I think Rush Pinball is going to have in the pinball world?

[01:37] I want to start out by saying this. I watched the stream for like a half hour.

[01:41] I couldn't take any more. It's not because I'm a big fan of Rush.

[01:44] I'm not playing this. I watched the stream for like a half hour.

[01:47] I couldn't take any more. It's not because they were doing a bad job.

[01:50] It's just watching pinball for the length of a Lord of the Rings movie is not how I want to spend my Friday night.

[01:58] So here's my feeling first and foremost from a macro level.

[02:02] I want to say the most important goal was accomplished.

[02:06] If you're a Rush fan, you are super happy with this machine.

[02:11] This is the greatest music integrated pinball machine that Stern Pinball has ever made.

[02:18] Is it the greatest music integrated pinball machine of all time?

[02:22] Well, we're going to talk about that because it's going head to head with Guns N' Roses.

[02:26] But as a Rush fan, you must be walking away from this stream being like,

[02:31] thank you so much, John Borg, that you were able to convince the people over at Stern

[02:36] that we should take a chance on a band that's not at the same level or caliber of what we usually make,

[02:44] which are more mainstream hits like ACDC, Metallica, Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, The Beatles.

[02:52] So this was a little bit of a roll of the dice and it has worked out beautifully,

[02:57] especially if you're a Rush fan.

[03:00] I want to say, as I was watching the stream and I was seeing Rush fans so excited about this pin,

[03:07] I honestly mean this when I say it.

[03:09] I'm excited for you.

[03:11] I want you to get your dream theme and I want your dream theme to be made amazing into pinball format.

[03:19] What you're feeling when you look at Rush is how Guns N' Roses fans feel when they play Jersey Jack Guns N' Roses.

[03:28] Your elation is our elation over on the G&R side.

[03:32] And I just want everybody to realize that is that is the point of pinball.

[03:37] We want themes we love and we want them to be brought to life in a way that excites us.

[03:43] And I'm going to explain why on this podcast.

[03:45] I think dream themes that hit it out of the park for the fans of those themes.

[03:51] It's going to do the most incredible and important thing in all of pinball.

[03:55] Are you ready for it?

[03:56] It's going to satiate you.

[03:58] It's going to satisfy you.

[04:00] And when you get a few dream themes that are done really well, right?

[04:04] With good layout and good code and everything you want.

[04:08] Then you don't need to chase after every single new machine that comes out.

[04:13] You don't have to convince yourself you need to keep looking for stuff to make you happy in the pinball world.

[04:18] And I've been saying this to people.

[04:20] Imagine how free and liberating it is when you get just a handful of dream themes and then you're done.

[04:27] You don't have to buy everything that comes out.

[04:29] You don't have to chase the FOMO.

[04:31] You don't have to keep shuffling games in and out of your game room because you're just happy with these games.

[04:37] Because these games mean a lot to you.

[04:39] And I saw a lot of Rush fans with that kind of elation.

[04:43] With that kind of emotion saying I can't wait to get this.

[04:46] This game is going to be bolted to my floor.

[04:48] And I want to say to everyone out there who's a Rush fan, I'm happy for you.

[04:52] I am legitimately happy for you.

[04:54] Now that being said, I will analyze this game a little bit on what I think were the hits and the misses of the title itself.

[05:00] Just from an outsider looking in.

[05:02] And I have said to you from day one, I'm not a Rush fan.

[05:05] I'm not buying this pinball machine because I don't understand how you buy a pinball machine based on a musical act.

[05:12] If you don't like that musical act.

[05:14] It's just that simple.

[05:16] If you buy CDs of people you don't enjoy, you love music.

[05:20] Doesn't mean you buy their CD.

[05:22] The same is true in pinball for me.

[05:24] If I love pinball and I love music, I'm only going to buy pinball that's based on music if I love the music.

[05:31] Because there's so much other pinball out there that I don't have to hear Iron Maiden if I can't stand them.

[05:37] I don't want to have to hear Rush if I don't love them.

[05:40] But I'm happy fans of Rush are getting their pin.

[05:43] Now, let's talk about the other thing I saw all throughout the chat last night.

[05:47] Which was probably the most annoying thing.

[05:51] And that is, people couldn't just enjoy Rush.

[05:55] They had to say, this game is great and GNR sucks.

[05:59] I heard a lot of that.

[06:00] Like the comparison to Guns N' Roses.

[06:02] And I'm going to talk a lot about this on this episode because I think the comparisons are somewhat fair.

[06:09] And I'll tell you why they're somewhat fair.

[06:11] Because Stern learned a lot from what Jersey Jack did with GNR.

[06:15] And both bands were involved heavily in the making of their pinball machines.

[06:20] And that is why the comparisons are happening.

[06:23] And so we're going to talk about these two machines and how they compare.

[06:27] Now, before we do that, it's all subjective.

[06:30] If you love your GNR, that's what pinball is supposed to do.

[06:34] If you love your Rush, that's what pinball is supposed to do.

[06:38] That's the thing with music pins is tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people that love these bands.

[06:45] They're coming to these games with a lot of love.

[06:49] With a lot of emotion.

[06:51] With a lot of passion.

[06:52] And that's why this debate happens.

[06:55] Nobody is going to go to like fathom with that love or emotions.

[06:59] No one's going to go to legends of Vahala and care at all.

[07:03] No one's going to go to games like Ultraman and have that same level of passion.

[07:07] And that is why music pins, they really do spark such debate and spark such animosity and love at the same time.

[07:16] So what did I think of the game?

[07:18] Well, it's a John Borg game.

[07:20] It's a John Borg layout and it shoots phenomenally well.

[07:25] John Borg knows how to make a game shoot with high energy and satisfying shots.

[07:31] Because we've seen this layout over and over and over again.

[07:37] And he's made a few changes.

[07:38] He's tweaked some things, but for the most part, this is a game that looks like X-Men and Ninja Turtles.

[07:44] And he stole the little stuff from Iron Maiden had a baby together.

[07:48] But it's primarily X-Men and like Tron combined in this game.

[07:52] And so look, it's a fan layout with a third flipper, right?

[07:56] Nothing revolutionary happening there.

[07:58] But the tweaks he made in this game are like X-Men, but he made X-Men better.

[08:03] I think that's the easiest way to think about this game.

[08:05] So it's going to shoot well.

[08:07] Stern is not stupid.

[08:09] Here's the thing about Stern.

[08:10] They know that fan layouts work.

[08:13] Why does Brian Eddy keep doing fan layouts?

[08:15] They know that fan layouts are very satisfying to shoot.

[08:19] The thing is this, Stern Pimball does not take a lot of risks.

[08:23] They don't take a lot of chances.

[08:25] They don't want to mess with the formula that they know satisfies so many people out there.

[08:31] And I can't blame them.

[08:33] I really can't blame them.

[08:34] Now I'm going to go to the other side of the fence, the Jersey Jack comparison.

[08:38] What I do like about Jersey Jack Pimball is that each of their games feels radically different.

[08:44] And if you collect each JJP game, you can put them in a lineup and they're all radically different.

[08:50] But if you collect Stern machines, I think you're going to see a lot more similarity in gameplay.

[08:55] You just are from a layout standpoint.

[08:57] So the game looks like it shoots phenomenally well.

[09:01] It has a lot of energy to it.

[09:03] And I think the energy of the gameplay coupled with the Rush music is a home run in this game.

[09:09] It really is.

[09:10] And I saw one indictment of G&R and I'm going to talk about it now that says this game has way more rock and roll energy from a gameplay standpoint than guns and roses.

[09:19] And I'm going to tell you right now on Canada's Pimball podcast, I agree with that.

[09:24] I agree with that.

[09:25] And there is more energy and there is more velocity and there is just a lot more flow happening in this game than guns and roses.

[09:34] And if there's one thing Jersey Jack Pimball needs to do, they need to understand that.

[09:39] Like I'm not going to sit here and defend the fact that G&R does play slower.

[09:43] That G&R has more shots much closer to the flippers.

[09:47] Stern moves stuff back more on the playfield so you get a lot more energy.

[09:52] And the middle of the Stern game, like look at Rush, the entire middle of that game is wide open to create lanes and speed for gameplay.

[10:01] When you look at guns and roses, like that scoop is pretty much like halfway down the playfield.

[10:07] And all of the shots are much closer to the flippers.

[10:10] A lot harder to create flow that way.

[10:13] A lot harder to see where the ball is going at the top of the playfield.

[10:17] So Stern from a gameplay standpoint absolutely laps all Jersey Jack games.

[10:23] It just does.

[10:24] I've said it from day one.

[10:25] Now the Pat Lawler games play better.

[10:28] And I think this is something Eric Minier needs to work on on his future titles is some of that flow.

[10:33] But that being said, that being said, I think Stern is getting way too much credit for flow and gameplay.

[10:40] And there's still not that many toys in this machine.

[10:43] Really, when you look at this game, everyone's like, it's packed.

[10:46] It's not packed, people.

[10:48] It's not packed at all.

[10:50] The day we start considering diverters to be something that's packing a machine, where are the toys in this game?

[10:57] And I will say that time machine, that time machine does not create the level of awe that the ring did in Lord of the Rings.

[11:05] It just doesn't have that impact.

[11:07] And there aren't any toys in this game that are really doing anything that interact with the ball or feel like a wow moment.

[11:14] And I would say that from an overall standpoint, there's nothing happening in this game on any level other than the code, the music and the integration of it all.

[11:23] But I just mean from a very physical standpoint, there's nothing physical or visual to look at that's a wow.

[11:30] There's nothing happening to the ball that's a wow.

[11:32] I would say, you know, there's no real crazy magic from a mechanical standpoint in this game.

[11:38] And that's going to be fine for Rush fans because again, I think music pins are different than movie and TV pins.

[11:44] I think music pins are more about the music and more about the energy and more about teleporting the player into the world of that band.

[11:53] And I think this game does it tremendously well.

[11:56] And as I was looking at the game, I was like, wow, this game is kind of just like Guns N' Roses in which they're using a lot of concert footage.

[12:04] I think they learned from the JJP launch of G&R how to really integrate, but they're very different.

[12:10] And I want to explain what the differences are.

[12:12] When you look at Rush, it's not like you're going to a Rush concert.

[12:16] When you start a Rush mode or you start a song, it's like you're playing the song.

[12:22] And that's a huge, huge difference.

[12:24] The Guns N' Roses machine is really set up to teleport you as if you're at a G&R show.

[12:32] And everything happening in the game is synced up with the song perfectly.

[12:37] And I mean that, like the light shows and the way they timed it with each song, that's the real magic of G&R.

[12:45] That's not what's happening at Rush.

[12:48] When you play Rush, they're tapping into more of the energy of the song itself and the shots are syncing up with you progressing through the song.

[12:56] Completely different strategy.

[12:58] And again, I think both of them execute at that approach very, very well.

[13:03] And they're different.

[13:05] And it's okay that they're different.

[13:07] And I applaud the fact that they tried something new, but you got to give Jersey Jack credit for showing Stern how to properly make a music pin.

[13:16] And everyone can agree.

[13:17] You could argue back and forth between Guns N' Roses and Rush.

[13:20] The good news is this, we all agree that Led Zeppelin sucks because it didn't do any of that.

[13:26] And Led Zeppelin is going to go down as probably one of the worst music integrated pinball machines ever, especially now that we saw how they made Rush.

[13:35] Okay?

[13:36] So that's a good thing, right?

[13:37] Sometimes it's good that we can cross the divide and get along because we all don't like one thing and that's Led Zeppelin pinball.

[13:44] Okay.

[13:45] And the gameplay is great.

[13:46] I think the music is great.

[13:48] I think the concert footage is great.

[13:50] But one big letdown from last night's stream, I think the callouts are bad.

[13:56] And I thought they were monotone and I thought they lacked all this emotion.

[14:00] And after watching that video of how Ed was in the studio with them guiding them through the callouts, I will say this, Ed Robertson, you might not want to leave your day job and become someone who directs people in the studio for callouts.

[14:13] Because it's just not there.

[14:15] Like the energy level, there was just a disconnect.

[14:17] Every time I heard a callout, it just felt very monotone.

[14:21] It lacked the energy.

[14:23] It just didn't feel connected to the game.

[14:25] It just felt a little weird.

[14:27] And I will say the Guns N' Roses callouts from the band members are phenomenal and they're much better than the callouts in Rush.

[14:34] And I know people were excited that the band was doing callouts, but they're not good.

[14:38] They're not good.

[14:39] The callouts in Iron Maiden are so much better.

[14:43] And it's almost like would you rather have the band members do callouts that aren't good or have voice actors who know what they're doing do callouts that actually make the game better.

[14:54] That's an interesting debate.

[14:55] I don't know because I kind of feel like these callouts are letting people down.

[14:59] The other part that I would say is a letdown is the art.

[15:03] And there's no way around it.

[15:04] Every time I was looking at the stream, I couldn't help but feel like Stern missed a golden opportunity here to make a play field really be as beautiful as the rest of the experience in this game.

[15:15] It is one of the most mediocre play field art packages we've seen and you can't change it.

[15:20] I see people already saying they want to try to put a sticker over those three characters.

[15:24] Come on, you really can't do that.

[15:26] It's not going to work out.

[15:27] And it's surprising to me that they missed on the artwork so badly because when you think about it, John Borg has seen what Yeti's done in Christopher Franchi and I would have gone and got a much better artist for this game.

[15:40] There's just something about it.

[15:41] It feels like a 1970s lunchbox as I'm looking at the center of that play field and it's just very barren.

[15:47] It's like you've got these three like poorly illustrated versions of the band.

[15:52] It doesn't even look like them to be honest.

[15:54] It really doesn't.

[15:55] It looks more like Spinal Tap.

[15:56] And then you've got really nothing else going on.

[15:59] That's very interesting from an artistic standpoint.

[16:01] All right.

[16:02] What else do I like about the pin?

[16:04] The light show is great.

[16:05] The expression lighting is really neat.

[16:07] There's not a ton of lights in this game.

[16:10] I do encourage all of you out there that we're talking smack about GNR saying it's just a box of lights.

[16:15] Go watch a Guns N' Roses stream and put it next to Rush.

[16:18] And I think we need to stop slamming Guns N' Roses for being just a box of lights.

[16:23] And here's why.

[16:24] Because it is so much more than that.

[16:26] And if you don't think so, then you've never really played the game

[16:29] and you don't even understand the rules of Guns N' Roses.

[16:32] And the other part is this.

[16:33] Guns N' Roses is the greatest light show in the history of pinball.

[16:38] It gave people an experience in a pinball machine that they had never experienced before.

[16:44] Rush doesn't do that on any level.

[16:46] So why are we slamming that?

[16:48] Guns N' Roses won every single award it was up for in the award shows last year.

[16:54] Why are we now saying it's a terrible game?

[16:56] I'm going to explain why I think people turn so much against Guns N' Roses.

[17:00] But why? Why do we do this?

[17:02] It does a game that does something incredibly innovative,

[17:05] stopping innovative a year later just because it's made by another company.

[17:09] And I think we need to stop with this.

[17:11] I think we need to stop with this like all of a sudden newfound hate for Guns N' Roses.

[17:16] And it's okay for you to love Stern and love Rush,

[17:19] but to not give Eric and slash credit for what they created,

[17:23] Guns N' Roses aesthetically, aesthetically is so much more beautiful than Rush.

[17:29] It's not even funny when you put them next to each other.

[17:31] And I just want to say that like both of them are great in their own way.

[17:35] And it's okay to say that, but I was just saying a lot of G&R hate and people come at me

[17:40] because I love Guns N' Roses.

[17:42] So, well, of course you're biased.

[17:44] Well, of course I'm biased because I love Guns N' Roses.

[17:46] I don't love Rush.

[17:48] Okay, we've got great gameplay.

[17:50] We've got a great light show.

[17:52] We've got mediocre callouts.

[17:53] We've got mediocre artwork.

[17:55] The other part about this game that I think is a big question mark for many people is,

[17:59] how hard is it?

[18:00] Like those out lanes seem pretty brutal.

[18:02] And the people playing last night were really good.

[18:04] And you're not going to know until you get your machine.

[18:06] But I do think Rush could be a pretty brutal game.

[18:10] I hope it's not.

[18:11] But Borg really struggles with out lanes.

[18:13] I think he really does.

[18:14] I think he gets insecure that his games might be a little too easy.

[18:17] So he makes them too hard.

[18:19] And I get you can move the post, but people don't want to.

[18:21] They want the designer to send the game to them the way the game was designed to be played.

[18:26] So we will see how hard it is.

[18:28] The last point I want to make when I was watching the stream last night is,

[18:32] I do think Stern has a tendency lately to get a little too over complicated with the code and what's going on.

[18:38] What I like about Guns N' Roses is the simplicity of it.

[18:42] You're at a concert and you're starting a song and you're trying to get to the encore.

[18:47] Get all the way through the song and get your jackpot.

[18:50] Now, when people complain about G&R having too many multi-balls,

[18:53] it's because they don't know how to play the game.

[18:55] The whole point of playing the game is setting up your jackpot when you start a song.

[19:00] And you do that before you start the song.

[19:02] And you do that before all the multi-balls are going.

[19:05] But again, a lot of people don't want to learn how to play the game.

[19:07] They just want to insult it.

[19:09] But when you start a Guns N' Roses song, what I love about it,

[19:12] you're at the concert, Axel and Band are playing, and there's like the meter on the right side.

[19:17] But you're seeing the full performance in full HD, and the whole point is to not get boot off stage.

[19:23] And so you're hitting different shots to stay on stage and get the crowd going.

[19:27] It's awesome. It's simple.

[19:29] And what I like about it, they don't interrupt the concert footage very much.

[19:32] When I'm watching Rush, the annoying thing about it, there's just too much popping onto the screen,

[19:38] like every three seconds.

[19:40] Like every time you hit anything, it goes to a different screen.

[19:43] Ball save, I got an owl here.

[19:45] I'm looking at a golf course. I'm looking at a car. I'm looking at dice rolling.

[19:48] I'm looking at this. I'm looking at that.

[19:50] Everything just keeps popping up all over the place.

[19:52] And I think it disrupts watching the concert footage.

[19:56] It just seems a little schizophrenic.

[19:58] And it's weird to do it like that, right?

[20:00] Why are you doing it like that?

[20:02] Because if you're playing the pinball machine and you're looking down at that fast action,

[20:06] you can't see all those things popping up on the screen.

[20:09] So when you're watching someone play Rush, it's not that enjoyable

[20:14] because you're seeing all that stuff break up, the band singing the song.

[20:18] And that's why Guns N' Roses is so geniusly coded, is even when you're watching someone play G&R,

[20:24] you feel like you're at a G&R concert and the code and the animations and the things popping up on the screen

[20:31] don't disrupt the concert footage.

[20:33] So do me a favor, go back and look at the Rush stream and tell me if you're watching someone play Rush,

[20:38] it's not enjoyable.

[20:39] And it's weird to me because the player can't enjoy any of those animations anyway

[20:43] because of how fast they go across the screen.

[20:46] I think it's a little bit of a jumbled mess.

[20:48] I really do. I think they need to simplify it a little bit.

[20:51] Like you can have a deep game that has a lot to accomplish, but it can be very easy to understand.

[20:56] And I think G&R does that pretty well.

[20:59] I'm not sure about Rush after watching the stream last night.

[21:02] You Rush fans have a great pinball machine.

[21:05] I'm super happy for all of you.

[21:07] You're not going to be able to find an Ellie if you don't have one

[21:10] because after the stream last night, more people are going to want one.

[21:13] So if you got a Rush Ellie congratulations, now there are a thousand of them out there.

[21:17] And a lot of these distributors now are sitting on them for $13,000, $14,000.

[21:21] They will open up for sale, but I'm happy for you.

[21:25] This is what I want.

[21:26] And this is the reason why I want dream themes that are done well

[21:29] because it will satiate you.

[21:31] And that's what we need more of in pinball.

[21:34] Every single theme should be done justice.

[21:37] And this is why I have a love hate with Stern.

[21:40] Because why did they make Rush so amazing and they messed up Star Wars

[21:45] and they messed up Ghostbusters and they messed up Mandalorian

[21:49] and they messed up Stranger Things.

[21:51] Stern is so inconsistent on how they handle dream themes.

[21:55] I mean, they messed up Star Wars.

[21:57] Now, why do I think so many people were hating on Jersey Jack pinball last night?

[22:02] I'm going to explain why.

[22:03] And I was saying it to my friend Robert Brooks last night, who's a huge Jersey Jack fanboy

[22:08] and so am I and so is my friend Derek.

[22:10] Jersey Jack has treated its customers last year like crap.

[22:14] They're so denying it.

[22:15] Like they launched a product and there were issues with so many people's GNRs

[22:20] and they told all of their customers to pound sand.

[22:23] So it's hard enough as a JJP fanboy to defend the very company you love,

[22:28] let alone the Stern army.

[22:30] And how can you blame Stern fans for taking shots at JJP?

[22:34] Every three to four months, Stern comes out with a new machine.

[22:38] The machine is usually high quality.

[22:40] They stand behind their product and they don't stop, right?

[22:43] They just keep going.

[22:45] Without Stern, pinball would be so boring.

[22:48] Now, Jersey Jack is needed in pinball.

[22:50] We need to keep elevating what's possible in a pinball machine.

[22:53] And Jersey Jack has forced Stern to get better in every single way.

[22:58] And that's great.

[22:59] But Jersey Jack also just gives their fans headaches.

[23:02] Nobody wants to wait two years for the next game.

[23:05] Nobody wants to have play field issues.

[23:07] Nobody wants to have spotlights breaking.

[23:09] Nobody wants to be treated the way JJP has treated people over the last year.

[23:15] And I think that's the hardest part, right?

[23:17] Is I love guns and roses as a pinball machine.

[23:20] But I've been very frustrated seeing me and all of my friends who've owned one

[23:25] having all of these issues and they still don't have a solution.

[23:30] They still have not been taken care of.

[23:32] And I think JJP just struggles in the goodwill department.

[23:35] Like it's really hard to go to bat for them after everything they've put their customers through.

[23:40] And it's in their court, right?

[23:42] It's in their power to turn the tide.

[23:45] But they haven't.

[23:46] And they haven't told us they've solved any of these issues.

[23:49] And that is why if you're buying Rush Pinball, you don't have to worry about play field issues.

[23:54] You're just going to get your game and enjoy it.

[23:56] And if you have an issue, Stern will help you out.

[23:59] I can't say the same thing for Jersey Jack owners.

[24:01] And I'm really nervous about their next title on whether or not there are going to be issues.

[24:05] Because history has shown us there are always issues with a JJP launch.

[24:10] Now, can we all just please get along?

[24:12] If you love guns and roses, great.

[24:14] If you love Rush, great.

[24:16] I love that both of these machines exist.

[24:18] I want every single theme that is in pinball form to satiate the fans of that theme.

[24:24] Both of these games do that.

[24:26] My condolences to everyone who owns a Led Zeppelin.

[24:29] You have nothing special in your possession.

[24:32] I don't care what you say.

[24:34] Led Zeppelin was not made with passion.

[24:36] It wasn't.

[24:37] Guns and roses and Rush, they were made with passion.

[24:41] And games made with passion, you can tell.

[24:44] You can feel it.

[24:45] It comes through the entire package.

[24:47] And I want to congratulate everyone for getting a Rush Pinball machine if you ordered one.

[24:52] And I want to congratulate the team at Stern for making this game.

[24:55] You know how to make people happy.

[24:57] Do I think these games are worth the prices?

[24:59] No, they're not.

[25:00] We all know that.

[25:01] These are not worth the prices.

[25:02] Stern is completely fleecing all of us.

[25:05] But nothing I say is going to change that.

[25:07] And if it makes you happy, we only live once.

[25:10] So don't listen to me.

[25:12] Buy what makes you happy because guess what people?

[25:14] We're all going to die.

[25:16] Have a great day.

[25:17] Canada out.

[25:18] It makes you happy.

[25:22] That should be your out.

[25:23] I'm going to leave that in there.

[25:25] We interrupt the end of this Canada Spinball podcast for two things.

[25:28] First, I want to give a shout out to MJK Plumbing, Mr. Michael Kastner for being a club member.

[25:35] And we are at 354 club members.

[25:38] Take us away, Axl Rose.
