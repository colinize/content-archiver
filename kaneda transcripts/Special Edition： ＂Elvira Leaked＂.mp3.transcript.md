[00:00] Well, in celebration of a viral leak in early, let's leak a little guns and roses you've

[00:07] never heard before on Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:30] Gotta love acts of holding on to these songs for 20 years.

[00:37] Let's get at the show.

[00:38] This is a special edition of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:41] Let's get it started right now.

[00:42] Let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's sing, let's

[00:48] sing.

[00:49] Doesn't it feel like Jurassic Park just got released and revealed to us like yesterday

[00:55] and now you wake up on a random Saturday and all of a sudden we see the next Stern Game

[01:01] in living color out there in the world being shared around the inner webs.

[01:07] And let me just first state right off the bat that this was not a designed leak by Stern

[01:13] Pimbald.

[01:14] You want to know what happened and this person admitted to it on Pinside is somebody figured

[01:20] out Stern's website.

[01:23] And they sort of they didn't hack it but what they did was they determined what a URL

[01:29] would be to a site that wasn't yet put live and they figured out what the Elvira URL

[01:36] would be and they got the images that way and then they shared those images.

[01:40] So that is how it happened.

[01:41] So do not for a minute think that Stern wanted these images out there.

[01:46] Now that being said, am I not going to talk about it and I'm not going to share it myself

[01:50] on my Facebook page.

[01:52] Of course I am.

[01:53] If you haven't seen the images there they're floating through Pinside they are on

[01:57] Canada's Pimbal podcast Facebook page and we have two images.

[02:01] I haven't seen the play field image which I think is also floating around but we have

[02:05] what I believe to be the premium and the Ellie versions of the game.

[02:10] And if rumor is correct we are also going to get the super limited edition version of

[02:16] Elvira which will be sold through Elvira's fan page.

[02:20] Now I'm not sure how many of those there will be or how much they will be and what the

[02:26] super limited edition features will be on the game.

[02:29] Okay.

[02:30] So what is there to talk about?

[02:31] First and foremost not much right.

[02:33] The game looks cool.

[02:35] The game does look like as described to me a few months ago that there is a big haunted

[02:40] mansion in the back of the game.

[02:42] It's like a haunted house.

[02:43] I believe that's the name of the title of virus haunted house.

[02:47] It definitely looks very cool.

[02:50] It kind of you know when I saw it I was like wow.

[02:53] It's very similar in sort of theme and sort of world under glass and it's like as as

[02:58] monsters and if you're a fan of the Elvira franchise I think this game designed by Dennis

[03:05] Nordman is going to fit the bill for you because it is going to stay true to the scared

[03:12] stiff and Elvira franchise that a lot of you guys have loved out there.

[03:16] Now I have to admit I am not like the hugest Elvira fan but I definitely understand her

[03:23] appeal and it comes at an interesting time in the Pimbal hobby in which the hobby itself

[03:30] is trying to be as politically correct as it possibly can and attractive female figures

[03:37] on Pimbal machines have come under attack and if if what we're seeing in these images

[03:43] is correct there is going to be a lot of how do I want to say this you know barely

[03:51] clad Elvira you know she sells her sex she sells her sex you know her sex appeal that

[03:57] is her stick you you would never expect to see an Elvira game without their curvaceous

[04:03] and voluptuous Elvira right and every little boy who sees Elvira immediately starts to

[04:09] walk towards her with hands held up right now I mean not it right it's even hard to talk

[04:14] about this stuff because I can just see well not every boy does that but anyway you know

[04:18] what I mean and you're going to get Elvira on this game I have to say just from what I've

[04:23] seen and I have not seen HD artwork of it so far I like the Ellie art package the premium

[04:31] it really does I don't like it I don't like it it just has like the title of the game we

[04:38] saw this with Willy Wonka on the standard edition of the game I think it needed better art and

[04:43] even when I see the art that's on the game again I think they're trying to recreate the art

[04:48] from the old Elvira games and if they're trying to go for that they've succeeded the problem right

[04:53] now is this is we've seen how amazing Christopher Franchise artwork is also his artwork on Elvira

[05:01] because if if you follow him on Facebook he has shared some of his Elvira drawings and they are

[05:08] incredible they blow this away I again I just think Franchise got the best art style for pinball

[05:15] and I really hope Stern gets him on some new titles because I know they've been back and forth with

[05:20] him and and I know he's outspoken but part of me is like well whatever I'd be willing to deal with

[05:26] all that because we know when he makes a game it's going to be the kind of art package that's

[05:32] going to stand the test of time on pinball machines and it's perfect for pinball machines especially

[05:38] the kinds of pinball assets these companies have you know have to work with he's able to enhance them

[05:45] when he does his drawings and his illustrations over those assets okay and I don't think anyone

[05:50] would disagree with that but that being said what what is in this game that has this excited I

[05:56] don't know I hate to early it's very early for me we're gonna obviously be talking a lot about

[06:02] this game in the next few weeks here's why because the reveal of this game will happen most likely

[06:08] next week and that's why these images were put up on the Stern website they were getting ready

[06:14] to be shared out in the right way and I feel bad because I know Stern had plans to have this

[06:20] game released exclusively with somebody and now this has spoiled that now it hasn't ruined it

[06:27] because remember the only people sharing this stuff are maybe some pinball groups on Facebook

[06:34] and maybe people on pinside but the rest of the world out there right Elvira has millions of fans

[06:39] around the world they are not aware of these images they probably will not stumble upon these images

[06:46] so all can be salvaged in the exclusive reveal of this game it this always happens to Stern

[06:54] though it's crazy right these games we always see them for the first time in low res even when

[07:00] they send the games out or the distributors get introduced the games for the first time right people

[07:05] are taking cell phone picks or their computer and that's the first time we see the game I just wish

[07:10] somehow some way the first time we saw a game could just be high resolution and we got every single

[07:18] thing we wanted and we got video of gameplay all at once I know that's wishful thinking we

[07:24] probably will never get that now what do we know about this game so far we know that Dennis Nordman

[07:30] designed the game we know that when interviewed or someone talked to him he basically said almost

[07:36] everything he designed to be in this game is in the game there was one mechanism Stern had to

[07:42] remove because of consistency and quality now here's what the person who saw the play field

[07:47] describes there are two fast ramps two flippers there are a monsters monster monsters on sticks that

[07:57] jump when you hit standups a giant Alice Cooper style haunted house sculpt that might play like

[08:04] medieval madness so it has one spooky basement lock entrance protected by a standup one ramp

[08:13] up into it and a ramp that raises allowing you to enter the seller of the haunted house it has a

[08:20] tri-state crypt that kind of reminds him of no good gofer mech a junk in the trunk physical coffin

[08:27] lock that it jacks balls left to right across the play field a tall vertical up kick that flings balls

[08:35] right to left across the play field the art blades on the le are gorgeous he says and the premium

[08:42] looks naked without them all right so that is what we know about the game so far we know that

[08:47] Dennis Norman designed it lineman sheets is on this game which has people excited here's the big

[08:54] news though here's the very big news and i hope you're sitting down this is not and i repeat

[09:01] not the next corner stone game from Stern pinball the next corner stone game from Stern pinball

[09:11] is supposedly going to be revealed to us by December and it also is a title that nobody has really

[09:19] guessed i think it might have been in maybe some of our long lists of things that might happen

[09:25] but this is exciting because it's amazing how quickly and the cadence at which Stern pinball

[09:34] can constantly be putting pinball machines out into the world i mean one might say they are

[09:40] flooding the market with games because they know that this won't last very long that the pinball

[09:47] economy is going to collapse and they are going to make as much bank as they can in the next few

[09:54] years and and that's that you might be an optimist and say no way Chris you're wrong absolutely not

[10:00] like this is nothing's going to slow down people buying these machines and you know when i saw

[10:05] this game and i saw like wow awesome again i mean it when i say this i i felt like i was just

[10:11] served Jurassic Park and now we are served up Elvira so quickly it sometimes feels like you're at

[10:19] your favorite restaurant right and you order like a flaminion and you can't wait to have a flaminion

[10:26] and they put one down and you're all excited you're you're like eight bites into it and then all

[10:31] of a sudden the waiter brings out another flaminion and you're like all right i don't know if i can

[10:37] get through the first one and then another one comes out that's a little bit how i feel lately

[10:43] about the surplus of pinball machines that are coming out non-stop it's exciting i'll tell you

[10:50] who should be most excited the casual pinball player is the ultimate winner if you out there

[10:56] who has no desire to buy new in box games this is your like candy land i mean this is amazing you

[11:02] get to wake up every few months and there's a new game i'll tell you who i wouldn't want to be

[11:07] american pinball i wouldn't want to be uh you know let's see chicago gaming company i wouldn't

[11:14] want to be anyone competing with stern and trying to sell games at volume you know jersey jack it's

[11:20] like they want us to be focused on on willy wanka and jack he does jack puts more into his games there's

[11:27] no doubt about it jack is making a premium product but it's hard to see how he can steal market share

[11:34] away from a company that just has this level of cadence right and stern games are getting better

[11:41] and better and better like they are and and i know we haven't talked about the clear code issue

[11:45] and how can people be running into these games until they've told us they've solved that and yes

[11:50] that is going to be a question on everyone's mind but we've done the due diligence we've made sure

[11:56] that now one of the first questions everybody's going to ask their distributor is has that problem

[12:03] been solved before you take my money for these games now that being said if al-vira sly gets

[12:08] announced this week and they're like there's only 80 sly's of al-avira do they sell out immediately

[12:14] without people knowing the clear code issue has been solved absolutely i think people with stern

[12:20] will have enough confidence that they'll fix the problem before these new games are made i i think

[12:24] that is where we're at in the hobby if jersey jacks collect your editions of willy walk a come out

[12:30] next week will people be as confident that they fixed a problem i don't know you know it's it's

[12:36] it's going to be an interesting couple of months to see how these companies how they communicate

[12:43] and how they convince us that that problem is solved okay but back to the whole point of tons of

[12:49] games tons of games based on themes that you may or may not love now if you would ask me i still

[12:56] think these themes are niche like al-vira's niche a monster is niche a Jurassic Park not so niche but

[13:04] making it not based on the movie definitely puts it into a smaller audience right i don't think

[13:09] you know how many of you out there are running to like collect Jurassic Park stuff and stuff that's

[13:14] outside of the films themselves i i still think it's a little bit of a smaller universe so what i'm

[13:21] hoping is you know first i always hope these games are great i'm also hope and it's lime and sheathe

[13:26] so it's going to be great we know that i'm just curious what the next cornerstone is but here's the

[13:31] disease people here's here's where i'm infected and you're infected and we're all we're all caring

[13:37] this pinball bug disease here's the disease i'm not even i'm now already skipping over al-vira to

[13:44] wonder what the cornerstone game is that is supposed to be amazing that no one's guest right it's

[13:50] September um we just got Jurassic Park in like august and i'm already jumping over the October

[13:59] release game to see what the December release cornerstone will be it is it's it's so hard to keep

[14:06] doing these mental gymnastics but here's where it gets really easy if you just stop thinking you

[14:12] need to own all these games then it's fun sit back grab some popcorn check your you know check

[14:19] your check in account and watch it grow instead of you know diminish as you keep buying game after

[14:25] game we no longer we no longer and i don't care you have to be really really rich now to want to

[14:33] own these games without losing money we no longer can afford the space and the money most of

[14:39] you out there to experience these games in your home and we're seeing it across the board there is

[14:45] a softening of secondhand sale happening in pinball and this is why this is why i mean doesn't it feel

[14:52] like willy-waka came out like two years ago doesn't it feel like Jurassic Park was like a year ago

[14:57] and like people haven't even people haven't even received their Jurassic Park at least yet and we're

[15:02] already like debating monsters Ellie we we are like drug addicts onto the next fix and we constantly

[15:10] need it now the thing we don't do is once a game comes out it's it's rarely talked about and this

[15:16] is again this is a lot is it just pinside a lot of it's the podcast you know but you know game is

[15:21] stream so many times in the first month that you just get sick of seeing it it is true when you

[15:27] think about it when a new game comes out and it's just like stream stream stream stream stream of it

[15:32] it's how can you blame us from egg-ending fatigued by it sick of it and then wanting the next right

[15:38] it's like watching the same movie over and over and over it's like what's that scene in Peewee it's like

[15:43] again and again and again you know when they're like when they're going over the evidence right in

[15:48] the in the basement anyway it's it's exciting for guys who just want to play pinball it's got to be

[15:55] a little bit nerve-wracking for those of you who want to collect pinball machines and buy them

[16:00] all new in box and put them in your home i think we're right now though and this is why i'm excited

[16:05] i'm excited because there are so many games and all these games for the most part will get made

[16:11] all these games will be available to me should i want one but i'm also excited because i can now wait

[16:17] until a game is fully finished before i make up my mind and i can go get it and nothing is really

[16:23] hard to get anymore nothing not even like the big olibouski if you really want one yeah you might

[16:27] have to pay more but you can still just get it i learned this lesson with magic girls like

[16:32] if you think there's a game out there that you're gonna have to buy because it will never become

[16:36] available to you it you think again everything will be available even even supreme pinball right

[16:42] and so and so it's it's a great time to sort of witness this like we are we are in the new

[16:49] golden age of pinball like there's more pinball machines and companies right now then there was in

[16:54] the nineties there's more games coming out it feels like then even back then and and and unlike

[17:01] then these games aren't abused in our cades they are in people's homes and they become available

[17:08] in almost mint pristine condition so that that's that's what excites me but i also and just like

[17:15] i also feel like all of us here's the problem because we are so addicted to the next thing i think

[17:22] most of us are having it a hard time appreciating savoring and just being happy with what we have

[17:30] right and if you look at go beyond pinball just keys to happiness in life and in zen philosophy

[17:36] sometimes approaching life in a way where you look at everything you have and say i don't need

[17:42] anymore i'm content with what i have now the problem is like in pinball like we're the we're the

[17:49] us pinball fanatics are the complete opposite it's it's always i can't wait to see what's next i

[17:54] can't wait to see if i want to buy the next game the next game is going to be better than the game

[17:58] i have there's this constant sort of pursuit of pinball magic perfection uh that ultimately if we

[18:05] get on that train we're we're all left we're all let down right we're left sort of feeling unfulfilled

[18:14] because we're chasing after some sort of dream pin in our head that just will never be made

[18:20] and i just wish we had more time to savor these games i do i do i i i mean that i think great games

[18:25] now sometimes come out and i said that with deadpool is we just nothing has time nothing is in

[18:32] theaters long enough i think that's a good metaphor nothing is in theaters long enough to actually

[18:39] you know get discussed and be seen by enough and played by enough and enjoyed by enough over time

[18:46] to be considered a great game anymore it's everything's just i want to the next get it in get it out

[18:51] get it in get it out that's the way it is right now i remember when shashank redemption

[18:55] was first in theaters nobody went to see it and then all of a sudden the academy recognized it

[19:02] and all of a sudden it became a classic so you know the the the path way to becoming a

[19:08] classic pinball machine you know something that holds up year after year after year it's it's it's

[19:14] hard right what would you consider to be them the in the last five years games that are just great

[19:20] that universally were like this is awesome not even to talk about that because this is a special

[19:24] addition of canada's pinball podcasts it's not in episode right so you don't get all of canada

[19:29] on today's show so where's deep root all right we talked about them they're not showing much

[19:36] this year they're waiting i think it's a mistake and i'll tell you why i think this clear code issue

[19:42] what was was a great opportunity for robert to swoop in and a lot of the money was was waiting to see

[19:50] the manufacturers response to this issue and what a great time it would have been to just show

[19:56] that you're not going to have any of those issues because here's how you're making your game at least

[20:01] so maybe that's what we see in houston uh if you ask me if you if you were to ask me my guess is i

[20:07] think they'll show their cabinet design where i think the playfield pops out and turns around on a

[20:12] rotisserie i think you're going to see sort of like that like the skeleton platform of deep

[20:18] root games and what they'll be in but i don't think we're going to see too much more i could be wrong

[20:22] i don't know i don't i don't know any specifics this is all speculation all right american pinball

[20:28] i i don't i don't i don't know how they're gonna i don't know i don't know they need a killer title

[20:33] they need a killer title you know even spooky you know if scattenese is making something haunted house

[20:39] theme and this game hits right one spooky might be ready to show something on that will that

[20:45] cause them to change direction you know how much you know it's crazy to you because spooky pinball

[20:50] if there's one company that should be making elvira it's spooky pinball uh but stern grabbed it and

[20:56] you have to you have to on some level think that stern took some of these spooky themed games

[21:04] away from chuck and secured them simply because they know that that that competitively gives them an

[21:12] advantage to spooky pinball and maybe some of these moves were were stern getting back at them

[21:18] because stern sort of uh wanted tna but didn't get it and chuck got it maybe some of that is left

[21:24] over from from from that deal gone bad for stern uh but who knows who knows that it is interesting

[21:30] and you look we all know that stern taking godzilla away from spooky was a real jerk move no way

[21:38] around it stern stern doesn't want godzilla toho godzilla they know that this one at charlie's dream

[21:44] themes and when you're stealing it's not stealing but like they basically went in and got something

[21:49] that they didn't really need and it would have been charlie's dream theme to make that sucks too right

[21:54] this sucks like do they really need to do that do they need to put their their thumb down and

[22:00] their heel down on chuck uh this tiny little boutique uh you know i don't know that doesn't seem

[22:06] like the right move to make but again as i've always said there are no friends in this in this

[22:11] pinball world as much as everyone likes to be like it's everything's good for the hobby you know

[22:15] we're expanding pinball we we should be in this together that's total BS welcome to the real

[22:21] world of business people you think marioid and hilton like want to help each other out and delta

[22:27] and american airlines nope they would love to see the competitor go under it means more money to them

[22:32] anyway so more to come this week can't believe it happened in september in the i i thought we would

[22:39] at least have to wait till like next month i don't know how our brains can process so many games and

[22:46] then on top of this add in deep root on top of this add in kingpin on top of this add in puni

[22:52] what is that puni puni pinball crap on top of this add in cosmic carnival on top of this you know

[22:58] those guys want to make another pinball machine on top of this right cactus canyon remake it's just

[23:04] it's insane it's insane i can't i can't my head spinning i'm gonna go to gym right now i encourage

[23:10] you guys to work out more than you play pinball we're gonna go to i think a leg exercise today i

[23:17] never like leg day but you have to you have to you don't want to walk around life looking like

[23:22] donkey con with like huge upper body and like skinny legs you look stupid right everybody more

[23:27] episodes to come as more of alvira is revealed and let's end this podcast with a little new guns

[23:35] and roses that leaked right it's the week of leaking stuff uh this song is called perhaps you

[23:41] heard at the beginning and you'll hear it at the end have a great day everybody

[24:05] you
