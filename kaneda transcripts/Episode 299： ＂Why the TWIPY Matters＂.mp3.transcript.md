[00:00] Please don't run, if I'm the type of hero now makes me stand inside the strong boy now.

[00:15] Everybody, welcome to this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast that I'm going to call

[00:21] Why the Twippies Matter, okay?

[00:24] But before I go into this episode, I want to talk a little bit about

[00:28] something I just bought for all of you out there. That's right. Everyone who listens to this podcast is going to be the recipient of a gift from

[00:37] Canada. And you know what that is? It's a better microphone. So hopefully you will notice an audio difference on this

[00:45] episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast. I used to do this show with a $19 USB headset microphone. And I went out and I said,

[00:54] you guys deserve a better sounding pinball podcast. So hopefully you are enjoying the audio on this show. And please email me at

[01:04] canada pinball at gmail.com and let me know if it sounds much, much better. I think it will. I think it will. Okay. So why am I calling this

[01:13] episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast? Why the Twippies Matter? I want to explain why because every year you guys out there,

[01:23] the community of people who love pinball, who follow pinball, who collect pinball, you get to have your collective voices heard in the pinball hobby.

[01:34] And what started out last year as the first ever annual Twippies award is actually going to be a live event production. Well,

[01:44] we don't know how much of a production it will be. But at the Texas pinball festival, you know, March, like 22nd to the 24th,

[01:52] Greg and Zach are going to do a live show in which they announce the winners of the Twippies. Okay. And for those of you who have been living under a rock,

[02:02] we know what the Twippies are. It's this week in pinball. It's their annual award. And so I just want to go on the record for saying,

[02:10] I do think the Twippies matter. And here's why because I think there are a lot of hardworking people in the pinball hobby.

[02:18] And they deserve to be recognized. Everyone from designers, decoders to artists, to all the manufacturers that are out there,

[02:27] you know, the awards mean a lot to people. And the recognition means a lot to people. I know it means a lot to people like Scott Denise.

[02:34] I know it means a lot to people like Christopher Franci. They really love knowing that the people out there are really congratulatory of their work.

[02:45] Okay. And so I was reading on pinside about pinball podcasts. And here, look, I'm going to come out and just say it. I do think that the Twippies are important.

[02:57] And they are important to me and this show. I spend a lot of time doing this show. I'm not going to lie. I spend a lot of time putting on a microphone and talking to you about pinball.

[03:08] And winning a Twippy matters to me. It does mean a lot that we get recognized as being the best pinball podcast because I do a pinball podcast for two reasons.

[03:19] I do it to give all of you out there entertainment in the pinball world. I know that when you're done reading the forums, when you're done, you know, speculating about all the new games coming out,

[03:32] you do love to put on pinball podcasts when on your way to work, when you're mowing the lawn, when you're just like wanting to think about pinball at different points in the day.

[03:42] I do it to entertain you, but I also do it to make the best possible pinball podcast I can. And there is a strive within me to make this show as good as I possibly can.

[03:53] Hence the reason why I just bought this new microphone. So it sounds even better.

[03:58] And I've always been very congratulatory of the other pinball podcasts that are out there. I think Ryan and Marty deal a great show. I think Nate Shivers does a great show.

[04:07] I think the slam-tilt show is great. There are so many great pinball podcasts out there. You've got Mrs. Pin. You know, you've got Brody, we even talk pinball. You've got the Buffalo. You've got even this weekend pinball has their own pinball podcast.

[04:23] There are like 30 pinball podcasts that are out there. And I've missed like 25, even just mentioning them right now. There is something for everybody.

[04:34] And I've always, I've always welcomed more and more people to put on the microphone and do your show. Do the show the way you want to do the show.

[04:44] It is unfortunate to me that that head to head won't even mention that there is a Canadian pinball podcast. And I was just reading on pinside because one of it seems like one of my fans was on the head to head thread.

[04:58] And he basically said, I want to read what he said. He said, good day, mates. Just listen to the latest episode. Marty's 2018 show recap, wall impressive, smacked of obvious, trippy campaigning as pointed out by none the less than Ryan see himself.

[05:16] Head to head does a great job. And as such is one of my go to pinball podcasts. However, until you guys get off your high horse and acknowledge Canadian's podcast, as well as any of numerous compliments sent to you via pinside, my trippy vote will continue to go to Chris for podcast of the year.

[05:37] All right. Then Ryan Chimes in and Ryan says, please vote for whoever you want as the award means nothing to me. What does podcast of the year mean anyway?

[05:51] The twippies are an internet popularity contest that is no bearing on quality and happiness of the hobby to me.

[06:02] Enjoy whatever podcast you want my friend, but please don't tell me to do something for you for a vote I could not care less about.

[06:12] Okay. So right there, Ryan could care less about a twippy vote. And I'm here to tell you on this episode with my new microphone that the twippies do mean a lot.

[06:23] And I do care about every vote I get. And I think everyone out there in the pinball world does care about it because I think statements like that undermine your vote and your opinion. It's not a popularity contest.

[06:37] Is it when you're asking like, what's the best game designer of the year? What's the best artwork in pinball? What's the best layout? What's the best toy? What's the best mechanism?

[06:48] Is it a popularity contest or are we just asking people in a democratic way collectively? Which one do you think is the best? And it in a democracy whoever gets the most votes wins.

[07:03] Is that fair? I think that matters. I don't know. It doesn't matter to them. So maybe you know, if they don't care, I'll happily take the twippy votes. But look, I literally, I hope that all of you do vote for this show.

[07:17] So if you do enjoy this show and that's all I'm going to say about it. And let's turn a page and let's talk about the monster's pinball because I've been traveling for work and I've been trying as hard as I can to look at the streams of the monster's game.

[07:32] And we saw it stream on Thursday. I know Dwight went over the rules and I watched and I watched and I watched and I watched and I thought it was really great.

[07:41] I thought it was really great that Dwight gave people a walkthrough of how the game will work. And if you have been on the fence about this game, I think videos like that really, really help.

[07:53] And I know there's a lot of people when it comes to Dwight coding a game if we're to be honest or nervous. And we saw a thread that said, you know, how well is Dwight's track record at finishing games?

[08:07] And just to recap, the games that Dwight has started coding, you know, since the last few years at Stern, I say started coding because you know, a lot of people will say these games have never quite been finished and have never been polished to the point people would have liked.

[08:25] So Dwight has been on Game of Thrones, Ghostbusters, Star Wars and now Monsters. Okay. Now I think Game of Thrones people are still wishing there would be more polishing the game.

[08:39] But I would also say Game of Thrones is a game that kind of has gone into a black hole of relevance. Nobody really cares.

[08:48] I don't hear this game talked about, I don't hear this game discussed, I don't hear people wanting to buy it. Game of Thrones will go down as a very, very B level game.

[09:01] And it's not, I won't even say it's because of Dwight. Game of Thrones just missed the mark. I mean, I think we need to remember something. Game of Thrones is the most popular entertainment franchise in the world right now.

[09:16] More popular than Star Wars. Don't fool yourself. Do you know, here's a few facts because I'm working on a Game of Thrones marketing campaign right now.

[09:24] Game of Thrones is the most pirated piece of content in the history of the internet. All right. That means more people are trying to steal the shows than any other show in the history of shows.

[09:35] Game of Thrones has the most Emmy awards, Emmy awards of any show of all time. Okay. And this will be the final year of the show.

[09:43] Now look, the game itself, I think while having Steve Richie's nice flow was completely lacking in bringing that game of Thrones world to life.

[09:52] And we all know the artwork was terrible and all that stuff. Okay. But the game is still, I think for most people not completely coded to where it feels finished.

[10:01] Ghostbusters, I don't, we all know the Ghostbusters coding story. People think that Ghostbusters needs to be revisited code wise.

[10:11] Now we know that Dwight considers that game to be pretty much complete and done. Star Wars. You know, once again Dwight and Steve Richie, Star Wars again.

[10:21] Another ginormous miss when it comes to theme integration and getting that game to, you know, to bring the Star Wars world we all love to life.

[10:31] Now from a code standpoint, I don't really feel like people are clamoring for more Star Wars code. It is also probably one of the, I think the most confusing and complex codes I've ever seen in a pinball game.

[10:45] And I know that Dwight has, has listened to Rare Hero calling it like, it's like math class trying to figure that game out. It's like, like chess. It's like code chess.

[10:57] You can't really figure out what is going on in that game in a simple way. And how bad is that? When you think about it, right? A coder is basically using software to walk you through the storyline of the game and to, and to have you progress through the storyline of the game.

[11:15] And when I play Star Wars and all the stacking and all the multipliers, it's so stupid that they took that approach or Dwight took that approach because it's such an easy story to tell because the movies tell it perfectly.

[11:29] And yet here I am like combining scenes from different films and it makes no sense. All right? And again, Star Wars, another game.

[11:38] It just doesn't feel like a game. People are, are considering to be, you know, one of the better games. And I think we're at that point now, right?

[11:46] Where people are starting to look at the stern machines over the last five years or so and saying, well, which one of these machines are the best?

[11:53] Which ones are worth owning? And which one should I never let go? So Dwight's track record of completing games, it's not great.

[12:02] I think he's different than Lyman Sheets. And I think people realize this. And, and, and what I mean by that is I think Lyman is sort of like a poet.

[12:12] He's sort of like a guy who's building a cathedral when he makes a game. So if you know the story of a cathedral building, they're never done because a cathedral is supposed to be built all the way up to the heavens.

[12:26] So technically, no cathedral on planet Earth is finished being constructed because they haven't quite reached the heavens. And I think Lyman Sheets looks at his games like that.

[12:35] He gets them complete enough, but he's always polishing. He's always thinking about ways to improve them. And for those of you who have owned a Lyman Sheets game, you've witnessed him even years after the fact.

[12:48] Go back to those games and do new things that get you reinvested in the game and just make the game even more special. I mean, we've seen him recently revisit Metallica.

[12:57] I mean, how many years did people think Metallica was done? Batman is finally at 1.02 code, but we all know that he's not done. He will find new things to improve in the game.

[13:12] Whereas Dwight, I think, has the approach of, I'd go to this game and I'm done with it. This is this game's finished. I'm on to the next. I don't think he has that desire to bring the game to total magical level of fruition.

[13:30] Now, here we are with monsters and I have to say the monsters launched by Stern was phenomenal. They gave you everything you probably have wanted in the game.

[13:41] Whether or not the theme is the theme that you've been clamoring for or not, that's besides the point. I think it was a really good launch. I think the game is packed with a lot of fun stuff.

[13:50] I think it looks great. It looks like it shoots great. It looks like there's enough in the code right now. I mean, this is not going to be a game where Stern launches it and you're going to be embarrassed to buy it and open it up and play it.

[14:03] We don't know if Dwight will finish the game in a way that is satisfactory to you. That's the thing that you're just going to have to figure out.

[14:14] It's also the reason why we're really at a point where people need to play these games before they commit. And as cool as monsters looks, I want to tell you, you know, after like the hype died down and I was traveling for work. I kind of want to tell you what was going on in my head.

[14:30] We all witnessed the great launch. We all saw the beautiful game. We all saw the lower play field. We all talked about the black and white. We all probably got nauseous listening to everyone complain about is this game just recycling two ramps, three pop bumpers and two orbits. I hate when people bitch about stuff like that. It's a pinball machine.

[14:52] Next thing people are going to bitch about Stern not being originally because they put the game in a fucking box and there's four fucking legs. What else can people bitch about on the inside when it comes to the layout of these games. There is only a finite amount of real estate in which you can design a pinball machine. Do you really want them to just throw all of the fan layout stuff that people love that works.

[15:17] Do you want them just to go all original? You know what that's called? Rob Zombie. You know what that's called? America's most haunted. You know, come on. Look it. Look it like Chuck when he just throws out all the fan stuff people love games clunky games this games that. So you know, look, you're never going to get Stern to design a game that that that like completely throws out what they know works in pinball.

[15:41] So we all went through all that we listened to all of it. So here's where I started to sort of net out. I started to think about like, well, what's the main discussion been about in the game. And the first week when Stern launches a new game, you know what the like the primary discussion is. It's all about the trim levels of the game. Right. What what is the pro? What is the premium and what is the early because in that first week there really is only one group of people.

[16:11] That needs to move fast and those are the Ellie buyers like these guys have to make up their mind because if they wait too long, they might miss out on a chance to get the Ellie version of the game. Now did you see what Stern did on this one.

[16:25] They launched 500 L.E.s and they got people to have to commit to 500 L.E.s and week one, but they did something that I think was kind of strange and not you know, little questionable.

[16:38] They added an additional 100 L.E. machines to the mix. So there are now going to be 600 monsters, Ellie. And I wonder if they did this to keep me from flipping a monster's L.E.

[16:53] Now I'm going to be fully transparent. You know me I talk about my my flipping days of pinball. I was going to try and flip some monsters pinball machines because I was you know, like many of you I was in on the hype.

[17:08] I was buying it. I thought this game was going to be you know, it's going to be super hot all the hype that I was getting from people who had seen it.

[17:14] You're going to be blown away. You know, board put more into this game than anything ever before. There's a lower play field. It's franchy artwork. What possibly you know, could go wrong and look nothing really did go wrong.

[17:26] But there is an art form to flipping pinball and there's also like a condition in which you can flip machines and you know, it's very basic. There needs to be more demand for the game than supply.

[17:39] But I've always noticed that if an Ellie does not completely sell out on day one, there really is no room to flip for money. Not anymore.

[17:51] We've moved past the days of that, right? So what happened was this. I had two Ellie's on hold and my deposit on those machines was as follows.

[18:03] I would lose my deposit, which means it was non-refundable if I did not commit to buying the games within 48 hours of Stern revealing the title.

[18:17] So Stern revealed the game on Tuesday. I had until Thursday at noonish to either commit or to get a refund.

[18:27] And so what I did was this. I basically said, well, let me see if Ellie's are sold out come Wednesday. And if they're not, I'm going to get out and let someone else have it at MSRP, right?

[18:39] Okay, it was super simple. So come Wednesday. There was one place I go to see whether or not people are going to pay more because this is where I would be selling my machine. Just go to eBay. And I saw on eBay, there were a bunch of monsters Ellie is available for sale at $8,999.

[18:56] So I might, you know what? I don't need to do this is not going to be flippable. I'll just let it go. So no, no harm, no foul. No harm, no foul. I didn't lose any money. Someone's getting two more spots opened up for people who want them at MSRP. They took them.

[19:10] There are still some monsters Ellie is available on eBay. There's some distributors that still have them there. They, they will not command more than MSRP. I don't think you're going to see monsters Ellie is flipping for like $10,000, $12,000.

[19:25] I also think we're getting to a point where maybe that behavior is coming to an end, but I also don't think so. And here, here's why I don't think the monsters has the same level of like I'm, you know, I got to buy it before I even see it.

[19:41] I also don't think the monsters as a theme and you could argue with me on this. I don't think the monsters as a theme is nearly as popular as a ghost busters as a star wars, you know, as a Batman.

[19:56] I don't, I don't think there's the same like, oh my god, I have to have it. If I'm going to be honest with you, I used to watch the monsters when I was a kid growing up, right?

[20:06] I have not really thought about the monsters in maybe 30 years. I've not watched the show in a long time. It's just not a property that I've been clamoring for now from, for those of you out there who love the show, I think you're really happy with this pin. I think you're super excited that Stern decided to give you a pretty knock out package with this game.

[20:30] But the discussion is always about the Trim and Week 1 and you know what we don't talk a lot about in Week 1 is how the game plays.

[20:38] Because still, if you think about it, 95% or more people who have committed to buying monsters Ellie, right? 95% of you, 95% of you who will get a monster's Ellie new inbox arrive at your door, 95% of you have never played the game.

[21:01] I mean, just think about that. You've never played it. All you can do is look at some videos. You don't know if you're really going to love it. You don't really know if it's going to blow you away.

[21:12] And that's why I think the Ellie market now for me is really all about, it just needs to be a theme that you have to have.

[21:21] Right? It's really hard to make up your mind and whether or not this is a game you're really going to love flipping.

[21:27] And so it's all about theme. It's all about theme and artwork. That's what drives the Ellie sales nowadays.

[21:36] And so that's why Stern is smart too. Think about it. They make the pros and then they make the Ellie's. They get the high ticket items out the door into people's homes.

[21:47] They don't give you too much time to think about it. But 600 the additional 100 being added. I do have an issue with.

[21:55] You know, I think that's sort of kind of bullshit. If Stern's going to come out, if Stern is going to come out and say there's only 500 and then distributors are saying, you know, you have to lock in your deposits or you lose them within 48 hours and then Stern adds an additional 100 machines to the mix.

[22:12] After the 48 hours were up for some people, I think it's bullshit. They should not be able to just arbitrarily play around with the limited edition numbers after they've announced how many there will be on reveal day because every single one of those 500 games will lose a little bit of value because now there's a whole nother 100 of them out there in the world.

[22:39] And I don't care what anyone says a lot of Ellie people they do care about the resale value of the game or how rare it is. It's just it's more fun to have a rare game if you're a collector.

[22:52] Does anyone disagree with that? It is more fun to have 80 super limited edition batman's than it would be to have 800. It's more fun to have 250 batman L.E.s and have one of 250 versus one of 500 or one or 600.

[23:08] So will we see Stern do this again in which they completely sort of just threw more in and took more money off the table? I don't like it. I think it's a little sleazy to do that after the fact.

[23:22] I think they should figure out the number beforehand. Right. Didn't they make like 600 guardians of the galaxy L.E.? What a mistake that was. Right.

[23:34] That a man for guardians L.E. was probably more like 300. So closing the loop on monsters. Let's just talk finally about the black and white the color and all that jazz. Do I think Stern's going to make a color premium? I hope not. I hope they don't do it. I really hope that they let this thing be the way it is.

[23:56] I do think it's an interesting Quagmire in dilemma. I wouldn't have done it personally myself. I don't think it makes sense to have the black and white be the premium. But it also makes an interesting. It makes it interesting because people now have decisions to make.

[24:11] And if you're a premium buyer, there's no rush. If I was a guy who's like, I'm going to get a premium. I really would wait to play it first.

[24:20] I would wait to see where the code is because they're going to make premiums for a few years and there's no rush to get it. Right.

[24:27] All right. So monsters. We should see it in a few weeks. I look forward to playing one on location. The great thing about being in New York City is we'll probably get one here real fast.

[24:37] So I saw someone on Pinside put up a thread that says, how much is my Batman super L.E. worth? I'm ready to sell it possibly. It's got like 100 plays. How much?

[24:48] I have a question I have for you guys out there. I'll give you my answer. But how much is it? It was, you know, $15,000 Batman S.L.E. where there's only 80.

[24:58] And the code is pretty much done. And the game still looks phenomenal. I mean, Stern has not gone back and given anyone that sort of metallic foil, cabinet artwork.

[25:10] It has an upgrade. It's speaker system, but it doesn't have much more than the premium of Batman. So you're really paying for the cosmetic package. That really is the only thing.

[25:19] You're paying for the cosmetic difference, the top and the limited nature. Here is what I think it's worth. And this is not me showing the game, ladies and gentlemen.

[25:29] There are only 80 S.L.E.s. I think a Batman super limited edition is worth no less than what it was new. I don't know what the ceiling is. I don't know what the ceiling is, but I don't think you will see anyone sell it super early for less than $15,000. I don't.

[25:50] Now, if you have one with a ton of mods that people want, if you have one that's got a play field protector, I think it's worth more than that. And I just describe my machine. I'm not chilling it. But mine is perfect from it. It has a play field protector from day one.

[26:07] Will I ever sell Batman super early? And the answer is yes, I will. And the reason why I'm saying yes, I will because I only have room for one machine. And so Batman stays, all right.

[26:18] Anything else going on in Stern, Beetles sales will Beetles sell all 1964 of the game. I don't know. I really don't know. I know we know Stern did one run of the game. I just don't know if the demand is there.

[26:35] Are people buying the golds at $8,000? I've also heard from people that Stern messed up the code on the game. With the latest code update, what is on the apron card does not match what you do in the game anymore. And people seem to be a little bit confused about what exactly the mission of this game is.

[26:58] Yeah, we know what the mission is. It's just meant to be in an art piece for Beetles lovers. There is no way I think people will get a lot of long term enjoyment out of such a simple game like that unless you're a Beetles fanatic.

[27:17] We beat it into the ground like a dead horse that you know the game is what it is. I think by now people realize the target audience of this game and it wasn't for operators. It was for collectors. I don't think they're going to make all of them. I don't. And I don't know if we'll ever know how many they fully made because they're each of them is not serial numbered.

[27:41] We know that the diamond and platinum are but the gold ones I don't believe the gold ones have like a number on them. I might be wrong. So if you know if I'm right or wrong, let me know. I wonder if you can hear me moving now with this new mic. It's kind of weird. I'm like, wow. I think it sounds better. I have no idea until I listen to this first episode. All right, let's talk about spooky pimple right now. Shall we? So I want to read something that Charlie wrote on Pinside which I think is interesting.

[28:10] So he writes this. He says code on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is finally where it's making us all happy here. What's interesting about that. Okay, so the code finally is making him happy. It is January mid January, right of 2019 and Chuck showed this game at Texas Pimball Festival in March of 2018.

[28:36] So almost 10, 11 months later, like 10 months later, he's finally happy with the code. And I hope Chuck learns a lesson on all this because Chuck, why would you show a game where you did not even have code that you were happy with 10 months early just to be at the show. It's at the point now. We're right. It would have made total sense to reveal Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle at T.P.F. of 2019. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that. But he goes on to say,

[29:05] I'm also to the point where daily duties allow me to actually jump in to help direct my own actual gameplay. Not to mention the team is bigger than it was one year ago and working well together. Yup, we drug our feet to get the Alice Cooper's Nightmare code caught up, fix some buggy Rob Zombie issues, added crucial talent to the team.

[29:33] Oh, yeah, built more games in 2018 than we ever had before about 520 total nuclear annihilations out the door, set it before we stepped up TNA production to get the plate clear and do nothing but Alice Cooper's.

[29:52] Okay, so they want to clear out all the TNAs so they can build Alice Cooper's. He then writes, we never expected TNA to go over a couple hundred units.

[30:03] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle sold a massive chunk fast, first and second best selling games back to back. Good problem, but still a problem.

[30:12] So let's do the math. We have 16 A's left to build and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is already taking over the production stands. 520 games done last year, it's January 10th and the only game currently on the production schedule for 2019 is Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[30:31] We promised to ship them all in 18 months or less, we will do just that. So I think what Chuck is saying there is there now at the point with where the team is at where spooky pinball can pretty much build 500 games a year.

[30:47] So even though they're delayed on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle within a year, we probably should see all of them manufactured.

[30:56] He then goes on to say going full HD and full RGB ain't cheap, but you stay on par with everyone else or fall behind fast.

[31:06] Considering we sold more games in 2018 with new system, then all the games in our first five years of existence combined, I'd say we made the right decision.

[31:16] We have never claimed to be perfect, but we'll never stop trying to get there. I think this year is going to be fairly freaking amazing to say the least. Peace and pinball people life is darn good.

[31:28] Alright Chuck, well look, first of all, we do have to congratulate spooky on making all those total nuclear annihilations.

[31:35] We also have to remind Chuck too that that was not a spooky game and the reason why people loved it is Scott Denise and acted out of the park.

[31:42] But you know what, they're all team spooky now, so we'll give him credit for that. Now look, I'm not in on an Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle and I look, I could stand in front of this mic and say the decision was stupid, why do it so early, it was a dumb decision.

[31:58] Charlie never should have revealed the game at TPS 2018, but I'm also here to tell you it doesn't matter who cares, right?

[32:05] The only people who should be upset are people who put deposits down and can't get out of those deposits. And I don't see a lot of people saying that.

[32:14] I think Chuck does have a loyal buyer base. I think he does have a loyal following. I don't see people whining and moaning.

[32:21] I think some people have tried to sell their spots and those people have been successful in selling their spots.

[32:27] I think when the damn breaks in the next few weeks, we're going to see a lot of Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle going out the door.

[32:34] And I think that's a good thing. And I can't wait to see people actually play the game in a home environment.

[32:39] My only, you know, I've said this before, I think the game's got great, great animations.

[32:44] I actually voted for those animations as the best in the Twippies this year.

[32:49] The only thing that's going to be interesting is how much is actually physical and how much is on the screen.

[32:54] So if you look at Monster Bash and you look at the monsters, a lot more physical stuff the ball is interacting with than on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[33:02] I think the thing is, it's like don't be fooled by that big castle. It's a huge castle, but there's not a lot of physical things to actually bash and hit compared to the competition.

[33:14] But again, I'm not going to ding Chuck for being successful. I think his next game, after Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle,

[33:25] I think it's going to be the pivotal game that they get super right because the competition is heating up and spooky.

[33:32] You know, 2019, he's already got the game sold. So if you're Chuck, you kind of can sleep at night because you don't have to find people to buy your Alice Cooper's because you already did.

[33:43] So was it smart? Was it not? We'll see. We'll see what happens in 2019. I can't imagine everyone in on Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle is going to want to stay after seeing the monsters, but time will tell if that happens or not.

[33:59] So speaking of monster theme games, where the fuck is monster bash Remake Ellie? Where is it? Does anyone have one? Is anyone on Box One? This game is so trickling out slowly.

[34:12] I feel like this game is coming out slower than they would have wanted to. This game was revealed at Expo, but man, it's been a slow, slow launch of the limited edition.

[34:25] I think they made a little bit of a weird decision, which was to make the serial numbered buyers games first. So if you had a serial number game on medieval madness Remake or attacked from Mars, they wanted to sort of give those people a chance to have a serial matching game.

[34:42] For the life of me, I'll never fucking understand why people care if their game number matches up.

[34:47] I got game number 69 of these three. Who gives a shit? Who really cares about the year the game is?

[34:59] Or not the year, like the number of the game. I know Christopher Franci got the monsters, number 64, the year the show came out.

[35:09] Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, nobody gives a shit, but it's cool. I guess, I guess I've never understood that. Like serial number matching pinball machine said nobody ever in the world of things we should care about.

[35:22] But look, monster bash Remake Ellie, if you're in on it, you're probably not super happy.

[35:28] Again, another game that like people just have been waiting and waiting and waiting for. I haven't seen too many complaints about the monster bash is that are out there.

[35:41] These remakes are interesting. People's excitement for them, it wanes. The games come out. They're great. New lighting, new display.

[35:49] But I almost feel like, you know, people are ready for the next remake like four to five months later. You know, they kind of want to see Chicago gaming do like a stern and like have two new titles a year, not just one every 18 months.

[36:01] And so will we see Chicago gaming get to that point? Speaking of new games, October fest. I'm going to tell you right now, here's the deal.

[36:08] If I win the trippies, I was thinking I could give you guys an option of things I could do. One of them, if I win the trippy awards, I will buy an October fest.

[36:20] You heard it here. You heard it. It's on the air. If canada wins the trippy for best pinball podcast, he's going to buy an October fest.

[36:27] I didn't say what I'll do with that October fest. I buy, but I'll buy one. You heard it here first. I will buy it. I will buy it from Joe Newhart at pinball star.

[36:37] Or Chris from coin taker. One of whoever has it, I'll buy it. And that's a guarantee. If they say the best pinball podcast of the year is canada's I'm buying an October fest.

[36:49] Okay. I'm also the second option you have. If I don't do that, the other option is I will buy Hilton a car. I'm not telling you which car you get cars for real cheap these days.

[36:59] You can get a car for cheaper than a pinball top for these days, but I will buy him a car. All right. Those are the deals you have if canada wins the best pinball podcast.

[37:07] So the only thing I want to say about October fest is where is it mid January. Again, another game revealed they're working on it.

[37:15] They're getting, we've seen what will be the final R package. And you've probably seen it by now too. They fixed a lot of what was wrong with the art.

[37:23] They got rid of pretzel lady. They got rid of like auto on the side. You can now read the full game title on the side.

[37:30] There's now a woman with big voluptuous breasts on the back glass. They finally listen to the creepy old man who want to see a CGIed woman with big bombs looking at them in a pinball game.

[37:48] Great, great. The monkey's been replaced I think by like a dog. Where is the game? How do these guys get people excited again for this game? How do you do it?

[38:03] How do you drum up another reveal for a game that's already been revealed for a game you've already been taking orders on?

[38:11] Or is American pinball gonna wise up real fast and they're gonna announce that they are making king pin.

[38:19] Are they gonna announce that they have another game they're gonna throw on the line that has strong demand. I just don't see demand coming back for this game.

[38:26] And I happily invite anyone from AP on to talk about why we should get excited about this game. Come on, not double, normal.

[38:34] Normal. That the floor is yours gentlemen explained to us why people should get excited. All right, we're going down the manufacturers. Let's stop next at deeproot.

[38:44] So deeproot pinball. I'm here to tell you a huge world exclusive on deeproot and that world exclusive is they remain silent.

[38:54] They still don't say much and I still think that's the right approach. I still think Robert's gonna bring stuff to T.P.F.

[39:04] I think they're going to shock everybody and bring stuff to T.P.F. They see Stern's hand. Stern's whole show is gonna be monsters.

[39:15] So can you know how awesome would it be and how awesome would it be knowing what your competition is like they know that Stern's cremdalogram is gonna be monsters at the show.

[39:26] How awesome would it be if deeproot came and just showed something more magical showed something in a game or showed a game that were the ball and the gameplay was just different.

[39:40] It had magical stuff in it. It had stuff that had never been done before. How awesome would that be and we have to be honest with ourselves when we say that the monsters looks awesome.

[39:52] The monsters has some stuff that hasn't been done before right that lower playfields got stuff going on in it that we haven't seen before but but I would say this.

[40:00] What does the ball do in the monsters the physical steel ball what is it do that's magical that's like wow did you see it do that does it have that I haven't played it yet so I can't say for sure the upside down ramp is really cool on the right.

[40:17] But we're still seeing like the same Stern magnet the same you know I don't know the same stuff there's nothing there's nothing that's like shit man I can't believe what the ball just did like that's so fucking cool like and look to be fair to Stern I haven't seen deeproot do it either so like don't get too concerned but like will deeproot do something that blows everyone away at tpf I think it'd be a missed opportunity.

[40:46] I'm hopefully I will have someone on from deeproot soon to this show because I want I want them to to tell us what is going on behind the scenes and get a little bit more of an insight from from all the hard work they're supposedly doing so I look forward to that.

[41:04] Now the other thing with deeproot and I saw this on pin sight if we have to talk about stuff that pops up on the form is the whole notion that this week in pinball

[41:14] will give someone a free deeproot machine if you know you enter to win a free deeproot machine if you donate to this week in pinball and that machine could be anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 dollars it says and also one of the deeproot designers Robert included will come to your home and set up the machine for you and this was this is on this week in pinball as part of the terms and conditions for donating to the site.

[41:43] And Robert chimed in and said you know I'm just trying to help Jeff out that's great Robert I would love why can't you give canada free pinball machine if canada wins the twippy someone who voted for him will get a free deeproot machine that's like it's kind of like Oprah win free these days you get a deeproot machine you get a deeproot machine.

[42:01] Here's the only problem with all this stuff there are no deeproot machines we don't know what they are is at the price point 5,000 to 10,000 like what machines like and haven't we heard this before from John Papadouk the whole notion of like we'll fly to your house and set the machine up for you is it are we are they really just trolling us with that offer or is that a real offer.

[42:25] And I don't know how I feel about donating to site enters you to win like I guess it's fine I mean I go back and forth in it because because this week in pinball is not it's not like a new site that takes an editorial slant like I am like I give you opinions I'm not I'm trying to be like as you know I'm trying not to like show favoritism for one or the other you know so it's like someone like no one sponsors this is like I'm not going to do it.

[42:55] I can be like fuck pin stadium because they don't sponsor my site even though I do think pin stadium is great you know I'm saying you know I used to listen to podcasts be like Nifty LEDs and it's be like like you know which pinball media people out there are really good friends with manufacturers or take money or sponsored by them.

[43:15] So you're probably not going to get this week in pinball to ever say something negative about deep route if deep route is given a machines because nobody is lobbying to be on canada's pinball podcast nobody gets special favors here right alright so what else is going on in pinball so.

[43:34] Anything at Chicago we talked about that we talked about p3 not the new or waiting to see what Jerry's doing with the new modular systems let me read some of your emails and then we'll call today and I want you guys to tell me this pinball podcast sound better because again the new mic we'll see how it sounds and I might be my batteries down we're on one rush here.

[43:55] Alright let's see I got an email from Ed Owens as Ed says Chris just a quick thought on a for sale ad quoting play counts some ads even show pictures of the audits before I got ghost busters I gave good weight on this information you yourself have berated people for selling games with low counts because they haven't actually played a game then I did a code update.

[44:23] Huh the audits get cleared even game count so those selling games don't understand this or are being deceptive it's virtually impossible to quote a valid count without a physical counter plus it does take a few hundred games to really break in a new game to realize how it really plays things loosen ball English

[44:50] calms down bounces different just my quick thoughts as something I believe people should know and keep in mind when buying Ed Owens Ed thank you so much for the note we've said this so many times saying your game is like you know less than 200 plays is the dumbest thing I hear in for sale threads because to your point you could simply roll back the mileage on every pinball machine by do you know what I'm saying.

[45:20] I'm doing a code update so we don't know you know back in the day arcade games you could tell how many times it was played because it had a physical counter on the coin slot and how many quarters went into that machine but look the way you it's so easy to tell how much play a game has had the best way to tell is to actually stand over it and look right that's why people always ask for shooter lane picks because the shooter lane where is actually

[45:50] really good indicator after that though you're really going to want to look over a machine and see like how is the where on the game in different areas like near scoops near vertical up kicks near the slings like is any of the play field chip how bad are the dimples in the game stuff like that

[46:10] and you really need to stand over game if you want to feel like it's a low play barely used machine right we saw that guy like a couple weeks ago pirates of the Caribbean brand new 27 plays by it now it's as good as new in box 27 plays really you can put 27 plays on a game in like 15 minutes I doubt it I highly doubt it all right what else have we got here on can it is pinball podcast hold on going back

[46:35] let's see pinball predictions I asked you guys for pinball predictions I'm going to do that on another episode because I'm not going to it's going to be a dedicated show but get me more of your pinball predictions I'm going to say that now because I got a few and we will deal with pinball prediction show but I didn't get as many to fill a show as I would have liked so if you have a 2019 pinball prediction email me a can you to pinball at gmail dot com I got let's see David David

[47:05] writes an idea for p3 and David writes hi canada love the podcast I just had an idea pop into my head and I thought I'd share it with you I think the perfect theme for p3 multi morphec would be fortnight it appeals to both kids and adults and is an immensely popular franchise I have to imagine it wouldn't be that expensive of a license to secure of course I'm just pulling that out of my ass I really have no idea

[47:34] and it's a theme that would lend itself well to the multi morphec platform landing that license would instantly make p3 much more attractive to a lot of people keep up the great work Chris and keep being yourself because that's the reason we keep listening thanks David well David thank you for the note do I think that fortnight is a great idea for p3 and p3 pinball here's a deal no I'll tell you why because fortnight really already has a really great way to put it on the table

[48:04] play it and it's on a council or PC or a mobile device fortnight is humongous and the game is super fun but why would I want to play fortnight a first like you know sort of like a shooter game a third person shooter why would I want to play that on a pinball machine

[48:23] and the whole reason I fortnight is awesome is because of battle royale you know the story of fortnight the game came out and it flopped and only when they made the hundred person like battle royale mode did they you know did it take off and did it become successful

[48:40] and it's so addictive the way it works now the only reason fortnight works look at the battle royale because there's millions millions of people playing it

[48:47] so once you die you can pop back into a new game now I'm just trying to envision that as a pinball machine so so so Dave like think think how that would work like how would a game where you're running around an island shooting people and building for its translate well into pinball you would have to have a lot of other people with with p3s that are internet connected where you're playing them live

[49:11] you know and and you're battling each other like it would have to have that same feel now the problem is there's only like 30 the 40 p3s out there which means every single owner would have to have a fortnight playing at the same time to actually make it worthwhile to have that sort of like chaotic fun going on

[49:31] and they don't even have internet connection so you really would just be playing fortnight by yourself which is like defeats the whole point of fortnight and the final nail on the coffin is that fortnight is super expensive

[49:46] fortnight to partner with fortnight is more expensive than the partner with like most movies it's it's it's just to give you guys a sense of the money

[49:57] fortnight makes about 300 million dollars a month in downloadable content sales 300 million more in one month than stern will make in years and they do it every month

[50:14] all right no no no that can't save p3 i think p3 needs something like tron i think it needs like the original tron something where like that screen and using the screen to like create like the kinds of effects that you never could get on a stationary wood playfield i think it needs that you know it would be really cool i think an anime would be really cool words like constantly changing like almost like because it could be like comic book style

[50:43] or the entire playfield is like flipping over the next page and you're playing through it and as you do stuff with with the ball like it turns the pages of the comic book i don't know like i just think you'd have to be really they have to figure out how to be creative because i think what makes no sense to me in p3 is when it what you know when it does like lexie did me feels like it's like kind of like a pinball game with like 16 bit graphics even if that i don't know it just doesn't work in that it gets better with like the rocks it gets better with some of the

[51:12] other games but i think jaren needs to figure out how to make like a full pinball game not those short little experiences but a full game work with the screen now devil's advocate maybe the system in the platform is just best for those quick little fun games that are simple and i think if he gets internet connectivity i think he could he could really be on to something but he doesn't right now all right let's see i got an email from

[51:40] oh my god all right so this email is from fill up and fill up says to me got rid of ghost busters now what he says still listening to your show since almost day one still the best pinball podcast in my book thanks for the hard work i finally got rid of my ghost busters pro i'm so glad it's actually gone or finally gone the clunk fest he says it really was a clunk fest from day one slimer didn't register

[52:11] rams didn't feel right auto plunge or hit the backboard on almost every plunge i'm so not happy not easy to sell those games in swiss rillin that's for sure since i can only own one pin i'm now looking for a new one one i can actually enjoy and feel good about so i always thought toad in to be a beautiful machine some guy offered me a high end restored toad in an absolutely

[52:40] stunning condition new playfield with protector all electronics well made gold trim beautiful apron and so on just incredible it's about nine thousand including shipping lots of people tell me the toad in gets old fast since you had one what would you tell me is it getting old that fast

[53:04] alternatives would be dialed in don't like the theme but it plays really good or maybe a Chicago gaming company remake monster bash gets old pretty fast as well though thanks for your advice and keep up the good work cheers fill up

[53:20] all right well fill up that's an interesting question because it sounds like you might have room for only one pin is that is that right here am i reading that right

[53:30] um here's a deal um if you only have one pin in your collection i don't think toad in will be very um appropriate for that because as someone who had one who that was absolutely gorgeous just like the way you described yours it's an amazing game there is nothing

[53:50] against the machine itself but the problem with tells the rebe and nights is it does get old really fast because there's not a lot to do in the game

[54:00] from from a code standpoint uh you collect the jewels you battle the genie you enter genie multi-ball you save the princess and the game is over there's like not a lot else that goes on but i will say this

[54:14] toad in is probably one of the most amazing pinball machines ever at the same time the mechanisms are incredible the ramp is i think it's the sweetest ramp in pinball history

[54:24] the the toys in it them disappearing magnet the shooting stars the fireball the genie the lamp there's so much to physically do in the game uh that it but it always leaves you wanting to do a little bit more because every time you play it

[54:41] you sort of are playing the same game and you're going down the same road and i think if you're looking for a pinball machine that allows you more depth uh and allows you to sort of tackle the game in different ways

[54:54] i do think tells the rebe and nights is very very one-dimensional in that aspect now the only advice i can give you because i can't say like if you're going to have one pin

[55:03] you know go get this or go get that i i think you're going to have to go play uh machines to figure out what machine you like the most and i will say that out of

[55:13] out of a if you have a one pin collection i think you're going to probably want to look at either something from stern or something from jersey jack pinball

[55:22] uh and and then it's just going to come down to theme and what you want but you're going to want depth and so i would even narrow it down from there

[55:30] i think you're going to be looking at either a pinball machine from lineman sheets so you're looking at the walking dead Metallica uh Batman

[55:39] uh or you're going to want to look at if you look at your check i would pass on dialed in i would

[55:45] i i keep hearing better things about the hobbit with the latest code but again like i don't know that's kind of a

[55:52] mm-hmm the the the shots on the hobbit wouldn't would have me be hesitant and you have to love that theme i think a little bit right to want it

[56:01] there's also a lot of great machines that are out there that are from a little bit years prior

[56:07] i would recommend over a tales of the ravian night i would recommend if you could find a good condition

[56:15] lord of the rings i think that would be good i think if you could find a good condition

[56:21] i think you know a tron might might be satisfying to you there's just a lot of sterns that have you know

[56:27] depth that are considered to be great games you know that you can't go wrong with the remakes of attack

[56:32] from ours you know a medieval madness or or or or monster bash again i recommend just play it you

[56:38] gonna have to play it in a single home environment with with one pin you need to play the game and

[56:46] i would find a friend or find a barcade and get a lot of time on a machine before i would commit

[56:51] totain will seduce you with its sexiness though and and they are sexy machines but they will get

[56:57] old trust me when i had mine even though it was beautiful work of art i barely played it after a

[57:03] few months and i don't think you want to get into that situation all right who else do we get an

[57:07] email from uh canada pimbo at gmail.com people and you see you'll get on the air and now that i

[57:14] sound better it might be more fun for you to write in so you can hear yourself and even greater

[57:19] canada pimbo podcast or jigulation all right let's see i got more emails about ted i'm gonna skip

[57:26] on those do do do do do all right canada's driving sterns marketing so i heard this this is interesting

[57:34] this is from mark mark thank you for writing in the subject is canada driving sterns marketing

[57:41] isn't it funny how the number one pimbo company with 95% market share and the only one are the

[57:47] only ones listening to canada well first of all mark i don't know that i'm sure people have stern

[57:52] listen to a lot of other podcasts in fact i know they do you here's why because the other pimbo

[57:57] all podcast get the stern interview so i know they listen to nade and head to head and and special

[58:03] one lid i forgot to mention special one lid at the beginning of the show but oh my god like those

[58:07] interviews are incredible so they listen to more than just me um monsters launch launched at ces

[58:14] huge mainstream show where the game will get tons of broad exposure gary zak and danger dress

[58:20] up like monsters to get focus and attention cuts through noise at ces total canada move jack danger

[58:27] live stream from ces with more streams to follow code looks to be very far along high resolution

[58:33] images available to everyone at launch mini playfield really compare monster premium and to

[58:40] pirates the caribbean relative to feature and price point what would you rather have a cool lower

[58:45] playfield with multiple shots or lame pirates of the caribbean upper playfield with fewer shots

[58:52] let me start stop you there mark because i'm reading this first of all no no no no no no no no no

[58:58] i i should not get any credit for how stern launch the monsters okay it's here's why

[59:07] that's just par for the course and how you should launch anything okay you should launch your

[59:13] stuff with hiraz images with a good video with the stream of it this isn't like i didn't invent this

[59:20] i simply and reminding companies that they should do it this way i also think that you know

[59:26] dressing up like the monsters is really fun i think they went a little bit above and beyond of

[59:30] course with what they needed to do and i thought it was really fun and i think all the view out

[59:34] they're enjoyed it and i think it was refreshing to see stern and and jack danger do that launch i

[59:42] i i think we want to see more of that in the future with pinball machines um i also do not think

[59:49] that the lower playfield in the monsters makes the rocking ship and pirates of the caribbean

[59:55] look like crap or is better and and i think a lot of you out there would prefer in your lower or

[01:00:02] upper playfields to still play with the full size ball i would i think it's more fun to have the

[01:00:10] full size pinball uh be what goes into the upper or lower playfields and maybe that's just me but

[01:00:17] that's what i prefer and i also think the rocking ship and pirate of the caribbean is really

[01:00:21] impressive too like one doesn't have to trump the other they're both really cool i think they both

[01:00:27] fit perfectly into each theme of the game uh so i don't think we need to knock one over the other i do

[01:00:34] think for me the miss on the pirates is just the way the ball falls off the right side of that

[01:00:40] rocking playfield is just such a bad design it's just oh every time it happens i'm like oh why

[01:00:45] couldn't they just figure something better than this he then goes on to write black and white

[01:00:51] version causing a ton of buzz in the community we will see how it plays out but a total canada move

[01:00:57] to own the conversation about pinball monsters in on the line now and you can get one within weeks

[01:01:04] keeping the height machine alive result who cares about monster bash anymore dots are dated

[01:01:09] owls cooper orders will be cancelled people backing out will drive the price down no one gives

[01:01:14] a shit about octoberfest already old news jjp pirate of the caribbean service nightmare with lots

[01:01:20] of problems out of the box people doing weight and sea on pirate of the caribbean are just being

[01:01:25] given reasons not to buy pathetic stern wins again because they are listening to canada and doing

[01:01:31] event level game launches and then shipping the customers the their orders shortly thereafter one more

[01:01:38] look again stern's always been doing that this isn't a canada move went wins last time stern

[01:01:43] revealed the game and then made you wait months stern has always been pretty on top of it and i

[01:01:48] think now that they actually are giving you more of what you want in games they actually can have

[01:01:55] more fun launching those games because they're not there you know maybe i didn't mention this but i

[01:02:01] should the the enthusiasm i saw from the stern employees when the game is good it's such a different

[01:02:10] launch mindset it's such a different launch approach i think they're much more excited to get

[01:02:17] you a game like the monsters than they get you a game like game of thrones and i think in the past

[01:02:23] i do i think stern knows when they cut corners i think they know when they didn't go as far as they

[01:02:29] could have i think they know when they look over game and the artwork is crap i you know i kind of

[01:02:34] felt like in the past stern hasn't always been as excited and as passionate as they are with some

[01:02:42] of these newer titles and i think the monsters was probably the best stern launch we have ever seen

[01:02:50] has there been a better one right star wars they fucked up they didn't go to the star wars

[01:02:54] convention they miss like they missed every like major moment they missed comic con they they was

[01:02:59] just kind of dribbled out nothing to write home about with deadpool uh Batman you didn't get

[01:03:05] to play it like you know they brought out all three models to play stream them for us all week long

[01:03:12] dressed up like the fucking monsters Gary was at the god damn like hockey game dressed as as Eddie

[01:03:17] monster it was free or grandpa monster it was freaking incredible week of nothing but overload

[01:03:24] on the game itself and i i i can't complain about that i can't complain about that meanwhile people

[01:03:31] still haven't seen like Alice Cooper's nightmare council like a good video they haven't they haven't

[01:03:36] seen it so it's not me though this is not canada this is just how you're supposed to market pinball

[01:03:45] it's how you're supposed to market a toy i don't get credit it's like when Chris rock says like

[01:03:50] you know people can't take credit for for stuff they're not supposed to do like you can't

[01:03:54] take credit for not being in prison is what it used to say and the same is true here i'm happy to

[01:03:59] see it i'm happy to see it and and and we all know that every other company out there that's

[01:04:06] looking to get a pinball machine to market shouldn't show shit until the games are in box can you

[01:04:12] imagine a different scenario in which Chuck built 50 to a hundred Alice Cooper's nightmare castle
