[00:00] What is love?

[00:02] Baby don't hurt me

[00:04] Don't hurt me

[00:06] No more

[00:10] Baby don't hurt me

[00:12] Don't hurt me

[00:14] No more

[00:21] Good Monday Morning Pinball Fans

[00:24] This is episode 214 of Canadian Pinball Podcast

[00:28] I'm your host, Canada. Happy Monday Morning

[00:30] We are in the week leading up to T-PF

[00:34] It kicks off this Friday

[00:36] I know a lot of you are going to be traveling there

[00:40] Thursday and Friday

[00:42] Let's first wish everybody

[00:44] Who is traveling from all over the world

[00:46] And from all the different states

[00:48] And Canada, Australia

[00:50] I wish everybody

[00:52] Safe travels on your way to Texas Pinball Festival

[00:56] Even though we heard some news that a couple of manufacturers won't be showing up

[01:00] I can guarantee it's not going to make the show any less enjoyable and any less fun

[01:06] We are going to have Blake, Do Ms. Nile

[01:10] Join the show this week

[01:12] That's Blake, I know you're listening

[01:14] So that means you're confirmed to come on between some time now

[01:18] And Friday

[01:20] So let's do it

[01:22] Maybe we can do it tonight because Brenda is in Boston

[01:24] Nothing but free time

[01:26] We are going to talk about what our predictions for the show are

[01:30] And we're going to have a good time

[01:32] Look, we talked on the last episode about Stern and Chicago Gaming pulling out

[01:38] It was funny when I was reading this week in Pinball

[01:42] Because I think for a lot of you out there

[01:44] I go to that website

[01:46] To hear Jeff sort of take on all the different things going on in Pinball

[01:52] You can even read on his site

[01:54] There's just like not that much news in the world

[01:56] There's not a lot

[01:58] Everyone is saving the announcements for TPS

[02:00] And even in his story about people pulling out of Texas Pinball Festival

[02:06] He explains how disappointing and puzzling it is

[02:12] And I think it's interesting because I think Jeff's going to realize what this podcast has realized

[02:18] Many many many months if not years ago

[02:20] Is at some point you just can't deliver the news on Pinball

[02:24] You also have to give your opinion

[02:26] So I do enjoy seeing Jeff's opinion

[02:30] Creeping more and more into this week in Pinball

[02:34] That it's not just an objective news outlet

[02:38] He's going to have to start giving more opinions about how he feels

[02:42] Because I think that's important

[02:44] To know more about him as a person as well

[02:48] And that leads me to the first thing I want to talk about on this podcast

[02:52] Which is a pin-side thread that someone put up

[02:56] And the topic was basically what are your opinions on what Pinball podcast to listen to

[03:04] So someone just asked innocuously that they wanted to know what shows they should consider

[03:10] I want to thank everyone out there who recommended this show

[03:14] I think the majority of shows that were recommended are all the major ones that we know about

[03:20] So head to head Pinball, coast to coast Pinball

[03:24] You got slam tilt, you got Brodo, do you even talk Pinball?

[03:28] You got straight down the middle

[03:30] Pinball profile, there's a lot

[03:32] There's a lot out there, spooky Pinball podcast

[03:34] And I think you know sometimes people want there to be

[03:38] A lot of drama between these podcasts

[03:40] And I want to once again

[03:42] For the record state

[03:44] That there is no beef between this podcast

[03:48] And head to head Pinball podcast

[03:50] I was actually talking Orion like five minutes ago

[03:54] He's on a plane heading over to

[03:58] I forget where he's going first, but he's on his way

[04:02] He's on his way to Texas, to Vegas, to New York

[04:04] We are really good friends

[04:06] And as much as I know people want

[04:08] They don't want us to even make fun of each other

[04:12] I feel like head to head Pinball

[04:14] And Canadian Pinball podcast

[04:16] To use a good analogy in the world

[04:18] It's like listening to Katy Perry

[04:20] And Taylor Swift

[04:22] And you want to love both

[04:24] And you know that there might be a little bit of like beef between the two parties

[04:28] But you really love both of their music

[04:30] I know I speak for most of you in Pinball

[04:32] That T Swift and Katy Perry

[04:34] Are probably your go-to music choices

[04:36] But it's okay

[04:38] You guys can love both of us

[04:40] And listen to both of us

[04:42] And it won't hurt either one of our feelings

[04:44] So

[04:48] I think he's making the whole thing up

[04:52] I think he's making the whole thing up

[04:54] I think he's making the whole thing up

[04:56] I think he's making the whole thing up

[04:58] So I look forward to hanging out with Ryan

[05:02] At Texas Pinball Festival

[05:04] I'm also going to see him in New York

[05:06] Now I do want to bring up something

[05:08] That occurred in this podcast thread

[05:10] That I think is really interesting

[05:12] And if you haven't been following

[05:14] Mike from Home Pin

[05:16] And you might be new to the whole Pinball thing

[05:18] I'm not going to go over it all again

[05:20] But I want to say this

[05:22] It's so ironic

[05:24] That Mike is now back on Pinside

[05:28] And he's doing the exact same thing

[05:30] And exuding the exact same behaviors

[05:34] That led Mike to announcing

[05:36] That he's never coming back to Pinside

[05:38] If you remember Mike said he's disabling his account

[05:42] And he would not be back on Pinside

[05:44] He went over to his hometown forum

[05:46] The Aussie Arcade forum

[05:48] And he basically created such a shitster over there

[05:52] That he basically he said he's leaving

[05:56] But the moderator of that forum

[05:58] Is like, dude, you're never allowed back

[06:00] So I want to just talk about this for a minute

[06:02] Because I think that

[06:04] Mike really has this revisionist history

[06:08] About what we said about him

[06:10] Why this show

[06:12] Brought to light

[06:14] Some of the comments he made

[06:16] And why this show

[06:18] Didn't let his comments go by

[06:20] Without criticism

[06:22] Okay, long story short

[06:24] For those of you who don't remember

[06:26] Mike was sort of

[06:28] Using the drugatory language

[06:32] So imagine referring to people

[06:34] Who are of the same sex as the f-word

[06:38] And people who are black as the n-word

[06:40] And I'm just saying it like this

[06:42] He might have said that stuff

[06:44] In casual conversation amongst his friends

[06:46] And what he said

[06:48] Like in a conversation amongst his friends

[06:52] And what not at different pinball shows

[06:54] But when you get called out

[06:56] And you basically defend using that terminology

[07:00] On a public forum

[07:02] And you basically say

[07:04] Yup and I would use it again

[07:06] Because that's who I am

[07:08] And I speak my mind

[07:09] And I want to read what he said

[07:11] And because he chimed in

[07:12] On this podcast thread

[07:14] First he wrote this

[07:16] sad that some podcasts choose to warp what they talk about because of their own personal beliefs

[07:22] or biases. And so they omit things thereby presenting an incomplete and inaccurate picture to

[07:29] their listeners. Sounds very much like the way religion is presented sometimes. Okay, so right

[07:36] there he's saying that I was inaccurate and I am sort of like this religious figure that is warping

[07:43] all of your minds. So someone asked them to elaborate and then he wrote, no need. Those that do

[07:50] this know who they are and they have spelled it out in post in this very thread. A podcast that

[07:56] deliberately decides to leave things out of their podcast does themselves no favors. It should be

[08:04] realized that every single person in the world has a different opinion and also a different way

[08:10] of expressing that opinion. That doesn't make it right or wrong. It's just different. Okay, Mike,

[08:16] I want to stop you there brother because I want to just stop and say you don't get it. You don't

[08:23] get it. It's not right or wrong. It's it's not saying it's different. It is right or wrong. Okay,

[08:30] there is a right way to talk about people and there's a wrong way to talk about people. All right,

[08:36] you make it sound like it's just different that you can't you can't say to me that using the

[08:43] N word and using the F word to describe people of same sex, it's just a different way to talk about

[08:50] them. You look you can decide to talk about them that way and you can justify it because that's

[08:57] just the way you and your buddies talk, but it's wrong. And if you think it's not wrong,

[09:03] then I encourage you to do this. I encourage you to go up to someone of the same sex and ask

[09:09] them how you could appropriately and casually use the F word or go up to African Americans, Mike,

[09:16] and ask them what's the appropriate casual way to use the N word that they would find acceptable

[09:22] coming from you. All right, so that's he continues. He continues to keep this hard line stance on

[09:29] this whole thing. And I love that Ryan, who interviewed Mike, he interviewed Mike and when asked

[09:37] about whether or not there would be the ability to update the code in the game when when Mike was

[09:43] interviewed with Ryan, he said no. And then when he was called out on it, Mike went and accused

[09:50] head to head pinball of editing out part of that interview, which was a total lie on Mike's part.

[09:57] And so look, this whole thing, it's a dramatic shit storm. All right, it doesn't end. And I think Mike

[10:05] is once again, once again doing what he does best, which is he's not just focusing on his pinball

[10:12] machine. He's coming out and he's accusing people of being liars, of spinning the truth, of not

[10:20] really understanding him in the in the proper context. And let me ask all of you guys out there.

[10:26] Okay, what other pinball manufacturer do you company out there? What other company out there in

[10:33] the pinball world would make you feel bad about buying their product because of that company's

[10:39] personal beliefs? Right? Do you know Gary Stern's personal beliefs or Charlie's? Right? Do you know

[10:47] Doug's at Chicago gaming? Do you know how these guys think politically and about like

[10:53] political, you know, same sex marriage topics? Do you know how these guys talk about people of

[10:57] of of color? No. But why do we know all of this stuff about Mike? And why has he decided to allow

[11:05] all of this stuff to be part of the reputation of his company? And I'll tell you, it's all because

[11:10] of him. Like I didn't make this stuff up. I didn't put words in his mouth. These arguments began on

[11:18] the OCS arcade forum. And instead of just apologizing and say, Hey, look, I said these things behind

[11:24] closed doors. I didn't mean it to get out there. I didn't mean any harm by it. Everything would have

[11:29] gone away. But instead Mike just became a very bullish on all of this. And I look, I don't like

[11:37] covering drama like this because as I've said before, and I think Ryan and Marty, I think I love

[11:42] their approach of like, you know what? We're just not even going to talk about this guy because it's

[11:46] not worth it. But I just find it funny that Mike is jumping into a thread about which pinball

[11:54] podcasts are great. And then he comes into that thread to argue about the validity of this podcast

[12:02] and head to head pinball's podcast. Okay. I honestly, I think he's crazy at this point. I really do.

[12:09] I just don't understand why this guy continues to bury his chances. And I'll tell you why between

[12:15] my podcast and Ryan's podcast and Marty's podcast, we have a good chunk of the new inbox pinball

[12:23] collector audience who listens to both of our podcasts. And Mike really wants to pick a fight

[12:29] with us. I mean, who does that? Who does that? I mean, we say on this podcast, I say all sorts of

[12:37] things that aren't always positive about Stern, about spooky, about Jersey Jack. You know, I speak

[12:42] my mind. I think I do it in a professional manner. It's not a personal attack against these

[12:48] companies. And never have I had anyone else ever either going to public forum or say slander's

[12:56] things about me. And look, if I've said something, and I think you guys listen to this podcast enough

[13:03] when I say things that I think are wrong, when I think are incorrect, when I think are

[13:08] insensitive, I will be the first person to apologize and say I was wrong. And I shouldn't have

[13:13] said that. And I apologize for for making remarks that I should not have. Okay. And I just I just

[13:20] think Mike, at this point, Mike, you've got nothing left. You've got nowhere else to go. I think

[13:28] what you need to do, Mike, I'm going to give you some advice. I think you need to cultivate the last

[13:33] remaining pinball community that allows you to be on it. Right? Robin could very easily ban you

[13:41] from pinside. He hasn't. But you've been banned from off-the arcade forum. And if you want to

[13:49] remain a public figure in the pinball world, you just you're not going to fight your way to success.

[13:57] I mean, I've never seen anything like it. Like I've never seen a company that literally tries to

[14:02] succeed by battling the community. I mean, it is a unique approach. I think it's one that is going

[14:09] to fail horribly for Mike unless he changes his ways. Because as I was saying, there is no other pinball

[14:16] company out there that makes people feel bad for owning their product because of what a close-minded

[14:22] person the founder is of the company. And I love what Mike said too. And this this part is the

[14:28] dangerous part about how Mike thinks. He said something when someone was questioning like,

[14:34] you know, all the of the things he's been saying, he goes, you see, that's me being honest. And you

[14:41] being easily tricked. You have no idea what the owners of spooky are thinking because they hide

[14:47] their true opinions from the public. All right. So what does he mean by that? Does he mean that like

[14:53] spooky might want to use the N word and the F word or spook, you know, spooky is not telling you

[14:58] who they really are because if they showed their true colors, you would be just as upset with them as

[15:04] you are with with me. Is that what you're saying, Mike? He says, that's smart and I will admit I am dumb.

[15:10] But that's me. And if you are tricked by their lack of public openness, well, that's up to you.

[15:16] Some some need to look past the person and look at the bigger picture. Thanks for your honest

[15:22] post. I do appreciate honesty. But as you clearly state, it is not always the best policy.

[15:28] All right, Mike, you know what? Dude, you just got to I just think this guy just needs to make your

[15:33] game, ship your game and let the merits of your game do the talking. We know that you stole Ben

[15:40] Hex board. We know that you've said things that are ridiculous. You've battled everybody in every

[15:47] forum. We're going to just say enough is enough. Ship thunderbirds. Let's see who buys it. Okay.

[15:54] Let your game do the talking. And the last point I'll make is, you know what? That game better do

[16:00] some great talking because there's a lot of competition, Mike. And if you forget what you used to do,

[16:06] you used to go into other manufacturers threads and shit all over them.

[16:10] Shit all over the companies. Make fun of the games. Make fun of how they were developing their

[16:14] machines. And then you're coming out with a pinball machine in 2018 that has orange freaking

[16:20] DMD dots. And you were making fun of how other pinball companies were making their products. Look,

[16:25] you got an uphill battle, my friend. You got an uphill battle. And all I'm going to say is,

[16:32] you did it wrong, man. You did it wrong. Anyway, let's move on from like from home pin. But I just

[16:36] found it funny that he continues to pop up like a whack of mall. Every time he says he's not going to

[16:42] show back up on a forum. He's back up on a forum. All right. Well, what else is going on in the pinball

[16:47] world? Look, it's it's going to be a great show for spooky. Spooky got the best news imaginable

[16:57] when CG sees like we're pulling out. I think spooky got the best news imaginable when Stern said

[17:02] they're not going to show iron maiden. I think that Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. If you think

[17:08] about the show right now, Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is the only pin, brand new pin that we

[17:15] haven't seen before. All right. It is it is going to it is going to have the spotlight. It is going to

[17:22] have center stage. And I will say this, it's their show to win or lose in terms of hype and in

[17:28] terms of sales coming from the show because the rest of the games we're going to see we've seen

[17:34] before. People have played before. There's nothing new. Like how do you wow people with pirates of

[17:40] the Caribbean? How do you wow people with Houdini? I mean, I'm just when I say wow, I mean get that

[17:48] initial wow impact. I don't mean people are not going to enjoy those machines. Okay, let me just

[17:52] let me just stop people there. I'm not saying anything negative about those machines. I'm saying

[17:57] there is nothing like that moment when you see a pinball machine for the first time.

[18:03] Remember when they revealed pirates? Remember how excited everybody was? Remember that energy?

[18:09] People were so excited that they immediately went in with their distributor and ordered 12,500

[18:16] versions of the game. Now imagine if Jersey Jack had that excitement and enthusiasm but also

[18:24] announced they were shipping that game within a month or two. Imagine the difference, right? And

[18:30] that's the advantage I think spooky is going to have is that this game is going to be ready for

[18:36] the line. And I think people are going to be handing him money immediately. I got to go feed Bubba,

[18:41] hold on a quick pause. All right, Bubba is being fed right now. I love it. He just barks like whenever

[18:46] he's hungry. So spooky pinball. I think again, I think Tpf is going to be their show. I think there's

[18:55] a lot. A lot of people who are going to go in on Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle if spooky can take

[19:03] their money and get them their games pretty quickly. And we know this. That spooky's assembly line

[19:08] and their production line gets it done. They get it done. You know, I've said some not so nice

[19:15] things about Rob Zombie in America's most haunted. I don't think they're the greatest games. I

[19:19] don't think you think they're the greatest games. I think spooky knows that this is the game.

[19:25] This is the game that they need to have a hit with. And I'm excited for it. I know they know it

[19:31] needs to be great. I know from certain people that have seen some stuff that it's going to look

[19:36] amazing. So it's got a lot going for it. And the fact that Stern and Chicago gaming are not going

[19:44] to be there. Man, man, it is, it is a two spooky's advantage. All right. So who else at this show is

[19:51] really going to be looking to make a splash, right? I mean, I've been thinking about that. And so

[19:56] kingpin, we saw that kingpin is going to be revealed at Tpf. And look, I hope it's not that new

[20:03] art package on kingpin. I really, really hope they didn't go in that direction. But look at the

[20:09] thing about kingpin is this we've seen kingpin. We all know the game kingpin. It's one of these

[20:14] ultra rare prototype games. There's only what eight in the world selling from anywhere from 30 to

[20:20] 40 to 50,000 dollars. And now we're being told they're going to remake it. Now the thing with this

[20:27] is kingpin is being remade by who, right? This pinball circus people. And what have they done?

[20:34] What have they managed to make ever? I mean, they went off and they've been trying to make that

[20:40] Python Angelo game for years now. And nothing's been completed. And now they're going to remake kingpin.

[20:48] I just don't, I don't have faith in these companies who upload a picture of like the production or

[20:57] when they're working on the game. And it just looks like a couple of dudes in a garage. Because I

[21:01] think it's one thing to make a prototype version of a game. But to actually put something into

[21:08] production, I have very little faith in it. Now if spooky pinball was like, oh, we're going to,

[21:14] we're going to be manufacturing the remake of kingpin. It'd be like take my money now. And I think

[21:19] that's where we're at in pinball right now is unless you have a proven production line or unless

[21:26] these guys show like a final version of kingpin that's been completely remade and they have a path

[21:33] to manufacturing. I just don't know how you feel good about it to hear Bubba barking again

[21:40] in the background. I mean, this guy unbelievable. Sometimes I don't know if Bubba needs to go out or

[21:45] if he's just hungry. Anyway, so I don't know how you feel good about kingpin being remade.

[21:52] I think that if they do remake it, if we were just going to talk hypothetically, knowing that

[21:58] that's an ultra rare game. If I could give these guys some marketing advice, I would announce a very,

[22:04] very small run of kingpin. I don't think you make 200. I don't think you make 400. I think you

[22:10] make like 50. And again, because I don't think this company has the manufacturing capability

[22:19] to make hundreds of kingpins. This is not a company within assembly line. Where's this game going

[22:26] to be made? Are they sourcing it out? Who knows? There's so many more question marks. I really hope

[22:33] they don't take pre-order dollars on kingpin without knowing they can get people their games. I hope

[22:39] that's not going to be the case. All right. And what else is going on with TPM? So Stern, we talked

[22:45] all about them. I'm disappointed. I think, you know, imagine, why does, here's the question I have.

[22:52] Why do you have to be able to play the game at TPM to reveal the game at TPM? When you go to a car

[22:58] show, do you get to drive the car or do you get just to see it? Right? They give you the specs. They

[23:04] show you the car comes out. It's like on a little rotating stage. You don't get to drive it. Media

[23:08] don't get to give their first impressions. So why is there so much pressure that every time a game

[23:14] is ready to be revealed that it also has to be playable? Now, we know what happened when they

[23:20] showed Batman last time and it was just there and no one could jump on it and everybody was like

[23:24] bummed out. But there was a reason why we found out is the code was like nowhere near playable.

[23:31] Which always begs the question. They just revealed Batman too early. But from what I'm hearing,

[23:38] Iron Maiden is not in the same place that Batman 66 was when it was revealed. Iron Maiden,

[23:45] the code is far along. Iron Maiden is ready to be shown. That's what I'm hearing. And so

[23:50] Stern's decision not to show it. I mean, I just don't know. I feel like they keep,

[23:56] they keep acting like these pinball shows don't matter. Now speaking of pinball shows not

[24:04] we got the news last week that pinball expo is no more in the sense of the way it used to be.

[24:12] Now, I think it's about time that everyone just admits that pinball expo has fallen off. It is never been

[24:23] the last few years. Pinball expo has continued to slide further and further down in terms of

[24:31] being a great pinball show. Now it's unfortunate because Chicago is the home of pinball.

[24:37] And with Chicago being the home of pinball, it's kind of sad that the main pinball show

[24:45] has become so poorly run. And I think I've heard all the drama about Mike and this and that and

[24:52] what not. And so now it seems that his partner is breaking away and Rob Burke and Chicago pinball expo

[25:02] will now have this like apparently maybe two shows. So Rob Burke is going to break away and have a show

[25:09] in September called pinball polusa. But apparently Mike is also planning to still have expo in October.

[25:19] So that's stupid. There is no way there is room for two competitive pinball shows a month apart.

[25:28] I actually prefer going to Chicago in September solely because it's warmer.

[25:35] So that that that that is my vote. And look, it's just like it's just silly that these guys couldn't

[25:43] work it out or we just can't get a better show in Chicago. And with Stern being in Chicago, I think

[25:50] I think it's not just Mike, it's not just Rob, it's Stern being there, it's Stern's backyard,

[25:55] American pinball is in Chicago, you've got all these pinball personalities in Chicago,

[26:00] all of them couldn't just come together and say how can we do this right? And I think it's really

[26:07] unfortunate. I think Stern should have led more of the charge to make Chicago pinball expo

[26:14] something magnificent. I think instead Stern tried to like compete with it a little bit. And it was always like

[26:21] Stern's going to do this major party off site and Stern's going to charge people to come into this

[26:26] off site. And then you'd always have like the pinball life party would happen at another location. And I

[26:31] always felt like when I went to Chicago pinball expo that I that I was torn that I'd travel there.

[26:37] But yet half the things I wanted to go do weren't even at the show. And I think that's the other

[26:42] thing is if you're having these shows a month apart, there's no way people are going to travel back

[26:48] again to Chicago. So I think the pressure is on to see which show delivers the most. Because they're

[26:56] going to be competing now to get manufacturers to choose their show as the place to to see new

[27:04] stuff. So will manufacturers remain loyal to Mike and reveal games at expo or are they going to

[27:11] switch gears and go to pinball polusa instead? I really I can't imagine any any faster way

[27:21] to not getting laid than to asking a girl if she if she'd rather go to pinball polusa or

[27:27] Chicago pinball expo. I mean seriously. I mean I can't even believe like we now have like two to

[27:32] choose from in the same city. All right. So I'm also reading pinside and I'm seeing a thread all

[27:37] of a sudden bump to the top of pinside that is multi-morphic p3 at Texas pinball festival 2017.

[27:47] Postpix video reviews here and that thread has three pages of activity from a year ago.

[27:54] And people are chiming in at frolic just chimed in and said I wish I could inject some wind behind

[28:00] the p3 sales. Here we are with a new game being shown at tpf and nobody is talking about it. Why

[28:06] do you think that is frolic? Let's see was it cosmic cart racing is going to be shown from p3

[28:15] multi-morphic because the answer is simple p3 multi-morphic has made the runs that shows now for

[28:24] over five years. People have seen the platform and it is the exact reason why it's really hard to

[28:33] get people excited again and again and again and again when the platform is the same and nothing

[28:40] on the platform has popped out and just like blown people away. I mean it's like oh I want to say

[28:47] this with being nice but I also want to just be honest it's just like at what point at what point

[28:55] is like have you seen p3 multi-morphic enough at what point have you seen it all and I think you've

[29:02] seen it all. I don't think like you're going to get like another title right now that's going to

[29:07] be like oh now I'm going to go in when p3 multi-morphic was announced five years ago right when it

[29:15] was announced the pinball marketplace had very few players in it if Jerry was able to get that

[29:22] product to market when he had the idea it would have been much different but now you're really

[29:29] asking people to spend ten thousand dollars on this platform ten grand all right and look at the

[29:37] options that they have now they've got remakes from Chicago gaming they've got all the titles from

[29:43] Stern they've got all the titles from spooky they've got all the titles from Jersey Jack pinball

[29:49] right there's now like kingpin being remade there's like there's Houdini there are so there's

[29:56] you know I don't need I didn't even throw in like alien and and the big Lebowski there's like

[30:00] there are literally there are literally like eight or more pinball manufacturers competing with

[30:06] multi-morphic and it's and here's the thing as much as everybody will publicly celebrate all new

[30:15] pinball it's now harder than ever harder than ever to sell pinball machines to people there is more

[30:25] competition now than ever before and if your thread has just three pages of activity I mean I

[30:35] don't know what you go do to drum up excitement for this thing um you know and Jerry's a good guy

[30:42] he's a good guy and it's nothing personal it's just like until this platform gets gets something that

[30:51] pops you're just not gonna see people gravitating towards it and and Jerry reached out to me to

[30:57] maybe help him figure out a way to get a title I here's the thing is like I I can't go do a licensing

[31:03] deal you need money to do a licensing deal my job I'm not a venture capitalist I can't help you

[31:10] raise money I can't I don't know where all the money went I think a lot of money goes into pinball

[31:19] ventures and I sometimes I think you can spend the money in the wrong ways and I've said this before

[31:27] nobody ever said they need so much of a pinball machine to be re-engineered I think look what

[31:35] happened to Andrew highway he had to like try a whole different way with the modular system and

[31:40] swappable playfields go into the highway pinball thread and read from the people who bought full

[31:49] throttle read what those people are saying those people are just trying to get the swappable alien

[31:56] kit now they want to buy it they have their money out they say can you sell me the alien kit I paid

[32:03] for and they are never going to be made whole highway pinball will most likely never make the

[32:10] swappable alien kit which was the whole premise behind Andrew highway's company that was what

[32:18] differentiated him all right I mean p3's got their differentiator and I'm just I'm just you know

[32:26] as I see these companies constantly trying to differentiate and then I look over and stern

[32:31] pinballs just selling millions at a house with the product you know who deenies who deenies a normal

[32:37] pinball machine that's selling spooky pinball makes normal pinball machines that sell I just haven't

[32:43] seen a scenario in which this like leap forward this huge leap forward and innovation has led to

[32:52] any sales okay and that's just the way it is you know frolic if frolic do you even own a p3 do you

[33:00] own one I mean I don't know does he go buy one I just don't see people unboxing p3 multi morphings

[33:08] I don't see any unboxings happening I I where are these games where are these like how many

[33:14] have shipped to date and I and I just think it's like at the point now where um you know

[33:21] they need to get the title to move to move the platform and it's not on me it's not right because

[33:26] look I'm a good marketer I'm a good marketer but I'm not I can't I can't correct marketing decisions

[33:35] that have already been made okay in my field when I get handed something that's like already got

[33:42] a lot of issues you can't market spin something especially in pinball and I've said this before

[33:49] like you don't have to overthink pinball but you do need to give people something they want and you

[33:55] can't think your Steve jobs and be like I'm gonna give people the thing they know they don't even know

[34:01] it's not that kind of industry it's not like we know what works in pinball and we know what

[34:06] people are looking for and you've got to deliver on one of those simple things if you try to do too

[34:12] much you know it's like it ends you end up here with three pages of activity from from your show

[34:20] last year and we've got to bump up a Texas pinball thread from last year um the only look and look

[34:27] if cosmic heart racing is incredible and it blows people away cool you know look I think again

[34:32] like people have played this thing for so many years it's so many shows and at what point

[34:39] at what point are you like I don't know how do we get people buying this thing um so that's where

[34:44] it's at you know look and look this is hard for me too because man like I say this stuff and then

[34:48] I go to these shows and I want to have a good time at these shows and I have to walk by these guys

[34:52] I have to walk by Jerry you have to walk by Charlie you have to walk by them and I am you know I'm not

[34:57] afraid to walk by the show and see these people face to face but I just got to give my my my

[35:03] opinions and my take on these things I I don't know what else to do I think I'm as nice as possible

[35:09] and I think everyone out there who makes a pinball machine um your machine has to do the talking

[35:15] your machine has to do the talking and uh I'm allowed to give my opinion about machines and you know

[35:21] look I caught a lot of flack for not being like cheerleading 100% Houdini but I thought I was

[35:26] fair with the Houdini I look I'm reading the Houdini thread people love it people are getting

[35:31] their Houdinis and they are really enjoying the machine now who you gonna believe more here's the

[35:36] hard part who you gonna believe more the guy who has it plays it every day who gives you feedback

[35:41] or me now the problem is this is people always tend to hype the machine they just bought like

[35:47] when's the last time someone's like oh man I just bought dialed in and I'm not really feeling it

[35:52] those people remain pretty quiet and they sort of sell the game under the radar um but

[35:58] the only person who can formulate an opinion about a game and whether you should own that game

[36:05] the only person who can really tell you if it's the right game for you is you you have to go see

[36:12] if it's the kind of game you like and if you can't then you better find some

[36:17] motherfuckers you trust on the forum and listen to their opinions all right so that's

[36:25] that's that's my take all right there's there's gonna be here's the thing that scares me to death

[36:31] is there are other pinball machines coming out that you don't even know about all right there's

[36:37] more coming to this marketplace and I'm concerned I'm really concerned that there's too many people

[36:44] uh fighting for not a big enough piece of a pie there's not enough money in this hobby

[36:52] to accomplish what a lot of these companies are trying to do and it's because the only portion

[37:00] of the pie that's available to these startups isn't the stern portion of the pie or the Chicago

[37:07] gaming portion of the pie when you're small I mean you're fighting for boutique dollars and

[37:14] but the problem is this the problem is this nobody wants to wait nobody wants to wait nobody's

[37:20] gonna like go in and and and give you money unless you're proven uh because we saw what happened

[37:26] with all the manufacturers who burned people and it's really hard to compete with you know here's

[37:32] a famous IP and you can have this game tomorrow like you can have Star Wars you can have Batman you

[37:36] can have Ghostbusters no don't buy those games that could be in your game room tomorrow let's wait

[37:42] and go in on a new company that has absolutely you know no track record all right now look there are

[37:49] some companies coming out that I'm really excited for there's things coming down the pipeline that

[37:56] I've seen that I know about that you don't that I that I think are gonna blow people away um but I

[38:02] do think all of those companies are gonna run into some hesitation and some you know cynicism

[38:10] about their ability to deliver now from a marketing standpoint I think some of these companies coming

[38:15] out are are doing it right and you're gonna know more about them as we sort of go on this year

[38:20] and this stuff's gonna come to light this year I know it's terrifying imagine all you know coming

[38:26] out asking for your money that there's more coming that is gonna be asking for your money

[38:32] but we'll talk more about those things as they develop but it's it's an interesting time to be

[38:38] in the hobby right so let me let me go to some user email and then we'll call the day because I

[38:44] got I got to exercise and I got to get to work sorry guys money morning um we'll have some more

[38:49] interviews coming up I know it's been just me for a while uh let's see so I got an email from Josh

[38:57] Kugler Josh thank you for reaching out um

[39:01] Duh Duh Duh Duh and Josh was just basically saying like canada like you didn't get my tone

[39:06] when I wrote in the thread I know he was he wasn't saying like you're wrong and I'm right I know

[39:10] he was being sarcastic um he said the speed of games leaving here continues to increase each week

[39:16] um as you have seen in my post quality before quantity um as you have also seen there have been

[39:24] very few issues with Houdini machines especially when you compare it to well and then he said

[39:29] fill in the blank um and I also read something that was really interesting that Joe Ballsor plays

[39:35] every machine for 20 minutes before it is put into a box to make sure everything is working right

[39:42] and I I thought that was great you know I think I do think these guys are doing it right

[39:47] and they're making sure that every game uh is quality because every uh new in box game

[39:54] from a new manufacturer lives or dies by the initial word amount and quality is the most important

[40:01] thing I mean we all saw uh all those alien pinballs being opened up and being broken and having

[40:09] issues immediately and we all saw what that what that caused in in terms of people's desire to

[40:17] stick with that company all right he then goes on to say the lap track bit poking fun at head to

[40:23] head was very funny I laughed every time you played it those guys do laugh a lot seems a lot of

[40:39] it are things only they would laugh at either that or they are smoking some really good stuff

[40:46] nice to see you guys having some fun poking fun at each other important that us pinball people

[40:51] don't take ourselves too seriously uh the Broadway play part was pretty amusing I look forward

[40:57] to hearing some of the dialogue from it will it be a musical uh you are welcome to visit us

[41:03] in Chicago anytime hope to give you a tour of the factory and give you some pinball playing lessons

[41:09] well Josh thank you um I definitely will take you guys up on that factory toy I always love the

[41:14] seed pinball machines being made behind the scenes and I think you're right I mean look there is always

[41:20] a lot of drama in this hobby and and and I was reading Ryan's post on the podcast thread on

[41:25] pin sign and he's basically like like we we we've decided not to focus on a lot of the drama because

[41:30] drama is cancer and whatnot now my opinion is how do you cover the pinball hobby and the pinball

[41:38] collector hobby without talking about the drama because half of the companies out there are dramatic

[41:46] have cost people money and half of the personalities in this hobby are are dramatic and so look you

[41:52] know you can look at it either way I tend to try and focus on all aspects of this hobby including

[41:59] the drama and yes when I do see dramatic situations where I do sort of feel like we're identifying

[42:05] something that needs to be brought to light that might not be positive I still think we should

[42:10] I don't think we should shy away from things that are happening in the hobby just because uh it

[42:15] doesn't make us feel good right all right I got an email let's see do do do do do from Dave

[42:23] Falgrain Dave thank you for writing and Dave's been a guest to the show recently we're going to

[42:27] get him back on he wrote two of my new inbox friends are taking their remake money to buy pirates

[42:34] wonder how much Chicago gaming lost by not releasing the new remake tax return season is prime

[42:42] pinball purchase time sold two games in the last three weeks myself remember pinball people have

[42:48] to buy new pins or they'll die see in Texas Dave well Dave here's a thing um I think your friends

[42:55] are idiots now tell you why why would they why would they go buy pirates and not the new game

[43:02] from Chicago gaming I'll tell you why I think your friends are idiots because I don't think pirates

[43:07] of the Caribbean is going to ship before Chicago gaming's game number three so what would the rush

[43:16] be like why would they pull their money uh because they haven't seen Chicago gaming game number three

[43:22] and so you know it also begs the question is what is game number three and I I was reading that

[43:27] thread so now it's gone from monster bash wasn't it was almost certainly going to be monster

[43:34] and now we've got people saying it's big bang bar we've got people saying it's it's circus

[43:38] Voltaire and I think the comment that Chicago gaming made uh in that they are sort of uh sort of

[43:45] redesigning some of the innovation in the game or adding more to it has led people to believe that

[43:51] there's going to be some new code and so then people are saying well which game needs

[43:57] additional code and support and it's not monster bash big bang bar is a game that wasn't fully

[44:03] flushed out code wise uh it's anyone's guess it's anyone's guess I think that Chicago gaming has

[44:10] created a lot of conversation by purposely making us wonder what it's going to be I think when they

[44:18] announce all those titles they're going to make it once isn't that interesting by announcing so

[44:22] many of them you know theater of magic big bang bars circus Voltaire cactus canyon monster bash by

[44:29] saying it could be any one of these games and it could also be uh another game that's original

[44:36] now they they've almost done the opposite of what Stern does in which Stern wants to keep every

[44:41] title completely secret and every title private and yet where are we at with Stern we know what

[44:47] every new game is they just won't admit it we know it's iron maiden we know it's Deadpool we know

[44:51] there's beetles we know there's monsters you know we know these games are coming out maybe there's

[44:55] Jurassic World in there but no Stern title is ever a complete mystery anymore and yet Chicago gaming

[45:02] is like here's everything we're coming out with over the next few years it's your guess which

[45:05] which order they're going to be in and I kind of wish Stern would just do that for us so we could

[45:10] just wait and we all know Jersey jacks got toy story in Willy Wonka maybe guns and roses coming

[45:16] we know this like if you buy pie to the Caribbean you know toy story in Willy Wonka are coming

[45:22] you know it's just when that's going to happen is the only question mark and the same is true with

[45:27] Chicago gaming I do like the approach of just letting us know the titles and let you know

[45:33] because we're going to be waiting a few years anyway to get to all of them so it's no harm no foul

[45:40] I think Stern's sort of got a lot more to lose and Stern has a lot more at stake because

[45:46] they need the line to keep moving and if people pause on a title because they know about another

[45:51] title coming out it's not going to it's not going to help their bottom line but I'll say this I

[45:57] keep hearing that Stern had their best year ever last year and if Stern had their best year ever

[46:02] last year and that included like the leaks and the delays and this and that I don't think anything

[46:08] can really touch them with the titles they have I really don't all right one last bit of gossip

[46:14] that I heard then we're going to we're going to call it a day because I got to exercise so I heard

[46:18] from multiple sources that and this probably happened months ago this probably I don't know when

[46:22] the timeline is for this but do you know that Dutch Pimbal went to Chicago gaming company and tried

[46:29] to ink a deal to get Chicago gaming company to make the big Lebowski Pimbal and Chicago gaming

[46:35] company turned them down so I don't know if that happened before this Chinese contract manufacturer

[46:41] came on board probably did I don't think they would do it after I don't think that's that rumour

[46:47] if that if that happened now yeah then I'd be really worried um but that's that just goes to show

[46:53] these guys they've just been trying to figure out a solve for this thing and I don't know it just

[46:58] doesn't it just doesn't look good it's it's March and still no real word on when people are going

[47:04] to get their big Lebowski's all right everyone enough of the drama you know enough of the drama

[47:09] can't we all just get along in the Pimbal world stop it I sound like I'm going to the toilet

[47:16] all right everyone that's episode two fourteen of Canadian Pimbal podcast um we're going to be a

[47:21] T.P.F. this week lots of fun stuff coming I'm gonna bring my my snowball mic maybe we'll get like

[47:27] Ryan and some other podcasters to do like a podcast Royal Rumble from the show that'll be funny

[47:33] everyone have a great Monday have a great beginning to your week and we'll talk to you real soon

[47:46] no
