[00:00] I got shit that bad love

[00:02] You can't know now

[00:04] And no one's gonna say this

[00:06] It's gonna be the box-box

[00:14] Happy Halloween everybody

[00:16] Welcome to episode 277 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:21] I'm your host, Canada

[00:22] This is gonna be a special like fright-filled podcast

[00:26] Where we talk about what scares me

[00:29] in the pinball hobby these days

[00:31] or a little Halloween theme for you

[00:32] But I love Halloween

[00:34] It's not just the abundance of candy

[00:37] I've been consuming at work as I stress eat

[00:40] But I love seeing every adult

[00:43] or most adults dress up

[00:45] and act like kids for a day

[00:47] I think it's fun

[00:48] But I also love all of my co-workers posting photos

[00:51] of leaving work early to take their kids' trick or treating

[00:56] And I think if there's anything that's really awesome about

[01:00] days like Halloween

[01:02] It's where whether you're a kid or you're an adult

[01:04] you're allowed to really be young at heart

[01:07] and show the world your playful side

[01:10] And I think that's really important

[01:12] because I think as I look at the pinball hobby lately

[01:15] I've seen a lot of stuff go on

[01:17] that just doesn't feel playful

[01:19] It doesn't feel like it's the kind of conversation

[01:23] we should be having around pinball

[01:26] And I think if I were to think of one thing

[01:28] that scares me the most in this pinball hobby

[01:32] it is that a lot of people out there

[01:35] they've lost touch with just the sheer joy

[01:39] that this thing is supposed to bring into your life

[01:43] It is a toy

[01:44] It is an unnecessary toy that is supposed to provide

[01:48] So you know a few minutes of entertainment

[01:50] It's not supposed to be more than that

[01:52] It's not supposed to be the most important thing in your life

[01:56] It's not supposed to be the thing you think about all day long

[01:59] It's a toy that's just meant to bring

[02:02] some temporary pleasure into the world

[02:04] And it does that for many many people who play and love pinball

[02:08] But most recently

[02:10] And I think I see this in two fronts

[02:13] I'm seeing this with the Beatles discussion

[02:17] And I'm seeing it around the discussion

[02:19] with the monkey in American pinball

[02:23] It's like let's talk about this for a minute

[02:25] Because you can read both of those game launches

[02:30] And the conversation surrounding both those games

[02:33] And it's just exhaustive

[02:35] Like you literally will come out of

[02:38] People complaining about Beatles

[02:40] Just feeling exhausted

[02:42] And you'll come out of people using the monkey

[02:46] on the back glass of October Fest

[02:48] And just feel completely drained and exhausted

[02:51] And somewhere under all of that rubble

[02:55] Of debate of anger of conversation

[02:59] Remains a simple pinball machine

[03:02] That is just a toy to bring joy to people

[03:07] And I think when you lose that

[03:09] When you lose the context of the thing you're thinking about

[03:15] And talking about and arguing about all day long

[03:19] I think it puts people in a really bad head space

[03:23] Let's take the Beatles for example

[03:25] And look, I'm going to talk about the Beatles in a way on this episode

[03:28] That I think is fair

[03:30] And I do

[03:31] I don't think everything that Stern is doing with this game is like

[03:35] Perfect

[03:35] And I don't think this is the Beatles game that some of you want it

[03:39] And I understand like what you're coming from

[03:42] Right, but I also don't think Stern

[03:44] You know made the worst game ever

[03:46] And is deserved of all of the anger

[03:50] And the commentary surrounding this game

[03:53] Because I also think there is a level of hypocrisy

[03:57] In all of the sort of debate surrounding this title

[04:01] You know on one level

[04:03] You have people saying well the Beatles fan base is really old

[04:06] Their last concert together was like 1970s

[04:08] So like Beatles fans are like 60, 70 years old

[04:12] Okay, so you're saying the demo that is into the Beatles is old

[04:16] So then Stern goes and makes a game that is easy and approachable

[04:21] For casual pinball players

[04:24] And older people who might be into pinball who didn't grow up

[04:27] With these like super complex depth driven code games

[04:32] With 18 wizard modes and multipliers and chess math to do

[04:37] To figure out what to shoot

[04:39] They made a throwback game

[04:41] And so you know that seemingly is the kind of game

[04:46] You would make if you were targeting that demographic

[04:50] But that's not what people are saying

[04:53] They want it like a modern version of a pinball machine

[04:58] Based upon the Beatles error of yellow submarine or whatever

[05:02] Right, so it's like they can't win there

[05:05] It's like they just can't win

[05:06] It's like you can't have it both ways

[05:08] The other thing that I keep hearing people complain about is

[05:12] Is how Stern fuck this up

[05:13] How Stern doesn't know what they're doing

[05:15] Now Stern's gonna like they're gonna take it on the chin

[05:18] They're gonna learn in the hard way

[05:19] Like all these things

[05:21] All these things that people are complaining about

[05:24] And I really just have one simple question

[05:26] Does anyone who's on pin side know how to run a successful pinball company?

[05:32] Does anybody?

[05:33] Does anyone there successfully proven that they know how to run a pinball company

[05:39] And stay in business through good times and bad times

[05:43] You guys know how to do this better than Stern, right?

[05:45] You know how to make this game better than Stern

[05:48] The other thing is you have no idea

[05:51] What went on behind the scenes about the creation of this game

[05:55] And this is why I said Stern should be more transparent

[06:00] in communicating the origins of why this game is the way it is

[06:04] You have no idea what the Beatles asked for

[06:08] You have no idea what the license prohibited

[06:13] And what the license allowed

[06:15] You have no idea how the music structure worked

[06:18] You know you're complaining about these songs and that song

[06:21] You have no idea how much money that costs

[06:23] You have no idea about any of it

[06:26] So everything you're complaining and moaning and groaning about

[06:29] There might be a very reasonable explanation

[06:33] That would get you to just shut up about it

[06:36] But that's not good enough

[06:38] There's just like feeling that you've been wronged

[06:43] And you've been entitled to get the Beatles pinball machine that you want

[06:48] And that scares me

[06:50] It scares me that people on the pinside look at a company like Stern

[06:55] Who has really been the only company that has delivered time and time again

[07:00] Quality machines based on themes you want

[07:04] Year after year after year

[07:05] Right, year after year after year

[07:07] I mean look, I think Stern could put more in their games

[07:11] But Stern does not have to put more in their games

[07:14] Because the other pinball companies out there can't get games in boxes fast enough for you

[07:20] So I can't blame them from a business standpoint

[07:24] For giving you enough of a great or really good pinball experience

[07:29] That makes you want to buy it

[07:31] And there's been so many Stern releases over the last few years

[07:35] Which you have bought site unseen

[07:37] Right, without even playing it

[07:39] Their games have sold out

[07:41] And I just see this anger

[07:44] And I see this sort of Stern slamming

[07:47] And piling on Stern

[07:49] That is really driven by

[07:51] It's so weird to me

[07:52] It's like driven by these people

[07:54] That I don't get what their goal is

[07:57] And it doesn't matter because Stern will be successful in this venture

[08:01] I fully anticipate Stern will not take a beating on this title

[08:07] And here's why

[08:08] They won't make 1964 Beatles pinball machines

[08:13] If there isn't demand for it

[08:15] That is what they are saying will be the total number they will make

[08:19] But if that's not the orders they get

[08:22] They don't have to sell all these on day one sold out

[08:26] And that's another thing

[08:28] It's like they can keep Beatles pinball machines as options for buyers

[08:33] For as many years as they want to

[08:36] People might say the license might run out

[08:38] That's not, I think they'll be fine

[08:40] I think Jonas had to ink these deals

[08:43] And it's not going to sell out the way

[08:49] Let's see, Iron Maiden Ellie sold out for you guys

[08:51] It's not going to sell out the way Star Wars Ellie sold out

[08:55] Or Ghostbusters Ellie or Batman 66

[08:58] But this game wasn't designed for you guys on Pinside

[09:02] And that just seems to be really hard for people to understand that

[09:07] And it scares me that people can't see that

[09:09] It really does

[09:10] It's like why can't people just step back a little bit

[09:15] And remove themselves a little bit from this release and say

[09:20] You know what was Stern going for here?

[09:22] And if you don't like it cool

[09:23] Like I'm all four people being like I don't like it

[09:26] I think it's ugly

[09:26] I think it's stupid

[09:28] You are so entitled to that opinion

[09:31] And you are entitled to share that opinion

[09:33] And you are entitled to put that opinion on Pinside

[09:38] And repeat it time and time again

[09:40] But the problem with Pinside

[09:43] And what scares me about that site

[09:45] Is that site's own inability

[09:49] To understand how small of a portion

[09:54] And a percentage they are of the actual Pimball buying community

[10:00] They really like to think that it's like

[10:03] 90% of people who buy Pimball machines are on Pinside

[10:06] And it's like the opposite

[10:08] It's like maybe 10% of all games sold globally by Stern Pimball

[10:15] Is on Pinside every day talking and complaining or praising games

[10:21] Right?

[10:22] The hyper users, the actual people who spend every day posting

[10:26] And commenting is such a small percentage

[10:29] But they would have you believe it's the opposite

[10:33] And I've never seen a community with such a false sense

[10:37] Of entitlement and power and control

[10:41] That they think they have

[10:43] Over what will make a Pimball company succeed or fail

[10:46] Like I think Pinside actually believes

[10:49] If they complain loud enough

[10:51] That Stern will suffer somehow

[10:54] And I just don't think that's the case

[10:56] And a good example of how Pinsiders and the hyper users

[11:02] You know they have this like self-important sort of approach to all of this

[11:07] Is the threat about my distributor

[11:10] You know how bad is Beatles selling

[11:13] And it's based on a focus group of just a few people

[11:16] Who are saying the game must be selling horribly

[11:20] Because I got a call from my distributor that was you know asking me

[11:24] If I was interested in the Beatles

[11:26] And my distributor never called me around Batman or Iron Maiden

[11:30] And those games did great

[11:31] So this must mean that sales are piss poor

[11:34] And I don't think that is the case

[11:37] I don't think that's what that's indicative of

[11:39] I think this is probably simply just Stern

[11:45] If they're going with that model of distributors have to sell like 10 to get the nicer colt you know

[11:51] Premium or sorry platinum or diamond editions

[11:54] They might just be going to their long-term customers

[11:57] Who have bought a lot from them in the past and asked them

[12:00] Hey it's Beatles for you

[12:01] Is that a crime?

[12:03] Is it why see when I see people complain about that

[12:06] When I see people look at that as a negative

[12:09] And as a sign of horrible things to come

[12:12] I really just feel like Stern can't win with these babies

[12:15] And it's just it's ridiculous to me

[12:17] It's like so what

[12:19] If a distributor called you up

[12:21] And asked you if you might be interested in the Beatles

[12:24] So what

[12:25] And if you're not

[12:26] Cool you have a good distributor

[12:28] I wish my distributor would call me up and ask me if I'm interested in games when they're revealed

[12:34] And in fact my distributor does do that

[12:36] And he's a great guy and it's coin taker

[12:38] And Chris and

[12:40] Chris and Melissa are amazing

[12:42] And I do I think they're one of the best out there

[12:44] But we talk all the time about what's coming out

[12:47] If I might be interested this and that

[12:50] You know and it's like a lot of you

[12:51] It's like you're always on the fence with these games

[12:53] If you have a

[12:54] If you know your distributor on a first name basis

[12:57] And you have your distributor cell phone number in your phone

[13:00] There's a good chance you and him go back and forth

[13:03] Whenever there's a new reveal to see if you're interested or not

[13:06] You know and so

[13:08] It's at the point now where I really think everyone needs to just relax a little bit

[13:14] If you don't want Beatles life will go on

[13:17] If you're not interested in Beatles life will go on

[13:21] Stern as a company does not deserve to be like so crucified for this game

[13:28] Because I don't think you really know what went on behind the scenes

[13:32] And I also think Stern is about to give you the monsters

[13:35] They're about to give you so many more titles

[13:38] El Vira

[13:39] You know the list goes on and on

[13:41] They're going to give you an original Steve Richie game coming up

[13:44] So how is Stern ever really seen as the bad guys in the hobby

[13:50] Okay, how are they the bad guys

[13:52] Right if any other manufacturer

[13:55] Sorry, I mean if Stern did

[13:57] What any other manufacturer out there did

[14:01] They would be crucified and burned at the stake

[14:06] If Stern revealed pirates of if pirates the Caribbean

[14:10] If Stern revealed a game at Expo and said it was going to ship by TPS

[14:15] And then a year went by and the game didn't even ship

[14:19] Would you would you really let them get away with that

[14:22] If Stern revealed a game with the art package that looked like October fest

[14:26] Would you let them get away with that

[14:28] If Stern launched a game like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[14:33] With that kind of shot geometry

[14:35] Would you let them get away with that

[14:37] And you know any any of the other companies out there

[14:41] You know if you put their game with a Stern logo on it

[14:46] You guys would be kicking and screaming

[14:49] With the exception of pirates of the Caribbean

[14:51] And like I've said before

[14:53] Jack's issues are never about the games themselves

[14:56] It's about the themes of the games that he chooses to make

[14:59] And it's how long he makes people wait

[15:02] Where Stern keeps getting you games month after month after month

[15:07] Right and I think there's just something to be said for that

[15:10] So hopefully hopefully we will reach a point

[15:14] Where people will actually play the Beatles

[15:17] Make up their mind decide if they want one or not

[15:20] And if they don't just move on

[15:23] It's just not worth your time

[15:25] I mean I see the battles the fights

[15:27] Why would you if you don't like this game

[15:30] Go into a thread to just argue about it

[15:34] And constantly shit on it

[15:37] And believe me

[15:38] This is coming from me

[15:40] And I used to do that on Pinside

[15:43] I was banned from Pinside for that behavior

[15:47] And I empathize with the people that behave this way

[15:50] Because I understand what forums do to people

[15:54] They make people go nuts

[15:58] They make you be negative more than positive

[16:03] Because you get caught up in this mob mentality

[16:07] And you act like we've been wronged

[16:09] And we're going to grab the pitch forks

[16:11] And let's Stern know about it

[16:12] And let me tell you something

[16:14] Stern doesn't give a shit or read Pinside

[16:16] About all of your moaning and groaning

[16:18] In fact I'm pretty sure

[16:20] The people at Stern make fun of

[16:23] The people on Pinside who never stop

[16:25] Bitching and moaning and crying about their games

[16:29] Right? Ask Iceman

[16:32] How many Stern Pimbal machines he owns

[16:34] I think he owns quite a few

[16:36] So what's the problem Ice?

[16:37] Just don't buy it if you don't want it

[16:40] Do you really have to go on a crusade against it

[16:44] It's just it's just weird to me

[16:46] I mean on this show

[16:48] The companies that I've gone on crusades against

[16:51] They were companies that I believe deserved

[16:55] To be under attack

[16:58] I did believe that Andrew Highway was going to screw you people over

[17:03] I do believe that Barry and Yop were lying the whole time

[17:06] I do believe that the reboot of highway

[17:10] Was going to be another failure

[17:11] I do believe

[17:13] You know that like we always really go directly after

[17:18] The people that I think deserve it

[17:21] Right and again I'll say this though

[17:24] Too much negativity, too much hate, too much complaining

[17:28] It sucks the fun out of the hobby

[17:31] It does

[17:32] You know I literally I think people need to learn not to be that way

[17:36] So talking about sucking the fun out of the hobby

[17:39] I mean I literally covered monkey business

[17:41] On the last podcast and I told you where I stood on this

[17:44] That I just felt like

[17:46] You know this is something that was was was a stupid thing to do

[17:51] It doesn't like make me feel like American pinballs a bunch of like sexist

[17:57] They're they're removing it

[17:58] And I just feel like

[18:00] Yeah it was it was it was a joke and bad taste

[18:04] But I wasn't like extremely offended

[18:06] And I think they're doing the right thing by taking it off

[18:09] Okay

[18:09] So their Facebook page around this topic has just blown up

[18:16] I mean it literally has pulled people from every end of the spectrum

[18:21] To chime in and discuss this

[18:24] And the problem again with social media

[18:27] This is the same problem with Pinside

[18:29] With Iceman tell George Gomez to his face that he thinks Gomez is an idiot

[18:34] And it doesn't know how to launch a pinball game

[18:36] Would any of them say that the George Gomez is face

[18:38] Absolutely not

[18:40] You know with with levy and hilton

[18:42] Be you know

[18:44] Beating each other over the head the way they are

[18:46] If they were in the same room together

[18:48] Absolutely not

[18:49] And this is the problem with like social media

[18:52] It's the problem with forums

[18:54] Is it really like brings out the worst in people

[18:57] And because you're not saying stuff to people's faces

[19:00] There's one thing that's always missing

[19:03] And I work in communications

[19:04] And and this is why I always hate

[19:07] A presenting even over the phone right

[19:09] Even being able to hear people's tone on the phone

[19:12] I think so much is lost in life

[19:15] When you're trying to have a conversation with someone about something

[19:18] You feel strongly about

[19:20] You can't see the person

[19:21] You can't read their body language

[19:24] You don't know how they're reacting to what you're saying

[19:28] And so that leads to a lot of perceived insensitivity

[19:34] When you're talking to someone about a topic like

[19:37] Like sexism

[19:39] And racism

[19:41] And sexual harassment

[19:42] I mean people are talking about rape on this thread

[19:46] And it turned into some of the most heated debates

[19:51] People are having in society

[19:53] Rapped up around a pinball back glass

[19:58] And that to me is a problem

[20:02] Like pinball should never be the catalyst

[20:05] To even begin having such serious discussions or topics or debates

[20:10] And you know, because again, like I just

[20:12] I think it invites people to behave a little trollish

[20:15] I think it invites people to say extreme things

[20:18] And I think everyone then is just trying to say something that gets a reaction

[20:23] Because that's social media

[20:24] I mean if you think about Pinside and Facebook

[20:27] They both are engineered to get reactions from people

[20:32] People on Pinside are addicted to getting a thumbs up or a thumbs down

[20:37] You know, and I remember being on that site

[20:39] You post something, you go back to it

[20:41] You want to see who thumbs up, who thumbs down

[20:44] And then you look at the people who thumbs down

[20:46] And you, and they become your enemies

[20:48] And then all of a sudden you start to create

[20:50] Civil wars within topics based upon whether or not someone liked your comment or not

[20:56] That is not the way real life works

[20:58] It's not the way talking to people in person works

[21:02] But it's the way social media works

[21:03] And so this monkey business thing really spiraled into this position where

[21:08] You know, we had people on there

[21:10] We have men, we have women

[21:12] We have them debating what their feelings were around this backlash

[21:18] And you know, it's a hard thing for me to see

[21:21] Like such extreme behavior taking place

[21:25] Because personally, this is just my personal opinion

[21:29] I just don't think people should have used that moment

[21:35] As a moment to have some of the conversations they were having

[21:38] For example, if a female pinball player in a league

[21:43] Has been sexually assaulted or harassed

[21:46] At a tournament or at a pinball event

[21:49] That is serious

[21:51] Like that is nothing to be laughed at

[21:53] Like that is not tolerable in this hobby

[21:56] Nor should that be tolerated anywhere

[22:00] Right, whether it's that

[22:01] I mean, I've seen it happen like at Comic-Con

[22:03] Like people are like either groping or you know

[22:07] Guys know what they're doing

[22:09] When they want to do something that is crossing the line

[22:12] Like I think they are fully aware of when they're in the wrong

[22:17] And so again, a cartoon monkey

[22:21] Touching two women on a backlash

[22:25] Is now sparking a conversation around assault

[22:29] And it was leading to like conversations around like rape even

[22:32] And it's just again, it's just like

[22:35] It's a monkey on a backlash

[22:37] Yes, it is creepy as fuck that some like white old dude

[22:41] Probably made that decision

[22:43] And you know, here's the difference between let's say Elvira

[22:47] And this monkey

[22:48] Because when we get Elvira, right?

[22:50] When we get Elvira

[22:52] There are going to be lots of boobs on that game

[22:55] Elvira's whole thing is that

[22:57] She sells sex

[22:59] She sells it

[23:00] She sells her sexy image to the world

[23:03] And that is her stick

[23:04] But here's the difference

[23:06] That's her decision

[23:08] To sell her body

[23:10] Her image

[23:11] You know, she is the willing participant

[23:16] In that behavior

[23:18] Okay

[23:19] You are not a willing participant

[23:23] If a monkey is grabbing your butt

[23:25] And again, it's not that's not

[23:27] That's see again

[23:28] It's like we're going between like real world and fictional world

[23:31] But the thing is

[23:32] It's just like

[23:34] It wasn't like this is a woman's decision

[23:38] To showcase an act in which women

[23:41] Are being groped by a monkey

[23:44] And I think that's the big difference

[23:45] Because I think what people confuse like sexism and pimp ball

[23:50] Is basically

[23:51] If you go up to Elvira

[23:53] And you see Elvira looking all sexy

[23:55] Looking all provocative

[23:56] And that's Elvira's like whole thing

[23:59] You can't look at that

[24:00] And be like

[24:01] Well that's sexism

[24:02] That's objectifying women

[24:05] I don't think you can look at it and say that

[24:07] Now as a woman

[24:08] You might look at Elvira and think she's offensive

[24:10] That's totally

[24:12] That's totally fair for you to feel that way

[24:15] But I don't think you can criticize

[24:18] Elvira pimp ball as being a sexist pin

[24:20] Again because she's a woman and she can make a decision on how she wants to represent

[24:25] Her character

[24:26] But if you look at some of the older pimp ball games

[24:29] In which there's like women in like overly sexualized positions

[24:33] And you know

[24:35] Can you look at that and say

[24:38] Well that's sexist

[24:39] Because that's that's like some guy who's an artist

[24:42] Who's drawing women in very like sexually

[24:46] You know, provocative men

[24:48] Or just just for the amusement of men

[24:51] And women who play the games find that offensive

[24:53] Right, you can make that argument

[24:55] Okay

[24:56] So here's the thing

[24:57] The last five minutes or so of this podcast

[25:00] I like never want to have again

[25:03] Because again, I just think that this is not a hobby

[25:08] Where we should be having all of this debate

[25:11] I don't I just don't think there's a pimp ball form

[25:15] Or there's a pimp ball environment

[25:18] In which this debate will ever be healthy

[25:20] I think everyone just needs to like stop overreacting to this stuff

[25:26] And treat each other with respect

[25:28] All right, count if you just treat everybody with respect at shows

[25:33] If you treat everybody with respect when you make your machine

[25:36] You know, everything will be okay

[25:39] Like it's a fucking pimp ball machine

[25:41] Like this isn't like a political figure we elected into office

[25:45] It's a pimp ball machine

[25:46] And if you're disgusted by it, don't buy it

[25:49] The other hard part for me as a marketer as I look at pimp ball

[25:54] Is you know, I saw a lot of angry women on the thread

[25:58] Like really, really angry at this

[26:01] And saying that pimp ball needs to turn a corner

[26:05] That there's lots of women who buy pimp ball machines now

[26:07] And this needs to stop and stuff like this can no longer be tolerated

[26:12] You know, look, look

[26:14] Pimp ball is still predominantly male driven

[26:19] And if pimp ball if female pimp ball players become a decent segment

[26:25] Of the pimp ball buying community

[26:28] Then absolutely there's a market for companies to cater machines

[26:33] You know, that are more in line with their interests

[26:36] Or what they're looking for in a pimp ball game

[26:38] Look, I think like it again, like 95% of pimp ball machines are not seen as offensive by anybody

[26:44] Again, there's just those few machines that like woe nnelli is a good example

[26:48] Like woe nnelli is a machine that is fully targeting men

[26:53] It's fully objectifying women

[26:55] And I can see how woe nnelli was totally offensive for women to look at that machine

[27:00] But do I believe that they should not have made woe nnelli

[27:06] Because it might offend some people

[27:09] And I'm here to tell you like no like freedom of speech, freedom of expression

[27:16] You know, I protect that more than just always trying to make everything

[27:23] To at the point where like nobody's offended

[27:25] Like do you really want to live in a world where art can't offend somebody

[27:30] Right and and it goes both ways it goes both ways

[27:34] I mean there there are certain things that you know those female pimp ball players might like and things that they might consider

[27:41] You know awesome that might be offensive to other people

[27:44] And I just I look I think at the end of the day

[27:47] You should be allowed to put out whatever creative expression you want within certain boundaries of course

[27:54] Right? I'm I'm not like yeah, yeah, you could have like a pedophile like no

[27:59] You can't there are certain things that just should never be like represented like in Pimball machines

[28:04] But I just think that

[28:07] woe nnelli sales

[28:09] Will either indicate to stern

[28:12] That it was a good idea or bad idea

[28:15] But I don't think we should take away the right of a pimp ball person

[28:21] To buy a game like woe nnelli or to even even have a game like woe nnelli in existence

[28:28] Again, it's a creative expression

[28:30] It's yeah, it's presenting women in a way that's very like overly sexualized and in a very male driven

[28:40] hobby like this

[28:42] You know that might be effective

[28:44] You know and look again, this is just like I think there's a very very strong charge to overly politically correct everything

[28:54] You know, it's like Carl's juniors like they you guys have seen the ads

[28:58] They they use like women and bikinis to sell you cheeseburgers and like is it effective?

[29:03] Isn't not effective?

[29:05] Should they be allowed to do that?

[29:07] Are the women who are in those ads?

[29:09] Are they mad that they got the acting gig to do that commercial and should they be allowed?

[29:14] Should they be allowed if you know to use

[29:18] Their physical beauty to to get jobs and to sell things if that's what they want right again

[29:24] There's the other side of the coin you know, it's like I showed the monkey on on the translate to some women

[29:30] I knew and they were like I don't really that whatever like it's funny like they weren't offended by it

[29:36] You know, but I can totally see how certain people would be fully offended by it. So

[29:42] So look

[29:43] Do you see where I'm getting at what scares me is we're going down these slippery slopes with a lot of these pinball conversations and once you go open up Pandora's box

[29:53] It there's no stopping it. There's no stopping it and I think ultimately

[29:59] You know, I would say let people put out whatever they want if you don't like it don't buy it

[30:06] You and you are fully free to voice your opinion and you're

[30:10] Distain for what people put out there

[30:13] But I don't want to take away people's right to put out whatever they want creatively. I don't I think we need to stand up

[30:21] For people's creative expression above all else

[30:25] Because one day the tables will turn and the creative expressions that we need to liberate us

[30:32] From oppressive things

[30:34] might not be you know

[30:36] allowed to exist because we fought so hard to

[30:40] Shut down things

[30:41] A prematurely or without giving people you know the freedom of expression

[30:46] Does that make sense am I making any sense again like I feel like I'm talking about all the wrong things and that pinball

[30:51] Let's turn it back to pinball. So what else am I scared about

[30:55] um look

[30:57] In terms of pinball, I'm scared that stern has said that beetles

[31:01] Is already collectible when they describe the messaging they said that the platinum and diamond editions were

[31:10] certifiably collectible certifiable collectible and

[31:15] What what what how can you certify something as being collectible

[31:20] You know, I don't know if they're taking the piss out of people, but

[31:24] Simply certifying something is collectible is kind of like almost saying it's not collectible

[31:30] I mean, it's really weird. It's like when jack calls something a collector's edition. It's not a collector's edition

[31:36] Right, it's a collector's edition if we say it's a collector's edition

[31:40] Um, it's not a limited edition. Well, no, that's the difference

[31:45] Limited by definition just means you're only making a certain number

[31:50] So everything that has a limit to what they're what they'll make is

[31:56] Accurate but a collector's edition is implying that this is the version and the edition collectors will want and we know

[32:06] That dialed in is not a collector's desirable

[32:10] We know that pire to the Caribbean collector's edition

[32:14] Won't be collected. Okay, it may be bought by richy wrench

[32:20] But there aren't 250 people that want to shell out 20

[32:24] 12,500 hours prematurely because it's been titled a collectible ready all right

[32:29] All right, so that scares me that we're starting to use ridiculous phrasing with some of these games all right

[32:37] I'll tell you what doesn't scare me

[32:39] How freaking awesome monster bash remake seems to be

[32:43] I keep hearing more and more great things about this game if you haven't already

[32:48] I would go watch the Halloween special of Greg and Zach on straight down the middle

[32:53] They do a great walkthrough and review of monster bash remake. It's absolutely terrific

[33:00] Uh, it was my best look at this new game since I didn't see it at expo

[33:04] And I'm starting to believe the rumors that the L.E.s are selling like hotcakes again

[33:10] I don't think they're sold out I Google searched monster bash remake L.E. and I still found

[33:15] Them for sale at different distributors 12,500

[33:21] 12,000 500

[33:23] 1250 limited editions is still a lot like that's a lot

[33:28] At what 8,000 dollars a game like that's a lot of money

[33:35] And that's a lot of games that have to be sold to completely sell out

[33:41] But it seems like the value is there um, you know, it scares me also

[33:46] It scares me that I was reading people on pinstead say that the monster's code is is gonna be better than monster bash's code

[33:54] They're already people are already saying without a doubt

[33:58] It's just gonna be a better game because it's gonna have deeper code

[34:02] And I just think it's absolutely ridiculous that we're already saying that Dwight is going to code the you know

[34:11] Monsters better than

[34:14] Monster bash monster bash is monster bash is a classic is one of the greatest pinball machines of all time

[34:21] Because it is the perfect

[34:25] Blending of all the things we deem important in pinball

[34:29] It has great shots and none of them are tight you're not breaking shots

[34:34] It has great artwork on everything except for maybe the playfield you could argue needs a little work

[34:39] But where the playfield artwork I think is overcome is because your eyes are on all those fun mechanisms and toys and lights and and things going on on the playfield

[34:51] It is a world under glass like no other. It's got amazing lights. It's got amazing callouts. It's got amazing music

[34:59] It's got understandable code when I listen to people say you know

[35:03] Monster bash has no depth because because you know what to do and you can get to it and you can beat the game

[35:11] And then you have to start over

[35:13] You know this whole notion that a game is only great if there's all these

[35:18] Unobtainable things that are buried deep in the games code is absolutely ridiculous. Okay, absolutely ridiculous

[35:27] You know whatever I've jailed all the villains and Batman. I've jailed minor villains and Batman

[35:34] Will I ever be able? Will I ever be good enough to jail all the major villains and all the minor villains in all of their

[35:44] Individual seasons at once during one game to maybe unlock some crazy final wizard mode in Batman

[35:52] Never I will never be able to do that and neither will 99% of you not like like five people on planet earth got to Valor

[36:02] On Lord the Rings and yet for some stupid reason

[36:07] people hold

[36:08] You know those impossible to get to journeys as like a rationale for keeping the game like you're gonna keep chipping away

[36:17] Even though you'll never get there the fact that you can keep hoping to get there means the game is better

[36:23] It's so weird to me

[36:25] You know and monster bash code takes like such a beating from people and it's not

[36:30] It's not bad at all. It's Lyman Sheets like rook you know when he's rookie titles

[36:36] But he look you only need to know one thing. There's a reason why Lyman Sheets owns a monster bash and he has it in his house

[36:45] He's coded many games. He doesn't have every game. He's coded in his house

[36:49] He's still considers

[36:51] Monster bash to be one of the most fun

[36:54] Pinball machines ever and I think you do too

[36:58] If you would just stop thinking that depth equals fun, right?

[37:04] You know look it's like

[37:06] Pirates of the Caribbean versus monster bash like which one is more fun

[37:12] Which one is more approachable?

[37:14] Which one has more magical stuff going on on the play field?

[37:18] You know which one brings the theme to life better?

[37:22] You know all these things I would say like

[37:25] probably in like 75% of the category

[37:29] Monster bash is just a better pinball game and that's my opinion

[37:34] But again, I just think it's like it's such a you like like people said you will flip monster bash

[37:40] And you will and something will happen you'll figure something out intuitively

[37:45] The moment you plunge the game that's what pinball supposed to be I literally

[37:50] I still have people play Pirates of the Caribbean and they've no idea what they're doing all right

[37:55] so

[37:56] Look

[37:58] I think that doesn't scare me how good monster bash remake is and I think it's it's really cool

[38:04] How awesomeness title is and I think the concept of them doing something similar

[38:09] With cactus canyon and with theater of magic and with big bang bar

[38:14] I mean, you know imagine those three games with the improved display and the nicer armor and the nicer like

[38:21] Topper and like full RGB LED displays, right? Imagine those games

[38:27] With just those right amount of modern touches

[38:30] And I think this company

[38:32] This is the one company that I think Stern is probably most afraid of I really do

[38:37] I have to say that you know between monster bash and monsters are people gonna buy both

[38:43] And which one is gonna be the one that like dominates the monster category all right

[38:49] All right, what else scares me in pinball right now

[38:52] I'm scared that deeproot doesn't realize how few months are left between now and tpf

[38:59] Um, I'm just scared that they said too much. I am I mean

[39:04] I'm really cheering for these guys to deliver what they said they're gonna deliver

[39:09] I also will not crucify them if they don't deliver all of that

[39:15] You know, I think they sort of oversold a lot of what they need to do in 2019 to establish themselves as a real player in the pinball world

[39:25] They don't need to make more games and every manufacturer has ever released in a year

[39:30] Like no one's asked for that. They don't need like

[39:34] The cheapest games ever like collectors and pinball buyers aren't asking for that

[39:39] And and what people want right they don't want cheap pinball

[39:44] They don't want like

[39:46] Tons of pinball. They just want a magical game like they really just want a fun game

[39:53] Where there's a world under glass where the ball does magical things where the code is fun

[39:59] Where the lights shows are fun where the callettes are cool where the arts nicely guys

[40:03] They just want simple things as they go on to list like 15 things that everyone demands in every single game or else the game gets crucified

[40:09] But you just need to make one great game

[40:11] Like American pinball is in the same boat

[40:15] Jersey Jack was in the same boat you need to make one great game that establishes what you're capable of

[40:22] Right that is why the hobbit is selling words selling because

[40:29] Coming off of the wizard of Oz where Jack put everything in the kitchen sink in the pinball and there was all that excitement because of all the

[40:35] innovation

[40:37] You know the hobbit felt like a step backwards for them right

[40:41] And so like that's why it's crazy that you can go get a hobbit for $6,000. It's just mind boggling

[40:47] That you can get a hobbit for that cheap

[40:49] And they're gonna keep going down because people are gonna like

[40:52] Free up hobbits to get pirates. It's it's weird and and then it's gonna go down even more

[40:56] Because people are gonna free up hobbits and pirates to get willy walker and toy story, you know and guns and roses so

[41:03] Kind of crazy that jacks games

[41:07] Aren't staying at a higher price point and and and you know, I don't know why I don't know why like it

[41:14] I think that is the ultimate indicator that

[41:17] They sort of missed the mark on these titles a little bit right

[41:21] All right, what else scares me? I'm scared

[41:23] I'm scared that there's pre-order dollars happening for October Fest right now and people don't know what the final game is

[41:30] That scares me

[41:31] It scares me that once again most people are not playing a pinball machine before they're being asked to commit to buy

[41:37] I think we've all reached a period now where

[41:40] Everyone should jump on a machine before they decide to buy it or not

[41:44] And I've learned this too every single le you know the only reason to buy before seeing it is you might be afraid that it's gonna sell out

[41:52] But I've seen every single le

[41:56] Or s le you name the machine it is always come up for sale

[42:02] Uh at one point or another

[42:04] So if you had just waited you would still be able to get it every you know they all come up for sale

[42:10] And if you just don't

[42:12] Fall victim to the fear of missing out during that initial reveal window

[42:17] You're gonna be just fine and chances are you'll be better off

[42:21] You know, I looked out waiting a year. I got Batman a year after it came out and I looked out for two reasons one

[42:30] I was able to get better code immediately and two I was able to protect my playfield

[42:36] And prevent all the crappy dimpling that happens on stern playfields

[42:40] With a playfield protector all right

[42:43] All right, so that scares me. I'm scared that

[42:45] American pinball

[42:47] Is not going to make enough changes that people are looking for that I think the display

[42:56] And the animations and some of those things

[42:59] You know if they're looking to get the game

[43:01] Out the door in

[43:04] January

[43:05] I I think there's a lot of work to be done and I'm not and I'm scared that they don't have the talent in house

[43:13] to

[43:14] Raise

[43:15] The caliber of this game to where it needs to be to compete

[43:19] With other titles that are in the same price point when we see the monsters and we see the animations on that game

[43:27] We are going to say do I buy monsters or do I buy october fest or do I buy monster bash remake

[43:35] Or do I buy Alice Cooper or do I buy pirate to the Caribbean right? It's crazy. It is crazy the amount of options we have all right

[43:43] All right

[43:45] What else scares me going on in the pinball world right now?

[43:50] I am scared that they're going to make primus pinball

[43:54] I don't really want a primus pinball, but I also think it's going to be one of these where like the band commission them to make the machine

[44:01] I think it's going to come from stern. I think it's going to have

[44:04] zombie Eddie artwork

[44:06] I'm scared that

[44:09] People out there think primus is deserve it of a pinball machine. They're they're an opening act. Bubba are you a primus fan?

[44:17] Is that what that reaction was?

[44:19] What's the big deal buddy? Maybe Bubba is a primus fan and I just upset him

[44:24] What else am I scared about? I mean, you know, I'm scared that Jersey Jack

[44:29] Is not going to get to all these great games that we know are on the docket

[44:34] And I'm scared that one day sorry guys this New York City on Halloween you're going to get sirens and everything

[44:40] I'm scared that one day

[44:42] Jack's billionaire investor is just going to wake up and be tired of losing all this money and and that that scares me because

[44:51] I really want Jack and company to hit it out of the park and it does feel like he's got three mega titles

[45:00] Around the corner in toy story guns and roses and

[45:05] Willie Wonka

[45:07] But I'm scared because if pirates isn't where it needs to be

[45:11] You really have to wonder at what point does this guy just say enough already

[45:18] Enough because with a factory that size and only have like

[45:24] X number of games going out the door a day or being made a day

[45:28] You know jack scaled up

[45:31] But then he hasn't been able to get manufacturing where it needs to be and he also again like I also think he just made a lot of mistakes

[45:40] In terms of the themes he selected with these games

[45:45] I you know Jersey Jack should be the company where people are the games are sold out overnight

[45:51] immediately

[45:52] Like if Jersey Jack even just said back to the future where only making like 650 LEs

[46:00] You know they should make like 880 LEs to you know symbolic to the 88 miles an hour whatever, you know

[46:06] He would be fine

[46:08] He would be fine, but no like pirates of the Caribbean nobody wants that theme. I'm just scared

[46:16] That they have people internally over there that green lit a theme like that

[46:22] I literally I just can't I get that you guys

[46:27] Who like it like it I just what that's what scares me is that they don't have the marketing

[46:35] Know how

[46:36] To realize a bad theme and it is a bad theme. There's no if-ands or butts about it

[46:42] I mean Disney just booted Johnny Depp from the franchise and you're releasing a machine with his grill all over it

[46:49] I mean come on even Disney doesn't want him anymore and thinks the theme needs a refresh and now you're coming out with the outdated version of the theme all right

[46:58] All right, what scares me at spooky pinball

[47:01] Pretty much everything

[47:04] No, I mean look what scares me about spooky is is is basically

[47:10] That they won't

[47:12] Put someone else in the design chair instead of Chuck my biggest fear my biggest fear and what scares me is that

[47:21] Chuck wants to be known as I feel like he wants to be known as as a as a pinball designer

[47:28] And I think his talents are actually elsewhere in the organization and I think he needs to be

[47:35] The Gary Stern of the company and manage the day-to-day operations of spooky pinball

[47:41] But I think it's time that he gives up the reins of design and actually lets people who are better at it

[47:50] Take the helm and I know that's hard to do

[47:53] Because he's a pinball fan and he likes pinball and he wants to do things different

[47:58] But spooky has yet to design a game that feels like

[48:04] It's it's again. It's on the level. It needs to be

[48:08] To be competitive in terms of gameplay with these modern games

[48:13] You know, I just saw that

[48:14] Someone is trying to sell another Alice Cooper spot for six hundred dollars. They're trying to sell

[48:21] A spot which is a four hundred dollar savings and it's it's game number like one hundred and fourteen

[48:27] Which means you can get your game way ahead of

[48:30] People near the end of the line and guess what the spot it's still for sale

[48:37] And it's bad time with everyone probably waiting to see monsters and with monster bash being so cheap for just the you know the standard edition

[48:46] All right, what else scares me in pinball

[48:49] You know, I'm scared that

[48:52] No one is ever gonna get their big Lebowskis. I'm scared that everyone who's in on that is going to still hope for the best

[49:01] But I'm scared that it's over and we haven't heard anything from them

[49:06] The last we heard was unfortunately

[49:08] Yop was was battling a medical condition

[49:12] But I'm scared that this is just over

[49:14] But I'm also scared people are never gonna get closure. I think it's important

[49:19] Every once in a while for

[49:21] People to do the right thing and that's call it quits and and actually say it's over like we're done

[49:30] We are at a business

[49:32] These games will no longer be made

[49:35] We will explore selling the design and to another manufacturer to make those games

[49:41] But I think if you paid money to Dutch pinball you will never see a game

[49:47] And I think that sucks and and I and I hate that

[49:52] I'm scared

[49:54] Um one of my biggest fears and and I was saying this to a friend the other day

[49:58] I think one of the things that I'm scared about the most is that people's expectations

[50:03] Of pinball machines are the lowest I think they've ever been

[50:08] And I think what people expect for the money is the lowest it's ever been in pinball

[50:15] You know, and I'm scared that we're gonna keep averaging down these machines

[50:21] To the point where

[50:23] You're really not even getting half of what you're paying for

[50:27] And what I mean by that is

[50:30] I think we're starting I'm starting to look at like $9,000 machines

[50:34] And feel like they look like they're $4,500 machines to me

[50:40] And and I'm scared that

[50:42] Because everyone else around stern can't get their act together

[50:46] That we're just gonna keep seeing sort of like

[50:50] You know

[50:51] Halfway creative efforts

[50:54] Because it's all they're gonna need to sell pinball right so I'm I'm scared about that

[50:59] I mean again like guys these aren't like these aren't like real fears or things that are I'm truly terrified about in life

[51:05] And I I'd say this you know a little bit with some

[51:08] Wink and a nod but you know these are things that I'm I'm scared about in the pinball hobby

[51:15] I'm scared that some of you on pinside are addicted I am I think that there are people on the forum

[51:22] Who need to just stop and I'm scared that some of you have made pinball

[51:29] Such a big part of your life that it has to have a roaded away

[51:35] Other more meaningful areas of your life and I don't know most of you personally

[51:40] I don't know your dynamic with your significant other or your children or you know your your free time

[51:48] But I do know that there's no way that some of you out there can spend this much time

[51:56] Thinking about pinball talking about pinball arguing about pinball getting all like heated and stressed out about pinball

[52:03] And I I don't know how you can do that without it negatively

[52:08] impacting other areas of your life that you should probably invest more time in

[52:14] And I'm scared that people let this hobby take over way too much of your time

[52:20] You let this hobby take over way too much of your money

[52:24] And you let this hobby take over way too much of your priorities

[52:29] And and we all we all struggle with this. I mean life is a tug-of-war between work and play

[52:36] It really that's the way it is for me and when your work is your play you're absolutely winning at life

[52:43] You know Keith L one is feeling great Steve Bowden is feeling great

[52:47] You know the pinball designers out there they feel great they get to go in every day and do something they love

[52:52] Most of you guys on pinstripe like be honest like are you really doing what you love

[52:58] Because it sort of feels like you're on there because you just want an outlet to yell at people or to be angry about something

[53:07] And you're sort of using this as a you know

[53:10] It's almost like you buy a pinball machine and now I have my ticket where I can go online and yell about stuff

[53:16] And insult people because I've got a machine and and this is what we do and and I think it's

[53:21] It's it's time that a lot of people just reevaluate like how

[53:26] Invest it emotionally and how much time do you want to invest and to the point where like

[53:32] You're you're becoming like obsessed right and I get accused of that

[53:38] You know people accused me like whoa. Well, look at you. You have a podcast. Well. Yeah. I mean I invest

[53:43] I invest the amount of time that I can to this right and and I will never ever

[53:52] Sacrifice like taking Brenda out for dinners or taking vacations or doing other things that I enjoy

[53:59] Because of pinball right I will you will never see me traveling the world

[54:04] Because of pinball, you know

[54:06] I will not seek out pinball when I'm in a new city

[54:10] All right, I will seek out the culture of that city. You know why

[54:13] Because it's the same fucking monster bash boys. It's the same fucking games

[54:19] Half of these guys like rodo Dave they got they own the fucking machines you can go to Paris and play pinball

[54:26] Come on. I won't be that guy again. I'm not like if you are obsessed. It's okay like again live life on your terms

[54:33] I'm just scared that some people

[54:35] Let it take over their lives too much. All right

[54:39] What else am I scared about?

[54:41] I'm scared of the

[54:44] Font that's being used on this week in pinball's website

[54:48] I I'm scared they need to change that font. I don't think you could find another website on planet earth that uses like

[54:57] Comic Sans font on a website throughout so I'm scared about that Jeff. Come on change the font

[55:02] Make it more mobile friendly, all right

[55:05] Yeah, oh

[55:07] Jeff, you know, I love you brother, but you should not it so Jeff Jeff and I had a little like spat a few weeks ago and I'll tell you why

[55:16] Because he texted me asking if I would feel bad that

[55:22] Something happened to a pinball artist because I leaked images of that artist's work

[55:28] I did not put that artist's images anywhere

[55:31] If people share them that I shared with that was a dumb mistake on my part

[55:35] But I I'm not responsible for anyone getting fired and nobody did get fired and nobody is

[55:42] Is you know on the chopping block

[55:44] But what upset me was I was on my way to dinner with Brenda and I get this text that's just like makes me feel shitty and it's like

[55:53] That's where pinball to me again

[55:55] And I know you guys can relate to this when pinball like infiltrates your evening

[56:01] Your life your job

[56:04] To the point where like the stresses of this hobby or people in it are bringing you down or like arguing with you or making you feel bad

[56:14] It's like to me. It's just like that's when it's like well, fuck this like it's not worth it

[56:19] Like I'm not following pinball to you know to have it then come back at me and rune my day

[56:28] It's a fucking toy

[56:31] You know and look I don't hold it against Jeff. I don't hold it against you know a lot of the guys out there that are like

[56:37] hyper into the hobby

[56:39] But I'm just saying there's like

[56:41] There's a part of all of us and for you who listen to this show you can relate to this

[56:45] There's a part of all of us that is like the pinball part of our personalities right

[56:51] Like we all share a common interest in something that we love and that is awesome

[56:56] And that is why hobbies are awesome and that is why having side hustles and side interests are awesome

[57:03] But there's also a completely other side to us

[57:08] That none of my pinball friends really know too much about and they can't they can't possibly be expected to know all of those things

[57:18] Like they're not going to know if I have like family problems or issues or like

[57:23] You know health concerns or all these things

[57:25] I don't go to the doctor and then tell everyone on my pinball circle like what the doctor found

[57:31] You know, it's not like that

[57:34] But so that's why like you know

[57:36] I think sometimes when we have pinball friends and we're connected we just always assume that

[57:43] We always want to be talking about pinball at all times and you know sometimes that's the case and sometimes you just catch your

[57:51] Your pinball friends in a bad moment and the last thing they want to fucking talk about is how disappointed you are

[57:58] In the Beatles pricing and they're like Jesus man. Just get a fucking life like nobody cares like why you give

[58:05] Two fucks about a game. You're not even gonna buy like shut the fuck up already

[58:11] Like don't you ever feel that way at times?

[58:13] And you probably feel that way after you listen to this podcast you're like canada you fucking hypocrite like stop

[58:20] You're the fucking you're the problem two man to shut up

[58:23] And you're probably right but for some reason you keep listening to this podcast

[58:28] Maybe we're all just addicted and doomed to an eternity of

[58:33] Over-emphasizing pinball in our lives and we'll all be buried

[58:38] Inside cabinets of total nuclear annihilation one day. I don't know. I really don't know

[58:44] All right, well everyone. I'm at the hour point. I try not to go over an hour

[58:49] We haven't heard from me in a few days. That's partially because Brenda is traveling

[58:54] With the computer that I usually do this show with I have some good news

[59:00] Ben Heck is going to be a guest on the show. I might talk to him tomorrow

[59:05] It might be over the weekend again because Brenda has the computer that I used to interview people

[59:10] But Ben Heckendorn

[59:13] Always love having Ben on the show very outspoken very animated very passionate guy. He will be joining the show

[59:21] He told me he will and and I say that because I've had other people say they're going to come on the show

[59:27] And then all of a sudden they don't even want to come on the show

[59:30] I've been telling normal over at American pinball

[59:34] Like dude

[59:36] It's a mistake to tell me you're going to come on the show and then just not come on the show

[59:41] Like what good does it do American pinball to not come on here and talk about their game?

[59:47] I mean

[59:48] You guys know me like don't leave the only messaging around your game to be from canada's mouth like that is not

[59:56] The smartest marketing move for a guy that's in charge of sales and marketing of the game

[01:00:02] We would have a good talk. I mean, I really want to talk to him too about like the monkey business

[01:00:07] I want to talk to him about like

[01:00:08] You know

[01:00:09] How that decision came about like what they're what they what their feelings are

[01:00:14] You know with the response people have given them

[01:00:16] I want to talk about the changes they're going to make. I that's really what I want to talk about is what are the changes

[01:00:21] We're going to see as we get to production of a

[01:00:24] Octoberfest all right all right everyone have a very very happy Halloween stay safe

[01:00:30] Eat some candy you know

[01:00:33] Enjoy your pinball machines and everybody everybody. I think everyone should do this

[01:00:39] I think what would help all the craziness around the moaning the complaining the bickering

[01:00:43] I don't know about you guys, but I get really really cranky in life when I stop

[01:00:51] Exercising right I get cranky when I feel like I'm not taking care of myself and I'm not taking care of my health

[01:01:00] I think everybody should adopt the following behavior in life

[01:01:06] You should mirror the amount of days you go to the gym with the amount of days you log on the pin side

[01:01:14] All right, if people did that right

[01:01:17] So if you went to the gym that day you can log on the pin side if people did that

[01:01:22] Can you imagine what the pinball community would look like a year from now like crazy levy

[01:01:29] um oric and

[01:01:32] Hilton and iceman they would look like jacked mother fuckers a year from now

[01:01:37] They would look like it would be like a bodybuilding competition when we went to you know tpf or xbo

[01:01:43] You know, I think that is a great way or resolution for you guys to do next year or anytime

[01:01:51] Starting tomorrow just go to the gym for every day you want to be on pin side

[01:01:57] And I think you'll be much happier and you'll stop giving two shits

[01:02:02] That's turned made of pinball machine that you're not gonna buy and you're not gonna shut up about it until they sell out of it

[01:02:09] Everyone that's episode 277 have a great day email me at canada pinball at gmail.com
