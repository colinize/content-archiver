[00:00] I said woman take it slow and work it out for fire.

[00:07] Oh, it is just a little patient.

[00:14] Welcome to episode 389 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:23] I hope all of you guys are having a great weekend.

[00:27] And the weather is hopefully beautiful where you are at.

[00:31] In New York this weekend it's been incredible.

[00:34] Had the demon out, had the type R out.

[00:37] I played a bunch of pinball this weekend.

[00:39] Sometimes you just turn your games on and you enjoy them.

[00:43] All of the issues and all the bickering and the moaning and groaning that we see on

[00:48] the online forums.

[00:49] It just dissipates and you can enjoy these games for what they are.

[00:53] And I have to say, I still think Batman 66 is one of the

[00:57] greatest pinball games ever.

[01:00] The different ways you can approach that game are so much fun.

[01:04] And I don't care what anybody says.

[01:07] This game lives and dies by the code and the theme integration that is happening throughout

[01:12] the game.

[01:13] Lime and Sheets is a genius.

[01:15] The way in which he incorporated all of the clips from the show seamlessly into the gameplay

[01:21] experience where it never feels like it's a stop and go game.

[01:25] You still feel like you have enough time to look up.

[01:28] Enjoy a quick clip from the show and you're in the action constantly on the play field.

[01:34] It's what I wish Willie Wonka would have been.

[01:36] Alright, here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:39] We're going to talk about a few topics that I've seen that I thought were interesting

[01:43] to discuss.

[01:45] We will of course talk a little bit again about the play field chipping issue which will

[01:49] not go away.

[01:50] I've got some emails from people that I want to read that are trying to get to the bottom

[01:55] of this.

[01:56] I was speaking to Jeff at this week in pinball.

[01:58] He also is reaching out to pinball manufacturers and play field manufacturers about this topic

[02:06] to varying or I think very limiting degrees of success.

[02:11] And we'll talk about that.

[02:12] I also have a response from Robert Mueller over at Deeproot and his reaction to the play

[02:19] field issue that is happening right now.

[02:21] We also have a new newsletter from Dutch pinball which is what they do best when they're

[02:27] not making games.

[02:28] They're making more promises via newsletters to people and every time they do it people

[02:33] believe it at face value.

[02:35] We'll talk about that.

[02:37] What else is going on?

[02:38] Well let's start off by saying I just watched a video that I thought was amazing and it

[02:43] actually I think we need some more sort of good vibes.

[02:47] Any more good vibes in this community right now and in this hobby right now.

[02:52] There are definitely issues that are dragging a lot of people's enjoyment down.

[02:57] But if you go on to YouTube and watch Greg Bones unboxing of his Jurassic Park pinball

[03:05] machine it is probably one of the greatest 10 minutes of pinball enthusiasm captured on

[03:13] film.

[03:14] I did it was so hysterical.

[03:16] So if you're down and out and you want to get your hopes and your spirits and your vibes

[03:21] back up in pinball I would go check out Greg Bones Jurassic Park unboxing on YouTube.

[03:28] Zach over at Flip and Out delivered the game and it's just it's just an awesome video.

[03:31] I don't want to spoil it but go check it out.

[03:33] Alright so I saw this thread before we get into the play field issues and I wanted to

[03:37] discuss something.

[03:38] I saw this very interesting thread where the topic was.

[03:42] Why are new Stern L.E.'s with such low plays going for so cheap.

[03:48] I think it's a great question.

[03:50] If you've been following this hobby and you've been following the new unbox sort of craze

[03:55] that's taken over pinball in the last few years the whole notion of a limited edition game.

[04:02] There are the highest price versions of games.

[04:06] Stern pinball right now is charging you $9,000 for their limited edition games.

[04:11] Jersey Jack pinball anywhere between $9,000 and $12,500.

[04:17] Now if you've noticed these L.E.'s they typically seem to lose value pretty quickly right

[04:24] now.

[04:25] I'm seeing L.E.'s in for going for $7,500 within the first six months of buying the

[04:32] game.

[04:33] So whether it's Black Knight or the Munsters what else has been recent Iron Maiden, Star Wars,

[04:41] those Busters remember the Ghost Busters hype when that happened.

[04:45] Why do I think that Stern L.E.'s with low plays are going for so cheap?

[04:51] There's a few reasons why.

[04:53] It's not just Stern.

[04:54] Let me state that.

[04:55] I see so many L.E.'s over at Jersey Jack pinball also sliding very quickly down from $9,000

[05:04] to $7,500.

[05:05] Now first and foremost I think the easiest conclusion to make is that we're oversaturated.

[05:11] But there are so many games and so many products out there that for a game to hold its value,

[05:18] it has to have a few things.

[05:22] It has to be a dream theme that you don't want to let go.

[05:25] So there has to be some of that.

[05:27] But then you got like Ghost Busters dream theme.

[05:29] So why do we see a lot of Ghost Busters L.E.'s trading hands?

[05:33] Well the game also has to be great.

[05:35] If the game is great and it's based on a good theme, then I think you're going to see

[05:39] less and less of those L.E.'s being given up for sale.

[05:44] And if they do sell, they will hold their value pretty nicely.

[05:48] You know when you look at like a walking dead L.E. that's in good condition.

[05:52] Still selling for a good amount of money.

[05:55] A Tron L.E. right?

[05:57] One of the last true L.E.'s of Stern still going for a nice pretty penny.

[06:03] Now I think the main reason why though, over time, we're seeing the price of L.E.'s

[06:09] erode pretty quickly.

[06:11] A few reasons.

[06:12] I think that there's nothing truly special about these L.E.'s.

[06:17] I think a lot of us have woken up to the reality that so much of the L.E. package is just

[06:23] cosmetic, right?

[06:24] It's cosmetic differences.

[06:26] The gameplay is exactly the same as the premium.

[06:30] And without any real differences in gameplay, I think you have to sort of somewhat be a

[06:37] little bit of a vanity collector to want to spend that extra amount of money.

[06:43] And you know, look, the last game, the last game in which Stern actually put a gameplay

[06:49] difference into the limited edition game was Tron L.E.

[06:54] And that's a big reason why Tron L.E.'s command is such a premium and kept their value

[07:01] for so long.

[07:02] It's got the daft punk multi-ball that only the L.E. has.

[07:07] It also had the fiber optic ramps that worked with the coding of the L.E. and we didn't

[07:13] see that in the pro version of the game.

[07:17] And so I think none of these games are really limited.

[07:21] And none of them have a limited gameplay experience.

[07:26] And because of that, I do think that L.E.s lose price pretty quickly.

[07:31] Now, there's something else that's just a little dark secret in this hobby that I want

[07:35] to talk about.

[07:36] Do you know that a lot of people do get to buy their L.E.s from their distributors for

[07:41] far less than $9,000?

[07:44] They're not supposed to sell it to people for less than $9,000.

[07:48] They're starting to have a minimum on what the distributors can sell the game at.

[07:53] But I know for a fact that there are many people out there, many collectors who get their

[08:00] L.E.s at street price, which is much closer to $8,000 or $7,500 out the door.

[08:08] I would think it's more like $8,000.

[08:10] So when these guys are buying them, you might think they're buying a $9,000 pin, but they're

[08:16] really not.

[08:17] They're only spending $8,000.

[08:20] So when they go to sell it used for $7,700, they're not really losing that much money on

[08:25] it.

[08:26] So to you, the outside observer, it looks like well, this game just took a $1,500 hit.

[08:31] But in reality, it might have only taken a $500 hit for what these people got the game

[08:36] for.

[08:37] I think it sucks that some people get a wholesale pricing.

[08:41] But for them to get that pricing, I think those people buy a lot of games from distributors.

[08:46] And distributors are breaking Stern's little policy about setting the lowest you can sell

[08:52] the game for.

[08:54] Now, what else is going on?

[08:56] So I think I was saying to you that when it comes to L.E.s, when you think about the people

[09:01] who buy L.E.s, they oftentimes run after the latest and the greatest.

[09:06] Like the shiny new game that everyone is talking about that has all of the hype.

[09:11] Now the problem in Pimball is this.

[09:13] If you chase after that kind of excitement and you want to be the guy on the block that's

[09:18] got the first Jurassic Park L.E., you will always, always be most excited about what's next,

[09:28] not what you currently have.

[09:30] Because once you have that L.E., sort of that fear of missing out, this weird sort of anxiety

[09:37] to grab an L.E. and get it before they're no longer available.

[09:41] But then you realize once you do get it and you unbox it and you play it, it's just

[09:46] another Pimball game and you probably will get bored of that game and you will be excited

[09:53] about what's next.

[09:54] Like we already hear people saying like what's going to be El Vira and what's going to be

[09:58] Deeproot and what's going to be, you know, the next game from Chicago Gaming Company,

[10:03] what's going to be the third title from American Pimball.

[10:06] And I think a lot of L.E. guys, you know, they quickly realize they, the game they have

[10:11] is, is not hard to get.

[10:13] That's the other part too is I've noticed that there are almost no L.E.s out there that

[10:18] are impossible to get for around sticker price anymore.

[10:22] The days of, you know, Ghostbusters being sold out immediately and Iron Maiden moving

[10:27] very quickly, I'm seeing a lot of pause and a slowing down of the inability to get

[10:33] these games.

[10:34] Like you can still go get a Jurassic Park on eBay for MSRP right now.

[10:39] Like it's not impossible to get.

[10:41] And I think once these collectors realize that it starts to slow down that, that sort

[10:45] of need to buy it now.

[10:47] The other thing is this, if word to be completely honest, none of these are really L.E.s.

[10:52] Like right, you got a limited edition machine.

[10:54] That's the exact same machine as the premium.

[10:58] The whole use of the word limited edition is a little bit of marketing spin, right?

[11:03] Jack's making 5,000 Willy Wonka's limited.

[11:08] How is that limited?

[11:09] I mean 5,000 alone, it would make it one of the best selling Pimball machines in the

[11:15] last 15 years.

[11:17] And so yet he's making that the limited number, a little silly, right?

[11:22] So I think the thing is this, the only real limited edition games right now are games like

[11:28] the big Lebowski, Alien, the Matrix Pimball, Predator, Wrath of Olympus.

[11:36] Those are truly limited games, Magic Girl.

[11:40] When there's only a finite amount of those games, King Kong, Kingpin, Big Bang Bar, when

[11:48] you can just say there's only 200 of these or 80 of these or 40 of these or 25 of these

[11:54] in the world or 5 Matrix is in the world, then you truly have something limited and special.

[11:59] But I think these cosmetic limited games are not really that special.

[12:06] But it's an interesting question.

[12:08] I guess I would put a bow on this topic and just say this.

[12:13] If you want a limited edition version of a new Pimball machine, I would just wait.

[12:19] All of these games come up for sale and they become home-use only games that are taken

[12:25] very good care of by collectors.

[12:28] And you can just save yourself a lot of money and go get one for like $7,000 to $7,500

[12:35] and that's a much, much better price to pay than $9,000.

[12:39] And I'm just surprised that more of these games aren't depreciating faster than they

[12:44] even currently do in Pimball, all right?

[12:47] So good to always a good time to be a Pimball buyer nowadays, not the best time to be a Pimball

[12:53] seller nowadays in the Pimball world.

[12:56] All right.

[12:57] So let's move on to everyone's favorite topic, the chipping of playfields, the lifting of

[13:04] clear code, the desire by this Pimball podcast to get some answers from playfield manufacturers

[13:12] and manufacturers themselves on what will be the solution to this game.

[13:16] Now since I've started doing a few podcasts around this, I've had a lot more people share

[13:22] photos of recent unboxings of Jurassic Park's end of Willy Wonka's in which we are seeing

[13:30] the issue happen across both of those games.

[13:34] The starpost are sinking into the clear code.

[13:38] Putting washers underneath the starpost does not help.

[13:43] There are so many photos out there of Jurassic Park's with washers and the clear is still

[13:50] pushing aside and puddling and lifting up the clear code in the game.

[13:56] And so we have a serious issue here.

[13:57] We have a serious issue that is not going to go away if we stop talking about it.

[14:02] We have a serious issue that a lot of other Pimball podcasts and websites will be talking

[14:07] about and are talking about it.

[14:09] Like I don't own this topic exclusively.

[14:11] I don't even like talking about this topic very much because if you read Pinside lately,

[14:17] this topic is starting to spoil and infiltrate every single thread about Jurassic Park and

[14:24] Willy Wonka and Pirate to the Caribbean.

[14:27] And so nobody wants that.

[14:29] Nobody wants to buy these expensive games and have these issues and have the focus be

[14:35] of around the Playfield clear code.

[14:37] We want to buy these games and we want to talk about how fun the layout is, like how

[14:41] awesome Keith L. Wins design of Jurassic Park is, how the amazing animations are in Jurassic

[14:47] Park.

[14:48] We want to talk about Willy Wonka and Pat Lawler's design and all the cool stuff that's

[14:53] going on in that game.

[14:55] And yet we're focused on the clear code and we're focused on non-injoyable aspects of

[15:02] the game.

[15:03] And but you can't blame us, right?

[15:05] You can't blame people for talking about it because at the price point of these games,

[15:10] it is just flat out unacceptable.

[15:13] There is no other way to look at this topic other than to say, this is unacceptable.

[15:18] And the response from the manufacturers or lack thereof is also unacceptable.

[15:25] And the more I think about it, offering people an opportunity to buy a spare Playfield for

[15:31] $500 when you ship them something that's defective, that is also 100% unacceptable.

[15:40] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[15:42] I mean, Jersey Jack will sell people another Pirates Playfield in which the problem hasn't

[15:48] been solved and they're going to charge people $500 for that solve.

[15:53] See that's where I have a huge issue with all of this.

[15:56] And that is why this issue is bigger than it seems.

[15:59] It might look like a little crack and a chip and some lifted artwork, but the cost of

[16:04] solve this problem, not just moving forward, but the cost to make right all of the customers

[16:11] that have experiences and been burned is so much more expensive than anyone even wants

[16:17] to start to figure out.

[16:19] And I think the solves that are going on now are pretty pissed poor.

[16:23] They are putting Band-Aid on a bullet wound.

[16:25] I mean, the washers are not a solve.

[16:27] And yet, what do we see now?

[16:28] Stern throwing washers into all the Jurassic Parks.

[16:31] Well, that's not a solve.

[16:33] You know, buying another Playfield that will have the same issue.

[16:37] That's not a solve, especially because we talk about this all the time.

[16:40] No one's going to do a Playfield Swap or knows how to do it even.

[16:43] So I think this is something that I know Jeff is trying to get to the bottom of.

[16:48] I've been unsuccessful in getting Mirko to give me a response on this topic.

[16:53] I really can't wait to hear from these two companies because, look, Stern and JJP,

[16:58] two of the biggest companies in Pimball, this is affecting their sales.

[17:03] There's no way around it and they're going to have to respond to us, the customer,

[17:08] with an official response.

[17:11] And I think, you know, we've seen this in the past where there's like an acceptable,

[17:17] they sort of see some of the Playfield wear as acceptable elements of Pimball.

[17:22] And you know, I've seen them send people clear coat, touch up when artwork is lifted.

[17:27] And the debate rages on is like, what's causing it?

[17:31] Is it the ink that's not adhering to the wood that's causing it to lift?

[17:35] I don't think it can't just be that because the clear coat is just too soft.

[17:40] And is the ink causing that?

[17:42] I don't know.

[17:43] But all I know is I see those post sinking in and I see the damage and we need to have

[17:50] some sort of pause happening here until they figure this out.

[17:54] Now here's the other part.

[17:56] If you think this is like universally affecting everybody, it's not.

[18:01] There is a source of this issue, but look at Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, over at

[18:07] Spooky Pimball.

[18:09] Charlie just uploaded a photo of their first prototype game that has had probably thousands

[18:15] and thousands of games played on it.

[18:18] And everything looks perfect in terms of like the clear coat and the post.

[18:22] There's no puddling, there's no chipping, there's no art lifting.

[18:27] And so you know, what's the deal?

[18:30] Why are spooky games fine and not having this issue?

[18:33] And that's why it's like, it's not just the artwork because I mean, there is no artwork

[18:38] around those things.

[18:39] So maybe it has something to do with that.

[18:41] But what I've not seen any of this clear coat issue on October Fest or Houdini.

[18:47] So American Pimball, whoever's making their play fields, I'm not seeing the problem pop

[18:51] up.

[18:52] I'm really only seeing this on Stern and Jersey Jack games.

[18:57] And so whatever Chuck is doing, he's doing it right.

[19:01] And I'm not seeing this on Chicago gaming company games.

[19:05] So there's just some, there is a source of this problem.

[19:08] And I think once we get to the source of it, this problem can be solved.

[19:12] But until that happens, until that happens, how are you not really nervous about buying

[19:19] a Jersey Jack or a Stern game right now with this issue?

[19:23] I would wait.

[19:25] What harm does waiting have?

[19:27] Right?

[19:28] I just saw too that Richie wrench.

[19:30] And I'm trying to get Richie on the show tonight.

[19:33] Richie wrench who buys every collector's edition of Jersey Jack games.

[19:37] He announced that he is on, he is canceling his Willy Wonka collector's edition because

[19:44] of this issue.

[19:45] And if that's not a great example of the impact that this issue is having on the hobby, I don't

[19:51] know what is.

[19:53] So hopefully I can talk to Richie tonight about why he's doing that and what this means,

[19:58] right?

[19:59] To all of you out there.

[20:00] I think all of you out there have to be nervous because of all the money that's on the line

[20:04] with this topic.

[20:05] All right?

[20:06] Okay.

[20:07] So let me read to you, Robert Mueller's response to this.

[20:11] He sent me a note and I do love Robert.

[20:14] I mean, he goes right at it and he doesn't hold back and we know that Deeproot is about

[20:20] to show us what they've got in November.

[20:22] Now, here's Robert's statement.

[20:24] I'm going to read it word for word to you right now.

[20:28] And I asked him, I'm like, Robert, what's your point of view or how do you feel about

[20:34] all these play field issues?

[20:36] Because I do think this is a golden opportunity for Deeproot Pimball.

[20:41] If they have manufactured their games to not have these issues, whoever can say, hey,

[20:47] you're never going to experience this with my company is going to have a leg up in the

[20:52] Pimball buying, sorry, in Pimball marketplace moving forward this year.

[20:56] Okay.

[20:57] So here's what Robert says.

[20:58] He says, in my personal opinion, as a purchaser of Pimball machines and what I personally

[21:05] experienced as the principal of a Pimball company, craters, pits, dimples, ghosting puddles,

[21:13] cracking, or other similar flaws by a standard weight Pimball or attached hardware to the surface

[21:19] of a play field, whether in the course of play or not is a known and preventable material

[21:26] defect in the engineering and manufacturing process.

[21:31] We know historically that these flaws were rare.

[21:35] I have 20 to 30 year old machines that have little to no visible signs of play field damage

[21:40] after thousands of plays.

[21:43] We also know that over time there can be some degradation of the protective coatings that

[21:50] should not be present on newly manufactured machines.

[21:54] While variations and tolerances inherent in the manufacturing process are expected, they

[22:01] should be rare and nominal.

[22:03] Thus, it is expected that a very small percentage of play fields would statistically exhibit

[22:10] some or all of these flaws.

[22:13] However, every manufacturer that I have purchased a game from since 2015 and every modern game

[22:21] I have played on location also almost uniformly exhibits some of these flaws.

[22:29] And Stern, J.J.P. and Spooky have all benefited from thousands of dollars of my personal money

[22:37] in return for poorly designed play field surfaces.

[22:41] It is my personal opinion that these companies either intentionally or negligently refused

[22:48] or failed to adequately engineer and manufacture play field surfaces and coatings to prevent

[22:54] and statistically minimize these known and preventable conditions.

[22:59] I personally reject any statement from any other pinball company to the contrary.

[23:05] I will hold myself and my pinball company to the very same standard I expect from these

[23:11] other companies, Robert J.Mueller, principal, deep root family of companies.

[23:17] Wow.

[23:18] There you go.

[23:19] Robert is basically saying that there is a chance that these flaws can happen in a few

[23:26] games but it should not be universal and he spent a lot of money on these companies and

[23:32] he holds his company to a higher standard than what he is seeing on these games.

[23:37] Again, more raising of the expectations and the bar for what we expect to see from deep

[23:43] root.

[23:44] But I'd rather have a guy tell me that I'm not going to experience that with his games and

[23:50] he thinks this is unacceptable because you know what I haven't heard?

[23:54] I haven't heard anyone from Stern or Jersey Jack come out and tell us that this is unacceptable.

[24:00] I have it.

[24:01] I mean, Spooky showed us that they had some issues with TNA but they fixed those issues and

[24:05] we're not seeing those issues on Alice Cooper.

[24:08] The thing that I just can't shake and this is just me.

[24:11] I can't shake.

[24:12] I mean, I wake up at night and I'm shaking.

[24:13] But I just, I really can't shake this one thing.

[24:16] How could Jersey Jack, after seeing this issue with pirates of the Caribbean, how could they

[24:24] not fix the problem before they started ordering Willy Wonka playfields?

[24:30] I don't understand that.

[24:32] Like they knew firsthand they had a serious issue and they just didn't do anything.

[24:39] They didn't solve the problem.

[24:41] They continue to place an order with a manufacturer of playfields and we're seeing the same exact

[24:48] issue on the Willy Wonka machines.

[24:51] And when I see something like that, it's hard not to feel like somebody is asleep at the

[24:56] wheel over there.

[24:58] Somebody needs to be accountable for that kind of decision and I'm worried.

[25:03] I'm worried that the investors over at Jersey Jack one day are just going to wake up and be

[25:07] like, screw this.

[25:08] Like we're done.

[25:09] It's going to cost us how much to fix this problem now.

[25:13] But this is the issue.

[25:14] When you don't solve the problem that you know is going to be a huge issue for you, you

[25:20] can't cut corners here.

[25:21] You can't try and pass off the defect onto the customer.

[25:25] They're paying too much for these premium pinball games and I just feel like Jersey Jack

[25:31] took one step forward and now is going to have to take two steps back with the solutions

[25:37] for this thing.

[25:38] It's going to end up costing them way more in the long run to fix all these problematic

[25:43] games than it would have been to just delay Willy Wonka until this problem was solved.

[25:51] And I know all of us wanted Jersey Jack to move faster into production, but if this is

[25:57] what the outcome is in which they're not going to fix an issue that they know about just

[26:01] to keep the assembly line running, then I think we're in for a big, big problem with

[26:08] this company.

[26:09] I think Stern will be able to nip this in the butt more.

[26:12] I think Stern is going to realize, well, look, we know that these are, I think these

[26:17] are coming from Mirko.

[26:18] I really do.

[26:19] I think Mirko is the source of this issue and I think they're doing like the water-based

[26:23] clears and it's just not working right and whatever process they're doing is not working

[26:27] very well.

[26:28] I think Stern is going to cancel ordering playfields if they get any made from Mirko and they're

[26:34] going to have to figure out a new solution.

[26:36] But Jersey Jack, it seems to be affecting them more because I think all of their playfields

[26:40] are coming from Mirko right now.

[26:43] All right.

[26:44] Well, look, this topic is going to rage on and on and on and you're going to hear more

[26:47] and more about this and I can't wait to hear what George Gomez says, what Zach Sharp says,

[26:53] what Jersey Jack says.

[26:55] And look, for you guys wanting an answer, just know that Jack is on vacation right now.

[26:59] It is August.

[27:01] Give them some time.

[27:02] That's the other part.

[27:03] I mean, we're, I'm reaching out, sorry, hello, something in my throat.

[27:07] I'm reaching out for these guys to give us a response.

[27:10] They're going to have to respond.

[27:12] You understand that.

[27:13] Like they're not going to be able to brush this under the carpet and just sort of go one

[27:18] by one with, with effected machines because there's too many machines affected.

[27:24] And if we get enough voices saying, hey, like I'm going to cancel my order, they're going

[27:29] to start hearing from distributors, hey, you need to say something or customers are going

[27:33] to like start to like, you know, evaporate unless you communicate something.

[27:38] And I'll say this, this is what part of my job is for a living in the world of public relations.

[27:44] Issues and crisis are, is a huge part of what my company does.

[27:48] And I think these pinball companies are pretty ill equipped when it comes to communicating

[27:53] through a crisis.

[27:54] They all sort of seem to go like radio silent and just make you wonder like what's, you

[27:59] know, what, what, what do I do?

[28:01] Like you feel helpless because the company sort of like just cuts you loose and tells

[28:05] you nothing.

[28:06] Now, speaking of a company that tells you nothing and cuts you loose, Dutch pinball, a

[28:13] company famous for going months if not years with very little communication to its customer

[28:20] base.

[28:21] I'm seeing some of the big Lebowski's being unboxed.

[28:26] Interesting to follow these threads.

[28:27] I mean, there's like not many games, right?

[28:29] I think only 20 or so, so far have, have, have been delivered not even that many.

[28:35] So you're going to see just a handful of people have the game, you know, you're not going

[28:40] to see the normal number of unboxings.

[28:43] But I, I do see people are having some issues with the games.

[28:47] And that is just always going to be the journey of owning this game with like very little

[28:52] support.

[28:53] I also saw some of the photos of the parts of the big Lebowski, but let me do this first.

[28:58] Let me read you Dutch pinball's August update and then give you my take on this whole thing

[29:05] because I think if there's one thing Dutch pinball does very well.

[29:08] The best thing this company's ever been able to manufacture over the years, they've been

[29:14] able to manufacture hope.

[29:16] And they always find new ways to keep hope alive for these early achievers.

[29:20] And here we go once again, more of their, you know, selling you on like the optimistic

[29:26] future they see for this company.

[29:28] And I think people are beyond, beyond being patient with these guys.

[29:33] And I find there to be very little hope in this thing ever materializing.

[29:37] But here we go.

[29:38] It says news Dutch pinball August update restarting business and extended universal

[29:45] pictures license.

[29:47] In the last update, I informed you on the settlement I've reached with our former manufacturer.

[29:53] And two weeks ago, we managed to complete the settlement.

[29:57] This means that the lawsuit is off the table and all games and parts that are in their warehouse

[30:03] are now ours and also fully paid for.

[30:08] With this first round of financing, we are now ready to getting things set up again to

[30:13] build games.

[30:14] I'm very happy with the trust of coin taker and some of my very close friends and family

[30:19] who made this possible.

[30:21] All right, let me stop there because I want to deconstruct this like paragraph by paragraph.

[30:25] So they're fully paid now for those 40 games and for all of those parts, which later

[30:32] on he will go on to say how many games they can make with those parts, which is really

[30:36] interesting.

[30:37] Remember that fact that they collected half a million dollars from coin taker to buy

[30:44] those 40 games if you do the math.

[30:46] So that's interesting that that didn't just buy those 40 games.

[30:50] It also bought all of the parts.

[30:52] Now he goes on to say, due to the holiday of three weeks at ARA, we had limited access

[30:59] to their warehouse.

[31:01] But fortunately, we managed to get the games out and some parts we needed to finish them.

[31:07] That's interesting right there.

[31:08] I'll stop there.

[31:09] Part and they weren't all finished.

[31:11] I'll go on.

[31:12] Last week, the first games were shipped.

[31:14] The rest of the games are now ready as well and will be shipped this week.

[31:19] I know it's a bittersweet moment, but it's also the start of a new beginning.

[31:24] We can truly focus on the future.

[31:27] All right, let me stop there.

[31:29] Another new beginning.

[31:31] How many new beginnings will this company have?

[31:34] It always ceases to amaze me that Dutch pinball is now what?

[31:39] On like the fifth or sixth or seventh attempt at a new beginning with this company.

[31:44] And all right, we're going to, I'm going to give reading this and then I'm going to

[31:47] give you my, I just, I can't, I can't.

[31:49] This language is just, it's unbelievable.

[31:51] He goes on to say, on Monday next week, the holiday will be over.

[31:56] And then we can start with the transport of all the parts.

[32:00] We are already checking the list of parts and taking stock of how many parts we have

[32:06] to build games.

[32:08] Some parts are there.

[32:09] Get ready for this for 200 plus games, but some parts were bought lean.

[32:15] And this means that we also have to order new parts as we progress.

[32:19] Okay, so let me stop there.

[32:21] So they have some parts for 200 games, but other parts they don't and they have to order.

[32:26] Now I know this from talking to different manufacturers ordering parts for a pinball

[32:31] machine, especially a specific part that's tailored to that game.

[32:36] Usually takes four to six months, right, to get those parts manufactured and in and ready

[32:42] to put on a line to manufacture four to six months.

[32:46] So at the earliest, you're looking at sometime in like 20, 20 like Q one, 2020 in which those

[32:53] parts would be available.

[32:56] Now the other question if you haven't asked this, where does the money come from to order

[33:01] those parts?

[33:03] We don't know 200 of what?

[33:04] Like Barry could be sitting on 200 screws and posts.

[33:08] That's all that he has 200 of those for games, but does he have 200 bowling alleys?

[33:12] Does he have 200 rug mechanisms?

[33:14] Does he have 200, he doesn't have any cabinets, no cabinets.

[33:20] And those are as Ben Hex said, very expensive, a cabinet to $1,000 often to make a cabinet.

[33:25] So it sounds good, but when you start to read between the lines of these statements, it

[33:32] sounds really like you're still on the same, you know, the house is still on fire, the

[33:39] dumpster is still burning.

[33:40] You know, the solution's not there.

[33:43] Like it's always like this spin, but let me go on to read more.

[33:47] He says, and the next week we will be busy preparing everything for production, arranging

[33:53] our production facility, counting parts, putting all the parts in our inventory system, checking

[33:59] the assembly instructions, sorting out the tools needed, et cetera, we will start small

[34:05] and we will expand over time to build more games.

[34:10] We have a couple of locations in mind where we want to restart our business.

[34:15] We will have to decide which location is best and we hope to get this figured out this

[34:20] or next week.

[34:22] Alright, so once the whole company's got to start up again, we've got, you know, this

[34:27] sounds very eerily familiar to Andrew Highway, doesn't it?

[34:31] It was always about finding a new location, getting all the parts we need, getting the assembly

[34:38] line up and running again.

[34:40] It's 2019 people.

[34:42] Such pinball first showed you the big Lebowski in 2014, five years later and we are getting

[34:51] communication that they need to restart the company again.

[34:55] Now again, where do you, people are forgetting one thing.

[34:58] These gentlemen collect it like two million dollars, like what's 200 times $8,500?

[35:06] Where is all that money?

[35:08] Barry, where did the money go?

[35:10] But why have we stopped asking this question?

[35:13] Where did the money go?

[35:15] Where did it go?

[35:16] Did, did, ARA like burn through a million plus bucks that was unforeseen or did they spend

[35:22] the money?

[35:23] Did they give themselves salaries?

[35:25] Where is the money going to come from to, to restart this company to find who's going

[35:29] to, okay, here's a good question, who's going to pay the rent on this new facility location

[35:34] in which they're going to make these games?

[35:35] Who's going to pay to hire new workers?

[35:37] Who's going to pay to order those parts?

[35:39] Who's going to pay the salaries to train these people?

[35:42] Where does all that money come from?

[35:44] For it to happen, he's either going to need to get outside investor dollars or he's

[35:49] going to have to pre-order these machines.

[35:51] Are you really, and these, here's a crazy part, these machines have already been sold.

[35:56] They've all already been sold.

[35:58] All 200 early achiever additions were already paid for in fall.

[36:02] And so you're going to have to go in and buy again, someone else is, you're going to

[36:06] have to buy someone else's machine that hasn't even been assembled yet and it's going

[36:10] to be sold again twice.

[36:13] Think about that.

[36:14] It's going to be sold twice.

[36:16] This is insanity people, insanity.

[36:19] This does not sound like new beginnings.

[36:21] It sounds like a bunch of, a hogwash.

[36:24] Okay, he goes on to say, another thing I want to inform you about is something I get

[36:28] a lot of questions about, the license from universal pictures.

[36:32] I'm happy to report that we have extended the license for now.

[36:36] It is extended until December 31, 2020.

[36:40] All right, another, wait, I don't think extending the license is hard.

[36:44] I don't think universal cares or has taken much interest.

[36:49] I think it's kind of insane that their property has been dragged down with this company and

[36:56] that they would extend them the license, but all they care about is the money.

[37:00] At this point, it's probably just a simple financial transaction and I bet some of these

[37:05] people who bought the coin-taker games, that money went to extending that license.

[37:10] All right, he then says, I will keep you informed how things are progressing the coming weeks.

[37:15] If you have any questions, please let me know.

[37:17] You can always email or call me kind regards, Barry.

[37:20] PS, here are some photos of the parts in storage.

[37:24] It's going to take a while to sort this out.

[37:26] My God, when you look at this photo of just like boxes upon boxes upon boxes, you've got

[37:35] you know, some, you got these wooden crates with, it's like when one says bowling alley,

[37:41] it's just all the bowling alley mechs like thrown in it.

[37:43] It looks like there's a couple cabinets.

[37:45] Then there's a huge stack of big Lebowski cardboard boxes that looks like there's over

[37:51] like a couple hundred of them there.

[37:53] It's going to take a while to sort this thing out.

[37:56] Ain't that the truth?

[37:58] Ain't that the truth?

[38:00] So here we are, 2019 in August.

[38:04] And remember, remember how many years ago was it?

[38:06] It was exactly three years ago in August when they started lying about the board issues,

[38:12] three years ago.

[38:14] And here we are, restarting this company again.

[38:17] I don't know what else to tell you people other than, I just, I don't think it's ever

[38:23] going to happen.

[38:24] I don't think it's going to work out.

[38:26] The math doesn't work out.

[38:28] It's common sense.

[38:29] They need Ponzi scheme economics to bail this company out.

[38:33] They don't deserve another shot at this.

[38:37] They should declare bankruptcy and let somebody else build the game.

[38:43] Give up the dream, Barry.

[38:45] It's over.

[38:46] You don't get four to five chances to make a company work.

[38:51] You've had your shot.

[38:53] You burn through everyone's money.

[38:55] You spent everyone's money.

[38:58] He keeps saying, email me questions.

[39:00] Okay, Barry, one question.

[39:02] Where did the money go?

[39:04] Where did the money go?

[39:06] You collected almost two million dollars of people's money and barely got only like 37

[39:13] people got the game they paid for.

[39:15] You then resold other people's games to new buyers.

[39:19] Where did the money go, Lebowski?

[39:21] Why doesn't he answer us that question?

[39:24] That is the thing that this karma is going to come back to bite them.

[39:28] It is not going to work out.

[39:30] I think anyone who pre-orders Lebowski, he's what they're going to try to do.

[39:35] Here's what they're going to try to do.

[39:36] I think they're going to try to do small batch runs of these games where he's going to

[39:41] try to build 10 at a time, sell 10 for 12,500.

[39:46] He's probably going to even have to raise the price to make it work.

[39:49] It's just never going to work out because even after he generates all the money he's

[39:53] going to get in terms of profit off of these new games he builds is going to have to go to

[39:58] this new startup cost.

[40:01] None of that money is going to be put into a pool to make the original EA's whole.

[40:06] It's just never going to work out.

[40:08] Ultimately, what will happen if he does start to make new games is just new buyers will

[40:13] get games and the EA's will still forever be screwed by this company.

[40:19] That is why I think they should just let someone else have a crack at it and give it up.

[40:24] The better news would have been we've folded ARAs going to finish two-in-er games and

[40:30] whatever and sell them for $15,000 but the EA's get a discount because they already paid

[40:35] half of that.

[40:36] I don't know.

[40:37] I don't know what to solve this but it's just never going to end well.

[40:40] What else is going on in Bimbal people?

[40:42] Oh man, go watch Greg Bones video.

[40:44] It's so positive.

[40:45] It's so happy.

[40:47] I'm trying to think what else is going on that I want to talk about.

[40:50] Let me read a couple of your emails and I'll call it a day here.

[40:54] Let's see.

[40:55] Let's pull it up.

[40:56] Can you just pinball podcast at gmail.com.

[40:59] It is how you get in touch with me.

[41:01] I will read your feedback on the air.

[41:04] I got an email from Garrison Tarno and the title was Clear Coats and he says, I really

[41:11] enjoy your podcast.

[41:13] When we meet, I will take you and your wife to dinner.

[41:17] I'm a licensed painting contractor in California 40 plus years, a quick summary of what might

[41:23] be happening to the clear coats.

[41:26] California has the strictest environmental codes in the US.

[41:29] You can make better paint and clear coats in any other state.

[41:34] All the oil based solvents will be illegal to use in the United States soon.

[41:40] This has happened in California years ago.

[41:43] All paint has to have zero vox and is environmentally friendly.

[41:48] You cannot buy oil based clear coats in California.

[41:51] You cannot import clear coats from Arizona to California.

[41:55] The Voc is much higher in Arizona.

[41:59] If you get caught moving paint from Arizona to California, it is a big fine.

[42:04] I wonder what state the playfields are being made.

[42:07] I would want a playfield clear coated in Montana more than New Jersey.

[42:13] I am sure Montana has less restrictions on paint manufacturing.

[42:18] None of these materials work as good as they did five to ten years ago because of the

[42:23] EPA.

[42:24] It's a real problem for the painting contractor.

[42:28] Oil-solvent based clear coats dry from the surface in.

[42:32] The surface gets hard immediately then it cures in.

[42:37] Water-based clear coats are dry to the touch but they can cure from the inside out.

[42:44] If I spray kitchen cabinets with water-based enamel, I must explain to the owner that

[42:49] cabinets are dry to the touch but it will take them 30 to 60 days to really get hard.

[42:56] Yes, you could put your fingernail into the paint for weeks.

[43:00] If this is the case, playfields will have to be clear coated in a state or country that

[43:05] allows good, old, solvent-based clear coats that last.

[43:10] Keep up the good work.

[43:11] Well, Garrison, thank you so much.

[43:13] I think we learned a lot from this email.

[43:16] Because he's been doing this for 40 plus years, I think he knows what he's talking about.

[43:21] It speaks to what a lot of people are saying is these things are not allowed enough time

[43:26] to cure.

[43:27] Do you think these manufacturers ordered these playfields 60 days ago and let them cure

[43:31] long enough?

[43:32] I don't think so.

[43:34] I don't think so.

[43:36] And then Garrison wrote me another one, Timeline on water-based paint.

[43:42] He said, after sending you the EM last night, I remembered my quest to find out what was going

[43:47] on with the paints about seven to eight years ago.

[43:50] He says the EPA has mandated strict regulations on all paint pesticides eight years ago oil-based

[43:57] paints began to fail.

[44:00] Adhesion, bubbles, lifting, no gloss, etc.

[44:03] I called my paint representative.

[44:05] He said, water-based paint is fine.

[44:08] You can still use sob and based paint.

[44:10] Sov and based paint became impossible to use.

[44:13] It was very expensive and did not work.

[44:15] It became such a problem.

[44:17] I went to the paint manufacturing plant and got a hold of the head chemist.

[44:22] He told me that's the way it is.

[44:24] We have to make paint to EPA standards.

[44:27] Water-based paints have come a long way on quality and adhesion, but it will never be

[44:32] as good as solvent-based paint.

[44:35] I found out my paint manufacturer did not have to inform me he was changing the chemistry

[44:41] of the paint.

[44:42] The paint manufacturer just had to obey the law.

[44:45] The paint manufacturer was scared to tell their customers things have changed forever.

[44:50] Of course, I was living in California.

[44:53] The paint lasts half as long as and the colors fade fast.

[44:57] The state of California and the United States picked on the paint manufacturers because

[45:02] we are a small group.

[45:04] The EPA needs to say that they are cleaning up the air.

[45:07] If they stopped all the trucks from putting exhaust in the air, we would all breathe better.

[45:12] But the truckers would strike.

[45:13] To say the least, a big part of my job is keeping up with the changes in paints and coatings.

[45:19] I am sure clear coat manufacturers are scrambling to find alternative products that work.

[45:25] Again, the most populated states, California, New York, New Jersey, etc. have the strictest

[45:31] EPA restrictions.

[45:33] That is really interesting.

[45:35] Maybe even though these playfields are made in Germany, I think Mirko is in Germany.

[45:40] They are in Europe somewhere.

[45:42] What he is saying is if the state has high restrictions on what you can sell or import,

[45:52] then it doesn't matter where they are made.

[45:54] You can't bring them into New Jersey because you will have a huge fine on your hands.

[46:00] Really interesting stuff.

[46:01] I wonder if all of this is accurate and what they will tell us.

[46:05] They are going to have to tell us something.

[46:06] I got an email from Philip says, Hey Chris, listening to your podcast since day one, I enjoy

[46:15] every episode.

[46:17] The P3 rant a few episodes ago was a bit unfair, I thought.

[46:22] Not that you are wrong, but you were kind of pointing out the obvious and I didn't

[46:26] really care about it.

[46:28] In the big Lebowski, I believe that whoever buys these things has the right to do whatever

[46:34] he wants with it.

[46:36] And I mean morally as well.

[46:38] If you buy one, you are also risking losing money.

[46:41] So why should you have the right to make money?

[46:45] Same with all the games, but you said you have something special planned for it.

[46:50] And when in Japan, go visit one of the Imperial Villas in Kyoto.

[46:55] We went to see the something Shaguken Villa, totally worth a beautiful place.

[47:00] Oh, and keep the pirates filled.

[47:02] Well, Phil, thank you so much.

[47:03] Look, I've said it.

[47:05] I'll say it again.

[47:07] I don't know what I'm doing with the big Lebowski.

[47:09] I'm not flipping it for a profit.

[47:11] It's not for sale right now.

[47:12] It is simply sitting in a box.

[47:15] It has arrived.

[47:16] I'll be honest with you.

[47:17] It has arrived.

[47:20] It's not at my apartment.

[47:21] It's being held in storage.

[47:23] But I do have it.

[47:24] So I think I got one of the first shipments of the game.

[47:28] But I don't know what I'm doing with the game.

[47:31] And you will know when I figure that out.

[47:34] Mark felt said, take two washers and call me in the morning.

[47:38] Mark, he said the contrast today of Greg Bone unboxing his Jurassic Park as a giddy as a

[47:43] schoolgirl against your mad tin foil hat ramblings about clear coat problems was amazing.

[47:49] Stern already fixed the problem.

[47:51] Have a few washers put them on the play field under the post and shove them up your butts.

[47:56] Wow, Mark, first of all, that doesn't fix the problem.

[47:59] He then says, they don't care.

[48:01] Just keep buying.

[48:02] The dirty truth is that the problem is almost nonexistent with Stern play fields.

[48:07] But Jersey Jack play fields are a different story.

[48:10] Think about the sample size.

[48:12] Stern ships 50 a day.

[48:14] Jersey Jack can't get that out in a week.

[48:17] Here is a clue to why.

[48:19] How close is Illinois to the ocean?

[48:21] How close is New Jersey to the ocean?

[48:24] You know what really screws up hard coat being able to dry properly humidity.

[48:29] Now you know.

[48:30] All right.

[48:31] Well, Mark, that would be true if we were saying that Jersey Jack is in a higher humidity

[48:36] environment than Stern Pimble.

[48:38] Then why are all those Jurassic Park clear coats exhibiting the same issues, Mark?

[48:44] Your point doesn't hold water.

[48:47] No pun intended with these water based clear coats.

[48:50] All right.

[48:51] I'm happy Greg was excited, but a lot of people are going to be unboxing these games and

[48:55] not be excited if their play field start to chip.

[48:58] Carl Lutz says play field dimples.

[49:00] Hey Chris, do you know who doesn't have any play field issues?

[49:04] Multi-morphic.

[49:05] Just saying.

[49:06] Carl.

[49:07] Yeah.

[49:08] You're right, Carl.

[49:09] You're totally right.

[49:10] Now is the time in which Jerry should be beating the drum of multi-morphics.

[49:13] Do not exhibit any of these play field issues.

[49:15] So come by right now and order your P3 multi-morphic revolutionary.

[49:21] Modular Pimble platform systems featuring Lexi light speed.

[49:25] It's like, you know, look, I mean, if Jerry doesn't see an uptick in sales now after his

[49:31] game doesn't have any of these issues, I don't know.

[49:34] I don't know.

[49:35] This is a golden opportunity for anyone who has a different platform that doesn't experience

[49:40] these issues to hit the marketing drum as loud as they can.

[49:44] All right.

[49:45] Jeremy Herman says, Chris, long time listener, first time caller says, your last few

[49:51] episodes, all right, I already read this.

[49:53] He said he found them too negative.

[49:55] All right.

[49:56] I think that's it.

[49:57] I'm going to end this podcast now.

[49:59] You're going to get a little bit more of that, you know, exclusive guns and roses track

[50:03] called hard school.

[50:04] I love it.

[50:05] It's awesome.

[50:06] I actually have like the studio demo that I'm playing for you guys right now.

[50:10] But look, just to put a little bow on this episode, this is a very interesting time in

[50:16] the hobby.

[50:17] I really experience an issue like this that is starting to erode away people's enjoyment

[50:23] of the games.

[50:24] I do think that we're going to get past this.

[50:28] I think that the manufacturers will find out what the issue is and they will solve this

[50:33] issue.

[50:35] They can't allow this to continue.

[50:37] I also think it's good.

[50:39] I think part of me feels like this is a little bit of a destiny for many of you out there.

[50:44] I think this is forced many of you out there to say, wait a minute, what am I doing?

[50:49] I'm spending a lot of money.

[50:51] Is the quality there in these games?

[50:53] I didn't want it to be something like this that is a clear quality issue.

[50:59] But I think this has a lot of you sort of second guessing or just taking time to think

[51:04] twice about how much you're spending on these machines and is the quality there and

[51:11] is the customer support going to be there for you if you encounter a problem like this.

[51:18] I think it's a good thing that many people out there are saying, you know what?

[51:21] I just could have canceled my order.

[51:22] I'm going to wait to see how this plays out.

[51:24] I think the smart person does that because I don't think there's any game out there.

[51:29] As we said at the beginning of this podcast, there's no game out there that will be hard

[51:32] to get if you just give up your Wanka Collector's Edition or your Jurassic Park LE or your Jurassic

[51:38] Park premium.

[51:39] Every game that you are thinking of buying right now, if you just say, well, you know what?

[51:43] I'm going to wait.

[51:44] I'm going to wait to see if they figure this issue out and I'm not going to buy another

[51:48] new in box game until it's figured out.

[51:51] Let me tell you, with 100% certainty, you will be able to get that game.

[51:56] And if that game was made during this period of crappy playfield, you're not going to want

[52:01] to own it, right?

[52:02] You're not going to want to buy a game that has a known defect.

[52:05] And then the games made during this period are going to be very undesirable to buyers

[52:11] and collectors and to resellers.

[52:13] Know everyone's going to ask, like, let me see the post.

[52:16] And if those posts have chips in it, no one's going to want it.

[52:19] That's just, I wouldn't want it.

[52:20] Would you want it?

[52:21] Would you want to buy a car with a piece of paint missing from the, you would not be able

[52:25] to get overlooking at it if you're a collector and that matters to you.

[52:29] Now, I know there's a whole army of tournament players that could give two crafts about this

[52:34] whole thing and they knew who they are and they never buy a new inbox games and they'll

[52:39] be sarcastic on Pinside and they'll make fun of people who are OCD about this type of

[52:43] thing.

[52:44] But I think those people have no stake in the game.

[52:47] They don't know what it's like to work really hard and spend $9,000 on a product to open

[52:52] it up and have it be falling apart right before your eyes before you've even flipped the

[52:57] single ball.

[52:58] So this is, this is a topic that I think for those of you out there who work really hard

[53:01] for your money, you should get what you pay for.

[53:04] And I think this period of pausing and waiting to the solve occurs and waiting to these companies

[53:11] talk to us and tell us what they're going to do to fix it and assure us, assure us within

[53:17] a binding warranty contract that they are going to stand behind these games and they are

[53:23] not going to forces to buy replacement play fields for $500.

[53:28] That's not good enough.

[53:29] They're not just going to stick cheap washers under the post and then still has an issue.

[53:34] That's not good enough.

[53:35] And silence, silence is the worst thing right now and they're giving you nothing but silence

[53:41] but you know who's not going to be silent about it.

[53:44] Canada's pinball podcast everybody.

[53:45] Have a great day and we'll talk to you soon.

[53:59] I know I don't like being stuck in the drowns and the dreams don't change but maybe they

[54:06] are.

[54:07] I ain't got time for the game because I need you.

[54:11] Yeah, yeah, well I need you.

[54:16] I need you.

[54:19] I need you.

[54:22] I need you.

[54:24] So long as I am.
