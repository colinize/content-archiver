[00:00] It's been an amazing journey doing Canadian Spinball Podcast, five years, 600 episodes.

[00:16] But I will say the last year, the last 100 episodes have been the most favorite I've

[00:22] ever done.

[00:23] Because a year ago, people tried to get this show canceled.

[00:27] I took three months off and I came back and I said, I'm still going to beat me.

[00:32] I'm still going to do Canadian Spinball Podcast, but I'm not going to personally attack people.

[00:37] I don't need to do that.

[00:38] I'm just going to cover this industry and this hobby, the way I've always covered it.

[00:43] I'm going to give you my opinions about all of these companies with no agenda.

[00:48] I have no sponsors, nobody in my back pocket.

[00:51] If a company comes out with a great game, I'll tell you it's great.

[00:55] If I feel there's no magic under the glass, I'm going to tell you that.

[00:59] If a company wants to ban me on their Facebook page because I'm harping about their crappy

[01:03] play fields, I don't care.

[01:06] Because you tune in to Canadian Spinball Podcast every week because you want to hear someone

[01:11] speak about this industry in a way nobody else does.

[01:15] And I want to give a few thank yous before an air episode, 600 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:21] First and foremost, I want to thank each and every one of you.

[01:24] Who are the reason why I do this show?

[01:27] Every week when I put up an episode, it is so exciting to put a show up and in just a

[01:32] few minutes there's 50 people, then 150, then 1000, then 2000 people listen at least every

[01:40] single episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:43] And then once a year, everyone gets a chance to vote for who their favorite show is.

[01:48] And it's because of all of you that four years in a row, you've put Canadian Spinball

[01:53] Podcast on the top of the pinball podcast list as the favorite pinball podcast.

[01:59] And I can't thank you enough for all of your support and all of your contributions to

[02:03] this show.

[02:04] It's meant so much to me.

[02:06] I want to thank the late Bubba for being by my side all those years I did this show.

[02:11] He was my best friend and this has been a really hard year losing Bubba.

[02:16] But I feel like Bubba stood around long enough to get Killian into this world.

[02:20] So he just wanted to make sure that his little brother had the right environment and then

[02:25] he left us.

[02:26] And I want to say thank you, Bubba, for always being there and making all of your weird

[02:30] sounds as I was trying to do this show all those years.

[02:34] I want to thank my Sicilian mother who always told me to speak my mind, to not let people

[02:39] intimidate me from saying how I truly feel.

[02:43] If you've ever met the Sicilians out in the world, they are a proud people and they do

[02:47] not hold back anything and they are very emotional.

[02:51] So I want to thank my mom for giving me this sort of fortitude to do a show like this

[02:56] and not back down in the face of insurmountable at times pressure from people to do so.

[03:02] I want to thank Robin at Pennside for banning me all those years ago and he should have banned

[03:07] me because going on there every day and doing nothing productive was a waste of time.

[03:13] And if I just stayed on that side and just kept posting over and over and over again and

[03:17] had like 30,000 posts, let me tell you, it's like using all of your time and all of the

[03:22] years of your life talking about pinball and throwing it in a dumpster.

[03:27] At least this show has been much more productive and had much more positive change in the pinball

[03:33] world than just being part of these endless dumpster fire threats on Pennside.

[03:39] So Robin, thank you for recognizing my trollish behavior and you are the reason why everybody

[03:45] has Canadian pinball podcast.

[03:47] I want to say thank you to all the haters out there that listen to every single episode.

[03:51] I think half of my listeners must come from people who just tune in to see what I'm

[03:57] going to say next.

[03:58] So thank you so much for being a part of the show.

[04:00] I want to thank all of the pinball manufacturers out there for what you do on a weekly basis.

[04:06] If it wasn't for all the companies out there, it would be extremely boring covering this

[04:11] hobby.

[04:12] For the reason why this hobby is so exciting, if it wasn't for new product, thinking about

[04:17] pinball on a weekly, daily, and monthly and annual basis would not be any fun.

[04:23] I also want to say thank you to the pinball companies out there for completely making mostly

[04:28] cookie cutter games because if you didn't make cookie cutter games, then I wouldn't be

[04:32] able to go on my show every week and complain about there's hardly any magic or any world

[04:37] under glass in these modern machines.

[04:39] So thank you so much for making my job so easy.

[04:42] You know, I kid but I do mean it.

[04:43] But I am somewhat happy that they continue to under deliver because then I can do a show

[04:47] and point out how baby Grogu should use the forest powers to do more than just throw

[04:52] the ball into boring lanes and that is not creativity stern.

[04:56] I do want to say an extra special thank you to everyone you contribute to Canadian pinball

[05:00] podcast.

[05:01] I have thousands of listeners of this show.

[05:03] A 125 of you right now contribute on Patreon and about another 20 or so on PayPal.

[05:10] I have merchandise coming out that you're going to love and my contributors are going

[05:14] to get early access to all of the Canadian merchandise.

[05:17] But for the rest of you out there, you're going to love the new stuff coming because I want

[05:21] you guys to be able to wear and show how proud you are to be a fan of Canadian pinball podcast.

[05:26] So look out for that and last and certainly not least.

[05:30] I want to give my biggest thank you possible and all of my heart and all of my soul to my

[05:35] beautiful wife Brenda.

[05:37] Without Brenda, I would not be doing this.

[05:40] I married the right woman.

[05:42] She stands by and watches me every single time I put on a mic or do a Facebook live.

[05:49] She's in this apartment with me.

[05:52] She hears every single show before you do.

[05:55] She's a part of this entire journey that you don't see but it is her support and she is

[06:00] the one who pushes me to keep this show going because she knows more than anyone what this

[06:05] show means to me.

[06:07] You know, we all live in a world in which we often have to ask permission to be ourselves.

[06:11] We all live in a world now where everyone takes everything so sensitively and you can't

[06:16] be yourself.

[06:17] You can't say how you feel.

[06:18] You can't raise your hand and say that's a bunch of BS.

[06:21] We all just have to toe the line.

[06:23] And I work in a creative field in which every idea I have, I have to ask permission.

[06:28] Can I bring this to a client?

[06:29] I have to ask clients.

[06:31] Can I execute this?

[06:32] This is the only creative outlet I have in my life in which I don't have to ask anyone

[06:38] permission.

[06:39] I don't have to ask anyone if I can say this.

[06:42] I don't have to do anything I get to do exactly what I want to do.

[06:47] And that is why winning every year means so much to me.

[06:50] It is why your continued support means so much to me because it basically is not a vote

[06:55] for some cheap little trophy.

[06:57] It's a vote for us being able to say how we really feel.

[07:01] It's a vote for someone who is independent, who is not part of a group of people.

[07:06] There's no group think here.

[07:08] There's nobody handing me interview questions.

[07:10] There's nobody but me.

[07:12] And you're about to hear what I think is one of the best interviews I've ever done.

[07:16] And I didn't have anyone giving me questions.

[07:18] I didn't have notes.

[07:19] I didn't have anything.

[07:20] I just sat down and I talked to these people about Pimball.

[07:25] And for those of you who think I'm not good for Pimball, I challenge you to listen to

[07:29] this interview and you tell me, canate is not good for Pimball.

[07:32] And I want to thank my special guests.

[07:34] You're about to hear them right now because they stand for what I believe all Pimball

[07:39] companies should stand for.

[07:41] Transparency.

[07:42] Quality.

[07:43] Making each game better than the last.

[07:46] These are the things I respect.

[07:48] These are the things we all should respect.

[07:50] And I'm so happy to get them on episode 600 of Canate Is Pimball Podcast.

[07:55] And this is not the end.

[07:56] This is not some milestone for me.

[07:58] This is just another show.

[08:00] But this show means a lot because it is 600 of these shows.

[08:05] And I want to thank each and every one of you for standing by me all the years.

[08:09] And it's been a fun journey and it's not going to end because who's going to make fun

[08:13] of legends of Vahala when it comes out if I'm not on the airwaves.

[08:17] Everybody, enjoy this.

[08:18] And I picked this song because I think this song represents what I stand for in this

[08:23] community.

[08:24] Take it away.

[08:25] I don't tell you what to say.

[08:28] I don't tell you what to do.

[08:32] Don't just let me be myself.

[08:36] There's always going to be you.

[08:40] I'll be on.

[08:41] And I love to be on that free.

[08:45] And I love to be free to live my life the way I want.

[08:51] To say it to whatever I please.

[08:58] Hey, no, no, no.

[09:08] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I have a very, very special group of people joining

[09:14] me for episode 600 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[09:19] I have the family over at spooky pinball and his Kate on this as well, gentlemen.

[09:24] Katie is going to the gym.

[09:26] Okay, the dogs will be here.

[09:28] All right, well, you know me.

[09:29] I'm all about working out.

[09:30] So I'm happy she's missing this.

[09:31] Thank you for joining us for episode 600.

[09:34] And as you know, I just said this to you before I hit record that almost no manufacturer will

[09:41] talk to me.

[09:42] How does it feel?

[09:43] We are extremely excited.

[09:45] So out of the 600 episodes was 100 of them just this week alone.

[09:51] You put these things out.

[09:52] You're a machine like we me and dad were at most ever two a month, right?

[09:56] Yeah, it was one a month.

[09:57] And then if there was some kind of special, you know, like when Steve was you came back and

[10:01] Elvira, then we'd do two a month.

[10:03] But yeah, 600 is a lot, Chris.

[10:05] That's a lot.

[10:06] Thank you.

[10:07] It's actually nothing compared to the amount of games you guys are selling these days.

[10:11] And I want to talk about this because spooky pinball 2021, 1700 and 50 games sold through

[10:22] in one day.

[10:23] What was it like selling that many games in one day?

[10:27] You know, it was a real whole bag of emotions because while we were selling them, we knew

[10:32] there was so much traffic through the website.

[10:34] We knew it was obviously going over very well.

[10:36] But we were also freaking out in Panicking because the website kept going down.

[10:39] So it was like a mixture of super happy.

[10:41] And oh, my God, this is the best thing that's ever happened to us.

[10:44] And also, oh, God, we got to make sure we don't screw this up and make a lot of people

[10:48] really angry.

[10:49] Yeah.

[10:50] Poor squirrel was on the phone constantly with the web store company trying to get the

[10:55] limits taken off because we were tripping everything for quantity and volume and traffic

[11:00] and just everything that could go wrong there did.

[11:03] Like they just everything seemed like it was fraught because it was so over the top

[11:07] that it just set off all their warnings.

[11:10] By the time the dust settled though, it was obviously we're all extremely pumped, really

[11:14] excited.

[11:15] So we went to Lawrence's and we partied hard.

[11:16] I drank several beers.

[11:19] Did you guys think though, like you went from Rick and Morty, which was a huge theme

[11:23] to Halloween.

[11:24] And we're going to talk about this Ultraman.

[11:26] I want to know Chuck, how you got Ultraman through the team and got it approved as being

[11:32] the, you know, the second title.

[11:36] How did you say like we're going to do two themes and we're going to sell 1750.

[11:41] Like was there any convincing that had to be done?

[11:44] Oh, we were hard on them.

[11:45] We were hard on them for sure.

[11:48] There's no doubt about that.

[11:49] Also it was, I mean, it was well.

[11:51] It was really well received.

[11:53] We were all shocked.

[11:54] I wasn't.

[11:55] He wasn't trying.

[11:56] Dad had lined face going into it the whole time.

[11:59] Well, I mean truth is, it's something that's kind of near and dear, especially to me and

[12:03] Bug.

[12:04] And we really wanted to kind of do something a little bit different and take a bit of a

[12:09] chance.

[12:10] Now granted, I wasn't going to be, I wasn't going to bank the company on something that

[12:15] was kind of a passion project.

[12:17] And you know, a bigger license behind it definitely was a safer bet.

[12:22] But to say that I was thrilled with the way that it was embraced is, are you kidding me,

[12:26] man?

[12:27] It was awesome.

[12:28] And yeah, it's just we're lucky that people didn't take to it the way they did it.

[12:32] It could have gone the other way and we know that.

[12:34] And I hear you're getting one.

[12:36] So apparently you don't think the license sucks.

[12:38] I got number 500.

[12:39] Well, let me ask you guys a question because when you're thinking about doing two themes

[12:45] on one design, like how did that come to be?

[12:49] Because no one's really done that the way you did it and it worked.

[12:54] But how hard was it to convince people that we could have Halloween and Ultraman released

[13:00] on the same day?

[13:02] Like who came up with that decision?

[13:03] I think we're pretty much all on the same page about that.

[13:06] For whatever reason, we just thought that worked.

[13:08] I mean, so Luke, nobody told Chuck what are you doing?

[13:12] Halloween and Ultraman at the same time.

[13:15] Oh, dude, I yelled him every day.

[13:17] Every day.

[13:18] What do you think?

[13:19] It just kind of fell into place when Halloween came around.

[13:23] And again, Halloween is a theme that is going to the guy with the butcher knife on the

[13:26] back glass is going to keep it out of some home.

[13:28] So we wanted a family-friendly option.

[13:31] These guys honestly did almost all of the game themselves.

[13:35] So early on, we knew Ultraman was probably going to end up going on it, but it just made

[13:41] so much sense.

[13:42] And again, we're lucky that Ultraman is a bit like doing the Elvira games where, yes,

[13:47] it's a license, but you have some creativity and some area to work.

[13:51] So while the game worked flawlessly for Halloween, we also could make it work for Ultraman.

[13:56] And to me, the nicest part of that is like people look at it.

[14:02] And if they're an Ultraman fan, they're like, clearly, this is what you meant the game

[14:05] to be.

[14:06] Halloween was the other one.

[14:07] And then if you're a Halloween fan, you look at it, you're like, clearly, this was meant

[14:10] to be Halloween.

[14:12] So that's quite the compliment to these guys and what they accomplished on that layout.

[14:16] Which is weird because it was supposed to be John Wick.

[14:20] Let's start there.

[14:21] So this was supposed to be John Wick and what happened there?

[14:25] Well, I was a John Wick fan to start with.

[14:28] Chuck watched it afterwards and Corwin watched Matrix for the first time a while back.

[14:34] Right.

[14:35] Yeah.

[14:36] And he's six months ago.

[14:37] Yeah, he really liked that.

[14:38] He's a kid.

[14:41] You miss the Matrix?

[14:42] Yes.

[14:43] I blame dad for that.

[14:44] He was busy showing me like Godzilla movies and not young Reeves class.

[14:48] He was like, hey, Godzilla and super in for a man and all that.

[14:52] I was a little bit late to the Matrix train, but I love that first movie.

[14:57] For sure.

[14:58] Wonderful movie.

[14:59] And then yeah, they just, they got me also super hooked into John Wick.

[15:02] And the reason, I mean, even though we were designing the game kind of based around John

[15:06] Wick, the reason it works that we could make it into Halloween and Ultraman is that we

[15:10] just weren't afraid to take out half of it if that's what it took to make the theme work

[15:14] to the game.

[15:15] Like, there's nobody who was so stuck on one thing being in the game no matter what

[15:18] that we were all able to implement what we felt was the most important things from both

[15:22] themes into the game, regardless of what we had already placed.

[15:26] As a John Wick fan and as a fan of what you guys did with Ultraman and Halloween, John

[15:31] Wick, like what in the design was the John Wick movie?

[15:35] Like I know the movie is the intercontinental hotel.

[15:38] Like John Wick's not popping out from a bunch of hedges.

[15:42] What did you guys change from the John Wick design to the design we got with Halloween

[15:47] and Ultraman?

[15:48] Basically, the two upper play fields would have been the intercontinental hotel.

[15:52] For sure.

[15:53] And then far as far as like the Michaels popping out from the hedges or the multiple shots

[15:58] and the triple drop targets and things like that, that would all be obviously him in the

[16:02] shooting scenes and bodyguards popping up or whatever, you know what I mean?

[16:06] Did you guys have a stipulation that your dog needs to be killed to buy one of these?

[16:10] No, we like all the doggies.

[16:14] When you shoot the start button, that's the scene that plays first.

[16:17] Right before gameplay.

[16:19] So that you're ready to kick some ass.

[16:21] Let me ask you guys a question to you about this day because obviously Rick and Morty

[16:25] was your greatest success in a single day with 750 sold.

[16:31] I think around four hours.

[16:34] We're talking about a thousand more games in one day.

[16:39] What was it like just seeing the orders come in, seeing the distributors asking for titles?

[16:45] 500 Ultraman.

[16:46] Like someone must have been like, there is no way we're going to sell 500 Ultraman.

[16:50] And you did.

[16:51] I mean, we purposefully set all the limits, what we felt was too high, honestly.

[16:57] We just wanted to see where we were at and we really didn't expect to sell out.

[17:01] We really didn't.

[17:02] I mean, I mean, to get to shows and do some work again, which we've done before Rick and

[17:07] Morty.

[17:08] We were ready to get out there on the road and start working again.

[17:10] But I guess to kind of explain where 1750 comes from.

[17:14] We knew like obviously 750 Rick and Morty's instantly gone.

[17:17] So we knew we could reach to about a thousand Halloween.

[17:20] Like we felt comfortable saying a thousand Halloween would sell out most likely.

[17:24] Let's overreach that a little bit in say, 1250.

[17:27] And then we also felt saying 250 to 300 Ultramans.

[17:30] We think we could sell that.

[17:32] Let's overreach that as well.

[17:33] We just wanted to overreach on both to see if it was possible.

[17:36] And so both of those combined, you got 1750 and it just just worked, which was a good

[17:41] problem for us to run into.

[17:43] And now you got to make them.

[17:44] So what are we looking at in terms of production schedule?

[17:48] So do you guys feel confident you can make all of these games in 18 months?

[17:53] Yeah, I would say we feel really confident that we can get them around in 18 months for

[17:56] sure.

[17:57] We're actually going to try to err on the better side of that if we can.

[18:01] We'll try to beat that if we can.

[18:02] But we say 18 months is something we feel we can do pretty realistically.

[18:06] Under promise over deliver.

[18:07] Yeah, that's what we're aiming for.

[18:09] Yeah, I mean, we always have.

[18:10] We've brought in a lot of people and we've had a lot of people with us for a long time

[18:14] that we're trying to build up now.

[18:16] And we're trying to get more people in the company built up to a higher level where they

[18:20] really understand what's going on on a broader scheme and can really help understand when

[18:25] you're playing a pinball machine, what it should feel like, what the shots should feel

[18:29] like, what the flippers should feel like.

[18:31] Just every little adjustment, we want people in the shop now that we're starting to get

[18:35] some time and these people are becoming more experienced.

[18:37] We want them to really understand what they're looking for when they're working on a game.

[18:42] And I think they were getting closer to that.

[18:44] Up till now, obviously, even our longest running employees haven't been doing pinball

[18:48] things that long.

[18:50] So let me ask you guys about that.

[18:52] Like pinball feel and making sure people understand what people want.

[18:56] How much have you guys heard the feedback that spooky games might shoot a little tight.

[19:02] There might be a little bit of a brick fest going on.

[19:04] There might be a pinball podcast called Canadian pinball podcast that harps on that.

[19:09] Did you design this game to be more friendly from a flow and a design standpoint?

[19:16] 100%.

[19:17] Yeah, almost the entire original basis when we started was to make the shots so that

[19:22] a, some of them have a high difficulty level, but there's also a lot of them that the

[19:27] average person can walk up to and just hit, you know, we also knew obviously the things

[19:31] you're talking about.

[19:32] I mean, we see all of the feedback.

[19:34] We play the games.

[19:36] It's just about improving your process and making everything better as you go.

[19:40] We just learn a little bit every time.

[19:42] Yeah, we want to be out of the box experience to be a happy one, man.

[19:45] We don't want people having to make adjustments and all that kind of stuff.

[19:49] And we did pay attention and learn to, you know, from everything that we've ever done.

[19:53] And we do watch Pinside and we do hear what Canada says and what everybody else is talking

[19:58] about.

[19:59] And so if it comes up several times, then obviously there's something there that we need

[20:02] to look at and these guys are really, really good about kind of owning up to it and Luke

[20:08] makes a list of things we're going to improve and just starts writing down every week.

[20:13] You know, here's something we got to get better at.

[20:15] Here's a part that needs to be better.

[20:17] Here's the power supply.

[20:18] It needs to not make any noise whatsoever.

[20:20] You know, just little things like that, but it all adds up.

[20:23] Yeah.

[20:24] I changed my power supply fan in my Rick and Morty.

[20:28] And I was like, what did they just do this to begin with?

[20:32] Well, you won't have to do that again.

[20:34] Yeah.

[20:35] No, and I appreciate that.

[20:36] So let me ask you a question.

[20:37] Who designed these games?

[20:38] Like who's the designer?

[20:40] Course Barlow.

[20:41] Who the hell is that?

[20:44] So basically, I guess long story short, what happened is me and AJ started designing this

[20:50] thing and what was then my house basement a couple of years ago.

[20:54] We were just looking to, I guess, make a game that more cater to people like us where you

[21:01] can hit the shots on command.

[21:03] Some of them at least have a really good game, even if you're an average player, but still

[21:07] make it cool and exciting if you're a really good player and still have that depth and difficulty

[21:12] there if you're a good player.

[21:13] But yeah, it was just a long process.

[21:15] We started and then Coral was still in high school at the time.

[21:18] Well, high school in college.

[21:19] Yeah, so he did both.

[21:21] So he came on later, started helping us out and everything and he brought a lot of,

[21:26] are you telling me that a high school kids game is going to see more homes than a John

[21:31] Papadu game in 2021?

[21:33] Yeah, that's that's right.

[21:34] That's a real thing.

[21:35] I have no comment.

[21:37] Okay.

[21:38] Post-tice and then yeah, kind of last thing after the three of us and once it was in

[21:43] the shop, then chucked out a hold of it and chucked at it some really cool stuff afterwards

[21:47] to the top.

[21:49] I didn't screw it up as what he's trying to say.

[21:51] No, he didn't.

[21:52] He didn't screw it up.

[21:53] They worked on this thing for six months before I even knew about it.

[21:56] I mean, that's that's the kind of dedication these guys had to the project and they just

[22:00] wanted to see if if I would accept it when they brought it in and holy crap did I.

[22:04] I think it's amazing, man.

[22:05] I can't wait for you to play it too.

[22:07] Yeah, I'm excited.

[22:08] Now, Charlie, let's talk about these themes, Halloween and Ultraman, like opposite ends

[22:14] of the spectrum.

[22:16] Which one came first when John Wick sort of you guys realized it wasn't going to happen?

[22:22] Was it Halloween and then you looked at this and said, what about Ultraman?

[22:26] How did it work?

[22:27] How did you guys decide what this game would be?

[22:30] Well, I heard a podcaster one time talking about how, you know, maybe you should just

[22:34] take a break and instead of buying that pinball machine, take your family to Japan.

[22:41] And man, I just, you were speaking to me and yeah, that's exactly what we did.

[22:46] We had at the same licensing convention that we got Rick and Morty in the corner of the

[22:53] room.

[22:54] There was a small table from super-eye productions that they had just settled some issues

[22:57] that they had with worldwide distribution and they were barely there.

[23:02] So I went over and I saw it and I got excited and I talked to them and it kind of opened

[23:05] the door.

[23:06] And then when we went to Japan, we had set up a meeting to go to super-eye as offices

[23:11] and discuss it with them and to see, you know, how much effort they were putting into.

[23:16] Realistically, if it hadn't been for those issues that I'm not going to go into because

[23:19] it'll bore you if you're, well, I know you're a Japanese kind of monster guy, you know,

[23:24] you like all things Japanese.

[23:25] I do.

[23:26] It really gets dealt.

[23:27] But Ultraman should have been what Power Rangers became in the United States, but they had

[23:31] issues.

[23:32] They couldn't do it.

[23:33] They couldn't get here.

[23:34] They really were going to put a push behind it and they had deals in place with Marvel

[23:38] and just big stuff coming to the United States to kind of raise awareness.

[23:43] And I thought, well, maybe if we get in on this now, we've got an opportunity to kind of

[23:49] write that way and see if it goes anywhere.

[23:51] But regardless, I wanted to do it because it's something I just absolutely love.

[23:56] I grew up with it.

[23:58] There's 60 years of history behind this show.

[24:00] Bug and I were into a whole lot of it from just going to G Fest every year.

[24:04] Yeah, I'm just glad it worked out and I'm kind of glad that these guys gave it a chance

[24:07] and accepted it because you know, if they would have said, look, you can't put Ultraman

[24:11] on this game, I would have respected that.

[24:13] And Halloween to us was a much bigger license that came along a little bit later.

[24:18] And it was, I know you didn't kind of think that Halloween was going to do what it did.

[24:22] But man, if you're in the horror community and you do like the horror conventions and stuff,

[24:26] like Katie and I and Bug do, it's such an iconic thing that we knew it was a no brainer.

[24:33] When that became available, we had to go that route.

[24:35] Yeah, I've been wrong on the horror community my entire career.

[24:40] So I've gone to Chiller Theater.

[24:43] Yeah, no, I know.

[24:44] I always tell the story like when El Vira was doing signatures at TPS, I was like, who cares

[24:51] about El Vira?

[24:53] And then the line was like around the block and I'm like, you know what?

[24:56] This is a huge community that I will admit I'm wrong and there are millions of fans.

[25:03] And so obviously, and Halloween, right, 1250, those sold out like right away.

[25:10] And were you guys surprised at all?

[25:11] Or you're just like, this is it?

[25:12] This is how popular it is.

[25:14] We knew it would do well, but like Luke said earlier, I don't think we expected to take

[25:18] it to shows and work a little bit.

[25:19] If we had a few hundred to sell, so be it.

[25:21] That was great.

[25:23] But yeah, once it started hitting like Collider and Bloody Disgusting and Dread Central

[25:29] and everything else, I knew that it was going to blow up.

[25:31] And then we started seeing the Fang Club membership skyrocket.

[25:35] And going into that day, we were, we knew it was probably going to go, but not the way

[25:41] it did.

[25:42] Do you guys have more than 1,750 Fang Club members?

[25:48] Um, I'd have to ask you.

[25:50] I don't know.

[25:51] I don't know.

[25:52] Honestly, I don't know.

[25:53] No, I'm just curious.

[25:54] Like, is there at least a game for every member?

[25:56] And I think people have been wondering that.

[25:58] Now I'm a member and I signed up.

[25:59] I got, hopefully, some of my listeners to join the membership.

[26:03] That's a genius idea.

[26:05] Whose idea was that to actually give people the chance to buy the games early?

[26:10] Honestly, it was something that a friend of ours named Brian Savage.

[26:12] He ran the GI Joe Collector's Club and the Transformers Club for Hasbro for years

[26:18] and years.

[26:19] He had kind of talked to us about doing something like that and, and help my daughter get that

[26:24] set up for us.

[26:26] So it did make sense.

[26:28] And at the same time, we were running out of, we were running out of games.

[26:33] We had way more customers than we did games at that point.

[26:36] So we needed a way to kind of feel or to make everybody feel like they were still part

[26:41] of the spooky family because we are the small town family based company.

[26:45] And, uh, you know, we didn't want to push anybody away, but it became impossible to like,

[26:50] hey, you're a previous spooky pinball game buyer.

[26:53] We're going to get you a game.

[26:55] And we just couldn't do it anymore.

[26:57] So the Fang Club was kind of a way to get them early access to give everybody that really

[27:02] had supported us a shot to still get in on game sales on opening day.

[27:06] Do you guys feel that struggle, the small boutique company that is now selling a lot of

[27:13] product, you know?

[27:14] And I know you guys want it really to hook up.

[27:17] Those people who were on the journey with you from America's most honoured to Rob Zombie,

[27:22] to Alice Cooper's, do you feel like?

[27:25] Some sort of pressure to make sure that those people that have supported you all these

[27:29] years also get early access to these games and you take care of them before these

[27:34] pinflation people that are flipping games and scalping games right away on day one.

[27:39] Kids?

[27:40] Yeah.

[27:41] From the owner of the company standpoint, yes.

[27:44] And that's like I said, what the Fang Club was really all about was to try to give everybody

[27:49] an equal opportunity to do that and still feel like they're part of it.

[27:52] But if, you know, I know Spooky Luke has like mentioned on Pinside and stuff that we do

[27:57] reserve like some of the first batch that go to locations where we can get immediate feedback

[28:03] and play testers where we can get immediate beta testing and stuff like that.

[28:07] And yeah, some of those people that have been there since America's most honoured are

[28:11] on that list for sure.

[28:12] We do everything we can to kind of take care of the people that have always taken care

[28:17] of us.

[28:18] You've forgiven Ben Heck for the artwork on America's most honoured yet.

[28:21] I will defend Ben Heck by dying day.

[28:24] That man did everything he could on that game to help get us off the ground and you know

[28:28] what, the day that we made the art, Ben was the best artist we had.

[28:33] But he's car now.

[28:35] His power is another thing.

[28:36] That man needs a new vehicle.

[28:38] It's terrible.

[28:39] Who drives a 2006 Ford station wagon, Chris?

[28:41] Tell me.

[28:42] I don't know.

[28:43] Well, so he's doing the boards for these games.

[28:45] And so what was it like working with Ben on the, what's the name of it?

[28:48] The Pintar.

[28:49] Pintatar.

[28:50] Okay, the Pintatar.

[28:51] And that's actually Parker Dillman.

[28:52] Parker Dillman does the engineering, Ben did the operating system code work.

[28:57] Okay.

[28:58] So you're working with Ben again on this game and it does seem like the families back

[29:02] together again with this release.

[29:04] Let me ask you guys a question though because this was something that was very interesting

[29:07] and still to this day.

[29:09] People haven't seen gameplay video of these games.

[29:13] So was that a conscious effort not to show more gameplay footage and open up the order

[29:19] bank?

[29:20] So talk to me about that.

[29:21] I mean, I guess I'll take that one.

[29:25] It's kind of a two part thing, like I said before.

[29:27] I mean, part of it is a lot of times when people see things like that, they can pick

[29:33] one thing out that maybe isn't even true.

[29:35] I see a lot of things, even on the forums.

[29:38] Somebody makes an assessment of something.

[29:39] I can see where they got to that point, but it just doesn't exist at all.

[29:43] It's not a problem at all.

[29:45] But you hate to see one person pick out something that doesn't exist and then they just spiral

[29:52] that into a massive thing over and over and then everyone starts saying it's like as many

[29:56] people say it, then it becomes true.

[29:59] So we always worry about that type of stuff.

[30:01] You never want to have the assessment of the game immediately go south or anything like

[30:06] that or someone for it.

[30:07] Especially, I mean, if it's deserved, that's one thing.

[30:09] If it's something that isn't actually there, that really sucks to see when that when

[30:13] that spirals out of control.

[30:15] And then also a lot of times it's just not up to us on this one, even if we even if we

[30:20] would have said we're absolutely going to do it, we wouldn't have been able to do that.

[30:23] We 100% would not have been allowed to do that.

[30:25] So is that like a licensing thing?

[30:27] You have to show the license holder, the gameplay to get approval.

[30:32] Exactly.

[30:33] Yeah, exactly.

[30:34] You know, a lot of people and I had to learn a lot about this this time around because

[30:37] I was extremely unfamiliar, but you have to show them everything.

[30:41] And I mean, you don't do anything.

[30:43] You don't post a social media picture without clearance.

[30:45] You don't do anything.

[30:47] Chuck, I texted you this.

[30:50] At this point, you guys have sold pretty much all the games.

[30:54] So why bother with gameplay footage?

[30:57] Why not let the owners of these machines experience the magic when they unbox them?

[31:02] Because I've always felt like pinball streams spoil everything that's in the game.

[31:08] So have you guys considered not showing any gameplay footage until the people unboxed

[31:14] their games?

[31:15] I'm looking at you Chuck.

[31:16] What do you think?

[31:17] Well, now we're not gonna.

[31:19] We were going to, but blame canate if you don't like our shoes.

[31:25] Blame canate is a great excuse.

[31:26] God.

[31:27] No, man.

[31:28] I mean, I understand exactly what you're saying, but at the same, I don't know.

[31:32] It's kind of like the old adage of do you watch, you know, the third trailer of the movie

[31:36] you're just dying to see before you go see it.

[31:39] I stay away from that stuff.

[31:40] So I agree with you.

[31:41] I would sit on that like if Jack Danger's streaming, you know, a game that I just gotta

[31:46] have and I know it.

[31:47] But I want to enjoy it for the first hand experience myself.

[31:50] Then yeah, I would skip all that stuff.

[31:52] But for a lot of people, they don't feel that way.

[31:54] They want to see it.

[31:55] So, you know, as soon as we can stream and do all that kind of on stuff that a lot of

[31:59] people do expect, then yeah, I'm sure it'll be out there.

[32:02] Okay.

[32:03] So when are we looking at the potential first stream of these games?

[32:06] I mean, you've been talking to Jack.

[32:08] Yeah, I've been talking to Jack Danger.

[32:10] First stream we're looking towards about the end of the month, end of July.

[32:13] But I'm hoping to actually get gameplay footage out to people before that.

[32:17] What about Canada playing these games for the first time and actually draining every three

[32:21] seconds?

[32:22] Is that not in the cards for you, gentlemen?

[32:23] Well, Ultraman 500 means you're deadlash.

[32:26] Yeah, I love it.

[32:27] I love it.

[32:28] So let's talk about these games being made because you just said number 500.

[32:31] Are you guys going to make the Halloween alongside the Ultraman?

[32:35] So is one building handling Ultraman, one Halloween?

[32:40] What's it going to be like?

[32:41] Luke is absolutely our production manager.

[32:43] So holy crap, you have the right guy on your show right now.

[32:46] Now, we'll be building them two to one, Halloween to Ultraman.

[32:50] Okay.

[32:51] So they'll be right on the line with it.

[32:53] Most of the physical parts are the same, just the cosmetic parts change.

[32:56] And that's not really a hard transition for us.

[33:00] The menu systems will be the same.

[33:01] Yeah, I mean, the coil placements the same.

[33:05] So okay, but no, they're going to be fairly, fairly ordered or spread in a fair way, I

[33:10] would say.

[33:11] Like said, we're going to build them at ratios according to how many you're there.

[33:14] And that's music to my ears because as you know, I need to buy a house, daycare is expensive.

[33:19] So I have some time to make my final payment on Ultraman, number 500.

[33:24] Now something I've been advocating people do is get the butter cabinet.

[33:28] Now I don't know why people would not get it, but I'm not a shield for your company.

[33:34] Don't worry.

[33:35] But man, it's so nice.

[33:37] I had the butter cabinet on Rick and Morty.

[33:40] Would you guys order the butter cabinet on your personal machines?

[33:44] And here's your chance to tell the Canadian community why they should go butter.

[33:49] I mean, I think that Halloween is the absolute best looking butter cabinet that we've ever

[33:54] made by far.

[33:55] It's not even close.

[33:56] And I think Ultraman is the second best butter cabinet.

[33:59] And that's not like a Gary Stern, you know, the game on the lines, the best one we ever

[34:02] made.

[34:03] They are freaking gorgeous.

[34:05] They're absolutely stunning.

[34:07] But yeah, Halloween for whatever reason, when you see that thing clear coated, it is just

[34:12] ridiculously pretty.

[34:14] You guys have the best play fields in Pimball right now.

[34:18] And you know me, I've been suffering the slings and arrows of Jersey Jack Pimball and their

[34:24] guns and roses play field issues.

[34:26] How did you guys do it?

[34:27] Like, can you give us any insight into how the best play fields in all of Pimball right

[34:33] now are coming out of spooky Pimball?

[34:35] We can tell you, but we have to kill you.

[34:38] Okay.

[34:39] We can't do it, man.

[34:40] Can't do it.

[34:41] Dude, that's like a, that's been over 10 years process of me working with a really close

[34:46] friend of mine and getting that ironed out to the point where you can say that.

[34:51] And I am confident to agree with you.

[34:55] It hasn't always been that way.

[34:56] You know, we've been honest about it when we had an issue.

[34:58] We did the very best we could to support everybody and to fix it.

[35:02] But you know, we took the time at that point to figure out, okay, why suddenly now did

[35:07] this just happen?

[35:08] They've been really good through like Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper and total nuclear, excuse

[35:13] me, Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper.

[35:14] And then total nuclear, we did have a little bit of a hiccup and we stopped.

[35:18] We fixed it and we moved forward.

[35:20] And we haven't had a look.

[35:22] Did we have a single Rick and Morty come back?

[35:25] Not that I know of.

[35:26] No, if they're, I don't think so.

[35:28] I have been made aware of any Rick and Morty that we've had to replace.

[35:32] This for a long time.

[35:33] Yeah.

[35:34] It's been a long time.

[35:35] And knock on wood, no pun intended.

[35:38] We intend to keep it that way.

[35:39] But it's a lot of work and it's a lot of proprietary stuff.

[35:42] So when a competitor is having an issue with a play field, do you ever feel like lending

[35:47] them some advice on how to fix it?

[35:51] It does sort of turn people off to the hobby in general.

[35:55] Do you guys ever feel that sort of obligation to maybe make a phone call to Jersey Jack and

[36:01] say, hey, maybe you should remove the artwork from the post area like any of that?

[36:06] You know, it's kind of a mixed thing.

[36:09] I have friends at Jersey Jack.

[36:10] I have friends at Stern.

[36:11] I don't want to see anybody suffer.

[36:13] They know how to get a hold of me, man.

[36:15] Who's making the play field?

[36:16] Is it Bader and Spooky?

[36:18] Who's actually making these things for you guys?

[36:20] That's all kind of one little family.

[36:23] We're all, I mean, yeah, we have the capability to do all this in-house and it's the same process

[36:29] when we do, but it's all being done outsourced at a shop that's 15 minutes away right now because

[36:36] we're a little bit busy.

[36:37] We don't have time to be doing that at this moment.

[36:39] Now is that always going to be the case?

[36:41] Probably not.

[36:42] But that's kind of up to Luke here in the production department to decide what he wants

[36:46] to take on and what he wants to do it.

[36:48] But for right now, yeah, they're, like you said, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's

[36:50] it.

[36:51] We share all the same stuff.

[36:52] We know each other's secrets.

[36:53] We do all that together and and it's, it's at Borders right now, which is fine.

[36:58] And we just don't have the time.

[36:59] It's, it's just, it's a lot of work.

[37:02] So after these games sold so well, Luke, did you ask for a raise this week?

[37:06] I, I don't think I can even get paid hourly.

[37:09] I don't even know what happens to me at this point.

[37:13] Charlie, I want to ask you just emotionally what it's been like because I was there when

[37:19] you had America's most haunted and you had 70 games sold and you were going around

[37:24] to all the different shows and it was, is there, are you as tasked to, to sell 150 in a

[37:30] year?

[37:31] What has it been like emotionally sort of going from that point in the company to this

[37:36] point where in one day, 1750 sold, how has it been for you emotionally to see all the

[37:43] obstacles that you've overcome to get to this point?

[37:46] This is your cue to work up the tiers.

[37:50] These guys have seen a grown man cry more times than I care to admit at this point.

[37:54] It's been, it's been good and bad over the entire stretch, you know, things don't always

[37:58] go the way you anticipate.

[38:00] But when I think the one thing with spooky that kind of sets us apart a bit is we are so

[38:04] upfront, we're honest.

[38:06] We will tell you what we are capable of.

[38:08] We don't try to over reach.

[38:09] We don't over promise.

[38:11] We don't tell you we can do something that we don't feel we're going to, you know, we'll

[38:15] get their money now and then we'll worry about it later and we just, we've never done

[38:19] that.

[38:20] So when we say 1750 in a day, leave it near the A.J. and Bug and they're, they're ironing

[38:27] it out before we even sell the first game.

[38:29] If this happens, how do we deal with it?

[38:31] How do we make sure that we don't let people down?

[38:34] And yeah, man, I mean, I, I do get emotional.

[38:37] You kidding me?

[38:38] It's, we've gone from, I, I never want to go over 500 games a year to these guys talking

[38:44] me into, we can do more.

[38:46] Just let us do our job and, and I kind of, you know, do everything I need to do to help

[38:50] them and let them handle production and just get out of the way and watch them go and,

[38:55] yeah, you think I'm not proud to watch that happen?

[38:58] Oh my God.

[38:59] It's crazy.

[39:00] And I want to ask you as someone who has a, a four month old baby, how does it feel

[39:05] having a company working with your son and waking up every day and getting to do what

[39:10] you love?

[39:11] And I'd love to hear from both Chuck and Bug on this.

[39:13] And my daughter too.

[39:15] And your daughter.

[39:16] This is like the American dream.

[39:18] This is the dream of everybody to wake up every day and, and not work a day in your life

[39:22] because you're doing something you love.

[39:24] What has it been like for you as a family?

[39:26] He probably enjoy it more if I quit saying get out of my way old man every morning.

[39:31] He does that on purpose.

[39:33] It's kind of funny actually.

[39:35] What's it like to be a father?

[39:36] I mean, all I hear is, you know, you're in the middle of Wisconsin.

[39:40] So everybody around here is agriculture and construction.

[39:43] I can't get my kid to come work for me.

[39:45] He would want nothing to do with this.

[39:46] And then I go to work and my daughter is sitting right behind me doing an incredible job

[39:50] handling all of our inventory and, and sales and everything else that she does and running

[39:55] the web store.

[39:57] And then Bug is like literally hovering over our program or going, here's my rules,

[40:02] make them better.

[40:04] And, and helping with production and, and he's editing video and stuff now and cutting

[40:09] clips of Ultraman and laughing his head off.

[40:11] I'm getting paid to do this and you're paying me old man.

[40:14] And he's like cutting clips of Ultraman beating up, you know, some giant Kajyu guy in a

[40:18] rubber suit and it feels absolutely incredible.

[40:22] I know how lucky I am to have him here and I never take that for granted.

[40:25] Bug, how is it for you that your dad is ushered in this pinball company into your world?

[40:31] That's all right.

[40:32] No, obviously, I think everybody knows I love it.

[40:38] I mean, my senior year at high school, I started taking nighttime college courses.

[40:42] I just went up to dad.

[40:43] I was like, Hey, if there was one thing you could send me to school for, what would it be?

[40:46] So I can help out when I'm done because I don't like school.

[40:49] I just want to get into the family company.

[40:50] So set me to go learn some AutoCAD and I got back and ever since then I've really just

[40:56] dedicated absolutely everything I have to the company.

[40:59] It's, it's my main focus in life every single day.

[41:03] And I really can't imagine a world without it.

[41:06] I can't imagine not working in pinball at this point.

[41:09] It's literally everything to me and no, I'm going to get emotional instead.

[41:16] It's obviously what more could I ask for?

[41:18] I get to work inside the family business and it's something I love.

[41:21] It's not like I'm working inside the family business, but I'm plumbing.

[41:24] You know what?

[41:25] You know, I mean, the last couple of months leading up to launch, I was in there a lot

[41:29] of days from 7.30 at o'clock in the morning until, you know, 9.10 at night and I'm telling

[41:33] me out of the three people talking to you right now, I was the slacker.

[41:37] These guys were just non-stop all in because, you know, it was their first game and they

[41:42] wanted to see it do well as, and my job was just again to support help them, get all the

[41:47] art set up, get everything, you know, tweaked and finalized as best I could and, and on both

[41:53] games, which is not easy.

[41:55] And it's been absolutely incredible to watch and I'm just lucky to be here helping them

[42:00] at this point.

[42:01] And it's been incredible to witness, you know, from from my side of the fence of someone

[42:05] who covers the hobby.

[42:07] When you guys had your amazing day last week, did any other Pimball manufacturers call

[42:12] you up to congratulate you on such a successful day?

[42:16] I will not name names, but several people from different organizations absolutely reached

[42:22] out to me.

[42:23] Come on, I'm trying to call out the ones you did in Charlie.

[42:25] You don't want to try to do that.

[42:26] You don't want to try to do that again by 5.20.

[42:29] Now the issue guys a question because you're working with John Carpenter who made Halloween

[42:33] and you know John Carpenter made big trouble in little China.

[42:37] Is there any hope for me?

[42:39] You know, never say never, but there's there's other John Carpenter movies I think I would

[42:43] rather do.

[42:44] Alright, name them.

[42:45] Yes.

[42:46] I'm afraid to at this point.

[42:48] What's better than big trouble?

[42:50] Come on, name them.

[42:51] I see all the third requests on, on Pinside.

[42:53] I mean, I see all of them.

[42:54] I'm not saying that I put them all on a spreadsheet because I do, but, but after

[43:01] old Tramann aren't like all bets off for you guys as a marketer, I would argue that

[43:06] there's no way old Tramann's going to work and like look what it did.

[43:10] So at this point, Charlie, are you just like, I'm just going to go with my gut or are

[43:14] you going to do some market research on what's next?

[43:17] Um, and trust me, I, when you're talking like about Halloween, you know, prior to sales

[43:22] day and I just don't think it's a, we kind of know because we are in that community that

[43:28] what the fan base is for certain items.

[43:31] But I mean, realistically, you have to know that if you're going to sell 1700 and 50

[43:36] or if these guys decide they want to go a little further than that, that you have to be

[43:40] a little more appealing to a wider audience.

[43:43] So does that mean I can do a big trouble in little China and expect to sell 2000?

[43:47] Absolutely not.

[43:48] I don't think that's, you know, how that works.

[43:51] But at the same time, do we want to do games that maybe we can slide in like we did with

[43:56] Ultraman and kind of be true to ourselves so that we're building product that we enjoy

[44:00] as well and hope that it finds an audience.

[44:03] Absolutely.

[44:04] I'm not opposed to taking chances that way.

[44:05] Any Akira in the future for this company because I just got to ask because you see the

[44:09] power of the Japanese culture with Ultraman and Akira is even more popular in America.

[44:16] So what do you, what do we think here?

[44:18] Can we, can we make this happen?

[44:20] Are you going to design it?

[44:21] I've got a designer.

[44:23] I've got some friends in the design world, but I think that what you guys showcased was

[44:29] phenomenal because I think what you guys are doing is you're doing themes that nobody

[44:34] else would do.

[44:35] And I think that I've been critical of that.

[44:38] I've said Charlie's only making games for Charlie and it's never going to work.

[44:42] And I think we all ate a lot of humble pie this past week because it did work.

[44:47] And I think what's worked for you guys is your love and your passion for these themes

[44:52] is also what attracts people to this because the 500 people that bought Ultraman, they're

[44:58] not all Ultraman fans.

[45:00] They're basically saying, I just maybe love Pimball and maybe love spooky and I'm willing

[45:05] to discover this theme through this game.

[45:08] Do you guys feel some sort of pride in introducing people to new themes like Ultraman through a

[45:14] Pimball experience?

[45:15] That happened a lot on Rick and Morty too.

[45:17] It was amazing how many guys my age that were like, why are they doing some cartoon based?

[45:23] I've never even heard of Rick and Morty.

[45:26] And then a year later, there's a lot of people coming back on.

[45:29] I absolutely fell in love with the show because you introduced me to it.

[45:32] So I mean, if you're into Kaiju and Tokusatsu and anime and all that kind of stuff, if

[45:37] you stumble into Ultraman because of us, I'm thrilled.

[45:40] Charlie, what keeps you up at night?

[45:42] What are you afraid of?

[45:43] The next Canadian podcast.

[45:45] That's not true.

[45:47] I mean, this is number 600.

[45:49] But what are you afraid of?

[45:51] What keeps you up at night in this hobby?

[45:53] Luke will tell you everything scares me.

[45:55] Every thing.

[45:56] I'm not a thick-skinned individual man.

[45:59] When people are upset with something we've said or done, it cuts me deep and I struggle

[46:05] with that.

[46:06] I'm getting better because these guys are kind of on my side and they're taking a lot

[46:09] of stress off my plate.

[46:12] I don't touch production anymore nor should I.

[46:15] These guys are doing a better job than I ever did.

[46:18] That does help me a lot.

[46:20] You're only as good as your next game and this business is very, very ruthless.

[46:25] There's a lot more fish in the pond.

[46:29] I'm thrilled and blessed that these guys are just killing it and making the company better.

[46:35] It's not me.

[46:36] I don't have to be the guy that's got to design the next game in six months and I've

[46:40] got rush as fast as I can and make sure it's as good as possible.

[46:44] These guys jump ahead and get a great game done and then Katie and I get through Sales

[46:50] Day and I can actually get a little time off for the first time in eight and a half to

[46:55] ten years.

[46:56] That's great.

[46:57] Did you guys take a little vacation between Sales Day and production?

[47:01] That's been worse.

[47:05] Come on.

[47:06] You guys got a few million bucks to these pre-orders, not a single week off.

[47:11] I will say that about two days after Sales, we said, I think we can relax today.

[47:16] I think it's going to be okay.

[47:18] We went for just a short little boat ride on the river and we got back and we found 12

[47:22] things we needed to do seven hours ago.

[47:24] We're all scrambling to get it done that night.

[47:27] I went in the next day and these guys were gutting the shop like a fish, just making more

[47:31] room for more production and stuff.

[47:34] I had a lot of junk and we affectionately call it the graveyard.

[47:37] My old personal pinball parts, boxes of old belly boards and things and I'm like, don't

[47:41] throw my stuff out.

[47:43] Let me ask you guys about the fact that you released this game in July, not at a show.

[47:49] You sold out basically in one day.

[47:52] Do you need to go to shows to sell these games?

[47:55] What do you guys think about that?

[47:57] There's been discussion on whether or not revealing games that show as hurt sales or help

[48:02] sales.

[48:03] The last two times we've released games online, not at a show and it's gone quite well

[48:08] for us but we still plan on going to lots of shows as many as I can drag these things

[48:12] too.

[48:13] Will these games be at Allentown or Boston or Exbell?

[48:18] Where's the first show we can play some of these new games?

[48:20] We can't really speak to specific ones yet but we'll be hitting as many as we possibly

[48:24] can.

[48:25] I love it.

[48:26] Can't wait to get the shows and then you can't give me a specific one.

[48:28] I love the specificity.

[48:31] We're going to be at every show which one I can't tell you.

[48:35] It's tough because you don't want to disappoint.

[48:37] You don't want to say we're going to for sure be at this one but then something comes

[48:40] up.

[48:41] There's so many different variables and everything like that.

[48:45] We might need the game for this show or someone had this set up but then they didn't.

[48:48] You just try to get to it as many as you can.

[48:50] A lot of times the shows do like two and now two is going to be there.

[48:54] We like to leave that to them as well.

[48:56] Expo is in October in Chicago.

[48:59] It seems to be the one that is the comeback show.

[49:02] Will you guys be at Expo?

[49:03] It's Halloween weekend so I'm out.

[49:08] That's my favorite week of the entire year.

[49:12] The problem with Expo this year is Midwest gaming classic is one week behind it and that's

[49:18] kind of our home state show.

[49:21] It's really tough still.

[49:23] We're a growing company.

[49:24] Yeah, I get that but it's really tough for us to hit a show two weekends in a row.

[49:29] We're doing that.

[49:30] It's not like we have just a team that goes and handles the shows.

[49:35] It's us.

[49:36] If we're at shows from Wednesday to Sunday and then turn around and go back on Friday

[49:41] to Sunday, we're not getting work done.

[49:44] That makes sense.

[49:45] Let me talk to you guys about transparency because one of the things that your company does

[49:50] that many companies don't do and I'm talking about Stern and Jersey Jack and Chicago Gaming

[49:56] Company is you're on the forums and you're talking to the fans.

[50:01] How did you come to that decision that we're going to be transparent and we're going to

[50:05] talk to people in real time?

[50:06] I mean, I was watching Luke on Pinside like, hey, maybe there's two games off of this

[50:10] design and I'm like, well, they're in it.

[50:12] You guys are in it.

[50:13] Charlie, how do you sort of approach that?

[50:16] What's your thoughts on just being as transparent as we can within the community?

[50:20] We still love it as much as everybody else does and obviously you can't make this for

[50:26] a living or make this product for a living without really, really caring.

[50:31] Yeah, I know that sometimes the chatter in there can go a bit to the dark side, so to speak,

[50:37] but there's a lot of good people in there too.

[50:39] Even on the negative stuff, you're learning something.

[50:44] If there's something we can gain from it, then we would be foolish not to listen.

[50:48] They look, this is a problem with some people.

[50:49] We need to make it a better.

[50:51] We need to make an improvement.

[50:52] At 90% of that at this point is Luke.

[50:55] He just has a really good kind of ear for it.

[50:59] He knows what people want to hear.

[51:02] He knows how to kind of calm the waters if there is a problem that really isn't.

[51:07] And he's just done an excellent job at being that earpiece for spooky pinball and going

[51:13] in there and talking to people.

[51:14] And I think, and again, I don't think it's a happy accident that 1,750 games sold and

[51:21] we're getting emails left and right about how people want to support us because of who

[51:26] we are and what we are.

[51:28] That's a big part of Luke being in there.

[51:30] I go in once in a while, bug dips in every now and then, but the vast majority of it is

[51:35] Luke.

[51:36] Well, Luke, again, when are you going to ask for that raise?

[51:39] Is it happening?

[51:40] Or is it just...

[51:41] He's dating my daughter and I haven't shot him.

[51:46] I'll consider that a bonus.

[51:48] Well, that's one way into the dynasty.

[51:53] I think it's important.

[51:54] There's some companies that just want to avoid the criticism and the critique and I think

[51:58] you guys sort of run at it face on and you guys have taken a lot of criticism and advice

[52:05] and support all at the same time.

[52:08] And I've always said, if there's any company that continues to get better and better and

[52:12] better with each game and listen to the customers, the future of spooky pinball.

[52:17] If you guys were to sort of articulate the future of spooky, how many games do you think

[52:23] it's like, this is it?

[52:24] We don't want to make any more than this and we want to continue to be a company that

[52:28] makes themes that other companies miss.

[52:31] What's your goal or your vision for spooky moving from here?

[52:35] You know, I think the most important thing is we're going to do as many games as we can

[52:39] do a good job building.

[52:40] I mean, there's still most of the customers at this point.

[52:44] I recognize their pinside handle or their name.

[52:47] Still, I remember a lot of the customers from Bill to Bill to Bill at this point.

[52:50] I think we all do.

[52:51] I mean, if you ask Morgan, nine out of 10 times if I say, hey, this customer emailed in

[52:55] and they need a replacement part, she knows them by name and she just goes and looks

[52:59] up their address.

[53:00] She doesn't even need to ask me who that is or what game they have.

[53:03] So that's a cool part of it.

[53:04] I mean, if we started to lose that or if the builds weren't at the quality that we wanted

[53:09] to see them at or if we felt like it was making the company suffer, we would definitely

[53:13] pull back a little bit.

[53:14] But we're just going to do the numbers that we can do a really good job of and stick with

[53:18] that.

[53:19] My job at this point, like I said, is just to kind of take care of these guys and help

[53:23] my out and go after the licenses that we think are going to do exactly what we need to

[53:29] do.

[53:30] And we still try to be true to ourselves here and there and dip our toes into maybe a big

[53:34] trouble in little China or something like that that makes a group of us happy.

[53:41] And Charlie, I will wire you $20,000 for the SLE of big trouble and little China.

[53:48] It's such a perfect theme for pinball.

[53:51] Like you got low pan, you got jack bird and you the whole storyline of battling the different

[53:56] diodes.

[53:57] It's perfect.

[53:58] Anyway, is it true that deep root pinball tried to buy you guys at one point?

[54:02] That's on you, Charlie.

[54:04] Yeah, I'm not really going to talk about that.

[54:07] I think Robert has indicated that he tried to work with us at one point publicly.

[54:12] I will not deny that.

[54:14] I chose not to.

[54:15] No, it's a good decision, right?

[54:17] 122 Roses versus 500 Ultra Man in a few hours.

[54:20] So look, this is been a great week for you guys.

[54:25] And so now you've got 18 months to build these games.

[54:28] Who's designing the next game?

[54:29] Let me ask that.

[54:30] It might already be in the works.

[54:33] It could be half done.

[54:35] Okay.

[54:36] And like, is the theme already selected?

[54:38] You're really getting at these.

[54:42] Is it hard being a designer knowing you have to wait 18 months to get to the next round

[54:46] of production?

[54:47] No, I think these guys have done a good job on, you know, again, they started what became

[54:53] Halloween Ultra Man.

[54:54] What did you say two years ago?

[54:56] Yeah.

[54:57] That started in your basement.

[54:58] So they were already well into the next game.

[55:01] By the time we launched this one, it's definitely part of the process that we needed to kind

[55:05] of get a little bit of a head start on.

[55:09] Back when Spooky was first getting started, it was kind of me and then it was Ben and then

[55:14] it was like Scott and E.C. but it was always, time was always short.

[55:19] And we know that that isn't ideal situations, you know.

[55:22] The reason TNA came out so well is Scott had all the time in the world to develop that

[55:26] on his own before we picked it up.

[55:28] And it's an extremely good game.

[55:30] And I love Total Nuclear Annihilation.

[55:33] Like on my stuff, you know, I've taken a little flack for what Rob Zombie was.

[55:38] I still enjoy it.

[55:39] The dogs are flying through here at 100 miles an hour.

[55:42] I love it.

[55:43] But, you know, like on Alice Cooper and stuff, I think the game came out very well, but had

[55:48] I had more time.

[55:49] Could it have been better?

[55:50] Absolutely.

[55:51] So, it's something that we know going forward, we need to do better as well.

[55:55] And just stay ahead of it so that we have time to iron things out.

[55:59] If there is a tough shot, you have time to shift ballguards around and add a target here

[56:04] in there where a post once was and that kind of stuff.

[56:06] So, you know, stuff that people like.

[56:08] Yeah.

[56:09] Now, I've heard rumors of a TNA 2.0 that will be in the new cabinet.

[56:13] Is that happening?

[56:14] Will that happen over the next 18 months or is that something that might happen after

[56:18] this run of games?

[56:19] It definitely won't be the new cabinet, will it?

[56:22] New, it's the same cabinet.

[56:24] It'll be in a TNA cabinet, yes.

[56:26] Yeah, no, it'll be the same cabinet.

[56:28] There might be some subtle differences, but...

[56:29] I mean, you'll have the new display panel and stuff like that.

[56:32] Oh, that's an exclusive.

[56:33] Oh, there we go.

[56:34] Fifth Twitter.

[56:35] Who spank you for that?

[56:37] It is like, I got it.

[56:39] Finally.

[56:40] So, how much did it hurt for Stern to grab Godzilla, knowing how much you love it?

[56:49] You know, I'm over it.

[56:52] Are you...

[56:53] Here's the real thing.

[56:54] No, he's not.

[56:55] He's not.

[56:57] I'd like to have had that license, obviously, that I would never shy away from that.

[57:02] But the fact that Ultraman came out so freaking great is good.

[57:06] I mean, I love that.

[57:08] Now, if Keith Owen, and I just hear the rumors that I hear on Canatus Pinball podcast,

[57:14] if he's doing Godzilla and it's absolutely beautiful, I'm telling you right now, it'll

[57:18] sit right next to Ultraman and the fact that a truly great Toho Godzilla pinball machine

[57:24] exists is going to make me extremely happy.

[57:27] No, it's great to hear.

[57:28] And I wanted to ask each of you, if you had to buy a game from another manufacturer over

[57:34] the last few years, which game would each of you buy and why?

[57:39] I have an Ovarian of Guns and Roses.

[57:41] Okay.

[57:42] And a Monster Bash.

[57:43] And a Monster Bash.

[57:44] For each of you out there, what games have you been excited by?

[57:47] What game?

[57:48] Have I been excited about yours?

[57:50] I'm going to be real honest.

[57:52] I'd love to get a premise.

[57:55] Just because I love the band and Wollnelli has a special place in my heart because I have

[58:00] fun memories of dad being around Greg and Dennis when I was a lot younger than that one.

[58:05] And I just think Wollnelli's fun, but throwing premise on it's pretty cool.

[58:09] Yeah, that was back in the day, sitting in Greg's or Dennis' garage with Greg and Dennis

[58:15] and everybody helping finalize all those.

[58:17] So to see that kind of come full circle, that was neat.

[58:19] I'd take a medieval badness.

[58:21] Yeah, look, look, please, my medieval constantly.

[58:24] My biggest regret is I had a medieval madness royal edition for $10,000, right?

[58:31] That was what it cost.

[58:32] And I let it go.

[58:33] I was like, you know what?

[58:35] Let someone else have it.

[58:36] And now they're selling for like $19,000 like new unbox this year.

[58:40] So have you guys have seen like obviously the inflation happening?

[58:44] What are your thoughts on just the astronomical explosion of pricing in this hobby?

[58:50] Does it make you think like we're leaving money on the table?

[58:53] It makes me think people have too much money.

[58:55] No, I mean, like when I see what's going on with pirates and stuff, I mean, that's it's

[59:02] great for building confidence in buyers of new unbox games and, you know, Rick and Morty

[59:07] has been through some of that.

[59:09] And as a manufacturer, it doesn't hurt us at all.

[59:13] I mean, it definitely helps to kind of boost that buyer confidence.

[59:18] But as a pinball fan and, you know, obviously I have multiple manufacturers in my basement.

[59:23] I have my limits and, you know, there's no game that's worth over $X for me personally.

[59:30] But you know, if you've got that kind of money, more power to you, man, I'm never going

[59:33] to be grudged somebody for getting something they want.

[59:35] Well, look gentlemen, this has been episode 600, which is crazy of Gnados pinball podcast

[59:41] that I made it this far that they couldn't convince my employer to shut the show down.

[59:47] And I want to say I truly appreciate you guys taking the time.

[59:51] And I mean this from the bottom of my heart because most of these pinball manufacturers,

[59:56] they won't even talk to me.

[59:57] And I've truly and personally admired your ascension in the pinball world.

[01:00:04] Spooky pinball is no longer just a little boutique company.

[01:00:07] You guys are now in the upper echelon of pinball.

[01:00:10] So thank you so much.

[01:00:11] I think Gnados actually gushing over us.

[01:00:15] I'm still going to spoil your releases and week stuff.

[01:00:18] Don't get me wrong.

[01:00:20] I'm still hunting for you know that you'll always be there to leak our stuff 24 hours

[01:00:24] before we do.

[01:00:25] Yeah, I try.

[01:00:27] It's been harder and harder to get information.

[01:00:29] Everyone is very close lip these days.

[01:00:33] Any final words for the listeners of Gnados pinball podcasts that you would like to give

[01:00:37] them?

[01:00:38] Go down the line.

[01:00:39] Bug start with you.

[01:00:40] Yeah.

[01:00:41] I mean, if you want to see the games, like I said, we're going to try and get to as many

[01:00:44] shows as we can bring them to.

[01:00:45] I don't want to give exactly dates and places yet because it's just not my place to do

[01:00:50] it.

[01:00:51] Lots of people ask about what the works.

[01:00:53] But for real, come play the game for yourself.

[01:00:55] Catch us out the shows that we hopefully soon can announce that we're going to.

[01:00:58] Bug when's game play?

[01:00:59] When can you see gameplay video?

[01:01:01] Everyone's going to be like, just ask him that soon.

[01:01:03] Very soon.

[01:01:04] It's it's my number one priority right now at one each day.

[01:01:08] Two weeks a week, three weeks.

[01:01:10] It could be either one of those things.

[01:01:13] Three if you keep asking.

[01:01:14] Okay.

[01:01:15] Oh, bugs getting saucy.

[01:01:18] No, no, it really is.

[01:01:19] I want to get that out as soon as I possibly can.

[01:01:21] It's just a little bit more than I just got to hook up the camera and record.

[01:01:26] Luke, what do you say, brother?

[01:01:28] Um, I just hope everybody really likes the game.

[01:01:30] We're going to do the best job we can on the build and we'll just make adjustments

[01:01:33] throughout and do the best job we can.

[01:01:35] So Luke, and we're going to talk about it here, Luke.

[01:01:37] I'm not stopping.

[01:01:38] I'm my life one journey to get this theme.

[01:01:41] Who else we got on the horn right now?

[01:01:43] Me?

[01:01:44] Chuck, what do you think?

[01:01:45] Um, please stop leaking our stuff.

[01:01:47] Uh, you know, Chris, and I think honestly, I have talked to you at like Texas and stuff

[01:01:56] and sat there and, and I, I understand that Chris and Kaneda are, are a thing.

[01:02:03] You know, I understand why some manufacturers get frustrated and I have at times been

[01:02:09] one of those guys, but you are a very big part of the pinball community.

[01:02:13] We all know this and you know, not always wrong.

[01:02:16] And we know that too.

[01:02:17] And, and you know, sometimes that hurts a little bit, but at other times, you're, you

[01:02:24] know, like you've been with us here as of late when you see goodness, you talk goodness.

[01:02:29] And, uh, you know, I hope that it's nothing but goodness coming from spooky pinball.

[01:02:33] So we can, you know, keep everybody happy.

[01:02:36] Not just Kaneda.

[01:02:37] We want everybody to be happy.

[01:02:39] We want everybody to have that brand new game out of the box.

[01:02:43] Wonderful feeling that, uh, you're supposed to get from pinball and that's not an easy task

[01:02:48] and thank God I got these young guys sitting next to me that are up to the challenge.

[01:02:52] So, you know, we listen, we do listen.

[01:02:55] And when it is negative, we learn from it.

[01:02:57] We don't hide from it.

[01:02:58] We're going to do what we can to make everything better.

[01:03:02] So that, uh, you know, it's, it should be all about peace, love and pinball.

[01:03:06] I say that all the time, but I mean it, you know, there's no reason for us for, for

[01:03:11] anything else that's life's too short.

[01:03:13] Get out there, play games with your friends and have a good time.

[01:03:16] That's what pinball is all about.

[01:03:18] Absolutely.

[01:03:19] You hear that, ladies and gentlemen, what he was trying to say is there are going to be

[01:03:21] no washer kits sent to you from spooky pinball because the play fields are perfect.

[01:03:27] Charlie and company, I thank you so much for coming on and being a part of this special

[01:03:31] episode 600.

[01:03:33] And I'm super excited to get my ultra man pinball machine number 500 one day.

[01:03:38] Thank you so much for joining the show.

[01:03:41] And for being spooky pinball, the goodwill you've built with the community is speaking volumes

[01:03:46] and it's the best marketing you can do.

[01:03:48] I always say this like your transparency and your product have been the best thing you

[01:03:53] can possibly do to win people over and you've done it.

[01:03:56] So thank you for being a part of this community.

[01:03:58] And as someone who covers it, it's nice to have a company as transparent as you a part

[01:04:03] of this community.

[01:04:04] So thank you.

[01:04:05] I appreciate it, man.

[01:04:06] Thank you, Chris.

[01:04:07] Thank you very much.

[01:04:08] All right.

[01:04:09] So what do we do now?

[01:04:10] Should we just end it?

[01:04:11] Yeah.

[01:04:12] Let's just call Ben Heck right now because Ben's always nervous that he says too much.

[01:04:14] He's a wild card.

[01:04:15] He's a wild card.

[01:04:16] He's a wild card.

[01:04:17] He's a wild card.

[01:04:18] He's a wild card.

[01:04:19] He's a wild card.

[01:04:20] Yeah.

[01:04:21] He's a wild card.

[01:04:22] He's a wild card.

[01:04:23] He's a wild card.

[01:04:24] He's a wild card.

[01:04:25] He's a wild card.

[01:04:26] He's a wild card.

[01:04:27] Being a Ben Heck episode takes me like 8 hours to edit 40 minutes of Ben Heck because

[01:04:32] he literally doesn't put a full sentence together.

[01:04:35] I got a stringing it together, but it's going to be fun.

[01:04:38] You ought to try designing a game with him sometime and watch him go from, hey, do you think

[01:04:42] we should put this view K over?

[01:04:44] Did you see the new John Wick movie?

[01:04:46] It's just off the rail.

[01:04:49] But it's not realistic.

[01:04:50] I don't know.

[01:04:51] What about the chicken sandwich, a big Mac?

[01:04:53] That thing's so overrated.

[01:04:54] No.

[01:04:55] He's got mountain deune.

[01:04:56] Well, gentlemen, thank you so much and have a great evening and hopefully we'll talk soon before like I don't know episode

[01:05:03] 700 or something, but always a good time. All right, man. Thank you. We appreciate it

[01:05:26] Okay
