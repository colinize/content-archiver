[00:00] This is what everybody that did not listen to Canada is gonna be singing in two weeks when they try to get a Beetlejuice.

[00:07] ["If you love me, say goodbye, you'll be something missing in my life, cause you know, with all I believe, all I miss is you."

[00:30] on three hours of sleep after watching the greatest baseball game I've ever

[00:35] seen. Seven hours long congratulations to the Dodgers. My gosh what a game but I'm

[00:43] looking not at baseball. I'm looking at Beetlejuice baby with a B and I'm

[00:49] starting to see something happening in this hobby I haven't seen in a very long

[00:55] time. I'm starting to see panic. I'm starting to see fear. I'm starting to see

[01:01] anxiety. I'm seeing excitement. I'm seeing grown men who are gonna be told they

[01:09] can't have something. This is the best part of FOMO. When you take grown men who

[01:16] have the money and you tell them I'm sorry but you can't have one I am sold

[01:24] out. We're gonna talk about something that's interesting on this episode of

[01:28] Canada's Pinball Podcast. I just had a great conversation with Luke for about a

[01:32] half hour this morning. I wanted to get some clarity around something I wanted

[01:37] to talk about. It is the fact that there are gonna be in the pinball world.

[01:42] There's gonna be a little bit more than 999 Beetlejuices. There's gonna be some

[01:49] show games. Now they've talked about this in the past. Napsarcade had a story

[01:53] about this. These games are gonna be on top of the 999. Now you might ask

[01:59] yourself what's the point of a show game if the game is sold out? What's the point

[02:04] of a great Zachman feature if the game is sold out? Now there is no need for any

[02:11] marketing around this game. It is spoken for and I've been speaking about this

[02:16] game now for many many months. I've been telling people for many many months get

[02:21] on the list to get a game and I think some people slept on that. I think some

[02:26] people didn't realize that I was being serious but it's a multitude of factors

[02:32] that has led to this game being already sold out well before the November 14th

[02:38] reveal of the game. The factors are easy to understand. You've got the biggest

[02:43] pinball company in the world making some of the most mediocre pinball machine

[02:47] ever in stern pinball. I think people are bored not just with Star Wars. I think

[02:52] they're bored with Stern's overall approach. I think they're bored with

[02:56] Stern games always looking the same. I think they're bored with like the art

[03:00] decisions. They're bored with the layouts. They're bored with a lot of what

[03:04] Stern is doing and they're just very bored of losing money and these

[03:08] unlimited run sort of games that just don't hold any value. On the boutique

[03:13] front we just got Winchester's Mystery House. A lot of excitement right. Sold

[03:17] 525 games in two days. That is a great indicator of where the market is at.

[03:24] You've got thousands of starving collectors that haven't had anything

[03:30] that's made them feel special in a very long time and you drop Winchester into

[03:36] the pinball world and in two days it does more and creates more excitement more

[03:41] lines than games like King Kong then games like Dune. You know Harry Potter is

[03:47] kind of like a game that we don't talk about much but Harry Potter did its job.

[03:51] Harry Potter is one of the biggest IPs in pinball. Jersey Jack made a beautiful

[03:56] game. Jersey Jack made a game that shoots very well. A lot of people ordered

[04:00] Harry Potter. A lot of people ordered Harry Potter CE. I think the number might

[04:04] be somewhere around 3,000 Harry Potter CE's. On top of that you're gonna get all

[04:10] those wizard additions and arcade additions. So it's not gonna be limited and

[04:14] so you set up this environment in which well no Harry Potter CE is really

[04:18] collectible because there's so many of them and then you still sort of have this

[04:22] white space where a collector somebody that wants something a little bit

[04:27] different a little bit off of the norm doesn't really have anything anymore

[04:32] that truly excites them and then you get a game like Evil Dead right. Remember

[04:37] Evil Dead did not sell out instantly. It's a game that took a while to sell all

[04:43] 888. It took a few months but once they were gone and once they were spoken for

[04:49] I think what happened with Evil Dead was interesting because I think people

[04:52] expected a lot more from Elwin's King Kong. It never arrived and then nobody

[04:59] else really came out with anything other than Harry Potter that really wowed the

[05:04] pinball world and when you stood back whether or not you liked Evil Dead as a

[05:08] theme or not there's a moment I think with everybody when you stood back and

[05:12] you looked at Evil Dead and you saw the game and it was a wide body there are

[05:16] all these mechs in it and there's so much going on I would argue there's way

[05:20] more going on mechanically in Evil Dead than there is in Harry Potter. There just

[05:24] is and you look at the game and franchise art and all the detail and it

[05:28] just like regardless if you like the theme or not it just became a pin that

[05:32] just excited people it was gorgeous it was sexy still a little bit of an

[05:37] obscure theme for most people but man what a package right what an overall

[05:43] package and I think that's where pinball is at now is like we're looking for

[05:46] companies to deliver an overall package that just feels special and so here we

[05:52] are on the eve of Beetlejuice one of the worst kept secrets in pinball and

[05:58] they are making 999 and then a little bit more let's talk about this so you

[06:04] don't need to market this game it's sold out you don't need any feature at videos

[06:09] it's gonna be great Zach's gonna do a great job it's gonna get people even

[06:12] more excited and unfortunately for Spooky and I told this to Luke they are

[06:17] now in a position where anybody over 999 is gonna be disappointed when they get

[06:25] excited because they can't get a game now that's not true I have as an

[06:30] exclusive on this show the total number of show games they are going to make now

[06:36] this is a number of games that is gonna be on top of the 999 and I told this to

[06:41] Luke and I'll tell it to you I'm not the biggest fan of this approach I think

[06:47] what makes limited edition anything nice is a finite number of them and that's

[06:54] it I have one of only 999 in the world there's something special about feeling

[07:02] like you own something that there's not even a thousand of and now there's gonna

[07:07] be more I'm gonna tell you the number in a second but it just spoils a little

[07:11] bit being a member of that exclusive club because now you've made another

[07:16] exclusive club to the side on these show games and look for the collector out

[07:21] there is the show game now the super elite is no different but you know how we

[07:27] are like a little plaque that's different is only gonna be this many of those

[07:31] show games and there's always gonna be less show games than normal numbered

[07:37] games but I don't think it's really gonna matter much because again I think the

[07:41] demand for this game is so astronomical the demand is in the thousands and so

[07:47] they're not gonna make anywhere near what the demand for this game is not even

[07:52] close you know they're not even gonna scratch the itch of the amount of people

[07:56] that are gonna want this game once they see it not to mention all the newbies

[07:59] and rich doctors and lawyers who are gonna see Zach's video or get a Beetlejuice

[08:05] pinball ad and then want one and then be told there's none available that's just

[08:11] gonna create even more and more demand for this game so you don't need to market

[08:16] a game that's already sold out and yet there's gonna be marketing and so here

[08:20] let me just tell you right now here are the number of show games that are gonna

[08:24] be built confirmed by Luke and the crew over at spooky the number of Beetlejuice

[08:30] show games before I give you the number I just want to say they made a few show

[08:33] games for Rick and Morty I think they made around like maybe 20 Rick and Morty

[08:38] show games that were outside of the 750 numbered games now when they did Evil

[08:44] Dead here's the thing the recent release the show versions of Evil Dead were part

[08:50] of the 888 games what was annoying people let's say you had Evil Dead number

[08:57] 500 and you went to a show and you saw a show game with a number 758 on it and

[09:06] then all of a sudden you're crying like a baby because why is there a show game

[09:11] that is numbered later than my game and I still don't have my game yet and I could

[09:17] buy this show game today off the floor so people were complaining about that you

[09:23] know look it's just the way it works with like allocations and numbers like you

[09:27] know because if you're them you've got 888 on an Excel grid and you know that

[09:32] like Joe Newhart's gonna get game number one through 30 Zach gets game number 30

[09:36] through 80 whatever it is this show games are later in the builds and you need

[09:40] to bring stuff to a show 758 goes to the show before we even get number 500 on the

[09:47] line I guess that's how they were doing it now here's the thing this is gonna be

[09:50] different this is gonna be a lot more than 20 it was funny because I was

[09:55] talking to Luke today it is like you know we're not quite sure how many the

[09:57] total is gonna be and I was like look man just just need a number you just need

[10:02] a number because what you need to do and the reason why you need a number is the

[10:05] people that are collecting these things just need to know how many in total

[10:09] there's gonna be and as a company what's made spooky's good will so strong is

[10:15] they've never made more games after they said they were never gonna make more

[10:19] games and I told Luke I never want to see you guys go against your word so it is

[10:25] important that you are 100% transparent and you hold your word on this number so

[10:31] the total number of Beetlejuice show games a game that is sold out that doesn't

[10:36] even need to market itself there's gonna be 80 of them 80 now that's a lot like

[10:42] it's not insignificant when you think about it making 80 games to take to shows

[10:48] around the country when this game is sold out they're gonna be making it for

[10:53] years seems like a high number to me and I told that to Luke I'm not so sure I

[10:58] would have done so many and I'm not even sure why there are even show games

[11:04] because the analogy I use is a car you man if Ferrari makes 100 limited edition

[11:10] versions of a new car that everybody wants they only make 100 they don't send

[11:16] to each Ferrari dealership a car so people can test drive it and then buy

[11:23] that showroom car that's on top of the 100 they said they were gonna make it

[11:29] just dilutes the specialness of being one of only this many so now we've got in

[11:36] total 1079 Beetlejuice's will be made in total when I say it like that it doesn't

[11:44] sound like a lot right it's like when you look at 80 in a vacuum like 80 more

[11:48] games like what are they doing like they're totally screwing over the

[11:51] collectors 1079 does that make anybody really upset is that gonna change the

[11:57] secondhand value on any of these games absolutely not do I think the show

[12:02] plaque games are gonna be worth more I don't I just think this demand is so

[12:08] through the roof and I think the dealers and the distros were coming at them

[12:13] hard to get a little bit more because here's what's happening already and I

[12:17] don't like this because if you're calling something a show game that game

[12:22] should have to be on the show floor and it's almost impossible for them to

[12:27] police it I was telling this to Luke I'm like well why don't you make it so if

[12:31] you give Joe Newhart 10 show games for Allentown which is his show that he has

[12:37] to share a photo of 10 Beetlejuice machines lined up at the show turned on

[12:44] for people to play like if you're gonna call it a show game require that it's

[12:48] actually set up at a show it's hard to do it because what's happening already is

[12:52] this these dealers are selling already these show games as part of their

[12:59] allotment to their screaming customers that are crying that they did not get

[13:06] one of the 999 and so what they're being told is look I'm sold out of my

[13:11] original allotment but I'm getting 10 show games and I can sell you one of

[13:16] those and so now you know you've just given dealers more inventory you've

[13:21] added a little bit more saturation to the number of games that are available and

[13:25] look all those show games are going to be gone anyway if they're not gone

[13:28] already I don't think anyone has any spots available whether it's a show game

[13:33] or not you know if I were a dealer alright if you're gonna take this take it

[13:37] all the way that's my thing if you're gonna take this whole thing about

[13:40] demand and we need a few more then take it all the way what is with this like

[13:45] halfway like if your demand is through the roof and I'm gonna give you a show

[13:50] game and I'm gonna put this on the showroom floor just like a car have you

[13:54] ever tried to buy a hot automobile off a dealership showroom floor there is

[13:59] something called a market adjusted price so my thing is this I'd rather

[14:04] everybody just go all the way if I'm gonna give Joe Newhart 10 Beetlejuice

[14:09] games for Allamintown then Joe just go all the way list those games with a

[14:15] market adjusted price at the show if you want one and these things are sold

[14:20] out you're gonna sell that game for $9,999 why why why doesn't everyone just

[14:27] stop complaining about the normal market forces at play and actually just add an

[14:32] ADM and adjusted markup on the game so the show game if you wanted a game that's

[14:38] been sold out now for weeks or months and you can't get your hands on one then

[14:43] this game is not 999 maybe it's got an additional three to $5,000 marked up on

[14:48] the game because that's what the market will bear you know what I'm saying like

[14:52] just go all in I love that when we get into these situations we're all trying

[14:57] to be like yeah well you know everything comes with like a story and a little bit

[15:01] of spin but the truth is this three to five thousand people are gonna want this

[15:05] game there's 1079 and unfortunately for spooky what's gonna happen in two weeks

[15:11] is they are gonna upset more people than they make happy and I feel bad for them

[15:15] because they're gonna get a lot of complaining a lot of moaning and

[15:20] groaning and then what's gonna happen is this there are gonna be people that

[15:23] got a spot that they were speculating a little bit and they're gonna want to

[15:28] sell their game for a profit and you know what Luke said to me he's like that's

[15:31] fine it doesn't upset me that I see people scalp our games or sell them for

[15:37] more money that's a sign of a healthy product it's a sign of a healthy brand

[15:42] and it's a sign of a healthy collector base I am so tired of the babies in this

[15:48] hobby that when they get locked out of a game and they see someone sell it for a

[15:53] profit they kick and scream like children whoever got that game got that game

[16:00] fair and square these dealers got those show games fair and square because

[16:07] guess what they do this for a living you don't if some content creators get a

[16:13] game and you didn't get one guess what I've done 1150 shows about pinball I've

[16:19] been talking about this game for a year telling everybody to get on a list you

[16:23] think I'm on the same exact line that you're on and now you're gonna whine

[16:27] about not getting a game you know many times people threaten me they threaten

[16:31] me if I ever want to sell something for more than I paid they threaten to quit

[16:36] my show I'm leaving it's not fair meanwhile they're gonna go buy games

[16:41] from distributors and make those guys millionaires because they're getting

[16:44] thousands of dollars in margins on every single game they're just dropshipping

[16:47] and there's no problem with that but I'm doing this thing every single month the

[16:52] amount of hours every single week the amount of times you know I'm like not

[16:55] even seeing my family in the morning because I'm doing this right now for

[16:58] you guys it's a free market and we should fight for the free market and we

[17:03] should celebrate the free market forces and we should find it fun that spooky

[17:09] pinball can now make a game that people would even consider spending 15 on 16 on

[17:14] 18 on and stop complaining and maybe everybody needs to just like do what you

[17:20] got to do to get one and look I think spooky is in a really interesting

[17:25] situation right now what I would do if I were them I don't love the show games I

[17:28] don't I told this to Luke I don't like it I think it's not normal because I was

[17:33] like yeah man just show me where Stern's got like all these show games they

[17:36] don't do it they don't do it there's like maybe one or two games they make that

[17:41] maybe they send out to one of their big like distros but that's it there's not

[17:45] 20 extra stern lees as show games I think it's a practice that needs to stop I

[17:52] told this to Luke you know do it this time get past it but don't do this just

[17:57] figure out a way where like the numbered plaque games are the only things out in

[18:02] the world I don't like this sort of arbitrary additional amount now I'm

[18:08] happy that he said 80 because I was worried about what I really was worried

[18:12] about was he wasn't gonna say how many in total before the 14th and then like

[18:19] every year if there's like more shows and then more beetle juices just start

[18:23] popping up with show game like plaques on them and then nobody really knows how

[18:28] many show games are in the world they're gonna be serial numbered we're gonna know

[18:34] there's gonna be one through 80 of those okay but man it's like we're about to get

[18:40] to a place where everyone's gonna start complaining everyone's gonna start

[18:44] whining you know and like I've got five games I'm sitting on five games that I

[18:49] want to figure out what to do with I've got some listeners coming up to me

[18:53] saying hey because they gave more money you know who I'm talking about not gonna

[18:57] name names because they've contributed more money to the show that they should

[19:01] get one of those five I never said that's how it works I'm really happy for

[19:06] people that give a lot of money to the show who give more than most and yeah I

[19:09] do agree with what my friend said he's like Chris it's ridiculous five dollars

[19:13] a month ridiculous for all the work you do it's ridiculous and he's got a point

[19:17] he's got a point and I'm not here trying to say if you increase your amount you're

[19:21] gonna get a game that's not how it's gonna work we're gonna do something fun we

[19:24] don't have to get it right away spooky's like Chris you got it I think I have game

[19:28] number 999 and that's gonna be fun I'm the last of the serial numbered games but

[19:34] we're gonna figure out like what to do we're gonna see games being scalped and

[19:38] I'm just telling you right now don't lose your cool you're gonna see people

[19:43] asking 5000 over sticker for a spot I mean it's just the way it is it's just

[19:47] the way it is you're gonna see people asking five thousand dollars over for a

[19:52] Beetlejuice spot and you're also gonna see the following you're gonna see people

[19:56] get it you're gonna see people get it the amount of money in this hobby the

[20:01] amount of people with money in this hobby is way greater than 999 it's just

[20:07] way greater than that and the world's so damn expensive and I think people are

[20:11] really gonna want this I think they're really gonna want it when they see it I

[20:14] think it's gonna create a frenzy and I think spooky's biggest challenge moving

[20:18] forward is how do they like navigate this now they're not used to this level of

[20:23] FOMO and success but in talking the Luke I have nothing but confidence in them

[20:29] and confidence in the fact that they found their size they found the amount of

[20:34] games they want to make a year they found their groove and they don't feel this

[20:39] like pressure to grow and they definitely are not gonna try to take as much of

[20:45] that second hand value for themselves and that is gonna be their biggest

[20:51] challenge is to stay true to that because if you're then what you want to see

[20:55] when you make this $10,000 Beetlejuice you know with ButterCabinet and Topper

[21:01] $13,000 which you want to see is them selling for $18,000 what you don't want to

[21:06] do is then charge $13,000 to $15,000 as a base price for the next game because you

[21:12] could possibly do that it's just the way to do it just because you can do

[21:17] something doesn't mean you should and there's no greater example of that than

[21:22] Stern Pimbal everything they could have done they did do for the worse and they've

[21:29] turned their company into a product that has made everybody who buys from them a

[21:34] loser right a fiscal loser and I don't care how much the gameplay is supposedly

[21:40] exciting you you never lost that much money in the 12 years you supported

[21:44] Stern Pimbal that I've been following this hobby and now all of a sudden you're a

[21:48] big loser and now all of a sudden 1079 people are gonna be lucky enough to get

[21:54] a Beetlejuice and that $9,000 game or $10,000 game is gonna be worth overnight

[22:00] $15,000 or more thousand dollars it's just gonna happen you're literally gonna

[22:04] get a 50% return on your investment that is gonna be like evergreen I think it's

[22:09] gonna be inelastic I don't think it's gonna go away I think the next game is

[22:13] gonna be even better and if I were spooky I would do this remember the old

[22:16] Fang Club for 50 bucks 50 bucks man you go to McDonald's it's like 50 bucks what

[22:21] I would do if I were them knowing that there is gonna be this tremendous

[22:25] demand for their future titles and there's gonna be I would start a new sort

[22:31] of Fang Club that's not tiptoeing the reality of what they got I would charge

[22:37] $1,000 for a guarantee to buy the next three games I would do $1,000 to buy the

[22:45] next three games and you have first dibs now that $1,000 is non-refundable and

[22:51] that $1,000 does not apply to your deposit it is simply $1,000 to be a VIP

[23:01] first online person forget the 50 bucks you know what they were to do this after

[23:06] seeing what happens with Beetlejuice in two weeks the amount of people that would

[23:12] happily pay that for just the peace of mind to not have to go through what

[23:18] they're gonna go through in two weeks because you know you all know this

[23:22] you're gonna end up spending way more than $1,000 over to get this game if you

[23:28] didn't get one ladies and gentlemen it's about to get crazy we're gonna see a

[23:32] level of pinball community excitement and pinball community anger all at the

[23:37] same time I think we're gonna see a game that I've been predicting to be the

[23:42] game that's gonna set a new bar for a lot of people and I think the changing of

[23:47] the guard is not coming I think the changing of the guard is here I think

[23:52] it's a three-horse race now where the excitement lies in all of pinball I

[23:56] think it's Jersey Jack pinball I think it's spooky pinball and I'm gonna put

[24:01] barrels of fun in it right now Dutch pinball they'll be in that race when they

[24:05] get back to the future going but for now it's like when I say what pinball

[24:10] company is exciting you the most what pinball company is surprising you the

[24:14] most what pinball company is giving you the best value nobody is saying stern

[24:19] anywhere nobody and they've got no way out and this game is gonna bury their

[24:25] hole even deeper I'm super excited for the people over at spooky I can't wait

[24:30] I've got my popcorn ready for the 14th and I think we might get a little bit

[24:34] something on Halloween maybe just a little bit something a little bit more I

[24:38] think I would tease a little bit give us something more to chew on guys a little

[24:41] bit of the cabinet artwork the back box something but you know Halloween

[24:45] spooky I think it's gonna be an amazing week for them and I don't want to be in

[24:50] their shoes on the 14th when the damn breaks just sing this song as you

[24:56] realize you should have listened to canada when I told you to get on a list
