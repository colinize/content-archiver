[00:00] May I share something with you? A vision I had in my sleep last night. I was distinguished

[00:07] from a dream which is mere sorting and cataloging of the days vented by the subconscious. This

[00:13] was a vision. Presion clears the mountain stream. The mind revealing itself to itself.

[00:24] In my vision, I was on the veranda of a vast estate, a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.

[00:33] There seemed to emanate from it a light from within this gleaming radiant marble. I had

[00:43] known this place. I had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return,

[00:51] a reunion with the deepest well springs of my being. Wondering about, I noticed happily

[01:02] that the house had been immaculately maintained. I had been added a number of additional rooms,

[01:08] but in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction, one would never

[01:16] detect any difference. Returning to the house's grand foyer, I came and knocked at the door.

[01:23] My son was standing there. He was happy and carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony

[01:39] and joy. We embraced warm and loving embrace. Nothing was held. We were in this moment one.

[01:53] My vision ended. I awoke with a tremendous feeling of optimism and confidence in you

[02:12] and your future. That was my vision of you. Yeah. I'm so glad to have had this opportunity to share it with you.

[02:26] Wish you nothing but the very best in all things. Thank you, dad. See you later, Paul. Okay.

[02:49] Ah, you're like, what's going on, Kaneda? Well, look, we lost one of the most creative people in

[02:54] the world yesterday and Mr. David Lynch. And if we think people are creative in pinball,

[02:59] oh my gosh, right? It's like when you zoom out a little bit and see the stuff out in the real world,

[03:04] it's crazy what we spend for the creativity we get. But we're going to talk about what's going on

[03:10] in pinball. We're going to go around the horn, but that's not why you're listening to this show.

[03:15] This show is all going to be about you want one thing. You want some information on Harry Potter.

[03:21] I have information on Harry Potter. Whether or not it's the information you want, you can decide on

[03:27] that. But this is confirmed information, right? Coming from Kaneda. He's confirming this information

[03:33] for you. You haven't heard this anywhere else. And look, I think there's going to be some mixed

[03:39] results when I tell you what I'm going to tell you about this Harry Potter game. But before we do

[03:44] that, let's do what we normally do. Let's go around the pinball horn. Talk about the pinball news

[03:49] and what's going on in the pinball world. How does that sound, everybody? All right, let's get right

[03:54] to it. So let's start with Stern pinball. We'll start with Metallica. Metallica Remastered has had a

[04:00] code update. They've put a lot more into the game. The owners are loving this game. The vibe around

[04:05] this Metallica game is so damn positive. People are like, I think I'm going to play this game 25,000

[04:11] times this year. Good. That's what you should be doing with this amazing game. If you buy a

[04:18] Metallica LE and you're afraid to play it or you're going to sell it in just a few years with

[04:24] under 200 plays, you, sir, did not live. You didn't do it the right way. I want to see people with

[04:31] five, six, seven thousand plays on your games. And here's the reason why you have to play your games

[04:38] this many times to battle back against the extreme depreciating prices of all these games. But Metallica

[04:44] LE is not really depreciating, but we're starting to see a little bit of the price come down on the

[04:50] second hand market. These things were going for 17, 18,000 new in box. Now that they're opened up,

[04:57] I just saw an opened one for sale for, I think it was 16, five. That won't last very long because

[05:04] that's the cheapest, that's the cheapest second hand price I've seen for Metallica since the game

[05:09] has been out. But again, great reviews, a little sort of sound issues with the new code update.

[05:13] They need to adjust some of the volumes. I'm never sure how these things get out the door with like

[05:19] volume issues on code updates. Like, didn't they listen to it? Like, how are we giving them this

[05:24] feedback that some of the volumes are off on some of the moments in the game? All right, we got Dungeons

[05:30] and Dragons LE. It's on the line. It's going to be making its way out the customers any day now.

[05:36] Stern gets these things out so quickly. Remember, they can make all LEs, all 740 of them can be

[05:43] made in a week and a half. So you're going to see all of them hit in the world. Now, people are

[05:48] saying something interesting. They're saying that this game, and distros are saying this, this game

[05:53] is selling better than Jaws Pimball sold. I don't get that. How is that possible? By this time, Jaws

[06:01] would have sold out all of its 1000 LEs. They have not sold all the Dungeons and Dragons LEs.

[06:08] So what does that mean? Maybe the premiums are selling better than Jaws premiums sold?

[06:12] I don't get why anyone runs at a premium on day one. I mean, really, I really don't get it. I really

[06:17] would love to drink a lot of whiskey and get inside the head of a dude who orders a premium on day one.

[06:25] You might as well just wait a few months and see how the market on the game shakes out. It makes no

[06:33] sense to me. They're going to be making D&D premiums from now until 2000, like 29. Like,

[06:41] why get one right now? We all know they're going to make like 2000 premiums of this game by the

[06:47] end of the year. They're going to be easy to get. But I don't buy that. Do you buy that? Do you believe

[06:52] that D&D is more popular than Jaws? The theme's not more popular than Jaws. Keith Elwin's got more

[07:00] of a following than Brian Eddy, but I will say this. This is Stern's strongest effort in a long

[07:07] time. And that's good. And sales should reflect that. This is also Stern's most amazing mech they've

[07:13] put in a game in a really long time. And I think what we're seeing is that even though it's not

[07:19] like a take my money now theme for most people, it's also not a complete turnoff theme for most

[07:26] people. And it's in a thematic space that you could warm up to. Dragons, knights, wizards,

[07:32] dungeons, all that stuff works just fine for the pinball buying demographic. And I really do think

[07:38] people are just kind of like finally a little bit excited again about the efforts Stern put into

[07:44] this game. And when you look at the mechanics of D&D, it clearly has way more mechanical,

[07:50] magical stuff and fun stuff to look at than Jaws pinball. I mean that like when you look at Jaws

[07:56] and you just think about the game itself, the mechanical stuff is a snooze fest. Like there's

[08:01] nothing in Jaws mechanically that is actually exciting to see exciting to shoot. And I think

[08:10] that was a big mistake with Jaws. We all know this if Jaws had a much more interesting mechanical

[08:17] shark that did what this dragon does, we would all be much more excited about the game and the game

[08:23] would have sold much better. It really would have. I mean they missed the mark on Jaws mechanically.

[08:29] And I get that the code is there, but they needed the code to be amazing because the

[08:33] damn mechanical stuff was really uninspired. But we shall see, but what's interesting now gang,

[08:39] in just a few weeks, by the time these D&D start making their way out the door and Dwight is

[08:45] adjusting the dungeon layout every Sunday, all of the conversation is going to quickly turn to the

[08:53] next juggernaut game. King Kong from Keith Elwyn. Are we finally going to see Spike 3? I'm telling

[09:00] you right now, Spike 3 is not going to be something that you like finally see the light and there's

[09:05] some huge difference in the game. It's all going to be the internal computing power of the game.

[09:12] And I'm not even sure you're going to notice it. I don't think the screen size is going to be any

[09:18] different. I think the only thing you're really going to notice when Spike 3 Kong comes out

[09:23] is a price increase. That'll be the thing you feel the most. That's going to be where the

[09:28] conversation goes in just a few weeks. Now I popped into a place that I tippy-toed into this place

[09:35] because you don't really want to, if you're in a good mood, you don't want to run to this place

[09:38] because the moment you go into this thread, it is like, it's where you don't want to be.

[09:44] And I always think about pinball themes in terms of like, what's the vibe like in the thread of the

[09:51] game itself? It's an interesting way to approach this entire hobby, right? I feel like all of us

[09:56] want to buy a game where the game gives us what we want and makes us happy. But when you go into the

[10:02] community of people that own that game, it's actually a fun place to be because that's what

[10:08] makes owning a game for many, many months and maybe many, many years a lot more fun when the

[10:14] owners and the community and the vibe within that game is positive for the most part. And I'm just

[10:20] going to give you an example and don't kill me, but Guns N' Roses, for the most part, if you go into

[10:26] the owner thread, it's been very, very positive and people really, really enjoy the game. And all

[10:32] the haters and the naysayers, they can't really hang out there anymore because nobody wants to hear

[10:36] from them. Alright, so when I go into a thread that is X-Men, it is the opposite of good vibes.

[10:45] It is a community that is divided. It is a lot of people that want to love the game, but can't.

[10:52] A lot of people trying to problem solve the issues with the game. A lot of unhappy owners that are

[10:58] hearing Stern is now allocating more resources to D&D, which means they're taking resources away

[11:06] from X-Men. I bet you we see the Dungeons and Dragons topper before we see the topper for X-Men.

[11:13] And I think people are starting to realize that this thing might not turn around, that it just

[11:18] might be too frustrating for Stern to have to deal with all the issues and they can't fix it. Like

[11:24] Weissen set the code on a course that can't be corrected. And it's at the point now where people

[11:29] are just trying to figure out how to fix the game themselves. And I saw Pinside or Pinjammin,

[11:35] he did this interesting thing. He got all the pinballs that are out there available to buy and

[11:41] put in your game. He got all the different pinballs and he did a test to see how the auto plunger

[11:47] would work if you switch the different balls into the games. And he did like 250 auto plunges. I

[11:55] don't know, maybe it was 25. That sounds like a lot. But anyway, he recorded the success rate

[12:00] on the different pinballs and one ball had a success rate of 86%. Not bad, right? 86%. Still

[12:08] not 100, but 86%. But then at the bottom, at the bottom was a success rate of 6%. Is that crazy?

[12:16] Depending on what ball you put in this game, you can go from an 86% success rate to a 6%.

[12:22] That's not good. A pinball machine should not be designed in such a way in which it's that sensitive

[12:32] to what ball you put in it. Oh man, and I just feel for all of you X-Men guys, because the art is

[12:38] beautiful, the layout was unique. And I know you want to love this game so much. And I know now

[12:44] you're going to witness all the resources go elsewhere. And I know now a lot of you are feeling

[12:50] like I need to get out of this game. I need to list this game on the market. And it's so painful

[12:57] to buy such a beautiful stern machine and just get destroyed on the resale value because I don't

[13:04] know anyone out there who's like, I got to get my hands on one. And that's the problem is like the

[13:09] vibe is so bad and the demand to get one is just not there. I know this is crushing the Jack Danger.

[13:16] And I think he's going to come back out with his next game and do something absolutely to

[13:22] recover from this moment. I also think he's probably yelling at the management over at Stern,

[13:28] how could you give me this code team? And how could we deliver just this? Like it's not fair.

[13:34] Like I deserved more than this. And he's right. He did. He deserved a better software team and

[13:41] a better direction on this game. He also deserved to have more time. And I think time was taken from

[13:48] him and it bit them in the rear end. Alright, so that's what's going on over at Stern as we wait

[13:53] for King Kong. Spooky Pimble. Evil Dead is on the line. There was a post on Facebook. Go look at the

[14:00] production line over at Spooky Pimble. They're making right now Scooby-Doo's, Texas Chainsaw

[14:07] Massacre. They're also making Evil Dead and they just have like a lineup of games and they're ready

[14:12] to go out to customers and they're all lit up. The lights are off and OMG man. You know what's crazy

[14:18] about Spooky when you see him in a lineup? Their light shows are 10 times better than Stern. They've

[14:24] got maybe the best light shows going in Pimble right now. I think the light show in Evil Dead

[14:29] is more impressive than the light show in Avatar. It is a really beautiful pin and it's still not

[14:35] sold out. Right? Is it crazy? It's crazy to me. I mean I don't even like Evil Dead at all and every

[14:41] time I see one I want it just a little bit more. But I think again they've only got to sell like

[14:47] another few hundred, another couple hundred maybe 150. You know I don't know if they're going to sell

[14:52] them really because everyone knows they're at the back of the line. You're going to be able to get one

[14:57] because by the time people start unboxing their Evil Dead's they're going to land somewhere in a

[15:02] world of Harry Potter and King Kong and another game from Barrels. Like it's going to get really

[15:08] crowded really fast. Everybody take my word for it. It's going to be a buyer's market not a seller's

[15:14] market, a buyer's market. 2025 is going to be defined by a year in which if you're just a little bit

[15:22] patient you're going to be able to have such access to so many new things. I don't know if they're

[15:27] good or not right. I'm not going to say you're going to have access to great games because I don't

[15:32] know if they're good or not and history has shown us when our expectations are sky high we are usually

[15:39] disappointed in this hobby. Alright the other thing about spooky is this we know it's not Goonies next.

[15:45] Christopher Franci on the record it is bigger than Goonies. It is most likely going to be Beetlejuice.

[15:51] Both Beetlejuice and Gremlins were bigger at the box office than Goonies. Also when you think about

[15:59] spooky and the themes they like to make. Goonies isn't really in that spooky sort of realm right.

[16:07] It's not like a scary kind of movie. It doesn't have the kind of like vibe that they go for. I think

[16:14] Gremlins yes much more spooky in theme. Same thing with Beetlejuice absolutely right. All the dead

[16:20] people and the spirits and the ghouls and the ghost. It's all there like Beetlejuice is basically

[16:27] a ghost. So like I think it's going to be Beetlejuice you know and look and that's not going to surprise

[16:31] anybody and I think Beetlejuice for spooky pinball is going to be a sellout within an hour. They're

[16:37] not going to be able to take people's money fast enough and Franci on Beetlejuice is going to be

[16:42] killer. If it was Gremlins not going to move the needle nearly as much as Beetlejuice but it'll still

[16:49] do well but I think out of those three it would absolutely in order of preference. I think Beetlejuice

[16:56] and Goonies is kind of equal a little bit in terms of demand amongst this buying demographic.

[17:03] Gremlins is a third for sure but it's still I take it right. I would take a Gremlins over

[17:09] Evil Dead over Rob Zombie over Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It got me thinking do they even have

[17:15] Goonies. I mean if someone's got it and then we heard on Jason Napp's site that Multimorphic

[17:21] looked into the Goonies license and it was available at some point and the assets you could get for

[17:28] the game were not great and they moved on from it. It's got me a little bit nervous. It's got me

[17:32] a little bit nervous that maybe nobody has the Goonies. It also got me a little bit nervous

[17:38] that if someone does have the Goonies maybe I don't know why I said nervous. This doesn't make

[17:42] me nervous but it also got me thinking that maybe it's not spooky. Maybe Goonies because we all know

[17:48] that Deeproot Femball had some sort of Goonies license and after that someone else picked the

[17:53] license up. Maybe it's barrels of fun. We keep speculating about what barrels of fun is making

[18:00] next and we know it's going to be more of a mainstream theme and you know I don't know.

[18:07] I don't know. You know my good source told me it's a spooky game and there's a pirate ship

[18:12] and it's next but now Christopher Franchi who's closer than anybody to these projects

[18:17] is saying it's not Goonies. It's bigger than Goonies. I don't know unless it's some sort of like

[18:23] all big new Goonies adventure and that's what he means by that phrase. I don't know. Maybe it's

[18:28] Goonies too right. There's a new movie coming out. I don't know. I don't think it's that because then

[18:32] they wouldn't even be developing it yet if the new movie wasn't even out yet. But here's the thing

[18:37] about barrels of fun. Whether it's Goonies whether it's something else what's going to be interesting

[18:43] about barrels is when do they release this game because they're pretty much done with Labyrinth.

[18:49] They're going to make a few more but demand on Labyrinth is over. David's got a very sort of like

[18:53] smart approach. I'm not going to release a game until it's ready and I'm not going to release a

[18:59] game until everybody who ordered my previous game has their game. Okay cool but he's still

[19:05] got to be a little bit nervous that his next game the window to launch it in is going to be very

[19:12] important and this is where marketing does matter because I think he runs the risk of being sandwiched

[19:20] between King Kong and Harry Potter and you know the old tradition was always like you got to launch

[19:27] a game around TPF because that's when you launch games and if you launch it right before TPF then

[19:33] you go to TPF and that equals sales. I'm here to tell you and you guys all know this you don't need

[19:38] a show to sell a game. If you have a good theme and you have something called the internet and people

[19:45] like what they see you're going to sell every single one without even needing to go to a show.

[19:51] But there's always been that like desire some of it's just probably a little bit the desire to

[19:57] walk around the show and and slap high fives and be the man you know like I'm the one who did this.

[20:03] I'm in front of a crowd right with a terrible PowerPoint presentation and I'm about to tell

[20:08] you how we made this game and then I'm going to slap you with the price and kick you in the balls

[20:13] right. I mean that's pretty much how it's been when people think about the time of year right.

[20:17] We launch games around TPF we launch games around expo that's sort of been the go-to approach.

[20:24] But I think David's going to do it a little bit differently but I just don't know what the window is

[20:28] because when you think about it Harry Potter is coming out end of February early March.

[20:33] Okay that's happening right so you know that and you know Harry Potter is going to create like a

[20:38] little bit of a black hole for other sales like people's money is going to flow that way even

[20:43] if the game is not that good. I'm telling you it's Harry Potter we're going to talk about it in a

[20:47] little bit but there's only so much room people have. I think it's more the issue of room than it

[20:53] is an issue of money. For me it's both I really got to be candid about that. I mean I'll be back

[21:00] financially high on the hog when I finally get my apartment check. It's been the most expensive year

[21:06] of my life. I've always been not in debt. My apartment was always fully paid for

[21:13] and then I look at my account now and it's like you owe this much money on your house.

[21:17] That's about to be more than cut in half but it's still right. It's still like oh man do I like

[21:23] what happened here. You know I went from having thousands a month. I went from having so much

[21:28] money each month to buy whatever I wanted on top of daycare on top of everything and now it's like

[21:34] just got to buckle down. Okay which is fine you know which is fine. I made all the right sacrifices.

[21:39] I wouldn't have traded these decisions for all the pinball in the world. I'm happy I sold my Batman

[21:45] SLE and bought furniture for Brenda. It was the right decision. All right so we shall see what

[21:51] happens with this Barrels of Fun game and when they launch it. If I had to guess when he's going

[21:57] to launch this game I think it's going to be April. Let's take a look. I think we're going to see

[22:02] Harry Potter in February March. Then I think we're going to get the new Barrels of Fun game revealed.

[22:10] Then I think we're going to get King Kong. Who knows though right. Who knows. All right what

[22:14] else is going on in the world of pinball. Chicago Gaming Company. My favorite pinball company. No

[22:20] did you see this. They're making the Pulp Fiction Elise. The games are beautiful people. I know I've

[22:26] been snarky on this company for the obvious reasons. They're still beautiful games. The

[22:31] toppers look just fine. Anyone who's unboxing this game and putting it into their lineup.

[22:38] It is a little bit of a showstopper. It is. It is a work of art. It is gorgeous. And when I see them

[22:44] now I do start to sort of remember why I want it one so bad in the first place. I just don't

[22:51] really care that much anymore. But here's the funny part. So someone is unboxing their LE

[22:58] and on the plaque it says they got game number 220 out of 100 out of 100. How is that possible.

[23:07] Somebody left the last zero off on the right side of the plaque. And again I know this is just a

[23:14] little thing but it also shows me that nobody over there is like looking over the game head to toe.

[23:21] Here's the good news. If you want this game right now they're popping up for sale left and right.

[23:27] And the good news is is you don't have to spend a single penny over $9500 to get the game. That's

[23:33] good. I'm seeing people right now. And here's the good news too is like the games are inboxes like

[23:37] ready to go to you the next day. So I'm seeing them sell for $9500. No one's even asking for a penny

[23:44] more. And that's where we're at with Pulp Fiction LE. Once they make all thousand units this $9500

[23:51] game you know I think it's going to lose about a grand. The good news with this game we all know

[23:56] what the good news is. It started at $9500. It is basically the price of a stern premium. If this

[24:02] game was 12 or 13 yeah it would lose that money because I think 10k still seems to be like the

[24:09] ceiling that people want to spend on any pinball machine. And I think we're going to see more and

[24:14] more of the entire pinball market slide down to that if it was priced above 10 and very few

[24:22] machines are going to hold value around $10,000. It's just a really hard place to maintain value.

[24:29] So that's what's happening at CGC. The other thing that's going to happen at this company after

[24:35] these pulp fictions is they're going to make medieval madness again and not just a few of them.

[24:41] A lot of them. And the word on the street is that they might make a thousand or more additional

[24:48] medieval madness games. Obviously I think they're going to do different trims. I think there's going

[24:53] to be more royal additions made. Distributors are saying that that's not even going to satiate

[24:59] demand for medieval madness. Now look it's still one of the best games of all time. So I'm not

[25:05] surprised but I do think post D&D the demand for medieval madness with Dungeons and Dragons being

[25:12] a similar theme. I do think that's going to soften some of the demand for medieval madness.

[25:19] But everyone's got to remember like medieval madness royal addition came with that awesome

[25:24] topper, awesome powder coated armor and the entire game was only $10,000. And you know what I'm

[25:32] saying? Like that topper would have been $2,000 from Stern on top of a $13,000 game. That would

[25:39] have been a $15,000 offering from Stern Pinball or Jersey Jack. And that is why that game is so

[25:47] popular. It is a gorgeous game. I'm just looking forward to more of them. And then we're going to

[25:52] maybe Mark Richie's Halo after that. And then we're going to see some more Twilight Zones.

[25:59] Whenever I talk about CGC, as I say these things, it's always like, well, cool, but when? And we

[26:06] might be well into 2027 by the time those few things make it to market. Just one more thing

[26:13] that we're going to get to this Harry Potter news. All right, everybody. So Dutch Pinball,

[26:17] Dutch Pinball, if you're Dutch Pinball, what's the one word that nobody wants to hear from

[26:24] Dutch Pinball? It also starts with a D delay. And here we are. Here we are. I said, if they delayed

[26:35] getting Alice's on the line in January, I was going to give them some grief. And here we are.

[26:41] They are already behind schedule. Oh, shucks. Who could have guessed that? That Dutch Pinball

[26:49] telling everybody they're going to make 500 Alice machines in one year when it takes them a week

[26:55] to crank out 10 games. So the math only works out if they start it making Alice's week one of January.

[27:03] So that's not happening. We're now being told that it's going to be more like mid February.

[27:09] The reason why is the playfields. So we saw the video of the playfields getting ink screened. Is

[27:16] that what you call it? Ink screen or print it? Here's the thing. I talked to Melvin. And the

[27:21] reason why there's a little bit of a delay is they're adding two layers, not one layer, two layers

[27:28] of clear coat to these playfields. And he was also describing to me how they're doing the clear.

[27:34] Unlike Mirko, the clear code actually goes into all the scoops and all the cutouts to prevent

[27:40] shipping at the seams. So that's good. And I think you're going to get a beautiful double clear

[27:46] coated game. But I just hope they have all the parts in. I hope everything's ready to go. I hope

[27:51] they've got the toppers coming in. You know, people just want to see this game on the line.

[27:55] The other thing too is these games are being made in the Netherlands. I'm not sure if the new

[28:00] administration and the tariffs on goods being imported is going to impact things for Dutch

[28:05] pinball. Okay, so let's say the games are on the line in mid February. What's the earliest someone

[28:11] in America is actually going to unbox and play this thing? You know, that's the thing. I don't

[28:16] know. Like this isn't like these things are being made in Chicago and you can go drive with your

[28:20] pickup truck and have it in your house that weekend. Man, I don't think we're going to see

[28:25] people really play in this thing. And like until March, April, right? All right, so Harry Potter,

[28:31] Jersey Jack, pinball still spamming us on Facebook every day. There's still spamming us

[28:38] Godfather ads. Like what are you guys doing? Can you just take whoever's doing your social

[28:44] media content and be like, Jimmy, what do you do when nobody cares about Godfather, bro? We're not

[28:50] going to sell another Godfather machine. The only way we're going to sell Godfather is if we list

[28:56] this thing for the market price. You already cut $2,000 off of GNR to move those LEs. Well, for

[29:03] Godfather, you've got to take off like $4,000 to move the units. I mean that $4,000 off an LE is

[29:11] eight grand. Yeah, that's not even going to move LEs. And $4,000 off the CE is $11,000. And those

[29:19] CEs are selling for less than that on the second hand market. Okay, so we've got Harry Potter right

[29:25] around the corner. I'm just going to tell you right now what I know. And this is confirmation.

[29:29] I think when you hear this, you're not going to be completely surprised. But I think when you hear

[29:34] this, you're also going to be somewhat disappointed because I think what this news does is it confirms

[29:40] for all of us that we're just not going to get that extremely loaded thing we want it. And that's

[29:46] just the way it goes. I'm here to tell you on Canadian Pinball Podcasts, I have with 100%

[29:53] confirmation, I'm here to tell you that Harry Potter by Jersey Jack Pinball will be a standard

[30:02] body machine. No wide body standard body machine. I'm also here to tell you the game is not going

[30:12] to be loaded like Wizard of Oz. It's not going to be loaded like dialed in. It's not going to be

[30:19] packed to the glass the way earlier Jersey Jack machines were. Okay, so let's just think about

[30:28] that for a minute and why I think a lot of you are kind of feeling a little deflated. Harry Potter,

[30:34] right, this world of magic and castles and spells and all the things in that universe.

[30:41] You really, really, really have so much to work with to put under the glass in a pinball machine.

[30:48] You can put a lot more under that glass when you have a wide body machine. I mean, look at everything

[30:53] that's in Pirates of the Caribbean. Look at everything that's in Wizard of Oz. I think a lot

[30:58] of people are hoping it would be a wide body because a lot of people that love Eric's pirates

[31:03] love the way he made the game play. When you play Pirates of the Caribbean, it doesn't shoot like a

[31:09] wide body. It has a lot more speed and flow, but it also has a lot of toys in it. You know, when you

[31:15] look at pirates and you look at that upper play field, we were all sold on that alone. That was

[31:20] the coolest upper play field in the history of pinball. The triple spinning discs were awesome.

[31:25] They worked. They worked. Pat Lawler yanked him out. We know that JJP used to have the potential

[31:33] to load up these games and give us the wow. And we haven't seen the wow in a JJP game

[31:42] since the light show in GNR. And remember, that's over four years ago. We didn't see wow in Toy Story.

[31:49] We did not see wow in the Godfather. We did not see wow in Elton John. Elton John's a great

[31:56] shooter, but the wow. How did they do that? Did you see what happens there? It's not in the game.

[32:03] It's not in the game. And when you put in Elton John next to a Wizard of Oz and you realize that

[32:09] Wizard of Oz was half the price of Elton John, it's a big problem for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[32:15] Their new games, when put next to their original games, they look half as full. There's half as

[32:23] much fun stuff to shoot at. They just seemed to lack going the extra mile. Seems like they went

[32:29] more towards a cost cutting approach. And yet the prices went up. It's like they made the games

[32:36] look beautiful. The artwork is usually really nice. They light them up like a Christmas tree,

[32:41] but mechanically, they've been really, really sort of barren. When you lift the play field on the

[32:47] last four games, all you got to do is lift the play field on the first four games from Jersey

[32:53] Jack and then lift the play field on the last four games. And you'll see, right? You'll see. It looks

[32:59] like this costs half as much to make as that. So Potter, right? The theme that was impossible to make.

[33:06] The author didn't want anybody to make it because she didn't want Harry Potter in CD bars. They got

[33:12] the license somehow. It's going to be based on the movies. It just seemed to be the theme that

[33:19] should be the return to glory for Jersey Jack Pinball and its loaded machines. You got Eric

[33:27] Minier, the guy that made maybe the most loaded game they've ever had in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[33:32] A game that to this day, even though they made only a thousand, continues to sort of be celebrated

[33:39] and hold a tremendous amount of value. Now you could argue it's because they only made a thousand

[33:43] and that is not wrong. But this was supposed to be the game. I feel like Obi-Wan Kenobi. You were

[33:49] supposed to be the chosen one, Harry Potter. You're supposed to return Jersey Jack to its former glory.

[33:55] And this doesn't mean that this game is not going to do that, but it definitely telegraphs that it's

[34:02] not going to be as loaded as we think. It also telegraphs that they're not changing direction

[34:10] significantly. You know what I forgot? I just list out the last four games. I forgot Avatar.

[34:15] I forgot to even mention Avatar. That's how little that game has made an impact. Even on me,

[34:22] I forgot about it. Oh, and by the way, I heard from someone who saw the CEs, the UV ink does not

[34:28] appear any better than you've seen already. So if you're expecting them to have fixed the issue,

[34:35] it's not going to happen. Yeah, it's going to look a little bit better because it's got three colors,

[34:39] but it's not really going to light up like it did in the trailer that made you order this game. So

[34:46] that's about to happen. And there's a reason why they're not showing us any examples of it, because

[34:51] they don't have a good example of it to show. All right. So Harry Potter, standard body game,

[34:57] coming out in just a few weeks. And I also asked my source, I said, Hey, is this thing packed?

[35:04] Like, is it going to have that like, wow, the way that pirates did the way that Wizard of Oz did?

[35:12] And then there was just like a long period of silence on the other end of the phone.

[35:19] And he's like, yeah, no, he's like, you know, like it was just kind of like,

[35:24] but it's still Harry Potter, you know, and I feel like, all right, so let's start to manage our

[35:29] expectations around this game. I think it's beneficial if we all significantly lower our

[35:36] expectations around Harry Potter, Pimbal. Here's another interesting thing. Do you know, and this

[35:42] had to come from Jersey Jack Pimbal, because there's no way the Harry Potter license holder

[35:48] would have even been aware of this. Do you know that that nice little gentleman who's making that

[35:55] homebrew wide body version of Harry Potter, do you know that he was sent a cease and desist letter

[36:04] from the IP holder of Harry Potter? Now, who do you think was behind that? Maybe Jersey Jack,

[36:12] right? Think about it for a minute. They don't want people to see the potential of what could

[36:18] be in a Harry Potter Pimbal machine in wide body form. And that guy made his Harry Potter homebrew

[36:26] to look exactly like a Jersey Jack machine. I mean, the artwork looks identical to the way

[36:33] JJP lays out its artwork. You've got the big screen, everything about it, everything about that guy's

[36:39] game was like OMG. And the mechanical stuff he has in it and like, oh man, the battle between

[36:45] Voldemort and Harry, where the ball gets grabbed by the magnet and goes back and forth across the

[36:51] play field. I feel like they saw that. And they realized we don't want people to get excited

[36:58] about this. And then we drop our game out there and it doesn't have anywhere near the same level

[37:04] of magic. So yeah, he got a cease and desist. Now, if I were him, I would take that cease and desist

[37:11] and flush it down the toilet. There is nothing illegal about making a one off version of anything

[37:16] for yourself. There's nothing illegal about it. He's not making this for commercial gain. He's not

[37:22] selling that homebrew version of Harry Potter. And I think that's another thing to me people that's

[37:27] telegraphing that Jersey Jack's a little nervous. They don't have the sort of banger that they know

[37:36] we want to see from them. So I don't know everybody. I think history is about to maybe repeat itself.

[37:42] I think this company has been a little bit in a weird space. I think it's a good thing that Pat

[37:48] Lawler is gone. But I also don't think they have their Chief Creative Officer like George Gomez.

[37:54] Maybe that's now Steve Ritchie. But Ritchie's not the guy, man. Ritchie is not the guy that's

[38:00] going to return them to previous glory. Ritchie's all about gameplay, sure. But Steve's games in

[38:06] general have kind of been a little underwhelming in the mech department. And here's the problem with

[38:11] all the pimple is if you want a lot of toys and mechs, you're going to have more of a stop and go

[38:15] game. And if you want a lot of flow like Ritchie does, then you take stuff out, then you put everything

[38:22] at the top of the play field, you open up that play field. It's that simple people. There's not like

[38:27] a mystery on how you make a game feel better. You open it up. You just open it up. And that's why I

[38:34] think Pirate of the Caribbean made a lot of people excited because it kind of gave you the best of

[38:38] both worlds. Wizard of Oz, I don't think really did. It gave you a lot of toys and stuff. But man,

[38:43] it's not a good shooter. Guns and Roses doesn't shoot very well and it doesn't have a lot of

[38:50] toys. I don't know. It's got a great light show and great music happening. Dialed In is probably

[38:56] the best example of a good shooter with a lot of toys. So if I could hope that Harry Potter is

[39:01] something, I would hope that it's the spiritual successor to Dialed In because I think Dialed In

[39:06] gave you everything. You know, Toy Story, no, like not enough in it. Godfather, please no,

[39:13] not another Godfather. The one thing that makes me nervous is when I met with Eric at the Avatar

[39:19] launch. He said his next game plays really fast. And I'm like, oh, here we go. There we go. It's

[39:26] going to be empty. It's going to be empty. You're going to lift the hood on that thing and there's

[39:30] not going to be that much. We shall see just a few weeks away. It could just be six weeks away.

[39:35] But you heard it here first on Canadian confirming Harry Potter is a standard body game. We will

[39:41] see what that means for this game when it comes out in just a month and a half. Everybody have

[39:47] a great Friday. Come hang out at the Saturday morning spectacular tomorrow. You might be able

[39:52] to see the return of Canada's Fixed Felix Jr. Thank you, Mr. Robert Mooney, all these years

[39:59] holding on to the game, fixing the monitor when it went down. I really do appreciate it. And I'm

[40:05] going to root for your Eagles this weekend because I know how nervous the Mooney family is over there.

[40:11] They didn't look good last week. They did not look good if they didn't get that fumble to start the

[40:16] game. I don't even think they win that game. Everybody happy Friday. Canada out.
