[00:00] And I need you now, to know whoo!

[00:04] I need you all alone, if you only hold me alone

[00:11] Then you'll want me now, forever

[00:15] I'll get you

[00:16] I'll get you

[00:18] I'll get you

[00:20] I'll get you

[00:22] I'm back on land.

[00:24] After probably the most magical few days of my career,

[00:28] I would love to be on the board royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas

[00:32] As we raced a $2 billion ship,

[00:36] 400 miles off the coast of Florida to position it perfectly

[00:40] in the zone of totality, avoiding the clouds

[00:44] so that when Bonnie Tyler took to the stage to sing totally clips of the heart

[00:50] Everyone on board would be able to have a great view of the total

[00:54] I don't know about you guys if some of you were in the zone of totality

[00:58] but it was really a religious experience to see the skygo black

[01:02] and see everyone looking up there and cheering

[01:06] and to hear Bonnie sing that iconic song

[01:10] it was a thing that I would have been working on for almost a year

[01:14] So almost 12 months boiled down to an 8-minute performance

[01:18] with DNCE and that was a little bit of my live recording for myself

[01:22] I just wanted to say it was nice to be away for a week from pinball

[01:26] I spent a lot of time last night just catching up on what's going on in the pinball world

[01:32] and I had to say when you step back and you take a few days off

[01:36] something happens to me I really begin to

[01:40] to not care as much about all of the BS

[01:44] so there's that part

[01:46] the other part is I also get self-reflective

[01:48] and I get a little bit ashamed and mad at myself for getting so caught up

[01:52] and a lot of the heated debates that go on with these pinball machines

[01:56] because again as we all know it's not really that important

[02:00] like what everyone is arguing about and fighting about is really not that important

[02:04] but we wouldn't have a show if we didn't discuss

[02:08] what's going on in pinball on a weekly basis

[02:10] so this is going to be a little bit of a news recap

[02:12] and I'm sorry that there's not going to be as many pips as we can

[02:16] and I'm sorry that there's not going to be as many podcasts going up and there's a reason for that

[02:20] we're renovating the apartment right now

[02:22] so we're all over the place

[02:24] so I don't have the same sort of time in the morning to put these podcasts up

[02:28] because the guys are here putting new flooring but believe me that we haven't gone anywhere

[02:32] so we're going to keep doing this

[02:34] so the first topic that I was just reading

[02:38] and I was like here we go again

[02:40] and I'm going to call this podcast Stern Bashing

[02:44] because I believe that this is a phenomenon that occurs

[02:48] anytime anything comes out right

[02:52] it's for some reason people in the pinball hobby can't just say they like a game

[02:56] they have to like a game at the same time they say a Stern game sucks

[03:00] you know it's like dialed in is great

[03:04] why can't Stern make games this great

[03:06] I got my attack from Mars remake Ellie

[03:08] now this is a quality game so much better than that piece of shit Stern

[03:12] um Alien Pinball

[03:14] I've never seen a game with such great build quality

[03:16] it's in mixed Stern laughable

[03:18] you know for some reason we have to always pile on Stern

[03:22] and Stern Bashing just becomes the flavor of the day

[03:26] the flavor of the week the flavor of the month

[03:28] and there's a reason for that and I get it

[03:30] I get it because Stern has 90% of the market

[03:34] so when someone has 90% of the pinball market

[03:38] everything will be compared to them because they deliver the most volume of games

[03:42] and also the other reason why I think there's a lot of Stern Bashing that goes on

[03:46] is because Stern has now priced their games to be premium

[03:50] these games are now $7,500

[03:54] $8,500 and a lot of these games you know people will say

[03:58] well Lord the Rings came out and it was

[04:00] what less than $5,000 around there and look at everything that game came with

[04:04] now you're spending $80,500 and everything is stripped out

[04:08] so that's like the nucleus for the Bashing is

[04:12] you're not getting your money's worth there's quality control issues that seem to be

[04:16] plaguing Stern games left and right

[04:18] you wait forever for code

[04:20] and these are all the issues but here's the thing guys

[04:22] all of you out there who listen to this podcast on a weekly basis

[04:26] you now know everything you need to know about Stern Pinball

[04:30] there's no new issues that affect these games

[04:32] you know that the code's gonna take forever

[04:36] you know that there's a chance that you're not gonna get

[04:40] anything really of value in your LE's

[04:42] you know that the cabinets might not be the best

[04:44] you know that you might get playfields with ghosting

[04:48] you know that this, that, and that will happen

[04:52] and you know that Stern might take forever to make you right if you have an issue

[04:56] that's like you know you need a new playfield or what not

[04:58] so you know these things

[05:00] and yet you still will most likely

[05:02] buy the machine because most people out there

[05:06] who buy multiple expensive pinball machines

[05:10] are addicted to getting new pinball machines

[05:14] it's a drug and the only drug dealer in town

[05:18] that's got your constant fix is Stern Pinball

[05:22] so you know look I'm at this new, I want to kind of change my approach

[05:26] I will still call out games I still will say what I feel about

[05:30] if you're getting your money's worth in these games but

[05:32] but Stern bashing does get old and it gets tiring

[05:36] and ultimately either buy a Stern or don't buy a Stern

[05:40] but if you go all in and I've heard people talk about

[05:44] Star Wars Ellie and people are starting to get them and some people are saying stuff like this game's amazing

[05:48] this game's incredible

[05:50] I'm so happy I stayed in on the LE

[05:52] look I think if you gave Stern your LE dollars for Star Wars

[05:56] you have shown them that you expect very little

[06:00] from the LE package you do

[06:02] like it's not Stern bashing

[06:04] I'm bashing the buyers this is buyer bashing

[06:06] I think people who buy that game are foolish

[06:10] because they took everything out

[06:12] and I keep reading people have to add shaker motors

[06:14] they don't even have the top already

[06:16] you've got to spend in an additional $500

[06:20] to get a topper for an LE machine now

[06:24] I don't get it I don't get it and they take the shaker out the glass out but anyway

[06:28] look it's your prerogative I'm happy

[06:30] I'm happy people are enjoying their Star Wars

[06:34] I don't want to read inside and have people complaining

[06:38] you know I'm not looking to get validated on my opinions on Star Wars

[06:42] I still think this isn't the Star Wars machine

[06:46] people would have liked and that's my prerogative so I'm not buying it

[06:49] that's cool but I'm not going to keep going on

[06:53] about Star Wars

[06:55] but here's an example of what I think is absolutely

[06:59] wrong with Pinside is

[07:01] and if I were Robin I would

[07:03] pull the moderators together and say look

[07:07] we have the world's most successful Pimball Forum

[07:11] but it's getting destroyed

[07:13] it really is it's reading Pinside sucks now

[07:15] I don't know about you guys but it's depressing

[07:17] they've let the lunatics and the inmates run the asylum

[07:21] and what they really need to do is start implementing some sort of policy where

[07:27] you just shouldn't be allowed to constantly shit on stuff

[07:31] and start threads about one game and then just

[07:35] shit on another game in the thread and I was reading KPG's

[07:39] thread about attack from Mars remake

[07:41] and this is a perfect example

[07:45] of how the people on Pinside they can't even recognize their own hypocrisy

[07:51] and they're just walking contradictions in their own threads

[07:55] and I don't even blame them because a lot of what the forum does

[07:59] is it creates this like hyper response to a topic

[08:05] so he's posting someone responds you respond to them they respond to you

[08:09] it's just like this chain reaction and then you go back

[08:13] and you read like the initial post and a lot of times

[08:17] what's said later on by the same person completely contradicts

[08:21] what they said and so he's talking about his title is

[08:25] the real deal in modern day Pimball attack from Mars remake

[08:29] okay and then he goes on to sort of explain why he thinks the game is great

[08:34] how the quality is amazing how the top is incredible

[08:37] but he does it in a way that constantly

[08:41] shits all over Stern and compares what you're getting

[08:45] with attack from Mars with what you're getting from Stern

[08:49] so first he says this and I want you to

[08:53] okay he says later on in the thread

[08:57] they aren't garbage and I'm not bashing them that's what he says about Stern

[09:01] okay does this sound and this is what he said originally in the post

[09:05] does this sound like he's calling Stern garbage and he's bashing them

[09:09] I fired the machine up and it's just overall a better built machine

[09:13] than not only MMR but any recent Stern I've played

[09:17] including Batman 66 super early for $15,000

[09:21] that felt like an IKEA cabinet off Craigslist compared to this

[09:27] okay is calling Batman 66 and IKEA cabinet off Craigslist

[09:33] not bashing Stern not shitting on Stern's most valuable game ever

[09:38] I don't know it sounds like he's bashing them in the me

[09:40] then he writes the play field is easily much nicer than any Stern I've had

[09:46] including Erasmith Premium the toys on the play field with their color

[09:50] changing LEDs and motorized aliens and everything else

[09:54] just made modern Stern's seem cheap like a Prius

[09:58] versus a Mercedes Benz S class well look KPG

[10:02] and all of you guys out there it's okay to

[10:06] bash Stern and I don't necessarily disagree in terms of

[10:10] Stern's quality versus everyone else but I think we've hit a point

[10:14] now where as I've said it we know what we're going to get from Stern

[10:19] they are they are the mass market they are the Honda Civic of Pimbles

[10:24] they are not they are not aiming for premium for details

[10:30] for high quality they are aiming for production and profit

[10:35] and it shows and you're all buying it because you don't have really that many other options

[10:41] and you haven't spoken with your wallets and Stern continues the

[10:45] yank stuff out and you continue to buy so you guys have nobody to blame but

[10:49] yourselves and you're all part of the problem I'm serious all of you who keep

[10:53] buying and buying and buying are part of the problem

[10:55] I'll say this I think the attack from our early top is freaking awesome

[10:59] we all know that Stern would never give you something that amazing in the game for your money

[11:04] remember attack from ours early is $8,000

[11:08] okay so for $8,000 I think you know you get your money's worth with attack from ours

[11:14] I think the same is true of dialed in all right so I just want to say like everyone

[11:18] just stop always comparing everything to Stern just kind of game just be a great game

[11:23] can we do that can we try and do that let's try and do that all right so spooky

[11:28] so spooky pinball let's go on to spooky so spooky sent out an email that I wanted to read

[11:35] Charlie wrote when you buy a game from us consider it yours we are a small family

[11:41] run operation and all our purchasing is based on how many initial payments we received

[11:47] to confirm orders with available game options all games are custom made to your specifications

[11:54] people coming and going on game sales causes havoc in more ways than we can describe

[11:59] if you aren't confident in your game purchase don't buy it initial payments are not refundable

[12:06] we have delivered every single game we've ever promise so buy with confidence

[12:11] you will get your game spooky pinball LLC is happy and healthy growing company

[12:17] and we're not going anywhere see legal terms below for complete details

[12:22] if for any reason you do not you do need to back out once you've committed

[12:27] it's up to you to find another buyer Kate will absolutely help every way she can

[12:32] just because we're called spooky pinball doesn't mean we are heartless monsters

[12:37] we do care and we will always do our best to help our customers now for the good stuff

[12:43] price on the game is $5,995 initial payment is $1,000 you won't pay a dime until your game is complete

[12:50] and ready for shipment and that is in response to how people will be paying for total nuclear annihilation

[12:58] and also I believe how people will be paying in the future for Alice Cooper

[13:03] and the reason spooky is doing this is very smart with Rob Zombie people were putting deposits

[13:08] and they were refundable and they were bailing after they customized their games

[13:13] and then Charlie had to go find buyers for games that were built for other people

[13:17] so I like what Charlie is doing here I still think he's leaving some money on the table

[13:22] I think this game is you know we're looking at what people are paying maybe he could charge a little bit more

[13:27] but again you know at the end of the day the Ellie the Ellie frenzy the Ellie frenzy that I think is ruining pinball

[13:36] and ruining your ability to get value from manufacturers it has no place at spooky pinball

[13:42] Charlie doesn't give a shit about making this Ellie and getting people to jump in and putting deposits down

[13:50] and then you're not happy with your game and his approach what I like about his approach by forcing people to get...

[13:58] not forcing but telling people you have to give a deposit of $1,000 and your money is locked with us

[14:05] that does one thing it does one very very important thing it forces you to play the game to make sure you want it

[14:15] okay to make sure it's the game for you and because there's no Ellie nonsense and all this like limited

[14:22] we're gonna run out because of that if you love the game you'll get it or you will get TNA

[14:30] and congratulations to Scott and Spooky I hear they're around like 180 right now sold which I think is really awesome

[14:37] and that's exciting for them we know Alice Cooper has 500 that will be made and I think that is plenty of Alice Cooper's

[14:44] to get everyone who wants one a game I don't think they're gonna sell all 500 Alice Cooper's

[14:51] I just think because of the theme and the amount of games coming out I don't know but also Charlie won't make 500

[14:59] if he doesn't get 500 deposits so this is really really smart way to go about it

[15:06] and then they can go on to their next game like let's say Charlie makes 350 orders for Alice Cooper

[15:12] he makes that that many he has that many deposits and he has an ordered 500 parts of everything and doesn't get 500 orders

[15:20] all right so that is good news for Spooky and I like what they're doing over there and I just agree

[15:27] it's a family company and I hope the games get better I do I just I wasn't impressed with the first two games

[15:34] but I'm I continue to be impressed with how they approach the hobby and the way they communicate

[15:40] on to everyone's favorite company highway pinball so here's the news over at highway

[15:47] they put up a Facebook post it says production is underway at the factory

[15:51] in an annoying error on one of the newly designed and improved metal rams has forced us to have them remade

[15:59] the supplier has promised the correct ones early next week and as soon as they are here games will be finalized for quality checks and start to be shipped out

[16:09] we apologize for this frustrating delay and thank you for your patience

[16:14] in the meantime as shown in the pictures stock has filled up at the factory for continued production

[16:19] and then there's a nice picture of a bunch of alien heads a bunch of face huggers all laid out

[16:25] okay so remember they said they were going to ship games and volume starting August 14th

[16:30] it is now what August 25th something like that so I like delays happen and we know that

[16:43] and and that's why it was always like why would they put a date out there there's going to be delays

[16:48] and here we are there's another delay now it doesn't seem like a big delay but hopefully those ramps

[16:53] will make it to them next week and they can get games out and these guys are going to realize that building pimbo machines is not easy

[17:01] it's why I still think that alien and highway pimbo are not out of the woods now I guess the question I have

[17:08] and I really don't care about pictures of parts what I would love to see from these guys

[17:12] and I would love the new investors to do one thing and I asked this of Andrew all the time and we never got it

[17:17] and that you know that we know where that why that was but I would love these guys to make a video

[17:23] and tour the factory show the workers there like how are these games going to be made

[17:28] like is there is there a better assembly line they're going to put in place than what Andrew highway had

[17:33] which now can we all just go back and look at those highway pimbo videos again where guys are screwing parts into the play field

[17:41] with with a hand screwdriver and Andrew basically staged a fake production line and you guys all bought it

[17:48] all you guys who were in on alien you told me to shut up and I didn't know what I was talking about

[17:53] now go back and look at those videos with you know with with him basically faking a production happening

[18:01] so how many games can they make how many workers do they have how many can they build a day I keep hearing the number

[18:07] they can build five a day so that's what a hundred around 150 a month if they work seven days a week

[18:13] I don't think they'll work the weekends you can cut that number down by a bunch and you know so will they be able to get out

[18:23] games and volume to get the company where it needs to be and I guess the one of the main questions I have

[18:28] Brenna just dropped something over there Brenna you okay the main question I have is what is the demand still like for this game

[18:38] and I think people are starting to realize that when you go into the thread it just doesn't feel like there's much excitement

[18:46] and you really do get one chance to create hype and create a window of excitement for your product

[18:53] and I think this game has sort of just rubbed people the wrong way for so many years not months not days but years

[19:03] and by the time it does come out I just think they're gonna struggle to get people excited and reignite people's desire to go get one

[19:13] and it's a shame it's a shame because you know people always say well you don't really need marketing and pinball

[19:20] and if you just build it they will come and they will buy and that is not the case it's especially not the case when there's so many games that are going to be available over the next six months

[19:30] and there's so many companies out there there's enough companies out there that will get you games where you don't have to worry about them

[19:37] the biggest thing for me that I would just always be afraid of is buying a game that's made in the UK

[19:43] I just don't think you're gonna get the level of support as you would from a company that's building these games in the United States

[19:51] I think it's gonna make everything more expensive for them in terms of getting games to people getting parts out

[19:58] and then I saw this interesting update on Alien

[20:02] I saw an update from I think it was Sun King in Florida he wrote I hope I'm not going to jinx anything by posting this

[20:12] Coin taker is expecting a shipment from highway to arrive September 1st

[20:17] I only know this because I've been emailing both of them asking for any news on when I can receive the parts I need to update the software

[20:24] unfortunately I do not know the shipment will contain any new games but it only makes sense that it will

[20:31] but here's the interesting part for existing owners here's what where it gets interesting apparently it's not just a few new parts

[20:39] the early and alien machines that went out are getting completely new play fields and a new Zotak PC

[20:46] Coin taker is expecting to receive about a dozen new play fields and replacement PCs in September 1st shipment

[20:53] my fingers, toes, legs and arms are crossed and hope it happens so wow I mean that sounds really expensive that they have to go now

[21:01] and replace the I'm assuming like a populated play field with new computer has to go out to every single person

[21:09] I say every single person it's like what 20 people who got an original alien

[21:14] so I hope that happens it sounds really expensive to do that and I just for the love of me can't figure out how I'm going to do that

[21:22] I can't figure out how these guys will ever get this company into the green

[21:26] I do think this is a valiant effort I think this is all driven by pride I think profit will be impossible for them

[21:33] I don't see them ever profiting and they've raised the price on aliens so much that I just don't think they're going to make it

[21:40] I really don't I think the hype and the enthusiasm has gone away but let's do them a favor

[21:46] let's give them a chance to make it so I was in the alien thread and there's some guy in there now

[21:54] called green hornet who's just trolling the hell out of this thread and he's like ruining it

[21:59] and people are even saying they think it's me with a duplicate account it is not me

[22:04] but I think it's time where people just again we get it like why go into the alien thread now

[22:12] and fire up a shit storm right I just think let these guys have the chance to try and make it right

[22:19] I think going in there now and pissing on the grave of an idea that Andrew highway had

[22:26] it doesn't do anything for anybody it doesn't make anybody look good it doesn't make anyone feel good it doesn't make anyone happy

[22:32] it just sturs the pot and and that's another example where I think pin-side sucks

[22:39] because pin-side should get control of this stuff why would you let a guy go in there and just shit all over some game

[22:47] that he has no intention of buying has no intention of contributing to the positive conversation that's going on around the game

[22:55] and look no one needs help say no you're not saving people from losing money on alien anymore

[23:01] everyone knows the story and so it's just they let this sort of environment of ultra negativity infiltrate every thread

[23:09] so when you by the time you've read like three or four different threads on pin-side your enthusiasm for the hobby just dissipates

[23:17] and it sucks why is this why is this allowed to happen what I would like is for these new investors and highway pinball

[23:26] to do one thing first change the freaking name change the name from highway pinball guys it failed it failed horribly

[23:33] Andrew's vision failed horribly highway pinball will never be swappable playfield kind of company with modular thing I would change the whole cabinets next time around

[23:42] I would change everything that Andrew implemented in terms of this game I think he complete he failed horribly in every decision he made

[23:49] he got the wrong you know he got the wrong artist for the game originally Brian Allen could have done the art for the whole game

[23:55] he got the wrong cabinet look it looks bad everything about the swappable playfields the whole business model was was was never well thought out

[24:03] and so that's why I think he needs the chain they should change the name and they should they should I think they should just get through alien quickly

[24:10] but they need to get the next game out if they bring the next game out with a real like a normal cabinet dedicated cabinet if it's this berry game

[24:19] you know I think they that they're going to have a better chance of selling the next game I really do as much as I love the alien theme I think consumers have just moved past it

[24:29] all right let's move on from highway pinball I'm going to go on to JJP so Jersey Jack so dialed in machines are continue to go out

[24:39] and I think the consensus is and I think most would agree that dialed in has been a very successful pin for Jersey Jack I don't know what number he's at you know people get Ellie's all over the place I see Ellie 680 just got delivered

[24:52] I think it was 680 to my friend Jeff Rivera Jeff congratulations on getting your game and I think dialed in is is really being recognized as a fantastic machine

[25:03] and it's hard to fault it it's really hard to fault it the only fault you could make is that the theme is still not what you would love and imagine if it was a theme based upon like a movie or a TV show and that's cool

[25:16] but I I I'm happy we have a new machine that is jam packed and it's pat law or the main issue I keep hearing that I'm reading the threads I'm like you know I'm not I'm not creating news I'm this is what people are saying

[25:29] the SIM card shot there's that hole for the SIM card I believe you hit it with the upper right flipper that's a difficult shot to hit

[25:39] and and that area was receiving a lot of wear and tear causing the play field clear coat to chip in that area so now Jack is installing a cliffy there

[25:50] and people are saying when you install the cliffy there some people are saying with that cliffy installed it's an impossible shot to hit now the ball just won't go in with the cliffy

[26:00] and I hope they figured this out because there's enough people that are saying that that's an issue that leads me to believe I think it's an issue

[26:08] and I know that collectors additions when they go out they should have all these protectors installed and hopefully the gameplay isn't adversely affected when the game is protected

[26:19] and there's a lot of discussions to where people are like why are people so anal and OCD about protecting their games and play your pinball machines and have fun with your pinball machines and flip them and don't care about trying to preserve them and keep them perfect

[26:35] and I fall a little bit in the middle on this and you have a game you spend this much money on it you want to keep it nice you know I was like if you have a nice car do you go park it next to a piece of shit

[26:48] and park it really close knowing that if that person opens the door they're going to put a dent into your car and it's the same thing with pinball it's you know chip clear coat

[26:57] terrible dimples a worn out shooter lane like it's like a dent in your car and and people want to keep it looking as new as much as they can

[27:08] now the the problem pinball as opposed to a car is the pinball itself is constantly beating up all the things you're trying to preserve

[27:17] so it's it is a battle you won't ultimately win if you play your machines a lot and whenever I see people who are collectors who have a machine and sell it a year later with 200 plays

[27:29] yeah that do I think it's a shame do I think those people didn't fully enjoy it I do I think you need to play your games I mean when I when I had Lord the ring is I would play like 50 games a weekend I would easily do that I was I play magic girl more than that you know

[27:45] so I I think pinball should be played I think you should enjoy it I think you shouldn't worry so much but I also think it's just a smart move for everybody to put the protectors on immediately when you get your game why not why not the protectors are so damn cheap

[28:01] and the games are so damn expensive it only makes sense to do it that way all right what else is going on the pinball world home pin

[28:10] so Mike is getting ready to put the thunderbirds the two prototypes on a ship and they're going to go off to some show I think it's a show is is it coinciding with thunderbirds day which is September 30th I think there's like an Australian pinball show that's before then where he's going to show this game

[28:30] Mike's been showing bits and pieces of the game and you know there's a flyer that you can see of like the cabinet artwork and and some other things some funny claims he's making about the game some stuff like the lighted back box decals have been copied since he showed it which is why it wasn't smart for him to show it you know something like that

[28:54] because any of your competitors will copy you and that's what happened people copied him and went to market with it before he did so again bad marketing move I continue to say the marketing around this game is just sort of like whatever but I'll say this at his price point when I see stuff like stainless steel apron and I see stuff like lighted decals I get excited because I think Mike is giving people that

[29:24] value and it's it's stuff like that you know when stern puts a plastic apron in the game and takes out a metal one that is removing value okay and there's it's hard to deny that they've increased prices and taking these things out so it's nice to see that Mike is you know putting stuff in games that that collectors and buyers are looking for I don't know what the game will be I don't want to speculate about it

[29:51] I'm not only Ryan my boy over in Australia seeing when it looks like and says that the artwork is hand drawn it's colorful it's more 2D than 3D it does look very flat when you look at the plastic art and you look at the stuff that we've seen so far there's like the two inserts on like lock one lock two

[30:08] and it does look very flat like it doesn't have much depth to the art so curious to see how that works when the game is finally revealed but I'm not going to speculate anymore in it because I haven't seen anymore and it'd be stupid for me to do so

[30:21] I'm trying to get our friends in American pinball on the show to talk more about Houdini this is a game that is right around the corner and I believe Houdini is going to look to ship by the end of the year

[30:34] I think it might come out even sooner they've been quiet they've been quiet and we saw what physically looked like a pretty fully functioning game and that means Josh has probably had a lot of time to polish the code

[30:48] and so I think who Dini is going to come out unexpectedly sooner than people think and I think a lot of people are looking forward to that game

[30:56] something else that people are really looking forward to is new code for Batman 66 still nothing still nothing can't believe it

[31:06] Lyman's got to get this game done he knows it I don't know what else to say that's just there's that non news item on Batman 66

[31:13] what else is going on so if we heard from our friends over there Dutch pinball I hope there haven't a great vacation you know with all the money that people gave them

[31:22] glad to know they can take a vacation that's still really just rubs me the wrong way and I you know you know me I love being rubbed the wrong way

[31:30] no still can't believe they they announced they were going on vacation and people's money is just frozen with them I think that's just incredible

[31:38] I can't see them turning this thing around I think that's it I think that's it for news there's there's going to be more sort of slow periods here in August

[31:48] I'm going to do my best to get more guests on the show and talk about pinball with you you fanatics out there you manufacturers out there

[31:54] and I really really really just want to say this like just play more of your games enjoy them enjoy them

[32:01] let people enjoy their Star Wars Ellie even if you don't like it everyone just stop like shitting on everything it's just pinball

[32:08] I think people are starting to realize more than ever that these are really expensive toys and it's crazy levy says it to me

[32:16] crazy levy I love this guy like I'm Facebook chatting with them and he basically says all these games are fucking ripoffs

[32:22] they're all fucking ripoffs like everyone's getting ripped off across the board and they're all accepting it and you know what I think he's right

[32:30] I think I think it's just so stupid when I step back and think about it how much money we spend on like one game one game

[32:36] and then we like get it and then we have to like we're constantly comparing contrasting it when you can go have like so much entertainment for thousands of people

[32:45] for thousands less but I'll say this the only thing that keeps it going is that I can go buy a $9,000 pinball machine play it enjoy it

[32:56] and sell it and get at least like $7,000 back $7,500 like a year later two years later if I go buy a $9,000 TV

[33:06] I'd be lucky if I got like $2,000 back for it so that's the only saving grace is that there's a healthy secondhand market for these games

[33:14] and there's enough people out there to gobble them up so that was episode 154 of Canadian pinball podcast

[33:25] if you want to be a guest on the show or you have some comments or feedback hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com

[33:33] we're going to talk to you guys real soon with some guests and some other fun stuff so have a good weekend play some pinball and that's it

[34:12] so
