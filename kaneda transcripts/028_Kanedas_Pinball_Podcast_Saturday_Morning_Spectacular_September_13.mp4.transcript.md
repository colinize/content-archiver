[00:37] Welcome everybody

[00:39] to the world

[00:41] most

[00:43] insecure

[00:45] incredibly talented

[00:47] wasting his talents

[00:49] on a subject like this

[00:51] Let's talk pinball today

[00:53] Happy Saturday morning people

[00:55] It's going to be a chart show today

[00:57] I'm just warning you shots will be fired at some chumps

[01:01] We're going to talk about star wars

[01:03] We're going to talk about what we know is going on in the world of pinball

[01:07] And we're going to do it in a way

[01:09] That's fun

[01:11] That's lively

[01:13] That's entertaining we got

[01:15] Drew in the house

[01:17] Mike Charles Jeremy Eric

[01:19] What's up y'all

[01:21] How many we got in the house?

[01:23] We got Facebook going

[01:25] We got 22

[01:27] There we go

[01:29] You know, I think that YouTube is the better place to be

[01:31] But you know if you want to watch on Facebook

[01:33] You can watch on Facebook

[01:35] I'm an equal opportunity to annoy you

[01:37] Let's do this

[01:39] We're going to let everybody come in the door

[01:41] We're going to do this for lack

[01:43] An hour today maybe

[01:45] I left my credit card

[01:47] At a damn country club

[01:49] 40 miles away

[01:51] Went to the Guns and Roozes concert

[01:53] Away with the 1999

[01:55] Whoever signed off on the blinking job

[01:57] Of

[01:59] Needs to be banned from the industry for life

[02:01] We're going to talk about

[02:03] Jabba

[02:05] We're going to talk about

[02:07] Star Wars

[02:09] It feels like the game came out like a year ago

[02:11] It's like sometimes when these stern games come out

[02:13] It almost feels like

[02:15] It's already been out

[02:17] We just get the confirmation of what's in it

[02:21] I have a lot of feelings about it

[02:23] I put up a podcast about this morning

[02:27] And I think you're going to agree with all of it

[02:31] And I don't really have much

[02:35] I don't really have like extreme emotions around the game at all

[02:39] But let's get to it in a little bit

[02:41] I want to just welcome all you to the show right now

[02:45] Hopefully you guys

[02:47] It's been a rough week

[02:49] It's been a rough time

[02:51] And what's happened in the world

[02:53] And you know it's easy to try to

[02:55] tune everything out

[02:57] And live in a vacuum

[02:59] And I do think it was a bad week to launch a game

[03:01] I think it was like the energy

[03:03] And the

[03:05] And the realities of life

[03:07] And the world and things that occurred

[03:09] Didn't make me want to spend

[03:11] Money on Pimble

[03:13] It made me want to hug

[03:15] Family and be closer to people I love

[03:17] And reevaluate

[03:19] Everything that is a priority in life

[03:23] And I've been thinking about that a lot

[03:25] We all think about it a lot especially as we get older

[03:27] There's an increased level of clarity and wisdom that we all get

[03:31] And I want to address some things on this episode

[03:35] About what was said on my Facebook page

[03:37] About 9-11

[03:39] I want to talk about that because I do

[03:41] Love this community

[03:43] And I think this community is some of the

[03:45] coolest people I've ever met

[03:47] This community has given me an extended family

[03:49] And friendship like no other

[03:51] I think that this hobby is

[03:53] It is in a licksier

[03:55] And it is a remedy for the biggest problem in the world today

[03:59] Which is loneliness

[04:01] That is the epidemic that is really

[04:03] Sort of hit younger generations hard

[04:05] I don't think our generation

[04:07] Suffered from loneliness

[04:09] That much because we

[04:11] Used our imagination a lot more

[04:13] We played a lot more

[04:15] We were more physical

[04:17] And out in the world and hands on

[04:19] With things

[04:21] We didn't have devices

[04:23] We didn't have

[04:25] Something in our pocket that could distract us

[04:27] That could show us

[04:29] Horrible things

[04:31] Graphic things

[04:33] Things that we shouldn't even be thinking about

[04:35] When you're a young kid

[04:37] And I think that scares kids I think it makes them

[04:39] Even more isolated

[04:41] And never to be a parent nowadays

[04:43] Because of it but we're

[04:45] We're going to talk about this pinball machine

[04:47] Fizzy what's up brother

[04:49] Fizzy I just want to say like

[04:51] I'm really happy you're a member of the

[04:53] Canada community you're a very active member on the

[04:55] Patreon chat

[04:57] I know you were very excited about star wars

[04:59] Curious if you're still going in on one

[05:01] You know let's get to it in a minute

[05:03] But I

[05:05] I may have had the easiest time ever

[05:07] Telling coin taker

[05:09] I'm out like I really want to buy it

[05:11] I did I had the money set aside

[05:13] I was really thinking

[05:15] Star Wars could be the game that goes into my garage

[05:17] I don't really feel like owning it

[05:19] Ever

[05:21] Canada let's be on as the stern pinballs are okay

[05:25] Or SHIT retro Aussie

[05:27] So should we just get into it

[05:29] Should we start with star wars

[05:31] Let me just get another drink of my ice

[05:33] I'm going to get into it

[05:35] Should we start with star wars

[05:37] Let me just get another drink of my ice coffee

[05:39] It's a cheap ass money grab

[05:43] Where they're going to put the effort into this title justice

[05:49] What's up Tony

[05:51] Okay so

[05:53] Okay so here's the thing about this

[05:55] I'm trying to I want to talk about the star wars launch

[05:59] In a sort of like a holistic way

[06:03] And I want to talk about not just what we saw yesterday

[06:07] I want to talk about the lead up to what we saw

[06:09] I want to talk about the fact that

[06:11] We knew it was star wars

[06:13] Oh man hold on

[06:15] Wow

[06:17] You know

[06:19] I won't lie last night was like

[06:21] One of the

[06:23] First time I've gone to the local McDonald's

[06:25] Because I needed it

[06:27] Late night McDonald's right

[06:29] Late night McDonald's right

[06:31] Canada is in the house by himself this weekend

[06:35] Because my lovely wife took the two boys

[06:37] To Lego land

[06:39] And I have the house to myself this weekend

[06:43] So party at canada's everybody

[06:45] Is there a game on right now

[06:47] All right

[06:57] I have a

[07:00] Brissbane lines one AFL

[07:03] Okay I don't know okay that's soccer

[07:05] AFL I don't know what's happening here

[07:07] So here's my thing

[07:09] We all knew it was star wars

[07:11] We all had like star wars fatigue

[07:15] And we got to see the game

[07:17] Now they teased the game about

[07:19] Oh it felt like it was like

[07:21] Almost two weeks went by before we actually got to see the

[07:25] World of War

[07:27] And then we had nothing for a while

[07:31] Right then it was like this

[07:33] There was a media day

[07:35] Then the

[07:37] Webinar didn't happen with the dealers early in the week

[07:39] Then they were originally going to reveal the game on September 11th

[07:43] They pushed it back at a respect

[07:45] Smart move stern to Friday

[07:47] You know as I was saying I didn't really care

[07:49] Like in the end

[07:51] We knew the game was coming out this week

[07:53] We got the game

[07:55] And

[07:57] It's hard for me who has

[07:59] Covered this hobby now for 12 years to

[08:03] Look at anything in isolation

[08:07] I look at games with memories of other launches

[08:11] And other moments and how certain

[08:14] Pimble games made me feel when they were revealed

[08:17] I remember when stern lined up those three batman's wow

[08:21] That was a wow moment

[08:23] I remember when Ghostbusters wow

[08:25] Godzilla wow

[08:27] Guns and roses wow

[08:29] Harry Potter was like a wow launch for Jersey Jack

[08:33] I remember what excitement was when Spooky showed evil dead

[08:37] And everyone was like wow

[08:39] Look at where Spooky's taken this company wow

[08:43] I wasn't even into evil dead

[08:45] And now those games are selling for 3000 over listing

[08:49] Like imagine what they're going to do with Beetlejuice

[08:51] And you know we want

[08:53] Moments of wow I was there

[08:55] I wasn't there actually I was

[08:57] I saw it when Dutch Pimble like

[08:59] Wealed in the big Lebowski right wow right these are wow moments

[09:05] And I think over the last decade

[09:07] We've

[09:09] We've really had some incredible Pimble

[09:11] And now we're at a point where Pimble is so expensive

[09:15] So every new launch

[09:17] And I think we're going to go get through the lens

[09:19] Is this going to wow me

[09:21] And the hard part at these prices now where stern is at

[09:23] Because I still think stern is more of the

[09:27] The mass produced product

[09:29] The more of the commodity

[09:31] That had such a

[09:33] Golden thing that they destroyed

[09:35] And I talked about this for the last year

[09:37] So they literally have destroyed their three tier model

[09:39] The significance of it

[09:41] The significance of the LE

[09:43] Like making the LE

[09:45] What they created and it's really running thin now and so

[09:49] When I saw Star Wars for the first time

[09:51] I want it to love Star Wars Pimble

[09:55] It is two things I love combined

[09:57] Pimble and Star Wars

[09:59] And I want it to wow me

[10:01] And I want it like

[10:03] You know and I will say this when I first saw like the cabinets first of all

[10:07] Thank you

[10:09] Hurtles coins

[10:11] After seeing this game stern doing the back to the future license would probably be a disaster

[10:15] Oh man it's a good point man

[10:17] I don't think anybody wants stern to have their dream theme now

[10:21] I don't I really don't I used to think

[10:23] They were the way to go

[10:25] I just think they've now become to me

[10:29] A company that is cutting corners and not pushing the creative envelope enough

[10:35] And you know as a new platform launch not impressed by any of it

[10:39] So see the game right I saw the

[10:43] What they did with the cabinet vibe

[10:45] You know making them look like the classic toys from Kenner

[10:49] You know it looked like you know I dig it

[10:51] I dig the translate I dig what they were going for

[10:55] It has that sort of that fun inviting

[10:57] Star Wars toy kind of vibe going on and you know

[11:01] So I don't have a problem with it

[11:03] You know I don't love the LE package

[11:05] I'm going to talk about that in a little bit

[11:07] And then they see the game

[11:09] And I see the game play

[11:11] I see the the the mechs in the game

[11:13] And I see that ad ad that's this big

[11:15] And I and I see the Java

[11:17] And I see the Death Star

[11:19] And I see the ramp

[11:21] And I see nothing wow

[11:23] Like what you know even the Magnus save

[11:25] From Golden Eye

[11:27] Cool it's cool

[11:29] But even the way they implemented it

[11:31] With the artwork putting a pinball there

[11:33] I said it on my show this morning

[11:35] You ruined the magic

[11:37] The whole point of a magnet being under there

[11:39] Like I want there to be like a mystery

[11:41] Like the forces being used when you put a pinball there

[11:43] Why did you do that

[11:45] Absolutely ruined the sort of what could have been a really special cool thing

[11:51] By like telegraphing what the thing is going to do

[11:55] Like really bad and and the play field artwork

[11:57] I don't really like it all

[11:59] Dave Sanders says doesn't Star Wars feel utterly designed by committee

[12:05] You know Dave I said it

[12:07] I said it again I said it on my show

[12:09] It feels like it was designed in a weekend

[12:11] The thing about this the problem I have with this design

[12:13] By John Borg is like when you go fan layout

[12:17] Eight shots like one one after another like this

[12:21] Sure it's like going to be a easy game to shoot

[12:23] It's going to be for casuals

[12:25] The problem is it really feels rushed

[12:27] And I know it was rushed like he had a design this game

[12:29] I think in a really short amount of time

[12:31] And that's my overall feeling

[12:33] It's like I look at this game and it's like there's nothing in it that's like wow

[12:37] And in fact there's just stuff that's like a real head scratcher

[12:39] And the ad ad for example

[12:41] In the movie you are heart-puning around its legs and it falls down

[12:45] Doesn't it look like you're heart-puning above it

[12:49] You're telling me they couldn't have done a third flipper orbit shot

[12:53] To rotate around the ad ad legs to make it fall down

[12:57] When it's not falling down

[12:59] It's just it's not firing from the guns from its head

[13:03] It's not like making emotions like it's moving

[13:05] It's just for this much money

[13:07] I just feel like for this much money

[13:09] We are not getting a world under glass

[13:11] We are getting tinker toys under glass

[13:15] And then when I saw the shooter rod

[13:19] Left over shooter rod heads

[13:21] Of Darth Vader and the stormtrooper

[13:25] That's the moment where I'm just like they've just kind of

[13:27] Given up

[13:29] It looks bad

[13:31] And I don't know what is happening

[13:35] Right? It just feels cheap

[13:39] It feels like it's mailed in

[13:41] And it's just going to be a great location game

[13:45] I just said the other thing I was like I was talking to my operator friend

[13:49] Like Kale over at electric bat

[13:51] And he's like I can't wait to get one

[13:53] It's just going to make money for operators

[13:55] As it should

[13:57] But that's not the market's turn needs to like really incentivize

[14:01] It's the home buyer

[14:03] I don't

[14:05] I just I don't think I've ever had an easier time passing on a game

[14:09] That I thought I would want to buy

[14:11] I don't think I've ever had an easier time

[14:14] Passing on a game that I thought I would want to buy

[14:17] I don't think I've ever had an easier time

[14:19] Just

[14:21] You know

[14:23] All right cool

[14:25] It's not you know it kind of made me feel the same way the richy game did

[14:27] I'm fizzy said at first I liked it

[14:29] And was going to get it

[14:31] I liked the art and the speakers

[14:33] But after reading all the chats and watching some videos

[14:35] I think I agree

[14:37] And the cheapness of the toys so pass

[14:39] See I mean look fizzy really want to buy one

[14:41] Niel McCray

[14:43] Shilling it is the new in his new video well niel is um

[14:49] Niel is as

[14:51] Niel is probably the biggest stern fanboy there is so like it it's fine

[14:55] Like I'm happy niel love stern games and he usually craps on like jjp games and love sterns

[15:01] That's that's niel like you know when you know the source of course he's going to show

[15:05] He's like buddies with all the people over there and he flies all the way from UK to see a game

[15:11] Um, it's it is what it is yeah it like it felt it almost is weird like for some weird reason like even this is like the you know the the full featured expensive version it still felt like a Costco game on some level then in it like didn't it just feel like it okay if you didn't see anything and you just saw this you you you could almost mistake it for a Costco $5,000 game and that's my overall feeling about this game well let me also talk about the clips because the more I watch of the gameplay the less

[15:39] Excited I get it's like they managed to make

[15:41] Exciting Star Wars the movie feel a little boring like feel a little I just felt like I I haven't felt this way in a while I do feel like the star wars fatigue and I think they manage

[15:53] To make the original trilogy feel a little fatiguing because when the what's on the play field isn't truly exciting yet kind of it's just not enough and and you know they did this with jaws and it worked but I don't know if it's going to work with star wars

[16:07] Because it's like three movies there's just a lot of jumping around again there's a lot of like you're in a moment and there's a lightsaber and then there's like the creature from jobahs

[16:15] You know like that the little jobahs squirrel guy like pops up then you're back at the lightsaber battle then you're back or it's like I and the fact that they've got a bigger screen

[16:25] And managed to make it feel smaller makes no sense to be they literally if you look at it if you look at the clips why are the clips full screen

[16:33] Why is all this stuff on the screen you know and then they when they do the crawl it cuts off the text and that's never cut how do you have a bigger screen and manage the messed that up Stern

[16:45] So you know I just think the whole thing just feels like they don't even know how to like like like properly take advantage of even their own new platform

[16:57] Expression lighting just I never liked expression lighting on a game I never thought it looked good it looks like little skittles or pezzes and like I don't they couldn't design something nicer

[17:09] Look as far people saying like raid I yeah fine cool like I'm nothing against raid a and his code I just don't think it's going to make this game worth owning

[17:19] It's one movie per ball is that how it was that how they did the game yeah I was confused by that because I'm watching game plan I'm like why is it like why is the movie intro crawling like you can't read it's just weird

[17:33] And then you know the call outs are really like the C3PO call outs like I don't know if I would have done that that way I know they got like an actor is that like C3PO from the newer movies or the game

[17:47] I don't know I think I'm making it up I don't know I like a lot about it also some questioning choices couple ramps cool art all right still Star Wars fan I'm buying Ryan are you buying an LE

[18:03] I mean yeah C3PO is easily like a kind of meant to be comic relief annoying and to have him do all the call outs

[18:11] Yeah I think space balls would have been better after seeing this I just I just I just you know what it is like I'm not I just feel like another star wars game is out in the universe

[18:27] It's not gonna it's not gonna like blows away it my real issue and concern with Stern is like their games are just not getting better

[18:43] You know they're just it just feels like another Stern is like the new punchline and I think that the rest of the industry is improving and the only company not getting better Stern and spooky become much better jersey jack has become better

[19:01] It's just pinball I've got a lot of a lot of excitement around back to the future gang like now because my boy Melvin is getting involved a little bit and he's helping making the game even better and he's like yeah he's like yeah

[19:19] It's gonna be epic so I think you know that feeling we had when we saw the basket we're gonna have that feeling when we see back to the future I've seen raza looks and it looks stunning like raza looks way better than Star Wars.

[19:33] I thought the pin looked decent can make can can make a decision.

[19:40] All right hold on why are messages being restricted let me make sure that I'm gonna.

[19:47] J Hendrix what do you say do I have like moderation on I don't know I always have to like figure out how to like turn that off I think it's up here.

[19:59] Communion moderation reactions.

[20:11] I had to turn off one of those gameplay videos just a jumble of noise I know man Mike I feel the same way like the more I watch the gameplay videos the less I want the game.

[20:21] You can see it in the in the reactions of the media that went there also did you notice like all the media I think it was Vic or one of them they they showed all the media like huddle around each other I didn't recognize any of them like none of them were pinball media.

[20:39] So you know the jack sharp is done a good job bringing in you know bringing in the the youtubers the influencers if you will.

[20:50] That's their strategy and like I don't blame them but it's just all right I just don't think when you see the comments on YouTube it's funny because like the newbies are like I love it way out of my price range like everyone which is.

[21:07] Everyone thinks they're seeing something that's like three grand you know yeah like what's people fight out what these things actually cause like it's a hard pass for most people.

[21:16] So here's the thing Anthony you know he says bummed on this effort I actually I'm kind of happy I didn't want to spend $13,000 to be honest on this game right now I could have I'm actually going to buy myself something else for my birthday my birthday is September 25th if you want to you know if you want to know it's like you're sad is like at my company they now no longer will tell you what people's birthdays are at a privacy and I was like what what was that.

[21:45] I was like what is this like why is a birthday a private thing like how sad do you have to be as a grown adult and not want to let people know it's your birthday I think that's a very tragic and sad thing that that would be a privacy issue the world's gone in so many bad directions.

[22:04] Strange right.

[22:07] Alright I want to address a little bit of the drama real quick that happened on my Facebook page if you allow me because it's a very you know it's a very it was very tough week and the the tragic.

[22:24] You know what happening Utah and the assassinating Charlie Kirk in front of his wife and children is a horrific moment in America like this is going to be very bad for a long time and it's whether you like them or hate them it doesn't matter.

[22:41] The the assassination of someone freely speaking their mind and opening up dialogue that's important in front of wife and children is horrendous and to happen right before September 11th and you know look we all have a relationship with that day and some of us were there.

[23:01] Some of us were in the city some of us were everybody the world watched it happened and you know there was a comment made on my youtube page by Glenn Glenn watcher like I don't know how to pronounce his last name in which he said that my sentiment around September 11th that I didn't mean it that I don't mean what I say right and I love the.

[23:25] The someone told me this morning jangus told me that this dude like orbiter Albert is telling people that I'm a bully not to not to subscribe to canate his pinball podcast I don't listen to that I mean I looked at it and then that apparently the dude saying he's going to want you to go behind his paywall they hear the full thing right.

[23:46] Google it pinball nerds podcasts Albert you got nine subscribers you make fifty dollars a month you couldn't even afford your own microphone retro Ralph had to buy it for you want to call me a bully because of what what that made me feel when Glenn said that and I love that Albert trying to say oh it's at it.

[24:09] One of my one of my one of my friends growing up Sean he lost half of his family in 9.11 and I don't mean like like adults like nieces and nephews they were there they were like in the building having breakfast.

[24:26] So when you when you want to like make a joke about my sentiment around 9.11 these are people in the pinball community like well known people.

[24:38] And use that as a moment to insult me and call me like on it you know like I like I can't even and then I tried to call them call them like really glad you wouldn't respond and this is the thing about these cowards is they want to say this stuff.

[24:54] Then they don't pick up the phone then they won't say it to your face and then you're then you're the bully for trying to keep these grown adults accountable for those insensitive remarks and then you know they Albert is trying to spin it.

[25:07] I'm not spinning anything I'm not spinning anything he said that my sentiment around 9.11 was instant here that I don't mean what I say.

[25:18] I the spin is his Albert trying to say it's he didn't mean he didn't mean it he wasn't what what did he mean what did he mean.

[25:27] You know and so yeah won't pick up the phone won't talk about it right so this is the world we live in now and then that other guy who's a friend of the show like David with the the damn 9.11 shirt with Garfield flying into two stacks of lasagna making fun of 9.11 and I you know like I roasted him and he deserved it and he you know he apologized and asked me to tell you.

[25:57] I was going to take down the post and I and I did.

[26:01] But don't be a jackass use as my mom would always say just use common sense common sense like read the room like there are there and you know he said something to me is like well isn't it enough time is past that we can now make fun in 9.11 and I was like well it doesn't work like that there's no enough time is past to make fun of a holocaust or 9.11 right or October 6.

[26:24] There's not enough time like any any like no tragic loss of life George Floyd whatever it is is like like it's now now it's okay and it's just what's weird about the you know the world today is you could do that stuff and I'm not one to cancel like I don't like cancel culture at all like it's you know Albert's telling people to like cancel my show bro I got I make more money in a day doing my podcast and you make all my money.

[26:54] I'm not going to tell people that unsubscribed you you because you can't even get people to subscribe on your own.

[27:08] But when people say like unsubscribed canada cancel can like it's stupid all it does is make more people sign up it makes more people raise their subscription amounts what I want to say is this it was a tough week.

[27:19] And in weeks like that of this past week.

[27:24] People are sad people are crying people are like worried about where we're going and the last thing you think about in a week like that is like I'm going to go buy a pinball machine now and it's unfortunate for stern the timing was bad I mean I almost you know I I don't know what their plan was with this launch but it just the vibes of it.

[27:45] I just feel like everyone's in a mindset where they just don't want to like throw money at stern we're kind of bummed out you know and seeing people cheer seeing people cheer.

[28:01] The assassination of a man in front of his children is is to me.

[28:06] I mean I'm almost getting choked up now thinking about the pure evil that lives inside someone's heart and I don't care if you disagree with what he was saying I don't I you know I wasn't like you know I knew of charlie watch this video is I know I actually like what he was doing in terms of just giving everybody a platform to tell me what you believe in I'm going to listen to you.

[28:29] And then I'm going to give you what I believe in and you make up your mind right and and he's allowed not to like support everything or question things like if we live in a world where we stop doing that and we feel this in the pinball space like you feel this pressure.

[28:43] To coat to toe the company lines to only say nice things about the products and the people to only be in support of every action and look it doesn't get more innocuous than pinball and that's why I love it.

[28:59] I love that you guys hang out here. I love that the you know the the community that we have is is is really solid and you know all the attempts and these losers you know in the end like yeah I think what Glenn said was stupid and he's blocked and he's a loser and when I see him at a show I'm not going to punch him.

[29:23] I probably wanted to smack the crap out of him that night because I was I was really upset like if he said that to me on 9 11 you know the thoughts of my friends and the people I lost that day like I would slap the shed out of him I'm serious like but I don't want to be violent but I'm just saying like you know like we also live in a world where you can do that anymore and I get it but like yeah but you're going to say stuff like that you're a loser and you're blocked and I don't want you to do anything to go and this is just between me and going you shouldn't do anything to go and it's not your bad.

[29:53] It was mine with him and you know what and I don't think Glenn's a bad guy I just think he said a stupid thing I think but you know what Glenn didn't do you know what he didn't do he never apologized and if you apologize is all on block them because I forgive people you know and I swear to me like this world it's just apologize you said something stupid you piss me off and I cursed you out because you got to be a moron to say that to do that's really

[30:23] like I just you know I'm saying it's just that simple but you know what it is about these cowards they can't apologize they think they're they think they're like I just what who raised these men like who raised them to be that way and I bet they're like church going people to it's so funny to me that the church going people that can't forgive it's like are you not do you not listen to what Jesus preached like what are you doing in that house over there

[30:52] and then anything but that is how you behave weird so yeah Albert enjoy your nine subscribers bro it's pathetic and I don't even think Albert's a bad guy he just gets into this because he's friends with Glenn and then you know it's always like the easy thing like

[31:14] the cheap shot at canator and I'll talk about you look me you know I always would tell this to Jamie I love Jamie over you know we're apparently wormhole is closed now because like of a divorce wow that sucks right guys getting divorced I think the wife's like getting half the games or something or they I don't know what's

[31:32] happening over there but like literally I would laugh with you because Jamie does his round table with Ralph and and and kale and I always tell Jamie Jamie do you

[31:44] realize that me watching your video will get more views than just the video itself canator brings the excitement he brings the audience you know I'm going to be at expo I've been talking to Rob Burke I have a funny idea about what we could do at expo you know I look

[32:03] Rob asked me to to make amends with someone who I've been trying to make I don't even know what I did individual Jake Danzig which I you know I know Jake he was

[32:14] on Facebook he's but you know I I I was like just can you just like smooth things out with Jake I was like cool I call him up I tried him multiple times he has my number I've left him voice messages I I

[32:28] see he's blocked on my Facebook because I think he has said some like mean stuff personally about so but again I'm I'm all about like let by

[32:35] gone to be by gone's bro I don't know the guy right I don't know why he has an issue with me but he does so but again he doesn't pick up the phone and I'm just like I

[32:45] just don't like I don't know what else to do so that's the dark side of this community is we have some real like SHIT talkers at times really

[33:03] insensitive comments at times and look I we all make mistakes this is the weird thing is I make more mistakes than anybody I've done

[33:11] stupid stuff I'm so ashamed about like I'm ashamed if I get drunk and I and I wind like a baby when I lose the

[33:20] twippies even though I got 100 more first place votes I I wind like a baby when I lose the twippies you know what you know what the

[33:26] outcome of that behavior was Kell and I are now like best buds I'm ashamed that I got drunk and through a drink in the

[33:35] face of Tim sexton because he was like kicking me out of a tournament for cheering for Lyman Sheets's girlfriend penny I shouldn't have done that

[33:44] that was wrong I was raised better than that I would be ashamed of my boys if they did that like that's not how you handle a

[33:51] situation man like you should have just left peacefully the outcome of that is one of my best buddies in pinball is John

[33:58] Erlich at Jack bar he hated me that night I elbowed him in the face when they were dragging me out he proposed to his wife on my

[34:07] show that you see the the full circle that we can turn a negative moment into a positive if we just open up that

[34:16] that opportunity so that's why when I go to shake Don's hand and move forward like

[34:23] Zheng is an I are talking again you know he called me today they resist Ralph is gonna come back we already know

[34:31] that those those big plans happening there's big he just apparently he just wants to look me in the in the

[34:35] eyes I whatever that means I feel like I feel like when he looks me in the eyes I just want to like punch him

[34:40] in the in the balls real quick like boom we good now I mean they're also can we just be dudes again

[34:48] to these men are like men man childs bringing it back to Star Wars let's read something

[34:58] I look I did anyone order Star Wars Ellie we've got 88 here 30 on Facebook did anyone order Star Wars Ellie

[35:03] can I can and don't worry I'm not gonna make fun of you a lot I just make fun of you a little bit

[35:08] did anyone say hey yeah man this looks like a 13,000 on game I want one I do think it's I'm I was wrong

[35:16] 100% wrong I'm at this game is not gonna go up to 18,000 dollars this game is not gonna go up at all

[35:22] I think it's gonna lose money I think these will go for 10 G's in like three months also I gave the

[35:30] exclusive news to my podcast subscribers today I will tell everybody right now you guys want some

[35:35] exclusive news yeah it's funny like I was like Jen is you know I said this to Jen is you're like

[35:41] Don knows this I'm like oh cool did you guys announce it because I don't know I don't can't announce it

[35:47] so here you go Transformers pinball is most likely coming out before Pokemon because Pokemon has

[35:55] some harder licensing approvals Transformers G1 and it will be designed by Elliott Iceman

[36:06] Elliott from John Wick fame is back baby with Transformers D1 how

[36:14] I'm excited are you now what are you doing Stern why are we giving Transformers to Elliott

[36:22] and not Keith Ellen Transformers this this isn't a nostalgia now this is like what these these

[36:28] grown man children want and we're gonna give it to a designer that hasn't proven he can make a

[36:33] hit game now like Elliott's got to prove himself I don't know Wick was a rush design but I don't

[36:44] see many people like can't wait for the follow up

[36:54] so when you go to Pinside say canada confirms Elliott Iceman on Transformers possibly the next

[37:01] game from Stern pinball you know for some reason people have a hard time giving me credit for

[37:05] anything these days but there you go the you know hey please don't unsubscribe please don't please

[37:18] you you couldn't pay me to listen to some of those shows do you ever hear me tell you ever

[37:25] to unsubscribe from someone show the only well look there's only one thing that I've told people to

[37:31] unsubscribe from and that is the was is the the canedisist or this week in pinball newsletter unsubscribe

[37:39] to that like I I don't know why call and we we were cool and then we weren't and then he he

[37:46] doubled down I don't I just again I just don't think he likes me at all and I think he's as

[37:51] woke as they come and when he started posting about like that you know trying to bring in the

[37:57] trans debate into the Harry Potter pinball like he literally tried to drag our hobby in our community

[38:05] he tried to drag it there for clicks once I saw that that's when I'm like I'm done like you

[38:11] you have lost the narrative you need to take Harry Potter pinball into a political space and and

[38:18] take the angle the woke angle you're taking is unreal

[38:27] what's up guys what happened to Bubba

[38:33] Bubba well I don't know why I just laughed like Bubba has been Bubba passed away years ago

[38:39] Bubba passed away one month short of being 11 Bubba died in my arms

[38:45] Bubba had gout which is when the dogs stomach flips upside down and he was acting all funny

[38:56] and I knew something was wrong and I took him to the vet and he died in my arms as they tried to give him

[39:03] um

[39:05] his heart stopped and they tried to I was watching them try to

[39:10] resuscitate him and give him CPR it was it was horrendous way to lose a dog

[39:18] I thought we'd have him for a few more years we'd wheel him around you know

[39:23] thing with bulldogs and all dogs is they teach us about love and life and the fragility of it all

[39:29] I mean they're God's gift to us they really are you know a dog when it sees its owner come

[39:35] home the endorphins it releases are more than humans can even feel when they fall in love for

[39:40] the first time and you're telling me there's no God there's a God come on he's feeling a little

[39:45] I do you think this is all just random no you know having new friend he's a he's a great kid he's

[39:55] he he was a war veteran his young kid he lost a finger and an explosion uh in in uh Afghanistan I

[40:04] believe and it traumatized him he sank into a really dark place became a methodic was homeless

[40:11] turned his life around he's now doing great dresses like a million bucks really hand some young guy

[40:16] and um you know but he he's like he's got an interesting uh

[40:22] point of view on life because I've never met anybody like this but he is um

[40:28] um he believes in the flat earth theory and it's it got me down a little bit of a rabbit hole like

[40:36] going into podcast about flat earth theory how they believe that Antartica is the end of the world

[40:45] you'd fall off the edge and how there's like no letary bases there from every country the

[40:50] Rockefeller estate is there uh the the the the the the the the the weirdest part about flat earth

[40:59] thinking is and you know look we make fun of him he you know I think he kind of just like

[41:04] was susceptible to some of this like conspiracy theory um but I think the most funny part is the flat

[41:11] earth community actually doesn't believe that dinosaurs are real they think they're fake and they

[41:19] think the bones in the ground were planet there by like the governments to convince us of

[41:27] something that wasn't like really like you really believe that like underneath all that rock

[41:33] and carbon dating that and because they they believe in a timeline also of like we've only been

[41:41] or a few thousand years not millions of years and it's just like I don't know I just like when people

[41:46] have strange weird like thoughts and you you you it's because it makes it makes for a much more

[41:54] interesting lunch when you're sitting next to someone who literally thinks there was never a T-rex

[41:59] you know I love it look if you're gonna be different be really different like be crazy um

[42:07] you know what another crazy stat is there were two billion T-rexes when I read this that two

[42:12] billion T-rexes have a roamed planet earth and then you want to charge me 13,000 dollars for a pin

[42:18] ball machine I can't put those two things in my head at the same time the reason why there were two

[42:23] billion T-rexes is they estimate that there were 20,000 T-rexes alive every year 20,000 roaming

[42:33] the earth right it's not that many but it's a decent amount right I'd be I'd be pretty scared if I

[42:36] turned a corner and saw like eight T-rexes let alone like 20,000 on planet earth

[42:43] there was 20,000 a year but get ready for it for 10 million years there were T-rexes

[42:51] when I think about the time and then I think about the amount of time we have and I think about

[42:57] Star Wars Pimball like I just this is this is how Canada's head works I'm like yeah I don't need it

[43:01] now I don't need this pin now after knowing that millions of years T-rexes were chilling you're

[43:10] gonna come out with shooter rod heads on a 13,000 dollar pinball machine I don't need it I don't

[43:17] need it I would rather go study T-rexes and watch Jurassic Park then buy Star Wars Ellie okay

[43:25] so the the girls stabs on the train like I don't want to talk about that that that was probably

[43:37] the most disturbing thing I've seen in in years and you I've been saying this and not to get political

[43:45] the letting these lunatics on the street with no bail so you can commit a violent crime and

[43:51] they don't lock you up anymore we used to throw people away we used to identify lunatics of all races

[44:01] okay this is not a race thing and throw them into insane assilums and yes it's more the Democrats

[44:12] that want these people out on the streets they think it's racist to set a bail that these criminals

[44:21] can't afford yet there's a reason why you would need to pay for bail because you committed a crime

[44:31] why would anybody want to vote in and we're in New York City is about to vote in the craziest

[44:37] progressive left ever good that's why I'm happy I'm gone I don't want to be a part of a city run by

[44:46] these lunatics okay who wants to the mayor of the city where that stabbing happened came out and

[45:00] said we need to have empathy for the murderer empathy for him the poor girl bleeding out nobody

[45:09] helped her one guy helped everyone else just walked by again we need to reset fall the empire

[45:15] stirring pinball get back to pinball look here's the thing here's the thing did anybody buy a star

[47:18] that guy remember there was always like that guy like Don was like that guy like that like

[47:22] remember Don was like Don Baudet John Wick Ali like once you order a John Wick Ali you literally

[47:27] might as well just like put a sticker on your back being like never never listen to anything I say

[47:33] I mean that that is what when you buy John Wick Ali you literally have just told everybody

[47:39] don't ever listen to anything I say

[47:44] uh you know look I love that we've got all these characters in pinball content it makes it more fun

[47:49] right it would be boring if we all were the same

[47:58] seriously can he to answer me this how much better is Wizard of Oz than Star Wars

[48:03] picks piece of okay first of all I love our little Aussie friend here um retro Aussie

[48:13] yeah like Wizard of Oz is embarrassing what I mean Star Wars is embarrassing next to Wizard of Oz

[48:17] I think Star Wars is embarrassing next to I think Potter really just kills it like evil dead kills it

[48:22] I think doing is way cooler than Star Wars like I would much rather own a dune than Star Wars you know

[48:27] I had a long conversation with David Vaness you know he's he's a really good guy like you know

[48:34] I told David though I'm like David you just need to hire a dude like me you need you need some swagger

[48:38] like I can't do it for you for free I'm not and I said to him like I'm not doing it for free

[48:43] I just I don't know what you guys have a problem I'm curious if I if I consult it I'm trying to

[48:49] figure out if I could do this if I could actually be a consultant for pinball companies

[48:54] but also be objective I mean I would do it but they've got to be able I do think it would be

[49:03] impossible to really do it that I think it have to be one or the other because the problem is

[49:07] the problem is the moment they're implementing things that I've consulted them on then I wouldn't

[49:15] be able to objectively cover that stuff because I would be biased so I'd really you know

[49:21] I think it's all in or not what is the Star Wars code at I don't know I had to switch to Facebook

[49:30] because retro Aussie is so effing annoying geez right Aussie simmer down there buddy you're driving

[49:38] people off the chats we okay like let's be respectful of and not spam your hatred of Star Wars we

[49:50] know we know we know we know like let's let's bring it in like let's do a huddle here let's

[49:55] all huddle together we know we know a few things we know that nobody listens to Orbiter Albert

[50:00] we know that canada is the biggest piece of s h it in pinball and that's why you love them

[50:07] we know much nudge magazine is beautiful and you should subscribe we know that all of you at five

[50:13] dollars a month can afford ten dollars a month we know it I'm not going to ask you to do it but I

[50:16] just did we know that canada will constantly contradict themselves and still have the biggest

[50:21] following in all of pinball podcasting history we know this okay we also know we also know that

[50:28] Star Wars is underwhelming lacks creativity and doesn't look anywhere near what a game for this

[50:35] much money should be we also know collectively or we're in the huddle here this is quiet space it's a

[50:40] safe place we also know that spike three right didn't really hit didn't really feel impressive it

[50:46] seemed like the same old thing and they managed to make a bigger screen seems smaller than the old screen

[50:52] did you notice that like the clips are the smaller why would you have this bigger screen and then

[50:57] reduce the quit like I what Stern Stern call me up George call me Seth Gary call me come on guys

[51:04] call me and then you get C3PO for the callouts I mean I mean really are we doing this

[51:10] yeah you guys watch the show um the studio with Seth Rogan it's amazing and I love the marketing

[51:16] chick in it she's amazing she's awesome can I say chick is that am I allowed to say chick um

[51:21] um she's so funny and I love it with like she's like just flies off the handle when they have a

[51:27] terrible marketing idea she's like I can't sell this and that's what the CMO at Stern needs to be

[51:32] like you want to put C3PO the most annoying characters voice as the callouts of this game

[51:38] right am I hearing you right John and we're not doing that we're not we're not doing that George

[51:44] George this guy wants to put C3PO in the call you know what I'm doing is

[51:51] I love that like I love that it's 2025 and we're like yo man the games got a tweeter you know

[52:03] let's get some light on here the games got a tweeter like like we were getting crappy 10

[52:13] dollar speakers now we're getting like 20 dollars speakers and we're like yeah man yeah like

[52:19] it's just too easy to make fun of a lot of these moves in this hobby people um new you would find

[52:25] a reason not to buy Kelly Daniel Kelly Kelly do you think do you think there was a reason to buy

[52:33] this game that I missed I'm talking to Kelly on Facebook right now he said I knew there was you

[52:38] were gonna find Kelly what what what what what what would make me want to buy this game what what

[52:43] do you think I miss that is like yeah man I should buy this game I should give Stern 13,000

[54:22] saying 14 man I can't wait francey I can't wait like I literally can't wait

[54:29] and I think I told you guys spoo keep pinball is giving canators pinball podcasts

[54:35] a few machines fully fully decked out butter cabinet topper everything I'm gonna ask him and maybe

[54:43] we might even but they might even put a little canada plaque on it for the canada club members

[54:48] they're going to give them to me to offer to some of my club members so if you get shut out and

[54:58] I think they're gonna sell out instantly I'm not scalping is I'm going to

[55:03] give people the opportunity to get them at cost I'm really excited to do that

[55:09] the first game I had to pose with for for photo very excited wow okay wow okay good good we're excited

[55:23] look I like the premium artwork yeah see once again stern

[55:27] stern just doesn't make the li special man I swear to god when I saw all three star wars here's

[55:33] what you never want to say when you see when I first saw all three star wars games together you

[55:38] know what the first thing I said is which one's the li you should never feel that way

[55:45] would you buy it for the kids said chance chance thank you for the $20 brother I really appreciate

[55:49] that I appreciate everybody that super chats it means a lot every donation to the show means a lot

[55:55] would you buy it for the kids now I mean my kids are too young for Star Wars too they had the

[56:00] Killian you know if I were gonna bring a pinball machine into the house right now that would make

[56:05] Killian go crazy it would be Paw Patrol and Lion King it wouldn't be Star Wars Chris are you going

[56:14] to be at Expo I plan to be at Expo how many beetle juices will they make why cap it with high

[56:21] demand they're gonna make 999 and the reason why spooky will cap it and never make more is they

[56:30] have integrity and they have business sense so by doing it they are gonna make a lot of money

[56:39] they have like very low overhead and they set themselves up for future success and so and they're also

[56:46] oh trying to reconnect oh here we go they also are future proofing the value of their product

[56:58] you know in a world in which Ellie means nothing now spooky pinball is the only company that has

[57:02] established itself as making very beautiful high-end bespoke valuable pinball now because by making

[57:13] only French I thought it was 999 yeah evil that was 888 yeah and also the price of beetle juices

[57:23] gonna be 9999 dollars get your nines out baby now obviously we're gonna put butter on there and

[57:31] you know toppers but they're smart smart and when you know you said something but why do that when

[57:40] there's more demand because just because they don't want to get stuck making one game for two

[57:45] years and they know their capacity and they know what they they can make a year and they want to make

[57:52] more than one game they were bored making 1900 and what is it like 56 or 69 Scooby-Doo's like they

[58:01] don't ever want to do that again and they also don't want to like split design amongst two themes

[58:06] they've they've made some you know missteps and they've they now like literally I can't

[58:12] for the life of me find anything anymore to complain about with spooky pinball they're gonna fix

[58:17] the monitor so it's not washed out I get the servos maybe the next thing that goes but in the end

[58:23] whenever I walk by an evil dead I literally like oh my gosh I don't even like evil dead and I really

[58:31] really want one of those that is crazy that is when you've hit the suburnal realm of creativity

[58:39] when you can make someone who doesn't even want the theme want the game

[58:48] maybe doings doing that for some people doesn't do it to me I just I still would I just you know

[58:54] but the more I see of doing the more I like of it you know I do I

[58:58] I you know I told us the david you just just just launched it at the wrong time you know the thing

[59:03] about david I always try to get this through to him I keep saying david there's two kids the ones

[59:10] who want to get credit for doing the homework and the ones who just do the homework better and don't

[59:15] give a sh about anything the cool kids right like gift it talented they need to stop being the

[59:22] company that wants to keep getting credit and they need to do cool stuff they didn't name their

[59:26] company something cool I I literally told them like you why did you name your company barrels of

[59:31] fun you did no market research you didn't test names people and when you announced it to be barrels of

[59:36] fun everybody laughed at you and that's the problem you only get you imagine of guns and roses

[59:41] imagine if guns and roses was called barrels of fun you could even have all that music but

[59:47] imagine having to go through life where people are like you have a pinball company what's the name of

[59:51] it barrels of fun is that what you want to say to someone in a in an airport do you want someone who

[59:56] drives a 9-11 turbo s hey man you should put a pinball machine in your house with your cool car

[01:00:03] and your hot wave and your beautiful decor oh cool what's the brand Jersey Jack pinball that sounds

[01:00:08] cool stern pinball love it right spooky pinball love it barrels of fun

[01:00:14] and and once you have to call something fun it immediately means it's not

[01:00:28] it's like calling a rock band like what's the name you band like the good music crew

[01:00:36] you know what I told them change the name I'm gonna I was like David I'm gonna give you the

[01:00:43] best advice change the name change the name yeah and then the abbreviation is bough change the name

[01:00:54] well it's your coming change the name nobody would care you don't have like a lineup you're

[01:01:01] not gonna distract anybody change the name I mean retro also you're funny man you're making me laugh

[01:01:12] out loud like what marketing is not everything Glenn but marketing matters and look the problem is is

[01:01:30] like is stubbornness and I deal with this at work every day the clients that get it are not stubborn

[01:01:39] the clients that get it take risks but they also like will change course if something's not working

[01:01:50] I you know and it's hard for me because I used to have like have really good friends that work at

[01:01:55] barrels and like they they've just kind of stopped talking to me and they think I'm being unfair and

[01:02:00] they think I'm I just I don't know man it's like you guys were my boys I'm like I'm a really good at

[01:02:06] my job you know I bill out at hundreds of dollars an hour and I would have helped you for free

[01:02:11] not land on that game I would have got a graphic designer to make a much better logo I would have

[01:02:17] called it something cool I would have made it something it's like this never it's like the the t-shirt

[01:02:25] is this cool enough that someone would want to wear a t-shirt right I'd rock a JJP t-shirt or JJP hoodie

[01:02:32] even just like JJP like it's just cool sounds cool stern yeah cool I love sterns like when

[01:02:36] when they do their their merch right barrels of fun I'm gonna roll into a bar with a barrels of fun

[01:02:44] t-shirt on you're not gonna lay that night again just change the name and they're gonna listen to

[01:02:48] this build you canator talked about like I said all this to David and he knows it he just he's stuck

[01:02:55] and you know what funny part is like just the only reason he stuck is because he has stuck himself

[01:03:01] there but he can also just get himself out of it and I think on the next game change the name

[01:03:07] you know it's funny because I also said to him he's funny we really have a great conversation

[01:03:12] he's like Chris I've got like five games in development I'm like David I'm gonna tell you right now

[01:03:15] three of them are shit I don't even I didn't even need to know what they are but I'm telling you

[01:03:20] right now three of them are gonna be shit and three of them you're not you should not make and

[01:03:24] you're gonna make you're gonna do what spooky deal with ultra man and you're gonna do something

[01:03:29] that's near and dear to you and you're not gonna do market research and it's gonna flop and you're

[01:03:34] gonna we're gonna have the same phone conversation in a year that you should have listened to me and

[01:05:04] join now like I will absolutely accept an apology from Glenn and unblock him and we can move past his

[01:05:10] comment about me being my sentiment around 9-11 not being authentic that I'm that I'm that I'm like

[01:05:18] I don't mean it is what he said I don't you know like I'll forgive him he said something stupid

[01:05:24] same thing with Albert like I've Albert they're not bad people like I don't I don't like hate anybody

[01:05:30] in this hobby I really don't like I forgave David fix like I'm not mad at David fix anymore

[01:05:37] you know literally tried to get me fired and I forgive him I understand why he was

[01:05:44] trying what he was trying to do because he knew that me saying disparaging things about his company

[01:05:51] could hurt company sales and I I don't I wish he wouldn't have done what he did I have two little

[01:05:57] boys and I have I need my paycheck to keep this family going and I but you know he he decided to go

[01:06:05] that route but again I don't wish him any ill will I I feel bad for him losing his job at

[01:06:14] American Pimball I think he made a lot of really questionable decisions and that's why the

[01:06:19] sales weren't there they make they screwed together a great game they just never had the right

[01:06:23] leadership you learn from me how to take the high road you know franche I think we learn from

[01:06:31] each other man I think we both went to dark places I think we both we we both realize how much

[01:06:39] more fun is it now right when you forgive and and also like I'm sorry man like I'm sorry that

[01:06:46] that those monsters pick Scott out you know that like I never you know it never should have happened

[01:06:52] and it was on me and I am sorry and I and I broke our trust and you know that and it was stupid

[01:06:59] and I learned a lot and I I've never since then broken trust or leaked something someone asked

[01:07:05] me not to I mean I had guns and roses in my phone for a year I never leaked any I you know I just

[01:07:10] out of respect for Eric and you know the hard work those people put into the game now when it comes

[01:07:14] to Sternst all leaked the shit out of all of it I gotta be on it is just like stirred stuff is just

[01:07:21] like so it's so annoying how like they're so precious about keeping everything under wraps and then

[01:07:25] when they finally reveal it like the the Star Wars game that lived in all of our heads is 10 times

[01:07:30] better than the one they showed us yesterday and that's the damn truth and that's why you

[01:07:35] subscribe to Canadian Spamble podcast because nobody else will say that Ralph's gonna like it it's

[01:07:41] fun Ian's like it's fun I not everybody's played it I've played it it's yeah family of course

[01:07:47] it's gonna be fun it's it's gonna be boring though after like a few weeks and you're just still

[01:07:51] shooting the same H shots I it got me out of Stern it look crunchy let's be honest it might have been

[01:08:02] one of the reasons there was other things you did as well like people sometimes blame me for your

[01:08:07] exit is turned but it's like it was a series of things right look in the end it all worked out

[01:08:14] right in the end I think every it all worked out for the best it really did and I think you're at

[01:08:19] the better place now to be so maybe you could should you thank me for that it's a weird right I feel

[01:08:27] like we're begging each other for like I have it like you're the plurable behavior was actually like

[01:08:32] in the end like thank you without without you being a debauch life wouldn't have been this great

[01:08:39] thank you Richard Aussie yeah the Beatles man I do I always felt like I always I saw the way Gary

[01:08:55] talked to you at that show and I just I was like this guy's gotta like that was that it was

[01:09:01] inappropriate how they treated you man and like they they they you know to your point of like

[01:09:07] this is how it is at these shows guys you're the ones who are out of touch like people sell this

[01:09:11] artwork they allow their artists to make some coin on the side they they never should have come

[01:09:17] down on you like that and it was because you know what it is is like the license holder wasn't coming

[01:09:22] down on them and they should have been like if I were them I just don't think they ever knew how to

[01:09:32] really handle you and it's a shame because you're a big personality to handle right and I think

[01:09:39] there's two ways you handle people I'm the same way I'm the same way I relate to you like I think

[01:09:43] my company's the same way with me they're like I like you gotta you gotta put up with the bad to

[01:09:48] get the good right and is if the good is worth it then we gotta let him be him and let him bake the

[01:09:54] way he bicks and you know my company supports me you know up until the day they probably let me go

[01:10:00] which is always the end of any agency career but you know it's they support me they support me

[01:10:06] doing this my CEO always had my back and so I think Stern just made the wrong decision in like

[01:10:13] instead of understanding who you were they tried to change who you were and I think you're now in

[01:10:21] a place that embraces who you are and I think because they do and they respect that you respect them

[01:10:29] more right I mean it always felt like Stern you know Stern's a place where like it's the corporation

[01:10:34] like you're kind of always at odds a little bit with leadership if you will I'm not sure they know

[01:10:43] how to manage people well you know like I mean I heard the rumors like like Jack danger was like

[01:10:50] trying to leave and you know Keith L ones unhappy you know you never hear like the rumors that like

[01:10:56] man everyone's loving it there dream job you know you know you never hear that from the people

[01:11:01] over there you never hear it well you don't you look even the fact that Christopher francey is here

[01:11:08] I want to I want to stay on this we have the artist from spooky pimble and Chris where are you

[01:11:16] right now like what what what's state are you in now we have the artist from spooky pimble in

[01:11:21] canada's pinball podcast live stream engaging with me and and all of you live in real time you

[01:11:30] Facebook guys get over to youtube we have you here that is amazing Jack danger comes here every

[01:11:38] once in a while we see dead flip popping whenever I talk about Jack how much I love him usually pops in

[01:11:42] it's like his ears ring or something bug in Luke hang out here where's John Borg

[01:11:50] Johnny where are you right never comes hangs out if I was a designer I'd be all I'd be I'd be all over

[01:11:58] dudes like me I'd be I'd be I'd be friends with canada I'd be because because each and every one of you

[01:12:06] it makes you feel better makes you feel better about supporting and buying

[01:12:11] games from this man mr francey and from bug and Luke it's called it's called like smart it's

[01:12:21] it's not just like smart business it's called being like a good human in a small niche community

[01:12:29] you know and the people that avoid canada and you know it's weird and not many people do you know

[01:12:37] I don't I don't I feel like I've got good relationship with people over at Stern JjP

[01:12:43] at barrels I don't have any relationship with CGC I mean like literally I just you know me I could

[01:12:49] care less about CGC I just I think the way they treat their customers and I don't even care that

[01:12:53] the medieval madness marlin edition is going out I don't care it's like cool wow you guys

[01:13:00] once again you guys made people wait a year and we radio silence cool nobody cares I'm boxing

[01:13:05] nobody cares I have a way to get here I did all the all of my own I'm gonna sell let's see

[01:13:13] Christopher francey as someone last night was saying how they got to meet elwin Gomez at pinball

[01:13:19] at the zoo and I'm like cool cool but was francey there he's from michigan and he's awesome

[01:13:29] boycott Stern trash company never will pay again spooky only

[01:13:35] canada the question everyone wants to answer is margo roby or sydney swiney

[01:13:43] I mean sydney swiney by a country mile she's so freaking hot and I as a grown man

[01:13:53] love saying that and I love that hot women are back baby they're back the woke the woke

[01:14:02] community that tried to sell us for years that hot women aren't like like that everybody's hot

[01:14:13] everybody's beautiful everybody's gorgeous yeah sure whenever the fashion labels went from the hot

[01:14:20] models to the plus side the sales went down like I'm just saying people are attracted to what they're

[01:14:27] attracted to and you know you had your chance you had your years of forcing all the hot women

[01:14:33] to the back of the group you know go watch it go watch just tv commercials for a minute

[01:14:39] and see the way the marketing world is out of touch every couple is like mixed couple the kids

[01:14:47] don't the kids can't even come from that couple you've got like it's usually like a white dude a

[01:14:53] beautiful black wife and a Chinese kid it's like who like who like who like that's what the

[01:14:59] marketing world turned into it's like what's wrong like it's cool I you know half my I really

[01:15:05] good friends are these two you know my two friends Devon and and and Mike like awesome black dudes

[01:15:12] or we have such a like they're my my buddies here and you know we just get along so great and

[01:15:18] we laugh they laugh at it all they're like this is like what what happened to the world where we

[01:15:22] just try to like flip everything in the end the high school quarterback is gonna be sleeping with

[01:15:30] the hot cheerleader okay it's just the way it goes the only way and this is what how we used to talk

[01:15:35] the only way that an unattractive man can land a beautiful woman is if you make a lot of money

[01:15:44] duh duh but that's the beauty is because it's okay also for women to be attracted to money

[01:15:56] I'm attracted to money we all are it's sexy you're like a like not that attractive but like rich

[01:16:03] friend it's amazing love it bottle service baby you know it's fun being around successful people

[01:16:12] they they they they they think about life different they enjoy life more

[01:16:19] ah yeah don't shave off your eyebrows was that Miley Cyrus just did that

[01:16:25] but I've nothing but women are the most amazing creatures like it's it's crazy to me too because

[01:16:30] the people that have been trying to take down women are like the progressive women

[01:16:36] you you notice that like it's it's progressive females that have really waged war against their own

[01:16:43] gender like guys never did that we never would do that like Maverick is still gonna get in the

[01:16:52] plain and kick ass right Ryan Johnson has Luke Skywalker throw the lightsaber over his shoulder

[01:16:58] and become a pacifist that's why we hate Disney and what it did to Star Wars

[01:17:05] you

[01:17:10] not all women and men are amazing yeah of course not I mean come on of course I'm generalizing there

[01:17:14] there are some real nasty well the carons of the world are funny right like that woman who

[01:17:19] stole the ball from the the Philly Karen stole the ball from the kid right wow wow my favorite

[01:17:27] story of the year still it's my favorite story of the year it is maybe my favorite

[01:17:33] like moment where like the internet just got it right and took something that happened in real life

[01:17:38] my favorite like this is just my favorite story maybe ever and I'll explain why because it was like

[01:17:44] to me it was like the most honest moment I think we've ever seen come from the internet

[01:17:49] and it was the astronomer CEO at the Coldplay concert to me got as a sense of humor because that is

[01:17:57] the greatest moment I've ever seen that everybody can relate to laugh at and and it couldn't have

[01:18:05] happened to two bigger a holes right like the the the family she's married into are billionaires

[01:18:12] like you're you're worth billions and you're gonna throw that away and he's a scumbag too and then

[01:18:20] they tried to now they're trying to spin it but the fact that they got caught on the kiss cam at

[01:18:25] Coldplay is the best part and the fact that Chris Martin stops the concert and says wow they

[01:18:31] there are really shy or having an affair the fact that he said that in in front of the whole stadium

[01:18:38] in amazing right and then now they're trying to spin it the husband's trying to create a new narrative

[01:18:44] her husband that they they've been separated before that incident happened or they were going through

[01:18:50] he's lying he's lying you know just just accept the fact that your wife sucks you they all suck they

[01:19:00] and the rest of the world loves watching these rich beautiful people do disgusting ugly things it

[01:19:07] was like in that like 10 seconds it was like an entire season of white load is I mean we are obsessed

[01:19:14] with eating the rich we love seeing that these rich beautiful people are really a lot of times

[01:19:22] evil in the heart right I never thrown my family away we're gonna go through some hard times

[01:19:31] I've been together with Brenda for 12 years I've never I always say this to Brenda I said Brenda thank

[01:19:36] you you are the only girl I've ever dated and only person I've ever loved where when I go to bed at

[01:22:20] in front of his wife and children and all the kids are watching it I'm gonna talk about a generation

[01:22:27] that shouldn't even like have to ever see that you know anyway life is short we expect big things

[01:22:39] from these pinball companies and the games are expensive and if you're gonna charge this much

[01:22:44] for Star Wars Stern you didn't know they didn't know let's just let me just close on Star Wars

[01:22:48] this should have been a game where all of Stern Pinball came together and said we're gonna make the

[01:22:53] best pinball machine Stern Pinball has ever made it's gonna be Star Wars I want Ellen in danger

[01:22:59] guys and the design team and you know the engine like we're putting the best people we have on this

[01:23:09] if we nail this and we nail it right we're gonna sell more of this game than everything else we

[01:23:16] have mapped out for the year they didn't do that it just feels like a company that is checking boxes

[01:23:22] and is is already on to the next and they're not focused on making the best example of what the

[01:23:29] organization is capable of and that is why people are are starting to really not care anymore

[01:23:37] we're really feeling like it's just another Stern and Stern can survive with that vibe I've

[01:23:44] been covering this hobby for 12 years I've never seen more apathy towards Stern than there is now

[01:23:51] and they did it to themselves they blew up the LE market they blew up their own model they

[01:23:58] were greedy they lied to their customers they were gonna continue to make LE's after you know

[01:24:04] they rerun LE's new Jurassic Park LE they literally went back to the well and burn their own

[01:24:08] customers that was all a business decision that telegraph we don't care about you the consumer all

[01:24:16] we care about is our distros placing the order when you really look at what Stern does

[01:24:22] everything is about getting that distro to place a big order they don't care right when they

[01:24:29] gave a viral to the distros and didn't price it they didn't care about you and me and then some

[01:24:36] distros charged 25,000 and some of you bought it

[01:24:49] guys keep it keep it clean all right and that's it and that's it and Stern needs a reset

[01:24:56] but they need a reset they need to call them meeting they need to hire a canada and everyone knows it
