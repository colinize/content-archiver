[00:00] Warning, this podcast contains extremely foul language.

[00:05] If you have young listeners, this will not be suitable for them.

[00:10] Do not say I did not warn you, turn off this podcast now and listen to it

[00:16] when your children are nowhere near. Let's go.

[00:20] What I did, baby is he never needs my children.

[00:25] What I did, baby is it the same for you.

[00:31] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

[00:35] You know if I was Pat Lawler, I'd be sitting back in a chair right now.

[00:40] A glass of whiskey, a cigar in my mouth.

[00:43] I'd open a pin-side and I'd be like, fuck these losers.

[00:48] Because that's all I see nowadays on pin-side.

[00:52] A bunch of grown men whining and crying about every little detail in a pinball machine.

[01:00] And here's the kicker that they haven't even flipped.

[01:03] These guys wake up, they're clearly bedwaters at an adult age.

[01:08] And I know it must be hard sleeping in all that piss every night

[01:12] that it makes you want to wake up, go on the internet and nitpick every little detail

[01:17] of a pinball machine to the point where these grown men suck the entire fun out of the hobby.

[01:24] Now I didn't want to do another pin-side baby's episode, but I have to.

[01:28] I feel compelled to.

[01:30] And I saw something bitched about that is honestly the most ridiculous and a name thing

[01:38] that has ever been bitched about in a pinball machine since I've been following this hobby.

[01:44] So Willy Wonka, say what you will about the pinball machine.

[01:47] We're going to talk a little bit about the bitching around that that just won't stop by all the guys who've never even fucking flipped it.

[01:53] Oh yeah, curse, you're going to hear a lot more cursing.

[01:56] But the thing that is really the problem with the game.

[01:59] The thing that really, you know, someone just didn't want to have to say this, but they did.

[02:04] And it gets all these upvotes by all the other bedwaters on pin-side.

[02:08] Here's the problem with Willy Wonka.

[02:10] It's not the innovation. It's not the toys. It's the logo of the game.

[02:14] But not just that. It's the logo has, it's been drawn wrong.

[02:20] And one letter in particular is being deconstructed.

[02:23] This is where we're at on a fucking pinball form.

[02:25] People are deconstructing letter by letter on a logo that says Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.

[02:33] And no other than Mr. Orrick Lawson, the king of all design, he found out that, you know,

[02:39] he couldn't quite put his finger on it, but then he realized that the original logo from the 1971 poster has been bastardized.

[02:47] And his example of the bastardization of the Willy Wonka logo was the letter H.

[02:53] Okay, the letter H, apparently when it was like scanned in and vectorized, the H, the bar across the two pillars of an H,

[03:02] it's no longer a circle, it's a line across.

[03:05] And let me tell you something, what the fuck is he talking about?

[03:09] Who the fuck would ever, in a million years, notice that?

[03:13] Who the fuck cares about that?

[03:16] It looks like the fucking Willy Wonka logo. Nobody, not anybody on planet earth, would fucking ever walk up to this machine and say,

[03:25] well, that Willy Wonka logo doesn't look right.

[03:28] And I'm not going to play this pinball machine. I'm going to shove my ass into this H until it buffs out into the right,

[03:34] fucking original H pattern. What the fuck people?

[03:39] We are nitpicking a fucking letter H on a logo that was supplied to them by fucking Warner Brothers.

[03:46] So who's he even fucking bitching to?

[03:49] And you've got to be kidding me. I'll tell you what the letter H stands for.

[03:53] Here's what H stands for in pinball these days.

[03:56] H stands for how? H-O-W.

[03:59] Like how in the fuck is this guy complaining again about assets from a license in a pinball machine?

[04:07] How the fuck is he still talking to us about the way a pinball machine should look after he got his shot with alien?

[04:14] Go take a look at alien and you tell me we are still listening to a dude who claims he knows how to work with a licensor in assets.

[04:22] He's like, I work with Microsoft and we went back and forth with seven to eight emails about

[04:27] H-H-H-H-H. Hey, hey, ork, I get what you do. I'm not knocking you personally.

[04:32] I bet you do a great job at ours technical. But the bottom line is this.

[04:36] Why are you posting this? Why are you nitpicking about a fucking letter in a logo that looks like the Willy Wonka logo?

[04:43] It wasn't like this logo looks like it's in a Sega font or some other thing.

[04:47] I mean, bitching about this is like looking at an aerial shot of Central Park and bitching that there's one autumn leave on the ground.

[04:55] And yet 24 bedwaters or 25 bedwaters on pinside are all up voting this.

[05:01] Oh, now I can't see this game the same way ever again.

[05:04] If you can't see this game the same way ever again after seeing that age, let me tell you go fuck yourselves.

[05:11] Seriously, get off of pinside, get off the internet and stop acting like fucking losers.

[05:18] Like this is a loser thing to nitpick.

[05:21] And for those people saying, oh, chanada's being hypocritical, he nitpick, but get the fuck out of here.

[05:26] I've played this game. I've stood over this game.

[05:29] There are things I understand people will debate with this game, but the letter fucking age in the logo of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is something people are complaining about and up voting and saying,

[05:41] oh, thank you for the lesson on how it could have been done better.

[05:46] You guys are fucking sad. Like it's gotten to the point where the fact that you're nitpicking at this stuff, you know what it tells me?

[05:54] It tells me the game's a home run because you don't have a lot to nitpick.

[05:57] And I know what Orrick's doing. He did this with, you know, I'm trying to get back to where I was with the hobbit where I got Jack to change the play field.

[06:04] And yes, you did. And yes, Orrick, we appreciated everything you did with your feedback there, but this feedback is fucking pathetic.

[06:11] This is not like this. I hope it gets redrawing or I'm not going to buy this game.

[06:16] If you don't buy this game because of the letter H in the chocolate factory, I think you've got fucking problems.

[06:23] I think you have other problems in life that are not going to be solved no matter what way they draw the fucking Willy Wonka logo.

[06:29] Seriously, I don't understand. This is what we're complaining about.

[06:32] And then for those of you guys out there who are shitting all over the game who have never played it, you, all of you, take a big step back and literally just go fuck your own face.

[06:40] And then you're going to fuck your own face because it's getting ridiculous. How about you play the game?

[06:45] How about you flip the game? How about you stop moaning and groaning about everything in this game?

[06:49] And here's my question for all you bedwaters on Pinside. Here's my one question for you.

[06:53] If you think this game sucks and you think this game lacks innovation and you think this game doesn't give you a lot for the money and you think this game has nothing new going on.

[07:02] Let me ask you one question. All of you bedwaters. What other game that has come out in the last five years has given you more than this?

[07:09] What other game that you've bought have you applauded and thought was great? What other options do you have?

[07:14] What are you even fucking comparing this to? What? You want to keep going back to like a few games from the mid 90s when Bally Williams had a huge fucking team of people making mex around the clock and pinball games were selling 10 to 20,000 units a fucking year.

[07:29] You want to go back then and say games should be like that all over again. Fine. This is as close as you're going to get to that.

[07:35] But what other game recently are you comparing really wanted to that makes you so fucking upset about what Pat Lawler and the JJP team put into this game?

[07:45] I'll tell you what you're going to find a big fat zero nothing. So you're just bitching about the game that you thought was in your head.

[07:53] And you guys need to stop living in your fucking heads. No, there's no chocolate fucking river in the fucking game.

[07:59] I'm sure the chocolate river scenes will come across just fine in the game. You expect it like the game needed to have every single fucking thing from the movie on the fucking play field.

[08:09] And if it didn't you were going to cry like babies and let me ask all you pin side bedwaters out there. How many of you motherfuckers know how to design a pinball machine?

[08:17] How many of you motherfuckers know how to like mechanically engineer something that goes into a pinball machine?

[08:22] And which pinball company is giving you the best in modern day when it comes to that stuff in a pinball game. And yet here come the arrows, here come the lashes, here come the internet commandos who know better than Pat Lawler.

[08:35] How a pinball machine can be designed. I mean these dingle berries are challenging and questioning Pat Lawler and his ability to design good pinball machines.

[08:45] And he's at the point now where if I was Pat and I was Jack and I was all these guys they should just pull an Atlas shrugged and all the talented people in the pinball hobby should just say fuck all you guys.

[08:57] We're going away and you can enjoy your fucking TNAs. Yeah fucking TNA gets applauded and heralded as like one of the greatest games on pin side. Look at pin side going to the TNA everyone's like cheering TNA.

[09:10] Hey there's fucking nothing in that game. Nothing but yet pin side they loved TNA and pin side picks the games that it will root for and then it picks the games that it slams.

[09:21] And you know what you guys need to realize and again this podcast is not for most of my listeners because most of my listeners are fucking cool dudes and I've hung out with a lot of them and they're awesome people.

[09:32] The podcast is for the pin side baby so don't get offended if you hear this and think I'm talking about you because I'm not the majority of the hobby the majority of the hobby consists of people that actually get laid.

[09:45] Okay the majority of the pin side babies do not okay the majority of you who listen to this podcast you get out of your bed in the morning and it's dry.

[09:54] The pin side babies get out of their bed in the morning and it's wet they've wet the bed okay and then they're cranky and they go on the pin side and they moan about something else.

[10:02] You know they don't know how to fucking design a pinball machine they don't know how to put a fucking chocolate river into a game they don't know shit.

[10:08] All they do is know how to bitch about every game and it sucks the fun out of the hobby they need to just you know and the thing about this that's funny to me is the truth is that oric is not buying another new unbox game probably ever.

[10:21] And you get these guys who are moaning about Willy Wonka and let me tell you they're not buying the game you know these guys would be such a life of a party it's like they come over your house and you're having a house party and they pick out the one glass that is a little bit dirty and they complain about it.

[10:36] That's the equivalent of bitching about the age and the logo but these guys aren't even buyers and so that's this like this this ridiculous this ridiculous notion that these guys watch a stream they're not even in on a game and they just moaning grown and bitch about it.

[10:50] Right if I was Pat Lawler I would be like oh you don't like the game okay cool you know hey can I come over let's talk about it and then I would shove the goddamn gobs stop or mechanism up their butts because these guys nothing will make them happy.

[11:03] I thought there'd be like I thought there'd be like levitating balls and I thought there'd be projecting up on the moon.

[11:08] No there's no fucking projected oompa loompas get over it fuckers there's no projected oompa loompas and the other thing look what they're bitching about.

[11:16] I don't really like the candy red armor why are they giving sparkled candy red armor in the game it should have been purple.

[11:22] Hey should have been go fuck yourself because it's the nicest armor package that any pinball company is giving people out there and you're fucking bitching about it.

[11:30] Well I'd be bye bye I would rather have it this I like my game stainless steel fuck you and your stainless steel fucking request if you want a stainless steel game I'm sure they'll make it for you you know why because stainless steel is the cheapest fucking armor package you can put on the game.

[11:44] So go ahead and have it you fucking bed wetters this game is gorgeous it looks nice when you flip it I think you're gonna love it.

[11:54] Sure there are some things that could be different but why why does pinside why do they harp on every single thing that should be different and they would change and no one actually sees what should be enjoyed in the game.

[12:08] Don't you get tired don't you get tired all of you fucking babies out there you know who I'm talking about signing into pinside every day maybe it's because no one talks to you in the fucking lunch room at work maybe because you didn't get that promotion you know maybe you're creative director.

[12:24] Hey I'm an executive creator director I outranked creative directors but maybe I don't know anything maybe maybe maybe you know that logo's okay okay maybe it works yeah I think they should change the side art but man bitching about the fucking age anyway.

[12:36] I don't know what the causes of of your everyday behavior complaining about everything and don't you guys also understand the fucking context of life.

[12:44] Let me break it down for you I'm sure all of you have much bigger issues you have children you have family members you have health issues you have other things that are weighing on your mind.

[12:54] What leads you to have to go on to pinside and act like a fucking bed wetter every day I don't get it why can't you see the good in some of this stuff.

[13:04] And look we're critical of games and everything but someone this is it the nitpicking it's just getting out of control you don't see any innovation in games you don't see like what do you want what do you want you want you want you want everything to be connected to the internet you want everything this that yes that's going to come in pinball but what would you actually want in a pinball game and how do you stand over a game like will you want to not get fucking excited.

[13:25] Alright so that's all I'm saying you pinside fucking babies it's time to stop your nitpicking jump on the game stop relying on these dumb streams is the only way in which you can fucking experience a pinball machine and the streams aren't all fucking dumb you know I love the streamers I'm not so I'm not fucking trying to get them upset now at my door but you can't figure out an opinion based on a stream.

[13:46] And you definitely as hell should not be spending your time shoving your balls next to the cabinet side art and saying this is the most important part of a pinball game it's not it's fucking not and it came from Warner Brothers you know or if you called up Warner Brothers and said hey I think you should really they fucking hang up the phone immediately and it's just that simple it works fine there are things I would like to see different in Willy Wonka and the age is not fucking one of them alright.

[14:14] Alright before I sign off on this episode of pinside fucking babies because I get to curse because I told you guys with children don't listen to this fucking episode I also like this is like I'm going to just say one thing about pinball podcasting and I'm not going to say it again because I'm so tired I'm you know and look I'm taking the high road on all my other shows you're going to hear Josh Kugler next but here's the fucking thing I just want to say for the love of God for the love of that all is sacred in this world can pinball podcasters stop you from being a kid.
