[00:00] So the Canadian club members heard this before the rest of the world that Lyman Sheets

[00:22] and Mr. Josh Sharp have joined Chicago Gaming Company to help them with Cactus Canyon

[00:28] and future projects moving forward with CGC.

[00:32] Now it's really interesting about this move and I want to talk about this before I get

[00:36] into other stuff happening in Pimball.

[00:38] It's a huge move for CGC.

[00:40] Obviously for those out there, Cactus Canyon is a game that has a ton of toys.

[00:45] It is a game that has a good layout.

[00:47] It's one of the classic Bally Williams games that most collectors seek out.

[00:51] Mainly for its rarity and mainly because it was I think the last game before they called

[00:57] the quits was Cactus Canyon.

[00:58] That's why they never finished it.

[01:00] Now we've got the greatest coder in Pimball history is over at CGC.

[01:06] Now this is probably the greatest pick up by any Pimball company this year.

[01:11] This is way better than Steve Richie going over to Jersey Jack Pimball.

[01:15] This is way better than Dennis Nordman going over to American Pimball because nobody.

[01:21] And I mean this, nobody makes a game more fulfilling, more long lasting, more than the

[01:27] more enjoyable for both casual players and for hardcore players than Lyman Sheets.

[01:34] Lyman Sheets is the greatest conductor in Pimball software history.

[01:38] And what I mean by that, like a conductor standing in front of all the different elements

[01:43] of a Pimball machine, he knows how to make the entire thing come together.

[01:48] And I've loved playing his games and I think everybody would agree.

[01:52] He's not the easiest to work with.

[01:55] That's why he took forever and a day when he was working over at Stern Pimball.

[01:59] And clearly, clearly there was some reason why he left, right?

[02:03] I mean, he did Batman.

[02:05] He did Walking Dead.

[02:07] He did El Vira.

[02:08] He's done a lot of really good games.

[02:10] He did Metallica.

[02:11] Like the Lyman hit factory just kept going and going and going.

[02:15] He did ACDC.

[02:17] Why would Stern Pimball let him leave?

[02:19] Unless there was some issue with working with Lyman.

[02:23] Is it a huge loss for Stern Pimball?

[02:26] Possibly?

[02:27] Possibly and I say possibly because Stern has really hired a ton of people in the code

[02:32] department.

[02:33] And it's really probably not going to affect too many of the Stern machines moving forward

[02:37] because as I'm looking at Godzilla, it looks like they know what they're doing really

[02:41] well over at Stern these days.

[02:43] When you see these modern games, Stern really does understand how to implement all this

[02:47] stuff in a way that really, really works.

[02:50] Will it get to the level of Lyman sheet coding perfection?

[02:54] We don't know yet, right?

[02:55] We don't know yet.

[02:56] I haven't seen a Keith L. Wynne game that has code that's as good as anything Lyman

[03:01] Sheets has ever done.

[03:02] But the dream will never come true, right?

[03:04] We were always dreaming that one day Stern Pimball would have Keith L. Wynne, Zombie Eddie, and

[03:11] Lyman Sheets all work on the same game together.

[03:14] And what was always weird at Stern is they never put Lyman on the big juggernauts recently,

[03:20] right?

[03:21] They didn't put Lyman on stranger things.

[03:22] They didn't put him on Game of Thrones.

[03:24] They didn't put him on Star Wars.

[03:26] They didn't put him on the Mandalorian.

[03:28] He was always on these more like obscure titles.

[03:31] More recently he was on more of like the obscure titles like El Vira and Batman 66.

[03:37] And also Josh Sharp is joining CGC as well.

[03:40] And that's the other bit in use I told the Canadian Club.

[03:42] Josh Sharp, the president of the IFPA, the brother of Zack Sharp over at Stern Pimball,

[03:49] and the son of Roger Sharp, the man that saved Pimball.

[03:51] I think Roger Sharp is working with American Pimball.

[03:55] So the Sharp family is very divided across the Pimball landscape.

[03:59] It must be really interesting having dinner over at the Sharp household these days because

[04:04] they really have a lot of proprietary inside information that they should not be sharing

[04:09] with each other because it's a conflict of interest.

[04:13] So I would love it and Canadian saying right now I would love to sit at the Thanksgiving

[04:17] dinner table with the Sharp family and say, Hey guys, what's going on?

[04:21] What are you working on?

[04:22] And I would have almost 80% of the Pimball news delivered to me by those three gentlemen.

[04:28] I'm going to talk a little bit why I'm annoyed with Ryan White over at CGC because I do

[04:33] a Pimball podcast in which I put up news rumors and speculation.

[04:38] And every once in a while I'll put up a rumor.

[04:40] And a rumor means I'm hearing this but I can't confirm this is true.

[04:44] I don't have multiple sources confirming it's true.

[04:47] And there's a difference between a rumor and a confirmation.

[04:50] Okay, and there's a big difference.

[04:51] And I know a lot of times people like to take my rumors and say, Hey, look, he was wrong.

[04:56] It's a rumor.

[04:57] A rumor is not a confirmation.

[04:59] But when I say something is confirmed, it is because I have from a very good source that

[05:05] this is accurate.

[05:07] And I know and I trust that source that this is not wrong because there's some sort of

[05:11] firsthand knowledge that the thing I'm going to tell you as my listener is accurate.

[05:16] And I have a bone to pick with Ryan White and here's what that bone to pick is.

[05:20] I knew from someone working on the project at CGC that Lyman Sheets had joined CGC from

[05:27] Stern Pimball had been over there for a while.

[05:30] And in August, I confirmed that Lyman Sheets was over working on Cactus Canyon with

[05:36] Chicago Gaming Company.

[05:38] And I put up a post that said Lyman Sheets confirmed working on CGC's Cactus Canyon.

[05:45] And this is what Ryan White said to me.

[05:47] He hit me up when I posted that on my Facebook page and he said, it's not true.

[05:53] And I said, really?

[05:54] This is actually our conversation.

[05:56] I said, really?

[05:57] I have 10 people saying Lyman is at CGC.

[06:00] Are you saying no?

[06:01] If it's not true, I'll retract.

[06:04] And he wrote back to me word for word.

[06:07] I wish it was true.

[06:09] Please retract.

[06:10] I appreciate it.

[06:12] Okay.

[06:13] So Ryan White is saying that in August, Lyman Sheets wasn't working on anything with them,

[06:17] which I know is a lie.

[06:18] And then I said, okay.

[06:20] And just to confirm, Lyman not with CGC and he wrote, nope, he is not.

[06:26] Okay.

[06:27] And I let this slide.

[06:28] I let this slide.

[06:29] Look it down and I knew it was true and it is true.

[06:32] But I was doing him a favor by taking it down.

[06:34] Now, I understand if he wanted to break this news to the world and he didn't want

[06:38] Canada to have this scoop, that's one thing.

[06:41] But what you can't do ethically as a company is knowingly, knowingly denies something that

[06:48] is true.

[06:49] What you can't do as a company and I do this for a living if a media outlet scoops us

[06:54] and shows pictures.

[06:55] Let's say they show spy photos of the Corvette 06 being tested.

[07:00] Chevrolet is not going to go to that outlet and say, can you take those photos down?

[07:04] There is no 06 Corvette coming out.

[07:07] And that is exactly what Ryan White did to me.

[07:09] He said, can you take it down?

[07:10] Lyman Sheets is not with CGC.

[07:12] He's not working with CGC on Cactus Canyon.

[07:15] And so that's unethical to do that.

[07:17] He should have either said no comment or you'll just have to wait to see what's happening

[07:20] at CGC.

[07:21] But for him to ask me to take it down, I had an issue with.

[07:25] Now I let it slide.

[07:26] I let it slide a couple months go by.

[07:28] And Ryan calls me this week and is like, big news.

[07:31] He tells me what's happening and he says to me this.

[07:33] He's like, you know, I'm going to give you the scoop on this.

[07:36] I'm going to let you report that not just Lyman Sheets, but also Josh Sharp is going over

[07:41] to CGC.

[07:43] And I'm going to give you the scoop and you're going to be allowed to say it exclusively

[07:46] to your listeners.

[07:47] And I'm like, okay, I'll work with this guy.

[07:49] I know that last time he burned me on this, but I'll work with him on this.

[07:53] And so what happens?

[07:54] He tells me he's going to get me everything to put up and I said, look, Ryan, the scoop

[07:59] I took down for you that is now accurate.

[08:02] You're now asking me to hold it back to a date we agree upon.

[08:05] I was like, you know what?

[08:06] I'll do that.

[08:07] And he said, look, you can have it.

[08:08] I'm going to give you all the information Wednesday night and you can go live Thursday

[08:11] with everything.

[08:12] I'm like, okay.

[08:13] So Wednesday night comes nothing.

[08:15] And I said, look, if I don't get information, Wednesday night, I'm going out with it.

[08:18] Now I went out with it to my club members.

[08:20] I didn't go out with it to anyone else.

[08:22] And then he said, don't talk about Josh Sharp.

[08:25] I will get you the Josh Sharp information by Thursday late afternoon.

[08:30] And that's what he said to me Thursday late afternoon comes.

[08:34] Ryan, do you have anything for me?

[08:36] Ignores me.

[08:37] Ignores me.

[08:38] Okay.

[08:39] So I go out with the Josh Sharp information.

[08:41] He also said to me, I will not put out the press release until Monday.

[08:45] All right.

[08:46] He said, money is like Chris, I'll give you the entire end of the week and the weekend

[08:49] to have the exclusive on this.

[08:51] And Monday I'm putting out the press release.

[08:53] Okay.

[08:54] Great.

[08:55] Thank you.

[08:56] I appreciate it.

[08:57] What happens Friday?

[08:58] He just dumps the press release.

[08:59] Absolutely no communication.

[09:00] And my big beef is this.

[09:01] It's Ryan.

[09:02] You called me up.

[09:04] You asked me to help you get this news out there in an exciting way.

[09:09] And I did you a favor by taking down that Lyman thing last time.

[09:12] And then you just go MIA.

[09:14] You don't live up to anything you said you were going to do.

[09:17] You didn't give me anything when you said you were going to give it to me.

[09:20] And I just want to say this to all my listeners.

[09:22] I've done over 600 podcasts about pinball.

[09:25] I take my reporting very seriously.

[09:27] Yes, I want to have fun.

[09:29] Yes, I want to entertain.

[09:31] But when I'm telling you something is going to happen because someone at a company told

[09:35] me they were going to give it to me on that date.

[09:38] I don't like being burned like that.

[09:41] If I tell you David Fix is going to come on the show this week and then David Fix

[09:45] doesn't get back to me all week.

[09:47] That doesn't make me happy because it makes me look like I don't know what's going on

[09:51] with my own show.

[09:53] It makes me look like in this case, I don't know what's going on with this information.

[09:56] And I work too hard at this show.

[09:59] And I want to work with these manufacturers.

[10:01] But what is he doing?

[10:02] Like what are you doing, Ryan?

[10:04] This is not how you deal with people.

[10:06] If you say you're going to do something, just do it.

[10:10] And don't engage me if you don't want to work with me.

[10:12] But don't go both ways.

[10:13] He plays both sides of it.

[10:15] And it's really weird.

[10:16] It's really strange.

[10:18] And I know most of you don't really care because we know that this game is going to be

[10:21] pretty incredible.

[10:23] And this game is going to be pretty awesome.

[10:25] And I look forward to seeing it.

[10:26] And this is the last I'm going to talk about it.

[10:28] But I just want to say Ryan, now all my listeners know.

[10:31] And you know as you hear this that you need to act more professionally with your brand

[10:38] because it's not cool to say you're going to get me stuff and then burn me.

[10:42] And then he's still not responding to his text messages.

[10:44] Like I love it.

[10:45] I love these grown men who engage me.

[10:48] And then they just disappear.

[10:49] Now I'm here to tell you right now.

[10:51] I hope this doesn't detract because David Fix said he's coming on the show Monday.

[10:56] Monday night we're going to talk.

[10:57] And David, I think it's going to be a really good conversation.

[11:00] But let's do it.

[11:01] I hope it happens.

[11:02] And if I sound a little bit irritated, it's because I have a baby who is seven months

[11:07] old.

[11:08] He's got bronchialitis.

[11:10] He's been coughing all night.

[11:11] I've had no sleep for a week.

[11:13] And for me to schedule an interview with people, I have to schedule a lot.

[11:18] It's not just me and David Fix and Bren is out having drinks with friends.

[11:22] No, I need to make sure that I can move everything around.

[11:25] I need to make sure I time it with his schedule of his sleep.

[11:29] And he's also not feeling well.

[11:30] So I hope that people understand that when we're scheduling something in a day, I really

[11:35] need to make sure that we live up to that schedule.

[11:38] And I think that's the way grown professionals are supposed to deal with each other.

[11:42] And I just think it's a sign of respect.

[11:44] It's a sign of respect.

[11:45] If you say you're going to email someone something at a certain time or get them something,

[11:50] you get it to them or you communicate why you didn't get it to them.

[11:54] And if you're going to say you're going to go on a show this week, you go on the show

[11:57] that week or you communicate why you didn't go on the show this week, right?

[12:01] That's it.

[12:02] It's common courtesy.

[12:03] And I think I've earned it enough in this pinball community.

[12:06] Alright, let's switch gears to pinball because I know you don't want to hear me just

[12:09] go on rants about a miscommunication with the pinball manufacturer.

[12:12] And this is why.

[12:13] This is why I really don't care about being friends with all these manufacturers because

[12:17] this is what happens.

[12:18] It's like you try to build these relationships and these bridges.

[12:21] I'd rather just tell you what I know.

[12:23] And you heard it here first.

[12:24] Like you heard it here first that Lyman Sheets was working at CGC.

[12:28] You didn't hear it anywhere else.

[12:29] You heard it here first that Josh Sharp was going over to CGC.

[12:33] If you were a club member.

[12:34] Now speaking of club members, I have to say the best news I got all week.

[12:38] And you guys are the best fans like Canadian pinball podcasts.

[12:41] I have the best fans on Facebook.

[12:44] I have the best fans who listen to the podcast.

[12:46] I have the best club member fans.

[12:48] You guys are unreal.

[12:49] Like I went into this week with a little over 168 Canadian club members.

[12:56] And I'm here to tell you right now.

[12:57] We are now at 191 club members for the Canadian club on Patreon.

[13:03] And this is amazing.

[13:04] I'm going to give you guys a shout out because all of you who do this, it means so much to

[13:09] me and my family that you guys show this support.

[13:12] And I'm going to give you guys a shout out.

[13:14] James M. Mike T. Carl S. Brian M. Jesse B. M.K.

[13:21] Pimball Reborn.

[13:22] Rizzo James A. Michael Wufanaz.

[13:27] Adam.

[13:28] Chris C. Tim W. Jeff K. Kurt B. Harry R. R. K. Time.

[13:34] Mark D. Mike V. Raymond J. Joey M. Steve M. Sebastian C. Jonathan K.

[13:42] Eric S. Daniel B. I think that's like this is all since like September 26th.

[13:47] But most of this is all this week, which is incredible.

[13:50] So thank you so much.

[13:51] And if you're listening to this right now and you're like, man, I've been on the fence

[13:54] about showing support to Canadian.

[13:56] Maybe I should because I've listened to every episode for five years.

[14:00] Just hit me up.

[14:01] Just go to Patreon.

[14:02] Go to Canadian Pimball.

[14:04] It's super easy and it'll make you feel real good deep down inside.

[14:08] Alright, so what's going on in Pimball?

[14:09] Let's get right to it.

[14:10] So spooky Pimball dropped a code update on Halloween.

[14:14] I just watched it.

[14:16] Doug put out about a 10 minute video and he said like a much needed code update for the

[14:21] game.

[14:22] And I watched the 10 minutes of it.

[14:24] And I want to tell you here's my here's my thoughts on this game.

[14:27] I want to say this because bug kept saying throughout he kept saying like we've got 15 to

[14:31] 16 clips and you're going to see him over here and you're going to see him over here.

[14:36] Here's what I think is happening because I just went through the whole 10 minutes of

[14:39] this game and I watched him play it and I want to say I don't think you're ever going

[14:43] to see much of this movie in this game.

[14:46] And I think we just have to come to grips with that.

[14:49] Here's why because they keep saying that they have clips that range from 3 to 6 seconds

[14:54] long and they have 15 of them or 16 of them.

[14:58] So here's the thing.

[14:59] If you take the fact that these are two movies right like three hours of content for these

[15:04] Halloween movies and you put on average four seconds times 15.

[15:12] It's only 64 seconds of clips.

[15:15] So I think that's what's happening here.

[15:17] I think they're sort of falling back on this number of clips they have but the truth is

[15:23] if you look at a game like Godzilla it looks like there are hundreds of clips they pulled

[15:29] from when you look at Batman 66 it looks like there are hundreds of clips that they pulled

[15:35] from not just stuff that loops but all the different scenes from all the different shows

[15:40] there's so much going on and my concern with this game continues to be this that if you

[15:45] love the movie I'm just not sure how much of that movie is going to be integrated into

[15:51] this pinball experience based upon other theme integrations you've experienced recently.

[15:58] And I watched it and I'm like waiting for this moment where I feel like I'm in these films

[16:03] and I'm just not sure it's coming across and I'm not trying to be harsh but I think what's

[16:09] happening here is a lesson in premature purchasing and once again we all said we're not going

[16:15] to do it and we all feel like we have to do it but if you bought this game and you're seeing

[16:20] this game right now and you're a die hard Halloween fan I don't know how you look at what's going

[16:26] on and how the theme is being integrated into this game and how you look at the code of this game

[16:33] and you feel like those two movies that you love are coming through at you and I think Spooky's

[16:40] hands are tied I think they wanted to put more into this but I think the guy that owns the rights

[16:45] to these movies was very restrictive in terms of his vision for this game that he did not want to see

[16:53] scenes from the movie looping over and over they wanted to do it more like this here's my problem

[16:59] with the way I see this game unfolding when you start a mode don't you want it to be a scene from

[17:05] the movie and then every time you hit a shot shouldn't it be like another three to five seconds

[17:11] of that scene building so that maybe you have a total of at least like a minute or two from the scene

[17:18] in that movie then you chop up that scene and make it the mode let's say you have to hit eight to

[17:23] 12 shots to get through that mode you're seeing eight to 12 movie clips based upon that scene in the film

[17:30] that's how it's usually done that's how you usually take like iconic scenes from movies or TV

[17:36] shows and implement them into a pinball experience I'm just not seeing that here I don't think they

[17:43] can even do that with the assets they have and how the game is being designed from a code standpoint

[17:49] I also think the big thing happening right now is that spooky pinball is making two games at once

[17:56] and phasma games who's doing the coding in this I think he's got way too much on his plate having to

[18:02] deal with two games at the same time it takes a really long time to do code in one pinball machine

[18:10] let alone two and so when you think about the amount of time they've had to work on these games

[18:15] as rick and morty was wrapped up for a very long time code wise and then you see both of these games

[18:21] and they're both coming out and they're so beautiful like the art packages and the shot

[18:26] geometry the way these games shoot is incredible but I want to use an analogy like I think these

[18:32] games are like filet mignon and lobster they're both super delicious we both look at both of these

[18:39] pins and our eyes light up and our mouths water and we want them right they look so good and they

[18:46] shoot so good but because they have two games to code and they don't have enough resources to really

[18:51] make each one sing at the same time both of those dishes are being messed up in the kitchen what's

[18:58] happening is we're serving you like an uncooked steak and an uncooked piece of fish and now all the

[19:04] sudden that steak and lobster you want is not appetizing everyone's taking the first bite of it

[19:10] and they're being like this isn't good enough like you want to send it back to the kitchen I think

[19:15] everyone who's seeing these games right now kind of wants to send those games back to the kitchen or

[19:20] back to spooky and say these aren't ready yet these are not ready to serve to customers and I think

[19:25] everyone's feeling that way nobody really wants to say it canada always has to say it canada has to

[19:31] be the bad guy the good news is this the good news is this for everyone who's in on Halloween and

[19:35] everyone who's in on ultra man here's the best news of the day the two things you can't change on a

[19:41] game are the artwork and the layout they've nailed that on both of these games the one thing you can

[19:48] change for years to come is the software so that's the good news that is the most promising news of

[19:56] this game shoots so well it shoots so much better than Rick and Morty it shoots so much better

[20:02] than every other spooky game so you're gonna love shooting this game this game also looks

[20:08] incredible both of these games look so much better than anything they've done before I would

[20:12] argue that ultra man even looks way better than Godzilla I'm just gonna say it ultra man even

[20:18] looks better than Godzilla it captures that spirit of that franchise better than Godzilla does not

[20:24] to say Godzilla doesn't look good but man look at the cabinet and the play field on ultra man it's

[20:29] like perfect there's nothing I would change but the code continues to be the albatross on these two

[20:37] titles can Fosma do it is he up for the task is this good enough considering what we're seeing over

[20:44] with Godzilla right I mean when I'm watching the Godzilla stream and I saw them stream the pro yesterday

[20:49] Jack Danger stream the pro with bells and chimes it was a really really fun stream it was really

[20:55] awesome to see these women who are incredible that pinball throwing these machines around and showing

[21:00] us Godzilla pro I will say their pinball skills are insane I will also say that Godzilla pro just

[21:08] isn't the way to go like I was missing all of the toys like all of the destruction of Tokyo and all

[21:13] the cities all that movement all those toys add so much to this game I would go nowhere near a

[21:20] Godzilla pro I'm sorry stern finally engineered the most amazing mechs I would go nowhere near the pro

[21:27] you need to get that building that building is one of the coolest mechs stern is ever done but my

[21:33] point being when I'm watching them stream the game and I'm seeing all of the clips of Godzilla there's

[21:38] so much in it and the animations are awesome and the sound is awesome and the music is awesome it's

[21:44] so well done on day one and stern has a huge team that's working on these games and I just don't

[21:52] think Fosma is at the level of what stern is at now here's the part where it just gets a little

[21:58] ridiculous a Godzilla premium is the same price as Ultraman and the same price as Halloween so if

[22:06] you want to charge me what this company is charging me then you better deliver something that's as

[22:11] equally good you know Spooky's riding an incredible wave of goodwill and good faith by the community

[22:19] but I think it's time they need to invest more money in the code department I'm just not seeing

[22:24] stuff on that screen that looks as good as it needs to look and you guys all know this you all know

[22:30] it and I'll be the one to say it I'll say it to them at expo I still love this company and they made

[22:36] the best shooting game they've ever made but the code is letting this game down and I didn't see

[22:42] anything during the October 1st stream that really radically changes my mind it doesn't I think they

[22:49] really need to sit in a room and say what are we doing here how do we get this movie more into this

[22:54] game and can we do it and Ultraman might end up being the winner because they might have an

[22:59] easier time dropping all of those Ultraman TV shows into this game and they can't do the same

[23:05] for Halloween so we'll see it's also why I'm Ultraman number 500 because by the time I get my game

[23:12] all of this is going to be figured out so that's why I'm like give me number 500 because 18

[23:17] months from now you best believe this game will be done all right so speaking of games being done

[23:22] did you check out the trailer for Magic Girl the game that just never dies Magic Girl there are a

[23:28] few incredible gentlemen I believe they're over in the Netherlands they have spent the last few

[23:33] years deconstructing John pop deduques beautiful nightmare known as Magic Girl and they went through

[23:39] the game and they fixed all of the issues with it they fixed as much as they could fix they

[23:46] engineered a lot to get this game working there's gonna be a longer video that's about 30 minutes

[23:51] long that should drop any day now that is gonna go over all of the features of this game that they

[23:57] created now I've been talking to these gentlemen they're really awesome guys you know and when they

[24:03] say like the reason they did this is because the game is too beautiful not to work so thank god for

[24:08] vanity in this world and it is the sexiest pinball machine of all time it still is it still is you

[24:14] still cannot look at a Magic Girl and not get excited it is the greatest looking pinball machine to date

[24:20] the other question is are they gonna release kits so people who have broken Magic Girls can change

[24:26] their game to work like this because they didn't just do mechanical stuff they also coded the game

[24:31] and did a lot with it so I've been talking to them and the plan is to do that the problem is how much

[24:39] is a kick gonna cost and who's gonna do the work because most people who bought Magic Girl were

[24:44] just rich collectors they're not guys that are like mechanically inclined to do this kind of work

[24:50] so I think the only way this is gonna work is if these gentlemen have a partnership with someone like

[24:55] pinball refinery I'm gonna give them an idea you a partner with someone like pinball refinery you

[25:01] walked them through how to do all of this work you then have people send their Magic Girls to pinball

[25:07] refinery for this update I would assume that this update will be a five to ten thousand dollar kit

[25:14] because think about it you put three years of your lives into this and all this work and you've

[25:20] only got wait for it you've only got a clientele now of like 20 people and everyone who has a

[25:27] Magic Girl is rich so they'd be stupid not to price the kit at five to ten thousand dollars so

[25:33] we'll see what happens there now speaking of beautiful beautiful games I need to give a

[25:38] Canatus pinball podcast shout out to a man who's working on a project that when I looked through this

[25:43] thread and I saw what he was creating it blew me away and I've been thinking a lot about where

[25:48] pinball prices are going and how we're spending twelve thirteen fifteen thousand dollars thirteen

[25:54] thousand dollars on a Ghostbusters premium with cabinets that'll crack there's a thread on

[25:59] pinside that's capturing the work of George Bart Kowski now if you don't know who George

[26:04] Bart Kowski is you should go to the thread that is titled Indiana Jones goes to custom

[26:10] Disneyland special facsimile edition and this special edition if you know that at Disneyland they

[26:17] had a version of Indiana Jones that was put into a much more rustic looking cabinet really cool

[26:23] with like bamboo legs and all this stuff that made it look like this thing came from made it look

[26:28] like this pinball machine was an archaeological find very cool very different than what we got from

[26:33] Valley Williams and it was really neat that Disney created this for the gift shop for Indiana Jones

[26:38] for the ride I believe go into this thread and see what this man is creating and it is the most

[26:45] beautiful work of art I've ever seen the cabinet let's talk about that for a minute why is it

[26:51] that every single pinball cabinet that comes out there now looks exactly the same at these price

[26:56] points when you want to make limited collectors editions how about we do more work like what

[27:02] George is doing I don't know if it's yours or George I'm sorry I think it might be yours how about

[27:06] we do more work like this because this is true craftsmanship and for the amount of money we are

[27:12] spending on these games I'm still not convinced we're really getting like craftsmanship we're getting

[27:18] different stickers we're getting different armor painted a different color but look how beautiful

[27:24] this Indiana Jones is and what I love about it is the way he's doing it and this was like Disney's

[27:29] idea they thought creatively about how to how to make it unique it's a work of art it's beyond a

[27:35] pinball machine now it's an absolute work of art and I think we need more stuff like this I think

[27:41] people need to realize that all of what we're getting now is sort of rinse repeat it's the same

[27:47] over and over and over again same cabinets same artists same look same feel rinse repeat but the

[27:56] prices keep going up if the prices didn't keep going up I wouldn't care so much but if you want to

[28:02] charge me almost double what these games were just five years ago and you want to give me the same

[28:07] exact looking game why can't we get more stuff like this now I know this is a I know this is a

[28:13] lot more craftsmanship I know there's a lot more that goes into this but this is what should be going

[28:18] into collectors editions this is what should be going into super at least like if Stern pinball or

[28:25] C.G.C. is going to make back to the future and you make 88 special DeLorean editions of that game

[28:34] there should be a level of craftsmanship like a flux capacitor as the coin box like things in it

[28:41] should really blow you away it shouldn't just have a standard pinball cabinet look and feel they

[28:48] should do stuff that's really creative but the problem today is if we keep buying at these inflated

[28:53] prices without more going into the product what's going to happen is you're still just going to

[28:59] get the same level of product but it's just going to keep costing more nothing's going to stop it

[29:04] nothing I say it's just going to be the reality but I do hope that more pinball companies look at

[29:09] stuff like this especially companies who are looking to break through because I also think there's

[29:14] a business model here and let me explain this how amazing would it be if a company like Chicago

[29:20] gaming company didn't just exactly remake old games but imagine if they took a game like Indiana

[29:27] Jones and created the Disneyland edition just work with me here for a minute imagine the Disneyland

[29:34] edition of Indiana Jones and you take 50 Indiana Jones machines and you do this treatment you

[29:40] make these cabinets you make everything look weathered you make everything look more like beaten up

[29:45] but it's still brand new beyond perfection like this game looks better than it did when it came

[29:51] out from Valley Williams how much could you charge if you made 50 Disneyland editions of Indiana

[29:57] Jones and this is where it gets interesting right because I think nobody thinks like this you

[30:02] could probably charge 25k a pop and they'd sell out in one day and I think what all these

[30:07] collectors are really want and I mean this I think if you're a collector like a real collector

[30:13] you just don't want something so many people have you just don't want something that a thousand

[30:20] other people have that does not feel like a rare collectible especially especially now in which

[30:27] all of this stuff is just manufactured scarcity fine then really manufacture the scarcity on some

[30:34] of them really do it Stern did it with SLE's 80 Batman and 50 Elvira nobody else has even tried it

[30:42] it's so strange to me you know Jersey Jack's gonna go the other way with toy story they're probably

[30:47] gonna bump up the number to 750 or a thousand a thousand alien LVs there just doesn't seem to be

[30:54] any desire to sort of really shrink that volume of a special edition and then super inflate the price

[31:02] I don't know why people are not trying it history has shown us that not only has that worked every

[31:07] single time it will work every single time in the future all right everybody thank you for tuning in

[31:13] if this sounds like a little bit more of a fatigued canada it's because I am I've been up all week

[31:19] with very little sleep I've been annoyed with Ryan white Ryan I do forgive you man no hard feelings

[31:25] after this show I'm just gonna move on but next time come on treat me with more respect if you're

[31:30] gonna say you're gonna do something for canada do something for canada don't say you're gonna

[31:35] do it then disappear I really look forward to getting David fix on the show Monday night every time

[31:40] someone comes on the show David they come out looking great the companies come out looking better

[31:45] there's never been a single example of me like grilling someone you know and going after them

[31:51] on an interview never happened it's not what I'm here to do I want to hear what the vision is for

[31:55] AP and I want to talk about you know how do you launch games that are a mixture of a license games

[32:01] and unlicensed games in the current climate of pinball I think it's gonna be a really great chat

[32:06] all right everybody I'm getting ready for my Saturday morning spectacular by the time I air this

[32:11] it'll be live I'll see you guys soon and thank you again so much for all of you who contribute

[32:17] and support this show it's been a lot of fun this past year I'm gonna be at pinball expo I'm
