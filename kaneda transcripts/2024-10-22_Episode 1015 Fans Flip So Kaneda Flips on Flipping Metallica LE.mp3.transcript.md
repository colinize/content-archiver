[00:00] I just wanna live, don't really care about the things I've been saying, don't really care about what I've been something.

[00:11] I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit, I'll sit up.

[00:16] Gip Rapp is one of those pinball days where you just should've not done anything pinball-related.

[00:22] Well that was like my day today.

[00:25] I made a move and I instantly recognized the mistake in doing it and what it triggered.

[00:32] We're going to talk about that.

[00:34] I also was listening to a podcast in the morning.

[00:37] Jeff Teolis was trying to explain to all his listeners how Marty Robbins is somehow a victim

[00:45] in the Haggis pinball scandal.

[00:47] He didn't really know what was going on.

[00:49] I don't buy any of it.

[00:50] I just for the record want to say right now Marty Robbins was Damien's partner.

[00:56] He knew all too well what was going on over there in all of those months where Haggis

[01:01] was struggling and Marty knew that the finances weren't good.

[01:06] He was still encouraging people to give money.

[01:11] He was going on that podcast and he was smug and he was laughing and he was refusing to

[01:17] be accountable and responsible for what was going on with the company that he was a part

[01:23] of.

[01:24] I don't buy this revisionist history thing that Jeff is trying to do and that's what

[01:30] started my day.

[01:32] I did a whole rant about that because Jeff was saying that anyone who thinks that Marty

[01:36] was somehow involved with Haggis' like Quagmire was an intelligent and an eff head and I just

[01:44] don't buy that.

[01:45] I think all of them are responsible.

[01:47] Yes, I still think Steve Bowden is responsible on some level for what was going on at deep

[01:54] root.

[01:55] Remember people, these aren't large companies.

[01:58] When you're going into a tiny pinball company and your company is promising everybody the

[02:04] world and your company is taking deposits, you have a responsibility when you're out

[02:11] there like shilling the product that you feel confident the games are going to get made.

[02:17] From there, I decided to try to test the market.

[02:21] I told you on my last show, I was going to try to test to see what the second hand market

[02:28] would be on a Metallica LE remaster.

[02:33] I announced that I had one for sale to see what people would offer.

[02:38] Man, oh, man, oh, man.

[02:40] That was like opening Pandora's box.

[02:42] It was like kicking the Hornets' nest and I quickly realized that me, Kaneda, trying

[02:49] to sell this game for a profit was going to just make everybody upset.

[02:55] The more I thought about it and I thought about it pretty instantly, I kind of understand

[03:00] exactly why everyone is upset.

[03:03] I think it comes down to this.

[03:05] It's not that you don't want me to be able to do what I should be able to do with a product

[03:12] that I bought.

[03:13] Just for the record, everybody, I did not get special treatment to get a Metallica LE.

[03:20] I bought it fair and square off of a distributor site who listed one for sale.

[03:26] Melissa, who's usually my go-to, did not get me one.

[03:32] Do not call her up and complain that she gave one to Kaneda and is not giving one to you.

[03:39] She told me today people have been saying that to her.

[03:43] People have been calling to my other distro friends complaining to them that Kaneda is

[03:49] selling a Metallica LE for $15,000.

[03:54] I love it.

[03:55] You know what I love about all this?

[03:56] Where were all of you when I lost $1,000 on Ultraman?

[04:00] I lost more than that on Toy Story 4.

[04:03] I lost $3,000 on Magic Girl.

[04:07] I get it now.

[04:08] I get it now.

[04:09] I'm not allowed to buy a game and do what I want with it.

[04:14] I have to be held to a different standard than everybody else.

[04:19] I understand why.

[04:21] If I'm going to do a pinball podcast, that's going to expose what I think are mistakes by

[04:27] these pinball companies.

[04:29] If I'm going to call these companies out for lying to consumers, if I'm going to hold them

[04:34] accountable for staying true to their word, I now understand 100% why Metallica LE Remastered

[04:43] is not a game Kaneda that anyone wants to see you flip for a profit because it is stern

[04:51] remaking in LE after they said they would not make more LEs of a game where there was

[04:58] already an LE.

[05:00] So even before I listed one for sale, that alone has got a lot of people upset.

[05:08] It's easily got 500 original Metallica LE owners upset.

[05:13] It's also got all these people upset that just wanted one and could not get one.

[05:20] The part I really misread was how angry people are that they got locked out of getting this

[05:27] game because for the last like three years, ever since Stern has been making 1000 LE

[05:34] machines, it's been easy to get every single one.

[05:40] It doesn't matter what it was.

[05:42] If it was Foo Fighters, if it was Godzilla, if it was Jaws, if it was Venom, if it was

[05:49] John Wick, I mean some of these are really easy to get because nobody wants them, but

[05:53] it still was not impossible.

[05:56] On day one to get Godzilla or Jaws, like those games were still available within 48 hours

[06:04] of being released.

[06:06] Metallica only 500, it's not the same scenario.

[06:12] This game was gone instantly and they ushered it out at Expo and in person it blew everybody

[06:20] away.

[06:21] The demand for this game is way greater, much greater than just 500 units and even though

[06:29] I think that's a good thing, even though I think Stern needs to get FOMO back into pinball,

[06:35] it just was not going to work out for me to try to sell one for more than 13,000.

[06:42] I just want to say this for the record, for those of you out there who think this game

[06:47] is not going to sell for more than 13, I'm going to tell you right now, I've had legitimate

[06:54] offers for $16,000 and up on this game and so yeah, Canade is not allowed to flip it,

[07:02] he's not allowed to make any money, but I'm going to do the right thing.

[07:07] I am going to give somebody an opportunity to take this Metallica LE off my hands.

[07:15] I am going to give someone who is a Canada club member a chance to buy Metallica LE for

[07:22] $13,000 and here's how it's going to work.

[07:27] Everybody who wants one has to message me through Patreon, no other way.

[07:33] I don't want to hear Facebook, I don't want to hear text messages, it has to be through

[07:38] Patreon because I need to validate that you're a paying club member and I want you to tell

[07:46] me how big of a Metallica fan you are and I know if you're using chat GPT.

[07:53] If you give me an AI generated answer, I am not putting your name in a hat.

[08:00] I know exactly what to look for with a fake answer and from there, I need to know your

[08:07] name and your phone number because here's how it's going to go down.

[08:13] During my Saturday morning spectacular, the greatest pinball show on the planet at 11

[08:19] a.m. Eastern Standard Time, I am going to pull a name out of a hat and whatever name

[08:28] that is, if there is a phone number attached to it, I'm going to call it.

[08:33] If you didn't give me a phone number, you're not going to win and when I call that number

[08:39] and we're going to do it live so everybody here, as you've seen this before, if that

[08:43] person answers the phone and says they want the game, it's theirs.

[08:49] If they don't pick up the phone, we're going to the next number in the hat.

[08:53] I'm not calling back, I'm not accepting callbacks even so I don't care if your little kid's

[08:59] got a soccer championship at that time.

[09:02] If you want this game, you better pick up the phone and it's going to be fair and square

[09:07] and from there, I will connect you with how you get your game, who you're going to pay

[09:13] for that game and you're going to pay no more than $13,000.

[09:20] I'm just telling you right now, for all you people that threatened me today that you're

[09:23] going to leave my show and unsubscribe, I'm telling you right now, I just left three

[09:29] to $5,000 on the table after I've lost money when I speculated on other games because nobody

[09:37] wants to see Canada turn into a scalper and look, I understand it.

[09:42] I absolutely understand it.

[09:44] I'm not like everybody else and if I don't hold myself to a higher standard, then you

[09:51] shouldn't listen to me.

[09:53] If I don't hold myself accountable for my own actions, then it is hypocritical if I'm

[09:58] going to accuse these companies of doing things that I think are disingenuous, how can I hold

[10:03] them accountable if I don't hold myself accountable every once in a while?

[10:08] Here's the thing, the other thing I'm going to do moving forward because if I'm hyping

[10:12] a game and I say, you should get this game because it's going to go up in value, if I

[10:17] tell you that for weeks like I did with Metallica, I'm allowed to go get one and see where the

[10:24] value goes.

[10:25] I'm sorry, I'm not going to do this every time.

[10:28] I'm not going to allow people to shut my opportunity down and then you get to go and exercise those

[10:34] opportunities because every single person who has a Metallica LE, you should pat yourself

[10:41] on the back because you now have a $15,000 to $18,000 game depending on who you line

[10:48] up to buy it on the secondhand market.

[10:50] That is what it's worth.

[10:52] I don't believe the babies on pin side that think this thing is going to drop in value.

[10:56] There's a reason why over 12 years, Metallica LE, the original version, never really popped

[11:03] up for sale that often and this is going to be even harder to get.

[11:07] I always want to be honest with all of you, very transparent.

[11:11] I hyped Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[11:14] I did, but have I ever told you to grab an Alice because it's going to go up in value

[11:20] or skyrocket in value?

[11:21] No, I haven't.

[11:23] Do I need to do something like this with Alice?

[11:26] No, I don't because I still think it's going to be easy to get an Alice.

[11:31] I think they're still going to sell through, but I don't think there's a frenzy to get

[11:35] those 500 Alice's the way there is Metallica.

[11:39] We know it's not as good of a game as Metallica.

[11:42] It's not even going to be as close to a good of a game as Metallica is and Metallica sold

[11:46] like 120 million albums or more around the world and is one of the most iconic bands

[11:52] of all time and it's a cool game to have in your game room if you're a grown adult.

[11:59] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland doesn't hit like that.

[12:02] Now that being said, I've been honest about Alice.

[12:05] I think they're going to end up selling everyone.

[12:07] I don't think they're really going to go up in value, but I think they're going to hold

[12:11] value and I just want to say it's been an exhausting day and I've been back.

[12:16] Back and forth with some of my own club members.

[12:19] Jaeger, I still love you.

[12:21] I love all you guys on the Patreon chat.

[12:23] It's like 40 of us.

[12:25] We're like a motley crew there that just can't get enough, but I get tired.

[12:28] I'll tell you why I get tired.

[12:29] I'm going to be honest right now.

[12:31] I get tired because I do so much work.

[12:34] I do so much work to make this content, to make this show, to take time away from my

[12:40] family, my friends, other things I want to be doing at times, to make a thousand podcasts

[12:46] and do all this work.

[12:48] And then you guys are going to bust my chops because I'm trying to make a few grand here

[12:53] and there on the side in a hobby in which are you sitting down?

[12:58] If a distributor just sells two stern alleys, just two, they make as much money as I make

[13:05] doing all the work I need to do for an entire month.

[13:09] And are you on top of them?

[13:11] Why should they get to make that much money?

[13:13] Why should they get to profit on selling these games when they're just drop shipping them

[13:18] to customers and those games are never going to have issues because they're alleys.

[13:22] People don't even play them.

[13:24] So yeah, I'm held to a little bit of a double standard.

[13:27] I get it and I feel like I did the right thing.

[13:29] And every once in a while gang, I'm actually going to be thankful that I have the community

[13:35] around me that I do because I think in life it's important to have people that surround

[13:41] you that don't always agree with you.

[13:44] But for those three people that left my show today who were instantly disgusted, don't

[13:51] come back.

[13:52] They're not even listening right now because they left.

[13:54] If all the work I've done and all the stuff I've created for you is going to make you

[13:59] run for the hills because I try to scalp one game for a few bucks.

[14:03] I don't know what to tell you.

[14:05] I think that's an overreaction to what I was doing.

[14:08] And I think you under appreciate the amount of work that goes into it.

[14:12] I could count on one hand, the amount of pinball podcasters that do the amount of work that

[14:18] I do and do it successfully, make it entertaining, do it weekly.

[14:23] It's crazy to me.

[14:24] I only ask for $5 a month.

[14:26] And even when I just ask people like, Hey, are you getting more than that?

[14:29] I get accused of being greedy for just wanting $10 a month.

[14:35] I just went to get a drink, one drink, $18.

[14:40] That's how it is.

[14:41] People before tip.

[14:42] And that's three months of Canadian pinball podcast.

[14:46] Let's just all wake up together and help each other out through this pinball year.

[14:50] It's going to be a really long year.

[14:53] And I think people are really triggered by Metallica.

[14:57] I'm glad I'm going to get it to one of you fans.

[15:00] And I really hope that whoever gets this game, you keep it, you enjoy it, you play it.

[15:07] Because if you flip it and you make $4,000 or $5,000, I swear I'm going to lose faith

[15:13] in this community because that's ridiculous.

[15:15] It really is ridiculous.

[15:17] So hopefully we get this to a fan and it all works out.

[15:21] Man, it's only Tuesday.

[15:23] It's only Tuesday.

[15:24] It feels like a month ago.

[15:26] I was at Pinball Expo and here we are.

[15:29] My advice to each and every one of you is this.

[15:31] Just listen to me.

[15:33] When I tell you to grab a game because it's hot and it's going to be unobtainium,

[15:37] don't wait and see on everything.

[15:39] And I think that's the thing, man, is everyone who listened to me and is like,

[15:43] you tell us to wait and then you go and buy one and now you want to flip it for a profit.

[15:47] Yeah, gang.

[15:48] Don't wait and see on Keith Owens, King Kong.

[15:52] Don't wait and see on Harry Potter's CE.

[15:55] Don't wait and see on freaking back to the future SLE.

[15:59] If you wait and see on those things, you're going to get locked out.

[16:03] And the only way you're going to get one is if you pay more.

[16:06] And we live in a world in which not everybody can have everything.

[16:08] Life is not fair.

[16:10] All right.

[16:11] I really do like 500 LEs.

[16:13] I'd rather it be like this than a thousand LEs that all go down in value and nothing special.

[16:19] Everybody, I hope you can hear I'm tired.

[16:22] I love you guys.

[16:23] Thank you for the support.

[16:25] And get ready.

[16:26] Let's see who gets this Metallica, but it's not going to be Canada.

[16:30] I'm not allowed to engage in normal capitalistic behavior.

[16:34] I need to hold myself to a higher standard.

[16:37] Everybody, I'll talk to you later.
