[00:00] Ah, well, today's the day!

[01:56] Game is all gonna come down to code, like everybody knows that, like the game looks

[02:00] like it's got a nice fan layout, it looks like it has a fun upper playfield with the

[02:05] Magna Hand toy guy up there, not even sure who that is in the Scooby-Doo universe, but

[02:10] this game looks like it's gonna be at least an enjoyable game to flip because the shots

[02:15] are not gonna be a brick fest.

[02:17] Look and coming off of Halloween in Ultraman, we all said that like spooky pinball needed

[02:23] to come out with something that reversed the criminal designs that happened on those

[02:28] two games and I think this is the right way to go, you go with a fan layout, you go with

[02:33] what people enjoy shooting.

[02:35] And I've talked to people who have played this game, I won't name names because they

[02:39] get really nervous and some of these people are getting a paycheck from spooky pinball,

[02:43] I've talked to people who've played this game and they said it's a big improvement over

[02:49] Halloween in Ultraman.

[02:51] Now look I was talking to someone who said look Halloween prices are going up, look I

[02:54] think you're gonna see a lot of Halloween's and Ultraman's go up for sale once this machine

[03:01] starts shipping to customers.

[03:03] I also think if you bought a TNA for over $9,000, think about how silly those TNA 2.0 buyers

[03:12] feel right now.

[03:13] It was a smart move by spooky to like hook 250 people for over 9 grand for a game that

[03:20] has basically nothing in it and now this game is just a tad more money and look at

[03:26] all of the stuff that's in Scooby Doo next to TNA, not to mention it's actually a licensed

[03:33] theme property.

[03:34] Anyway, so here's the deal about today though, the big speculation will Scooby Doo sell out

[03:39] today in one hour, someone just called me and said it's gonna sell out in one hour,

[03:44] Here's the truth, I don't think this game is going to sell out today.

[03:49] I think this game is going to sell through today and what I mean by that is this, they

[03:55] are not gonna find 1969 people to give non-refundable deposits today.

[04:03] They're definitely gonna sell some and they're definitely gonna sell some directly to customers

[04:07] and distributors are definitely gonna find people who take their money now because these

[04:11] people want to get the game earlier on.

[04:13] But here's the thing, there's 1969 of these, so what is going to happen today is this,

[04:20] they will absolutely sell hundreds of these games, maybe even a thousand and let's just

[04:26] say that if spooky sells a thousand one day of Scooby Doo's, there's still 969 more of

[04:33] them available.

[04:35] So I think what's going to happen today is I think they are gonna say they sold out but

[04:39] in reality what it's gonna be is this, they are going to allocate all of these games to

[04:45] all of the different distributors around the world who carry spooky pinball machines.

[04:51] I mean we've got Zach Manny is now a distributor for spooky pinball and you know if you're

[04:55] gonna buy yours please buy yours from Joe Newhart at Pinball Star, he's an incredible guy and

[05:00] he'll take care of you but of course like Zach will take care of you if you buy from

[05:03] flipping out and there's also a list of other distributors where you can get spooky games

[05:08] and so they are absolutely going to allocate all of these games because here's the thing,

[05:13] they're making these games for the next two years and if you're a distributor you know

[05:19] that this title is a hot title right now, you know Scooby Doo is a theme that people

[05:24] love, it's nostalgic, it's been around for shoot 50 years and so you don't have to worry

[05:30] about finding people who love Scooby Doo, right and so you're gonna want to have inventory

[05:35] of Scooby Doo over the next couple of years and also let's just tackle the elephant in

[05:40] the room, this game, this collectors edition that comes loaded with a lot of fun stuff

[05:47] is 50% cheaper than Jersey Jack Pinball's collectors edition of Toy Story and I would

[05:54] argue if you're a Scooby Doo fan and you're looking down at this game you're very happy,

[06:00] it's gonna put a smile on your face, if you're a Toy Story fanatic like I am you look down

[06:07] at Toy Story and you're not happy, you're confused, you're like what is going on here,

[06:11] this is not Andy's room, this is not the property I love, it's got a bunch of cake toppers and

[06:17] an LCD screen and I think for that reason they're looking at this spooky game like thank you

[06:23] spooky pinball, you didn't really raise your prices and you put much more into the game

[06:29] and then we've got Stern on the same level with James Bond, they've increased their prices,

[06:34] James Bond is more than 30% more money than Scooby Doo, now look it's James Bond, it's

[06:39] George Gomez, it's got a bunch of assets and let's not fool ourselves, okay let's not fool

[06:44] ourselves like I don't think spooky pinball is making a better machine than JJP or Stern

[06:49] right now but the price is right, the theme is right, the passion is there and I mean

[06:55] it when I say it like this company at least they're in it with us right, when Stern launches

[07:00] a game they just act like they're always better than us, they don't really hang out with the

[07:04] community, they don't do much for people, they don't talk to us, they're not in the

[07:08] threads with us, they're not really answering everybody's questions, they're basically just

[07:12] saying like here it is, we know you're gonna buy it because we're Stern and everything

[07:16] we do is great and then Jersey Jack when they launch Toy Story they're like we're gonna

[07:20] tell you the best way to secure a chance at getting one of our collector's editions as

[07:24] if they knew it was a magical game and then they hoodwinked everybody and the game wasn't

[07:29] magical and the game was fun but it was overpriced and I think the way spooky's going about it

[07:35] is the right way to go about it, you know the feel good vibes that this like family run

[07:39] company has been creating within the pinball community but this game feels like the right

[07:45] game at the right time with the right amount in it at the right price, now there's still

[07:51] so much about this game we don't know and that's the other reason why I don't think it sells

[07:55] out today is I think a lot of people out there are simply saying it looks really cool, great

[08:02] effort spooky, I don't know enough to say I have to own it right now, I don't like nonrefundable

[08:08] deposits so I'm just gonna wait and see and I think wait and see is the most common sensical

[08:14] thing anyone can do right now, for us to wait and see if the games are any good you're gonna

[08:18] need some initial buyers, you're gonna need some early adopters and there absolutely are going

[08:24] to be those people, look and the good news is like spooky pinball is gonna start making these games

[08:28] like immediately so we're gonna see Scooby-Doo's on location probably end of this month early

[08:34] January and then we're absolutely gonna be able to play this game come TPF, you're absolutely

[08:41] gonna be able to play this game at your local operator sometime in the near future and when

[08:46] that day happens I still think you're easily gonna be able to call up a distributor and find a

[08:53] Scooby-Doo for MSRP and I think it's gonna be a win-win-win for everybody, it's gonna be a win

[08:59] for spooky, they will sell every single one of these games, it's gonna be a win for distributors

[09:05] because they're gonna have inventory that they know people are going to want and it's gonna be a

[09:10] win for the pinball community because you're not gonna have to buy immediately and lock in your

[09:15] non-refundable deposit, you're gonna be able to play the game, make sure it's good, make sure you

[09:20] like what they did with the code, make sure you enjoy the way the game shoots and if you want one

[09:24] you're gonna be able to get one and there's not gonna be FOMO with 1969 of which 1968 are gonna

[09:32] be ordered as collectors editions, I mean have you seen the list of what's in a collectors

[09:38] edition, why would you buy something that's not the collectors edition, I mean they have loaded

[09:44] this thing up and it's not that much more money, now I think people will also probably add the

[09:49] butter cabinet which makes it even more expensive but it's totally worth it, I mean I love the

[09:54] butter cabinet, now look here's the other interesting thing, this thing is gonna come out right when

[10:00] eligibility happens for best game of the year this week in pinball, now this is gonna be interesting

[10:07] because Twippy voting opens up in January, this game will be eligible, now look Rush Pinball is

[10:15] probably and arguably the game that deserves to win game of the year because it's been out the

[10:20] whole year, people have played it, people enjoy it, it's got a lot in it, now look though Rush is

[10:26] not the most popular theme, you know and music pins in general are very divisive, now look I'm not

[10:32] saying Scooby-Doo is like the mainstream hit everyone's been waiting for but here is why I

[10:37] think Scooby-Doo could win as game of the year because I think the pinball community wants to

[10:45] send a message to Stern and JJP that they are not happy that those two companies have become

[10:53] very greedy, I think the community in general is over it, I think they were unsatisfied with Toy

[11:00] Story and I think we were heavily unsatisfied with the fumbled launch that is now James Bond and I

[11:08] think it's only gonna get worse when they reveal this Keith Elwynn pin which is gonna have much

[11:14] less in it than Scooby-Doo, this is a bad time for Stern because they're gonna come out with this

[11:20] Elwynn pin only 500 units like they're really gonna play the FOMO card to the 10th degree and then

[11:27] they're gonna ask so much more money than Scooby-Doo and Scooby-Doo is gonna be more fun, have more

[11:34] in it and be like a third of the price and I think it's gonna backfire and I think Stern has

[11:40] totally misread the room and they're killing their own golden goose, I think Jersey Jack has killed

[11:46] themselves as well with their new pricing model and it's not gonna work, it's just not gonna work

[11:52] and this is why competition is so important in any industry because now we have options and now we

[11:58] can decide who to support based upon whether or not we think we're getting the value. I've also

[12:04] said it, the big loser this year, the biggest loser in all of Pinball because they're not making any

[12:10] money, they're not doing really any sales is what the heck is American Pinball doing? What did they

[12:16] actually accomplish this year? They didn't even make all of the legends of Vahala, like I don't

[12:22] know what's going on over there, they're clearly having like supply issues but they've gone radio

[12:27] silent and now they waited too long and Spooky Pinball has shuffled in with Scooby-Doo and is

[12:34] gonna lock in so many sales and I'm telling you right now I think most Pinball people now are

[12:40] going to buy one to two games a year and that's it and there's only so many thousands of buyers

[12:47] out there that will commit and again like with all these companies releasing new and box product

[12:53] and there are so many games for sale on the used market that you already know are great Pinball

[13:00] machines, you see why every single new and box game now moving forward needs to be great, it needs

[13:09] to be perceived by the community as being incredible value and something that you really feel excited

[13:16] about unboxing otherwise you're just gonna skip it, you're just gonna let it go and there's no room

[13:22] anymore in this modern Pinball world for games like Legends of Vahala unless your goal is to put

[13:29] those kinds of machines on location and the most annoying phrase of 2022, it kills on location,

[13:36] it kills on location, I get it, Toy Story 4 kills on location, I get it, it doesn't change my mind

[13:42] on the machine and 90% of us are not operators as a home use game, I don't understand why you would

[13:49] spend that much money on it but the good news is this, if you want a Toy Story, Toy Story 4s are

[13:54] about to sell for less money than Scooby-Doo okay and that says something about the Pinball marketplace

[14:00] that it will ultimately decide whether or not you hold your value or you lose your value,

[14:05] everybody look it's Friday, it's gonna be fun to see like how this game sells today, it's gonna be

[14:11] fun to see people you know congratulate themselves for getting one, I do think they're gonna say

[14:15] they sold out and that they allocated them to all the distributors because then the distributors

[14:21] are gonna be like well it's sold out but we have a few for sale, I think you're gonna see a lot of

[14:25] that and I'm just happy for my distro friends that they're getting a game that people are excited

[14:31] about where the price is right but again don't get burned by the non-refundable, we still don't

[14:37] know a lot about this game, what we do know is exciting but what we don't know could be a deal

[14:43] breaker so me personally my advice to you is I would just wait and see, I think it's the fair

[14:49] thing to do and I think if you want one and this game makes you happy you're gonna be able to get

[14:53] one and that's what pinball needs to transform into, I still think there's always gonna be room

[14:59] for high-end collectible games that are always sought after, there's always gonna be a market

[15:04] for Elvira 40th, Batman SLEs, you know royal editions of medieval madness and that's okay,

[15:11] like you want to have some of those grail games, the problem with Jersey Jack and Stern,

[15:16] they tried to price everything now like it's a grail pin, they increased the volume so much and

[15:22] the price so much that nothing they make now feels special and this elwin pin, mark my words,

[15:28] we're one week away from the elwin pin, it is gonna go down like a lead balloon, once people

[15:34] realize that it is a greedy move, they waited too long to show it, Scooby-Doo has become our new

[15:40] point of reference on how we're looking at value and who's giving us what for how much money and

[15:46] if they try to price gouge this elwin pin, it's gonna be a bloodbath how people respond to it,
