[00:00] I never wanna use it, I wanted that way in my mind.

[00:10] You're fine, you're one.

[00:15] Detention.

[00:17] Say, say, say, say.

[00:19] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:21] Ah, canada, what are you saying that you want to see pinball machines done by the time

[00:27] they get to customers?

[00:28] I want it that way.

[00:29] Is it really that hard, everybody?

[00:31] Welcome to episode 626.

[00:33] I just took a COVID rapid test, a negative after expo.

[00:38] All is good.

[00:39] I had a cup of coffee, Kylian and Brenda are amazing.

[00:42] We got some new Patreon supporters.

[00:44] Thank you so much.

[00:45] All is good in the world.

[00:47] But I wanna tell you on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast, I wanna tell you that

[00:51] I think that every single pinball machine that is released to customers should be done.

[00:59] That is the way that I wanted.

[01:01] It is crazy to me that people continue to make excuses.

[01:06] I wanna tell you something right now.

[01:08] The one reason why, the only reason why these pinball companies get away with releasing

[01:14] products that are not finished.

[01:17] Think about it.

[01:18] Do you buy any other product in this world before it is finished?

[01:23] Do you move into your house before it's done?

[01:26] Well maybe some of you do.

[01:27] Do you go see a movie before the special effects are put in?

[01:31] Would you accept a meal at a restaurant if it wasn't cooked?

[01:35] And so why is it?

[01:36] Why is it for all this money?

[01:39] For all this money?

[01:40] Why as a community do we continue to defend this behavior?

[01:46] And I see the fanboys.

[01:47] I see the fanboys who are saying, Canadian's a hypocrite.

[01:51] He bought Batman 66 before the code was done.

[01:54] And let me tell you, I bought my Batman 66 about a year and a half after the game was

[02:00] out.

[02:01] So there was some code in it.

[02:03] But even though I bought Batman, doesn't mean I endorse that behavior.

[02:08] Yes, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that Lyman Sheets gets two years after a game

[02:13] is out to complete it.

[02:15] And the only reason it exists in this hobby of ours.

[02:18] And you know the reason.

[02:20] It's because we allow it to exist.

[02:23] If everyone in the pinball community would stop buying incomplete games, would stop buying

[02:29] games before they saw the games, would stop buying games before they played the games.

[02:35] Then it would force the manufacturers to guess what?

[02:38] To complete the games, to finish the games, to put everything that they have into the game.

[02:44] Because I don't want to be where we are right now with some of these titles.

[02:49] And I'm going to name names.

[02:51] It is not fair to buy a $9,000 game called Halloween.

[02:57] And you have no idea what assets they have.

[03:00] You have no idea.

[03:02] And I keep hearing, oh, they're going to have 30 clips.

[03:04] 30 clips?

[03:05] That could be two to three seconds long.

[03:08] Do you know how many clips are in Godzilla?

[03:10] Do you know how many clips are in Batman 66 way more than 30?

[03:15] Do the math people?

[03:17] 30 clips times three seconds.

[03:20] 30 seconds of clips for two movies.

[03:23] And everyone is like, oh, Canada needs to shut up.

[03:26] Canada's turned on spooky.

[03:28] Canada's doing this.

[03:29] Canada's doing that.

[03:30] Canada's not doing anything.

[03:31] I'm just calling it like I see it.

[03:33] And I'm not turning on spooky.

[03:35] I still have got my Ultraman order in.

[03:38] I'm still in on Ultraman number 500.

[03:40] Because I think there's going to be way more.

[03:42] And I mean this way more inside of Ultraman than there is in Halloween.

[03:47] And I know for a fact that they are struggling to get the assets they want in Halloween.

[03:53] And they'll tell you that.

[03:54] Ask them.

[03:55] Just ask them straight up.

[03:56] Do you have access to all the movie clips you want?

[03:59] And you're going to hear.

[04:00] They don't.

[04:01] And you're going to hear like, well, we don't want the movie to keep looping in the game.

[04:03] Sure you don't.

[04:04] Sure you don't.

[04:05] You don't want to keep showing people the scenes they love and the thing they love.

[04:08] Absolutely.

[04:09] Sure you don't.

[04:10] What happens in Big Lebowski?

[04:11] We see looping clips that are amazing.

[04:13] What happens in Batman 66?

[04:15] We see looping clips that are amazing.

[04:17] What happens in Godzilla?

[04:18] We see looping clips that are amazing.

[04:21] But here's Canada.

[04:22] Oh my god.

[04:23] He's doing such a negative thing again.

[04:24] No, I'm not.

[04:25] I want you guys to get everything that should be in these games.

[04:28] And so do they.

[04:29] Here's the craziest part.

[04:31] Nobody loves this theme more than spooky.

[04:34] That's why they're making it.

[04:36] And they want as much in this game as you do.

[04:39] So yes, let's wait and see what they can get into the game.

[04:44] But my main point is this, we shouldn't have to wait and see an entire year after you've

[04:52] bought a game.

[04:53] You shouldn't have to wait and see 18 months if you're going to get everything you want

[04:58] into the game for $9,000.

[05:01] Would you buy a Rolex watch for $9,000 if Rolex said to you a year from now?

[05:09] It's going to tell time properly.

[05:11] But in pinball, there are all of these never ending excuses.

[05:16] And I don't like it when spooky does it.

[05:18] I don't like it when stern does it.

[05:21] I don't like it when Jersey Jack does it.

[05:23] I mean, talk to Jack fans.

[05:25] They're still waiting on Pirates of the Caribbean final wizard mode.

[05:28] Keith, just give it to the people who own this game.

[05:32] It's done.

[05:33] There are people beta testing that Pirates of the Caribbean code forever.

[05:38] So then it's like, what are you waiting for?

[05:39] Are you waiting for the remake of the game?

[05:41] If you're going to do it again, or you just doing this on purpose, but that's not like

[05:45] an incomplete game by any means.

[05:48] Like there's already too much empire to the Caribbean.

[05:51] One missing wizard mode does not make a game incomplete.

[05:55] So I just want to go on the record right now that Canada doesn't like any game coming out

[06:00] incomplete.

[06:01] And Canada might have to be a hypocrite and buy an incomplete game because I have no

[06:06] choice.

[06:07] But the reason I have no choice is that you, me, and everyone in this community completely

[06:12] accepts this from all the manufacturers.

[06:15] But stern is God in way better than this.

[06:17] Like if you bought a Godzilla now, there might be some missing battles with monsters, but for

[06:22] the most part, there is so much game in there and they're going to make it better.

[06:26] And my main point is this, if a game is great and it's 80% complete, people will be okay

[06:32] with that.

[06:33] But that's not what's happening over with Halloween.

[06:36] It's not like the game is great and there's just more greatness to come.

[06:41] Absolutely not.

[06:42] People are like it needs more to become what we want it to be.

[06:46] And I get the apologists are going to hate me and I shouldn't even be doing this.

[06:50] I shouldn't even be kicking the spooky hornets nest because man, those apologists come at

[06:56] me like mad men.

[06:58] Some guy said who the hell is he?

[07:00] Nobody listens to that mess.

[07:03] In five years, people are going to say who's canada?

[07:06] Someone wrote that in the Halloween thread and someone needs to tell that guy.

[07:09] I've been doing this for five years.

[07:12] Number one pinball podcast for five years.

[07:15] And in five years from now, people are going to be saying we really miss canada.

[07:19] They're not going to be saying how do I get a Halloween?

[07:22] It's not going to happen.

[07:23] It's not going to happen.

[07:24] And I think they over made some of these titles.

[07:26] We're going to talk about that and we're going to talk about how hard it was to get a

[07:30] cactus canyon remake.

[07:32] That's the big thing on Pinside now.

[07:34] These guys, people are saying do another baby's episode by all the moaning and groaning because

[07:40] people couldn't get one of the 1250 cactus canyon remake.

[07:45] Elise, I'm going to talk about that.

[07:48] But I just wanted to start this episode by saying, get off my back.

[07:52] You know these games should be complete.

[07:55] You know for this much money when you buy these unnecessary toys, they should be complete

[08:01] out of the box.

[08:02] And the way spooky pinball should be doing this is not by launching it incomplete and telling

[08:09] you they have a year to fix it.

[08:10] No, a year ago, spooky pinball should have hired more people to work on the code of this

[08:16] game.

[08:17] And if they knew they were doing two games, they should have hired even more people to make

[08:22] sure both games could have been complete when they came out.

[08:27] They knew a year before they launched these games what the contractual assets were they

[08:32] had to work with on both titles.

[08:36] They flew to Japan with Ultraman.

[08:38] They're working with the guy that owns the rights to Halloween.

[08:41] And so you could either try to shut Canada up or you could actually try to be somewhat

[08:46] intelligent and say that's what a company is supposed to do.

[08:50] If you want to double your workload, you got to double your talent and you got to double

[08:55] your resources and you got to invest in those areas.

[08:59] So you can be very much an apologist and say, can aiders a baby?

[09:03] This is how it always goes or no.

[09:06] This company can make it into the big leagues by investing in what they need to invest in

[09:11] and this is not the right way to do it.

[09:13] How would anyone argue that this is a smarter approach for a company to release an unfinished

[09:19] product and make your buyers guess whether or not the game is going to develop the way

[09:24] it should.

[09:25] They should not have to do that.

[09:27] The game wasn't at expo.

[09:29] People aren't playing this game.

[09:31] You shouldn't have to spend this much money and guess what you're going to get and I don't

[09:35] understand why anybody would argue for the opposite to release incomplete stuff and to

[09:42] make the buyers have to guess what they're getting in the game.

[09:45] As you know, a game is not incomplete is cactus canyon remake and you all know it's

[09:50] true and you spooky apologists need to just stop doing what you're doing and I am rooting

[09:55] for spooky and I do want spooky to be successful.

[09:59] But the advice I'm giving them is accurate advice.

[10:03] Are you going to argue against it?

[10:05] If you want to argue against it, how about this?

[10:07] All of you apologists and you know who you are.

[10:10] I'm Nate at Pimball at gmail.com and I would love for any of you.

[10:15] You know who you are.

[10:16] I would love for any of you.

[10:17] I will invite you on the show to counterpoint this that this makes more sense to do it this

[10:23] way.

[10:24] Hit me up at canadapimball at gmail.com and let's see how many of these Halloween fanboys

[10:30] actually hit me up and come on the show to defend the way it's being done right now.

[10:35] We'll see what happens.

[10:36] Now speaking of spooky fanboys real quick on my new club episode coming out.

[10:41] I'm going to cover off on a lot of the rumors news and speculation that I know.

[10:45] I know rumors with CGC.

[10:47] I know rumors with spooky.

[10:48] I am going to let you know the reason why Mr. David Van S is no longer at spooky Pimball

[10:56] and that is going to be something you're going to hear on my club episode.

[10:59] There's a reason why there's a reason why he's sitting back and watching this game and

[11:03] watching the animations and seeing how they can do it without him.

[11:07] You're going to hear that on my club episode.

[11:08] Alright let's go on to cactus canyon remake.

[11:11] Arguably one of the sloppiest launches of all time.

[11:14] Arguably it didn't matter.

[11:15] They sold every single game.

[11:17] I talked to Joe at Pimball Star.

[11:19] He sold out in seconds.

[11:21] A friend of the show sold his in one day for $15,000.

[11:26] So he made almost $6,000 profit and he didn't even do any work.

[11:30] And for those of you who don't contribute to Canadian Spinball Podcasts, I want to let

[11:34] you know how deflating it was for me to see that.

[11:38] That I do all of this work all year doing all of these shows and so many of you who listen

[11:44] struggle to five bucks $10 here.

[11:48] This guy made almost what I make all year in doing nothing.

[11:54] He flipped the game.

[11:56] He's going to give a distributor a different address and he's going to pocket $6,000.

[12:02] So if you're on the fence, see I could have flipped this game.

[12:05] I could have done that.

[12:06] I could have gone.

[12:07] I could have grabbed one.

[12:08] I could have flipped it.

[12:09] But I didn't want to be that jerk this time.

[12:10] But man when I saw that, I'm like, you know what?

[12:13] The guy who bought it was super rich.

[12:14] He's super happy.

[12:16] Why am I sitting on the sidelines watching these people make all this money?

[12:20] But here's the thing.

[12:21] I've been reading people complaining that they weren't able to get one.

[12:24] And it's a really interesting topic is, is it now at the point we're getting a mele or

[12:30] getting a CEO of a game is becoming so damn hard that two things are happening.

[12:36] The community is saying to these companies, either make more or charge more.

[12:42] But when you start making more and charging more, two things happen.

[12:46] If you make more, these games no longer are that special and that rare and they're not

[12:52] that collectible.

[12:54] And if you missed out, I mean this, if you missed out on one of 1,250 cactus canyons,

[13:00] if you missed out on one of 1,000 Godzilla L's, let me tell you something.

[13:06] Don't worry, these games are going to come up for sale for a very long time.

[13:12] These aren't pirates of the Caribbean rare.

[13:15] These aren't super rare titles.

[13:17] There are a lot of them out there.

[13:19] And we all know that when Lyman Sheets does his code update, we all know that CDC is going

[13:26] to offer that topper.

[13:28] They're going to offer the package for people to upgrade their machines to have everything

[13:33] in it.

[13:34] Because if the toppers got special game modes, there's no way they're not going to let

[13:37] the other owners of the game experience that.

[13:40] So a lot of what you're paying for is probably just the apron and the armor, which aren't

[13:47] that special.

[13:49] And I think everybody needs to stop chasing all of these like, FOMO releases.

[13:54] And I mean it.

[13:55] And I've stopped chasing it.

[13:56] Like when people were telling me at Expo that they got one of the L-Vira 40th anniversary

[14:02] editions, I wasn't happy for them.

[14:05] I was sad for them because they fell victim to just the exact thing these companies are

[14:11] doing, which is it's the same game.

[14:14] It's the same game.

[14:15] So the only reason you're buying it, it's not really to make you happier.

[14:21] It's so that you have something that collectors will envy.

[14:25] And the moment you give that up, I truly mean this.

[14:28] The moment you give up trying to be the envy of other collectors and just buy these games

[14:34] to enjoy, think about how stupid it is.

[14:38] In L-Vira can be had for $8,000.

[14:43] Maybe they're going to bump it up to 9 now with the new price increase.

[14:46] You can get it for $8,000.

[14:49] Is the person playing a 20 to $30,000 L-Vira having more fun than the person playing it

[14:57] for $8,000?

[14:59] And I would argue that the person who buys it for 8 is getting the same exact game, the

[15:04] same exact everything, and is also less worried about it, less worried about every dimple,

[15:11] every chip, every scratch.

[15:13] They're just enjoying the game.

[15:15] And when you have this super expensive version of it, you're much more nervous about putting

[15:19] wear and tear on it.

[15:21] You're much more nervous about everything because it's that rare collectible.

[15:25] And guess what?

[15:26] It's only, you're only going to see that value the day you sell it.

[15:30] I know they want you to just justify getting it.

[15:33] Look, I've been down this road in so many hobbies and at the end of it all, I'm telling

[15:38] you this, at the end of it all.

[15:40] Everything after these things is way more fun than acquiring them.

[15:44] The moment you acquire it and you have it, the chase is gone.

[15:47] But here's what's sad about all these, and I truly mean this.

[15:50] This isn't a chase.

[15:51] You didn't acquire this because you found some grail that was in a garage.

[15:55] This wasn't some like barn fine of a rare car from the 70s.

[16:00] This is all modern day manipulated FOMO.

[16:03] That's all it is.

[16:04] These aren't rare games.

[16:06] Tomorrow, Stern could just turn around and make a green with envy Godzilla edition.

[16:11] A hundred of them for 25,000 and you all would buy it.

[16:15] They could turn around tomorrow and just do another tron with different artwork.

[16:19] You all would buy it.

[16:20] They could turn around and do another Lord of the Rings.

[16:22] They're going to keep doing this.

[16:24] None of this, none of this has any value other than collectors in modern days who are just

[16:32] running after this stuff.

[16:34] And you could go down that road and you can have a lot of money, but I'm telling you,

[16:37] it's not going to make your life any more fulfilling.

[16:40] It's not going to make you any cooler.

[16:43] You're not going to have a better gameplay experience and you're not going to be any

[16:47] more satisfied than the guy who has it for $8,000.

[16:50] You're just not.

[16:52] But for some of you out there, I know how rich you are and you know how rich you are and

[16:57] this means nothing and these kinds of things matter to you.

[17:00] Now I've always said this.

[17:02] I hope someone out there actually has the guts to do two things to make a game for super

[17:08] rich people.

[17:09] I hope someone has the guts to do that, but I also hope someone has the guts to actually

[17:14] make a game with $25,000 of stuff in it.

[17:19] That's why these games depress me.

[17:21] That's why the Chase for L. Virer depresses me a little bit because there's not more

[17:25] in it.

[17:26] You're basically paying for three to $500 in decals and armor.

[17:31] They don't even give you a topper for $25,000.

[17:37] Just think about that for a minute.

[17:39] You don't even get the topper included.

[17:43] How can we watch this and say that's a good deal?

[17:46] Back to my other point though about getting in on these L. E's and they see E's.

[17:50] I got an email from someone yesterday saying, Chris, I've been trying to get on a list

[17:54] for people to get the new Jersey Jack toy story CE and it just seems impossible to get

[18:00] on anybody's list.

[18:02] When we look at the way Cactus Canyon sold, it was sloppy, right?

[18:05] It was really sloppy.

[18:07] Some people bought their games through PPS and it was easier to get it that way.

[18:12] Some people bought it from their distributors.

[18:14] Some people waited for Pimball Star to send out an email blast on a Sunday at New

[18:20] Eastern Standard Time and Joe said they sold in seconds.

[18:24] So for a lot of people out there, getting one was a pain in the ass.

[18:28] There was no way to get one.

[18:30] And so how do you solve this problem and is it a problem?

[18:33] The truth is this, it's not a problem.

[18:36] This is the biggest first world problem ever.

[18:39] Imagine a cover story on CNN that said, Rich Mail can't get access to $9,200 Pimball

[18:48] Machine because 1,250 other rich man got it before him.

[18:53] Who would care?

[18:54] Who actually would care that you got locked out of your expensive Pimball purchase?

[19:00] Nobody.

[19:01] It is the ultimate first world problem.

[19:03] Now here's the thing, if you're wealthy enough to spend $9,250 on an unnecessary Pimball

[19:11] Machine and face it, people, this is not your first pin.

[19:15] For how many of you out there?

[19:17] This is your first game?

[19:18] No, you've got tons of Pimball machines.

[19:20] You don't need another.

[19:22] This game comes out and so what?

[19:24] The only way to get one is to spend a couple thousand over sticker to get one.

[19:28] Guess what?

[19:29] Spend it.

[19:30] Spend it and be happy and shut up about it.

[19:32] And I mean that.

[19:33] You want to get a new Corvette?

[19:35] You want it at sticker price?

[19:36] Guess what?

[19:37] Way more people want it than there are Corvettes.

[19:40] So spend a little bit over, get it, live your life, be happy and shut up about it.

[19:45] And I mean that.

[19:46] One just needs to shut up about the fact that you might have to pay a couple thousand

[19:50] more.

[19:51] The only alternative that's going to come is if the manufacturer is just charge more.

[19:55] Do I think CGC could have charged $11.5 for this game and sold everyone?

[19:59] Absolutely.

[20:00] And that's what's going to happen next because they're going to see that these sold out

[20:04] in one second and now they're selling for 12,000 on the second hand market.

[20:08] Well, why don't we just charge $12,000?

[20:11] That's what's coming next.

[20:12] Do you think Jersey Jack Pimball, with all they put into their games?

[20:15] With Toy Story coming out from Pat Lawler, do you think Jersey Jack Pimball is going to

[20:20] idiotically price a collector's edition at 12.5 again?

[20:26] There is absolutely no way they're going to do that.

[20:29] I almost want to do the reverse psychology words like Jersey Jack.

[20:33] Do not insult me and these rich men in this community.

[20:37] Do not insult us and think that all we can spend is 12.5.

[20:42] I would be insulted if this Toy Story CE is not more than $15,000 or at least $15,000.

[20:50] And I'm going to be pissed off if you think Jersey Jack that all I can spend is $15,000

[20:57] on a collector's edition.

[20:58] I want to show you how much money is in my checking account.

[21:01] I want to show you how much money I've made on crypto this year.

[21:05] Don't insult us.

[21:06] We know Ed Robertson's got millions of dollars.

[21:09] We know Bill Brandis's got millions of dollars.

[21:11] We know the community hate to call you guys out but we know you're wealthy.

[21:14] We know you're rich.

[21:15] We see your photos on Facebook.

[21:17] Okay, you can't hide it from Canada.

[21:19] You're way richer than I am.

[21:20] And even I.

[21:21] Even I would be willing to tell Killian Killian.

[21:24] I'm sorry son.

[21:26] I can't send you to college this year because I bought a bunch of Pimball machines when

[21:30] you were young.

[21:31] And that was a better investment they said at the time.

[21:35] Oh, the pin crash is coming.

[21:36] We all know it's coming.

[21:37] It's not going to crash crash but these prices are going to come down.

[21:41] You think stranger things Ellie is going to be more than $13,000 for ever.

[21:47] Absolutely not.

[21:49] Oh, by the way, I do know what Brian Eddie's next game is.

[21:52] I know what the game is after rush and rush is 1,000% next from John Borg.

[21:59] I know what the next title is from Stern and you're going to hear about it on Canada

[22:04] club.

[22:05] But here's when you're going to have to hear it after December.

[22:07] Right?

[22:08] January 1st, I will tell you what Stern's next title is.

[22:11] But that's my point is like there is no solution.

[22:14] There is no solution and the people that have relationships with these distributors, they're

[22:19] going to get the games in front of you.

[22:22] And for all of you who are new to the hobby, I don't care if you have money.

[22:26] You're not going to be able to get better treatment than Canada.

[22:29] Guess why?

[22:30] Because I've been doing this for five years making 625 episodes about Pimball.

[22:36] I've been a part of this community all these years and so have all those other men that

[22:42] are on those lists and women too.

[22:44] There are women who are on these lists but women are not crazy about collecting these

[22:47] out of these.

[22:48] I don't really think so.

[22:49] I think most of our wives are like, what are you doing?

[22:52] Like what are you doing?

[22:54] The women we've married and maybe some of you have men and partners but our partners in

[22:59] life.

[23:00] They look at us when we collect these expensive pens and they're like, I just need to

[23:05] break it to you right now.

[23:06] Like Brenda will be like Chris, I need to break it to you.

[23:09] You're no cooler now that you have Godzilla Ellie.

[23:12] You still don't do the chores like I need you to and you don't even need this stuff.

[23:16] Like this isn't going to change you.

[23:18] And I've said this before and someone said this was sexist that I think women and our

[23:22] partners in life are smarter than we are.

[23:25] Like chasing after these collectible Pimball machines is pretty idiotic and sometimes

[23:31] we need someone outside of this community to be like, what are you doing?

[23:37] Why are you spending all this money on this stuff that A you don't need?

[23:42] B it's not going to make you any cooler and C everybody should take the money that they

[23:47] are going to use to buy cactus Canyon or Godzilla Ellie and I promise you this and I know

[23:54] you're going to lose your money but you're not going to lose your money because you're

[23:56] going to gain something way more valuable than a Pimball machine you're barely going

[24:01] to play.

[24:03] Take the money that 10 five for Godzilla.

[24:07] Fly your family to Tokyo.

[24:09] Actually spend two to three weeks where Godzilla lives and you will have more fun, more memories

[24:18] and it will matter more to you for the rest of your life than that Pimball machine ever

[24:23] will.

[24:24] And I guarantee you this.

[24:26] I guarantee you this.

[24:28] Nobody would make that trip and come back and say you know what my life would have been

[24:33] better off because I stuck another Pimball machine in my basement and my friends came over

[24:39] and instead of having eight machines we now have nine and even though I can only play

[24:43] one machine at a time this is more fulfilling to me.

[24:47] I'm telling you hire a babysitter drop the kids off maybe even with your grandparents

[24:52] and go to Tokyo and you will have way better time and how many of you have been to Tokyo.

[24:58] I'm speaking to all of you right now because I've only been once for my honeymoon for three

[25:03] weeks and it is the greatest place on planet earth that you could visit.

[25:06] The best food, the best culture, the best time and it's where Godzilla lives.

[25:12] You could stay in a hotel in Tokyo in which Godzilla is on top of the hotel looking right

[25:18] into your room.

[25:20] That would be more magical than finding the wizard mode on a stern machine in which I

[25:25] already have 15 stern machines and you don't even get to the wizard mode because none of

[25:29] you are good enough to complete Keith L.W. games.

[25:31] You know this.

[25:32] Canada, what's in your coffee this morning?

[25:34] You need to stop this.

[25:36] We don't need canada episodes like this.

[25:38] We just need you to go back saying how much fun you had at Expo and I had an amazing time

[25:43] at Expo and that's why I'm so in this mood because the best part of this hobby is free.

[25:49] And when I see people complain about not getting a cactus can and I'm like, guys just shut

[25:53] up about it.

[25:54] And here's the other little dirty little secret that nobody wants to tell you.

[25:58] Are you ready for it?

[26:00] Cactus can is not even that much fun.

[26:02] It is not.

[26:04] It's an okay game.

[26:05] It is just an okay game.

[26:07] If you feel like you missed out on cactus can and go play one.

[26:11] You are not going to walk away being like, oh my god this is the most amazing pinball experience.

[26:16] Oh, it's a middle of the road, Bally Williams game.

[26:20] It always was a middle of the road, Bally Williams game.

[26:23] Like Adam's family way better, Twilight Zone way better, Attack from Mars way better,

[26:30] Monster Bash way better, Medieval Man is way better.

[26:33] So if you missed out on this one, guess what?

[26:36] You can get way better machines for way less money and have no drama and stop pouting

[26:43] around the house.

[26:44] The kids are sick of seeing you, pouting around the house.

[26:46] I didn't get my cactus can in LA and the distributor said and then they sold out and said, nobody

[26:53] cares.

[26:54] Your kids don't care.

[26:55] Your wife don't care.

[26:56] Walk down the street.

[26:57] Do me a favor.

[26:58] If you missed out on this game, walk down the street.

[27:02] Stop everybody you see and say, I'm really deflated today because I didn't get my $9200

[27:09] pinball machine because $1,250 them sold instantly and see what those people's reaction

[27:15] is.

[27:16] And maybe all of us need to start doing this every once in a while because as I said,

[27:20] we're living in a vacuum.

[27:22] And when you step outside the vacuum, you're going to enjoy this hobby more.

[27:27] Let me repeat that.

[27:28] When you step outside the FOMO vacuum, you will enjoy this hobby more.

[27:35] You will enjoy going to shows more.

[27:38] You will enjoy the games you already own more.

[27:41] You don't need another game.

[27:44] You don't.

[27:45] And if this was the first game you were going to buy and you got locked out, I've got really

[27:50] good news for you.

[27:52] You can go buy the cactus canyon, standard edition or classic edition.

[27:56] It's the same game.

[27:58] All right.

[27:59] The toppers not going to change the game for you.

[28:02] In fact, if you think the toppers going to change the game for you so much, when you get

[28:05] your game and you put a topper on it, I'll come by with a baseball bat and I'll knock

[28:10] the goddamn topper off your machine and guess what?

[28:13] You'll still be able to enjoy the machine.

[28:16] There won't be any difference.

[28:17] What do you think of the fact that the guys' arms are falling off on the toppers so much

[28:21] for the build quality on that one?

[28:23] Whoops.

[28:24] Reach for the sky and you can't with no arms.

[28:27] Anyway, this is my point.

[28:28] This is my point.

[28:29] This is the point I've been trying to get across for all of these years, guys.

[28:33] This pinball is so much fun.

[28:35] There's so much enjoyment to be had and everyone who's buying a Godzilla premium is going

[28:39] to love that machine.

[28:41] They don't care that they don't have the back glass.

[28:43] You can't play a mirrored back glass.

[28:47] You can't play a mirrored back glass.

[28:49] You can't play inner art decals.

[28:52] The game is the same.

[28:54] It's the same exact game.

[28:56] You know, all of this stuff, all this stuff we've overvalued, it's kind of like a really

[29:02] nice headrest in a car.

[29:04] Right?

[29:05] Imagine a car that drives so well.

[29:08] But that guy's got one of 100 headrests that's made with like goose feathers inside.

[29:13] It's like, do you really care?

[29:16] Do you really care?

[29:17] Are you really going to step up and be like, oh, you've got the mirrored back glass?

[29:20] Oh my god.

[29:21] Games way different now.

[29:23] Oh, look, Jimmy, he's got the mirrored back glass.

[29:25] Games shoot different.

[29:26] No, it doesn't.

[29:28] It doesn't.

[29:29] They want you to care.

[29:30] Here's why they want you to care.

[29:32] Because all of this stuff is super cheap for these companies to put on these games.

[29:37] And then they're making thousands more.

[29:40] They are spending a few hundred more and they're getting thousands more from you.

[29:45] And that, my friends, is kind of funny.

[29:48] It really is kind of funny.

[29:50] If anybody else, if anybody else, like if you told anyone else who's not in the pinball,

[29:55] the stuff we're paying more for, well, is the game any different?

[29:58] No.

[29:59] Are there more mechs in the game?

[30:00] No.

[30:01] Are artwork different on the play field?

[30:03] No.

[30:04] Is there anything in a mode wise?

[30:05] Is there like an experience that's different?

[30:07] No.

[30:08] Is there any lighting difference in Godzilla, Ellie?

[30:10] No.

[30:11] No.

[30:12] No.

[30:13] No.

[30:14] You keep going down the list of like, nothing important is different.

[30:15] It's everything unimportant that's different.

[30:19] And welcome to Canadian pinball podcast for all of you out there.

[30:22] You don't want Canadian to be like this all the time.

[30:25] You don't want me to wake up and feeling the energy like I'm doing today.

[30:28] Do you want more shows like this?

[30:30] Do you want me to stop being like, well, you know, spooky needs to put more code?

[30:34] And yeah, I could do that.

[30:36] That's just par for the Canadian course.

[30:38] And maybe I'm waking up because it's Twippy season.

[30:40] Is it even Twippy season?

[30:42] Where are the Twippies?

[30:43] Where's Jeff Patterson announcing the Twippies?

[30:46] I want to say this.

[30:47] I spoke to him at expo and the Twippies are happening, which means voting happens in December.

[30:54] But here's the thing.

[30:55] Usually we've already had the announcement that that's going to take place.

[31:00] And he also has to do the right ends.

[31:02] Now, I'm going to ask two things to happen this year in the Twippies.

[31:06] Number one, they need to shorten the window of voting.

[31:10] The entire month of December is stupid.

[31:14] Tell me an election in the world in which voting happens for 30 days.

[31:18] I actually think voting should just happen in one day.

[31:21] I think voting should happen in one day because one day would then eliminate all the back

[31:26] and forth, all the stuffing of the ballots, all the stuff people do to try to win and

[31:31] all the campaigning for it.

[31:32] No.

[31:33] Campaign before it and let your people know that this is the election day.

[31:38] This is the day everyone votes on it to make it a month long is silly.

[31:43] Now, I understand if you want to stretch it out a little bit fine.

[31:46] It's kind of fun to tell people, don't forget to vote, right?

[31:48] Oh, they have a reminder.

[31:49] Okay.

[31:50] This would be the first time in which two weeks actually stood for something good.

[31:53] I would open it up for just two weeks.

[31:56] That's plenty of time.

[31:58] That's plenty of time to remind people.

[32:00] It's plenty of time to tell your family, your coworkers, your friends, vote in the Twippies.

[32:05] Because it's also exhausting for those people on the ballots that they take an entire month

[32:08] to remind people.

[32:09] I would just make it two weeks long.

[32:11] I hope they do that.

[32:12] The other thing is this.

[32:13] We know and you know.

[32:15] Canada, Pimball podcast, I get it.

[32:17] But there's another category.

[32:19] I definitely want to be written in as favorite Pimball streamer.

[32:24] Do I think we're going to be Jack Danger?

[32:26] I don't.

[32:27] But all of these Saturday morning spectacular, all of the Facebook lives I've been doing.

[32:32] That's a Pimball stream people.

[32:33] I'm not even playing Pimball.

[32:35] And I do think it would be absolutely insane if Canada's Pimball podcast even just finished

[32:41] second in the world's best Pimball stream.

[32:45] Imagine if we wanted though.

[32:46] Imagine if we wanted.

[32:47] Imagine if the world's number one Pimball streamer doesn't even stream playing Pimball.

[32:55] That's why I love doing this show.

[32:57] That's why I love having each and every one of you listen to this show.

[33:01] Because we just take a different perspective.

[33:03] We do take a different perspective.

[33:04] And I want to say, and I mean this, because life is too short for the drama.

[33:08] There's been a lot of positive things that came out of Expo.

[33:11] I had a lot of positive conversations with a lot of people I've been feuding with over

[33:16] the years.

[33:17] And I've buried the hatchet and I'm going to continue to bury the hatchet.

[33:21] And I do want to take the high road because I do want to have more of these people.

[33:25] Zach, Greg Bohn, people talk about Pimball with me.

[33:29] Kerry Hardy, let's talk about Pimball.

[33:31] Christopher Franci, let's talk about Pimball.

[33:33] I would love to get the stern people to talk about Pimball.

[33:36] I would love to get Eric Manier to come on the show and talk about Pimball.

[33:40] Eric, I don't know why you're mad at Canada.

[33:42] For an entire year, I said how amazing your game is.

[33:45] I've done nothing but praise Eric Minier.

[33:48] I think he's upset because I talked about the whitewood of GNR.

[33:52] And I'm here to tell you, Eric, don't be upset by that.

[33:54] You sold 6,000 games.

[33:56] I continue to this day to call your machine a next level masterpiece.

[34:04] And of course, I'm going to talk about the quality issues.

[34:07] And wasn't it funny that not one person even brought up the quality issues during the

[34:12] AJP seminar.

[34:14] And this is why you need Canada people because we shouldn't be afraid to talk about these

[34:18] things.

[34:19] We shouldn't be afraid to talk about spooky and maybe the lack of assets in Halloween

[34:24] and maybe how they need to hire more talent.

[34:26] And maybe they need to like make sure they don't release games so incomplete.

[34:30] Why should we be afraid to talk about that?

[34:32] These are $9,000 toys people.

[34:35] These aren't treatments for medical issues that the world really needs.

[34:39] This is what we need more of this.

[34:42] You don't need more of like, well, you know, the modes are really great and the fan

[34:45] layout is really interesting and the full RGB lighting.

[34:48] And when you put pin stadium lighting in, it really does light up the play.

[34:51] Who cares?

[34:52] Who cares?

[34:54] You guys are so much more interesting than these machines.

[34:57] And I mean that.

[34:58] And that's why I loved being at expo and I love the fans of the show because all of you

[35:03] and sitting down and having a beer or talking with you guys is way more fun than playing

[35:09] pinball.

[35:10] I mean this when I say it.

[35:11] When I walked up and played cactus canyon, I was so bored.

[35:15] When I was in bored is when I was talking to all you guys.

[35:19] And it's an okay game.

[35:20] Don't get me wrong.

[35:21] It's an okay game.

[35:22] It's just not going to light your world on fire.

[35:24] And some of you out there, it's like I don't know what you expect from these machines,

[35:28] but I'm telling you, the real happiness in your lives, it's the people around you, it's

[35:32] your family, it's your friends, it's the things you do for work.

[35:35] Those are the things they're going to bring you real fulfillment.

[35:37] It's not going to come from a lime and sheets coated cactus canyon.

[35:42] And if you disagree, canada pinball at gmail.com.
