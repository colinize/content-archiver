[00:00] Damn it, honey. Forget it. Hey, you were great. I couldn't be prouder. It was just bad luck.

[00:16] What if they hadn't cheated? Just leave me alone for a minute, okay? We're outside.

[00:22] You ever miss from me, Aggie? You think I had a chance at winning?

[00:28] Win, lose, no matter. No, it's not what I mean.

[00:32] I had good chance. No need to fight anymore. So you proved a point.

[00:40] But what point? That I could take a beating? I mean, every time I see those guys, they're gonna know they got the best of me.

[00:46] None of them balance that way. Not with them, not with me. Close eye.

[01:16] You're the best, oh wow. Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.

[01:22] You're the best, oh wow. Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.

[01:27] You're the best, oh wow. Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.

[01:32] You're the best, oh wow. Nothing's gonna ever keep you down.

[02:02] This will be the greatest achievement ever, and I didn't cheat. I didn't buy votes.

[02:08] I haven't done anything but make 750 plus shows every single week, day in and day out.

[02:15] This is where you go to to get your news, rumors, and speculations about the pinball hobby.

[02:21] I don't quit on you. I don't talk about what I did over the weekend.

[02:24] I don't talk about what I had for breakfast, and I know all the haters out there would love for Canadian to walk away,

[02:30] walk into the sunset, but we're not gonna do it, and we're gonna start campaigning for the 6th Twip,

[02:35] become January 1st. I'm also gonna go to Texas. I had a complete 180 change of heart.

[02:41] I woke up this morning, I went to the gym, I did some pull-ups.

[02:44] I listened to Mr. Bill Brandis call me weak. The dude called me weak, and he's from Canada.

[02:51] I can't have someone from Canada call me out and challenge my manly hood.

[02:56] So it starts now, Canada's campaign for a 6th Twipy, and I'm gonna leave you with this right now,

[03:03] some real news right now. You're going to see Spooky Pinballs Scooby-Doo

[03:09] revealed to the world this Thursday, December 8th.

[03:14] And then you're gonna see James Bond, the Keith Elwyn 60th anniversary machine, December 15th.

[03:21] So that is two back-to-back Thursdays, new pinball machines coming out,

[03:26] and yours truly is gonna be here giving you all of my opinions about these games.

[03:31] Everybody, thank you so much for the support, and I mean it right now.

[03:35] We're not just gonna win this 6th Twipy. We are going to annihilate the competition,

[03:41] and we're gonna do it fair and square, and they can check every single vote, every single IP address,

[03:47] because you're gonna vote, your wife is gonna vote, your kids are gonna vote,

[03:51] my janitor's gonna vote, my cleaning lady's gonna vote, my wife is gonna vote,

[03:55] and guess who's running my campaign? Little Killian.

[03:58] So if the campaign gets a little childish, you can blame Killian.

[04:03] Everybody, let's do this later.

[04:17] It didn't again!
