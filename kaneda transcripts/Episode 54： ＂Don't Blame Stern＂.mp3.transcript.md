[00:00] It's starting to heat up Batman.

[00:02] Well, we do smell delicious.

[00:04] The smell of death, probably I'm afraid.

[00:07] Yes, this is our last meal, Batman.

[00:10] And this is one time I would advocate starting with dessert.

[00:13] I don't know about you guys, but I've just been thinking so much over the last couple

[00:24] days about Batman, super Ellie, the new pricing that Stern is communicating, and what this

[00:31] all means.

[00:32] It's really, it's an intriguing topic because I don't know about the rest of you, but I

[00:37] go back and forth about how I feel about this, and if we're responding to this news the

[00:44] right way on, on episode 54 of Tinnitus Pimbal Podcast, I just want to give you guys my

[00:50] thoughts, continued thoughts, I shall say, because I've already sort of, I'm going to

[00:54] express my concerns and my questions about this move, but I continue to think about it,

[01:01] and I continue to come up with various conclusions, and I want to express those.

[01:06] I kind of feel like most of you guys are probably going through the same thing where you're

[01:13] hated, you don't really care about it, it's other people's money, why not?

[01:21] It was about time.

[01:22] They were watching everyone else do it, don't they deserve the money for the games they

[01:27] make, all the different things are swirling around in our heads, and so let's go down a

[01:33] list, and I don't even have a list, I should have wrote one down, but I'm going to talk

[01:36] freely, so I think first and foremost, I think what people are noticing is that Stern

[01:41] is basically building in the profit people would make when they flip their games, and they've

[01:47] seen it happen for years.

[01:49] There hasn't really been many Stern Pimball machines that have gone up in value.

[01:54] I think where most of it occurred was people would get a Stern game, they would get an

[02:00] Ellie, like a Star Trek or Metallica or an ACDC, and they would play it, and they would

[02:06] sell it home use only, everything always had less than 200 plays, I always loved that,

[02:11] that was such BS, because you could just update the code and all of a sudden you're back

[02:14] to zero.

[02:16] Everything was always home use only, everything was low plays, and people were getting close

[02:22] to what they paid new inbox, if not a little bit more for their machines, right?

[02:27] We saw Metallica's walking dead, Star Trek Ellie's really sell for, you know you're not

[02:34] losing money, right?

[02:36] And this became a hobby that a lot of people could justify going in to the new inbox purchase

[02:41] because they weren't going to lose much money if anything.

[02:45] And that was a huge part of this hobby.

[02:48] And so the one title that really jumped the most was Tron Ellie, we all know that, Tron

[02:55] sold new inbox, I think for around $6,000, I think it was maybe $6,300, and that was

[03:01] sort of a turning point for Stern because there was no premium, there was a Tron Pro and

[03:08] a Tron Ellie, and the Ellie had features that weren't on the Pro, and it had a mode that

[03:15] wasn't available, the DAF pump multi-ball, and that's, and then they had the lights

[03:19] on the ramp, and so there was different things on it, and that became the one people wanted.

[03:24] And so what happened, the prices of new inbox Tron Ellie's, because they only made 400

[03:31] began to climb and climb and climb, to the point where I think it's peak, a new inbox

[03:38] Tron Ellie sold for, I want to say $15,000.

[03:43] I know I saw some self for like 12 to 13, so look to the past to understand what's going

[03:51] on right now.

[03:53] Stern has witnessed all of this, they have witnessed all of this, and so they are sort

[04:01] of borrowing the knowledge of the past to presently price Batman 66, and they know one

[04:08] thing, and they know one thing only, that this hobby overnight shifted from being a 50-50

[04:15] split of operators and home collectors to home collectors with this pen.

[04:22] Now we have to also hit pause, and we, I read people reacting and we're going crazy.

[04:29] What if Batman 66 is simply Stern's birthday present to itself?

[04:35] It is a sort of unique title with an ancillary purpose to simply be geared towards the collector

[04:44] of Stern Pimball machines.

[04:47] If that is the case, will this be a title that is priced higher, is made in super limited

[04:55] runs, and then it's never made again?

[04:58] And if Stern really wants to say that this is our birthday present to ourselves and we're

[05:02] super limiting them, and we're going to make 30 super alleys, 240 alleys, and I wish

[05:10] they would have said we're going to make 500 premiums.

[05:12] The word on the street is that is how many premiums are going to make, but that's not

[05:16] confirmed, and we know Stern, if these things are super hot, they're going to keep pumping

[05:22] them and pumping money back into the bank.

[05:25] So that is where we're at.

[05:27] We have Stern who is making a title for the first time ever, that is geared solely towards

[05:32] the collector.

[05:33] And look, the collectors, I like collector items that are truly collector items because

[05:42] they're rare because of some authentic reason, and I'm going to air an interview I did with

[05:48] the Black Knight.

[05:50] We talked last night about the creation of Big Bang Bar, and that is a title that warrants

[05:57] its price.

[05:58] It was a miracle that that game was ever even remade from the 14 production models

[06:03] that were out there.

[06:06] And it really drove a man.

[06:09] It was like his passion and his life dreamed to get it remade, and it took everything out

[06:15] of him, and he even ended up losing money on every game just to get it out because he

[06:21] said he would.

[06:22] And so every Big Bang Bar is still special, it's still rare, it's still limited, but there's

[06:26] only one version of Big Bang Bar really, for the most part, right?

[06:31] The plaques might change, a few subtleties, but there's not all these variations.

[06:37] And I still think Stern is making a mistake by making a lot of variations.

[06:42] I actually would have preferred just Ellie and Super Ellie, just two versions, and one

[06:47] Super High End Blinged Out one for the Ultra High End collector.

[06:52] Would have been fine, I think with that.

[06:54] I would have, I think that it's the same game in all three cabinets is the thing that

[07:00] I really am like, that's not the way I would have done it.

[07:07] But here's the thing too, and I wake up and I'm like, canada, you know, you were flying

[07:11] off the handle a little bit, you were going a little nuts.

[07:14] Does any of what I say matter?

[07:16] Does it what any of what anyone says matter?

[07:19] Because if I'm Stern and I'm a marketer, and I keep hearing people throw out, like

[07:24] this is bad marketing, this is bad public relations, and I work in marketing and I work in public

[07:29] relations.

[07:30] And there are times when you do things that are disruptive, and when you do things that

[07:36] are disruptive, they oftentimes are polarizing.

[07:40] They don't always appeal to people.

[07:44] They don't always please everybody.

[07:47] We came out with Oreo, sweetest fish flavored Oreo.

[07:51] If the people are excited, have to be people hated, and it's one of our like greatest

[07:57] selling flavors because of just the curiosity around it.

[08:01] You can create the man and still, and at the same time create a polarizing effect with

[08:05] your community.

[08:07] What Stern knows is this, that anyone who's on PIN side, anyone who's on there every day

[08:13] posting and commenting, they know that you're obsessed with Pimbal.

[08:18] They know that you are going to still love Pimbal.

[08:21] They know that you are still going to want new machines.

[08:24] And who are you going to go by if not a new Stern?

[08:29] Right, there are no options.

[08:31] Stern's not silly.

[08:34] Stern is in a category that's like any other because they can go mainstream and boutique

[08:38] at the same time because they basically have a monopoly.

[08:42] They have a monopoly on Pimbal people's passion.

[08:47] They have a monopoly on Pimbal people's obsession with opening up new inbox.

[08:52] There is nobody else out there that can fulfill the obsession that PIN sideers and the hyper

[09:01] collector has other than Stern.

[09:04] And so if Stern, this is where I think Stern is sort of genius because as much as I think

[09:11] the application is annoying and it's silly and it's clearly just to collect data for

[09:16] them that they can utilize effectively in the future.

[09:19] Which is smart.

[09:20] There are some questions in there that are absolutely ridiculous.

[09:22] How many times have you seen Gary Stern walk his dog?

[09:25] I don't even know if he has a dog.

[09:26] But that question could be in there and be like, it doesn't matter.

[09:29] There are like four questions that matter in there.

[09:32] And the rest is first, Stern to be able to peek into your home and see how good your collection

[09:35] is.

[09:36] And we're all going to, everyone wants one, it will apply that way.

[09:39] But they've been watching the boutique market, right?

[09:41] And we said this.

[09:43] Stern is looking at spooky pinball machines making 300 rob zombies and selling them for $6,000

[09:49] and then people are going to sell them for $8,000 in new inbox.

[09:54] Stern is like, okay, we're making something far better than that and you can't even go get

[09:58] a rob zombie.

[09:59] The only way you can get one is if you're paying a premium.

[10:01] So think about it.

[10:02] If you want to go get a new inbox rob zombie, you're probably looking at around like eight

[10:06] grand.

[10:07] So if Stern prices Batman 66 premium and eight grand, does it seem overpriced all of

[10:14] the sudden?

[10:15] If you want to go get a new inbox, the Hobbit, you're looking at eight grand.

[10:20] If you want to get a new inbox, Alien LE, you can't even get it.

[10:24] You're looking at eight grand.

[10:25] New inbox, Dutch pinballs, Big Lebowski, you're looking at 10 grand and you can't even get

[10:31] that.

[10:32] You'd wait how long?

[10:33] If you put in an order now for a big Lebowski, how long are you going to wait?

[10:37] You went way to year.

[10:38] A year.

[10:40] Who knows?

[10:42] I think Alien is going to be showing it to Expo, but my money is down and you're not going

[10:47] to see Alien in November.

[10:49] I hope it ships in November, but history has taught me when we see a reveal of a game,

[10:56] people other than Stern usually make you wait years, not months, years.

[11:02] Let's see what happens, but my money is on Alien 2017 at the earliest.

[11:09] If I'm wrong, I hope I am.

[11:12] Stern's seeing all this.

[11:14] They're making a game that is like, okay, this is only for collectors.

[11:18] What does that do?

[11:19] It creates a response from everyone who's not very wealthy, who's not a collector who

[11:25] can't afford a $15,000 machine, a $10,000 machine, an $8,000 machine.

[11:31] It ostensibly should be pricing people out of the market, but here's what I think is

[11:37] going on inside people's heads.

[11:39] Is as much as people are pissed off, I bet a lot of people are trying to figure out how

[11:46] to save up enough money to get one of these things.

[11:50] Because if I know that this is where it's going and Star Wars is going to go this way

[11:54] in other games, I want to still be in the game.

[11:59] I think something's going to happen.

[12:02] In Black Knight and I talk about this in the podcast, you're going to hear this week coming

[12:05] up.

[12:06] But the market's going to stall.

[12:08] I think it's going to stall for the fact that there's just too much volume of machines

[12:14] that are coming out new.

[12:15] There's too many people that are going to want to sell their games, their Stern-LE games,

[12:19] for what they kind of paid for them, and they're just going to sit.

[12:23] They're going to sit, and they're going to sit, and they're going to have to wait.

[12:27] They might get.

[12:28] So let's say you have a Stern, Ghostbusters, LE, and you want to sell it.

[12:34] I don't want to use that title because I think it's still hot and still fresh and people

[12:37] are still going to go in on the LEs.

[12:39] But let's say you have a Star Trek LE, and history has shown that you have been able

[12:43] to sell your Star Trek LE between $7,500 and $8,000, which is more around what you paid

[12:50] for it.

[12:51] Are they still going to fly off the shelf at that price?

[12:53] Or are you going to have to wait?

[12:54] It's going to take you months, maybe, not days or hours to sell those kinds of machines.

[12:58] I don't even want to think about all the Valley Williams and all the other hot top 100 titles

[13:03] that come up for sale and have delivered a decent return for people if they go in on them

[13:10] because collectors collect.

[13:15] To collect something new, a lot of collectors will shuffle stuff out.

[13:18] And if when you're shuffling stuff out, you're not getting nearly what you put into it,

[13:25] it creates that stall because you're not getting your money back.

[13:28] You're starting to lose money in the hobby.

[13:31] And then it becomes really hard to make money.

[13:33] Like, I said this in my last podcast, it's really hard to make money flipping a Batman

[13:39] 66.

[13:40] I really don't know who's going to pay over for an LE.

[13:46] I don't know if anyone gets a super LE and wants to sell it.

[13:50] They're going to be able to get more for it.

[13:53] It's going to be interesting.

[13:54] 18 months, a year, a year and six months from now, a year and a half after Batman super LE comes out,

[14:03] people who own it will be willing to sell it.

[14:06] And I was just wondering too, I don't know if you guys have been thinking this.

[14:10] Okay, so November of 2017 will be a year from the moment Batman super LE goes on sale.

[14:19] And then six months, I can't even do them months in my head.

[14:21] But I'm just saying, when it comes up for sale, what do you think Batman super LE will go for?

[14:29] Do you think the market will be flooded with Batman super LE's a year and a half after

[14:33] comes out knowing that there's going to be like Lawler's game and Star Wars and probably

[14:40] JJP number.

[14:41] I hope so, JJP number four.

[14:43] I said, I said it.

[14:45] I have a hard time even believing it.

[14:48] Will highway be still kicking around with game number three?

[14:51] Will Dutch have a game number two?

[14:54] What's going to happen?

[14:55] Will people offer 20,000 for one or will they be like, you know what, that hype is long gone

[15:00] and I'll give you 10 for it.

[15:01] I tend to think you're going to see the hype long gone and you're going to see all that

[15:07] innovation that went into it, go into future stirs.

[15:10] If they do more super LE is two, Batman might not be the darling because there's something

[15:16] to be said for being this is the most expensive stern pinball machine of all time.

[15:20] In fact, this is the most expensive pinball machine that has ever been made and there's

[15:25] only 30 of them out there.

[15:27] And there'll still be novelty items because as much as I want to hate and hate and hate

[15:31] on it and be like, you know, stupid, it's just dressing.

[15:34] I don't know, like I'm still really, I'd be excited to walk up to the super LE Batman

[15:39] and see what it sounds like and see what the top is like and see what the armor is like

[15:43] and will it just be a fucking visual mind fuck that will just super excite us.

[15:53] So good segue to the point of what are people who have pre-orders down thinking right now?

[15:59] I saw some guys say that he has to make up his mind with his distributor now in two

[16:04] weeks if whether or not he wants to stay in with his pre-order and I am going to call

[16:11] my distributor about this because I was told when I put my pre-order down that we were

[16:16] going to be able to see what the pin looked like before the refundable period was up.

[16:23] If your distributor is telling you you have to go in on it, site unseen, completely blind

[16:28] in two weeks because you're not seeing anything on this pin until October 14th.

[16:33] I would be really nervous and anxious and a little work, I would be really worried.

[16:40] I'll tell you why because if Stern shows this thing and it isn't like the complete,

[16:47] you know, redesign amazing new game because the, you know, the black knight layout

[16:53] did not set the world on fire and if it is not going to blow people away and you've

[17:01] got 10 grand into it and it's new in box and you want to sell it to someone else, I'm

[17:07] not sure like you'll be able to move at that price so easily.

[17:12] Now if you go in and it's the pins amazing and it blows people away and the mechanism

[17:17] in the upper left is fucking incredible and the theme is beyond incredible and it looks

[17:23] unlike any other Stern ever.

[17:24] Like they, you know, they really put everything into it.

[17:28] Then you might have the ability to move it at what you paid or more and but you have,

[17:33] that's a risk you're taking.

[17:34] Now I also have been thinking a lot about something and that is Batman 66 coming out after

[17:42] Ghostbusters Ellie.

[17:44] I think it's going to have a really, really, really hard time visually looking superior

[17:51] to Ghostbusters.

[17:52] I think we're all forgetting here that Zombie Yeti's artwork is the greatest art package

[17:58] I will, I think on any pinball machine ever.

[18:02] The complete package of the cabinet, of the playfield, of the plastics, of the back glass,

[18:08] the thing looks phenomenal.

[18:11] The game looks like no other.

[18:13] At Sunshine Landermat Ghostbusters Ellie looks leagues above everything else.

[18:18] I get that Jersey Jack quality.

[18:21] There's a little bit more quality there.

[18:23] But in terms of visual wow, nothing, nothing has ever visually wowed me as much as Star,

[18:29] or sorry, Ghostbusters Ellie.

[18:31] And so for Batman 66 to come in right after that as the most comparable pin, I think the

[18:39] artist and the design team putting Batman 66 together has a really tough time to make

[18:47] it pop more than Ghostbusters Ellie.

[18:49] Because it's not going to, I don't think it's going to be a lot of hand drawn art.

[18:53] If it is, it's going to be much more simple like Batman cartoon like art than the very

[18:58] colorful and intricate and detailed game that Zombie Yeti gave us.

[19:03] So I think Stern's going to have a hard time showing it and being like, here it is.

[19:09] This is two grand more than Zombie Yeti's Ghostbusters.

[19:14] And the LCD, which is going to be a big part of this new package, better really wow people.

[19:23] It better have not just like color, but clips and call outs and all this stuff.

[19:28] I really hope Stern is far along in this game because again, if people jump on it and

[19:34] it seems like there's early code and they've already sold out every one, it doesn't

[19:39] feel like when Stern sells out of a pin and it's really popular and they kind of, I don't

[19:45] know if there's urgency to like keep tweaking it because it's already selling so well.

[19:51] And I hope that's not the case and I hope they do keep tweaking it.

[19:55] So I think people who have pre-orders on and myself included, if we have to pick our,

[20:01] choose if we want to enter out before we see it.

[20:08] Man, all of a sudden, right?

[20:10] All of a sudden we are feeling like Jersey Jack buyers, right?

[20:16] All of a sudden we are feeling like John Papaduke buyers.

[20:20] I guess exactly what John Papaduke did.

[20:23] I mean we're handing over 10 grand, we don't even know what we're getting.

[20:26] And what we do know, what we do know, it's a somewhat re-skin of the Batman Dark Knight.

[20:33] We don't really like that game.

[20:35] So it's not starting out great.

[20:39] But as I've said in the past, the theme is so popular, the theme is so great that people

[20:44] really would love to have one.

[20:46] The other thing that's interesting is how much are people really Batman 66 fans?

[20:52] I was talking, I was thinking about this.

[20:54] Like all of a sudden, this is not a theme that people talk about.

[20:58] It's not even, you don't even see the show on TV very much.

[21:01] It's 50-year-old show, right?

[21:04] 50-year-old.

[21:05] I mean I remember watching it when I was a kid on some classic TV network and I enjoyed

[21:10] it.

[21:11] But it's not the most like dream theme.

[21:16] And people are kind of acting like it is.

[21:19] I don't, I just find that funny too.

[21:22] Because I find whenever they dangle a theme in front of us, all of a sudden it's like,

[21:27] this is the greatest thing ever.

[21:29] I've been waiting for this theme my whole life.

[21:30] I mean, it's like, it's awake collectors and I think obsessed new unbox buyers justify

[21:35] going in.

[21:36] It's like, oh this is my dream theme.

[21:38] This is my dream theme.

[21:39] I'm definitely going in.

[21:40] You know, how many people say alien is their dream theme?

[21:43] And if alien is all these people's dream themes, then why has an alien Ellie sold out yet?

[21:49] We want to talk about that.

[21:51] I don't want to talk about that on this podcast.

[21:53] I want to wait to alien is reveal that Expo.

[21:55] I don't want to get into why it hasn't sold out yet.

[21:59] I want to talk about Batman.

[22:00] I want to talk about Stern.

[22:01] I want to talk about the effect this will have.

[22:04] You know, and I still think that this is going to cause some people to really wonder what

[22:10] the fuck they're doing in this hobby.

[22:12] And I said it, like it kind of bummed me out because this is stupid.

[22:17] Two Stern super Ellie's is the amount of money I put as a down as the deposit down on my

[22:24] hellcat.

[22:26] That's as much money as my Subaru STI costs when I was like 25.

[22:32] It's as much money as my Honda S2000 costs when I was in college.

[22:36] It's like, it's a pinball machine.

[22:40] A $15,000 pinball machine.

[22:44] And I just don't know how you're going to have.

[22:49] It's like, I'm going on this road again.

[22:50] I shouldn't even bother.

[22:51] It doesn't matter.

[22:52] The guys who buy this is not about fun.

[22:54] I've been looking at some of the videos of people sharing their game rooms.

[22:59] And these guys have like 15, 20 amazing every news Stern Ellie that comes out.

[23:04] Like to them, like having a super Ellie, it's just the focal point of their game room.

[23:10] And it makes total marketing sense.

[23:12] Because think about it, everyone's pissed off.

[23:15] But everyone deep down inside if they had the money would still want one.

[23:19] And that's just the freaking truth.

[23:21] You guys would still want one.

[23:22] You'd buy one.

[23:24] You'd go in on one.

[23:25] I would.

[23:26] I hope I get a chance to get one.

[23:28] I'm going to apply for one.

[23:31] And my application is simple.

[23:32] It's that I only have room for one pinball machine.

[23:35] I love Stern pinball machines.

[23:38] And if I can put one machine in my living room, in my bedroom arcade apartment in New York

[23:42] City, I would want to put the best.

[23:46] And I think it's going to be the best.

[23:48] And so shouldn't the guy who can afford it and only can have one.

[23:55] He should have not have a chance at this scary.

[23:57] This is me begging you.

[23:59] Look, he's got canade on his knees.

[24:00] No, I mean, I'm not going to gravel.

[24:02] But I don't think I have a chance.

[24:04] I mean, there's so many collectors out there that really have been spending $100,000

[24:12] plus with Stern.

[24:14] And this is supposed to be the thank you to them.

[24:15] And so I also know that there's not many that are open to the application process.

[24:20] Gary is still, I think, giving 25.

[24:23] He's the one who's going to go and offer them to those 25 people.

[24:26] It's not going to be through the application process.

[24:28] All 30 are not available.

[24:30] So think about it.

[24:32] The people applying are fighting for just five spots.

[24:36] Everyone else, Gary is going to give it to him.

[24:37] I do have some information that's pretty newsworthy that you guys are all not understanding

[24:45] and have speculated on.

[24:47] And that is how are they going to know if people sell their super LE and it moves location.

[24:53] And I have been told that from someone at Stern that the Spike 2 system has GPS built

[25:02] into it.

[25:03] So it knows where it's at.

[25:06] Right?

[25:07] Now I'm not sure if there's an ability to pop off the GPS tracker on it.

[25:12] Like some total recall scene where you pull the tracker out of your nose.

[25:16] And it's like, Stern has no idea where it really is.

[25:20] But that's, ostensibly, how they could track where these things are at.

[25:24] Now, I don't know how they're going to deal with issues where collectors are going

[25:31] to be like, well, what if they have two houses?

[25:33] I'm going to move it over here.

[25:34] I'm going to, I don't know.

[25:35] I think they're going to have a hard time tracking that because can you pick up that GPS

[25:41] signal when the game is off?

[25:43] And what are they going to do?

[25:44] If the game's off and doesn't get turned on again, I could see people selling it and be

[25:50] like, you just can't turn it on because Stern will know it's moved until a year and a

[25:55] half from now.

[25:56] And people would probably be like, that's cool.

[25:59] I'm fine with that.

[26:00] And even what would happen if Stern did find out that it moved, right?

[26:07] We just detected that your machine has moved from California to Chicago.

[26:13] What happened?

[26:14] Like, they're not going to go get it.

[26:17] They would probably just blacklist the person from buying another super early in the future.

[26:21] And if it becomes like this exclusive club, like once you're in, you're in, you get

[26:24] first dibs, which I think is smart.

[26:29] No one's going to want to jeopardize their position in that club, right?

[26:33] So this whole thing is interesting.

[26:36] And I wondered too if my podcast and maybe it did, maybe it didn't.

[26:39] If my podcast inspired spooky, spooky, spooky pinball, the home of, the spooky pinball, if

[26:47] my podcast inspired spooky to make its announcement the day after or the day of my podcast where

[26:53] I said the smartest thing to do would go, if you're going to make a limited number of games,

[26:59] just make them limited, don't make variations and you'll make people much happier.

[27:04] And spooky just announced that they're going to have game three be 500 units with no variations.

[27:11] So we're only making 500 and there's not going to be a tiered system.

[27:17] And, you know, it's curious because I, I'm curious to see how people flock to spooky.

[27:26] Now, spooky also announced that he's raising the price a little bit.

[27:28] I think it's like 6,700 now for a game.

[27:33] And he's saying that's because they're going to hire some new people.

[27:35] They're going to get more innovation into their games.

[27:38] And I think it's great.

[27:39] I think spooky needs that.

[27:41] They have to up the game a little bit if they want to stay competitive.

[27:46] But it's interesting the model he's taking.

[27:49] And I agree with it because I think spooky did fuck up with the Rob Zombie having like 50

[27:53] L.E.'s and 250 regulars because right, right away, right, they start to feel regular.

[27:58] And why bother?

[27:59] They're all L.E.'s.

[28:00] They all should have had the nice armor and they all should have been and if Charlie

[28:05] had charged and he knows this, he had charged 6,500 for all 300.

[28:09] He would have sold everyone at that price.

[28:12] Everyone would have been happy.

[28:13] In fact, he could have charged a little bit more and everyone still would have been happy.

[28:16] He left money on the table with Rob Zombie.

[28:18] But that was before Stern showed its cards and before Stern went out there and said it

[28:26] might start doing crazy shit like this.

[28:28] And I think what Stern is doing is going to create another effect.

[28:32] And I think it's going to make people hold onto their money more until they see what

[28:36] Stern does instead of chasing after every new spooky and every new alien or highway pinball

[28:44] machine or every new Dutch because at the end of the day, the only thing that drives

[28:49] these boutique companies is their ability to sell you something limited that feels more

[28:54] like a collectible.

[28:56] And if Stern is also going to do that and do it with themes that are much better than

[29:01] a boutique could afford, I think boutiques have to be nervous.

[29:06] I would be really, really nervous if I was Andrew Highway, if I was Yop over a Dutch.

[29:13] And I think I'm saying that right.

[29:15] If I was Mike at home pin trying to do Thunderbirds, I'd be really nervous if I was Jack right

[29:24] now because Stern is forcing everybody to raise their prices.

[29:30] And if Stern does that, Stern can do it and feel confident it can ship you the games quickly.

[29:38] But if Stern forces everyone to raise their prices, what does that do?

[29:43] That decreases the customer base for those companies.

[29:47] And a lot of those companies need to be very successful on their pins.

[29:52] They need to drive volume up for every new release.

[29:55] And I don't know why Black Knight got down voted when he said, like alien pinball has

[30:00] to be like a juggernaut home run for Andrew Highway or highway pinball can't succeed.

[30:06] You know, Hobbit need to be home run for Jack and it was delayed two years because Jack

[30:11] had to get financial stuff together because he, man, he, if he had gone belly up with everyone's

[30:17] Hobbit pre-order money, where would we be right now?

[30:20] And we know that that was close to happening.

[30:22] And this could be Stern's move to just bully a lot of the boutique guys out.

[30:30] And I think it's going to be really interesting.

[30:32] I just think I'd be really nervous and I, if I was a boutique, I would say, look, we need

[30:39] to be able to ship pins faster.

[30:42] If alien is revealed and it's just trickling out, or if there's a long delay between

[30:47] Expo and alien shipping, I'd be really nervous if I had alien pre-order money down because

[30:55] you might be waiting a few years if that's the case.

[30:59] Now, I hope that's not the case.

[31:00] I mean, Andrew says they're going into production in two to three weeks and I have to believe

[31:04] them and I want to see it ship in November and I want to, I, I, I, you guys have waited

[31:09] long enough.

[31:10] And I think competition is a good thing because without competition, man, man, Stern,

[31:15] this guy is the limit.

[31:17] If they say this whole hobby is collectors only now and operators start to get left out,

[31:21] it's faster and faster, they're going to, you know, they're going to keep raising these

[31:26] prices and until it stalls.

[31:31] And I think we're going to see that happen too.

[31:33] So I think the next two years of pinball are going to be very, very interesting.

[31:36] I think people are going to be very, very pissed off.

[31:40] And I just want to end this episode with some words of encouragement to Rare Hero because

[31:45] I actually sent him a note too because he's still, there's rumors that the premium might

[31:49] be delayed of Ghostbusters.

[31:52] And I said to him, I said, Greg, just, just cancel your order because he's still saying,

[31:59] maybe I should wait until they fix the code and yeah, why not?

[32:03] Dude, why not?

[32:04] And this is where a lot of us are just like, if you're going to go on a pin sight every

[32:10] day and say the same thing, just stop.

[32:14] You just need to stop making themselves look stupid because everyone's too smart for

[32:18] that.

[32:19] Greg, you're a good guy and you know this.

[32:23] If you wait and you just wait until the code is updated and look to see if like the quality

[32:32] control issues are fixed, why not just wait?

[32:35] There's no advantage to you getting the game early because God help pinside, God help

[32:40] all of us.

[32:41] If Greg, you get your pin and there's ghosted inserts maybe or the code is not updated

[32:47] for six months and you're just going to be like bitching about it but you yourself said

[32:53] you should have waited.

[32:54] I would just wait because they're not going to stop making Ghostbusters premiums at all.

[32:59] And if you wait it, who knows, maybe you want to go on a Batman instead, maybe you know

[33:03] there's more games that come out that are got the code and then you know got the sort of

[33:08] fun factor that you're looking for but to keep going on pinside and saying I just played

[33:14] a Ghostbusters early, I didn't find it fun.

[33:16] The modes run it for me.

[33:18] And then you're like I'm still in on one.

[33:20] I just don't get it.

[33:21] I don't get it.

[33:22] I kind of want to offer you 50 bucks if you just bail out in your order and just go out

[33:27] and have like a decent meal.

[33:28] I'm going to put that out there.

[33:30] Canada's offering rare hero $50.

[33:32] I will send it to his PayPal.

[33:34] If he backs out of his Ghostbusters premium order, I think he'll he can go have a nice

[33:39] meal, like a burger or milkshake, leave a nice tip, he'll be happy and then he can come

[33:45] home and not be stressed out that he has to.

[33:48] He's making it sound like he's like he has to accept this game that he doesn't find fun

[33:52] and he's torn because he loves the theme.

[33:54] Just let it go man.

[33:55] Let it go.

[33:56] All right.

[33:57] That's it.

[33:58] Just another little take on this whole Batman thing.

[33:59] If I want to hear from you guys, what do you guys think of Batman 66?

[34:03] What do you think of the pricing?

[34:05] I've been reading what you've been saying on, on Pinside, but I'll happily read your comments

[34:11] on a future episode of what your thoughts are on this whole thing.

[34:15] For all of my listeners out there, I send some emails out, but if you guys could do me a

[34:19] favor.

[34:20] For you guys who listen to Canada's Pinball podcast and you enjoy it or you hate it, I don't

[34:25] care which one it is.

[34:27] Can you go on if you use iTunes and leave me a review of this podcast on iTunes?

[34:34] I only have like 22 reviews and I know I get around 500 plus listens every episode.

[34:42] I'd really appreciate it.

[34:44] If you think I'm a douchebag and you hate this podcast, but you can't help but listen.

[34:48] We know who you are.

[34:50] Tell me that.

[34:51] It'd be great.

[34:52] But have a great weekend guys.

[34:55] It's a beautiful day here in New York.

[34:57] Play Pinball, but more importantly, have fun and realize that these things are toys and

[35:02] no one is making you buy any of it.

[35:06] Nothing that Stern does is forcing you in.

[35:10] We all have to learn how to control our obsession over this hobby and we all can't feel like

[35:15] we have to have every new game that comes out.

[35:19] There are a lot of games that are fun that we should just sit back and enjoy, drink beers

[35:23] with your friends and go watch football this weekend, do other things, have other interests.

[35:28] Don't think that a $15,000 Batman Super LE will change your life, will make you happier

[35:34] or really add that much value to your whole existence.

[35:38] It won't.

[35:39] That being said, I still want one.

[35:42] I hate you Stern.

[35:43] I can't control my obsession.

[35:44] Have a good day.
