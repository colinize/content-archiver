[00:00] Golder Up, Tide, Make a little Up, and,

[00:04] A little turtle, dove, and,

[00:06] An automation, Dick, Son, Night,

[00:08] Fitt, my, Life, Oh, It's, Oh, Right,

[00:13] My, Dick, Sea, Land, Deliver,

[00:17] I, said, I, said, I, said,

[00:20] I, said, I, said, I, said,

[00:21] Oh, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] I'm your host, Kaneda.

[00:26] Happy Monday, everybody.

[00:28] It's great to have everybody here.

[00:29] We're going to talk about what's going on in the world of pinball.

[00:32] And the main thing this week is going to be these James Bond 60th anniversary edition

[00:38] machines.

[00:39] They are finally going to make their way into the homes of these buyers who really are going

[00:45] to tell the entire pinball world how they spent $19,995 on this game.

[00:51] Probably most of them will have bought this game off the back of the truck from their

[00:55] distributors for like $17,500.

[00:57] Now look, there's so much about this game, we really absolutely hardly know anything

[01:02] about the game.

[01:03] All we know is who designed it, which is one of the greatest designers of all time.

[01:08] We know the artwork is not very nice, but we also know that there's probably not much

[01:13] code in this game.

[01:14] There's definitely not a $20,000 pinball machine here, but this game is going to be

[01:20] unboxed.

[01:21] Now one question I have is how many of these do you think Stern Pinball makes on the inaugural

[01:27] run?

[01:28] You think they're going to make all 500 of them?

[01:30] Here's my prediction on this game.

[01:32] I think when they make this game and people start unboxing this machine, I think the game

[01:37] is going to shoot just fine.

[01:39] It's a Keith Elwin game.

[01:41] It's going to have good flow.

[01:43] But I still think for 99.9% of us, when we watch these rich owners try to justify their

[01:50] purchase, I still think the rest of us are still going to be pointing our fingers at

[01:54] these gentlemen and laughing at them for spending this much money on a game that barely has

[02:01] anything in it.

[02:02] And that's the thing.

[02:03] This isn't the Beatles.

[02:04] This isn't Batman 66 SLE.

[02:07] This isn't Elvira 40th anniversary.

[02:09] Those are fully feature, fully coded games with tons of assets.

[02:14] This thing has a cheap little LCD screen on the play field that tells you where to shoot

[02:20] next.

[02:21] It has a spinning hat in the game that George Gomez did not want in his game.

[02:26] Now look, I was listening to the Loser Kid Pinball podcast.

[02:29] They did a really good interview with Keith Elwin.

[02:31] If you haven't checked it out, go check it out.

[02:34] But I was shocked and I reached out to these guys because I was like, all right, think

[02:38] about it like this, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:39] You're interviewing Keith Elwin about his latest game in the world of pinball.

[02:44] What has the entire conversation been about when it comes to Keith Elwin's game?

[02:49] It's been about the crazy price of this machine, right?

[02:53] It is the most expensive pinball machine ever released into the world as an MSRP title,

[03:00] right?

[03:01] 1999, 1995.

[03:02] All right.

[03:03] The one question I was just hoping they would ask Keith Elwin was this, Keith, what do you

[03:08] think of the price of this game?

[03:10] Keith, would you spend this much money on the machine?

[03:14] And they didn't ask the question and I reached out to them and they said the reason they

[03:18] didn't ask the question is that Keith Elwin has no say over the price of the game.

[03:24] And that's why they didn't ask him the question.

[03:28] Now look, I know he didn't set the price, but he still has an opinion about the price.

[03:33] And that is why when you're interviewing him, why not ask him what is his opinion?

[03:39] When you're interviewing someone, do you stop asking questions on a topic because they

[03:44] have no control over it?

[03:46] It's like asking someone, hey, what do you think of the weather today?

[03:49] Well, I'm not going to ask you that because you had no control over the weather.

[03:52] No, everybody has an opinion about the price of this game.

[03:57] And I really do want someone when they interview Keith Elwin next.

[04:01] First question, Keith, what do you think about this James Bond game being priced at $20,000?

[04:08] Keith?

[04:09] What do you think about only making 500 of these games?

[04:13] Would you like to see more people get their hands on these machines?

[04:16] Keith, what do you think of the code in this game?

[04:18] Is it deep enough and does it warrant the incredible price tag of this machine?

[04:24] Now look, Canada doesn't really interview people anymore.

[04:27] People don't want to come on the show.

[04:29] I get it.

[04:30] I'm not going to shield their games.

[04:32] I'm not going to shield the companies.

[04:34] I'm just going to ask them the tough questions.

[04:37] Now here's what I heard.

[04:38] I heard Keith Elwin was not happy with the price of the game.

[04:41] I hear it was not his decision.

[04:43] And this isn't the kind of pinball machine that Keith Elwin wants to make.

[04:47] And I guarantee you, if Keith Elwin going into this was told this is going to be a $20,000

[04:53] game, I highly doubt he would run into this project.

[04:57] Now what would have been exciting is if Stern Pinball said, hey, look, we're going to make

[05:01] a $20,000 pinball machine.

[05:03] We're going to give Keith Elwin the highest bomb in the history of Stern Pinball.

[05:08] Then we all would be really excited.

[05:10] And then we would probably see a Stern Pinball machine that looks like a Balli Williams engineering

[05:16] masterpiece from the 90s instead of this very simple overly barren game for this much money.

[05:22] Oh, but Canada, you're harping on the past.

[05:24] Let's move to the future.

[05:25] All right, here's something that no one's heard yet.

[05:26] Are you ready for some news from Canada's Pinball podcast?

[05:30] So I'm here to tell you right now that, yes, Jason Knapp has half of the story down around

[05:35] Big Bang Bar.

[05:37] Planetary Pinball has the rights to Big Bang Bar Pinball.

[05:41] Now in the past, Planetary Pinball has worked on giving licenses to older titles to Chicago

[05:48] Gaming Company to make remakes of our beloved old titles.

[05:53] I'm here to tell you right now on Canada's Pinball podcast, a rumor I am hearing is the

[05:57] following.

[05:58] I'm hearing that Planetary Pinball is fed up with all the delays over at Chicago Gaming

[06:03] Company.

[06:04] I'm hearing that Planetary Pinball is exploring how they themselves can manufacture Big Bang

[06:11] Bar.

[06:12] Now look, I don't know if that company is going to be called Planetary Pinball or something

[06:16] else, but I am hearing that this Big Bang Bar remake is happening, but it will not come

[06:22] out as a Chicago Gaming Company game.

[06:25] It's also not going to be raw thrills.

[06:27] I still believe that Pulp Fiction is going to be the first raw thrills title we see and

[06:32] that will be made by a Chicago Gaming Company.

[06:35] Are you starting to get confused?

[06:38] Does all of this seem a little nuts, right?

[06:40] How many pinball manufacturing companies do we need?

[06:44] We all know this.

[06:45] There's a lot of money to be made in pinball when you can do it right.

[06:48] There are millions of dollars that you can put in the bank every year if you can figure

[06:53] out how to manufacture like 2,000 pinball machines a year.

[06:58] Problem is, it's not like making a pizza pie.

[07:01] Making hundreds of pinball machines a year is extremely difficult.

[07:06] Making a few thousand is super hard.

[07:09] And there are not a lot of manufacturing places out in the world that are capable of manufacturing

[07:15] a few thousand pinball machines a year.

[07:17] None of the numbers are really transparent.

[07:19] The only pinball company that I've seen since I've been doing this that has been very transparent

[07:24] about how many games they can make a week, how many games they can make a year, how many

[07:29] games they can make every 18 months, the only company that's ever been transparent about

[07:34] it has been Spooky Pinball.

[07:36] And the only company that's ever stayed true to their schedule to the T has always been

[07:41] Spooky Pinball.

[07:42] Now look, I know a lot of people are like, well, it's a competitive advantage if companies

[07:46] like Stern and Jersey Jack reveal their numbers or multi-morphic.

[07:50] No it's not.

[07:51] What is the competitive advantage to any of these guys?

[07:55] It takes way too long to get a machine into production.

[07:58] It takes way too long to R&D, to order parts from vendors, to figure out the artwork, to

[08:04] get license or approval, all of that.

[08:06] And you're telling me what happens if Stern says we make 800 games a week.

[08:10] What does that do to Jersey Jack?

[08:11] The only reason why many of these companies do not want you to know how many games they

[08:17] make a week.

[08:18] It's so easy.

[08:19] The answer is staring us right in the face because they don't want you to know how inefficient

[08:24] they might be.

[08:25] They don't want you to know how long the weight might be.

[08:28] Stern Pinball's problem has never been about volume.

[08:31] It's just been about demand.

[08:33] The demand for a Stern machine is always through the roof.

[08:36] This company is still making orders they got a few years ago.

[08:40] Now I'm here on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast to correct myself.

[08:44] So I said that Elvira was indefinitely delayed and now it looks like that's not the case.

[08:50] The February build of Elvira will be taking place.

[08:55] So if you ordered an Elvira and you are expecting your game to be built this month, there is

[09:00] still a very good chance that is going to happen.

[09:02] The thing George was probably talking about is after this run of Elvira, will there be

[09:08] another run and I think that's where he doesn't know where it's going to fall into the schedule.

[09:13] Here's another bit of really interesting news because if you saw on Facebook a Mr. Jack

[09:19] Danger said to everybody that he will not be attending Texas Pinball Festival at the

[09:26] end of March.

[09:27] Now look, why won't Jack be at TPF?

[09:30] You have to ask yourself this question.

[09:32] If Stern Pinball is releasing a new game in March and we are hearing the rumors are it

[09:38] is Brian Eddy's Venom or Jack Danger's Foo Fighters as the next two titles from Stern

[09:44] Pinball.

[09:45] Remember Stern is on a really long delay.

[09:48] The last new game they came out with before James Bond, Stern's last game was freaking

[09:54] Rush right and Rush was like December, January of 2021, 2022.

[10:01] So it was a long time ago.

[10:03] Now Stern Pinball usually makes three cornerstone games a year and those games have been in

[10:10] development.

[10:11] Even though there's been like a supply chain shortage, we know that Jack Danger's game

[10:16] has been in development for a long time.

[10:18] We know that John Borg's next game has already begun.

[10:21] We know that Keith Elwin has been working on his game for a really long time, right?

[10:25] In the loser kid interview is really interesting.

[10:28] Elwin said he knows his game is not coming out for a while.

[10:33] So that leads me to speculate that there are two anniversaries happening in 2025, Jaws

[10:40] and Back to the Future.

[10:42] And I think it's going to be one of those.

[10:44] I do think it's going to be Jaws, but I could see Keith Elwin making the 50th anniversary

[10:49] of Jaws Pinball or maybe it's the 40th anniversary of Back to the Future.

[10:54] I think both of those themes have a lot of people excited.

[10:58] Obviously Back to the Future is the one people are clamoring for more.

[11:02] Even though we've had a Back to the Future pinball machine, I still think Back to the

[11:06] Future has more of a mainstream appeal than Jaws.

[11:09] But look at what Keith Elwin did with Godzilla.

[11:12] This is why Keith Elwin is so damn good.

[11:15] This is why Keith Elwin scares me because it doesn't even matter about theme.

[11:19] See I would argue that Godzilla wouldn't do tremendously well simply because it's based

[11:25] on these old Godzilla movies that most of us have never seen.

[11:30] And look at what Keith Elwin did with Godzilla.

[11:33] He made arguably maybe one of the best pinball machines of all time with Godzilla.

[11:39] Now imagine what he's going to do with Jaws or Back to the Future.

[11:43] In the interview he said something really interesting.

[11:45] He said he's working on his next game and it took them two months, two months of design

[11:52] to make sure the ramps are right in the game because there's a lot of action between the

[11:57] two ramps in the game.

[11:59] And think about that.

[12:00] Can you imagine Keith Elwin over a 60 day period laboring over the layout of his game?

[12:08] And that is why when you get up to a Keith Elwin machine it just plays like nothing else

[12:13] in the entire Stern portfolio and I think universally you might argue some of his games

[12:19] are too hard but his shot geometry and his design is stellar.

[12:24] Like absolutely stellar.

[12:25] Now speaking of design and layout, here's an interesting story I've been following.

[12:31] There is a rumor because it hasn't been documented.

[12:34] There's a rumor that Batman 66 has had two iterations.

[12:40] That the early builds of the game were very clunky.

[12:44] It used cheaper wood and the orbit rails were not the best and the targets were not the

[12:49] best near the magnet.

[12:51] There is a rumor that when Stern made later runs of Batman 66 they fixed a lot of the

[12:57] issues.

[12:58] They changed the play field wood, they changed the cabinet wood and that the newer versions

[13:04] of Batman 66 play far superior than the original versions of the game.

[13:10] And look I just spent $25,000 on a super limited edition of Batman SLE and that's one of the

[13:18] original builds of the game.

[13:21] But I also heard from the person who's been talking about this, I believe it's Thunderbird

[13:25] on pin side, that you're able to make changes to the older games to make them shoot better.

[13:32] Well you're obviously not going to be able to change the cabinet wood or the play field

[13:35] wood.

[13:36] Maybe some of the ball guides and the rails and the targets are swappable with the new

[13:42] items if you order them.

[13:44] I don't know.

[13:45] I think we need to figure this out.

[13:46] We need to get an old Batman like an Ellie and put it next to a newer one and play them

[13:53] side by side.

[13:54] I would love it.

[13:55] Is there anyone out there who can even figure out how to test this hypothesis?

[14:00] Because if this is the case and Stern Pinball actually did make tweaks to a game like mid

[14:05] cycle within manufacturing, this is a huge issue.

[14:09] I mean it makes me think like why wouldn't they make better changes to Ghostbusters.

[14:13] I mean that's the one game that really needs them to go back.

[14:17] Go back and fix some of the design issues with that game and then I think you'd really

[14:21] have a game that's worth the money that game is getting.

[14:24] Alright, now speaking of worth the money that something is getting, did you see this?

[14:28] The Stern Pinball Alley sign, you know the humongous sign that Stern released a few years

[14:33] ago.

[14:34] You know it says Stern Pinball Alley.

[14:36] Guess how much that sign just sold for this weekend?

[14:39] $8,000, right?

[14:41] And the guy who was selling it, really nice guy, Rampomatic, he's down in like PA somewhere.

[14:47] He basically offered the game for $8,000 or best offer and he had a ton of offers which

[14:53] leads me to believe he actually priced it too low.

[14:56] He easily could have sold this thing for $10,000 or more and this just goes to show you where

[15:02] we're at still.

[15:03] Like the high end buyer or the operator that wants something unique, they will pay a crazy

[15:08] price for stuff.

[15:10] This thing is huge though.

[15:11] Like I think some people underestimate how much craftsmanship went into this sign because

[15:16] he sent me pictures of it.

[15:18] In some pipe dream world I was thinking like, oh I'll get a new house and this thing would

[15:22] be perfect in my living room and then I woke up and I'm like Chris, you're a grown man.

[15:27] You're too old to make your house look like that.

[15:30] I don't need it.

[15:31] I need to be using my money to buy a house.

[15:33] I passed on making him an offer but man he sold it like an hour after I reached out to

[15:38] him.

[15:39] Everybody forgets, Stern Pimbal originally sold these things for $3,500 bucks.

[15:47] $3,500 bucks.

[15:49] And there's obviously demand for them.

[15:51] There's obviously demand for more toppers for Ghostbusters and Monsters and I really

[15:57] don't understand why Stern never does another run of these things because here's why I

[16:03] don't get it.

[16:04] It's not Stern who's making any of these things.

[16:08] They're not making that Pimbal Alley sign.

[16:11] Another company is.

[16:13] They're not making the topper for Ghostbusters.

[16:16] Another company is.

[16:17] And they could easily reach out to the original manufacturer of these things and just do another

[16:24] run.

[16:25] But that's not what they want to do.

[16:27] They love seeing this stuff.

[16:29] They love seeing us grown men throw three to four to five times what things used to cost

[16:36] at everything with a Stern logo on it.

[16:40] It's not that I blame them.

[16:41] It's just somewhat painful to see how we throw money out the door on this hobby.

[16:47] And FOMO is never really dead.

[16:49] It really isn't.

[16:50] Now I said this on my Saturday morning spectacular.

[16:53] I am not buying any more games in 2023.

[16:57] I'm encouraging every one of you to play each game before you buy it.

[17:02] I'm not going to tell you not to buy a game.

[17:05] You know you're a grown adult.

[17:07] You should do what you want with your money.

[17:10] But what I do encourage you to do is wait and see.

[17:13] I encourage you to play all these games at the shows coming up.

[17:17] I also encourage you when a new game comes out just wait a little bit and see where the

[17:23] market shakes out on the game with so many new titles coming right.

[17:27] And we counted them.

[17:28] There's like five new titles coming this spring summer with five new Pimbal machines

[17:33] coming into the world.

[17:35] And that's not even counting like all of the James Bond's they need to sell all those

[17:40] toy stories that are sitting at distributors.

[17:43] There are so many games that need to find a home.

[17:46] And then you've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of used games that are offered

[17:51] for sale every single month.

[17:53] And so if you just wait you're going to have the best of both worlds.

[17:58] You're going to be able to see what the inventory is what the market is.

[18:02] And most importantly you're going to be able to see if you actually like the game because

[18:08] you've played it.

[18:10] And that's it you know and look I'm not buying a new game because I just don't want anything

[18:14] else.

[18:15] I'm getting to this point in my life as I look for a house and I can tell you right now

[18:18] we went house hunting this weekend and I can tell you right now for well over a million

[18:23] dollars you get absolutely nothing within an hour of New York City.

[18:28] And I mean it when I say it is depressing.

[18:31] You could have a great salary.

[18:32] You could have a good job.

[18:33] You could have dual income.

[18:35] You could have a lot of money saved up.

[18:37] You could have all this stuff.

[18:38] But what I don't want to have is a lot of debt.

[18:41] Like I really don't want to have a lot of debt.

[18:43] My apartment is paid for.

[18:44] What we enjoy each month right now is cash flow.

[18:48] And that cash flow allows us to invest in wealth generation.

[18:53] And that's so important to me.

[18:55] I never want to go under water on a mortgage or I just don't want to buy too much house.

[19:00] Now that being said it's a hard time for Brendan myself and we're really struggling with this

[19:05] because when you go from living in a city to looking at what you can get in the suburbs

[19:10] and then you see like the size of these houses and how close they are to their neighbors

[19:16] and these towns with so little culture compared to New York City.

[19:21] I'm not going to lie to you.

[19:22] I came out of that experience a little depressed a little deflated and we're going to take

[19:27] it one month at a time.

[19:29] We are just starting the house hunt.

[19:31] The inventory is not there right now.

[19:33] And so pinball is a much needed distraction for me.

[19:37] It's a much needed distraction in my life and I love covering this hobby.

[19:40] You can hear my voice.

[19:41] I'm a little tired.

[19:42] It is Monday night.

[19:43] I've been up early.

[19:44] I got up early with Killian.

[19:46] But I want to thank each and every one of you so much for tuning into Canadians pinball

[19:49] podcast.

[19:50] Look we are at the calm before the storm a week from now we are going to see James Bond

[19:54] 60th unboxing.

[19:56] That's going to be fun.

[19:57] Then we're going to start to see Scooby Doo's land in people's homes.

[20:01] That's going to be fun.

[20:02] Then we're going to see if Jersey Jack pinball actually reveals a game at the end of this

[20:06] month.

[20:08] Then we're going to be in March and we know what is happening in March like the dam is

[20:12] going to break in March.

[20:14] We're going to get the new game from AP.

[20:15] And I think I lost my train of thought earlier on in this podcast people.

[20:19] I think Jack danger not being at TPF means we might get Foo Fighters instead of Venom.

[20:27] I think we're going to see a switcheroo.

[20:29] I think we're going to see Jack danger's Foo Fighters and that is why he's not attending

[20:34] TPF.

[20:35] We shall see if that is true.

[20:37] I think they need him back at the home fort.

[20:39] I think they might need him to do other stuff around the game.

[20:42] I think they might need him in the factory when Foo Fighters goes on the line.

[20:46] Isn't it going to be funny if it's not Foo Fighters like this whole time we've all been

[20:50] like no not Foo Fighters and it ends up being what everybody really wants which might be

[20:56] He-Man Masters of the universe.

[20:58] We shall see.

[20:59] Because think about it like this and someone had a very interesting theory.

[21:03] Stern is still so far backlogged on games and they're also moving their factory.

[21:09] So maybe it is a good year to come out with a couple games that are not going to have

[21:15] Godzilla like demand.

[21:17] A couple of games that are not going to have Indiana Jones like demand or Jaws.

[21:22] So maybe they're coming out with two softer themes to just give themselves some time to

[21:28] move into the new factory.

[21:31] Stern doesn't care.

[21:32] All they need to do is make sure they have this many games.

[21:34] They're making a week.

[21:36] They already have enough in the backlog to keep the line busy into next year.

[21:41] So this might be a strategic move to give their manufacturing some time to catch up.

[21:47] So we're going to see the new Stern, the new JJP, the new American pinball, maybe Pulp

[21:51] Fiction.

[21:52] And I just want to end this show by saying the following.

[21:55] I know I put up on my Facebook page that we need a hip hop or pop musician pinball machine.

[22:02] We do.

[22:03] I don't understand why every single pinball machine is like dad rock.

[22:09] We've had enough.

[22:10] It's not like we need more of it.

[22:11] And you're telling me that Eminem would not sell more pinball machines than Rush or Aerosmith?

[22:18] You're out of your mind.

[22:19] But also there's so many pop stars that if they made pinball machines, they would do

[22:24] tremendously well.

[22:26] And look, I'm talking about stuff that even the pinball demographic, right, 40 to 60-year-old

[22:32] white males, right, which is the primary buyer of pinball.

[22:36] Most of us grew up with hip hop.

[22:39] We grew up with pop music.

[22:42] So don't tell me that the only thing we want in pinball form is rock and roll.

[22:47] What about the Beastie Boys?

[22:49] What about Eminem?

[22:50] What about Michael Jackson?

[22:51] Like this stuff would not sell?

[22:53] Of course it would sell.

[22:55] And also like pinball is a high energy toy.

[22:58] And so pop music and hip hop is high energy.

[23:02] So I just think people are underestimating and being a little myopic when they say we

[23:07] don't need a hip hop pinball machine.

[23:09] Of course we do.

[23:11] All right, everybody, thank you so much.

[23:13] It's Monday.

[23:14] More is coming in this hobby.

[23:15] I'm excited.

[23:16] I don't know about you, but I'm super excited you're all here.

[23:18] Our club members are doing great.

[23:20] And we're going to keep coming at you every week with new episodes of Canadian Pinball

[23:24] Podcast.

[23:25] Talk to you soon.
