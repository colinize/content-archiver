[00:00] Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed, everybody knows the war is over, everybody knows the good guy's lost.

[00:13] CELESTE! CELESTE! CELESTE! CELESTE! CELESTE! CELESTE!

[00:17] Aw, welcome to Canadian SpinBop Podcast, happy Labor Day weekend, I hope none of you have children who went to Burning Man and are stuck in the mud.

[00:26] Well, you know who's not stuck in the mud anymore, we will be back next Saturday for the Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:32] I took a couple weeks off, I needed a couple weeks off just to decompress, go to the gym.

[00:37] I'm gonna try to do a push-up for every single club member I have on that Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:44] So that is 500, I think, and 93 push-ups. Can I do it? How long will that even take?

[00:49] We're gonna give it a fair shot, so here's what I wanna do on this episode of Canadian SpinBop Podcast, first and foremost.

[00:55] If you are a Patreon member, you saw a video I just uploaded, I just put together a nice thank you video for all the fans out there.

[01:02] Been doing this show for over eight years, freaking eight years of my life.

[01:07] I've been into pinball for like 10 years, but eight of them, you know, after being banned from pinside, have been dedicated to Canadian SpinBop Podcast.

[01:15] I wanna talk about Pinball Brothers on this episode.

[01:19] We're gonna cover off on a few news items, but then I wanna talk about the Pinball Brothers because when we look at Chicago Expo,

[01:25] this seems to be the only company that's gonna make an announcement.

[01:28] I think people forget, Stern Pinball does not make announcements at Chicago Expo.

[01:33] They do their own thing on their own time, they don't do it at the shows, they're not gonna wheel something new out there.

[01:38] They gotta sell Venom, that's the only thing on Stern's agenda right now.

[01:42] Like, they probably will sell these Jurassic Park, Cash Grab, 30th Anniversary editions,

[01:48] but then they gotta do something about these Venoms.

[01:50] We haven't really seen Stern have a game as weak as Venom since, what, like Black Knight?

[01:56] Since maybe like Led Zeppelin, it feels like that kind of game.

[02:00] I don't think it's gonna be like as despised as a game like Led Zeppelin,

[02:04] but I also just don't think people are gonna warm up to these prices for a game like that.

[02:09] We'll talk a little bit about that.

[02:11] And then I'm gonna do Canada's Collectors Corner.

[02:13] We're gonna go on to Pinside and we're gonna have to search for games that cost more.

[02:18] This is crazy when I say this.

[02:19] We're gonna have to search for games that cost more than $14,000

[02:24] to see what people are asking for certain titles that are absolutely targeting the collector community.

[02:30] Isn't that nuts to say?

[02:31] Because if I search for $13,000, like hundreds of games will come up, hundreds!

[02:38] And all of these new LEs, they're so easy to get and I don't consider any of them to be collectible.

[02:44] Alright, so let's cover off in a few couple news items.

[02:47] Stern Pinball is moving into its new factory and it is humongous.

[02:51] Have you seen this thing? It's huge!

[02:53] It's absolutely huge. It's absolutely beautiful. It's absolutely gorgeous.

[02:58] And when I saw this huge factory, I couldn't help but think,

[03:01] wow, a lot of pinball machines have to be made now to keep that factory line going.

[03:07] And this factory is much, much bigger than the old factory.

[03:12] And it begs the question, has the demand for pinball increased enough to warrant a factory that ginormous?

[03:19] I mean, it looks like Stern can maybe make like 800 to 1,000 games a week.

[03:24] Let's just say hypothetically, Stern Pinball can make 30 to 40,000 new pinball machines a year.

[03:31] I just don't see 30 to 40,000 people out there buying these games at these prices.

[03:38] There's no way to separate it anymore, right?

[03:40] Like, we used to be all excited when a new game would come out.

[03:43] We used to be excited when we would do factory tours and it's still exciting to a certain level.

[03:48] But the thing that just hangs over everything now is no matter what's going to happen in that factory,

[03:53] they're going to want $10,000 for a premium.

[03:55] No matter what happens in that factory, they're going to want $13,000 for an LE that does not come with a topper.

[04:02] No matter what happens in that factory, they're going to try to sell you a $2,000 topper to go on top of your $13,000 Stern machine.

[04:10] And all of a sudden, Stern has done the impossible.

[04:13] They took a price point that we all laughed at when they announced Batman SLE was $15,000.

[04:18] Remember the uproar?

[04:20] And now they're going to apply that to a game in which they're going to make 1,000 of them.

[04:26] 1,000 units.

[04:28] And I just don't think they're going to get away with it.

[04:31] And 2024 is really going to be the year in which we see if Stern's gamble pays off.

[04:36] Now, I know they also got something like a $50 million tax credit from Chicago to keep the factory there with all the workers.

[04:43] And I think Chicago as a city really has a lot of pride in the fact that Stern Pinball is there and it's the home of modern pinball manufacturing.

[04:52] So that's going to help stern out a lot.

[04:53] Now, wouldn't it be great if they passed those savings on to us?

[04:57] Right? They're fleecing us as customers.

[04:59] I don't think everybody's feeling this.

[05:01] I'm talking to everybody and it never goes away.

[05:04] What else is going on in the pinball news?

[05:05] I know there is a new code update for Galactic Tank Force.

[05:09] And in this code update, they think it's a good idea to put more clips of the employees over at American Pinball in the different cutscenes.

[05:17] They all dressed up in the spacesuits and they are part of the game.

[05:21] Why did they hire professional actors and actresses if they are then going to use Steve Bowden and Ryan McQuade?

[05:29] I don't think it works.

[05:30] I didn't like it in Godfather.

[05:32] I don't like it in Galactic Tank Force.

[05:34] If I could give every single company out there a very, very simple marketing advice,

[05:38] you might be able to use some of your employees for callouts if their voices work for the callouts.

[05:44] But what you should never do is put your employees into a game.

[05:49] Now, look, I understand that Galactic Tank Force is a campy theme.

[05:52] I understand that it's an original IP.

[05:54] So you can kind of get away with it in a game like that.

[05:57] There's no excuse to do it in a game like the Godfather.

[06:00] Okay. Now, look, here's the thing about Godfather.

[06:02] I'm seeing more and more people unbox their CEs.

[06:04] They are beautiful machines.

[06:06] I'm seeing people out there enjoy the game, which is good.

[06:09] I mean, you spent a lot of money on that game.

[06:12] I hope you do enjoy it.

[06:14] And I want to remind everybody the uproar around the Godfather is not about whether or not the game is fun.

[06:20] It's the same problem with Toy Story.

[06:23] The uproar around the Godfather is it's just not worth the money.

[06:28] And when you have these games that are 15k and games that are $12,000,

[06:33] people just are not seeing the value in the game because here's the sad part.

[06:37] If it is a great game, here's the sad part is that everybody who bought it early

[06:42] is going to lose a ton of money.

[06:44] It's not going to change the game, right?

[06:45] The value of the game will go up and down, but the game will be the game, right?

[06:49] The game's not going to change much.

[06:50] They're not going to do a major code update.

[06:52] When Jersey Jack ships a game, it's pretty much code complete.

[06:56] So the game stays what it is.

[06:58] I think people are seeing a game where they would want to spend like maybe $8,500 on the LE.

[07:03] And I think people would want to spend more like $12,500 on the collector's edition.

[07:08] Elon Musk is lowering the price of his electric cars.

[07:12] Ford is lowering the price of their F-150 Lightning.

[07:16] Why are major companies out there realizing if they've outpriced their market

[07:21] and they've outpriced their customers?

[07:23] The only way to get some of that market share back is if you lower the prices.

[07:28] A lot of prices went through the roof during COVID.

[07:31] Supply chain issues were difficult and people priced their products accordingly.

[07:35] So if we're seeing major institutions in other categories lower their prices,

[07:40] are we going to see a pinball company do the brave and the right thing and the responsible thing

[07:46] and actually lower their prices?

[07:49] Because now it's a price battle.

[07:50] It really is.

[07:51] I mean a spooky pinball machine fully loaded is $13,000.

[07:56] A stern pinball machine with all the bells and whistles with the top or with the accessories

[08:00] is around $15,000.

[08:02] At least Jersey Jack gives you everything.

[08:04] You don't have to add on the accessories.

[08:06] At least they give you like the topper and they go the extra mile.

[08:09] At least they give you a different play field for the collector's edition with all the gold sparkle.

[08:14] They at least make a major effort to separate the collector's edition from the LE.

[08:19] The problem is the LE is just too expensive now.

[08:21] Like it just feels like a second fiddle version and no one wants to spend $12,000 and feel like

[08:26] they're getting the second best version of something.

[08:28] So we're seeing more and more of those games unboxing.

[08:31] I'm curious to see where the market goes on Godfathers.

[08:34] I think it's just going to keep going south.

[08:36] The question is how fast will it go south?

[08:38] Are we going to see CEs trading for 14, 13, 5, 12, 5, any time this year?

[08:43] I think they are.

[08:44] I think when Steve Richie's game comes out, it's going to be like catching a falling knife

[08:48] on the value of these things.

[08:50] And I think Jersey Jack is just learning a lesson at these prices.

[08:54] You just need a triple A theme.

[08:56] Everybody wants this wasn't really a theme.

[08:58] People really want it.

[08:59] And I hear people in the pin side thread being like, I love the game.

[09:02] It's so much fun to shoot.

[09:04] I don't even like the movies.

[09:05] I don't even watch the movies.

[09:06] And it's like weird to me weird to me that people can get so into a pinball experience,

[09:10] regardless of the theme.

[09:12] See, I'm not like that.

[09:12] Like I kind of don't care to play themes.

[09:14] I don't care about and I sure as heck wouldn't buy a game.

[09:17] If I didn't love the theme, I just don't get it.

[09:20] All right.

[09:20] What else is going on before we talk about the pinball brothers?

[09:23] So look, there's a rumor that Stern might be working on Pokemon pinball.

[09:26] Now look, Pokemon is one of the biggest properties in the world.

[09:30] It's like, I think Pokemon is bigger than anything Disney has right now as an IP.

[09:34] It is bigger than Super Mario Brothers.

[09:36] But the real question is this, does Pokemon carry over into the pinball buying demographic?

[09:42] I think we all know the answer to that, even though it's a humongous property.

[09:47] I don't see the Pokemon fan base and the pinball fan base overlapping very much.

[09:53] And Pokemon people, they have their Pokemon go, they've got their video games.

[09:57] Pokemon lovers are really not used to spending like 12 to $15,000 on a pinball machine.

[10:05] Now there are Pokemon cards that are individually worth like hundreds of thousands,

[10:10] if not like a million dollars.

[10:12] But that's for the diehard Pokemon collector.

[10:16] No one's going to buy this machine as a Pokemon collectible.

[10:20] Now that being said, I would really, really love to see Stern pinball do something Japanese anime.

[10:26] I would love to see an Akira pinball machine.

[10:28] How about a Fist of the North Star?

[10:30] How about a Ghost in the Shell?

[10:31] I think there is a definite overlap between the pinball buying community

[10:36] and a lot of those anime movies that we grew up with in the 80s and 90s,

[10:40] and no one's going anywhere near them.

[10:42] Nowhere near them.

[10:43] I mean it when I say it.

[10:44] If somebody made an Akira pinball machine, it would sell way better than a game like Venom.

[10:51] It would sell way better than a game like Galactic Tank Force.

[10:54] It would sell way more units than a game like The Godfather.

[10:58] It just would.

[10:59] The cultural significance of Akira in America and in Japan, in the world.

[11:05] You talk to anybody.

[11:06] It still is held up as the gold standard of anime films that crossed over in America.

[11:13] See, I think like, you know, spooky pinball making a studio, Ghibli would make so much more sense

[11:18] than making a game like Ultraman.

[11:20] But that's just me.

[11:21] I just sort of love all things Japanese.

[11:23] And I think when it comes to pinball themes, I think we're getting a little tired of all the marvel.

[11:28] I think we're tired of all the music pins.

[11:30] I think we're tired of these like old man, cremaginy themes.

[11:34] There's a lot of stuff in the 90s and early 2000s we're not even looking at.

[11:38] All right, so let's talk about the pinball brothers for a minute.

[11:41] So the rumor is this.

[11:42] They are going to be at Pinball Expo and they are going to reveal their next game.

[11:46] They've done Aliens.

[11:47] They've done Queen Pinball.

[11:49] Both of those games were designed underneath Andrew Highway overseeing Highway Pinball.

[11:54] This will be the first game that the pinball brothers makes without any of Andrew Highway's inputs.

[11:59] I keep thinking about this because other than them, I don't think anyone's going to come to Expo with anything new.

[12:06] So I don't think it's a show where we're going to see a lot of new stuff.

[12:09] I don't think a lot of news is going to come out of the show.

[12:12] I don't know.

[12:12] Maybe Jerry will announce some modular thing for multi-morphics.

[12:16] So what?

[12:17] It's taking him forever to make those games.

[12:19] Maybe there will be a Haggis update on where the Fathom builds are at.

[12:23] I don't think he's going to finish those games by the end of the year.

[12:26] So the stage is open.

[12:27] The stage is open for somebody to make a move at Expo.

[12:31] I'm going to give you what I think is going to happen.

[12:33] I'm going to give you two things I think are going to happen at Expo.

[12:36] First, I think that mystery pinball company that I don't know what the game is.

[12:40] I don't know when it's coming out.

[12:41] But if I were them, I would really be eyeballing Expo as a moment to reveal.

[12:47] I think it's the perfect time for them.

[12:49] I don't know what the game is.

[12:50] I don't think it's a remake.

[12:51] I think it's going to be an all-new pinball machine.

[12:54] It's probably going to have a license attached to it because I can't see anybody putting the effort in on an original IP game that wouldn't work.

[13:02] And I think the stage is set up perfectly for this company because there's nothing else.

[13:07] Like Venom is DOA.

[13:09] Godfather sales are flatlined.

[13:11] You've got everybody who ordered a Pulp Fiction is going to be waiting.

[13:14] I mean, can we just talk for 10 seconds about CGC manufacturing?

[13:18] It just feels like we never have any line of sight into how many games they're making.

[13:22] But man, they must have got a couple thousand orders for Pulp Fiction.

[13:26] I feel like people are going to be waiting for those games forever.

[13:29] There's really nothing.

[13:30] There's nothing.

[13:31] And you know this.

[13:32] People have a little bit of money burning a hole in their pocket.

[13:36] And if this mystery company can come out with a game that really feels like it's giving you your bang for the buck,

[13:42] I think it would be the perfect time to show it at Pinball Expo in October.

[13:47] Now, I won't be able to go to Expo this year.

[13:49] I was looking at the calendar.

[13:50] The reason why I can't go is I'm going to be traveling the week before.

[13:54] Unfortunately, my friend that passed away, her parents are having a celebration of her life in Los Angeles.

[14:01] So I will be in the Los Angeles area the weekend of October 14th.

[14:07] So if you're in LA and you want to hang out with Canada for a little bit or swing by and have a beer with Canada at the hotel,

[14:13] I would love to see you.

[14:14] I'm going to try to meet up with some of you.

[14:16] That's going to be a real sombering event for me.

[14:18] She was one of my best friends.

[14:20] I'm going to be away from Brenda and Killian too long.

[14:23] So I don't want to then go the next weekend to Pinball Expo.

[14:26] It's just too much to ask of Brenda.

[14:27] And I really want to be there for my family.

[14:29] And I love just hanging out with my family on the weekends.

[14:32] Even though it's tiring, I'm never going to get these years back.

[14:34] I mean, I love the age Killian is at right now.

[14:37] It's such an amazing time.

[14:38] All right.

[14:39] So that is the mystery game and the window that's open for them.

[14:42] Then we've got the Pinball Brothers who are saying they're going to reveal their next game.

[14:46] And it got me thinking, here's what I think is going to happen.

[14:48] I don't think that Pinball Brothers are going to release a new game.

[14:51] I think they're going to announce a partnership with Rick and Planetary.

[14:56] I think they will announce that.

[14:57] And I think they are going to announce that they will be making a remake of a classic Pinball machine.

[15:03] I think the two games that are the most speculated will be Big Bang Bar.

[15:08] Or it's going to be Twilight Zone.

[15:10] I think it's one of those two games.

[15:12] It could be another remake game.

[15:13] It's going to be something that Rick has the IP for.

[15:17] I just don't see the Pinball Brothers designing a game from the ground up with who?

[15:22] Like who would be the designer?

[15:23] What would the license be?

[15:25] I don't know.

[15:25] I just feel like these guys, they've got Padready Gaming making their product.

[15:30] They've got the manufacturing figured out.

[15:33] And I think they now need to just release a sure thing.

[15:37] I don't think Queen has sold very well.

[15:39] In fact, I know Queen has not sold very well.

[15:43] I don't know what their expectations were.

[15:44] I have a hard time imagining a thousand Queen Pinball machines have sold.

[15:48] Maybe I'm wrong.

[15:49] Maybe they can reveal their numbers.

[15:51] Nobody reveals their numbers.

[15:53] But I'm just not seeing a ton of Queen Pinball machines being unboxed.

[15:56] And I think they're going to go remake something.

[15:59] And I don't know how the Pinball world is going to respond to that.

[16:03] You could always sell more Twilight Zones.

[16:06] You could always sell more Big Bang Bars.

[16:09] I don't know.

[16:09] I don't know if it's going to work.

[16:10] And I don't know if people are going to run to it.

[16:12] And I don't know if the game is going to be ready for the line.

[16:14] Because I still think all of us right now, and I said it on my last show,

[16:18] we're kind of just all waiting to see what Keith Elwyn does.

[16:21] Why wouldn't you just wait?

[16:23] Everything else is just going to either hold value or go down in value.

[16:27] So that's what I think is going to happen from the Pinball brothers.

[16:30] All right.

[16:30] Let's go to this pin side marketplace right now.

[16:33] I'm going to do my Canatus collectors corner.

[16:35] I put in over $14,000.

[16:37] Let's talk about what people are trying to sell right now.

[16:40] Now, some people are trying to sell Foo Fighters LE for over $13,000,

[16:44] which makes no sense because you can actually go get a Foo Fighters LE right now.

[16:49] $12,500 new in box.

[16:50] So I don't understand these people are like $14,000, $7,500 firm,

[16:54] a game that someone is selling for $2,000 less.

[16:57] There's a Stranger Things LE for $14,000, $2,000, and that sounds like a great price

[17:02] until you realize it's a routed machine that's been beat on.

[17:06] Wow.

[17:07] Who would have guessed that a beaten up, routed, Stranger Things LE would be $14,000 in 2023?

[17:15] Also, who would route a Stranger Things LE?

[17:18] You dope.

[17:19] Why wouldn't you just route a premium?

[17:22] It makes absolutely no sense to put an LE on location.

[17:26] I never understand that.

[17:28] The premium is the same exact game.

[17:30] In fact, the premium is designed to be out on location for someone who wants a fully featured

[17:36] game but doesn't want to pay a premium.

[17:39] Think about how silly it is because if you put an LE on location,

[17:42] that game has to be played 3,000 times more than the premium does to earn you back money.

[17:48] It makes no sense.

[17:50] There's a Godfather Collector's Edition for $14,000.

[17:53] I wouldn't go anywhere near Godfather's CE right now.

[17:56] I would just wait it out.

[17:58] I think we're going to see Godfather go into the 13s real soon.

[18:02] Here's a great one.

[18:03] A Bonsai Run $19,995.

[18:07] It's fully restored.

[18:09] A Bonsai Run for $20,000?

[18:12] A few years ago, if you said that, someone would be like,

[18:14] well, there must be $15,000 in the coin box.

[18:18] I wouldn't go anywhere near that.

[18:19] This is my favorite one.

[18:20] There's a Venom LE for sale and it's not Canada.

[18:23] It's in America.

[18:24] Someone's trying to sell a Venom LE for $15,000.

[18:28] Ladies and gentlemen, can we give a round of applause to the gentlemen out there in the

[18:32] world from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who's trying to sell a Venom for $2,000 more than a game they

[18:40] can't even give away for $13,000.

[18:42] All right, Pirates of the Caribbean Collector's Edition.

[18:45] Now, these things always pop up.

[18:47] I know there's hardly any of them out there, but they always seem for sale.

[18:52] This one is for sale for $34,000 or best offer.

[18:56] Wow.

[18:57] Now, look, Pirates CE, Pirates LE, they're always around that like $20,000 range,

[19:03] $30,000 range at the height of COVID.

[19:07] A new in-box one sold for $40,000.

[19:11] Now, look, do I think this game is worth that?

[19:14] Now, look, in the world of collectibles, I do think they are not going to make more pirates

[19:19] now.

[19:19] I think Jersey Jack Pinball, if they were going to do it, they would have done it by now,

[19:24] is my feeling.

[19:25] So, you know, I always feel like Pirates is going to have a special place in a high-end

[19:30] Pinball Collector's game room just because there's not many of them.

[19:34] The CE is a beautiful machine.

[19:37] Do I think it's worth $34,000?

[19:41] I don't.

[19:41] I don't think these things are moving around that price.

[19:44] It says or best offer.

[19:45] I think you could probably get one for high 20s at this point.

[19:49] You might as well see if they bite.

[19:51] There's a bunch of James Bond 60th Machines for sale.

[19:54] They're selling for around 15K, 13K, 14K.

[19:58] That's kind of where this game is netting out.

[20:00] I think if you wait a little bit, I think once Elwyn's next game comes out,

[20:04] I think this James Bond is going to keep going down in value.

[20:08] I think the basement for a James Bond 007 60th price, I think it's going to end up between

[20:13] $10,000 and $12,000.

[20:15] Because look, people who own these are going to get tired of owning them eventually.

[20:19] Only the super die-hard James Bond collectors like Neil McCrae are going to hold on to them.

[20:25] I don't think there's 500 of those kinds of collectors out there.

[20:28] All right, what else we got here?

[20:29] $20,000 Medieval Madness Royal Edition.

[20:32] I don't know.

[20:33] I wouldn't pay twice the price that game was brand new.

[20:36] If you really need the Royal Edition, sure.

[20:39] Is it going to change the game for you?

[20:41] No.

[20:41] Is there a high likelihood that Chicago Gaming Company makes another medieval madness down the road?

[20:47] Yes, there is.

[20:48] So I wouldn't go anywhere near that.

[20:50] An Elvira House of Horrors Limited Edition.

[20:53] This is interesting.

[20:54] It's not too bad.

[20:55] A limited edition.

[20:56] I think there was only like 50 of these.

[20:59] I actually thought this was the signature edition that had the couch.

[21:03] But no, this was the Ellie.

[21:05] So this was one where I think they made 500 of them.

[21:08] They want $14,500 for this game.

[21:12] I mean, I don't know.

[21:13] Here's the thing about Elvira.

[21:14] Like if you're going to spend $14,500 and you got that much cheddar,

[21:18] I would want to have the nicest version of Elvira.

[21:22] I think you could get the 40th anniversary edition for like $18,000.

[21:25] And I know these numbers are bonkers, people.

[21:28] But if I'm going to spend like $14,500, I don't want to have like the third nicest version of the game.

[21:34] It's just too much money.

[21:35] So I wouldn't go anywhere near this.

[21:37] The only Elvira I would buy for over $12,000 would be the 40th.

[21:42] And I think those games are going to come down in price as well.

[21:45] Here's a Pire to the Caribbean LE that has a sale pending for $22,000.

[21:51] Well, that's still $10,000 less than the Collector's Edition.

[21:56] Remember, the Collector's Edition was only $2,500 more.

[22:00] All right, what else we got here?

[22:01] Now, a Batman Super LE.

[22:03] This made me excited at Batman SLE.

[22:06] These don't pop up for sale very often.

[22:08] Sold, ladies and gentlemen, sale pending.

[22:10] And it was listed at $35,000 or best offer.

[22:14] Now, I wonder what the best offer was.

[22:16] These have been selling recently for over $30,000.

[22:21] And with only 80 of them out there, you understand why.

[22:24] It still feels like the only one where from head to toe Stern really went the extra mile on the game.

[22:32] Look, I'm just going to say this.

[22:33] And I know I bought one for $25,000.

[22:35] I think Batman Super LE could be the first Stern machine where we start to see a trading hand

[22:40] a few years from now for $40,000.

[22:43] Or the market's going to collapse.

[22:45] And we're going to see these things trading for like $20,000.

[22:47] And I'm going to lose $5,000.

[22:49] All right, a James Bond 60th.

[22:51] That has never left our showroom.

[22:53] Wow, it automated services.

[22:54] It's never left the showroom and it's $16,000.

[22:58] Nope, because you can go get a new unbox one for like $15,500 right now.

[23:01] A Pirates LE for $22,500 firm.

[23:04] Here's a funny one.

[23:05] A Toy Story CE for $16,500 firm.

[23:09] How do you offer and it's unboxed?

[23:11] How do you offer a game that is not selling for anywhere near that for thousands over?

[23:17] Like are people trolling us?

[23:19] Here's a goodbye.

[23:19] There's a Godzilla LE for $14,300.

[23:22] I can't believe I'm saying that's a goodbye.

[23:24] This guy's making about almost $4,000 in profit.

[23:27] But here's the reason why I think we're going to see a lot of Godzilla's go up for sale.

[23:31] You know, people need to make room for the next Keith Elwyn machine.

[23:35] And you've been playing Godzilla for two years.

[23:37] You've been enjoying it.

[23:38] But I think a lot of people are going to want the latest and the greatest.

[23:42] And that's the big thing with all of this right now is everybody needs to clear up some space.

[23:46] And the only way to clear up space is to sell a game.

[23:49] And we're not seeing games move that quickly anymore.

[23:52] And everyone's going to have to come back down to reality.

[23:56] Like it's okay to make a couple thousand dollars profit on a two year old machine.

[24:01] Should you be making a $4,000 profit or $5,000 profit?

[24:05] I mean, bless if you can get it.

[24:07] Like here's a kids LE for $17,500.

[24:10] Wow, $17,500.

[24:11] A Ghostbusters LE for $22,500.

[24:14] I need to stop looking at all these super high end expensive pinball machines.

[24:19] It actually puts me in a bad mood for some reason.

[24:21] I don't know. It's just kind of deflating.

[24:22] It's not really like a bad mood.

[24:23] I'm just deflated that the hobby turned into this.

[24:26] Like it's just sad to me.

[24:28] You know, you go back like just a few years, a game would come out.

[24:32] And if it was good, it went up a thousand or $2,000.

[24:35] And people were fine like paying the scalper price for the machine.

[24:39] Now everyone's tacked on $10,000, like $10,000.

[24:44] Ghostbusters LE was originally $7,500.

[24:48] And you used to be able to get it used easily for like $8,000 to $9,000 for a few years.

[24:54] What happened to that $8,000 to $9,000 machine?

[24:57] Why is it $22,000 now?

[24:59] It's the same game. I just don't get it.

[25:01] I get it. There's a cheap topper.

[25:03] I get it. There's the Ecto1 topper.

[25:04] How much is that worth? $5,000?

[25:06] Oh, it's exhausting.

[25:08] It's a beautiful sunny day.

[25:09] I'm going to go outside.

[25:11] I'm going to go meet a friend for lunch and go see a movie.

[25:14] Everybody, I will be back next Saturday.

[25:16] I'm not sure if I'm going to do Saturdays every Saturday.

[25:18] We'll see how I feel.

[25:20] I enjoy doing it.

[25:21] I'm an imperfect human being just looking for the right balance in life.

[25:25] And sometimes things get out of balance.

[25:27] Sometimes I start reacting and acting in a way I don't like.

[25:31] And I just need a break and a pause.

[25:33] Who amongst you out there doesn't go through that in your life.

[25:36] So I appreciate you sticking around.

[25:38] We've got a lot of club members here.

[25:40] There wasn't this mass exodus like people were predicting.

[25:42] So I'm super thankful for each and every one of you for sticking around.

[25:46] Lots more great shows coming.

[25:47] Canada out.
