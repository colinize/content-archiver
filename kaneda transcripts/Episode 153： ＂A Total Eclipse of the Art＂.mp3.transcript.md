[00:00] Ever now I'm in a full of fun

[00:05] Ever now I'm in a full of fun

[00:08] And I need you now tonight

[00:12] And I need you more than ever

[00:22] Welcome to episode 153 of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:26] And I have to let you guys know

[00:27] I'm in the best mood I've been in in almost nine years

[00:32] And I'll explain why

[00:33] I've been chasing a feeling that I haven't felt since I did my guns and roses

[00:39] Dr. Pepper campaign and for those of you out there you know I work in marketing

[00:43] It's what I do on a daily basis when I'm not reading

[00:46] Pinside or trolling the Aussie arcade forums

[00:49] I spend my days trying to help brands do things that get them into the news cycle

[00:55] It's never easy and I'll tell you why it's not easy

[00:59] Because when you have a dream and you have an idea and you need to convince someone else to go along with your vision

[01:06] It's really really difficult

[01:08] It's even more difficult to get them to put money behind your idea and to ultimately execute it

[01:15] Okay

[01:16] Now the reason why you heard Bonnie Tyler's totally clips of the heart

[01:22] Introing this edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast is on Wednesday of this week

[01:28] My client Royal Caribbean executed an idea I had that I brought to them eight months ago

[01:34] And the idea was very simple on the day that the total solar eclipse happens in America

[01:40] We should have Bonnie Tyler on board our ship singing the song total eclipse of the heart

[01:47] That was it super simple

[01:49] One sentence idea if you Google search for it. You'll see it's gone everywhere

[01:53] Maybe you guys have seen it on the news

[01:56] But I'm just really really elated because when sometimes when your personal life or your professional life

[02:02] Does something amazing it sort of puts everything into a different perspective and I got to be honest

[02:08] Getting all bent out of shape about pinball issues and topics

[02:13] Was the last thing that's been on my mind this week. We've been celebrating

[02:17] We've been poppin champagne. We're going out again tonight to celebrate with the team

[02:22] Really really incredible week for me

[02:24] So I wanted to just tell you guys that's what I do if you want to know what I do for a living

[02:28] That's what I do I try to do this and these kinds of lightning in the moment it like moments

[02:35] It happens maybe once in a career and and I'm just elated that we got a client like Royal Caribbean to go on board for this

[02:42] So that being said, I'm not gonna go more off on that

[02:47] But I want to talk about total nuclear annihilation stream that happened last night

[02:52] There's not much else going on in the pinball world in terms of news. There's a few news items

[02:58] We're gonna cover them on this show

[03:01] I want to say this

[03:02] People I've been getting some like

[03:04] Criticisms that this podcast is going too long in this and that and I'm like what I think I kind of along with Nate

[03:13] Had the shortest pinball podcasts that are out there these other ones they go two hours long and plus

[03:20] We're normally up around an hour. We're not gonna take that long today because I got to get to work early today

[03:26] Um, but I want to say like I don't think this podcast is too long to you

[03:30] And the other point I got from people is that I I

[03:33] I harp on a point and I go on and on about a subject that I know just make my point and move on and I think anyone who pinball podcasts will tell you this

[03:42] You can't just make like one point and then move on. I'll tell you why because there's not enough to move on to

[03:48] Pinball news isn't like I'm covering what's going on in the world today

[03:52] I'm covering what's going on in the world of pinball

[03:55] There's just not enough news every week

[03:59] Unless you do what I do which is I editorialize and I give you my opinion

[04:03] I bring on guests to the show and we get their opinions

[04:07] It's a show. It's my show if you don't want to listen to my take on the pinball hobby

[04:14] There's plenty of other shows out there, but I do appreciate all of you who do listen whether you like me or not

[04:20] I do appreciate each and every one of you for tuning in weekly. Okay, so let me talk about this dead flip stream

[04:26] And and I have to say I really do appreciate that these guys do all the work and all the effort to stream these games

[04:34] I have always felt like streaming people playing pinball for hours is a little bit

[04:42] Tant amount to watching paint dry at times and I'll explain why because most of the times we tune into these streams

[04:49] There's certain things and elements about the game we want to see we why do we have to wait two hours

[04:56] To see the death star blow up when they did the star wars stream right two hours

[05:02] It's it's fun though going into the twitch stream with jack danger and and crew and and reading the comments

[05:09] But I'll say this it gets a little old after like a half hour

[05:13] And just like can we just see the features of the game can they just take the glass off and can the designer

[05:18] Just show us what the rule set is and and what happens in the game

[05:22] I wish they would just do that instead of

[05:25] Making us watch four guys play against each other

[05:28] Maybe they'll get to the stuff we want to see maybe they won't maybe takes forever

[05:33] Um, but my god nobody nobody really cares to see the jet sends pinball

[05:40] I can't believe I was at work the stream started it was about six o'clock eastern time

[05:46] About an hour and a half later. I went home and I was like I'm gonna watch tna and I'm gonna

[05:52] I'm gonna watch it record it and I'm gonna do a podcast last night

[05:56] And I'll be able to watch about a half hour of tna I get back home after like an hour and a half

[06:02] And they're still playing the jet sends what

[06:06] T f

[06:08] Nobody wants to see in hour and a half of a game where the

[06:13] Basic thing you do is just spell the names of the characters. It's a kids game

[06:19] It's but in hour and a half so okay, so for those of you we all had to suffer through that

[06:26] Everybody wanted to see tna we wanted to see scott denies his game total nuclear annihilation

[06:32] We had not seen the animations before

[06:35] We had not see the game being played with the new artwork with all the lights going with the sound going

[06:41] So I'm gonna say look the fact that jet sends and the total nuclear annihilation is the same price is

[06:49] Absolutely laughable

[06:51] I know the jet sends is supposed to be sort of this starter machine for

[06:57] Families and it's sold by the pinball company and it wasn't really designed by spooky

[07:01] It was just manufactured by them and I get that

[07:04] But why would spooky give so much real estate and airtime to show a game that's so damn basic

[07:11] You could show the jet sends off in 20 minutes and you can move on

[07:14] So I just felt pain watching that and no one cared so tna is the game we all care about

[07:21] And I have to say after talking to scott after seeing the game

[07:25] I have to just say I was really really

[07:30] Impressed with total nuclear annihilation now. I'll tell you why I'm impressed with the game

[07:35] Because I think you have to look at total nuclear annihilation a little bit differently than you look at other pinball machines

[07:42] first and foremost

[07:44] Total nuclear annihilation cannot it cannot disappoint you

[07:49] In the realm of theme integration because it scots original theme

[07:54] It's not based on anything you know

[07:56] It's not based on a movie or tv show and so you don't bring to the game

[08:01] You're preconceived notions of what that universe should look like under glass right?

[08:05] So there's none of that there is absolutely none of that

[08:08] So you don't have that sort of disappointment and again, I think coming from Star Wars to this

[08:14] I think that's important

[08:15] I think it's it's it's nice to have an original game same thing with dialed in right no one looks at dialed in and says

[08:21] Well, this isn't the dialed in world. I grew up with as a kid. No

[08:25] You're able to look at it a little bit more

[08:28] Objectively, I'll say without subjective emotions playing a factor. Okay

[08:33] So

[08:34] The sound is fucking incredible

[08:37] It's incredible. I mean the game sounds super freaking cool

[08:40] It's just really really cool and I think when you hear this game next to other pinball machines

[08:46] It's embarrassing when and I said this in the in the comment section when you hear how good this game sounds next to

[08:55] A $9,000 stern. It's also a little bit embarrassing. It's just the quality of the sound the quality of the music

[09:02] Scott has made this soundtrack really kickass

[09:06] So I think the sound 10 out of 10 it's freaking cool

[09:10] The light shows amazing. I mean we've all we've all known this from the whitewood

[09:14] I love that Scott was wearing a t-shirt that said you had me at the whitewood on the back of the total nuclear annihilation t-shirt

[09:21] The light shows amazing the full RGB LEDs

[09:25] You don't get that in games costing a lot more from other manufacturers very very cool

[09:31] The game played stuff you know look

[09:33] I I think you have to ask yourself is this the kind of gameplay for me?

[09:39] What what is my opinion on the gameplay? Yeah, like I think it looks a little bit

[09:45] repetitive but not

[09:48] Like it's okay. This is where I get like I'm choosing my words carefully because every pinball game is kind of competitive

[09:57] There's yeah, there's not the things that I typically love to see in games which are bash toys and

[10:03] Magnets and and rams and you know, I like a crowded world under glass

[10:08] It's not that it's pinball

[10:11] It's pinball at possibly it's purest form

[10:14] Which is the ball moving around and you having to hit shots, okay?

[10:19] and

[10:20] Because of that I kind of love it that is just a pinball game

[10:25] That's based on a very simple theme and the thing I love the most about it

[10:30] Is that you can explain to people how to play the game

[10:33] When Jack was explaining the game I kind of knew what to do immediately

[10:39] That's how pinball should be

[10:41] hit the genie

[10:43] Start the mode hit the two blinking lights

[10:47] Finish and collect the jewel get six jewels to battle the genie that's it

[10:52] That is it

[10:53] It is embarrassing when you try to explain to somebody what to do and how to play star wars how to play game of thrones how to play these new stirns

[11:03] I think it's embarrassing what I love about total nuclear annihilation is you can understand it

[11:09] And because of that you can get four dudes in a room

[11:14] Who might have different degrees of pinball skill and I think it evens the playing field because the game is fast

[11:21] The game is brutal the game is difficult

[11:23] Nobody is gonna have half hour ball times on this game and that's good

[11:29] That's a good thing. It's it breaks up the monotony of what other pinball machines bring and you know

[11:36] I've heard people like oric say it. I've heard other people on the thread say it

[11:40] I think people need to think rethink what can be a pinball machine

[11:46] I think we're stuck in this cookie cutter land of

[11:49] Of old designers with the same old ideas making the same games over and over again

[11:55] And they either run out of ideas or they just approach it the same way

[12:00] All the time with subtle differences

[12:03] But they're afraid to create original themes. They're afraid to try new things

[12:08] They're afraid to think about what what a pinball machine could be

[12:12] So for that for that and that reason alone

[12:16] Total nuclear annihilation gets my endorsement

[12:20] I don't look I don't think the I think they could have done more with the art that doesn't matter

[12:25] It doesn't matter. I'm not I'm not like this. This isn't this isn't canada's art podcast

[12:31] This isn't canada's museum quality on an on a pinball machine podcast. This isn't canada's pinball podcast

[12:39] So I'm really happy for Scott and I'm really happy for the crew over there

[12:42] And I know he give Charlie shit because I always think Charlie leaves money on the table

[12:46] And I think he does at times

[12:48] But I also love the fact that these these guys are having fun and ask yourself one question all of you out there

[12:54] If you had to take a job with one pinball company who would it be if you said you want to really enjoy going in every day

[13:02] All right, I mean how could you not pick spooky? I think the next one would be JJP

[13:09] I and look the but the mood at JJP is has changed but only recently

[13:14] I mean that was a stressful mother fucking place to go into

[13:17] When hobbits were delayed and wases were delayed and they had like money issues

[13:21] The mood over there now after dialed in much different mood much different vibe

[13:26] You can you can see it on jack's face

[13:28] You can you can feel it when you talk to him the company has done a 180 and pat lawler help them get there

[13:33] And that's it's an exciting place would you want to go in every day and work at Stern?

[13:37] I don't know I don't know part of me feels like if you had a great idea at Stern

[13:43] It would run up the ladder and ultimately it would land on some bean counters desk who would yank it out because

[13:49] They would think they don't need to do that to make the profit. I think Stern is I do I think they're a little bit more profit driven

[13:57] Than passion driven and I don't I'm not saying they're like 90% profit 10% passion

[14:02] I'm not saying that for for the love of God people. I still love Stern pinball

[14:07] I love that Stern pinball exists. I love

[14:12] What Stern has in the works. I think Stern had a few misses recently

[14:17] I think Stern had some terrible marketing launches this year and then the last year

[14:21] I think Stern has made new hires with Zach Sharp to hopefully improve that

[14:26] Um, I'll tell you this if I was doing Stern marketing

[14:29] Be knocking out of the park

[14:31] You know fucking fun it is to market a product that has a built-in fan base

[14:37] See that's always the challenge in my job

[14:40] When you get handed a product people don't like good luck getting them excited

[14:44] But when you have something people are excited about

[14:47] Then you can do the best marketing imaginable because it's more about holding information back

[14:53] It's more about doing sometimes stunty little things to get the community excited

[14:58] It's more about putting elements onto the game that will make the LEDs really shine. So that's marketing

[15:03] The early is a 100% marketing device

[15:07] It's not necessary

[15:10] The LEDs are all about doing something that becomes a halo for the company right the Dodge demon is a halo for Dodge

[15:18] They're only going to sell 3,300 right they need to sell more like

[15:24] Jeep compasses than that to stay in business as a company. It's a halo product

[15:29] The Stern super at least in the LEDs that is where marketing really needs to come in and make these products better

[15:34] All right

[15:35] And sometimes like invest in your products more and that's my message for Stern

[15:39] I think they they didn't get away with it this time

[15:43] All right other news though

[15:44] Congratulations Scott spooky guys congrats really I'm happy for you

[15:48] I was happy to see it looks like they're on batch number four

[15:52] So that means they're into the realm of past 150 games

[15:56] I know that it's the second best selling spooky game of all time

[16:00] Uh

[16:01] Which obviously means that rob zombies number one and america's most haunted. It's it's eclipsed america's most haunted

[16:07] All right, it is kind of though this puts everything in perspective though as awesome as that is as awesome as that is

[16:14] Remember one thing

[16:16] Stern makes 50 games a day a day

[16:21] So in three days

[16:24] Stern will eclipse this I'm gonna use a clip so the time this is the totally clips podcast

[16:28] Stern will eclipse that in three days of making games and in in one week

[16:33] They've made what spooky might have made for all of rob zombie right? It's crazy

[16:39] It's crazy that doesn't mean that that volume equals a better game

[16:43] But it's just nuts to think that's you know stern is just a juggernaut when you look at it like that you realize

[16:49] How much of the market they really do have and none of these guys

[16:53] I the spooky level is is even any competition for them

[16:58] Um, and that's that's a bad thing. It is a bad thing. I think I think it's it makes them a little bit lazy at times

[17:03] All right, so Star Wars Ellie is shipping

[17:06] And that's that you know look we're happy

[17:09] Once again stern has delivered on their promise to get people their games in in a timely manner

[17:15] You know Star Wars was announced in what was it early June? Okay, so people are getting games just

[17:21] Month and a half two months later that's great. That is really great news

[17:25] I mean we have to congratulate Stern

[17:27] for

[17:28] Announcing games and shipping games and getting people their games. I haven't seen a lot of issues with the game there is

[17:36] There are there's a thread on pin side where people are talking about some

[17:40] Issues they might be having with the game. I think some that I saw where the the ball has a tendency sometimes the fail inside the hyper loop

[17:48] Which causes it to slow down which causes the ball to slowly

[17:51] Just you know move towards the front near the flippers and fall out of the hyper loop

[17:55] So it's gonna be interesting to see how this hyper loop holds up over time

[18:01] because

[18:02] If it slows down will that make the thing not work correctly

[18:08] And how do you keep it working at that speed won't the magnets wear over time won't that mechanism?

[18:15] um

[18:16] Naturally create sort of a little less speed so we'll see we'll see but look

[18:21] I've said my piece on Star Wars if you guys

[18:24] If you want to hear me complain about Star Wars going they all see arcade form but I but I look and if you guys want it go buy it

[18:31] If you want it go buy it. I just have never seen a theme this popular. I've never seen so many people

[18:39] Back out of their Ellie and and they look I just think the Ellie this time around stands for loser edition

[18:46] And by that I mean you're losing all the features that are supposed to be in an Ellie

[18:52] So if you want to be a loser and spend that much money more on the Ellie then god bless you

[18:58] I would love to have

[19:00] $1,500 to burn

[19:03] And look the age old argument from all these collectors will always be the same

[19:07] It makes me happy and you know what you're right. It doesn't matter what I say

[19:13] It doesn't matter. It's your money. I mean I can go buy a pair of shoes

[19:18] That cost as much as the Ellie upgrade. Yes in New York City

[19:22] You can go buy $1,500 shoes and some people most people would think you're a loser and an idiot for doing that

[19:31] But that's how that makes some people happy

[19:34] So let's do this in a world where there's all this terrorists and all this negative news and and and these white supremacists

[19:42] Assholes and these political idiots who are who are defending close mind-it-ness and racism and ignorance in a world

[19:50] We live in now we need to all of us

[19:54] side on the air of happiness and love and positivity at times right this

[20:02] To get really negative and down and out on pinball is absolutely idiotic

[20:06] I'm glad that we have pinball

[20:09] I'm glad that we have this little corner of the universe to talk about and to geek out over and yes to get passionate about

[20:17] And and and to discuss things and debate things because at the end of the day

[20:21] We're all united and this this is a friendly hobby. This is a friendly community and

[20:29] The world needs more people to be friendly or to each other and and I know I'm going off on a little bit of an outside tangent rant

[20:36] But it's just I don't know about you guys. I've just been feeling such a mix of emotions of

[20:43] fatigued and

[20:45] anxiety and and this lack of enthusiasm for living in the best country in the world the lack of enthusiasm for

[20:54] Reading the news every day and seeing what's going on out there and and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it

[21:00] I mean I I was raised to

[21:03] Treat everybody with respect treat people the way you want to be treated and ultimately work hard for yourself

[21:09] and and keep you deserve to keep the money you earn

[21:12] I have a little bit of like a like imagine I and Rand Atlas shrug but actually with a little bit of a heart

[21:18] right? I'm very socially liberal and very fiscally conservative

[21:22] Um, and that's just the way I was raised and and I but I just

[21:27] I'm really happy we have pinball and I'm happy pinball is heading into a period where there's a lot of excitement coming on

[21:34] There's a lot of fun pinball podcasts that are out there. There's a lot of new games happening

[21:39] I saw Mike from home pin is going to put two thunderbirds on a boat and we're gonna see them soon

[21:45] Uh for national thunderbirds day now in America national thunderbirds day is celebrated by one person

[21:52] Um every year hilton has a thunderbirds

[21:55] Celebration in his in his in his Subaru. He goes for a ride

[21:59] He puts on the thunderbird soundtrack and he fucking he just fucking does donuts man

[22:03] Drifts around corners and he fucking goes nuts and you know what? I fucking love that about the guy

[22:09] He's fucking crazy, but in a good way

[22:12] Um, so hilton do not do not let uh, you know all the negative news keep you from celebrating national thunderbirds day in America this year because

[22:21] Because someone has to um
