[00:00] Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick.

[00:06] You came by happiness, you can buy me.

[00:12] I'm sorry.

[00:15] You know money can't buy happiness, but you know what money can buy you?

[00:25] A $61,000 magic girl.

[00:29] My friends over in the Netherlands, they repaired magic girl.

[00:33] They took the John Papadude machine and they spent three years fixing the code, getting

[00:38] those mechanisms to work.

[00:40] And that's cool and all.

[00:41] And we were all really excited to see this game sort of wake up a little bit.

[00:45] It still shoots like a dog.

[00:47] But now they are selling one.

[00:49] Get ready for it.

[00:50] For $61,000.

[00:52] And I think at this point, we all just need to put a pin in magic girl.

[00:57] It is not a good pinball machine.

[00:59] It doesn't matter what you do to a magic girl.

[01:02] It is never worth $61,000.

[01:06] But that's the new pinball landscape.

[01:08] All you got to find is one really rich fool in Europe.

[01:13] And he will think that he's holding on to something special.

[01:16] But as someone who's played magic girl and I know I haven't played this new version

[01:19] of it, there is no way any pinball machine on planet earth should ever be worth.

[01:26] $61,000, especially a machine that came from John Papadude.

[01:31] So here's what I'm going to do on episode 631.

[01:34] I'm going to give you all of the rumors I know so far.

[01:37] And there are a lot of rumors floating around the pinball world.

[01:41] Some of them I feel really good about.

[01:43] Some of them I'm almost ready to call confirmations.

[01:46] Now, the reason I'm going to say rumors on most of these.

[01:50] If I haven't physically seen something, right?

[01:52] If I'm not staring at the Deadpool whitewood, which I used to or the Guns and Roses whitewood

[01:58] or the Ghostbusters Translate.

[02:00] If I'm not staring at something that is 100% proof, then it's still just a rumor.

[02:06] But some of these are going to happen.

[02:08] And so on this episode, let me go down what I'm hearing is happening at each manufacturer.

[02:14] And we'll start with Stern.

[02:15] Now Stern pinball, the next game is Rush.

[02:18] It's all but confirmed.

[02:20] It's going to happen.

[02:21] John Borg Rush is coming out.

[02:24] It will most likely be shown the week of December 21st.

[02:28] So mark your calendars in just a couple of weeks.

[02:32] We're going to get that really poorly put together.

[02:35] Stern teaser that probably has like a Rush song.

[02:39] Probably not.

[02:40] It's probably not even going to have a Rush song because maybe they don't have the rights

[02:43] to aired on YouTube.

[02:44] Who knows.

[02:45] But there will be like a Stern pinball that goes around a pentagram and it's Rush pinball

[02:49] coming soon.

[02:50] And then a week later, we will get crappy cell phone photos of the game because Stern will

[02:55] show the game to its distributors on a webinar.

[02:59] And that is how the first photos will arrive in the world.

[03:02] It happens every single time.

[03:04] But that is coming John Borg's Rush.

[03:07] Now I'm also here to tell you the next game from Stern pinball is going to be Brian Eddie

[03:11] and Zambietti doing a Marvel comic book edition of Venom.

[03:16] This is also happening.

[03:18] I haven't seen it.

[03:19] So yes, it's technically still a rumor.

[03:21] But once again, Kaneda is going to be right.

[03:23] It is Venom.

[03:24] I heard Zack many on the pinball show talk about it and it was what he was referring to.

[03:31] And Zack knows more than me.

[03:32] He does.

[03:33] He just can't say it.

[03:34] But once Kaneda says it, then Zack can report on the rumor.

[03:39] And Craig Bobby, thank you for giving me a shout out.

[03:42] But this is happening.

[03:44] This is happening.

[03:45] We're going to get a Brian Eddie, Zambietti Venom game.

[03:49] That is happening after Rush.

[03:51] Now here is another rumor from Stern pinball that we are going to get James Bond, which is

[03:57] going to be finished by George Gomez.

[04:00] And it was started by Steve Richie.

[04:02] That is also happening.

[04:04] Now here is the other thing that I'm here to tell you.

[04:06] We almost know all of Stern's lineup in 2022.

[04:10] We are also going to get as a music pin, a Foo Fighters music pin from Stern pinball.

[04:17] Now whenever music pins get announced, it gets very divisive.

[04:21] A lot of you love Rush, a lot of you hate Rush.

[04:24] Some of you are in the middle, but for the most part, some of these musical acts are

[04:28] not universally loved.

[04:30] And not every musician is universally loved, but Rush is not a universally loved act.

[04:37] Neither are the Foo Fighters.

[04:39] Now I'm not here to argue whether or not there are fans of these two bands they're

[04:43] absolutely are.

[04:46] But if you were to ask me, I think there are way better bands that deserve a pinball

[04:51] machine over the Foo Fighters and over Rush.

[04:56] How about bands like you too?

[04:58] How about the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

[05:01] How about Motley Crew?

[05:03] And when you think about pinball and the music that's perfect for pinball, it's high energy

[05:07] rock.

[05:08] And I'd much rather have Nirvana over Foo Fighters, even though Dave Grohl comes from Nirvana.

[05:14] You know what I'm saying?

[05:15] There are just better bands out there with higher energy.

[05:19] I would rather have a Green Day pinball machine than Foo Fighters.

[05:23] Now here's the really interesting part is who is doing Foo Fighters pinball machine over

[05:28] at Stern.

[05:29] Now, I don't think back to the future is happening.

[05:32] I really don't.

[05:33] I think back to the future is just a red herring.

[05:36] I think Stern has the back to the future rumors going.

[05:40] But if you think about the schedule, if we've got Brian Eddie on Venom, then we've got

[05:46] a George Gomez James Bond.

[05:49] Then we're up to Keith L. Win again, right?

[05:51] It's Keith L. Win's turn.

[05:53] Now do you think Foo Fighters with Zambi Eddie, who has done Foo Fighter artwork, do you

[05:58] think Keith L. Win is going to do the Foo Fighters pinball machine?

[06:03] Now you could look at it like Keith L. Win is due for another musical pin.

[06:07] He started with Iron Maiden.

[06:09] Then he went on to Jurassic Park and Avengers and Godzilla.

[06:12] So maybe his next title will be a musical pin.

[06:16] So I could see Keith L. Win doing Foo Fighters.

[06:19] And I could see the Keith L. Win fan base being like, please don't do Foo Fighters.

[06:25] Everybody out there.

[06:26] Everybody wants Keith L. Win to do back to the future, but I'm not sure.

[06:30] I'm really not sure if it's going to happen.

[06:32] If it does happen, it's going to be a Joe Kamikaw title.

[06:36] So how does it feel?

[06:37] Doesn't it feel liberating knowing all of these stern titles way before they want you to

[06:42] know them?

[06:43] It feels very liberating because now as a consumer, you can make more educated decisions on what

[06:49] you're going to buy.

[06:50] And these companies don't want this.

[06:52] They don't want you to know what's around the corner because if you are a Venom fan

[06:57] and you were thinking about getting rush, now you might wait.

[07:01] Hopefully next year is going to be a brutal year for everybody because the delay is on

[07:05] getting pinball machines is going to be extreme.

[07:08] I hear that stern is nowhere near making four to five hundred games a week because of

[07:12] supply shortages.

[07:14] So if you're waiting on your game, you're going to be waiting a long time.

[07:18] All right, let's go over to Jersey Jack pinball.

[07:21] So what are the rumors over at Jersey Jack pinball?

[07:24] Toy Story is the next game from Pat Lawler.

[07:27] I would be so shocked if Toy Story isn't next.

[07:31] Even my greatest sources when I press them on this, I'm like, are you sure it's Toy Story?

[07:36] I mean, the movie hasn't been out for a while.

[07:38] They are like Chris.

[07:40] It is Toy Story.

[07:41] Okay.

[07:42] Everyone over at Jersey Jack hates your guts, Chris, but it is Toy Story.

[07:46] Okay.

[07:47] So it is Toy Story.

[07:48] Then when are we going to see it?

[07:49] People keep asking me that.

[07:50] When are we going to see Toy Story?

[07:52] So what I'm hearing?

[07:53] So the rumor is that Toy Story will come out most likely end of spring early summer.

[07:59] That is the earliest we will see Toy Story from Jersey Jack pinball.

[08:04] Now here are where the other rumors get interesting.

[08:07] I am hearing that after Toy Story, we'll be Steve Richie's inaugural game at Jersey Jack

[08:14] pinball.

[08:15] So he is going to be after Pat Lawler, not Eric Minier.

[08:18] Now this makes sense.

[08:20] When you think about it, they weren't going to bring Steve Richie on board.

[08:23] The king of all pinball.

[08:25] Steve Richie is over there to make a statement.

[08:27] How can he make a statement if he has to wait two and a half or three years to get a game

[08:31] into the market?

[08:32] And you have to believe that part of the agreement he made with Leonard and Brett and Jack was

[08:37] like, look, I'll come over, but I'm not going to go to the end of the line.

[08:41] Like I'm Steve Richie.

[08:42] Like I want to make an immediate impact.

[08:44] So I'm going to jump right in on a game.

[08:47] So Steve Richie after Toy Story.

[08:50] Now what is Steve Richie's title?

[08:52] Now here is the rumor I am hearing.

[08:54] There are two titles that I am hearing rumored that are in the mix over at Jersey Jack pinball.

[09:00] Now they are both juggernaut movie franchises.

[09:04] And if you were to ask me, one makes more sense than the other, but they both would actually

[09:09] be amazing additions to the Jersey Jack portfolio.

[09:13] And the two titles I'm hearing are the Matrix and Avatar.

[09:18] Now let's think about that for a minute.

[09:20] Which one makes the most sense?

[09:22] Now if they do the Matrix and Matrix 4 is coming out in just a couple weeks, that would

[09:28] be amazing.

[09:29] And the fourth film will be out.

[09:30] So they have all of the assets they need to put into the game.

[09:34] And if he's already done the design and the layout, I mean, it's the Matrix, right?

[09:38] So they have all the assets to put into the game and have the game capture all four films.

[09:43] Okay.

[09:44] So the timing on that is pretty good.

[09:45] Now for some reason, Jersey Jack can never time up the launch of a game with the major theatrical

[09:50] release of that property.

[09:52] Like they're always way off.

[09:53] Like they miss the Toy Story window.

[09:55] They miss the Hobbit window.

[09:57] They're missing the Matrix window.

[09:59] And so then you think about Avatar.

[10:01] The next Avatar movie is happening in December of next year.

[10:06] Now I do know that the executive producer of the Avatar franchise and Leonard are friends.

[10:12] So there is a relationship there.

[10:14] So do we think that Jersey Jack Pimball will make an Avatar Pimball machine?

[10:19] Now I know what people are saying, like, oh, we already have an Avatar Pimball machine.

[10:23] But Jersey Jack Pimball has built a career on making games that are already out.

[10:28] Hello guns and roses.

[10:30] Hello Hobbit.

[10:31] Lord of the Rings 2.

[10:32] I mean, think about Jersey Jack, right?

[10:34] They're always recycling themes that worked for Stern, Pirate of the Caribbean.

[10:38] They're picking games that are already in market.

[10:40] So if they make another Avatar game, it's hard to argue against why not.

[10:46] Avatar is one of the biggest film franchises of all time.

[10:49] There are four more.

[10:50] Count them.

[10:51] Four more Avatar movies coming out.

[10:55] Four of them.

[10:56] Okay.

[10:57] So if you're going to make an Avatar Pimball machine, this is going to be a franchise that's

[11:00] going to be part of culture for the next eight to nine years.

[11:04] So it makes total sense.

[11:06] And nobody out there, nobody out there would not want to see how Jersey Jack would bring

[11:12] the Avatar world to life.

[11:14] I mean, think about that bioluminescent world.

[11:17] And it coming to life with all of what Jersey Jack puts into a Pimball machine.

[11:21] I mean, it would be kind of epic.

[11:23] No company creates a world under glass better than Jersey Jack.

[11:27] So if Steve Richie is next, then Eric Minier's game is after that.

[11:32] So what is Eric Minier working on?

[11:35] Now I heard a rumor about what Eric's next title is.

[11:38] I know it.

[11:39] And I'm not just going to come out and say it just yet.

[11:41] I said I was going to wait until our club memberships got to like 400.

[11:45] I don't know if that'll ever happen, but it's so soon.

[11:48] Like I don't want to spoil it so soon.

[11:51] Like there's so much time to go until we get to Eric's next game.

[11:55] I will give you a hint that his next game is based on a movie franchise.

[12:00] And that movie franchise has more than one movie out there.

[12:05] I know that's not an incredible hint, but that is what it is.

[12:09] It's also a movie franchise that is older than two decades.

[12:14] Okay, those are three hints for you.

[12:16] Now this is again, just a rumor.

[12:17] It's what I'm hearing he's working on.

[12:19] And I think it's a questionable choice if you ask me,

[12:23] but I will talk more about it as we do more episodes of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[12:28] All right.

[12:28] So those are the rumors over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[12:30] We all can't wait for Toy Story.

[12:32] I'm also hearing a rumor that there will be two versions of Toy Story.

[12:36] There will be 1000 CEs and there will be 500 buzz editions and

[12:42] 500 Woody editions.

[12:45] I think it would be super smart if they did this.

[12:47] I do because I think then you're bumping your number of CEs up,

[12:52] but you're also making two variations.

[12:54] So they're both kind of still limited and rare.

[12:57] So will we see a buzz edition and a Woody edition of Jersey Jack's Toy Story time?

[13:04] We'll tell.

[13:04] All right.

[13:05] Let's go over to spooky pinball.

[13:06] What's happening in the spooky pinball world?

[13:08] So right now, spooky pinball is updating code on Halloween and Ultraman and

[13:14] people who are updating their codes are enjoying the improvements made in the

[13:18] games.

[13:18] And that's what we like to see.

[13:19] We like to see these games get better.

[13:21] I wish they were better at launch, but I can't turn back time.

[13:25] They are also working on a little bug that's very interesting.

[13:29] There's a problem with their code updates that if you had a Macintosh or a Mac

[13:34] computer, you can't update your game.

[13:37] Something with the Mac putting something onto the USB stick that it doesn't work

[13:41] right now.

[13:42] They are working on it and they say they are going to fix that.

[13:46] Now, is this a stupid oversight?

[13:48] Yes.

[13:48] Should they have tested this before?

[13:50] Yes.

[13:51] Do a lot of people in the creative field and a lot of people who buy pinball machines

[13:55] only use Macintosh.

[13:56] Yes.

[13:57] But once again, you know, this is spooky pinball people.

[14:01] This is spooky pinball.

[14:02] They are learning as they go.

[14:04] They're always learning as they go.

[14:07] Will they ever fully figure it out?

[14:09] Will spooky pinball get to a point where they finally figure it out and give us

[14:14] what we want without having to tell them what we want?

[14:17] They're not there yet.

[14:18] I mean, I read the threads and it's kind of comical.

[14:20] Like the entire thing are people being guinea pigs for the games, giving them feedback,

[14:26] spooky responding in real time, being like, thank you, everybody.

[14:30] We're taking all your feedback into account and we can't wait to try to make the

[14:33] games better to live up to your expectations.

[14:36] And for some people, they like that journey.

[14:38] For some people, they like that journey.

[14:40] For me personally, I like to buy products from companies that know how to make it

[14:45] amazing before I buy it.

[14:47] I like to buy products from companies that polish it before I ever see it.

[14:50] I'm not the biggest fan of what spooky is doing right now.

[14:53] You know, the daily correspondence with the fans.

[14:56] I'm not.

[14:57] I think as a company, you've got to sort of draw a line.

[14:59] I don't know, spooky like maybe don't talk to people on a daily basis.

[15:03] Just make it better and maybe surprises every few weeks with new code updates,

[15:07] but the daily listening on pin side, I think they're going to get tired of it.

[15:11] I also don't care who you hire.

[15:13] I don't.

[15:14] I really don't care who you hire.

[15:16] I really don't care who these unknown people are that you're bringing on board.

[15:19] All I care about are what they do.

[15:22] And if you're going to make these games great, I hope you do.

[15:24] But I want to see the proof in the pudding.

[15:26] That's just my take in it.

[15:27] I think spooky wants to get credit before they deserve credit.

[15:31] And again, when they decided to make 1750 games, they should have hired all these people

[15:35] before they did that.

[15:36] And I think they did it late.

[15:38] And I think that's why a lot of people are trying to drop their spots.

[15:42] And the big question mark for spooky pinball will be, will people who bail on these games early regret it?

[15:48] Will they make these games great?

[15:50] We shall see.

[15:51] Now, are there any rumors over at spooky pinball?

[15:53] There's not too many other than this.

[15:56] The next spooky pinball title will be out in December of next year.

[16:02] That is the time frame for the next spooky game I am hearing.

[16:05] I'm also hearing that it is going to be a licensed theme.

[16:09] I'm also hearing this, but the next spooky game, they are not going to limit the amount they make.

[16:16] Very interesting.

[16:17] Do we think this rumor is true?

[16:19] Why would they do that?

[16:21] Why would spooky remove the FOMO aspect of a game?

[16:26] The only reason they would do that, think about it, the only reason spooky pinball would remove the limited nature of the title is if the title is a jug or not.

[16:37] Right?

[16:38] Because if it's not a huge theme that they want to make for years and years and years, it has to be a theme, right?

[16:43] Where people will want to order it for years and years and years.

[16:46] Why would they take away the one thing that drove people through the door?

[16:50] And that's FOMO.

[16:52] And everybody knows that.

[16:53] It's not like we all ran to Halloween and Ultra Man because we saw the games and we saw they were awesome or like take my money now.

[16:58] No, they didn't even show the game.

[17:00] They all they told us was they were only making 1250 and 500 and that's enough to sell the games.

[17:05] So very curious move if they do this.

[17:08] All right, let's go on to Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:11] Any rumors over at CGC?

[17:13] Well, other than the fact that Mark Richie's pulp fiction that I'm hearing is a single level solid state game.

[17:19] I don't know where it is.

[17:20] Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:21] It's really hard to get excited about a company that takes forever and a day to get games out.

[17:28] So the rumors I'm hearing at CGC is that I think that Mark Richie's pulp fiction is happening.

[17:34] I also think that CGC, the rumor is they are going to make Beetle Juice.

[17:39] And I think that Kapow, Joe Kamikaw, I heard this might be making Beetle Juice with CGC.

[17:46] Now again, this is a rumor, but I'm hearing Beetle Juice is in the works.

[17:51] It sort of makes sense.

[17:52] Right, George Gomez came out and said that Stern didn't want to make Beetle Juice because nobody was interested in it.

[17:59] Christopher Franchi's been at CGC for a couple years.

[18:01] He loves Beetle Juice.

[18:03] So did Christopher Franchi help broker a deal between Joe Kamikaw?

[18:07] Who Mr. Franchi works with and CGC?

[18:11] That would be really cool.

[18:12] What would be amazing is if Ben Hex Game was Beetle Juice.

[18:16] Because Ben Hex is making a game with CGC.

[18:19] So I would normally say like we'll find out in a few months, but because it's CGC, we're going to find out in a few years.

[18:25] And it's again, it's hard to get excited about CGC because of how long they take.

[18:29] All right, what other rumors are happening in the pinball world?

[18:32] Did you guys see this Indiana Jones, right?

[18:34] This modded Indiana Jones sold yesterday for $20,000.

[18:39] Like what's wrong with people?

[18:41] I mean, it was beautiful.

[18:42] It was all brass, plated, Oracle pinball company did the modifications, beautiful stunning machine.

[18:48] But there are so many Indiana Jones games out there, so many of them.

[18:53] And you could easily take Indiana Jones and do all that work for far less than $20,000.

[19:00] But if you want it tomorrow and you want to put it in your home and you want to flex with that Indiana Jones,

[19:06] awesome.

[19:07] No one's going to care because everyone knows you spend $20,000 on it.

[19:11] And anyone who really loves Indy would never do that.

[19:14] See, it's just a weird thing.

[19:16] All the new money coming into pinball, it is time.

[19:19] And I mean this, it is time.

[19:21] If you want to cash out on your pinball collection, now is the time to do it.

[19:26] There are more people with money willing to buy whatever you dangle in front of them.

[19:32] Hence a $61,000 magic girl.

[19:35] I hope it sells for that.

[19:36] I hope it sells for that so we can point at one guy and be like, at least I'm not that guy.

[19:40] And then it's sad because I'm seeing the guy who has the a virus signature edition for sale, right?

[19:44] They only made 50 of those and he can't even get $26,000 for it.

[19:49] Because now everybody wants the new one, the 40th anniversary edition.

[19:53] He's turned screwed over those people.

[19:55] They had this rare thing.

[19:56] Now there's another rare version.

[19:58] And you best believe that Stern is going to do remakes and SLE is now all the time.

[20:06] Whenever there is a major anniversary of a game, I bet they rerun it and do some sparkly armor

[20:13] and charge you like 15 to 20 grand and watch everybody run to it.

[20:18] But I'm done with that.

[20:19] Canada is absolutely done with that.

[20:21] I am only buying dream themes from now on.

[20:25] Mark my words.

[20:26] If it's not a dream theme of mine, I'm passing.

[20:30] Doesn't mean I won't buy it and flip it to somebody else for more money.

[20:33] Oops, canada said it.

[20:35] He's still going to scalp.

[20:36] Of course, I'm still going to scalp in this marketplace, people.

[20:39] Why wouldn't I?

[20:40] Why wouldn't you?

[20:42] This is the new pinball market.

[20:44] I mean, if you can get in on a game, why wouldn't you get it and sell it for more money?

[20:49] For the amount of time we spend studying pinball, why can't we treat pinball like a marketplace

[20:54] like that?

[20:55] Like I'm not spending all my hours studying stocks and studying cryptocurrencies.

[21:00] I've spent all my time invested in pinball.

[21:03] And this is one avenue for me to make some money on it.

[21:07] And I hate to say this, but I could flip two stern pinball machines a year.

[21:11] I mean, this I could flip two stern pinball machines a year.

[21:15] And it would make me more money than this podcast makes me.

[21:20] And all the hours I put into this podcast, you know, many hours it takes to flip a machine

[21:24] and make money like one hour at most.

[21:28] You list it, someone buys it, you send it to them, the buyer sends you the money, everybody's

[21:34] happy.

[21:35] So don't ever come at me and say it's a horrible thing you do because I do so many hours

[21:41] of pinball content.

[21:42] Don't I deserve?

[21:43] Don't I deserve to take the knowledge I know about the pinball market and make a buck or

[21:48] two.

[21:49] And I will never apologize for it.

[21:51] Okay.

[21:52] So give me all of your at least everybody.

[21:53] All right.

[21:54] What else is going on?

[21:55] Rumor in P3 Multimorphic Land.

[21:57] No rumors.

[21:58] The idea of what the license theme is that Scott and EZ is working on anything else happening.

[22:03] Nothing at Dutch pinball.

[22:05] Nothing at the pinball brothers.

[22:06] Who am I missing in the pinball world?

[22:08] Haggis pinball.

[22:09] No rumors there.

[22:10] So I think that pretty much sums up what's going on in the pinball world.

[22:15] Oh, let me end this podcast by saying, you know, it's been a really interesting 2021 going

[22:20] into 2022.

[22:22] I've been looking at these pinball prices and they are in name.

[22:25] They're absolutely in name.

[22:27] And the prices are through the roof.

[22:28] I'll tell you the one thread that makes me the happiest.

[22:31] It's not all these four sale threads.

[22:33] It's not all these club threads where people are trying to problem shoot their games.

[22:38] The happiest thread on all the pin side is the thread in which people share their game

[22:44] rooms.

[22:45] And if you don't go into this thread, I highly recommend it because that's what it all

[22:48] boils down to.

[22:49] The only reason we buy these things is to put them in our homes and play them or put them

[22:54] on location and make some money.

[22:56] That's the only reason pinball exists.

[22:57] In fact, it was never meant to be in our homes, but that is why I love looking at people's

[23:02] game rooms because when you see the game room thread, you actually see the reality of this

[23:06] industry.

[23:07] In one page, you will see someone's home that is clearly forward to 8,000 square feet.

[23:13] You will see people's finished basements with over $200,000 in pinball machines there.

[23:19] $200,000 in pinball machines, you know, 20, 30 games.

[23:23] And you know that in that house, in that house is just one guy who probably has kids and

[23:28] a wife and he probably barely plays the games.

[23:32] He doesn't have enough time to play all those games.

[23:34] And as someone who's now a father, I completely see now how the time to play pinball is very

[23:39] limiting.

[23:40] But it's great, right?

[23:41] He loves pinball and he outfitted his game room with all those games.

[23:45] And then you'll see a guy who's got maybe two machines in a garage, right?

[23:49] And it's like neon signs and beer signs and that's his game room.

[23:53] And everyone's game room is kind of a reflection of where we are in life, the things we enjoy,

[24:00] the games we love.

[24:01] And I love seeing it because I love seeing, you know, some guys are like all in on sturns.

[24:05] Some guys have a variety of pins.

[24:07] Some guys have Jersey Jack games.

[24:09] Some guys have CGC games.

[24:11] And it's my favorite thread.

[24:13] And I wish more and more of what we celebrated and shared was just that.

[24:17] Here's who I am.

[24:18] Here's my game room.

[24:20] Here are the games that speak to me because I think that's the most positive thread in

[24:24] all of pin sides.

[24:25] So do me a favor, everybody.

[24:26] If you haven't shared your game room on pin side in a while, please update that thread

[24:32] with your current lineup of games.

[24:34] It would be great to see it.

[24:35] It would be great to see what is in your house and what games you're enjoying right now.

[24:40] I'm also going to start a thread on my Facebook page of share your game room photo here.

[24:44] Because I do think it's the one thing that always helps me reset and get reenergized

[24:50] is seeing all of you guys excited about your pins and your game rooms.

[24:54] Of course, the price increases are deflating and they suck and they're not going to get

[24:58] any better.

[24:59] But it's still pinball, right?

[25:01] You're still not going to lose that much money.

[25:03] I once bought a $30,000 engagement ring.

[25:06] I broke up the engagement.

[25:07] The same jeweler who I bought the ring from bought it back for me just a couple months

[25:12] later for $15,000.

[25:15] I bought a $3,000 bar from restoration hardware.

[25:18] I can't even sell it for $500.

[25:21] You go buy a $3,000 TV.

[25:24] You'll get $300 bucks for it in a few years.

[25:26] So if you go all in on a pinball machine, you're not going to lose your shirt.

[25:31] But be cautious, collector.

[25:33] If you do buy these $20,000 Indiana Joneses or these L virus for $26,000 or $38,000 for

[25:42] a pirate CE, just be careful and know that the only reason you should buy at those extremely

[25:48] high prices, right?

[25:49] A $21,000 Ghostbusters.

[25:53] Only buy it if you really, really are going to bolt that game to the floor because if you

[25:58] want to trade it down the road, believe me, it's the high end stuff that's going to suffer

[26:03] the most.

[26:04] The rest of the stuff will hold its value, but you're buying at an extreme inflated price

[26:08] on all those other titles.

[26:10] Nobody knows it.

[26:11] I don't mind when people buy those games because I know that people buying those games

[26:14] are rich.

[26:15] They are rich.

[26:16] Nobody is waking up tomorrow and buying a $21,000 Ghostbusters or a $20,000 Indiana Jones

[26:23] or a $40,000 Pirates or a $60,000 Magic Girl who's not loaded.

[26:28] And those people have so much money they don't care.

[26:31] So great, I'm glad you got your machine, but you're never going to be able to trade it

[26:36] again at that price because in a year or two from now with so many games coming out,

[26:42] everything's going to go down market.

[26:44] It just is.

[26:45] All right?

[26:46] Everybody.

[26:47] This has been episode 631 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[26:49] It's the holidays coming up.

[26:51] Get ready to celebrate your month with the family and turn off Pinside and just enjoy

[26:55] your Pimball machines.

[26:56] All right?

[26:57] We'll talk to you soon.
