[00:00] Welcome everybody, happy Friday.

[00:25] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast with no prizes, no giveaways,

[00:32] just love.

[00:33] So I'm going to do something on this episode, no pinball podcast has ever done before.

[00:37] I'm going to turn each and every one of you into a distributor for just a few minutes.

[00:43] And what I mean by that is I'm looking down and I'm looking at some papers in front of

[00:48] me and I have official correspondence between Stern Pinball and its distributors.

[00:53] I have Stern Pinball's minimum advertised price policy.

[00:59] We're going to read that.

[01:00] We know this exists, but we've never seen it word for word exactly what Stern requires

[01:06] of its distributors.

[01:07] I also have Stern Pinball's authorized dealer agreement, which is not that exciting.

[01:12] I have their terms and conditions of sale, which is also not that exciting.

[01:17] I have a disclaimer of implied warranties.

[01:20] I also have a letter from Gary Stern about Stern Pinball machines being exported out

[01:26] of the USA.

[01:27] Now look, I'm not going to read everything here and I'm going to tell you right now,

[01:31] the majority of this stuff is simply indemnification clauses between Stern Pinball and its distributors

[01:38] and its customers.

[01:40] Basically Stern wants to limit the majority of its liabilities once its products leave

[01:46] the factory.

[01:47] We will read a few things specifically that go into that, but not too much.

[01:52] You guys know the drill.

[01:53] I mean, there's really no warranties on these pinball machines.

[01:57] The second you get a game, if you actually read your warranty, there's not much that

[02:00] is covered.

[02:01] I also have a really interesting email from Max, who is the sales and marketing manager

[02:06] at American Pinball.

[02:08] They sent this note to their distributors and sales teams a few weeks ago or a week

[02:13] ago.

[02:14] They're going to go over some of the things they want their distributors to know about

[02:17] American Pinball products moving forward.

[02:20] It's really interesting.

[02:21] I'm going to read that one throughout.

[02:23] Like I said, each and every one of you, for just a few minutes, Canada is going to turn

[02:28] into a distributor.

[02:30] Look, before I do this, I want to just do two things.

[02:32] First, I want to welcome Manania to the show, who is a co-worker of mine who heard about

[02:37] my podcast and signed up last night.

[02:40] We now have 564 club members and it is growing strong each week.

[02:45] So thank you, each and every one of you for joining.

[02:47] I also want to say, number two, we also need distributors.

[02:51] You know, look, these are very complex devices.

[02:54] Things go wrong with pinball machines.

[02:56] For the majority of people who do buy a new pinball machine, they probably need some help

[03:01] setting it up.

[03:02] They also need help if something goes wrong.

[03:05] It is a device that has issues.

[03:07] Trust me.

[03:08] And it is much nicer having a relationship with a distributor to help you out, not only

[03:14] to help you get a new game when you're looking for a new game, but also to help you if you

[03:18] have issues with the game itself.

[03:20] Some of my best friends in pinball are distributors and I understand how much hard work they do.

[03:27] So before I do this and make each and every one of you a distributor for a few minutes,

[03:32] I want to just say that we do appreciate all the distributors do in the pinball world.

[03:37] All right.

[03:38] So where should we start?

[03:39] So let's start with Stern Pinball Inks, minimum advertised price policy that is MAP MAP and

[03:46] Stern's unilateral minimum resale price policy or UMRP.

[03:51] Here's what's really funny about this.

[03:53] This went into effect and I'm not even making this up.

[03:56] It went into effect April 1st of 2016.

[04:00] So Stern Pinball on April Fool's Day put together this for all their distros.

[04:06] And I also know that none of this has changed since 2016.

[04:09] They haven't updated this at all.

[04:11] Let me read this word for word.

[04:13] It starts off with preamble.

[04:16] Stern Pinball Inc. United States minimum advertised retail price and unilateral minimum resale

[04:23] price policy is designed to offer our United States customers strong value for the features

[04:30] associated with Stern machines and accessories.

[04:33] While our dealers, including distributors with respect to their advertising and sale

[04:38] directly to consumers are absolutely free to establish their resale prices for Stern

[04:44] products, dealers that advertise prices below MAP or sell products below UMRP in the United

[04:53] States significantly erode our reputation for products of superior quality, exceptional

[05:01] aesthetic design and technical innovation, as well as the property rights of our licensors,

[05:09] detrimentally affecting our brand integrity.

[05:13] Moreover, such dealers unfairly free ride on the investments that other dealers make

[05:19] in order to provide valuable sales and service support in promoting the features, benefits

[05:26] and premium image of our products.

[05:29] In order to protect the image and reputation of our company and that of our licensors and

[05:35] to protect the investments of other dealers, Stern is instituting this MAP and UMRP policy

[05:43] as described below for the products identified on the attached price list.

[05:49] So let's analyze that a little bit.

[05:50] So I don't have the attached price list, but basically what they're saying is this.

[05:55] We don't want people to sell below a certain price because what could happen is the following

[06:01] and this is just Canada interpreting this.

[06:03] So here's what they're doing.

[06:04] They don't want one dealer to be able to undercut everybody else and it makes sense because

[06:10] a lot of dealers out there might have invested money in like service and repair technicians

[06:15] or in a sales team.

[06:17] And so you could have a dealer who doesn't care about any of that that just wants the

[06:21] lowest advertised price.

[06:24] And so they don't want someone to walk in and sell every single machine for $500 less

[06:28] than like your coin takers or your automatids.

[06:31] And then everyone wants to buy the game from that person simply to get the lowest price.

[06:36] So they really want to try to protect the fact that those dealers that are their best

[06:40] and trusted dealers are investing more in Stern and they shouldn't be undercut by someone

[06:46] who's just wants to win on price alone.

[06:48] But let me keep reading for you.

[06:50] What price refers to the price of a product after any and all discounts rebates or concessions

[06:57] and any other promotional technique that reduces the effective selling price for the product

[07:03] other than freight or delivery.

[07:05] That's interesting because you'll notice how some dealers out there will offer free delivery

[07:09] and they're allowed to do that.

[07:11] And that's a smart way to sort of actually sell someone a product for like four or $500

[07:16] less than their competitors.

[07:18] I'm going to keep going.

[07:19] Such devices include but are not limited to discounted or free merchandise with purchase

[07:25] and future discounts with purchase.

[07:27] If a price includes additional merchandise or future discount net price is the price

[07:33] after deduction of the cost of such merchandise or amount of such discount.

[07:38] All right.

[07:39] Let me keep going.

[07:40] The map and UMRP policy map refers to the minimum advertised net price at which Stern

[07:46] anticipates its dealers will advertise Stern products.

[07:51] The term advertising refers to all media including but not limited to newspapers, catalogs, magazines,

[07:58] trade publications, direct email, emails, text messages, newsletters, coupons, radio,

[08:03] television and cable and internet web pages and sites.

[08:07] With respect to the internet all information prior to the point of sale is considered advertising

[08:13] subject to this policy.

[08:15] And this is bolded and italicized including but not limited to buy it now prices, click

[08:22] here for pricing terminology and code it discounts.

[08:27] You know it's interesting they have that they're like click here for pricing, right?

[08:31] So you don't hide the discounted price on another page.

[08:34] But you know what's not listed here which is also interesting is call for price because

[08:40] I'm noticing that's where everyone who's selling for below map is hiding their discounted

[08:45] price.

[08:46] If you look at James Bond 60th what is everybody saying?

[08:50] Contact for price and you know what happens when you contact them for price?

[08:54] They'll sell it to you for below map.

[08:56] They'll sell it to you for 17.5.

[08:58] So maybe Stern needs to update this because I think when times were great they didn't

[09:03] really need to do that but now that times are getting tougher they might need to do

[09:08] that.

[09:09] So let's read the point of sale is the cart page or that level or page at which the price

[09:14] actually paid by the customer is identified.

[09:18] Coded discounts disseminated to customers before the customer enters the cart page and

[09:24] which reduced price at the cart level are considered advertising.

[09:28] This policy does not apply to in store displays signage but does apply to external advertising

[09:36] of in store prices, promotions and special events and to in store flyers which may be

[09:42] disseminated on the web or otherwise.

[09:45] Other devices and schemes intended to reduce net price are considered advertising.

[09:50] Alright so just summarize all of that basically you're not allowed to advertise a price below

[09:57] map anywhere that is considered advertising.

[09:59] Alright it then goes on to say unilateral minimum resale price is the suggested minimum

[10:06] net price at which a dealer actually sells a product to consumers.

[10:11] The next section is non-compliance.

[10:13] Stern will take the following actions should a Stern United States dealer fail to comply

[10:18] with this policy.

[10:20] A, for a period of 30 days after Stern learns of a dealer's first failure to comply Stern

[10:26] will cancel all orders for and will not accept new orders from that dealer for the specific

[10:33] products which are the subject of non-compliance.

[10:38] Well that's kind of funny like if you get caught breaking the rules on Godzilla they

[10:42] will just make it hard for you to sell Godzilla but learn your lesson and we'll let you sell

[10:47] rush machines okay.

[10:49] The next is B, for a period of 30 days after Stern learns of dealer's second failure to

[10:55] comply during a 12 month period Stern will cancel all orders for and will not accept

[11:02] new order forms from the dealers for all Stern products.

[11:06] Uh oh so if you break the rule once okay if you break it twice they will take away your

[11:12] ability to sell Stern products.

[11:14] There's a third clause here C, after Stern learns of a dealer's third separate failure

[11:20] to comply during a 12 month period Stern will cancel all orders from the dealer will

[11:26] not accept new orders from that dealer and will terminate its agreement with the dealer.

[11:33] That means three strikes you're out.

[11:36] Wow alright so it's serious stuff here people you can't sell below this map price you're

[11:41] done with Stern.

[11:42] The next section is unilateral nature of map and UMRP policy.

[11:48] This is a unilaterally adopted policy and is not a contract or offer to form a contract

[11:54] or agreement.

[11:56] Stern does not request and will not accept any agreement regarding a customer's compliance

[12:02] with this policy.

[12:03] The policy merely is intended to describe terms under which Stern will in its sole discretion

[12:10] choose to sell particular products or all products to a dealer.

[12:15] Stern sales representatives are strictly prohibited from discussing this policy or any dealer's

[12:21] advertised selling prices with that dealer or any other dealer.

[12:26] Let me repeat the line this is Stern's sales reps are strictly prohibited from discussing

[12:30] this policy.

[12:32] Canada's pinball podcast is holding this policy.

[12:36] And look I don't think there's anything in here that is that like groundbreaking I don't

[12:41] think there's anything in here that's that shocking.

[12:43] But the fact that they don't want anybody to know this is you know I get it they're

[12:48] again they're just trying to save themselves from any blowback.

[12:51] The last section is called conclusion.

[12:54] Stern reserves the right to choose those dealers with which it will do business and the right

[12:58] to accept or reject any purchase order from any dealer at any time.

[13:04] To ensure this policy is administered consistently please address any and all questions about

[13:10] the policy in writing to Gary Stern or to Michael O'Donnell.

[13:16] That is what we know is happening over at Stern and now you know you know as a fan of

[13:20] pinball this is what these dealers are up against.

[13:23] So they all have to take this very seriously.

[13:26] And this is why when we see the pricing of Stern machines I'm just going to say this

[13:30] though there are dealers out there that obviously they don't abide by this policy to the fullest

[13:36] extent.

[13:37] And I think what's happened in pinball over the years is that many dealers are getting

[13:42] around this policy by simply doing one thing.

[13:46] They are putting absolutely nothing in writing and they're not advertising the price.

[13:51] And so many people out there and you know who you are you've been getting games for below

[13:56] the map price because your dealer and your distro has called you up and given you a price

[14:04] that is below the map price.

[14:06] They never put it in writing.

[14:08] They never advertised it but you've been able to buy your games cheaper than everybody

[14:12] else and that is how some of these dealers have built up a clientele over the years.

[14:18] It's been a little dirty secret in the pinball world over the years.

[14:22] We all know it happens but this is what canada does.

[14:25] He tells you what's actually going on in the world of pinball sales.

[14:28] All right.

[14:29] Is there anything else that's interesting on the stern front before I read this American

[14:33] pinball one.

[14:34] So I've got this printout of the disclaimer of implied warranties.

[14:38] Nothing really interesting there other than this.

[14:41] Here's what's interesting about claims and adjustments for the stern warranty claims for

[14:45] adjustment on short or otherwise unsatisfactory merchandise due to fault of stern must be

[14:53] made to stern within 10 days of receipt of shipment in such situations.

[14:59] Sturn shall have the right to examine the applicable merchandise and shipping records

[15:04] at dealers location.

[15:05] All right.

[15:06] Now the problem is and we've seen this in pinball right is like you don't always know

[15:09] within 10 days if the merchandise is defective like the ghosted inserts in Ghostbusters but

[15:15] stern did a good job in getting people new replacement playfields for Ghostbusters.

[15:19] It took a while and I will say this even though the warranty is piss poor I have heard for

[15:25] the most part stern pinball does take care of its customers.

[15:29] There are some parts that are just really hard to get and I think that's where the frustration

[15:34] lies for some of us is like we have like a node board or we have some mech that we need

[15:39] from a game or some part from a game from years ago and it's not really easy to get

[15:43] some of that stuff.

[15:44] All right.

[15:45] So the other thing that happens whenever a new pinball game comes out is oftentimes my

[15:49] friends in Europe and my friends in Australia and my friends overseas they don't have the

[15:55] same access to the amount of games we get.

[15:57] You might be thinking to yourself maybe the best place to sell a machine is to someone

[16:02] in Europe and what's the difference between a game made in the US and a game that is like

[16:07] shipped overseas.

[16:08] Now I want to read you a letter from Mr. Gary Stern and this is all about sending games

[16:13] overseas.

[16:14] I hope you guys find this interesting again.

[16:16] This is just stuff that should be behind closed doors.

[16:20] We get a little bit of a peek behind the curtain.

[16:22] Don't worry.

[16:23] I'm going to be ranting and raving about how I really want to see Scooby Doo stream

[16:27] and how some guy on Pinsides that he's done with location pinball because he played some

[16:32] bad pinball location games.

[16:34] I mean that's like saying I had a bad cheeseburger.

[16:37] I'm never going to eat another cheeseburger again.

[16:40] What a silly thread that is.

[16:41] Come on Robin delete some of these crappy threads.

[16:44] All right.

[16:45] This is from Mr. Gary Stern.

[16:46] I'm going to do my best to read it as Canada.

[16:48] Dear ladies and gentlemen.

[16:50] Stern pinball supports its brand integrity worldwide.

[16:54] Our export business constitutes nearly 50% of our sales.

[16:59] In furtherance of our export business we have established a network of authorized importers

[17:05] with exclusive rights to actively sell stern pinball products in their territory.

[17:11] Stern's brand integrity is imperiled and significantly diminished when number one games

[17:17] do not comply with local laws requirements and regulations.

[17:21] Number two games shipped to a territory outside the US do not operate in that territory.

[17:28] And number three proper local support and service is not provided.

[17:32] US games do not comply with other countries local laws and requirements.

[17:37] It is against the law to import US spec games to many countries.

[17:42] For example US games do not comply with European Community CE regulations do not comply with

[17:48] ROHS requirements and do not have territory specific modifications performed at the factory.

[17:56] Stern manufactures its export games to comply with local laws requirements and regulations.

[18:03] Non-conforming and thus illegal stern games in our export markets adversely affect our

[18:09] brand integrity.

[18:10] Our US games will not work in most of our export markets.

[18:16] Stern manufactures and modifies its game to operate in the country to which the games

[18:20] are to be sold in operative games in peril sterns brand integrity.

[18:25] Proper local support and service must be available.

[18:28] A US based dealer cannot provide proper support and service to a customer in another country.

[18:36] All of Stern's importers provide service.

[18:39] Lack of local support and service is detrimental to Stern's brand integrity.

[18:44] How many times in this letter Gary are you going to say Stern's brand integrity?

[18:50] Maybe that's just Canadian making fun because everyone always says I have no integrity.

[18:54] All right let's keep going.

[18:56] Therefore to ensure our brand integrity is supported with local law compliance games

[19:01] that work in territories and proper local service we want and require you to sell Stern

[19:07] products to US consumers only.

[19:10] We call your attention to paragraph 1A, 1B2 of your authorized Stern dealer agreement.

[19:16] You are to sell to retail and user consumers only.

[19:21] Sales by you to anyone who intends to resell our products is prohibited.

[19:26] Your sale of a Stern game to any buyer who intends to resell that game including outside

[19:33] the US is a violation of your dealer agreement.

[19:38] Single game buyers may intend to resell it is your responsibility to know your customers

[19:44] and their intent.

[19:46] You should assume that buyers of multiple games of the same title and version intend

[19:51] to resell those games.

[19:53] Wow.

[19:54] Can we just stop there for a minute?

[19:55] How the heck does Stern expect a dealer to know that Canada is going to flip all those

[20:00] machines over the years?

[20:02] How do they know what anyone's going to do with their game?

[20:05] What they're really trying to get at here too is if some guy buys like four Ghostbuster

[20:10] LEs and they're all the same game we know what you're doing with those other three.

[20:16] All right let me finish this real quick because I want to get on to this American Pinball

[20:19] thing and I don't want this podcast to go too long because I'm the world's number one

[20:23] short-formed pinball podcast.

[20:25] It goes on to say most of our dealers follow the generally accepted practice of keeping

[20:30] serial number records of to whom each game is sold.

[20:34] This practice enhances both Stern and our dealer's ability to provide the best level

[20:39] of service and support.

[20:42] Effective immediately.

[20:43] We require all of our authorized dealers to keep records documenting the customer purchases

[20:48] by serial number.

[20:50] Failure to abide by the foregoing will require us to take corrective action.

[20:56] Your failure will be noted as a significant part of your dealer scorecard analysis reducing

[21:02] our discretionary MDF payment to you.

[21:06] We will take such other actions as we deem appropriate up to and including termination

[21:12] of your dealer agreement pursuant to paragraph eight thereof.

[21:17] Best regards Gary Stern.

[21:19] What a beautiful note Gary this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside carrying these products.

[21:25] I mean the Stern Pinball sounds a little bit like a mob.

[21:28] They're like the mafia.

[21:30] You better do what we say.

[21:32] You better sell for what we want you to sell it for.

[21:34] You better know who you're selling to or else you're out.

[21:38] And the thing is this Stern Pinball being the biggest player in all of pinball they

[21:42] can come across like this.

[21:44] All of their stuff is so legal speak.

[21:47] It's so corporate.

[21:49] It's so official.

[21:50] But look they've got to run a business.

[21:52] I get it.

[21:53] And they need to protect that brand integrity and that brand integrity people I'm telling

[21:57] you in 2023 you know with all going on in the world collectively can we all work together

[22:02] to ensure that pinball companies brand integrities are intact.

[22:07] All right so let's do this now.

[22:08] Let's read you American Pinball's correspondence to its distributors as of like a week ago.

[22:14] This is from Max their sales and marketing manager.

[22:17] And I think you're going to see a much more friendly tone from American Pinball.

[22:21] I think you're going to see a much more sort of like appreciating tone than Stern Pinball.

[22:26] I mean Stern's the big gorilla in the industry.

[22:28] So here's how American Pinball talks to its distributors.

[22:32] We hope this email finds you well and that you had a splendid holiday season with your

[22:37] family.

[22:38] I mean I like it more already.

[22:39] I really do.

[22:40] I like it more already.

[22:41] Let's go on.

[22:42] We wanted to reach out to provide you with some important updates and to pass along our

[22:46] new distributor agreement for 2023.

[22:49] This will be a bit of a lengthy email so please be sure to review thoroughly.

[22:54] Trust me it's not that long.

[22:55] As a quick note to highlight at the start here there are some changes on the price guide

[23:00] included which will go into effect starting January 30th 2023.

[23:06] I don't have the price guide ladies and gentlemen so you're just going to hear this email.

[23:09] We understand that price increases are never welcome.

[23:12] However despite current market challenges we have done our best to keep the changes as

[23:17] minimal as possible and remain at competitive price points.

[23:22] Please be assured that any orders currently in our system will not be affected by this

[23:27] change and will be honored at the original price.

[23:31] Can we all stand up right now and give American Pinball a thunderous round of applause for

[23:37] doing this.

[23:39] We're not going to retroactively raise the price the way Stern is doing it.

[23:43] I really really like this business practice.

[23:46] Let me go on.

[23:47] The price adjustment only affects new orders placed on or after January 30th and the new

[23:53] pricing will only impact our Hot Wheels and Houdini lines moderately.

[23:59] Why are you making more Hot Wheels or Houdinis but that's a subject for another show.

[24:03] Max goes on to say.

[24:04] As you know placing orders for games can be a significant investment and we want to ensure

[24:10] that we can accommodate all of our customers requests.

[24:14] Starting on February 2023 when you have five games pending in your queue we ask that you

[24:20] secure any additional orders with a non refundable $500 per game deposit.

[24:26] This deposit must be made to American Pinball within five business days of the order to

[24:32] secure your place in production.

[24:35] We understand that sometimes plans change and in the event of an order cancellation we

[24:40] will do our best to work with you to transfer your deposit to any future pre game orders.

[24:47] However please note that there will be no cash refund.

[24:51] We appreciate your understanding and support as we work to provide the best service possible.

[24:56] Let me unpack that a little bit and then we're going to go on with this letter.

[24:59] You know what's interesting about this is you know not the fact that there's a non

[25:01] refundable deposit it's that they want it after only five games ordered.

[25:06] I think that's such a telltale sign of like the volume of orders a company like American

[25:11] Pinball is getting five.

[25:14] Stern makes like 600 games a week.

[25:16] Stern is selling thousands of each title after a distributor has ordered five they require

[25:21] non refundable shows you that they're anxious.

[25:25] There's a little bit of stress there.

[25:26] You know they can't afford to have everybody come through the door and then bail on a title.

[25:30] All right I'm going to go on and read the next section but what I'm not going to do

[25:34] is I'm not going to disclose what the profit margin is.

[25:37] It says it in this note but I don't think it's my place to share that with you so I'm

[25:41] going to skip just that but I will share the rest of the language okay.

[25:46] So don't ever say Canada doesn't have a heart.

[25:48] He goes on to say we will also be continuing our profit margin on all pinball machines

[25:54] provided that our minimal manufacturer conditions are met.

[25:57] Please keep in mind that profit margins and incentives are also partly determined by whether

[26:03] it's a classic or deluxe model.

[26:06] In addition to higher incentives deluxe models will have all premium add-ons knocker shaker

[26:12] magic glass and art blades pre-installed.

[26:16] Plastic models however will no longer ship with any pre-installed add-ons starting with

[26:21] new orders placed after January 30th.

[26:24] We are still taking orders for add-on kits via our web store and distributors can purchase

[26:29] them at the distributor rate direct as well but they will be shipped and installed separately.

[26:36] Along with that American Pinball will now offer net 7 day, net 15 day and net 30 day

[26:42] financing upon approval.

[26:45] A detailed breakdown of the profit margin along with our new net 7 day, net 15 day and net

[26:51] 30 day approval based financing plans can be found in the distributor agreement.

[26:55] Regarding production our Legends of Vahala Limited Deluxe run is winding down and we

[27:01] have had some allocations open up for the final part of the run.

[27:05] If you would be looking to get any stock of Legends of Vahala Limited Deluxe please let

[27:10] us know and we can advise on the timeframe for shipping and get a sales order set up.

[27:15] In addition we wanted to inform you that Octoberfest has limited openings available for the last

[27:20] part of that run.

[27:22] Please inquire at your earliest if you are interested in stocking this one as supply

[27:27] is low and we are at the end of production currently.

[27:31] This title is not planned for more production in 2023 and if it does return to production

[27:37] in the future it is expected to go through some revisions as previously noted.

[27:43] Since this will be a potentially lengthy hiatus on this title please be sure to remove Octoberfest

[27:49] from your online advertising if your stock is depleted and we will not be taking new

[27:55] orders.

[27:56] However if you receive inquiries on Octoberfest or other titles it would be extremely helpful

[28:01] if that information can be shared so that we can continue having a clear picture of the

[28:07] current market and trends.

[28:09] Let me just stop there real quick American Mimble.

[28:11] You don't need to make more Octoberfest.

[28:13] The demand for Octoberfest is not coming back and you should just move on to the Dennis

[28:17] Norman title.

[28:18] Let's go on with Max's email.

[28:20] Production of Hot Wheels started on January 16th 2023.

[28:25] Expect receiving notifications regarding production updates as we see this run continuing through

[28:30] Q1 and possibly into Q2.

[28:33] Houdini is still planned to return to the production line in 2023 and we do not yet have a definite

[28:39] timeline mapped out.

[28:41] We are currently working through some supply chain issues to get that scheduled as soon

[28:46] as possible.

[28:47] We apologize for any unanticipated delays and appreciate your patience.

[28:52] Legends of the Hala Classic has started on the playfield line and those will be gradually

[28:57] shipping over the coming weeks.

[28:59] If you would be interested in a Legends of the Hala Classic or non-limited deluxe please

[29:05] let us know as soon as possible as we are projecting our numbers currently.

[29:10] We are looking to build a portion of those right away and we'll revisit those later on

[29:15] this year.

[29:16] Finally, our next game release is anticipated for March and we would like to set up a video

[29:21] conference in the coming weeks.

[29:23] We will keep you updated as more information becomes available.

[29:27] We value your business and your loyalty to our company.

[29:30] We are committed to continuing to provide high-end pinball machines to our customers

[29:35] and we hope that you will understand the need for the steps we have taken and appreciate

[29:40] our efforts to keep pricing as competitive as possible.

[29:44] If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

[29:48] Max at the American Pinball team.

[29:50] Alright, well look everyone, it's a tale of two companies.

[29:53] Stern is the huge juggernaut.

[29:55] Tons of legal speak indemnifying them.

[29:59] It's expected.

[30:00] Stern has so many dealers all over the world.

[30:03] Tens of thousands of games sold every year.

[30:06] They need to act that way.

[30:08] American Pinball, tiny Lutu Boutique company.

[30:11] I don't even think they've sold a thousand of any game ever.

[30:15] And look at the difference.

[30:16] They're much more personal.

[30:18] I hope you had a good weekend.

[30:19] I hope you had a good holiday.

[30:21] But again, like what American Pinball needs is a hit and I think the mistake I'm seeing

[30:25] in the American Pinball email is why are they even bothering to go back to the old games

[30:30] and the answer must be they have spare parts lying around.

[30:34] But this march is everything.

[30:35] If this Dennis Nordman game takes off, no one's going to want to order more legends

[30:40] of the Halla's or Houdini's or Hot Wheels.

[30:43] And definitely the demand for Oktoberfest is gone.

[30:46] Man, it's exhausting.

[30:48] I mean, I really feel for you distributors.

[30:50] You got to deal with all these different issues.

[30:52] You got to try to find pinball buyers as prices are going through the roof.

[30:56] And this was just a little sneak peek behind the curtain at both of these companies.

[31:01] I thought some of it was interesting.

[31:03] Some of it might have been boring, but I will be back Monday with a new episode of

[31:08] Canadian Pinball Podcast, and we will talk about everything going on in the pinball world.

[31:13] I really do hope we get some gameplay of Scooby-Doo.

[31:16] I don't think Jack Danger is going to do it because I think it's like the end of the month

[31:20] next Tuesday.

[31:21] Nothing is scheduled.

[31:23] And I really, really, really can't wait to see Scooby-Doo.

[31:27] I'm not going to premature indict this game on any level.

[31:31] I want to see it played.

[31:32] I want to see what the code is.

[31:34] I want to see how the gameplay is.

[31:35] And then I will start to give you a more objective first impression of the game.

[31:40] Everybody, thank you so much for being a member of the Canada Club.

[31:43] We've got no prizes, no giveaways.

[31:46] Just giving you stuff that no one else will tell you later.
