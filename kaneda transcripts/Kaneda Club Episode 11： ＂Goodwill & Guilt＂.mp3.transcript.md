[00:00] I got you to feed up.

[00:22] Welcome to episode 11 of the Canadian Club, the exclusive Canadian Spinball Podcast for

[00:28] contributors to the show.

[00:30] I'm going to do something a little bit different on this episode because I think this edition

[00:35] I'm going to say something that I think is really, really important.

[00:39] I hope all of you who contribute and there are a hundred and forty-nine people that contribute

[00:44] to Canadian Spinball Podcast on a monthly basis.

[00:47] I want to give a shout out to Dave S. J.G. James G. Nick S. Kevin O. Matt Gambit, 31-13

[00:58] and Christian R. You're the new contributors to Canadian Spinball Podcast in September,

[01:03] so thank you so much.

[01:05] But here's what I want to do on this club episode.

[01:07] I want to let everybody listen to this.

[01:10] And this is the only time I'm going to do this.

[01:13] I'm going to let those people who don't contribute in on an episode of Canadian Spinball

[01:18] Podcast, the club edition.

[01:20] And the reason I'm doing that is this episode and what I'm about to say, I think is really,

[01:25] really important.

[01:26] You know on my Canadian Club episodes, I like to go a little bit deeper.

[01:31] This is the only time I'm going to do it, so if you're contributing as a club member,

[01:35] don't worry.

[01:36] You're now not losing what you're contributing for.

[01:39] This is the only time we're going to do it.

[01:41] And it's because this topic means a lot to me.

[01:44] And the topic I want to talk about on this episode of the Canadian Club is this.

[01:49] I want to talk about how the enemy of progress can sometimes be goodwill.

[01:55] And I mean by that, when we have goodwill for a company or goodwill for people that we

[02:00] know in the pinball community, goodwill for people who are designers and artists and coders

[02:05] and manufacturers, sometimes that goodwill keeps us from giving people the right kind of

[02:13] feedback.

[02:14] And I call this the Jar Jar Binks Effect.

[02:16] And you know what I mean by the Jar Jar Binks Effect?

[02:19] It is how did everybody who worked on Star Wars episode one?

[02:23] How did everybody on the production crew on the set?

[02:27] How did nobody go to George Lucas and say, maybe you should rethink Jar Jar Binks?

[02:34] Maybe this is not working.

[02:35] And the Jar Jar Effect is a really interesting phenomenon.

[02:38] It happens when there is so much support for somebody and something that everybody is

[02:44] afraid to give their honest opinion about it.

[02:48] And I'm seeing the Jar Jar Effect right now happen in pinball in two areas.

[02:52] And I think everyone is scared to kind of voice how they really feel and give their opinion.

[02:57] I'm seeing it happen with the Godzilla art package and I'm seeing it happen with the

[03:02] Halloween pinball machine.

[03:04] And I know both of these companies, both of these companies, both spooky and stern have

[03:09] a tremendous amount of goodwill and they've earned it and they've done a lot of things

[03:15] in the past that we really love and they've built a following and a community that has

[03:20] a lot of support.

[03:22] Now the problem becomes if you try to say something that goes against that support you

[03:29] get attacked, you get silenced.

[03:32] And I'm really afraid that that's starting to happen more and more in pinball right now.

[03:37] It's almost as if certain people in the pinball world have immunity that there is no way

[03:43] to give them any feedback that there is nothing they can do that is wrong.

[03:48] And I want to talk about that on this episode and I know this is not a popular topic because

[03:53] if I bring this up and I start to chip away at some of the invincibility of these people

[04:00] and these companies that that is going to paint me in an unpopular light.

[04:05] But as you know, Canadian Spinball podcast has never shied away from sharing just what

[04:10] I'm feeling about what's going on in pinball.

[04:13] And I think if I'm feeling this and I'm sensing some of this then some of you might be sensing

[04:18] some of this and nobody ever gives you a voice.

[04:22] And that's always been the position of my show is that there is always that feeling deep

[04:26] down in the gut that sometimes people want to bury because they can't take it anywhere.

[04:32] And a couple things happen over the past week that I think brought this to the surface.

[04:35] We saw the Godzilla game.

[04:37] The game shoots amazingly well.

[04:39] The game is probably Keith Owens greatest game.

[04:42] It's one of the most packed games ever by Stern Pinball and Zambi Eddie put in our package

[04:47] in the game that has people very divided.

[04:50] So I want to talk about that and how we got there and could there have been a way for

[04:54] Stern Pinball to maybe to maybe figure out a way to please both parties.

[04:59] I want to talk about how we got there and how do you land on a Godzilla art package that

[05:04] is very bright.

[05:06] It's very colorful but it's not like anything I've seen in the Godzilla world and if that

[05:11] was a correct decision or a mistake to take such liberty in interpreting Godzilla artwork

[05:18] this way.

[05:19] I want to talk about that and I'm friends with Zambi Eddie and I think the detail is there.

[05:23] I think the hard work is there but I want to talk about it and I don't want to like brush

[05:27] it under the rug and make this a topic we can't discuss.

[05:31] And then I want to talk about spooky pinball's game Halloween because this is a game that

[05:35] came out at the right time.

[05:38] There was a lot of foam mode to get your hands on one.

[05:40] It's a game that nobody saw any gameplay footage.

[05:44] It's a game that nobody played before 1200 and 50 were sent to distributors and now that

[05:49] the game is starting to be played I've played it.

[05:52] I've noticed some things that need to be addressed and they're not little things.

[05:58] They are very big head scratcher things when it comes to the code and how the theme is

[06:03] being integrated into this pinball machine and I'm also noticing if you start to bring

[06:09] up questions about this game you get personally attacked right away.

[06:14] Go into the Halloween thread and look at what people are saying about me because I question

[06:18] the animations in the game and I question that insert that hedge multi-ball insert in

[06:24] which the insert does not carry over the entire word multi-ball.

[06:28] When it lights up it says hedge multi-ball.

[06:31] Okay, so I don't want to spend $9,000 and see hedge multi-ball.

[06:35] I want to spend $9,000 and see hedge multi-ball.

[06:39] But my ability to voice some concerns about that, about the lack of movie clips in the

[06:46] game, about how the game when you're playing it it stays on an animation for way too long.

[06:51] You don't feel like you're progressing through the movie itself.

[06:55] I want to be able to talk about these things without being attacked, without being insulted

[07:00] and I'm going to talk about these two games in a way that's not personally attacking

[07:05] Zambietti or spooky pinball but I just want to be able to have a conversation about these

[07:10] issues because these are real issues and people are discussing them and I just feel this

[07:16] overwhelming pressure not to talk about them that because Zambietti has good will, because

[07:22] spooky pinball has good will, we're not supposed to say how we might really really be feeling

[07:28] about this stuff that we just have to give them a pass.

[07:31] So let me start with Godzilla.

[07:33] Let me start with Godzilla.

[07:35] Now we know that spooky pinball really wanted to make this game.

[07:39] We know that spooky pinball chuck and bug were the biggest Godzilla fans ever and we also

[07:45] know that if you look at spooky pinball and you look at their trajectory, they were definitely

[07:50] heading down a road where they were going to make Godzilla pinball.

[07:54] Now do I think spooky pinball has the capability to make a Godzilla pinball machine as good as

[08:00] what Keith Elwin just made?

[08:03] Absolutely not.

[08:04] They're not there yet.

[08:05] They do not have the resources or the skill set yet to deliver the game that Stern pinball

[08:11] just put out into the market and Keith Elwin crushed it.

[08:14] The mechs are amazing, the flow is amazing, the gameplay is amazing, everything on the

[08:19] screen is amazing.

[08:20] The only thing that's dividing people is the artwork.

[08:24] So I want to talk about that.

[08:25] I want to talk about how everything else fell into place for Godzilla.

[08:30] But the artwork which is really colorful looks a lot like Ninja Turtles and Avengers sort

[08:35] of got together and had a baby called Godzilla.

[08:38] How did they land there?

[08:39] Now if you're approaching this art package and you Google image Godzilla and you just

[08:44] go and look at all the different Godzilla illustrated artwork that's out there, there's

[08:49] a lot of it.

[08:50] There's a lot of it and you could take Godzilla in a lot of directions.

[08:53] And the majority of it, right?

[08:55] The majority of the Godzilla artwork is not this super bright green interpretation of

[09:01] Godzilla.

[09:02] So right there, if you're going to make that decision to take him in that direction, you're

[09:06] going to go in a direction that is uncommon for this license.

[09:11] Now as a marketer, I have to ask myself, is it the smartest decision to take something

[09:15] people know and love and to bring it in a direction that's not very popular?

[09:21] Because if this was the popular way to showcase Godzilla, we would see more of it.

[09:26] And the other part that's interesting, if you just want to see what Godzilla might have

[09:29] looked like, if spooky pinball had maintained the license, they were working with an artist

[09:35] who's also well known for his Godzilla artwork.

[09:38] And that artist is Jeff Zorno, Z-O-R-N-O-W.

[09:44] And if you Google image Jeff Zorno Godzilla, because Jeff Zorno did the artwork for Alice

[09:49] Cooper's Nightmare Castle and you see what spooky's plan was, they were moving in

[09:54] the direction to get Jeff's Godzilla out into the world one day.

[09:58] It's never going to happen, but you can see his interpretation of the big King of the

[10:03] Monsters himself.

[10:05] And it's much darker, it's much more grayscale, there's much more contrast in the game.

[10:10] We can't go back, we can't unwind time, we can't undo this.

[10:14] It's hard to have the conversation about the artwork with Godzilla because we know Toho

[10:18] approved it.

[10:19] So the license holder of Godzilla approved it, but as I've heard from many people, Toho

[10:24] approves a lot.

[10:25] From a technical standpoint, the zombie at the artwork is still great, from a technical

[10:29] standpoint, the artwork is still phenomenal.

[10:32] It's just whether or not making Godzilla super bright and everything in the game super bright

[10:38] was the right direction to go in.

[10:40] There's something about it that immediately jumps out and is a little bit jarring and

[10:44] a little bit unsettling because it's all so bright.

[10:47] It's like every single thing happening on the play field is happening in direct sunlight.

[10:52] And I think Godzilla is a little bit darker.

[10:55] I think Godzilla calls for a little bit more contrast between his dark body and that bright

[11:01] blue beam he fires and the monsters and the fire.

[11:05] There's just something about it.

[11:06] And then if you think about this is Toho Godzilla and we're representing Godzilla over all

[11:11] of these previous decades, there's something about it that feels like it should be a little

[11:15] bit more old school feeling.

[11:16] I mean, I'm looking at all these Japanese Godzilla posters over the years.

[11:20] There's just something about it where it's just very bright.

[11:23] It's very colorful and it's just unlike anything I've seen or relate to when it comes to

[11:28] Godzilla.

[11:29] And that's the main point I want to make here.

[11:30] Is I know that zombie Eddie is probably the most talented pinball artist we've ever had.

[11:36] His work is incredible.

[11:37] And we know when he takes on a project that he wants to put his spin on it.

[11:42] And that's the point I want to talk about.

[11:44] And at what point, at what point when you're an artist or designer or you're Greg Ferris

[11:49] and you're standing over this thing, at what point do you allow your artist to have more

[11:54] freedom than the fan base wants that artist to have?

[11:58] And when you love a property, you don't want to see it take an in a direction that makes

[12:04] it unrelatable to you.

[12:06] And I think that's the big gamble they made here.

[12:08] Now I know the games are going to sell out.

[12:10] I know they're not going to have a problem moving units.

[12:13] But deep down inside in art package should reflect what you relate to with the property.

[12:19] And it should emotionally make you excited when you see it.

[12:22] And I'm just not sure that if you're a diehard Godzilla fan and you look at this, that

[12:27] you feel like it nailed it.

[12:29] Now look at Guns and Roses artwork.

[12:31] And what Dane Henry Jr. did, he represented Guns and Roses in skeleton form, fully illustrated

[12:38] skeleton form.

[12:39] And everything in that game looks just like the Guns and Roses skeleton forms that we

[12:45] grew up with.

[12:46] And so you look at the game and that's it, that's the slash I know, that's the axle I

[12:50] know, that's the Duff I know, that's the appetite for destruction monster I know.

[12:55] So everything there pays homage in a perfect way to the property you love.

[13:01] And if you look at Godzilla right now and I think that's the debate that rages on,

[13:05] if I love Godzilla, does this look like the Godzilla I know and love?

[13:10] And for most of the people who love Godzilla, the answer is no.

[13:13] So even saying this, I'm like nervous like, are they going to be mad at me?

[13:17] Are they going to be disappointed in me?

[13:19] Am I not going to buy the game because of this?

[13:21] The answer is I'm still buying this game.

[13:23] I still think the game looks like one of Stern's best ever.

[13:26] And I bet when I'm playing the game, I won't really notice it.

[13:29] I just wish there was nothing, nothing that divided people who love Godzilla when they

[13:34] look at the game.

[13:36] And at these price points, those expectations are there.

[13:39] Like we should have high expectations that when a company puts a property together, that

[13:44] the art package doesn't distract us from why we love the property, that the code has

[13:48] everything in it that we want to see, right?

[13:51] That the gameplay and the mix are bringing that theme to life.

[13:54] We should be demanding these things.

[13:56] And when these things fall somewhat short, I just want to let you know that it is okay

[14:02] for you to voice that you might not be in love with a certain aspect of the game.

[14:07] And you're going to get attacked and you're going to get challenged and it might be the

[14:11] unpopular opinion to have.

[14:13] And what if like Zombietti's art style just wasn't the right style for this game?

[14:19] It's okay, they tried it, they tried it, and this is what we got.

[14:23] And maybe a different art style would have sued it Godzilla better.

[14:27] And I don't know, right?

[14:28] I don't know what it would have looked like otherwise.

[14:30] But I do know, I do know that they took a chance and they went in a direction that has

[14:35] people divide it.

[14:37] And my wish is that we don't get here again.

[14:40] I don't think we should be here.

[14:41] This isn't a piece of artwork you're putting in the MoMA or a museum.

[14:46] Like you should not have so much freedom where what you do with a license could divide

[14:50] the audience that loves the property.

[14:52] I'm sorry.

[14:53] And this is where Greg Ferris needs to step up and say, look, we need to bring in Godzilla

[14:58] experts and maybe consult some of them on the art direction we're going in.

[15:03] And did they do that?

[15:05] See that's the question I wonder about is like, did they know who did they ask within

[15:09] the Godzilla fan world?

[15:12] Is this how he should look?

[15:14] Is this how he should feel?

[15:16] Is this how you would bring a Toho Godzilla world to life?

[15:20] I would have loved it if they used Charlie Emory as a consultant.

[15:23] That would have been such good PR for Stern.

[15:26] Like we're making the game, we're going to bring in Charlie Emory as a consultant to

[15:31] make sure we get all the elements right.

[15:34] Why not?

[15:35] You're not really competing with Charlie Emory on this game.

[15:37] You know that.

[15:38] They never would have done it.

[15:39] That would have been an amazing thing to do.

[15:42] Knowing that you had his dream license, it's a tiny little industry.

[15:46] It's a tiny little industry.

[15:48] Stern can make more games in three weeks than Spooky can all year.

[15:52] So we would not have hurt them at all to ask Charlie for his opinion on this game.

[15:58] Like did we nail it?

[15:59] Is this how Toho Godzilla should look?

[16:02] But I just want to be able to like have these conversations in a way that can be productive

[16:07] and we can do it as adults and not attack each other.

[16:10] I'm not attacking Zambi Yeti.

[16:11] I'm still buying the game.

[16:13] I just think this is a conversation I need to cover as the world's number one and favorite

[16:18] pinball podcast.

[16:19] Now artwork can't change once it's been decided upon.

[16:22] So this is it.

[16:23] Like this is the Godzilla package and it's not going to change.

[16:27] Now one thing that can change in a game is software.

[16:31] Now Spooky Pimball is Halloween game.

[16:33] Another game that came out this year that had a lot of fanfare.

[16:36] There was a lot of FOMO.

[16:38] It was the most games Spooky Pimball ever sold.

[16:41] 1250.

[16:42] A lot of us were wondering how do you take a horror movie like Halloween with a silent figure

[16:48] like Mike Myers and how do you translate a scary film into a pinball machine and then

[16:54] they revealed the game.

[16:56] The artwork was beautiful.

[16:57] It was very colorful like very colorful for a Halloween movie right?

[17:02] Very colorful for a Halloween theme integrated game and we didn't see much gameplay footage.

[17:07] Jack Danger played it a little bit and now the games are shipping the customers.

[17:11] I got to play it for a while and now it's quite clear that something is happening in

[17:16] the Halloween world and that is this.

[17:19] It's clear that they don't have that many assets from the movie.

[17:23] And so I'm just wondering if this is going to end up being another Willy Wonka in which

[17:28] we don't really get clips from the movie with voice actors from the movie synced up on

[17:35] the LCD screen.

[17:36] This is a great example of why the LCD screen can be great when you have all the assets

[17:43] but an LCD screen actually works against you when you don't because then it becomes

[17:49] how do we fill up the space if we don't have clips.

[17:53] And it's clear that spooky pinball is relying on animations to carry you through this game.

[17:59] So they need animations to bring you through the Halloween narrative and go look at the

[18:04] footage of the game.

[18:06] And I was speaking to Ryan who's doing the animations in this game and I was like look man,

[18:10] I gotta be honest, I'm not crazy about all the animations in the game and I think they

[18:15] would be better served if there were more movie clips mixed in.

[18:19] But this game is going to customers right now.

[18:22] So at what point are we allowed to be a little bit concerned that they might not have the

[18:27] rights to put a lot in this game.

[18:30] And then I see Luke over at spooky.

[18:32] He said the following.

[18:33] He said the clips range from roughly three to six seconds with that said we are absolutely

[18:39] going to request more request more.

[18:43] And it's like it's September.

[18:45] The game is shipping to people.

[18:47] Shouldn't you have all of your assets lined up before you start coding the game.

[18:52] Shouldn't you know everything you can work with.

[18:54] And if you had more, wouldn't they be putting it into the game on day one?

[18:59] And I'm just raising these questions and you know me, I love spooky.

[19:02] I'm buying Ultraman.

[19:04] Everything I'm about to say is going to stop me from supporting spooky and buying Ultraman.

[19:10] But I don't want my love of spooky to make me have to bury some issues I see with their

[19:17] game.

[19:19] Because the moment I start doing that, the moment I start holding back, some things I'm

[19:24] seeing because they came on my show or I'm friendly with them, that's the moment my

[19:29] show becomes irrelevant.

[19:31] It's the moment you should stop listening to me because then I'm doing favors for people.

[19:36] Then I'm not being objective.

[19:38] And Canadian Spinball Podcast always wants to be above that.

[19:42] I want to be more objective with these companies and I want to treat them all fairly, right?

[19:47] It's not fair for me to come on and like make fun of AP or P3 multi-morphic and then give

[19:53] spooky a pass because I like them as people.

[19:56] I do like them as people.

[19:57] But the only way spooky is going to get better is if each and every one of us gives them

[20:03] constructive feedback on their games.

[20:06] And right now, as I'm seeing it at $9,000, my biggest worry and I said this in my Facebook

[20:13] live and I'll say it again, is the Halloween software is letting the hardware down.

[20:19] The game shoots so well.

[20:21] It really does.

[20:22] It's a blast to shoot.

[20:24] But when I see what's on the screen and how the software in that game is developing and

[20:29] has developed, it's got a long way to go.

[20:33] And this is their first time ever coding a movie into a game.

[20:37] And I think Rick and Morty, Rick and Morty raised the bar for them.

[20:41] I mean, if you loved Rick and Morty, you were getting all of those clips from the Rick

[20:45] and Morty show dropped in perfectly.

[20:47] Those adventures were perfectly integrated into the game.

[20:51] And I'm playing Halloween and I'm seeing these animations frozen on the screen for so

[20:55] long and it's not working.

[20:58] That doesn't work.

[20:59] It doesn't make you feel like you're playing the Halloween movie or you're progressing

[21:03] through much of anything.

[21:05] But their approach and they've been saying this to me is they don't want there to be movie

[21:10] clips looping over and over again.

[21:12] I heard that same excuse from Jersey Jack about Willy Wonka.

[21:15] Well, we don't want to show you that over and over again and I'm here to tell you right

[21:18] now.

[21:19] That is the excuse you give when you don't have assets.

[21:23] That's the excuse you give when you don't have the rights to the stuff you want to put

[21:26] in the game.

[21:27] Look at the big Lebowski.

[21:29] Look at Batman 66.

[21:31] It loops stuff over and over again and it's amazing because that's what I want to see.

[21:36] I don't want to play a game based on my favorite movie and see animations that do nothing

[21:40] that make me feel like this isn't good enough.

[21:43] For $9,000, I think spooky needs to invest in their software department.

[21:48] They need to get more people on board.

[21:49] They need to make sure these animations are up to the standard of the industry now because

[21:55] they're charging nine to $10,000 for these games.

[21:59] And again, if you want to voice this, you're going to get attacked.

[22:03] If you want to say this isn't good enough, you're going to get attacked.

[22:06] And ultimately, all of us have the ultimate power, right?

[22:09] Because if you don't like it, you don't have to buy it.

[22:11] And I understand that.

[22:12] I absolutely understand that.

[22:14] But right now, I think there are a lot of people with Halloween deposits that are non-refundable.

[22:20] Remember that.

[22:21] These are non-refundable deposits.

[22:23] There are a lot of people that are anxious.

[22:26] There are a lot of people that aren't loving what they're seeing.

[22:30] They can't get out.

[22:31] They can't get their money back.

[22:32] And instead of voicing that they want more in the game, I think this is what's happening.

[22:37] They're falling back on the...

[22:39] Well, they're just going to figure it out and put it in.

[22:41] I'm here to tell you right now.

[22:42] And the response is, we're going to request more from the license holder.

[22:46] That doesn't make me feel like their strategy when they were making this game was to put a

[22:51] ton of movie clips in.

[22:53] And I really think the animations are the way they're going to go with this title.

[22:57] And then the question becomes, if you know you don't have access to the stuff you want,

[23:02] to the stuff you know needs to go into a pinball machine to make it work, then maybe don't

[23:07] make that theme.

[23:08] Like you can't make the Halloween movie like they made Jurassic Park.

[23:13] Like Stern did not have movie clips, so they went on an all new Jurassic Park adventure,

[23:18] if you will.

[23:19] But imagine if those Jurassic Park animations, which are pretty damn good by pinball standards,

[23:24] looked like the animations in Halloween.

[23:27] Would it have worked?

[23:28] No, it would not have worked for you.

[23:30] And Stern has way more people and way more resources working on their games.

[23:35] And now they're at the point now where the animations are really really good in a Stern

[23:39] machine.

[23:40] The animations are amazing in a Jersey Jack pinball machine and they're paying for that.

[23:44] They're getting what they pay for.

[23:46] And I think at this point, I want to tell Chuck and Luke and Bug and everyone over there,

[23:51] you have the greatest goodwill in pinball.

[23:54] And your prices are also at the point now where people are going to expect to see the

[23:59] quality, not just be on the play field, not just be on the shots, but they also want

[24:04] to see what's up on that screen, match the price of the game and they need to up it.

[24:09] I'm not saying it with anger, I'm not saying it to slam them, they just need to get what's

[24:14] on that screen to be better quality.

[24:16] We don't need to be a jerk when we tell them this, but this isn't how you integrate

[24:20] a movie like Halloween into a software package for a game like this.

[24:26] And I'll be the one who takes the arrows in the back.

[24:29] I'll be the one that everyone says, why isn't Canada just go away?

[24:32] I saw that in the Halloween thread.

[24:34] When I showed the image of the hedge multi-baw, you know what someone responded with?

[24:38] I just hope Canada goes away.

[24:41] Okay, let's just live in a world in which things that don't look right, when things that

[24:46] need to be pointed at are just forgotten and that's how we get to mediocrity in the

[24:51] world.

[24:52] Now you want mediocrity for 9 to $10,000 pinball machines, or should we get what we're

[24:56] paying for?

[24:58] And I don't care if I become unpopular, I don't care if other shows will be nice and

[25:03] not say this, I don't care.

[25:05] I want to just tell you that these two things and these two topics, people love zombie

[25:10] Eddie, I love zombie Eddie, people love spooky pinball, I love spooky pinball, but it doesn't

[25:16] mean that both of them are immune to making mistakes.

[25:20] And when they do make a mistake, I think we just have to find the right constructive and

[25:25] positive way to point it out so they don't do it again.

[25:29] They will learn from this, but they will only learn if we're able to communicate that

[25:34] they didn't quite meet our expectations.

[25:37] And they don't need to apologize and they don't need to go after every single troll because

[25:41] that's the other part that sucks.

[25:43] It's really hard to give constructive feedback because the trolls will just come out and

[25:47] say the artwork sucks or the code sucks or the animations suck, right?

[25:53] And that's the problem is, is when you try to go down this road of giving constructive

[25:57] feedback, you immediately open the door for all the haters to just pile in and say how

[26:02] much it sucks.

[26:03] Now, what I think these companies need to do, and I mean this, I think these companies

[26:07] need to start having some outside people throughout the development of these games, I think

[26:14] they need to have like a board of directors or a panel come in who's under NDA and gives

[26:20] them some feedback as they're making these games.

[26:23] And I'm throwing my name into the ring.

[26:25] I would love to consult on these pinball company machines as they're developing them, not

[26:31] spoiling the releases, not sharing stuff I know.

[26:34] It doesn't have to be canada, but they need to bring people in who can help guide them

[26:38] a little bit because I think they're all too close to it.

[26:41] I really do.

[26:42] I think they're all too close to it and I think they need some outside perspective and

[26:47] they don't get it until it's too late.

[26:49] And that's the thing.

[26:50] Like, okay, so you're telling me that the movie studio won't give us any clips or we

[26:55] don't have permission to use clips with voices at the same time.

[26:59] Maybe we shouldn't do this.

[27:00] I know you might love this theme, but maybe we shouldn't do this.

[27:04] And then I'm like, oh, I Google image, Godzilla, and everything I'm seeing Jeremy is like

[27:09] more darker, it's more gray, there's more contrast.

[27:12] Maybe we take this and we just altered a little bit and I think that's going to work much

[27:16] better for everybody.

[27:17] You know, just some of that simple feedback along the road and I just don't think they

[27:21] get it and I think it would benefit everybody because I think deep down we all know this.

[27:27] Once a pinball machine is made, once it's done, that's it.

[27:31] Like, there's usually no chance to fix it.

[27:34] There's no chance to course correct it and you shouldn't have to.

[27:37] It's not that hard to get all the elements into a pinball machine the way they should be.

[27:42] You're telling me it's that hard to make a game like Big Lebowski?

[27:46] Why is it that hard?

[27:47] If Dutch pinball can do it, just bury in Yop can do it and take the Big Lebowski and

[27:51] make it perfectly, why are we still having to compromise?

[27:56] Guns and roses is perfect.

[27:58] Pire to the Caribbean is not.

[28:00] There's no assets in it from the movies we love.

[28:02] I just think for the amount of money these games are, we shouldn't have to compromise

[28:07] stuff.

[28:08] We shouldn't have to look at them and just live with it.

[28:11] That's the thing, right?

[28:12] It's not hard.

[28:13] Take a theme that people want.

[28:15] What mechs on the play field that reflect what that theme is about?

[28:20] Make artwork that makes people emotionally get excited about the theme they love and make

[28:25] it shoot well and have some good call outs and call it a day.

[28:30] These companies are making millions of dollars on these products and we shouldn't have to

[28:35] sort of look at these machines and become apologists and make excuses.

[28:40] We should be able to say they nailed it.

[28:42] They nailed it.

[28:43] There's nothing I would change on this game.

[28:45] Here's the part I'm going to end with this.

[28:47] It's all subjective.

[28:49] Some people might think they nailed Godzilla.

[28:51] Some people might think they're nailing Halloween and that's okay.

[28:55] This isn't a very serious topic.

[28:57] It's pinball machines.

[28:58] It's not life and death.

[29:00] Ultimately, as buyers, it's our decision whether or not we want to go in on any of these

[29:04] things.

[29:05] If you turn off the FOMO, if you turn off the FOMO, you'll be able to see if they really

[29:11] did nail it according to your expectations of the theme.

[29:15] For those of you on Halloween, I think you guys might be taken by the FOMO because now

[29:20] it's too late.

[29:21] You've already committed and you might not be seeing what you love.

[29:24] If Ultraman ends up being the better integrated game, I'm not just saying that because I have

[29:29] Ultraman.

[29:30] I keep hearing people saying, he's going to slam Halloween and pump Ultraman because

[29:34] he's going to sell his Ultraman.

[29:35] I'm not selling my Ultraman.

[29:38] I am still going to have Godzilla next to Ultraman next to Guns and Roses.

[29:43] Those three machines will be in my home, but I want to be able to have this conversation

[29:49] without being attacked.

[29:51] I think this hobby needs to have a place in which we can openly discuss these issues without

[29:57] being attacked.

[29:59] This is the Canadian Club.

[30:00] For those of you who agree with what I just said or are glad that there's someone out

[30:04] there on the pinball airwaves saying stuff like this, I hope you think it about the

[30:08] game without contributing to Canadian pinball podcast.

[30:10] I really do.

[30:11] If you go to Patreon under Canadian pinball, I have thousands of people that listen to

[30:16] every single episode of Canadian pinball podcast and we are up to the point where there's

[30:21] a 149 Patreon contributors each month.

[30:26] And I know there's so many of you that enjoy this show.

[30:29] You've enjoyed it for years.

[30:30] So please, if you want to show your support, go to Patreon, canada pinball at gmail.com

[30:35] and you'll get more club episodes like this.

[30:37] For those of you in on the club, thank you so much.

[30:40] It means so much to me killing and Brenda that you contribute to the show.

[30:44] And this is it.

[30:45] They are never going to get another club episode like this.

[30:47] I just wanted to tell them what they're missing out on when they're not part of the Canadian

[30:51] club.

[30:52] Everybody.

[30:53] Let's get the best pinball machines we can with no compromises, all right?

[30:57] Later.
