[00:30] There are no two words that equal blockbuster theme more than Star Wars.

[00:44] It is 2 o'clock in the morning.

[00:46] I'm Canada and I decided to wake up and do episode 51 of Canada's Pinball Podcast and

[00:52] talk about the theme that we all know is coming and I want to talk about some of the rumors

[00:58] surrounding this title.

[00:59] I want to talk about what I think this title's effect will have on the pinball market and

[01:06] I want to talk about some of the stuff I've been hearing and something that you all should

[01:12] rush to do tomorrow if you haven't already when it comes to Star Wars pinball which we

[01:17] all know is coming.

[01:19] So let's talk about it.

[01:21] But before I wanted to address something that I've been reading on the forums and that

[01:26] is whether or not Stern has fixed the play field issues with Ghostbusters and I see people

[01:33] speculating back and forth in this and I just want to clarify from what I've known and

[01:37] what I've seen.

[01:40] As of August 24th builds there was still a little ghosting insert on Ghostbusters Ellie

[01:50] that I played.

[01:53] But I also said in that podcast that I went around and I looked at every single pinball

[01:58] machine I was in the place and ghosted inserts no matter what you have you're going to

[02:03] get of probably a few inserts that ghost on your machine.

[02:09] It's just part of pinball play field right?

[02:13] And then the question is if you have a few ghosted inserts is that area for concern and should

[02:20] you get a new play field.

[02:21] I don't think so.

[02:23] As I said a beautiful CPR gold tells the Ruby nice play field and there are a few inserts

[02:28] that have a little bit of ghosting on it.

[02:30] It's not creating an issue when I rub my hand over that area.

[02:33] The insert's not lifted.

[02:35] There's no play field clear coat chipping.

[02:39] If there are a few games I think there are a few games that have clear coat chipping and

[02:43] I think Stern will fix those games that are really bad.

[02:48] I think the majority of people are not going to qualify for a play field swap and I don't

[02:54] think it's that big of an issue.

[02:56] I think pinside has a tendency to take five people's games, ten people's games who have

[03:03] severe issues and make it sound like everyone's having issues.

[03:07] That being said I definitely know there was an issue with what Stern was getting from

[03:12] their manufacturer of their play fields and they said they fixed the issue.

[03:18] I think what that means is they are confident you are not going to get play field chipping

[03:24] occurring on your machine.

[03:25] It doesn't mean that they've solved an issue that has plagued play fields since the beginning

[03:32] of pinfield play fields and that's a little bit of ghosting on some inserts every now

[03:36] and then.

[03:37] If you get that don't think you've got a subpar product.

[03:41] Let's just close it on that topic.

[03:44] I don't know if they fixed the clear coat chipping issue.

[03:48] I'm confident they have but we will see.

[03:52] My ghostbusters Ellie still has not arrived.

[03:55] It is what September 10th today.

[03:59] So I'm hoping I have a September build so we'll see what happens.

[04:05] That's that.

[04:06] We have to do a little moment of silence for Rare Hero.

[04:10] He has informed me that he will never do this show after my last podcast and he wants

[04:16] me to remove him from my email list.

[04:19] So let's have a few seconds of silence for Rare Hero who has had enough with Hernandez

[04:23] Pinball podcast.

[04:24] Greg, I know you're listening and this moment of silence is for you.

[04:30] I don't know why.

[04:33] People, they oftentimes, they tell me they think it's unfair that I call them out on

[04:40] this podcast and I just it boggles my mind because if you if you're a hyper poster on

[04:46] Pinside and you say tons of stuff, I think your words should be usable in my podcast.

[04:55] I'm not putting words in people's mouths.

[04:58] I am not making this stuff up and I think Greg just needs to calm down and I know Greg

[05:05] is a nice guy and I've talked to him and we have good banter back and forth and I think

[05:10] he just gets over excited and just can't stop himself and it's interesting too because

[05:17] after he heard my podcast, I was curious.

[05:20] I'm like, well, what's he going to do?

[05:21] What's he going to do?

[05:22] And I went on Pinside and he just kept posting all day long all throughout the day and

[05:27] it's indicative of, you know, people who are obsessed with Pinside to go on every day

[05:32] and post 50 times a day, they really, they get themselves into these things.

[05:40] Like situations where they're just obsessed with the hobby to the point where they make

[05:46] absolutely no sense.

[05:47] So Greg, look, no hard feelings, man.

[05:49] I really think you should just take a chill pill, wait for your ghost buster's premium,

[05:53] play it, enjoy it.

[05:54] It's a fun pin.

[05:55] Everyone who has it enjoys it and you'll be happy, all right?

[05:58] Stop worrying about it so much.

[05:59] All right, let's talk about Star Wars because this is the point of this podcast.

[06:03] So what do we know about Star Wars?

[06:05] So there's a few things I know.

[06:07] There's a few rumors and then there's my speculation on what Star Wars will do to this hobby.

[06:13] So I want to talk about those three things.

[06:16] So here's what we know about Star Wars, almost nothing, right?

[06:19] This pin is pretty much speculation times speculation.

[06:26] So we know that Steve Richie is designing it.

[06:29] I mean, that is, that is a given.

[06:30] I've heard that multiple times for many people.

[06:32] We know that Lyman is coding it.

[06:34] That's what I've heard.

[06:35] So we have Richie and Lyman on Star Wars and you have Stern making it.

[06:41] So other than that, we know absolutely nothing about this pin.

[06:46] We don't know when it's going to come out.

[06:48] The rumor was Star Wars was supposed to come out this December.

[06:53] But with all of the delays and issues at Stern this year, Star Wars has been pushed back.

[06:58] So I think it's pretty much a guarantee that the next pin we are going to see from Stern

[07:05] which will probably be a December January announcement will be Erosmith.

[07:11] I think Stern is, it sucks that they're going to miss a December reveal of Star Wars

[07:17] because of all the attention that Rogue One is going to get when it opens up in December.

[07:22] But I don't know if Stern is going to maybe surprise us with the Star Wars announcement

[07:30] in December for orders and ship the game in February because if I'm Stern and this is

[07:36] what people, they always, you know, as much as Stern's releases ship because they're

[07:42] waiting on parts, the development of the game doesn't delay, right?

[07:47] So I still think Star Wars could be pretty much fully developed and ready to go and is ready

[07:54] for reveal.

[07:55] I see people, I'm sorry to sidetrack here, but I see people in the Batman 66 thread

[08:00] being like, oh man, Stern's rushing this one out and they're going to, you know, from

[08:06] the flyer to November, they only have two months to make the game.

[08:09] Just like, literally, this is where I just want to bang my head against the wall.

[08:13] People Stern is not developing Batman in two months.

[08:16] This game has been developed over like a year or so and the game is pretty much done.

[08:21] They're not going to have this big 30th birthday party at Expo and a big reveal in a party

[08:26] with Adam West and show up with a game that's like a white wood.

[08:29] This game is done probably.

[08:32] There's probably little tweaks here and there and they're teasing it out now.

[08:35] I mean, look, all the parts are coming and they're showing like plaques, they're showing

[08:38] things on Facebook, but Stern doesn't do this, right?

[08:42] They're not, they're not going to put themselves in a situation where once the marketing is

[08:47] turned on, the game is going to be delayed.

[08:50] That's not the case.

[08:51] The only thing that can delay it maybe is if there's like a vendor issue, but I think

[08:55] Stern is fully aware that Batman is far along and ready to ship, right, at this moment.

[09:02] So we know that Star Wars push back.

[09:06] We know that here's the thing and this is the thing that I think everyone needs to like

[09:13] listen and go do something tomorrow if you want this pinball machine and listen closely.

[09:18] Do you know how Batman Ellie seem to have sold out in one day?

[09:23] And I'll tell you why Batman Ellie sold out in one day.

[09:25] It's because distributors were taking deposits and creating list of people who wanted one

[09:32] well before that fire hit, right?

[09:35] Once the rumor of a pinball machine starts, distributors start building a list.

[09:40] So I'm not going to name names here, but I went to a distributor that is probably one of Stern's

[09:45] biggest and most well known and I said I would like Star Wars Ellie.

[09:51] And here's what I was told.

[09:52] I was told Chris, you might want to go elsewhere.

[09:57] I already have 70, 70 deposits down on Star Wars Ellie and I'm not even charming to get

[10:05] that many.

[10:06] So you be wise to go somewhere else.

[10:09] All right, so let me just stop there.

[10:11] This title has never been announced.

[10:14] No one even knows when it's coming out.

[10:16] And already one of the main distributors is saying I probably am not going to get even

[10:23] enough Ellie's to fulfill the orders I already have on it.

[10:28] And I was shocked.

[10:29] I was absolutely shocked.

[10:30] And I wasn't surprised, right?

[10:33] So what I did was I went around to different distributors and I asked throughout the day

[10:38] and look, the policy by Stern is people distributors are not allowed to take deposits and pre-orders

[10:44] on titles that haven't been announced yet.

[10:48] But really, I mean, let's be honest here, that's not going to stop someone from going to

[10:53] their distributor and saying like put me on a list for every new Stern Ellie that comes

[10:57] out and just call me.

[10:58] And so every distributor has a list of just mostly names and numbers and emails and it's

[11:05] like this is the list for Star Wars, right?

[11:08] And so I called around and every distributor I called had a list.

[11:12] And some were at like in the 20s, somewhere in the 30s.

[11:16] But everybody had a long list of people who are already online for Star Wars.

[11:21] So if you want to Star Wars Ellie and you have not done anything yet and you are one of

[11:25] the, you know, I think the sort of the practical pin side and pinball collector out there who's

[11:32] like I want to see something before I put an order in.

[11:34] If Star Wars is a theme you love and who doesn't love Star Wars, you should tomorrow call

[11:41] around and just get on a list.

[11:43] Just get on a list because you will probably be shut out if you wait.

[11:48] And I think Star Wars will be sold out before it's ever announced.

[11:52] I think it's probably close at this point to already being sold out.

[11:56] We don't know what the Ellie numbers are, but I do know that there are not many distributors

[12:02] out there that have a low number left of what order you be if you put your Star Wars

[12:11] order in tomorrow.

[12:12] So I think if you are listening to this podcast now and you want Star Wars, I think tomorrow

[12:16] lock in with your distributor because it's getting to the point where hot themes are

[12:20] going to sell before they ever even hit the distributor or hit the dealership that we're

[12:25] talking about a car.

[12:27] So what do I think of that?

[12:28] What do I think about this title already possibly being sold out?

[12:32] So I think that we are about to enter a completely new era of pinball when it comes to collectibility.

[12:40] So it's clear from Batman, it's clear from Ghostbusters that when there is a very popular

[12:47] theme and there is a very popular title that there's more demand than there will be supply

[12:53] that the price of the machine is up in the air, right?

[13:00] There's an MSRP price and there's a street price and I'm going to use a car you

[13:04] mean because as much as levy and other people out there I think that comparing pinball

[13:09] to cars is not relevant.

[13:12] It is because when you have a hot car, I want to use the Ford GT350R, right?

[13:19] It's the new Shelby, but it's the R edition, right?

[13:21] It's limited.

[13:22] They're not making many of the R edition.

[13:24] They're making much more than 350 regulars.

[13:27] If you go on eBay right now, the 350R retails for about $60,000.

[13:34] It's selling on the second hand market for around $100,000.

[13:39] What happens is dealerships know that the product is really hot and I think dealerships are

[13:44] like distributors.

[13:46] Dealer ships know that the product is really hot and dealerships tack on in a justed price

[13:53] because of market demand and usually they'll be like $20,000 extra if you want to drive

[13:59] the car away.

[14:01] And so it begs the question, if a game like Star Wars, let's just hypothetically say Star

[14:07] Wars Ellie is 10 grand, but they're going to make, let's say they make 500 Ellie's and

[14:17] a thousand people want them and they're 10 grand.

[14:21] What happens?

[14:22] So is Stern going to enforce that distributors sell them for just $10,000 or will distributors

[14:32] start doing what dealerships do and say, look, instead of letting consumers do what they're

[14:37] doing now, because here's what's happening now.

[14:40] When distributors have like 70 people with a deposit of like a hundred bucks, it's refundable

[14:44] or whatnot, all people are doing is putting down a refundable deposit and flipping it.

[14:51] You can put down right now $500 each on each order with a distributor and get five examples

[15:01] of Star Wars Ellie and keep one for yourself and flip for them and flip them for profit.

[15:13] The thing is, I think distributors or Stern has to figure out a way where that money goes

[15:19] to one of them versus the customer because it's too easy to deal it right now.

[15:24] It was too easy for me.

[15:26] With Ghostbusters Ellie, especially, I put $100 down and I was able to get an Ellie and

[15:32] I know guys who, the Ellie is so much better than the premium in terms of the looks.

[15:36] The premium is fine, the artwork is great, but the green on the Ellie is amazing.

[15:41] I think the Ellie is the one that everyone really wants, but I was able to get one with

[15:45] a hundred bucks and I know I could easily sell that game for $1,000 more than I paid.

[15:53] Stern doesn't see that money, the distributor doesn't see that money and just because I

[15:57] came in early with a check.

[15:59] I think we're going to reach a point where distributors are going to start adjusting the price

[16:05] based on the man.

[16:06] I think Stern's going to have to allow them to do that because I just don't think you

[16:14] can allow customers to do what they're doing now, which is, you know, put hardly anything

[16:20] down and then make money and no one else sees it.

[16:23] It's interesting what they do with Batman because they tried to say, like, I heard Go Man

[16:27] talk and he was like, we think if we ask for $2,000 down, we won't see as much flipping

[16:34] on the product, but that's, they're still refundable deposits.

[16:39] So it doesn't matter if people put $2,000 down, they're not stupid.

[16:43] They know that they're going to make money.

[16:45] If you have a Batman LA, I think there's a good chance you'll be able to sell it and

[16:50] the rumors are true that they're only making 500 premiums of that title.

[16:54] I mean Batman could become one of the most rarest Sterns of all time and just collectible

[16:59] in general.

[17:00] So, you know, we'll see.

[17:02] So look, Star Wars is, I think, is going to be sold out well before we ever hear about

[17:07] it.

[17:09] That leads me to the next thing and that is, isn't it interesting right now?

[17:14] I think we're tinkering on the error of Sterns that are going to be $10,000, $12,000.

[17:22] Isn't that nuts?

[17:25] And why is Stern able now to sell a pinball machine around 10 grand?

[17:30] What happened?

[17:32] And one thing happened.

[17:34] The boutique industry showed Stern what was out there.

[17:39] Stern was just going to keep cranking out titles between like $5,000 and $7,000 and they were

[17:45] just going to stay at that price range and they were making profit at that price range.

[17:51] But what the boutique industry showed Stern?

[17:54] And when I say boutique, I mean John Papaduke, I mean Jersey Jack, I mean Dutch pinball,

[18:04] all these new to the game players showed Stern one thing and one thing only, that there

[18:09] is a lot more money in the pockets of pinball collectors than you're charging.

[18:16] And if you're shifting your business model from an operator's game to a collector's

[18:22] game, then you can charge a lot more, a lot more for your product and you can control the

[18:31] price with one thing and one thing only and that thing is marketing.

[18:36] As much as you guys sometimes think that marketing is a joke and you know, jody's a fool

[18:44] or Stern doesn't know what they're doing and they don't know the quality, it's all marketing.

[18:49] Marketing takes into account how many of each variation are we going to offer and if we

[18:57] do this, we can charge this.

[18:59] Like that's marketing.

[19:01] And I think the first company and when I say boutique who proved that marketing can save

[19:07] a title and even save a company, it was spooky with America's most honoured.

[19:12] America's most honoured was not selling.

[19:14] As much as people, you know, the game is like, the game is the game, it's not the best

[19:19] game ever, it's not the worst game ever.

[19:21] I think it's just like, it's a decent game, but it wasn't selling at all and it only

[19:26] sold the moment they said we're only going to make 150 of these and the second they did

[19:30] that it sold out.

[19:33] Sold out and that's marketing.

[19:34] That is strictly a marketing decision to control the supply and all of a sudden the demand

[19:40] spiked.

[19:41] And then what happened, right?

[19:43] America's most honoured on the secondary market, a new inbox started going for like 8,000.

[19:50] Right?

[19:51] So I think there was almost 9,000 for one of the later editions and if you're Stern and

[19:56] you're like, wait a minute.

[19:58] People are paying 9,000 dollars for this home brew pinball machine that has like a tenth

[20:05] of the innovation that we're putting into our machines and we're charging 6,500 for

[20:10] us, 7,000.

[20:13] Simply because they think this is rare and there's not going to be that many.

[20:17] Well then, shit, let's just make, you know, our titles scarcer.

[20:23] So the boutique industry basically showed Stern what they could charge and look, I think

[20:29] we're at the level now and I've been saying this but within the next year and a half, I

[20:35] think we're going to see Stern sell pinball machines that could be 15 grand.

[20:39] I think we could see Stern sell machines that could be 20 grand.

[20:44] You can't tell me that if Stern said, look, we're going to make a Star Wars edition and

[20:48] I was saying this, we're going to make a Star Wars edition where there's only 20 of a

[20:52] special variation for 20 grand.

[20:55] You can't tell me that those ones sell.

[20:57] They would sell.

[20:58] They would sell immediately.

[21:00] They would sell out immediately and I think we're going to see more of that and this is

[21:05] the new error of like collectible machines and I think to get that demand going, you

[21:13] need to make, you know, certain variations special, you need to limit supply.

[21:19] If Stern's going to make like three to four titles a year, that's a lot.

[21:26] So that's the other issue that I keep scratching my head and trying to figure out.

[21:31] You can't release like four extremely hot titles a year as collectibles and sustain it.

[21:42] It's just too much.

[21:44] It's too much.

[21:45] Star Wars Buster is his blockbuster but it already feels like Ghost Buster is his,

[21:50] it's sort of like yesterday's hype with Batman and then after Batman, Star Wars is going

[21:57] to take over Batman stage and how much can Stern continue to like create demand around

[22:07] these products if it's just going to keep having huge title off the huge title.

[22:14] You know, it's to use like video games as an analogy, Rockstar Games releases Grand

[22:21] Thaft Auto that everybody wants but they release it like every like four years.

[22:26] You know, there's time in between.

[22:29] There's not a lot of time in between these hot Stern titles and meanwhile the competition

[22:34] has nothing coming out.

[22:36] It's almost like I don't know why Stern, even if Stern just released one blockbuster

[22:40] title a year, just one.

[22:43] It would still be so far ahead of the competition's ability to make another pen.

[22:48] Right?

[22:49] I mean, it takes like Jersey Jack, it takes highway, it takes spooky years to come out with

[22:55] like an additional title and nobody has like two titles on the line really at the same

[23:00] time.

[23:01] And Stern's got nine or ten on the line.

[23:04] So it's going to be interesting.

[23:07] I think that we keep hearing like, well the bubble burst, will there be like, is this

[23:13] going to the point where it's ridiculous?

[23:14] I don't think so.

[23:16] I've said it before.

[23:17] Pinball collectors now are very rich people.

[23:21] These are guys who are getting paychecks that are like ten grand at paychecks.

[23:27] All right?

[23:28] So that what is that?

[23:29] Like people are making like half a million dollars a year and that's just, I mean look,

[23:32] it's this 2016 people are making millions of dollars a year.

[23:36] People have investments that have gone up lots of money.

[23:40] I know a lot of people personally that if they were to not collect expensive watches or

[23:45] cars, they could easily go in on every new inbox machine and they would, and these are

[23:51] guys that want the best shit out there.

[23:54] These are guys who drink expensive bottles of cognac.

[23:58] These are guys that they want what others don't have because they like to flaunt their

[24:04] success and if you're a pinball collector and you want to have one of few, you are going

[24:11] to want a limited thing and Stern's not stupid.

[24:15] And the super le is genius.

[24:17] As much as you guys hate it, it's genius.

[24:20] You know, so I heard another rumor and this is an interesting rumor.

[24:24] I don't think this is true but I want to just put it out there.

[24:26] So I heard a rumor that Stern is going to make Star Wars le for every movie.

[24:33] So there's going to be an Ellie edition for a new hope for Return of the Jedi for

[24:38] Empire Strikes Back and they're basically going to have a variation for each film.

[24:46] And I heard it and I was like, no, it doesn't make any sense.

[24:50] How would they do that?

[24:51] You'd have to actually have different art for each.

[24:55] I can't see that.

[25:00] And then I was confused too.

[25:03] What would the theme be?

[25:04] Would it be all those plus the Force Awakens?

[25:08] And then you're getting the Trilogy's Everyone Loves plus the new one.

[25:13] And I don't know how that really works.

[25:16] In terms of goals and objectives, I just don't see it.

[25:19] I think this is going to be Force Awakens.

[25:21] I think there's going to be Force Awakens.

[25:23] Ellie, I think there will probably be a light side and a dark side.

[25:27] Ellie edition, sort of like your Magneto and your Wolverine X-Men.

[25:32] I think that makes sense to me.

[25:34] I think 250 of each of those makes sense to me.

[25:37] I know the demand is well higher than that.

[25:41] But if I'm stern, you know, you can't, they're never going to do like a thousand of the

[25:44] Ellie's.

[25:46] I just think that's stupid because if you look at what Jack does and that's what he does,

[25:50] he offers too many Ellie's and then there's not enough demand for it.

[25:53] There's not enough demand.

[25:54] So look, Star Wars is going to be the hottest pin when it's announced.

[26:00] I got to say personally, I'm going to go on the record for saying this.

[26:06] I don't want it to just be like a richy flow pin without amazing toys and amazing things.

[26:12] I've said this before.

[26:14] I just, I think the pinball machine needs to have more magic and more toys, more

[26:18] mech and not just be like flowy ramps, like Star Trek or Game of Thrones.

[26:23] I'm sorry, but I think this game in particular, there's so much stuff that would make for cool

[26:30] mechs and lower play field options and upper play field options and like toys and BB8

[26:36] rolling around and Kylo Ren forced grabbing the ball with magnets and moving it around.

[26:41] I think it needs to be more of that and less just like flow and stacking modes and all

[26:47] that shit.

[26:48] I mean, make it magical when it comes to it.

[26:50] So if I were to guess at when Star Wars is going to come out, I would say, I think they're

[26:58] going to probably reveal it in February and it's going to be an early 2017 game.

[27:07] That's my guess.

[27:08] We'll see.

[27:09] Alright, so let's talk about a couple other things that I've been saying on the forum.

[27:15] For you guys who are waiting to hear my interview with a gentleman who worked on Magic

[27:20] Girl, it's just been delayed.

[27:22] He's been really busy.

[27:24] We're going to get that soon and I'm also going to talk to Black Knight about the creation

[27:28] of Big Bang Bar hopefully next weekend.

[27:30] So that is also on the book.

[27:33] So one of the, another sci-fi title that I think is really interesting is Alien and we've

[27:39] been like the rest of you waiting to see more from Alien.

[27:43] So the news this week was that Andrew Highway has asked people for their second payment.

[27:51] So for those of you who don't know, like Alien took a pre-order, I believe I want to

[27:57] say it was like 1500 bucks was what you put down that was refundable or a thousand dollars.

[28:04] I forget which one it was.

[28:06] But when the game got closer to production, they would ask you for another payment and

[28:13] emails were going out this week asking people for that second payment and people got all

[28:17] excited.

[28:18] I mean they're like, okay we're close.

[28:20] And Andrew is saying that we are two to three weeks away from production.

[28:26] And, you know, so here's the thing.

[28:28] He's asking for this second payment and yet the game has not been fully approved yet by

[28:34] Fox.

[28:35] They're confident it will be.

[28:37] And I still just think it's getting to the point where people are saying, I want to see

[28:44] something first before I make another payment.

[28:47] And I think those people are right.

[28:50] And I think we're going to see something very soon.

[28:52] So I think people are going to be able to see something in the next two to three weeks

[28:57] that basically like reveals the game.

[28:58] Like we haven't seen anything on this game other than Orricks Playfield Art and the

[29:03] Cabin Art and some little snid bits of it in videos and there's like, it's weird because

[29:12] sometimes there's like the stand up banners at X-Bose and shows where you can kind of see

[29:18] what's on the Playfield but nothing really.

[29:20] I know Andrew's shown some videos behind the scenes but Ali and still to me has been sort

[29:25] of like a question mark of what it's going to be.

[29:29] So we're going to see that soon and it's going to be very, very interesting because in

[29:33] one corner we're going to Batman 66 at X-Bose and we're going to have Alien and I think

[29:37] those are going to be the two titles that are going to be compared to each other.

[29:42] I think they're going to be compared in terms of fun factor.

[29:44] I think they're going to be compared in terms of how are people using LCDs and games and

[29:49] overall package and design.

[29:52] So we're going to see.

[29:54] My thing about Alien and I think this whole pen comes down to one thing and one thing

[29:58] only is how fun is it going to be.

[30:02] And I know they're going for something that hasn't really been done before in Pimball

[30:07] and that is can you accomplish this sort of space thriller, right?

[30:14] This, I mean if you look at the Alien movies it's not like upbeat like Star Wars, doesn't

[30:18] have like the theme song that like get your blood boiling.

[30:23] It's a space like thriller.

[30:26] It's space horror really and it's like slow sort of plotting movie that grips you with

[30:33] like suspense and fear and terror, right?

[30:37] Are those things that they can evoke in a Pimball machine?

[30:40] And that's what I'm most curious about.

[30:43] You know, I'm not going to speculate.

[30:45] I wonder if they can accomplish that because that is to me what's going to make this

[30:50] pin work or not work is how much do you feel that sort of suspense and that sort of thrill

[30:57] of trying to survive in outer space playing a Pimball machine?

[31:03] You know certain video games can accomplish that in terms of creating that atmosphere,

[31:07] but I think it's really hard for a Pimball machine to create that kind of atmosphere

[31:11] for the player.

[31:13] It hasn't really been done before.

[31:15] So there's like the Horde mode and walking dead that kind of gets there where your zombies

[31:21] are attacking you and you're trying to survive and I think Lyman coded that brilliantly.

[31:29] We've seen it kind of work nicely.

[31:32] Can Alien get there?

[31:34] I'm still not a fan of like the highway package, like the big bezel.

[31:39] It still just turns me off.

[31:41] I just don't know why they did it that way.

[31:45] I still think the pin stands out awkwardly amongst the lineup with the back box and the

[31:49] bezel like that and I think they would have been smarter to make it look like normal Pimball.

[31:55] But look, we're going to see a lot in two to three weeks and we're going to have a lot

[31:58] more discussion on this Pimball machine.

[32:01] So what else have I been hearing?

[32:02] I've been hearing that the Hobbit isn't selling very well and what does that mean for

[32:08] JJP?

[32:09] Now look, we all speculate about what are the sales figures for companies and nobody

[32:15] knows.

[32:16] Nobody really knows what is true and what is not true.

[32:21] I mean I think that you know the Hobbit is a theme that is it's mediocre and I think

[32:29] everyone can agree that films were like kind of mediocre especially compared to Lord

[32:33] the Rings.

[32:35] And so with the pin coming out so much later than the movies and knowing that culturally

[32:40] people like really are not huge fans of that film, I think it's a tough self for Jack.

[32:44] I think the Hobbit is probably doing all right for them.

[32:47] It's not the home run that they probably need it for game two.

[32:51] I definitely don't think the Hobbit is more successful than Wizard of Oz.

[32:56] I definitely don't think they're going to sell as well as Wizard of Oz and I think that's

[33:02] going to force Jack to go to game three sooner than later.

[33:05] And that begs the question, will we see Lawler's game at Expo?

[33:08] And I say, I'm like really making up my mind right now as I say this, I think we are not

[33:20] going to see Lawler's game at Expo.

[33:22] And that's just the marketer in me speaking because I just don't think it makes sense yet

[33:26] for Jack to do that.

[33:28] I think he might tease some stuff but I think once Lawler's game is shown, I think all

[33:35] dollars are going to shift from Hobbit to Lawler because I think Jersey Jack has fan

[33:40] boys, right?

[33:41] I think Jersey Jack has people who just want to buy the next Jersey Jack pin and people

[33:46] will go in on whatever he makes because they like his style.

[33:51] So that's my guess is that we're not going to see it at Expo.

[33:54] But another thing that I saw that was interesting and sorry guys, it's like three in the morning

[34:00] here.

[34:01] So I'm just sort of like going down a few things that are in my mind.

[34:04] The Big Lebowski and it's interesting because people are starting to ask about the code.

[34:14] So people are starting to get the machines and they're wondering how far along the code

[34:19] is because it's not that deep and there's not that much to do in the game.

[34:25] And according to Dutch pinball, the code is 85% complete and that has some owners being

[34:33] very a little anxious, you know, that this is it.

[34:39] And I think they were going for much more sort of Valley Williams, like more simple sort

[34:44] of rule set and not a really deep sort of Keith kind of rule set.

[34:53] And I don't know.

[34:55] I don't know if people are going to be satisfied with that.

[34:57] I think you know, our good friend of the show, Orrick, you know, he's been saying something

[35:04] that I kind of agree with that I don't think you're going to see a lot of the Big Lebowski's

[35:09] made.

[35:10] I think five years from now, the Big Lebowski could be a very sought after rare title from

[35:17] a company that didn't make many of them.

[35:19] I don't think they're going to make hundreds of these things.

[35:22] I really don't.

[35:24] At the price point, it's at and the theme that it is, I think the Big Lebowski is going

[35:29] to have a short production run.

[35:33] And the reason I say that is I just, I still don't think that the theme is quirky.

[35:37] It's like very niche.

[35:41] The theme is quirky.

[35:42] It's niche.

[35:43] It's $10,000.

[35:44] You have to wait a long time to get one.

[35:45] It's shipping from Europe.

[35:48] And in the meantime, you know, my 10 grand can go to Ghostbusters.

[35:51] It can go to Batman.

[35:53] It can go to Star Wars.

[35:55] I don't know.

[35:56] There's all these titles that are, you can send your money towards and get pinball machines

[36:03] that I don't know what Dutch's next move is.

[36:07] Do we really think we're going to see, when do we think we're going to see game two

[36:10] from Dutch pinball?

[36:12] I don't know.

[36:14] It took them so long.

[36:17] By the time Lebowski finally started shipping, all the hype was gone.

[36:22] There is no hype around this machine.

[36:24] Owners are getting them.

[36:25] Nobody cares.

[36:27] Nobody.

[36:28] It's nobody cares.

[36:29] Nobody's uploading videos that show people this machine that's blowing people away.

[36:34] And Ork also said this.

[36:36] And I've been saying this.

[36:38] This game was delayed two years.

[36:40] How is the code not further along?

[36:42] And the answer is simple.

[36:44] Because the code's already almost done.

[36:46] And that's what's kind of head scratching.

[36:48] And it's like, so this game is like, really?

[36:51] It's not all that.

[36:53] It's visually spectacular.

[36:55] It's got great, you know, build quality and materials.

[36:59] And it feels solid.

[37:02] But it's not, I don't know.

[37:03] I don't think it's worth 10 grand.

[37:05] And I don't think it's a 10 grand experience.

[37:08] But it might be worth 10 grand if it was limited.

[37:10] And I think if they were smart, you know, they might have said something like, we're

[37:14] only going to make 500 Lebowski's at 10 grand.

[37:17] And then they're sold out.

[37:19] So that's the thing.

[37:20] It's like, they had their little like early adopter addition, but didn't really come

[37:25] with anything special.

[37:27] And I think they're going to learn the lesson that they're not dealing with any of

[37:33] the scarcity issue, right?

[37:35] They didn't create any, they didn't market it, right?

[37:39] I'm going to say it.

[37:40] They didn't market it properly.

[37:41] Like they should have had like an LE or some version of it or a limited number they're

[37:47] going to make to sell out everyone and ship them.

[37:50] You know, it's another thing.

[37:51] I think Andrew Highways is probably like, why hasn't Alien Ali and Ellie sold out yet?

[37:57] Because his marketing is around it is piss poor.

[37:59] I've said it before.

[38:00] It's piss poor.

[38:02] He should have like limited it to fewer additions for the LE.

[38:06] And he also should have made it so like the LE has stuff that he's not going to make

[38:11] available for sale on other additions.

[38:13] Like, they, it's just, you know, these people that are just like, well, we're the love

[38:17] of Bimbal.

[38:18] Like there's, it's now guys.

[38:19] It's a collecting community and collectors want something special.

[38:24] And if you're going to make an LE too, you can't make like a thousand of them or 1500.

[38:29] That's not limited.

[38:30] It's stupid.

[38:31] Like, I'd be surprised if Jack sells 1500 hobbits.

[38:35] I would.

[38:36] And that's like the LE number.

[38:38] It's like every single was like goes up first.

[38:40] There's more.

[38:41] Here's one thing.

[38:42] It doesn't feel like there's more was ELE's and Ruby Red's additions available for sale

[38:46] than standard.

[38:48] That doesn't make any sense.

[38:50] How can you have more of the limited than the standard?

[38:52] So, you know, like I think Dutch is, is is going to, you know, be in trouble if they

[39:00] can't get pin number two out with a more universal theme.

[39:04] I think they're going to need a theme that's more universal.

[39:07] And this, the quirky theme is not going to work.

[39:10] Cone Brother Film, fanboys, yes.

[39:13] Everyone else is kind of like, yeah, no.

[39:16] The last thing I want to say on this podcast and it's 3 AM.

[39:20] So guys, bear with me here.

[39:21] Is that I think in the next six months to a year, you're going to see so many titles

[39:26] for sale.

[39:28] And the reason why is I think every Stern pinball machine from like 2003 to 2014 is going

[39:37] to look dated compared to what's about to come.

[39:42] And I think Ghostbusters, you know, with the DMD was sort of like the, it sort of, it

[39:47] sort of bridged the gap between the old and the new.

[39:51] Definitely the best art package Stern has ever put into pinball machines.

[39:54] So Stern has learned their lesson with art and they're going to stop just having like

[39:56] guys photoshop and mail it in.

[39:59] But you're going to start to see like this new modern era of pinball and the games are

[40:04] going to be gorgeous.

[40:05] The games are going to be amazing.

[40:06] The games are going to look better than ever before.

[40:08] The games are going to have more bling than ever before.

[40:11] And I think people who have like all these older Sterns that were like limited edition

[40:17] Star Trek and the Walking Dead and Metallica and ACDC and all and Spider-Man Black Edition.

[40:22] I think all those titles are going to, are going to start losing value.

[40:27] They are.

[40:28] There is, there is no way people are going to keep wanting those titles and those titles

[40:34] are not going to be in demand once Stern starts this new era of actually marketing towards

[40:40] the collectors.

[40:42] Because those, those error of limited editions and those pens like, like the Lucis and

[40:49] the, this and that.

[40:50] Like, yeah, there's some like rare titles here and there.

[40:53] But for the most part, you know, I think people are going to want what's new and the collectors

[40:59] are going to want things that were really, really special and really, really limited.

[41:04] And I think you're going to see more and more of these titles come up for sale.

[41:07] I think everyone who thinks that, you know, all these LEs from yesterday years are worth

[41:12] like $7,500, $8,000, $9,000.

[41:16] Good luck.

[41:18] Good luck.

[41:19] We all know that Tron of Vault Edition is going to come out.

[41:22] I mean, Stern's not stupid.

[41:23] They are going to make a Tron.

[41:25] They're going to put artwork from the 80s original.

[41:28] They're going to mix the two like themes together or go throwback Tron.

[41:34] That's going to be the one everyone wants.

[41:35] And they're not stupid either.

[41:36] Vault editions are dead.

[41:38] I don't think they ever do like Vault editions.

[41:40] I think they do like special editions now, right?

[41:44] It's like, you know, with Spider-Man, it was like the first example of it, like just

[41:49] re-themed and new toys.

[41:51] And it's no longer like really a Vault.

[41:53] See Iron Man, they just remade the same exact game.

[41:56] Like Stern learned their lesson.

[41:57] Like, if you just change the artwork, like you can charge a lot more.

[42:01] I mean, look at Batman.

[42:02] They took a title that was kind of like a B and they kind of redesigned parts of it

[42:08] that they weren't happy with.

[42:09] It's a whole new game for the most part, right?

[42:13] And they can charge how much?

[42:15] How much were Black Knights selling for on the second hand market?

[42:18] What like 4,500?

[42:20] And now they can charge 10,000.

[42:22] I hear the Super Ali is going to be $12,000.

[42:26] So you have all these new like really, you know, market it towards the collector.

[42:32] And what is the collector going to do?

[42:33] He's going to look down his row of games and be like, you know, this Star Trek Ali is

[42:37] not that special anymore.

[42:39] And this Tron Ali is really not that special.

[42:42] You know, 400 Tron Ali's.

[42:45] That's still almost double the amount of Ali's are for Batman.

[42:50] So it's not that special.

[42:53] And so, you know, these games are going to hit the auction block, watch it.

[43:00] And you're going to see a lot of people that are reluctant to realize the new pricing for

[43:05] this stuff.

[43:06] And stuff's going to sit for sale if people think they're going to get like more than

[43:09] they paid for those titles.

[43:11] So that's my prediction is you're going to see a lot of people having to sell this stuff.

[43:14] And also just people have to sell stuff because to free up capital, I mean, it's ridiculous.

[43:20] If you want to buy every new inbox now, if you bought every new inbox game this year from

[43:23] every manufacturer, you're looking at what, like $50,000, $60,000 on pinball machines.

[43:30] Good luck explaining that to the Mrs. how that's a good investment or your financial advisor.

[43:34] All right.

[43:35] So that was like 43 and a half minutes.

[43:38] It's 3, 15 in the morning.

[43:39] I'm exhausted.

[43:40] I just wanted to get up some thoughts for you guys for the weekend.

[43:43] I love having new stuff up for you guys to listen to as you're mowing your lawn and weed

[43:47] whacking.

[43:49] Rare hero, we apologize if we hurt your feelings.

[43:52] We still think you should come on this show.

[43:53] I actually think Greg would have more fun talking about this stuff and getting it off his

[43:57] chest that way versus just constantly typing about it.

[44:01] I mean, let it go.

[44:03] Ghostbusters is a fun pinball machine.

[44:05] There's no denying it.

[44:06] The sales prove that.

[44:07] It's not just a theme.

[44:08] People enjoy it.

[44:10] I actually like the short ball times.

[44:12] I hate games that people play for like 30 minutes of ball.

[44:15] I think it's stupid.

[44:16] It's not pinball.

[44:18] Right.

[44:19] People, Star Wars, go get your order in tomorrow if you happen.

[44:22] It's going to sell out if it's not already.

[44:24] That is episode 51.
