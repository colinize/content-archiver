[00:00] She met the modes of horror,

[00:02] thank thank, I am the warrior.

[00:07] Sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib, sib.

[00:11] All right, 340 episodes of Canada's Pimball Podcast,

[00:17] the only Pimball Podcast that has never been sponsored

[00:21] by any Pimball company, even though we're number one.

[00:25] All right, so ladies and gentlemen, on this episode,

[00:27] you know what we're gonna talk about?

[00:29] We're gonna talk about the response to Willy Wonka.

[00:32] Now that's gonna be a fun one.

[00:34] I'm also gonna read a lot of your feedback to me,

[00:38] to the show in general.

[00:40] I think some of you are excited.

[00:42] I think some of you are like down, it's only natural.

[00:45] We see this response every time a new Pimball machine

[00:49] is put out into the world.

[00:50] Now here's what I wanna do.

[00:52] I wanna go down sort of now that I can talk freely

[00:55] about the game and talk freely about my experience.

[00:58] I wanna sort of walk you guys through the context

[01:01] in which I saw the game for the first time

[01:03] because I really haven't done that yet.

[01:05] Okay, and I know you know how excited I was

[01:08] after I left Jersey Jack Pimball

[01:10] and how I talked about the game and how I hyped the game up.

[01:13] And I still think the game is a masterpiece.

[01:15] We're gonna talk about that,

[01:16] but I wanna just give you the context of going over there.

[01:20] I took a day off from work and Brendan and I went over

[01:23] to Jersey Jack Pimball in New Jersey.

[01:26] And we, you know, it was me, Brenda, Joe Newhart,

[01:30] Joe's wife and Jack.

[01:32] We had an amazing day at the factory playing the game.

[01:35] I only saw the collector's edition of Willy Wonka.

[01:40] So they had a collector's edition there

[01:41] that had the red trim.

[01:43] I could not see the back box or the translate.

[01:46] I was able to see the side art,

[01:47] but it was sort of like prototype side art

[01:49] in which the quality wasn't the best.

[01:52] Like it wasn't rad cows.

[01:53] None of the other stuff that is apparently going to make

[01:57] its way into the collector's edition of the game

[02:00] was in the game that I had seen when I was there, okay?

[02:04] Like even the gobstopper mechanism,

[02:07] the gobble hole was just all black.

[02:09] There wasn't even a decal on that.

[02:11] So there were changes to the game that were definitely made

[02:14] when you guys saw it at MGC, okay?

[02:17] Now look, I played about 15 to 20 games on it

[02:21] and I was blown away.

[02:22] I had such a good time playing Willy Wonka for the first time.

[02:26] Now you have to understand the context of my life, right?

[02:30] Not my entire life, but my pinball experience,

[02:33] I play a lot of pinball machines on location in New York City,

[02:37] but I own a Batman 66.

[02:39] And the machine I play the most is Batman 66, okay?

[02:44] And Batman 66, to be honest, is clunky at best, right?

[02:49] Every shot in Batman 66, it feels like

[02:53] you have to power the ball through the game

[02:56] and through the clunk of the game.

[02:58] And I still love the game.

[02:59] I think the game is great.

[03:00] I love the theme, I love the theme integration,

[03:02] but there's no denying that Batman 66 is a bit of a clunk fest

[03:07] and that you have to power the ball up the ramps.

[03:09] You have to power the ball up through the orbits.

[03:12] You have to power the ball into the penguin scoop.

[03:15] And every shot, almost every shot in Batman, it clunks.

[03:19] Hardly anything is smooth.

[03:22] Nothing like swishes through the game.

[03:25] And because of that, because of that,

[03:27] I think when I jumped on Willie Wonka for the first time

[03:30] and I played it in comparison to Batman 66,

[03:34] it just felt like I was going from sandpaper to silk.

[03:38] And I just loved shooting a pinball game

[03:42] that had such a good layout and such good geometry.

[03:46] And also all the toys and everything in Willie Wonka

[03:49] is just levels above what I have in my Batman 66.

[03:54] Now obviously the Batman 66 art package is phenomenal

[03:58] and I still think the Batman 66 Super Oly cabinet artwork

[04:01] is still better than even the cabinet artwork

[04:05] on Willie Wonka collector's edition.

[04:08] Okay, so just everything in Wonka

[04:10] just felt more premium to me on that day.

[04:12] I love the Godstopper toy when I played it.

[04:15] I love the Wonka vision.

[04:16] I love the Wonka Vader, the vertical upkick

[04:19] in the back of the game.

[04:20] I love the physical kickback in the game.

[04:22] I love the magnet that grabbed the ball by the upper left flipper.

[04:26] I love the light show is incredible.

[04:29] The music, the presentation, the lights going, all of it,

[04:32] playing it for the first time was truly enjoyable.

[04:35] And I had a lot of fun and I think I communicated that

[04:38] to you guys.

[04:40] So I walked away after playing that game

[04:42] with nothing but satisfaction.

[04:44] I wanted one.

[04:45] I wanted to own one.

[04:46] You know me, I went with a check.

[04:47] I gave them the check for the game.

[04:50] Okay, so here's what I didn't notice the day

[04:52] that so many of you are pointing out now.

[04:55] All right?

[04:56] Okay, I did not think that the artwork on the game sucked.

[04:59] Now I'm hearing a lot of you complain about the artwork.

[05:02] People are texting me, people are saying,

[05:04] how can you not just attack the art package on this game?

[05:09] All right, now look, this is not your typical

[05:13] sort of franchy Yeti hand drawn like overly detailed

[05:17] art package in this game.

[05:18] It's not it.

[05:19] It looks like other JJP games to me.

[05:22] It looks like Waz.

[05:23] It looks like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[05:25] Okay?

[05:26] So there's so much cool stuff though on the play field,

[05:30] on Willy Wonka that I have to be honest.

[05:32] I just didn't get distracted by the art.

[05:35] It didn't blow me away the way the art package would

[05:40] on like a magic girl or on a Deadpool or on a monsters, right?

[05:45] It didn't pop out like the most incredible art package,

[05:49] but I'm here to tell you this.

[05:50] And maybe I'm not allowed to feel this way.

[05:52] Maybe you guys just always want me to crap on everything.

[05:55] But I think when a game has so much else in it,

[05:59] the art of the game itself does not become

[06:02] the prime everything you're focused on

[06:04] because you're focused on so much of the other awesome stuff

[06:07] that is in the game.

[06:09] And the world in her glass that is coming up

[06:11] on top of the wood to me is more important

[06:14] than the artwork that is on the play field itself.

[06:17] Now, again, I wasn't distracted by the art.

[06:21] I didn't think the art was bad.

[06:23] I didn't think it was like mind-blowingly great by no means, by no means.

[06:28] But when I look at like the art on my Batman 66,

[06:31] that also feels like it was done quickly, dragged and dropping it was.

[06:34] And Franchie did the best job he could,

[06:36] you know, getting that game to where it was before it shipped.

[06:39] But I think when I look over the art in Willy Wonka,

[06:42] it doesn't, to me, it doesn't feel like,

[06:44] oh, a much worse art package than Pirate of the Caribbean.

[06:47] They feel very similar to me.

[06:49] And again, you have to stand over this machine.

[06:52] And that's the part that like a lot of people

[06:54] just don't get from the streams.

[06:57] You don't get it from still photography.

[07:00] You know, pin-side sees these games.

[07:02] And when you see a pinball machine and you have to see it

[07:05] through the stream from the first time,

[07:07] or from a video for the first time,

[07:09] or from still shots for the first time,

[07:11] I'm sorry, but you just don't get the reality of what it feels like.

[07:16] What it really feels like to stand over a game and say to yourself,

[07:19] okay, like, is this working?

[07:23] Right?

[07:24] Do I enjoy this game and how it's presented to me?

[07:29] And it's really, I don't know,

[07:31] I think it's hard for people to get that unless you stand over it.

[07:34] And I think we heard the same sort of feedback with Black Knight.

[07:36] It's like the kind of game where a top-down view of the Black Knight,

[07:40] what does that do?

[07:41] It flattens everything.

[07:43] You don't get a sense of the upper playfield.

[07:45] You don't get a sense of how big that night mechanism is in the middle of the game.

[07:49] You don't get a sense of the fire at the back of the cabinet.

[07:52] None of that.

[07:54] None of the experience is translated very well.

[07:57] But you know what happens immediately?

[07:59] People's criticism.

[08:00] People's feedback.

[08:01] Everything is like, you know, everyone,

[08:03] just I know right now that I'm not going to like this game because the art is shit.

[08:08] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[08:09] while the Willy Wonka art is not one of the best art packages we've seen recently,

[08:14] it's also not this terrible shitty art package that some of some people on the internet

[08:18] are trying to sort of hammer home, all right?

[08:21] All right.

[08:21] So that's my point.

[08:23] Is that so many modern pins, they have nothing in them

[08:27] that we spend all of our time focused on.

[08:30] You know, they don't have that much in them.

[08:31] So we spend all of our time focused on the art now and the animations because the playfield

[08:36] is bare.

[08:37] You know, when you stand over Wonka, I think you're going to see that it works, that it all

[08:41] comes together nicely, all right?

[08:43] All right.

[08:44] I was genuinely super exgenuinely super excited by what I saw.

[08:50] And I thought anyone who loves pinball would share in that excitement.

[08:55] Did I get people's expectations too high?

[08:58] Most likely I did.

[09:00] I'm not sorry for that though, right?

[09:02] It's pinball.

[09:04] You almost always expect more than there can possibly be in a game.

[09:09] If someone just said I played the game and I think it's amazing, I can't wait to see

[09:12] it, you're still going to raise your expectations.

[09:16] You're still in your head.

[09:17] You're going to dream about all the different things that could be in the game.

[09:20] And when they pull the curtain off, there's a great chance that our imaginations are much

[09:26] greater than the reality of what pinball can be.

[09:31] And that's why I'm not sorry.

[09:32] I'm just not going to wake up and feel bad that I hyped this game because I do believe

[09:37] that it lives up to the hype.

[09:38] And I think everyone who plays it will feel the same way, all right?

[09:42] Do I think this game is still a masterpiece?

[09:46] Absolutely I do.

[09:47] Do I think this game is groundbreaking and innovative?

[09:52] So let's just forget about the groundbreaking hyperbole for a moment because I think that's

[09:57] dumb.

[09:58] And I don't think any pinball machine is groundbreaking.

[10:01] These are old toys.

[10:02] It's an old way of getting entertainment.

[10:05] There is nothing groundbreaking about pinball ever and there never will be.

[10:09] Now there could be groundbreaking within pinball, but again, I think we can lump that into

[10:14] a less dramatic word like innovation.

[10:17] Okay.

[10:18] Innovation is a word we use all the time in pinball.

[10:22] And I'm not even sure what people mean or expect anymore when they drop that word into

[10:28] the conversation.

[10:29] To me, taking your picture on Wankovision and having it appear on the Wankovision screen

[10:37] below the glass, to me that is innovative.

[10:40] Has that ever been done before in pinball?

[10:43] I know they used a camera and dialed in.

[10:45] I know they've used it in pirates, but I don't think it was used very successfully.

[10:49] This is the first time ever though someone playing a pinball machine's images captured

[10:55] and it appears below the glass.

[10:57] Maybe not a huge innovation in your book, but I do think that is innovative.

[11:02] I think it's a great use of the camera in a game.

[11:06] The Gobstopper toy.

[11:08] It's a lot of fun.

[11:09] It's a really fun toy to shoot.

[11:12] Yet people are complaining that it's not innovative.

[11:15] So do me a favor.

[11:16] Name me a game in the last five years that did what the Gobstopper toy is doing.

[11:22] You bash it.

[11:23] It's physically huge, three-dimensional.

[11:25] You bash it.

[11:26] It rotates to a scoop hole.

[11:29] It's a physical ball lock that locks three balls that then kicks out a multi-ball.

[11:34] It has a huge Gobstopper on top of it that spins faster and faster depending on how many

[11:39] balls you have locked.

[11:41] It's a toy anyone can figure out and enjoy.

[11:45] It's a toy that you're physically bashing, but people are bashing it.

[11:50] No pun intended because they're saying it's not innovative.

[11:53] Okay.

[11:54] I just haven't seen many mechanisms on any recent games from anyone else that is like

[11:59] significantly more innovative than that.

[12:02] But again, again, I think people are pointing to the Pirates of the Caribbean rocking ship

[12:08] was innovative.

[12:09] It definitely was and it definitely was an awesome mechanism.

[12:13] But I think this Gobstopper toy is a great toy.

[12:16] It's super fun and it's doing things that I haven't seen other pins do recently at

[12:21] all.

[12:22] Am I missing something?

[12:23] I also think what's great about it.

[12:25] If you look at what's in dialed in, sorry, not dialed in, if you look at what's in Willy

[12:29] Wonka, I don't think these toys are going to break all the time.

[12:34] As much as I love the pirate ship and Pirates of the Caribbean and it is innovative, look

[12:39] at many times that thing is breaking down and people have to fix it.

[12:41] I think that's innovation at what cost, right?

[12:45] I don't want something that's trying too hard and then there's going to be issues with

[12:49] it left and right.

[12:50] This game also has seven magnets.

[12:53] Seven.

[12:54] Seven.

[12:55] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[12:56] Seven magnets are in the game.

[12:57] One of which you could see by that upper left flipper.

[13:00] The other six, I don't know where they all are and you can't tell me that seven magnets

[13:06] are in this game and it's going to grab the ball and do stuff with the ball and that's

[13:10] not going to lead to a magical experience under the glass.

[13:13] Again, all of it is not coated in there yet, but when you just go down the features

[13:18] listed in this game and then I hear people complaining that it's not innovative.

[13:23] Willy Wonka includes four flippers, six balls, a captive ball, seven magnets and everlasting

[13:29] gop stopper.

[13:31] The most secret machine, Oompa Loompa Camera sculpture with seven inch Wonka vision, LCD,

[13:37] a 27 high definition LCD screen with interactive 3D animations, candy colored LED light shows,

[13:44] gameplay features, four multi balls, collecting Wonka bars.

[13:49] It just keeps going and going and going.

[13:50] There's a lot in this game and so for us to say there's no innovation in the game.

[13:56] I don't know.

[13:57] I don't know.

[13:58] I think there is definitely some new stuff, but yes, of course you're going to see some

[14:01] stuff we've seen before in Pimball.

[14:04] But how does it all come together?

[14:06] Like isn't that the most important thing?

[14:09] The light show in this game is phenomenal.

[14:13] Phenomenal.

[14:14] When you stand over this game and you see the light show, I think you're going to be blown

[14:17] away.

[14:18] I think it's one of the best light shows in any Pimball ever.

[14:21] Now is that not innovative?

[14:23] There are new smaller LEDs in this game that has never been used before in Pimball ever.

[14:28] That's not innovative.

[14:30] So if the Pimball experience is amazingly fun, right?

[14:34] Who cares about nitpicking each of the individual parts to death?

[14:40] Because we're often not having a ton of fun on these modern machines.

[14:45] That's where we often land.

[14:47] We need to justify our purchases by the sum of the parts.

[14:52] I bought a monster's premium because it's gorgeous to look at.

[14:55] Meanwhile at the same time some guy is saying the monster's code is a shallow mess and

[14:59] a disaster and I would never own one.

[15:01] We have so much just inconsistency in how people feel about these games.

[15:07] But ultimately when you look at all that's in Willy Wonka, there is no other game out

[15:14] there that just gives you that much.

[15:16] I think the next closest game, if you go down a features list, would be a October Fest.

[15:21] And again, I think the reason people have issues with October Fest isn't that it's not

[15:27] packed with stuff.

[15:28] If it definitely is packed with stuff, is it a theme people want?

[15:32] Is it an art package people want?

[15:34] All right.

[15:35] So let's move on to how they rolled it out and revealed it at MGC.

[15:40] So I watched this.

[15:41] Now, I can't make this up.

[15:42] I mean, I've given Jersey Jack so much crap for how they do their reveals.

[15:47] We lambasted them for the reveal of the Olympic road at Texas Pimball Festival.

[15:54] We knew Jack was going to be in France with the game.

[15:56] He wasn't going to be at MGC.

[15:59] Jersey Jack is the best spokesperson for the game.

[16:02] He is always the guy you want to have with the mic, introducing the company.

[16:07] So I was a little nervous that he wasn't going to be at MGC and I was curious to see how

[16:12] they were going to introduce the game.

[16:15] And so Brett Abess, who seems to be part of the investor group at Jersey Jack Pimball,

[16:21] he introduced Pat Lawler and he just gave a little bit of a four to five minute speech,

[16:27] thanking all the different partners and talking about the Jersey Jack Pimball philosophy.

[16:31] Now here's the deal, Brett and Jack.

[16:34] You gotta be kidding me, man.

[16:35] The guy was reading from his cell phone, his cell phone and he knew this was going to be

[16:42] a live stream event.

[16:45] At rule number one, if you are the person with the microphone who is in charge of sort

[16:52] of like building the hype and the excitement in the room, you can't read from your cell phone.

[16:58] Like public speaking is not easy.

[17:00] Public speaking is everyone's number one fear.

[17:02] And I've seen people do this before.

[17:04] I've seen them do it in new business pitches, but you can't do that.

[17:08] This is not, it's just, again, I don't even know if I should just let this go and let

[17:13] everyone who reveals a Pimball machine, just do it their way because I just don't even

[17:18] know if people even understand the basic concepts of how to do a reveal and how to do marketing

[17:24] right.

[17:25] Now I think Jersey Jack did a lot of right with this marketing reveal of the game, but

[17:28] that was sort of strange to see him up there.

[17:32] And then you know Pat, Pat's an interesting guy.

[17:34] Pat obviously is one of the greatest Pimball designers of all time.

[17:38] He's clearly not a great microphone height man.

[17:42] Jersey Jack needs to find who that is.

[17:44] I saw Crazy Levy said something on Pinside about how he would offer his services to get

[17:50] the room going.

[17:51] And he's right.

[17:52] You need someone who gets the room going, who gets the excitement going, you know, sort

[17:57] of gets the crowd cheering.

[17:58] It's an art form that not everybody has.

[18:01] Does it matter though?

[18:03] You know, does it matter?

[18:04] I think look, it does matter a little bit because you get one chance to get people excited.

[18:07] But the game will always do the talking in Pimball more than anything.

[18:12] And I think what we're seeing with all these reveals is, is what is the best way to launch

[18:16] a Pimball game?

[18:17] Like what is the best way to do it?

[18:19] And I think what we saw with the Willy Wonka reveal is stuff like the straight down the

[18:24] middle videos and the round table discussions with the design team by like special and

[18:29] lit.

[18:30] I think that's like the best way to do it.

[18:32] You know, I know people are upset by my hype and my hype train that I did.

[18:36] And they think I heard someone said I hurt sales of the game.

[18:39] Can you eat all your excitement, hurt the sales of the game because it couldn't possibly

[18:44] live up to your enthusiasm.

[18:47] Give me a break.

[18:48] You know, if you if you grown men, if you grown men are upset that I got excited about

[18:54] a Pimball machine, make up your own damn mind on the game.

[18:59] Play the game, look at the game, shoot the game, watch streams of the game.

[19:03] I don't care what you do, but don't blame me for a, you know, for your lack of the

[19:09] desire to own the game.

[19:11] I think you're silly.

[19:12] Look, I'm still all in on this game.

[19:14] If you don't want one, that's cool.

[19:15] That's your loss, not mine.

[19:17] Everyone needs to formulate their own opinion.

[19:19] But I think videos like that, like talking to Pat Lawler, talking to the design team.

[19:24] I think the way I would do it, it was I would get some of those videos up first.

[19:29] You can get them talking about the game and what people are going to see without going

[19:33] into too much detail.

[19:34] I would get all of that out of the way first.

[19:37] I would, I would leak those, not leak them.

[19:39] I would put them out in the world like a week or two before you actually show the game.

[19:43] But then when you show the game for the first time, I mean, I don't even think doing it

[19:48] at these shows is the right way to do it.

[19:50] I actually would do more of a sort of a produced video of all the gameplay features and showing

[19:56] it that way.

[19:57] You don't, you don't think you've a way everything.

[19:59] But I think that's the best way to do it.

[20:01] And then you just bring the game to shows and you let people actually flip it.

[20:05] And I think that's the right way to sort of manage people's expectations and also educate

[20:10] them on what they're about to see.

[20:13] And I do agree that maybe it wasn't the best thing to just get all your hopes up.

[20:18] And then it just ended up becoming a pinball machine.

[20:20] I mean, sometimes I think you guys actually thought it would be something even more than

[20:23] it's even physically possible.

[20:25] But it is what it is.

[20:26] I'm excited.

[20:28] And you know, next time I think we've learned a lesson in how to maybe do this for people

[20:33] next time if we see something early.

[20:35] And I think we're learning as we go.

[20:37] I'm sorry, but I've never seen a pinball machine before the rest of the world.

[20:40] I've never been that excited standing over a pinball machine.

[20:43] And I'm sorry if my excitement upset some of you cry babies out there on Pinsider, right?

[20:49] All right.

[20:50] What else do I want to talk about now?

[20:51] Now that I've seen it, I want to talk a little bit about what I think needs to be done

[20:56] and work to be done.

[20:58] Because I've now seen all three models.

[20:59] I've now seen the whole offering from Jersey Jack.

[21:02] And you know me, I'm still going to be a straight shooter.

[21:04] I am not like Jersey Jack's now marketing person.

[21:07] I'm not a shield for Jersey Jack pinball.

[21:09] Here's what I think they need to do.

[21:11] And I think they need to work on.

[21:12] They clearly want to start competing in the premium price range of stern.

[21:18] The $7,700 version of the game, this standard edition still comes with a lot of stuff.

[21:23] It loses the physical ball lock.

[21:25] Okay.

[21:26] And I think that game would sell like hotcakes.

[21:28] But for one thing, it has the ugliest art package I've seen on almost any game ever.

[21:36] And by that, I mean the cabinet artwork.

[21:38] There is just no excuse why the standard edition needs to look so damn standard.

[21:46] It looks horrible.

[21:47] I mean, look, Jack and team over there.

[21:51] And I'm talking right to you guys right now.

[21:54] What is that?

[21:55] What kind of mailed in like lazy, massive, a cabinet is that John UC.

[22:00] I'm talking right to you, John.

[22:03] Out of all the things you could have done, all the assets you had to pick from in the

[22:07] Willy Wonka universe, that's all you did was slap the logo on the side for a $7,700

[22:14] game.

[22:15] This game means a lot.

[22:17] It's almost like they're treating it like this is for operators only just a shove into

[22:21] an arcade and no one will even see the side art.

[22:23] But I think you're wrong.

[22:25] I think a lot of people now who could not previously afford Jersey Jack games who don't

[22:31] really care about the physical ball lock.

[22:33] They want to own this beautiful machine, but you made it not beautiful from a distance

[22:38] with this horrible cabinet artwork.

[22:41] And I think they need to go back and I think they need to look at what is on all these games

[22:45] which is these are prototype beta games and artwork and other stuff is subject to change.

[22:52] And look, this isn't a huge thing they need to do.

[22:55] They really should not take too long to sort of make that look better and put something

[23:00] else on the standard edition cabinet even if they even if they gave like the Ellie artwork

[23:04] onto the standard.

[23:05] I don't know because again, think about it then like at least the upgrade to the Ellie

[23:09] is the physical ball lock.

[23:11] It's more mechanical.

[23:12] But I just think the cabinet artwork maybe let make it look like the Wonka chocolate

[23:16] bar, but it just looks bad.

[23:19] And every Stern pro out there I looked at recently has amazing artwork.

[23:22] In fact, some of the Stern pro artwork has been better than the Ellie artwork Guardians

[23:27] of the Galaxy anyone.

[23:29] All right.

[23:30] Oh man.

[23:31] It's like it's like so weird to me.

[23:33] It's like again, for a company that has put so much effort into this, for a company that

[23:38] is all about the details, for a company that is all about making the game look premium,

[23:44] how can you make that game look so damn standard?

[23:46] Like no.

[23:47] All right.

[23:48] The other thing.

[23:50] Come on, joke hats.

[23:51] This is the next year for Joe.

[23:54] Kid multi ball needs to go.

[23:55] They need to rename Kid multi ball something more inspiring.

[23:58] I think that that's again, just lazy.

[24:02] What white kid multi ball we couldn't call it something better than that.

[24:06] But here's my biggest issue.

[24:08] And I'm going to be totally honest with all of you out there.

[24:11] I'm still all in on this game.

[24:12] I love the way it shoots.

[24:13] I can't wait to get it.

[24:15] There's one major thing.

[24:17] And this is a big thing that has me a little nervous.

[24:21] And I've thought a little bit more about this since I was over there.

[24:24] And now that I've watched the stream multiple times, I've probably watched about an hour

[24:30] of two of Willy Wonka being flipped.

[24:32] Here's what I'm most nervous about.

[24:35] And it's a nervousness that I know can be corrected.

[24:39] If I was nervous that the shots sucked, I wouldn't be in on the game.

[24:44] If I was nervous that there wasn't fun toys and mechs and stuff, I wouldn't be in on

[24:48] the game.

[24:49] The reason I'm in on this game, but still nervous, is that the thing that I'm most nervous

[24:53] about can change.

[24:55] And I expect it to change.

[24:57] But I'm also curious as to why nobody really has an answer on this for me.

[25:03] Here's what I'm nervous about.

[25:05] Where are the movie assets in this game?

[25:08] Where are they?

[25:09] They are seemingly not present in the way they need to be to bring the world of Willy

[25:16] Wonka through and integrate the theme properly into this game.

[25:22] And what I mean by that is there's a total lack of clips from the film.

[25:27] And when we do see the clips, there's no audio from those scenes.

[25:32] Whether it's Charlie and his grandpa with the bubbles, whether it's, you know, I want

[25:36] it now, golden egg.

[25:38] None of the voices are coming through in the clips.

[25:42] They're just silent.

[25:44] So it's like, where is that stuff?

[25:47] And I know they have access to everything, but I'm really nervous that that stuff's not

[25:52] in there now.

[25:53] And they're showing this to the game.

[25:55] Oh, sorry, they're showing this game to the world for the first time saying it's going

[25:58] to ship with full code this summer.

[26:00] Where is that stuff?

[26:01] Like, where are the memorable songs from the film, the way they are in the film?

[26:06] If you have access to that stuff, I want to hear those songs the way they are from the

[26:12] movie.

[26:13] I want to hear Gene Wilder sing.

[26:14] I want to hear the candy man sing his song, right?

[26:18] I want each iconic scene or room from Willy Wonka.

[26:22] I needed to be in the game, like in a mode in which we, the player get to experience what

[26:29] we love from the film.

[26:31] For example, and this, and there is stuff in there that makes me believe it's all going

[26:36] to go the right way.

[26:38] When you start the wakatonia, right, when you're in the ship and you're singing that creepy

[26:42] song, it's amazing.

[26:43] And this is in the game now.

[26:45] It's amazing how the light show in the pin transforms you into that scene.

[26:50] We hear Willy Wonka singing it.

[26:51] We see his image.

[26:52] We see the psychedelic light show happening in the game.

[26:55] You feel like the pinball machine is bringing you into that iconic scene from the movie.

[27:01] I just want more of that.

[27:03] I need every iconic scene to be brought to life in the game.

[27:08] And I'm not seeing it right now in a lot of different ways.

[27:12] And it needs to.

[27:13] And I asked, can I ask Jeff, did anyone talk to Joe Katz and ask him, is that coming?

[27:20] Like can we get confirmation that everything you want to see from the movies is going

[27:25] to make its way into the game?

[27:27] We know that they continue to code Jersey Jack machines.

[27:32] Even years later, after it comes out, more and more clips kept going into the hobbit and

[27:37] to Wizard of Oz.

[27:39] But I don't know.

[27:41] That's what I'm most nervous about is I just don't understand where that stuff is.

[27:48] I want to hear callouts from Willy Wonka, from Charlie, from Grandpa Joe, from Augustus

[27:53] Gloop, from Violet, from Varukas Salt, from Mike TV, from Arthur Slugworth.

[27:58] I need all those characters coming through more in this game.

[28:01] So how much is the game coded?

[28:03] 40% 60%.

[28:04] I think the rules are down.

[28:06] It's unclear to me based on all the interviews how far along this game is.

[28:11] All right.

[28:12] Now, lastly, I'm in on a collector's edition.

[28:14] Am I still in on it?

[28:15] Yes.

[28:16] People have asked me, do you think it's still worth $12,500?

[28:19] And here's my answer.

[28:21] We all know that the collector's edition really stands for one thing.

[28:25] If you want the best version of this game, the most dressed up and sexy version, it will

[28:31] be the collector's edition.

[28:32] And because I do love this game so much, and I plan to own this game forever, that's how

[28:38] much I love flipping it, I want the best version of the game.

[28:42] All right.

[28:43] And so the collector's edition has the red armor.

[28:45] It's going to have play field sparkle.

[28:47] I mean, the sparkles were 3,000 right there.

[28:50] It's got the mirrored back glass.

[28:51] It's got the exclusive apron artwork.

[28:53] It's got the topper.

[28:56] It's got the everlasting gobstopper shooter knob.

[28:58] I mean, I saw someone on Pinside complying about the everlasting gobstopper shooter rod,

[29:06] saying that they would change it back to a normal shooter rod.

[29:09] I can't with these people.

[29:10] Anyway, so that's where we're at with Wonka.

[29:13] I think there's work to be done.

[29:14] I think what we've seen so far is very amazing.

[29:18] I think anyone who flips it will really enjoy it.

[29:21] And I think, you know, look, people's expectations are going to come back down.

[29:24] And I do think when people see this game, they're going to really enjoy it.

[29:27] And that's where we're at.

[29:28] Now, here's the other thing that I was laughing about with friends on, you know, on social

[29:31] media that all of us pinball fans.

[29:34] There was another game at MGC that was there for the first time.

[29:37] That was Black Knight.

[29:38] I didn't hear much about Black Knight.

[29:40] I didn't hear much conversation.

[29:42] I didn't hear much hype.

[29:43] I didn't hear much coming out of the show.

[29:46] So I'm curious.

[29:47] If you've played Black Knight, what were your feelings coming out of MGC?

[29:51] Is it a must buy?

[29:53] I still haven't heard anyone say I put a $9,000 Black Knight next to a $9,000 Willy Wonka.

[29:59] You tell me, come on, come on.

[30:02] Tell me like these things are worth the same amount of money.

[30:05] Seven magnets.

[30:07] Seven.

[30:08] You know, big mechanisms, Wonka vision, all these things.

[30:11] You got the night and then you got a ball lock on the upper play field.

[30:15] What do you got?

[30:16] Is there one magnet, one magnet in the Black Knight?

[30:19] But ultimately what I've been feeling more and more and more, if you're having fun with

[30:24] the game, man, I don't even care about waking up and trying to justify to people like why

[30:29] I might like a game.

[30:31] It gets annoying after a while.

[30:32] All right.

[30:33] So I asked people on my Facebook page and I got emails.

[30:35] I'm going to read them to you guys now.

[30:38] What people thought of Willy Wonka.

[30:40] And I want to read for you some of the feedback I got from listeners of this show.

[30:45] I'm going to call you guys out by name.

[30:48] So get ready.

[30:50] Let's see.

[30:51] All right.

[30:52] Darren Stender said, game is loaded and has amazing flow for four flipper game and with

[30:58] so much stuff packed in a standard body pin.

[31:01] Not sure why people are saying it's lacking on stuff, but I think it's super packed and

[31:05] holds its own with other JJP pins.

[31:09] Also the full RGB lighting with so many inserts is beautifully done.

[31:13] I think once code is done, it will be a top pin.

[31:17] All right.

[31:18] So let's see what else we got here.

[31:20] Oh, man, there's a YouTube video.

[31:22] I'm not even afraid about me showing the game.

[31:26] Brian said, Brian Krova-Nack.

[31:29] I am just glad social media never, wait, I'm just glad social media didn't exist before

[31:35] with Circus Voltaire.

[31:36] We probably would have never seen it with this amount of nitpick bitching.

[31:41] Bill Cohen said, I ate up all your hype and I put a deposit on a CE sort of let down.

[31:49] By all your praise, I was expecting the second coming of pinball machines.

[31:53] Looks great.

[31:54] Just missing the revolutionary parts.

[31:57] What don't I see?

[31:58] Hoping to be impressed when I flip it.

[32:01] Yeah, Bill, I mean, look, I get it, man.

[32:03] I get exactly how you feel and I think you will really enjoy it when you flip it.

[32:08] Jeff Dilleman says, the good light show was really impressive.

[32:12] The game feels really full of shots to hit.

[32:15] Looks like it shoots great.

[32:16] The bad.

[32:17] Very few animations right now.

[32:20] Cabinet art on standard edition is garbage.

[32:23] Not very obvious what the point of the game is, which is why you roasted pirates so much.

[32:29] Things like two best strategies just keep going for ramps.

[32:34] Also the reveal felt a little sloppy and the top down view did the game no favors.

[32:41] Overall, I think it looks fun and I'm excited to play it, but I'm not sure why you and

[32:46] special winlit guys were losing your shit over it.

[32:49] I think it's a fair point.

[32:52] I think we played it in a little bit of a different sort of circumstance.

[32:55] But again, I think when you flip it, you're going to understand why we love it so much.

[32:59] There's just something about physically playing the game.

[33:02] That is just awesome.

[33:03] Alright, so here's the thing.

[33:05] Mark Stewart said, you massively hyped it and I'm an I may be fan by the way, just saying

[33:11] no worries though.

[33:12] Alright, Mark.

[33:14] Carl Strode said, looks pretty badass to me and I'm confident that JJP will polish the

[33:19] code to please everyone.

[33:20] Can't wait to get our hands on the LE.

[33:23] I appreciate that they have tried to get the standard at a lower price point for OP's,

[33:28] but I want fully featured games.

[33:30] The artwork is Bobo on the standard too.

[33:34] Funny how Stern is kind of the opposite.

[33:36] Featureless Pro games, but usually sports the best looking artwork of the three.

[33:42] Well Carl, I agree totally.

[33:44] I think Stern gives the sexiest to the game to actually go out in the volume the most.

[33:50] And I think that is, Jersey Jack needs to address the pro artwork.

[33:53] There is no way around it.

[33:55] I hope they now listen to this show more frequently because of how much of a fan I was, but I'm

[33:59] not a fan of that pro art and I don't think anybody is.

[34:02] And I don't think anything that ever leaves that factory should look so pedestrian.

[34:06] Alright, Robert Brooks said, I think it's good, not great.

[34:12] I think they left out a lot of key points in the movie that should have been toys on

[34:16] the play field.

[34:18] Also the cabinet artwork is not much.

[34:20] I still want to flip it before purchase.

[34:23] It was a cool, not wow factor at first.

[34:27] Okay.

[34:28] Well, look, there's only so much you can put into the play field.

[34:30] So I'm curious, Robert, what toys would you have put there that are not currently there

[34:34] that you thought should have got more?

[34:37] I do think there could have been stuff like the golden egg could have been a great way

[34:39] to have a ball drop down.

[34:41] There could have been a little bit more, but again, I think there is a lot there though.

[34:45] Alright, let's see.

[34:47] Darren's, let's see, Darren's stinger said, did I read from Darren already?

[34:50] Because I want to make sure I give you guys like all equal.

[34:53] No, Darren, let's, let's, let's read your commentary here.

[34:55] There's a lot.

[34:56] I can't read it all.

[34:57] And I want to get some of the emails as well.

[34:58] He says, here are some things that is just on the play field.

[35:02] Full, beautiful RGB lighting, seven magnets, seven inch play field LCD, three ramps, four

[35:08] flippers, two physical ball locks, subway, captive ball, three or four diverters, camera, spinning

[35:13] gop stop or motorized moving hole with floating bash target, vertical up kick, light it,

[35:18] wonka sign and all the regular stuff like three pop bumpers, targets, slings, saucers,

[35:23] auto fire and plenty more.

[35:24] You know, it's like, wow, right?

[35:26] When he lists all that stuff and then people are saying like, I don't know, I don't know

[35:29] what people are looking for.

[35:30] Okay, so Brandon Hoffman, Brandon, thank you for listening to the show and talking to

[35:36] me frequently about pinball.

[35:37] He said, looks like the other Jersey Jack machines of which none are all that much fun to

[35:41] play.

[35:42] I'll keep an open mind until I play it, but certainly not something I'd throw money

[35:47] down to buy.

[35:48] See that's the thing Brandon, I think for me and I have not bought a previous Jersey

[35:53] Jack game.

[35:54] This to me is the Jersey Jack game that is the best shooting Jersey Jack game ever and

[35:59] it has all of the other stuff that I think we've all loved in Jersey Jack machines before,

[36:04] but we haven't wanted to buy them necessarily if the flow wasn't there or the shots weren't

[36:08] there or the theme wasn't when we loved.

[36:10] So that's, that's my take.

[36:12] But I think everyone's saying sort of similar things that it needs more of the movie integrated

[36:16] in and I think the pro cabinet artwork is really not the best.

[36:20] All right, I got an email from Mike Hackinson.

[36:22] He says, the flow of the game looks amazing.

[36:24] We should have maybe one more gadget, but it will be a while before I see it in person,

[36:30] hope to make it my first new inbox game and second game I've ever owned.

[36:34] I only have space for one game.

[36:36] So the Adam's family I have had for 10 years must go.

[36:40] Looks worth it.

[36:42] Mike texts test Viock said the game looks fantastic.

[36:45] I'm down for an L.E. but I wish the manufacturers would let you option to pick your machine.

[36:50] I like the L.E. design, but I like the red trim over the blue.

[36:55] I don't want powder coated wire forms, but I do want the mirrored back glass.

[36:59] Yeah, Mike, I mean, look, the whole like order it the way you want it.

[37:03] That just blows up their entire model for like L.E.'s premiums and pros and collectors

[37:09] and limited editions because if you do that, then you have no clue like how many of

[37:12] each you made.

[37:13] All right, so Cody, Cody wrote Cody Myler as a mellier.

[37:18] I can't some of your last names.

[37:19] I'm sorry guys if I butcher them.

[37:20] He writes, finally a J.J.P. game that I buy to operate on location once code is almost

[37:26] done.

[37:27] Theme is number one on location games.

[37:29] Deadpool pro earns like no other game ever for me.

[37:32] Wanka hits most not all demographics.

[37:35] So it should earn very well.

[37:37] These spare change to play on location pinball is the biggest growing segment of allocation

[37:41] of funds in location pinball.

[37:43] So why miss out of it?

[37:45] All right.

[37:46] Did I read that right or is there some weird grammar or is it Sunday morning?

[37:49] I don't know, but anyway, Cody, I agree.

[37:50] This is going to bring a lot of people into location pinball.

[37:53] All right, Walt K.Walt, I'm not going to butcher the last name.

[37:58] It's what you think pinball machines in the modern era should look like.

[38:02] We have been staring at the same thing since the 90s, new mechs and ideas are sorely missing

[38:07] in most other games.

[38:08] I think we are in the midst of new generation of a machine.

[38:13] Cal Davis said, based on the hype, I thought it would actually come shipped with a small

[38:16] person inside the cabinet.

[38:18] Such a letdown that it doesn't.

[38:20] All right, Derek Stutzman, our friend Derek who has his pie to the Caribbean, he says,

[38:25] if you don't get the CE, be sure to get the rad cows while I'm getting the CE.

[38:30] All right.

[38:31] There's a lot more.

[38:32] I can't read all these.

[38:33] No one will listen to my show if I just read, I'll go down the list and other time.

[38:36] So here's the thing.

[38:37] And I got some emails as well.

[38:38] Let me read a couple of the emails because I do tell people to email me at canadapinballatgemail.com.

[38:43] But what you guys are seeing here is my Facebook page is now active again.

[38:48] So if you want to join Canada's pinball podcast on Facebook, we are also having a great conversation

[38:55] there as well.

[38:56] And so I got an email from Jason Zimmerman and said, want good TF like WTF is a canada.

[39:01] Yeah.

[39:02] So I think with all the games available right now, people are trying to find any reason

[39:07] to talk themselves out of the title.

[39:10] There are just so many choices right now.

[39:12] So we have to minimize titles to justify why we aren't getting them.

[39:18] When in reality, it's because we can't afford them or we don't have space or spousal support

[39:23] or whatever.

[39:24] I think it's human nature.

[39:26] I mean, how else do you look at Wanka and bitch about the f-ing side art on the SC?

[39:31] I mean, come the f-on.

[39:33] I mean, look, I bitched about it.

[39:34] It's not good, man.

[39:35] It needs to be better.

[39:37] He says this game is a modern era masterpiece.

[39:40] My first just flashed impression is that Wanka makes Black Knight look like a party favor.

[39:47] The Black Knight is a lark, a fancy, a trifle, and a mouge bouge for the main course,

[39:52] a different story if Black Knight premium was 4k at the price, part, parody, Black

[39:59] K from a value perspective is a punchline.

[40:02] Wow, Jason, how do you really feel about the Black Knight?

[40:05] Look, you know, they're totally different games.

[40:08] I mean, there's guys who don't even like Willie Wanka as a theme that will love the Black

[40:14] Knight and vice versa.

[40:17] Ron Jacobson said, canada, come on, man.

[40:20] I tuned in to hear the Wanka interview with Jack and had to sit through 15 minutes of

[40:24] complaining about Pinside.

[40:26] Why are you wasting time talking about the 8 people who are disappointed?

[40:30] The overwhelming majority of Pinsiders were either excited or thought it was fine, but

[40:35] not for them.

[40:36] Why cherry pick the bad comments?

[40:39] I think a good lesson here is how we'll look past certain things if we love a game.

[40:44] For example, I really doubt you'd be as forgiving of this drag and drop Photoshop art package

[40:50] if it was on a game you weren't in love with, or the generic Blan narrator.

[40:56] And you've definitely been hypercritical of games without having flipped them.

[41:01] It'd be nice if you could extend that courtesy to people who are excited about games you don't

[41:06] like.

[41:07] Just remember how you felt when people went after Wanka the next time you want to take

[41:13] the piss out of a game you aren't a fan of.

[41:17] We'll all find Pimbal magic in different places.

[41:20] Take care, Ron.

[41:22] Wow, Ron.

[41:23] I think I was very well said.

[41:26] I understand completely what you're saying.

[41:29] I do this on this show.

[41:31] And I am hypercritical of certain elements that some people are saying is found in Wanka

[41:38] that I am turning a blind's eye to because I love the game so much.

[41:42] And I think I want to say to all you out there that that is probably happening on some

[41:47] level and I don't know how to not do that.

[41:52] And I think this show is just my opinion about Pimbal.

[41:55] But what I'm learning is, you know, ultimately I want to be able to sort of flip a game and

[42:02] experience it before I do give you my final sort of verdict on a game.

[42:06] And I think sometimes we might rush to judge.

[42:10] But man, there's certain things like, you know what?

[42:12] Yeah, I can look at some artwork and I can give you my opinion without having to play

[42:15] the game.

[42:17] And sometimes we're just going to disagree on stuff.

[42:20] That's the other thing too.

[42:21] I think sometimes people, it's almost like people look at this show and they hear me and

[42:25] they're like, you get it right.

[42:27] And I'm here to tell you there is no right or wrong in something like subjective like a

[42:31] Pimbal machine.

[42:32] This isn't a math equation.

[42:34] Okay.

[42:35] I'm not giving you the final answers.

[42:37] But just I'm giving you my one opinion.

[42:40] It's just my opinion.

[42:41] I don't even have a co-host.

[42:42] It's just me.

[42:43] Now, I think a lot of times you agree with my opinion because it's also your opinion.

[42:48] And if at times you think I'm wrong and you might love October fest, you might think

[42:53] aliens amazing and these might be games that I've ragged on.

[42:57] And I might rag on pirates because of how the code is just all over the place because

[43:01] there's no assets.

[43:02] Yes, I will be hyper critical of Willy Wonka if the assets don't make its way into the

[43:06] game the way they need to to bring the story to life.

[43:09] I won't hold back.

[43:11] I guarantee you that.

[43:12] All right.

[43:13] That's my promise to you.

[43:14] But I will also change the way I behave and I think a little bit because I think it

[43:18] does help even when you guys point out for me some of the things I do that I could do better

[43:23] because I appreciate that because you listen to every episode and you know me pretty well

[43:28] by now and I do appreciate people giving me feedback like that.

[43:31] All right.

[43:32] James Foggan said, dude, it's been over hyped.

[43:34] Yeah.

[43:35] It looks nice, but it's no game changer.

[43:37] I'm rooting for J.J.P.

[43:39] There could have been much better use of the features.

[43:42] Wonka Vision and Wonka Vader just is literally a vertical upkick and an LCD screen.

[43:49] Again, in my mind, I thought there may be more pin 2000 use of Oompa Loompa guiding shots

[43:54] et cetera.

[43:55] And why do LCD screens always loop cheap or sorry, look cheap.

[44:00] Cut and shut art.

[44:02] You're right.

[44:03] I didn't do any better, but I'm not trying to sell a 9,000 pound pin in the UK and that's

[44:08] a lot.

[44:09] Nice pin yes, really nice, but no game changer.

[44:12] All right, James, I see what you're saying.

[44:15] I do think there's a lot more happening on that LCD dough than just like a screen.

[44:20] I think you'll see when you play it, it's not just clips.

[44:24] You know, I think you're going to, I think you'll be surprised as to what's on it.

[44:27] All right.

[44:28] Peter said, will he want to make you over hyped this game?

[44:32] No innovation.

[44:33] I mean, gobbahole and spinning lollipop really.

[44:36] Please Photoshop, plus Photoshop art.

[44:39] Come on man, stick to your unbiased reviews.

[44:41] That's how you got to number one, Peter T.

[44:44] Well Peter, thank you.

[44:46] I think we've talked a lot about all those things, but I don't think I've over hyped it

[44:50] completely.

[44:51] I do think it lives up to a lot of the hype.

[44:53] All right, let's see what else.

[44:54] Let me do one more than I got to go.

[44:56] I got to go.

[44:57] All right.

[44:58] Do do do.

[44:59] More people like the mashup mix, my brother made and then pinball machines.

[45:03] Maybe I'll just become a music podcast.

[45:05] All right.

[45:06] All right.

[45:07] No, this is too long.

[45:08] I'm going to let you guys go there.

[45:09] I'm going to read some more next time.

[45:10] We're at the 45 minute mark.

[45:11] I want to go watch Tiger Woods try to win the masters.

[45:14] I think I might have missed the first hour already.

[45:17] Everyone, everyone.

[45:18] Great time to be in pinball.

[45:20] I love the debate.

[45:21] I love the controversy.

[45:22] I love the dialogue.

[45:23] I love the drama.

[45:24] I love the enthusiasm.

[45:25] I love the fun.

[45:26] I love the creativity this hobby gives us on a weekly basis.

[45:35] on my Patreon page.

[45:39] This does take a lot of time in terms of doing the show for you.

[45:44] No, I don't do a lot of show notes and I don't do a lot of other back work in this show

[45:49] because I give it to you raw.

[45:50] I want you to feel like this is a casual conversation between me and you and I hope you

[45:54] enjoy it.

[45:55] I may be getting Josh Kugler on the show from American Pinball.

[45:59] We might talk today or sometime this week.

[46:01] I'm looking forward to that.

[46:03] If you would like to come on the show and air your opinions about any of this stuff, let

[46:08] me know.

[46:09] I'll do my vetting process to see if you'd be a worthy candidate of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.
