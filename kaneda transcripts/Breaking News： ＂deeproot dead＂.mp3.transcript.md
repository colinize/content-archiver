[00:00] Let the joyous news be spread in the wicked old bitches long to fit.

[00:04] I don't know a lot about the SEC, but I probably know it's not a good thing.

[00:25] The SEC is filing a complaint against deeproot funds and all the other deeproot companies

[00:33] at Robert Mueller set up.

[00:35] If you read this document that was filed August 20th, it's hard to go through this entire

[00:39] thing and not come out feeling like this is the biggest scam in the history of Pimball,

[00:47] but not even that because they barely mentioned deeproot Pimball in this at all.

[00:52] Deeproot Pimball is just one of many companies that it seems Robert Mueller used to funnel

[00:58] money from investors and he got $58 million from investors and that money was primarily

[01:06] supposed to be used to go into the $575 fund.

[01:09] He was supposed to use that money it seems to buy insurance policies, but if you read

[01:14] this and you read the filing by the SEC in Texas, this isn't some personal lawsuit, this

[01:20] is the Securities and Exchange Commission who has investigated his company.

[01:25] This is the SEC that is interviewed Robert Mueller and has been looking into it and when

[01:29] they list all the different points, they list all of his behavior as facts.

[01:36] So nobody better go to Pinside and be like, is this real?

[01:40] I saw that.

[01:41] The first fool who posted this on Pinside says, is this real?

[01:45] No, this is fake.

[01:46] This is the problem with Pimball people.

[01:48] They are so easily deceived like they think people have been making this up.

[01:52] They have all of these different examples about how Robert and Deeproot took money from

[01:58] investors and did not use that money the way they told investors they would use the money.

[02:04] And it's the same story people as Bernie made off as every single crook who has ever existed

[02:11] in the world that turned on a Ponzi scheme thing.

[02:15] They take money from investors.

[02:17] They lie about where the money is going to go.

[02:20] They put the money in this big piggy bank and what they do is they give initial investors

[02:25] a return that looks amazing because they are taking from that piggy bank.

[02:29] But the truth is none of that piggy bank money is being invested in actual growth areas.

[02:35] You need new investors to pay out the old investors and when everyone wants their money back,

[02:39] there is none.

[02:40] But that's not all they do with this money.

[02:42] They spend it on themselves.

[02:45] If you read this, the crazy part about it, he used this money to send his kids to school,

[02:50] to buy apartments, to pay for engagement rings, to pay for weddings of not just his second

[02:55] wife but his third wife as well.

[02:58] And I'm very proud of the fact that I bought Brenda's engagement ring not with anyone

[03:02] else's money but with my hard work.

[03:05] This is where it ends.

[03:06] This is how the walls of Jericho come down around this company.

[03:11] If you thought that we were making this stuff up, if you thought Kerry Hardy just had a

[03:16] bone to pick with Robert Mueller, he went into deep root in September of 2020 and he saw

[03:23] nothing.

[03:24] There was an empty room where manufacturing was supposed to be taking place and he tried

[03:29] to ring the alarm bells and people still invested in December.

[03:33] And when Robert offered refunds, only three people took refunds, three people.

[03:40] This will go down as the biggest joke in the history of Pimbal.

[03:44] It will go down as the biggest foolish move that everybody made.

[03:48] And I mean everybody who stayed in on it, what were you thinking?

[03:53] What were you thinking?

[03:54] And we're not going to beat you up too bad because I know you lost your money.

[03:57] Yellowbirds got a lot of explaining to do.

[03:59] Why did he tell everybody he bought two games in fall?

[04:02] Is he now going to say he did not buy two games in fall?

[04:05] Did he lose $18,000 or was he just lying to us?

[04:09] But look, let's not beat each other up.

[04:11] There are a lot of people in this community that are a part of these projects.

[04:17] Barrio, John Norris, John Papadouk, who I can't believe Karma has followed this guy.

[04:22] Again, J-Pop is finally going to be done with Pimbal for life.

[04:26] It's over.

[04:27] You had Jeff Teolas did voice work on Razi.

[04:30] You have Steve Bowden working all these years on a ruleset you're never going to play.

[04:33] But that's just the tip of the iceberg once the true stories are going to be told right now.

[04:38] And you're going to hear it on Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[04:40] We are going to talk to ex employees at Deep Roo Pimbal.

[04:44] We are going to talk to Ben Hick about what it was like when Robert Mueller went into spooky Pimbal

[04:49] and how he behaved.

[04:50] These people have been very quiet.

[04:53] Do you know that Robert Mueller threatened the nicest guy in all of Pimbal?

[04:58] Like stridently threatened him and his name is Zambieti.

[05:02] When you hear stuff like the correspondence between Robert Mueller and Zambieti and how

[05:07] this man has gone through the Pimbal industry threatening everybody, I should show you the

[05:12] text message I got from a San Antonio number threatening me.

[05:16] I wonder where that came from.

[05:18] And even Robert Mueller himself has threatened me over the years and I am so happy for so

[05:23] many people out there that can finally finally go to rest tonight knowing that it's over.

[05:30] Like this is it people you're not getting your Pimbal machines.

[05:33] I am so happy for Chris and Melissa over at CoinTaker.

[05:37] They were burned by six figures by Robert Mueller who promised to pay them back for all the

[05:42] money that they pumped into John Papaduuk and the Zidware operation.

[05:46] And I think what's going to happen with the death of Deeproot and I think what's going

[05:49] to really be exposed is how we let this happen.

[05:53] How did we as a community let this kind of stuff even exist?

[05:58] Here's what I want everybody to do because I think when something like this collapses there

[06:02] is going to be a lot of finger pointing.

[06:04] There's going to be a lot of people laughing at the suckers who are backing Deeproot Pimbal.

[06:09] There's going to be a lot of scrubbing of the pin side threads in which people were saying

[06:13] wait do you see it like Iceman saying I know more than you do and these games are going

[06:17] to get built there's going to be a lot of that.

[06:20] There's going to be a lot of people looking for a lot of heads to roll.

[06:23] I want everybody to have some patience and not do that.

[06:26] I don't want you guys all to turn on each other and create a civil war.

[06:30] I don't.

[06:31] While there are people who should be very embarrassed for being very bullish on Deeproot Pimbal and

[06:36] you know who they are they're going to take their lashings and the community will do a good

[06:39] job on that.

[06:41] Just don't forget the fact that this entire thing was run by what looks like a criminal.

[06:47] If you read this stuff and you read what the SEC is saying this is criminal behavior.

[06:53] He will end up in a federal prison if he's found guilty of all of these crimes.

[06:59] I did not make this stuff up.

[07:01] This is not a personal lawsuit.

[07:02] This isn't just a bunch of zidware buyers trying to get their money back from John.

[07:06] This is the Securities and Exchange Commission.

[07:09] A little bit more serious here than a few zidware buyers trying to get John in court.

[07:14] If you read all this and you see this behavior it's deplorable.

[07:18] But this isn't new behavior.

[07:20] The only difference is between this and Bernie made off and all the other crooks out there.

[07:25] It's just the size of the piggy bank they create.

[07:28] It's the amount of people they con into going in on it with them.

[07:32] When I look at all these people there was 300 people who invested in the 575 fund.

[07:38] 300 people gave Robert Mueller $58 million.

[07:43] That was since 2015.

[07:45] If you put your $58 million in any decent company over the last six years you would have made

[07:51] a much better return than you would here.

[07:55] Here's why these men succeed.

[07:57] Here's why Pimball people get duped.

[08:00] Apparently at the center of it all is greed.

[08:03] People want to make more on their money than the market.

[08:06] They want to beat the market.

[08:07] They want to cheat the market.

[08:09] It's greed that led these people to giving their money to Robert Mueller.

[08:13] These aren't poor people.

[08:15] Remember, this isn't like the hardworking middle class wakes up one day and decides to

[08:19] give Robert Mueller and deep rude funds money.

[08:21] These are rich people trying to get richer.

[08:24] I'm never that sympathetic to people who get taken in these kinds of scams because if

[08:28] you do your homework and you ask questions there is no way you would turn to this as being

[08:34] the right place to put your money.

[08:35] Again, it's greed and it's shortcuts in life and it doesn't get you anywhere.

[08:40] On the Pimball side of it the thing was a joke from day one.

[08:43] A guy that has no manufacturing experience was going to ship more games in one year than

[08:46] every company combined and we put him up on stage and we gave him a microphone and Steve

[08:52] Bowden said just wait and Steve Bowden had no idea what was going on with the company

[08:57] but how many years do you forgive Steve Bowden?

[09:00] How many years do you forgive Barry O?

[09:01] How many years do you forgive John Norris and John Papadou at what point should they have

[09:05] raised some of the alarm bells and they didn't raise any of them and there is some blame

[09:10] to go around.

[09:11] I'm sorry.

[09:12] I know I said we should only blame the top guy but at some point these people and their

[09:17] reputations they went to work for this company.

[09:20] They went into that company every day and they opened up the door and they saw nothing

[09:24] happening.

[09:26] They saw nothing happening on the day Robert Mueller asked for your money.

[09:29] They saw nothing happening on these updates.

[09:31] They saw nothing happening when Robert went on other podcasts and convinced everyone

[09:35] everything was okay.

[09:36] They said nothing a week ago.

[09:38] One week ago and what's crazy about this SEC filing is look at the dates.

[09:44] Look how the dates are matching up by which he was doing all of this fraudulent behavior

[09:49] in the fund.

[09:50] At the same time he was promising the Pimball people stuff was going to work out.

[09:54] This is what con men do.

[09:57] This is what criminals do.

[09:58] It's what crooks do.

[09:59] They lie to your face.

[10:02] We've seen it before with Kevin.

[10:03] We saw it with Andrew Highway.

[10:05] They will look at you and tell you everything is fine when everything is on fire and they'll

[10:11] tell you no more or two weeks away from getting games out the door.

[10:14] This thing is done.

[10:16] This thing is over.

[10:17] You're not getting your rosa.

[10:19] I want to be as clear as I can.

[10:20] You're not getting your rosa Pimball machines.

[10:23] It's done.

[10:24] And if anyone out there in the community, I mean this.

[10:27] If anyone out there even others, well, who's going to make the rosa's now like now that

[10:31] the game's developed, who's going to make these gifts?

[10:34] I will find you and I will hurt you.

[10:36] I mean this.

[10:37] This is over.

[10:39] No rosa, no food truck, no fire in Brimstone, no Merlin's arcade.

[10:44] It's over.

[10:45] You're not getting your goonies from deep root Pimball.

[10:49] You're not getting your floating sylon back box.

[10:51] You're wrap around illuminated artwork.

[10:53] You're not getting any of it.

[10:55] All the delusional people stop.

[10:57] There are so many hardworking people over at Haggis, over at Spooky, over at CGC, over at

[11:04] Stern, over at Jersey Jack Pimball, over at P3 Multimorphic.

[11:07] There are so many hardworking people in Pimball that are struggling every day to make an honest

[11:13] dollar, to make an honest living.

[11:15] It's over.

[11:16] This is done.

[11:17] The wicked witch of Pimball is dead.

[11:20] It's over.

[11:22] His threats, his strong arming people, his bullying everybody, it's over.

[11:26] He's now got a much bigger issue than you and me on Pinside making fun of him.

[11:32] Blueberry Johnson is doing back flips.

[11:34] Ben Heck, you won.

[11:36] Ben Heck won Iceman Zero.

[11:39] Ben Heck is going to come on the show and he's going to tell you the stories of how Robert

[11:43] Mueller, a guy that has never made a single thing in his life, thought he knew how to improve

[11:48] Spooky Pimball and look at how karma has played out.

[11:53] Look at Spooky Pimball's manufacturing line this week and then look at what Robert Mueller

[11:57] is doing.

[11:58] The only thing he has to manufacture now is a defense to stay at a jail.

[12:02] There's nothing happening people.

[12:03] Oh, by the way, I'm back in America.

[12:05] I flew back last night.

[12:07] I'm exhausted if I sound tired.

[12:08] It's because killing is still adjusting a little bit.

[12:11] Deep root is done.

[12:12] You're not getting your Pimball machines.

[12:14] I'm back in America.

[12:16] This has just been a little special report.

[12:17] You have to read this thing.

[12:19] This is going to create so much ammunition.

[12:22] Deep root failing right now is like the greatest news for Jersey Jack and their play field issues.

[12:27] Deep root failing is the greatest news for Chicago gaming companies.

[12:31] Lame ass way to tell us it's Cactus Canyon because this will deflect all the attention for

[12:37] a good amount of time.

[12:39] I see that they're looking to have jury members join this case.

[12:44] I think we need to get Ben Heck on the jury of Deep root and Deep root funds.

[12:48] I mean, that would be amazing.

[12:49] Ben, we got to get it.

[12:50] Go fund me and send you down to Texas and get on that jury.

[12:53] All right, everybody.

[12:54] This has been a little special edition.

[12:55] I will be doing my Saturday morning spectacular in a couple hours.

[12:58] But you know, can it just wants to put stuff up as it happens?

[13:01] Love you guys.

[13:02] Fifth Twippy.

[13:03] We're on our way later.
