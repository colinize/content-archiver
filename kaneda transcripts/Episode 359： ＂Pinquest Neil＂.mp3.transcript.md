[00:00] There ain't a reason you and me should be alone tonight, yeah baby, tonight, yeah baby,

[00:15] I got a reason that you should take me home tonight.

[00:19] Tomato, what are you doing back on the airwaves? You're supposed to be on vacation. I still am on my vacation.

[00:30] I just wanted to put up the interview I did with Neil at PennQuest. It's been a couple weeks

[00:35] since I talked to him and I want to air that for you guys on this episode. Of course,

[00:40] before I do that, I'm going to talk a little bit about the pinball news I've been reading.

[00:45] Just a little bit, I haven't been on Pinside very much. I've been in Vegas, Vegas baby. Vegas

[00:51] has this amazing ability to make each day feel like a week of your life has been taken from you.

[00:58] But not just like a week, a week in which you're eating incredibly large meals, drinking

[01:03] a ton of alcohol and gambling, your pinball fortune away. But we had a great time. I went

[01:10] for work. It's always better when it's a free trip. It's always better because you can gamble

[01:15] with money that it would have cost you to actually get there. Okay, but here's the deal. Let's go

[01:20] over a few news items and then we'll air the interview with Neil. How does that sound? All right.

[01:24] So news item number one that I thought was really cool. George Gomez sent a Deadpool buyer, a

[01:31] signed letter with a katana blade, like a life-size katana blade that I also believe was signed and

[01:39] numbered. And I thought that was super, super cool that they did that. We knew we saw some

[01:44] Facebook posts a while ago in which we saw him signing the blades. I love this. Someone who bought

[01:51] an Ellie immediately responded and said, this is BS. I bought a $9,000 Deadpool and I didn't even

[01:59] get this. I just get a stupid record. And someone who just buys a Deadpool Pro gets the signed

[02:05] katana blade. And I want to tell that person, I don't think your cries are warranted. This is

[02:11] cool. Like I wish more and more pinball companies would do this kind of surprising delight stuff

[02:17] for their buyers. And Stern does this pretty well. After a game has sort of lost a little bit of

[02:22] its momentum, they make a change or they start inserting some, you know, little Easter eggs or

[02:28] surprising delight items to the buyers. You know, sort of like how Batman people were getting

[02:33] signed cards. But this katana, I have to say, this is by far the coolest surprising delight items

[02:41] Stern has ever given any pinball buyer I've ever seen. So well done. I think this is the kind of

[02:48] stuff we want to see more of these manufacturers do. All right. What else is going on? Willy Wonka

[02:54] is on the line. Have we seen a picture of it on the line? Nope. Just take their word for it. It's

[02:59] on the line. Now here's what I'm hearing. They are going to make 150 standard additions and 150

[03:07] Ellie's first. And those are going to go out. Now here's also what I bet happens. Most of these

[03:12] games are not going to go into people's homes. I think maybe just a hundred of them might go into

[03:17] people's homes. But a lot of these are going to go on location. We've seen this strategy before

[03:22] from JJP put the games on location. And that also creates sort of like beta testers for location

[03:28] play. So they can see how the games are doing out there in the wild. We saw this with dialed in.

[03:34] Dialed in ended up being in a lot of different barcades and different pinball venues. And then

[03:40] you know, we saw Pat Lola would go and visit and see how the games were holding up on location

[03:45] play. I'm also hearing that these games are a lot. And I mean, a lot easier to build than

[03:51] pirates of the Caribbean or dialed in or the other Stern games. Did I say other Stern games? See,

[03:57] I'm like Vegas has taken its toll on me, but I don't edit the show. No, they're easier to build than

[04:02] the they are actually easier to no, nothing's easier to build than a Stern game because there's

[04:06] not much in them. But they are easier to build than the other Jersey Jack games. I bet the line workers

[04:13] are are basically enjoying this that it's not going to be as difficult to put together a

[04:19] Willy Wonka, right? Pies the Caribbean total nightmare to build. And we're seeing that still like in

[04:24] the threads, the quality of those games they keep breaking down. But here's the one thing. And you

[04:29] know how I feel about Wonka. I want to see where the code is at. And we're going to get to see

[04:35] where this game is at very, very soon. So we should see this game. I'm hearing by July 4th. These

[04:41] games will start to arrive for people, whether in their homes or on location. We have not seen,

[04:47] you know how I feel. We haven't seen any code that shows what I'm really looking for, which is

[04:54] clips from the movie with audio from the movie. And I need to see that. I kind of feel like it's

[05:00] beginning to become a little bit of a deal breaker moment for me. I get the game is one of the best

[05:04] layouts. I get the game is fun to shoot. But man, I don't want to own a Willy Wonka game unless it

[05:10] feels like the Willy Wonka movie. And I'm sorry, but like that's just me. All right. Okay. What else

[05:16] is going on? So they revealed the total the total number. I can't even speak. Anyway, I'm going to do

[05:21] this show. The total number of pirates of the Caribbean's that were made. Now you're ready for

[05:26] this 1000 total pirates of the Caribbean's have been made. Here's the breakdown, which is funny.

[05:32] There were 650 LEs made 200 collectors editions and 150 standard edition versions of

[05:42] pirates of the Caribbean. Now why is that funny? Well, because the standard edition is in fact,

[05:49] the rarest and most limited version of the game. I had a laugh when I saw that.

[05:56] Not how it's supposed to be, Jack. The base level is not supposed to be the rarest,

[06:01] most exclusive version of the game. But we all know, we all know if people do want a version of

[06:07] the game. There's a reason why the standard editions, they didn't make many of them. I've never

[06:11] understood anyone who buys a standard edition Jersey Jack game because they're still so expensive.

[06:16] They're not cheap. The standard wonka will be the first one that is much cheaper than the LE.

[06:22] But a standard edition, I think pirates is only like $500 or less or not a significant savings.

[06:27] And they also remove stuff that people would want like the starring map. And I think the guy,

[06:32] the rotating pup bumper dude. So there's stuff that's not in the game. But so that's where we're

[06:38] at with pirates of the Caribbean. Do I think pirates of the Caribbean will ever be remade? My answer,

[06:44] and even though Jack says maybe, I don't think so. I don't think you're ever going to see this

[06:48] game remade. The reason why was kept coming back is was sales were always very, very strong.

[06:54] Pirate sales were not. And I think you're going to see only 1,000 pirates of the Caribbean's ever

[07:00] go on the line. And also with guns and roses and toy story, you know, and look, and that's,

[07:06] they're not stopping there. They're developing games after toy story. Remember guns and roses

[07:10] and toy story has been a rumor for a very long time. So I fully expect to see Jersey Jack have

[07:16] another exciting title after those two. You know, would it be like the goonies or something really

[07:21] fun like that? Will they do the matrix? I don't know. You know, will Harry Potter not happening?

[07:26] But you know what I'm saying is like Jersey Jack Pimball is not basically saying we got two more

[07:30] games after Wanken. We're closing up doors. Jack is going to continue to give people, I think,

[07:38] you know, games that are based on big themes that you're going to want. He's learned his lesson

[07:41] hopefully in that category. So, you know, I don't think there's going to be a down period in which,

[07:47] you know, he's been like, oh, let's try to recreate to man for pirates. Okay. All right. So

[07:53] Tommy Floyd, he's out at Nitro Pimball. We talked a lot about that on the little short episode I

[07:59] did before this one. And look, here's a deal. Here's a deal. Tommy made a huge mistake. Tommy

[08:06] apologized to everybody, questionable apology at first. But here's the thing. We should live in a

[08:13] society in which if someone makes a mistake like he made and steps down from his company and goes

[08:19] to get help for alcoholism and his issues with alcohol. And that is what he's doing. He's

[08:24] removing himself from the company and he's going to seek help for what he did. I think we all have

[08:32] to allow the man to have some, you know, convalescence to heal from this, to learn from this,

[08:39] to change from this. You know, sometimes when I hear people say like, oh, no, we can never forgive him.

[08:45] And look, it doesn't mean people have to ultimately forgive him. But, but I think it's more

[08:52] dangerous to live in a society in which people when they do go get help for a serious issue they have

[08:59] that we don't give them another chance to be a part of society and be part of a community like

[09:06] Pimbal. So I think Tommy's doing the right thing. I think, you know, obviously he has an issue with

[09:11] drinking. We always would like to see people get help before it gets to this level. But this is

[09:16] rock bottom for the man. And I think if he gets the help he needs and it's going to take a while,

[09:22] right? This isn't something like a week later. You're back on the scene being like, all right,

[09:25] I'm done. No, it's not like that. But I do think we all should have in our hearts the capacity

[09:31] to forgive someone like Tommy for what he does if he, if he, you know, gets the help he needs. But

[09:36] ultimately, ultimately, the forgiveness needs to be from Aaron to him. And I think the ultimate

[09:43] path back for him is if Aaron does forgive him one day and sees that he's actually become a

[09:49] different person and her asking the community to forgive him would be the ultimate way back in.

[09:55] But we are a long way from that. And I just want to say that Tommy, I hope you get the help you

[10:00] need, all right? And let's move on from that because I think it was a terrible moment in Pimbal.

[10:04] And we're going to, we're going to, you know, not keep talking about it. All right. So the

[10:08] monster's topper is coming out. Finally, right? Where's the Star Wars topper? Nobody knows. It's

[10:14] lost in a galaxy far, far away. But the monster's topper is coming out. It's got like four figures

[10:20] on it. And then the Kuku clock in the middle. Here's the one thing that's really strange about it.

[10:23] There will only be a color version of the monster's topper. So if you have a black and white

[10:29] game, why can't you get a black and white version of the monster's topper? I'll tell you why. And I

[10:36] say this all the time, Stern being lazy. It's lazy. How hard is it for them to put in an order

[10:44] for black and white versions of the topper? They don't want to do that. They just want to make

[10:48] a bulk order. And so I think it's silly that black and white premium buyers can't get a black and

[10:53] white version of the topper. Come on, George, I know you guys listen to the show. Stop doing these

[10:59] lazy things. I know it probably makes it's easier for you guys to do the way you're doing it. Just

[11:04] put a bulk order in for color versions. And then, and then it fits every game. But you made a black

[11:09] and white version of the game. So make it special. See, this is why they messed up the whole thing

[11:13] with the black and white. The black and white should have been the Ellie and then the Ellie buyers

[11:19] for $9,000. The Ellie buyers should have got a black and white version of the game and a black and

[11:25] white topper. Here's the here's the here's the reason here's the way they should have got it. Black and

[11:30] white people should the Ellie buyers should get a topper included in their game. All right, included

[11:36] for $9,000 black and white monsters with a black and white topper everything black and white. And

[11:41] there's only 500 of them. That means you only have to order 500 of those black and white toppers

[11:47] to make or whatever 600 Ellie's anyway, they didn't do it. But it is what it is. Topper gate is

[11:53] really the whole thing over at Stern. They just can't seem to sync up the toppers with when the

[11:57] games come out. All right, what else is going on? So there was a Stern in the Union address. And

[12:02] there is no mention of new monsters code coming, which has people being like, oh, are they have

[12:07] given up on the game? Look, we all know that Dwight is not the king of like continuing to work on

[12:13] code. It was like 29 months later and there's still no ghostbusters updates. So keep holding your

[12:17] breath for the monsters code and you'll surely die a death as you wait for that. All right, what else

[12:24] is going on? There's new Batman code coming. I mean, that's like pouring that's like pouring lemon

[12:30] on the wound. The fact that Batman has more code updates coming and the game is already kind of

[12:34] perfect and they're continuing to polish it, but that's Lyman. All right, what else is going on?

[12:39] We want to wish a few people who have had some health issues, the best of health and getting

[12:46] back to good health and and speedy recoveries because we talk a lot about like pinball and all

[12:52] this stuff, but ultimately nothing matters when you're sick and nothing matters when you're having

[12:57] a hard time and nothing matters when you know, you have a possibility of of having a serious health

[13:01] issue and you might have to leave us and we don't want that. So we want to wish Todd Tucky,

[13:08] Keith Johnson and Sam Harvey, a speedy recovery and many, many more years of getting back to good

[13:16] health. And I know we don't really want to talk about these more serious issues, but I've walked

[13:23] around the pinball shows. I've seen the people in the hobby. Everyone is not in the best of shape.

[13:29] And you know, it's up to each person how they want to treat themselves and I really do hope that

[13:34] all of you out there who are really, you know, everybody, not just like significant pinball

[13:40] coders and designers and hobbyists, but everybody, take care of yourself. I don't enjoy waking up

[13:47] and feeling like crap and put the sugary sodas down, put the high carb items down, you know,

[13:54] you're going to feel like crap. And so we all should get behind each other when it comes to

[13:59] taking care of ourselves. I think that's just like part of being a responsible member of the

[14:03] community is just like if you see someone you know, it looks like, you know, they're not doing very

[14:08] well in terms of their health, like maybe say like, you know, give some words of encouragement. All

[14:12] right. All right. What else is going on? Elvira herself, Cassandra, she has let the cat out of the bag

[14:18] and confirmed that Elvira 3 will be coming out in October from Stern pinball. So look, this is

[14:26] like the worst kept secret. We knew it was happening. I think it is funny that she has confirmed it.

[14:31] This is like two times in a row in which Cassandra and her people have confirmed the game before

[14:37] Stern has actually confirmed it. But that is good news. It makes perfect sense that Elvira would

[14:43] arrive right around Halloween, right around Expo, perfect, perfect timing. So now we know we're going

[14:49] to have something along the lines of an Elvira versus Raza competition. No, no, no, no. Anyway,

[14:57] anything else going on in the pinball news, deep route we talked about that. The forever fall,

[15:03] that will be a 24 month period before you see anything. It's been, it's, it's felt refreshing.

[15:10] I don't sound it again because Vegas just destroyed me, but it's been refreshing to sort of step

[15:15] away from pinside and all this stuff. And you know, as we, as we called it, there's just not much news.

[15:21] This stuff is not significant. Ultimately, I look forward to the next few weeks. I look forward

[15:27] to seeing what people's reaction to Willy Wonka is when it actually makes its way into people's homes.

[15:34] Because that is when we're really going to see what the software of this game will be. I mean,

[15:40] it's important. Jersey Jack games have always delivered a higher caliber, I believe, of software

[15:47] and sound and music. And this one has me anxious. Now also people out there are like, you're not

[15:53] allowed to change your opinion about Willy Wonka. Well, I am not. I have to stick to it. No,

[15:59] I've got my collectors addition to positive down. But that is where I am. I'm just excited to see

[16:05] what people say when they get it. Right. I'm seeing games like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. People

[16:10] are loving it. A game, the more I look at the game, the more I read people's feedback on the game,

[16:17] the more I'm like, it looks like a really solid offering. I mean, Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[16:22] versus like a Munster's Pro. I kind of would rather have Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle. I have to

[16:29] say. And you know, it's just a great looking game. And the code, it sounds like Moore is coming in it.

[16:35] And yeah, there's shots are tight. But people are loving it. And I think Chuck Will sell all of them.

[16:41] They're not sold out. If you want one, they are very close. They have a few more left. I'm called

[16:46] them up. I think they're in like the high 400s now. And by the time the game is, you know, is

[16:52] finally done, they will sell all of them. I mean, I'm not, I'm not like, I'm not surprised. But I

[16:58] think the game has got really great word of mouth. And that's how it should be. All right, I'm going

[17:03] to air the interview. I can't, I'm like dead. You might, you can hear my voice. I haven't had

[17:07] like sleep in like three days. I'm going to air the interview with Neil. Enjoy it. I'm going to

[17:12] France next week, next Friday. And then I'm there for like a week. So no more shows until

[17:20] sometime in later June. So enjoy this one. The next show I will do. And I, and someone brought

[17:27] this to my attention. And that was Jack Danger, something I want to talk about that no one's talking

[17:31] about. It's this bait and switch going on in which some of these, you know, pinball sort of

[17:38] charities and and and pinball locations are doing fun razors in which they say the money is going

[17:44] to go for a good cause. And then the money doesn't go there. And I think it's total BS. You should

[17:50] go on dead flips Facebook page and read all about this because I think this is another one of the

[17:56] intolerable things that is happening in our hobby. And us pinball podcasters and us pinball media,

[18:04] we have a responsibility to point a light at this stuff. You know, I didn't even hear a lot of

[18:09] the pinball podcasts talk about Tommy and what happened there like what what is going on? If you

[18:14] have a pinball podcast and you're covering what's going on in the hobby, it's not always roses. And

[18:19] if something goes on the hobby that is a bad reflection of what goes on in the hobby, I don't think

[18:26] you just should like ignore it. And you know, I'll never ignore it. I run right towards these things.

[18:31] And I will expose these things when they should be exposed. But honestly collecting money

[18:37] to go towards good causes and then not contributing those money to those causes. And that is

[18:44] despicable. And we're going to call out the people who have done that on the next show. And but until

[18:50] we do that, here's Neil from Pinguest has got a really interesting sort of app and sort of pinball

[18:57] experience that he wants you guys to enjoy. So I'll air that right now. Have a great week and

[19:01] everyone. We'll be back. Who knows when, but we will be back. Goodbye. All right, ladies and gentlemen,

[19:08] there is a rumor that there is no news in the pinball world, but that rumor is incorrect because

[19:14] I'm here today to talk to Neil Shelton about something new cooking in the pinball hobby. Neil,

[19:21] welcome to the show. Hey Chris, thanks for having me, man. I'm happy to have you on here because the

[19:27] thing you're working on, I think, is going to make playing pinball out in the world more exciting.

[19:33] Now what I want to do is sort of have you introduce us and the listeners of the show to what you've

[19:39] been working on to make location pin a more exciting experience. Is that is that a fair assessment of

[19:45] what you've been cooking up? Oh, absolutely. So let's kind of go into the background, I guess, a little

[19:54] app. It's going to be called pin quest. This week in pinball did an article last week on it. So if

[20:00] you haven't seen that, make sure you do check that out. But basically the premise is to do exactly

[20:05] what you just said, man, make location pinball fun. So I'm an operator. I have one location. I just

[20:11] absolutely love it. Man, I don't really make a ton of money doing it, but I'm always seeing people,

[20:15] you know, playing machines, novices stepping up to machine, dropping a couple quarters and walking

[20:20] away, not really having any idea what the heck they're doing. So this whole app is to try and get people

[20:28] to play a game and try and achieve something. A lot of people aren't going to be able to walk up to

[20:32] machine and get a grand champion score out the gate. So hopefully with this app, giving people

[20:37] tasks and goals, it's going to make plan pinball a lot more fun on location.

[20:43] Right. Because right now, if you are a novice and you just walk up to a pinball machine at a bar

[20:50] or at an operator's location, it's pretty intimidating. When you see people for the first time,

[20:56] come up to machine meal. What do you witness when you see that?

[21:01] Well, first of all, I witness, hey, what machine do I relate with? Which happens to be our Super Mario

[21:08] machine all the time. So number one thing is theme. They'll drop quarters, they'll hack a ball around,

[21:14] and then they'll walk off and say, hey, that was fun. I just spent 50 cents for a minute of play.

[21:19] So what cell do you have on location right now?

[21:23] All right. We got 15 in the lineup. We've got a tack from Mars. We have a monster bash. We have

[21:30] a Star Wars star track, Twilight Zone, Ghostbusters, Guardians of the Galaxy, Super Mario,

[21:37] Creature from the Black Lagoon, South Park, Deadpool, the monsters. I know I'm leaving something out,

[21:45] but that's a pretty good run through of most of the machines.

[21:48] And where are these games located?

[21:51] The other in a brewery, a family-friendly brewery in Brunfield, Colorado, called Wonderland.

[21:58] Do you guys have an October Fest on order since it's a brewery? Is that mandatory that you buy it?

[22:08] So the owner of the brewery, he has a couple of machines in there, and I told him that's one

[22:11] for him, just as an operator with a split man. I can't be dropping money on anything really over

[22:16] the stern pro limits. I let him handle all of the higher cost games like the Ellie. He's got the

[22:22] Ellie attack from Mars, medieval madness, and monster bash. So I'll let him handle that since he

[22:27] gets liquor revenue too. Okay. So for listener of the show, just to sort of, let's go back to pin quest.

[22:34] So Niels pin quest, the way this works, is you put in your zip code, right? And it tells you,

[22:41] different objectives that are tied to different games near your location, right?

[22:48] Yeah, exactly. I'll give a quick rundown of the process.

[22:54] Yeah, let's do that.

[22:55] Yeah, so it's not an actual physical app. The reason we did that is just because the cost

[23:01] in going to develop apps for Android and iOS is pretty steep, man. So we started with a web app.

[23:09] Things pick up will definitely come out with some native apps, but you visit pinquest.com.

[23:14] It's going to take you to the website. There's some FAQs, how to play stuff like that. If people

[23:19] have no idea what the heck they're doing, then there's a link that takes you directly into the actual

[23:24] app. Then once you're in the app, basically, you say, hey, allow GPS to find me with a location.

[23:32] If you're not comfortable allowing for GPS to find you, you can search by zip code. It will then

[23:38] pull up locations that are participating in quests. You'll then click on location. They'll pop up

[23:46] a bunch of different quests. And what a quest is composed of is different missions that a location

[23:51] specifically sets. So it's on the location to determine these missions and these quests.

[23:57] So I'll give you a quick example. Let's say we see a quest and it's called space quest. So

[24:03] space quest could be composed of, let's say you got a score 1.5 billion on star wars.

[24:11] And you have to score 250 million on star track. Once you achieve those goals, a box gets checked.

[24:20] You have to do this with verification via a photo and a manual input of your score.

[24:26] Once you achieve those, you win a prize that the bar determines. And you also win a digital

[24:31] achievement trophy that gets put into a trophy case for you. And you can share that on social media

[24:37] with all of your friends. So let's talk about the verification because you know, if anyone is going

[24:41] to try and game this system, it's going to be me stealing everyone else's photos of their high score

[24:46] because I am the greatest pinball player. So when, so let's say the person goes up there,

[24:51] they get 1.5 billion on star wars. They then take a photo of it with their phone and upload it

[24:59] into pin quest. Now, how do you make sure that people are not using multiple photos and, you know,

[25:06] of that score? Sure. Great question, man. And this has been one of the biggest hurdles of trying

[25:12] to figure that out. So first thing, we are writing code into the camera that if someone inputs,

[25:20] or sign up the camera, but the app that if someone inputs a score within a certain duration of time

[25:25] that has been used, it will not be validated. So the chances of scoring the exact same score are

[25:31] pretty dang slim. You know, when you're in the millions and billions of scores could happen. Yeah,

[25:37] I'm sure it could, but the chances I feel pretty slim about and if it upset someone, you know, so

[25:43] so that's interesting. So each score is almost acting as a barcode, if you will, for

[25:48] if you receive duplicates of the same 1.5, 7, 8, 3, 2, 1, Bill, you know, it's you, you will

[25:56] a duplicate sends a warning into the system that says, nope, throw it out. Yep.

[26:03] Okay. Yeah, and we'll have some sort of expiration on that. The big issue with that is if you

[26:07] achieve that quest score or the mission score and then you walk away from the machine, it's still

[26:11] on there. So someone could easily come up and snap that and we definitely know that's a possible

[26:17] issue in a loop. So that that was the best way to kind of close that up is if you use a score that's

[26:22] been used, it's going to tell you nah, okay, that makes sense. Also, yeah, and we won't accept a

[26:30] location won't be able to accept, you know, a high score or a grand champion score. So it's very

[26:35] clear that you need to snap the photo on, you know, the previous game screen where it is not

[26:40] displaying a grand champion or a high score. Okay. All right. So that's how we validate the,

[26:47] so when people put it in, then the prizes and what people are playing for is that is the goal

[26:53] of this whole thing to get operators to is the reward in real time, like get this score and get

[27:00] like a beer or get something like what are the prizes? What kinds of things are you guys thinking

[27:04] about? Sure, man. That's completely up to the location what they want to do as far as prizes go.

[27:10] You know, if it's a beer at the end of the, they complete a quest and yeah, that's awesome. If

[27:14] someone wants to go absolutely nuts and make some ridiculously hard quest and give away a TV,

[27:19] they can do that as well. You know, they just need to know what the their local, I guess, gaming

[27:24] laws are going to be when it comes to some sort of redemption, I will say. But yeah,

[27:29] Skies the limit if they don't want to give anything away and they just simply want to, you know,

[27:33] give away the digital achievements. We somewhere down the road would like to establish some type of

[27:40] system where people can redeem trophies for official pin quest gear and that's going to be down

[27:46] the road. But we definitely want to, you know, give some incentive of why you should go around

[27:51] to different locations and try and earn as many trophies as possible and ultimately help the

[27:56] hobby, help the operators and help the locations and ultimately help pinball. I'll just, you know,

[28:03] right. So in essence, Neil, you're sort of turning pinball into somewhat of a redemption game with

[28:12] this. Yeah, yeah, which is not a bad thing because we hear all the time that when you talk about

[28:19] operating coin out machines in 2019, redemption games are slaying it for operators much more than

[28:26] pinball. So there's there's more of an incentive if you will to play if there's some sort of prize

[28:33] waiting for you other than just the pinball experience, which you also get, it seems like with this

[28:39] this process, right? Yeah, absolutely. So people are willing to drop, you know, 20, 30 bucks in a coin,

[28:46] push, or I always laugh when I go to our local Dave and Busters, you know, just to try and win a

[28:53] PlayStation 4 that would, you know, cost you 300 bucks at the store, but they're going to spend

[28:58] $4,000 on coin pusher by the time they they earn that thing. So they're willing to do that. Why not

[29:03] give them the experience of playing an actual game of pinball and shooting for high scores in the

[29:07] process? Right. So from your standpoint, how do you guys, how do you monetize it on your end?

[29:14] Yeah, so monetization, great question. We will be charging locations, a monthly subscription fee to

[29:21] have access to it. It's going to be less than 20 bucks for a location. If people do have multiple

[29:27] locations, we will have some sort of some sort of a price break. We're going to have trial periods

[29:32] to make sure it's a good fit for everybody. We're going to give people probably a first month free

[29:38] just to make sure it is, you know, it's worth it for them. People will be able to cancel at any point,

[29:43] or, you know, I don't believe in locking people into contracts. If something's not working for them,

[29:47] they can easily walk away. Other forms of monetization are we will have banner space within that

[29:55] specific to the industry. I really don't want to allow out to Google and have banner ads. I just

[30:00] ran them crap in there. I'd really like to fill that with stuff to to really help the industry grow.

[30:06] You know, good example is, you know, putting a link to your podcast or to Jeff over at this

[30:13] weekend pinball or a distributor if they wanted to buy some space in there and, you know, get people

[30:19] that may not know how the heck to buy a pinball machine. Maybe they see a distributor pop up and

[30:25] they say, oh, that's how you do it. So that's another way. It will be completely free for the end user.

[30:32] So when you do go to a location, there is no cost to use it, try and earn the prizes or the achievement trophies.

[30:39] So is it, you know, when you put it, it's an app on your phone. Does it push notification to you

[30:45] as the end user saying, hey, Chris, like, there's a new challenge or objective waiting on

[30:51] Wizard of Oz at Sunshine Laundromad. And so there's like, do I get a push notification letting me know

[30:55] when new new objectives are there? Do I have to go there first to see? Yeah, not right now,

[31:01] but that is something we're definitely going to work on. Man, I'd say we are about 90% of where this

[31:07] thing should be to get me where I'd be happy with launch. And that is definitely one of those

[31:12] things that I need to figure out is how to make the push enabled. Otherwise, as it is right now,

[31:17] you do need to log in and just refresh and see if any new quests have popped up in your area.

[31:21] Cool. And are you talking to any of the manufacturers? I mean, it sounds like something that might be

[31:26] interesting to roll out with like the Stern Army tour, right? So where there's already like organized

[31:32] events like IFPA, are you talking to those guys to sort of get this sort of become an

[31:37] ancillary activity within the existing pinball sort of community? Yeah, great question, man. Yes,

[31:45] I've had conversations with different manufacturers. I do have a manufacturer on board to do a sample

[31:53] quest with me. We are pleased on say officially want. It's pleased on say deep root. It's not deep

[32:00] root. Okay. I was like, because you do know, they're not going to make the most games ever this year.

[32:10] Yeah, man. But now we're launching it. We're kind of doing our beta launch this week at the Rocky Mountain

[32:15] Pinball Showdown here in Colorado. So all Memorial Day weekend, we're going to have a booth. I have

[32:20] thousands of dollars worth of prizes that are specific to pinquest, t-shirts, pint glasses,

[32:26] pop sockets, coin tubes. I mean, we have a bunch of cool stuff to give away the specific. I don't

[32:32] want to name the manufacturer quite yet because we're still tying some things up, but they are

[32:37] going to provide a limited number of prizes that folks will pretty much be in a race to get because

[32:45] once they're gone, they will be gone. People will still earn the achievement badge once those

[32:50] prizes are gone, but they are going to be in limited number. Okay. And so right now, Neil, can

[32:57] people start using pinquest? Not yet. Give us a launch date and don't say two weeks.

[33:06] Yeah. My goal is by July 1st to allow locations nationwide and even possibly worldwide.

[33:16] When this weekend pinball article came out, we had interest from about 15 states and one international

[33:22] location, which kind of surprised me right out of the gate. So I've told all of them that,

[33:27] you know, if everything goes smooth with the beta launch, I just need to tighten up some things on

[33:32] my end to get payment systems in place and then we'll be able to start pretty much offering it.

[33:38] It's pretty plug and pay. Man, everything's there. I just need to make sure that there's no bugs

[33:42] that pop up. Otherwise, we're ready to roll. Awesome. You know, just a little like a marketing tip

[33:49] as I see stuff like this when it comes out. You know what it'd be great to is when a major show is

[33:55] happening, like a TPA for a pinburg, it's always good at these big shows where you have a large volume

[34:01] of pinheads in one place to have sort of pinquest sort of hyper localized at that event with the

[34:10] objectives and the games are all there, right? And that way you just get a lot of people downloading it,

[34:14] using it and all the games are there. And then you can also have like the prizes and the redemption

[34:18] happen all in one place. You know, just to give people in a very localized area, sort of like a

[34:25] beta run of what it's going to be like, I think that's another good thing that would happen with this.

[34:30] So yeah, that's exactly what's what's going to be going down, man. That's a great point. And I mean,

[34:35] just imagine the different venture this could, you know, are the different tastes. This could add to

[34:41] an expo are a big tournament. You're, you know, you're waiting for your turn to play. What if there's a

[34:46] bank of pinquest games? You can go over there trying chip away, trying win a prize. I mean, it has a

[34:51] whole different element pretty much any sort of organized tournament play. Right. So what was the

[34:58] what was the origin of this like really like what drove you to wake up one day and say, you know what,

[35:03] I'm going to try and create another fun way to pull people into playing pinball machines.

[35:10] Yeah, that's a great question. Again, it just came down to watching people at our location. We would

[35:15] do a thing called the great reset every year, once a year, January 1st, I would reset all of the

[35:22] high scores. And at the end of the month, whoever had the grand champion scores would get a grand

[35:27] champion t-shirt. And I mean, that was it once a year. Other locations would give away a free beer

[35:32] for the grand champion, but they were reset and grand champion scores every month. And I don't

[35:36] know, man, I think that's a coveted thing. I don't think those things should be reset once a month.

[35:40] So I was kind of just thinking of a way to add more excitement. It seems like when people have

[35:46] something to shoot for, we get a heck of a lot more quarter drops in our machines. So, so that was

[35:51] really the whole, the whole driver behind it. Yeah, it makes sense. I think right now, and this

[35:58] has always been my issue, because you know, you listen to this podcast, and I don't talk a lot about

[36:02] tournament play. And mainly it's not just because I'm not into it. It's even locally for me. It's

[36:10] a huge time suck to commit to like, league nights and constantly going in like a few days a week.

[36:17] You know, it's three, four hours at times, but this sort of opens up the ability to engage

[36:23] in competitive pinball playing, but on your schedule, on when you can do it, and when you can get

[36:31] around to it, which I think is interesting, because right now there's nothing really like that.

[36:36] Correct. Yeah, I kind of like to make the, and weird way is kind of like a Pokemon go, you know,

[36:42] you go to a place that's a worldwide phenomenon. You know, a lot of pinball players probably are

[36:46] a little bit past the Pokemon craze, but the up and coming generation, they know what's going on

[36:51] with that. You know, you go to location, you want to achieve this, you want to catch that trophy,

[36:54] or earn that trophy, and you kind of want to, you know, want to, want up everyone else around you.

[37:00] I will have a digital leaderboard also with trophies, so people will be able to kind of compete

[37:05] in that manner. And you know, see who can earn the most trophies.

[37:08] Do you, when you look at innovation in pinball and you're, you know, you're sort of looking at

[37:14] innovating competitive pinball play and sort of adding it redemption and incentives to the whole

[37:20] playing pinball out on location. Let's talk for a little bit about internet connectivity with pinball.

[37:26] Do you think it's coming and do you think that could help advance this initiative to the next level as well?

[37:33] Oh, yeah, if we got connectivity that would make my life a lot easier, you know, we'd be able to

[37:37] validate scores without actually having to put an individual, you know, in the process. As it is

[37:44] right now, you complete a quest, you have to go to a bartender. They're the ones verifying your

[37:49] scores, making sure everything's kosher on that and giving you the prize. If we had connectivity,

[37:55] you know, the app could shoot a score directly to, I'm sorry, the pinball machine could shoot a

[38:00] score directly to our app and validate it and take that human element out of it. Right. So I think

[38:04] it does need to happen. I know there's a cool company out there called scorebit. I don't know if

[38:09] you've seen anything about them. I think they've been set up at a few places. They, they're broadcasting

[38:14] live scoring. It's a, I believe it's a piece of hardware that you plug into a machine. So, you know,

[38:20] they're working on something. I look, Stern pinball is this is, people keep thinking I'm crazy on

[38:26] this show, Neil, for being like internet connectivity to pinballs coming. It's coming. And like,

[38:31] Stern is like, even said it's coming. And people, I think this is going to be the next big evolution

[38:38] in pinball is when Stern goes connected and networked. I think it's going to change the way the game,

[38:45] not not the way the game is played, per se, but the experience of playing pinball is going to change

[38:50] with scoreboards and leaderboards and and the ability to have cameras on games where you can see your

[38:55] friends playing while you're playing. And you know, all that stuff's going to come.

[38:59] Yep. I agree. I think the challenge is kind of like, I think Ben Hekwasan is the the amount of

[39:05] games versus the user base. That's, I think that's going to be the big challenge that we see with,

[39:10] you know, head to head type of stuff. But I can absolutely see, you know, digital national

[39:14] ranks scoreboards and stuff like that. And I think the big challenge is ultimately going to keep

[39:19] people from cheating. It's going to suck if there's a big scoreboard out there and someone's in

[39:23] their basement sliding that glass off and you know, just hitting super jackpots over and over. So

[39:28] it's really just trying to figure out a way to keep the integrity of the online gaming. I think

[39:31] that's the biggest challenge. Yep. Yeah. I mean, they're pretty much going to throw out every score,

[39:37] Canada submits when it goes online because I'm just going to sit there with like my finger be like,

[39:42] oh look at this 800 billion again on my first call. Well, look, this is really exciting. You know,

[39:49] I mean, Pinquest, it's coming July. You're a fan of pinball. So I'd love to keep you on the show.

[39:55] And let's just talk about, you want to talk about what's going on in the hobby. I mean, I always

[39:58] like to get another point of view on stuff. So are you yourself a new inbox collector or an older

[40:04] game collector? Are you more about putting games on location? Do you have any games in the home?

[40:08] Like what's your pinball world like? Yeah, and this is going to go back to kind of the origins

[40:14] of how I got started. So I'm 33. So, you know, I'd say I'm probably young in the hobby. Yeah. Yeah,

[40:20] absolutely. I bought my dad a couple of clunker pinball machines because he loved him growing up

[40:26] for Christmas a couple years ago through actually four years ago now and took him to his house,

[40:32] played him and I said, oh, shit, now I want one. And then you know how it goes, man, you get one,

[40:36] then you get two, then you get three. So next thing, you know, I have seven of them in my house

[40:42] right when you walk in the door and my fiance now wife, she goes, so yeah, I didn't plan on

[40:49] moving into our cage. So you need to do something about this. So I, you know, I said, okay, I'll try

[40:56] and find a bar fast forward games are in a bar. I finished my basement. I gave myself room for

[41:01] three games. So no, I'm not a new inbox collector for my personal collection. I am a new inbox,

[41:08] type a guy for location because, you know, man, this is not my full-time job. This is purely a

[41:14] passion. I need reliable games on location. When I started, I had a lot of, you know, your classic

[41:21] ballies. The only got-leab game I've actually ever had on location is the Super Mario and believe

[41:27] that that thing's just a tank man. Nothing goes wrong with it. It's working all the time. Great

[41:32] machine. But yeah, over the years, we've upgraded. We've gotten all new inbox turn. We try and keep

[41:39] a fresh line up there. And Stern pros, I mean, as an operator, are they just the way to go?

[41:46] Absolutely, man, I can't even fathom why you would spend the additional four to $6,000 on an

[41:52] LE or a premium when they're just going to get beat up. It's not attractive for resale for an

[41:58] operated machine. You know, you're giving yourself more mechanical issues, I feel like, with

[42:05] the premiums and LEs. So yeah, I think all manufacturers need to come down to that level because

[42:12] on location, all the matters is the theme. Someone's going to walk up to a machine as long as it's

[42:18] not completely barren. And if they connect with a theme, they'll play it regardless of how many

[42:22] excessive bells and whistles there are in my personal opinion. Right. And maybe I'm making this

[42:28] up. But you were saying, Super Mario Brothers is a great earner for you, right?

[42:33] Best earner, man. Besides the newest release, you know, our new release will always kill something

[42:39] and then once everything levels out, it's right back to Super Mario. That's incredible.

[42:44] Yep. So it goes to show, right? I mean, we talk a lot about theme on this show. And

[42:50] and so let's let's talk about Jersey Jack and location play because we keep hearing that Jersey

[42:57] Jack is specifically making Willie Wonka like their location bet in terms of the way they're

[43:05] going to code it in terms of the pricing of it, the standard edition, 7500. What do you think about

[43:11] Willie Wonka as a location based game? Coming from a guy who had a Wizard of Oz still have a

[43:20] Wizard of Oz. It operated awesome on location for a couple years. Unfortunately, one thing went wrong

[43:28] and it's just kind of been the typical one thing after another once something seems to happen on

[43:34] there. So currently it's offline. So I, you know, I love Jack's games. They're beautiful. Like you

[43:40] always say they're really the only manufacturer that has a world under glass. They draw eyes when

[43:46] they're on location. So to kind of loop back to what you're asking there, I, if they made a

[43:53] game suited for location that doesn't have a ton of stuff that can potentially go wrong, I think

[43:58] their games are fantastic. I agree with you on the code with these games. I think there needs to be

[44:05] split code for home use and location play. Right. Is it kind of, I mean, like Pirates is a good example,

[44:14] is if they just had a location code that just auto-selected your character and just instead of all

[44:22] that, you know, you can't have all that complexity on location. Yeah, I mean, look at Game of Thrones.

[44:29] If you turn it on, I think basic mode, it'll select your house for you right away and you can

[44:33] just hop into a game. You don't have to worry about stacking all the different houses and

[44:38] not really having an idea what you're doing. So I think if Stern can do that and make that an

[44:43] option, I don't know why other manufacturers can't program something basic like that into a game.

[44:49] Right. And so, and I think we're hearing now too. And there's more to come on this topic,

[44:53] obviously, with Willie Wonka. I think the Munster is doing this as well, is we're seeing more

[44:58] basic code and simple code and approachable coding in a game because these games are, you know,

[45:05] people are speculating maybe these games are being made to be more operator friendly. But then

[45:10] you have the tradeoff of the home buyer who wants that level of depth and complexity because he

[45:16] wants to own it for years is upset that the game might be shallow, right. And I'm going to buy the

[45:22] game and then figure out it's not going to be a long-term keeper. Do you think that's a cherubum?

[45:27] Do you think that these companies need to start addressing this a little differently?

[45:31] Yeah, absolutely. I think there needs to be location machines and code and home use machines and

[45:37] code. I do think that's something that's super important. I also think they need to be very conscious

[45:43] of what the cost is for the location and definitely give a little bit more support when it comes to

[45:52] a warranty running out on a game. And these things aren't cheap to keep running on location.

[45:55] You know, something does go wrong. It's usually something pretty pricey that can eat away at an

[46:00] entire, you know, weeks, a couple weeks of earnings. Right. So a game like Black Knight sort of rage.

[46:09] You know, how is that from an operator standpoint? Do you look at that like it's banking so much

[46:15] on the heritage of the Black Knight pinball franchise, which most people walking into a brewery are

[46:21] probably unfamiliar with? What do you think? Do you think that game like crushes it on location or

[46:26] fails? Well, I can tell you we passed on it because of the theme. And you know, I almost got the

[46:33] new inbox fever and pulled the trigger on it, which I did do with monsters. And I don't think Black

[46:42] Knight honestly is going to get great earner for our location. I think at your, you know, your true

[46:48] pinball bar that gets a lot of the classic gamers out. I think it could, could do decent, but we're

[46:54] we're definitely not we're a kid friendly brewery. I don't think it would, it would do very good.

[46:58] That's why kind of chose not to do not to pick one up. Right. It's interesting. Cause you know,

[47:04] the fact that they're in. Yeah. I mean, it is barren. I mean, I played it at sunshine. And I was

[47:10] surprised how little is in that game. But whenever a new game comes out, I think it has a window in

[47:16] which it probably earns really well the first month or two because a lot of the, I would say the

[47:22] repeat pinball fanatics in the neighborhood are coming by to play the new games. I mean, that's

[47:27] what we do. But if a casual person walks into sunshine and they've got medieval madness, they've

[47:33] got all these other games. I don't know. I don't think it's like crushing it. So what about

[47:39] monsters though? So how's that doing? Cause you have one on location. I do him out the gate. It earned

[47:45] really, really well just because it was the new game. Now it's kind of, you know, it's hovering

[47:50] around the middle. It's one of the newer games. It's, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful game.

[47:54] Once people learn how to play it, they actually really enjoy it. The problem is I can't be there

[47:59] all the time to teach people how to actually play that game. Like I honestly think that game is,

[48:06] I think it's really cool man with the kind of gambling aspect of it. If it didn't have that,

[48:11] I would be very bored of it, but kind of the ability to, you know, risk your, your jackpots and

[48:17] try and grow those for the ultimate payout. That is something that I think makes that game very

[48:21] unique and makes it enjoyable for me. But you take that out and it's a, it's a pretty boring game.

[48:28] I don't think a lot of people know that you can bank those jackpots. You know, there's not really

[48:32] a clear indicator. So I think that's part of the problem with the game. Yeah, I think, I think the

[48:37] issue people are having with it is. So even if you do know that, I think if you're a diehard fan of

[48:43] the monsters though, I think people are just craving to get more of the show and the storylines from

[48:50] the show into the game. Because right, the object, because if you watch the show, there's all these

[48:55] episodes that are great that could lend themselves to objectives in the pinball machine. And yet it's

[49:01] all about, to your point, like the jackpots and figuring out the strategy to score. And I think

[49:07] that leaves some of the monster diehard fans being like, well, that's, that's not really like why

[49:12] I love the monsters. That's just maybe a pinball like approach. And so I think they might be losing

[49:18] people there. Yeah. Chris, do you think that has to do with when they're, I watched the making of

[49:24] video a while ago on that? And it seems like they were looking for funny dialogue and clips versus

[49:32] storylines when I think John Borg was. Yeah. So I mean, I've said it before in the show. I'll say it

[49:40] again. It was clear. You would have to really be a fan of the monsters and watch every episode and

[49:47] take notes. I mean, it seems like Lyman Sheet's laboriously watched all three seasons of Batman

[49:54] and then laid out the game. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna cough real quick and I'll edit this out.

[50:00] Always. I'm like, I'm a little sick. You get me. I was like,

[50:08] all right. So I think the reason why the monsters is, is clearly, I just, I've said it, like,

[50:13] I don't think Dwight is a big monster's fan. I don't think he sat down and I'm watched like

[50:19] every episode with the intent of bringing the show he loves to life. I think he's trying

[50:25] a different pinball strategy. And I do think I think they heard some of the criticism about

[50:29] complexity and pinball machines. And I think they wanted to make a game that was easier to approach

[50:35] like an Adam's family versus a pirate to the Caribbean from Jersey Jack. But sure, look, you know,

[50:42] it's hard to tell if people are loving it or hating it because there's a few vocal people on

[50:47] Pinside that won't stop saying how much they don't like the game. I don't even know if those people

[50:51] have the game or not. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to be a huge seller for Stern, do you?

[50:57] We're talking monsters. Yep. Yeah. I think once you get past that first round and kind of like you

[51:05] mentioned many times before with everything coming out, if they haven't made their money,

[51:09] then I think it's going to be slim pickings for sure for them for whatever else they have on

[51:13] the line with that theme. With everything coming out, Neil, on the horizon, what has you most excited

[51:18] as a pinball fanatic? Yeah, man, as an operator, toy story has me extremely excited if that does

[51:26] truly happen. I think that is an absolute slam dunk, man. From our location, I can just see that

[51:33] thing earning incredibly just with all of the younger generation that does go there. You're most

[51:39] excited about an unofficially rumored title. Yep. Okay. So what are you most excited about? That's

[51:46] officially announced. Hmm. I went and shot Wonka the other day and I kind of like you said,

[51:58] man, it shoots like a dream. I'm excited for it. If they do make some substantial code enhancements,

[52:04] I really wasn't even too sure what I was doing to be honest with you when I was playing the game.

[52:07] It didn't seem like there was a clear path. So you got to collect the bars I hear.

[52:15] Yeah. Keep collecting. There's tons of them. Now don't get me right. I didn't have a ton of time

[52:20] on. I played it for about 15 minutes, but you know, I feel like I should have had a good idea,

[52:24] but I do know that's really code. It kind of reminded me of when Guardians of the Galaxy was shipped

[52:28] at point. I think I got mine at like point. Yeah, I think it was less than point five. Maybe I'm

[52:33] wrong on that, but you know, it showed up. Basically it had one song in it. No call outs.

[52:38] It was pretty bare and I was like, what the hell did I buy here? But thank goodness, you know,

[52:41] they can they can make vast improvements with code updates now. What did you think of the sound

[52:47] and the art in Wonka? It didn't bug me. It did not bug me. I think if you put a Christopher

[52:56] Franci twist on it, it could be cool. You know, I'm not a huge fan of the clip art, but it really

[52:59] didn't bug me. I thought it was a pretty game. I think it was a C E that Jackson out to our local

[53:08] distributor to have at our local show this coming weekend. So it was a pretty game. Man,

[53:14] nothing really bugged me too much. Now looking at the, you know, the pro or not the pro, the standard

[53:19] edition, it's pretty bare and but it doesn't bug me too much because it is going to be side by side

[53:24] with another game. So not a huge deal for operating. I mean, it only loses that one Mac and

[53:29] now it's pretty bare. It does look bare and back there though, right? It's they, it's almost

[53:36] like they just need it like a sculpt back there. Like I get there, they're taking out the Wonka

[53:40] Vader, but they probably need to put something there, right? It does look empty. Sure.

[53:46] Yeah, even put a balloon. Just put a piece of a link. They should just put a big like billboard

[53:51] back there for Canadian Spinball podcasts. I think that would be. There you go. After all the hype I

[53:55] did. I think I deserve that kind of real estate in the game. That's right, man. Scrolling ads.

[54:00] Do you think I'm going to eat my own words on my hype of of Wonka?

[54:06] I hope not, man. It just really depends on what that code looks like when it's all said and done.

[54:10] But hey, it's a refundable deposit. Just remember, you can keep that back that Batman 66 that you love.

[54:16] Yeah, that's what I don't get about all these the early showing of the game and all and I hope

[54:21] they don't keep streaming this game to the cows come home because it's all the deposits are

[54:27] refundable. And the more time you give people with all these streams and if they don't see

[54:34] significant code improvement, you're just losing deposits. You're not going to gain deposits.

[54:40] And that's why I keep telling them don't show us the game until there's something in the code that

[54:45] makes us go like holy cow. Wow. And I just haven't seen that in the code yet.

[54:50] Yeah, no, absolutely agree, man. And I also think you're on to something with

[54:54] that you need to take care of the the top in buyers first. Like I think collectors additions and

[54:58] standards need to be going out hand in hand. You know, they need to take care of the people who

[55:03] are willing to spend thousands and thousands of dollars on a machine and they also need to

[55:06] make sure they're taking care of the operators and getting these games on locations ASAP because

[55:11] you know, most people are going to play a game on location for the first time. And if they love

[55:15] that game, then they're going to become a buyer. Well, I mean, Stern does it right. They have the pro

[55:20] and then the Ellie. It's the premium people who wait. Yep. I don't know why. I don't know why.

[55:28] It's just it's just I watch this, you know, Neil every every year. I'm like, you know what? This

[55:33] year, everyone else is going to figure it out because it's already been figured out and Stern has

[55:37] showed us how to do it. And yet, and yet Jack always finds new ways to try and do it differently.

[55:43] And I don't know. It's because like if they do wait and you make this the collectors addition

[55:48] people wait like six months after launch, you're not going to sell 500. People are going to half

[55:54] those people are going to just go in on an L.D. because they want the game. Sure. And save money.

[56:01] Same game. Yeah. Same game. And they can they can take it to pinball refinery and have them put

[56:06] some candy armor on it if they wanted a different color and they're having fun for months while

[56:11] the C.E. guys are just waiting. Yeah. And here's the other part. Here's the dangerous part because

[56:16] this is what Stern does so magically. They get people to buy the monsters at least. And they don't

[56:23] know what the full code is yet until the game is already in their home. Right? Yep. So that's

[56:30] genius. Yep. Right. They don't care. They got your money. They don't care. They don't care. It's not

[56:34] their first video man. They they totally understand it. And that's obviously why they're the most

[56:39] successful operating pinball company right now. By the time by the time the first collector's

[56:46] addition of Wanko is on the line by you know four or five months from now, those people are going

[56:52] to know exactly what like the whole complete code is. And if it doesn't have what they're looking for,

[56:58] you know, they're going to say, well, I'm going to wait for Guns of Rose is or to your point,

[57:01] Neil. I'm going to wait for Toy Story, which we know is coming out. I mean, it's it's all but

[57:06] finalized. I mean, Toy Story was supposed to come out this year, but they they're going back

[57:10] and revisiting the code because they didn't have the assets the way they wanted them to have them.

[57:15] So Chris, does that mean do anything for you by the way? Absolutely. Toy Story.

[57:19] I mean, yeah, I mean, look, if if I were to look at all the games on the horizon,

[57:25] Toy Story, I mean, I love the movies. When I hear people say like Toy Story is not a very

[57:29] popular franchise, it's like sometimes I just want to punch my computer screen. For people that

[57:35] think like monsters is more relevant than Toy Story, it's like it's like I don't even understand

[57:39] like how you can have that. It's there's actual factual data to support that Toy Story is a multi

[57:47] billion dollar franchise. Monsters is not not even close. Yes, I love the three Toy Story movies.

[57:55] I kind of don't know why they made a fourth one because the third one ended so perfectly.

[58:01] But I will money man money grab. I know, but it's like what happened at Pixar? It just like they

[58:07] used to know when to call it a day and let some of these IP sort of you know have their moment.

[58:14] But look, I also think that Disney is not going to mess up Toy Story 4. I mean, we love these

[58:19] characters. It's been a while since we've seen them on the big screen. But my whole thing is this,

[58:25] it's the same thing with Wonka. If they don't get the assets down right, like if I don't, I need to see

[58:31] the clips from the movie that I love and I need to hear the call outs from the scenes that I love in

[58:39] Toy Story or I'm not going to be happy. No, I absolutely agree. Just having a machine with your

[58:48] favorite figures or art on it isn't enough anymore with how interactive these screens are. It's

[58:55] it's almost disgraceful when you don't have interaction. That's kind of one of the cool things when

[59:02] you do go to the Black Knight sort of rage is Baron as the play field is. It's very interactive man

[59:09] with that back glass. I think the, not the back glass, but the LCD. I think that's super cool. I

[59:15] think you feel like you're a part of something. You feel like you're battling these things.

[59:20] Yeah, I do think you know, it's started. Yeah, no, go ahead. The most important part though,

[59:25] for me, even more than the visuals, which are nice and you should are the call outs though,

[59:30] because oh, absolutely. You're like Lord the Rings, Stern Pimball. I feel like I'm in those

[59:36] modes. You know, when you those modes are kicking in, you feel like you're in those scenes in the

[59:41] movie and look, there's no like it's DMD tech, right? Yeah, but like yeah, but somehow it does

[59:48] such a great job of pulling you in to the energy and the tension and the drama of those scenes.

[59:56] And it's all about the call outs and the light show going together. And then the screen is just

[01:00:02] icing on the cake. And I think that the same thing is true with with, you know, with the modern

[01:00:08] games. I think sometimes I don't want to sit there and watch like a movie, right? I want it to be

[01:00:14] more under the glass of like the mode coming to life with the call outs and the lights going and

[01:00:20] hopefully toys and mechanisms reflecting those those pivotal moments and characters. But we'll see,

[01:00:27] you know, I mean, it's early to tell. Any, Neil, are you in on any, are you a fan of Guns of Roses?

[01:00:32] Love the band, but it's ultimately going to come down to what's inside the game. You know, is it going to be

[01:00:39] partial song clips? You know, is it going to be full songs? What are we looking at? I can't tell you that

[01:00:44] quite yet, man. Music pins for us on location have not done very well. So it's going to really need to be a

[01:00:53] a cool package for me to consider another music pin. Right. What do you think is next from Stern?

[01:00:57] That's a great question, man. It seems like all of the most recent ones were kind of just shot down

[01:01:06] with all of franchise art that he released. So I'll give you like the titles that are rumored. We got

[01:01:11] Jurassic World. Yeah. The Godzilla. I'm still holding some faith that we get at Jaws, man. I think

[01:01:21] that'd be such a cool theme that could relate to everybody. I don't, you know, I know there's a lot of

[01:01:26] issues with licensing apparently, but I do think we're going to see a Jurassic World. And I do

[01:01:34] think we're going to see a Godzilla. It seems like those two rumors have the most kind of steam

[01:01:38] behind them right now. You know, if I were Stern, it'd be really easy for me to leak out into the

[01:01:44] community that licensing Jaws is a nightmare and you're never going to see it. And here are the

[01:01:48] reasons why. And that's an easy way to like deflect. You maybe you're working on it. Yeah.

[01:01:57] The other is the other titles are that I've heard are possibly Motley crew.

[01:02:03] Does nothing for me? Well, we know how viral is happening because they already

[01:02:08] announced it. Yeah, but again, does nothing for me. So that's on the same line of Black Knight, man.

[01:02:12] I just you're going to have to have such a specialty crowd. And that's truly going after the old,

[01:02:16] you know, the class, I don't want to say old, but just like the classic pinball players,

[01:02:19] it's something that's going to relate heavily to what they remember playing, growing up. It's not

[01:02:24] going to do anything for us on a location. Like, you know, I don't I know who Elvira is, but I can

[01:02:31] I really don't remember the show. I don't remember a ton of about her. I know she's a

[01:02:38] I'm going to keep it clean. Yeah. Well, look, I mean, to me, it's like Elvira is in the same kind of fan

[01:02:44] club as Munsters. You got the kind of champion horror sort of genre.

[01:02:50] You know, it's sort of like creature from the black lagoon. So deep route, the company that is

[01:02:58] going to make the most pinball machines ever in 2019, probably not going to happen. But what,

[01:03:04] not knowing much, do you think deep route could be a location player if they if they come out with

[01:03:12] working versions of John Papaduk's games or have something else that might be enticing?

[01:03:18] Yeah, man, it's going to again come down to theme and cost. You know, if they're putting out cool

[01:03:23] games that, you know, might not have a super attracted by pee then if the cost is right and it's a

[01:03:29] cool game and it's a loaded game, it's something I would definitely consider. We need we need some

[01:03:33] fresh stuff on the scene. You know, if pricing winds up being in the, you know, the American pinball

[01:03:41] realms and they're not cool themes that are going to draw people to them. I'm going to pass all day

[01:03:46] for at least for location for my home. I don't care. I'm not too concerned for my home about theme.

[01:03:51] I just love a deep game. Like I played October Fest the other day and honestly, I thought that

[01:03:55] game was super cool. I thought there was a ton of stuff to do. I was actually really impressed and

[01:04:01] I played that right after I played the Willy Wonka and, you know, at that moment, if I had to

[01:04:07] pick a game to walk out with, I would have picked the October Fest.

[01:04:12] So that's, it's interesting that within a brewery, and we talked about this earlier,

[01:04:17] that October Fest isn't in immediate buy. So do you think American pinball should offer a special

[01:04:25] sort of sculpt in the game? If you are buying it for a brewery, they will make you like a custom

[01:04:31] barrel with the brewery name on it. Like something to even personalize it a little bit more for.

[01:04:36] They kill it if they did a custom translate. If they put the translate, if you know, the brewery's

[01:04:41] logo, they'd, I think they'd sell a lot of games. Right, which wouldn't be too hard if you think

[01:04:47] about it. I mean, no, no. You just asked the brewery for their logo, which they'll already have

[01:04:53] like vectorized and ready to go. And then you print it out and put it in there. And there you go.

[01:04:59] You've got a one-of-one sort of special version for each brewery in America.

[01:05:04] Boom. I'd be reaching out to breweries all day. You know, that sounds like a special pricey

[01:05:07] for you guys. That sounds, wait, that sounds a lot like marketing, which doesn't happen at all in

[01:05:14] pinball. Let's just make a one-size-fits-all game and expect everyone to buy it.

[01:05:20] Yep. No, you're right, man. Look, October Fest is packed. I mean, if people are, they're starting

[01:05:25] to get into homes. People are starting to experience it. I still think the artwork is, is pretty

[01:05:32] god-awful. But if you can look past the artwork, that machine is jam-packed for $7,500.

[01:05:40] Absolutely. The animations are not great. They're not great. But, you know, there's a lot

[01:05:48] in the game. And that's all I'll say. Look, if that company can improve their animations and

[01:05:54] their artwork, which they should be able to do, I think they can have a successful

[01:06:02] game out there. But I don't think this one's going to take off even though a lot went into it.

[01:06:10] Yeah. To be honest, man, I wasn't as turned off by the animations. It kind of reminded me of

[01:06:16] like the rollercoaster Toycoon old PC game or a sim city kind of that overhead view you're

[01:06:21] walking around the park. It wasn't too bad to be honest with you, man. I felt like it fit the

[01:06:26] theme pretty decently. Walking up to the tin, playing the games. I was pretty okay with it.

[01:06:32] Yeah, I mean, look, they're whenever we watch, this is why pinball streams. I think sometimes get you

[01:06:40] get you looking at stuff that when you actually play a pinball game, you're not staring at that stuff,

[01:06:46] right? So correct. It's up there. It's not great. It isn't. But like when you're playing

[01:06:52] October Fest and you just need to glance up quickly to see what you need to do, it does the job

[01:06:59] of that. And it actually does it in a way that I kind of like because it's very simple. You know

[01:07:05] what's going on on the screen. There's not like a ton of stuff to figure out. That being said,

[01:07:10] yes, it could be more polished than it is. But man, pinball should still be 90% under the glass.

[01:07:18] Absolutely. Which takes me back to one of the greatest things I think ever happened was when

[01:07:22] highway pinball had the little monitor, you know, mirroring what was on the LCD between the flippers.

[01:07:29] I just don't get why no one else has done that. I thought that was awesome, man, because you can

[01:07:32] look up all the time and you do lose out on a lot of stuff when you have to look away. And you know,

[01:07:38] it's almost an auto drain if you do try and look up when the balls and play. So I thought that little

[01:07:42] monitor was for cool, embedded in the play field. Right. Yeah, I mean, people still hold up the

[01:07:48] Valley Williams games and the games from that era as being, you know, maybe the best pinball we've

[01:07:53] ever had on planet earth and DMD dots, not a ton on the screen. And the dots were used really

[01:08:02] creatively. But still like if you take away that as being the driving force of telling the story

[01:08:10] or pulling people through the experience, then you have to put the stuff on the play field.

[01:08:15] Which is why I still think I would rather take a jam packed play field of toys and fun stuff versus

[01:08:23] a highly stylized LCD screen experience, right? I mean, look at Black Knight. Yeah, the animations

[01:08:30] are great. Yeah, because none of the damn monsters you fight are on the play field. So I have to just

[01:08:35] keep... No, I absolutely agree. After playing that game, I would go I would gladly take a DMD for

[01:08:41] more on that play field. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, you don't feel like you're battling anything

[01:08:47] other than the Black Knight. And then even so, you don't even bash him. You hit a target in front of him.

[01:08:55] Yeah. Well, yeah, and yeah, I mean, you know, you said it's super disappointing just for not

[01:09:00] technically being a licensed theme. Chris, I got a question for you, man. Why are no

[01:09:06] manufacturers going after an Nintendo license? I know you're in marketing. Is that an expensive

[01:09:14] license to go after? The answer is yes. Nintendo IP is some of the most valuable IP on the planet.

[01:09:24] Yeah. These are multi-billion dollar IPs in terms of Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda. So they are

[01:09:36] super expensive. That being said, we've seen them before in Pimball, right? So they're not

[01:09:41] unobtainable. I am very surprised that we have not seen any Pimball machines tap into some of the

[01:09:52] hot video game properties. Now, I would only make a game in which the property itself lent itself

[01:10:00] to a nice transformation or interpretation by the Pimball medium. And I do think Super Mario

[01:10:06] Brothers would be incredible. Yeah. I mean, think about what the tech that we have nowadays,

[01:10:14] right? You get the ball goes into the green plumber pipe and goes down into the lower play field.

[01:10:19] Dun dun dun dun dun. You know, when you're in a lower play field, dun dun dun dun dun. I should just

[01:10:24] keep making that sound effect every every show regardless of what I'm talking about. But you know what

[01:10:28] I'm saying? Like, I think it would be incredible. And it's just it's expensive. But here's the part

[01:10:34] that kills me, Neil. Let's say to do that, it's going to cost ex hundreds of thousands of dollars.

[01:10:40] Okay. So if you have to make every machine cost $500 more, but you have the Super Mario Brothers

[01:10:47] franchise you're making the game on, do it. Do it. You know, and that's why these companies kill

[01:10:54] me because they always say like, well, it's not feasible for us to do that. And then they end up

[01:11:00] on these like mediocre themes and then they struggle to sell even a thousand. It's it's like

[01:11:07] stupid. Like you you you you you raise the price five hundred bucks and you have a theme that

[01:11:13] people want five thousand times more than like October fest. Well, I think you're going to get

[01:11:18] people who aren't necessarily only pinball, you know, people buying games like that. You know,

[01:11:24] if you throw a Zelda or Super Mario or a Pokemon out there, I think you're going to get those

[01:11:28] fanboys purchasing it regardless if they have a passion for pinball or not. So I don't know man.

[01:11:34] I think if a pinball company wanted to get rich real quick, they'd gobble up those IPs and

[01:11:40] sell them for ten thousand dollars a pop and I bet you could do it all day. Well, you you see it

[01:11:44] at the brewery and I think a family friendly brewery, I can't even enunciate anymore. I just

[01:11:51] get a I'm just going to close the showdown. It's it's a glad I still have like ten listeners. I'm

[01:11:57] not feeling a hundred percent people. So stay with me. But you see it at the brewery where families

[01:12:02] are coming in and it's very much like what might happen when they walk into a distributor and

[01:12:08] they're looking to buy a pinball machine. And if you want to find a theme that you know the

[01:12:13] parents who have the money appreciate but also the kids could get excited about. Nintendo Switch

[01:12:20] is still really popular. Those IPs are really popular. You know, I would I would definitely think

[01:12:26] that that is a much smarter move than your children looking at the monsters or Batman 66 or Beatles.

[01:12:34] I mean, Sterns had like four really questionable titles in a row. I have to imagine they need to hit

[01:12:41] and they need to hit next. You feel like they're too late. That's my concern with not only Jurassic

[01:12:48] world but with Toy Story as well. Are they going to admit? I mean, all the Jurassic World movies have

[01:12:54] come out to my knowledge, right? I don't think there's another one on the horizon. Right. I mean,

[01:12:58] Jurassic World, aka Jurassic Park, that whole universe. It has crossover appeal. The last

[01:13:07] Jurassic World movies were not as good. I would just make, this is just me, I would just make another

[01:13:13] a new Jurassic Park based on the first movie. That is the movie. That is still the franchise, right?

[01:13:21] The problem is the license holder probably wants them to make something with the new franchise

[01:13:27] on it. So you get into that. But yeah, I mean, it doesn't seem to make sense from a marketing

[01:13:34] standpoint to me because the second movie came out and kind of didn't do tremendously well.

[01:13:41] I don't know if there's a third one on the horizon anytime soon. So it seems like bad timing.

[01:13:47] And then I look at Toy Story, which is coming out next month and Jack has no game on the line.

[01:13:55] I think Toy Story was originally planned. This is like what I'm hearing. Toy Story was originally

[01:14:02] supposed to be out now for Jersey Jack. But they had the same licensing problems that they had with

[01:14:08] pirates. So they delayed it to get it right, hopefully. And that is why Wonka slid in front of Toy Story.

[01:14:18] Both of them are being worked on by Pat Lawler. So we'll see. Who knows?

[01:14:23] I think it's to be a re-themed dialed in. It's funny you say that because when I interviewed Jack,

[01:14:29] he said that's not out of the cards. And if you think about how can they get toys,

[01:14:37] how could it be so far along with also Wonka being far along? If you look at dialed in,

[01:14:44] and I'm picture the game in your head right now, how could that game re-skinned Toy Story?

[01:14:50] Who would be electric Bob? Who would be the electric guy going back and forth that you have to bash?

[01:14:56] Gotta be Buzz Light, you're right. But why would you bash Buzz moving back and forth?

[01:15:01] Yeah, I don't know, man. It might be one of the aliens from the crane game, but that doesn't make

[01:15:07] much sense. I mean, I don't think they're going to do it. I think that Jack's whole company is built

[01:15:14] on giving you the most full-featured game experience based on a theme people love. And

[01:15:20] debatable, right? Whether or not he's done that on all the different games he's put out there,

[01:15:24] but definitely he's put more in these games and any other manufacturer in the last like

[01:15:31] eight years since he's been in operation. American Pimball is catching up with features,

[01:15:37] but still has some ways to go with art. I'm just nervous. I get nervous whenever I think about

[01:15:44] J.J.P. Because I think they always come so damn close to just having that hit game.

[01:15:51] And I want it for them so bad because they're trying so much harder than I think Stern is to make

[01:15:56] that hit game. But I think Stern is smarter if that makes sense. Yeah, for sure. You know,

[01:16:02] time-tested man. They're smarter. They George and Gary, they just know what it takes.

[01:16:09] They know the target better. They know the realities of location play better. They know what the

[01:16:16] market will bear in terms of how much they can charge. They kind of know what the ceiling is.

[01:16:23] They experiment and test along the way. I mean, Beatles pricing was an experiment.

[01:16:29] So was Batman SLE. Everyone sold. You know, I think I was surprised I didn't do any SLE with

[01:16:37] Star Wars, but they can't even get the damn top or done. Yeah. But look at Stern, but Stern is a

[01:16:44] company where if I could break into George Gomez's office, I bet I bet the next three years of titles

[01:16:52] are all in works. Deals are signed. Development is happening. Sure. That's how many games, Neil?

[01:17:01] Let's just say an average four year, five, maybe 15 games in a three year span already in motion.

[01:17:13] I just hope they get back to what I think they do great. That's good themes.

[01:17:18] Well, up until the last couple, starting with the monsters.

[01:17:23] Because they're truly the ones who I think are going to help to keep pinball surviving. If they

[01:17:30] have to come out with these titles frequently, get them into location and getting people excited

[01:17:35] to play a man. Right. So let me, um, we're near the hour, but I got a few more questions. I give you

[01:17:43] the marketing power at Stern, pinball. What two themes would you love to see them make?

[01:17:50] What we talked about, I think Zelda would absolutely kill it. And I think a Super Mario would

[01:17:54] absolutely just kill it. All right. So tune in 10 now. Okay. Yeah. Yep. I hope somebody makes

[01:18:00] the matrix. What do you think? Again, man, I think the matrix is great, but I think it's going to miss

[01:18:07] the newer generation. You know, that came out when I was in middle school. And you know,

[01:18:14] I remember it, but it just, it really didn't have that stick to me. And I think it's probably,

[01:18:20] you were what in high school probably when that came out. Yes. Yeah. What when did it come out? Like 90,

[01:18:27] what? I think 97, 98. Okay. So I was a, I was in college. Okay. I think you're right. Look,

[01:18:39] I think yes, you're going to miss like the kids growing up. But I guess the question then is

[01:18:45] Stern is really never going to satisfy everybody. That's the problem, man. Ultimately.

[01:18:49] But here's, here's it's crazy. So like Avengers, you could say, well, Stern made Avengers like

[01:18:54] years ago, but Avengers is the hottest property right now, right? Endgame. Yes. We don't see

[01:19:01] pinball games anymore closely tied to the hottest relevant stuff happening right now. It's almost like

[01:19:09] they've made a decision that it's much cheaper to license games that aren't based on the current

[01:19:17] hot properties. Sure. Because think about like, well, the one, but that hasn't always been the case,

[01:19:23] right? Like they, they did Game of Thrones when Game of Thrones was the hottest show on TV.

[01:19:30] They probably weren't doing as well financially either at that point. Right. But around that period,

[01:19:37] I wouldn't really consider like Deadpool like a new hot property. That's, that's not really the case.

[01:19:42] But they haven't really done much else. That's like brand new. Like they did old Star Wars,

[01:19:49] not new Star Wars. Yeah. Trying to think Ghostbusters was old. I'm trying to think of the

[01:19:55] Stern Games Batman 66. Aerosmith. I mean, you know, it's not even like contemporary music acts.

[01:20:03] Yeah. So that is, it's going to be interesting because I don't, I don't know where they go. Elvira's old.

[01:20:16] We'll see. Godzilla. You know, but Godzilla, what do you think about that? Because are the kids

[01:20:22] into Godzilla these days? You know, man, anytime a movie like that comes out, I think they can get

[01:20:27] them into that real quick. It seems like every time a Godzilla movie came out throughout my lifetime,

[01:20:31] it was, you know, it was kind of a hot commodity at that point. Action figures galore. That's

[01:20:35] what all the kids wanted. So I think that's kind of one of those generational things that they can

[01:20:39] just do over and over and over again. But again, there was a Godzilla also. So what was that?

[01:20:44] Sega, Sega showcase. Yeah. Did it go to yeah, so I'm just going to say yeah, I'm probably wrong.

[01:20:50] And then people are like, you don't know anything about pinball. You're shows terrible.

[01:20:56] I had some guy like email, you know, I'm Reddit and was complaining about the show as always.

[01:21:01] He claimed to listen to every show. He says all these mean things about me. It's like,

[01:21:05] and the music mixes are stupid. Like wow, they can't people can't even enjoy music anymore on some

[01:21:12] of these, these, you know, pinside guys. So Neil, we're at the hour. Let's let the listeners know when

[01:21:20] should they just start playing around with pin quests? Like what's what do you recommend they do

[01:21:24] because you've probably got around 2000 plus captive audience listening to the show? What's

[01:21:31] what's the best way for them to engage with pin quest? Yeah, great question. Man, first of all,

[01:21:36] it's it's going to take the community to help this thing thrive. I want everyone to know most

[01:21:40] importantly that this is truly a passion thing. I it's by no means something I'm trying to make

[01:21:46] ton of money off of is just trying to help the hobby grow get more places playing are more people

[01:21:51] playing more places to have location pinball. So that being said, hop on our website. So it's

[01:21:57] www.playpinquest.com. I don't have an active link to the actual app page yet. That'll be launched

[01:22:05] this weekend. You will be able to get in there and play around again. Nothing's going to show up in

[01:22:09] your location. If I don't have any locations on board yet. So that's kind of my next, my next

[01:22:14] task. So if you are a location or if you want your location to get on board on my website, there is

[01:22:21] a contact us form. We are collecting information for all the locations that have expressed interest.

[01:22:27] And when we're ready to launch, we'll get everyone set up again with those free trials. Make

[01:22:31] sure it's a good fit. And then we'll go from there. Awesome. Well, Neil, I really appreciate

[01:22:36] you coming on the show. I extra appreciate you sort of building this thing and giving

[01:22:43] all of us people out there who love pinball a new way to experience the thing we love. And I'm

[01:22:48] looking forward to it because I think New York City will be a great place to experience pinquest

[01:22:53] because we have a lot of location play here. And if I can get a free beer or something else just

[01:23:00] by playing pinball, I think it's a good thing because beer is damn expensive in New York City. So

[01:23:07] at other places to hang out. I'm on the location on board already. Yeah. What do you have?

[01:23:13] Can't say yet. Okay. Well, I could guess. Well, Neil is a pleasure and just fun chatting about

[01:23:18] the hobby. We'll get you back on the show in the near future as pinquest takes off and always

[01:23:25] glad to have a new guest on Canadian Spinball podcast. Just chatting about the hobby. It's what we

[01:23:29] love to do. So thank you so much for taking the time. Absolutely, man. I truly appreciate it.

[01:23:34] Keep up the good work. All right. Thank you, Neil.

[01:24:04] You
