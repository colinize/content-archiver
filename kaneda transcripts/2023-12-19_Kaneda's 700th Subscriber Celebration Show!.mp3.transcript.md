[00:00] This is the mood today over at the Twippy Headquarters, Collin and Will embracing each other.

[00:30] I've changed my face, I've changed my name, but no one wants you when you lose.

[00:41] Don't give up, cause you have friends.

[00:47] Alright, now the mood over at Canadian is when we just passed 700!

[00:50] I get no down, but I get up again, cause I have a lonely deepening town.

[00:55] I get no down, but I get up again, cause I have a lonely deepening town.

[01:00] I get no down, but I get up again, cause I have a lonely deepening town.

[01:04] I get no down, but I get up again, cause I have a lonely deepening town.

[01:08] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[01:12] Aw, where's everybody now?

[01:14] Where's everybody now with all of their slings and arrows and their outrageous fortunes everybody?

[01:19] We just surpassed 700 subscribers to Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[01:23] What a crazy milestone, what a crazy year after all of these years of being in this

[01:29] pinball hobby and going at these manufacturers praising them when they do good deeds and

[01:34] calling them out when they give us broken playfields.

[01:38] Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to do this very quick show to say we did it.

[01:42] We did it after all of these years and thanks to all of you, each and every one of you contributed

[01:47] it to this milestone moment that I am now feeling and this is the greatest holiday gift of all

[01:53] time and it shows, it shows that we will not stand for this ridiculousness where we want to sort of

[01:59] eliminate people's ability to be recognized in pinball.

[02:03] I want to give a shout out to all of the content creators that are out there.

[02:06] I want to give a shout out to all the mod makers, all the locations, everybody out there

[02:10] who is into pinball and doing it their way on their terms.

[02:14] You know, the majority of people in this hobby are super cool.

[02:18] They're not afraid of Canadian Spinball Podcasts.

[02:20] They're not afraid to speak their mind about companies that are charging as $5,000 to $15,000

[02:26] on unnecessary toys, putting less magic in these games than ever before and jacking the price up 40%.

[02:32] What are we all, investors in stern pinball or something?

[02:35] What are we all, relatives of David Fix?

[02:37] No, we're grown men, ladies and gentlemen and grown men can't handle the heat.

[02:42] Yeah, you can ban me from pin side.

[02:44] Sure, you can ban me from Dodge Hellcat forums because I make fun of people who don't drive their cars.

[02:49] You can ban me from the Neo Geo forums because those people are just crazy.

[02:54] And here we are after all these years.

[02:56] When you look at the numbers, nobody else has even come close to this.

[03:00] We have more subscribers than every single show combined.

[03:03] But it's not about that.

[03:04] It's not about numbers.

[03:06] It's not about Patreon.

[03:07] It's not about trippy awards.

[03:09] It's about staying the course and not bending to the will of the weak.

[03:14] And that is what they tried to do.

[03:16] They handed over the award show that we all love to weak-minded people who didn't even love the show.

[03:23] And this is what we get in life.

[03:25] Yeah, you could go cancel Thanksgiving and then replace it with nothing.

[03:29] That's the outcome these gentlemen want.

[03:32] And they once again have lost.

[03:33] And Karma is a B-I-T-C-H.

[03:36] On the very day they opened up voting, we crossed the finish line of 700 subscribers.

[03:43] And they don't want to do it.

[03:44] They don't want to take their shows behind the paywall because they don't want to see what's going to happen, people.

[03:49] We took it all behind the paywall.

[03:51] 20-minute shows, you get everything you need to know about Pimball in just 20 minutes or less.

[03:57] All you got to do is read Napsarcade, follow Kari Hardy, and listen to Kanata's Pimball podcast.

[04:03] I don't got to interview everybody in the industry because everybody else will do that for me.

[04:07] What you're going to get here are the news rumors and speculations about these companies that nobody else will give you.

[04:14] I don't care about burning bridges to the manufacturers.

[04:17] I care about delivering the most entertaining, most informative, and most straight to the point

[04:23] Pimball podcast on the planet.

[04:25] And this number validates that.

[04:28] So thank you everybody so much.

[04:30] I look forward to doing another 900 podcasts about Pimball.

[04:34] I'll be an old man wheeled into the room, right?

[04:37] A Texas Pimball festival like 30 years from now.

[04:40] I remember back in the day when collectors editions were just $15,000.

[04:45] I mean, shush, they're going to be like $150,000 by the time I stopped doing this show.

[04:51] But I just want to say this.

[04:52] Your support means everything because you saw what happened over the last month and a half.

[04:57] These people didn't just come at me.

[04:58] They came at you.

[05:00] How dare you join that show?

[05:02] Anyone who supports him is an evil person who's supporting toxic, bullying behavior.

[05:07] Nobody's lost their job.

[05:08] Nobody's lost anything but their pride, ladies and gentlemen.

[05:12] But the pride is all on this side of the fence because we're having the most fun.

[05:15] And we're dancing into the holiday season while everybody else is still making content,

[05:20] moping about me, moping about the award shows.

[05:23] The award shows are done and great.

[05:25] You just killed everything we enjoyed.

[05:27] So now we can all just go back to making fun of Galactic Tank Force, everybody.

[05:31] I just want to say this.

[05:32] On my last show, I know I left off barrels of fun as one of the 10 most surprising moments

[05:39] in pinball.

[05:40] And yes, the most surprising moment wasn't the fact that they made Labyrinth because I

[05:44] knew that was happening.

[05:45] It wasn't the fact that they had games ready to go on launch day because I knew that was

[05:49] going to happen.

[05:50] The most surprising thing was they named the damn company Barrels of Freakin' Fun.

[05:55] That might have been the most surprising move in the history of pinball that you would put

[05:59] in all of this hard work and name a company that.

[06:02] I think we all got over it.

[06:03] I love the guys over there.

[06:05] I think they're doing it right.

[06:06] It kills me that they're not making Fifth Element.

[06:08] Just make me something.

[06:09] Make me a Kira.

[06:10] Make me Bloodsport.

[06:11] Make me Big Trouble and Little China.

[06:13] I don't want another game with Muppets in it, people.

[06:16] I don't want Muppets.

[06:17] I'm a 47-year-old man.

[06:18] Can we stop with this nonsense of Muppets and Looney Tunes and all of these kiddie themes?

[06:23] We're 40 to 50 to 60-year-old men.

[06:25] We have to work really hard to afford these damn pinball machines.

[06:28] Can somebody put a freaking game in a box that I want to buy?

[06:31] Can someone put a game in a box in 2024 that's take my money now?

[06:34] That's actually a theme we really want?

[06:36] We're going to give you the best of 2023, but here's the spoiler alert, people.

[06:40] The best of 2023 wasn't even close to being the best of what we know pinball is capable

[06:45] of.

[06:46] And that's why you're here.

[06:47] Because as much as I love Foo Fighters, I love Jack Danger, but this isn't the best.

[06:51] This isn't the best we got.

[06:53] These aren't the best themes because if they were, we wouldn't see these machines, right?

[06:58] 13,000 for a Foo Fighter LE.

[07:01] Now it's all the way down to around $9,000.

[07:04] People were losing $3,000 to $4,000 in one year.

[07:07] Did anyone lose $3,000 to $4,000 on Ghostbusters LE?

[07:11] On Batman LE?

[07:12] On Jurassic Park LE?

[07:14] Every single LE that came out over the last five to six years.

[07:17] Did anyone lose $3,000 to $4,000 on those games?

[07:20] The answer is nope.

[07:22] So it's a brave new world.

[07:24] I'm going to create a brave new podcast and it's going to be an amazing holiday.

[07:28] People, thank you so much.

[07:29] This is just a short thank you show.

[07:31] I'm not even going to number this a podcast, but I just want to say this.

[07:35] Because of you and your support and your family members putting up with listening to me through

[07:40] the car speakers, we're at a place where no one else has even come close.

[07:45] And let me give a huge shout out to the individuals that got us there this week.

[07:50] And it wasn't Bill Brandis and it wasn't Neil McCrae, John Clark, thank you, Ben, thank

[07:54] you, David O'Donovan, my brother-in-law, Rebecca O'Donovan, my sister-in-law.

[07:59] We got Larry Dockner, Frightener joined the freaking show to push us over the edge.

[08:03] Arcade Hunters, Andrew Reimer, Julia, Screech2, whatever that says, Josh Hardy, Cedric, T-Bone,

[08:11] SpaceJunk420, Gilligan, Daniel, Evan B, Jeff Gordon, GMG996.

[08:18] I love the fact that I can call my mama today and say, mama, I reached over 700 because

[08:25] of SpaceJunk420.

[08:28] That's it, baby.

[08:29] Either you're hanging out with Steve Jablonsky and SpaceJunk420 or you're hanging out with

[08:34] nobody in the pinball world.

[08:36] Let's go party.

[08:37] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:39] You're never gonna keep me down.

[08:41] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:43] You're never gonna keep me down.

[08:45] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:47] You're never gonna keep me down.

[08:49] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:51] You're never gonna keep me down.

[08:53] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:55] You're never gonna keep me down.

[08:57] I get no town, but I still get.

[08:59] You're never gonna keep me down, but I still get.

[09:01] But I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:04] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:09] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:13] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:18] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:22] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:27] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:33] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:36] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:41] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now

[09:45] I can't go down, I still can't get out of the world with you now
