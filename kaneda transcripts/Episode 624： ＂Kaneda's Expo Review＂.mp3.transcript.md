[00:00] You know I'm a dreamer, but my heart's a door.

[00:07] I had a runaway hide, so I wouldn't come home.

[00:17] All we are back in New York City,

[00:19] Canada was at Pinball Expo 2021, and I must say,

[00:24] I don't think I've felt this good about this hobby and this

[00:28] community in a very, very long time.

[00:32] And I am so positive and pumped about Pinball and being a part

[00:37] of this community, and I'm going to be completely honest,

[00:40] I was feeling sort of bummed out about Pinball.

[00:42] I was getting fatigued, I was getting irritated by a lot of things,

[00:46] the price inflations, people going after me with fake pages on Facebook,

[00:52] all of this stuff was starting to weigh me down, and then I went to

[00:56] Chicago, and I got reminded about the most important part of this hobby,

[01:01] the most important thing in this hobby.

[01:04] It's not the Pinball machines, it's not the sparkly purple armor on

[01:09] El Vira, it's not the Toys in Godzilla, it's not the light show in

[01:14] guns and roses.

[01:15] The entire reason this hobby is fun, the reason we love it,

[01:21] the most valuable thing in Pinball is actually free, it's the people,

[01:27] and it's been almost two years, it probably has been two years,

[01:31] since all of us have been at a Pinball show together, and just geeked out

[01:37] over the thing we love, which is Pinball.

[01:40] So being at Pinball Expo this past Thursday and Friday was one of

[01:45] the greatest 48 hours I've had in Pinball, and we're going to talk about

[01:50] the show, we're going to talk about some of the things I saw, but I first

[01:53] want to start out by saying for each and every one of you that I hung out

[01:58] with at Expo, I truly, truly do mean it, you made it so very special for me,

[02:04] and you've really re-energized this show, and you've also given me a different

[02:09] perspective on where I want to take this show moving forward.

[02:14] And not only did I have amazing conversations with so many of my fans, and I

[02:18] can't even begin to name all of your names, and you know who you are, I do have to

[02:22] give a crazy call out to Hector, man, you are absolutely insane, and I love you,

[02:28] and thank you so much for the Steak Dinner at Morton's Brother, I really do

[02:32] appreciate it, and just hanging out with so many of you was so great, it was so

[02:37] great catching up with my friends over at the Loser Kid Pinball podcast, it was

[02:41] so great talking to the twins and talking to Todd Tucky, and even Jack Gwonari and

[02:46] me had a moment that I will never forget, and that was at 1130 Friday night on a

[02:52] piano playing November rain for Jersey Jack. You know I have my differences with

[02:58] Jersey Jack Pinball, I do, and Eric Manier walked right past me and snubbed me

[03:02] right when I got to the show, and apparently he's upset with me, a lot of people

[03:05] told me that, I'm sorry Eric, I would have apologized for upsetting you, I don't

[03:09] know if the actual reason is Eric is mad at me, but you could probably pick from

[03:13] 10 different things, but I've always been a fan of this game Guns and Roses, and I

[03:18] know there have been quality issues, but at the show itself, it really was a time

[03:23] to just get together and celebrate Pinball, and without Jersey Jack we wouldn't have

[03:27] guns and roses, you know sometimes you can look at some of the issues in a

[03:31] vacuum, and you can start to forget, is it better to live in a world in which you

[03:36] have a Pinball machine, even if it has a few issues, and at least have that

[03:40] machine, or live in a world in which there is no Jersey Jack Pinball, if I had to

[03:45] choose between those two things, I would choose to be in a world where Jersey Jack Pinball

[03:50] throws its hat in the ring, and shows us what they can do in the Pinball world,

[03:54] and there were so many Pinball royalty floating around the show, it was awesome to

[04:00] see. Now, what did I think of Pinball Expo as a show itself? Well first and foremost

[04:05] I want to thank David Fix and Rob Burke for putting the show together, they were

[04:09] at the show, I was able to say hi to them, what did I think of the show itself? Well the first

[04:14] thing is this, I know for a lot of us out there, a lot of us out there, you wanted to go,

[04:19] but you couldn't, and I want to say that when you get a chance to travel again, and

[04:25] when you have the means to do so, I would get to the next show you can, maybe it's

[04:29] fantastic up in Boston which is in just a couple of weeks, maybe it's T-P-F, but this

[04:35] really is where the magic is, I can't even emphasize this enough, Pinball hanging out

[04:40] with these geeks, it doesn't require you to buy a $25,000 L-Vira, it doesn't matter if

[04:46] you have an L-E or not, in fact before I go into the show itself I want to say that I

[04:50] barely played Pinball at Pinball Expo, because the people are the valuable thing, the people

[04:56] are the interesting thing, and why would I waste my time, I mean this, it's almost like

[05:01] why would I waste my time playing a Pinball machine for 10 minutes or 20 minutes when I

[05:08] can talk to these people for 20 minutes or a half hour who I never get to see, maybe I see

[05:15] them in real life once a year, and so that is where I applied the majority of my effort,

[05:21] I'm also a horrible Pinball player, but if you saw me on Cactus Canyon remake, I didn't

[05:27] drain that quickly, so if anyone was filming Canada, he actually can play Pinball somewhat

[05:33] decently, right now all the tournament players are rolling their eyes, being like this kid

[05:38] is garbage and you guys are right, so here is the thing with Pinball Expo, and this always

[05:43] happens, and this happened to me and it happened to a lot of the people who went there, if you

[05:47] are going to the show, the first few days are kind of like a wash out, and what I mean by a

[05:53] wash out, not that it's raining on the show itself, but you're waiting around all day long

[06:00] for something to open for there to be something to do, so for those of you who flew in on Wednesday,

[06:06] there was barely anything to do, you have the Stern virtual tour which Jack Danger did a good job on,

[06:12] and then you just waited, you just waited for something to happen because there wasn't anything

[06:17] opening on Wednesday, so then you get to Thursday and the vendor hall does not open up, I

[06:23] think the entire show did not open up on Thursday until 6 p.m, so the entire day is like you're

[06:32] just sitting around waiting, and then the next day the vendor hall doesn't open up until

[06:37] 4 p.m. that was Friday, so there is a lot of sitting around and waiting, and if I could give

[06:43] some advice to the pinball expo people, you've got a lot of people traveling into these shows,

[06:49] you need to open up those areas earlier, or if I'm you, I wouldn't travel in until like Friday

[06:55] Saturday, I mean those really are the better two days to be there to begin with, and the reason

[07:00] why I came home early was I wanted to surprise Brenda because Saturday nights are my favorite

[07:06] night of the week, we drink a bottle or two of sake, and we get the most amazing spicy noodles

[07:13] with some vegetable chili oil dumplings from this amazing place, and I don't want to miss it.

[07:18] So I'm here, I'm in New York, and so I was at expo, and we're going to talk about my favorite

[07:23] highs and lows of expo, so I was telling you about the delay in opening up, and that is a real thing.

[07:28] The other thing people will complain about and did complain about were the games in the

[07:33] free play area, and a lot of these games were brought by Rob Burke, and people did observe

[07:38] that these games were not in the best condition, and some of them weren't even turned on, this

[07:43] is always an issue with the free play area, but I will say the games in the free play area

[07:48] were not the best, and that's the area that stays open to like two in the morning, because

[07:53] all the good games, like the really new good games everybody wanted to play were in the vendor

[07:59] area, stuff like Godzilla, Guns and Roses, Legends of Vahala, Cactus Canyon, everything

[08:06] was over there, so that is another big issue is there weren't any of those newer games

[08:12] out in the free play area, so I do think they have to figure out a way to make it so it's not

[08:18] like all in in the vendor area, and that's the only place you really want to be, and everything

[08:23] else just feels like it's for more casual people walking in off the streets.

[08:27] But as I said, I didn't really care, like when I see people complain about this, I'm like,

[08:32] are you here because you really want to play these old pinball machines, or are you here

[08:37] to drink booze and hang out with your friends and have meals and stay out to three in the morning

[08:42] because the wife and the kids are not with you, and I think that's the reason why most

[08:46] of these guys go to these shows, and so just be prepared for that delay, and I will say

[08:52] it is a long wait, and people start to get a little antsy, and I did talk to a lot of people

[08:58] that on Thursday were like, I might think about booking my flight home early, and you just

[09:03] don't want to get that vibe. You want people to feel like there's stuff to do and stuff

[09:06] to check out. Now the hotel was beautiful, the Renaissance hotel was beautiful, only problem was,

[09:12] there really wasn't anything in walking distance of this hotel, so we didn't have like

[09:16] a bar or two in the parking lot, like a twin peaks or a peri-stake house, there wasn't

[09:21] anywhere to go to, and that's also I think a little bit of the downside of this. Now the

[09:26] plus side of it is this hotel is huge, and there are so many good common areas where everyone

[09:33] could congregate. It was fun seeing so many fans of Canadian pinball podcasts come up to

[09:37] me and have a conversation. I want to give you a funny story, so I'm sitting by myself

[09:41] because every like hour or two I just needed to like decompress and just unwind, and of course

[09:47] when I'm sitting by myself, who walks up to me? Who starts walking towards me? It's like the

[09:53] crew at Jersey Jack Pinball, it's Jack Winari and Steve Richie, and Jack walks up to me and he says,

[09:58] look at you, canada, you're sitting with all your friends, and you know, it's like I like

[10:03] Jack's sarcasm, it was actually a good joke, and he sat down with me and we took a photo,

[10:08] and then later that night I played for him Guns n' Roses in November rain, but I'm going to make

[10:13] this photo the image for this podcast, and so there weren't a ton of reveals that

[10:18] this show, and I'm not going to lie, I didn't go to all the seminars, I didn't hear everybody

[10:22] talk, I didn't go to most of the seminars, I really just wanted to pop into a few of them, I didn't

[10:27] even get to see all the ones I wanted to, but the main one I wanted to see because I heard

[10:32] a few hours before that Chicago gaming company was finally going to reveal cactus canyon

[10:39] you know how I feel about presentations at pinball shows, you know how as a marketer,

[10:45] it pains me when I see companies completely fumbled these kinds of moments because you've

[10:51] been working on this game for like a couple years, and this is your moment to reveal

[10:56] it to the world for the first time, remember no one's ever seen this game before,

[11:00] so this was the equivalent of the Guns n' Roses video that Jersey Jack Pinball put out

[11:05] into the world to get everybody excited about G&R, now I'm going to tell this story

[11:10] backwards, the end of this story is this, they sold out of all cactus canyon remakes at

[11:17] 1250 units at 9,200 dollars, I think it's 9,250 dollars, every single game is spoken for,

[11:27] so good on them, because you know and I know that this was the worst kept secret in pinball,

[11:34] and so dealers have had lists for this game for a very long time, so the moment they hit

[11:39] go and I was talking to JJ at the game exchange, he didn't even know the price, like he's

[11:43] sitting right behind me as they wheel the game in, I'm like JJ how much is he's like I don't know,

[11:48] how many are you getting, I don't know, and that's just the way it was, it was like in real time,

[11:52] it was like Ryan White was reading off of his phone what the price of the game was because

[11:57] he got an email saying what it was like that evening or the evening before, and so everything was

[12:02] happening quickly, the other part was this is like they wheeled it in, butch peel, I love

[12:06] you brother, butch peel wheels the game in with the staff at CGC, and it's not even covered,

[12:11] so let's just talk about that too, it's like look we know its cactus canyon, but still just

[12:15] cover it up, like they wheeled the machine in, and there I am filming, and all these other

[12:20] people start running up filming it, taking photos, and Ryan was having technical difficulties

[12:25] getting his computer hooked up to their AV, and it was just like this like oh no, but again,

[12:30] it doesn't matter, was it one of the worst reveals ever, probably, but again they sold

[12:37] every single game, now I still don't understand why these companies when they know they have

[12:43] this moment, why they don't just call Canada up and say hey look, we would like to give you

[12:48] a chance to help us sort of with our presentation, there was also a really good video

[12:54] that Zach many put together for straight down the middle on this game, so I highly recommend

[13:00] checking that out, I'm also going to talk a little bit at the end of this podcast about a

[13:03] conversation I had with Zach because I do think it's important for me to talk about this

[13:07] on the show, I think you guys are going to be happy to hear how our conversation went,

[13:11] but I'm going to end this show with that, but straight down the middle has a good video

[13:15] on this game, it was probably one of the worst rollouts of the game I've ever seen, and then

[13:20] they had four of the games on the floor, and people were playing them all night, now let me give

[13:24] you my thoughts on cactus canyon, here are my thoughts on cactus canyon, so I played the

[13:28] game, this is one of the games that I did play because I couldn't give you my first impressions

[13:32] without playing it, my thoughts are this, it plays like cactus canyon, right, no big

[13:38] surprise there because it is cactus canyon, the game does look beautiful, it does look beautiful,

[13:44] they did a great job with the topper, they did a great job with the sculpts on the apron,

[13:50] the game does look great, the game is packed with toys, I will say though, there's something

[13:56] about cactus canyon when you play it, it's just not as an exciting game, as monster bash,

[14:03] or medieval madness, or attack from Mars, and if you look at the way this game has been ranked

[14:08] over the years, I think that falls in line with how we've felt about this game for almost

[14:13] 25-30 years, so you are getting a great new version of cactus canyon, but they did not

[14:20] make the cactus canyon game that much better, we still don't have the lime and sheets

[14:25] code in this game, that is going to come at a later date and it will come with a price

[14:30] tag associated with it, and that's okay, like I don't have a problem with that, I don't think

[14:35] we can review yet what the ultimate expression of cactus canyon is from Chicago Gaming Company,

[14:40] and lime and sheets has been working on it for a while, so we'll see when that code happens,

[14:44] but the best part of this game is the price, at this price point, I think if you get this game

[14:51] you're going to be very satisfied, I was fully expecting this game to be more than $10,000,

[14:56] in fact I will say right now, I think they left a lot of money on the table, I think they could

[15:02] have charged around $11,000 for this machine and they would have got it for every single one,

[15:07] so then you do the math, like let's say they charged $2,000 more for every single game

[15:12] times $1,250 games, that's a lot more money in the pocket of Chicago Gaming Company,

[15:18] but who am I to complain that they're actually pushing prices in the right direction

[15:23] because the rest of the games that came out recently are all very expensive,

[15:28] and if you put cactus canyon remake next to Ultraman and Halloween,

[15:33] I mean you're getting a lot more in cactus canyon, and the SE version of cactus canyon is $8,000,

[15:39] so if you put the SE version of cactus canyon, which there's a lot in that game,

[15:44] there's a lot more in that standard edition of cactus canyon than is in Legends of Vahala,

[15:49] so it is a great bang for the buck, here's the one thing though, when they revealed the game

[15:54] and I saw the game for the first time, here's the one major thing I wish they had done

[15:59] with cactus canyon remake, when I look at the game it just looks a little dull from the cabinet standpoint,

[16:05] it looks a little flat, I really wish they would have made those decals pop more,

[16:10] you know like a glossy rad cow would look amazing, like something that's embossed,

[16:15] has a little bit of definition to it, but it's all so flat and none of it is shiny,

[16:20] and even the armor is like a dollar sort of dark gray, like a gun metal gray,

[16:25] and I understand maybe they're going for that Western like rustic look,

[16:28] but I would have made it pop more, they're just something about it, it just looks a little dull,

[16:34] especially next to stuff like Godzilla and Guns and Roses, these hyper colorful pins,

[16:40] and then you see it, it doesn't sort of wow you when you see it from a distance,

[16:45] but I'm glad they sold everyone, I also want to report to all of you out there,

[16:48] because you know that I had some back and forth with Ryan White leading up to this game's launch a few weeks ago,

[16:55] and Ryan and I sat down for at least an hour, and had an incredible conversation,

[17:00] and I want to say Ryan it was so great talking to you, and again this is why I love these shows in real life,

[17:05] because even though you might have some issues and you go back and forth with people,

[17:09] you get so much further when you connect in real life, and just talk about it,

[17:13] and we just talked about it, and I told them hey Ryan next time, just call me,

[17:17] and if I upset you because I said something on my show, just let me know,

[17:21] so Ryan it was really great talking to you, hearing about your past, hearing where you come from,

[17:25] and hearing your vision for Chicago gaming company, so I want to thank you Ryan for doing that,

[17:29] I appreciate it. Alright so cactus Canyon the big one, now the next game that was the new game was Legends of Vahala,

[17:36] and I've played Legends of Vahala, and I will say the American pinball setup in the vendor area was really nice,

[17:43] they had I think 6 Legends of Vahala, I think they had 6 hot wheels, and 4 Houdini's all setup at their sort of display area,

[17:52] and I will say there were people on Legends of Vahala all night long,

[17:56] every time the vendor hall was open there were people playing the game,

[17:59] and I got the same feedback about Legends of Vahala that I've given people.

[18:04] Everyone seems to say the game is fun to shoot, it's an okay game, right?

[18:09] It's an okay game, it's not gonna blow you away, and remember this game is in the same room as Godzilla,

[18:16] it's in the same room as cactus Canyon, it's in the same room as alvira,

[18:20] it's in the same room as Jurassic Park, it's in the same room as Deadpool,

[18:23] it's in the same room as Guns and F and Roses, and this is it, right?

[18:27] I've said this, like when you play these games in a vacuum, it's one thing,

[18:32] but when you play these games next to everything else in the marketplace,

[18:36] that's where it gets really hard to say, out of all these games,

[18:40] the game I'm going to buy is Legends of Vahala, now they sold through these games.

[18:46] I do think these games are still gonna sit at distributors,

[18:50] especially after all of this stuff has been coming out recently.

[18:54] It's gonna sit at distributors and they're gonna be available to buy for a while.

[18:59] It's just gonna be the case, there's just too many games out there,

[19:02] the amount of people I spoke to that are in on Godzilla Premium,

[19:06] the amount of people I talk to that have Guns and Roses orders coming in or just opened up a GNR.

[19:11] There's all those people that bought Halloween's and all those people that bought Ultra-Mans,

[19:15] there's just a lot of purchasing going on in a very short window,

[19:19] and I think distributors though are dying for product, right?

[19:23] Distributors are starving for new inbox games right now, they can't get inventory.

[19:29] So I am not surprised when American Pimball said, hey, we will make 500 games,

[19:34] new inbox, who wants them?

[19:36] Every single distributor that carries American Pimball,

[19:39] raised their hands and said, give me as many as I can get, because they need product.

[19:43] A distributor can't make money if they don't have games to sell you,

[19:46] but I still think this game is gonna go down as more of a middle of the road game,

[19:51] and that's not me slamming the game, it's just not at the same caliber as the other games that are out there right now,

[19:58] and it's not cheap, that's the other part, for $8,400 bucks,

[20:03] Vahala is just not cheap, so you really should jump on it,

[20:07] and you really have to play it to make sure that you really want it in your game room.

[20:12] Now, I want to talk about four other games.

[20:15] The first game I want to talk about is El Vira, the 40th Anniversary Edition.

[20:20] There was one on the floor, and I will say this game does look beautiful.

[20:25] Does it look $20,000 beautiful?

[20:28] No, does it look $25,000 beautiful?

[20:31] Absolutely not.

[20:32] Does it look $30,000 beautiful if you spend $30,000 on this game?

[20:38] I do think you need your head examined, and I was talking to my friend Dan.

[20:43] Dan, I'm gonna call you out right now, Dan's an amazing guy.

[20:46] Dan bought one of these, and I think he bought it really, really well.

[20:51] He bought one for $18,000 new in box, so I just want you guys to hear that,

[20:57] who paid $30,000, that some dude just bought this for $18,000.

[21:02] Now, he might have bought it at the lowest price imaginable,

[21:05] but here's how it went down.

[21:07] I think distributors were sold this game for $15,000, and they were told

[21:12] you can price it at whatever you want.

[21:15] And that's why you're seeing distributors starting it at like $30,000, why not?

[21:20] Put it up there, see if it sells.

[21:22] See if someone bites.

[21:23] If they don't, take a couple thousand dollars off.

[21:26] If they don't bite on that, take another thousand dollars off until you sell it.

[21:30] But they're gonna sell all of these because the games are gorgeous.

[21:34] I just don't think they're worth anywhere near 20 to $25,000,

[21:38] but Stern has figured out that all you need are a hundred and ninety-nine really wealthy men who don't really care.

[21:46] That's it, they don't care.

[21:48] And who am I to ruin their happiness?

[21:50] Would I spend that money on this game?

[21:52] Absolutely not.

[21:53] And the main reason I wouldn't is you can get the same exact game for $8,000.

[21:57] There is nothing different.

[21:59] There's no different mode, there's no different anything.

[22:02] Elvira doesn't even give you a personalized call out like Adam Wested.

[22:07] So there's nothing different in the game at all.

[22:11] But congratulations to those who got one because it is damn sexy.

[22:15] I can't lie, it is very sexy.

[22:17] And the foil on it is so much nicer than the foil they put on Godzilla.

[22:22] But after seeing Elvira, the Godzilla Elite, which still looks amazing,

[22:27] just didn't look nearly as cool as Elvira.

[22:30] But I will say Godzilla under the glass, I think it turns craziest game ever.

[22:35] I really do.

[22:36] I cannot say enough amazing things about Godzilla, about what Zambiyeti and Keith Owen created in this game.

[22:43] Nobody I spoke to, I haven't heard anyone.

[22:46] Anyone say anything negative about Godzilla.

[22:50] And the Ellie and the Premium, they play just as good as you think they will.

[22:55] And the added toys are so awesome that if you got a Godzilla,

[23:00] you are going to be a very happy camper.

[23:03] And it's way too early to call it.

[23:05] But I keep hearing a lot of people say this might be Stern's best pinball machine ever.

[23:11] And when they did the Stern rankings, remember when everyone voted and Iron Maiden won.

[23:16] Right? Iron Maiden beat out Lord of the Rings.

[23:19] I would argue that Godzilla is better than Iron Maiden.

[23:22] And so did this just dethrone the champion.

[23:25] Did Keith just beat himself up and become number one again.

[23:30] Now be careful when you unbox your Godzilla Ellie's,

[23:33] because I just saw someone unboxed his game in Ellie of Godzilla.

[23:37] And when they were making the game, they forgot to put the metal ball guide in the upper right part of the game.

[23:43] And the guy keeps plunging it and losing balls.

[23:46] And it was like what's going on.

[23:48] And then he opened it up and he saw like someone who manufactured this.

[23:51] Fell asleep at lunchtime and forgot to put the metal ball guide.

[23:55] How can you do that? How did that pass?

[23:57] Any quality testing? Did Stern even plunge the ball once?

[24:01] And then another guy's game arrives. This is an Ellie.

[24:04] And his entire side art, it's like they dropped the playfield on it.

[24:08] And it's all scraped and it scratched through to the bare wood.

[24:12] And they should have saw that too. Like there is no way someone walked over that game and didn't see that.

[24:17] And I think what's happening with some of this, you know, Stern's making a hundred games a day.

[24:22] And that means every once in a while there's going to be a sloppy mistake.

[24:27] Now they're not making these mistakes on most of the games,

[24:30] but they are making some mistakes.

[24:32] So just be careful when you unbox your Godzilla and look it over before you start playing.

[24:36] Jersey Jack had a really nice setup.

[24:38] They had a lot of guns and roses set up.

[24:40] I think Stern probably had like 20 Godzilla's.

[24:44] I want to say JJP had, I'm just kind of guessing right now.

[24:49] I want to say they had 15 guns and roses machine set up.

[24:53] They even had slashes collector's edition there with big speakers next to it in this middle of like this stage area.

[24:59] And I'm just going to say this and I'm not saying this because Eric snubbed me and I'm trying to get in his good graces again.

[25:05] I'm not and you know how I feel about this game.

[25:07] I walked up to this game after playing cactus Canyon, Godzilla, Legends of Vahala,

[25:12] everything at the show.

[25:14] I walked up to Slashes machine and we were playing games, me and a few friends.

[25:18] And I want to just say that I don't care and I will arm wrestle any of you that doesn't think this is a great game.

[25:25] I actually think guns and roses is the most next level pinball machine I've ever played.

[25:31] I just think it's pinball on a whole different experiential level.

[25:35] And I understand why some of you complain about like the heavy multi balls.

[25:39] I understand why some of you think the ball disappears too much.

[25:43] And I understand if you're so used to stern and how the sterns feel, this might not be your cup of tea.

[25:49] I get that.

[25:50] But from a pure experiential standpoint, there is no greater pinball machine ever from an experiential standpoint than guns and roses.

[25:59] And when you're hearing the music blast and you're seeing the lights go and you're hitting those shots.

[26:04] And I guess I want people to stop to saying it's only light.

[26:07] No, when you are hitting the shots you need to hit and then you're advancing through the song and the modes and you're hitting the scoop and you're locking balls up on the upper play field.

[26:16] It's awesome.

[26:17] It is awesome.

[26:18] When you forget about all the issues people have had with Jersey Jack machines recently and you just enjoy the game and get immersed in it.

[26:27] It is next level pinball like nobody else is doing.

[26:31] And I mean that.

[26:32] And I said this to a friend of mine.

[26:33] I said, look, Godzilla Ellie and guns and roses collectors edition.

[26:38] If you only had two pinball machines and you just have those two machines next to each other.

[26:43] Now, canada does have those two machines next to each other at coin taker right now.

[26:46] But I mean it out of a box.

[26:48] If you have those two machines next to each other, they both complement each other very nicely.

[26:53] What more do you need?

[26:55] What more from a pinball experience could you ever hope for?

[26:59] I think both of these machines next to each other you would be a satisfied pinball person for the rest of your life.

[27:05] And that is taking into account if you actually can enjoy these themes.

[27:08] I mean don't get me wrong.

[27:09] I know that theme is very important.

[27:11] And so if you don't like either theme, then I could understand why you might want something else.

[27:16] But man, it is next level pinball.

[27:19] And I walked up to Ken Cromwell and I shook his hand because I know we've had some issues too.

[27:23] And I said, Ken man, I just want to say thank you.

[27:25] Like it's great seeing you.

[27:26] And this game is still, it still is a tremendous masterpiece.

[27:30] And I mean it.

[27:31] And I know all of us out there.

[27:33] We all can't wait to see what's next from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[27:36] It is most likely going to be Toy Story.

[27:38] I did hear some more rumors about J.J.P.

[27:41] But I'm not going to share those right now.

[27:42] But it is going to be Toy Story.

[27:44] And it is probably going to be Pat Lawler's last game.

[27:47] I think he might retire after this.

[27:49] That's the other thing I heard.

[27:50] But J.J.P. man, you can't deny it.

[27:53] Like when they bring a game out, it is a spectacle to behold.

[27:57] It really, really is.

[27:58] And if you have an Ellie, you need to get those inner art blades that are the tour posters.

[28:04] The red Ellie with all those tour posters and then the tour posters in the inner art decals are so awesome looking.

[28:11] You have to get those.

[28:12] I want to finish with one final game, which was the surprise hit of this show for me.

[28:16] And this is a game that when you play it and you hear the sounds and you see the colors

[28:21] and you see how the theme is integrated.

[28:23] I think this to me is the next TNA.

[28:27] I think to me, this is the next game that somebody needs to make.

[28:31] This is the next game that if they bring this game to market, it will be a huge success.

[28:36] And I don't think I had more fun watching a little kid play a pinball machine

[28:41] than I did when I watched this little kid playing this machine.

[28:44] And he was hitting all the ramps and he was hitting all the shots

[28:48] and drop targets were going down.

[28:50] And he was hitting the coolest spinners in the history of pinball.

[28:54] I mean that, I'm going to say it again.

[28:55] These are the coolest spinners in the history of pinball.

[28:58] And it is no other than Ryan McQuade's Sonic Spinball.

[29:02] This machine, are you listening American pinball?

[29:05] Are you listening Stern pinball?

[29:07] Are you listening Jersey Jack pinball?

[29:09] Can you imagine if Ryan went over to Jersey Jack pinball and they made Sonic?

[29:14] I mean this is perfect Jack.

[29:16] You like family friendly themes?

[29:18] I mean what better theme than Sonic the Hedgehog?

[29:21] What Ryan has engineered in this game is absolutely stunning.

[29:26] This guy has done more than J-pop could do in 12 years.

[29:30] And this isn't just like you know TNA one level game.

[29:33] There is a lot of creative ideas in this game that just works so damn well.

[29:38] And I was talking to Ryan, I'm like Ryan, this game needs to be made.

[29:41] And Kened is not going to stop until we find this game a manufacturer.

[29:45] And I know American pinball announced that they're seminar that they're going to do a competition and vote on the best homebrew game and then they're going to make that game.

[29:52] No, David Fix, don't do that.

[29:54] Just make Sonic Spinball and sell 3000 units.

[29:58] Are you listening David Fix?

[30:00] Are you listening George Gomez?

[30:01] Maybe higher this guy?

[30:03] He's a great designer.

[30:04] I know Jersey Jack just hired his friend who's doing Metroid so maybe there's no room over at J-J-P.

[30:09] But somebody needs to make this game.

[30:11] Maybe it's Ryan White at CGC.

[30:13] Now I heard a rumor about Mark Richie's next game up.

[30:16] I'm going to tell you at a later date.

[30:18] I don't want there to be like any negative vibes on this show.

[30:20] So I don't want to spoil it too much.

[30:22] But I heard some stuff about Pulp Fiction.

[30:24] Oh, Kened said it.

[30:25] Pulp Fiction is coming from CGC.

[30:27] More to come on that.

[30:28] When you see Sonic you also start to ask yourself why aren't we making more pinball machines based on arcade stuff people love?

[30:36] There are so many amazing arcade games that could make amazing pinball machines.

[30:41] Can you imagine just for a moment, imagine this.

[30:44] A Super Mario Brothers game made by Jersey Jack Pinball.

[30:49] Eric Minier's Super Mario Brothers.

[30:52] Imagine that with the green pipes.

[30:54] Now imagine this.

[30:55] The green pipes, the ball goes and it goes down into it and then goes,

[30:59] then you're in a lower play field.

[31:01] And then the lower play field.

[31:03] It's like it's a dark gray bricks and you have to like go around and around and around like a fireball.

[31:08] Can you imagine how cool that would be and maybe there's an upper play field that's Bowser's castle?

[31:12] Just the visual of that.

[31:14] It would blow all of us away.

[31:16] It would make us want to throw money at this game like never before.

[31:20] A couple more things that we're going to call this show a wrap.

[31:22] So I want to say that for all of you out there who went to the Jersey Jack seminar.

[31:27] And I purposely did not go.

[31:29] And the reason I did not go was I did want to show them respect and they know my feelings on all the issues with their games.

[31:36] They know how I feel and I've voiced it so many times that so many of you are still annoyed that I've said it so much.

[31:43] So at a respect, let them have their seminar.

[31:46] Now I want to say this.

[31:47] All of you who are there, I can't believe that not one person, not one person in the crowd, raise their hand and ask them a question about play field quality.

[31:59] How is it that all of you and you know who you are?

[32:02] How is it that all of you collectively coward at that moment?

[32:06] And this is why you do need Canadian Spinball Podcast because if I was there, I would have been obligated to ask that question.

[32:14] Now we'll never know.

[32:16] We may never know the answer now because all of you guys coward and didn't ask the question.

[32:21] I know it's a tough question to ask.

[32:23] I admit that.

[32:24] It's going to put you right on the spot.

[32:25] But someone should have asked that question.

[32:28] Alright so before I go, it was Friday night and I saw Zach.

[32:31] I walked up to him and I said look, nobody likes any of the beef.

[32:35] Nobody likes any of the drama.

[32:36] I don't like it.

[32:37] You don't like it.

[32:38] It's not that we have to be best friends, right?

[32:40] You're allowed to have differences with people.

[32:42] But it's got to the point now where I've behaved in a way where I'm like annoyed with myself.

[32:46] And I don't like behaving in a way that just bums me out and sort of deflates me from this hobby.

[32:51] And so I had a long conversation with him.

[32:54] Drew was there from poor man's sort of like facilitating this.

[32:58] And I also apologized to Zach's wife for anything that I have said that had offended them.

[33:03] And I want to move forward.

[33:04] And I want to move forward in a positive way.

[33:07] And as I said to him when we were talking, it's just going to come down to consistent action.

[33:11] And that's it.

[33:12] Alright words don't matter.

[33:13] I get it.

[33:14] Like you can shake hands and say words and then you just go back to bad behavior.

[33:18] So I hope moving forward we all can move forward together.

[33:21] And the only thing I can control is my behaviors.

[33:23] I hope to lead by example with better behavior.

[33:26] I've let Greg and Zach back on to Facebook live and unblocked them and unband them.

[33:31] And I just want to talk about pinball.

[33:33] And I think the more we talk about pinball and geek out about pinball together, the better.

[33:37] And that doesn't mean we stop critiquing games.

[33:40] It doesn't mean we stop reviewing product.

[33:42] It doesn't mean we stop holding these companies accountable.

[33:45] But we should stop.

[33:46] We should stop attacking each other in the content creator world.

[33:50] We don't need that anymore.

[33:51] And we've all been the culprits of it.

[33:53] And we've all been the victims of it.

[33:55] I just want to move past it.

[33:56] And I want to lead by example.

[33:58] And I want Canadian Facebook live to be a place where everybody can come.

[34:02] I want Canadian pinball podcast to be a podcast.

[34:04] Everybody can listen to and enjoy.

[34:07] And Steve Richie said this.

[34:08] Someone asked Steve Richie what he thought of Canadian.

[34:10] I think he said something.

[34:11] I'm going to paraphrase Steve.

[34:12] He said we all don't like him in the industry.

[34:15] But we all do feel he's important.

[34:18] And I'll take that Steve.

[34:19] I will take that as some sort of compliment.

[34:22] That we all can't just be saying everything is awesome in pinball because it's not always awesome.

[34:27] But the thing that never pools, that never chips, that never needs a code update,

[34:32] that never needs a new play field, that doesn't need a new topper, that doesn't cost $25,000.

[34:37] The thing that doesn't need any of that are the people.

[34:40] And the people are amazing.

[34:42] And I will say, you know, sitting with Jack and playing November rain, seeing all the pinball people in the community,

[34:48] all the people at these companies, these people care.

[34:52] They're all good people.

[34:53] They're all fun people.

[34:55] They're all pretty charismatic.

[34:57] Like we're all connected over something where the rest of the world thinks we're the losers.

[35:02] They really do.

[35:03] 99.9% of the world would walk into pinball expo and make fun of all of us.

[35:09] And I would rather be, and I would rather be at that expo with you guys wearing weird merchandise

[35:15] and just having fun than not having a hobby like this, than not being a nerd about something like pinball.

[35:21] So it was awesome.

[35:22] It was great seeing all of you.

[35:24] And I can't wait to see more of you as more shows go on into 2022.

[35:28] So everybody, this was my review of expo.

[35:30] I hope you enjoyed it.

[35:32] And thank you everybody who listens, everyone who contributes, everyone who's bought merchandise.

[35:36] I really do appreciate each and every one of you.

[35:39] Thank you so much.

[35:40] Have a good night.

[36:06] Thank you.
