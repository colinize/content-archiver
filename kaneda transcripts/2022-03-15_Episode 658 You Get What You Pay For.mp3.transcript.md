[00:00] She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right?

[00:02] I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life.

[00:05] Plus I tell you what the 80s like, and I know what the ladies like.

[00:09] Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice.

[00:12] CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU CELU

[00:16] Welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast.

[00:19] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:20] I hope each and every one of you is not bidding on deep root items from the deep root auction.

[00:26] We're gonna talk about that.

[00:28] We're gonna talk about Mirko has the craziest set on him.

[00:33] This guy is either trolling all of us or is the most tone deaf individual in pinball history.

[00:41] He's gonna rock into TPF with his new Mirko innovations and the man is ignoring the elephant in the room.

[00:49] We're gonna talk about Mirko.

[00:51] We're gonna talk about Stern Pinball, fixing Rush Scoop in probably the weirdest and laziest

[00:58] way imaginable.

[00:59] And we're gonna talk about the fact that when you want to hide and deflect from the answers you owe the pinball community,

[01:09] here's what happens.

[01:10] You create an owner's thread and only allow owners to huddle together.

[01:15] Nobody else can get an answer from Haggis Pinball, it seems, in 2022.

[01:20] So let's get going right now.

[01:22] Alright, so first and foremost, let's talk about this deep root auction because it's going for the next 10 days.

[01:28] Now, here's what's fun about it.

[01:29] This auction is ending right when TPF begins.

[01:34] It ends March 25th.

[01:36] So Friday, when each and every one of us is at TPF or following TPF news,

[01:42] we are gonna figure out who gets these deep root items.

[01:46] And I'm here to tell you right now, Kanata called the auction house and I asked them,

[01:50] how does this auction work and they explained it to me.

[01:53] And so here's how it's gonna work.

[01:55] When you get to Friday and each item is coming down to the final few seconds,

[02:00] if someone is outbid, they will turn on three more minutes of bidding.

[02:06] And they do this to create like a frenzied bidding war at the very end.

[02:10] They also do it so nobody can snipe in and just win it.

[02:14] So if you're thinking about going in on these games,

[02:17] it absolutely makes no sense to bid until the final few seconds of the auction.

[02:22] Now, here's the thing. I asked them straight up,

[02:25] do any of these pinball machines work?

[02:28] And the nice woman over there said to me, Chris, they don't work.

[02:32] My team over here tried to get them to work and they told me

[02:36] there is no software in these games.

[02:39] And these games do not play. They do not function.

[02:43] So this is not even like buying a magic girl.

[02:46] This thing is a brick.

[02:48] And I would be very nervous if I were one of you out there

[02:51] who wants to own one of these Raza prototypes

[02:54] that you're going to ever get these games working

[02:57] because this is not a simple thing.

[02:59] Remember deep root games and the way deep root software was being designed

[03:04] was this, that they would connect to the network.

[03:07] So I am worried that this thing is never going to be fully functional

[03:12] if you think you're going to have a functioning game.

[03:14] And I will also tell you this as someone who owned a magic girl

[03:18] that was the worst playing game ever, but the most beautiful pinball machine ever.

[03:23] There is no satisfaction in owning these rare art pieces to just have on display.

[03:30] As much as you think they're going to become a conversation piece

[03:33] and everyone's going to walk up to and be like, oh my God, you have a Raza.

[03:37] I will tell you right now, it's unfulfilling.

[03:41] It's unrewarding.

[03:42] And the story is very negative.

[03:44] Now, when I was looking at this auction too, there's a lot of very expensive equipment

[03:50] that is for sale like these CNC routing machines.

[03:53] That's the stuff to get the machinery that actually operates

[03:58] and is super expensive.

[03:59] If you tried to buy it at retail price, the problem is like how many of us actually need a CNC routing machine?

[04:07] How many of us actually want to ship some of those things?

[04:10] Like this equipment to ship will cost thousands of dollars.

[04:14] And so here's what's really sad is all of the people that Robert Mueller stole money from

[04:19] and all of their retirement savings, he robbed and ruined, they're not going to get any money back.

[04:25] They're not.

[04:26] This is going to be pennies to the dollar, fractions of pennies to the dollar.

[04:31] So it sucks.

[04:32] Everyone's still going to lose in the end.

[04:34] But my gosh, when you look at the amount of chairs this company had,

[04:38] why did they have so many chairs at deep root?

[04:42] Why was everyone sitting down all of the time?

[04:45] If you look at Stern Pimball and you look at a Pimball manufacturing company, nobody's sitting down in chairs.

[04:52] Everyone is standing up making Pimball machines all day long.

[04:55] And it just goes to show what an ass clown this guy was.

[05:00] Robert Mueller was the biggest ass clown in Pimball.

[05:04] He did not make a Pimball manufacturing company.

[05:07] He made a design studio that spent millions of dollars as these jerk wads were sitting in chairs

[05:14] and doing nothing to get Pimball machines made.

[05:17] And I'm still a little bit upset that some of the people in this community that saw what was going on

[05:24] didn't say anything.

[05:26] And he was a bully and he was a coward.

[05:28] And I get that he threatened everybody with his NDAs.

[05:31] But this is the biggest joke and the biggest failure in all of Pimball history people.

[05:38] $61 million and not one single working game.

[05:45] Not one single working prototype is up for auction.

[05:50] This stuff is crap.

[05:52] It is garbage and it should be burned.

[05:54] Like we should buy these games and all of these parts and we should push all of it off of TNT's roof.

[06:00] We should get Todd Tucky and we should get the team over at TNT get the twins and push all of this garbage off of the roof.

[06:08] It deserves to be wiped from the face of the planet.

[06:12] Ah, so that being said, am I going to bid on anything?

[06:15] No, I am not going to bid on anything.

[06:17] I think this stuff is crap and I think anyone who buys this stuff is going to sorely regret it.

[06:23] And I highly doubt anyone's going to get this crap working ever.

[06:27] Alright, so deep root auction.

[06:29] Going to be a fun Friday over at Texas Pimball Festival.

[06:33] If you're going to the show, remember I will be at Perry's Steakhouse between 5.30 and 7.30pm.

[06:39] Hanging out at Perry's Steakhouse which is across the street from the Embassy Suites.

[06:44] And we're going to hang out.

[06:45] We're going to talk Pimball.

[06:47] We're going to have some drinks.

[06:48] We're going to have some fun.

[06:49] And then we're going to make our way into TPM so we can hear what Jack Guinari and Steve Ritchie have to say.

[06:56] Now I heard a rumor on the Pimball show and this is the first time I've heard this rumor

[07:00] that Jersey Jack Pimball has an anime license.

[07:04] Okay, so here's the thing about these rumors now at the Pimball show.

[07:07] And I've been telling this to Zach Many.

[07:09] And I love the correspondence over there.

[07:11] But everyone is just making stuff up now.

[07:13] Like they're just legitimately making stuff up.

[07:16] I know it's a rumor and I've been the king of this.

[07:18] Like if you make up a rumor and you have absolutely no evidence whatsoever that this rumor has any truth to it,

[07:25] it doesn't really matter, right?

[07:27] It doesn't hurt anyone.

[07:28] But here's what's funny about a rumor like this with Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:32] They can't get games out ever.

[07:35] So if they have an anime license, when do you think that license would even be on the schedule over at JJP?

[07:41] I mean, it's going to go Toy Story.

[07:43] Then it's going to go Godfather or Avatar or Matrix.

[07:47] That's my guess for the next few titles from Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:51] There's no room there for an anime license.

[07:53] So I don't think that's going to happen.

[07:55] And then you think about what anime would crossover and have appeal with the Pimball audience.

[08:01] Now you know me.

[08:01] I would love it to be Akira.

[08:03] If it was Akira, I might even give up my first born to get that Pimball machine.

[08:07] But I would imagine knowing Jack's track record, they probably got like Cowboy Bebop.

[08:13] He probably thought it was going to catch on with the Netflix show and then it bombed.

[08:17] So I don't know.

[08:18] Anime is tough.

[08:19] Like if you're going to make an anime license in Pimball,

[08:22] you've got to really limit it.

[08:24] You've got to probably say to yourself, we can sell 2000 of these.

[08:28] I don't think anime is big enough to sell at the level of a Guns N' Roses, right?

[08:33] Or a Willy Wonka.

[08:34] There's just not enough crossover mainstream appeal.

[08:37] You know, but all I want is Toy Story, right?

[08:39] We're in this little bit of a vacuum period where Jersey Jack's big announcement is coming.

[08:44] It's coming any week now.

[08:46] And when they make this announcement, I'm telling you, it's going to change everything in Pimball in 2022.

[08:52] So I'm holding my breath.

[08:54] Well, I'm not because I'm doing a show right now, but I can't wait to see Toy Story

[08:58] and the world gets to finally judge Pat Lawler's swan song machine.

[09:04] Is he going to load this game up and give us one for the memory books?

[09:09] Or is he going to make this game barren and go cheap and cut corners?

[09:13] I don't think there's going to be any middle ground on this pin.

[09:16] I think it's either going to blow us away or it's absolutely going to be disappointing.

[09:20] I can't wait to go one way or the other on this machine.

[09:23] Now, the thing with Jersey Jack is because they have so much time to get each game right.

[09:28] Our expectations are always super high on each JJP launch.

[09:33] And these games should be amazing because this company has so much time to make each game right.

[09:39] So we shall see.

[09:40] I fully expect Jersey Jack to reveal this game at MGC

[09:45] and I expect them to announce the title at TPF.

[09:48] That's my guess.

[09:50] All right, let's talk about this Rush Pinball scoop protector thing that Stern just created.

[09:56] Now, I am hearing at the Louisville Show, brand new Rush games that were unboxed

[10:02] had this new sort of scoop protector installed from the factory.

[10:06] And if you've seen it, it's these two very large, like two large.

[10:11] I don't know what you call them.

[10:13] They're like these blue rubber sort of sleeves that fit on each side of the scoop.

[10:18] And when the ball is going towards it, the ball will either go in the scoop

[10:22] or hit these blue rubber posts.

[10:24] Okay, now it looks hideous from a pure aesthetic standpoint.

[10:29] It's really hard for me to put myself in the shoes of the people over at Stern Pinball

[10:34] and nobody stood over this thing and was like, I don't know, guys,

[10:38] like that thing looks pretty damn hideous.

[10:40] It reminded me of an episode of like nailed it, you know, where people try to make the cake the right way

[10:45] and then it looks horrible.

[10:46] Like this is embarrassing.

[10:48] Stern Pinball is too good of a company.

[10:51] Stern Pinball has too many smart people over there to put something like this out into the marketplace

[10:59] as a solution to the scoop problems they are having.

[11:03] Now, here's the bigger issue than this hideous solution.

[11:06] The real issue is this.

[11:08] Stern Pinball needs to test their games more before they put them in a box for consumers

[11:15] because obviously they did not quality control test this game.

[11:20] And obviously that scoop being so close to the flippers was going to be a problem area for wear and tear.

[11:29] And there's no way around it, right?

[11:31] A scoop is going to get battered, especially a scoop this low and this close to the flippers.

[11:38] And so Stern Pinball, this is one of the downsides of having super strong flippers like a Stern machine does,

[11:43] is Stern Pinball doesn't really have a solution.

[11:46] Now, here is my solution for Stern Pinball and I wish they would just take this advice.

[11:51] Will Stern Pinball or Jersey Jack Pinball or one of these companies out there just acquire Cliffy's company?

[11:59] Will you just acquire his ability to make exclusive scoop protectors for all of your machines?

[12:05] Send the guy a whitewood six months before the game is coming out.

[12:10] You don't even need to tell him what the theme is and just have him make scoop protectors.

[12:15] So by the time your game is on the line, every single game has a Cliffy and we know that nobody makes scoop protectors better than him.

[12:26] Pat Lawler thought he could do it and he made that atrocious one on dialed in and Stern, look at this thing.

[12:31] I mean, it's absolutely the ugliest solution I think I've ever seen.

[12:36] And then what's with that like LED light over the scoop?

[12:39] This whole area of the rush machine is just so comical to me and I think people forget this.

[12:45] Like you're paying like $9,000, $11,000 for this machine and that is their solution for how to keep this scoop from falling apart.

[12:56] It's a joke people and I love Stern Pinball and I know they have really smart people over there,

[13:01] but they need to test their games more and the problem in the pinball world these days is nobody properly test their games anymore

[13:08] because they're so worried about leaks that these games I don't think are really put through the paces at all.

[13:15] In fact, we know they're not because Stern machines often have these gameplay quirks that makes everybody scratch their heads and say,

[13:22] Hey, did you even like test this thing between that and then there's like a diverter issue on rush?

[13:27] There's just things that never should have left the factory and so we will see what the next solution is because if you've looked at the photos,

[13:35] now those blue rubber posts are splitting after a short period of time like they were falling apart after Louisville show.

[13:42] So this isn't even a solution.

[13:45] It's like a stopgap measure that's not really working.

[13:48] So Stern, come on, stop being lazy.

[13:51] The rush pinball game is ugly enough as it is.

[13:54] It's one of their worst art packages in a long time.

[13:56] Don't make it even uglier than this and as a pinball podcaster,

[14:00] it pains me that we're stuck on rush as the only new Stern machine until August.

[14:06] I wish we could have got stuck on an amazing game like Godzilla, but to be frozen and the only new machine going out is rush.

[14:14] It's so boring.

[14:16] I'm so bored.

[14:16] I'm bored talking about rush.

[14:18] Let's go on.

[14:18] All right.

[14:19] Well, we have to congratulate David Fix just got promoted over at American Pinball.

[14:23] I saw the announcement yesterday.

[14:26] I think he went from director of operations to executive vice president over at American Pinball.

[14:32] David, congratulations.

[14:34] Look, it is well deserved.

[14:35] I mean, this guy came on board and he actually got their sales to go back up and he got a lot of interest in Legends of the Hala.

[14:42] So David, congrats on your promotion.

[14:45] Now, it wouldn't be canada without canada telling you how to do your job better.

[14:49] Right.

[14:49] This is what I do.

[14:50] And so David Fix, here's my advice.

[14:52] Get rid of the ugly back box and don't bank your company on original IP games.

[14:58] David, you have to be smart enough to know that you got very, very lucky with when you launched Legends of the Hala.

[15:05] You got very lucky.

[15:06] There was no inventory.

[15:08] Now, you never should have bumped up the number to 500.

[15:10] That was a sleazy marketing move.

[15:12] Very sleazy.

[15:14] And when Stern catches up with their supply issues, you're going to be in big trouble if all you've got is original IP games.

[15:22] Please, David, get Sonic Spinball into production.

[15:26] Stop messing around.

[15:28] That game looks awesome.

[15:29] You will sell more Sonic the Hedgehog pinball machines than all of your other games combined.

[15:35] Let's see if he takes canada's advice.

[15:37] All right.

[15:38] What else is going on in pinball?

[15:39] All right.

[15:40] So here's the thing, you know, I've been talking to people and they're saying, Chris, lay off of Haggis and here's the thing.

[15:45] I don't really care anymore about Haggis pinball.

[15:48] I don't.

[15:48] But I am noticing something happening in the thread.

[15:51] First and foremost, the pin side thread about Haggis pinball has turned into the ultimate dumpster fire on pin side.

[15:58] And all of this, right?

[16:00] All of this goes away.

[16:01] All of this negativity and all of this back and forth.

[16:03] That's not good for this company.

[16:05] It all goes away.

[16:06] If Damien just gives everybody an update, which is something he still has failed to do.

[16:12] And every single week and every single month that goes on without an update, without any official correspondence from them to the community,

[16:20] is a failed opportunity for him to get some of this negativity off of his plate.

[16:24] Now, I know what he's trying to do.

[16:26] His head's down.

[16:27] He's trying to get these games made and he wants to let the games do the talking.

[16:31] That's fine.

[16:31] But here's the scary part I'm starting to see within this whole storyline.

[16:35] If you study pinball history and you study all of these boutique companies and you study and you learn what I said in my last show,

[16:42] that 90% of these boutique companies go under, that 90% of them fail to get products out the door,

[16:48] even if they've got one product out the door, the chances of them surviving and making two games and three games and four games is very, very difficult.

[16:57] And most of them never accomplish that.

[16:59] So you know what I'm saying?

[17:00] Like highway pinball got people full throttles.

[17:02] Like everyone who ordered a full throttle got it.

[17:04] Did everyone who ordered an alien get it?

[17:07] No.

[17:07] So when you look at history, it shows that making pinball is really hard.

[17:11] Now, here's the other part and this is the most dangerous part.

[17:13] The most dangerous thing about predicting what will happen in the future is if you turn off studying the past, right?

[17:21] You know the phrase history will repeat itself.

[17:24] It's because history is a great place to go if we want to know what will happen in the future.

[17:30] The pinball history has shown us that often time owners don't want to see the writing on the wall.

[17:36] They don't want to ask the tough questions.

[17:39] And so what owners tend to do is they become apologists and they become purposely ignorant to some of the things they shouldn't be ignorant to.

[17:47] And then the other part is this.

[17:49] The owners tend to get together and keep everybody else out.

[17:53] And that's happening again with Haggis Pinball.

[17:55] The owners want to create an owner's thread in which you have to prove you're in on the game and only those owners can get together.

[18:03] So this is what happens, right?

[18:04] You huddle in your vacuum.

[18:06] You don't want to hear it from anyone outside of your vacuum and you want to stay in your safe little space.

[18:12] And that's fine.

[18:13] Like they can do that.

[18:14] But I don't agree with this indictment that only owners are owed an answer from Damien and Haggis Pinball.

[18:21] No, that's not how it works.

[18:23] This is a subculture.

[18:25] Pinball is a community.

[18:26] When a company comes out and makes a promise, they are making a promise to the entire pinball community.

[18:33] You know what I'm saying?

[18:34] Like it's not just if you're in on the game because so many of us have had friends who have lost money.

[18:40] So many of us have had friends who got burned.

[18:43] And what good would it have done them if everyone just stayed in a safe space or everyone just lived in a vacuum and didn't share what they knew?

[18:51] And so look, all of this is stupid and I am so disappointed and I mean this.

[18:55] I'm so disappointed in Marty and in Damien and in everyone over there who knows better than this.

[19:02] They know that you should be giving updates at least once a month to everybody.

[19:08] You came out and you publicly took everybody's money.

[19:11] You publicly made promises multiple times.

[19:14] I'm not asking you to set a date, but I'm asking you not to go radio silent.

[19:19] Like I'm asking you not to hide.

[19:22] Like this whole thing just becomes like a deflection tactic.

[19:25] And I am the only pinball podcaster.

[19:28] I mean it when I say it.

[19:29] Going after these companies until they give us an update isn't being toxic.

[19:34] It isn't being negative.

[19:36] It's what all of us pinball content creators should be doing.

[19:39] And it's also the part that makes me sometimes so frustrated when I listen to so many pinball podcasters just give these companies a pass time and time again.

[19:48] It's not just Haggis.

[19:50] They gave him a pass on the play field issues.

[19:52] They give him a pass on all these things.

[19:54] And so I just want to hold these companies accountable and I'm sorry if you feel like I'm repeating myself.

[19:59] But the only way you get change in this world is if you're consistently going after people who owe you something.

[20:06] And yes, I do believe Haggis owes the community an update after it took people's money like 10 months ago and missed like four deadlines and is now saying nothing.

[20:17] And if you don't like it, I got good news for you.

[20:20] There's like 30 other pinball podcasts out there that are free that will remind you they're free every time they put up a new show.

[20:27] Have you seen some of these clowns now?

[20:29] Like they'll do like five pinball podcasts and brag about how their show is free.

[20:33] Yeah, good.

[20:33] Come talk to me when you've done 657 suckas.

[20:37] And the other thing these clowns do who always make fun of me for being behind the paywall.

[20:41] Here's the one thing.

[20:42] None of them can do solo shows.

[20:43] They can't.

[20:44] They can't.

[20:44] I wish they would try and go do a solo show before they make fun of canada.

[20:48] Picking up a mic for five years, keeping everybody entertained and doing it when you have like a newborn kid and doing it when you have a job and doing it when you're freaking tired.

[20:57] All right.

[20:58] So before they talk smack about canada, maybe they should show a little respect to the guy that's been the champ for four years in a row.

[21:04] All right, let's go on.

[21:05] So come on Damien and Marty, give everybody an update.

[21:08] Stop hiding out.

[21:09] Like it's making your company look really bad.

[21:11] Okay, talking about making a company look really bad.

[21:14] Let's end this podcast with Mirko Playfields from Germany.

[21:18] I've never seen a dude more tone deaf with a bigger set of brass balls on him than Mirko.

[21:25] And I mean it when I say it like this guy is trolling us so hardcore.

[21:30] He knows that there are hundreds of people who have defective playfields from him and he's told us every time anyone tries to get an answer from him.

[21:39] He tells us to pound sand.

[21:41] He doesn't care.

[21:43] He legitimately does not care to answer any of his customers questions and I'm fine with that.

[21:48] Like you could be a jerk and you could go that route, but then don't come to us with your new product innovation, which is just some crappy tales of the Arabian night kit that he's coming out with.

[22:00] And he wants to march in the Texas pinball festival and do a panel seminar to talk about this thing.

[22:07] Ironically, his tales of the Arabian night kit is called the forgotten tales.

[22:13] The only forgotten tale in pinball is Mirko's forgotten how to do clear codes on playfields.

[22:18] That's the forgotten tale.

[22:20] And if he thinks he's going to get up there and just talk about this and do jumping jacks about a new kit and not answer questions about all of the playfield issues, he's got a rude awakening coming to him at T.P.F.

[22:34] I am totally shocked and I mean this.

[22:37] I am totally shocked that Jersey Jack pinball, who's the number one customer of Mirko, right?

[22:43] They're the ones who are writing Mirko checks for six, seven figures.

[22:48] I am so shocked that Jersey Jack pinball is not calling over to Mirko and saying, dude, don't come to T.P.F.

[22:55] We don't need you there.

[22:57] We don't need you to create a distraction.

[23:00] We are about to launch a new game.

[23:02] We are using your playfields in all of our new games.

[23:05] Now, maybe they're not like maybe this is good news for all of us JJP owners, but I have to believe that Mirko is going to be on board for JJP's next game.

[23:13] But I can't believe that they're like, dude, just stay away.

[23:16] I don't know anyone who really wants Mirko to get up there and I think he's doing it all wrong.

[23:20] And I said this and I'm going to do this.

[23:22] I will be at the Mirko seminar at T.P.F.

[23:27] I am not going to be disrespectful.

[23:29] I am not going to be too strident, but I am going to ask questions or a question of him.

[23:36] And I want to put him on the spot because he owes us an answer.

[23:41] And I just want to hear from the horse's mouth itself what went on with all of the playfield issues with guns and roses.

[23:49] I want him to answer that question and I hope he's preparing an answer that is satisfactory.

[23:57] And I'm going to be there and I'm going to be filming on Facebook live and I'm going to just ask him in a very polite way what went on.

[24:04] And that's it.

[24:05] I'm not there to see his toeed in like kid.

[24:08] I don't care about all of his innovations.

[24:11] I bought a game from him.

[24:12] My friends bought a game from him.

[24:14] My friends have had a lot of bad issues with his products.

[24:18] He has never ever responded to any of us.

[24:21] And this is a thing when you want to get up on stage and you want to get a seminar going, then you have to answer people's questions.

[24:27] And even if he doesn't do a Q&A, I mean this, if he tries to avoid doing a Q&A, I am going to stand up and ask this question.

[24:35] He's going to be there.

[24:37] They can't keep me out of the room and I'm going to make sure we get an answer to this question.

[24:42] You know, and I don't even care people.

[24:43] It's not even about winning Twippies.

[24:45] This show for me has always been about keeping these companies accountable.

[24:49] And I still love the arrows I get in my back that I'm toxic.

[24:53] I'm bad for the pinball community that if you want to listen to a show that's always negative about pinball, you can go listen to that other guy.

[25:00] That's one four years in a row favorite pinball podcast.

[25:03] There's a reason why.

[25:04] There's a reason why.

[25:04] And I want to say to all my haters and I know some of them listen.

[25:07] If they tried to get people to subscribe to their shows, nobody's listening and guys, nobody's paying.

[25:13] Nobody's paying.

[25:14] So look, all the haters can hate, but we're here enjoying the best pinball podcast on planet Earth.

[25:20] And I can get you everything that's relevant and everything that's newsworthy.

[25:24] I can get it to you in like 30 minutes or less.

[25:27] And you know, it's like everyone else is like an hour, an hour and a half.

[25:30] It's fine.

[25:30] Like do the long shows.

[25:31] I don't care.

[25:32] I keep it short.

[25:33] I keep it concise.

[25:34] I keep it entertaining.

[25:36] The moment I stop doing those things, I will go away.

[25:39] The moment I stop enjoying this, I will go away.

[25:41] But I'm having a lot of fun doing this for you guys.

[25:44] Thank you so much.

[25:45] We've now got 411 club members.

[25:48] The numbers aren't going down.

[25:49] They're going up.

[25:50] That's great.

[25:51] It annoys them so much because if they just do the very rudimentary math on all of this, this is the most successful

[25:58] pinball podcast of all time.

[26:00] And it's all because of you.

[26:01] Like each and every one of you is the reason why we're the most successful.

[26:06] I love it.

[26:07] Brenda loves it.

[26:08] Killian loves it.

[26:08] He smiles at me when he sees the number.

[26:10] He really does.

[26:11] Everybody have a great day.

[26:12] I will be back.

[26:13] Lots of fun stuff happening in the pinball world over the next few weeks.

[26:16] I will be there to cover it and I will be there.

[26:19] Facebook live, Texas pinball festival.

[26:21] One week to go.

[26:22] Get ready people.

[26:23] We're going to get some answers later.

[26:31] The L now flipping this cell.

[26:33] That's right.

[26:34] I had to call up L.

[26:35] Yo, what up?

[26:36] I hit plus don't say word and we got it on the night.
