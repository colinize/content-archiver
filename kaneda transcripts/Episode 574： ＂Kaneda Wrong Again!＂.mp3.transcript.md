[00:00] 1. Scooby-Doooby-Doo Where are you? We've got some work to do now.

[00:07] 2. Scooby-Doooby-Doo Where are you? We need some help from you now.

[00:13] 2. Scooby-Doooby-Doo You know as Scooby-Doo would say RUP ROP RROCKING

[00:25] I guess one of our rumors that we were hearing is turning out to look more and more like this rumor might not be correct

[00:32] And that is that the next spooky title is gonna be Scooby-Doo and that's what my my hints were trying to lead you down that road that it was a campy

[00:42] Fun spooky themed that everyone grew up with it was Scooby-Doo

[00:46] Okay, it was Scooby-Doo and we know that Nick Parks has the Scooby-Doo license

[00:51] He had the Jetsons license so it made total sense that Scooby-Doo would be a title spooky would consider and it just would make so much sense

[01:00] And I think for so many people out there I was reading the thread a lot of you were really excited to get Scooby-Doo

[01:06] You were like take my money now kind of theme now some of you weren't now

[01:10] I still think Scooby-Doo would be an incredible license even just hearing that theme song the colorful world of Scooby-Doo the mystery vans

[01:18] Solving those mysteries finding out that it's old man withers underneath the mask ripping off the you know the culprits faces

[01:25] One after another until they find out who it really was and just the campiness of it

[01:29] And I think people really want pinball machines that have personality now

[01:33] I am hearing that it is not Scooby-Doo and this is what it is when you do rumors like this

[01:39] You're gonna get some right you're gonna get some wrong

[01:41] But I know that you guys who listen to canators bin ball pod guys would rather us go down a road in which we're speculating

[01:47] And I'm sharing with you the stuff I'm hearing now a lot of people were saying Scooby-Doo

[01:51] But I'm here to tell you now that I'm hearing that it is not Scooby-Doo

[01:55] Now if it turns out to be Scooby-Doo I wouldn't be surprised don't get me wrong

[01:59] We know that Scooby-Doo is a license that Nick Parks and Spooky Pimball have been floating around and we got the Jetsons

[02:06] Will we get a more improved game because the Jetsons was really basic really barren

[02:11] Will they make that game one day?

[02:13] I actually think they will now here is the other part

[02:16] I'm hearing is that this is gonna be a horror theme now

[02:19] So this is like complete 180

[02:22] Connato you're never gonna win another Twippy with this kind of misinformation

[02:25] This is a complete 180 from what I was hearing is that it is gonna be horror themed

[02:30] So everything that you know that I told you like a week ago

[02:34] Throw it out the window about this fun family generational theme that's colorful and campy now

[02:40] We're right back into the world of horror and

[02:43] I don't know if I want to get a horror pin

[02:46] I'm not sure why so many people are fascinated by horror movies and pinball format

[02:51] But if it is going to be a horror theme

[02:54] What do we think it's gonna be is it now gonna be night of the living dead?

[02:59] Is it gonna be Friday the 13th which I think is the front runner right now if you were to ask me?

[03:04] Is it going to be that because if it were going to be if we're going to be Nightmare in Elm Street

[03:10] It's been done before but there's a lot of horror themes that have never been done in pinball form Texas chain saw massacre

[03:17] What I saw like I mean I could go down a whole list of horror films

[03:22] But it's just not a genre I really love and so if they made a horror themed pinball machine

[03:28] It would it would be an easy pass for me and I know a lot of people say like

[03:33] Mandalorian easy pass this or that easy pass for me personally and this is just canada

[03:38] The thing that I would pass so quickly up on is a horror themed pinball machine

[03:43] I just it's just not my genre. I just I don't ever watch horror movies

[03:48] I don't find them to be that enjoyable. I did when I was a kid I got scared by them

[03:53] But as a grown adult I just don't choose to watch like slasher films anymore

[03:58] I just don't care

[03:59] I think the last stuff that really scared me was what was a paranormal activity those movies in which there was like the slow moving

[04:06] You know security camera footage inside the house and stuff pops out that stuff is fun to watch at a movie theater

[04:13] When everyone is screaming

[04:15] But the other part about horror movies when it comes to pinball machines is that a pinball machine can't scare you

[04:21] So it's like so silly to me to make a horror themed pinball machine because the machine itself can't accomplish

[04:28] What the movie is trying to do which is make you jump out of your seat?

[04:32] So that being said let's see what this might be now

[04:36] This is gonna start a whole new list of titles that it could possibly be and I'm also hearing that spooky pinball is going to make more than

[04:45] 750 this time around that they realized that they're selling out Rick and Morty in four hours

[04:51] That there's more demand out there in pinball than

[04:55] 750 but the problem with spooky is nobody wanted to wait a year and a half to get a Rick and Morty people have

[05:01] And they're about to finish up their Rick and Morty line in May or June and that's why we're gonna hear the new title in June

[05:07] But do you really want spooky pinball to say hey?

[05:10] We're gonna make a thousand titles and to make a thousand games at 10 games a week

[05:15] You're looking at the following now look if there's 52 weeks in a year a thousand titles sounds like two years

[05:23] So I think they've upped their production to around 15 games a week

[05:26] But that still begs the question if spooky pinball ups the volume

[05:31] They either need to hire more people and make more games a week which they probably should right this company needs to expand now

[05:39] Like Charlie has to realize that he's at a point now in this hobby people want pinball machines

[05:46] The demand for new pinball machines is through the roof

[05:50] He's either gonna take advantage of this incredible moment for his company and get a little bit bigger

[05:56] Does that get huge he's done it right? He's gone from 250 games

[06:00] Well, they went from 150 to 250 to 500 maybe there was a 300 game in there somewhere 250 to three

[06:07] I think it was 300 maybe rob zombies to 500 to 750 and so now for them to go to a thousand feels like the next

[06:15] Natural step for a company like spooky. I fully expect them to do that and maybe hire a few more people

[06:21] Maybe have night shifts figure out a way to do it

[06:23] Maybe some of this is with Chicago gaming company and that partnership we've heard about but spooky pinball is a company

[06:30] That isn't a great position to grow

[06:32] But I do think people want more than just one game every two years and I think if that's the direction

[06:38] They're gonna go in they either have to like probably think about putting more into these games giving you more

[06:45] Maybe charging a little bit more because I just don't think they want to make one game for two years

[06:50] And the other thing is I'm and I'm gonna talk about this more in this episode is something I'm calling

[06:55] Penflation and we're gonna start to see terrible terrible

[06:58] Penflation in terms of how much pinball machines are going to cost and ultimately it's getting to the point where the most

[07:04] Affordable pinball machine you can buy today is a new inbox game and so customers are gonna be clamoring for

[07:11] New inbox titles because that's the cheapest these games will ever be it seems like if we're going off of prices

[07:18] We're gonna talk a little bit more about that but before I get to that let's talk about some more rumors news and

[07:23] Speculation so let's jump to some news items. There is a great unboxing of the pinball brothers alien machine or friend over in

[07:31] York

[07:31] I'm not gonna butcher his name send his like his his YouTube pages

[07:36] Retro Sengo and he did an entire 30 minute unboxing of the pinball brothers alien machine and let me just say this video is

[07:44] Amazing it's everything that people have been asking for since the pinball brothers have announced they're bringing this game back

[07:52] And it still baffles me that the pinball brothers have the worst marketing on planet earth like why didn't they themselves

[07:59] Just film something like this. This is all people wanted to see they wanted people to lift the hood on the game and see

[08:05] What the new boards look like because all they were saying is we've fixed the problems that Andrew highway had in his game

[08:12] So show us the fixes they never did all they were focusing on were the things they removed that made the Andrew highway package like a little bit

[08:19] Sexier they removed the playfield screen they removed the big screen in the back box

[08:23] They removed the inner art blades that lit up so all the things the cabinet didn't look as nice so everything was like

[08:30] Eh, I don't know but once they lifted the hood once this guy lifted the hood on the pinball brothers version of alien

[08:37] Pinball I must say it looks really really good. It looks like a very well built machine. It's super super clean

[08:44] It looks super easy to service the boards look really nice. There's like these light gray boards

[08:50] Everything looks very very clean now for a wide body game when you lift up this alien

[08:55] It is like mostly lights like there's not a ton in this game

[08:59] But I will say if you are in on this game and you are expecting an alien from the pinball brothers

[09:05] I think this is a good day for you. I think you've seen this game now and you see that the build quality looks really good

[09:10] We will know now how great the build quality is by how it holds up over time right because nobody's played this new version of the game for very long

[09:19] If they can get this game into a nicer looking cabinet

[09:23] If they can get the aesthetical appearance of this game to be on par with where other games are at

[09:29] I think they could sell a lot of these games

[09:32] I just wouldn't buy this pro version of it. I just still think the overall package doesn't look good

[09:37] But the build quality looks great

[09:40] So this leads us to ask the next question is will the pinball brothers stick around and what will their next title be now?

[09:47] Their next title is queen they still have the queen license

[09:50] I found this out as well. It's not gonna be a stern game. It is going to be a pinball brothers game

[09:56] So if they can get to queen they will have a great opportunity because the other part about this company that we don't often talk about is

[10:05] Where they're located they have a distinct advantage being in Europe so they could be a player in the European pinball market

[10:13] Unfortunately all the European manufacturing pinball companies have been disasters

[10:17] But people in Europe pay more money for pins. They have to pay to have them sent over

[10:23] There's taxes they have to deal with every once in a while that suck and so for you guys over in Europe

[10:28] You would love to see a pinball company or two succeed

[10:33] So you don't have to rely only on the American manufacturing to get you pinball machines and the other company in Europe Dutch pinball

[10:41] Everybody wants to see them make another game because the big Lebowski was incredible

[10:45] Incredible, but it looks dated now. It does look a little dated. We've seen it forever

[10:50] I do find the lit up apron to be super cool

[10:53] But you know, where's the next game right you need to have momentum in a pinball company

[10:57] You don't want to feel like nobody wants to see a pinball company come out with something exciting

[11:03] Take money from customers not get customers their games and then spend almost a decade trying to make your customers whole

[11:11] That's what's happened with highway pinball. That's what's happened with Dutch pinball. It's laborious

[11:15] It's frustrating. It's pointless right within the amount of time it takes these companies to get one game to people who paid for it years ago

[11:24] Stern pinball will make 40 games and get people those games Jersey Jack will get people their games

[11:29] Spooky pinball will get people their games Chicago gaming company American pinball

[11:34] I mean the list goes on and on of companies that when they take people's money

[11:38] They just get them their games. There's no drama whatsoever

[11:41] So I hope these European companies figure it out and this is a really cool video

[11:45] It's on my Facebook page if you want somewhere to go find it

[11:48] It's also called pinball brothers alien pinball machine unboxing if you want to search on YouTube

[11:54] But go check that out. I want to give a shout out to Timothy Roth over at TNT amusements

[11:58] He went to pin brew in Ohio and sent me this care package and I must say Brenda was like what the hell

[12:06] I thought you were just getting a t-shirt from this guy open it up

[12:09] There's a hat there's multiple t-shirts. There's other swag inside the box

[12:13] So Tim and all my friends over at TNT amusements. Thank you so much. Thank you so much

[12:18] I really really am digging this. I'm gonna have to rock this gear on my Facebook lives moving forward

[12:23] What else is going on in pinball? Okay, so let's talk about the Mandalorian

[12:27] I've had some people hit me up and say you said you weren't gonna spoil the hard work of Stern pinball and then a

[12:33] Show or two later you said it's the Mandalorian. Okay, and I'll tell you why because I always talk about rumored themes

[12:40] Okay, to me telling you what the theme is of the Mandalorian isn't spoiling the hard work over at Stern

[12:46] Do you know what it looks like? I haven't seen it. I have some details on the game

[12:50] But that's it so I'm not spoiling what their hard work is all of their hard work is still a mystery to me

[12:57] I have not seen any of it now

[12:59] I did not leak photos of guns and roses because I did not want to spoil the hard work of Eric and team who designed that game

[13:07] Like you deserved to see guns and roses the way Jersey Jack wanted you to see it

[13:13] And that's why I didn't leak anything

[13:16] But I was not gonna hold back if I knew the title which was guns and roses

[13:20] I haven't held back on the title of Toy Story and if I find out Eric's next title

[13:26] Guess what I will tell you what the rumored next game is from Eric Minier. That's what I do

[13:32] Okay, so don't accuse can he to of ruining the hard work of these companies?

[13:37] Okay, so let's ruin some more details about the Mandalorian release. Okay, so here's what I'm hearing the release date is supposed to be

[13:43] May 11th now people are like why may 11th?

[13:47] Why not seven days earlier and hit May 4th Star Wars day?

[13:52] Wouldn't that make total sense and the answer is yes

[13:55] So I'm hearing May 11th, but it might not be May 11th. It might be May 4th

[14:00] It's gonna be probably between May 4th and May 11th, but May 11th is the date I am hearing stern is planning to reveal this thing

[14:09] Now that means we might get a tease on May 4th and they might roll it out and then have a bigger reveal the following week

[14:16] So we'll see what happens, but you heard it here

[14:18] May 11th is the date that canada is hearing and once again everybody these are rumors like I haven't seen

[14:25] Stern's release schedule. I haven't seen the game. Okay, so take everything I say with that in mind now

[14:32] Here are some other details that I'm hearing there will be

[14:37] 600 L's of the Mandalorian that is the number I'm hearing that Stern will have on this game

[14:43] 600 L's which will sell out in less than a day

[14:49] And I'm hearing and I'm telling you right now

[14:51] I'm hearing that these games are already pretty much sold out from distributors

[14:56] So if you want a Mandalorian pinball machine you best be on your distributors list for the next Stern LE

[15:02] Some of them won't tell you the title. They'll be like we'll put you on the list for the next L's

[15:07] But I know guys like Trent, Trent is sold out already of his Ellie allotment because they know how many they're gonna get each time

[15:14] They have to pre-order Ellie's and I think the way it works is when a distributor puts in his number of Ellie's

[15:21] He has to buy that number of Ellie's for each release

[15:24] So that's why they're not guessing how many he's gonna get so let's say

[15:28] Zach many might have 20 Ellie's that he gets okay, so he's gonna get 20 Ellie's of each title

[15:34] He can up that number

[15:35] But I think he has to commit to that number for the next title or two

[15:38] I'm not sure how that part works if Zach is listening to that

[15:42] I hope he can clarify on the pinball show how does it exactly work between Ellie allotment and distributors

[15:49] But Trent knows that if he's getting 40 or 50 Ellie's he's gonna get 40 or 50 of each one

[15:55] And so if he has a wait list of 50 plus people for the Mandalorian

[15:59] He has no more to sell people so we'll see how this goes

[16:03] But this is a title that's gonna sell out immediately and 600 is definitely not enough

[16:08] It's definitely not enough

[16:09] And the thing is and I was saying it earlier the cheapest time to ever get some of these pinball machines now is when they are

[16:16] New in box that'll be the final thing I talk about on this episode is

[16:19] Pinflation and what's going on and why I think new in box sales are going to be through the roof over the next couple years

[16:26] With so many new people in the hobby

[16:27] But before I do that one more detail for you to chew on the artwork as I've said is going to be illustrated

[16:34] The illustrator who's doing the art package on the Mandalorian is someone who's done a stern machine in the past

[16:41] It is not zombie Eddie. It is also not Johnny Crap

[16:45] So I'll let you guess from there now. Let's talk about pinflation as we see pirates of the Caribbean

[16:52] This guy just listed one the CE for $32,000 and then a day later the price is

[16:59] $37,000 why?

[17:01] What happened? Why is it all of a sudden 5,000 more?

[17:05] Did he get offers at 32 so now it's that much?

[17:09] I saw our friend Justin Kelly listed his tron Ali on Facebook tron Ali for $25,000

[17:17] We were talking because he has one of those matrix pinball machines that was made about like 10 years ago

[17:24] The matrix pinball not a licensed thing not legal to really like sell it

[17:29] But like 12 of them were made in the world and he has one with all the bells and whistles

[17:33] It's a risk in of Johnny new Monic and we were talking about like how much if you were to list that game

[17:38] How much would you list it for you know what prices we were saying?

[17:42] 40 to 50,000 dollars for basically a homebrew game that's a risk in of Johnny new Monic

[17:49] 40 to 50,000 dollars

[17:52] Why are prices going so high? It's easy. It's just like the real estate market right now that's happening in America

[17:58] You have a lack of supply you have more people demanding the item and there's not enough new inventory

[18:06] That's what's happening in the housing market if you've watched what's happening with the frenzy over getting a new home in America

[18:13] Getting a home in general. There's not enough new homes being built. So what does that do?

[18:18] It creates scarcity

[18:20] There's so when people want a new home and there's not enough new ones what happens?

[18:24] They have to look at existing homes and then the prices of those existing homes start to skyrocket as well

[18:30] And it becomes a bidding war to get anything available if I can't have new

[18:35] Tell me what's been made already and that's exactly what's happening in Pimbal

[18:39] People are going to be locked out of new inbox games that they really really want and we saw that with Guns and Roses

[18:45] Collector's Edition right sold out in what in hour?

[18:48] Maybe maybe less and then what happened immediately overnight a

[18:54] $12,500 Pimbal machine which you could have ordered directly on

[18:57] JJP's website

[18:58] It wasn't impossible to get but overnight the price becomes

[19:03] $20,000 and people are spending that on them a new inbox guns and roses collector's edition is now a hot commodity

[19:12] Now what do you think that Pimbal machines going to be worth in a year?

[19:15] Let's say you keep it new in box

[19:17] More and more people come into this hobby which is which is what's happening?

[19:21] This hobby is growing

[19:22] It's attracting more and more people more and more people are getting bit by the Pimbal bug

[19:27] They're seeing how fun it is to buy Pimbal machines to play Pimbal machines to collect Pimbal machines

[19:33] And they really are works of art

[19:35] So we're getting people from the art world we're getting car collectors that understand this is fun

[19:40] We're getting guys who are watch collectors understanding that this is fun

[19:43] Like basically just boomers with money who grew up with fun things now have a lot of extra money to burn

[19:50] And if you're looking for something to put your money into

[19:53] That's actually a decent investment as well because if you buy a Pimbal machine and you enjoy it

[19:58] And then you go to sell it you're not going to lose your shirt on most of these games

[20:02] And so we are now in a period in which there's going to be something called

[20:06] Penflation and if you think about what inflation is right what is inflation?

[20:09] Like let's just read the definition of inflation in economics inflation is a general rise in the price level and an

[20:16] Economy over a period of time have we seen a rise in the price level of Pimbal over time in the economy of Pimbal

[20:23] Yes, we have and then when the general price level rises each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services

[20:31] Consequently, right? So as Pimbal machines get pricier and pricier fewer people will be able to buy them

[20:38] And we're seeing that as well

[20:40] And so if you're looking at where Pimbal prices are going to go they're going to go north

[20:45] If you think Rick and Morty was as high as spooky is going to go on a new inbox game with all the bells and whistles

[20:51] You're wrong. It was $9800 and guess what sold out in four hours

[20:56] Jersey Jack Pimbal sold people guns and roses collector's edition for

[21:01] $12,500 sold out immediately. What does that mean?

[21:06] Have they hit the price ceiling? I think we're going to see toy story be priced at least at 135

[21:12] But if Jersey Jack were smart and again, this is just them if they really wanted to test the limits

[21:17] Jersey Jack could easily sell

[21:20] 500 toy story collectors editions for $15,000 and guess what?

[21:25] They would sell immediately because at these numbers they're ridiculously low. I mean there's a ridiculously low number of

[21:33] LEs and collectors editions when it comes to Stern and Jjp

[21:38] Ridiculously low you're telling me in a hobby that is thousands of wealthy people all over the world

[21:43] Thousands of them who love this hobby if you're going to make only 500

[21:49] You could price it wherever you really want

[21:52] Because the super wealthy who are in this hobby the higher you price the game

[21:57] The more they feel like they're getting something valuable look as much as I made fun of the 50

[22:02] Elvirus signature editions that were $15,000 right the piece of couch in it the recent ones have been selling for 20 to

[22:10] $25,000 who was wrong? It wasn't like I mean me making fun of it wasn't wasn't wrong

[22:16] I mean I still think it's stupid

[22:18] But the truth is the money's there the demand is there and you could either sit in the corner and like cry about it

[22:25] Or you could realize that prices are going to keep going up now

[22:29] I will say this as the prices continue to go up in pinball

[22:32] It makes it easier for many of us to just sit it out and say I'm not buying

[22:38] I'm not buying until either these prices come down

[22:42] Until either the product goes up in quality and features and wow factor

[22:47] But I'm not going to start spending $10,000 on a machine

[22:51] One of the greatest ways to combat inflation and pinflation is to make more pinball machines

[22:56] And that's why we need more pinball companies to actually bring products to market and not take forever

[23:03] Because if Jersey Jack pinball had two games a year and spooky had two games a year and Chicago gaming company had two games a year

[23:10] It would actually help drive prices down not up

[23:14] But maybe they don't want to do that right because actually the company that's keeping pinball prices the lowest

[23:19] I know this sounds crazy

[23:20] But the company that's keeping pinball prices the lowest because they are actually

[23:24] Bringing new pinball into the marketplace. They are increasing the supply of pinball is stern pinball

[23:30] So for all of you out there that want to hate stern pinball without stern pinball

[23:34] And I mean this without stern pinball bringing four to five games out a year the prices would go through the roof

[23:41] Because without them there be no supply it's like the housing market there be no new homes

[23:46] If there were no new homes being built all the existing homes that were available would go through the roof

[23:51] And whatever new homes become available on the market would be priced so high because they know they have something people want

[23:57] And that's what's happening right now in pinball stern is able to keep prices somewhat out of constant at a decent price for everybody

[24:03] Because of volume

[24:05] But if stern were to go away tomorrow

[24:07] How much would a Jersey Jack machine cost right if stern went away tomorrow?

[24:10] How much would a spooky machine cost how much could they charge

[24:14] Knowing that 90% of the inventory of new inbox games goes away

[24:18] Now you've got the only game in town you could charge through the moon

[24:23] So we all should be very thankful that stern is here to sort of keep pinball prices down

[24:27] I know this sounds crazy and counterintuitive to what we've been saying about stern is they're driving prices up

[24:33] The truth is they're not

[24:34] Without stern pinball prices would be astronomical okay

[24:39] We're seeing some astronomical things on games are no longer being made

[24:42] And that's just part of where this hobby is going like pirates of the Caribbean

[24:46] I can't afford two

[24:47] Elise or two CEs think about like this if two CEs are $15,000 each

[24:53] Do you really want to spend 30,000 dollars on two pinball machines?

[24:58] And and when you look at games like these pirates of the Caribbean's the only reason people really want this game is because they're not making it anymore

[25:06] I mean, it's crazy that game is such a prime example of it's now crossed over from being a game

[25:13] It's now a collectible we are seeing this in pinball as well and people don't want to admit it

[25:18] But nowadays

[25:20] These things if they're no longer games to be flipped and they're collectible items

[25:26] So now we're going to start to see what's happened in the automotive world

[25:30] What's happened in the video game world what's happened in the trading card world

[25:35] These are now collectibles that are worth a lot of money

[25:38] I asked just and how often do you play your matrix machine if it's worth

[25:41] 40 to 50,000 and he's like maybe once a week

[25:45] He gets his kick on it. He waxes it down, but he doesn't want to play it

[25:49] And that's the other thing happening in pinball

[25:52] We are going to see more and more people because they're spending a lot of money on these machines

[25:58] And they understand that if they keep it mint and they keep it pristine

[26:03] They're not going to want to play it

[26:05] And unfortunately much like the car collecting world in which low miles is the most important thing

[26:11] People will not use these items as intended

[26:15] They will just use them to flex and to have bragging rights

[26:20] And that's I've seen that in the Dodge Demon community

[26:22] That's why I don't like the Dodge Demon community because I drive my Dodge Demon

[26:27] And every time I talk to a new owner the first question is how little miles do you have on it?

[26:32] Like like it's some badge of honor that you've had a Dodge Demon for three years and you have 28 miles on it

[26:38] It's like pathetic. I have almost 5,000 miles on my demon and I barely drive it

[26:42] Which just goes to show you that everybody who owns these cars

[26:47] All they're thinking about is the future resale of it

[26:50] And it makes no sense to me because we're all going to die

[26:53] If you're not enjoying this stuff, why are you buying it?

[26:55] But there's something about the collector mindset

[26:58] The enjoyment they get is in keeping it mint

[27:02] The enjoyment they get is not in using it

[27:05] And I'm not here to say they're wrong. It's not the way I want to live

[27:08] I'm much more about minimalism

[27:10] I'm much more about lesses more

[27:12] And the things we do have we should enjoy them to their fullest

[27:16] Because we are going to die

[27:18] I think if you spend time in a hospice

[27:20] Or you spend time in a hospital right?

[27:22] If you see where people come into this world

[27:24] And you see where people go out

[27:26] You would realize how stupid it was

[27:28] That you didn't just beat on that Lamborghini

[27:31] How stupid it was that he didn't just flip that pinball machine

[27:34] 5,000 plays

[27:35] How stupid it is that we're like holding on to toppers and boxes

[27:39] Trying to make a few thousand dollars

[27:41] Because ultimately, ultimately, you know the person who's enjoying it is having the most fun

[27:45] But there's no denying it

[27:47] We have now entered into a period

[27:49] In which mostly collectors

[27:51] And mostly OCD collectors will be buying these games

[27:55] And just trying to preserve them

[27:57] Which leads me to an interesting point on like games like Razor

[28:01] Like if Razor makes it out

[28:03] 130 Razors

[28:05] As much as people might say

[28:06] Oh it's stupid, oh it's this, oh it's that, J-Pop sucks

[28:09] It doesn't matter

[28:10] It doesn't matter if there are more than 130 people

[28:14] Who want that game, who want that experience

[28:18] The sky is the limit on where these games can go

[28:21] And I'm going to cover it on this podcast

[28:23] I mean I've always covered stuff like this

[28:25] Because this is stuff that's much more interesting to me

[28:28] Covering the economy of this hobby

[28:31] Covering where these prices are going

[28:33] And realizing that we haven't even scratched the surface

[28:37] On how high pinball can go

[28:41] We haven't even scratched the surface

[28:42] I'm still surprised that Jersey Jack Pinball doesn't understand this yet

[28:47] I don't know why they want to break their backs

[28:49] Trying to make thousands of games

[28:52] When they can make a thousand or two

[28:54] And charge so much more

[28:56] And still sell every single one

[28:59] Because if you were just think about it for a minute

[29:01] If you were to sell guns in roses CE

[29:04] For twenty thousand dollars from the factory

[29:07] Do you think they wouldn't sell them?

[29:09] They would

[29:10] People would have to own them

[29:12] And then from there

[29:13] The prices would just keep going up and up

[29:15] I know, I know what you're saying

[29:17] You're saying, Kaneda, what are you doing?

[29:18] Don't put these thoughts in their head

[29:20] You should be rooting against this stuff

[29:22] And you should be sticking up for the people

[29:24] Who really saved pinball

[29:26] Who really saved pinball?

[29:27] I was having this conversation with my friend Dr. Frightner

[29:30] He's like Chris, you know who really saved pinball?

[29:33] It was the blue collar pinball player and buyer

[29:36] And location person who saved pinball

[29:39] Because without those people

[29:40] Without those blue collar pinball buyers

[29:43] There wouldn't have been anyone to buy these stern machines

[29:46] Now I did say to him, look

[29:47] I'm not so sure about that

[29:49] That blue collar people in 2008

[29:52] Were buying three thousand dollar pinball machines

[29:55] As the recession was hitting

[29:57] So I wouldn't necessarily say it was blue collar

[30:00] But he does have a point

[30:02] This hobby became very attractive to so many of us

[30:06] Because it was also not breaking the bank

[30:09] It was more affordable

[30:11] You could get a toy or two

[30:13] You could find something that you can't find anymore

[30:16] You know what that word is

[30:18] You used to be able to find a deal

[30:21] You used to be able to find games

[30:23] That were great in the 90s for just a few hundred bucks

[30:26] I mean great games

[30:28] You used to be able to get like an Indiana Jones

[30:30] For maybe like a thousand dollars or two

[30:32] You used to be able to find these games

[30:34] All over the place

[30:36] And a lot of times people would just like

[30:38] Hey I need to get rid of this pinball machine

[30:39] Do you want it?

[30:40] Like it was stuff like that

[30:41] Those days are over

[30:42] Okay, so we'll see where all this goes

[30:44] Killing is starting to coup in Christ

[30:45] So I gotta go attend to him

[30:47] This has been a fun episode to do for you guys

[30:49] It's been episode 574

[30:51] It's not gonna be Scooby-Doo

[30:53] Prices are going through the roof

[30:55] 600 Mando LEs

[30:56] If you haven't already

[30:58] Get your name on the list

[30:59] I don't want to see any of you have to spend over sticker

[31:02] Okay, because then you're gonna have to buy for me

[31:04] You don't have to buy from Canada

[31:06] You're gonna have to buy for me

[31:07] And then I'm gonna charge you like

[31:08] $50,000 for it

[31:09] All right, later

[31:19] Scooby-Doo

[31:21] I know we'll catch that dinner
