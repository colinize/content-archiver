[00:00] It was actually between the Beatles and Muppet Babies soundtrack that I wanted to start

[00:21] this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast and the sky is falling in the world of Pimball

[00:28] because the Beatles has been revealed to the world.

[00:32] We all knew it was coming.

[00:34] We all told you that it was going to be a re-skin of Sea Witch, which it is.

[00:41] There are some differences and we're going to talk about what those are.

[00:45] But why is anybody even shocked by what they saw?

[00:49] Did you think we were lying?

[00:51] Did you think me and Jeff and Ryan and Marty and all the other Pimball news outlets out

[00:57] there who have been telling you all for months that the Beatles is going to be a re-themed

[01:04] of Sea Witch.

[01:05] It's going to have some spinning discs on it.

[01:07] They're going to make 1964.

[01:09] They're going to make 100 diamond editions.

[01:12] We knew everything.

[01:13] We knew Christopher Franchi was the artist.

[01:15] There was really nothing left to see but the pin itself.

[01:20] Now what is hilarious about today is the reaction from people after seeing the physical

[01:29] embodiment of everything you already knew you were going to get.

[01:34] And I'm almost surprised.

[01:36] I'm surprised that your expectations were somewhere else.

[01:40] Like were you just waiting to complain because you knew all this information many, many

[01:46] weeks ago.

[01:47] But now it's real.

[01:49] And I guess the pain is also real for a lot of you out there.

[01:55] But I don't want to do what you probably think I'm going to do on this podcast, which is

[02:01] just a tax turn and blame them for ruining your sensitive little pinball emotions or ruining

[02:11] your feelings of entitlement when it comes to pinball.

[02:16] But every single pinball game that gets made has to be made for your hobbyist little

[02:25] ass.

[02:26] It's not the case.

[02:27] What I want to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast is I want to try and look

[02:32] at this from both angles.

[02:34] From a stern business decision to do this game and from a hobbyist standpoint.

[02:41] And I think this game out of all of the games Stern has ever done.

[02:47] I think this one is probably the most polarizing pinball machine ever released.

[02:55] And here's why we started to see this a little bit with a supreme machine.

[03:00] But none of you gave a shit about supreme, right?

[03:02] There's like not anyone who loves pinball that is also like a supreme fanatic.

[03:09] That was like a machine that came out and you didn't give two shits about cool.

[03:15] They made this first supreme people.

[03:17] I don't even give a shit about those millennials, those idiots who wait online to buy meaningless

[03:22] items with the name supreme on it.

[03:25] But now that it's the Beatles and it's being labeled as the only Beatles pinball machine

[03:32] of all time.

[03:34] And many of you are big Beatles fans.

[03:38] This one hurts because this one you want it to also be a great pinball experience.

[03:47] But beyond that, right?

[03:49] Because you can still have a fun pinball experience without creating a whole new pinball game, right?

[03:55] I mean, imagine if they just re-skinned Monster Bash and made all the monsters Beatles, right?

[04:00] Game suck now?

[04:01] I don't know.

[04:02] You tell me, Hilton?

[04:03] All right.

[04:04] But this one hurts because this one's got people so torn because on some level, if you're

[04:13] a Beatles fan, you want your band that you love to get the best pinball treatment possible

[04:22] because you know, why does a band like Aerosmith get an all new game?

[04:26] Why does a band like ACDC, a band like Metallica, a band like Alice Cooper gets his own

[04:34] original game?

[04:35] All of these bands get their original pinball game and you get a re-skinned.

[04:41] Okay.

[04:42] So let's look at it like that.

[04:44] This is from, let's start with the hobbyist point of view first on just that part of it.

[04:49] If you are a pinball hobbyist and a Beatles fan, I feel like you feel like you've been

[04:54] wronged by Stern pinball.

[04:57] How dare they?

[04:58] And your vitriol is exploding right now.

[05:03] Like you're angry as fuck because this is it.

[05:07] This isn't only the first.

[05:09] This is the only Beatles pinball machine you're ever going to get.

[05:16] And you don't want it.

[05:18] It sounds like.

[05:20] Now, wait to flip it, wait to see it.

[05:23] But right now you don't want it and you're telling everybody that.

[05:27] So from a vantage point of a pinball hobbyist who likes the Beatles, yes, you feel wronged

[05:36] by Stern.

[05:37] Okay.

[05:38] Now, let's look at it from Stern's point of view.

[05:42] So Stern isn't really making this game per se to the pinball hobbyist who loves pinball.

[05:52] And that's why this is kind of weird to me.

[05:54] We're going to talk about this.

[05:55] They got away with that with Supreme, but they're not going to get away with that really

[06:01] with Beatles because like I said, pinball people also like the Beatles.

[06:05] So they needed to make a game that appeased both parties, both the pinball hobbyist and

[06:13] the Beatles collector.

[06:15] But it seems like they're losing the pinball hobbyist as of today.

[06:20] Now I also think a lot of you who live on pinside who are on the form right now complaining

[06:28] about this game.

[06:30] Most of you have a tendency to usually complain about everything.

[06:34] So you've got those guys like you guys live for this shit.

[06:37] The people who hate on pinball who love to articulate their disappointment in the hobby.

[06:46] Don't lie.

[06:47] You guys love shit like this.

[06:49] You love something to bitch about.

[06:52] The only thing missing from this thread right now is oric telling us how he could have

[06:57] done a better job.

[06:58] I'm just waiting for that.

[06:59] It'll come.

[07:00] He's probably taken a crap right now somewhere in California, but he's going to get off the

[07:03] crapper and he's going to get a text message from a friend that's going to share this

[07:07] link and then he's going to go over to his little desk and be like, oh my god, angry

[07:12] white pinball fan on the internet right now screaming to other angry white pinball collectors.

[07:19] So look, that will happen and we will read that later today.

[07:23] Okay, but here's the deal from a business standpoint.

[07:28] If I'm thinking about this through Stern's lens, who are they making this game for?

[07:33] It's clear that they're making this game primarily for the Beatles collector.

[07:39] All right, and I've said this before, does a Beatles collector want an expensive pinball

[07:44] machine?

[07:45] We don't know.

[07:46] You know how we don't know this and you know why we don't know this because there's

[07:50] never been another Beatles pinball machine for them ever to collect.

[07:54] There's never been something like this ever that has been labeled as Beatles memorabilia

[08:01] as something you should collect.

[08:03] But that is Stern's approach here.

[08:05] Now look, the Supreme people gobbled it up because those guys are crazy and gobbled everything

[08:10] up.

[08:11] People this work with the Beatles collector fan base.

[08:15] All right, so you have to push to the side all the moaning and groaning on pinside and

[08:21] all the pinball people who are upset right now because here's the deal.

[08:25] Let me just break it down for you guys.

[08:26] I almost want to do a little Tony Montagne chick goes apple who owns the Beatles rights.

[08:33] I think they do right.

[08:34] I don't know.

[08:35] Maybe the music they do.

[08:37] The Beatles fan base for the most part, the millions and millions and millions of Beatles

[08:43] fans around the world.

[08:45] They don't even know or give a shit about pinside.

[08:49] So they haven't even seen this thing yet.

[08:51] Like you think it's revealed to the world.

[08:52] It's not revealed to the world.

[08:54] It's revealed to 50 angry dudes on pinside for the most part.

[08:58] Okay.

[08:59] There is a tendency to live in that vacuum and think that the sky is falling.

[09:03] But Stern also doesn't give a shit what you guys on pinside say.

[09:05] And from a business standpoint, this is solely targeted at Beatles fans who collect

[09:12] Beatles memorabilia.

[09:14] All right.

[09:15] Now, now, let's stop there and just say for a minute, like does that make sense?

[09:21] Like does it make sense for Stern pinball to make a game that isn't geared towards the

[09:28] die hard pinball tournament player or the die hard pinball collector, but is geared at

[09:33] another collector base.

[09:35] And the medium is pinball.

[09:38] Okay.

[09:39] I was trying to think of a metaphor or an example.

[09:41] It's kind of like movies.

[09:43] All right.

[09:45] So let's look at it like this.

[09:47] So movies is a medium.

[09:49] Pinball is a medium.

[09:51] Video games are a medium.

[09:54] Okay.

[09:55] Now for the most part, we've lived in the pinball world in a very myopic way.

[10:01] All right.

[10:02] What I mean is that pinball machines primarily always follow the same strategy with every single

[10:11] game we got.

[10:12] It was either a movie property, a music property, like a popular TV show or an original theme

[10:21] that was like wonky and weird, but like really translated well into pinball.

[10:27] We've never, ever, ever had pinball machines created from the ground up to be seen as collectibles

[10:36] to certain communities, right?

[10:39] And I'm not sure it's going to work.

[10:42] Okay.

[10:43] That's what they're trying to do.

[10:45] It worked with Supreme, but I don't think it's going to work here.

[10:52] And let me explain why because I think that for this to work, and it worked a little

[11:00] bit with Batman, but I've also said Batman, you got more of a pinball experience and you're

[11:05] definitely going to get with this game.

[11:09] But the reason why I don't think it's going to work is I don't think people that collect

[11:14] memorabilia or collectible items are going to run and buy something like a pinball machine.

[11:23] Okay.

[11:24] And let me explain why.

[11:26] First, first, a pinball machine is not like buying a piece of artwork that comes in a box

[11:34] arrives at your house and you can put a nail in the wall and hang it.

[11:38] And it's something pretty to look at, but it doesn't take up a lot of room.

[11:43] The sheer size of a pinball machine eliminates a lot of people's desires to deal with them,

[11:51] to put them in their homes, to put them in their houses.

[11:55] Even if you have a collection of stuff, it really limits the amount of people that are

[12:00] going to buy something that is that goddamn large.

[12:03] Okay.

[12:04] There's also a lot of households around the world where even if you have money, if you

[12:10] told the woman or the man who's a partner of a man, you know, we love all people on this

[12:16] show, if you told them that you're going to bring a pinball machine into the house, they

[12:21] be like no fucking way.

[12:23] All right.

[12:24] I know.

[12:25] I know it seems hard for a lot of you guys.

[12:26] Again, I'm pin-side because you're used to having friends who have pinball collections,

[12:31] but 99% of the earth doesn't have pinball collections or have pinball machines in their

[12:36] homes.

[12:37] I'm not sold that people that want to just gobble up anything beetles will gobble up this

[12:43] game and will really want this game and will consider this to be something that is sought

[12:49] after and rare.

[12:50] All right.

[12:51] Right.

[12:52] And so because we're not seeing anybody, anybody right now who's a pinball collector even

[12:59] want to collect it.

[13:00] And that's the challenge here with Stern and their partnership with Joe Kamikau is I

[13:06] think they're definitely chartering new orders here and they're trying to explore whether

[13:13] or not there is a market for this.

[13:15] See, I'm trying to remove just the emotions around the game that I know you guys are feeling.

[13:19] I don't feel any real emotional extremes around this product, right?

[13:24] And here's why.

[13:25] I don't really like the beetles.

[13:27] So I don't care.

[13:28] Like this, I'm almost happy when new pinball comes out that I don't want to buy because

[13:33] it means I can save money.

[13:35] It means I don't feel the urge to make other sacrifices to get that pinball machine.

[13:41] For me, the most, and maybe some of you relate to this, the most stressed out I ever get is

[13:47] when I see a machine that I absolutely want to have.

[13:52] But for some reason, I know I shouldn't buy it, but I can't stop thinking about it when

[13:57] I go to bed.

[13:58] I can't stop thinking about it when I'm at work.

[14:00] I can't stop thinking about it until I find a way to get one.

[14:05] And I've had that happen a few times in this hobby.

[14:07] And it's exciting, right, to get that addiction to a machine that you just want, the excitement

[14:12] of getting it, opening it, playing it.

[14:14] I feel nothing like that for the beetles.

[14:18] So when I see this, I'm able to almost talk about it without getting into some crazy

[14:24] emotional extreme state.

[14:26] And I think some of you guys out there understand what I'm talking about.

[14:31] So I think it's going to fail from a business standpoint.

[14:33] I really do.

[14:34] I don't think you're going to find beetles people just gobbling up those 100 diamond additions.

[14:43] Here's how they're going to release it.

[14:45] There's 100.

[14:46] And this is how the verbiages on the beetles store, only 100 diamond addition games, only

[14:54] 250 platinum addition games, only 1,614 gold addition games, and only 1,964 games in total.

[15:09] The word only is in front of all of those numbers, which is stupid.

[15:14] Like that is just bad marketing.

[15:17] It's kind of childish marketing.

[15:19] It's amateur hour marketing.

[15:21] All right.

[15:22] This 1,614 only.

[15:25] I mean, here's what I think annoys most of you.

[15:28] And I agree with this.

[15:29] This reeks a little bit, a lot of bit.

[15:34] This reeks really bad of arrogance from Stern Pimbal.

[15:39] Like total arrogance in the way they market this stuff.

[15:43] Like they really think none of their shit stinks.

[15:48] And you kind of get that feeling a little bit.

[15:50] Like they just think, yeah, we're going to do this.

[15:53] And it's going to sell.

[15:54] And it's going to sell out.

[15:55] And we're going to make this.

[15:56] And we're going to make that.

[15:57] And we're going to make all these arbitrary collectible versions of it.

[16:00] And it's just always going to work.

[16:02] And you don't want it.

[16:03] You can't blame them for having some of that arrogance because you know where that arrogance

[16:07] comes from?

[16:08] It comes from us.

[16:10] It comes from the Pimbal buyer who shoves money into Stern's pocket regardless if they

[16:17] deserve it.

[16:19] You know, you become the shit when people keep telling you you're the shit.

[16:25] And then you think your shit don't stink when people keep reminding you that you are

[16:30] the shit.

[16:31] How many different ways that are you shit in different meetings there?

[16:34] But you know what I'm saying?

[16:36] All the years that all of you ran and bought Stern machines for way more money than you

[16:42] knew they were worth.

[16:44] You guys all jumped into Stern's like you know you jumped into their world and you bought

[16:52] all those LEDs when there was not anything worth it.

[16:57] And you inflated this company to thinking they could get away with almost anything.

[17:04] And here's the thing.

[17:05] They've never to this point been proven wrong that they can't get away with it.

[17:11] You know, look at Batman 66.

[17:13] They got away with it.

[17:15] Look at the Beatles.

[17:16] Will they get away with it?

[17:17] I don't think they do though here.

[17:18] I think this is where they learn a little bit of a lesson and they have a hard time selling

[17:26] these games in 2018 knowing that it's just a re-skin of sea witch.

[17:33] But here's what we don't know.

[17:35] And this is the big like you know variable that could change everything.

[17:42] This could change these games selling in great numbers or struggling to sell at all and

[17:49] even possibly selling out some of these limited editions.

[17:52] We don't know the price.

[17:54] So if those 100 diamond edition games you know if they're not 35,000 or $50,000 you know

[18:01] if they're priced reasonably and they platinum edition LEDs at 250 are priced reasonably

[18:10] then I think you're absolutely going to see people like pick up this game.

[18:15] Because it's only the fear that this is going to be a fleecing of you that keeps a lot

[18:21] of people complaining right now.

[18:23] But if Stern were to say you know $12,000 for the diamond, you know $9,000 for the platinum

[18:31] and then $7,500 for the gold does your tune change on this game?

[18:36] Do you now look at it differently?

[18:39] Alright so we're going to see.

[18:42] We're going to see there's a lot of anger.

[18:43] So let me also talk about the way the game looks.

[18:46] Because I know a lot of you out there freaking out about the actual art package and design

[18:53] of this game.

[18:54] And let me say this.

[18:56] I have spoken to people today just a few minutes ago who have seen this game in person.

[19:03] And I've talked to people who have stood over the game and they have said to me Chris,

[19:10] that video does not do this game justice at all.

[19:15] That it is not a great video.

[19:16] The colors are not coming through the way they do in real life.

[19:20] Wait till you see it in person.

[19:22] Okay so there's that.

[19:24] I think we often get poor assets on these new games and we often overreact to the way

[19:33] a game looks before we've actually stood over it ourselves and been the judge with our

[19:38] own eyes.

[19:39] Alright so there's that part of it.

[19:42] You know look the game's Christopher Ranchy artwork.

[19:45] I think he's done a really good job in creating you know the look and style and feel of the

[19:52] Beatles of this era.

[19:53] Now like like correct me from wrong people.

[19:56] But I know we had like the black and white television appearance of the Beatles.

[20:01] But the color from the 1960s that is that was happening in the real world wasn't it very

[20:08] colorful like this like kind of Austin Powers e. Colors.

[20:11] Like isn't that what the Beatles colors were unless you were watching it through a black

[20:17] and white TV.

[20:19] So I'm kind of confused as to people's you know reaction to the colors of the game.

[20:25] I think they look I actually like them.

[20:28] I don't have a problem with that.

[20:31] So you know get over it get over it.

[20:35] There also is an LCD in the game.

[20:38] Okay so there is an LCD in the game.

[20:41] One of the last captions from the YouTube video or frames the one where it says it won't

[20:45] be long.

[20:46] That is from the LCD.

[20:48] So that's going to give you a sense of what the animations are like in the game.

[20:52] In terms of differences between see which and Beatles there's a magnet at the top of

[20:59] the play field that catches the ball and drops it into the pops.

[21:02] There's a spinning disc with a magnet.

[21:05] There's a mystery reward stand up on the lower left next to the three bank of drops.

[21:12] There's a super jack pot stand up on the lower left behind the three bank of drops.

[21:17] There's a skinny stand up near the loops entrance.

[21:21] There's one additional spinner on the left and a few mode inserts including two ball

[21:26] multi ball and some spinner loop drops scoring modes that are on the game.

[21:30] So those are differences from see which.

[21:31] Okay.

[21:32] All right.

[21:33] Wow.

[21:34] What a day.

[21:36] Let's talk about why this game wasn't at expo.

[21:42] The first thing I thought of when I got the link and saw this was what the F's turn.

[21:49] You literally three days after expo are revealing a game and I got kind of like pissed off

[21:57] at first.

[21:58] At first I was like this is my first reaction.

[22:02] God damn if I was on pinsoid this would have been what I would have typed.

[22:05] God damn stern.

[22:07] Once again doesn't give a shit about the very people that keep that company in existence.

[22:12] Pimbal expo wasn't Chicago in their backyard.

[22:15] This game was ready to show and they didn't freaking show it.

[22:18] They literally could not show it.

[22:21] They have to wait three days and then now they give us a video and they totally, totally

[22:26] like snubbed the pinball world.

[22:28] And then I'm like well if you think about it again if this game is not targeted for you

[22:35] it's targeted for beetle mania.

[22:37] Why would they reveal it at pinball expo?

[22:41] And so what I heard the plan is the plan is something along the lines of they want to reveal

[22:46] it for the first time ever at either of two places at either the rock and roll hall of

[22:53] fame or in New York City.

[22:57] Alright so that is what I'm hearing is going to be the first place they pull the curtain

[23:01] off and let people flip it.

[23:03] Right this is going to be like Jack danger comes over and plays it for the first time.

[23:08] They don't give a shit about marketing this to you guys on pinsoid.

[23:14] And I know that kind of hurts.

[23:15] I know it kind of stings and the analogy I was going to use earlier.

[23:20] It's like imagine if Stern is a pinball company and imagine if they were like a movie company

[23:26] you know and their medium is movie like their mediums pinball does every single movie that

[23:33] let's say new line cinema makes does every single movie they make have to appeal to people

[23:40] who love like action films right or like comedies or like superhero movies.

[23:50] Now the thing is this I don't know if that's a good analogy but my point being is this does

[23:53] every single pinball machine that Stern makes have to be of appeal to the die hard pinball

[24:00] people are they not allowed to make a pinball machine that isn't targeted towards the die

[24:08] hard pinball person.

[24:10] And I think this machine is that and you can either accept it for what it is or you can

[24:18] complain about it but here's the good news nobody has to fucking buy it.

[24:24] You don't have to buy it I don't have to buy it what's the point of going on pinsoid

[24:30] and crying about something that isn't even made for the people on pinsoid.

[24:37] And if you're a Beatles fan yeah you're gonna be bummed out that maybe your theme didn't

[24:43] get the completely new like homage to the band like design from the ground up pinball

[24:50] experience you're not gonna get it ever but here's the other thing deal with it what

[24:55] are you gonna do we could cry about it forever but they're not gonna change this game it

[25:00] is what it is.

[25:02] Again I kind of am a little cavalier about this whole thing because I don't care about

[25:05] the Beatles I just don't I don't share your pain if you're a huge Beatles fan and this

[25:11] meant a lot to you and now you're pissed off email me at canada pinballgmail.com and come

[25:16] on the show and tell me why this is such a painful thing to go through in life alright I would

[25:20] love to hear about how this is killing you.

[25:23] Here's what I think is gonna happen and this always happens I think people are gonna

[25:28] moan and groan about this game and I think they're gonna see better images I think they're

[25:33] gonna see the full package I think they're gonna realize that see which still shoots

[25:37] great and I think people are gonna like turn the corner on this pin not from wanting to

[25:43] not from like hating it to wanting to own it but I think they're gonna start to understand

[25:48] what the reason of this machine is I also think that this timing is simply now so that

[25:58] they can get this out the door because they you know they would probably want to sell

[26:01] these to Beatles fans you know I was like a holiday gift imagine if I'm stern marketing

[26:08] and I would want to get this kind of item in the Neiman Marcus holiday gift guide for

[26:14] the ultimate Beatles fan out there now you can get them the only Beatles machine ever

[26:21] made in pinball form but act fast because we only have 100 that they're gonna make in

[26:28] the diamond edition and 250 in the you know the platinum edition so act now and get this

[26:36] game you know for I think that's their strategy get this out before the holidays get it to

[26:41] the collectors who have tons of money and move on and if anyone wants one down the road

[26:46] will make you one of the gold editions but they're not gonna make 1614 right away they'll

[26:51] make them you know they'll make them in batches as they're ordered yeah again like I they're

[26:56] not gonna sell on 1914 out immediately the other reason they're doing this right now is

[27:02] that the monsters is right around the corner and if you haven't you know heard the monsters

[27:09] is the greatest stern pinball machine of all time the stern height machine it never ceases

[27:15] to amaze me I'm already hearing about it from my friends in this hobby everyone is sending

[27:20] me what they've heard people have played it it's Borg's best I've heard from people at

[27:26] stern I've heard from people have played the game and all I keep hearing is the same thing

[27:30] I always hear the games incredible it's the greatest game ever like you definitely need to

[27:35] get one like our LEDs are gonna sell out like it's the same shit every single game and

[27:41] like I'm sure monsters is gonna be cool as fuck I heard that monsters is gonna be the sexiest

[27:47] looking stern pinball machine ever that even the stern people were blown away by how nice

[27:54] it looks and that the LEDs are gonna sell out because of that okay you hear it now go run

[27:59] and go go put your name down on list and go make up your mind and buy it but look look it's

[28:05] the same story over and over again we've been down this road a million times my advice

[28:11] to all of you is what's the point of getting so upset about a game you don't even want right what

[28:19] is the point like I think Jersey Jack fucked up pirates of the Caribbean I don't really want

[28:24] pirates of the Caribbean I'm not really that upset I'm not gonna spend my days going into the thread

[28:29] and like shitting on it I've been following pinside my my friend rare hero Mr. Greg over there

[28:36] in California the man loves his habit he loves his habit he's having a good time with it and I

[28:42] can't understand why when he says that to people everyone keeps responding that he's an idiot at the

[28:49] game sucks and they're like it's like what is wrong with us really like what is wrong with us on

[28:56] some level you can have an opinion of the game but if someone else likes the game that doesn't make

[29:04] that person an idiot okay it just doesn't you know you can still say the game sucks but that person

[29:13] doesn't suck because they like something you don't and there's just so much of that on pin

[29:18] side so that is the deal with the Beatles again we're gonna see more of it we're gonna see better

[29:26] assets of it I think it's going to miss the mark I do think that Stern and Joe are shooting too

[29:33] high with this one and maybe they know something about the Beatles collectors that I don't and

[29:41] and and they probably do because I don't know much about anyone that would just have to have this

[29:47] you know it's just weird to me it's like if you collect Rolex watches right you're a Rolex

[29:51] collector like you're a Beatles collector okay and then Stern makes a Rolex pinball machine

[29:59] does a Rolex collector want to buy it like do they feel like they need to have it I don't know

[30:07] what if Rolex made a timepiece just for the pinball machine you know like the clock in Twilight

[30:15] zone would you then need to have it because it's they only made 250 of these watches that are found

[30:20] inside a pinball machine I don't know all I know is this the world of collecting anything is

[30:27] fucking stupid like it literally is like collections as much as they're fun and we like to brag

[30:34] about them they're fucking pointless for the most part they bring out the worst in people they get

[30:40] you obsessed they they get you to like spend money on things that don't really bring much long

[30:45] term happiness they get you addicted to forms where you spend way too much time going back and forth

[30:53] discussing things that aren't making you any smarter in fact this stuff makes you much

[30:58] dumber to spend all day long debating Beatles pinball like you just got dumber today because of

[31:07] of your focus on it it's exciting to think of you know what's next it's exciting to see new games

[31:14] you know I always find it to be just more fun to follow the hobby than to financially chase the

[31:21] right and the only time I financially chase the hobby is when I'm flipping pins and I'm making money

[31:26] and then it's fun too but again like once you give up the urge to need to own every new pinball

[31:33] machine out there it becomes a lot more fun and you're able to see things like the Beatles release

[31:40] much more objectively and not get so bent out of shape and have a fucking meltdown about it like

[31:47] like let me let me remind all of you that 99.9% of planet earth does not give two shits about the

[31:55] Beatles pinball they never will they don't even know it's coming out they'll never even see it ever

[32:00] all right all right let's go to some of your mail because I've been receiving a lot of emails from

[32:06] my fans all around the world and I want to make sure I call you guys out on the air and I give

[32:13] you some airtime all right so first I want to call out Scott Drager Scott thanks for listening he said

[32:20] hi canada deep route definitely seems like a well run challenger most likely I will freeze my

[32:26] new inbox money to see what they pop out at tpf I was looking at pirates of the Caribbean but it

[32:31] might take a while to get delivered all right Scott so here's the deal I know we talked a lot about

[32:37] deep route on the last podcast and I think it's way too early to say something like deep route is

[32:43] a well run challenger and I've got a lot of people have responded to the deep route seminar after

[32:48] my last podcast and people have reminded me that you know what Chris like you're missing one

[32:56] very very important thing is that these people are all paid and they're paid well and they're going

[33:02] to say whatever they think they have to say in front of their boss and so I don't know what to

[33:10] expect I hope they deliver what they say they're going to deliver Scott but you know look freezing

[33:15] your money I just think it's a good thing to do in general I just think there's so many games coming

[33:19] out that it makes sense to just wait and see where all of these new games where they all net out

[33:26] all right I got an email from Steve Paradis he said um October fest and the pinball bubble

[33:32] said canada listening to episode 272 October fest looks really fun can't wait to play it

[33:40] hopefully my local pinball bar gets so we can play it drunk I don't feel the need to line up to buy

[33:47] it though let's talk about the pinball bubble anyone who knows economics and history knows great

[33:53] economies never last and recessions or depressions will always come back I love what is going on

[33:59] right now with pinball it seems manufacturers are starting to figure it out and there should be

[34:05] some of the greatest pinball ever over the next few years what do you think will happen to all the

[34:11] manufacturers when the economy tanks again really I think it is a good discussion you did touch on

[34:19] it before how many of the pinball manufacturers can afford to have a game completely fail to

[34:23] meet minimum sales requirements or what if two or three games in a row lose money um who would be left

[34:30] all right well Steve thank you for the question um what if two or three games in a row lose money

[34:35] you mean Jersey Jack pinball um but how does an economy here's the thing with pinball and economies

[34:41] we always predict that the pinball hobby will suffer when the economy of the world suffers

[34:49] and there has been nothing ever to indicate that it is sort of strange but the pinball hobby

[34:57] continues um to truck through is truck even a word continues to truck through um even when we

[35:05] go through recessions and I think the last one of 2008 was was proof you know look it was tough

[35:10] man stern made it through but the use pin market and pin prices then they didn't collapse and I

[35:18] think everyone thinks that if the economy dips um there's going to be a collapse in pinball prices

[35:26] and these companies new orders are going to dry up and they're going to go out of business now look

[35:31] but I think there is a big difference now from 2008 and here's the huge difference in 2008

[35:40] you only had stern pinball there was nobody else making pinball games stern pinball was the only

[35:49] company making new pins they weren't making as many pins as they make now and there weren't all

[35:55] these other games and also during that error you know most of like you know most of the stern didn't

[36:03] have as many good games either and I feel like I'm going to get shit for saying that but but you

[36:09] know you had this error like you had stern making new games but a lot of people considered stern

[36:13] games to be you know kind of mediocre if not shitty lord of the rings was great but for the most

[36:18] part stern games were a far cry from the value Williams games and the people back then were either

[36:26] buying up like value Williams games restoring them they were getting pinballs for decent prices

[36:33] and you could really be in the hobby not spend a fortune remember stern's back then were

[36:38] thirty five hundred dollars four thousand dollars you know nowadays a ten years later

[36:45] you know games are just gone up in price because it's no longer you know stern pros anymore

[36:49] one edition of a game like there was just one edition of lord of the rings when it came out there

[36:53] wasn't many editions they they did a a limited edition after the fact like four years later

[37:00] but in 2004 there was just one game you know the new model with all these new games and new games

[37:06] with high prices I do think if we go through a dip now with the amount of new titles out there

[37:14] new manufacturers I do think you're going to see this this the bubble burst a little bit you're

[37:19] going to have to and you're going to see companies go away you're going to see orders dry up

[37:24] and I think you're just going to see people now say you know what like I'm good with my collection

[37:28] I don't need to buy more I'm okay like you know there's going to be that like the the middle class

[37:37] of pinball collector is the most important one it's not the high end collector it's the guy that

[37:42] you know can can get enough saved up to buy a premium or buy a pro that's what keeps these companies

[37:48] in business it's not the nine thousand dollar ten thousand dollar machines so I think a company

[37:53] like Jersey Jack would suffer tremendously you know the higher price pin guys are going to be the

[37:59] ones that struggle to find sales all right but we'll see I hope the economy keeps going strong though

[38:04] I don't want to crash because then we're all going to be a little sadder if that happens all right

[38:10] so I got an email from Tim Leonard he his subject was spot on October Fest review and hobby advice

[38:16] he says hi Chris just wanted to let you know that I thought your initial review of October Fest

[38:22] was pretty much spot on unlike you I'm a fan of this theme and I love Houdini but I have to

[38:28] agree that based on the pictures and the videos so far American pinball needs to address numerous

[38:34] issues with the game's art package and callouts that said though I'm confident that they will

[38:39] refine certain aspects of it at least this was just the game's first reveal after all and they

[38:46] have already stated that various additions improvements are in the works just a question of how

[38:52] much we shall see mod creators can fix certain things too if need be like the auto head all right I

[38:59] also wish to thank you for your consistent common sense advice for addicted pinnets such as myself

[39:04] much of it such as I keep such as keeping the hobby and perspective within your life and focusing

[39:09] on enjoying the games you already have rather than obsessing over your next new box purchase fix

[39:14] has hit home with me and I'm working to improve my mindset accordingly keep up the great podcast

[39:21] I appreciate your honest perspective on the business as well as the hobby of pinball all right

[39:25] well thank you so much for that Tim I really appreciate it and look there's work to be done on

[39:32] October Fest we all know it how much they will change we shall see look I was supposed to have

[39:39] is it normal come on the show he's the sales and marketing guy of American pinball

[39:44] he said he would come on the show after expo I think it'd be a good idea for him to come on the

[39:49] show sooner than later then he texted me that said it could be a few weeks so I look I told him

[39:57] would you just answer a few questions he said he would so email them some questions about the

[40:01] game I also told him 1500 people that are potential buyers of his game they listen to the show

[40:08] and I think it's always beneficial to people who make these games to talk about the games and I

[40:14] think it only creates positive energies and vibes around this show you will never find an interview

[40:22] on this show that I've ever done in like the two or three years I've been doing this show

[40:25] there's never been an interview where the person I talked to doesn't help sell in the thing

[40:31] they've worked on right like even you know Jerry makes p3 seem more attractive when I talked to him

[40:37] franche talks about his art yet he talked about his art you know everyone's always come on this show

[40:43] and and create it excitement for their projects and that is why I think it's silly that you know

[40:50] guys like eric at jersey jack one come on like stern now blacklist me cool like don't come on like

[40:56] literally just create less excitement for your projects by avoiding canators pinball podcasts and

[41:01] the reason why people don't avoid listening to this show is we keep it fucking honest like we we

[41:07] were honest on this show you know start about happy everything I just said about the Beatles

[41:12] and you're not going to hear most pinball podcasts say that about the Beatles all right all right so I

[41:16] got an email from another like Scott you email me a lot Scott Drager just said one time waiting

[41:22] is the right answer I don't okay Scott I'm going to read this on the next one I want to give

[41:25] someone else some air time so I got an email from let's see blade split Chris if deep root has the

[41:33] balls to change the very way the industry has been operating right on day one concerning titles I

[41:40] applaud them the idea of seeing multiple games at launch to me is awesome idea and it kick in the

[41:48] ass to everyone else in the market they are trying something aggressive and it's great I think it's

[41:54] brilliant say there's four games at launch if you're not a fan of title three or sorry if you're

[42:01] not a fan of a title there's three more to consider at the same time you will most likely have

[42:07] customers interested at some level in one or all of them if they can produce them in timely manner

[42:15] and you can buy one of four machines or even crazier four of four machines that's amazing is that

[42:22] quad manufacturing four games at once say they sold cars you could go to Stern and you could look

[42:29] at and buy one brand new car with them or you can go across the street to deep root and see four

[42:35] new cars and buy anyone of the four I think it's aggressive and forward thinking how many guys just

[42:43] buy the new Stern because it's new I know a few every three to four months they buy the new Stern

[42:48] deep root if successful has the potential to change the hobby and sell a lot of games all right well

[42:54] here's the thing this is from Jay Jay look let's let's all come back down to reality here all right

[43:03] first of all Jay the analogy of a car dealership is a good one and there's one car dealership if we

[43:11] compare them the pinball where you can go in and buy about eight brand new games new inbox and that

[43:18] is Stern all right don't don't think that Stern is you know look let's stay in the car you

[43:26] meant and I think you're right there is not a car company out there that releases four cars four

[43:33] different cars four different models in one day it's it's marketing suicide it's you can't

[43:40] mobilize your own market everybody knows that does Apple release four new products on one day at

[43:46] the exact same time no maybe it's a watch and a phone but those kind of go together they're paired

[43:51] but it would be like Apple launching on the same day you know a new phone a new speaker a new watch

[43:59] a new this a new TV all on the same day right now look I think what you're trying to say it's more like

[44:05] video games where when Xbox comes out on day one it's better to have four launch titles than one

[44:13] but launch titles of video games are 50 bucks and people can easily afford to buy all four

[44:19] people are not going to buy four pinball machines on day one at once not going to happen ever

[44:26] it makes it doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense it sounds amazing it sounds bold it sounds

[44:32] brazen but when you stop and actually analyze that that you're going to release four games at once

[44:39] in the pinball industry doesn't that seem stupid doesn't it just seem like you're cannibalizing

[44:45] your own market and the potential to sell each of those individually and create the same type of

[44:53] hype that Stern does because here's the thing Stern could easily you know not release games every

[45:00] three to four months and just hold off and just release them all every October right you know

[45:07] the way like video games all the big titles come out during the end of the year you know because

[45:10] people are getting ready for the holidays or spending their money they're buying councils

[45:15] Stern could do that but it makes no sense because you're right they do want to sell you every new

[45:21] Stern they do want people to you know jump into the hype buy it and then play it for three four

[45:28] months get a little board get the itch again and get the next one you know if you if you launch

[45:33] for it once you're just not going to get that and I think it's a big mistake and I hope that

[45:37] Robert kind of re thinks that strategy now he might show four games but only make one or two

[45:43] available but we'll see what happens man there's just a lot of mystery surrounding and all but

[45:49] I just would not launch a lot of games at one time all right I got an email oh man about American

[45:57] pinball from Ian this is a long email so I'm going to try and paraphrase can they to love the

[46:02] podcast especially the quick 30-minute stuff great stuff I work in sales and marketing as well

[46:08] and I love that approach anyway my one critique is this I don't think you are being overly critical

[46:14] about about American pinball however you are missing a very important part of why they steal more

[46:20] market share in the in the near future from Stern than any other pinball company and the reason

[46:24] is price American pinball hits the sweet spot Stern sells primarily 5k machines on the other

[46:31] side JJP sells 10k machines AP hits them right in the middle with a great price point $7,000 why

[46:39] pay $7,000 when you can pay 5,000 for a new in box Stern well I argue that AP sells JJP level

[46:47] pinball mechs toys ramps wire forms you get a full world under glass for less than any JJP

[46:53] game new in box okay he then says you can say that that isn't spooky doing the same thing

[46:59] well yeah they are but they don't have the manufacturing that AP has trust me in 5 years and

[47:04] deep route finally irons out all the manufacturing woes AP will be in great position to release

[47:09] multiple games a year with full play fields at that price all right all right here's the thing

[47:16] I just want to stop there I want to talk about American pinball and do I feel like they're at

[47:21] the sweet spot of the pinball world because they have games around $7,000 and I have to say first

[47:27] of all in thank you so much for listening to the podcast I hope you don't stop listening when

[47:33] I tell you I think you're 100% wrong I don't think American pinball is is sort of in a great

[47:39] position because of price in fact their games are the same price as a Stern premium now everybody

[47:47] knows that the only Stern you ever need to buy if you want all the bells and whistles is the

[47:52] premium right the premium has everything that the Ellie has except for the overpriced artwork

[47:58] and vanity stuff that does nothing for the pinball experience so then you have basically a a head-to-head

[48:08] battle against October fest and Munster's premium a head-to-head battle against October fest

[48:14] and Deadpool premium a head-to-head battle of Iron Maiden versus October fest premium a head-to-head

[48:21] battle between you know you go on and on and on and then you realize like well they can't really

[48:28] compete with theme on any level now I do agree that American pinball puts way more into their games

[48:35] than Stern does way more okay but here's the problem the problem with American pinball isn't the

[48:43] fact that it's jam-packed with stuff the problem with American pinball is their execution of that

[48:49] stuff is still very amateur hour and because of that their pins still look and feel very amateur

[49:02] next to a Stern pinball machine you know that it's hard to get over the you know the amateur nature

[49:07] of the callouts the amateur way in which they arrange the artwork the amateur animations of the

[49:13] game so the sum of the parts just feels much more home brew and amateur than Stern pinball whereas

[49:21] at Stern pinball right now they're really hitting a stride with making the most beautiful games

[49:26] having the best you know sort of LCD integration next to J.J.P. I know but you know like they

[49:33] their stuff just feels way more polished than American pinball and so that leads me to feel like

[49:40] American pinball's buyer base is super tiny now here's the real issue for American pinball buyers

[49:47] let's say that October fest is $7,700 seems like a great price right okay and you say J.J.J.J.

[49:55] Jack games are 10,000 but the problem now I don't think people look at this as I must have a

[50:02] new inbox game my first pinball machine wasn't new in box my first pinball machine was a used

[50:07] Lord the Rings L.E. my second pinball machine was a used game my third one was as well you know so

[50:14] it's like if I want to buy the best pinball I can buy for $7,500 do you land on October Fest

[50:22] you can go get right now for $7,500 a dialed in L.E. you can go get a hobbit for $6,000 you can

[50:32] go get a Wizard of Oz for $7,000 see that's the problem with American pinball right now and as you

[50:39] see people selling their Houdini's for $6,000 now you literally can't look at this hobby as only

[50:47] being new in box you have to look at it and say are we making something that people have to have

[50:57] and if you're not you know how do we make that because I think people are just going to go buy

[51:03] what they feel like they have to have regardless if it's new in box or not and I think that's why

[51:07] AP will will struggle is even though their stuff looks like a bargain in a vacuum when you zoom out

[51:15] I would still rather go get a dialed in over in October Fest if I want it like an original theme

[51:21] but but man Ian thank you for the email I truly appreciate guys when you email me try not to make

[51:27] it too too long because it's hard for me to read I got an email from RC around deep thoughts

[51:33] it's all about the money all these guys working for deeproot are probably being paid more money than

[51:38] they've ever made in their life they're going to say whatever they think Robert will be happy to

[51:43] hear also I think Robert has the ability to set a production in Mexico then he has a shot at

[51:49] making less expensive machines since they are very labor intensive the difference between deeproot

[51:54] and all the other failed pimble ventures is deep pockets Robert does not seem to be concerned

[51:59] about making a profit so for him this is a passion project and just a big write off this is play

[52:06] money for him just like guys that spend millions on race cars doon buggies and boats keep on trucking

[52:14] um yeah I mean I don't know I don't know that I don't know if Robert is using his own money or

[52:19] investor dollars to do this I don't think he's approaching this like a big write off I think they're

[52:24] actually trying to do something but I think you know he's going to learn about the hurdles to

[52:30] manufacturing when they get there I'm not sure if they're there yet but I think it's like we're all

[52:35] curious to see how this all that's out I keep telling people it's just going to be the best tpf ever

[52:42] I got a new patreon supporter in cam k a a m and cam I just want to thank you so much

[52:52] for donating to canators pinball podcasts I truly appreciate it I really it really really

[52:59] means a lot to me and I got an email from him and okay so I guess cam it was his patreon

[53:05] name his name is john and I want to just say thank you to john and I want to call john out on this

[53:11] show um because it's one thing to listen to this show and appreciate it it's another thing to

[53:19] actually show some support and financially show some support for the show and just back the show

[53:25] a little bit and again like I can't say how thankful I am for people who will donate to the show

[53:33] because everyone who does this the amount of time we put into these shows whether it's me whether

[53:38] it's Ryan and Marty whether it's like special one lit you know whether it's um you know straight

[53:44] down the middle guys whether it's Jeff at at this week in pinball a lot of our time goes into this

[53:49] and it's nice to see you know and get some support um for what we do so he says hi Chris I found

[53:56] your podcast and I glad I did I binge your last six episodes over the weekend and enjoyed listening

[54:02] to your news insights and opinions you clearly put a lot of thought and time into this hobby and I

[54:07] want you to know I appreciate it I signed up to support you on patreon and for those of you who

[54:13] don't know um if you go to patreon which is p-a-t-r-e-o-n um and search for canators pinball you'll find

[54:22] it and it's really easy and even just like a dollar pledge a month that's only 12 bucks a year

[54:28] all right 12 bucks a year you could show support for canators pinball podcasts and I'd be happy

[54:33] and you got to admit that this show gives you guys at least $12 worth of entertainment a year

[54:40] right 60 bucks worth come on you guys buy like nine thousand dollar pinball machines on a win

[54:45] without even playing it and this is more entertaining for most of you I know it is I know it is

[54:50] he goes on the say I'm out here in Tacoma Washington and been thinking about buying a pinball

[54:56] machine for my game room for a while but for many of the reasons you've recently discussed

[55:01] haven't dropped the coin just yet right now I play all the new and some older pinball games at our

[55:07] local arcades a couple times a week and like the variety of games my favorite layout right now is

[55:13] iron maiden but I hate heavy metal like I hate my dogs vomit so I would never buy it my second

[55:19] favorite is Star Wars premium I love the theme at first I did not like Star Wars machine but I have

[55:25] grown to really enjoy it I'm waiting to see the upcoming games as I don't plan to buy more than one

[55:31] if I buy one at all when I mention to my wife that we have a perfect spot for one pinball

[55:37] machine in our game room she silently looked at me which means that if the time comes I will need

[55:44] to justify the expense and that could be a bit of a sell first of all John when it comes to wives

[55:54] there is no perfect spot in a house for a pinball machine okay just you have to learn that

[56:00] he says as a small business owner I like your focus on the business aspects of the pinball world

[56:05] as well as the commentary about the games themselves I look forward to continue listening John

[56:10] thank you so much I literally I've been doing this for a long long time and every time there is a

[56:16] new listener to the show and every time someone writes me a a message about how they enjoy the show

[56:23] how they enjoy the hobby and what their favorite games are I truly truly appreciate it because as

[56:28] we all know it's the people that make this hobby interesting not the pinball machines that's the

[56:33] dirty little secret of the pinball hobby the people make it exciting the games are just games I look

[56:41] I think it's a great time to wait as I said John I think also John you're gonna learn what I learned

[56:47] is that when you have access to bars that have a lot of good pinball machines you will go you will

[56:54] have a beer too you'll play your games you'll have your fun and then you'll go home and you'll

[56:59] not feel the urge to own it it literally is this crazy thing you literally it gets out of your

[57:05] system and I think that the the real frenzy happens more online and when you're constantly talking

[57:13] to people all day long on Facebook and social media about pinball that's where the frenzy occurs

[57:19] but I guarantee you we're gonna say the same thing with like monsters the frenzy to own it but if

[57:25] people like got invited to stern and got to play it they would they would probably be satisfied

[57:31] that they got to play and enjoy the new machine and they'd actually probably not even want it as

[57:36] badly as they do when they haven't played it at all and it's this weird thing it's this desire

[57:43] just to like have a box arrive at your house and it gives you that giddy feeling of a kid on

[57:50] Christmas morning right and I've said this before I mean that's pretty much to me what the new

[57:55] inbox craze is about a lot of times it's that when you're an adult you can create that excitement

[58:03] of your toy arriving without having to wait for your parents to give you the toy right the

[58:10] endorphins that are released when your gift and your toy arrives like on Christmas or your birthday

[58:16] you can control that excitement as you get older by spoiling yourself every pinball machine that

[58:23] an adult gives himself is is the adult spoiling themselves but once you get over that desire to have

[58:29] that feeling it's more fun to play at barcades and your friends house isn't save the money and

[58:34] watch your money pile up in other areas all right this has been episode let's see

[58:42] 274 can it has pinball podcasts I mean that's this is amazing we're almost at episode 275

[58:48] everyone my final words of advice don't freak the fuck out about Beatles chances are you don't

[58:54] you didn't even want it okay so if you didn't want it then don't complain too much about it

[58:59] wait to see it in person wait to see more images from francheon stern that video is kind of

[59:05] crappy and piss poor pretty pathetic video if you ask me to launch the Beatles with more is

[59:11] going to come on this game you're you know I know you can't help yourselves new pinball equals

[59:16] conversation immediately so just just be be be be a little bit patient in in going nuts here

[59:25] stern pinball if you're listening and I know you are I mean what pinball podcast you're going to

[59:29] listen to other than this one the only one who actually says something interesting about your

[59:33] company stern pinball if you're listening there's only so much you can push there's only so

[59:38] much you can push your product out into the world and expect there to be demand for it you got

[59:43] away with it with supreme but you're not going to quite get away with it I think this time I think

[59:49] this is going to be the one where you learn a little bit of a lesson that if you're going to make

[59:53] any pinball machine right it's in it this is an enthusiast product it's the same way with cars

[59:59] if you're going to make an enthusiast product it doesn't matter what the theme is you still have

[01:00:04] to make sure that the enthusiasm is shared by the hardcore and enthusiast base that that buys pinball

[01:00:12] machines you know there's not enough casual people that are going to throw a seven to twelve to

[01:00:20] fifteen thousand dollar Beatles pinball machine into their home there just isn't I could be wrong

[01:00:26] and you could be right if you do this if you are successful in selling out all you know

[01:00:32] nineteen hundred and sixty four Beatles pinball machines I think it's kind of sad because it just

[01:00:38] proves that you're you could just keep getting away with this shit and there's no consequences

[01:00:43] whatsoever and you're just going to keep averaging down this shit until you're basically selling

[01:00:49] this cardboard pinball machines for fifteen thousand dollars now I joke who cares if you're a

[01:00:55] Beatles fan and you want this by it if you hate it hate it no one's making anyone buy this fucking

[01:01:00] thing I think it's not for me I think you guys are going to be blown away by monsters I do I think

[01:01:06] it's going to be the one to get excited about and in three four weeks no one's going to care about

[01:01:12] Beatles it's just going to be that sexy looking thing that was meant for Beatles collectors but

[01:01:16] monsters is going to be the thing that grabs your attention all right everyone have a good day

[01:01:20] I'll talk to you soon
