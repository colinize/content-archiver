[00:00] What becomes of the broken hearted, Who had love that's now departed?

[00:09] I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:30] I'm not dedicated to this pinball podcast.

[00:34] I took an Uber to work so I can make this show for you.

[00:37] I couldn't sleep and I just wanted to get my thoughts about Toy Story Pinball.

[00:41] I played it this weekend for over an hour at Jack Bar.

[00:44] Put about 15 games on it, I would say.

[00:48] I want to share with you why I feel personally deep down in my pinball soul devastation.

[00:55] I'm going to explain to you why this game devastates me.

[00:58] It's not all bad.

[00:59] I'm going to tell you the things I liked about the game.

[01:01] I'm going to tell you the things that I wasn't really sure about.

[01:04] But I'm going to overall sort of summarize my feelings on this game as being a devastating

[01:10] game for someone like me that loves Toy Story.

[01:13] I'm going to explain why in a very even, keel way.

[01:15] I know there's a lot of interviews with Jack Guinari going around lately.

[01:19] Thank you to people on Pinside and other pinball news websites for summarizing said interview.

[01:25] But I want to address some of that stuff as well on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:29] And then I want to get on to what's next in pinball.

[01:32] Because look, not every game is going to make each of us happy.

[01:35] Not every game is a game we need to buy.

[01:38] And I had fun playing Toy Story Pinball.

[01:40] But the thing is, it's okay if a game comes out and it doesn't light our world on fire.

[01:44] It's okay if a game comes out and we don't feel compelled to spend a lot of money on it.

[01:48] I think it's actually a relief for many of us out there when a new game comes out that

[01:53] we just don't want to buy.

[01:55] I had a lot of fun going to Jack Bar, having a frozen margarita, and playing Toy Story

[01:59] for a while.

[02:00] I mean, that's what pinball is supposed to be.

[02:02] It was never supposed to be this thing.

[02:04] We spend 12 to $15,000 on and stick it in our home.

[02:08] And it's got coin slots for operators.

[02:11] And we put it on free play.

[02:12] We spend so much of our lives trying to put up high scores on these games.

[02:15] And nobody cares.

[02:16] Nobody cares.

[02:17] All of these things are just entertainment devices meant for our enjoyment.

[02:22] And if you enjoy a game, and you love a game, and you want to buy a game, do that.

[02:27] And if you love Toy Story 4, and you want to buy it, and you want to own it, do that.

[02:31] What you're about to hear is just my opinion.

[02:33] And I think some people value it.

[02:35] Some people hate it.

[02:36] But here's my opinion about this game.

[02:38] And then we'll talk about the Jersey Jack interview.

[02:40] And then I'll let you go because I got to taxi it back home and wake Kelly and up.

[02:44] So my overall thoughts are this.

[02:46] The game does shoot really nicely.

[02:49] This is the best shooting Jersey Jack pinball machine to date.

[02:53] If you're a casual pinball fan, you will have more fun playing this Jersey Jack machine

[02:59] than any other Jersey Jack machine ever.

[03:02] It is more fun than Wizard of Oz, which is a clunky game to shoot.

[03:05] It's more fun than The Hobbit, which has absolutely zero interesting shots in the entire game.

[03:11] It's more fun to shoot than dialed in because it's easier and more approachable.

[03:15] It is more fun to shoot than Pire to the Caribbean.

[03:18] You know, if you're a casual person and you still walk up to Pire to the Caribbean, you

[03:21] will absolutely still be confused by that game.

[03:23] If you're a casual player, it is a better game to shoot than Willy Wonka, which is arguably

[03:28] Jersey Jack pinball's second best shooting game of all time because Willy Wonka is still

[03:32] a little bit harder than Toy Story.

[03:34] I mean, the Toy Story shots are pretty easy to hit.

[03:37] It's an easy game to shoot from a layout standpoint.

[03:40] It is a more fun game to shoot than Guns N' Roses.

[03:42] It just is.

[03:43] The shots are better.

[03:44] They feel better.

[03:45] So everything about the game layout and the feel of the game, absolutely, I think Pat

[03:50] Lawler did a great job with the layout.

[03:53] Like, you will have a fun time shooting this game.

[03:55] But my issue with this game is not about the design and the layout.

[03:58] My issue with this game and the reason why I am devastated, and this is a little bit

[04:03] ironic if you will, this game is based on Toy Story.

[04:07] And I think the reason why this game is so devastating to me is the two things that this

[04:12] game does not have.

[04:14] The two things that it gets all wrong are the toys and the story.

[04:19] See I've been harping on the lack of toys because the lack of toys is easy.

[04:23] You could just look down at the game and know that there are hardly any toys.

[04:26] There's actually no mechanical toys from the movie itself that you interact with in this

[04:31] game.

[04:32] So it's got no mechanical toys that create a wow under the glass.

[04:36] But that's not the real issue I had when I walked up to the machine and I remember this

[04:40] movie.

[04:41] And all of you out there, I still like this movie.

[04:44] Like this movie wasn't bad.

[04:45] It wasn't our favorite, but it wasn't bad.

[04:47] I still like the film and I know what the film was about.

[04:50] And I actually watched the film again to get excited about this pinball machine.

[04:55] And then you walk up to Toy Story Pinball and you expect to play the movie.

[05:01] You expect the story from the film to come through in this pinball experience.

[05:06] And guess what you get?

[05:07] None of it.

[05:08] It's like not there.

[05:09] It's just not present.

[05:11] When you hit that start button, they are not telling you the story you remember from Toy

[05:16] Story 4.

[05:17] It's like some sort of weird interpretation by Joe Katz and Pat Lawler that this is Toy

[05:22] Story 4.

[05:24] Like this game is primarily built around a carnival game.

[05:27] I want to do something real quick.

[05:29] I want to read to you what the Toy Story 4 movie is about.

[05:33] So basically the plot of Toy Story 4 is Andy hands his toys over to Bonnie and Woody doesn't

[05:40] really feel loved.

[05:41] So he sneaks into her backpack and he goes into her kindergarten class and that's where

[05:46] she makes Forky.

[05:48] And then they go on this road trip.

[05:50] And Forky jumps out the window in the moving RV.

[05:53] And Woody does the same despite Buzz Lightyear trying to keep him on board the RV.

[05:58] And then Woody convinces Forky his places with Bonnie.

[06:02] As they're on their way back, they pass the antique shop.

[06:05] He sees Bo Peep's lamp.

[06:06] And then all of the stuff happens inside the antique shop.

[06:10] And then Buzz is trying to find Woody and gets stuck and lost in the carnival.

[06:14] Now Buzz escapes the carnival and then the rest of the movie takes place back in the

[06:19] antique shop.

[06:20] That's where they meet Duke Kaboom.

[06:22] That's where we get Gabby Gabby and Benson.

[06:25] That's where we see the antique pinball machine they're hiding inside of.

[06:29] But the whole movie is this story about that.

[06:32] It's not a movie about a carnival.

[06:35] That's a very small part of Toy Story 4.

[06:38] And to base this entire game's story and most of the stuff you're doing in this game

[06:43] is based around the carnival, it's such a bad interpretation of the film itself.

[06:50] And I just don't think Jersey Jack Pinball really understands storytelling.

[06:55] And the story was right there.

[06:57] There's no better storytellers on planet earth than Pixar.

[07:01] And so how do you take a Pixar story and you boil it down?

[07:04] You distill it down to being all about the carnival?

[07:08] This is like if you made Lord of the Rings and instead of making the movies we got, you

[07:13] made Lord of the Rings about Bilbo's birthday party.

[07:16] And the whole wizard mode is to get to Gandalf's fireworks display.

[07:20] I mean that is what it feels like when you take Toy Story 4 and you put it in a blender

[07:26] and the only thing that comes out of it is the carnival as the main thing and the main

[07:30] stuff you're doing in this game.

[07:32] And so it doesn't have toys.

[07:34] It doesn't have the story you love.

[07:36] Again, like when you start the game and you see what's going on on the screen, there's

[07:41] absolutely like no prompts or anything that you remember from the movie itself.

[07:46] All you hear is the song.

[07:48] And this is another game in which Jersey Jack has absolutely zero assets from the movie

[07:55] itself.

[07:56] You see none of the characters, none of the clips from the film, nothing.

[08:00] This whole movie, Toy Story, it's all about the interactions between the characters and

[08:06] then you make a Toy Story pinball machine and it has absolutely zero interaction between

[08:12] the characters happening up on the screen, happening on the play field, happening anywhere.

[08:18] I mean why would you even bother making a game if you don't have anything?

[08:22] Why are we making these games in pinball and charging this much money if you're not going

[08:27] to get what you need to do it right?

[08:29] And here's the other part.

[08:30] I'm really concerned about this in pinball.

[08:32] Why is it that Lord of the Rings with a DMD, not even in an LCD screen, how is it that

[08:39] a game like Lord of the Rings that came out, are you waiting for it?

[08:44] 18 years ago, we could make Lord of the Rings with a DMD and it could tell you more of the

[08:50] story and it could connect to the movies better than this does with a humongous 27 inch LCD

[08:58] screen TV.

[08:59] You know, so like just the entire story of Toy Story 4 is not here.

[09:03] It is not present.

[09:05] I don't understand this game, right?

[09:07] So like let's just say this, apparently you play as Buzz Lightyear.

[09:10] Okay, so if I'm playing as Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story 4, you are not progressing through

[09:15] this game the way Buzz Lightyear progresses through the movie.

[09:19] You're not starting out in the RV with Andy trying to talk Woody out of like leaving with

[09:24] Forky.

[09:25] You're not going to find yourself tied up as the Carnival game and you're talking to

[09:29] the two like hip hop bunnies that are tied next to you.

[09:32] None of that, none of those scenes, none of those personalities, none of that magic is

[09:36] in this game at all from a storytelling standpoint.

[09:39] It's like not there at all.

[09:42] It's just the music on loop like you're in a casino.

[09:45] And so where's the story?

[09:47] Like if I'm Buzz, then how come you're not taking me through all the different scenes

[09:51] and moments and experiences Buzz went through in that story, in that movie?

[09:56] I just think this has like always been my issue with storytelling in Pimball.

[10:00] It's like does nobody understand how to tell a story in Pimball format anymore?

[10:07] We've seen it done before.

[10:09] When it's done right, it's amazing.

[10:11] When it's done right, you walk away from the Pimball machine feeling like you just played

[10:16] the thing you loved and the Pimball machine connected you to the thing you love in the

[10:21] right way.

[10:23] And here's what I see is happening in Pimball.

[10:25] We're just lowering our standards and our expectations for theme integration.

[10:29] But even if you don't have the assets, you can do it right.

[10:33] Like Jurassic Park over at Stern Pimball, that's how you do it if you don't have the

[10:39] assets.

[10:40] And I don't think Jersey Jack Pimball has any idea how to make a game without the assets

[10:46] that still makes you feel and connects you to the property you love in the right way.

[10:52] I think they fall back on the theme song and then I think they just throw a bunch of muted

[10:57] clips at you all cut up in all different ways, but none of it is cohesive and it just doesn't

[11:05] work.

[11:06] And I'm sorry, but you shouldn't have to study rule sets and you shouldn't have to study

[11:11] anything else.

[11:12] A Pimball machine should pull you into the experience of the film you love without needing

[11:18] some sort of playbook on how to emotionally connect to the game.

[11:22] I don't think you should need any supplemental knowledge.

[11:26] It should pull you in right away.

[11:29] The way Jurassic Park does the way the big Lebowski does the way Lord of the Rings does

[11:34] the way Spider-Man does the way Tron does.

[11:37] You could keep going on and on and on.

[11:40] It's almost like this LCD screen has absolutely destroyed some of these people's ability

[11:45] to understand how to tell a story via Pimball.

[11:50] And the greatest way to tell a story via Pimball isn't even on the screen.

[11:55] It's on the physical play field.

[11:58] Let's go to that now.

[11:59] So when you play this game, sure it's fun to shoot, but you could absolutely remove

[12:03] the artwork from this game and you would have no idea what game it is.

[12:08] There's nothing physical in this game that brings to life the Toy Story World of Toy

[12:13] Story 4.

[12:15] The majority of this movie takes place in the antique shop.

[12:19] The antique shop is represented in this game as a scoop and a flat piece of plastic over

[12:25] it and that's it.

[12:26] That's the only element of the antique shop you will find in this.

[12:30] Think about it for a minute.

[12:32] Think about how lazy it is that this is their interpretation of the antique shop.

[12:37] You're telling me that they couldn't have built like the front of the antique shop and

[12:42] have Bo Peep's lamp there and maybe it lights up and that's your signal to go into the antique

[12:48] shop and the door opens up and then you go in there and then you start playing through

[12:53] some of the modes of the antique shop.

[12:55] But the way they have it in this game, it's just sterile.

[12:59] It's just this flat piece of plastic.

[13:01] There's no feeling of going into the antique shop at all.

[13:04] Let me talk about the Duke Kaboom shot, which is the one that everyone keeps talking about

[13:08] as being like, all right, well, that's fun.

[13:10] Yeah, it's fun to hit the Duke Kaboom ramp.

[13:13] But this is another great example of how I just don't think Jersey Jack Pinball understands

[13:19] how to create a pinball moment.

[13:22] So people will say like, this game is for casuals.

[13:25] Casual people will jump on this game and have a lot of fun.

[13:28] But I'm here to tell you right now, when that Duke Kaboom ramp goes up for the first time

[13:32] and you're a casual pinball player, you still have no idea why the ramp went up.

[13:37] It's because you hit some target in the in lanes on the left side.

[13:40] You have no idea though, if you're a casual player, but think about it like this.

[13:44] You're about to try to hit this Duke Kaboom ramp for the first time in this pinball games

[13:49] experience.

[13:50] Does it create a moment for you?

[13:52] Does it say, ladies and gentlemen, now Duke Kaboom and like the strobe lights are going

[13:57] and maybe it asks you to trap the ball with the left flipper and you get one shot to hit

[14:01] the ramp and then it says, can you do it again?

[14:04] It doesn't do any of that.

[14:05] There's no moment when that ramp first pops up that makes you feel like a daredevil about

[14:10] to go off this jump and off this ramp.

[14:12] They just don't know how to make a moment.

[14:14] I had the same issues with Willy Wonka and the Wonka vision.

[14:18] Like you've got Willy Wonka vision in this game and it's just used in a way that doesn't

[14:22] create a memorable pinball moment.

[14:25] And that's my thing with this game.

[14:26] It's like, I don't know how Jersey Jack maps out their pinball games.

[14:31] But I really don't think they really understand emotionally how to create pinball moments

[14:38] that make people go crazy.

[14:40] Look, the story is not there.

[14:42] Let me go back to the gameplay and what it's like to shoot this game.

[14:45] It is an easy game to shoot and keep the ball alive.

[14:47] Like you're not going to be draining heavy.

[14:50] This is Jersey Jack's most friendly game from a layout standpoint and I enjoyed that.

[14:54] Like I'm not the best pinball player.

[14:56] I enjoy having some time on a game.

[14:59] I don't want a game like brutally fast like Rick and Morty.

[15:02] I don't want a game like Wizard of Oz that's designed to drain on the left side every time

[15:07] the ball heads in that direction.

[15:08] So this game was actually like, all right, like, see, I would have loved it if like Ghost

[15:12] Busters was designed like Toy Story, right?

[15:15] Imagine if Ghost Buster toys were put into this game and you had the flow of this game

[15:20] with this kind of flipper gap.

[15:22] I think that would have made the greatest pinball machine ever.

[15:25] The game is fun.

[15:26] It's approachable.

[15:27] You know, I felt myself constantly hitting the captive ball in the upper right and then

[15:32] you've got like the woody spinner, which then goes into this like vertical up kick.

[15:37] So many of the shots are like, hit the captive ball, hit the captive ball.

[15:41] You are never going to hit a captive ball more than you do in this game.

[15:45] I'll tell you that.

[15:46] So you've got the left ramp, which is easy.

[15:48] You know, I was playing the game and it was like, hit the right ramp, hit the right ramp.

[15:52] There's only one problem when you're a casual player and you walk up to this game.

[15:56] There is no right ramp.

[15:58] You can't see a right ramp.

[16:00] Now the right orbit does bend around and go up.

[16:04] So it may be that's technically a ramp, but you can't see it.

[16:09] So that was a little strange.

[16:10] You also can't see the bow peep shot at all.

[16:13] This is my other issue.

[16:14] I don't like shots where you're shooting into a blind area of the game because it's not

[16:20] satisfying.

[16:22] So the bow peep spinner, which you hit with the upper right flipper, it is absolutely

[16:27] hidden by the antique shop plastic.

[16:29] You can't see it.

[16:30] You cannot see the spinner at all from your player's point of view.

[16:35] So let me ask you guys a question.

[16:37] Is that a good design to have a spinner you can't even see?

[16:42] To have one of the main character shots in the game, absolutely blind to the player who's

[16:47] playing the game.

[16:49] Most of your shots are going to the right side of the play field.

[16:52] Gabby Gabby's to the right.

[16:53] The Duke Kaboom ramp is to the right.

[16:55] You know, I'm looking down at the play field now.

[16:57] It just reminds me how open it is, how smooth it is, how fun it is to shoot, but it's also

[17:04] reminding me how there's nothing really that special in the game.

[17:09] And then I'm going to talk about this LCD screen that takes up the back left of this

[17:14] game.

[17:15] This is the laziest use of screen I've ever seen in a pinball machine ever.

[17:22] It takes up the most real estate ever of any screen under the glass in the history of pinball.

[17:28] Okay, so let's start there.

[17:30] It is also at this weird, awkward angle.

[17:33] Anyone that tells you it's not weird or awkward, how many of you, when you use an iPad, hold

[17:39] it at that angle, tilt it to that degree and then rotate it like that.

[17:44] It is so strange.

[17:46] It doesn't work.

[17:47] I kept finding myself having to like almost like get on my tippy toes to lean over to

[17:51] see what it was saying.

[17:53] It's not natural to look at a screen like that.

[17:56] They use the screen in Wonka much better.

[17:59] The screen in Guns N' Roses was used much better than this.

[18:04] This is a really, really bad design choice.

[18:08] And I just didn't like it.

[18:10] Like why do we need this screen right below this bigger screen?

[18:15] I still think they could have implemented a screen into this game, but not like this.

[18:20] The way it's dropped there is completely lazy.

[18:23] I think you'll get used to it, but it doesn't add anything to the game.

[18:28] I played the Tiki Mini Pinball game.

[18:30] Sure, it's not as much fun as playing Stewie's Mini Pinball in Family Guy.

[18:35] What is this adding to pinball?

[18:37] When you play it, yes, there's a little bit of like latency lag.

[18:40] It just doesn't make you feel anything.

[18:44] Pinball is all about the physicality.

[18:45] If we remove the physical feel from the pinball experience and we add more screens, we're

[18:51] actually making pinball worse.

[18:54] Like I could go play Virtual Pinball.

[18:57] Why do I want it inside a 12 to $15,000 pinball machine?

[19:02] Because people, this is cost cutting at its finest example.

[19:07] They could have put a mechanical toy in that space.

[19:11] Instead, they put a $30 screen and then just coated it.

[19:16] It's never going to break.

[19:17] You're never going to have to solder anything to it.

[19:19] You're never going to have to like add some oil.

[19:22] It's a damn screen, but I don't buy pinball machines because I want more screens in my

[19:28] life.

[19:29] I want physical worlds under glass.

[19:33] I think it's a cop out.

[19:35] I think this is one of the lamest things that Pat Lawler has ever put in a machine.

[19:39] I mean it when I say it.

[19:41] If he made Fun House today, Rudy would not be Rudy.

[19:45] Rudy would be an LCD screen.

[19:47] If he made Twilight Zone today, let's take out the magnetic upper play field with the

[19:52] magnet flips and let's just put a screen there.

[19:55] That's what they would do.

[19:57] Why do we need a physical gun ball machine when it can just be a screen?

[20:01] Why do anything when it can just be a screen?

[20:04] Because if you go down that road, why even make pinball machines when I can just watch

[20:08] Toy Story 4 on a screen?

[20:10] The reason why we love pinball, the reason why you make pinball machines and the true

[20:15] test of a great designer and a great pinball machine is how well did you physically build

[20:21] the world of that theme under glass?

[20:24] If we move away from that narrative and I know some of these distributors and these

[20:28] apologists want us to move away from that narrative and there is a lot of toxic positivity

[20:35] going around in the pinball media space these days.

[20:38] And if you don't know what toxic positivity is, it's just as bad as being toxic and negative.

[20:43] It is that you cheerlead everything, you make excuses for everything and you stop expecting

[20:49] anything.

[20:50] You just say everything is awesome.

[20:52] And then we end up here.

[20:53] This is the most expensive pinball machine ever from a pinball company ever and it's

[20:58] got one of the cheapest things ever put into a game and there are no toys in it that reflect

[21:05] Toy Story and there's almost no story carried through from the Toy Story movie in this game

[21:11] and yet it's the most expensive thing ever.

[21:13] Why?

[21:14] Where are the assets?

[21:15] Where are the toys?

[21:17] Where are the mechs?

[21:18] Where's the conversations between the characters on this big 27 inch screen that you have?

[21:23] Why do you have this big screen if you can't use it?

[21:25] What's the point in all of this?

[21:27] What is the point people?

[21:28] I know it's early, I know I'm sleep deprived, but why is it 18 years ago we can recreate

[21:35] Lord of the Rings in a way that blows Toy Story away and I could go buy that game 18

[21:42] years ago for like $3,700.

[21:46] $3,700.

[21:47] Okay, let's adjust that for inflation today.

[21:51] So something that cost $3,700 in 2004 should cost us $5,800 today.

[21:58] Let's calculate right now.

[22:00] To justify the cost of a $15,000 pinball machine, do you know how much pinball machines would

[22:05] have cost in 2004 with inflation in mind?

[22:10] $9,500 people.

[22:12] And if you went back to 2004 and you asked people to spend $9,500 on a pinball machine,

[22:18] the entire hobby would be over.

[22:20] The entire hobby would spend that money.

[22:22] All right, I'm devastated.

[22:23] This isn't good.

[22:24] This isn't good.

[22:25] This isn't how Toy Story pinball should be.

[22:28] I don't care if you loop the theme song.

[22:31] This isn't it.

[22:32] This isn't how you tell the story and it's not how you mechanically make a pinball machine.

[22:37] And that's it.

[22:38] Case closed.

[22:39] And guess what?

[22:40] I'm not buying it.

[22:41] And if you want to buy it, fine.

[22:42] But I don't have to praise it and I don't have to say good job and I don't have to make

[22:45] launch videos because you know there's a lot of people that are nervous now.

[22:48] There's a lot of dealers that are going to be stuck with inventory.

[22:50] There's a lot of fanboys that don't know what to do now.

[22:53] So let's talk a little bit about Jack's interview.

[22:56] And again, like I know Jack personally.

[22:58] Jack is a really good guy.

[22:59] Do I think Jack is going to tell you 100% the truth when you interview him about his company?

[23:05] No.

[23:06] You know why?

[23:07] Because it's not his company anymore.

[23:09] And he's got to be very careful about what he says.

[23:12] So here's what he says.

[23:13] He says, back in 2014, they originally had Toy Story 1 through 3.

[23:18] And they were going to make the original movies.

[23:20] And then the Wonka license had a short time period.

[23:24] And there was a lot of competition for it to go first.

[23:27] So they made Willy Wonka instead of Toy Story 1 through 3.

[23:31] So let's just stop right there and take Jack's statements at face value.

[23:35] If you did that, Jack, if you bumped Willy Wonka in front of the Toy Story 1 through

[23:40] 3 franchise, that was a colossal marketing mistake.

[23:46] Toy Story is so much bigger of a property and a license than Willy Wonka.

[23:51] And you're telling me that there was huge competition to get Willy Wonka.

[23:55] Was there really a movie that's been out since the 19, like what, like early 70s, maybe late

[24:01] 60s?

[24:02] So that was a colossal marketing failure if Jack decided to quickly get Wonka.

[24:08] And I'm just going to say this.

[24:09] I know that there are people out there.

[24:11] There are people out there.

[24:12] And Jack is saying this narrative as well.

[24:13] He doesn't want me to release episode 500.

[24:16] For those people who out there who think that none of Pat Lawler's designs for Toy Story

[24:21] made its way into Willy Wonka, they're lying.

[24:24] Jack, I talked to your people on the line in New Jersey.

[24:28] I'm not saying the whole game was a reskin, but people, Etch-a-Sketch turned into Wonka

[24:34] Vision.

[24:35] Look at the damn Wonka Vision screen.

[24:38] And you tell me that's not Etch-a-Sketch.

[24:41] And I don't care, right?

[24:42] It doesn't matter.

[24:43] It really doesn't matter.

[24:44] Like this debate will never be settled.

[24:47] When it comes to the truth and what Jack is going to tell us and what Canade is going

[24:51] to tell you, who knows?

[24:52] Like all bets are off.

[24:54] Like who's telling the truth?

[24:55] The truth is somewhere in the middle.

[24:57] But let's not just take any of this for face value.

[24:59] But everyone who worked behind the scenes at Jersey Jack, yes, they know the truth.

[25:03] You're never going to get it on an interview.

[25:05] You're never going to get it.

[25:06] There's no way they're going to tell you this because it's to no benefit if Jack does tell

[25:11] you any of that happened.

[25:12] But I think the decision to bump Wonka in front of Toy Story 1 through 3 was an inane

[25:17] decision.

[25:18] And then Jack says like, why they were planning Toy Story, the fourth movie came out sooner

[25:23] than expected.

[25:24] He said something like two years sooner than expected.

[25:26] Really?

[25:27] You think Pixar and Disney like two years ahead of schedule?

[25:31] And then Toy Story 4 was actually delayed.

[25:32] It was supposed to come out in 2017.

[25:34] I think it came out in 2019.

[25:37] So look, I don't know.

[25:38] All I know is this.

[25:40] This is the game we got.

[25:41] This isn't the Toy Story we really want it.

[25:44] This isn't the game for me.

[25:46] It's a fine, fun game to play.

[25:49] The value is not there.

[25:51] Everybody knows that.

[25:52] And I'm saying this right now.

[25:54] These dealers are going to be sitting on $15,000 CEs.

[25:57] There's twice as many of them as Willy Wonka's CEs.

[26:02] People twice as many.

[26:04] And there's not as much in the game.

[26:06] And remember, it took them a long time to sell out of the Willy Wonka's CEs.

[26:11] And so look, this is all a decision you need to make.

[26:14] I'm here to tell you personally I'm devastated that this is the Toy Story pinball machine

[26:19] we get.

[26:20] It's not very often that I get devastated by a pinball machine.

[26:23] It's just that I love Toy Story so much.

[26:26] And I love Toy Story 1 through 3 so much.

[26:29] And I love physical worlds under glass so much.

[26:32] I'm not in this hobby just because I want a game that has good flow.

[26:37] If I wanted a game that has good flow, I would just go get Black Knight.

[26:40] If I wanted a game that has good flow, I would just go get Game of Thrones.

[26:44] It's not just about flow.

[26:46] See that's always what we fall back on.

[26:47] Is it fun to shoot?

[26:49] Every pinball machine is fun to shoot.

[26:51] Every pinball machine, almost every pinball machine is fun to shoot.

[26:55] That's not where the conversation ends.

[26:56] So then you have to ask, is it worth it?

[26:58] Is it worth it to me?

[26:59] And look, all of this.

[27:01] Nobody really needs another pinball machine.

[27:03] Nobody needs a pinball machine to begin with.

[27:05] But if I'm going to own it and I'm going to spend this much money.

[27:07] And there is a little irony that for operators.

[27:10] This is the best operator game ever from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[27:13] And now you have to spend this much money.

[27:15] As an operator, you have to spend this much money.

[27:17] Is this game worth twice the price of a Stern Pro?

[27:21] Is it going to earn twice as much as a Stern Pro?

[27:24] I don't know.

[27:25] I mean, but it is a beautiful game.

[27:26] I'll say this on location.

[27:29] This game is twice as beautiful as a Stern Pro.

[27:32] It is.

[27:33] The Jersey Jack machine just looks better.

[27:37] Like aesthetically, this is such a more beautiful pinball package than a Stern machine.

[27:43] Like the details are there.

[27:45] They do get the details right.

[27:47] Like that's what's so frustrating with Jersey Jack Pinball because they finally fix the

[27:51] flipper feel on the game.

[27:53] Like the flippers in this game are the best flipper feel of any Jersey Jack machine.

[27:58] The light show is fine.

[27:59] It's not better than GNR.

[28:01] I wasn't blown away by the light show because now we're used to these light shows.

[28:05] Remember how like TNA, like the first time you saw TNA light show, it blew you away.

[28:10] And then we got kind of the same thing in Rick and Morty.

[28:13] You just get used to light shows.

[28:15] Like you can't fall back on a light show as being like the wow in a game.

[28:19] It needs to have more.

[28:20] And I will fight any of you that if you say GNR is only a light show, GNR is every single

[28:27] asset imaginable is in the game.

[28:30] Every single thing.

[28:31] The game is going to look spectacular on location.

[28:34] And then when I walked away from the game, the blue is beautiful.

[28:37] I do like the blue.

[28:39] It goes with Toy Story.

[28:40] And I'm just going to say this.

[28:41] It's not just because I'm not buying one.

[28:43] I just think the collector's edition of this machine is pointless.

[28:47] I think this is absolutely out of all the CEs Jersey Jack has ever done.

[28:51] I think this is the one I would not even bother with.

[28:54] I just saw on Pinsight a guy is selling a brand new like 10 plays, Ellie of Toy Story for $11,000.

[29:02] So you're already saving $1,000 on the second hand market.

[29:06] If I were you and you want to put this game in your home for your family to have fun with,

[29:11] I would just wait, get one for cheaper.

[29:14] Don't bother with the CE because I'm telling you, this CE is just going to keep losing money.

[29:19] You're not going to make any money on it.

[29:21] And you're not going to get any more gameplay experience.

[29:24] If there was like a major mech or there was something else in the CE, I could see how

[29:29] you could justify it.

[29:30] But I don't think you're going to get anything out of the glitter, anything out of the topper

[29:35] and anything out of the radcals.

[29:36] Like it doesn't matter.

[29:37] All right.

[29:38] So that's it.

[29:38] So that's it.

[29:39] So I move on.

[29:40] So this is it.

[29:40] And this is going to be my final show on Toy Story.

[29:43] I might play it again down the road if they put more code into the game, but I'm done talking about it.

[29:48] So if you're annoyed with me talking about Toy Story, I have good news for you.

[29:53] I'm not going to keep bringing it up.

[29:55] I got to play the game.

[29:56] Everyone said, Chris, play the game and then give us your impressions.

[29:59] And that is this.

[30:01] And the last point I'll make, I just think it's funny that Steve Bowden, who's an employee at American Pinball,

[30:06] is going on shows helping to sell products of his competitor.

[30:10] At some point, everyone's going to wake up and realize when you're taking a paycheck as a marketing guy

[30:16] for a company, you shouldn't be going on to the media outlets and praising your competitors' efforts.

[30:22] It's just called common sense.

[30:25] But what does Canadian know?

[30:26] You know, I'm not a professional pinball player.

[30:28] I don't even get any credit anymore for my rumors and speculation stuff.

[30:32] Like, I was telling people months ago that Stern had Jaws, that there were no assets they had for the game.

[30:38] I was telling people that, that it's going to be like Jurassic Park.

[30:41] And now Jack Winari's out there saying like, he could have got the Jaws license, but it was just the movie poster.

[30:46] Yup, everybody knows that.

[30:48] I've been saying that for months.

[30:50] But look, I don't care about the credit.

[30:51] All I care about is that you guys enjoy this show every week and it is fun.

[30:56] And this is why I'm not going to talk about Toy Story anymore.

[30:59] Because it's not fun.

[31:00] When a game comes out that I don't like, it's just not fun.

[31:04] Like, I don't want to keep spreading negativity about the game.

[31:06] Like, I'm over it.

[31:07] I want to get back to good vibes in pinball.

[31:10] You know what I love about pinball?

[31:11] Just vibing with the community.

[31:13] It was so much fun to go to Jack Bar and just have a couple frozen margaritas and just chat and just play a game

[31:20] and go home with money in my pocket and not feel like I have to buy the damn thing.

[31:25] Like, pinball was meant to be played out and about.

[31:27] It was meant to bring us together.

[31:29] It wasn't meant to be this thing that we need to always own.

[31:33] And it's crazy.

[31:34] Like, these prices are out of control.

[31:37] I don't want to buy any pinball machine anymore for 12 to $15,000.

[31:41] Not when I'm looking at the state of the economy.

[31:44] Not when I look into my little boy's eyes and I look at Killian.

[31:47] I'm like, would I be better off putting this money away for his future or buying a pinball machine?

[31:52] I just don't want to do it.

[31:53] I don't want to do it.

[31:55] And I still think you can get plenty of great pinball for much less money than 12 to $15,000.

[32:02] And I think a few great machines in your house and you're going to be happy.

[32:05] You don't need to chase every new thing.

[32:07] Everybody, thank you for being a club member.

[32:09] I really appreciate it.

[32:11] I can't believe it's 5.30 in the morning and I'm going to taxi it back home.

[32:15] So if you ever question my dedication to pinball podcasting, just remember today, okay?

[32:20] Sleep Deprived, Canada will still get you a show every Monday at least, later.
