[00:00] All right, we're in the garden of Eden here.

[00:07] Let's get everybody in, talking to him, ball, beautiful day.

[00:15] Let's get this, share this link.

[00:22] Birds are chirping.

[00:29] We're live.

[00:36] Who's in the house?

[00:41] And we got Brian Caz.

[00:46] It's a holiday weekend.

[00:48] So we'll see.

[00:49] We might not be that many people joining today, but

[00:53] Harry Potter and June.

[00:54] We're right away.

[00:55] We're talking Harry Potter, June.

[00:56] Well, there's not much left to make.

[00:58] I'm not sure if we can get to that.

[01:00] But I think it's June next week.

[01:01] So yeah, I think any guesses that Harry Potter is coming out in June

[01:05] or good ones.

[01:06] I'm here in the backyard of Canada in Roedin, Connecticut.

[01:15] We have a little memorial day parade today.

[01:18] Some friends coming over.

[01:19] I mowed along yesterday.

[01:21] Working in the garden, by the way.

[01:24] So therapeutic.

[01:25] I was going to be pulling out weeds all yesterday.

[01:28] Had a good time.

[01:29] Whether, as you can see, is beautiful.

[01:32] I do not miss living in New York City at all.

[01:36] Like, there is not a single day that I ever say to myself,

[01:40] I wish I was still in the city.

[01:42] I mean, I wish I got out of there 10 years ago.

[01:46] And got these homes for a third of the price.

[01:50] But you know, it is what it is.

[01:51] We'll never move.

[01:52] I always say this to Brenda.

[01:53] I love this house so much.

[01:54] I m going to give it to give it to the kids one day.

[01:57] If we make a lot more money one day, we'll get another house.

[02:00] But I m not selling this one.

[02:01] This just feels like a little slice of heaven.

[02:04] I don't really want much more to be honest.

[02:06] Watching the friends and neighbors, the John Ham show.

[02:09] Such a good job of like articulating the enaneness of having a lot of money

[02:17] and this stuff people buy.

[02:18] Hey, kill.

[02:19] It's waving to me.

[02:22] We're going to talk all about pinball.

[02:24] We're going to go around the horn today.

[02:25] We're going to talk about every manufacturer and what they have going on.

[02:29] Angry alpaca.

[02:31] All right.

[02:32] We got orbiter, Albert in the house.

[02:35] Let me just go let everybody know in the Patreon chat.

[02:38] We're over here.

[02:39] I don't expect too many people today again.

[02:41] People catch the replay.

[02:43] Want to thank all would we get 600?

[02:46] We just keep declining.

[02:48] 682 subscribers.

[02:51] The goal of 800.

[02:54] We're going in the wrong direction.

[02:57] You know what it is though.

[02:59] It's like when there's not much news.

[03:02] I always notice this.

[03:03] We always lose a few subscribers.

[03:06] But I think that for the most part, the content has been really fun.

[03:12] If you've been a member of the show, you've been enjoying the podcast.

[03:17] Played Evil Dead over the weekend.

[03:20] It's amazing.

[03:22] Lots of fun that game is.

[03:25] It's got a lot in it.

[03:26] I think it's going to be interesting, gang.

[03:28] My big fear of potter.

[03:30] We're going to talk about it.

[03:31] Is that Jersey Jack is going to aim for a game that's easy to build in volume.

[03:38] So I don't think we're going to see a lot of complex mechs.

[03:42] I don't think we're going to see a ton under that play field.

[03:46] So time will tell.

[03:49] But if Jersey Jack needs to crank these things out every week.

[03:54] I think you're going to see a game that's more guns and roses and less

[03:59] pirates of the Caribbean.

[04:01] But Evil Dead is.

[04:04] It really is.

[04:05] I've said it before right now as of today.

[04:07] It's the game of the year.

[04:08] And spooky deserves a lot of credit.

[04:10] Hopefully those servos hold up.

[04:12] But really hard to find anyone who's like, I jumped on an Evil Dead and I didn't like it.

[04:18] Or I don't see the value in it.

[04:20] It's one of those games where there's really not a lot of people complaining about anything.

[04:25] And I think that's good.

[04:27] There's this misconception that Canadian wants to just complain about.

[04:30] In ball doesn't like pinball doesn't play bimble.

[04:33] No, I actually really wish we had four to five Evil Deads out right now.

[04:39] Not like the same theme, but four to five games that were loaded.

[04:44] That had a lot of fun creativity in it that looked stunning and came at a price that justified.

[04:51] How much people are asking for it.

[04:54] I think what amazes me about Evil Dead is.

[04:57] Really the theme is not really that great.

[05:02] My evil dead computer crashed after four games.

[05:06] Did you get a new computer hans?

[05:09] Like good, like, crapped out gone or just had to reset it.

[05:15] Curious to see what let's just go around the horn in five minutes.

[05:20] Let's just let everybody come in and then we'll go manufacturer by manufacturers.

[05:23] That sound good.

[05:25] And I'll let you guys decide which manufacturers we talk to.

[05:30] We talk to we talk about.

[05:32] Wayne what's up over there in Australia.

[05:37] Man, pinball sales overseas tariffs looming over everybody.

[05:42] It's going to get interesting.

[05:44] So there's already an Alice's adventures in Wonderland up for sale after only 20 plays in Europe for like 14,500 euros.

[05:57] As I, you know, like, I've been predicting you're going to be able to get those games easily once they start hitting US shores and people realize it's beautiful.

[06:11] I don't think you're going to see enough game there to justify the beauty.

[06:24] Yeah, really bet.

[06:26] All right, gang.

[06:28] Who do you guys want to talk about first?

[06:32] You know all the manufacturers.

[06:34] We're going to go and we're going to just discuss everything going on with each one.

[06:38] Give some thoughts, some predictions, some rumors.

[06:41] We'll talk about it all whenever consumer confidence drips.

[06:47] Nonessential toy sales.

[06:49] Here's a thing gang rich people don't have to think about anything.

[06:58] And by that, I mean, once you cross the threshold, I'm just going to say the threshold.

[07:04] I mean, anyone with liquid anyone with liquid.

[07:11] More than $2 million in liquid assets.

[07:15] I don't think is we're it's not and that's not even that much money gang in today's world.

[07:19] Let's just say let's just bump it up to 5 million.

[07:22] Nobody has to hesitate on buying a pinball machine who has money who has like real money.

[07:29] And nobody should be buying new and box pinball machine who doesn't have real money.

[07:33] You should be investing your money and buying used games.

[07:38] I mean that like new in box like how you can't be buying new in box game.

[07:42] You know what I'm saying?

[07:43] Like if you if you don't make.

[07:46] Half a million a year family income you should not be spending $15,000 a year on a pinball machine.

[07:53] Like let's just you know, again, you could, but you shouldn't.

[08:00] Well, look, nobody who smart bought a godfather.

[08:03] You know what I'm saying?

[08:05] Like most people didn't buy a godfather.

[08:11] All right, gang, who do we want to talk about pinball adventures?

[08:14] I'm not starting a pinball adventures.

[08:22] Guns and roses at least are gang there are about to be $5,000.

[08:30] You know what I mean?

[08:31] There about to be a $5,000 game.

[08:34] There's so many of them.

[08:36] All right, let's talk, let's talk predators talk pinball brothers.

[08:39] Thank you, John for actually answering the question.

[08:43] So another teaser is out apparently.

[08:46] And I think the fact that the marketing has turned on again leads me to believe that June 12 will be the date we get predator.

[08:57] June 12, 1987 was the day the movie came out.

[09:01] I think predator is going to be interesting.

[09:07] This is a company that this will be the first theme.

[09:13] They're handling that I think people are going to have high expectations.

[09:19] Remember, they did not make nor design alien.

[09:23] That was Andrew highway's company.

[09:26] They then went and made the queen game, which remember, remember,

[09:31] queen came out like right after guns and roses and it just looked dated.

[09:35] It looked a day late, a dollar short.

[09:39] I've never hear anybody say anything about queen.

[09:42] It just feels like that game never came out.

[09:44] And the same is true with Abba.

[09:46] Another game that came out barely could get the thousand sold or 700 and something sold.

[09:53] Never hear people talk positively about Abba.

[09:57] So you have a company that's basically known for not making good games.

[10:04] For lack of a better way to say it, they just have never made a good game.

[10:08] And now they're making predator, which is a theme that definitely is a good theme for this demo.

[10:15] It's also a theme that has been in the pinball world has been at the center of controversy with the Kevin Kula game,

[10:24] which basically was a moron who was making this game illegally.

[10:28] I just worry about the pinball brother's ability to deliver at the same caliber of where other companies are at.

[10:40] Just waving a killing.

[10:42] Now that being said, out of all the themes, out of all the themes coming out,

[10:49] the predator is the one that I'm the most excited about theme wise.

[10:56] Absolutely.

[10:57] It's an amazing right?

[10:59] Like if Stern made predator instead of John Wick or Venon, they would have sold more predators if done right.

[11:05] So Abba shoots well.

[11:12] So I think again, we're going to see predator in about three weeks.

[11:17] And you know, I don't know.

[11:20] I'm just the whole underside of the play field tease.

[11:25] And I reached out to them.

[11:28] They know I'm excited about the game.

[11:30] I asked for any assets that can get me to help me.

[11:37] You know, get people hyped.

[11:39] And we'll see what they give me.

[11:41] I doubt I'll get anything like early.

[11:45] But I'm excited to see it.

[11:47] I think everybody's excited to see it.

[11:49] And I think it's some.

[11:52] You know, if I had a guess, I don't think it's going to crush.

[11:59] I'll buy one because I love the theme.

[12:04] Unless it really is like empty and just doesn't have Arnold.

[12:09] Is the tear of fear still happening with predator?

[12:12] Yeah, sure.

[12:14] I mean, I think everyone's afraid of the tariffs.

[12:20] The.

[12:24] The tariffs will absolutely destroy the new inbox sales from get for.

[12:31] For you know, for all these companies that need to ship games from Europe to America.

[12:37] All right.

[12:38] So that's predator.

[12:41] And.

[12:48] All right.

[12:49] John.

[12:50] John are like a jack bar says King Kong premium is amazing.

[12:54] And y'all are sleeping on it.

[12:56] And can't wait to see the sentiment shift over the rest of the year.

[12:59] So John, John, because I'll tell you why, John, you are.

[13:04] You are.

[13:05] You are not evaluating this game as a home buyer.

[13:10] You're not a value and I know you're evaluating it as a pinball player.

[13:13] And yes, the game shoots great.

[13:15] No one's denying the fact that King Kong shoots great.

[13:19] It's just.

[13:20] It's just people know how much money it's going to lose, John.

[13:25] So like this is the part that I think John and and everyone like is kind of having a hard time that two opposing things can be true at the same time.

[13:35] That King Kong can be a great game that's also going to lose so much value.

[13:41] So like those two things will have and John everyone is saying, yeah, I think the game is great.

[13:47] And I'll pick one up when it's two to three thousand dollars cheaper in six months.

[13:51] That's all we're saying where there is no one who's saying King Kong doesn't shoot well.

[13:57] There is no one who's saying King Kong isn't going to have great code isn't going to be a lot of fun.

[14:02] What everybody is saying is by the time the King Kong code is done, these things are going to be so much cheaper to get.

[14:10] That's it. That's all we're saying.

[14:13] Yeah, but John, here's the thing. The premium is going to lose two to three thousand.

[14:17] The pros going to lose 1500. They're all going to lose value, John.

[14:21] You know what I'm saying? Like no one wants to go in new inbox.

[14:25] You are making money on your new inbox game by routing it, right? No none of us are.

[14:31] So you're going to make a few thousand dollars on your game and then if you decide to sell it, you'll be up.

[14:36] But the rest of us will be down.

[14:44] Well, you know, if they make a jaws 50th like let's just talk about Stern since we're on the Kong.

[14:49] If they make a jaws 50th in a few weeks, you're going to see a lot of jaws is lose value.

[14:55] Who cares? A jaws is a great game.

[14:58] I don't I don't necessarily like the rubber ducky shark.

[15:04] But but jaws as a total package, jaws is a phenomenal game.

[15:10] It's based on a iconic movie and I think it it's like going to jaws will always hold away more way more emotional emotional currency with owners then King Kong ever will.

[15:33] And the jaws does not eat the ball in the fifth year.

[15:43] Yeah, I think here's the thing about Stern right now. They're in a weird place.

[15:48] They're trying to like.

[15:51] They're not used to this like gang like the amount of Kong at least available is comical right so King Kong Ellie not sold out Keith L.

[15:59] And Keith L. win is not driving volume this game is not selling that well right so the the L one army the Stern fanboys screaming about it doesn't matter.

[16:09] It's not selling that well because everyone is like fool me once fool me twice not getting fooled again this this game.

[16:17] It's just there is a real and I mean this there's a real pushback against Stern happening with the new inbox buyer community.

[16:28] And these people are now just they're just over it they're over getting burned.

[16:37] And I think they're going to I think they're going to keep speaking with the wallets and I think it's it's you know they they're content they've got enough great games at home.

[16:49] And and again it's I can I don't think it's like thousands of people but it doesn't take thousands of people I think there's probably like a good.

[17:00] Three to 500 dudes that used to go in on everything that are now sitting on the sidelines and those are the reasons why you're not saying these in sellouts of L.

[17:10] Lee's anymore it's also the reason why you're saying just an overall slow down.

[17:15] Because if you don't get that FOMO and that like frenzy at the beginning then it never it never develops and then it's like a market I mean everything once consumer confidence that I you know that I have to have this now and like.

[17:29] When you start thinking about it I'll think about it and it's good you know you go into the thread and you don't really care now the now the king Kong thread is all about some dude making a bracket right.

[17:41] I don't know some of us is not working right and some dudes got a manufacturer his own bracket.

[17:47] So you're spending all this money and Stern's letting the initial owners have to develop mods to fix the things that should have been fixed at the factory see that thread.

[17:57] I'm in it I'm reading everything you guys are looking at.

[18:10] Yeah because appalling like the thing is this is like it used to be it used to feel special to get an L.

[18:17] It doesn't feel that way anymore. I mean Neil Neil McRae has been like hammering this that a thousand of anything in this market is not collectible.

[18:28] He's not that's not exactly true the problem is is if you only make a thousand of something sure maybe but not a thousand of this just different stickers and then there's like unlimited premiums on limited pros on limits you know and the premiums the same exact game it doesn't it doesn't help.

[18:46] But it's fine again I don't I'm I don't know about you.

[18:51] But I absolutely I absolutely I love what consumers are doing right now they're basically going to change the market.

[19:01] And they're going to force these companies either to put a lot more in games and get much better themes or they're going to force these companies to lower the prices.

[19:11] It's just can't keep going the way it's going everybody knows that stern knows it it's not a negative thing it's just a new reality.

[19:20] And I think that's the other part too is this this weird pressure within the community that like we have we have to buy because if we don't buy pinball won't survive and that's not true anymore like the boutiques will happily take all your dollars that you normally would send a stern or Jersey Jack machine.

[19:40] Let's keep going let's keep going on the stern.

[19:45] Really really really concerned that the walking dead is the next remake and the heat around that rumor is very significant and so you know where there's heat where there's smoke there's fire and I just think if stern remasters the walking dead I don't care if they do comic book artwork.

[20:09] I just think that game is just not going to move the way metallic it did and then you know the other thing to you you just torpedo everyone who owns a walking dead's value and again what's the point.

[20:25] Why do we need to remake walking dead there's not enough demand for that game.

[20:30] It never was I get the code is good it's a lineman sheets game I get it but otherwise that game was never it was never that great like and it's it the layout's not great the well walker well whatever the the barn that opens up with a big face inside it that's a dumbest toy I've ever seen why why would the head be the size.

[21:00] Of the barn.

[21:03] I've never seen I think worse scale orientation in a in a mech than that.

[21:10] At least just when it pops open have a zombie figure that's you know at scale to the barn or something but that that look is so stupid.

[21:22] It doesn't matter though the I don't I just don't think it's going to sell and like the stern's next game to me is kind of so important because because L wind didn't deliver the sales they needed on Kong so I mean but they're going to star wars and Pokemon so like they've got the two biggest themes.

[21:48] This company will ever have had so this this is going to be like really interesting I think I think everyone's over Kong already I do I think everyone's just like yeah you know oh.

[22:05] Kong Kong like you know what I'm saying like we're all just like are three months from now we get the next game I think everyone's going to feel that way I don't think people are going to really care about like following Kong code updates except for owners and.

[22:17] We're on to the next Harry Potter is also going to make everybody move past Kong real quick.

[22:27] All right so stern I think they're like I think they're next six months are going to be like mission critical to get another huge hit.

[22:37] Let's go over let's talk about Jersey Jack Jersey Jack Jersey Jack Jersey Jack Jersey Jack Harry Potter hasn't leaked I've heard I've heard two rumors from sources I trust one said the game is packed the other said it's more.

[23:07] Of what we've seen over the last four games I don't know what to believe I do know that I tend to believe that it's going to be more of what we've seen recently I don't I don't feel like you know if they wanted to go back and load up they would have made it a wide body that's going to be more of what we've seen recently.

[23:27] I don't I don't feel like you know if they wanted to go back and load up they would have made it a wide body they would have.

[23:40] You know I just I don't know it's not toy story for we skinned I just I just.

[23:48] I worry about I always worry about Jersey Jack games because I just as I said and I firmly believe this I don't think they have a chief creative offer server there I think Eric maybe is that guy maybe I'm not sure I think he's been answering homework assignments now.

[24:06] I he's not a huge guns and roses fan he wasn't a pirate to the Caribbean fan he never saw the Godfather movie until after he was assigned the game I believe this is the first game he's ever made in the history of his career as a designer in which he loves the theme in which he feels a personal connection to the theme.

[24:36] That's to me the most exciting thing about this this game is that I know there's not going to be a disconnect and I know when you answer an assignment the difference you you're going to get an ideas versus actually getting to design your dream theme.

[24:55] So I'm excited to see it I think we're all tired of waiting I think there's nothing else to talk about with it I don't think Steve Richie's game is going to come out even in 2026 I think we're going to see nothing but Potter.

[25:10] I mean that I just don't I think this is it they're just going to make this game for a year and a half.

[25:17] The art on King Kong reminds me of Ripley's believe it or not and that's very okay in my book.

[25:25] John I don't think people love the King Kong artwork.

[25:31] It's it does look very Ripley's it just I don't know I look I like the translate on the Ellie I do I just wish that same artwork was on the playfield it's not.

[25:43] And I think they could have done a better job with the the layout of the art on the cabinets I just again that that airplane propeller looks weird it just I don't know something about it it just it's not it's not I don't know it's not a beautiful game to look at it's not bad it just feels more.

[26:06] Comic bookie and not timeless and not iconic I guess that's the best thing Kong is an iconic IP like this is just does not look iconic.

[26:19] You know whenever I hear people be like Jersey Jack needs to hit you know they don't billionaires don't need to worry about their 20 million dollar 40 million dollar pinball operation you know I'm saying no they don't.

[26:44] They have thousands of millions of dollars.

[26:49] If I gave you a thousand dollars and I took 40 away are you feeling it you're hurting.

[26:59] It's they're fine getting their fine.

[27:03] I'm yeah.

[27:06] I hope I hope it's a hit I do I hope so for Eric I hope so for Jack I hope so for this company I hope they finally.

[27:16] You know I hope they finally hit paid or because I hope it's a hit game sales wise and it's also a game that people like really love.

[27:28] Because I think guns and roses.

[27:31] You know the story on G and R it's a great jukebox it's a terrible pinball machine.

[27:39] And that's I think that's accurate and I think you know people come over and you crank it up to volume 11 and you play a few songs it's fun to.

[27:47] For casuals but man it's not the kind of game where you're going to as a pinball lover you're going to come back and and want to jump on it a lot you're just not.

[28:05] Yeah so rogue cyber soldier said they don't have to put in the effort.

[28:12] I do feel there's a little bit of that at JJP.

[28:15] Like what's the point you know we don't need this to survive and because of that they're not making decisions that.

[28:23] That are the right ones you know because you don't pick avatar you don't pick Godfather you don't pick toy story for you don't pick Elton John if you really need to like to make a hit now.

[28:32] Well yes turns down people to throw my lower down on top of their chip playfield so they're both pretty bad when it comes to warranty gang if you read your pinball contract and all these companies there's no warranty from anybody.

[28:52] You literally buy a game and you have no protection at all.

[28:56] It's like the moment you turn it on your your warranties void it.

[28:59] Alright so we got Jersey Jack Harry Potter Harry Potter Harry Potter.

[29:08] Yeah really curious to see how it does I am now one of the rumors I've been reading lately and maybe somebody knows this we might have some distros here that they are going to limit the collective additions to a thousand.

[29:23] Do you think they've changed their mind on that or do you think they're going to make unlimited window run of these things what what do you think.

[29:34] I mean I was hoping they'd be limited but I heard that they're they're not.

[29:53] But who knows now you know after this they've now had a good month to hear the feedback on that decision so maybe they changed their mind it's an easy decision to adjust it doesn't require anything.

[30:08] So some people have put the positives down.

[30:11] But but like it's weird.

[30:23] I don't know.

[30:25] I don't know.

[30:31] I guess what I'm confused about is dealers don't know what their allocation is yet.

[30:43] And also like nobody's supposed to be taking deposits like Jersey Jack won't allow deposits to be submitted like they you know what I'm saying like they never officially opened up the order banks for the game.

[30:59] So I'm I don't know.

[31:03] Now you remember you remember what I said initially like if it was limited to a thousand I said that Harry Potter C.E.s would sell for 18 to 20,000 right away but I don't know now.

[31:19] So you know me I mean I want to I want to grab one if there's only going to be a thousand I don't want to grab one if there's 5,000 not right away again.

[31:39] Yes because this time I'm allowed to speculate and make a little little money.

[31:46] We'll see what happens I mean none of none of pinball pinball speculating now is like it's over like it doesn't doesn't really exist.

[31:58] It's not it's not also just not fun anymore.

[32:01] It's not fun anymore like it all used to be much more fun it used to be easy it used to be.

[32:09] And we were we were all less greedy we weren't a holes about it. Now it is it's like I don't know the whole thing is turned into like you can't you can't scalp anymore everyone's crying like babies you can't.

[32:24] You can't test the market on anything you know the only thing you're allowed to do is buy a new box and use a ton of money that's the only thing you're allowed to do anything else make a game to scalp it for money people go nuts they they scream the all high heaven about you.

[32:37] I'm one of my boys are one year old and four so they love pop patrol and milk so or form you so like.

[32:57] Albert you know you know what you need to tell your kids though sorry we can't afford this.

[33:06] I mean I heard that the whole time I was growing up.

[33:11] It's an expensive machine.

[33:18] All right.

[33:20] Should we talk about.

[33:24] I mean spooky there's not too much to say evil dead is doing great beetle juice is next.

[33:32] Can I give you guys what I heard is after beetle juice.

[33:39] Can I can I just give this to you now is in an exclusive it's this you know am I going to is no one else going to say I said it is someone going to write a story or go on inside that they said it first.

[33:52] Now it's so what I'm hearing from a very trusted source.

[33:58] Who knows people over there.

[34:04] And now um.

[34:07] Franchise teaser on the box makes sense.

[34:13] Spooky's next to will be beetle juice.

[34:17] And then gremlins.

[34:22] So they have the gremlins license.

[34:26] And wouldn't that be a sweet holiday treat.

[34:30] I'm not going to release gremlins.

[34:33] And I heard.

[34:36] That if you get the game wet.

[34:39] Another game pops out of it.

[34:45] So.

[34:48] Two iconic nostalgic.

[34:53] Fun.

[34:56] And when you say who wants gremlins I mean I I I will take a gremlins pinball machine.

[35:01] Brian I think you underestimate the value of 80s.

[35:05] And 90s nostalgia with this audience.

[35:11] Like who would it want to gremlins.

[35:14] You got again just thinking about what makes a game fun.

[35:19] Look how much fun everyone's having with evil dead a theme that's not as much fun as gremlins.

[35:24] For most people.

[35:34] It's hard to you can't say evil dead is more fun than gremlins is a pin because you haven't seen the gremlins pin.

[35:46] I would assume there will be gremlins too in it as well.

[35:52] I could see them letting you pick one movie or the other.

[36:03] They're both going to sell out day one.

[36:06] I don't even.

[36:09] I think getting a spooky game is harder to get than a stern mish stern alley moving forward.

[36:18] I mean that I think spooky's next two games are going to be harder to get than a stern alley than a JJPC.

[36:38] Why wouldn't anybody want a poltergeist pinball machine guys like that movie I get it but it's not fun.

[36:44] It's not a fun movie.

[36:47] You know what they they know now it's all about the campiness that matters not like you know and look and Friday the 13th is campy so is nightmare and elm street but what's not campy is poltergeist.

[37:03] What's not campy is like saw you know what I'm saying like it's not like it's just why why doesn't spooky go to an unlimited model because they don't want to go out of business because who would buy what.

[37:24] Joseph think about the enane as of what you just said why why would they do that.

[37:30] Why would they just tank the second hand value of all of their games what to make people happy three years down the road.

[37:38] Because the only people you're making happy then are the newbies who come in years after the game came out but sorry newbie you gotta go find one used and that use games going to hold a lot of value why would they say we're going to make like gang.

[37:53] You know Joseph you know this hobby man like that is that is the worst move of a boutique can make is to say we're going to make as many as people want for the rest of our company's existence.

[38:03] Okay so then nobody buys.

[38:07] Why would they do that but why would they do that Joseph why would they five years down the road just tank all the value of people who bought their products why.

[38:24] They didn't even come close to selling out of evil that until like it started to feel like they're weren't going to be that many left.

[38:33] But they're doing it right they're doing it right they're doing it right and they when they pushed higher a scubi do nobody wants one.

[38:45] You know what I'm saying.

[38:49] Now you want them to act like stern and have a pro in an Ellie model Joseph you are literally waking up with the worst ideas imaginable you want this company that's in the driver's seat doing everything right marketing wise to adapt a model of stern that is basically got stern in it turns in big trouble now because of of they have no no perceived second.

[39:14] And then you can hand value whatsoever on any other models now.

[39:19] So no Joseph seriously I don't know what the day job is brother but don't go into marketing don't give pinball companies ideas.

[39:34] Yeah.

[39:35] You don't you you you could type all you want brother just tell it you.

[39:39] I'm going to you know it's just a bad idea.

[39:44] All right so let's talk out of this is adventures in Wonderland ones up for sale after being played 20 times.

[39:53] Oh this game continues to be like hmm you know it's like.

[40:06] Yeah I'm like Melvin's a really good friend.

[40:08] You want to my best buddies in pinball speak to him on this daily.

[40:13] All right he knows what he made I know what he made.

[40:19] And it's just if you if you appreciate the game.

[40:27] For what it is not what and don't look for it to be something it isn't.

[40:33] I think you'll enjoy your Alice's adventures in Wonderland but this is the big but.

[40:40] It won't be a collectible.

[40:44] It won't be hard to get.

[40:48] It won't be sought after.

[40:51] It doesn't have a story or a pedigree.

[40:56] It will always be a little bit of a strange game to own.

[41:04] Okay just just the truth of it it's a novelty item he knows it that's why he made it.

[41:11] He didn't make it to have code like a stern.

[41:16] He made it to prove that he could turn this.

[41:24] Styrofoam white you know foam core game.

[41:30] It's a beautiful art package into something working with you know playable code and real mix and you know take john's.

[41:41] Doodle and turn it into a working game and he he succeeded in doing that.

[41:46] Just my whole background is a predator tease.

[41:49] That is what Alice is it is a it's saved Dutch pinball.

[41:54] It's amazing to me that people don't realize that is really the real impact of Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[42:02] It's not about making john's phone core into a real game.

[42:05] It's the game that saved Dutch pinball and made it so that Dutch pinball can survive to get to back to the future.

[42:15] Because they had nothing and demand for Lebowski is over and they would have gone out of business because there would be nothing to make for a year.

[42:29] And their burn monthly would have been like 150,000 euros a month to make nothing.

[42:40] So thank you Melvin for saving Dutch and we're going to get touches back to the future they're they're making back to the future they did not sign a deal with anybody.

[42:50] Both Jersey Jack and Stern were very interested in trying to acquire the license and.

[42:58] Barry just want it more money than they offered.

[43:04] I think it's not even about the money I think it's about the.

[43:08] It's just about the pride and legacy and.

[43:14] Just the sense of like you know we're not like them like we do games differently.

[43:21] I expect a really interesting back to the future game.

[43:28] Yeah I mean I mean Stern would have just like thrown in L win zombie Eddie and.

[43:35] Nagle they don't say like Stern would have just like.

[43:39] I just feel like Stern back to the future would have just it would just end up looking like a comic book for some reason I don't know why I'm saying that but I just feel like they would have just been like this.

[43:48] Ultra colorful rainbow comic book looking version of back to the future.

[43:56] You know franchi what's interesting and welcome to the show franchi what's interesting about Stern's passing on that title is is really I don't know about you man and the rest of you guys I still don't know what the hell they were thinking.

[44:16] I don't understand like if George even ran that opportunity by the design team I feel like the entire decision was made in a vacuum somewhere and nobody.

[44:32] How did nobody be like what what why would we pass on this like.

[44:38] I don't understand and I think they're I think they're going to kick themselves because I don't think they're going to sell as many Pokemon as people think.

[44:49] And I don't know Star Wars has got a lot of pressure riding on it.

[44:59] Well they they were they were trying to sell the Gen Z kids.

[45:07] Gen Z kids you know poor kids is like it's like the generation that time forgot but all these kids in front of social media they're not nostalgic from movies the way we were they don't they don't need to be like they're instant access it's crazy sometimes when you're on Netflix and you suggest how much content there is like these kids.

[45:28] Can't sit through a two hour movie and it's not like they're all watching the same movie and the movies don't forge indelible impressions in them and you know they're just they're so distracted when we watched back to the future for the first time.

[45:45] There's no internet we went to the mall to see it we saw it like eight times when when it was at blockbuster we rented it we watched it another hundred times.

[45:56] When the second movie came out it blew us away we saw like special effects and we saw things we never seen before we dreamed of hoverboards we dreamed of Pepsi perfect we.

[46:06] We literally all wanted a sports all men act we we you know like and the way these movies back then just connect it with everybody and it was wasn't just like back to the future is like you're talking like a decade of just incredible music and movies and optimism and.

[46:24] The all of it is connected the fall of communism in Russia the Berlin wall this feeling of like the most amazing decade one of the most amazing decades in all of humanity.

[46:38] Gen Z kids you got to remember they're born in the 2000s post you know they're born in a post 9 11 world then they experienced the recession then they got terrorism and then they got social media and like all of it.

[46:53] On top of each other and it's like they're you know it's miserable decades for for them.

[47:03] You know for good the rest of us like we still have an nostalgia for the 80s and the 90s but these kids don't have that so like all they have is like what was put in front of them which was basically a cell phone.

[47:19] You ever see people watch like like on tiktok you ever watch anybody just like death scroll for like two hours it's it's like just this scary thing to watch.

[47:30] Just like this endorphin releasing what like you're just you're just constantly on to the next like.

[47:38] WAPIT thing about something you you're in you because it knows you and using AI algorithms to just distract you and then before you know you spend two hours.

[47:49] Nothing you didn't really have many emotional reactions other than the endorphin releasing addiction to that kind of snackable content you're watching movie clips cut up you're watching sports moments cut up you're watching car clips cut up everything's just like.

[48:05] This is like abbreviated edited version of something so you know you're not going to watch the wolf of Wall Street ever but you'll see the clips from it you know we're we're memifying every movie so they're not going to watch jobs but they might see a little clip of it.

[48:22] You know so it is what it is.

[48:27] Pimballs for us old geezers.

[48:29] Alright but to put a bow on Alice's adventures in Wonderland I don't think they're going to make all 500 I think you'll see more like 400 450 at most.

[48:43] Where they 12 5 I think you'll you'll be able to get one for 10 I think the basement on that game is around like 10.

[48:53] Maybe a little lower it's it's not going to be like Godfather C ease losing six six thousand dollars.

[49:08] Alright barrels of fun.

[49:11] Thank you we'll move on the barrels then you know I got to end the show in a little bit.

[49:18] Here's the thing about barrels of fun.

[49:22] I just can't I just don't see much conversation happening I don't know like where the dunes are going they just aren't going into people's homes.

[49:31] Has anyone unboxed a barrels of fun like I look literally the owners club doesn't even have not only does it not have two pages.

[49:41] It doesn't even have like eight posts in it.

[49:47] So I'm still confused I'm still very confused.

[49:52] Why this company released the game when they did.

[49:56] I don't I don't feel like anyone's getting any of them.

[50:00] It is an absolute like reveal and nothing's going out to people.

[50:09] But I heard they're selling like decently I was talking to a major distributor they sold 40 of them.

[50:18] I mean that's just one distro selling 40 games is not bad.

[50:24] Forget do discuss their next.

[50:29] Well you know I'm under this like NDA so like I don't I don't know what's next.

[50:34] I have to assume they have goonies.

[50:39] And I have to assume they have goonies.

[50:44] And all the teasing it in plain sight stuff has all been part of that.

[50:51] I've heard multiple times that goonies is an open license that.

[50:59] It's ostensibly more than one company can make it.

[51:04] But I also know that like the licensing issues with goonies might make it difficult to make the game.

[51:10] So maybe they're not even going to make it getting all the actors and getting their approval is probably extremely difficult.

[51:24] I don't know I don't like.

[51:31] I don't think boutiques of this nature can kind of.

[51:39] Like you can't launch a game like like this. It just doesn't work.

[51:46] I still don't know how to evaluate doon. I think it's still a game that's like too early for release.

[51:56] Yeah what happened to you saying yeah I think someone said they saw a big pirate ship and I you know what it is Brian.

[52:07] I don't know. I don't know.

[52:11] I don't know how much bad information I get at times.

[52:18] Can hate it have it. Welcome to reweating Connecticut.

[52:26] Got my custom says it on my hat too.

[52:30] I love this down. This is heaven. This is heaven on earth.

[52:36] I think song was heaven on earth. Berlin the carlile. That was our first dance Brenda and I and I'll tell you the.

[52:44] I've always loved the song but I'll tell you the thing we saw that just like.

[52:48] It kind of had both of us in in tears like in a good way. You know I love Brenda more than anything and.

[52:54] There is that one black mirror episode.

[52:58] Where these two women like fall in love with each other.

[53:05] And ones an old woman.

[53:08] And the.

[53:11] The place they choose to meet back because they in the black mirror episode you can kind of.

[53:19] You can you can dream.

[53:22] So vividly that it makes it feel real and you can go visit.

[53:29] Someone you loved at another time in your life that was just.

[53:34] Magic right in heaven and they decide to meet up.

[53:39] In a nineteen eighties simulated world with arcades and.

[53:46] And they're like a sheep wranglers and they're right on the beach.

[53:52] And this song just plays at the end heaven is a place on earth and it's just like.

[53:58] I don't know you know you you you get thinking about.

[54:02] You know how especially you have kids like how fast time flies and how.

[54:08] I don't know we wake way so much time and like when you find someone or something you love like and.

[54:15] You know you you we all dream that like we could we could.

[54:18] Always find each other again and in that beautiful time and I think what.

[54:23] What always makes me feel so like.

[54:27] Nostalgic for like that time was just the.

[54:33] The ability to be present in in.

[54:37] In life.

[54:40] You know you know I'm saying like you just were there.

[54:43] You didn't watch it on YouTube you didn't record it on your phone.

[54:48] We were just there and we didn't know you know it sucks is like we didn't know then like.

[54:54] That that all that would be robbed from us.

[54:58] And so if I could go back with Brenda.

[55:01] And you know I love like our falling in love with that girl.

[55:05] In New York City was like the greatest.

[55:08] Like time of my life.

[55:11] Well you know I take that back I feel like now I'm just with children.

[55:15] I just love every.

[55:18] I just love being happy and waking up in it you know next is someone that.

[55:23] Is everything and I you know.

[55:27] My point was about the song heaven is a place on.

[55:29] Anyway you should watch that episode it's called like San Genero or something like that.

[55:34] Can you get it in the heaven ever since he asked where is the magic.

[55:57] Where were we we're talking about doing so.

[56:02] Yeah dude I don't know man.

[56:05] I don't know I don't know how barrels of fun just gets.

[56:09] Gets the enthusiasm for this game back.

[56:16] San Junipero yep.

[56:24] You know I got to say I'm going to wrap up in a little bit because I got to.

[56:28] I got to go get.

[56:30] Killian ready for he's marching in the.

[56:36] Memorial day parade.

[56:39] And he's marching with his T ball team adorable.

[56:45] Dune flipper was broken after a couple of plays.

[56:48] I someone sent me a photo of King Kong's arm fell off.

[56:52] So look things happen in games like things break I.

[56:56] The days of like.

[56:59] Something mechanically goes wrong with the pin and we scream like like they're all going to fall apart is not true.

[57:07] Memorial day weekend.

[57:09] I love it.

[57:10] I love it.

[57:12] I love this country.

[57:14] I do.

[57:15] I can't lie.

[57:19] You know it's a.

[57:22] The world's much better than the world you read about on the news.

[57:25] It really is.

[57:27] The media has been slanted so negative to make everybody afraid to just like step outside.

[57:37] I mean there's always bank holidays in Europe.

[57:40] It's ridiculous.

[57:41] You ever go to Europe.

[57:42] You ever see how many bank holidays are in Europe.

[57:45] Try to get someone working in August in Europe.

[57:47] I mean, it's all about those who served and you know sacrifices that were made and anyone you study his history is just it's mind boggling to me that these.

[58:05] Again, I'm going to go up on a little bit of a soap box here, but.

[58:08] The biggest.

[58:14] The biggest.

[58:15] The biggest.

[58:16] Most cynical.

[58:17] Most crybaby.

[58:18] You know they're in America.

[58:20] I think about this.

[58:21] They're in America.

[58:22] With the greatest education.

[58:26] Institutions at their.

[58:27] You know, at their disposal.

[58:29] They they can.

[58:31] Instead of.

[58:33] They're trying to make America better or embracing where they are realizing how lucky they have it.

[58:38] They they complain about everything.

[58:40] They hate the country.

[58:41] They say go live somewhere else.

[58:43] Go see how it is.

[58:44] Go see what opportunities are there for you somewhere else.

[58:50] There's just so it's so easy to be here and complain about being here because we give you the freedom to complain about being here.

[58:56] That's the beauty of America.

[58:58] Right.

[58:59] And I do believe in free speech and you know, absolutely like we will the whole point of free speech is that we will.

[59:04] Protect the speech that we don't want to hear like you need to.

[59:10] But that being said, I can still judge you.

[59:12] I can still think you're a jackass and I can still say if you don't like it here, go leave the amount of people.

[59:19] I mean, I deal with this all the time too like at work.

[59:21] They're just.

[59:22] You could just tell this like anti-American sentiment and it's.

[59:26] It's weird to me because you always got to put the country above.

[59:31] Above a political figure like America is bigger than any political party or any any any politician America.

[59:40] Is a melting pot.

[59:42] America is a.

[59:44] A very diverse place that no other country in the world.

[59:50] Even comes close to reflecting.

[59:55] What this country is.

[59:57] Now some people are better in Sweden.

[59:59] It's better in.

[01:00:00] Okay.

[01:00:01] You want to go to Sweden where there's only like 9 million people in a monochromatic society.

[01:00:07] There's more people.

[01:00:08] There's twice as many people in the New York City.

[01:00:13] That's what I'm saying when you travel the world.

[01:00:16] I do think this.

[01:00:17] I think when you travel the world.

[01:00:19] You will definitely have a newfound appreciation for America.

[01:00:22] But you also definitely realize some of the things we need to work on.

[01:00:26] And I definitely agree with that.

[01:00:28] I think America.

[01:00:29] Americans are like way too stressed out.

[01:00:34] We work way too hard.

[01:00:37] I do believe we have way too many guns in the country.

[01:00:40] Like what's everybody got?

[01:00:41] Why do we need like all these guns?

[01:00:43] Like who's everybody fighting?

[01:00:45] It's way too easy to get your hands on stuff like that.

[01:00:48] But there's just.

[01:00:52] We drive way too big of a vehicle.

[01:00:55] Do you ever see the size of the cars everywhere else in the world?

[01:00:58] What are we doing?

[01:01:00] Why are we plowing down the street in these like monstrosities?

[01:01:04] And most of the time there's nobody in them.

[01:01:09] I don't know.

[01:01:18] I get to see like your perspective is all about where you are.

[01:01:21] I see Brennan getting the kids ready.

[01:01:23] I hope it doesn't rain.

[01:01:25] It's starting to get like.

[01:01:28] Yes, there's one of those days where the car was clean.

[01:01:31] It was sunny.

[01:01:32] I went for a walk into the village to get killings of ice cream.

[01:01:35] And then all of a sudden it just starts down boring.

[01:01:37] I'm like car out of my car.

[01:01:39] Gosh.

[01:01:45] The demon is the demons of the demons of four cedar though.

[01:01:49] It's not a.

[01:01:52] The reason the demon is like the demon is America.

[01:01:55] American muscle cars.

[01:01:57] I don't know.

[01:01:58] Like these big SUVs that lose so much value.

[01:02:01] It's correct.

[01:02:02] You think you think pins lose money.

[01:02:04] I don't know.

[01:02:07] I don't know.

[01:02:14] I don't know.

[01:02:16] I don't know.

[01:02:18] I'm fully loaded like SUV for like $140,000 and see what it's worth in four years.

[01:02:22] It'll be worth like 60.

[01:02:25] Anyway, everybody look.

[01:02:27] I don't know.

[01:02:28] I know we didn't cover every company.

[01:02:31] We got to talk a decent amount about pinball a little bit about life.

[01:02:34] You know how it is here.

[01:02:37] I really do think we're going to get a lot of stuff predator, potter.

[01:02:44] We didn't even talk about totems coming back from Padrete Gaming any day now.

[01:02:48] There's just a lot of medieval madness.

[01:02:51] Merlin editions are going to ship when I don't know.

[01:02:55] But man, it's it's it's about to get it's oversaturated.

[01:03:00] I think the oversaturation is leading to a lot of people is somewhat.

[01:03:04] You know, you know, you know, you know, it's like Kong's not bad at all.

[01:03:09] But like I still think a lot more people are walking up to games now.

[01:03:12] Being like you kind of know you don't want to buy it.

[01:03:15] So you're going to see the game through that lens of like, yeah,

[01:03:18] you're going to look for reasons why you don't want to buy it.

[01:03:21] You know, because these games are not giving you enough to want to pull the trigger on it right away.

[01:03:24] And I think that's where we're at.

[01:03:26] And I think for games to really be like, oh, I got to own this.

[01:03:29] You know, you've got to have more of an experience.

[01:03:32] I think when people are walking up to like an evil dead versus a king Kong.

[01:03:36] I mean it.

[01:03:37] I just mean it.

[01:03:38] When I saw evil dead for the first time, I was like, wow, like really stood out.

[01:03:42] You didn't even feel that way about avatar.

[01:03:44] Didn't feel that way about Kong.

[01:03:46] Didn't feel that way about D and D.

[01:03:48] I just think we're there now.

[01:03:50] Like I need to be.

[01:03:51] It needs to have that extra something.

[01:03:54] And I just don't think Kong has it.

[01:03:56] All right.

[01:03:57] What about Turner?

[01:03:58] No, no one.

[01:03:59] Maryland's okay.

[01:04:00] They're not selling more than like 100 of those like Chris Turner.

[01:04:03] He needs to call me up.

[01:04:06] Make me a salary employee.

[01:04:09] There's something weird going on with Chris Turner and Deeproot though too.

[01:04:12] What I mean by that, like he's like in on the deeproot court filings.

[01:04:16] Like I don't know if like Robert Mueller is like.

[01:04:21] Still connected to him somehow.

[01:04:23] I don't know.

[01:04:24] It's just there's like this weird thing with like was he just like delivering the snacks to Deeproot.

[01:04:31] Now he's got a pinball call like what is the what what what's going on.

[01:04:36] I don't know.

[01:04:37] There's something behind all of it.

[01:04:44] But I got to go be a family man.

[01:04:46] All right.

[01:04:47] Everybody be good.

[01:04:48] Time to get killing into the into the parade.
