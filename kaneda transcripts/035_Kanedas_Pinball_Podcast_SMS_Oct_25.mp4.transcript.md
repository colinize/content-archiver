[00:00] You got to keep it together.

[00:05] How's everybody doing?

[00:09] A little late, but I'm just trying to figure something out.

[00:13] I hate.

[00:14] Are you looking?

[00:16] Are you looking good?

[00:17] We're looking good.

[00:18] We feeling good.

[00:20] It's a beautiful day.

[00:21] I mean, it's absolutely a beautiful day.

[00:24] Hope everybody's doing well.

[00:27] I'm trying.

[00:30] I'm trying to get a sense of, um, my hat crooked.

[00:35] There we go.

[00:37] A kung fu Louie baby kung fu Louie.

[00:41] How's everybody doing?

[00:43] Happy Saturday morning.

[00:45] You enjoyed the wap show.

[00:48] Good.

[00:49] I enjoyed making it.

[00:50] I think everybody enjoyed listening to it.

[00:53] And it really was long overdoing.

[00:56] I think it was nice to have, um,

[00:59] just to be connected again and not have any.

[01:02] Bad blood between any of the content creators out there.

[01:06] You know, I really feel like I get along with everybody now in the

[01:09] content space for the most part.

[01:11] There's no.

[01:12] There's no drama happening anywhere.

[01:15] The only guy that I just, I really, I just, you know, I don't care anymore.

[01:19] It's just Colin.

[01:20] I just, what it is, what it is, but I don't really care.

[01:25] How's everybody doing?

[01:27] How's everybody doing?

[01:29] Happy, um, happy Saturday morning.

[01:31] I'm your host, Kaneda here.

[01:33] We're going to go for about an hour here.

[01:35] There's, uh, it's, it's a bit of, um,

[01:38] it's a bit of a beautiful day.

[01:40] And I'm trying to figure something out.

[01:41] Maybe you guys can help me.

[01:42] I'm trying to figure something out.

[01:43] I'm trying to figure out how to get this big heavyweight UFC fight today.

[01:50] Like, I hate the modern streaming world.

[01:54] I want me to put the franchise shirt on.

[01:59] Hold on.

[02:00] Let me, let me, I can go put that on.

[02:02] Hold on one second, everybody.

[02:03] Hold on, hold on.

[02:06] Franchise shirt coming up.

[02:10] I think you're going to drop out.

[02:40] I'm going to drop out.

[02:42] All right.

[02:43] We got it on now.

[02:45] 10th anniversary.

[02:48] Franchise artwork.

[02:52] I like it.

[02:53] I like the large two, man.

[02:55] I'm like, I'm always working.

[02:56] Like, medium is my size, but like everyone's in a house to have like a nice comfortable baggy shirt, you know?

[03:02] I feel like the last thing you want on a weekend is, is, is, is any tight clothing.

[03:09] 10 years of Frenchy.

[03:11] Move the mic out of the way a little bit so we can see it.

[03:13] The 10th anniversary.

[03:15] Congratulations, brother.

[03:17] I can't wait to see Beetlejuice.

[03:23] How's everybody doing?

[03:24] Hi from Barcelona.

[03:26] Saturday morning here.

[03:28] I'm going to talk for about an hour about what's going on in Pimball.

[03:31] And, you know, it's, it's an interesting time.

[03:33] I've been, I just did a show this morning.

[03:36] And I think we're all kind of really looking forward to seeing what these boutique companies are going to put out in the Pimball world.

[03:45] Stern is in a little bit of a tailspin.

[03:47] It's funny to watch Stern having to, to correct the ship.

[03:52] They, they seemingly, I just think that their strategy just wore thin.

[03:59] And they set themselves up for short term profitability to cook the books to sell that company during COVID.

[04:07] And it, it's now backfire because they didn't get the sale.

[04:10] And now they don't have like a way to validate their extremely high prices.

[04:15] And because the secondary market on their products have just collapsed.

[04:19] It's like you really, you mean you really do have to be a sucker to buy a Stern new inbox these days.

[04:24] I really don't understand it.

[04:26] They, you know, their only way out is either to lower prices or make amazing games.

[04:31] And they, they just feel like they're just, they've got nothing left.

[04:37] Fall of the Empire is true.

[04:39] I mean, we're all watching it.

[04:41] It's, it's funny too because this is all of their own making.

[04:45] They, they legitimately made so many mistakes in a row.

[04:50] And, and now all of it is collectively caught up to them.

[04:54] And, and I just think they, they're going to struggle.

[04:57] They need a move.

[04:58] You know what I'm saying? They need to move.

[05:00] They need a move that's going to really reinstate them as being the best game.

[05:09] You know, like volume, whatever.

[05:11] We know they're the biggest manufacturer.

[05:13] But come on gang in life.

[05:15] Do you go to McDonald's for the best burger in town?

[05:20] Do you go to.

[05:24] You know, Honda for the most enjoyable car experience.

[05:29] You know, so again, I just think Stern tried to do both.

[05:33] They try to be volume and exclusivity and premium pricing all at once.

[05:39] And it's just caught up to them.

[05:41] So, you know, I think it's a good thing to have a good time.

[05:45] High prices and mediocre games equals struggles.

[05:49] Yeah. What's up? You're in Kyoto, man.

[05:53] No, no.

[05:55] Dude, man, Kyoto is like I really am so jealous that you're in Kyoto right now.

[06:01] I would love to be there.

[06:03] Absolutely incredible location to be.

[06:06] Stern be more like white cast.

[06:08] Yeah, I mean, it's crazy.

[06:12] It is absolutely crazy.

[06:15] Like I think there's going to be a really interesting week.

[06:20] I know a little stuff I can't say everything about,

[06:23] but I think we're going to get a sense of when Beetlejuice is going to drop this week.

[06:28] I think we're also going to see if these Winchester mystery houses arrived to customers be four Thanksgiving.

[06:37] Why do I say Thanksgiving before Halloween before Halloween?

[06:43] I'm in the thread and everyone speculating on whether or not Winchester is going to go up in value or not.

[06:50] You know, normal conversation at this stage.

[06:53] You got a very limited run game.

[06:55] You got a game that's 11 6 gang. It's not cheap.

[06:58] And what's going to happen now and I don't know about most of you guys.

[07:03] But do most of you guys are you really in a situation where you can just be cut in like 20 grand in one month for Pima machine 25,000 dollars for two Pima machines.

[07:12] You know what I'm saying?

[07:13] Because if you go Winchester and spooky.

[07:16] You know, Stern's also going to I think try to sell the walking dead on top of these two games.

[07:21] This is the issue.

[07:23] This is the issue. What's up, man?

[07:29] The issue is like right now, I think walking dead Winchester and Beetlejuice within a four week period.

[07:36] They're going to be asking people for deposits and maybe potentially payment and fall.

[07:42] And it's funny because when you think about whether it's Winchester or Beetlejuice or walking dead remastered.

[07:47] I mean, it's the Stern machine that everyone's going to be like, yeah, and do I need it?

[07:52] I'm looking at every single Stern.

[07:55] Because walking dead remastered is not going to hit like Metallica remaster.

[07:59] This is not. It was never as good as a game as Metallica.

[08:03] Metallica got the band involved with the remastered game walking dead.

[08:07] What are they going to get? What do you think?

[08:08] You think Norman Reedus is in on it?

[08:09] You think they're going to get like the show clips?

[08:11] I mean, I highly doubt it.

[08:14] Also culturally Metallica is still Metallica, right? Metallica music.

[08:18] The game is all the iconic songs. Metallica will always be cool.

[08:23] Walking dead in my honest opinion has kind of lost its cultural cachet and culture.

[08:28] Like I just don't think people care anymore.

[08:33] And Beetlejuice is iconic.

[08:35] You know, there's a difference. Like you certain things are iconic.

[08:38] Certain things have lasted 40 years and are still like iconic.

[08:43] Tim Burton, Beetlejuice, iconic. Metallica music, iconic.

[08:47] Guns of Rose's music, iconic.

[08:51] The Walking Dead.

[08:54] It's not iconic anymore.

[08:59] What game will have more skeletons Metallica or Walking Dead?

[09:03] You know, it's going to be a real interesting.

[09:10] The price is going to be everything on Walking Dead, right?

[09:13] Will Stern use the Walking Dead remastered to usher in full spike three

[09:18] and will we see a price increase?

[09:21] I love that they're so terrified of this price increase

[09:27] that they really don't know how to do it.

[09:30] They don't know how to do it.

[09:32] Like what Stern should have done normally like normal tech company

[09:35] because they talk about themselves as a tech company.

[09:38] I don't disagree with that.

[09:41] It's a different kind of tech.

[09:43] But what Stern should have done was had a very apple-like introduction of spike three

[09:47] in which they went over all of the features and all of what's to come,

[09:50] all at once.

[09:53] This sort of half rollout of spike three, not really a fan of it.

[10:00] Came with wife for three weeks.

[10:03] Yeah, man.

[10:04] Narrow's amazing.

[10:05] Kyo does amazing.

[10:06] Tokyo's amazing.

[10:07] Look, you did it right, man.

[10:08] Any advice on Tokyo?

[10:12] Don't stay in Ginza.

[10:16] Go to the arcade and Akubara.

[10:19] The markets are amazing.

[10:22] Go to the Tokyo fish market and have some Otoro right off the catch on the boat.

[10:30] All the foods amazing in Japan.

[10:32] You don't have to spend a ton.

[10:34] But really just enjoy it, man.

[10:37] Go to Pisali and just get wasted on sake and whiskey.

[10:41] And then go have like an amazing meal and just enjoy life, man.

[10:45] There's no more.

[10:48] There is no culture that leads with class and respect and cleanliness and a culture out there that actually puts.

[11:00] The society and the community first now, then Japan.

[11:03] I mean, I, for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about,

[11:08] you need to go visit Japan.

[11:10] You need to go to a Japanese owned establishment and see the level of just class and respect and friendliness that you just don't get anywhere else.

[11:23] It's incredible.

[11:25] I mean, the world in a way like needs a reset and unfortunately, you know, Japan reset after World War II.

[11:31] And unfortunately, it's looking like the world is heading in that direction that we're not going to ever reset.

[11:37] Culture until we hit rock bottom again.

[11:41] Hey, canator, recently started listening to some of the older podcasts while driving your right more than you were wrong.

[11:49] I mean, well, look.

[11:52] Is it Eric or can you see eerie, eerie arcade?

[11:56] I thank you. I think that I've been more on point than off.

[12:02] And I think people listen to the show because it's just a different opinion.

[12:05] It's an opinion that's always been about looking out for us as consumers and looking out for the community and also just speculating on the market.

[12:15] It's been fun.

[12:16] I don't really care about manufacturer relationships per se.

[12:20] I'm not a shilling product because I sell them not yet.

[12:25] Maybe one day, right?

[12:30] The last of us made everyone forget about the walking dead.

[12:33] I don't know, man, I feel like the last of us is turned into like a wolf BS show that nobody cares about either.

[12:39] That's the last I heard about the last of us.

[12:42] The problem with the last of a show.

[12:46] I stopped watching it. I just can't.

[12:51] I can't actually take seriously that you're going to try to have like a hundred pound woman can beat the crap out of like a 200 pound man or 250 pound man.

[13:03] Like literally like how? How in what world is this happen?

[13:08] Hollywood.

[13:10] You know what I'm saying? And then once the main character got killed forget it. I feel like everyone's moved on.

[13:17] Did you take down your playlist DJ remix needs re uploading love that.

[13:24] My 80s mix the long 80s mix.

[13:29] Let me see if it's still a ten eight is I don't think it's down hold on.

[13:38] I think it's still a let me see.

[13:42] Soundcloud.

[13:46] Drop it in the chat for you. Clowns. Let's see.

[13:53] Just looking right now.

[13:59] I love the picture of Jack holding.

[14:03] I'll get it back up if it's not there now spooky looks in the house.

[14:16] So have you played doon yet?

[14:19] Wayne no. I haven't gone to automate it to play more dune.

[14:29] The when I when I know you're on a mission to sell these doon machines but when here's the deal.

[14:36] Wayne they've sold less dunes and Winchester.

[14:40] I don't understand like that is that is that is an abysmal failure.

[14:45] In two days Winchester mystery house outsold dune in six months.

[14:51] But hey Wayne ordered Wayne got eight people or 12 people the by one.

[14:57] Yeah well you know I my show didn't go exactly as planned.

[15:04] And I I didn't really play anything much on Friday because I just when I when I got escorted out of the hall or the or the the game room if you will.

[15:23] If I got when I got escorted out of expo and all that drama went down that wasn't necessary.

[15:28] I just kind of didn't care to go back into the room.

[15:32] I know barrels had a separate room with the games in it.

[15:36] But I'll tell you how my day went so that happened.

[15:41] Then I like literally had a leave at three o'clock.

[15:50] 3 3 30 to get to a 5 30 dinner in downtown Chicago we had an amazing Omokase meal from 5 30 to like 7 30.

[16:01] And then we were back at the expo by 8 30.

[16:06] I was just a little bit just to say hi to some people but then I didn't really want to hang out there and then I went to the bar for a little bit went to the piano for a little bit.

[16:16] And I just kind of roamed around outside of the show.

[16:22] I just I just again I was kind of I got to be honest I was on.

[16:30] I was I was feeling good. I had a bunch of sake a bunch of whiskey's I was like I had a good buzz going you ever have a good buzz going.

[16:43] And like I mean this when I say this I had a good buzz going I was having a great time.

[16:49] And I they they did not try and kick me out I'm just a gang this is the last time I'm going to tell this real quick story.

[16:56] Again I'm not even going to mention names anymore there was an individual that took it upon himself to grab a security guy went a rob security guys to say that I was banned from expo for life and I wasn't allowed in the show I wasn't doing anything I didn't even confront this individual.

[17:12] He came out he came up to me he found me at the show.

[17:16] He escorted me out with security at around 10 30 in the morning 11 o'clock in the morning the hotel security guy that runs the whole hotel security guy reached out to rob Burke and Bridget who said no that's not true.

[17:31] He does not have authority to kick.

[17:33] He kicked can a the out of the show he was told that he walked away he didn't apologize to me and the hotel security guy said Chris like like I don't know what to tell you other than you're fine but I would just avoid that gentleman and his friend.

[17:49] And so when I'm told that that I you know that's awkward right it's an awkward thing to be told to have to do it you know it's a tiny little show so I decided like they're cool I I don't even want to go back in so like I didn't I didn't really go back in.

[18:09] So it is what it is right and like as I said before like I don't know the guy I don't know what I did to that guy and I know he's friends with like Glenn and I'm sure there's a whole like thing there and it is what it is so but again like as I said in my last show.

[18:26] I hold no ill will towards that individual I don't know what I did to him I tried to call him a few times before the show to to you know to settle any grievances he may have had with me to which he never picked up the phone or respond it so I don't I don't really care to.

[18:47] You know and I don't want anyone to do anything to that individual I don't think anybody should I don't think other people should fight other people's fights I don't think there even is a fight in this situation I just think it's an unfortunate thing to be at a show having such a good time and then to have been.

[19:03] Sort of like you know.

[19:06] Embarrassed if you will like that after all the work I do for for content and and all the good times we're having so that's it.

[19:17] It was bug from spooky I like I don't think anyone should be banned from the show you know I don't think anybody should be banned from the show I don't think anybody should be.

[19:27] I think it's like here here's my take on all this if there's people that you don't like we know we're not little woke babies.

[19:37] If there's people that you don't like at a show instead of like crying to show up or you know security or robberk that you're not going to go if they're there.

[19:50] Just of just go and don't interact with them you know what I'm saying that that to me like that's the mature adult thing to do like if I don't like I don't let's just say for example if I don't like this pinball manufacturer then I'm just not going to walk over to that area and I'm just not going to walk over to that area.

[20:07] I'm just not going to walk over to that area and hang around that manufacturer or I'm not going to go seek out that individual.

[20:14] I think what was frustrating for me is is I didn't interact with said individuals they simply saw me they're having a good time and they seeked me out to single me out to throw me out of the show.

[20:30] Again I don't it was not robberk it wasn't anyone affiliate with the show and it was over in 10 minutes it was all over in 10 minutes but you know it can sometimes only take 10 minutes to make you feel like you're not want it somewhere or awkward or whatever.

[20:49] Did you and Ralph make amends I saw Ralph we shook hands and you know it's not like we sat down and had a beer or anything I visited his panel discussion, which was really well done and I said to him afterwards that he did a great job and you know it's like we you know kale and I and said it like it's like we're just kind of like on a just building some bridges to people because this you know it's not going to be a good time to talk about that.

[21:18] This you know it doesn't like just go away like that if you have an issue with people it doesn't just resolve instantly and I think you know you saw a little bit of that.

[21:29] Talking to don yesterday was great like I'm sure Ralph and I will have a show together soon probably on the round table coming up.

[21:37] And so like I think I think you're going to see more of it I think what's fun about it is I think everybody that loves pinball content creators and enjoys pinball content creators for our diversities of opinion for our different approaches to pinball content I think everybody enjoys seeing everybody on our level at least just get along right you know this isn't like Fox News MSNBC kind of.

[22:07] vibes like we're all just covering pinball and so I don't think making amends and hanging out with Don or Ralph or or or sort of you know loser kid and everybody I don't think any of that changes how we're all going to approach pinball and how we're going to make our content and and again because I've always said this like you know for people it's always hard for me because a lot of people don't tune into my show and on my show itself.

[22:34] And for those of you who do I rarely rarely other than giving credit to people having rumors like I just gave Don credit today for this ghost busters JJP rumor which is interesting.

[22:45] I rarely I rarely mention other content creators if ever and never like bring any beef or drama there anymore like maybe years ago you know you see use my my platform for you know to sort of call people out like on the content.

[23:04] level but all that's changed and I say this I went down those roads of of being that way and being stride in and being an a whole at times and and sort of like picking fights and and also defending my honor and all this dumb stuff right all this dumb stuff and it never ended up with anybody feeling good.

[23:24] It never ended up with anybody winning and it never made any of our audience or our fans or our listeners it never made every anybody have a good time like you know nobody wants to follow that.

[23:37] And that that is you know and that's why even more recently as I see certain content creators trying to use beef with me to make money right Albert and Colin.

[23:52] Prime examples like two guys making content that they want you to subscribe to their stuff to hear them insult me like it you know again I I almost feel bad for those two guys because having gone down that road and having done that before and learned in the end.

[24:18] All that all that will ever do is make you feel bad inside it will because when you go on these like one way rants against a person without that person on to defend themselves and then to use it as like I'm using is to challenge him to come like no that's not how grown adults take meetings it's not how grown adults.

[24:48] And that's what I'm trying to do is to get people to know what they want to engage in dialogue so it's just it is what it is.

[24:55] Well you know gang I don't know if the twippies are dead I think we might see a return but it's not going to be the way it used to be so.

[25:03] This is all like formulating I hear but from what I hear the changes are going to make it better and back to what it used to be which is none of this.

[25:14] And then you know I mean you got to remember like when you when you actually look at the history of the twippies there was a very direct and concerted effort to keep canator from winning like like they were they kept changing the rules so much so that so I would eventually lose.

[25:40] Finally got you know they finally achieved that they finally made enough alterations to the point where like I barely lost because of the weighted voting system.

[25:55] But you know and look I couldn't have lost to a better guy though I mean Kellen and Rachel I just I love them I mean they were at the Omakase dinner with me like like that you know in the end like what they'll never restore is.

[26:08] The value of the award show because it that's the way life works you know like a lot much like a pinball company.

[26:16] The you know your brand and your you like what we're all like in the content space we're all individual brands like canator Zach Greg can like we're brands like people they they know us as as something right they expect something from us they they enjoy content that comes from people.

[26:38] Carry you know Ralph like dawn like Jen is like they're all everyone's got their kind of thing going on right.

[26:45] And you just got to be careful with your brand because and I've learned this the hard way when when you act like an asshole I'm sorry curse when you act like a jackass.

[26:54] And you do something that you're not proud of and you wake up the next day and you're like what did I just why did I do that.

[27:00] Why did I say that why did I get drunk and act like a baby or why did I throw a drink in a dude's face or why did I.

[27:08] Complain about this or that and you know and I think.

[27:13] You just.

[27:15] For me for me there's usually one common denominator like usually.

[27:21] And it's usually alcohol like I'm I make no there's no mystery what happens in my head between being a sober person and someone who's got too many in them.

[27:35] And it's it's not that the real me is coming out it's it's actually a little bit more of the opposite it's it's there is more of a like an anger that brews I think when I get too drunk.

[27:50] And it's usually when I'm like expecting to be excited and it doesn't go my way and I'm.

[27:57] You know three sheets to the winners they would say in Ireland that's usually when.

[28:02] I lash out in a way that I nine out of ten times I would regret and I should just shut up go home.

[28:11] You know have have a glass of water and just chill bro chill life too short.

[28:19] Well you know brides like the thing about like repeating bad behaviors is like it's so much easier said than done when when you don't change the common denominator that led to the bad behavior right because it's like you know and you ask people who have like.

[28:41] Like serious drinking problems i don't i don't i just there's times when i don't know when to stop and that's that's always the problem is like you know you everyone look everyone goes into everyone i think everyone goes into most things in life with good intentions and you know it doesn't always end up that way.

[29:05] So I think you know i'm happy to say here October 25th.

[29:11] 20 25 that i've you know don said this word yesterday when when people asked him about doing a show with canada because I knew it's hard for dawn to do that show.

[29:23] I know it like I know it's hard because of things i've said in the past and what we said to each other i know it's hard because.

[29:32] It got personal which it shouldn't have i also know it's hard because there's people that.

[29:38] Follow dawn and look up to dawn that are disappointed in his decision to do a show with me right and i know that i'm you know and it's like.

[29:49] And I also have like canada fan members who don't want to see any any reconciliation i i do they're like i want me to go at everybody all the time i get you like it's easy for you to.

[29:59] Coach me to be stride in and lead me to war against individuals when you don't have to.

[30:05] Suffer the consequences of what those feelings are right.

[30:10] To go after like this guy canada go after this company canada go after him like i don't want to i don't want to wake up always.

[30:19] Putting out negativity or anger and and and you don't have to like deal with any of the consequences of what those actions might.

[30:26] Might bring to me especially guys you got to remember like on top of all this pinball stuff which i love to talk about every day i've got two little boys.

[30:35] Two little sweet little boys that i want to set a good example for two little sweet boys that look up to me that i'm their hero and like if i do something stupid in the pinball space that puts me in a bad mood and makes me.

[30:53] Close up you know because of my own stupidity or just like whatever it is just being in a bad mood right.

[31:00] To go downstairs and these two little cherubic angels are so excited to see their dad.

[31:07] How how asanine would it be for me to take the hobby that i love and then do stuff that would make my interactions with the people i love the most suffer because i made my hobby and the communications within the hobby.

[31:26] Create a.

[31:29] You know disruption in my piece of mind if you will and look that's why Ralph was like i just what i you know if can it is like.

[31:38] Creating a disruption in my piece of mind i'm just going to avoid canada and he did.

[31:44] And you know.

[31:46] Look and i know like the whole.

[31:50] You know disclosing that you got paid in a potter was like kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back when you just got to disclose that stuff you know and then we're all good no one cares nobody cared nobody cared.

[32:02] Nobody cared you know in the end it's like potter is a great game and everybody loves it and.

[32:08] You know it's selling so well for jjp and.

[32:11] If Ralph said i got paid in a potter machine to make that video i don't think it changes one person's point of view about harry potter i don't even think it changes one person's point of view about retro Ralph.

[32:21] I think in the end all it does is make people happy to see content creators actually getting paid for putting in the word.

[32:28] Kill her nann is baby the building bridges store kill it's beautiful you know what's funny about.

[32:34] As we we've been calling it amongst ourselves the building bridges tour is it's it's it's interesting because.

[32:40] I think there's some people out there that would absolutely love to see me canceled calling.

[32:46] Albert and what's annoying to those people.

[32:51] Is how.

[32:54] When you kill them with kindness and you actually behave in a way that is contrary into their agenda of canceling you.

[33:04] They don't know what to do.

[33:07] You know they don't they they really don't know what to do you know I heard.

[33:12] Somebody told me Albert said like we do can you hear is that don god hired by spooky he's gonna go off and he's gonna go crazy and he's gonna be so mad.

[33:22] When I heard that don was working with spooky.

[33:26] I sent him a note congratulating him.

[33:29] And I thought it was great.

[33:31] And I thought he has a lot of good ideas for spooky.

[33:34] And I know how passionate he is about.

[33:37] Pimball and their company and I know that he loves roller coasters and other thrill rides that.

[33:45] He wants to sort of infuse some of that thinking into pinball.

[33:50] And so I said I think this is great and I think good ideas can come from anywhere as long as they're good ideas right.

[33:57] Why would I wish ill upon a man who's kind of got a dream thing going on for him.

[34:03] And I don't look at Don moving to Benton with any envy.

[34:08] Here's what I think I think Don is very happy with his family.

[34:11] I think he's very happy with his life.

[34:13] And so am I with my life.

[34:17] I wish I wish my you know I wish the real estate prices were the same as Benton.

[34:23] But you know everything's relative.

[34:25] Everything's relative.

[34:27] But what's not relative is you know happiness like happiness is like it's not like happiness in Benton, Wisconsin,

[34:38] happiness in Rueiden, Connecticut, happiness in Kyoto, happiness in Vancouver, happiness wherever you are like happiness is you know it doesn't change what makes you happy because you move from here to here to here to here.

[34:50] I mean sure there's some environmental things that can change how happy you are.

[34:53] But you know ultimately it comes down to how do you feel about yourself and how do you feel about the decisions you make and how do you feel about the people you've surrounded in your life.

[35:01] And I've said this from the very beginning the true value of this hobby is in the people that it is brought into your lives.

[35:08] We spent an inordinate amount of time discussing these companies in these games right.

[35:13] But here's the thing we've all we've all seen enough of these companies in these games to know that they're not really going to surprise us or elevate this.

[35:22] Hobby as much as the people in this hobby will elevate your life.

[35:30] And when you understand that that my life and my happiness will be elevated by the incredible individuals I meet in Pimble.

[35:41] Then you can start to somewhat put the product itself where it belongs as a toy that is just a conduit to much more valuable things that we all need as humans.

[35:57] And when you when you when you realize that it's a beautiful thing.

[36:04] I don't think you guys are always coming here to hear this kind of speak I know you want me to like talk about mystery house and do I think it's going to go up and value and I'll get there in a little bit.

[36:13] No I don't think it's going to go up and value.

[36:17] I think it's an amazing game for the time I think it was perfectly launched.

[36:23] And I think there's a starving bunch of collectors out there that would have slept with any girl that bought them a drink at the bar.

[36:30] That's what I think.

[36:33] You know what I'm saying and like when a girl walks up to the bar and you haven't been laid in months and buys you a drink.

[36:40] If that girl is a six you're looking at her like she's a nine.

[36:45] Okay.

[36:46] Now I'm not saying you know Winchester is a six.

[36:49] But what I'm saying is you've got thousands of pinball collectors that haven't been laid by a game in years.

[36:58] And Winchester's mystery house just bought them a drink.

[37:02] They didn't see it coming.

[37:04] They didn't know that girl was coming into the bar.

[37:06] They didn't know that girl was going to you know do something different and actually make the first move.

[37:11] And man 525 horny collectors just got laid by getting their deposit in.

[37:21] Now what I've been saying for the last few weeks I think when Beetlejuice drops and people are asked to pay and fall for Winchester's and they've never played it.

[37:30] And you grew up with Beetlejuice you're going to see spots open up.

[37:34] I think people will regret if there if there's any scalpers out there they're going to regret not flipping a few of these Winchester spots right now.

[37:42] Now is the time to get out you always get out when the hype is hot you know it's going to.

[37:46] The hype is not this is a thing is like hype is is is usually early on you know what I'm saying like it's not going to get stronger as the weeks and months go on it's going to get quiet.

[37:59] Like look how good Harry Potter is right now right but no one talks about it much anymore.

[38:05] Nobody cares and now it's just like you know the windows the hype windows gone.

[38:09] Now it's just like make them it feels like an old game it feels like we've seen it for years we knew about it for years same thing with.

[38:15] You know and that's the thing about Winchester the benefit it has is like we haven't talked about it for years we haven't we haven't been expecting it for years.

[38:23] But will it will it make like maintain a indelible bond with collectors that they won't let them go often I don't know maybe again like me again like I would be a jerk.

[38:36] I'm not a prejudice against barrels if I told you the answers no it's not.

[38:41] No it's not going to do that because it's not my opinions that determine those things it's the market and it's the consumer reaction to a game right now no consumer has it in their home so I don't know.

[38:55] You know all I can go off of is other people's firsthand experiences on things so this like you know it's like so like I formulated a lot of.

[39:04] My own feelings around Harry Potter by reading about what so many people's opinions about Potter have been.

[39:11] And then I jump on the machine I played it myself I opened up the coin door I saw all I I literally played pot over a half hour straight and kept using the coin door ball save to see the entire game.

[39:22] And there's like some really cool stuff in there there absolutely is.

[39:27] But you know I was also like man this game's like there's no way people are going to see a lot of this because of how hard it would be to get to a lot of this.

[39:36] But that's you know that's J.J.P. man you know you got to own the game for years and you still don't like guns and roses like you're never going to on a three ball game you're never seeing no sympathy for the devil never.

[39:48] No no no no no the out lane drains on this game or the slingshot drains on the out lanes in this game are just so brutally hard I mean this is a brutal game I I sometimes think like you know GnR gets indicted for being clunky I indicted because I hate the out lane drains from the slings I just think it's brutal.

[40:09] I think there's too many of them and you know because there's no flow you get frustrated because there's a lot of trapping go in GnR and what sucks is guns and roses music is so high energy and so fast.

[40:22] You know like when you when GnR songs are playing and you've got this more like stop and go clunky game that's really the big issue with GnR like if guns and roses shot like Alton John.

[40:35] And when welcome to the jungles going you're getting into a rhythm and you're like banging like ramps and combos and this and that you know like almost like you know and that's what guns and roses does not have it's like the gameplay and the music are so disconnected that it it's only like the music and the lights are really connected but the gameplay is kind of like.

[41:01] So unfulfilling in the sense of like you really are just wanting this rock and roll gameplay and instead you've got this kind of like trap and go and you know I don't know like then you get like it's just it's you know the gameplay keeps slowing you down while the music wants to speed you up and I think that's the big miss on guns and roses what Eric should have done in this game.

[41:30] Is open did up more. He absolutely should have opened it up more.

[41:39] I mean automated selling them for 6500 I mean nobody wants a GnR LE now.

[41:48] The other issue with GnR are the lights wash out.

[41:52] If you've got the shoot for and call outs and three shots behind what you have to shoot for.

[42:01] Yeah I don't I don't I still don't know what to do fully in the game.

[42:09] I mean like the other the other big issue I have a GnR is like they just made.

[42:14] They put too much in it there's too many patches there's too many like it's confusing how to get like extra ball lit it's confusing how.

[42:25] You know the game works like I almost feel like GnR would have been better.

[42:30] If if it was like this if like the goal of the game.

[42:34] Was to get to like.

[42:38] You know stitch together four songs in a row is how you get to like.

[42:43] On core in the final wizard mode you know what I'm saying.

[42:47] That the the GnR needed to like be like more like that where you pick your your opening track.

[42:54] Then you follow up song.

[42:57] Then you know do and make it through one more song and then you get to on core the final song of your show like you know create like a little mini four.

[43:06] For four song because they about like four GnR songs.

[43:10] This and that like with you know you're talking about like 20 minutes there to get to get to like the final mode or something the first wizard mode like it just.

[43:18] Because to me right now like the problem with GnR is like it is kind of just like.

[43:23] Ju like you're playing a jukebox kind of.

[43:26] And then you're playing a jukebox to get the score but.

[43:30] You know I don't know there's some really cool stuff I just think if the gameplay and the way they arrange some of the stuff was a little bit more satisfying to get to just be a different game.

[43:42] What else is going on people how you doing.

[43:46] I just want to say like I'm very very appreciative of everybody who supports can a dispin ball podcast and hangs out here every Saturday morning.

[43:54] Hey does anyone is anyone here into the UFC.

[43:57] Because I need help I'm trying to get this UFC fight today it's a two o'clock and an Abu Dhabi it's aspenal versus like gain you know this.

[44:08] And I does anyone know how to get it like do I need ESPN and then order pay per view but or if I have ESPN because I'll tell you this I hate the way streaming is now like I just got YouTube TV last night to watch the world series.

[44:22] I don't have basic cable I'm not sure how to even get the game.

[44:28] You have to have ESPN plus the buy the pay per view so annoying so I don't know that like so now I've got to go like subscribe to another service.

[44:39] Can I get ESPN plus with like Disney plus and Hulu.

[44:46] My favorite guns and roses song bug in life or in the game.

[44:58] I think here's the thing.

[45:03] Here's the thing I am we've all seen the cup head pictures.

[45:09] There's a video of cup head that's floating around someone has like a video of like I think all those images are screen grabs from the David fix apparently sent a video around of gameplay to people.

[45:25] I don't I don't know man I cup heads not getting made.

[45:30] And if if but I think like the else there's like some Australian pinball show coming up where rhyme a cool I don't know where cup head is listed as being one of the games to be showed there.

[45:45] I need Disney bundle Disney plus Hulu and ESPN plus.

[45:51] I hate it all.

[45:53] So my favorite guns and roses song of all time.

[45:58] You know I would have to say is.

[46:04] Is November rain I mean I just I just think November rain.

[46:08] And I also think November rain is one of my least favorite songs in the game and I'll tell you why I love the way it starts out.

[46:16] But for being such an iconic song.

[46:19] I think whoever did the coding on guns and roses November rain on the pinball machine just stopped working on it after two minutes.

[46:29] They didn't do anything with the lights to capture any of the magic of slashes solos and the worst part is like the end of the game right where the where they you know there's that moment of silence is like.

[46:42] And then you know they didn't do anything with the lights like the light show doesn't change at all like the game should have gone dark those piano notes and that solo.

[46:56] And then like that how did they they didn't sync up the lights with any of that.

[47:02] So when I got to the end of November rain I was so disappointed how mediocre the light show is on the game.

[47:11] Super box.

[47:15] What is a super box that sounds like a physical thing I need to get I'm not stealing cable guys I'm sorry.

[47:27] I'm not I wouldn't buy anything from AP until they pay all the vendors and employees they owe money to well yeah I mean Dan no one's buying anything Dan by the way it was great seeing you at expo sorry we couldn't hang out much longer.

[47:39] But we'll definitely do it again don't be a soy boy and ask jeepie well yeah we're sad boy been.

[47:50] Are the monetized chats not here gang.

[47:54] I don't see my I don't see the ability to give money on the chats where that go.

[48:01] You guys see it that's interesting.

[48:10] I don't I don't understand where my where my where my ability to make money is.

[48:18] Next week we'll do it.

[48:22] Yeah we're the super check go.

[48:28] I don't understand tech I didn't I didn't touch anything and now the super chats are gone.

[48:36] Whatever.

[48:40] I'll survive I'll survive without busking for money.

[48:44] Everyone can head over to Facebook and give me stars where Apple will take like 40% of the money.

[48:59] Yeah I didn't hang out in the bar as much as I thought I was at expo is anyone going to should I go to pinball at the beach.

[49:09] I think pinball at the beach in February is really a good time of year to feel like you know you want to be in the sun.

[49:16] So maybe I'll look to go to pinball at the beach.

[49:19] Part of me just thinks I should be invited to these shows and the shows should actually set me up with a booth.

[49:27] The shows should the shows you know.

[49:32] I do feel like the show should do a little bit for all of us like content creators.

[49:40] What sold out the show sold out.

[49:45] Or the hotel sold out there's a lot of hotels right there I don't know like there's one across the street.

[49:54] The ideal topper for beetle juice.

[49:57] I think would be the.

[50:02] I don't know I would love that like isn't there like that scene where he has like he turns his like fist into hammers and it does like you know like the carnival game I think that would be an awesome top right here.

[50:15] Or this or the tiny head beetle juice on the top.

[50:20] Now they never booked me to Australia.

[50:30] Pinball at the beach.

[50:32] So you're telling me if I walked up to pinball at the beach.

[50:40] They'd be like we're sold out.

[50:46] I don't understand what sells out tickets to the show or the hotel rooms.

[50:51] Because I'm assuming anyone can just walk up locally and go to the show right is it the hotel rooms that sell out.

[50:59] Put a link put a link in the chat to the to the hotel let's see.

[51:09] You would be able to get in they only sold 1000 tickets.

[51:15] I think you guys really go to like sunny Florida and you're they're playing pinball under a tent.

[51:22] Media past don't sell out.

[51:27] Yeah I mean I.

[51:30] I think Rob needs to really get better at giving media like media credentials at meet like media need to have credentials like vendors.

[51:41] And because it's in the end.

[51:44] A lot of us like struggle to get time on games.

[51:49] Because we couldn't get in early.

[51:55] And I think that's unfortunate.

[51:58] It's also like me you know media want to be able to go in early if I want to interview people from the expo floor like it just gets too crowded to

[52:07] get out of the show.

[52:10] And I think it's really important to allow like it be nice to walk in in our early in hour and half early schedule interviews with some of the manufacturers they're all there they all set up early.

[52:19] You know it's funny going early and it's all the vendors playing each others games like Chris Turner jumping on Winchester you know vice versa.

[52:29] Yet none of the media have credentials to get in there and be a part of that.

[52:34] I mean I think about that for a minute like why would I mean other than like what you said like call people over and do interviews from my booth.

[52:41] I mean I could potentially do that but I here's why I don't want to run a booth is I don't want to be tied to a booth.

[52:48] And I like walking around more than I like sitting there like waiting for people to come by.

[53:00] I don't know I just have this kind of feeling that I've done enough to to the 12 years of making pinball content and I'm still sort of like the red headed step child of like the industry is funny to me.

[53:14] It's funny to me I mean it's even funny to me that like you know like I didn't really see the stern employees but like it's funny to me that they're not reaching out.

[53:24] Hey you know hey Chris like let's meet up like let's talk about get let's give him something you know.

[53:32] I I find it funny because the.

[53:37] I still think they don't take us that seriously I still think they don't understand.

[53:43] That there is definitely influence happening between content creators and people's desire to buy.

[53:53] Definitely.

[53:56] You know and that's why it's just worth like think about like this is it better to have canada talking positively about your game because you you fill them in and introduce them to the product in the right way and gave them all the inside information about how this game was made or is it more beneficial for you to.

[54:19] Not meet with him make him pay for his own flight over and just rag on the game to all thousands of people that listen every week.

[54:37] All you do is bad mouth their products and you're wondering why they don't like you all I do Brandon who are you was Brandon and.

[54:46] Yeah Brandon that's what I do man I just bad mouth their products have I've own more I've own I've own games from almost every manufacturer.

[54:57] Brandon do you listen to the show.

[55:01] Probably not.

[55:08] The way I was made a dunk tank was a great idea will do that one day more fun at the beach I can be in a bathing suit.

[55:16] Take a pic with canada.

[55:20] I got an idea for canada tournament by the way like the tournament room at expo was so sad how do you guys do these tournaments.

[55:29] I got like a few more minutes guys than I gotta go because I gotta get some stuff together.

[55:32] I gotta go figure out how to get ESPN plus because I'm I'm I'm I'm invited people over to the fight.

[55:39] Um,

[55:42] Hector what's up brother?

[55:45] The, um, how do you guys do these tournaments man?

[55:48] Like they they they just look like so

[55:53] unfulfilling and sad and those rooms always look so depressing.

[55:59] You know whenever I would like walk by the tournament room and I'd always be like, Oh, is that is that like a vendor hall?

[56:04] Are they're like proud? Is there fun stuff to look at it? And then it's just like

[56:08] It's the tournament room. It smells like a locker room and everybody looks miserable. Pimball tournament.

[56:20] Well, I love that like beetle juices selling strong like it's not even for sale.

[56:25] See here's what's happened.

[56:30] The distros now know what their allocation is.

[56:35] Can I can I say now bug can I officially tell people how many games can it has been allocated to give to Canadian club members to buy not not for free.

[56:45] Oh and who knows they might even do something special for the Canadian five editions. They're they're always good at like little custom plaques.

[56:52] Canada edition number one two three four five. Can we do something like that bug?

[56:58] Um, that'd be fun.

[57:00] Canada club member edition who will make him like a super LE just because can I meant my fans would love to have that like that.

[57:07] Like those games would never come up for sale.

[57:10] So the Canadian club edition of the next the next game from spooky like you know how you have to talk about it.

[57:19] Um

[57:21] they're they're going to be fully loaded and and I mean like

[57:26] Topper butter cabinet your it's all or nothing.

[57:31] I'm not a dude. I'm not a distro now because I'm not getting the game at cost to sell to these guys for the retail cost.

[57:41] Go to ESPN app and search UFC you will then see today's fight and the option to buy.

[57:49] Oh, can I kill can I get that on Xbox if I VSPN app on Xbox.

[57:57] But how kill how do I get the ESPN app do I need the login?

[58:08] Kill you might have to text me or login.

[58:11] Can you share the login with me? I don't know how this work. I hate all this.

[58:16] Why can I just order the fight?

[58:26] I love it. I love it. I love what's about to happen. I mean I've been telling everybody to get on the list for beetle juice and like I think of almost everybody.

[58:35] I think most people have listened.

[58:37] You know I love that there's going to be that one guy you know I just feel bad for that one guy.

[58:42] There's going to be that one guy that like gets bit by the pinball bug like the day after beetle juice comes out.

[58:50] You know what I'm saying? Can we all just have a moment of silence for that one guy?

[58:55] Like that newbie doctor lawyer who just like I don't know he one night he's up surfing the internet and he

[59:03] stumbles upon a Facebook ad or he sees pinside and there's going to be that one guy that falls in love with like pinball like

[59:10] the day after beetle juice drops and he's going to be like oh man this looks fun. I should go get one of these like like like literally that's what's going to happen.

[59:18] We need one rich board

[59:22] probably overweight guys going to like hey hey baby I just saw this beetle juice pinball machine. That's a fun movie.
