[00:00] I wear my sunglasses at night, so I can, so I can forget my name, while you collect your claims,

[00:11] Cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera, cera.

[00:16] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Happy Monday, everybody.

[00:20] I love doing this show on Monday mornings.

[00:22] This topic of today's podcast is gonna be very simply this.

[00:26] I wanna talk about dealers and distributors.

[00:29] And do they have an obligation

[00:31] to sort of help reset this pinball marketplace?

[00:34] They're the real customers of most pinball machines.

[00:37] It's not me and you.

[00:39] It's them who has to place these large orders

[00:41] with these companies.

[00:43] And over the last few years, ever since COVID,

[00:46] the pinball prices have gone through the roof.

[00:49] And how come the dealers and the distributors

[00:51] are not getting together to meet with these manufacturers

[00:55] and give them some,

[00:56] because these prices are just not sustainable,

[00:59] ladies and gentlemen.

[01:00] Everybody knows it,

[01:01] but no one seemingly wants to do anything about it.

[01:04] We're seeing major companies like Ford and Tesla

[01:07] lower the prices of their products,

[01:09] yet pinball machine prices, they haven't lowered,

[01:11] they keep going up and up and up.

[01:13] And I woke up this morning to see a Venom LE4 sale

[01:18] for $9,995.

[01:21] A low-play game barely out of the box.

[01:24] Someone unboxes it and loses instantly $3,000

[01:29] on a game they just bought a month ago.

[01:32] We're not talking like a year ago.

[01:34] We're not talking two years ago.

[01:36] We're talking about a game that just came out for $13,000.

[01:41] How long can this last?

[01:42] Everybody witnessing all of these games

[01:45] sliding south instantly.

[01:47] You see games like Foo Fighters, James Bond,

[01:50] they're not heading north.

[01:51] Instantly these games are going from $13,000

[01:54] back to where they should have always been.

[01:57] A Stern LE should be $10,000.

[02:00] It should not be any more than that.

[02:03] When Godzilla came out and it was $10,500,

[02:06] Stern didn't leave the price there very long at all.

[02:08] They brought it up again for Rush.

[02:10] They've been raising the price ever since

[02:12] and I'm sorry but stand over a Stern machine.

[02:15] Do you see a $13,000 device?

[02:18] And yet who's ordering these games?

[02:20] It's the dealers and the distros.

[02:23] And how long can all these dealers and distros survive

[02:26] ordering all these Venoms?

[02:28] How can they survive trying to place an order

[02:31] on games like Elton John?

[02:33] And I feel like if this pinball marketplace

[02:35] doesn't start to settle down a little bit,

[02:37] if it doesn't start to even itself out

[02:40] and the market will dictate where these things

[02:42] should be priced.

[02:44] But is this not the market dictating

[02:46] that a Venom LE never should have been priced at $13,000.

[02:50] And once you make a thousand LEs,

[02:52] you're not gonna sell them for that much money.

[02:54] And now every single person, the other 999 people

[02:58] who bought a Venom LE if they even sold that many

[03:01] now realize their game has lost so much money.

[03:04] Let me just ask a question.

[03:05] Do you think the dealers and distributors are happy

[03:08] that pinball prices are this high?

[03:10] How can they be happy about it?

[03:12] You know, years ago, people used to be super excited.

[03:14] They couldn't wait to get their hands

[03:16] on any new game that came out.

[03:17] I don't feel that vibe anymore.

[03:19] And I don't understand why they don't get together

[03:22] to meet with the manufacturers and put more pressure.

[03:25] I don't know if this is collusion or not,

[03:26] if you're allowed to do this.

[03:28] But let me use an example like Elton John.

[03:30] You're telling me if Jersey Jack Pinball

[03:33] is gonna release this game

[03:34] and they need their top distributors

[03:36] to sell this to their customers,

[03:38] who has the greatest line of sight

[03:40] into what the customer has?

[03:42] Surely it's your dealers and distributors.

[03:44] They're the ones who are hearing

[03:45] from every one of your customers.

[03:47] You're not hearing from all of your customers.

[03:49] It's these people.

[03:50] They've got the email list of all of the customers.

[03:52] We get spammed on Facebook.

[03:54] We get email blast saying,

[03:55] hey, this game is available.

[03:56] Do you want one?

[03:57] Distributors and dealers are going out

[03:59] and even doing phone calls to some of their customers

[04:01] saying, hey, do you want one?

[04:02] Do you want an Elton John collector's edition?

[04:05] And the reason they now have to work harder at it

[04:07] is because the games are so much more expensive.

[04:10] The themes have not been take my money now themes.

[04:13] And now these dealers and distros have to figure out

[04:16] how many of these games do I order?

[04:18] And if I don't get that order correctly,

[04:20] I could be sitting on this merchandise

[04:22] and this inventory for a really long time.

[04:25] And what we saw this past week, people,

[04:27] we have never seen before

[04:28] in the 10 years I've been covering Pinball.

[04:31] We're now seeing blowout clearance sales

[04:34] of old inventory.

[04:35] Stern is now allowing its dealers to sell old games

[04:39] like Rush and Led Zeppelin and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[04:43] If these dealers are sitting on some of these games

[04:45] that are a few years old,

[04:47] they can now sell them for like $1,000 to $2,000 off of MSRP.

[04:52] And the reason why they need to allow these distributors

[04:54] to do this, they never used to allow them

[04:56] to do these blowout sales is they know

[04:59] that these distros need to free up this inventory

[05:01] and get some more money in-house

[05:03] so they can place the next order for all these L-virus

[05:06] and all these stranger things

[05:07] and all these like Jaws Pinball machines

[05:09] that are about to come out.

[05:10] But let's take it back to Elton John.

[05:12] Imagine if you're Jersey Jack Pinball,

[05:14] you now have two flops in a row in Toy Story 4

[05:17] and in games like The Godfather.

[05:19] Your dealers and distros are sitting

[05:21] on so much unsold inventory for both of those titles.

[05:25] So what do you need to happen on this new title?

[05:27] You need it to be a hit game.

[05:29] And if you're Jersey Jack Pinball,

[05:31] you're seeing that people are not gonna just throw money

[05:34] at a $12,000 to $15,000 machine and not think about it.

[05:38] And you whiffed with titles like Toy Story 4

[05:40] and The Godfather and all of the conversation

[05:43] happening around Elton John Pinball

[05:45] hasn't been super positive.

[05:47] Every time people put up polls,

[05:49] how excited are you to buy an Elton John Pinball machine?

[05:52] It doesn't poll very well.

[05:54] And so what did this smart move be

[05:56] that Jersey Jack reevaluates its pricing?

[05:59] Wouldn't this smart move by these distros

[06:01] sitting on six figures of unsold Jersey Jack inventory?

[06:05] Why didn't they get together and say,

[06:07] hey, we need a meeting.

[06:08] We need to meet.

[06:09] Let's get the top 10 distributors

[06:11] over at Jersey Jack Pinball in a room,

[06:13] have them sign an NDA with Jersey Jack Pinball,

[06:17] and hear from Jersey Jack Pinball

[06:18] what its next game is gonna be.

[06:20] Why don't they do this stuff?

[06:22] And so if Jersey Jack said to these 10 distributors,

[06:24] again, keep in mind, keep in mind, they need a hit game.

[06:27] And they're like, look, we have Elton John coming out next

[06:30] and we're planning to price it between $12 and $15,000

[06:33] like the previous two games.

[06:35] Now, surely if they had a meeting like this,

[06:37] the distros would have said, wait a minute,

[06:39] we can't do this.

[06:41] You can't price this theme, which is not in high demand.

[06:45] We can't price it the same as those past two games

[06:48] because it's not gonna work.

[06:50] Especially if we wanna say there's gonna be

[06:52] 1,000 collector's editions at 15K, it's not gonna work.

[06:56] We need to try something new.

[06:58] We either need to try to limit the amount of games

[07:01] we're gonna make to justify this price

[07:03] or we're gonna need to reduce the price on day one.

[07:07] And they should run some scenarios.

[07:09] Like what are the scenarios if we lower the price

[07:11] of the LE to $9,500 for Elton John,

[07:14] how many do we think we're gonna sell versus $12,000?

[07:18] Is Jersey Jack even running these scenarios?

[07:21] Or are they just acting like every game they launch

[07:23] is gonna be a frenzy like Guns N' Roses?

[07:25] But everybody forgets, Guns N' Roses was $9,000

[07:29] for an LE or 9,500 and it was $12,500

[07:33] for the collector's edition.

[07:34] So the last time Jersey Jack Pinball

[07:36] had any frenzy to buy one of its games,

[07:39] it was a much better theme than the last three

[07:41] and the prices were much lower.

[07:43] So why would they take the prices so much further north?

[07:47] And if you're a distributor,

[07:48] how can you really feel good

[07:49] about carrying these products for this company?

[07:52] I mean, not only did Jersey Jack Pinball undermine

[07:55] its distros and dealers by selling directly,

[07:57] but why aren't there more meetings like this?

[08:00] And it's not just Jersey Jack.

[08:01] I mean, Stern has so many distributors and dealers

[08:05] and why would they want prices to get this high?

[08:08] Do you think their margins are much better now?

[08:10] I don't.

[08:11] And this is like this dirty little secret about pinballs.

[08:13] We are not supposed to know

[08:15] what a dealer spends on a product.

[08:18] And the whole relationship between distributors

[08:21] and dealers and Stern Pinball,

[08:22] it's also a little bit vague to me.

[08:24] So if you're a dealer,

[08:26] do you have to buy your game from a distributor

[08:28] or are you buying your product directly from Stern?

[08:30] I think you have to buy it

[08:31] from one of Stern's big distributors.

[08:33] But there's just all these middlemen involved

[08:36] in getting a machine from a factory in Chicago

[08:39] to your house or to your barcade and your location.

[08:42] And if I'm a distributor, I want volume, right?

[08:45] I wanna be able to sell games easily.

[08:48] So I'm gonna want triple A themes.

[08:50] Now look, shouldn't a triple A theme carry more price

[08:54] than a B or C level theme that not many people want?

[08:57] Why is every single game priced exactly the same?

[09:01] How is Pokemon gonna be the same price as Venom?

[09:04] It's apples to oranges in terms of how much people

[09:06] want that theme.

[09:07] So I just think something's gonna have to give

[09:09] sooner than later or else, you know what's gonna happen?

[09:12] The more and more we see all of our friends

[09:14] unboxing these games, losing a ton of money,

[09:18] the more people are just gonna wait and see.

[09:19] They're not gonna buy right now.

[09:21] And I do think these distributors have an obligation

[09:25] to meet with these manufacturers and figure something out.

[09:28] There has to be a middle ground.

[09:30] And I think we went too high.

[09:32] It's obviously too high.

[09:33] There is no way pinball sales this year

[09:36] are gonna be as good as they were a year ago.

[09:39] And these distributors know the truth.

[09:41] And I talked to some of them and they tell me,

[09:43] like it's really hard right now.

[09:44] It's not that they don't make a decent amount

[09:46] of money on every game sold,

[09:48] but people are hitting the brakes

[09:49] on buying new and box games.

[09:52] And the more and more people keep waiting on the sidelines

[09:54] and don't jump in right away.

[09:56] And can you blame them, right?

[09:57] Only a fool is gonna jump in right away and buy a Venom LE.

[10:01] And I'm even hesitant now to say you should buy a Jaws LE

[10:05] because now they're gonna make an anniversary edition

[10:08] of everything.

[10:09] And that is the plan is that Stern's gonna make

[10:11] an anniversary edition of Jaws next year.

[10:14] So are you gonna go in and spend $13,000

[10:18] on a 1000 run LE of a game

[10:20] that they are most likely gonna one up just a year later?

[10:24] And the rumor I heard, and guess where these rumors come from?

[10:26] Because Jack, when Ari talks to people,

[10:28] the rumor I heard is that Jersey Jack pinball

[10:31] does have the license to the first Matrix movie.

[10:35] It's not gonna be Matrix number four.

[10:38] It's gonna be Matrix number one.

[10:40] And so that is the game I am hearing

[10:41] that Mark Saden is working on.

[10:44] That will come out in the summer of 2024.

[10:47] So now you know this, right?

[10:49] The Matrix from Jersey Jack.

[10:51] Now a theme like that,

[10:52] I could see selling for $12 or $15,000

[10:56] because of its popularity.

[10:57] But now that you know that Jersey Jack

[10:59] is gonna have the Matrix come out within a year,

[11:02] are you really gonna go run and buy Elton John right now?

[11:05] Are you gonna go secure a non-refundable deposit?

[11:08] No, you're not.

[11:09] No, you're not.

[11:10] And it doesn't matter how much pans

[11:11] or a freaking ice man try to hype that thread.

[11:14] The truth is, hardly anybody's gonna buy the game.

[11:17] It's gonna be another short run game

[11:19] because dealers and distros are not gonna order

[11:21] a ton of Elton John's because they will sit there unsold.

[11:25] And the main reason, besides the fact that it's Elton John,

[11:29] the main reason it's not really selling, it's overpriced.

[11:33] I have so many friends who hit me up and say,

[11:35] hey, if it was $9,000,

[11:37] I would absolutely just take it for a whirl.

[11:40] I would take it for a spin,

[11:41] but I'm not gonna spend $12,000 on it, unbox it,

[11:45] and then the damn thing is worth $9,000 in three months.

[11:48] And everybody knows that's the way it's gonna go.

[11:51] We're seeing it happen with Godfather.

[11:53] It happened with Toy Story.

[11:55] Why would it not happen with this pin as well?

[11:58] This is gonna continue to be the big story

[12:00] of the end of this year and into next year.

[12:02] You know, ultimately the market will win.

[12:05] Ultimately, the market will show everybody

[12:08] where a pinball machine should be priced at.

[12:10] And these aren't even used games, right?

[12:12] There's no way a cardboard box should be worth $2,000 to $3,000.

[12:17] How can you with a straight face buy a game for $13,000

[12:21] and know you could have the same exact game

[12:24] in basically mint condition

[12:26] if you just waited a month or two,

[12:28] you could have the same exact game for $3,000 less.

[12:33] How does anyone defending these stern prices

[12:36] even look in the mirror

[12:37] and feel like this stuff is not gonna pop soon?

[12:40] And it's all gonna come down to Jaws.

[12:42] I feel like Jaws is gonna be this seminal moment.

[12:44] It's not that Keith Elwin is not gonna release

[12:47] a great shooting pin,

[12:48] but is Jaws going to give you enough

[12:51] of what you expect for this much money?

[12:54] Because people's expectations for Godzilla

[12:56] were not that high,

[12:57] because most people out there are not like Godzilla fanatics.

[13:00] And I think Jaws has more of a fandom and a fan base.

[13:04] And if they don't nail it,

[13:05] I could see a lot of people for the first time

[13:08] being truly upset about what Keith Elwin

[13:11] has brought into the pinball space.

[13:13] It's probably not gonna happen.

[13:14] It's probably gonna be like Jurassic Park.

[13:17] You know, the other thing about Elwin,

[13:18] it's like you're not allowed to criticize anything he does.

[13:20] You're not allowed to criticize any move stern makes.

[13:23] I mean, look, Stern didn't put the assets

[13:25] into Jurassic Park because they didn't wanna pay for them.

[13:27] That's it.

[13:28] They could have if they wanted to, but why would they?

[13:31] Because if we keep buying

[13:32] when they don't put what you want into a game,

[13:34] why would they need to change their approach?

[13:37] But that's gonna be a seminal moment this December

[13:39] to see what the reaction to Jaws is.

[13:42] But deep down inside,

[13:44] I feel like all of us are feeling this way.

[13:46] Every single game can't be this expensive.

[13:49] I mean, the pros are now like $6,500, $7,000,

[13:53] which shipping for most people.

[13:55] Then you've got these $9,500, $10,000 premiums.

[13:58] And then the LEDs are just like really the dumb buy.

[14:00] They really are.

[14:01] But man, it's like, you know, when you're a collector,

[14:03] you want the top tier model of a game.

[14:05] You don't wanna have like second fiddle.

[14:07] If you're gonna spend $10,000,

[14:09] I might as well spend $13,000.

[14:12] And that's the psychology they're using

[14:14] to rope us into that LE purchase.

[14:17] So my ultimate point is this.

[14:18] I do think dealers and distros must be nervous.

[14:21] I think smaller distros and dealers must be really nervous

[14:25] because the more people stop buying new in box

[14:28] because they don't like these prices,

[14:30] the more it's gonna be difficult for them

[14:32] to make any money on their inventory.

[14:34] Because a game that's gonna sit for weeks

[14:36] might now sit for months.

[14:38] Like who's gonna go buy a galactic tank force

[14:41] for like $11,000?

[14:42] You know, the one with the tank body on it.

[14:44] Who's gonna go buy that for that much money

[14:46] when you know you're gonna be able to get one open

[14:48] for like 20% less?

[14:50] Why would anyone buy Elton John new in box?

[14:53] Why?

[14:54] I'm kind of happy to see the market correcting itself.

[14:56] And I think it's gonna be a really interesting end of 2023

[15:00] into early 2024.

[15:02] I don't wanna see Pinball go down this road

[15:05] where the item itself basically prices out most people

[15:09] from enjoying the hobby.

[15:11] And I don't know about you,

[15:12] but my salary hasn't really increased much

[15:15] since the beginning of COVID.

[15:16] And it's been like a few years now.

[15:18] Housing prices have gone up.

[15:20] Things I really need have gone up in value.

[15:22] But Pinball prices skyrocketed

[15:24] in comparison to everything else.

[15:26] It really did.

[15:27] And again, there's just something deep down

[15:29] when I look down at a stern machine,

[15:31] I don't see a $13,000 game.

[15:34] I just don't.

[15:36] You know, Jersey Jack, I see more of the value.

[15:38] Those machines look a lot nicer than stern machines.

[15:41] When you just put them side by side,

[15:43] like put Elton John next to a game like Rush,

[15:47] it's just something about the way they look.

[15:49] Like one looks like a Honda Civic

[15:50] and one looks like a Mercedes Benz.

[15:53] And Sternists love the fact.

[15:55] They've loved the fact that with all the flat plastic

[15:58] and beautiful artwork,

[15:59] as long as they make the gameplay good

[16:02] and they make the flippers snappy,

[16:05] they've basically doubled the price of what an LE is

[16:08] over the last like five to six years.

[16:10] And it's crazy.

[16:11] They got away with it.

[16:12] All right.

[16:13] What else is happening in the Pinball world?

[16:15] Canade is complaining about prices again.

[16:17] Happy Monday, everybody.

[16:18] We heard that Barrels of Fun

[16:19] has two pinball themes secured after labyrinth.

[16:23] Is one of them gonna be Princess Bride?

[16:26] Maybe there's that weird Princess Bride website.

[16:28] I think we've got some time.

[16:30] Before we open up barrel number two,

[16:32] they still have to finish all the games in barrel number one.

[16:35] And that's probably gonna take them an entire fiscal year

[16:39] to get that game completed.

[16:41] There is still that mystery game coming out

[16:43] that I talked about in Q1, Q2 of 2024.

[16:47] We've got Jaws Pinball coming out.

[16:49] We've got Elton John,

[16:50] which needs to be going on the line probably sometime this year.

[16:53] Will Haggis Pinball build all the fathoms

[16:56] before the year is up?

[16:57] Probably, because we don't even know

[16:59] how many they have to build.

[17:00] I have no idea, but I think they're finished

[17:03] with the mermaid editions of the game.

[17:05] And I can't imagine many people

[17:07] ordered the regular version of fathom.

[17:10] Dutch Pinball continues to crank out the big Lebowski's.

[17:14] I can't wait to the day

[17:15] where all the early achievers are made whole.

[17:18] I've had some people reach out to me

[17:20] about the Ellen Ripley version of Alien.

[17:23] I haven't seen a game play stream with all of the clips.

[17:26] What I'll say is this,

[17:27] obviously it's a great move to put her into the game.

[17:30] I do feel bad for the Highway Pinball owners

[17:33] who will not be able to get the Ellen Ripley software.

[17:37] I do think that's a little crummy

[17:39] because the Pinball brothers basically took over

[17:42] Highway Pinball, basically made those games

[17:45] that they sold to people,

[17:46] and now they're gonna cut bait.

[17:48] It uses different hardware and software

[17:50] than the Highway game.

[17:51] I can understand why they don't wanna continue

[17:54] to support Andrew Highway's products.

[17:56] I don't blame them.

[17:57] It's just a crappy scenario if you have one of those games.

[18:01] Because there was something cool

[18:03] about owning the Highway version.

[18:05] The cabinet was unique.

[18:06] You have the screen in the play field,

[18:08] which was really cool.

[18:10] And there's people out there that are like,

[18:11] oh, the Highway version plays better

[18:13] than the Pinball brother version.

[18:14] I can't imagine why there'd be a ton of difference.

[18:17] Maybe it's the flipper feel.

[18:18] I don't know.

[18:19] Isn't it the same exact design?

[18:21] If you've owned both versions of the game

[18:23] and you wanna help Canada figure out

[18:25] what the differences are, please hit me up.

[18:27] What else is going on in the world?

[18:29] The Pinball this week.

[18:30] Turner Pinball, why does anybody even care

[18:32] about Turner Pinball?

[18:34] I don't understand this.

[18:35] Nobody's buying one.

[18:36] You're not buying one.

[18:37] So let's move on from them.

[18:39] You know, Spooky Pinball continues to get Scooby-Doo.

[18:41] I think we're gonna see Spooky Pinball's next game

[18:44] sometime around TPF, sometime around March.

[18:47] And I do think it's gonna be Texas Chainsaw Massacre

[18:50] and Looney Tunes.

[18:52] I think it's gonna be the weirdest shared design layout ever

[18:55] in terms of theme.

[18:56] I saw that American Pinball won for best booth

[19:00] at Chicago Pinball Expo.

[19:03] Okay, cool.

[19:03] Like I don't know what David Fix is gonna be able to do

[19:06] to sell more of these galactic tank force games.

[19:09] Do you think people were buying that game

[19:10] left and right at the show?

[19:12] Look, I get it.

[19:13] All the campiness with the characters

[19:15] and the tank and the ice cream and outer space,

[19:17] but I just don't see this thing moving.

[19:19] I don't see anybody buying this game.

[19:21] I don't see anyone saying,

[19:22] hey, I just ordered a galactic tank force.

[19:26] It's gonna end up becoming one of these obscure titles

[19:29] that very few people own.

[19:30] It's crazy, right?

[19:31] In the end, they're not even gonna make more

[19:33] than probably 500 of these games.

[19:35] Why can't we just get better themes?

[19:37] Like why can't we just get better themes

[19:39] that you never wanna sell?

[19:41] That's where I'm at with Pinball these days.

[19:42] I don't even wanna buy stuff thinking

[19:44] about the resale anymore.

[19:46] At these prices, I only wanna buy stuff

[19:49] that I wanna keep, that I wanna enjoy,

[19:51] that I don't wanna live without.

[19:53] And that's cool.

[19:54] So I'm cool waiting on stuff.

[19:56] I saw that Mr. Sharp wrote a pin side post

[19:58] from Play Mechanics about pulp fiction,

[20:01] and it still just doesn't feel like anything

[20:04] is officially coming from this company.

[20:06] And you might have saw on my Facebook,

[20:08] I posted a private text message between a customer

[20:12] and Ryan White in which Ryan basically guarantees

[20:16] there's gonna be another run of medieval madness games

[20:19] from CGC.

[20:21] I also heard that CGC lost the license

[20:24] to make more versions of planetary games.

[20:27] So somebody is lying and someone is not being truthful,

[20:31] but I'll say this, if you're thinking

[20:33] of buying a medieval madness royal edition for $20,000,

[20:37] I would just wait it out

[20:39] because there's a good chance they're gonna make more.

[20:41] I have no idea what is going on at CGC.

[20:45] They are the worst pinball company

[20:47] when it comes to communication.

[20:48] They're so bad at customer service.

[20:50] Everything about this company is absolutely atrocious

[20:54] other than they build some of the best quality

[20:57] pinball machines in all of pinball.

[20:59] Why does it have to be this weird compromise?

[21:02] Why does Doug over at CGC run the company this way?

[21:05] It's so weird.

[21:06] Everybody have a happy Halloween tomorrow.

[21:09] It's gonna be a fun day tomorrow.

[21:10] If you have kids, take them trick or treating.

[21:13] I can't wait to take Killian walking around.

[21:15] He's gonna be dressed like a little lion, I think,

[21:17] or Woody from Toy Story.

[21:18] Everybody, we will be back this week

[21:20] with more episodes of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[21:23] And if you're new to the show,

[21:24] I'll give you a shout out on the next episode.

[21:27] I know it's the end of the month,

[21:28] so you're gonna get that little bill

[21:29] from Canadian Pinball Podcast, but trust me,

[21:32] I don't see anyone else with Patreon pages

[21:34] even giving you this much content.

[21:36] It's crazy.

[21:37] This is still the best bang for buck

[21:39] in all the pinball.

[21:40] We'll talk to you soon.

[21:41] I'll cry to you.

[21:42] I wear my sunglasses.

[21:46] I wear my sunglasses.
