[00:00] I'm gonna stick my clings, I'll fight to survive!

[00:16] Oh, welcome everybody, happy money to Canada's Pinball Podcast, I'm super pumped, I've been at the gym since like 7am, and what a weekend for Pinball.

[00:25] I thought I was gonna have not much news to talk about, but let's talk about it right now.

[00:29] We've got Venom First Impressions, I went over to Jack Bar, I played about $20 on Venom, I'm gonna talk about that.

[00:36] We've got the Mystery Pinball Machine giving out clues, and a crossword puzzle, has Canada figured out the puzzle, that is the mystery game that might be based on a movie that is actually a literal puzzle.

[00:48] Canada gets covered on NAPS RK twice in one weekend, it's time to retire.

[00:54] We're gonna talk about Brian Eddy making a game that's gonna now dethrone Brian Eddy's current release in freakin Stranger Things coming back.

[01:03] We're gonna talk about, maybe we talk about the Chicago PD, might need to get involved.

[01:08] If Canada goes to the media mixer, Canada has been threatened with police intervention, but he's not gonna let the haters get him down.

[01:15] Let's get into it right now on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, because we have so much more interesting Pinball news to talk about.

[01:22] First and foremost, I want to say thank you to everybody who's been sharing photos of your physical transformations with me.

[01:29] I'm so happy that this show has inspired some of you to care more about yourselves than your pinball machines, and all I ask of each and every one of you is just take 20 minutes a day and apply it to thinking about what you eat, your exercise,

[01:42] and don't play as much pinball as you take care of yourselves.

[01:46] I said this, if you just spend a quarter of time exercising as opposed to playing pinball machines, you would both be better at pinball and at life.

[01:54] So let's get everybody to the final wizard mode in life.

[01:57] Alright, let's get right to it.

[01:58] So Venom, I went to Jack Bar.

[02:00] There was nobody on the machine, finally for once, nobody was hogging the machine.

[02:05] It was a beautiful day outside, and that's why nobody was on the machine, and so I got to play this machine 20 times.

[02:11] And I've heard the hype, I've heard the concerns, I've heard everything about this game, and what was nice about playing Venom at Jack Bar is I could go from Godzilla to Foo Fighters to Venom.

[02:21] And I played all three games over and over and over again, and here's my first impressions on Venom Pinball Machine.

[02:29] If you have an order in on a Venom, I would cancel the order.

[02:33] This game is just mediocre.

[02:36] It is mediocre in every sense of the word.

[02:39] The only thing interesting happening in this game is in the art package itself, but man, this game is so just up and down.

[02:47] The more I played the game, the more I was just longing for some left to right action in the machine.

[02:53] Every single shot is just north to south, south to north, waiting for the ball to come back down.

[03:00] And yes, I get those interesting ball locks that dispense the ball like when you hit some of the ramps, but that does not make the machine that interesting.

[03:08] I was craving for something more unique to happen in the gameplay of the game itself.

[03:13] And then you look at the code of the game and what's happening in the game, and it's a combination of all that's wrong with some of these modern pinball attempts.

[03:21] Everything is happening on the screen.

[03:23] You walk up to this game on location and you can't just start playing the game.

[03:26] The game doesn't really talk to you or tell you what to do.

[03:29] You have to study each different like symbiote and its attributes and what the benefits are of choosing each one.

[03:35] And just think about that for a minute.

[03:37] You walk up to a game and for the first time you got to sit there and read all of these different qualities of all of these different symbiotes.

[03:44] And then you have to select them and then remember what you just read as you're playing the pinball machine.

[03:49] And when you start playing the pinball machine, you feel absolutely nothing.

[03:53] That's the thing about Venom to me.

[03:55] It's like I didn't really bring much to Venom, but man, what is even going on in this game?

[04:00] The play field is filled with all of these inserts two times, three times, four times, five times, seven times.

[04:06] I'll tell you this for the tenth time in a row, people.

[04:09] Venom is just a mediocre pinball machine that is never going to hold any single value.

[04:14] And I don't understand how Stern could with a straight face price this pinball machine at $3,000 more for an LE than freaking Godzilla was.

[04:24] And then I went over to Foo Fighters and oh my gosh, what a better design.

[04:29] What a better layout. And it was a Foo Fighters Pro.

[04:32] It wasn't like this is Foo Fighters Premium.

[04:34] Maybe it was Foo Fighters Premium. I think it's a Foo Fighters Pro.

[04:36] But there's so much more in Foo Fighters than there is in Venom.

[04:41] No, it's a Foo Fighters Pro at Jack Bar.

[04:43] And then you go over to freaking Godzilla and there's like four times more things to do in that game than in Venom.

[04:50] And that's the problem with this game.

[04:52] It's like for this much money, I don't know how you wake up and buy this game.

[04:56] This is going to be a bargain basement game so quickly in the world of pinball.

[05:00] And nobody considers this game to be a failure more than Stern pinball themselves.

[05:06] Because this is Brian Eddy's game.

[05:08] And what are they doing knowing that sales have tanked on Venom already?

[05:12] What are they going to do?

[05:13] They're going to re-release this Tuesday tomorrow.

[05:16] Stranger things again.

[05:18] Oh my gosh, have we ever seen this before?

[05:20] They're absolutely going to trump Brian Eddy's new game with one of Brian Eddy's older titles.

[05:26] And if that doesn't send a signal to everybody in this pinball world that Stern pinball is capable of failure.

[05:33] But look how quickly they can erase their failures by just vaulting a game that was more successful and has a lot more demand.

[05:40] Something about all of this just isn't sitting well with me.

[05:43] You're going to bring back Stranger Things and charge so much more for it.

[05:47] The rumor is they are going to make the projector even better in this version of Stranger Things.

[05:52] Cool.

[05:53] So then what about all the older Stranger Things owners?

[05:56] Are you going to make them pay more money to get the better projector?

[05:59] And then is the UV kit going to come installed in the game?

[06:02] Because the UV kit was like 260 bucks.

[06:05] And so we know Stern pinball does not leave money on the table.

[06:08] So are we going to see a Stranger Things premium for like $10,250 I think we might.

[06:15] But again, I just zoom out a little bit and I'm like, how can Stern pinball price Venom as much as games that are far superior?

[06:23] And is every single pinball machine from Stern pinball going to be this expensive and then some?

[06:30] No matter the theme, no matter how much is in it, no matter how much creativity goes into the actual product itself.

[06:37] I don't get it.

[06:38] You know, they make too many products for every single one to be the same price.

[06:42] Right.

[06:43] If they were just making one a year, I would get it.

[06:45] But now that they're making like three a year plus vaults plus reruns of anniversary editions of stuff like Jurassic Park, which by the way is still not sold out.

[06:54] So people are pushing back a little bit.

[06:56] And so here's what I think is going to happen.

[06:58] I think we're going to see Stranger Things pro and premium tomorrow.

[07:01] I don't think we're going to see an L.E. or anniversary edition.

[07:04] And the reason why is it's not an anniversary year of the show Stranger Things.

[07:09] I do think they're going to run more Stranger Things L.E.s down the road as an anniversary vault.

[07:15] They've got all the parts to do it.

[07:17] All they need to do is change the cabinet decals and then the translate and wallah.

[07:21] You got a 13 or $15,000 anniversary edition of a game that came out years ago.

[07:27] I also think Stranger Things is a game that's a little bit like Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:32] I think there's fondness for it because it's hard to get.

[07:35] I think when it was easily available, there wasn't that much fondness.

[07:39] And I think there's this weird fomo that happens that a lot of people haven't been able to play as Stranger Things

[07:44] because the run of Stranger Things didn't happen that long because when it came out, it wasn't very popular.

[07:49] And so now that everybody can get their hands on one, is that going to diminish a little bit of people's reception to the game?

[07:57] We shall see.

[07:58] I'm not excited about what's behind this.

[08:00] I'm excited about what's down the road.

[08:02] So let's go on to what's down the road in Pinball.

[08:05] And let's talk about this mystery pinball machine that is coming to Expo this year.

[08:10] In just three weeks, this company is going to bring new in-box games to Pinball Expo

[08:16] so people can go to the show itself, see the new game, put it in the back of their trucker van,

[08:22] and drive it home and own it that day.

[08:24] This company has looked at the entire industry.

[08:26] They've seen every mistake that every boutique has made and they are not going to repeat those mistakes.

[08:32] This is great.

[08:33] This is in Haggis Pinball where it's like send your money in and in eight years from now you're going to get your game.

[08:38] No, these guys are showing up on day one with games made, with manufacturing happening.

[08:43] None of the shenanigans.

[08:45] I don't know if they're going to ask for nonrefundable deposits if they get a few hundred orders,

[08:49] but we will see what happens.

[08:50] Now the real story is the theme of this game.

[08:53] This game is most likely going to be, as Canada predicted, Labyrinth.

[08:57] Jim Henson directed David Bowie movie with Jennifer Connelly.

[09:01] Labyrinth from 1986.

[09:04] It's a really quirky movie.

[09:06] It's up there with movies like The Never-Ending Story.

[09:09] I think a lot of people's wives love this movie more than you do.

[09:14] So you might have a wife out there that's like, yes, let's go get Labyrinth.

[09:18] Now on a theme alone basis, if this is true and this is the theme of this game,

[09:23] and the reason why I made this prediction to be Labyrinth other than the clues,

[09:27] that said stuff like upside down, turn your world upside down and rock and roll,

[09:32] and the actual flipper was amazing, the puzzle itself,

[09:36] and George Jr. is referring to George Lucas Jr., who was the executive producer of Labyrinth.

[09:42] So it's all right there.

[09:44] But the real clue I knew about that some of you didn't pick up on, this was years ago,

[09:49] when David Van S left Spooky Pimble.

[09:52] The reason he left Spooky Pimble, and if you don't know who David Van S is,

[09:56] he's super talented, he's super amazing.

[09:58] He did all of the animations on games like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[10:03] that were incredible. He did animations on Rick and Morty, and he left Spooky Pimble.

[10:08] You know why he left?

[10:09] Because he wanted a chance to make his game with Spooky Pimble.

[10:13] Because if you don't know what happens when you make a game with Spooky, you get paid more money.

[10:18] Scott Denise made a lot of money making Rick and Morty for Spooky Pimble

[10:22] because they got a certain amount of money per game sold.

[10:25] So let's just say you even make like $500 per game, and you sell freaking 750 games.

[10:33] That's a lot of money in the bank.

[10:35] And David Van S wanted to make Labyrinth with Spooky Pimble,

[10:39] and they did not want to make the game, and David Van S departed Spooky Pimble.

[10:44] Now all of a sudden, here we are, like years later, we've got Fast Pimble making the boards for this game.

[10:51] I've been hearing rumors that there are people we know and trust in the industry behind this title.

[10:56] I've been asked by people associated with the game to keep an open mind about the theme.

[11:01] Now you know when Canadian heroes are a theme like Labyrinth, it is not something that says,

[11:06] Take my money now.

[11:08] Now that being said, when we saw the underside of the play field, it looks like there's a lot of stuff happening in this game.

[11:14] There's two magnets, it looks like there's an upper play field.

[11:17] There's subways, there's scoops, there's Vux.

[11:20] It seems like this game is going to be pretty loaded.

[11:22] We know the artwork is going to be beautiful.

[11:25] And so now we know that this thing is happening in three weeks.

[11:28] Let's just talk about the theme.

[11:30] There's no way around it for most of us out there.

[11:33] This is not a Take my money now theme.

[11:36] They're going to have to win us over and take us through an emotional labyrinth to get to a place where we're going to buy this game.

[11:43] And the other thing is this is how much is this game going to cost?

[11:46] How many a week are they going to make?

[11:49] And you know, there's a lot of questions that have yet to be answered with this game.

[11:53] Who's coding this game?

[11:54] What are the animations going to be like?

[11:56] They're going to be good if it's David Van Es.

[11:58] But man, are they going to get all the assets from the movie?

[12:01] And there's other people that have said this, like the soundtrack in this movie is not the most amazing soundtrack.

[12:07] But are they going to get all the clips with David Bowie with the music with Jennifer Connolly?

[12:12] And I think if they can package it all together in a really unique way and make the game look stunning and make a real world under glass, they do have a fighting chance.

[12:23] You know what I think is going to happen?

[12:24] I think this game is going to come out.

[12:26] I think it's going to be received very positively because of everybody behind it.

[12:30] And I think the game itself is going to be embarrassing to games like Galactic Tank Force.

[12:36] I think what's in this game is going to be embarrassing to games like Venom.

[12:40] I think it's going to be embarrassing to games like The Godfather.

[12:44] And I think if you're like me, a lot of us have been watching this industry over the last few years and we're like, where is this industry going?

[12:52] Why aren't these companies putting more into the games?

[12:55] Why isn't there more hunger and desire and drive to show us what these companies are capable of?

[13:01] And the offerings we've been getting over the last few years have been mediocre.

[13:05] Every once in a while there's a good game, but for the most part, all of these boutique companies haven't really brought the fire.

[13:12] And I think we're looking for a company to make a name for itself.

[13:15] This company wants to do that.

[13:17] I think we're looking for a company to show us true creativity underneath the play field.

[13:21] I think this company is looking to do that.

[13:23] I think we're looking for a company to do physical, mechanical stuff in machines that makes us smile and makes us say, wow, did you see what the ball did?

[13:31] I think this company is going to do that.

[13:33] And this is just game one from this company.

[13:35] And if they can come out of the gate, and this is a fair thing, if this company can come out of the gate with a game better than Galactic Tank Force,

[13:42] come out of the gate with a game more inspiring than Toy Story 4 and The Godfather,

[13:47] if they can come out of the gate with a game that looks much better than Venom,

[13:50] then I really do think people are going to keep an open mind.

[13:53] And I think having some variety that has some passion in it is sorely needed in this pinball industry.

[14:00] I've been talking to a lot of you offline.

[14:02] A lot of you are starting to lose your love with the hobby.

[14:06] The high prices have you feeling overwhelmed.

[14:09] What you're seeing in front of you you know is not worth it.

[14:13] The narrative being driven by other pinball media to just buy every single thing that comes out has exhausted you.

[14:20] Those people have worked against this hobby.

[14:23] They haven't demanded more in pinball and the prices are going through the roof and it's not a fun thing to cheerlead.

[14:29] And I think for a lot of you out there, you're like me.

[14:32] We want games worth cheerleading and we're really rooting for this new company.

[14:37] We were all rooting for Galactic Tank Force.

[14:39] We didn't want that game to tank.

[14:41] They made it tank because the game is uninspired on every single level.

[14:46] And people think like oh the artwork is so amazing on Galactic Tank Force.

[14:50] Go look at that play field.

[14:51] Lift up that play field.

[14:52] There's like nothing on it.

[14:54] It's like all gradient colors.

[14:56] Where is the inspired artwork everybody's talking about?

[14:59] You know Christopher Franchi is capable of amazing things,

[15:02] but man there's not an amazing amount of Franchi detail on that game.

[15:06] Alright so that's the mystery pinball company.

[15:08] Wow.

[15:09] Alright so we're going to see this game in just three weeks.

[15:12] On top of this game coming out in three weeks,

[15:14] we are also going to see a new game from the pinball brothers.

[15:18] Woo.

[15:19] Who's ready for a remake from the pinball brothers?

[15:22] And apparently the pinball brothers is making other major moves with somebody who's a US based pinball company.

[15:28] I don't know what that's going to be.

[15:29] It's probably just going to be some exclusive distributor announcement.

[15:32] So here's the thing people.

[15:33] I'm just going to tell you this right now.

[15:35] Here's the thing.

[15:36] I don't even understand why you buy anything right now.

[15:38] You're really in this camp.

[15:39] Like why would you buy anything right now when you're seeing what's happening to these use game prices?

[15:45] When you know the fact that Keith Elwin's game is around the corner,

[15:48] and I'm about to tell you something right now people that I think might blow all of your minds.

[15:53] I'm really excited about this people.

[15:55] I know Jersey Jack's going to try to get you to buy Elton John.

[15:59] Pinball brothers want you to buy a remake.

[16:02] Mystery pinball company, they want you to buy Labyrinth if that's the theme.

[16:06] I've been hearing very strong rumors that a theme that everybody really wants, right?

[16:11] Because that's the camp we're in.

[16:13] The theme everybody really wants.

[16:15] And if you really had to hold on to your pennies, you would wait because I'm hearing that back to the future is happening people.

[16:22] And it's not happening by stern pinball.

[16:25] And I'm just going to leave it at that.

[16:26] I'm going to leave it at that.

[16:27] I know more information than that and I will reveal it over time.

[16:31] But I'm just telling you right now.

[16:32] Everyone thinks, oh, only Joe Kamikaw can go get a theme.

[16:36] Well, that's not what I'm hearing.

[16:38] Now look, I might be wrong on this, but I'm hearing it is coming and it is not coming from stern pinball.

[16:43] And now it gets real fun, right?

[16:45] What moment do I jump in, Chris?

[16:47] How can you do this to me?

[16:48] I'm about to spend $10,000 on stranger things.

[16:52] And now you're telling me we might get back to the future.

[16:55] How am I supposed to live in a world like this, Chris?

[16:57] I'm about to drop so much money on Joe's pinball, but I much prefer back to the future as a pinball theme.

[17:03] And that's my point, everybody, is look, my advice to each and every one of you is take care of yourselves.

[17:10] Weed out your pinball collections.

[17:12] If you've had games in your collection and you don't play very often, just get rid of it.

[17:16] Sell it now because we all know that this market is sliding down.

[17:20] When I did that other show that showed you how ridiculous the price has got, what goes up must come down.

[17:26] And we're going to see a real softening of the pinball market.

[17:30] And you know who's going to kill it?

[17:31] You know who's going to kill the pinball secondhand market?

[17:34] It's just going to be stern pinball.

[17:36] If they make this many games every single week, I mean, think about the pressure they're going to put onto their distributors to have to get all of these games.

[17:44] I mean, these distributors are sitting on Venoms.

[17:47] They're sitting on Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary editions.

[17:50] They're going to have to buy all these stranger things and then they're going to have to absorb every single new stern machine.

[17:56] If you just think about that for a second, how is that model sustainable?

[18:00] How are they going to keep three games plus a vault, all of these titles coming one after another, plus all these other pinball companies trying to get our money?

[18:10] And first and foremost, I want to thank each and every one of you that reached out to me and said, hey, Chris, I know you're taking Killy into Disney World,

[18:18] but don't spend the entire time in the animal kingdom.

[18:22] Your fears have been addressed.

[18:24] We booked Disney World and we're going to stay in the Magic Kingdom at the contemporary hotel and we will spend a day or half day at the animal kingdom.

[18:34] So thank you so much, everybody, for reaching out.

[18:36] But I'm just going to tell you this right now.

[18:38] A Disney vacation is the price of a pinball machine and I would much rather have that experience for Killy and the family than just put another pinball machine in the room.

[18:50] And I know a lot of us are feeling this way.

[18:52] For this much money, you better bring the magic and that's all we want.

[18:55] That's all we really want.

[18:57] And I'm looking forward to Expo.

[18:59] I'm looking forward to getting excited about this stuff.

[19:02] I'm looking forward to seeing what these companies put in front of us.

[19:05] I'm not going anywhere.

[19:07] Last weekend I was threatened with the Chicago Police Department.

[19:11] We're going to be called if I showed up to the Pinball Media Mixer.

[19:15] Everybody, it's gone too far.

[19:17] I have no hatred for anybody in the Pinball Media.

[19:19] I'm so tired of all these people saying they're going to call the police who usually have to deal with real serious issues.

[19:25] They're going to come get Canada.

[19:27] Everybody, Canada's at the Media Mixer.

[19:29] What do we do?

[19:31] What if you just let them in?

[19:33] What if we just had a few beers?

[19:35] Life is way too short.

[19:37] This ongoing effort to cancel Canada is just never going to work.

[19:40] I'm so happy to see at the end of the month we lost our obligatory 15 people.

[19:45] We're still right around 600 subscribers.

[19:47] Thank you everybody for being a member of the Canada Club.

[19:50] And hey, if you want to up your subscription, I really do appreciate it.

[19:54] And I love doing this show and I love talking about pinball.

[19:57] But I'm so honest when I say this to you.

[19:59] It means more to me when you tell me that not only did you make better pinball decisions because of me,

[20:05] but you decided to change your life a little bit for the positive.

[20:09] I love seeing those transformations on my Facebook page.

[20:13] I can't wait to get back to doing the Facebook Live, the Saturday morning spectacular,

[20:18] during Pinball Expo.

[20:20] I'm going to take a little bit of a break, but as you saw this weekend,

[20:23] I was up at four in the morning, first person to break the news about Labyrinth,

[20:28] and thank you so much, Jason Napsy.

[20:30] No bad blood. I mean, come on.

[20:32] You know, there's no bad blood between pinball media.

[20:34] Nothing is personal.

[20:36] It's time we move on and just focus on these machines.

[20:38] Everybody have a great Monday.

[20:40] Venom is a dud.

[20:42] If you have a venom order, get rid of it.

[20:44] I mean it.

[20:45] If you have a venom LE, you just lost $3,000.

[20:48] I mean it.

[20:49] This game is boring.

[20:50] It is the worst combination of boring layout with Dwight Encode,

[20:55] which is just like what the heck is going on in this game.

[20:58] None of it is emotive.

[21:00] None of it makes you feel anything.

[21:01] It's just all over the place.

[21:03] Like what a total mistake game.

[21:05] I'm sorry.

[21:06] I'm usually not this harsh on a pinball machine.

[21:09] But again, at these prices, if a game comes out like venom and it's just,

[21:14] then I'm really upset.

[21:16] And it feels like this game should have came out two years ago, right?

[21:19] Like they needed to get venom out before Foo Fighters,

[21:22] because once Foo Fighters dropped and showed us new creativity and pinball,

[21:27] Brian Eddy, he just looks like he's out of ideas.

[21:30] And I'm sorry, Brian, but you can't just keep doing fan layout after fan layout.

[21:35] You've got to get more creative.

[21:37] This game needs an upper flipper.

[21:38] I mean this.

[21:39] When I was playing venom, all I was wishing for, it needs an upper flipper.

[21:43] It needs more shots left to right.

[21:45] It's absolutely boring.

[21:46] Every time the ball heads towards the sides of the cabinet,

[21:49] it's doing nothing interesting.

[21:50] There's no shots there whatsoever.

[21:52] And then you go over to Godzilla.

[21:54] There's like five times as many shots.

[21:55] You go over to Foo Fighters.

[21:56] There's action at all different distances from the flippers left and right.

[22:00] There's stuff happening everywhere.

[22:02] And then you walk up to venom.

[22:03] And then you want to charge me 13,000, 10,000, 7,000 for that uninspired game.

[22:09] No way, Sturm Pinball.

[22:10] We are over it.

[22:11] You can't hide behind Zambietti's artwork forever.

[22:14] You got to put more mechanical magic into the game.

[22:17] And it's not a doppelganger swinging out with USB sticks hanging from his butt.

[22:21] Everybody, welcome to the Greatest Pinball Podcast on Planet Earth.

[22:24] This winter we're going to show it with the trippy voting.

[22:26] And we're going to clobber everybody that hates Canadian Pinball Podcasts.

[22:29] Have a great day.

[22:30] We'll talk to you soon.

[22:47] Thank you.
