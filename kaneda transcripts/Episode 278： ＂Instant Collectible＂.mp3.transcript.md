[00:00] You know, say goodbye, you'll be fine, the reason in my life, because you know, but all I really, all I've been through

[00:17] I feel like that John Cicada song is how Hilton feels about me in the pinball world everybody, but welcome to episode like 200 and I think 78 of

[00:34] Canadian pinball podcast I'm starting to lose track myself. I'm happy happy Friday everybody. I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm coming off of like a sugar overdose from Halloween.

[00:45] But on this episode we're going to talk about what's going on in the pinball world as we always do. I'm happy to report that Mr. Ben Heck will be joining the show. I'm going to be interviewing him Sunday evening, so we will get that for you next week. I can't wait to have Ben back on Canadian pinball podcast. So here's what I want to do on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast. We're going to do a little bit of housekeeping, go over some of the news items happening in the pinball world. And then I want to read some

[01:15] of your emails and then I want to close out the show with a longer email I got that was very thought provoking and I want to share it with you on this show. How does that sound for a Friday edition going into your weekend, Canadian pinball podcast. All right, let's start out with spooky pinball. So Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is finally going into boxes and making its way into the homes of consumers.

[01:44] And we congratulate everyone who has worked on this game to get the game into boxes and into the hands of the pinheads out there who have been waiting for this game. We always we always will celebrate the moment in which a pinball company delivers what they promise and sends people the games they pay for that is always what we want to see on this show.

[02:09] I have been following the thread and I think what people have been asking for for this game is some decent video footage of the game itself and maybe Chuck should make a call over to Jack Danger and have him do a streaming of the game now that it feels like it's it's ready to go and the code is further along and it could be a good time to send people.

[02:34] Out to spooky pinball to record this game and let people see what it plays like but here's the thing I still don't think you can ever ever ever fully know that you want to buy a pinball machine until you actually flip it I really don't think you'll ever get enough information from a stream or from artwork or from any video for that for that matter that will give you definitively the info you need to pull the track.

[03:04] And we all know that most people buy their games without playing them first and well not most people but the Ellie owners and you have to consider this game a little bit of an Ellie there's only going to be 500 so for people overseas in Europe they are never going to get a chance to play one before they have to buy one.

[03:27] So someone has to take the first plunge and then maybe once someone gets someone in England and Australia and New Zealand and wherever pinball is played globally then you have to go find one either in a collector's home or on location before you can figure out if you want it or not.

[03:44] But look I still think spooky should put together better video for people to at least see the game in a better light for those people who want video before making a decision on the game but I do recommend playing the game first because I'm still hearing that the shots are really tight on this game not who deenie crazy type it's still tight enough to the point where people will make the excuse that it makes me a better player.

[04:11] That's what pinball is supposed to do make you better.

[04:15] Alright so that's what's happening at spooky.

[04:18] Jersey Jack Pinball another company which November what November 2nd right now they are getting their games out the door as well.

[04:26] I am seeing more and more pirates of the Caribbean unboxings and that is another good thing.

[04:33] I still can't believe that it's November of 2018 and Pirates of the Caribbean is just trickling out.

[04:42] But if you read the thread and you read about people who are unboxing Pirates of the Caribbean I think you'll see one thing.

[04:52] I think you will see that people are enjoying the game but I also think you're going to see a lot of people and look there hasn't been many that have been shipped yet.

[05:02] People are having a lot of quality control issues with the game and this is why Stern Pinball probably doesn't try to put tons of new engineered

[05:14] mechs into their games because that seems to be the issue is these things don't feel like they are traveling well from J.J.P. Factory to people's homes without stuff happening.

[05:29] And you have to ask the question how well were these games quality controlled before they went on the line and will Jersey Jack get these games a little bit more bullet proof?

[05:43] Because we all know this when you spend this kind of money I mean we were talking 9500 dollars on a pirate to the Caribbean limited edition.

[05:52] You spend that much money and the last thing you want to do when you plug in your new game is have to lift the glass off it and start trying to fix stuff.

[06:02] Nobody likes a brand new toy that breaks or has issues right upon delivery of the game.

[06:11] Hopefully that won't be an issue for long hopefully some of the feedback they get from the inaugural owners will make it way back to J.J.P.

[06:20] and this game will be more rock solid moving forward. I think it's fair I'm not going to say anything else about the game.

[06:27] I'm just happy they're getting to people who paid for them.

[06:30] Alright what else is going on we covered spooky we covered J.J.P.

[06:34] Shall we go over I'm going to hold off on stern let's go to October fest so American pinball they've weathered the storm of monkey gate 2018 we will talk more about that with Ben heck.

[06:50] I'm here to tell you that I don't think normal is coming on the show and I also never got answers to my emails that I sent to him.

[07:02] I sent one email with questions and he said he would answer them and then he never did.

[07:09] So look I know I'm just a puny little pinball podcast.

[07:13] I know I only have around 1500 people who listen to this show. I mean that's that's tiny in comparison to other podcasts that are out there but it's a decent amount of pinball collectors who do listen to this show.

[07:29] And my whole thing is this I'm not going to go off and personally attack anybody if he's busy he's busy but here's the thing if you're going to say you're going to do something and you give me a date by which I can't do it.

[07:42] Date by which I can expect answers or you tell me you'll come on the show after expo and then you don't and you go silent and you don't respond.

[07:54] You know there's nothing I can do then say I think you shouldn't tell me what you're going to do if you're not going to do it.

[08:03] Just do it. I mean I don't care if this guy is like Chris I'm never coming on the show that's cool I respect that but just don't tell me you're going to do something and then not do it.

[08:11] What's going to happen if you do that well nothing much but I also think it how it hurts them I think nothing comes of it if they bail on either coming on the show or just answering my questions and let me tell you guys the questions I had of them were just you know are you guys going to really reassess the art package on Houdini and I at this point I didn't even see or realize there was monkey gate.

[08:38] So I was just asking them questions like you know are you going to declutter the play field art a little bit are you going to change autos 3d sculpted head so it looks more like auto are you going to remove the mustache from the woman on the right plastic because it looks really strange like stuff like that like what what are you going to do about the animations between now in a ship date right are you going to be able to significantly improve what the animations are on the screen and I think these are fair.

[09:07] And I think these are fair questions because people are being asked to give their money for October fest right now I still can't help but laugh that October fest 2018 shipping in January of 2019 I really want to talk to him about the marketing and the other thing that he wanted to talk to me about was the marketing of American pinball games and also moving forward what kinds of theme.

[09:37] And titles would be good for American pinball to think about as they make future machines because look I'm just going to say it one more time.

[09:49] This is not a theme that anybody wants can we be honest with ourselves nobody would write down if you could write down your top two themes it you would love to see come out in 2018 2019 if we if we

[10:07] We sampled everybody in the pinball world.

[10:09] I'm talking, if you took 5,000 pinball buyers,

[10:13] and you said, give me five themes that you would want to see

[10:17] in 2018, 2019, I don't think anybody would write

[10:23] October Fest or Pirates of the Caribbean

[10:26] and put it into that hat, all right?

[10:28] And so that's just where we're at.

[10:30] And I think because theme matters so much,

[10:35] I really think this game's gonna struggle.

[10:36] I do.

[10:37] I literally, how do you wake up tomorrow

[10:40] when you can buy a gorgeous monster bash remake

[10:44] where you know monsters is around the corner?

[10:47] You know, you know, like Pirates of the Caribbean

[10:49] is shipping.

[10:50] How do you wake up out of those three titles

[10:53] and say, you know, no, no, I'm gonna pass.

[10:58] I think it's October Fest.

[11:00] I really think that's the one for me.

[11:01] I just don't think you've seen enough

[11:03] to bump it to the top of your list.

[11:06] And so I would love to have them come on

[11:08] and talk about the positive changes

[11:11] they're gonna make to the game

[11:12] and what they're gonna do with the feedback

[11:14] they got from Expo, okay?

[11:16] The floor is theirs if they would like it.

[11:18] All right, so we've covered off on American Pinball,

[11:22] spooky, J.J.P., monster bash remake, not much to say.

[11:26] Again, you know, it's almost like what I'm not talking about

[11:29] a game that usually means things are going really well.

[11:34] There's not a lot to discuss other than I think

[11:36] people are in love with this game.

[11:38] And I think every day, more and more monster bash remake

[11:43] Elis are gonna be selling.

[11:44] And I would not be surprised if this game sells

[11:47] all 1,250 by the end of the year,

[11:50] especially if monsters is a little underwhelming.

[11:53] All right, all right, let's talk now about Stern, okay?

[11:59] Because Stern is where the rest of the action is happening.

[12:01] Now for some reason, no matter what happens

[12:04] over the last few weeks, everyone is still obsessed

[12:08] with complaining about the Beatles.

[12:09] And look, I'm gonna go back to it in a little bit,

[12:11] but there is nothing I can do other than watch all of you

[12:17] get so heated and so bent at a shape

[12:21] about the Beatles title.

[12:22] And I'm gonna talk a little bit more about this

[12:24] when I read the email from a very, very passionate pinhead.

[12:28] He talks a lot about why he thinks Stern is backed up

[12:32] into the corner a little bit with the Beatles title.

[12:36] But before the Beatles, we have to talk about

[12:39] Bill and Ted's excellent adventure,

[12:43] Pimball or excellent Pimball adventure.

[12:45] So if you haven't seen it already,

[12:47] there is a picture that leaked of Bill and Ted's

[12:51] excellent Pimball adventure.

[12:53] And it's got the Stern logo in the upper left

[12:56] and the sort of like the Stern animated pinball

[12:59] near the Bill and Ted logo.

[13:01] And people were sending this to me today saying,

[13:03] look at this.

[13:04] And then Christopher Franchie chimed in and said,

[13:07] oh my God, how long did this is deleted?

[13:09] It's gonna open up a can of worms.

[13:11] And apparently it first appeared on the dead flip

[13:16] Facebook page.

[13:18] And so I just wanna say that while this might make sense

[13:23] because Bill and Ted's excellent adventure

[13:25] is being rebooted for 2019.

[13:28] So there's a new movie coming out the third one in 2019.

[13:32] And it definitely hits the demographic

[13:35] for the Pimball buyer.

[13:36] I mean, this movie is a classic.

[13:39] I think a lot of people love Bill and Ted's excellent

[13:42] adventure and it's the fun, campy, great music,

[13:47] great storyline, perfect kind of throwback theme

[13:51] for a pinball adventure.

[13:53] So I look, so that's me saying,

[13:55] yes, I think Bill and Ted's excellent pinball adventure

[13:59] would make a great game.

[14:00] Do I think that this image is a leak from Stern

[14:06] that kind of confirms it's in the works?

[14:09] No, it absolutely not.

[14:11] I do not think this thing is anyway shape or form from Stern.

[14:17] It is so easy to create this.

[14:21] It is so easy to take the Bill and Ted's logo

[14:24] and make this thing that was being passed around.

[14:27] I think people are just trolling the Pimball community.

[14:31] Do you know how easy it is to give anyone

[14:34] with any graphic design skills the Stern logo

[14:38] and that sort of like and get them to create

[14:41] Pimball versions of iconic classic like movies

[14:46] and TV shows, you know, big pinball trouble

[14:49] and little China.

[14:51] It'd be so easy to do that stuff.

[14:53] I mean, not hard at all.

[14:56] So I just think this was a Jack Danger

[14:59] and the people at Stern just trolling,

[15:02] trolling the Pimball world, all right.

[15:05] All right, let's go back to Beatles for a little bit

[15:07] because I think some of you out there

[15:10] probably think I'm being a little too soft on this game.

[15:15] Like I'm not screaming from the rooftops

[15:17] about Beatles Pimball and here's what I want to do to even

[15:21] things out because part of me doesn't really care

[15:25] about this theme and I think that's probably

[15:28] one of the reasons why I'm not overly upset

[15:32] or destroyed by what Stern showed.

[15:35] I also just think it's a cool looking game

[15:38] for that's more accessible for many people to play

[15:41] and I think that variety is necessary in Pimball.

[15:45] But, but I'll say this, I read a couple stories

[15:50] about this Pimball machine in the press

[15:53] and there was one in the Chicago Sun Times

[15:56] and there was one in the Las Vegas Review Journal

[15:59] about Joe Kamikaw being behind this machine.

[16:02] And so the headline in the Chicago Sun Times was

[16:07] first ever Beatles Pimball game could be

[16:10] priciest machine of all time.

[16:14] Now isn't that an incredibly dramatic headline?

[16:19] But what's so weird about this story

[16:21] is that they don't say what the price is.

[16:24] Lower in the story, they do talk about

[16:27] how Batman Super Ellie was $15,000

[16:31] and how magic girl, if you can consider that

[16:34] a real Pimball machine was $16,000.

[16:37] All right, and normally Stern's ranged from $6,000 to $9,000.

[16:41] So, why does that headline say that?

[16:45] Can I even speak tonight?

[16:46] Are you hearing me?

[16:47] I feel like I'm like losing it.

[16:49] Why would this headline talk about it being

[16:51] the priciest machine of all time?

[16:52] Did they tell the reporter off the record

[16:55] what it would be?

[16:56] But here's the thing about this game.

[16:58] If you read this story and you read the way Stern

[17:01] is talking about the Beatles Pimball machine,

[17:04] here's the issue I have.

[17:06] And again, I don't have an issue with the game,

[17:08] but I do have an issue with them

[17:11] hyping this thing as already being a collectible.

[17:16] Like literally, it's like that is like their line

[17:19] and they're sticking to it.

[17:20] No matter what this game is,

[17:23] no matter what the design is,

[17:24] no matter what the code is,

[17:26] no matter what the demand is,

[17:28] they are prematurely, I think, saying,

[17:32] and hyping this game as being an instant collectible.

[17:36] And as you all know,

[17:38] I don't think something is an instant collectible.

[17:42] I think things become collectible

[17:44] because there's a demand to collect it.

[17:47] And if the demand is there, then it will be collected

[17:50] in by the hundreds.

[17:52] And people have said this, like why has,

[17:55] like Iron Maiden Ellie sold out so quickly,

[17:57] but Beatles, it's not sold out.

[17:59] But the thing is, if Beatles is not for sale yet.

[18:01] So we will find out, I think next week,

[18:05] Beatles' pricing will be revealed.

[18:07] And the big question still remains,

[18:09] what is the pricing of the game?

[18:11] Did Stern, did Stern purposely leak through their distributors

[18:18] a variety of prices to then read what people's feedback is

[18:24] and then price it accordingly?

[18:27] That seems like a somewhat smart thing to do, right?

[18:30] They could simply float suggestions by distributors,

[18:36] manufacturers suggest it retail price

[18:40] and then let those distributors, you know,

[18:43] deliver the news as some of their customers

[18:45] and then what happens, it's up on Pinside.

[18:46] My distributor told me 50,000 for the diamond.

[18:49] Mine told me 25, mine told me this, mine told me that.

[18:52] And that's what we've been doing, think about it.

[18:55] All of you, for the last two weeks,

[18:58] you've been on Stern's payroll, giving them 100% free,

[19:04] 100% free focus groups, and they don't even have to pay for it.

[19:07] Normally, companies have to pay for things like this,

[19:10] but they can just listen to all you suckers,

[19:13] give it to them for free.

[19:15] And maybe you're whining and moaning and complaining

[19:17] will actually have an impact on the price.

[19:20] So that could be a good thing.

[19:23] Now, I don't know what the final price of this game

[19:26] is gonna be.

[19:27] It's a little strange because in the Joe Kamikaze story

[19:31] in the Las Vegas Review Journal,

[19:33] he talks about how it's gonna be less than $10,000.

[19:37] Now he doesn't say that all three additions

[19:40] are gonna be less than $10,000,

[19:42] but he does say it will be less than that,

[19:45] which makes it strange for him to say less than $10,000

[19:50] in his story, and yet the Chicago Sun Time story

[19:53] says it could be the priceless machine of all time.

[19:56] But here's what I found was kinda ridiculous.

[19:58] And look, I get why they did this.

[20:00] This is what I do for a living.

[20:01] I'm in PR, is like somebody set up this story.

[20:05] Somebody called the Chicago Sun Times

[20:07] and said the first Beatles Pimmel Machine ever

[20:10] is being made by us, and we love to do a story.

[20:13] All right, but here's what I wanna read for you.

[20:16] So Gary Stern is quoted in the article,

[20:21] and he says, it's a title of a lifetime.

[20:25] I'm 73, and I may need to retire after this one.

[20:30] It's the culmination of my career, said Stern.

[20:35] The culmination Gary, the culmination of Stern Pimbles

[20:40] 30 plus years of making Pimble

[20:44] is re-skinning, see which?

[20:47] I mean, when I read that, I was like,

[20:49] are you kidding me Gary?

[20:50] This is not the culmination of Pimble.

[20:54] This game does not represent everything you know

[20:57] up to this point.

[20:59] You're gonna retire after Beatles,

[21:01] because you've maybe, you consider this to be doing it all.

[21:06] Like we got the impossible license

[21:08] that no one else could ever get.

[21:10] Like this was the white whale of Pimble.

[21:14] I just, I couldn't help but chuckle when I read that,

[21:18] because I don't think this game comes anywhere close

[21:21] to being the culmination of everything Stern knows to date.

[21:26] And Gary, you're not gonna retire.

[21:28] You know why you're not gonna retire Gary?

[21:30] Why would you retire now?

[21:32] When you've got hundreds, if not thousands of suckers,

[21:36] who will buy games from you before they even see it,

[21:41] before they even play it, you can sell someone

[21:45] a $9,000 product.

[21:47] As long as that's going on, there's no way my friend,

[21:51] you're going to retire, all right?

[21:54] All right.

[21:55] So the story just goes on to talk about how they got the license

[21:58] and at the end, this is the final quote from Gary.

[22:03] He says, this is special.

[22:06] It's definitely a collectible.

[22:09] I mean, it's the Beatles.

[22:11] Are you kidding?

[22:13] Question Mark?

[22:15] Stern said, all right.

[22:16] So Stern is banking on it.

[22:18] He's banking on it.

[22:19] So look, I don't think this is like an instant

[22:25] collectible per se.

[22:28] I think the market for this game is untested.

[22:32] I think we're gonna see what that market is.

[22:35] I think they're gonna sell well though.

[22:37] I really do.

[22:38] I don't think this game is going to have as many issues

[22:42] as people think because I think the one thing people

[22:46] are underestimating is the desire that people have

[22:50] to put a game in their home that's a little bit easier.

[22:54] I literally, I get that you enthusiasts don't like this

[22:58] and I get why you're mad and I get why some of you think

[23:01] that this was a colossal mistake to take one

[23:04] of the biggest properties of all time and not give it,

[23:09] all of the innovation and capabilities you could give it

[23:14] instead you re-skinned something from yesterday's

[23:17] and then you put it in a modern cabinet

[23:19] which is making people kind of, it's kind of like,

[23:23] wait, what's going on?

[23:24] Like why is Stern saying this is a throwback

[23:27] to what a game would look like in the 1960s

[23:30] if the Beatles had received a Pimball machine,

[23:33] then why are they putting it inside a 2018 cabinet

[23:36] and that's a very good question

[23:38] and I don't have an answer to that question

[23:39] and it kind of does go against going all in

[23:43] on making it more throwback and I don't know why

[23:47] other than the answer that we all know is the answer.

[23:52] It's cheaper to do it that way.

[23:54] Are you finally waking up to the fact that Stern knows

[23:57] how to make a profit and knows how to use the parts

[24:00] inside the factory as many times as they can

[24:03] and that's how they stay in business.

[24:05] Hello people, wake up, that's how companies

[24:09] like this stay in business.

[24:12] All right, all right, so that's the Beatles Pimball.

[24:18] I'm sure more of your butts will be hurt

[24:20] as the weekend goes on.

[24:22] Let me read some of my user emails that I receive

[24:27] from you guys, thank you so much

[24:29] and I think I got another voice email too.

[24:32] Let me just put this one in.

[24:34] This is from our friend of the show.

[24:37] Let's see, hold on everybody.

[24:40] This is from our friend Matthew again.

[24:43] It has a audio, Matthew S.

[24:46] Thank you Matthew, let's air it right now.

[24:49] Hey, can I just listen to 277 on my drive home.

[24:52] Sitting in my car, I'm just gonna give you

[24:53] a couple quick thoughts.

[24:54] I don't wanna do this inside

[24:55] because my wife's gonna think I'm insane

[24:57] talking to a phone about a podcast

[24:59] about pinball commentary.

[25:01] Although she has listened to a couple of your episodes

[25:03] and she thinks it's pretty funny,

[25:04] but she also doesn't get why everyone's so worked up

[25:06] about the smallest of things.

[25:08] The Beatles pinball release was absolutely

[25:11] one of the craziest things I've ever seen on Pinside.

[25:14] The absolute insanity about this machine

[25:17] that it wasn't what people wanted,

[25:20] just an insane number of posts.

[25:24] I thought it was fine.

[25:25] I mean, I'll judge when I play it.

[25:26] I'm not gonna buy it anyway,

[25:27] but I just want a good pinball machine to play.

[25:30] People lost their minds.

[25:31] That thread about how bad is the Beatles selling.

[25:36] People are taking this such perverse joy

[25:38] in any perceived failings of this industry

[25:41] by the people who claim to love it the most

[25:44] is I don't even know what to tell you about it,

[25:47] how to describe it in some sort of rational terms.

[25:49] I work at a comic book website, I do editing.

[25:53] I'm in a niche culture about the strangest things

[25:56] about collectibles and everyone has this little

[25:58] clicky attitude and they try to tear down different things

[26:03] for different reasons, but pinball absolute

[26:06] completely different story.

[26:08] The people don't understand, you're trying to hit on it,

[26:11] but people don't get what the Beatles is.

[26:13] More importantly, they don't understand

[26:15] the impact the Beatles will have on Stern.

[26:18] They treat this like it's the 2017 Farmers Almanac

[26:21] that once the year turns, this thing's dead in the water.

[26:24] It's gonna be dumped by the tub into the recycle bins.

[26:27] Stern can have the Beatles for sale at retail for five years.

[26:30] You know what's gonna be?

[26:31] It's gonna be showing up in places that pinball

[26:35] people don't think about.

[26:36] It's gonna be in the music magazine.

[26:37] It's gonna be in the Beatles collector's books.

[26:40] It's gonna be in the Sky Mall magazine

[26:42] where some business guy who doesn't give a rat's ass

[26:45] about pinballs gonna be flipping through

[26:46] and he's gonna say, huh, the Beatles pinball by Stern.

[26:50] Geez, that looks kind of cool.

[26:52] Yeah, you know what?

[26:53] I have a friend, I'm gonna buy him that instead of buying

[26:55] him a $5,000 bottle of wine for Christmas.

[26:59] What a great surprise this is gonna be.

[27:01] He doesn't care if it came out three months ago or a year ago.

[27:04] That's still gonna get him constant publicity,

[27:07] something they can put in the catalogs,

[27:08] the trade magazines, month after month.

[27:11] As long as it's available, it's gonna be getting Stern press.

[27:14] I don't know, people, I don't know.

[27:15] These things are evergreen, man.

[27:17] You can sell them forever in a day as long as they're new.

[27:19] I mean, they're not making WWE crap, you know,

[27:22] with wrestlers who aren't on the bill anymore

[27:24] or stupid layouts.

[27:26] This is just a quality machine that's gonna be simple.

[27:29] That guy who's sitting in first class,

[27:31] who paid, you know, three grand for his airline ticket overseas

[27:34] out of business trip and he's looking at that.

[27:36] He's gonna be like, oh, seven grand, that's awesome.

[27:39] Pinball, I didn't even know they still made him.

[27:41] That's who they're targeting.

[27:42] They don't give an ass about who's on pinside,

[27:45] complaining about this or that.

[27:46] Speaking of pinside, I love your commentary

[27:48] because you detached from it.

[27:50] Yeah, you've been banned.

[27:51] But let me tell ya, I go on, I read, I try to be upbeat.

[27:54] You know, I post in the positive threads,

[27:56] the pinball projects group, you know,

[27:58] trying to find people, project machines and stuff.

[28:01] But the culture of pinside is completely,

[28:04] I don't know how else to describe it,

[28:06] except for a den of thieves.

[28:07] Not saying these people are criminals,

[28:08] but I'm saying they have their own code of honor.

[28:11] I've seen people who post about, oh, I called this guy,

[28:14] he put this old guy posted on Craigslist

[28:18] with a scared stiff machine that he's had in his basement

[28:21] since his kids were born.

[28:22] And they put 10 plays on it and he put it up for $200,

[28:25] but you had to take it out and I called him and he said,

[28:28] great, you know, you can have it.

[28:29] And then he called back and said,

[28:31] I'm sorry, someone called and said this thing's worth,

[28:33] you know, three, four grand.

[28:34] And I can't sell it for pennies on the dollar

[28:38] and they lose their minds.

[28:39] You honor the agreement, you honor this, you honor that.

[28:43] And then you have guys who buy a machine on pinside

[28:46] and they're like, they buy the machine the same day,

[28:49] they listed back on pinside for hundreds of dollars

[28:51] more than they paid for it.

[28:52] And it's just this bizarre cut throat,

[28:55] you know, we're gonna one up each other.

[28:58] The threads, I mean, I don't even know why they bother

[29:00] having those little on fire threads

[29:02] because every thread's on fire.

[29:04] Hundreds of posts regurg, regurgitating the same nonsense

[29:08] over and over, it's depressing, man.

[29:10] You know, I wanna go on, I wanna talk pinball

[29:12] with people who love pinball.

[29:14] I don't wanna see these freaking flame wars.

[29:16] I mean, listen, dude, I own a water world.

[29:18] I'm gonna be honest with you.

[29:19] My whole collection was paid for

[29:21] by buying EMs of repairing them and selling them.

[29:24] And I've made enough that I bought, you know,

[29:25] five or six machines for my basement.

[29:27] So when I have people come over,

[29:28] we have something to play and people send, I love it.

[29:31] But, you know, I do the lower class games.

[29:34] Waterworld, I happen to like it.

[29:36] You know, I enjoy the different story threads.

[29:38] I have customized the rules a little bit.

[29:40] So it's a little more challenging to get multi-ball.

[29:43] I enjoy it.

[29:44] People come into the water world club thread.

[29:46] Oh, you know, this game sucks.

[29:48] They get rules stink, the code stinks,

[29:50] the shot stinks, the graphics stinks, the movies.

[29:52] The movie's all right, which shows, you know,

[29:54] judge a character right there.

[29:56] But they think they can do anything.

[29:58] There's these clicks.

[29:59] If you see a new thread, if I posted something

[30:01] saying, you know, new theme announced, this or that,

[30:03] you're gonna see the same 15, 20 people posting over

[30:07] and over and over, commenting on each other's threads.

[30:09] Making themselves think they, you know, we make it damn.

[30:12] We're important.

[30:13] It's just a big old circle jerk sometimes.

[30:16] And there are good people on there.

[30:17] We just stay away from the threads that, you know,

[30:19] they just go nowhere.

[30:21] Everything's a negative at this point.

[30:22] You could expect anything to be posted.

[30:25] Sturnt could come out with a machine.

[30:27] I don't know.

[30:28] They could do the, you know, we already did the Avengers.

[30:30] They already did X-Men.

[30:31] I don't, I don't read many Marvel comics anymore.

[30:33] But they could come out with a brand new superhero title.

[30:36] They could sell for three grand,

[30:37] with 10 grand worth of stuff in it.

[30:39] You know, you can lean up against it,

[30:40] it'll vibrate your crotch, it'll pleasure you.

[30:42] It'll give you dollar bills when you need money.

[30:44] There are people who would still bitch in moan

[30:46] about some perceived slight that.

[30:48] It didn't appeal to them and they'll get to take

[30:49] so much offense at it.

[30:51] I don't know, man.

[30:52] You know, I trained so many threads on pin-side that it,

[30:59] it really is getting a little ridiculous

[31:01] why I even go sometimes.

[31:02] But, you know, I enjoy some of the certain,

[31:04] particular threads so I still go.

[31:05] And I have met some decent people through it.

[31:08] You know, the last thing I know this is long

[31:09] so you can edit it or just throw it all away.

[31:11] I don't really care.

[31:12] I just wanted to share my thoughts with you.

[31:14] It was traveling.

[31:15] You say you don't play pinball when you travel.

[31:17] That's the first thing I do.

[31:19] You know, we travel out to see family somewhere.

[31:21] I look up a pinball parlor.

[31:22] We go out, just me and the wife,

[31:24] you know, we leave kids with relatives or something.

[31:26] Go out, find these pinball parlores,

[31:29] hang out with people, have a good time,

[31:30] have some drinks.

[31:32] You know, ask the locals where the next place to go

[31:35] is it's a great introduction

[31:36] if you don't know anyone in the area

[31:38] or you know, something fun to like that.

[31:40] I always enjoy looking out of the whole place,

[31:42] out of the way places for those pinball machines

[31:45] and the people who play them.

[31:46] Most people who play pinball are awesome.

[31:48] I love meeting them in leagues and stuff.

[31:49] You know, as long as they don't go on pinside

[31:51] and lose their eff in minds every little thing.

[31:55] Another great episode, bud, enjoying it, take it easy.

[31:58] Wow, that Matthew, that wasn't just some feedback.

[32:01] That was like a podcast in itself.

[32:05] Thank you for all of that.

[32:07] Where to begin?

[32:08] First of all, I do kind of like the Waterworld movie.

[32:11] There's something about that movie

[32:12] that is just enjoyable in all of its campy badness

[32:16] at the same time.

[32:17] I want it to do something in my marketing career ones

[32:21] where I want it to convince Kevin Costner

[32:24] to do a sequel to Waterworld.

[32:27] And I was gonna get a brand to offer to pay him

[32:30] in a million dollars of dirt, right?

[32:34] And they didn't get it.

[32:35] They didn't get why we would pay him in dirt.

[32:38] Anyway, look, I agree with you about Beatles

[32:40] not having to just like sell out immediately.

[32:43] I totally agree that there is this huge world out there

[32:47] of potential buyers for a machine like this

[32:50] that the pinside people just don't understand

[32:54] and don't get.

[32:55] They think that if CoinTaker, Game Exchange

[32:59] and Trent are not selling this thing,

[33:03] then it's not gonna sell at all.

[33:06] And I think Iceman's post was the perfect example

[33:10] of the pinside hyperuser who simply thinks

[33:15] that because his feelings are all that matter

[33:20] in terms of a pin success, right?

[33:22] Like if Iceman's not gonna buy it,

[33:23] then no one's gonna buy it.

[33:24] If Iceman's distributor's calling me up,

[33:26] then the game sales are gonna be terrible.

[33:28] And I think you're right, this machine

[33:31] will be going after a little bit of a different target.

[33:34] But also look, it's also gonna be a little bit challenging

[33:37] because as we've seen before,

[33:39] I also don't think Pinball Machine is something

[33:43] that someone is just gonna see in a magazine

[33:46] and then go buy.

[33:47] I think there's gonna have to be a little bit of like,

[33:51] Stern guessed a little bit and got it right,

[33:54] that there's an expandable buyer base here.

[33:57] And I also think there's gonna have to be a little bit

[34:00] of like flexibility from the diehard pinball people

[34:03] on pinside and the pinball enthusiast

[34:05] and just give Stern a break for making something

[34:08] a little bit different this time.

[34:10] Don't they deserve to make a little bit of variety?

[34:13] And that's the thing that kills me.

[34:16] If Stern went away tomorrow,

[34:18] all of these people would be crying and complaining

[34:22] and begging them to come back.

[34:25] And we know that would be the case.

[34:27] All right, well Matthew, thank you so much for giving me

[34:30] an audio bit of feedback for you guys out there.

[34:33] I mean, that's fun.

[34:34] You guys should consider doing that more often.

[34:36] Now keep it within a certain limit, all right?

[34:39] I can't air everyone's like 10 minute grievances with me,

[34:42] but I will do my best to get you guys out there in the world.

[34:47] All right, I got an email from, let's see.

[34:50] All right, here we go.

[34:52] Do do do monster bash from Harry Reemer.

[34:56] Chris, I played monster bash extensively at Expo

[35:00] and Zach and Greg are 100% right.

[35:04] The game is stunning.

[35:05] The RGB light show is gorgeous.

[35:08] The animations are incredible.

[35:10] The details on the sculpts are so much better

[35:13] than the original anyone who was on the fence

[35:16] about buying monster bash was pushed off after playing it.

[35:21] I am starting to believe monster bash early is sold out.

[35:25] Such a work of art, Harry.

[35:28] Well, Harry, thank you.

[35:29] And Harry played it.

[35:31] Harry stood over it.

[35:32] And I think that's the key here too,

[35:34] is everyone I know who was at Expo is gushing about this game.

[35:41] So I do think they're going to possibly sell out.

[35:44] I got an email from Mark Felt, the score, it says,

[35:49] you are banned by all the pinball manufacturers.

[35:53] Consider it a badge of honor.

[35:55] By the way, they all listen to you.

[35:59] So be the Howard Cerniv pinball and embrace the fact

[36:02] that you are the only voice of honesty out there

[36:05] that happens to be immensely entertaining

[36:08] with a ton of fans and followers.

[36:10] Beatles filled my diaper was hysterical.

[36:14] You are just the one that says out loud

[36:16] what the pinball community is thinking.

[36:19] Cern is just listening to Canada

[36:21] and will be testing the upper price limits on Beatles

[36:24] with zero downside.

[36:26] And all 1964 will sell out.

[36:31] They talk to their distributors worldwide,

[36:33] engage interest level before they announce things

[36:36] to the public.

[36:37] Note, sell out does not mean that all customers will have bought

[36:42] them.

[36:43] It does mean that all distributors have bought them.

[36:47] You ever think how a distributor might just

[36:50] want to put away a new inbox diamond Beatles

[36:52] for a few years?

[36:54] Spooky will just keep grinding along

[36:56] because their overhead structure is low,

[36:58] and they don't have to make many games.

[37:01] They are still a proven option for the home

[37:04] brew pinball designers that consider selling 200 a success.

[37:09] Chicago gaming company is just doing a cash grab.

[37:13] Look at their website.

[37:15] They make a ton of coin operated equipment.

[37:17] If they never remake another pinball after Monster Bash,

[37:21] they will be in business forever.

[37:23] But they will milk it as long as they can.

[37:26] Smart veteran coin op guys.

[37:28] AP is a supplier to the industry.

[37:32] If October Fest is a disaster, they

[37:35] will just continue to be supplying to other companies.

[37:38] Some financial exposure, but not enough to take them down.

[37:42] Jersey Jack is fucked, not an if, but when, as to bankruptcy.

[37:49] Remember, billionaire investor can

[37:51] let J.J.P. go bankrupt and walk away with whatever

[37:56] losses leaving millions in debt.

[37:58] The people that really got screwed are the suppliers.

[38:02] No supplier should be extending credit terms

[38:05] to J.J.P. at this point.

[38:07] And good luck getting parts and support.

[38:10] Well, Mark, thank you.

[38:11] You kind of covered it all.

[38:13] Look, I'm glad you like the show.

[38:16] I do think that the pinball manufacturers

[38:18] listen to the show just probably to be entertained if anything.

[38:23] And I also think we do say stuff that taps into.

[38:26] I think is a little bit more about what people are thinking,

[38:29] but don't always want to say.

[38:32] I do think that the Beatles will be fine.

[38:36] Again, I don't think it has to be like an overnight success

[38:39] to be successful.

[38:41] I don't think Chicago gaming company is doing a cash grab.

[38:44] I'll tell you why.

[38:45] If they were just trying to cash grab remake,

[38:48] they simply would just remake the game from 20 years ago.

[38:51] They wouldn't go through all the trouble to redo the dots.

[38:54] They wouldn't go through the trouble to redo the scopes.

[38:57] They simply would just make a new monster bash

[39:00] and charge you $5, $6,000 for it and sell a ton of them.

[39:04] Instead, I think they really care

[39:07] to create a legacy around these remakes

[39:11] and making them better than the originals.

[39:13] And if American pinball wants to just be in business

[39:15] to supply boards to the rest of the industry

[39:18] and make games like October Fest, that's great.

[39:21] But again, I don't think they're going to create

[39:23] much of a legacy and sell many games.

[39:25] And I don't think there's any room

[39:27] for mediocre games anymore.

[39:29] I just don't.

[39:30] All right, I got an email from Jeff Patterson.

[39:33] As you know, Jeff is the wonderful man

[39:37] who provides us with this week in Pimble,

[39:39] which without Jeff's site,

[39:41] more and more of us would be forced to go on Pinside

[39:45] and find our news out there.

[39:48] Again, I think Jeff has done the greatest service

[39:51] to the hobby because he allows us to get our news

[39:55] without having crazy levy and ice man punching us

[39:59] in the face as we're trying to find the news.

[40:02] And I think that's great.

[40:03] So Jeff says, dude, you are exactly the obsessed pinball

[40:07] person you describe on the podcast.

[40:09] It's an addictive hobby.

[40:10] Don't beat yourself up about that.

[40:12] New font is coming on this week in Pimble,

[40:15] a website face that is coming before the end of the year.

[40:18] Hope all as well.

[40:19] Well, Jeff, look, obsessed a little bit obsessed.

[40:23] I, here's a difference.

[40:25] Is my obsession with Pimble is a little bit different

[40:27] than I think the people on the forum.

[40:29] I'm not obsessed.

[40:30] Obsessed is really extreme.

[40:31] I do not think about Pimble every single day.

[40:34] I do not think about Pimble when I'm at work all day long.

[40:38] There are some days I do, but I don't do it all day long.

[40:42] I'm not, and I'm also not like spending

[40:45] an inordinate amount of my money on Pimble.

[40:49] I'm not traveling to shows.

[40:50] If I was obsessed with Pimble,

[40:52] because obsession has like sort of like a connection

[40:55] to addiction, I would have gone to Expo.

[40:57] I would have gone to like Pittsburgh.

[41:01] I would have gone to like the show up in Boston.

[41:03] I am not obsessed.

[41:05] I'll tell you why I'm not obsessed too.

[41:07] There are so many bars within a 20 minute walking distance

[41:10] from me and places to play Pimble, and I don't go.

[41:14] All right, I don't go.

[41:15] I'd rather sit home and watch, you know,

[41:19] amid summer murders on Netflix,

[41:21] then walk to modern Pimble and play Deadpool.

[41:25] All right, that's just me.

[41:26] I like Netflix.

[41:27] I like that show.

[41:28] It's Campy or Catham Kim.

[41:29] Look at me, look at me, look at me.

[41:31] I would rather watch those shows, all right?

[41:34] But we look forward to the new site coming, Jeff.

[41:36] I got an email from Rick Osborne.

[41:38] Hey, Chris, just smoking a bowl and then heading back out

[41:41] to my bar to play NASCAR Pimble.

[41:44] Man, got that last week in a trade for my Terminator 2.

[41:48] There's the Star Wars hyperspace looping shot implemented

[41:53] years earlier with way cooler world-interglace implementation,

[41:57] plus the great ramps, diverters, and bash toy,

[42:00] much more value than a current Stern offering.

[42:05] Anyways, always a treat when you have a new podcast.

[42:08] I'm one of the listeners who does enjoy you calling out

[42:11] Pinsiders as warranted, Rick, who goes by POMC on Pinside.

[42:17] Well, Rick, thank you.

[42:19] I won't reveal to the authorities about your smoking.

[42:23] I'm glad that you were enjoying NASCAR.

[42:26] And yes, I think a lot of the older games

[42:29] have way more in them.

[42:31] And some of the mechs that were even applauding now

[42:34] as being innovative are really things

[42:36] that were done 20 years ago.

[42:38] And look, all that matters is your playing Pimble

[42:39] and you're having fun.

[42:40] All right?

[42:41] All right, thank you, Rick.

[42:42] I'm probably going to read that longer email I got

[42:45] on another day.

[42:46] I don't want this podcast to be too long.

[42:49] I actually got, I want to read this one.

[42:50] This is from Kimmy Chatfield.

[42:54] And she writes, Hi, Chris.

[42:56] Totally agree with your podcast.

[42:58] We cannot let a few people dictate what

[43:01] is offensive or not offensive.

[43:04] The makers of October Fest decided on the artwork

[43:08] they would like on the back glass.

[43:10] And we should allow artistic creativity.

[43:14] Coming from a woman's standpoint,

[43:17] and a woman that was sexually assaulted,

[43:20] I see nothing in that monkey or his ass touching, which

[43:24] triggers memories of sexual assault.

[43:28] The monkey is an animal.

[43:29] And I have had many animals, such as dogs and cats,

[43:33] smell my privates and hump my leg.

[43:36] Never did I associate the actions of these animals

[43:38] as sexual assault.

[43:40] We should never suppress artistic creativity.

[43:43] I'm a huge fan of Leonardo da Vinci and many Renaissance

[43:47] artists.

[43:48] They had the freedom to create new portraits

[43:51] and sculptures, some in erotic positions.

[43:54] Just imagine the treasures that would not have been created

[43:58] if these artists bow down to a few people who were offended.

[44:03] If you are offended by art, nudity, or erotic scenes,

[44:07] you have the right not to look at the so-called offensive

[44:11] art or not play games with offensive art.

[44:14] But no one has the right to deny others just because you

[44:19] are offended.

[44:20] Sincerely, Kimmy, 50-year-old Asian woman.

[44:24] Kimmy, thank you.

[44:27] I think you put it so eloquently what I was trying to say

[44:33] is that the freedom and people's rights

[44:37] to play a game or not, to put the artistic creativity they

[44:41] want or not on a pinball machine needs to be defended

[44:45] above all cost.

[44:47] And I will extend, Kimmy, if you would like to come on the show

[44:50] and talk about this a little bit more,

[44:52] I would love to have you on.

[44:53] I always want to have a more diverse audience talk about pinball.

[44:58] And the fact that you are not the stereotypical pinball player,

[45:04] I would love to talk to you about how you got into the hobby

[45:07] and what your thoughts are.

[45:08] Because I think we hear so much of it from just one side.

[45:10] So Kimmy, thank you for that note.

[45:13] And I couldn't agree more with how you put it.

[45:17] I got an email from, let's see, from my cake company.

[45:21] I'm trying to make a record Ralph cake for my wedding.

[45:24] You guys want to talk about the price of toppers

[45:27] to make a custom record Ralph cake that looks like the building

[45:30] in record Ralph.

[45:32] They want me to pay $1,600.

[45:34] I don't know.

[45:35] I don't know if that's worth it.

[45:36] What do you think?

[45:37] Email me at canadapinballadgmail.com.

[45:40] The Beatles, I got an email that says, don't use my info

[45:44] on the air.

[45:45] And it says, hi, Chris.

[45:47] Love the show, as always.

[45:50] I've heard from two distributors that I trust

[45:53] that Stern 40 packs have sold out already.

[45:56] You were right on the money.

[45:58] And this is about Beatles.

[46:00] So is it selling well?

[46:02] Is it not?

[46:03] I hope so.

[46:05] I hope they stay in business.

[46:08] Maybe you'll read a little bit of the email I was going

[46:10] to read to you guys.

[46:11] All right?

[46:13] Oh, I don't feel like doing it.

[46:15] I'll tell you why.

[46:16] Because I got a feedback, and there's a lot here.

[46:18] This is going to be its own show.

[46:20] It's going to be its own show.

[46:21] I've lied to you, people.

[46:23] I didn't deliver everything I was supposed to deliver

[46:26] on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[46:28] Don't crucify me.

[46:30] I am happy to get you something at least to chew on over

[46:34] the weekend.

[46:35] Anything else that I've missed that's been going on

[46:37] on the hobby?

[46:38] Oh, yeah.

[46:38] Here's a little thing to chew on.

[46:40] With everyone complaining about sexual harassment

[46:44] and monkeys grabbing ass, did you

[46:46] know that there is a song on Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[46:51] Castle that the lyrics are all about Alice Cooper having

[46:56] sex with a dead woman?

[46:58] All right.

[46:59] So that's on there.

[46:59] Is that offensive?

[47:01] If you listen to the lyrics of that song,

[47:04] I want to give Ryan C. it head to head pinball credit

[47:07] for pointing that out.

[47:08] Because unlike Ryan, I don't listen to Alice Cooper's songs.

[47:13] And I don't dive too deep into anything that he sings.

[47:19] So that's all Ryan from head to head pinball.

[47:22] So we want to give him credit for that.

[47:23] But I'm not offended by that.

[47:25] I'm just offended by Alice Cooper music in general,

[47:28] because I think it sucks.

[47:30] I mean, that's just me.

[47:31] You might like it.

[47:32] I just don't think it's that good.

[47:34] I mean, I like that genre.

[47:36] Look, I think that Rob Zombie music is so much better

[47:39] than Alice Cooper music.

[47:41] I drive all the time to Rob Zombie music playing.

[47:43] It kicks ass.

[47:45] I think Alice Cooper, I don't know, just between us,

[47:48] is kind of fucking corny.

[47:50] I feel like he has to do all that shtick

[47:52] because he's not really good musically.

[47:54] You know the other band that I think

[47:56] is like that a little bit?

[47:57] I'm going to be honest.

[47:58] Kiss.

[47:59] I feel like the bands that have to put on such of a costume

[48:05] in an act are doing it because I don't know.

[48:07] I don't think the music's the best.

[48:10] Anyway, what else is going on?

[48:11] Did you see the Magic Girl for sale for $14,000?

[48:17] I think this is Scott's game, my friend Scott over there

[48:20] in Seattle, the guy who actually helped me get mine working

[48:22] because his code was unlocked.

[48:24] But he's trying to sell the Zidware Magic Girl

[48:26] for $14,000.

[48:28] And I think that just goes to show how far that game

[48:31] has fallen.

[48:33] That's $9,000 less than I paid for it.

[48:35] I actually lucked out by being able to get rid of mine

[48:37] for $20,000.

[48:38] I think I dodged a bullet.

[48:41] And you know, Mike, not Mike, Wayne over in Australia

[48:45] is still trying to sell his for $25,000.

[48:47] I love it.

[48:48] I love Wayne's Guide is listed for $11,000 more.

[48:52] I think everyone realizes now that

[48:54] how do you even price a Magic Girl?

[48:56] Like how do you even concert worth anything?

[49:00] Here's the thing I'll say though.

[49:02] If Deeproot Pimball did not develop,

[49:05] if John Papaduke never found a new home,

[49:08] and those were the only like 18 or 20 machines

[49:11] out there in the world, I think those games would have

[49:14] held their value in their broken state easily.

[49:17] Easily.

[49:19] One of the most beautiful sexy Pimball machines of all time

[49:22] doesn't really work, but there's a story behind it.

[49:24] It would easily have been a conversation starter.

[49:26] But if Deeproot Pimball makes a working Magic Girl,

[49:30] you know, who wants it?

[49:32] But here's the thing.

[49:34] If they make a working Magic Girl,

[49:35] and they don't use any Zombie, these artworks,

[49:37] and it's like, it's like Magic Girl next store.

[49:39] And it's not really the Magic Girl you thought,

[49:41] or you want it.

[49:43] I don't know.

[49:44] Maybe those games do have a little bit of a novelty value.

[49:47] But as someone who owned Magic Girl, I can tell you,

[49:51] you better have 10 other working Pimball machines

[49:53] next to it because it's no fun to flip.

[49:56] It's just fun to look at, right?

[50:00] It's kind of like having sex with someone

[50:02] with your clothes, all your clothes still on.

[50:04] That's what it feels like playing Magic Girl.

[50:05] Everyone, have a great weekend.

[50:08] I have to feed Baba.

[50:09] Thank you all of you who listen to this show

[50:13] and write in and give me your feedback.

[50:15] As you see, I will read your commentary to the world.

[50:19] I do think that we all should be a little bit more positive

[50:22] at times.

[50:23] And again, I think we need to give

[50:24] starting a little bit of credit.

[50:26] I think that the lashings they take

[50:28] by some of those people on Pinside is uncalled for.

[50:32] And I don't need to know much more than the fact

[50:36] that a lot of those men who hyperpost,

[50:39] they're just like really angry, sad, lonely people right now.

[50:46] You have to be angry in life to get super, super angry

[50:50] about a Pimball machine that you're not even going to buy.

[50:54] And I don't know.

[50:55] You know what I'm saying?

[50:56] Why are people so upset?

[50:59] Down in their basements, not hanging out with their kids,

[51:02] not hanging out with their wives.

[51:03] They're down in the basement, typing away,

[51:06] like fighting each other.

[51:08] Like it's so stupid, it's fucking stupid.

[51:11] Anyway, have a good week and everybody.

[51:14] Don't be lonely.

[51:15] Don't spend too much time on Pinside.

[51:17] And like I said, go to the gym for every day

[51:20] you want to go on Pinside.

[51:22] You should have to earn your Pinside hours

[51:25] with pushups and pullups.

[51:27] Trust me.

[51:28] You'll thank me for it.

[51:30] All right, I want the machine you're connected to

[51:33] to be a Pimball machine and not a machine in the hospital.

[51:36] All right, don't have like a massive heart attack at 60

[51:39] because you traveled the world and ate fatty food

[51:41] and did nothing but played Pimball

[51:43] every time you woke up in the morning.

[51:45] Health before Pimball wealth.

[51:48] And you'll have a happy life people.

[51:50] Have a good weekend.
