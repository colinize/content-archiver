[00:00] All right, we are live here. Hopefully the service is good.

[00:08] Ah, such a beautiful, beautiful weekend.

[00:14] Let's get this people some links.

[00:19] Talk some pinball for a little bit today.

[00:24] Go over what's happening in the hobby this week.

[00:28] It's been it's been a ventful.

[00:31] I mean, it's been more ventful than some previous weeks.

[00:34] So we got some new games to talk about.

[00:36] We've got some updates on existing games.

[00:40] Lots of code dropping.

[00:43] Lots of code.

[00:45] Lord Olaf, for you guys in Europe, this is a great time to join.

[00:50] Ah, just so nice out.

[00:53] It's perfect weather.

[00:55] You know, I took off next week and it's going to rain.

[00:58] It's literally going to rain all next week here.

[01:01] I just wanted to like, I just wanted to go into the sunshine.

[01:05] I wanted to put my feet in the sand.

[01:08] And I, I, there's nothing worse than planning a vacation.

[01:12] It's a staycation.

[01:14] And the weather's not good.

[01:17] It's been a very rainy summer.

[01:19] What's up, retro Django?

[01:22] We got a lot of things in the house.

[01:25] Denmark.

[01:26] We got Fred.

[01:27] We got Joe.

[01:28] Thank you for guys for the, uh, for following me into Sunday.

[01:32] Just couldn't do the show yesterday.

[01:34] Just too much going on.

[01:35] Brennan wasn't feeling great.

[01:37] So we did a little audible.

[01:40] And it works.

[01:41] We got everybody here.

[01:42] We got what we'll get a good audience.

[01:44] You know, I will say I have to say as much as I like doing it like this.

[01:50] And now sends it to so many more people.

[01:52] Like any Facebook live for some reason now.

[01:54] I get like 4,000, 5,000 views.

[01:57] So as a, a vehicle to drive people to sign up.

[02:02] I don't, you know, it's like, I'm, I'm not gaining subscribers anymore.

[02:06] I'm like, losing subscribers.

[02:08] For the first, I'm down to like 650 like it's, I don't know what else to do.

[02:13] Really, I don't.

[02:14] I think there's just like diminishing returns.

[02:16] I think people are fatigued.

[02:18] I think there's just so much content.

[02:20] Now look, I'm really happy with every one of my subscribers.

[02:22] And I'm going to keep doing the show.

[02:24] But I think everybody's sort of peaked and plateaued.

[02:28] Jenga's can attest to this.

[02:29] No one's growing in the content space.

[02:31] Nobody like we're all just sort of like.

[02:34] Treading right now.

[02:36] Like trying to stay flat.

[02:38] But I think overall.

[02:40] There's just an oversaturation of everything in Pimble.

[02:43] There's an oversaturation of games.

[02:46] Content.

[02:47] Oversaturation of even conversation.

[02:49] I, I do think people are like burnt a little bit.

[02:51] They're just burnt.

[02:52] But every week, I think way the people stay, you know, a lot of people stay on

[02:58] Canadian Spinball podcast on Patreon.

[03:00] Three shows.

[03:01] It's a lot of fun.

[03:02] The chat's amazing.

[03:04] Brenda's doing better today.

[03:06] Thank you for asking.

[03:08] And let's get this shared on the Patreon.

[03:12] It's for the July week.

[03:14] And I don't expect too many people to be hanging out here.

[03:16] You probably shouldn't be hanging out here anyway.

[03:19] But you know, it's earlier too.

[03:22] So I changed the time.

[03:25] We're going to give everybody a few minutes to come in.

[03:27] Then we're going to go.

[03:28] And we're going to talk about what's going on in Pimble.

[03:32] And I think there's.

[03:35] I think there's like.

[03:38] The big news is jaws.

[03:40] Big news is people waiting for Potter.

[03:43] A lot of code updates on the stern front.

[03:46] People are giving a lot of good feedback on those code updates.

[03:50] But for the most part, you know, it's summer.

[03:54] It's July.

[03:55] It's like 4th of July.

[03:57] Barbecues, beers inside playing Pimble.

[04:00] Like I had some friends come over.

[04:02] And they.

[04:03] They came upstairs.

[04:04] They saw the guns and roses.

[04:06] And within like 30 seconds, we're like, dude,

[04:08] let's just go outside and have some beers.

[04:10] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[04:11] Like, I think sometimes we.

[04:15] We overestimate.

[04:18] People's desires when they see a Pimble machine to play an own one.

[04:22] It's not as.

[04:24] It's not as much as we think.

[04:26] And that's why like, even though there's a lot of money and there's a lot of potential buyers of these machines.

[04:33] It's hard to get people to really like click with Pimble.

[04:39] It takes a while.

[04:40] And I was thinking to you like a lot of these modern games are very complex.

[04:43] They're really not good gateway drugs to getting into Pimble.

[04:48] You would just be so confused walking up to most of these machines.

[04:52] And you know, they they they don't have the same level of like.

[04:58] Physical wow that the old Valley Williams games had.

[05:01] They don't they definitely don't let players like see really cool things happening with the ball.

[05:07] It's all software now.

[05:08] It's all software and lights for the most part.

[05:11] That's what this hobby's turned into.

[05:13] The community continues to justify that as being loaded impact games.

[05:18] I mean, I find it funny.

[05:20] If you like literally if you walked up to a Harry Potter Pimble machine.

[05:25] You and you were not like one of us.

[05:27] You would have no idea like really what you're doing.

[05:30] You would have no idea where to look with it like it just no it's just.

[05:35] It's gotten crazy.

[05:37] I think it's way too much 96 modes.

[05:43] Just think about that for a minute.

[05:45] 35 guns and roses patches.

[05:48] Who thought that was a good idea?

[05:51] Did anyone think that was are there 30 are there 96 modes and.

[05:54] Monster Bash or.

[05:57] You know, theater of magic or.

[06:00] Medieval madness 96.

[06:05] Learning is the fun part.

[06:11] I don't I don't know man.

[06:14] I don't know I don't like I got I want to respond to that there's nothing fun about 35 patches and guns and roses in fact I kind of hated because I've had the game now for.

[06:23] Over a year.

[06:26] I don't want to memorize what 35 patches do I also don't want to stop.

[06:33] In the middle of every single game.

[06:36] And be like scrolling through 35 patches.

[06:41] If guns and roses had just like.

[06:44] Ten or less patches.

[06:46] And made those patches meaningful.

[06:49] It would be such a better.

[06:52] Implementation of patches.

[06:56] But the whole like and then then they get even stupider people like to like light and extra ball you got to collect these four patches and I still don't know which four exactly they are it's like the Vader patch.

[07:09] It's the fender patch it's the like it's so stupid.

[07:14] I just don't like it.

[07:17] I think it was and again it's just this is the same company that's now put 96 modes into Harry Potter.

[07:32] How's everybody doing again guys have a good 4th of July.

[07:37] You would hate my pinball jacket Chris it has like 20 patches on it.

[07:41] I always said this like it would have been really cool is another missed opportunity for Jersey Jack when guns and roses came out.

[07:49] And they had the patches.

[07:51] It just would have been really neat to also sell denim G and R pinball jackets with the patches from the game on it.

[08:01] And when you think about the fact that this company had guns and roses licensing permission to do whatever they wanted to do with G and R and they only released one crappy t shirt really.

[08:12] I mean just think about how sad that is like we all should be rocking are really cool G and R pinball jacket.

[08:20] And think about that for a minute you're rocking this unique limited.

[08:24] It doesn't have to be limited but this really cool guns and roses make it a black denim jacket with cool patches on it.

[08:31] When you wear it out and people ask where you got it you're like this is from a pinball company that made the most epic G and R pinball machine.

[08:40] It's just a great way to advertise and and get people you know excited but only people who only game can buy the jacket something like that you know.

[08:49] Dude Robert man Robert cancer free brother God bless man you know sometimes sometimes I think we all lose sight of everything and I mean it I felt this way more and more as I get older the.

[09:09] Standing at the crossroads of my past and my future and the present.

[09:15] And thinking about some friends I've lost along the way and this beautiful sunny day these beautiful children I have the I was with Cassie in this morning and Killian how precious life is how fast it goes.

[09:29] Like when I think about I mean in this hobby for 12 years now 13 years that that little baby is going to be 12 14 years a teenager how fast all this time went the time that's gone by with just all of us just hanging out talking about pinball.

[09:50] So just want to say you know I wish each and every one of you nothing but health and happiness in life and and may you may you spend more time outside and inside playing pinball I mean it.

[10:04] And when you travel the world don't seek out where the machines are seek out where an interesting restaurant is seek out where an interesting activity is that you can't play back home don't travel the world and be one of these people.

[10:19] That just looks down at the pinball machines that you see everywhere else just don't do that.

[10:26] Yeah F cancer you know I lost two and two of my aunt's I lost the cancer lost my sister and law and my mom is a cancer survivor so.

[10:40] My mom's story is crazy she just like woke up one day and just didn't feel right and she went to her doctor and they found stage one breast cancer and they they removed it and you know not gone wood she's been cancer free now I want to say like 15 years.

[11:02] But it's just like she just have like a feeling that something was wrong.

[11:08] You never know you know it's not you know what you never know what's going to get you when it's going to get you.

[11:14] Brenda is feeling better she is feeling better.

[11:18] She wasn't yeah she's nothing serious.

[11:22] She just tired and needed a break and.

[11:26] So it's good it's all good she does way too much you know it's interesting you know before I get into.

[11:34] It's interesting there's a shift happening in culture where.

[11:39] I think you know to have kids and be a working mom and all this stuff like it's grinding it's grinding down so many women out there.

[11:48] You know you get you get all that stuff you get the career you get the kids you get the house but you got to do it all like it's way too much you know it's coming back now like the trend it's just funny like finance bros are like popular again like you know I would what I mean by that is like being a finance bro and you know women are finding them attractive again because they understand now like maybe I don't want to like.

[12:14] Work my ass off while I'm also trying to raise a family which is a full time job maybe I don't want to spend $5,000 a month on daycare maybe it's okay that Timmy goes into the hedge fund every day and just lets me go to the country club after I drop the kids off it sounds a lot better than having you know stupid deadlines and homework every night.

[12:38] You can be productive and still not like grind away your life.

[12:43] I think what's happening to culture to is like.

[12:46] We there this promise of like linear success is over and when I mean by that is the promise.

[12:55] You just kept going in the same line or trajectory that your parents went in you would be just as successful and if you went to college and got a job and you you'd be a homeowner like all of that is like not panning out now.

[13:09] So now we're like kids are realizing I'm not going to be as successful the opportunities are not as plentiful and I'm not going to be able to afford a house.

[13:21] So they're looking for other I don't know other lifestyles really the corporate America promise.

[13:29] Yeah my daycare is like 6,000 a month people it's brutal it's brutal it's just what are you going to do then you daycare we can't do both.

[13:38] 6,000 a month so when you're like oh man.

[13:42] All right so let's talk about jaws 50 let's start the party there so curious how you all feel about the jaws 50th anniversary edition do you like it.

[13:57] Do you not like it do you think the values there.

[14:00] Do you think I saw some crazy story where some distro was telling a customer they're only going to make 300 of these like a loser distro said that like if a distro says that to you as a customer please out them so we can chastise them and like come on.

[14:19] So they're going to make 300 by Wednesday they're not going to make only 300 of these I absolutely hate it when distros only got one more and then they sell it then they call the next customer only got one left and they sell it and they call the next customer only got one left it's such a don't be a sleazy salesman.

[14:40] Code update was worth the wait it's amazing yeah no I've heard nothing but good stuff about the code update.

[14:47] Something about some shark call out that's not as plentiful as it used to be I don't know some shark ramp mode that's the only thing I've been seeing people complain about to me it looks blah the Ellie is much better.

[15:03] Okay I do think it'll look a little better in person and it is photographing the glitter looks cool but Ellie is fire.

[15:16] Yeah I'd be just annoyed though like if I loved my jaws Ellie knowing that there's just a nicer play field out there.

[15:24] I I really would be annoyed by that.

[15:31] You know it's like I'll give you bought the more expensive car but the cheaper version of the nicer interior you're like why.

[15:39] I kind of want one yeah I kind of also feel like.

[15:46] I'm just going to say this I feel like.

[15:51] You know me I talk about the market I talk about speculating I talk about what I would buy if I were you.

[15:59] I actually don't think buying a jaws 50th premium and keeping it in a box is a bad buy.

[16:10] Because if they're only going to make it for the next six months the probably you know we don't know how many they're going to make but there is a decent chance.

[16:19] And I mean this when I say there's a decent chance.

[16:23] When next year rolls around and all these newbies come into pinball jaws is jaws jaws is iconic you know they're going to want one and.

[16:32] This will be the one people want people want this one more than they'll want the regular premium the regular premium.

[16:39] Has the worst translate out of all them the regular premium doesn't yeah there's to me this game tanks the value of the older premium.

[16:52] If everyone who has an older premium.

[16:56] Just lost like a couple thousand dollars they did they might not want to admit it they might put it up on pin so.

[17:02] 8200 firm you're not going to get it anymore like this is going to be the premium everybody wants.

[17:11] You know stern was either going to screw over Ellie owners or premium owners so like I actually.

[17:17] I actually think this is well Keith here's the thing I think the thing is.

[17:23] Because they're not numbered stern is just going to make a ton and tuck them away.

[17:30] And you know because then and then dealers and distors will just always be allowed to order them whenever you know well into 2026.

[17:41] And stern will just say well these orders were placed in 2025 and we were just fulfilling orders because think about that like.

[17:47] What's the stop them for making this next year and they're just like we're these were just left over orders from last year that we're just fulfilling.

[17:56] The next pin the buy is beetle juice.

[17:59] So do you guys think it's going to be beetle juice or gremlins now some part of me kind of feels like gremlins might be first.

[18:09] And the reason I'm saying that is franche put the gremlins teaser on the boxes of evil dead.

[18:17] So I could see gremlins being a holiday movie more than beetle juice.

[18:24] I could see that being the case.

[18:27] Chris do you agree any sales at the end of the year was smart.

[18:33] Yeah I mean it's not stupid it doesn't hurt them to try to inject some fomo into the sales of the game so why not right I mean it look it was like their attempted fomo.

[18:44] So now look I never like a fomo that's not measurable you know what I mean because if you're going to try to make me feel fear of missing out.

[18:57] And then you're not going to tell me how many you made you're not going to tell me like I don't I don't know I don't like to deal in uncertainties when it comes to fomo.

[19:07] Because I just again it's only July July August September October November December like again like six months for six months of a company that can make 800 games a week.

[19:21] I'm really not feeling like this game is going to be ever hard to get.

[19:25] You know that the good news is this is that jaws is a better game than King Kong.

[19:34] And jaws will always be desirable way more than King Kong jaws is jaws jaws is iconic jaws will always be iconic Stern's King Kong game is a total miss.

[19:45] It's a total miss they did not capture the iconic King Kong in any way shape or form they didn't serve back to us iconic King Kong moments.

[19:56] It's a total miss on every level and I mean this like it's just a miss like Jurassic Park at least made you feel more like the Jurassic Park movies.

[20:05] I don't think this makes you feel any connection to King Kong at all.

[20:09] Like the way people think of Kong the way people hear Kong the way people they and again it just feels like a little cartoon like the way they approach Kong just feels very juvenile and neutered and and and it doesn't click for people.

[20:26] So I think Kong is just like who cares like who cares like every time I see Kong at least I don't care looks like I'm looking at a pro every time I look at the Kong doll playfield that I've no clear code on it.

[20:39] I'm like this game looks dull it looks boring it looks.

[20:43] And and look the Kong owners will try to like hype it I don't care I just don't care it's like it's like John Wick I just don't care about John Wick.

[20:52] I don't care what they do to the game I just you know for me with so much product in market and so many great Stern machines available and so many great games from other companies available when a game to me misses the mark I'm not going to be one of those content creators that tries to see the good in it and tries the warm up to it.

[21:12] No I won't no total miss you're going to charge me $13,000 and you won't even license Kong's imagery properly you won't even license the Empire State Building you won't even license any iconic King Kong movie posters I cheap cutting corner approach no thank you on to the next on to the next I don't stern you you made you this is your problem that you created once you want to charge this much money.

[21:41] I'm not buying an asset list King Kong ever and most people feel that way Godzilla all the assets you want jaws all the assets you want easy pass easy pass.

[22:01] And and and making it even easier to pass on Kong is are all the mechanical issues with the game I mean all the mechanical issues with that game such an easy pass.

[22:13] You know if you like if you guys want to I want to I want to plug I'm going to put my friends fashion line in the chat here but if you guys want like cool clothes that make you look like I mean this brand is amazing.

[22:40] And you know if you tired of this is like a canada ad if you're tired of looking like the same cargo shortwear and pinball dude this is this brand is I mean I went there I got these vintage war war two glasses there this weekend my friend john went to high school with them has this really awesome fashion line call revey I'm going to put it right here right now guys.

[23:08] Clothes are amazing the every it's just cool like you want to be like a little Paul Newman kind of you know don't look like every other dude with the polo or the vineyard vines or whatever you guys are rocking this these clothes amazing amazing so trust me you and you'll look so good in everything I mean well yes.

[23:33] Yeah cargo shirt you know what I started using I have a fany pack I have a IPG who's my parent company for now for omnicom takes over I have a fany pack and I will say there's nothing in the summer more practical there's nothing more practical than a fany pack when you're riding a bike to the beach and you just want to have like your phone your wallet.

[24:03] Like you're you know your AirPods you know you don't want everything in your short in your swim trunk short so the fany pack is like yeah like it's the greatest invention ever feel so cool not cool at the same time.

[24:17] Alright so okay so Kong is a miss jaws 50 it the jaws 50th will sell fine I think the dilemma I mean jaws sold a lot I always wish that's turn.

[24:30] Would somehow communicate earlier on what their plans would be with a theme so like but again I mean I fully expect there to be a Batman 60th anniversary next year.

[24:45] You know what I'm saying like why would they not do Batman 60th.

[24:51] They need to make money gang and more people want batmans then you know walking dead.

[25:00] Oh geez not caring firearms.

[25:05] Um man how's everybody doing Frank how you doing Frank I think our golf is going to get rained out next week I just I can't believe the week I took off in this beautiful beachy town I live in is going to be nothing but rain showers all week all week I'm like I don't I can't get a break.

[25:30] I might almost flip the dates and just I don't know.

[25:42] What an absolute vlog this guy is who's this guy is this is retro Aussie is this guy making fun of me.

[25:51] Dude you're coming in hot with the troll let's see I think he's like I think the other thing you said is.

[25:57] Try hard who is this guy brother what like do you want to stay and hang out because like dude I'm just gonna block you right now but I just want to I want you to um it's an interesting way to spend some time just roll into canators and yeah man I would love to keep you around but what's a vlog even mean let's see.

[26:21] I don't even know what a vlog is I've been called a lot of stuff is that an Australian term definition of a vlog beat.

[26:31] Beat someone with a whip or stick as punishment and torture.

[26:36] Oh that doesn't how's that that's a verb.

[26:41] What does it mean to be call oh.

[26:45] A person considered to be pretentious concede it or foolish as evidence suggests it is Australian oh okay so this guy I'm getting an Australian insult.

[27:02] Yeah.

[27:05] I mean I love it yeah he could stay just listen to me bro dude because you're spending your time listening to me who's winning in this scenario I bring all the Australian insults man I love it.

[27:24] Albert said he felt free since he stopped listening to canada on his podcast.

[27:30] You know look um orbiter Albert right like the dude exists to get a reaction at me I haven't listened to his show in years so like he can join the club of people that you didn't know it's sad to me is when these people leave they they can't just like unsubscribe they have to leave and try to tell other people to unsubscribe like like it's like I'm not just leaving the restaurant we all should leave.

[27:59] The restaurant Albert I feel sorry for you man I really do because like that's such a caddy and petty way to just if you've had enough of my podcast you just leave but you feel free now if you felt trapped by listening to canad is bimbal podcast something's wrong with your life brother like I didn't trap you I didn't even make you sign up you signed up bro I don't care.

[28:25] I still got the most subscribers more than anybody everybody combines I'm still happy with the show I do I don't make anybody join I if you want to cancel cancel if you want to join join it's still the most entertaining pinball podcast out there and the majority of people consider it that that's why we have the most subscribers.

[28:46] But you know Jamie at wormhole tried to do the same thing like I'm leaving you know because of what he said about barrels of fun I'm leaving and you should unsubscribe he did it to kale and to retro Ralph and you kind of force them both unsubscribe which they did which I don't care doesn't like doesn't.

[29:05] It doesn't change anything because what what these guys don't get is this is my creative outlet and I enjoy doing it.

[29:11] Chris don't listen to him anyway I love I love let's talk about let's talk about Potter okay Albert I know you're here bro I know you're here.

[29:41] But like you know like it's fine it's fine bro like I believe me we've all been in this game for so many years the last thing that I think about on my mind these days is where I stand in favor with other pinball personalities like it's you again I keep saying this my favorite pinball personality the only guy that like really gets it these days is Cal Hernandez over at electric bat he's the coolest dude I'm going to do.

[30:11] I know in pinball right now on the content level I'm on a chain with kale retro Ralph and Jamie from the wormhole.

[30:21] Cal and I are just having fun every day texting stuff retro Ralph refuses to engage he refuses to engage is busy putting on his Harry Potter robe I'm having so much fun 96 modes of not not so muted movie clips now I'm okay let's talk about it because look I think A.I.

[30:41] Gate is over I know they're pausing to fix some of the artwork when you stand over the game you're not going to notice any of that it's just it's just like it's it's it's it's so small the A.I. issues everyone's been moping about I think Potter is again it's just going to be a game a lot of people wait for there's going to be a lot of orders they're going to sell a ton of potters like I keep saying this like they're going to sell

[31:11] a lot of potters I hear is the thing is I don't think they're going to sell as many potters as guns and roses I don't think Potter as a coded game is coded as good as guns and roses I just think it shoots better than guns and roses but it's not more fun to like I okay it's more fun to shoot

[31:36] but I think what makes Harry Potter annoying is the way everything is stacked on top of everything on that game because imagine guns and roses when you start a song everything else was still active and every song was interrupted with other stuff I I think Harry Potter is Achilles heel right now is simply that is at the code is a convoluted complex mess

[32:04] where it's just too much happening at once retro retro Aussie man let me tell you something about me let me tell you something about me like I've

[32:24] anything you think about me I know about myself right and anyone who's anyone who pretends to go through life

[32:36] and an act like your perfect or you're not insecure you'd have no anxiety is no fear is come on every we're all in the same boat brother we're all in the same rock hurling through space right we're all going to die so like I just think I'm

[32:53] just think if you hang out more you'll get past the superficial you know look I on purpose man I on purpose know exactly what I do I know that I can rock up and look like a D bag and I can dress like an A hole I know everything I do it I'm not doing it

[33:11] without acknowledgement or understanding of what this is gonna make people think about me and I'm a very flawed human being I have good qualities and bad qualities but in the end

[33:24] those who know me when you're a friend of mine I have a really good heart and I do and I mean well and I think I understand more about life than you know then some of the other you know influence is out there in the world that are just doing it like I'm good because remember I'm not doing this for much money at all but yeah yeah no I just want to have a good time I have a good time like we're all we're all gonna die we're talking about pinball

[33:53] and every day above ground is a good day there's gonna be good days there's gonna be bad days just as much as we can wake up in a good mood good and I love Australia so I got invited to go to the Australian pinball expo

[34:08] and I need to get back to these guys but I guess the thing is this how do I can ask you guys and don't tell them I said this how do I explain to my friends who invited me

[34:21] that I just don't think I could do like a 16 to 18 hour flight in coach like is it how do you like you know what I'm saying if someone invites you and they're they're gonna pay for my plane ticket but how do I how do I let them know that like I just can't do a flight that long in coach.

[34:44] I just like I don't know how to say it back without sounding like a prima don a douche but like in the end like I just I can't do it I can't do it.

[34:59] Should I do like a canada go fun me to upgrade to first class what should I do what should be a fun way to do this but Wayne wasn't the invite it was it was other and I was like I'm gonna do it.

[35:13] It was it was other enthusiasts over there they want me to come to the show premium economy now in premium economy do you can you lie down like I what how nice is I because some planes are different some planes you know I just need to go flat though.

[35:31] Because because I have to assume a ticket from New York to Australia is like first class or business class I mean we got some time but I mean it's probably a five to eight thousand dollar ticket right.

[35:46] Heaps of legroom no no I need I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it I can't do it like I fly I can't.

[35:58] I know I know I but I think I think if we set up a canada go fun me because you know you know my my my fans have raised money for a lot worse causes we could probably knock that in half.

[36:25] I've got some frequent flyer miles go air New Zealand and stop off in New Zealand.

[36:37] Yeah I know Jack is going I bet Jack's flying business class I know it's like 10k I'm not surprised that's what I've spent going to Japan so much nicer you know get you look forward to the flight.

[36:53] Ah it's killing me maybe I could split it with those guys well I'll have to reach out to them but like it's just the truth I just want to be honest I can't fly that far.

[37:05] It's just too much.

[37:15] Get canada to Australia business class will be fun.

[37:22] Now I you know and then I would wear like a t-shirt with all the sponsors names on it like it'd be the most funny first class experience well I'm going to figure out if we can do this.

[37:35] Look I mean retro Ralph got a free well not free he shot the content but he got paid in a.

[37:43] He got paid in a Harry Potter CE to make the launch video that's 15k and you're telling me what would be more entertaining canada in Australia or Ralph's video with the keys in the back box we saw the keys.

[38:01] Try to get Ralph to just make a response is funny he won't do it.

[38:08] What do we got here.

[38:12] Geez retro I'm happily married.

[38:17] That'd be funny.

[38:21] Okay so Potter code who here who here's played Potter.

[38:27] The thing about Potter that's interesting is like almost almost like everybody who ordered one never played it yet so I look I just think it's good news that they're making unlimited C.E.

[38:38] I still think the C.E. Toppers just so embarrassing I don't like the more I see the C.E. the less I.

[38:45] It's not aging on me that was the knee Malima or whatever the version is I actually think the arcade versions the way to go I just saw some dude.

[38:54] 10k arcade version of the game it you lose nothing the hot rails are there.

[39:00] What do you have to add a shaker motor that's it and you got the same game.

[39:04] Let me tell you as someone who has all those dumb lights underneath and behind like the lights on the cabinet you don't know it doesn't do anything you don't even notice it because it the play.

[39:14] Field so lit up.

[39:17] I think the arcade is the way to go because I again I just I don't think there's like any you won't be having any more fun on any of the other versions.

[39:30] You think about a pinball experience and you're just you know the moment you're locked in right the actual sex with the machine like let's use that as a metaphor when you're actually having sex with the machine.

[39:42] You got your hands on the buttons on the I could use other terminology I won't.

[39:52] And you plunge the ball nobody on a wizard edition or a collector's edition is having more fun than you and you spent $10,000.

[40:04] The arcade edition is the way to go.

[40:08] 100% I think I think people order the C.E.s are going to be disappointed when they see the top or I don't think the other C.E. elements are worth it.

[40:18] I just don't.

[40:23] It's really not I can I this is like so ridiculous to me that the mean a lemma is not the most beautiful cabin pinball like it's gang like what what the heck are you guys talking about like I understand that Eric and the Potter fanatics geek out over that but that does not look better than Deadpool or Batman SLE or ghost busters.

[40:49] I'm sorry gang it's in person it's and it's like a matte finish.

[40:56] I'm sorry it doesn't pop it doesn't make your jaw drop it's not a wow machine to walk up to I'm sorry I am being completely objective here I think avatar has more avatar C.E. looks better to walk up to.

[41:15] Elton John platinum is more wow evil dead is more wow I'm sorry those people again most of you haven't even seen it in person it's dull because it's got like a matte finish I'm sorry.

[41:36] She would I mean I just.

[41:43] No I just don't think it like and again like to me and I know this is a weird thing to harp on but to me the top or like ruins the entire package.

[41:54] Because I just think the top or should have been made also by me an a lemma like the fact that why didn't Eric get me an a lemma.

[42:03] To make the top or for the damn game like what what's wrong with these people like why do I have to tell them this like you you've got this artist making is the most unique it is I'll give him this it is the most unique.

[42:16] Decision to make a game this way so then you just mail in on the top and slap on some plastic ugly crappy hog wards why didn't you have me an a lemma make a hog wards beautiful like artistic layer top or that just tied it all together.

[42:37] To stick that thing on top of this game it's like taking a dump on top of a Ferrari so I'll give you this the game is but it just it ruins it for me and they had eight years to get this top or beautiful and nobody stood and looked at it and said we're not putting this crap on this game.

[42:59] I can't the avatar toppers incredible the Elton John C. E. topper works perfectly albeit it's just leftover parts from what from toy story.

[43:11] It's buddy.

[43:16] Who is running the Australian expo used to be Wayne.

[43:19] Marty Robbins man dude where's Marty Robbins these days is anybody know.

[43:27] Like has he like him and Damien like has he have they what has anyone like followed up on like what where's Damien now.

[43:35] Because dudes like that don't fully go away they they declare bankruptcy on this LLC and then they move on to their next like next like shady business.

[43:46] But has anyone heard from Marty or Damien I'm asking the Australian dudes.

[43:52] Who was on the podcast.

[43:56] Oh Wayne was.

[44:03] I will say this you guys in Australia you guys are like you guys are crazy man like the prices you guys pay on a machine.

[44:15] Marty Robbins was on a podcast who who had him on the podcast.

[44:25] Oh back on final round.

[44:28] Well I mean no one's going to take that guy seriously again.

[44:33] I mean but final round is Jeff T. O. this I mean T. O. this has been trying to get him back.

[44:39] Back into the game and.

[44:41] And they didn't even talk about Haggis see it's a joke now it's just that's just that's just Marty and Jeff singing in the shower now thinking they're like they've got a sold out stadium.

[44:53] No one's.

[44:55] Dude when Jeff T. O. this came back and tried to like.

[44:59] Help us your Marty back into the hobby.

[45:08] I don't know.

[45:11] I don't think he's I don't think he's a you know like I don't this maybe he's a good dude I don't know but I think the way he compartmentalized.

[45:20] Haggis with his show and like selectively decided not to give updates when he did I don't know man like he knew he knew that company was up up up you know what's Creek he knew that he knew the company was failing and he still went on.

[45:34] And and refuse to give updates or told people like I don't know man I don't think that's like what a good dude does.

[45:42] So don't don't um.

[45:45] You know and you got to remember like I have friends who lost like.

[45:50] Twenty thousand dollars on this company sorry.

[45:53] No no no it's also like people forget like Jeff off so allowed Steve Boud in to come in there and was like put you know he was hyping deep route for the longest time.

[46:07] Because this is what because I get it like Steve Boud and your friend so you you let him pump and dump his company Marty Robbins is your friend so you let him hype it and in the end like.

[46:17] Everyone who listened to canada didn't lose a dollar everybody listen to Jeff T. O list like lost a ton of money.

[46:24] And then you got to go listen to like the backpedaling shows that he did.

[46:28] You know it's amazing to me is it dude hates my guts I mean I know he hates my guts but like it is what it is like there's a reason why final round has like.

[46:37] Like for patreon subscribers.

[46:39] You know what I'm saying here let's look and see how many they have right now hold on.

[46:44] Numbers don't lie as I say right let's see final round how many people are contributing to final round pinball podcasts.

[46:52] Let's see can someone look it up for me.

[46:57] Here we go find it.

[47:03] All right here we go.

[47:05] Final round pinball.

[47:17] I don't even know if they're still on here.

[47:22] Pinball.

[47:25] Here we go we got it I got everybody up right now.

[47:28] Now I'm going to go and get the money.

[47:32] Bowing done pinball profile pinball party carry triple drain.

[47:39] I don't even know if they're still on here I don't think so.

[47:45] Final round pinball.

[47:47] Patreon let me make Google search it.

[47:55] I don't think they're still on it.

[47:57] Oh well now they got zero.

[48:07] Yeah but you know here's a thing Albert here's a thing is like.

[48:15] The problem with Jeff and I said this to his face.

[48:19] If you want to be a positive ambassador for pinball I'm all for that brother.

[48:25] I do think Jeff has done a lot of great stuff for pinball.

[48:29] But what he fails to recognize though is the character like he can't see past the Andrew highways, the Robert Mueller's, the Damien Hardins.

[48:40] Like he literally gives everybody everybody.

[48:43] Not just the past but he continues to endorse these companies well into periods of them ripping off customers and being caught in lies.

[48:55] So there's a line where like are you positive or you just like are you celebrating everybody and everyone regardless of context.

[49:05] And then once you do that then you cease to have something called credibility because you're burying what's happening over at Haggis because Marty's your friend.

[49:17] So then you're just selective revisionist history on all these companies and then and then you're not just that though you're bringing personalities on to your show.

[49:27] To convince consumers everything is all right with these companies.

[49:32] So these people are placing non-refundable deposits and then when they go belly up you take no accountability.

[49:39] So go back and listen to canators pinball podcasts where I ever interviewed Marty Robbins ever.

[49:44] I think I interviewed Damien once back in the Haggis days never in before what when he did like counts never again.

[49:51] Never wanted Andrew highway on never wanted Steve Bowden on never you know never wanted to be a good guy.

[49:57] Never I had Robert Mueller early on early on and then what did I do I chastise that dude when it was clear he didn't know what the heck he was doing.

[50:08] Yes, so just saying just saying like I don't know like if you're going to do positive things for pinball maybe the most positive thing you can do is prevent people from getting scammed by friends of yours in the industry.

[50:28] Yeah, Albert yeah, I don't I don't see all the hard work these tournament guys do oh man to tell me how much hard work is the tournament.

[50:36] I'll tell you why I don't go near pinball tournaments.

[50:41] Because they're boring.

[50:45] You're seeing a pinball tournament room during a show like everyone else at the show drink and having a good time like you know what I'm saying they've ever ever pop your head into the tournament room.

[50:53] It is like it's got the same vibes is like going into like a public bathroom in central park.

[51:04] It's just like it's just hot everyone sweating.

[51:09] People are like bang in machines like people are like fighting for for that leaderboard and then when they're at the shows these dudes are just like it just hijacks all their time.

[51:23] Okay, cool like I just don't why would you do that.

[51:28] Are you going to remember finishing 18th in that tournament or you can remember like hanging out with your best buddies and like actually having a great time at a show.

[51:43] All right, then I'm reading some of your comments Andrew highway remember he bought that boat and he tried to like fix that boat.

[51:53] But then they found out about his pinball venture and they all the investors left.

[52:01] Let's see who we got here the most positive is to be honest never blind of yeah yeah.

[52:13] Yeah, no they are depressing the tournament rooms but like gang I've never in a million years like everyone knows like canada's canada covers.

[52:20] A portion of the hobby tournament play is not not for me man not for me like it's when nature was when into tournament talk it was like the show is over the show is over.

[52:32] I don't like tournaments I don't like league nights I don't want to spend three four hours watching you know crazy levy spent a half hour on a machine and and dude you know what I hate about okay I hate to strong war you know I don't like I don't like watching the way location players and tournaments.

[53:02] I don't like when I see these guys like slapping the machines like throwing them around I'm like what do you think you're trying to do here.

[53:17] I don't know talk about having to slap machines let's get back to some of these pinball games.

[53:24] Apparently Dungeons and Dragons is very out lane drain heavy and there's an out lane on it that's wide open that you can't close up and I'm hearing from the D&D owners I'm in the thread was reading it they're they hate it.

[53:41] And even though you got the center shield.

[53:44] It's really ruining the fun of the game.

[53:47] And some fortunate I hate guns and roses is an out lane drain monster ninja turtles is another wizard of ours is another.

[53:58] Which games do you guys think I'm curious what you guys think is I think there's nothing more frustrating than a game that just constantly out lane drains.

[54:06] It ruins it ruins the phone it it ruins the you know you're enjoyment and any miss shot is going to send it there which games are just terrible stranger things okay.

[54:23] Why doesn't this guy like wick.

[54:27] Which guy me.

[54:30] Robert are you asking me why I don't like wick is all explain in a second.

[54:44] Here's my yeah turtles is terrible.

[54:50] I don't like John wick and.

[54:55] A wick has some out lane problems I just think John wick.

[55:01] I love the first movie.

[55:03] I probably really enjoyed the first three John wick movies.

[55:08] But they just kept on going.

[55:11] And I remember I walked out of the theater on the last one.

[55:15] And I was a moment where he was running he was in this sort of like French.

[55:24] Like apartment or sort of like brownstone in France and he and he needed to get out and he like ran and jumped through glass doors or a window on like like 30 40 feet up.

[55:43] And just Superman through glass and then rolled on the ground and was up.

[55:49] And that that's when I walked out I was like.

[55:53] I get that this movies always these movies have always been about you know hyperbolic action scenes and like you know unbelievable but but once you cross over to stuff like that now where he's just completely invincible like a superhero.

[56:11] I'm out I'm done. I mean like I get it.

[56:15] It was fun.

[56:17] Boogie man like the the continental the gold coins all of it it worked for a while and then it just too many of them.

[56:26] And I just I just thought it was ridiculous.

[56:29] And so that.

[56:34] You know it's become one of these movies now where you go back and watch it every once in a while but like do I want to own a John Wick pinball machine that has no guns.

[56:46] I also I think what would have made me own a John Wick machine is if they nailed the theme and look I think they missed the theme not because of the lack of guns on the artwork is the guns are all on the screen.

[56:58] And so that's the all the action shots John Wick is all about a rave under glass it needed to be that it needed to have like lasers and like feel like you're going into a nightclub.

[57:12] And they failed to capture any of that because Stern's lighting system is cheap AF.

[57:19] And I'm just feeling of that vibe of John Wick in that game at all like it really needed to feel like I'm stepping into one of those like laser beam mirrors nightclub assassins like bad ass neo Tokyo kind of vibes.

[57:39] And I just see I mean they tried to with like the plastics with the neon but it's just it's just Stern's platform.

[57:49] It is so limited in how it can really creatively create some of these themes under glass that it's just like the easiest pass ever.

[58:03] Better with code no no they just released a big code update nobody cares man.

[58:10] You know it's like it's like asking it will a dead person have more personality if you change their clothes you know it's a it's like the games dead the games dead like no there are certain games that are so far beyond saving that any resources allocated to trying to say.

[58:32] Those games is a further waste of money you're not going to sell any more John wicks ever if you're stern john wick owners have lost a fortune the games are going to keep going down john wick a Lisa another one of these do you see the venom Ellie for 7000 game.

[58:51] That that's that's john wick a venom Ellie and it's not even sold a venom Ellie for 7000 dollars.

[59:03] I mean talk about like how bad Stern marketing was for a while like I jody made some really bad decisions.

[59:14] But even when I talk to George you know they were like oh we're supposed to launch venom with the venom movie then that got the late like no one cares about the venom movies.

[59:24] Like what where are you guys in all this like who's got the who's got their finger on the pulse of real culture because it's not venom never was venom.

[59:40] Gang I know I don't I don't really bus care much and I you know i'm losing money not being on Facebook, but I think you guys prefer this platform I know there's like super chats here.

[59:49] But if you if you like what you're hearing and you want to make a donation to canate his bimbal podcast in first class Australian business ticket donation.

[01:00:28] Long in my password.

[01:00:33] My PayPal currently with the balance.

[01:00:42] I've minus do I owe them a penny.

[01:00:51] I have a minus one balance is funny let me show you guys this.

[01:00:56] Oh my god this is so funny.

[01:01:03] Uh.

[01:01:09] There's a Halloween yeah like I think some of these older spooky games.

[01:01:16] Like servo issues and Halloween and I don't know and they're ultra man's like.

[01:01:26] You can't even really give it away to be honest.

[01:01:33] Yeah I am.

[01:01:38] My overall feeling gang and all of this is where we are at a.

[01:01:44] I hate to use the term like the golden age of pinball like that there's more great pinball now in the world than there's ever been in the history of the world.

[01:01:52] There are so many great games.

[01:01:54] You don't need to spend a fortune to have pinball fun.

[01:01:57] And the biggest problem right now I see is you have like 14 pinball companies that need to sell new inbox games every year.

[01:02:04] And people are pretty much at a room.

[01:02:07] And you know you normally need to sell a game to get a new game but selling that old game is harder and harder because everything is oversaturated.

[01:02:17] And so in an oversaturated market it sort of begs the question why is why aren't pinball companies pulling back more versus pumping more out.

[01:02:30] And I also think in an oversaturated market you have to work much harder to make sure you nail the theme and you really nail the.

[01:02:40] The sales like you need to nail the sales.

[01:02:45] You know I've I know that barrels a fun doon is.

[01:02:51] You know they've sold they've sold a decent amount but not where they need it to be by now.

[01:02:58] And you know the hard part now is every month that goes by June you know June becomes an old game even though people don't have it yet.

[01:03:11] And so then the attention goes on to jaws 50th the attention goes on to episode one through three star wars the attention is going to go on to other games and you know by the time they've made.

[01:03:27] 500 doons we might be seeing Keith Owens Pokemon and doon was never a theme that most people wanted.

[01:03:45] So I just well look I I think man barrels to me is just a little bit of an enigma like if they had just nailed the theme they were they would have sold so many more games.

[01:04:03] But I like I can't make I can't get into the head of a pinball manufacturer.

[01:04:13] And you know David's it's like David got it done he made all the lab in the games and I do give them credit for you know there's no shenanigans I mean you ordered a game from barrels you got a game.

[01:04:25] You know they have to start somewhere.

[01:04:28] But now they need to know the theme and I think spooky is just.

[01:04:33] Spooky's the company that I would I would want to just walk in every day to.

[01:04:40] You're in I mean look you're in Benton Wisconsin so which means like every.

[01:04:45] Every hot waitress at the local bars going to know me.

[01:04:50] I'm just joking no but you're like you're literally living in Benton Wisconsin.

[01:04:56] Which I tend to believe the reason I love what I know they have.

[01:05:02] Is they have two things that are everything it's and it's not and one of them's not a pinball company.

[01:05:08] They have family and they have community.

[01:05:12] Alright so when you think about and I realize this the older I get in life is like you want to live somewhere where there's a community and you want to live somewhere where like you have family and now by family I mean.

[01:05:22] The family you're born into and the family you choose.

[01:05:27] And as you get older in life like you know sometimes the family you choose is is the family you consider family.

[01:05:34] But I feel like those guys roll in every day and they've got that.

[01:05:41] And they don't have the stresses of super high rent because Benton Wisconsin is making it very favorable for spooky pinball to operate there as they should it's an American that's how the American process should work.

[01:05:56] You're creating jobs in our tiny little town so we're going to help you keep those jobs intact that's how it should be looking out for a local businesses ability to thrive.

[01:06:10] Right versus just like squeezing them so they have to take the jobs elsewhere right Jersey Jack wanted to stay in New Jersey was just it was just too expensive even the taxes in New Jersey I mean much cheaper to make the games where they're making them now.

[01:06:31] And I just think like that's where the fun is at right.

[01:06:38] I think Stern.

[01:06:44] You know Stern is such a company at a crossroad and the crossroad Stern is at is so simple in my mind they need their next evolution of their platform they need to get their games looking closer to how a Jersey Jack pinball machine looks.

[01:07:10] Isn't it funny how both of these companies to me just compliment each other like if they were to like have a baby then we'd have the best pinball in the world Jersey Jack's platform is the most gorgeous in the history of pinball and nothing's ever come close to looking as beautiful as the JJP the games are just like don't shoot very well and are overly complex Stern makes much more enjoyable shooting games Stern understands how to bake more fun into a pinball.

[01:07:39] And experience but Stern games look cheap compares compared you go from you go from a King Kong L.E. to a Harry Potter like even the Harry Potter arcade edition looks more expensive Stern just doesn't make a 13,000 dollar product I mean I it's just like there's no other way to say it they literally do not make a 13,000 dollar product they don't look that expensive they don't feel that expensive.

[01:08:08] And it doesn't stop there those 13,000 dollar Sterns don't even come with a topper or all the accessories so all in some of these Stern machines are 15,000,000 dollars they charge just 20,000 dollars for James Bond 60.

[01:08:28] You have to like I you know I always there are seminal moves that a company will make that telegraph F what they think about the community and how they value their own product.

[01:08:43] Charging 20 grand for James Bond 60 of to me like that was the moment like you have that and then you highlight a hologram sticker as one of the special things you're going to get with Charles 50.

[01:08:58] They're good guys over there you know I met with Seth I met with Gary I met with George they're great guys.

[01:09:08] I'm going to be honest I would love I would love to work in Stern pinball and have the ability to make an impact not sure I could because I'm not sure like you know I don't have all the line of sight into the margins and everything.

[01:09:26] But I definitely know this community and I mean this when I say this and I told us to Gary I told it to George I told it to Seth I know the new inbox collector buyer better than they do.

[01:09:41] It's that simple they their company's marketing has been run by someone who doesn't understand collectors or new inbox buyers.

[01:09:53] Run by pinball players pinball nerds tournament guys like their mindset Gary's Gary's always seen the distros as the as the customer right when you see the distros and the dealers as the customer.

[01:10:06] You're not seeing the real end user because he doesn't care like as long as the orders are coming in from these people I don't care what.

[01:10:15] The buyer the actual buyer of my product I see my buyer as the dealer in the distro that is how that company is operated for decades and it worked for decades just doesn't work like it used to anymore.

[01:10:27] So nobody's looking out for the actual for you and me and user.

[01:10:36] I would absolutely be successful at Stern.

[01:10:39] Can I have you had much to do with Wayne in Australia I know Wayne I know Wayne pretty well right Wayne we've we've talked for years.

[01:10:51] Wayne's a really good guy Wayne's I like Wayne because he's a he's a he's a alpha male.

[01:11:06] You know Wayne's one of these dudes to like Wayne Wayne knew how full of BS Damien was right away.

[01:11:14] Wayne warned many people me included and I believed Wayne.

[01:11:24] Wayne right how many times Wayne were you sharing like literally public info on the realities of Damien's BS and even when Wayne was trying to wave the flag.

[01:11:38] People wouldn't listen I listened.

[01:11:48] I know well the reason I say Wayne's a little bit of an alpha male is he's very you know he's like he is he's like aggressive you know he's got more aggressive personality.

[01:12:03] A beta male.

[01:12:07] Oversearch rate it overpriced.

[01:12:14] How you guys feeling about the hobby.

[01:12:17] How much longer do you think it's just you think it's just going to keep on trucking like this like people just losing a ton on every game like.

[01:12:24] We've been talked about all the new games I don't I think Predator is kind of dead on arrival.

[01:12:29] I don't know what the people are brothers do now.

[01:12:33] I think Predator is it's it's kind of like already out of my mind I don't know if you still think about it but I it's one of those games where.

[01:12:44] I kind of seen enough like I don't.

[01:12:48] I feel I'm just feel like I feel bad but then I don't feel bad I just again it's one of these things where.

[01:12:54] Marketing is important.

[01:13:04] Yeah it's too much money right if Predator was like 79 95 I think they would sell but it's it's twice the price to your door.

[01:13:17] You think we're going to get Cuphead out this month that's the rumor from Kerry Hardy that Cuphead arrives.

[01:13:23] In in July.

[01:13:28] I've got no more info on Star Wars other than I'm hearing it's episode one through three let me check my PayPal.

[01:14:54] I feel like the maybe open it up for people to pay you to not come might get more.

[01:15:06] Oh that's funny if canada asked people if you got to pay me not to go to Australia.

[01:15:14] Wayne what's the what is what's the vibe on canada over in Australia.

[01:15:19] Like the people like canadips pinball podcast do they like me over there or am I in my more popular than Damien can we start there let's start that is like the bottom level of popularity.

[01:15:32] I can't do now I'm outside it's like Sunday morning I'm not waking up my neighbors screaming get to the chop up.

[01:15:41] You they would even say run.

[01:15:43] All right let's refresh it see what we got anything anyone.

[01:15:52] We're still stuck we're still stuck at 44.

[01:15:56] I'll stop sharing screen is never going to work on.

[01:16:00] All right I'm going to do a few more minutes I'm really excited today I am going to.

[01:16:08] Gonna go this is the first time ever this is ever happened in my family so just to give you guys I know sometimes I talk personal life and I you know just let you into my world a little bit.

[01:16:18] I I'd been a strange from my older brother for around 30 years.

[01:16:23] My older brother is three years older than me and really hard childhood with older brother that you know we we had a lot of.

[01:16:33] There's a lot of fighting there's a lot of tension there's a lot of but like really like three boys like a lot of like very physical very violent like traumatic childhood growing up.

[01:16:46] Parents sent them away to school like I don't want to give you all the details but anyway we are strange for so many years.

[01:16:52] I for for for a lot of years in my life I never went home for the holidays because I just wanted to avoid certain family members.

[01:17:01] And then unfortunately his wife passed away about two months ago a month ago from cancer very young.

[01:17:13] And at the funeral home after 30 years of being estranged we all reconciled me my twin brother and my older brother and most amazing mother's day.

[01:17:28] Was we took my mom out for the first time in 30 years she saw all of her boys together which is very special so today is a very special day because for the first time we're all going to go to my twin brothers house he's got a beautiful swimming pool.

[01:17:40] And it's going to be all three sons the grandchildren for my parents killing Cassie and the killings got his snorkel and his mask and he's got his floaty my brothers got an amazing pool like it's the size of my backyard bigger than my backyard it's like it's like a Vegas it's like it's like he's got like a Vegas.

[01:18:00] Like hotel pool and it's amazing so I really am looking forward to today and it's it's beautiful sunny 88 perfect weather as you can see and we're going to go there at noon today and just have a really amazing moment now I'm just what fills me was such joy is that my parents is biggest regret in life was the fact that their kids weren't getting along.

[01:18:29] So for all of us to finally get along and what was amazing about it and believe me there was a lot of tears there's a lot of hugging there's a lot of crying there's a lot a lot of everything you know when you when you hold 30 years of emotions inside it comes out so instantly and and it's so beautiful now and my older brother has a beautiful son he's incredible like it's just it's also just feeling now like we have a family unit again that can help you do it.

[01:18:58] And that can help each other because we all need help and we need to it's just everything like the one of the biggest fears of my life was always what happens if my parents pass away and there's all this tension that that just terrified me my whole life I just thought like oh my gosh like everything's going to be a fight everything's going to be like it's just going to get worse and worse and worse.

[01:19:22] Now it's the complete opposite is like we can actually talk like adults about how we how we manage our family and how we manage ourselves and our relationships and then these assets and everything we have like let's not let's not fight each other and and and compete with each other like let's work together to build upon you know what this family has and it's just a beautiful thing and I just feel very blessed so today's going to be a very magical day.

[01:19:53] He's close by but he's moving he's moving I think he might be moving I think he's moving down to North Carolina.

[01:20:00] You know like people get out of here because where he's at high tax regions so like you go down to North Carolina you get the most amazing house your property taxes or nothing.

[01:20:10] I think everyone's real this is why like gang I'm happy I moved out in New York City when I did because of that if that dude wins the mayor the mayorial election.

[01:20:21] I didn't think like New York City is just going to keep going south and the reason I is this it's just it's so expensive to live there you don't need to you used to have to live in a city to make a lot of money right like those hedge fund jobs where you had to be in the city.

[01:20:40] You had to be like physically in a city to get those opportunities now you can be anywhere and you can make that money you don't need to be living in such an expensive area of the world.

[01:20:58] And also I have to say this like the city's is not the same man it's not fun the kids don't go out the nightlife is not what it used to be.

[01:21:05] And then it's just build you know with a bunch of narcissistic pricks everywhere like I get it I can get that everywhere you know and maybe I'm one of them but I don't need to go there.

[01:21:16] I go into the city now to work which is what I still do a few days a week and then I go in there for my Japanese jazz bar.

[01:21:23] And I can what I love about where I live here is I can go into the city I'm there one hour train ride.

[01:21:29] I can hit my Japanese jazz bar up for two hours and I'm home by like nine o'clock and I don't need a car so I can walk from the train station to my house.

[01:21:40] It's beautiful. What's up Louie? All right gang as you can see the sun is coming.

[01:21:45] Canators all tan ready for the pool.

[01:21:53] What is a Japanese jazz bar.

[01:22:02] Now people who talk on the train are so annoying it's like everyone's around someone does it like they act like they're in their living room anyway everybody look.
