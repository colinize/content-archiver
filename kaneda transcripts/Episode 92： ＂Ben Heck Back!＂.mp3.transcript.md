[00:00] I'm gonna be with you for the last one.

[00:18] It almost feels like spring is around the corner in February this year.

[00:21] It's kind of amazing.

[00:23] It's a beautiful day.

[00:24] We have a beautiful podcast for you.

[00:26] This is episode 92 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:29] I want to say thank you to all the great emails I've been getting recently.

[00:32] I'm not going to go into them on this podcast because I've got an interview with Mr. Ben

[00:36] Hack.

[00:37] I love interviewing Ben because Ben is in the hobby.

[00:41] He's building pinball machines.

[00:43] He's working with Team Spooky.

[00:45] He's working on his own stuff.

[00:47] He's got a great point of view on everything going on.

[00:50] I love talking to Ben too because he's like all over the place.

[00:54] Notice when I interview him, I can't keep him focused on anyone's subject at one time.

[00:58] That's what I love about Mr. Ben Hack because he actually gets shit done.

[01:02] I actually am uploading a new Magic Girl video today as well.

[01:06] I think I figured out the mystery that is Magic Girl.

[01:10] The answer is pretty much nothing really works on it.

[01:14] It's amazing.

[01:15] You'll see in the YouTube video, go to Canadian pinball on YouTube and you'll see me explain

[01:19] why the software and the hardware just don't connect.

[01:24] I want to say this because I put up a video a few days ago and I was wrong.

[01:30] I thought something was a switch and it was actually a one-way gate and you would have

[01:34] thought that I made a terrible mistake.

[01:37] I cut the wrong wire and the bomb went off and oh my god, canada.

[01:40] You don't know anything about pinball.

[01:42] You're not qualified to give us an assessment of Magic Girl.

[01:45] I love when I hear that from people.

[01:48] I listen to all these people on Pinside telling me more about Magic Girl that's six inches

[01:53] in front of my face.

[01:54] Let me tell you guys, you may know more about pinball than me.

[01:58] I don't pretend to be some pinball expert but I'll say this, I do know physics and I

[02:04] know gravity and I know common sense.

[02:08] I looked at Magic Girl and I could see in 30 seconds that there is just not going to be

[02:15] any multi-ball going on in the game that there are just no physical way for balls to get

[02:20] to certain parts of the machine.

[02:22] I did finally figure out how to shoot the ball from the bottom of the play field up through

[02:28] the top of that center mechanism.

[02:29] It's actually really cool.

[02:30] It's a coil shot and I really don't know why John could just complete this thing.

[02:37] When you look at it, it really feels like anyone who has some decent engineering skill

[02:42] could have figured out how to just lock two balls on those ramps and also have a third

[02:47] shot.

[02:48] I think it just kept playing around with it, playing around with it but it's kind of

[02:51] ridiculous that they ship the game.

[02:56] I don't know, I'm kind of happy to have it.

[02:58] I think someone will eventually fix it.

[03:01] But I also want to let you guys know that I'm not unsatisfied with my purchase.

[03:05] A lot of people keep trying to pat me on the back being like, oh man, I'm sorry, it doesn't

[03:10] work.

[03:11] I never thought it would really work.

[03:14] Someone knows this game came out because of pressure and a pending legal date.

[03:20] That's it.

[03:21] He didn't finish it.

[03:23] It may never be done.

[03:25] That doesn't take away from the specialness of what magic girl means to me.

[03:30] I think a lot of collectors out there feel that way about certain games.

[03:34] We always have to explain ourselves and explain our purchases to people.

[03:38] But does it really matter?

[03:40] Does it really matter where I spend my money and what makes me happy?

[03:44] If walking by magic girl every day in my apartment puts a smile on my face as I head to go to

[03:50] work, to a job I love, or I head to go to a restaurant to meet a girl I love, or head

[03:55] to go to a garage to drive the car I love, then so be it.

[03:59] I feel more content now in my life than I ever have before because I have everything that

[04:04] I really want.

[04:05] I have my health and I have my family and all these things.

[04:08] It's just a pinball machine.

[04:10] It's just a pinball machine.

[04:12] Am I worried that it's going to lose value?

[04:14] No, no, I'm not.

[04:16] I don't even think it will lose value.

[04:18] Magic girl could be the worst playing pinball machine of all time and it will still be valuable

[04:23] because of the story.

[04:25] We'll talk more about that at a later date.

[04:27] I want to give you guys Ben Heck because this is a fun interview.

[04:31] I wish I could go back and do it all over again.

[04:35] What further do the man who's probably more scatterbrain than Jaypop, but a man who

[04:42] can do it and a man who's got great personality, I give you Benjamin Heck.

[04:48] Alright, it's been about, I don't know, Ben what has it been like over almost like a year

[04:54] since we've last talked on a Canadian pinball podcast, Ben Heck is coming back to the show,

[04:59] Ben, welcome.

[05:01] I'm back.

[05:02] Yeah, the last time we talked was I know you're in New Zealand or something?

[05:05] I believe you were.

[05:06] Yeah, that was last February.

[05:08] Wow, time flies.

[05:10] Once a year we're going to do this.

[05:12] They'll be less lagged this time.

[05:14] Right, right.

[05:15] 600 miles apart now.

[05:17] Well, I know my listeners love interviews and I love interviewing people and you are probably

[05:23] the most animated and well spoken and exciting guests out there.

[05:30] Well, maybe not exciting.

[05:32] Oh, gee, thanks.

[05:33] I mean, let's be honest here.

[05:35] Ben, welcome back and like there's a lot going on, right?

[05:37] This week, I mean, I'm physically exhausted from all the magic girl drama and the purging

[05:42] going on and then the foreubs.

[05:44] Oh, where should we start?

[05:46] Where should we start?

[05:47] Do you want to start with?

[05:48] Well, yeah, I'd like to hear more about the magic girl because that was an epic tale

[05:53] of many years.

[05:54] And I know you were involved with John and we all know that it was originally Ben Heck's

[05:58] retro.

[05:59] What was Ben Heck's event, zombie adventure land?

[06:02] And then it became retro atomic, zombie adventure land.

[06:08] Right.

[06:09] And for those of you who aren't familiar with the entire J-pop story and we won't talk

[06:13] about it too long, but Ben connected with John in what, like 2011, 2012.

[06:20] Yeah.

[06:21] It was 2011.

[06:22] And we done an up and wall related episode on my show and then I saw this comment on

[06:29] my website.

[06:31] And it's like, she came down to Illinois sometime.

[06:33] We'll show you how to make real pinball.

[06:35] And then it's like John Papaduke and I'm like, holy shit, it's John Papaduke.

[06:39] And so I pinged him back and that's actually kind of how he started talking.

[06:42] Kind of started talking.

[06:43] But the thing that's interesting is like the very first communication to me was kind

[06:47] of in a, oh, you know, I'm the teacher, you're the learner and that vibe going to it.

[06:54] Maybe that should have been a red flag.

[06:56] But, you know, we all had stars in our eyes back then.

[06:58] I think everybody, you still get credit to this day for being the person who realized

[07:05] it wasn't going to work the fastest.

[07:09] You were in there pretty quick, weren't you?

[07:11] I don't know if that's exactly the way to put it with me.

[07:15] Yeah, didn't we talk about this last time?

[07:17] I can talk about it again.

[07:18] Yeah, a little bit.

[07:19] I mean, it's been a year and well, let's take it from this panel.

[07:22] So Magic Girl comes out.

[07:24] Let me, like, let's start here because we know, I think people know this story like you

[07:28] got in with Johnny, got out with John and John, like, changed the game to Rosa.

[07:32] But so Magic Girl comes out.

[07:33] Like, what are your feelings when you saw that it actually came out and they built it

[07:41] in some fashion?

[07:43] Well, I have to give props to American pinball.

[07:45] They stuck to their word and actually fulfilled that part of the bargain.

[07:49] And as I'm sure you know, that was kind of a, not the best situation.

[07:56] So yeah, I mean, they could have just said, oh, screw this, but they didn't.

[08:01] So they definitely want to make right by customers and obviously, you know, ensure future sales

[08:06] like with the Houdini game.

[08:08] So yeah, I mean, look at me.

[08:11] I just ran away years ago.

[08:13] But the thing is, I never had a contract.

[08:15] I've mentioned that in a pinstead a million times.

[08:18] Yeah.

[08:19] No contract.

[08:20] It doesn't matter.

[08:21] It walk away.

[08:22] I will say this.

[08:23] When you read the feedback about Magic Girl going out and you got a lot of people saying,

[08:27] like, well, it was Rosa money that went into making Magic Girl happen.

[08:31] And we got some people like, oh, well, of course it was.

[08:34] I mean, that happens in every business.

[08:36] Well, it's, yeah, I mean, like, there's a little bit of everything going into like every

[08:40] project from, you know, a little robbing Peter to PayPal.

[08:44] That's the phrase.

[08:45] But it's, but the point you raised is an interesting one because I think American pinball really isn't

[08:50] getting that much credit for doing, you know, sort of like a miracle, how Mary passed

[08:55] with this project.

[08:56] They, they sunk a lot of their money into this a lot.

[09:00] And in a way that you can't really make sense of it, right?

[09:05] Because the plan must have been to have John come on the roster, work on Houdini, and

[09:11] continue to be sort of like their MVP designer.

[09:15] And honestly, I honestly think they completed Magic Girl a lot of embarrassment.

[09:20] I think at the end, you're right.

[09:21] I think they did.

[09:22] I think they, I think when they hooked up with John, they did, they got a pig in a poke.

[09:28] Yeah.

[09:29] I had to explain that term on Pinside.

[09:30] That's where in Medieval times you put a cat in a bag, which is also a cat on the bag

[09:35] comes from and tell people it's a pig.

[09:37] And it's like if they don't open the bag, they don't know it's a pig or not, you know,

[09:40] they don't know it's a cat until it's too late.

[09:42] And you know, when I saw Houdini, the whitewood or whitewood with arch or whatever, Joe

[09:47] Boles were called it at Expo.

[09:49] I'm like, well, this isn't, this isn't even a game.

[09:52] It's just a blinking diorama.

[09:54] And I don't think, I don't think American Pimball realized that was the case with that game

[09:59] until, you know, they took it to Expo and obviously got that feedback.

[10:04] So they were kind of stuck with it from, that was my impression.

[10:07] Yeah.

[10:08] And I agree.

[10:09] I heard from, I was talking to them before Expo and they're like, who do you need?

[10:13] Absolutely a playable game.

[10:16] And at that point, I had invested a lot of money in Magic Roy.

[10:19] I purchased the spot.

[10:20] And when I heard that and then I went to Expo and people are like, this game doesn't

[10:26] even work.

[10:27] And then when they got up on stage, they're basically, Boles are basically saying like,

[10:31] we're cutting ties with John.

[10:33] I mean, we're going this direction.

[10:34] He's going that direction.

[10:36] And that's how it's going to go.

[10:37] Did they actually announce that at Expo, I didn't go to their talk.

[10:40] I don't think any talk at Expo.

[10:42] Yeah.

[10:43] That's probably, no, really the excitement that's to be found in that room with like 37

[10:48] individuals, like slouched in their chairs.

[10:50] Like it.

[10:51] Well, I did, I did watch the dialed in reveal on the internet.

[10:55] Yeah.

[10:56] Yeah.

[10:57] And I actually really enjoyed that game.

[10:59] But when they released it, you could just feel the action being sucked out of the room.

[11:03] We'll, we'll talk a little bit about dial in a second because I think that is a machine

[11:07] that has been mislabeled.

[11:11] And there's a lot of prejudice that I think people are going to take back when they actually

[11:14] play it.

[11:15] But so, yeah, what happened in Expo was American Pimball got up there.

[11:20] It was Scott.

[11:21] It was, I think it's Vahal.

[11:23] I can't, I can't, I can't pronounce him as a name wrong.

[11:25] Dauv, no, it's our Dauvall.

[11:26] It's Indian, right?

[11:27] Yeah, it's Dauvall.

[11:28] It was Scott.

[11:29] And then it was Joe Balser.

[11:31] And Balser didn't say like, you know, we're done with John.

[11:34] They all had the sort of line that was, we all know John's really good at certain things

[11:40] and not good at finishing things.

[11:42] So Joe sort of came in as the closer.

[11:45] But it was quite clear.

[11:46] It's really hard to hand another designer a John game and say finish it.

[11:50] You're like, well, why don't you just like start over instead of having to like, you

[11:54] know, do the impossible and make a ball levitate in the hammer.

[11:58] Yeah, I'm not surprised that, you know, John will be involved because I know both John

[12:04] and Joe Balser.

[12:06] I would be hard pressed to think of two more dissimilar individuals.

[12:10] It's like you've got like the consummate, commune artist, artist, and then Joe's kind

[12:15] of like a dock worker.

[12:17] And yeah, yeah.

[12:19] So I really couldn't imagine them working together and apparently that's not happening.

[12:24] So what are you thinking?

[12:26] There you go.

[12:27] What do you think the chances are we'll see Houdini this year knowing that they started

[12:32] over?

[12:33] You think it's supposed to come to T.P.F?

[12:35] Well, so let's analyze that.

[12:39] When we, when it, I think it's coming, but what it, what it will be, I don't know, right?

[12:47] I don't think it's going to be like a playable game.

[12:49] I don't think they're going to show that much of it.

[12:52] I, you know, if they, if they reworked it from scratch, oh god.

[12:56] Did they have enough time?

[12:57] Did they have time to rework it?

[13:02] I suppose if you were working flat out, it might be possible, but I mean, well, for

[13:07] an example, like I started the foam core of my new game in November.

[13:12] Okay.

[13:13] And yeah, there's no way God's green earth.

[13:17] It would be, I mean, it'll be a miracle if we could show it at Expo, let alone Texas.

[13:22] How granted, I'm still not doing this full time and I believe Joe is.

[13:27] I don't know.

[13:28] I mean, they, I kind of doubt they would be able to get something working that fast.

[13:33] I mean, if they do, I'd be quite impressed.

[13:35] But it seems like people are really excited about the theme.

[13:37] Right.

[13:38] Well, what I, what I hope they don't do and I've said many times on this podcast that only

[13:44] spooky and stern do it right in terms of the steps every company should take to succeed,

[13:50] which is you fully design the game first.

[13:53] Yeah, it's the same thing that happens to Kickstarter projects.

[13:58] Design it, announce it, reveal it, ship it, and somewhere in there take money.

[14:04] But well, the thing you have to do is along the along the line, you have to take a hit of,

[14:09] you know, Chuck didn't pay himself very much for the first couple of years and I didn't

[14:14] make a dime off of AMH until it started going out the door.

[14:19] And you know, a new company has to take that hit.

[14:21] Now, you know, Stern didn't really have to because you know, they've been a business since

[14:25] was there was a continuity between old Stern and data east.

[14:29] So let's just say at least, you know, 30 years of the current iteration.

[14:32] So and even then they had like a large corporation, you know, video game company data east,

[14:37] backing them up at the time.

[14:39] So but everyone else has had to go through that hurdle of like, hey, we need money to develop

[14:43] it.

[14:44] We then we need to build it.

[14:45] And what basically what happens is the same thing that happens to kick starters when you're

[14:50] getting the money in order to manufacture something, if that money is used to develop something,

[14:54] then you never get ahead.

[14:55] Right.

[14:56] And yeah, basically Chuck and I just, you know, took a bullet on that one and that's why

[15:03] when America is most on it, I don't know, I might have spent like $5,000 or $6,000 on

[15:07] my own money building that prototype and you know Chuck put in a ton of work making it

[15:12] manufacturable and then we're like, well, here's the game and then nobody wanted it

[15:16] for at least six months.

[15:17] Right.

[15:18] But we stuck it out and then we were able to do it, you know, with a small amount of money

[15:24] and build gradually.

[15:25] That's the plan going forward.

[15:26] I think Chuck is going to announce his next game at TPS, but it probably won't come out

[15:32] until later this year.

[15:34] Okay.

[15:35] And so let's switch gears to spooky.

[15:36] I think the close the chapter on American pinball.

[15:41] I would just recommend and I've said this to Scott.

[15:44] I just wouldn't show anything until it's Scott Goldberg.

[15:47] Yep.

[15:48] Until it's far enough along.

[15:49] I think these companies with the problem is, the problem is and you saw this with AMH.

[15:54] What moved AMH was marketing scarcity.

[15:58] You know, the marketing decision to say we're only making 150 and moved.

[16:01] I mean, that's a marketing tactic and it was a good one and I give Hilton credit for coming

[16:05] up with that.

[16:07] And when these companies show stuff to early.

[16:09] And then, you know, and then I think you drive it down for a year.

[16:16] Yeah, you have that with all the air is a lot of the tire.

[16:21] Yeah.

[16:22] Well, especially Jerry in P3.

[16:24] It's, I don't know, that's the thing.

[16:26] It's like, it's this weird tug of war where you have to show something where people excited,

[16:33] but then there's no surprise left.

[16:34] And if you do everything as a surprise, like the big Lebowski.

[16:38] Well, I mean, I guess that started out well, but.

[16:41] All right.

[16:42] Well, like, but I love your jump, your jump and all over these manufacturers were, let's,

[16:48] okay, let's do this in this order.

[16:50] So like, do you want to talk spooking next?

[16:52] Do you want to talk contract manufacturing?

[16:53] Because then we can jump into Dutch pinball and why we think.

[16:56] Well, do you want to just recap the thing with me and John and the zombie game?

[17:02] Yeah.

[17:03] So in terms of, let me talk about spooking and then move on from there.

[17:06] Yeah.

[17:07] So you join up with John and you're, you're making the zombie game with him.

[17:13] And at what point was his idea?

[17:15] Not mine.

[17:16] And so did you see Matt, Matt Andrews, the artist who drew that amazing picture of you with

[17:22] the glue gun?

[17:23] Like whenever, whenever you would go, I mean, you've heard this story from everyone else.

[17:26] Whenever you'd go to John's shop, it was completely empty except for John.

[17:29] Everything was compartmentalized.

[17:31] Right.

[17:32] And I never, I never saw, I saw like some really early whitewoods of magic girl.

[17:39] That's about it.

[17:40] And that was one of the reasons was remember, John got upset because I was helping out

[17:44] Chuck.

[17:45] But the thing is, I don't, if I don't have a contract, if there was a contract, it would

[17:49] be like, you know, exclusivity, right, a first refusal, non-compete, period of time,

[17:56] damages, but with no contract and none of that applied.

[17:59] So I'm like, well, John, I have no agency in this game that bears my name.

[18:04] And I mentioned that on Pinside.

[18:05] I'm like, you know, I know people are like, hey, Ben's name is on this.

[18:09] So we have faith that I'm like, well, yes, but if I have no control in the product, then

[18:13] there's no point in my name being on it because it's just, you know, just a pay, you know,

[18:18] a really good looking person to be on a back glass.

[18:20] That's not using me to my potential.

[18:22] I mean, during that same time, you know, we took AMH from like a prototype.

[18:27] We basically prototyped it and took it to Midwest Gaming Classic in 14 months.

[18:31] And it was in better condition in 14 months than Magic Girl was after five years.

[18:36] Right.

[18:37] John should have leveraged that Ben Hack and not just a picture of me holding a glue gun.

[18:43] Right, right.

[18:44] Well, as ecotistical as that sounds, I'm sorry.

[18:46] No, that's what he, you know, he was a person on this point.

[18:49] He wants to just get to the art.

[18:51] He wants to get to the icing on these games.

[18:55] He doesn't want to think about like the mechanical and engineering problems that,

[18:59] well, he had entire parts of himself.

[19:01] That's where I met Williams.

[19:02] Yo, totally.

[19:03] Like, he went home at night and said, oh, I want to disappear in Magnum probably in a,

[19:07] in a, and shooting star ball save.

[19:09] And he probably came back and someone made it happen.

[19:12] And he's like, that's exactly what I, you know, that I invented it.

[19:16] Like, I did it.

[19:17] And it's like, he clearly had people doing it for him.

[19:20] All right.

[19:21] So you got out of there.

[19:22] You hooked up with spooky.

[19:24] And then yeah, now we get to spooky.

[19:26] Yeah, let's talk spooky because here's, here's my take on spooky, right?

[19:29] And I, I don't know if you've listened to this podcast frequently, but my take on spooky

[19:33] is you guys did it right.

[19:35] You built credibility.

[19:37] You sort of, you, you have to slowly grow a company.

[19:40] You just, these companies that come out and try to compete with Stern overnight, they fail.

[19:45] They, they, they can't do it.

[19:47] So you guys get AMH out, you get Rob Zombie out.

[19:50] Both titles have sold all of their units.

[19:54] I think Rob Zombie's might have a few left.

[19:56] But I'm not sure some people might have moved money around.

[19:59] But game number three, to me is like a real important game for spooky.

[20:03] And if you guys heard the feedback, I'm sure you have that, you know, people are looking

[20:08] for spooky to just up the game a little bit.

[20:11] What are your thoughts?

[20:12] Like what, in terms of like your ambition for game three and four with, with this company?

[20:17] Well, so we're, I assume we're talking about cornerstone games, not the contract games.

[20:22] I mean, yeah, I mean, I don't want people to look at the Jetsons as like an indication

[20:26] or dominoes as, I mean, I think it shows that you guys can manufacture and that you can

[20:31] pump out Pimball on an even more basic level, but get it out to people who are, who are

[20:38] commissioning that kind of work.

[20:39] Yeah, I mean, that's, that's one thing that we've noticed is the most important thing

[20:43] is just how to keep building games.

[20:46] And I mean, you see that with Stern and two, I mean, Stern just keeps pumping out games

[20:49] and they might not start out as deep as people would like, but the fact is they're continuing

[20:54] to manufacture games.

[20:55] And I think when you wait two or three years between games as other people have done,

[21:00] that's when your company is actually in trouble.

[21:02] So it's actually, it's actually better to you.

[21:04] You got to keep the assembly line moving.

[21:06] This is basic business.

[21:07] Yeah, I don't know, you know, there were some things on Rob Zombie that I think, you know,

[21:13] had I been in charge, I would have done differently.

[21:16] But, you know, Rob Zombie had to be done at a certain point to keep the line working,

[21:21] because again, you know, once you have employees and whatnot, I think it's like 15 full time

[21:26] now at spooky, you've got to keep them working.

[21:29] I mean, cactus Canyon, I mean, you know, the story behind that game, right?

[21:34] It was the last game of the Williams.

[21:36] Yeah, right?

[21:37] Before Pinto Kaye.

[21:38] Right, but one of the reasons the, yeah, the quantity was low.

[21:43] It was like, hey, you know, we've got this last chance to save Pimbal, quote unquote,

[21:47] with Pimbal 2000.

[21:49] So we're going to like just switch over, but we have to keep the line moving for a certain

[21:53] amount of time until that game comes out.

[21:55] And it was like, oh, unionize back then.

[21:57] So, you know, it was like, you have to keep them working.

[21:59] You have to keep our people working.

[22:00] So they're like, okay, well, let's just make as many cactus canyons as we can until Pim

[22:05] 2000 is ready.

[22:06] And then once it was, once it was ready, then they just stop making cactus Canyon.

[22:09] So it's one of the reasons it's, it was basically a filler title.

[22:12] Right.

[22:13] So, yeah, let's talk.

[22:15] So, I guess we can, you know, we can crisscross between like what would you guys are doing?

[22:20] So the line has to keep moving.

[22:22] So you guys have these side projects.

[22:24] And I think people always cut spooky some slack.

[22:28] And they like seeing just more Pimbal go out.

[22:30] I mean, like Jetsons will probably shoot better than my magic rod in the day.

[22:35] You know, so.

[22:36] It has more in it than it appears.

[22:39] I mean, I haven't played it since it was a whitewood, but it's got some stuff.

[22:43] I mean, yeah, it is a bit simplified, but you know, the market for that is rich people's

[22:48] basements, basically.

[22:49] It's like, oh, I'm going to put that next to my foosball table.

[22:51] Right.

[22:52] Well, and it does, you know, it was commissioned for you guys to make and you guys made it.

[22:56] So let's talk about as much as you can about spooky game three, going into the third game.

[23:03] What was sort of like the approach?

[23:05] I mean, you know, you guys had two titles out there and then you guys sit down and say,

[23:08] like, how can we like up our game and what does that mean when we want to sort of improve

[23:14] our product?

[23:15] Well, so I've had nothing to do with Domino's, Jetsons, and then the next game that's coming

[23:23] out, except for, you know, like my code base and stuff.

[23:26] So as far as a thought process with the next game, I can't speak to that.

[23:30] However, I do know that Chuck is going out of his way to make sure that this game has

[23:34] a lot more in it.

[23:36] As you know, as he's mentioned, the price is coming up a little bit because we want to

[23:39] put more things in the game, but we also, you know, don't want to lose money at it.

[23:43] So yeah, he's definitely upping the ante with that.

[23:46] There's a lot more.

[23:47] Who's designing that game?

[23:48] Is it Chuck?

[23:49] Chuck is, yes.

[23:50] Okay.

[23:51] I have to make sure that I don't accidentally say it because in my normal conversations, we

[23:56] just blur it out of the names of all this stuff.

[23:58] Right.

[23:59] Yeah.

[24:00] I'm not sure who the artist is on that either, but it's a licensed title.

[24:05] And as you were correct, I highly doubt Spooky will ever make an unlicensed game again because

[24:11] nobody buys them.

[24:12] Yeah.

[24:15] And this one is going to be 500 of these right at, I think, it's 60 something hundred.

[24:21] Yes.

[24:22] That's the goal, 500 units.

[24:23] And usually that number is baked into the contract.

[24:28] As we saw with Rob Zombie, it love people ask why there weren't more in the contract.

[24:33] It says 300 units.

[24:35] So we, yeah, we're slowly increasing.

[24:38] And then after that title is the one that I'm working on, and that's going to be a few

[24:44] hundred more again.

[24:46] Hopefully.

[24:47] Hopefully we sell that many.

[24:49] And at any point, you know, because you guys are sort of, you have to be looking at where

[24:53] pricing is going around you guys.

[24:56] And that's true.

[24:57] But that could be a trap.

[24:59] Right.

[25:00] What are your thoughts like do you guys feel like at this price point, you guys are comfortable

[25:06] with the profit margin with the revenue to keep the company growing and to keep, and

[25:13] not just growing, but also just like right in advancement R&D and technology and keep improving

[25:18] the product.

[25:19] Right.

[25:20] So I, well, I can't speak to the profit margins and the financials because remember,

[25:26] I'm a 1099 contractor for spooky.

[25:29] Right now I'm working two days a week for them.

[25:32] I adjusted my other schedule because I wanted to spend more time on the pinball stuff.

[25:37] And because it takes a lot of time.

[25:40] But I know one thing that we're definitely looking at is making sure, you know, we're

[25:44] getting on cost reductions like our board set, which is already really cheap.

[25:47] We're going to try to make it even cheaper and better, you know, to keep it competitive.

[25:53] Here's my vague statement there.

[25:56] I mean, like, well, I mean, I'm not going to say the exact number, but I mean, like right

[25:59] now our board cost is like, fuck, like fourth or a fifth of some of the competitors.

[26:06] Right.

[26:07] And I thought you said it.

[26:08] I thought you said the price on pins.

[26:09] I thought I read you.

[26:10] Oh, I might have.

[26:11] I don't know.

[26:12] I mean, okay.

[26:13] But yeah, it's, you know, it's, I'm sure Stern's is less, but ours is pretty good for

[26:19] a boutique.

[26:21] What was the mood like it spooky?

[26:22] Because I know now there's a new policy where there's a point where like the positives aren't

[26:27] a funnel because I think what was happening with Rob Zombie, right?

[26:31] Is when that title was announced, there was a rush to just like get it only 300.

[26:37] And you know, there's just there is that hype in that hysteria, right?

[26:41] And then I think what was happening is like right when people were asked for the final

[26:46] payment, they were just like, oh, let me get a refund.

[26:48] And they'd already like ordered their parts or their games to spec and they were bailing

[26:52] like 11th hour and then Charlie was on the hook to find new buyers.

[26:57] And so now the policy and I think it's smart is to say.

[27:01] It's not refundable, right?

[27:02] Yeah, if you want it, or you have to transfer it.

[27:06] Well, yeah, you got to find a new buyer.

[27:08] I don't know exactly how that works.

[27:10] I think it's not refundable, but you know, but here's the thing, like, and I'm a pinball

[27:15] flipper.

[27:16] I mean, you can know if you if you're in on a game, and you said you'll never sell magic

[27:21] girl.

[27:22] Yeah, right.

[27:23] I won't.

[27:24] I won't.

[27:25] It is the one.

[27:26] Like the only thing that would ever lead me to sell magic girl is if they reproduce or

[27:30] make more, remake them, which I don't think will ever happen.

[27:34] But if someone came along and traded you a big bang bar straight up, you straight up,

[27:38] I mean, I heard today that I would take a big bang arrow magic girl offers.

[27:44] I mean, I heard someone is won't even accept 35k for a magic girl.

[27:49] The people who think it won't hold its value are wrong.

[27:52] I mean, you know, it's just like guy with that zingy bingy white wood.

[27:55] Is he going to give that away or King Kong or well, King pin, I played King pin.

[28:01] King pin is definitely, it feels like a complete game as this big bang bar.

[28:05] Of course, it's going to be worth money.

[28:06] I mean, you saw that with, I don't know, I'm probably stepping on some toes here, but

[28:10] the predator thing, you know, how everyone's like, oh, man, anonymous group, which sounds

[28:15] like one of those guy blocks thing.

[28:16] They ruined it.

[28:18] Thing is, predator would have never worked at 4750.

[28:22] That price wouldn't have worked period and like friends and family helping them build

[28:26] it in the garage.

[28:27] That would have only lasted a month or two.

[28:30] But, you know, he might have got 20 or 30 out the door and those early people that would

[28:35] have gotten one of those 20 or 30, they were just like, oh, and it was, I missed out on

[28:39] getting a really rare pin.

[28:40] But, that's all about rare.

[28:43] It's all about rare.

[28:44] It's, yeah.

[28:45] You know, I put up a, when I was still on pin side, I put up a thread.

[28:48] I don't know if you remember it.

[28:49] It was one of the most down-voted threads in the history of pin side.

[28:52] It asks, isn't it?

[28:54] I just asked how much do you think the prototypes for magic girl and predator would be worth

[29:00] if a few of them were, you know, got out into the hands of collectors?

[29:06] Look, I think you could look at even the 25 magic girls as being just 25 prototype versions

[29:11] of this game.

[29:12] I mean, this thing is not like mass produced.

[29:14] Oh, yeah.

[29:15] Back in the 90s, they made far more than 25 prototypes of a game.

[29:18] What was the rule?

[29:19] 18 games, 18 locations, 18 weeks.

[29:23] Right.

[29:24] It's how they test things.

[29:25] Yeah.

[29:26] Like, magic girl, it was a gamble on my part.

[29:27] But when you read people thinking like, they're always like, I wouldn't pay anything for

[29:31] that game.

[29:32] It's like, it doesn't matter what you'd pay.

[29:33] We all know that this hobby has collectors with deep pockets and all you need is two

[29:38] rich guys and only one game up for sale and watch that price go through the roof.

[29:43] So, but like pinball, I brought up that stadium events game on a topic.

[29:48] Yeah.

[29:49] I'm in Nintendo game.

[29:50] They think sells for like 50 grand and plus.

[29:52] It's the same damn game as world class track me that came bundled.

[29:56] It's just in a different box.

[29:58] Right.

[29:59] And it's worth 50k.

[30:00] Right.

[30:01] It doesn't, none of it makes sense.

[30:02] No, it's, it's, it's, you know, if people want to spend the money on the good for them,

[30:06] it's, it's bragging rights amongst the collectors.

[30:08] And that is what drives collectors.

[30:10] Like, if every single Ferrari was worth the same money, no one cares.

[30:14] But this one was in like Le Mans and one and all of a sudden, it's worth like a hundred

[30:19] times more than the same car that didn't race in Le Mans.

[30:23] And, and that's just the way it goes.

[30:25] So, let me ask you a question, Ben, because we're still on spooky.

[30:28] Is that the current topic?

[30:29] Yeah, we're talking spooky.

[30:30] We're talking like pricing and we're talking, you know, limited, limited numbers.

[30:37] Do you guys ever feel though, because you were successful in driving 150 AMH's out the

[30:43] door?

[30:44] We heard, but that was, that was a fight for inches.

[30:47] It was amazing.

[30:48] So, my point is this, Rob Zombie, then 300, it's, it's a licensed theme and has obviously

[30:53] more broad appeal.

[30:56] Those sell out.

[30:57] Do you guys ever get nervous?

[30:58] And I've said this on the podcast before that.

[31:01] I'm not that something that's something that you guys might make too more.

[31:05] You have too many of a title.

[31:06] If you underestimate demand on something that you'll lose.

[31:12] Billion dollar companies, like Billion Dollar Company is like Nintendo do that with that

[31:15] Ness classic.

[31:16] Well, I guess the question is like, why, why, why, why make more than like three to five

[31:24] hundred ever?

[31:25] Is it?

[31:26] Well, there are reasons to do that.

[31:30] And I've kind of noticed that with us.

[31:32] I think we're better at building games than designing enough of them.

[31:37] Because you run into the John problem where, you know, John would have done, if John would

[31:42] have sold like 300 magic girls, you know, he probably could have been a success, but

[31:47] he decided to make three different games at once.

[31:49] And you're never going to amortize those costs with three different games.

[31:53] So I think there, I honestly, I think spooky should be shooting for like 500 plus units

[31:59] on every title because otherwise the, because that's the thing.

[32:03] Like it cost about well, maybe not with Jetsons, but it costs, you know, the same amount of time

[32:10] that I've held any game.

[32:11] So you might as well make as many of them as you can.

[32:13] Like even things like Congo, they made a few thousand units, which is, you know, actually

[32:17] a pretty cool game.

[32:18] Right.

[32:19] Yeah.

[32:20] I'm hoping that we can do titles that can sell more, well, that's an obvious statement.

[32:25] You know, instead of like spending all the time, it takes to do like 300 of Rob Zombie, you

[32:30] know, bump up to five or 600 and have a title that we can, you know, basically still hopefully

[32:37] hit those numbers.

[32:38] But then, you know, instead of, yeah, well, think about it.

[32:40] Instead of developing two games and selling 300 of each, you develop one game and sell 600.

[32:46] That saves you money and time.

[32:47] I think the battle that spooky faces is scarcity versus quality.

[32:54] And I say that not to say that the games are like low in quality, but the complexity of

[32:59] the game, right?

[33:00] If spooky, it's less complex than competitors.

[33:03] But then again, you have like alien, which is like really over engineered.

[33:07] Right.

[33:08] So what are you going to do?

[33:09] But then you look back to the 80s.

[33:10] I always think about the ZX Spectrum or the ZX Spectrum since we're talking about highway

[33:16] pinball, you know, because England.

[33:18] Uh, yeah, I mean, that was one of the most popular computers back in the 80s.

[33:21] And it was just that cut every corner and it sold.

[33:26] Right.

[33:27] Let's talk it.

[33:28] Let's, let's, there's something to that.

[33:29] I mean, you can put, I like, look, look at Big Lebowski.

[33:32] I mean, it was $8,000 and it became $10,000, which means $8,000.

[33:35] They obviously aim to low with their estimates.

[33:39] Um, that's the reverse of the problem.

[33:42] That's not really the best defense.

[33:43] I am the game that I'm working on.

[33:47] Uh, it, it, it may have to actually get costed down because I'm putting a lot of stuff

[33:53] into it, but I'm going to make the things really cool.

[33:56] I've been working really hard on making good.

[33:58] But why not just charge more for it?

[34:01] You know, I, I even, I'll say this, I was even disappointed when Charlie went back and

[34:08] was like, we're going to throw more stuff into Jetsons without raising the price.

[34:11] And it's just like, here's the thing.

[34:13] Pinside is the worst place to go for a focus group on your pricing.

[34:18] They, it's like, they price everything down.

[34:21] And it's like, they'll patch you on the back all the way into the bankruptcy stage of

[34:25] a company that, hey, good job, guys, everyone.

[34:28] Yeah, five grand.

[34:29] Everything should be back to stern prices, like it was in like 2006.

[34:33] Good job.

[34:34] And then you're, you mean back when, yeah, that's the thing.

[34:36] Stern was selling games for 3,800 and they were really struggling.

[34:40] The Dutch, Dutch pinball, Dutch pinball should have charged 12,000 for every libouski.

[34:46] If you put libouski next to Batman, Ellie or super Ellie, it, it looks twice as expensive

[34:52] and it's twice as much going on.

[34:54] And yet, and yet like they, they just priced it in a way that clearly, clearly they can't

[35:00] afford to even keep the company going right now.

[35:03] Do you think they could have gotten 12 dollars?

[35:06] Yes.

[35:07] They said, if they said on day one, which I hear now, we're only going to make 300 big

[35:12] libouskies and they're going to be 12,000 each sold out sold out.

[35:17] So there's a waiting list.

[35:19] There's a waiting list now to get someone's spot and their and the company is publicly

[35:24] saying we came in a Ford to pay the people who are making it and people still are right are

[35:29] waiting online to jump in and get a spot.

[35:32] Really?

[35:33] I find that a little hard to believe.

[35:35] Yeah.

[35:36] So, look, let's talk, let's talk Dutch for a second.

[35:39] So they're contract manufacturing and I always say this, George Gomez said because that

[35:44] they're never going to really make it, they're going to become like, they're going to be

[35:48] slaves to the company manufacturing them and anything goes wrong that it's not in your

[35:52] control.

[35:53] What are your thoughts on like how they're trying to make pinball?

[35:55] Clearly, it's not going well.

[35:58] It, well on paper, contract manufacturing sounds, does sound cool.

[36:02] I mean, I've experienced things firsthand.

[36:05] I do projects for lots of different companies actually.

[36:09] I mean, it's not, you know, people don't really know about it.

[36:12] It's kind of boring stuff.

[36:14] And there is, I was just thinking about this the other day because it's a company I've

[36:18] done a lot of orders for and they always order this really weird thing that I have to see

[36:22] and see out and they couldn't get anyone else to do it.

[36:26] And it's kind of a pain in the butt.

[36:27] It takes a lot of set of time.

[36:28] It's one of those things where they're like, oh god, they ordered this again.

[36:32] It's like, so I had to go in on the weekend because it makes too much noise.

[36:35] I can't do it when we're filming.

[36:37] And then it takes like an hour of setup and then I make like machine time on it, which

[36:41] is like $100 an hour or something.

[36:43] And I'm like, you know, this is even really worth my time.

[36:46] And that's actually how a lot of manufacturers feel.

[36:49] I noticed that like 10 years ago, like, well, whenever it was when I first started working

[36:54] on my own, I was always looking around for places that had like laser cutters or CNC machines

[36:59] and they never wanted to do anything with me.

[37:01] And then he wants to do a one off.

[37:02] Like if you're a contract manufacturer and you would rather make 10,000 boring things

[37:09] than 100 interesting things because you wanted to set it up, push the button and go.

[37:15] And yeah, I think that's probably the challenge they're facing.

[37:18] And so you think like ARA is like, yes, we agreed to at this price, but the actual complexity

[37:25] is in troubles of making these complex pinball machines has raised our cost to get you

[37:31] the product.

[37:32] So now they're going to cost a thousand, it was something like a thousand euro more

[37:35] they were saying they wanted to be, they needed to get the games out.

[37:39] Just from my take would be that, yes, the cost and complexity of manufacturing the games

[37:47] probably exceeded the contract manufacturer's original estimates if I had to guess.

[37:52] But here's what I don't get.

[37:53] Here's what I don't get.

[37:55] Instead of that company going radio silent on everybody, lying about it being like a board

[38:00] issue which we know wasn't the case.

[38:03] Why do I get it could have been?

[38:05] I mean, they're both very unique.

[38:08] But they came out and said like the real issue is that we just we owe these guys money

[38:13] and they're holding on to finish games.

[38:16] But here's the thing, here's what I don't get about this whole hobby.

[38:19] And I said this in I think I don't know, I think it's on my podcast.

[38:23] When the Nissan GTR, I'm going to do a car you meant when it came out, it was originally

[38:27] $67,000.

[38:28] The same car today because of cost of parts, manufacturing, increasing in prices, material

[38:34] costs going up, it is now $127,000 a car.

[38:39] Why didn't Dutch just say like, look, we quoted people at $8,500 or $10,000.

[38:45] Now that we're in the middle of production, the reality is it costs more than we anticipated

[38:51] and it's going to be an additional $1,000 or $1,500.

[38:55] And that's the price.

[38:56] We'll refund your money if you don't want it.

[38:58] But that's the price moving forward and that's the price we need to stay in business.

[39:02] And instead of doing that, these guys are now like in a lawsuit battling with the Dan

[39:06] Manufacturing Company looking for another home.

[39:10] It sounds like it's going to be a disaster.

[39:14] I would agree that I think, well, I mean, it's kind of suck to say, hey, we need more money.

[39:20] But that might have been, I don't know, that might have been a more straightforward solution

[39:24] because the other, it's the truth.

[39:28] It's the truth.

[39:29] Yeah, I know.

[39:30] I know.

[39:31] I try not to say too much about other companies, but I definitely think that's a very sticky

[39:34] situation and I am kind of concerned for those involved because they'll waste X amount

[39:41] of time fighting with ARA and then they'll spend X amount of time trying to find a new

[39:46] company and that company will spend X amount of time spilling things up.

[39:50] And also it's in Europe, it's a more expensive place just to do anything.

[39:55] Right.

[39:56] Yeah, they, their problem is ARA is holding the finished games hostage.

[40:01] It sounds like until they get paid.

[40:04] So there's like, apparently there's like 50 games made.

[40:06] One of them is rare heroes just sitting there and they're holding them as like collateral.

[40:15] I mean, I guess all I can say is that I'm glad that you're not.

[40:19] We're not in that sense.

[40:21] Yeah, that's a tough situation.

[40:23] I mean, yeah, but if you think about it, they built a game first and they brought it in.

[40:28] It was a surprise and it was fresh and blew everyone away and they've come across challenges

[40:32] as well.

[40:33] I think it just illustrates how difficult it can be.

[40:35] I mean, you know, it's Pimple Machine, it has all the problems of licensing and creative

[40:41] and manufacturing.

[40:42] It's a very complex product and it is tough.

[40:46] What do you guys, Ben, what's your thoughts and your colleagues over at Spooky Being?

[40:50] Like the only real boutique that is sort of navigated this properly?

[40:55] You guys must have just feel like the last few years has been this failed promise of boutique

[41:01] Pimple by everybody else.

[41:03] Yeah, I keep worrying that it's going to crash everything, but it hasn't yet.

[41:08] And I agree it hasn't yet, but I feel like this year is going to either regain momentum,

[41:16] right?

[41:17] Or people are, there's a lot of angry people, right?

[41:19] A lot of people who feel their money has been frozen for years.

[41:24] They've lost money.

[41:27] You talk about all the time, the money evaporates for a lot of people.

[41:30] Yeah, exactly.

[41:31] I mean, I think a lot of the ammonocity, animosity online and Pinside is because a lot of people

[41:39] have been burned and they have very strong feelings and they're kind of lashing out and,

[41:44] you know, forming camps.

[41:46] And I think, yeah, a lot of it is because of these pre-orders have affected a lot of people.

[41:52] And I think that's, that's where a lot of the anger is coming from.

[41:54] I mean, we look at like the housing crash we had here in America financially and then

[42:01] that created political strife.

[42:03] And you know, it affects people in more ways than just financial.

[42:06] You know, it makes them lash out and makes them upset.

[42:08] It makes them blame certain.

[42:09] I'm sure.

[42:10] For a lot of these guys, it's not even the hit to their wallet.

[42:14] It's the hit to their dreams and their emotions and, you know, the sleepless nights, you

[42:20] know, these guys, and I love Pimbal collectors and these guys, they get emotionally invested

[42:27] in these products.

[42:28] Well, yeah.

[42:29] And even if they've been doing...

[42:30] Just like your health cat.

[42:32] Yeah, I mean, like, I'll tell you, like, I only suffered for five months, but the magic

[42:37] girl, wait, and I've never really fully revealed all the behind the scenes work I was doing

[42:44] to try and, you know, help that thing come out.

[42:47] Obviously, I'm not an engineer.

[42:49] I couldn't build it, but there's a lot of like legal stuff and a lot of other issues that

[42:54] like I jumped in face first.

[42:56] Once I thought I was going to lose my money, I was like, I was involved.

[42:58] Like, I was talking to all parties involved, frequent and daily.

[43:01] Yeah, I kind of figured you were.

[43:04] I just got that impression.

[43:05] Well, and it wasn't fun, you know, it wasn't because like one day is good news.

[43:09] The next day is like, I'm, you know, we're going to shut it all down.

[43:11] You know, it was like one of these just roller coaster rides that you have a lot of sleep

[43:17] less nights.

[43:18] And for many guys out there, those feelings have lingered on for years.

[43:24] Let's talk about another...

[43:25] I will say one thing.

[43:27] The pinball community has a patience of Job.

[43:31] Because, um, example, my previous camera person, Allison, she likes bikes, you know, with

[43:39] the pedals, not a motorcycle.

[43:42] And she was all excited.

[43:43] She'd ordered this custom handmade bike from some guy who was like really good at making

[43:48] custom handmade bikes.

[43:50] And he kept saying, oh yeah, we're making it.

[43:52] We're making it.

[43:53] It's coming.

[43:54] It's coming.

[43:55] And I think she waited like five or six months and then she was, you know, getting kind

[43:58] of sad about it.

[44:00] And then she's like, oh, I emailed him and he said it's in the spray booth.

[44:02] But then I asked for a refund and he made it immediately, immediately gave it to me.

[44:05] And I'm like, well, that means your bike wasn't in the spray booth.

[44:07] You know, it was it at all.

[44:09] But then the thing is, you know, after like five or six months, she's like, screw it.

[44:13] And then she just canceled the order and got something else.

[44:16] It's like, I told, I told even back, I think this is probably like 2013.

[44:19] I'm like, wow, you would never make it in the pinball preorder world.

[44:22] And then going back to like the Lebowski price, um, people always want more for less.

[44:28] I mean, that's kind of the tragic nature of modern consumerism.

[44:33] You see that you're in the video games, right?

[44:35] Yeah.

[44:36] I mean, think about it.

[44:37] They're on YouTube.

[44:38] Everyone that ditches and mones about $60 games and they then they want DLC.

[44:44] And these are people who don't have inflation calculator or org open.

[44:48] Right.

[44:49] And they don't they don't remember that you they used to charge, you know, they would

[44:53] make, they would spend a million dollars making Mega Man 2.

[44:57] And they charged you 50 bucks for it.

[44:59] And now they spend a hundred million dollars making battlefield.

[45:02] And they charge you $60 for it.

[45:05] Right.

[45:06] And what do they think about it?

[45:07] Like the economies of scale has caused, you know, the budgets go through the roof and the

[45:10] price has barely increased, but people still bitch.

[45:14] And I think that's kind of the thing, you know, that there's like a frog boiling point

[45:17] with price like with pinballs, like 10 K video games at 60 K.

[45:22] One fun thing you can do, go to inflation calculator, uh, dot gov or whatever, type in $50

[45:28] in 1990, like for Super Mario 3.

[45:30] Yeah, you're old enough to remember that.

[45:32] Right.

[45:33] That same game now would cost $90, which is $60 game plus $30 DLC $90.

[45:40] Oh, yeah.

[45:41] Spearcy.

[45:42] Well, people forget too, like the original NES was 200 bucks.

[45:46] Yeah.

[45:47] And they're like, well, sorry, it was like what, 250, which would be like $700 now or

[45:52] compute.

[45:53] Even Christ, they cost a fortune.

[45:54] Right.

[45:55] Okay.

[45:56] Well, it's so hard, it's so hard with pinball pricing because, you know, every time you

[46:00] think we've sort of figured it out or we've reached the ceiling, Stern goes and puts

[46:05] $5 or matchbox toys on a Batman and charges $5,000 more and everyone says take my money.

[46:13] So it's like, well, it's all about that, you know, the exclusive exclusivity, uh, special

[46:17] episode number with Batman.

[46:19] Uh, well, I will say one thing, the one thing that we do at spooky is we design the game,

[46:25] we cost it out and then we announce a price.

[46:28] Right.

[46:29] We do it.

[46:30] All numbers out of our butt.

[46:32] Well, and then, but then what you guys can do when you reach that point is, you know, I

[46:36] don't think you guys are as shrewd as you could be considering the collector market, which

[46:43] is like, oh, no, no, no, no.

[46:45] You're leaving.

[46:46] You guys are leaving money on the table.

[46:48] I'll just be honest.

[46:49] Like you're, you're leaving, but we leave that money on the table and by doing that, we

[46:53] buy goodwill.

[46:54] Oh, deep thoughts.

[46:55] Yeah.

[46:56] And look, but that's, that's the, I mean, that, but that's just the, that's the, I mean,

[46:59] that's just the part where like, Stern does, doesn't really do much to do goodwill and

[47:04] then they just keep selling out, selling out, selling out.

[47:07] So there's good.

[47:08] I think, you know, there will be a point where when you, and like, I don't think spooky's

[47:13] have like,

[47:14] Stern is still, Stern is still very friendly and nice to us.

[47:18] So I'll never, I've never come at that Stern because so, you know, thus far we're, uh, well,

[47:23] you know, look, we, we're, we're as big as, you know, well, they're big.

[47:26] But they're, look, it's great that both you guys are, I think are the only like two companies

[47:31] that have like done it right recently.

[47:33] But the thing is, Stern, Stern locks it down with the license, like the Gary understands,

[47:37] like I could make a shit sandwich and make it Batman 66 and like, these guys are going

[47:42] to like, like all, are perfect.

[47:44] Well, going, going back to dialed in, I mean, license is all that matters, all caps period.

[47:50] How do you think that game's going to sell?

[47:52] Which one dialed in?

[47:53] Uh, probably not super great overall, especially if, you know, his next game is, while his

[48:02] next game is a license.

[48:03] Um, I think they'll probably hold that one back a little bit just so they can sell more

[48:07] dialed in.

[48:08] I thought dialed in was really great.

[48:10] I think it's a phenomenal game.

[48:11] I think it's one of the best shooting games I've played and it, I think it is a world

[48:17] under glass.

[48:18] I just don't know why they like and dialed in.

[48:22] You know, do you think they made a mistake?

[48:24] Because Jack was like, well, we're going to do here.

[48:26] I'll, I'll, I'll lose some points in the community.

[48:28] Like, if that woman with the wrench in the corner was in a bikini, no one would complain

[48:33] about it.

[48:34] Right.

[48:35] If the, if the, um, if it was called sim city, no one would complain about it.

[48:39] Like, yeah, I don't know.

[48:41] I just, as someone who struggled making an original theme, I completely understand.

[48:46] Uh, I have a lot of empathy for, uh, uh, well, our, and some, I think we're dialed

[48:52] in.

[48:53] Like, so the theme obviously is original.

[48:55] It's, it's funny too, because everyone in pinball is always like the name sucks, though.

[49:00] I won't tell you.

[49:01] Yeah.

[49:02] Like, if they just call it like quantum city, which people said is a better title.

[49:06] And, yeah.

[49:07] No.

[49:08] I, I would call it disaster city.

[49:09] Quantum doesn't tell you anything.

[49:11] Right.

[49:12] Okay.

[49:13] So disaster city.

[49:14] I, you know, I think disaster, disaster opalists or to zoot open.

[49:20] Something, right?

[49:21] Something catchy.

[49:22] And then I think the artwork is the big problem I have with the pen right now.

[49:25] I mean, other than the name and the theme, I just only, the art is great.

[49:29] Like, it's got this nerdy guy with his like shirt tucked in new as jeans holding up a cell

[49:34] phone.

[49:35] It's like, and he looks, and he looks just like Captain America.

[49:37] Yeah.

[49:38] It's just, it's just bad.

[49:39] And, uh, you know, I, I don't, I don't have any issues with that.

[49:44] I think, you know, you know what makes the art look bad?

[49:46] That big word dialed in.

[49:48] Yeah.

[49:49] That's true.

[49:50] It's true.

[49:51] It's like, I think a lot of awesome things in that game.

[49:54] I love the game.

[49:56] I love the game.

[49:57] I, I, I think it's going to be one of these games that doesn't sell that many.

[50:00] It can, to me, it feels like it could be like 20 years from now, like a cactus canyon.

[50:05] Yeah.

[50:06] We're like, nobody appreciated it that much, but it's actually like kind of incredible.

[50:10] Well, I think, you know, if I, if I just had to imagine what happened, Jack probably

[50:15] said, uh, I'll do anything.

[50:18] He's worked for us, Pat Loller and Pat Loller was like, okay, but only if I can make

[50:23] whatever game I want with complete control.

[50:25] And the Jack was like anything.

[50:27] Right.

[50:28] And we got this.

[50:29] And then, yeah, I mean, at first, at first glance, it was like, oh, God, it's like a 60

[50:32] year old man trying to make what looks cool.

[50:34] But then you realize, hey, this is actually, well, also the voice, the voices are terrible.

[50:39] I think they're fixing that.

[50:40] I think it was just the programmers and the workers that did the voice.

[50:44] Um, but, uh, what I like, what I love about it.

[50:46] I mean, like, we've talked about what we don't like about it.

[50:49] It shoots great.

[50:50] There's a lot going on.

[50:52] There's a lot of fun toys.

[50:53] It does a great flow.

[50:54] I also think the, the LCD for the first time is, is the way Jack needs to integrate it

[50:59] words.

[51:00] A very simple, big animated image on there versus like, like the hobbit that's like displaying

[51:07] 15 things at once at me.

[51:08] And I'm like, I don't even know like what fucking Arkinstone.

[51:11] Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's actually, you know, the super, super deep detailed

[51:16] rules of the hobbit, I think it actually works against it because it's just, it's just

[51:19] overlord over, overlord overload.

[51:22] You don't really know necessarily what's going on.

[51:23] But I loved the presentation of dialed in because you think about it.

[51:27] There's no movie to draw clips from.

[51:29] So what do you fill the screen with?

[51:31] And their choice was to have like a city, like simulated city.

[51:34] And then you see things happen.

[51:36] And then I love like the CNN newsfeed at the bottom.

[51:39] Right.

[51:40] It's got like the main goals.

[51:41] And then they've got like a ticker of like all like the BS stories.

[51:43] And I just thought that presentation was great.

[51:45] It's like, wow, this is a really smart way to fill the screen with content when you don't

[51:48] have a movie to rely on.

[51:49] Right.

[51:50] And like, did you know, did you see where a drone would like drop a package off the main

[51:54] screen and then it would appear on the LCD in the center shot?

[51:57] It's super cool.

[51:59] It's super cool.

[52:00] Although I think a lot of people thought it was too easy though.

[52:04] That was one that came up.

[52:06] Oh God forbid.

[52:07] Like pinball.

[52:08] Here's the thing.

[52:10] When, when you say a lot of people think it's too easy, those are like the tournament

[52:14] players, which I will every time I think about the complaints these guys have, it's the

[52:21] average pinball player is not that good.

[52:23] They like having decent ball times.

[52:26] These tournament players are like, it sucks.

[52:28] One ball half hour.

[52:31] You know, great.

[52:32] I get everyone wants the Lord of the Rings.

[52:35] Yeah.

[52:36] That means like a novice player like myself, which I think makes up like the majority of

[52:41] pinball players.

[52:42] You know, Lord of the Rings ball times for me were never 30 minutes of ball.

[52:47] Yeah.

[52:48] But these, you know, so if these guys want a tough game, go play Ghostbusters.

[52:53] That's what it was designed for.

[52:55] You got your tough game.

[52:56] It drains every like 30 seconds.

[52:58] I was watching some YouTube videos and I really enjoyed playing Battlefield 1.

[53:04] And a lot of these YouTube people are like, oh, it's too easy.

[53:06] There's too many explosions.

[53:07] Just not as hardcore as the last couple games.

[53:10] And I'm like, yeah, and that's why I like it more because I play video games to have fun.

[53:14] I don't play it to like, oh, I'm going to kill all new moves.

[53:17] I'm to best.

[53:18] Right.

[53:19] Well, that's what I think pinball should be like that too.

[53:22] Make the game.

[53:23] My philosophy would be make it make the geometry accessible and then make the rules deep.

[53:31] So it's that's what I want to go for.

[53:33] Right.

[53:34] Well, what do you, let's, let's change gears to Alien because Alien one and two have

[53:39] shipped and we just saw some gameplay video.

[53:42] Not sure if you had a chance to check it out, but what are your thoughts on highway and

[53:46] and and do you think we're going to see aliens go out in numbers anytime soon?

[53:51] You think they still got some a period of like beta testing with these first ones going

[53:54] out?

[53:55] I don't know.

[53:56] I mean, did they sell a lot of them?

[53:59] I don't know.

[54:00] I mean, the the L.E.'s haven't sold out and I believe there were 500 L.E.'s offered initially.

[54:06] And I I've always said like I think it didn't sell out because of the artwork like the

[54:11] alien theme is is so freaking strong that if Stern released an alien L.E. it would sell

[54:17] out like in a day like site unseen.

[54:20] So I remember they have to deal with licensing.

[54:24] I mean, that's a big part of it.

[54:27] Yeah.

[54:28] But look, I think Andrew, I think like no, you can't cover it with Geeger work.

[54:31] It has to be.

[54:32] I think Andrew made a lot of innovations unnecessarily that made it harder for him versus

[54:40] easier for him to sell his product and by that, I mean, you changed the cabinet.

[54:46] You change everything was designed around the swappable play field model.

[54:50] Nobody wants that.

[54:51] Nobody wants it.

[54:52] So you build your whole company around something nobody wants and then what that does is

[54:56] is engineering is fantastic, but that's not what the collectors want.

[55:01] And like everyone who buys an alien, they want like a dedicated alien machine.

[55:05] Even guys are saying like maybe I'll swap it into like a traditional cabinet and have

[55:09] like artwork.

[55:11] You know, people want artwork to fill the whole space.

[55:13] They don't want it to just be like a cut out section.

[55:17] But they've had trouble and I know that they've, you know, to your point, Ben about you

[55:21] got to keep the assembly line moving.

[55:24] And every time I see their big factory, there's like nobody working.

[55:30] This is huge factory and every day it's got to be harder and harder.

[55:35] So I think the next few months, well, I think it's great that they've started shipping

[55:38] them.

[55:39] I'm sure I wonder when Hilton's going to get his because I think he got his today.

[55:44] I think it went out.

[55:45] Really?

[55:46] I think he got his today.

[55:47] I may be making this up, but his either went out because I think he got number two.

[55:52] So it either arrived today because I saw him tracking it.

[55:56] Yeah.

[55:57] I think you said he was getting air frayed.

[56:00] So yeah, so like, let's see what happens.

[56:03] It's, look, I, I just, I, it lives like five blocks north of me.

[56:08] So I sound a big giant.

[56:09] Go check it out.

[56:10] From what I've seen in the gameplay, the light shows phenomenal.

[56:13] The music is great.

[56:15] It's a little bit of a drain monster on the sides.

[56:17] The ball just seems to just like love to go into the out lanes to the point where they

[56:21] actually put a post in the in between the flippers.

[56:24] And it's not like there's a flipper gap.

[56:26] So they sort of even did out a little bit by trying to make center drains less likely.

[56:31] Okay.

[56:32] But I think people like we were talking like when you show a game so early, or do you announce

[56:37] a game years before it ships?

[56:39] It's just hard to get that excitement and that hype back.

[56:42] Well, I think Andrew had the same challenge that we did where he started with an unlicensed

[56:46] title that frankly people weren't that interested in.

[56:50] And he had to fight tooth and nail to sell it.

[56:52] And I, I'm just going to assume that he hasn't sold as many of full throttle as we did

[56:56] at AMH.

[56:57] So, you know, it was a challenge.

[57:00] He basically had to like crawl across the finish line in order to get a license title out.

[57:05] And it's weird.

[57:06] It's, what's the thing is like you can only get credit if you bought a bunch of things,

[57:12] but you can't buy a bunch of things unless you have credit.

[57:15] You know, like one of those like catch 22 things.

[57:16] And I think that's what happens.

[57:18] You either start with the license and it's tough starting with all the license and I

[57:23] just think he's had that same challenge.

[57:25] I mean, look at Predator.

[57:26] I mean, I've made no bones about it.

[57:28] Predator was never a good game.

[57:29] It was terrible.

[57:30] I don't know why people even were interested in it, but it had the word, well, because it

[57:33] had the word Predator across it.

[57:35] And then full throttle, especially in America, no one cares about, you know, no one cares

[57:39] about motorcycles unless they're Harleys.

[57:41] So, it's a tough sell for this market.

[57:44] Why start then with an unlicensed, I mean, is it money because when you're starting

[57:48] a company like highway, oh yeah, it's definitely less money.

[57:53] Sure.

[57:54] You know, it's less money, but you got to imagine like that's the period though where,

[57:58] you know, he has investors and you kind of want to show your investors that what they're

[58:04] investing in is working.

[58:07] Well, it's also, you know, when you work with licenses, you're also have to, you know,

[58:11] prove you're going in concern.

[58:13] I mean, we've seen that.

[58:14] It's like, you know, asking a girl out and the first thing she does is Google you, you

[58:19] know, same thing is like, oh, hmm, okay.

[58:21] You want this license, huh?

[58:22] Well, we're going to do some research on your company and then we'll get back to you.

[58:26] So, you know, even if all we made was like a ghost game with non-professional voice actors,

[58:31] at least it's a game we made and, or, but then it's like, okay, that got us to Rob Zombie

[58:36] and then Rob Zombie.

[58:37] Obviously, if you were like, oh, we made a Rob Zombie game, then, you know, then, well,

[58:41] so then we'll make this game.

[58:43] So, I think that was screwed in eyes when it comes to licensing and merchandising, that

[58:47] much considering the low volume of the product.

[58:51] Well, they went to Fox for game one.

[58:56] Oh, I'm sure companies don't give a fly and fuck about it.

[58:59] I mean, it's so small in the grand scheme of things.

[59:02] I know, well, I mean, it's, yeah.

[59:05] I remember once I was meeting with one of the senior level marketing guys at WWE right

[59:13] around when the pinball machine came out and I was like, I'm like, how excited are

[59:18] you for the pinball machine?

[59:19] He's like, well, he's like, what are you talking about?

[59:21] You didn't even know.

[59:22] Well, the rumor is that started as Hunger Games.

[59:26] Oh, really?

[59:27] And that was like the, the, the, the core, cornucopia up there?

[59:33] Or some, I've never seen the movie, but yeah, it was, yeah, some sort of battle area.

[59:37] But then maybe they realized that a bunch of 50-year-old men aren't interested in Hunger

[59:40] Games.

[59:41] I don't know.

[59:42] I heard it started out as a different game and then got kind of turned into WWE.

[59:47] That just seems like someone's excuse when everyone feels like WWE sucks.

[59:51] Well, yeah, because it started out as like, you know, the firm.

[59:56] Well, that's, that's the gladiators game started out as Legend of Zelda.

[01:00:01] I mean, that's, and the movie Die Hard started out as Commando too.

[01:00:06] You know, I wish someone would like, wise up and make a pinball machine based on like

[01:00:13] video game property again.

[01:00:15] If someone did like Mario or Zelda or record Ralph, it would just rake in the cash.

[01:00:19] Yeah, like why, why?

[01:00:20] It is a lot of company like Nintendo.

[01:00:24] They don't, you know, pinball is like a, a flea on the ass of the Titanic to them.

[01:00:31] Oh, I know.

[01:00:32] Look at me, look at how many of those new like classic NES, like emulators, those little

[01:00:38] ones are selling.

[01:00:40] And it's like basically to USB stick inside of a, like a little NES.

[01:00:45] We did a tear down of that just earlier this week.

[01:00:48] Yeah, it's a $60, $20 TV game system.

[01:00:51] Nintendo made money handover fist on that.

[01:00:53] I don't know why they didn't make more of them.

[01:00:55] I think it's, I think it was an internal political conflict at their company actually.

[01:00:59] But that's my excuse.

[01:01:00] Are they still making them?

[01:01:01] Apparently they've stopped and they only like 190,000 were sold or shipped to America.

[01:01:07] Isn't that insane?

[01:01:09] You know, it's crazy.

[01:01:10] I'm hesitant to admit this, but I went to Ireland over the holidays and I didn't have

[01:01:17] a gift for Brenda's brother.

[01:01:20] And I walk into this like electronic store in Galway and there are like three of these

[01:01:25] things.

[01:01:26] And I'm like, oh my god, like this thing's like impossible to get.

[01:01:29] And they're like, yeah, like I'm like, how much is it?

[01:01:31] They're like $160,000.

[01:01:32] I'm like, oh, take it.

[01:01:33] Like that sounds like a bargain.

[01:01:34] And that's like, I can't lie.

[01:01:35] I'm like, wait a minute, this thing's only like $50.

[01:01:38] Like, shit.

[01:01:39] Well, Nintendo was never as big in Europe as it was over here.

[01:01:46] That might be one of the reasons.

[01:01:47] Like four times what they sell for.

[01:01:49] Well, at least you're able to find one.

[01:01:51] Well, you know what?

[01:01:52] You can't put a price on happiness.

[01:01:53] Ben, you are.

[01:01:54] They were big.

[01:01:55] That's my approach.

[01:01:56] They're big and the, you know, the computers and the master system over there.

[01:02:00] Any other closing thoughts or what we're going to ask?

[01:02:03] Yeah, I'm just going to say like, you know, like I agree, like video game properties would

[01:02:08] be gangbusters.

[01:02:09] What are your thoughts on P3 now that it seems like it's finally coming out?

[01:02:14] Do you think there's going to be the interest there?

[01:02:16] It's T3 is a very promising system.

[01:02:19] Jerry just needs a good license to stick on it.

[01:02:21] I know I've said this a million times.

[01:02:23] And that's the same challenge that I've just been talking about.

[01:02:26] Like, really, if you put like, if I was Jerry, I would just pull whatever strings were

[01:02:30] necessary to make like, Tron 82 something like that.

[01:02:33] Or like Tetris.

[01:02:34] Ah, but Tetris.

[01:02:37] The blocks are coming down.

[01:02:39] You got to shoot them to change the block direction.

[01:02:41] Maybe.

[01:02:42] Next step.

[01:02:44] That can and can and lagoon game he made.

[01:02:48] That's actually pretty fun.

[01:02:49] Have you played that?

[01:02:50] Yeah, I think all the, the more simple sort of children games he made are like great.

[01:02:55] I think, and, you know, looking at these home collectors too, who like the kids have nothing

[01:03:00] to jump on.

[01:03:01] Like, it's not like, hey, hey, son, hey, here's ACDC with like stack the 18 modes.

[01:03:06] And it's like, when you're like six years old, the kids always jump on the mega touch.

[01:03:11] That the person always has their basement.

[01:03:13] Yeah, or the main cabinet.

[01:03:15] But I, it's a weird thing because I guess what his hurdle must be with license is he's got the screen.

[01:03:23] He's got this like big piece of real estate that he can do interesting stuff with.

[01:03:28] It's probably, it's even more expensive, right?

[01:03:31] When you use more like visuals from a license and more footage and, but after all this time.

[01:03:37] Yeah, it adds up to cost, but I mean, there's still just the initial cost.

[01:03:41] I mean, I think Jerry does that like full time.

[01:03:44] Like, Piroc is his main gig and, I mean, you know, like, you know, whipping out like, you know,

[01:03:50] writing a check for like 75 grand or whatever it would be to get a license.

[01:03:53] That's not some change for a starting a start company.

[01:03:56] I mean, we couldn't do it.

[01:03:57] I mean, if, you know, if we had had a whip out a check, write a check for, you know, 50 even,

[01:04:02] God, even $25,000 when we started, we wouldn't have, we couldn't have done it.

[01:04:07] That's why I think American football is good, you're going to make it because I just don't, you know,

[01:04:13] pinball is just really not the business to go into.

[01:04:15] Is there a, is there a, who is, who Deania state?

[01:04:20] I don't, I think who Deanies open.

[01:04:22] I really like it.

[01:04:23] Open IP.

[01:04:24] Did you, did you notice on dialed in, it changed from Einstein's quantum theater to quantum

[01:04:30] theater because Einstein is a trademark license.

[01:04:34] I noticed that.

[01:04:36] And, and you know, because of that, I will never buy the game.

[01:04:39] No, yeah, I saw that.

[01:04:40] And it's like, I don't know if these companies are like IP lawyers, but they all should because they always sort of don't get it.

[01:04:48] But, well, Ben, we've talked for an hour.

[01:04:50] This has been good.

[01:04:51] I mean, what I love about talking to you is even if I have an agenda, we're just going to go all over,

[01:04:56] but we seem to cover everything, not, not in the direct way, but I think the listeners are really going to enjoy this.

[01:05:03] And, and we'll get you on again.

[01:05:05] And, and I can't wait.

[01:05:06] Are you going to be a T.P.F. for people who are going?

[01:05:09] Uh, yes, I am actually.

[01:05:11] Are you going?

[01:05:12] I will be there.

[01:05:13] So we will, we will connect there.

[01:05:15] Um, guys, Ben Heck, one of the most prolific people in the world.

[01:05:20] People in the computer technology engineering maker world.

[01:05:25] Uh, we look forward to seeing what your foam core masterpiece will become.

[01:05:31] Well, I've, I've, I'm on my, no, I'm on my fourth original foam core.

[01:05:36] So one thing I, one thing that I learned from John was to use foam core, although I don't think he practiced what he preached,

[01:05:41] but I've been foam core into the Jesus out of it.

[01:05:44] So yes.

[01:05:45] I'm not fucking foam core.

[01:05:47] Do you think a foam core prototype is ever worth anything like an Alice in Wonderland foam core?

[01:05:53] Well, I don't, I, I threw a couple, a couple away today.

[01:05:56] Hopefully I don't have any dumpster divers, but, uh, I don't know that they might be as some sort of piece of art.

[01:06:01] Although mine usually look like crap.

[01:06:03] There's like blue painters tape everywhere and magic marker and holes ripped in it.

[01:06:08] I'll take, I'll take ten of those.

[01:06:10] Ellie additions.

[01:06:11] Um, well, Ben, one more thing might, might foam core.

[01:06:15] I'm not gonna use shootable prototypes.

[01:06:17] I have my rotating rotisserie and you put in a 20 by 30 inch, half inch foam core cartridge,

[01:06:22] and you can actually build on it and play it.

[01:06:25] So I've been developing it like that.

[01:06:27] You should just sell foam core pinball for like five hundred bucks.

[01:06:30] Fuck it.

[01:06:31] Yeah, I don't, I don't actually, I don't use the computer.

[01:06:35] I, I shoot it in real life with tape and glue and foam core and then I put it in the computer.

[01:06:39] Okay, I mean, I mean disposable pinball machines. That's the future.

[01:06:42] Um, Ben, thank you so much for your time.

[01:06:45] I respect that you, you kind of sense when we're right on the hour.

[01:06:48] Um, and we will talk soon and I'll see you at T.P.F. in a few weeks.

[01:06:52] All right, well, hope everyone enjoyed the show.

[01:06:54] Yep. Thanks Ben.

[01:06:55] All right, cool.
