[00:00] Happy Monday morning everyone.

[00:18] You get a little double bonus of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:22] It was a Greek Easter yesterday and we just had tons of food and wine.

[00:29] We went to Queens to celebrate it at a Greek restaurant and it was great.

[00:34] But the problem is when I eat like that, I just, I can't sleep.

[00:37] I just can't sleep.

[00:38] Tons of food.

[00:39] I've been up probably since 4am, played a bunch of Street Fighter V and now I just wanted

[00:44] to do a quick special edition of Canadian Spinball podcast.

[00:47] And the topic here is Ghostbusters.

[00:49] And this is a game that everyone is super excited to play.

[00:54] Everyone is looking forward to Wednesday's reveal of the magnetic slings.

[00:58] But the reason I wanted to do this special edition is it seems like there is an issue

[01:03] that's been developing a few issues around the game and I wanted to sort of bring them

[01:08] up and see what you guys think about this.

[01:13] Because I really hope there's not an Achilles heel issue with this pinball machine.

[01:19] It seems to be there's, I want to say three things that I keep reading consistently.

[01:24] Many people are having with the pros that are out on location in people's homes.

[01:29] And the issues that have popped up are the following.

[01:31] It seems to be the center drain, the space between the flippers on Trudeau pinball machines

[01:38] is always larger than normal.

[01:40] And we know that about Trudeau games.

[01:42] So it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that the gap between the flippers is larger.

[01:47] So that is leading to a lot more straight down the middle drains, which always frustrates

[01:53] people.

[01:55] There's also an issue, I think along with that is the flippers themselves seem to be

[02:01] angled a little bit further down.

[02:04] So they're not parallel with the lane that they're next to.

[02:07] And what that is doing is it's making it harder to trap the ball for people.

[02:13] So I noticed too when I played Ghostbuzz a lot of times when you try to trap the ball

[02:17] and can roll off because you really can't cradle it tightly.

[02:24] But the biggest issue that I keep reading about and I've also experienced this issue myself

[02:30] is the rails by the out lanes, those posts, those metal posts.

[02:37] The ball seems to jump over that rail, that post, and drain down the out lanes.

[02:43] And that seems to be the biggest concern people have.

[02:47] I want to talk about those issues and I am a little bit scratching my head as to what

[02:54] is going to be Stern's response to this because I don't think this is just a few people

[03:00] experiencing this.

[03:01] I think this is pretty universal in people's experiences with the pin.

[03:08] And so what's going to happen next?

[03:12] First thing I want to skin this cat is the issue of when you buy a new inbox pinball machine

[03:19] should there be things that you have to tweak when you open up a new inbox.

[03:25] And I keep reading a lot of back and forth on this.

[03:28] And there's some people, there's someone made a comment that this is pinball and you have

[03:32] to be willing to do work on the machine when you set it up to get it right.

[03:36] And someone made a comment that there's people who work on pinball machines

[03:41] and there's people who use their credit card.

[03:44] And I really think that was an offensive thing to say.

[03:47] I'll say why?

[03:48] I think when you open up a new inbox machine, it should work pretty much perfectly out of

[03:53] the box.

[03:54] I really don't think people should have to tinker with the machine.

[03:57] I don't think people should have to set it up properly.

[04:00] I don't think people should have to dial it in.

[04:01] I always think that phrases silly.

[04:03] I think it should come out of the box working perfectly.

[04:08] I understand that sometimes cables might move and things might have to shift around.

[04:14] And in those cases, hopefully those are easy fixes.

[04:17] But for the most part, should not a game be tested and working 100% before it's put

[04:22] in the box.

[04:23] So when I see things like the slimer is not registering hits and you have to move the

[04:29] wire over and people are saying, look, it's a new pin and whatnot and some things have

[04:35] to be adjusted.

[04:36] I think some of those things have to be caught by quality control before they're sent out.

[04:43] Now look, the game is just shipping.

[04:45] So some of these things may be uncovered during the first initial run.

[04:50] But I'm worried because I think premiums and LEDs are ready to hit the line.

[04:54] And I don't know if some of these changes are going to be made before those games ship.

[05:00] So the one that I think, again, let's go back to the one that I think got people the

[05:03] most worried.

[05:04] Is the is the out is the post is is those metal rails that are on the out lanes.

[05:10] People are suggesting that if they were just raised them up a little bit that would help.

[05:15] I'm not sure if that would solve it or not.

[05:18] But here's the question.

[05:19] Will Stern read this feedback and will they make a change to that area of the game before

[05:25] they make the premiums and the LEDs?

[05:29] And I don't know.

[05:31] I really am head scratching a little bit because I have they had the pros out there testing

[05:38] them long enough to realize this is an issue.

[05:44] And now that people have brought this issue to their attention, it's interesting to see

[05:48] what are they going to do?

[05:50] What are they going to do?

[05:51] And can they do anything in time to correct that issue?

[05:55] I'm not sure.

[05:57] I hope that they're reading the feedback and I hope that something happens to sort of

[06:03] improve the game because I think what nobody wants is this really fun pinball machine to

[06:08] just be too frustrating for people because 95% of people who are going to buy Ghostbusters

[06:15] are not expert players.

[06:19] And that's an important thing.

[06:20] It's a game like like a game like walking dead, which is really hard, really brutal.

[06:24] And you've got these expert players who say they love it.

[06:27] But for the most part, people who walk up to a walking dead and it's really hard, it

[06:33] drains down the middle, it's constantly brutal.

[06:36] It's not fun.

[06:37] It's not fun.

[06:38] So I think people want to find the right balance of a machine where the ball times might

[06:42] not be too long.

[06:43] But the ball times is some people are saying are like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, games are

[06:48] ending really fast on the pro.

[06:50] It's going to be a problem because Ghostbusters is as mainstream and as popular as it gets

[06:55] for a sternum.

[06:56] And I don't think people are going to want to play a pinball machine that has lots and

[07:00] lots of drain issues.

[07:02] Now to fix these issues, some people are suggesting you put a center post in the middle to prevent

[07:07] some of the straight down the middle drains.

[07:09] I think that's ridiculous.

[07:11] I think adding a post there when it wasn't intended to be there by the designer is a big

[07:17] mistake.

[07:18] And it's kind of lame.

[07:19] Because like someone said, like putting training wheels on a bike.

[07:22] And I think if you do that, no one's really going to want to play your machine because

[07:28] there's something about the consistency that all machines are designed the same.

[07:33] And yes, why you can move the, and a lot of machines, there's the posts on the, by the

[07:38] outlines that you can move up and down.

[07:40] There's usually three different positions to make it a little bit easier.

[07:44] I don't think that the Ghostbusters doesn't have that.

[07:47] So it sort of is what it is.

[07:50] So it's, it's looking like it's going to be somewhat of a difficult short ball time pinball

[07:54] machine.

[07:55] I don't, I don't have a problem with that per se.

[07:58] I think people can play more about long ball times and short ball times.

[08:02] But what is Stern going to do?

[08:04] And I think we're going to see a lot on Wednesday when Jack Danger plays the premium and the

[08:09] LA because is the ball draining down the outlines with, because the way the, the slings

[08:16] work on the pro, and that's what I was wondering too, because those, the slings on the pro, you

[08:21] know, they're very sort of, like up and down, like the angle on them is, it doesn't, you

[08:28] know, sort of, doesn't kick the ball back up into the play field.

[08:31] It seems to kick it into the outlines more.

[08:34] And will the magnetic slings create a whole different experience that won't have the ball

[08:38] going towards the outlines as much?

[08:40] I don't know.

[08:41] I mean, no one really knows.

[08:42] No one's really played it.

[08:44] But I think Stern is in a little bit of a pickle here and needs to really, really listen

[08:49] to this feedback because I think the last thing people are going to want is to have a brutal,

[08:56] brutal pinball machine when it comes to Ghostbusters.

[08:59] I think this game needs to be accessible.

[09:03] And by that, I think it needs to be a machine where people don't have to shake it around

[09:07] and slam it and really like work the machine super hard to get deeper into the game.

[09:13] And to experience a lot of the fun and the codes the game is going to have to offer.

[09:18] Because the game's got a lot of shots and it's just a lot of stuff to do in the game.

[09:21] And I think it'd be a shame if short ball times take away from that fun.

[09:27] So it's going to be really interesting to see what do you think Stern is going to do here.

[09:32] People have already said that the mod community might be able to come up with a fix for it.

[09:36] I saw someone create it.

[09:37] Some really cool.

[09:38] They look like a plastic extender that goes up the side plastic, the flipper plastic all

[09:46] the way up over the rail.

[09:49] So that could be a possible solution.

[09:51] What I think everyone should feel confident in is that the mod community will come to the

[09:57] rescue if Stern does not come to the rescue.

[10:01] But that being said, for what these pins are costing now, I really, really, really hope

[10:06] Stern looks at the feedback.

[10:07] And I hope if there is adjustments that can be made, they will be made before the premiums

[10:13] and the Ellie ship.

[10:14] Because I think most people are going in on premiums with this one, if the slings work

[10:20] well.

[10:21] And I don't think people would have an issue if Stern wants to make a slight adjustment.

[10:25] I think they're in a pretty, they're pretty much in a quagmire though because what do you

[10:30] do with all those pros that have shipped if there is something that needs to happen to

[10:34] make that area less drain happy.

[10:37] So that's it.

[10:39] I mean, I don't know how you guys, we're going to, it's interesting to see this thread that's

[10:43] catching fire and more and more Ghostbusters or Pinball machines are going out there.

[10:48] And we're going to have more on this on Wednesday.

[10:49] But I want to know what you guys think.

[10:51] Please share your thoughts with me.

[10:53] It's great because I would love to hear from you guys.

[10:55] And if you guys want to, who have gotten a Ghostbusters, want to come on the show and talk

[10:59] about how the Pinball machine has been so far, please hit me up at Canada Pinball.

[11:05] That's K-A-N-E-D-A Pinball at gmail.com.

[11:09] It would love to hear from you and see how the game is treating you.

[11:14] Is it fun?

[11:15] Is it brutal?

[11:16] Do you think it needs to be adjusted or are you happy with the way it is?

[11:20] As some have said, it will make you a better player if you keep it the way it is.

[11:26] But I also think a game like Ghostbusters needs to be accessible to a lot more people

[11:30] than just the hardcore guys that are slamming machines around.

[11:34] So that's it for this little Monday morning sort of special edition that can be his Pinball

[11:38] podcast.

[11:39] I hope you guys had a good weekend.

[11:41] And I know we just got a couple days until we see the magnetic slings working on Ghostbusters.

[11:46] Until then, hit me up and let's talk Pinball.
