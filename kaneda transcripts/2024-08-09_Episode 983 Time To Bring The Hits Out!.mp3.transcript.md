[00:00] Bring em out, bring em out, hey!

[00:02] Bring em out, bring em out, kill!

[00:04] Bring em out, bring em out, hey!

[00:06] Bring em out, bring em out, hey!

[00:08] Bring em out, bring em out, hey!

[00:10] VIP, coming live from the VIP, heard the nightlife, wrongs life, where that rainbow...

[00:14] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up!

[00:18] Ah, bring em out, bring em out, bring em out!

[00:20] Where are the hit pinball machines, everybody?

[00:24] On this Friday episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I was just thinking about it this week.

[00:29] This is gonna be the moment, I think, in the last, like, few years of pinball, where every single manufacturer,

[00:37] I don't care who you are, whether you've got 400 people or 4 people,

[00:42] every single pinball manufacturer must be feeling the heat, because the market is soft,

[00:49] and what that means is you need to bring em out.

[00:52] You need to bring out a hit game next.

[00:55] There's no room anymore for mediocrity.

[00:58] Everybody's over it. I mean, did you just see that Godzilla, the black and white edition of Godzilla,

[01:05] which just came out last week for, like, $9,600?

[01:10] There's already one for sale for $8,600, a $1,000 loss in, like, a week of just being on the market,

[01:20] and what that means now is this, and everybody, I know you know this, like, grab a whiskey,

[01:26] it's Friday morning, Canada's two cups of coffee, and because you all know this,

[01:31] you're not gonna buy another new and box game, unless it's a game that you really want to bolt to the floor of your game room,

[01:39] because if you just buy everything, you're losing thousands of dollars, and so that's why these manufacturers,

[01:46] they have to bring out hit games that you want.

[01:50] Now, here's the problem. There's, like, 12 manufacturers, and everyone's gonna be competing for the space in your game room

[01:58] and the money in your wallet, so let's talk about each manufacturer, and do we think they have a hit game coming next?

[02:07] You know, I'm on SpookyPinball.com right now, and every one of their games you can buy right now new and box.

[02:15] Nothing has sold out. The feeding frenzy, it's over. You can go on Jersey Jack and go order in Elton John CE today.

[02:26] The game's been out for almost a year, like, 10 months, and what does that mean about the state of Pinball?

[02:33] It means that we need the next Godzilla. We need the next Metallica. We need the next Tron.

[02:40] We need the next, I'm trying to think of a hit Jersey Jack, I don't know, the next Guns N' Roses,

[02:44] but make it in a way that's a little bit more simple, a little bit more approachable.

[02:48] You know, I heard Jack Winari is telling people, we need to reign Eric in.

[02:52] We need to get him to make games that people understand. He was telling people, like, when you walk up to a godfather,

[02:59] you have no idea what's going on. It's like walking up, looking at what Canada wears during a night out in New York City.

[03:08] The thing going through your head is, what's going on here? And that's what happens when you walk up to Jersey Jack Godfather.

[03:15] You have no clue what's going on. And even if you see in the movie, you're still clueless.

[03:20] So if Eric's got Harry Potter, may the Pinball gods help us all because imagine if Eric Minier is trying to lay out a game

[03:28] that's easy to approach and there's like eight or nine Harry Potter movies.

[03:32] I mean, look how confusing it is to play freaking Pirates of the Caribbean. So I'm worried, but that's not next from Jersey Jack.

[03:40] So if the hit games need to be brought out next, let's talk about it. So let's start with Spooky.

[03:46] So Spooky Pinball. For them to have a hit game next, because I do think that Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre are two B themes.

[03:56] If you add them together, it doesn't make an A theme. There's a reason why they have not sold out of all 880 of each of them.

[04:04] It's just not a dream theme. Now, for Spooky's next game to be a hit, I think they need to come out with something that's a little bit more mainstream,

[04:13] something that speaks to each and every one of us and isn't too far down that like horror, like campy, you know, like evil dead won't do it.

[04:22] It's got to be something like I'm hoping it is. It's got to be something like the Goonies.

[04:27] Now we know Beetlejuice is not next. Sonic the Hedgehog could be a mainstream hit.

[04:33] So that's what Spooky Pinball needs to do. I don't want to be at some like horror convention where this game is unveiled.

[04:41] It needs to be something more mainstream. Let's go next to Jersey Jack.

[04:45] Now the rumor is if we warm up to Mark Sidon's game, we're really going to enjoy it.

[04:52] And that makes me really nervous because if we have to warm up to the theme, that means it's not a triple A take my money now kind of theme.

[05:02] Even if it is Avatar, that is not a theme that everybody wants.

[05:07] And I think we might be in for another rocky road.

[05:11] And the reason why Jersey Jack needs a hit next, it's been three sales flops in a row for the most part, right?

[05:19] Toy Story, The Godfather, and Elton John are not sales juggernauts.

[05:25] I bet Gundon Roses has sold more pinball machines than all three of those games combined.

[05:32] So Jersey Jack, are you going to bring out the hit game next? I kind of don't think so.

[05:38] I think it's going to be the game after the next game, but the good news for Jersey Jack and the sun is always shining over Jersey Jack.

[05:47] The good news is they are owned by a multi-billionaire.

[05:54] And when you're owned by a multi-billionaire, it don't matter.

[05:58] It doesn't matter if it's a hit or a miss.

[06:02] They can afford to keep that company going forever.

[06:06] And that's somewhat exciting.

[06:08] Now I actually wish they would take that and run with it more.

[06:13] If you've got a billion dollar backer, these games should have everything in them.

[06:19] And then some, they shouldn't be these baron games.

[06:23] So Jersey Jack, I'm looking for you to load up these games and to use those billions wisely.

[06:30] Alright, Chicago Gaming Company, it's so weird talking about they need a hit next.

[06:36] Because their next hit game is also their previous hit game.

[06:40] And that is Pulp Fiction LE.

[06:42] It's going to sell just fine.

[06:43] They've already sold out of the bad mofo editions.

[06:46] And after that, the next game from them is a surefire hit.

[06:52] It's a game that's going to sell out.

[06:55] They're making 500 more medieval madness games.

[06:59] Now that's a smart move by CGC.

[07:02] And after that, who knows what's next.

[07:05] Like Rick at Planetary just got burned by Damien over at Haggis.

[07:11] And now what are they going to do?

[07:13] You know, Mark Ritchie finished Pulp Fiction like four years ago or three years ago.

[07:18] So they have Mark Ritchie over there.

[07:21] I heard he was working on a science fiction license property game.

[07:27] And that was after Pulp Fiction.

[07:30] But that's probably at the pace CGC goes sometime in 2026.

[07:37] But CGC is another company where Churchill finances this company.

[07:42] That is why there's no sense of urgency.

[07:44] So they're going to be just fine.

[07:47] They don't need a hit.

[07:48] Let's go to the next company, American Pinball.

[07:50] They need a hit game.

[07:51] I mean, there's no denying it.

[07:52] They need the next game to be a hit.

[07:54] If the rumor that Cuphead is the next theme, that is going to be really hard.

[07:59] Now, when will we see this game from AP?

[08:01] I think David Fix and the company over there is going to bring it to Expo.

[08:05] It's right in their backyard.

[08:07] It's David's like show itself.

[08:10] I think he's like the partner of Expo.

[08:12] So we shall see.

[08:13] You know, again, it's going to be an uphill climb if that's the theme.

[08:18] And so like if they don't have another hit game, you know, I think they need to get to He-Man because that's the other rumor.

[08:24] And if they have He-Man, just make He-Man.

[08:27] It's that simple.

[08:29] All right.

[08:30] So that's AP.

[08:31] What else we got?

[08:32] Multimorphic.

[08:33] Do they need a hit game next?

[08:36] They're so small and they're trickling out these like Princess Bride starting in a few weeks.

[08:43] I don't think Jerry needs a hit.

[08:45] I think Jerry needs to change the platform.

[08:48] That's how I've always felt.

[08:50] If he made a normal pinball machine just once, just try it once Jerry.

[08:56] If the Princess Bride was in a normal cabinet, I think it would outsell this version two to three to one.

[09:04] We'll never know because he'll never do it.

[09:07] He'll never test the pinball market by making a normal pinball game.

[09:12] That being said, as I've said before, they're not going to rip you off.

[09:16] You'll eventually get your game.

[09:19] And when you do get it, you better hold on to it because if you try to sell your P3 Multimorphic, just take a Santa bag full of cash and light it on fire

[09:31] because you're going to lose like five to ten thousand dollars if you bought every single one of those kits and you try to sell the game.

[09:39] You got to go all in.

[09:41] All right, so Multimorphic, I think they'll do just fine.

[09:44] They've got two more licensed themes coming after the Princess Bride.

[09:48] I don't see them ever making a game that's going to get like five hundred or a thousand people to order it.

[09:55] I just don't, but I still think they'll survive because Jerry's got the right size operation for the demand.

[10:02] Now, speaking about the opposite, Stern Pinball, they've got hundreds of people over there.

[10:07] They've got a lot of mouths to feed.

[10:09] They've got a lot of designers, a lot of coders.

[10:12] They keep using zombie Eddie.

[10:13] He's terrific, but there's a lot of Eddie games.

[10:16] And so does Stern Pinball's next game need to be a hit?

[10:19] And the answer is yes.

[10:21] It needs to be a huge hit.

[10:23] It's coming from Jack Danger.

[10:25] It's coming from the world of Marvel we're hearing in the rumor mill.

[10:28] And we know Jack Danger can make a hit game.

[10:30] We know there's a lot of excitement around Jack Danger.

[10:33] We know Keith Elwyn helps Jack Danger out with design, which is good news.

[10:38] The only issue is this.

[10:40] This is the uphill climb.

[10:41] Do you want another Marvel themed game?

[10:44] Stern's strategy of going from Dad Rock to Marvel, back to Dad Rock, back to movie franchises

[10:52] from the 60s and maybe 70s.

[10:54] Their strategy is starting to wear really thin.

[10:59] And then the moment they step their toe into a contemporary theme like John Wick,

[11:05] they absolutely get annihilated.

[11:08] The sales are horrible.

[11:09] And I think the mistake Stern has made and Jody Dankberg and Mr. Sharp over there

[11:16] and all the people deciding on the themes, I think they got lazy.

[11:21] I think they got in bed with a lot of big IP holding companies like mainly Disney and Marvel.

[11:27] And I think they haven't gone into the portfolio of those companies deep enough.

[11:33] People want a Wolverine pin.

[11:35] People want a Punisher pin.

[11:37] I'm going to tell you right now you're not getting the Punisher.

[11:40] That's not the game.

[11:42] And I'm telling you this right now.

[11:44] I think they need to look at some of the ginormous Disney properties because a lot of these people who own games,

[11:50] they have families, they have kids.

[11:53] Why isn't there a pinball machine for the Lion King?

[11:58] If you have the Disney partnership, why don't you go make Toy Story 1 Stern pinball?

[12:04] Why don't you go make some of these iconic Pixar movies like The Incredibles?

[12:10] I think we're just over seeing the same kinds of Marvel games.

[12:16] And if you're going to have Yeti work on the artwork on all these Marvel games,

[12:21] it does start to look like the same over and over again.

[12:27] The styles are the same.

[12:29] The themes are the same.

[12:31] And I think it's going to be an eye-opening year for Stern because I think they need to reset.

[12:37] I think they need to reset their strategy.

[12:40] I think they need to bring in new personnel.

[12:42] Come on, Canada's number is available.

[12:44] I'd happily be a consultant for this company.

[12:47] They need to get stuff going differently.

[12:50] The fact that they slept on stuff like Beetlejuice and let Spooky Pinball get it is crazy.

[12:57] The fact that they didn't get Rick and Morty is crazy.

[13:01] The fact that they don't want to make Beavis and Budhead is crazy.

[13:04] The fact that they don't have the red-hot chili peppers or the Beastie Boys is crazy.

[13:09] We need Stern to try new stuff.

[13:13] I think the other thing Stern needs to do is create another division within Stern

[13:19] where every game doesn't need to sell 3-5,000 units.

[13:23] But I think they need a craft version of Stern where they can go get a theme like Big Trouble in Little China

[13:31] or a theme like The Last Starfighter or Bloodsport or Akira

[13:35] and have a version of Stern Pinball, a la DPX,

[13:39] where they're only going to make a thousand versions of that game

[13:43] and it's going to be more of like a cult classic division within Stern

[13:47] because I think what Stern's doing now is there's so much pressure to have the cornerstone sell like 3-5,000 units

[13:54] they just keep placing their bets on the same type of stuff

[13:58] and I think we're over it because people who have bought all those machines don't need another.

[14:04] They don't need another Dadrock and they might not need another Marvel game.

[14:08] Man, that means Stern's next is going to be challenging

[14:11] and then after that is Metallica all over again

[14:14] and then after that is King Kong from Keith Elwyn

[14:18] and so we might not get the next hit from Stern until sometime in 2025.

[14:23] Alright, so that's Stern Pinball.

[14:25] Lots riding on that company and what they do next.

[14:28] Alright, who else is out there in the pinball world?

[14:31] Let's talk about the pinball brothers.

[14:33] I don't know, gang.

[14:34] Like, I don't think they have anything next that's going to be a hit.

[14:37] I think a company like this is going to be in trouble

[14:41] because Abba's not going to do well, Queen didn't sell,

[14:46] Alien was left over from Andrew Highway

[14:49] and when I think about this company and the creative sort of vision they have

[14:54] and where they're taking the company, I just don't have much faith

[14:57] and I think as we've got all these pinball companies

[15:00] the fact that I can't even conjure up what I would make if I were them

[15:06] I know they're trying to make stuff that's appealing in Europe

[15:10] just as much as it is in the US.

[15:12] I mean, maybe they make a FIFA soccer game.

[15:15] I'm surprised nobody made an Olympic game.

[15:18] Remember that old track and field game from the arcade where you smashed the buttons?

[15:22] I mean, maybe you could make a pinball version of that

[15:25] and have a lot of different Olympic events happening.

[15:28] Like, you got to jump the ball, go over the pole vault,

[15:31] run around the track, jump hurdles.

[15:33] I don't know, maybe you could do it.

[15:35] Seems a little difficult now that I think about it.

[15:37] But yeah, pinball brothers, I sort of put them up.

[15:39] I want to group together like pinball brothers and Padready Gaming.

[15:43] I know Padready's got the Fun House remake

[15:46] and I know they're going to do other remakes.

[15:48] Oh yeah, and I just remember like after medieval madness

[15:51] I believe that we're going to get Twilight Zone from Chicago Gaming Company.

[15:55] So yeah, they've got two juggernauts coming in a row.

[15:59] And so when we think about Padready Gaming and the pinball brothers,

[16:02] I don't know gang, like I'm just sort of at a loss.

[16:06] And the reason why I'm at a loss is I just don't get any sense from these companies.

[16:13] A, that they have their George Gomez, that they have a creative leader over there

[16:18] that understands what the pinball buying demographic wants.

[16:22] And I think companies like Padready and companies like the pinball brothers,

[16:26] I think what they need to start doing is being a lot more transparent

[16:30] because they're trying to do the same playbook as everybody else

[16:33] where what we're working on next is a secret and we're not going to let anybody know

[16:38] and then we're just going to like drop it on the world and expect it to sell.

[16:43] And I just don't think that's going to happen.

[16:45] And I think they need to start doing more market research

[16:48] and they need to start asking people, what would you want?

[16:50] Because I'm here to tell you right now,

[16:52] if the pinball brothers or Padready Gaming,

[16:55] if they made Bloodsport from Jean-Claude Van Damme,

[16:59] if they made a Bloodsport pinball machine, it would outsell ABBA,

[17:04] it would outsell the Funhouse remake that's going on right now.

[17:08] And Jean-Claude Van Damme has never had a pinball machine and it would work.

[17:13] You would be able to do it.

[17:15] So look, if you're just trying to sell a thousand units,

[17:18] you got to pick something better that makes a thousand people want to own it.

[17:22] We got those two companies, we got Homepin,

[17:25] and apparently is releasing the Blues Brothers with like open source code.

[17:30] People can like open source the code.

[17:32] I don't think that's going to work.

[17:34] I mean, Homepin, they don't have a hit game.

[17:37] Did Spinal Tap even come out?

[17:39] It feels like they've already moved on to the Blues Brothers.

[17:42] So that company's not going anywhere.

[17:44] Whom I'm missing?

[17:45] We got Homepin, we got the people over in Europe.

[17:48] We covered off on Spooky, CGC, Jersey Jack, Stern Pinball.

[17:53] We got Turner Pinball, who's just released Ninja Eclipse.

[17:58] Is that game going to sell?

[18:00] Does Chris Turner have something after that?

[18:03] If I was Chris, the thing I would have done,

[18:05] I would not have sold Raza and all of it.

[18:08] I would not have sold that to Dutch Pinball X.

[18:12] I would have made the game.

[18:14] And the reason why is Robert Mueller spent so much money on the coding,

[18:18] so much money on the game, and I would have made it.

[18:22] Like, all that work was spent and all the money went into it,

[18:26] and then you sold it, and now someone else gets to make it,

[18:29] and that company might be Dutch Pinball X.

[18:31] So let's talk about DPX.

[18:33] Their next game is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[18:36] That game is coming out in a couple months.

[18:38] You know me, I'm under NDA.

[18:40] We're going to get more stuff to you.

[18:42] I was talking to Melvin today.

[18:44] We're going to get some exclusive photo year away next week,

[18:47] and I'm happy.

[18:48] I see Melvin slowly peeling back the layers of this game

[18:52] so that you get to see some stuff,

[18:54] and then when it comes out, you're going to see it in all of its totality,

[18:58] and I think that's the way to do it.

[19:00] You know what the theme is, so you might as well start getting people excited

[19:03] as we move closer to the launch of the game.

[19:07] It also helps sort of mitigate, you know,

[19:10] oh man, like, why do they make this theme,

[19:12] or why is there this in it?

[19:14] Because if people already know, they won't complain as much.

[19:17] And they'll look at it with more of an open mind.

[19:20] Now look, after this, like after Alice,

[19:23] I heard that Melvin might make something that's licensed, so we shall see.

[19:28] Now the good news is this, the next game from Dutch Pinball is Back to the Future.

[19:33] They're going to get so many orders for that game.

[19:37] They will be making that game for the next five years.

[19:40] And so I think that's going to be the next five years of Dutch Pinball,

[19:45] and maybe even Dutch Pinball X.

[19:47] You're not going to need to release another DPX game,

[19:50] because that second line or that second building over at Dutch

[19:54] is going to be busy building Back to the Future games.

[19:58] And so I'm excited to see Back to the Future.

[20:00] I don't know when it's going to happen.

[20:02] Part of me feels like it's not going to be to end of next year.

[20:06] I kind of feel like it's going to take them almost a year

[20:08] to make all these Alice in Wonderlands if they make 500.

[20:12] Do I think they're going to sell 500 Alice's?

[20:15] I don't know.

[20:17] I don't think they're going to sell that many.

[20:19] I feel like they're probably going to sell closer to 250 or 300

[20:24] over the first few months, because everybody knows there's a wait.

[20:27] And when you know there's a long wait and you've been listening to Canada,

[20:31] you know, it's kind of hard to jump in early.

[20:33] But I know they're doing something that's going to be much more appealing

[20:37] and none of these nonrefundable deposits.

[20:40] So they might sell out of all the spots.

[20:43] If getting a spot doesn't cost any money,

[20:46] you might as well get on a spot, I guess.

[20:49] All right.

[20:50] So that's Dutch Pimball, Dutch Pimball X.

[20:52] Haggis Pimball is done.

[20:54] Do we think Damien and Marty are going to resurface?

[20:57] I don't.

[20:58] There's a lot of heat coming at these people now.

[21:00] They're being called some nasty names.

[21:03] I just want to see people have some justice here.

[21:06] I want to see the creditors get some assets.

[21:09] You know, because the money went somewhere.

[21:11] And where did the money go?

[21:12] Like, there is a good portion of money close to a million Australian dollars

[21:17] in customer money.

[21:18] Where is it?

[21:19] Like, the money didn't go to vendors.

[21:21] The money didn't go.

[21:22] Where did it go?

[21:23] Did Aaron at Fast Pimball make hundreds of thousands of dollars

[21:26] and come out looking like a genius?

[21:28] Probably.

[21:29] He's probably texting me right now.

[21:30] He's a crisp.

[21:31] First of all, it's fast.

[21:32] All capitals, fast.

[21:33] I'm like, all right, Aaron, I get it.

[21:34] I get it.

[21:35] You are the smart one.

[21:36] You send stuff after getting paid.

[21:38] I think too many fools out there sent money in and nothing was even close to being made.

[21:45] I mean this, if you ordered a Centaur or Blivian edition, how do you wake up and look at yourself

[21:51] in the mirror?

[21:52] Like, you knew it wasn't going to happen.

[21:54] Like, everybody was telling you don't do it.

[21:57] And there was no upside to doing it because you knew that game was never going to hold

[22:02] $17,500 in value because of some stupid biker jacket and motorcycle helmet.

[22:07] All right, everybody, so that's it.

[22:09] You know, we're in a new pinball world right now.

[22:12] It is August.

[22:14] Secondhand sales are terrible.

[22:16] There's new James Bond code.

[22:18] You guys need to download that if you have the game.

[22:21] I think what's happening right now is simply this.

[22:23] I think a lot of you are very happy with what you have.

[22:27] The only thing that's going to make you spend this kind of money now moving forward is if

[22:31] it's a dream theme that you want to bolt into your game room.

[22:35] The pinball hobby over COVID, I think, saw a manipulated market that didn't last very

[22:42] long.

[22:43] And I think every single company adapted the way they do business as if that COVID frenzy

[22:49] was going to last forever.

[22:51] It's over.

[22:52] And it's impacting so many industries and so many categories out there in the world of

[22:56] business.

[22:57] But for some reason, all of these pinball companies are unable to make a move.

[23:02] And the move they need to make is they need to lower their prices.

[23:06] They need to also limit the number of LEDs.

[23:09] It's those two things.

[23:10] If you still think you're going to sell a thousand at 13,000 and then charge people

[23:15] 2,000 for toppers, that day is over.

[23:18] Like those days are done.

[23:20] And the only way you're ever going to get even close to that kind of frenzy to buy those

[23:25] kinds of games is if you have a triple A theme that people really want.

[23:30] Now, my worry is this.

[23:32] I don't think the next games that are coming out, I don't think they're going to be these

[23:36] like OMG games that just reawaken our enthusiasm.

[23:41] And the danger is this.

[23:43] We are all now going on two years of lackluster themes, losing so much money.

[23:50] And I've never in the 10 years I've been in pinball seen such a consistent lowering of

[23:57] the enthusiasm by the pinball buying demographic because all these companies need all of us

[24:04] to absorb their new inbox creations.

[24:08] And now buying new inbox stands for losing money, not being exclusive.

[24:15] They're going to make a nicer version down the road and there's no need to buy one right now.

[24:20] And the early adopter is getting annihilated.

[24:23] That's never what it used to be.

[24:25] And I think all these pinball companies should get together and start to realize it's a new world

[24:31] and they need to adapt accordingly and they're not.

[24:34] And that's why it's easy to be like you and me right now.

[24:38] Just wait and see, wait on the sideline and you will be able to get whatever you want for so much cheaper.

[24:45] And the only time you should move quickly is if it's a dream theme that you've been waiting your whole life for

[24:51] and you're never going to sell because you don't even want to buy a game now.

[24:55] Thinking about resale because resale is a financial disaster now with all of these games.

[25:00] Everybody happy Friday. We'll talk to you soon.

[25:03] Canada out.
