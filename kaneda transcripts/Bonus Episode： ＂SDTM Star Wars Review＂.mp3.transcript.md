[00:00] Oh yeah, when I hold your baby Will your heart be close to me?

[00:22] Welcome to this bonus edition of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:25] This is a little bit of a trading place podcast because I was interviewed by Greg and Zach of Straight Down the Middle Pinball.

[00:33] These two guys are awesome. They have a great pinball show on YouTube. It's called Straight Down the Middle.

[00:39] I think you guys should check it out. I love watching their reviews. They interviewed me and the video was kind of choppy.

[00:46] They aired the audio of our discussion and I wanted to air it for you on this channel as well. We reviewed Star Wars.

[00:56] I think you're going to love it. I love the take these guys had on the game. We give it our scores. We review everything from the gameplay to the artwork to the sound to the theme.

[01:08] You're going to hear that in a second. Before I air that interview that they did with me, I want to do a couple quick news items.

[01:16] Number one, I was reading that Pat Lawler, the man himself is going to design the scoop protectors on dialed in.

[01:26] There's been some play field wear in the game especially in the whole where the SIM card hole is and a couple other areas.

[01:36] Pat Lawler himself will be designing the protectors because apparently I heard that he's not quite happy with how Cliffey's limit the opening to the scoops.

[01:46] Interesting that they're not going with Cliffey. I know Cliffey listens to the show. I'm curious. He'll probably email me if Cliffey himself has a patent for his design on these scoops because it seems like Stern has replicated what he does and it's the exact same sort of approach.

[02:08] I'm kind of unfortunate that Cliffey, which was the household name in scoop protectors, is now getting circumvented by these manufacturers.

[02:18] We'll see what Pat Lawler comes up with because is it going to be exactly what Cliffey does or is it going to be something a little bit different?

[02:26] Will it be metal? Will it be something clear so you can see the artwork through it? Not sure.

[02:32] But what's good news for you guys who are in undyled in collectors editions is all of these changes will be implemented. Hopefully by the time you get your super expensive $12,500 version of the game.

[02:45] What else is going on in the news world? It's still Star Wars all the time and you're going to hear us talk about this game in the interview.

[02:52] But I wanted to pull up something that someone said because I think a lot of people and I get it. I get that there's like people who are in on this game.

[03:04] I still for the life of me. I just think there's a lot of people that are Star Wars apologists that really are giving this game such a pass and just looking at the theme and saying it's great.

[03:16] I want to read something that someone wrote this is from Pinside user.

[03:20] A S O A S O A or S O A maybe those are his initials from Plantation Florida.

[03:27] So he started a thread. What do you think of Star Wars premium Ellie now? And he wrote this. This game has what it takes to be great.

[03:34] Play's fast, great shots, great theme, great lighting, great sound, cool animations, hyperloop is cool.

[03:42] Death Star is decent. Probably will look better when it has lights working. Why is everybody hating on this game? Stop asking for so much.

[03:51] Steve Richie designed a great game. All right. See it's stuff like this lines like stop asking for so much.

[04:00] You can lower your expectations from Stern Pimbal and you'll love it. And we could all live life like that. We could.

[04:07] We could all look at everything that we we buy, everything that we're passionate about. And we can completely lower our expectations and go in and see every movie and love it because it's a movie and movies are fun.

[04:19] And it's a Pimbal machine and Pimbals are fun. And just because a game has great flow does not make it a great game.

[04:26] I'm sorry, but this apologetic approach to Star Wars Pimbal is the reason why Stern won't learn their lesson. They won't.

[04:36] If the Ellie's of Star Wars sell out, you will be sending Stern a message that this is good enough that we consider this to be a $9,000 Pimbal machine and you you you knocked it out of the park.

[04:49] The reason why I don't really put much faith in comments like this and guys like him and Beasel Boobherr just apologetic and claiming this game is going to be great is I think the game is going to be good.

[05:02] I think it's going to be a good game. I think it's going to have flow. I think it's going to be fast. But as you'll hear in this interview with Greg and Zach, the game could have been so much more.

[05:13] And all you have to do you don't even have to look back that far. Just go look at other Stern machines and look at what they gave you in Ellie trim.

[05:23] Look at the detail that went into the Simpsons Pimbal party and we talk about it. Stern went from putting really sculpted plastics on top of pop bumpers.

[05:34] They even did it in Ghostbusters with a nice city the city scape on top of the pop bumper area and look at the pop bumper area on Star Wars and you tell me you tell me that they did all they can do and they designed a great game.

[05:48] I think this game again is just such a miss for Star Wars. I keep harping on it because every time I read these people trying to justify why I should like it, I feel like I'm obligated to justify once again.

[06:03] Why I think we all should be extremely disappointed by this soft moroc effort with Star Wars and all you have to do is go back and look at the daddy East and the old Star Wars games.

[06:15] Go look at the flyers of when those games came out and look at all this stuff on the play field and you tell me you tell me that this game is worthy of the Star Wars theme.

[06:28] Without further ado, let me air the interview with Greg and Zach. I'm sorry the audio is not the best. I wasn't wearing a headset. I was talking into my computer.

[06:38] But it came out good enough. So I hope you enjoy it. Tomorrow we are going to be talking to Neil McCray and from the UK. I have Ted coming on. I've Scott Denise is going to we're going to talk on Monday.

[06:51] I know Scott was supposed to come out in this week, but he's obviously really busy getting total total nuclear annihilation ready, but we look forward to talking to Scott.

[07:00] And I keep hearing that Mike from home pin Mike from home pin will not come on the show. He just won't do it. I don't get it. I think this is a great form for Mike to talk about his game.

[07:11] Instead he's on the forums. He's on the forums all the time, but he won't come on. Can you just pinball podcast. So if you know Mike, send him an email, say Mike, reconsider. Look what this podcast did when we talked to Jack.

[07:24] I think telling the story behind these machines would help so much in alleviating a lot of people's questions and concerns. It also creates the right kind of buzz for your game.

[07:35] And look, I invited Steve Richie on this show. I invited Steve Richie on multiple times to come on to the show and talk about Star Wars, talk about the game. What did he do? He didn't come on.

[07:47] He just he never accepted the invite. I talked to Jared at Stern. We all know what happened there. So Stern's got a policy right now where it's not so easy to get their people on this show to talk about what they're working on.

[08:02] But they know that the door is open and I would happily interview anyone who wants to talk about their pinball machine. And we know that when we do it, we do it fair. We're very respectful.

[08:14] I've never had an interview be toxic or confrontational because at the end of the day, it is pinball. None of this really matters. These are all 1% problems. If we don't like Star Wars, 99.9999% of the planet would look at the game.

[08:31] The planet would look at us and be like, your priorities are fucked up if you're really stressed out about Star Wars pinball. And those people would be right. None of this really does matter.

[08:43] But it's entertaining. We love it. It's our little corner of the universe that we can geek out over. And that's why we love pinball. And that's why we love the pinball community.

[08:54] So let me hear the interview.

[08:56] We're going to have a pinball at gmail.com, Zach and Greg ladies and gentlemen.

[09:00] Hey, what's happening guys? This is Zach and this is Greg from Straight Down the Middle of pinball show. And you guys see somebody on the screen right now, don't you?

[09:06] Yeah, that's our buddy Chris also known as canada. What's happening Chris? Hey guys, how you going? Happy Friday.

[09:14] So we're first off. We want to thank canada for coming on because it's taken time out of his day. And we've asked a lot from him to coordinate all of this. So it's early morning lots of coffee.

[09:27] No, canada has already been to the day of gym man. I'm trying to get the pinball community in shape one day at a time. So that's right. I've had Pepsi and you're drinking coffee and he's out here pumping.

[09:41] So this week we're going to review Star Wars by Stern. Yes, you guys pumped up for that. Yeah.

[09:48] I've got some thoughts on the game. That's right. So for those of you, most of you guys know who canada is. He's a, I would call you a pinball celebrity, if you will.

[10:04] Maybe like a polarizing sort of politician in the world of pinball. I'll take that too. So for those of you who don't know canada, we want you to check out his podcast.

[10:17] It's like my favorite podcast. There's upcoming news. He gives interviews. There's just a lot of stuff that canada does on his podcast. It's probably if not the one one of the most popular podcasts and for a good reason.

[10:30] He was most informative. Most informative. That's where I get a lot. If not most of my news. And he just gives really good takes on the industry without without fears of pissing off anybody.

[10:43] He doesn't care. He wants to give a good view of the industry and he kind of works for the hobbyist and the collectors out there. So for that Chris, we do appreciate that.

[10:53] I thank you for that introduction. I'm humbled by it. And it's enjoyable. I love giving weekly updates on what's going on, especially to the new unbox collectors out there because they're all kind of crazy.

[11:06] I mean, we're buying $9,000 toys. So it's fun to do. I don't know. I don't know about you, but the one behind you doesn't look like a $9,000 toy. But it plays like a $2,000 toy. It costs 10 times as much. It's still broken.

[11:21] I'm trying to get it fixed one day soon. It's going to get fixed the day after I died. That's my.

[11:28] All right. So first off, what we wanted to do is we wanted to talk to Canada about his experience with Star Wars coming out unveiling.

[11:40] I know Chris, it's really a theme like many. It's a huge theme for everybody. But tell us a little bit about the Star Wars theme in general or your perception of it or your interpretation of it.

[11:52] Well, I mean, it's Star Wars, right? Star Wars is more popular than most organized religions. I think something like two billion people are Star Wars fans on the planet.

[12:02] It's the biggest theme ever. I hear people debating is Lord the Rings bigger than Star Wars. Star Wars is by far the biggest theme that's ever been attempted with Pimball.

[12:13] And for some reason, the biggest theme ever, and I love Star Wars, I'm the biggest Star Wars fan, we just can't get a great Star Wars pin. It's like the the the cragmeyer of Pimball. I just don't understand why with that subject matter, I just it's such a good thing.

[12:30] And we all grew up with the movies. I don't think there's any trilogy out there where we're so emotionally attached to it. And the iconic scenes from that movie people can recall the lines 30 or 40 years later.

[12:43] So I was super excited when I heard Star Wars is coming out. I think everybody was. So I'm excited to talk about our thoughts on it and our expectations for that pin.

[12:53] Well, you think it would be easier because of that because like you said there's so many scenes that are iconic, you would think that that source material and everything to pull from would be so much easier.

[13:02] And that it wouldn't be hard to make a good pin. But everybody struggles with it.

[13:07] Well, I guess the challenge is if there's three movies, let's say roughly six, seven hours of scenes, I think the challenge is like what what do you put in and what do you leave out? Right?

[13:18] And I think when we look at the game today, it's like well, they just left everything out. So we'll talk more about that. But I definitely think there's so many scenes there that could be incorporated really nicely in a pinball machine.

[13:33] Yeah, I think it's got to easily be the number one pinball theme ever or ever will be. I think it's just theme in general. I mean what other franchise would Disney buy for four billion dollars?

[13:47] Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah. You know, my little pony for that. Well, I think that's the difference between Star Wars is more lasting than Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings has a big following and it's a great franchise.

[13:59] But I think Star Wars is, it has more staying power. It's stood the test of time. Yeah, already. I think it's going to continue to.

[14:06] Oh, yeah. And look at right now, right? They, the expanded universe of Star Wars, we can get prequels, we can get new films. Lord of the Rings is over.

[14:15] I mean, it's done. There's nothing left to tell in that story. And then when they tried to do the prequel, they tried to like extend it and look how bad it turned out. So, you know, Star Wars, we're in a whole new era of Star Wars hype, right?

[14:28] Young kids love it, adults love it. I've never seen a property transcend so many generations. So it's so important for the pinball to be great.

[14:37] This theme, this theme deserves, this thing deserves everything. Yeah. And we just continually come, keep coming up, short on it. So, Kaneda, what were your first impressions? So when the release came out, you probably know about it a little bit beforehand. But when you first saw those pictures or got that inside info on the layout, Richie doing it, the code being done by Sullivan, what were your first impressions on how it was released?

[15:04] Number one, the marketing behind it, because I know your marketing got. And just the overall look of the art and the layout. What were your thoughts?

[15:13] I know I've shared these opinions a lot, but I never get tired of sharing them. So I think for some foremost, I think everybody was kind of just tired of waiting to see it, right?

[15:24] I mean, from a marketing standpoint, they really missed the two big dates to hit, to be part of sort of the country's Star Wars celebration. So there's the Star Wars festival that takes place every year that they missed it. And we know Stern had a booth. So they were planning to show it there.

[15:41] And that was in March sometime. And then May 4th, right? May the 4th be with you. I think we all were waiting for some Star Wars to be shown then, and we got nothing.

[15:52] And then the 40th anniversary of the film was in the end of May, and they missed that as well. So I think by the time we saw it, there's a little bit of fatigue in terms of our expectations were being called all over the place.

[16:06] When we finally saw it, though, you get one chance to make a first impression of your product. And remember we got it in this, like, it was like a video that came from Disney about...

[16:18] Like in a video, yeah.

[16:20] Yeah, it was like this weird, like, talk show sort of thing for eight minutes where they just showed some clips of the game. And so the first images we got were blurry screen grabs from YouTube video, which doesn't make any sense to me.

[16:33] Because if you're Stern, why don't you just release the Hyras images at the same time as that video, right? So we all had to like, squint our eyes and look at it for the first time.

[16:44] I would look like everybody else. I was underwhelmed by the art. We knew there were going to be restrictions, and Disney was going to be tough to work with.

[16:54] But, and this is a big, like, but. Why is it that wherever I see Star Wars art, whether it's comic books or Zen Pimball, it's amazing. And then the Stern version of the art layout just really looks sort of mediocre at best.

[17:13] So that brings up a good point. Do you think they were really stymied or handicapped by Disney itself? Because we see so much Star Wars crap that is interpreted in so many different ways, whether it be lunch boxes or kids or health family guy did a spoof on them. They had to allow that.

[17:32] So do you think they were really handicapped or do you think they were just trying to be efficient and true to the brand? Do you think that's a stern thing? It's Disney thing. I know it's both.

[17:41] But do you think they were as handicapped as much as they're saying or alluding to?

[17:46] All we can do is speculate, right? Because I don't know. I don't know what Disney said to them. I don't know what the deal was. I don't know what the contract was.

[17:55] But all I can say is I've seen other people do it much better. And if I were to make a guess, I would guess that Stern didn't want to spend the money to go get one of these amazing artists and let...

[18:09] Because if you go to Disney and say, look, this guy did your comic books. He's amazing. Can he draw our play field for us from the ground up?

[18:17] Because Pimbal deserves to be drawn from the ground up versus slapping pre-drawn stuff onto the play field. Because if you look at the art on the machine, it's existing. They just drew over photography. They took photographs and they hand drew over them.

[18:34] It's basically like sketching over a photograph. That's not an original concept, piece of Disney or Star Wars hand drawn artwork.

[18:43] So I think part of it was probably cost-cutting. I think the disappointing thing for everybody was we were told this game was two years in the making.

[18:52] Which is a long time to develop a game and it looks like the art was sort of slapped together in just a few weeks.

[18:59] That's right. And as much as we'll talk about code here in a minute, but as much as he put in that code, I don't doubt that damn thing.

[19:07] It was probably painstakingly working over, I think, to a deficit, unfortunately. But yeah, I don't see where all that development time went.

[19:16] So what were your first impressions of the gameplay? You pop up to this machine, you put a handful of games on it, and we're not rating quite yet. But what were your first thoughts when you start playing it?

[19:26] I played it a bunch of times at Jack Bar in Brooklyn, New York. And it's a richy pain. I mean, it flows nicely. It's fast. The game is really fast.

[19:36] And I was actually playing dialed in and Star Wars Pro back to back. And it literally made dialed in feel like it was in slow motion next to Star Wars Pro.

[19:45] So if you enjoy speed, if you enjoy flow, I think the game has a lot of that going for it.

[19:53] Obviously, by the time I got up to the machine, I'd already been disappointed by the art, disappointed by the toys. So it's like, oh, there's the tie fighter on the spring that I think looks really cheap. Now it's in front of me.

[20:06] I didn't sort of get blown away by any of the elements in the game itself. And I think the hardest thing when you step up to the game for the first time is understanding the rule set of the game.

[20:18] I just really get confused by stacking modes. And you literally can't understand what to do in the game by reading the apron card. You need someone there to explain it to you.

[20:30] Luckily for me, Crazy Levy was there when I played it for the first time and he was giving me a tutorial. But Crazy Levy can't be everywhere in America when people play this game.

[20:39] And I think that just putting an apron card on there is a joke in a self. They should just put, yeah, we can't fit all this shit onto an apron card.

[20:49] What's frustrating is we all know the Star Wars story, right? So if I walk up to a Star Wars machine, and I know there's a lot of debate about how to tell a narrative through Pimball, whether, you know, when Dwight did Ghostbusters and it was like, sequentially, how the movie unfolds.

[21:06] But if I walk up to Star Wars, I know the story. So when I begin the journey, I should kind of know where that journey begins because I'm familiar with it in the movies.

[21:16] But in this game, it's like, oh, the first thing I'm doing in Star Wars is combining Ewoks with like finding R2D 2's like two things that don't go together. And like this doesn't even make any sense.

[21:29] And then it's laid on top of each other and then you've got sounds and music clips from everywhere. So yeah, it becomes a lute on balloon.

[21:37] And you look at the screen, it's like, am I in an X-wing or am I in a lightsaber battle? It's really confusing. I just don't think they understand or understand how to put yourself in a character.

[21:52] And it's like, when I played Lord of the Rings, the reason I love the theme integration, I feel like I'm in those scenes in the movies and I can understand the sequencing of events where I play Star Wars is just a lot of things happening at once that just don't make sense to me.

[22:07] I completely agree. So what we're going to do now, guys, we're going to go to a gameplay, not really gameplay video, we're going to go to like an overview of the machine itself.

[22:16] Waspeneer is going to help us out with that show the shots layout, basic rules set. But again, if we did a rule set on this game, Greg, we hear forever. And I don't want to do that because quite frankly, I'm not a big.

[22:28] I like rules, but I don't like crazy ass multiplayer rules. So I wouldn't even be painstaking for me to have to go through and record that.

[22:36] So let's go to the gameplay video. Let's learn a little bit and see a little bit more about Star Wars. And then we'll come back.

[22:42] I'm Greg and I will review this. All right, guys, now you got to see what Star Wars is all about. Hopefully at this point in time, you guys have been able to see the machine, at least in person or a lot of high-res photos.

[22:53] We'll show those on the screen here as well. But get your hands on the Star Wars because our reviews are only one thing. We want you guys to play it and tell us more than likely, you know, you're going to tell us where we're right.

[23:03] But exactly. Who knows? Maybe you love the game. You think we're complete idiots. That happens quite frequently as well.

[23:11] So can they let's start with art, man? We'll kick it off to you. What do you think about the art package?

[23:17] Yeah, I mean, I just think it's mediocre. I'm probably in this sort of minority group where I consider Pimbal artwork to be super important.

[23:30] I think Pimbal machines are works of art and I think games should be as exciting to look at when they're off as they are to play when they're on.

[23:38] And again, because it's Star Wars, I think all of our reviews have to go through that filter, but it's Star Wars. So which demands things be the best possible thing.

[23:50] I think the arts mediocre, I think when I look at it, I just, to me, the one thing, this is like the new stern that just I can't get over it.

[24:00] Look at the pop bumpers on Simpson's Pimbal Party. They're the nuclear reactors, right? There's like this sense of like art is not just on the play field, but art is also the sculpting of the toys and the mechanisms.

[24:12] And on Star Wars, they're just dropping like landows face on a pop bumper that's flat with no depth, nothing.

[24:19] And I just feel like when I look at it, I don't get a sense of all the different universes and planets and scenes from the movie coming to life on the artwork itself.

[24:29] It's just a bunch of characters with the Millennium Falcon. I don't know. And there's so much blue. Like I just don't see blue as the color of the Star Wars universe.

[24:37] That's a good point. I mean, pop bumpers, lone look with Jersey Agade with the Hobbit with the barrels.

[24:42] Oh, yeah. I mean, just that kind of stuff or even Ghostbusters, like we've talked about before.

[24:47] Yeah. Just putting a damn plastic over those to create a world inside of the box there. And that's just a pop bumpers lone. For me, what screams to me, the play field, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.

[25:01] No, in person, I think it's a lot better than photos.

[25:04] I'm okay with it. My biggest pet peeve because the train's like it's fine. I like the train's like, for an LA, if I'm spending $9,000, give me a damn backlash.

[25:12] It's like stop doing that shit. That's ridiculous. But the cabinet art, like everybody hails this premium, right?

[25:19] But if you look at it, I hate how I want the cabinet to tell the story as well. I don't want one half to be part of a movie.

[25:28] And then the other has to be a stark different color combination. So you've got half and one thing with both of us.

[25:35] Then the then you're in mid-outer space on the other side of the cabinet. That's why I really like the LA cabinet art because it leases the Millennium Falcon in action on both sides.

[25:46] Yeah. When it comes to our page, translate some good with. I'm at where am I at? I'm at a beat. So I was higher than I thought I would be on this.

[25:54] Just because I love the back glasses. I'm good with the LA back glass, actually. Because I think you can do a lot behind the back glasses.

[26:02] So if it was a true mirrored back glass, which they should do again, you guys, this is freaking Star Wars.

[26:09] Star Wars. So you like the LA back glass with the characters backs to you and they're going into the last beat, right?

[26:18] I don't like it because it tells the story. At least it tells me a story. I don't have to have all this Photoshop characters everywhere.

[26:27] It's like, oh, I want the dark characters. I don't care. I want to tell a story. And to me, that hyper speed, and you've got the main characters right there.

[26:34] Oh, I think it's so plain. That's perfect.

[26:36] Imagine you're talking about that.

[26:37] No, I feel like the characters, like it's like they saw the Playfield artwork and they're jumping into light speed to get away from the pinball machine as fast as possible.

[26:46] I actually think the premium and the pro like back glasses are better. I think the LA package.

[26:56] I do like the Millennium Falcon. But that's the thing with this machine is I feel like each version of it has a compromise.

[27:04] And the LA, though, should be unanimously like that's the crime to look at. Like I think people would say to me, Ghostbusters, Ellie was like the greatest Ellie.

[27:13] It in terms of like it looked the part. I got why I would spend more on this. I don't think Star Wars has that same sort of confidence that this is the cremdle of a crem version.

[27:24] I completely great. Greg and I always say that Star Trek Ellie was the nicest and the greatest Stern Ellie. And then after that, nothing compares.

[27:33] So you have a thing like Star Trek, which is great. It's huge. It's no Star Wars. So why wouldn't you at minimum do with the treatment that you did with Stern Star Trek?

[27:44] That I don't know. The Playfield itself, the choices. I don't think they're great. That's why I'm going to be where you are.

[27:51] I'm going to see on it. I think it's average. It's an okay thing. Where you can see?

[27:54] I'm going to see as well. I think this game will go down as like a little bit better than Game of Thrones. A little bit better than you know, like we could talk about Richie and artwork too.

[28:06] Because like all of his themes, man, the art is always like the afterthought. And it's something that you'll hear over and over again. It's he'll give you the flow, but he won't give you the visual pop that people want with these themes.

[28:19] That's a good point. Do you think that's a Richie thing or do you think it's because he's given the themes that are huge that have the truth.

[28:27] Yes, because we don't see it from the other designers as much. I think I he's the designer. You know, we hear this a lot on the forums lately. It's like, who do you blame if a game comes out?

[28:39] It's not like one person of blame, but at the end of the day, the designer needs to take responsibility because it's his game.

[28:46] I'll go out on a limb and say the greatest designer that's also the best creative director of all time is John Papadude.

[28:53] He would never let that game come out looking like that. I just don't think that's Steve's thing.

[29:00] I just don't think he looks at Game of Thrones and says, we can't release this. We've got to go back.

[29:07] If it means to lay in the game, whatever, we can't release a bunch of cogs as the world of Game of Thrones.

[29:13] But he was okay with it on some level.

[29:15] But do you think he just gets stuck in gameplay and flow so much that he just says everything else?

[29:21] Yeah, it almost looks like it. People are saying this and I believe it. I feel like he designs the whitewood before even knowing what the theme is in a way.

[29:29] And you just put that theme over it.

[29:31] ACDC is the one where I really feel like it's ACDC. It's got the bell, it's got the can, and it's got...

[29:39] I feel that they really thought that through very nicely.

[29:42] If you put ACDC next to Star Wars and you say, which one did you intimately bring the world of that theme to life?

[29:51] It's like we're going backwards with a big theme.

[29:55] That's very true.

[29:57] Can I add a C? I'm going to be...

[29:59] I'm going to be...

[30:00] Let's talk about shots and layouts.

[30:02] So for shots and layouts, I'll kick this one off.

[30:05] It is very basic, Richie.

[30:08] I can take five Richie design games and I guarantee you I could put a Frankenstein together that is Star Wars.

[30:16] Now, shots and layouts, does it shoot good?

[30:19] It does shoot good really good.

[30:21] It's really fast.

[30:23] But is there any shot that is absolutely satisfying for me?

[30:27] It's the horseshoe orbit.

[30:29] I like that.

[30:30] Otherwise, I've got these same Richie ramps.

[30:33] And ramps are huge. I like a good nice John Papadouk swirly ass ramp that's doing something special.

[30:40] So for me, I was at a B.

[30:42] And I was at a B+.

[30:44] But I just like Richie. I like that blow.

[30:46] I like Star Wars a lot.

[30:48] I like Star Trek a lot.

[30:50] I like Spider-Man.

[30:51] I like a lot of that blow, but at the same time, I think it falls to the whole problem that both of those games fall to is those shots while they're satisfying in the beginning.

[31:01] It gets very old, very repetitive, and it gets very boring, very quick.

[31:06] Because you can just keep going.

[31:08] You can just keep going.

[31:09] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[31:10] The blow is nice and it's amazing at first and it feels good at first.

[31:12] But then I feel that it kind of loses its luster.

[31:15] And to add before you throw it over to Canada, one of the things I frickin' hate about Steve Richie is not because it's hard.

[31:21] Everybody's gonna be like, oh, it's good, it's hard.

[31:23] That stand-up drop, or it's not even a drop.

[31:25] The stand-up targets right in the middle of the play field.

[31:28] There is freaking nothing satisfying about that.

[31:32] There's just not. If you make them into drops or make them into drops that have at least God forbid targets behind them.

[31:37] Or maybe a pass through that goes into something.

[31:41] But the biggest part of your multipliers is three stand-up targets that do nothing.

[31:46] There's nothing satisfying about that show.

[31:48] Yeah.

[31:49] What do you think, Canada?

[31:50] Yeah, I think it flows really nice.

[31:52] I think it's fast.

[31:54] I would just say with a caveat, we're talking about the pro, right?

[31:58] So we don't know.

[31:59] Yeah.

[32:00] And we'll see tonight.

[32:01] They're gonna show the Ellie finally.

[32:03] What the hyperdrive, what the shot into the Death Star is.

[32:07] Because I do think the pro looks really stripped down.

[32:10] And the two main probably fun elements, which are hyperdrive and the shot into the Death Star,

[32:16] aren't available for us to review.

[32:18] But I don't think those are gonna add that much.

[32:21] Yeah.

[32:22] I don't know what they do that.

[32:23] No, because they're not interactive.

[32:25] I agree that the targets right below the LCD screen are really boring to shoot.

[32:33] I would love to see a lot more happen in terms of what the ball interacts with.

[32:38] And I think the main thing I keep harping on is Star Wars is a story about using the Force.

[32:45] And how do you not have magnets, Force Grab the Ball?

[32:48] For me, with that missing, I just don't feel like stuff is happening in the game physically

[32:54] that feels like I'm going through the Star Wars universe.

[32:58] I feel like I'm going through a pinball universe and pinball flow is happening.

[33:02] And so much of it is about rolling the ball over lights and switches.

[33:06] But not, it's not dropping me into the world of like Endor, Tatooine or Dagobah.

[33:12] And that's what I want to feel more on the play field.

[33:15] And I think they relegated so much of that to just the LCD screen.

[33:19] Which my belief is, Storm doesn't really know how to incorporate LCD yet with properties like this.

[33:25] They're still learning.

[33:27] Yeah, well, and that's what I think that that's where like even though Star Trek was so stripped down and everything.

[33:34] And the play field is actually kind of bland when you look at it.

[33:37] I still felt that it kind of, if you watch those Star Trek films, it's still kind of encompassed in a way the feeling of Star Trek in a sense,

[33:45] especially with the warp rampant and the callouts and the sounds sort of matched.

[33:49] And it was just that clean play field that kind of fit a clean spaceship like they had their uniforms, the colors, everything.

[33:56] And so it still kind of is bears what that play field was.

[34:00] It was still integrated a lot better than what this did.

[34:05] It had a third flip or so you're adding some shots.

[34:07] Yeah.

[34:08] Just on shots and layout on Star Wars, I don't feel like I'm interacting with any shots.

[34:11] Like I know pop-a-duc is pop-a-duc.

[34:14] But I was playing a theater with Magic the other day, right?

[34:17] And there's so much going on that is magical.

[34:20] You don't like the, just the vanish shot where a simple diverter puts it into like a little scoop or a saucer

[34:26] and it holds it there and then kicks it out when you're not expecting it.

[34:29] That's the kind of stuff that you put into the greatest theme of all time for a pinball.

[34:34] Yeah.

[34:35] I think a good way to think about it is if I'm going to invite someone over that doesn't know pinball.

[34:40] And I say I want to show you two magical shots that are going to wow you.

[34:45] Yeah.

[34:46] Even just one magical shot.

[34:48] So like Aerosmith, whenever people see the ball being flung into the toy box, that's freaking cool.

[34:53] Yeah.

[34:54] Who Dany, when the ball's fired three freaking feet into that lock box, amazing.

[35:01] Yeah.

[35:02] What is Star Wars?

[35:03] Got nothing.

[35:04] It's got a tie fighter on a spring, a bunch of dropped targets that are stolen from ACDC and an LCD screen.

[35:11] So there's just like nothing there.

[35:13] And the life of me, I can't understand why there's no like force grabbing of the ball.

[35:17] And that's what's weird because even if you were a location, if you put a model in location,

[35:21] that's the stuff that would grab you and keep you around playing.

[35:24] And it feels like just solely relied on the theme to pull people in even if you take collectors aside and everything else and you're talking about routing.

[35:31] I mean, it was beautiful artwork that pulled you in, beautiful back glass or translate that would pull you there.

[35:36] And then cool neat shots, gimmicks as well to help you there were the, that's why the pinball's had.

[35:41] And this doesn't have anything to keep you there.

[35:43] The problem is, is real simple.

[35:45] They are designing these games for tournament players who could care less about any of that stuff.

[35:51] They don't like the randomness.

[35:53] I was talking to someone the other day about the EMP mode and dialed in, which I think is one of the coolest modes in pinball history.

[36:01] There's like, it feels like there's eight magnets underneath the dialed in play field.

[36:05] And it, the EMP mode when that fires, it throws the ball all over the place.

[36:09] I love it.

[36:11] Tournament players hate it.

[36:13] They skip it. They don't want it because it might throw the ball down the middle.

[36:17] And I think that's the problem is this machine, Star Wars machine is made with the code it's made for tournament players who want to understand how to stack that complex mode set, understand the rules.

[36:30] And look, we're getting people scoring 40 billion points.

[36:33] What does it mean? 40 billion relative to like two billion.

[36:37] It's just you lose people.

[36:39] And here's the thing.

[36:41] Why would Stern focus on making a tournament game though?

[36:45] I don't, with Star Wars that is so, so broad to the masses that, you know, it's something that's happened over the last few years.

[36:54] And this is just my, and my speculation is the most vocal people on the forums are the tournament players per se.

[37:02] Like crazy Levitt, good friend.

[37:04] The feedback they get is, is incorporated a lot by these developers and these coders.

[37:12] I mean, look at the coders.

[37:13] Like, these guys are in the tournaments.

[37:15] Like, they want to make games that have depth.

[37:17] But I think they want to make more of the depth happen in terms of how to score.

[37:22] See, I just, for a lot of the collectors out there, I enjoy going through the modes and getting to the end of the game.

[37:28] Like, in Todeon, I love beating the genie.

[37:30] I don't really, does anyone really care what your score is when you destroy the ring and lower the rings or get to there and back again?

[37:36] It's not really about the score.

[37:38] And, you know, it's like when you play Mario Brothers on Nintendo, just getting, beating Bowser is so rewarding.

[37:44] No one's like, oh, but I scored this.

[37:47] So it's a juggling act.

[37:50] And right now I think Stern is doing too much to emphasize scoring and code and not enough to emphasize the magic on the play field itself.

[37:59] And that's why I thought at least Ghostbusters, it was kind of a twofold in a sense because you still had a really good journey had very good modes.

[38:07] But also you could kind of blow up the scoring on it if you focused on that.

[38:11] Or they kind of went hand in hand.

[38:13] But it wasn't it wasn't.

[38:14] No, it was no, no, no, no, no.

[38:16] No, no, Max is going to be what?

[38:17] Six times play field.

[38:19] Yeah.

[38:20] Star Wars, we're dealing with frickin' 40 times.

[38:22] Well, that's what I'm saying. Ghostbusters was kind of a double a sword.

[38:25] You could either go for points if you wanted to.

[38:26] you wanted to yeah it was kind of a two twofold thing

[38:28] and the audience knows that Greg and I are both big ghost

[38:32] busters fans I think that that game in itself people rip it

[38:36] I get it I get why they were yeah but for me it's one of the

[38:39] greatest games ever made because it is the theme is 100%

[38:43] it hits 100% the gameplay is linear it tells me a story

[38:47] there's wizard modes albeit they suck there are wizard

[38:52] modes to obtain and you get the art package you get the

[38:55] different call outs they did there so I don't I just

[38:59] those those posters is what pinball used to be in five minutes

[39:03] you're loving it yeah and look if they could have not had the

[39:07] flipper gap and the cheap drains in the outlets there's a

[39:10] couple things that I think make that game it's like so fun and

[39:13] so frustrating at the same time it could have been the perfect

[39:16] stern pinball machine of all time but I just still thought

[39:20] that ghost busters would be the new benchmark for them and

[39:23] that we keep improving upon that kind of game and I again I

[39:26] look at Star Wars as a huge step back from what stern game is

[39:30] with ghost busters there's nobody that could argue that it

[39:32] isn't that's just a fact look at those string of games you had

[39:36] I mean you know with ghost busters you had walking dead and

[39:39] you have I mean like they like they release some of the

[39:41] mentality yeah you release some of the best games that

[39:44] there were and it's like you said now they're they're almost

[39:46] going back to when you had Harley Davidson and think

[39:49] about Hunter and like yeah that sort of stuff I go I don't think

[39:53] those may be a little bit CSC side makes Star Wars look

[39:56] barren I mean there's at least fun stuff to do in CSI you

[40:02] got to go the microscope it's more in more innovation in that

[40:05] than this guess the tie fighter on the spring that's right so

[40:08] can they don't when you're when we're talking about shots and

[40:10] layout what kind of grade do you think you I mean on the pro

[40:14] right now I mean I would give shot layout I would give it a B-minus

[40:19] just because of the lack of interaction with the ball with toys

[40:22] and max now we we know that the premium Ellie is going to have

[40:27] that gimmick shot let's just hope whenever we see the gameplay of it

[40:31] that it's not just one ball going around and that's it let's hope

[40:35] because that I'll tell you what with the getaway he did have a

[40:40] shot in that supercharger that changed the game yeah whenever I

[40:45] have people walk up to that machine whenever I had one I had

[40:48] people I made sure they got to that supercharger because their faces lit

[40:52] up that was a wild factor that was a magical moment if he can

[40:55] that off with this and it's not just some you know just one lap around

[41:00] and that's it or if you can't get them all going at once I think he's

[41:04] failed in that gimmick yeah that's the big question is will it be a ball lock

[41:08] or not yeah yeah we think we'll find we'll find out tonight we'll

[41:13] find out tonight we will everything we've heard so far that it is not a

[41:16] ball lock at all so you're the

[41:19] we've already kind of touched on this but rules go in go with the

[41:24] second rules yeah what do you think oh man my rules I had to give it a

[41:27] see I thought it was very me and it was just because of the the multipliers

[41:31] and everything like I just don't I don't really care for that it's it's a

[41:33] deep game but then I also don't like being able to run everything at one

[41:37] time it's it's confusing and it's it's odd I again like just more of a

[41:41] straight set path or just something easier to to to fall under

[41:48] I'm just confused I don't like the shit out of it I don't want to think about it

[41:53] so hard like I want to have fun yeah what are you thinking where you at on rules

[41:57] yeah just I don't understand them it's sort of like asking me to review a movie

[42:03] that's in another language yeah what I do know is I've been reading a lot of

[42:10] really good players say this game's gone too far with multipliers the

[42:16] stacking of scenes from the movie makes absolutely no sense it feels like I

[42:20] get it in game of Thrones because game of Thrones is a story about houses

[42:24] uniting and forming allegiances and it made sense that makes no sense in

[42:29] Star Wars and I think Dwight I mean Stern's been doing this a lot right like

[42:33] just completely copying pasting the the framework of a code from one game to

[42:39] another we saw it with kiss and erosmith right where like even in the code

[42:46] itself it was saying kiss when it was an erosmith game at the very early stages

[42:50] so I would give the code right now again because I think the code could be

[42:56] so much better I would give it a C for confusing yeah I love that I love that

[43:03] what I would say about the code I'm I'm a little bit nicer I'm gonna be

[43:08] plus and I'll tell you why because I want to give all the bitch and he's done

[43:13] about it right he's a bee plus we can't say it's not deep pinball players want

[43:22] deep I want deep code I just don't need it to be stacked I'm giving a bee

[43:27] plus because what the work that Dwight Sullivan did put it put into it you can

[43:32] tell he was trying to make this thing oh yeah he's been he put his heart it's

[43:35] he did there are there are multiple modes there are multiple many wizard

[43:40] modes there's a grand the large wizard mode there are multi balls the code

[43:45] itself it's hard for me to go anywhere below a bee plus because of how much

[43:49] work he put into it the the the difference is it would have been an A plus

[43:54] code all he would have had to do he could still do this is stop stacking the

[43:59] modes make me and it's gonna be a tougher game make me get through each mode

[44:03] independently like Lord of the Rings getting the Valor or something it should be

[44:07] hard to do I shouldn't be able to this won't like about Simpson's pinball party

[44:10] just stack all the damn things you know what's going on yeah spreading the

[44:13] part lower the multipliers to maybe two three times most let me go through

[44:18] this story even if it's not sequential like Ghostbusters linearity between

[44:23] Ghostbusters you can start different modes because we all know the story of

[44:26] Star Wars yeah but I can't go below be my B plus just because there's a lot of

[44:31] work and I think Dwight Sullivan has raised his game over the last five years

[44:36] when it comes to coding yeah game of thrones was pretty good code I think the

[44:42] Ghostbusters for me personally it was a really good code yeah it still needs

[44:46] to be tweaked a little bit the wizard most suck and stuck glitches but I'm gonna

[44:50] be plus for the most I'm gonna be asking about code because obviously there is a

[44:55] checklist of things that people want when they play pinball wizard modes

[44:59] multiples all that stuff but the route where what separates like good code

[45:03] from great code is emotion like what do you do feel like the coder brought you

[45:09] into the world right we hear it all the time with hoard mode and walking dead

[45:12] and how to that one mode like transports you to a special place same way with

[45:18] like there and back again and that's what's missing for me right now I mean

[45:21] caveat being this is only code what like point eight seven so there's more code

[45:26] to come but I do feel a lack of emotional sort of grip in the way the code is

[45:34] right now and I think the stacking makes it hard the multipliers make it hard

[45:37] and the way the code is unfolding right now just is this a little sort of

[45:42] sterile if I can use a word like that let's not let's not kid ourselves I know

[45:47] we're saying is point eight seven and all but can we know that this isn't gonna

[45:51] go look at their history over it's never get done it may never get done

[45:56] no he's not gonna add anything significant enough like these large wizard

[46:01] modes are that's not gonna have but you but you just said you would love it to be

[46:05] the you know unless stacking like we all know they're not gonna do any of that

[46:09] they're not gonna do any of that so that's why I think we you know we always

[46:13] bring our expectations to how they could polish but they just say rarely

[46:17] polish like Lyman polish is but that takes like forever in a day yeah that's

[46:22] right that's right I think the last great coded game was the walking dead and I

[46:26] don't think anybody's gonna put that much effort because of how many machines are

[46:29] being cranked out you know Gomez once three cornerstones he wants to remake

[46:33] anyone's a boutique every single year I like that they're bringing more games out

[46:38] but at the same time I feel like that it's hindering them yeah why not just make

[46:42] two great games a year versus four games I take forever to finish either that

[46:47] or man I don't care if you make ten damn games hire some more fricking coders

[46:52] yeah so special about these guys that they can't oversee or supervise a group of

[46:57] coders that they just freelance in I don't care what it's taking it'll pay

[47:01] these guys much all the good coders are making mobile games and video games

[47:05] those guys are making duckets I think they'll honestly don't understand how

[47:10] little Steve Richie makes you know it's like these guys aren't making a ton of

[47:16] money and Stern is you know they're all about the margins these days and there's

[47:21] great coders out there but not for eighty five thousand dollars or not you said

[47:26] but you said it great on one of your podcasts and it's you said that I don't

[47:30] want to you know miss miss term but you said that most of the people in the

[47:35] hobby that have these large collections make a lot more money than the

[47:38] designers themselves that are designing the game yeah I mean I hang out a bunch

[47:42] of dudes that are wealthier than Gary Stern and George Gomez I mean the margins

[47:47] in Pimple are not great I mean per machine sold I would be surprised if Stern

[47:52] makes maybe a thousand again oh come on can you think it's only that maybe

[47:57] fifteen hundred I mean see here's a thing though delays eat away at it

[48:00] everything eats away at the profit so maybe two thousand I mean look now that

[48:04] they're charging nine thousand yes yeah and for Batman super Ellie they just

[48:09] like Gary was laughing to the bank on that game all the way but as I as I said

[48:15] on a couple podcasts ago when you look at Star Wars Ellie over the premium it's

[48:20] literally like you're giving Stern a million dollars and they're not giving you

[48:25] anything else so that's a that's where the profit lies with them it's it's the

[48:29] alcohol and the dessert of a restaurant where they make all the money yeah very

[48:33] like that's a good analogy so move it moving on into poison innovations which

[48:37] again we've got a touch on and it's kind of a even more strip down mess I

[48:42] guess yeah where where you get connected with your poison innovations on it can

[48:47] give a D to a game or I'm giving it I'm giving it a D I'll get the reason why

[48:52] is they've got three movies of the most amazing things to bring the life and

[48:57] the fact that there's no Han Solo in carbonite there's no raising the X-wing

[49:03] from you know in Dagobah there's no force training there's no physical

[49:07] lightsabers clashing in the game there's nothing the hyperdrive you don't even

[49:14] see the hyperdrive in the movie yeah and and it's not a pivotal moment of the

[49:21] film yes they're always trying to escape into light speed but man that's just like

[49:26] the stopgap moment of those films it's not like the iconic emotional moments so

[49:30] I just think with everything they had to work with if Steve Richie walked into my

[49:34] office and I'm George Gomez and he's like you know the main feature is gonna be a

[49:37] hyperdrive I'm gonna be like no it's not it's gonna be the emperors chamber it's

[49:42] gonna be Luke and Darth Vader are gonna have lightsaber battles no it's not go

[49:46] back to the drawing board yeah yeah very true we agree I mean my my

[49:51] poison innovation was to see minus I couldn't I wouldn't far off from you I I

[49:55] there was just nothing there that that tie fighter the tie fighter was a little

[49:59] better in person than what I thought it was gonna be but it's still just a

[50:02] toy on a spring yeah it's literally a bubble hit on my dashboard and

[50:07] and that that just kind of drives me crazy that you would stick that in there

[50:10] and then like you said the the hyperdrive like that's yeah that's what why

[50:16] does it why doesn't the Death Star laser like fire out yeah like it's just

[50:21] lights yeah it's it's lasers are cheap yeah oh yeah yeah and that's what like

[50:27] what I don't get is people complain about when the Jetsons come out about how

[50:32] that there just wasn't anything going on on the Jetsons and toys and stuff and

[50:36] they ended up spooky went back in and they added more toys than what Star Wars

[50:40] has on there honestly at least they took the critique and said we you know

[50:44] we got to we got to populate play field with a couple of little boys and

[50:48] visuals at least and and there's nothing on this game yeah and for me I'm at

[50:52] a I'm at a suit of man I'm at a sea and for me the sea comes from just the

[50:59] idea of I know we're right in the pro but the the hyperspace regardless of how

[51:04] it works it is still there I do like Stern's use of LCD now like an

[51:11] aerospace myth and Star Wars now for me personally I like the videos that

[51:16] end up showing up in the LCD I just think they're they're crowded because of

[51:20] the stacking but I like I even like kill me but I like the small LCD screen all

[51:26] like that I like it I don't think it's integrated no it's not used at all yeah

[51:30] but you guys a question the the quality though right when those movie clips play

[51:34] compared to the quality of movie clips when the hobbit plays scenes it's like I

[51:40] don't understand it's like Stern is like it's not even doesn't even look like HD

[51:43] no I think Jersey Jack machines when it comes to LCD is art yeah I think this is

[51:48] more just a toy well yeah indeed you can consider that to me it's just

[51:52] display I don't I don't other than the small it's in the thing I don't

[51:56] innovation that's true and if we're talking about innovation the sound we'll

[52:02] talk about here in a little bit but just the package is good as well there are

[52:07] dropped targets I'm gonna see I'm gonna see I'm gonna see you can you

[52:11] consider innovation just because Jersey Jack came out with it before I mean

[52:15] that's like you know when you bought Alexis 10 years ago you had to feel

[52:19] it's starting everything else now Kia hasn't so you're gonna go to Kia and

[52:22] be like damn they're innovative no they just finally upgraded but for

[52:26] Kia they are yeah I'm still not innovation but I'm gonna argue to that that

[52:31] that LCD on the play field is is indicative of a lack of in an innovation

[52:37] creativity like it is like we're just dropping a screen here like it's not even

[52:43] framed it's not even like it's it has no point other than to just put stuff

[52:51] that could either be on the screen in the back box area and that to me that

[52:54] takes up real estate where there could have been a physical mechanism without

[52:59] a doubt that hold that area with the pop bumpers and then stand up some

[53:02] like yeah damn that could have been a cool interactive toy right there out of

[53:06] everything wrong with the machine the toys and innovations is what

[53:08] depresses me and hurts me the most but that's richy right richy doesn't he'd

[53:13] never if you look at most of his games toys and anything that slows down the

[53:18] action to him I think is contrary and to how he likes to design and it's not

[53:23] like a knock again so I mean some people you know if you have three games in

[53:26] your collection you might want to have an iron man next to a tot in and then

[53:29] you're happy because you got the best of both worlds so that's right but do you

[53:34] think they meant do you think they missed it choosing richy for this thing I just

[53:38] don't see yeah yeah ever everyone would have loved borrower Trudeau to take a

[53:43] swing at Star Wars and if we're honest I would have preferred Jersey Jack

[53:49] make this game oh I mean and I hate that I hate that that's the default now

[53:55] however but it's just like I'd rather have Jersey Jack make the good things

[53:59] because they make a better machine I hate that because I do like stern pinball

[54:02] can I know you like stern pinball as well but it's true yeah look

[54:09] not nine thousand dollars versus nine thousand dollars I mean I've said it many

[54:14] times I was telling you guys before I think stern makes the world's best

[54:16] six thousand dollar machines and the world's worst nine thousand dollar machines

[54:19] and if I can go get dialed in for the same price I mean you got to be

[54:23] got to be smoking some stuff to think dialed it doesn't have more value that's

[54:29] completely right so we're at seasoned D's on Toys and Innovation let's talk about

[54:32] music and call outs I'll kick this one off so for me music you guys are gonna

[54:37] butcher me on this one I've got an A I think music and call outs first off when I

[54:41] hear John William score start and that's probably about the only time it starts

[54:46] is the beginning game yeah but there is nothing more satisfying than hearing

[54:50] that score there's not enough of it in the game yeah this is why it's not a

[54:54] plus for me but it is there I do have some call outs I've got some video that

[54:59] has the call outs from Luke Skywalker and Han Solo it's enough for me when I

[55:05] played the game I thought this sounds very pleasing to me yeah and I gave a

[55:10] little bit less I gave it a B plus just for those exact same reasons but that

[55:15] was it but there was nothing unique I don't know I wanted some unique call outs

[55:19] or something that was yeah but what are they gonna do you think they're really

[55:22] gonna get Mark Hamill to do call outs for this you never know there's a lot of

[55:28] work you know look he comes at a price so he probably would do it if you

[55:33] paid him I would give it a B plus because I think like John Williams is an A

[55:38] plus like it's the greatest score of all time in terms of movies and you know

[55:44] so it's turned it and have anything to do with that so it's amazing the call

[55:48] outs look I think call outs also come as code develops there's definitely

[55:52] stuff in there now but not getting original call outs I think is always hurt

[55:58] these big franchises because some of Stern's previous titles had actors from

[56:04] the movies provide some amazing call outs and so you know I look I think Mark

[56:10] Hamill would have done it if Stern ponyed up the dollar but he's probably super

[56:14] expensive right now but you know look the music's great and I agree like when

[56:19] that theme song's playing there's no better way to attract someone new machine

[56:22] on that so you can find somebody else so awards I mean they got the hand for

[56:26] Game of Thrones they got what was the the doctor character on the

[56:30] journey Hudson for Ghostbusters you know you're at a B plus I'm in an A

[56:40] Greg's at a B plus from using call outs let's move on to theme so this is a

[56:46] little caveat here canator when we rank themes on this show we do the theme

[56:52] itself of the pinball machine that is dialed in as a theme Star Wars as a

[56:57] theme not so much the integration because we can all agree the integration sucks

[57:02] we'll talk about that but with the purposes here we're for themes Greg and I

[57:07] are both at an A plus for the theme of Star Wars itself talk about that for

[57:11] yourself yeah I need to know what you guys gave full throttle for us before I

[57:14] answer this question we have a review full throttle you full throttle

[57:18] full throttle theme wise I would go to an F on the scale I'd go with to a D

[57:23] D this isn't this is an A plus for sure this is the biggest theme in the

[57:30] history of themes and you know obviously integration we have different

[57:33] feelings on that but A plus for sure okay so let's talk about the

[57:37] integration you've said it numerous times I've said it numerous times on video

[57:41] this is literally a Steve Richie game and then they put a skin on it that was

[57:46] a Star Wars there's no real integration into the game itself it's like

[57:51] Canadian said about the remote it's it lacks that emotion you know it it seems

[57:56] like that it was just I want to make this deep tough game or maybe tough but I

[58:01] just want to make this deep game and it seems like all the passion went into

[58:04] that with with the integration of the theme as a very much of an afterthought

[58:08] right if you look at like the data east Star Wars and again I think with a

[58:12] pinball machine and integration when the machines off I want to be able to

[58:16] look down be like oh man I can't wait to shoot that I can't wait to see what

[58:19] the ball does when it goes there I don't need a game has any of that and and

[58:23] that's a shame I think they had so much to work with you know whether it's

[58:28] lower playfields upper playfields magnets something and it just really is

[58:35] coming up short for me on the integration so just because it's like you

[58:39] said it's just all pinball shots it's just all pinball machine there's

[58:44] nothing that that seems specific to Star Wars it's just it's just beautiful

[58:49] flowy shots with a lot of speed and it's just nothing that says Star it's a

[58:56] pinball machine yeah it's like it's overlay so as we're looking at let's talk

[59:00] about value so the grading system is over we'll talk about composites here in a

[59:05] minute but value can you find what can you find a pro price we got $5,200 for a

[59:12] pro yeah 53 52 then yeah the premium is what 73 yeah we're going to sell it

[59:20] $8,500 street price for the LE yeah so what is it is there value there

[59:26] Canadian you know it's it's it's a good question I wouldn't buy one on any

[59:33] trim level and just because it doesn't excite me and these things are all

[59:39] getting really expensive and I think if I were to buy one I would buy the premium

[59:44] I think the premium is the way to go because I do think the pros really strip

[59:48] down I don't I do think the hyperdrive and death star shots will at least add

[59:53] something more because it needs more it's it's just I would get so bored with

[59:57] the pros so quickly I'm shocked at the amount of people buying the pro it's

[01:00:01] weird to me that people have like 5,300 but not like 7,300 for such a

[01:00:07] unnecessary item it's weird it's like it's like buying a hundred thousand

[01:00:12] hour car and then not getting like the headrest upgrade for five-hundred

[01:00:15] bucks you know it's just it's weird I just think go with like the that the one

[01:00:19] that has all the features if you can get it at the best price I think the

[01:00:22] Ellie value is laughable the fact they took out the shaker no back glass no no

[01:00:31] topper you know because here's what Stern's gonna do now you're gonna go be

[01:00:35] able to get the topper for an extra 500 they're gonna sell a kit for the

[01:00:39] Ellie that makes the lights in the back box look like it's going to hyperdrive

[01:00:42] that'll be another few hundred bucks the the railing on the sides don't light

[01:00:46] up the way Star Trek did you know you just go down a list of what you used to

[01:00:51] get is now removed but the price has gone up and it's hard to support a

[01:00:55] company doing that and then we we were talking about dialed in and again both

[01:01:01] games are available new in box right now today I don't know how you would choose

[01:01:07] Star Wars over dialed in in terms of value no and just like they're making this

[01:01:12] new glass right this non-reflective glass for the love of everything pinball

[01:01:16] put the damn chick you know they're getting that glass cheap put the damn yeah no

[01:01:22] what didn't the look I don't see how anybody can buy a stern it this is this is

[01:01:26] bold but I apologize I don't see how anybody can buy a stern Ellie going

[01:01:30] forward without limited limited edition features a topper is a must a shaker is a

[01:01:36] must armor is a must that damn glass that they just created is a fricking must

[01:01:41] and a bag glass that is an elite it those all Steve Richie's not even signing

[01:01:47] the play field now it's a cheap piece of paper that they're sticking on the

[01:01:50] apron what to me it's you know it's the little things it's the little things

[01:01:54] that collapse empires and that to me is like leaking water it you how can you

[01:02:00] get that lazy because the whole point is I want to know that the artist

[01:02:05] signed the actual thing they they could have just mailed Richie 800 pieces of

[01:02:11] paper and he could assign those things in in like the Philippines for all I know

[01:02:16] and then they'll them back yeah so a play field Richie it's cheap it's cheap

[01:02:22] and they're like I've been calling them out on it and I look the fact that

[01:02:26] Star Wars Ellie's are still available to buy from a distributor says all we need

[01:02:33] to know about stern went too far this time with removing value from the game

[01:02:37] but hold up but not I don't think it's just this time can I think is progressively

[01:02:42] getting worse I don't it's not just a this time thing because the last game we

[01:02:47] had what arrow smith that was lacking features that didn't have a shaker did

[01:02:52] it did arrow smith have a shaker I don't know it's a real back glass yeah it's

[01:02:58] certainly didn't come with the topper like Jersey jacks even it certainly didn't

[01:03:02] come with that damn reflective but this was even worse like because at least on

[01:03:06] some things like Ghostbusters things and and arrow smith like you you had a

[01:03:09] decent jump between a pro and a premium whereas this there's there's just

[01:03:16] not a jump between all three of them that that's worth very much and that's

[01:03:21] what makes the Ellie even more lackluster and tonight's gonna be

[01:03:25] interesting because to me the hyperdrive is gonna either

[01:03:31] satiate people and or everyone's gonna bail it's it's gonna be a very fun

[01:03:38] night because if it's lackluster my my my my hunches it's not that great and

[01:03:44] that's why they haven't shown any footage yet because they don't want everyone

[01:03:47] to bail on their Ellie orders because a lot of people have passed the point of

[01:03:52] refunds from distributors because they were told you know after this date the

[01:03:58] money's locked in and Stern's never had a great aid title that's sort of you

[01:04:06] know people have wanted to get out the 11th hour like this like Star Wars like

[01:04:09] Batman sold out Ghostbusters sold out they've got 800 Ellie's they need to sell

[01:04:13] not not 240 not 400 but if we're talking about what's gonna come in the Ellie

[01:04:19] and that gimmick at the end of the day I don't care if that damn gimmick is the

[01:04:23] coolest thing you've ever seen you still go with the premium yeah right

[01:04:27] yeah totally so what do you think let me let me ask you this is it what do you

[01:04:35] think Stern will do if they do not sell those Ellie's and they're still

[01:04:39] going to sell alone do you think they'll sell because the other side of the

[01:04:45] hobby is the pinball buyer which has proven time and time again to be

[01:04:52] dumber than Stern because they buy before even seeing something they buy

[01:04:57] before they even like the fear of missing out I've never seen a hobby like this

[01:05:02] where people go all in and they don't even know what their cards are imagine

[01:05:06] playing poker I've even given you three cards yet or five cards and you go all

[01:05:10] in every time and that's the way a lot of these new inbox collectors are but I'll

[01:05:14] say this people are running at a room and they're running out of money and I can

[01:05:20] feel the pivot happening people are starting to realize it's not worth it

[01:05:23] let me call this right I mean I'm looking to attack from Mars remake how much is

[01:05:28] that Ellie what is it like seven grand yeah about eight close to eight eight

[01:05:33] close eight I mean that pin is proven to be great they've improved it on every

[01:05:38] level but you get a unique topper that's the top is amazing you can't buy that

[01:05:42] aftermarket you're buying that Ellie and that's the only way you're getting that

[01:05:45] damn top or otherwise you don't get one that's that's an elite one compared to

[01:05:49] that if stern made a top or that interactive in that detail they'd be a thousand

[01:05:53] dollars oh yeah that's exactly right which people would easily pay so is it

[01:05:59] Stern's fault I mean it is Stern working for the hobbyist at this point

[01:06:04] unfortunately I'll think that's the case no but are they still getting the money

[01:06:09] that they need to get by Nicklin diamond everybody because they know their market

[01:06:12] is gonna buy the shit anyway I think so it's you know I I do feel like there's

[01:06:17] finally some competition right and for the for the last few years I mean let's

[01:06:24] be honest nothing really came out that was opposed to Lebowski never came out

[01:06:28] alien never came out you know Hobbit didn't really come out medieval madness

[01:06:34] was delayed for forever you know there really wasn't I've got ten grand here

[01:06:38] where can I go get a pinball machine in a box you know spooky games are still

[01:06:43] sort of trying to get to a good level I think people aren't super impressed just

[01:06:48] yet I think there's good stuff to come but right now there's competition for

[01:06:53] Stern and I begaren to you Star Wars will not sell as well as they projected a

[01:07:00] year ago oh of course no yeah of course not but I'll tell you what something like

[01:07:05] what's really intriguing me tell me what you think about American pinball

[01:07:08] Sudanese because I've played it and it's a pretty awesome game that right now

[01:07:14] if if I wanted to buy a brand new game I don't really want to pay nine grand for

[01:07:19] the dialed in it's just a little bit over the budget that I'd like to spend but

[01:07:22] a seven thousand dollars for a Houdini or seven thousand dollars in a Star Wars

[01:07:26] premium I don't think there's another game out there that I'd like to

[01:07:31] as long as that game comes out and it works and it's proven I've played it works

[01:07:36] if I'm sitting in a long term yeah you know as long as it comes out and

[01:07:39] there's there's no major problems with it I I think in my opinion it's gonna be

[01:07:43] a success it's gonna be it's gonna be that next notch that's gonna hurt Stern

[01:07:48] even more because there's another manufacturer in Chicago like spooky like

[01:07:52] J.J.P. then with no the hea money yeah right but I would say this and this is

[01:07:57] what we we fall into this trap right as fans of pinball yeah manufacturing is

[01:08:03] the is the hurdle and American pinball last time I've seen photos inside

[01:08:09] there looks nothing like Jersey Jack it looks nothing like the big factory that

[01:08:13] Andrew highway tried to build how many games can they make and in what

[01:08:17] volume Stern makes 50 games like a week maybe more right like it's they they

[01:08:24] their assembly line is humongous they've always got games rolling out they're

[01:08:28] still making like Metallica's they're still making you know Batman's Ghost

[01:08:32] Busters like they've got eight titles that they're shipping at any one time so I

[01:08:37] hope American pinball can get production down and that's what it's gonna come

[01:08:41] come down to because if people get frustrated waiting they're not gonna wait

[01:08:45] because there's just so much new stuff and come October Stern's gonna show

[01:08:51] Guardians of the Galaxy or Deadpool I mean by the time Houdini comes out that's

[01:08:56] my only concern is that they showed it too early they showed it too early I you

[01:09:00] as a marketer you never show your product like nine months ahead like what I

[01:09:05] it's the type is hype you need like look at McGregor Mayweather like they're

[01:09:10] just hyping it like it's gonna suck but you hype it right before you know so

[01:09:16] that I go spend the $80 like you have a game right before comes out that's what I

[01:09:20] feel J.J.P finally got right with Dalton at least was that there wasn't a

[01:09:23] gigantic weight like the hop in everything yeah and and and same thing hopefully

[01:09:28] spooky gets you know I'll show their games up quick yeah and it ought to be out

[01:09:34] quick so yeah that it is a very important lesson there's too many games coming

[01:09:39] out I said like there are more games for this than I feel like there are

[01:09:43] Nintendo switch titles and there's millions and a tent of switch owners because

[01:09:47] that is the one thing that Stern gets right other than than this game being

[01:09:50] delayed and delayed delayed a little bit but it was still a brief delay in the

[01:09:55] scheme of things but I mean you look at Aerosmith when it got leaked and

[01:09:58] everything and then by the time that it was starting to ship and everything

[01:10:01] like that that's one thing that at least Stern seems to have down is that we

[01:10:05] we show a game or we leak a few things and then two months later it's shipping

[01:10:10] right so you're still kind of on the hype right I think look Stern is Stern has

[01:10:16] manufacturing down all Stern needs to do all they need to do is get some new

[01:10:22] young designers in there up the quality of some of their materials and they

[01:10:27] would put everybody out of business everybody overnight there's no way anyone

[01:10:32] can compete with the volume and the manufacturing and the themes they have

[01:10:35] locked up but because they don't do those things the opportunity is open for

[01:10:41] competition yeah that's right that's right all right well we could probably talk

[01:10:46] about this forever if we're talking about our composites our composites Greg

[01:10:50] score came out for Star Wars to be a B minus my score came out to be a B I'm

[01:10:57] gonna 3.22 year 2.72 not a check on that and then Canada's came out as a C

[01:11:03] plus a 2.5 so what do you think about that C plus you go with that yeah I mean I

[01:11:10] don't like the game so C plus is it sounds even like too nice but yeah

[01:11:19] about our ratings is they're all weighted the same theme is weighted the same as

[01:11:24] rules and there's pros and cons that we always found like this is probably the

[01:11:28] best way to do a comparison that they can't knock theme is it being a way

[01:11:32] wrong because I mean you take there's gonna be some of you people to buy it

[01:11:35] because it is Star Wars yeah but my point is who's to say that are equals as

[01:11:38] much as rules or something like that everybody I would argue you take away

[01:11:42] John Williams's music which bumped all this way up and the fact that Star Wars is

[01:11:46] an eight plus theme the game is really lower than all of our scores yeah

[01:11:51] very much that very much that's exactly so it's hard to get a rating system but

[01:11:55] I bought games just on theme yeah telling you guys I don't want to spend five

[01:12:00] thousand dollars for the Star Wars Pro because I don't like it but dammit

[01:12:05] it's hard not to buy and have a Star Wars machine in your place get it

[01:12:11] in a year for like fifteen hundred to two thousand less I mean you're gonna

[01:12:16] be close to the daddy Star Wars price by that point that's exactly right so

[01:12:20] in closing do a little housekeeping here everybody should check out

[01:16:19] love your show and I really think you know doing a vlog of pinball is the is the

[01:16:26] way to go when you're talking about these machines because you know it's always

[01:16:29] hard to showcase on a podcast what's going on with these machines so I think

[01:16:33] it's it's awesome seeing you guys up there on YouTube all the time talking about

[01:16:37] pinball and anyone who takes time out of their day to make pinball content is a

[01:16:41] winner in my book because I you know you're talking about it people don't

[01:16:44] realize the hours that go in behind the scenes to doing these things and I

[01:16:48] really appreciate all you guys do for the hobby and I look forward to hanging
