[00:00] 

[00:30] I do say goodbye.

[00:40] I ask you, be that a wife,

[00:47] who would ever so have a kiss.

[00:52] Welcome to episode 499 of Canatus Pinball Podcast,

[01:02] 499 Podcasts about Pinball.

[01:06] Can you imagine that we are so close and we are moving towards episode number 500.

[01:12] And I'm here to tell you episode number 500,

[01:15] it's going to be the best Canatus Pinball Podcast you've ever heard.

[01:19] It's going to be the most amazing Pinball Podcast that I've ever done.

[01:23] And I've lined up the most incredible interview and you're never going to imagine who I got to do episode number 500.

[01:31] But here's the sad part, you're never going to be able to hear it,

[01:35] because there will never be an episode 500 of Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[01:41] And unfortunately, for you out there who loves this show and nobody loves this show, believe me,

[01:47] nobody loves this show more than me.

[01:50] And nobody loves doing this show more than I do.

[01:53] Unfortunately, this will be the last episode of Canatus Pinball Podcast.

[01:59] And I want to explain why very quickly.

[02:02] And then I just want to drop the mic and exit stage left, because it's been an incredible run.

[02:08] And I love doing this and I love giving all of you pinball content.

[02:12] I woke up this morning to a text message from the president of my company,

[02:16] where I go in every day, well, I don't go in anymore, but I used to go in.

[02:20] And she said, Chris, there's going to be a meeting put on your calendar.

[02:24] And immediately I started freaking out.

[02:26] She said, because it's going to be a meeting with HR, the head of HR.

[02:30] No, and she's like, but don't worry, it's pinball related.

[02:33] Right? Pinball, my hobby.

[02:35] And for some reason, I have to have a meeting with the president of my company

[02:40] and the HR head.

[02:42] And so I just had the meeting about 20 minutes ago.

[02:46] And basically, the long and short of it is this.

[02:50] A few people have decided to email and reach out to my company

[02:55] and say things about me and make sort of accusations about my show and me as a person.

[03:02] And look, my company fully supports me, but they basically said,

[03:06] they've had other examples of this happen where if people really wanted to wage a war on me

[03:12] and really wanted to hurt me, like this would be the way to do it.

[03:16] Is you would go to my employer, you would go to my livelihood,

[03:20] and you would start to say things and do things and put them in a position

[03:26] in which they don't want to be.

[03:28] And I'm here to tell you right now, I told the president of my company,

[03:31] and I told the HR lead, who I'm very good friends with.

[03:33] And we all, you know, we get along so great and they value me tremendously.

[03:38] And I said to them right away, absolutely done.

[03:41] I'm done.

[03:42] I'm done.

[03:43] If people are going to cross that line, and if people are going to go after my livelihood,

[03:48] if people are going to go after where I work and my reputation at work,

[03:54] because of this thing, which is my hobby, this is the thing I enjoy doing on this side.

[03:59] This isn't how we make a living, it's over.

[04:02] And here's the thing, they wouldn't tell me who it was,

[04:06] and I was not going to ask who it was.

[04:09] I wasn't going to even ask what they said.

[04:12] They were sharing content and information from, I guess from my show,

[04:16] or maybe Facebook live sessions with my employer.

[04:19] And that's all I needed to hear.

[04:21] That's all I needed to hear.

[04:22] I'm going to say this.

[04:23] And this is just going to be me talking from the heart.

[04:26] I'm just going to go off a little bit because I love you guys.

[04:29] And I love you, gals.

[04:30] And I love everyone who listens to this show.

[04:32] And I wanted to say a few things.

[04:34] I've worked really hard in my career to get to where I am.

[04:37] I've worked really, really hard.

[04:39] And I've made some amazing marketing campaigns happen.

[04:43] I've worked really hard to make amazing connections and friends.

[04:46] And it's really hard.

[04:47] It's really hard in any industry to create value and to rise above the masses.

[04:53] And to find yourself in a company that you consider like your family

[04:57] and you love going in every day and you love the people you work with.

[05:00] And I'm never going to jeopardize that for this pinball hobby.

[05:04] So there's that element of it.

[05:06] And I've worked too hard over the last 19 years in this industry

[05:10] to let someone and some group of people go on a smear campaign.

[05:14] And it's just not worth it to me.

[05:16] I want to have a family.

[05:17] I want to start a family.

[05:18] I need to protect my livelihood at all costs.

[05:22] At all costs.

[05:23] I will throw this mic away.

[05:26] And I will throw away everything about pinball if it means that I'm going to lose everything else I worked hard for in life.

[05:34] And nobody should have to make that choice.

[05:36] But I do because I'm a very public figure.

[05:38] And even though some people want to email my company, some people,

[05:42] there was one person who was anonymous, another person who wasn't.

[05:45] And that's fine.

[05:46] Look, I've always been straight with all of you.

[05:49] I've always known who I am, my name, where I work, what I do for a living.

[05:54] Everything I've ever done has always been front and center.

[05:57] And unfortunately in today's world, it also makes you an easy target, in easy victim.

[06:03] And anyone can immediately look up where you work and who your boss is on LinkedIn and what's the email and just do this.

[06:10] And this is what happens.

[06:12] And so because of that, it's the easiest decision of my life to walk away from Canadian pinball podcast.

[06:18] I didn't even have to think about it.

[06:20] I told them right away, I'm done.

[06:22] I'm done. I am 100% done.

[06:24] There is nothing, there is nothing that I would ever do to jeopardize my career and my livelihood and my family.

[06:30] And everything I've worked so damn hard for, I'm not going to throw it away for a pinball podcast.

[06:36] And I don't think I did anything to throw it away.

[06:38] I don't think I did anything so wrong.

[06:40] I don't think I did anything that was egregious.

[06:43] I don't think I did anything that deserved to have these people come at the door of my employer.

[06:49] But they did.

[06:50] And I can't change that.

[06:51] And as long as I exist, as long as I'm a presence in the pinball world, and I told this to my boss, I said,

[06:57] look, the only thing I can do is go away because as long as I'm present in this hobby,

[07:03] I can't guarantee that these people won't come back and try to do this again.

[07:08] And they said to me, and I'm just going to be fully candid with all of you.

[07:11] They said, Chris, you know, if these people make a big enough deal and they try to really drag us through the mud

[07:18] with what we're going through right now, we really can't stand behind you.

[07:22] And I said, I don't want you to have to even make that decision.

[07:25] I don't want you to have to like get lawyers and legal up to defend me over a stupid pinball podcast.

[07:31] So it's done.

[07:32] At the so 499 of Canadian pinball podcasts will be my last, okay?

[07:38] Now, I just want to say a few things on the way out the door.

[07:41] I think I created the best damn pinball podcast the world has ever heard, and I think will ever hear.

[07:47] And I don't think you're ever going to get another pinball podcast or quite like me.

[07:51] And I enjoyed every minute of it.

[07:53] The reason why it was good is because I loved it.

[07:55] I put my heart, I put my soul into this show, and I really did want to make this show the best damn show possible.

[08:02] And I think I achieved that.

[08:04] And for those of you who think the awards are stupid and this and that, I don't, I've always appreciated the support.

[08:10] And I've always loved the fact that at the end of the year, people got a chance to say that this was the show that they love the most.

[08:16] And this was the show that they turned to for rumors, for news, for speculation, and just for an honest take on this damn hobby, right?

[08:23] And so I'm happy of what I created.

[08:25] I can always walk away and say, you know what, I made the best pinball podcast.

[08:29] I made the best pinball podcast.

[08:30] I won three years in a row.

[08:32] I don't think anyone's ever going to win three years in a row.

[08:35] Heck, I don't even know if there'll be the twippies for three more years.

[08:37] So I just want to say thank you to all of you out there who listened to every episode who voted for me, who supported me through all of this stuff.

[08:44] I mean, I love you guys.

[08:45] I absolutely love you guys.

[08:46] And it sucks that we live in a culture that has to try and cancel this kind of voice in this hobby.

[08:52] Because I think it's an important one.

[08:54] And I think this hobby is going to lose a very important point of view when I walk away.

[08:58] And I implore all the other pinball media out there to pick up the torch that can aided drops and to look at this hobby with objective eyes.

[09:08] And not just support everything that happens because you think that's how pinball needs to grow.

[09:13] I mean, I didn't expect to do a final episode like this just out of the blue.

[09:17] But I'll say a few parting words as well.

[09:19] Like, what have I learned after 499 pinball podcasts?

[09:23] I've learned the following that all of us are getting ripped off.

[09:26] It's true, I mean it.

[09:28] That all of these games are so overpriced and it's just happened gradually that no one's noticed it.

[09:34] That everyone is waking up and saying like these games are so great, these games are this, these games are that.

[09:39] And they're all overpriced.

[09:40] All of them.

[09:41] They're all overpriced.

[09:42] And it's just comical that we're currently in 2020.

[09:46] And the games are not even nearly as complex or nearly as interesting mechanically as they were in the mid 90s.

[09:52] And it's a really weird hobby like that, right?

[09:54] It's like we're chasing the past versus pushing this hobby forward.

[09:58] That's the way I've always saw this hobby.

[10:00] Are the games fun? Absolutely.

[10:02] Pinball's fun.

[10:03] Every pinball game is fun.

[10:04] Every pinball game, if you stand in front of it, you can have fun with it.

[10:08] You should have fun. It's a toy, right?

[10:10] It's like a water gun.

[10:11] You know, you get to stand over a bunch of water guns and be like, you know, like, well, this water gun, like it's a water gun.

[10:16] How can you not fire a water gun and have a good time?

[10:19] Well, they're not even that much fun.

[10:21] But you know what I mean?

[10:22] Stern Pinball is pinball.

[10:24] There's just no way around it.

[10:25] Stern Pinball is the only pinball company that has figured out the most important thing in pinball.

[10:29] And that's manufacturing.

[10:31] And everyone else has really struggled to just get that simple thing down.

[10:35] So I do want to congratulate Stern Pinball for just getting it done.

[10:38] They get it done.

[10:40] Do they make the best games?

[10:41] Do they make the games that are have them?

[10:43] No, everyone knows that.

[10:44] And they know that.

[10:45] They don't have the highest bomb, so there's not that much in a Stern machine.

[10:48] But at least every, like, three months, there's a new game to choose from.

[10:52] And I think that's amazing.

[10:53] And I think the men and women over at Stern that make that a reality should absolutely be applauded for what they do.

[11:00] And I mean, I'm bummed out because I was about to air this amazing episode of Jersey Jack Pinball and their transformation from New Jersey to Chicago

[11:09] and all these amazing back stories about what happened there.

[11:13] And now you're never going to hear it.

[11:14] You're never going to hear it.

[11:15] Especially now you're not going to hear it.

[11:17] Gosh, there's too much in that.

[11:18] That's just too salty.

[11:19] So Stern Pinball is pinball.

[11:21] There's just no way around it.

[11:23] You know, there's a lot of crooks and thieves in this hobby.

[11:25] And that's always an amazing thing too.

[11:27] That, you know, the amount of men that go into pinball that have no idea what they're doing and take people's money never ceases to amaze me.

[11:34] And it always made for so many good shows, right?

[11:37] It's just following the journeys of these companies, like Deeproot and John Papadu,

[11:42] Kevin Kool-Aik and Andrew Highway.

[11:44] It was always exciting for me to sort of get on the trail of these individuals and watch them where 90% of the time they crashed and burned.

[11:52] And I'm curious to see where Deeproot ends up, but I don't know, you know, how is this story going to end any different than it always ends?

[11:58] We know the way these tales end.

[12:00] We do.

[12:01] Where there's smoke, there's fire.

[12:02] But I hope you guys get pinball that pushes it forward.

[12:05] I really do.

[12:06] I hope the mystery game I'm looking at right now makes it out to you guys.

[12:10] There's not going to be many of them.

[12:11] But I really do.

[12:12] I really hope you guys get this game one day because out of all the games I've seen, this is the one that I really just wanted to own, more than anything.

[12:20] More than guns and roses, more than all this stuff.

[12:23] Don't beat up guys that flip pinball machines.

[12:25] It's a free country.

[12:26] If someone gets a spot on a game and they want to flip it for a profit, that's America.

[12:31] It's capitalism.

[12:32] It's supply and demand.

[12:33] Stop being such pin-side babies and stop being the price police.

[12:37] If I woke up early and got a Rick and Morty slot and you didn't because you slept, that's tough luck.

[12:44] Get up.

[12:45] Order the machine when it's available.

[12:47] I've never had a problem.

[12:48] I've never had a problem ever getting an Ellie of a game.

[12:52] Ever.

[12:53] So I don't want to hear your excuse why you didn't get one.

[12:56] It is so easy to lock down every single pinball machine when it becomes available.

[13:00] So for those of you out there who think it's horrendous that people flip machines grow up, we're all adults.

[13:06] Do I get to go buy Facebook stock at $14 a share again because I missed out on it back then?

[13:12] No.

[13:13] And the same is true with pinball machines.

[13:15] I'm sorry.

[13:16] People who flip keep flipping.

[13:17] And I don't mean like playing.

[13:19] I mean flipping for a profit.

[13:20] It's America.

[13:21] It's a free country.

[13:22] I'm really going to miss all the guys.

[13:24] I'm still going to talk to you guys on Facebook.

[13:25] But like my daily conversations with so many of you on Facebook and you know who you are.

[13:29] I don't want to start naming names because you guys know who you are.

[13:33] I'm just really going to miss telling you guys like wait to hear the next show.

[13:37] I'm just really going to miss that.

[13:38] It sucks.

[13:39] But I'm really going to miss you guys waking up on a Monday morning or Wednesday and seeing that new

[13:44] Canadian pinball podcast in your feed.

[13:46] It's it sucks.

[13:47] I know it.

[13:48] I feel your pain already.

[13:49] And to you pinball manufacturers out there that are excited by this news because I used to rag on you.

[13:54] Let me tell you something gentlemen.

[13:57] Me going away is not going to change the quality of your product.

[14:00] The reason why you don't like me is because you're not doing something right.

[14:03] I've never ragged on a game that was doing something the right way.

[14:06] I have it.

[14:07] I really have it.

[14:08] Maybe I have.

[14:09] But you know the only reason I've ever done this show other than being banned from pinside is I've always just wanted to see pinball magic return.

[14:16] I've wanted to see you guys get what you pay for.

[14:19] You pay a lot of money for these non-essential toys.

[14:23] A lot of money.

[14:24] And let's be honest.

[14:25] There's just not a lot of mechanical wow stuff being put in these games.

[14:30] The industry has fallen back on software and art software and art.

[14:35] That's where they're applying all of their effort.

[14:38] And I really hope over the next couple years that we finally get machines where there really is that world under glass.

[14:46] That wow stuff that the ball does mechanical things that make you say hey you got to come over here and see this right.

[14:52] I want that to be something that happens under the glass.

[14:55] So many of these new machines all you got to come over here and see the clips.

[14:59] So much of pinball is turning into just hitting switches to watch something happen on a screen.

[15:05] And that is not pinball.

[15:07] That's digital.

[15:08] Pinball should be analog.

[15:10] Everything that happens should happen under the glass that's impressive in a pinball machine.

[15:15] The young designers are the future of this industry.

[15:18] They are Scott Dinesi, Eric over at JJP.

[15:21] And there's more young designers coming.

[15:23] The guy is doing my mystery game.

[15:25] You don't even know who he is.

[15:26] I just think the future are these new people.

[15:29] The old guard is done.

[15:31] The old guard pat lawlers.

[15:33] They're done.

[15:34] Their day is up.

[15:35] And they know it.

[15:36] And the pinball that we're going to get that's the best is going to come from people that are young, that are hungry.

[15:42] Keith Owin.

[15:43] My god, look at Keith Owin.

[15:45] And just a few games.

[15:47] He's like, he's running circles around all these guys that have been there forever.

[15:51] You know, and that's what excites me is to see what these younger people can come up with.

[15:56] And that's the future of pinball.

[15:58] And if you want to get more people into pinball, the best way to do it is just make great games.

[16:04] That's it.

[16:05] That's it.

[16:06] Roger Sharp has it all wrong.

[16:08] It's not about putting more pinball on location.

[16:11] To get people into pinball is about making great games.

[16:15] Of course, Roger, those games will do well at barcades and stuff.

[16:18] But make better games and more people will want to own them.

[16:22] Okay?

[16:23] That's the key.

[16:24] So there's really no other way to say goodbye.

[16:26] Other than I really wish the best of luck to all the pinball media out there that are doing this on a weekly basis.

[16:33] All the men and women who pick up a microphone, who pick up a camera, who make streams,

[16:38] who create content for free because they love pinball.

[16:41] I am so happy to be a part of the pinball media that gets ragged on all the time.

[16:47] If I could have one final wish, I would wish that Zach Manion, Jack Danger would bury the hatchet.

[16:52] You know, just bury the hatchet, have a beer over Canada's podcast grave, and move forward because I do think that us in the pinball media,

[17:00] when we work together on these things and we analyze these companies together and we just have more solidarity,

[17:07] it makes it so much more enjoyable for everyone out there to follow all of us, to listen to all of us, to watch all of us,

[17:15] to hang out with us at shows.

[17:17] You know, I never want to see a pinball show where someone doesn't want to go over there because that person's over there.

[17:22] No, it's pinball.

[17:24] We should all get along.

[17:25] If we have differences, yeah, we can have differences on the machines, but we should not fight each other.

[17:30] So I really hope that feud can be settled.

[17:33] And I hope to see you guys again one day in the future.

[17:36] Now look, I know I said it's over, but who knows, you never know, you never know when I might come back.

[17:41] But for now, I really think this is it.

[17:44] This is it. My livelihood has been attacked.

[17:46] Someone went after me where it definitely hurts, and I'm done.

[17:50] I'm done.

[17:51] I'm going to get into my demon.

[17:53] I'm going to ride off into the sunset.

[17:55] And I just want to say thank you to everyone who listened.

[17:57] I love all of you.

[17:58] I know this hurts and this sucks, and I know you're going to be like,

[18:01] you need a pinball at gmail.com, and you can send me your, your all sucks emails.

[18:06] But you know, I don't really know how to like exit.

[18:08] Like, do I just, do I just share all the images of guns and roses with you now?

[18:12] Is that, should that be how I depart?

[18:14] No, I'm not going to do that to Eric.

[18:17] But I look forward to getting guns and roses.

[18:19] You won't know how I think about it.

[18:20] But no, I mean, I'll still be around.

[18:22] I'm still alive.

[18:23] I'll still be on Facebook.

[18:24] But I just want to say to all of you out there, treat each other with respect.

[18:28] Don't ever do stuff like this.

[18:30] Don't ever try and destroy someone's livelihood.

[18:32] It really hurts.

[18:33] It's painful.

[18:34] And it's aggravating.

[18:36] And it's stressful.

[18:37] And we don't need that kind of stress.

[18:39] We all come to pinball to have a good time.

[18:41] I'm happy is how that I get to go out right before 500 episodes.

[18:45] I'm so happy of the product I created.

[18:47] And I'm so happy because at the end of it all, at the end of it all,

[18:51] I just have the best fans in the world.

[18:53] And all of you who are listening right now, you just kick ass.

[18:56] And even if some of you turned me in or went after my comp,

[18:59] I don't care.

[19:00] I forgive you for being you.

[19:02] I have the best fans ever.

[19:04] You have 499 episodes to go back to and listen to them.

[19:08] And for everyone else out there picking up a mic, go do it.

[19:11] Go pick up a mic.

[19:12] Now you have 3000 people who are starving for another canada.

[19:17] Who will be the next canada?

[19:19] Who can take my reigns?

[19:20] Who can pick up this mic?

[19:21] Who can fill these Gucci shoes?

[19:23] I don't know.

[19:24] Will they rise?

[19:25] I hope so.

[19:26] Everyone.

[19:27] Love you.

[19:28] Be good.

[19:29] Take care of yourselves.

[19:30] Work out more than you play Pimbal machines.

[19:33] And I'll catch you some point on Facebook or at a show, alright?

[19:36] Later.

[20:00] I know what we got now.

[20:09] Where do we go now?

[20:19] Where do we go now?

[20:23] Where do we go now?

[20:25] No, no, no, no, no.

[20:28] We die.

[20:30] We die.

[20:35] The man.
