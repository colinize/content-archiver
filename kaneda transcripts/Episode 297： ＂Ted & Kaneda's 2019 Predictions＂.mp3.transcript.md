[00:00] Welcome to episode 297 of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:28] If you ever question my dedication to doing a pinball podcast for you, just know this.

[00:33] It's 6am in New York.

[00:35] I am up super early because Brenda is traveling for work and I did an interview and it's

[00:42] on her computer and I wanted to make sure you guys got this podcast before the weekend.

[00:47] So it's getting uploaded in the wee hours of the morning in New York City.

[00:51] This is going to be a great episode 297.

[00:53] I interviewed Ted and we do our annual prediction show of what we think is going to happen in the

[00:59] pinball world in 2019.

[01:02] I think you're really going to love it.

[01:04] Before you listen, do me a favor.

[01:06] All of you out there because I do think I have the most loyal and dedicated pinball podcast

[01:12] followers.

[01:13] I do.

[01:14] I love all of you guys.

[01:15] Please in the next few weeks, if you can find the time, even do it today.

[01:20] Please go to thisweekandpinball.com and vote for Canadian Spinball Podcast as your favorite

[01:26] pinball podcast in the Twippies.

[01:29] The reason why I'm asking you to do that is you know the story.

[01:32] We are the pinball podcast that for the longest time was censored on Pinside.

[01:36] You couldn't even say the name Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[01:40] This podcast exists for a reason and I think you know why.

[01:43] But I think winning a Twippy and I think being voted for by you guys who love the show,

[01:49] I do think it's important because I think it validates for all the other people out there

[01:53] in the pinball world that would rather silence this show that this show matters and that they

[01:59] should tune in because I think a lot of what we say in this show isn't as negative as

[02:04] some people say.

[02:05] That it is actually a very thought out and constructive podcast that I think everyone

[02:11] will benefit from and I think you benefit from it and that's why you listen.

[02:15] I would appreciate your votes.

[02:17] You just have to give your email address and vote and please if you have a friend and

[02:21] they want to vote for me as well that's awesome everyone.

[02:24] Please enjoy episode 297 where Ted and I predict what will happen in pinball next year or

[02:30] this year.

[02:31] Sorry it's the new year.

[02:32] Happy 2019 everyone.

[02:34] Canada out.

[02:37] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to an annual tradition of Ted and Canada predicting the

[02:44] pinball world.

[02:45] Ted, we did this in 2017 and we predicted 2018.

[02:50] Remember that?

[02:51] I think we got everything right too.

[02:54] Although you did predict that Dutch pinball would get everyone their big Lebowski machines.

[02:59] I never said that.

[03:01] You did.

[03:02] I actually, you didn't listen to my last podcast.

[03:04] I actually replayed for people our predictions.

[03:07] So we're going to do the same thing this year and we're going to do this within an hour

[03:11] because Ted and I probably want to have a nice dinner tonight and not think about pinball

[03:16] and Ted, I will guide us.

[03:17] I'm going to guide us down the list of manufacturers and I want to hear from you what you think

[03:23] is going to happen and then I'll chime in and we might go back and forth and switch order.

[03:26] How's that sound?

[03:27] Sounds very mediocre.

[03:28] I'm in.

[03:29] All right.

[03:30] Ready for mediocre pinball podcast.

[03:32] Okay.

[03:33] So let me pull up my little list of God here.

[03:36] American pinball.

[03:37] Ted and I know, God you a little bit.

[03:39] We are on the eve of October fest being revealed where it's been revealed, but the final

[03:44] version.

[03:46] And what do you think?

[03:47] What are your thoughts on how American pinball will do in 2019?

[03:52] We have talked about some of this before and you know how I feel about it.

[03:56] I just don't understand the way these companies are picking the themes.

[04:04] Well, to me, theme is everything into it.

[04:06] I think a lot of people theme is everything.

[04:07] Sure, it's great to have a wonderful playing machine and great rules and all this stuff.

[04:11] But for the average guy like me that doesn't even know how to rules, it just wants to play

[04:15] pinball.

[04:16] You need something that a theme that you want in your house.

[04:18] So it's cool.

[04:19] Me, it's science fiction, the hardest stuff that's the stuff that I like.

[04:22] October fest.

[04:23] I mean, I don't know.

[04:24] I would think those are for like mainly for bars or for people that just love that

[04:29] theme.

[04:30] You know, to me, you can't miss by packing a machine full of robots and aliens and girls

[04:36] with backpacks flying around and monsters.

[04:39] And that's the stuff that seems to sell the most.

[04:43] So why wouldn't they do some kind of theme like that as opposed to October fest.

[04:47] But that's just me.

[04:48] It may sell great and there may be more people that like it than I think.

[04:52] I hope it.

[04:53] Okay.

[04:54] Well, so in 2019, do you think this game is going to sell well?

[04:59] Um, well, I'd like to be saying I can only go by what I'm hearing and for what I'm

[05:03] hearing October fest is huge.

[05:05] So I mean, I'm sure a lot of bars are going to, you know, want this and people that just

[05:09] love October fest and this seems to be a lot, you know, would like this.

[05:12] So I can see where it's going to do well by.

[05:15] It's just not my type of thing.

[05:17] I love it.

[05:18] The forever optimist head.

[05:19] This is why I love doing the prediction show with you because you always see the bright

[05:23] side of these companies.

[05:24] I think you're right.

[05:25] I think you hit the nail on the head.

[05:27] It's a terrible theme.

[05:29] It's very limited in the audience.

[05:31] They could have picked 10 other themes that would have sold site unseen, even though they're

[05:36] going to correct some of the art problems on the machine that we saw originally.

[05:41] I still think this thing is going to be a total sales flop for American pinball.

[05:46] And I think it's going to be a wake up call to them that they either start getting their

[05:51] shit together and giving pinball fans the themes they want or this company is going to

[05:57] be goodbye.

[05:58] Really?

[05:59] Well, that's kind of.

[06:00] I'm a fatalist in pinball.

[06:02] All right.

[06:03] I guess so.

[06:04] Let's move on to Chicago gaming company and monster bash remake is shipping to consumers

[06:12] right now.

[06:13] The other thing I would ask Ted is do you think they're going to release another title

[06:17] in 2019 and if so, which one do you think it will be?

[06:21] Well, they're in an old loose situation.

[06:24] I mean, they're picking the best loved pinball machines in history and they're remaking them

[06:29] with modern technology.

[06:31] I mean, it's a no brainer.

[06:33] Like I said, I would in our pinball parties that we had years and years ago before this

[06:37] happened.

[06:38] I asked the question why this wasn't done and they all laughed at me and said it never

[06:42] would be done.

[06:43] And I said, why would someone not remake it unless they can't get the rights to do it?

[06:46] And they just laughed and said that they guaranteed it would never be done.

[06:49] And now, sure enough, it's here and it's doing well.

[06:54] I'm very close to wanting to pick up a monster bash.

[06:59] I'm waiting to see what the Elvira 3 looks like.

[07:01] I know that's for another conversation.

[07:04] But down the road here, but I'm waiting to see that.

[07:06] The monsters, I don't know.

[07:08] Well, we're going to talk about monsters when we get to it.

[07:10] But there's a coat of machines coming out.

[07:12] I want to see what's happening before because machines are not, unless you're very, very

[07:17] wealthy that can afford hundreds of thousands of dollars.

[07:19] There's been buying a seven or eight thousand dollar machine.

[07:21] You just can't do it every twice or three times a year, at least I can.

[07:26] Some can, right?

[07:27] So, so monster bash was a very delayed launch.

[07:31] Do you think Ted that they will reveal another title in 2019?

[07:39] I think we're probably far enough along now with monster bash.

[07:43] I think that it's pretty solid that I think they, I'm guessing that they'll probably

[07:47] reveal another title in 2019.

[07:49] I'm hoping it's big bang bar because of course that would be a no brainer for me.

[07:53] I love that game.

[07:54] You know who doesn't want to see that?

[07:56] The guy who's trying to sell his big bang bar in box for $25,000.

[08:00] Better get that sold.

[08:02] Yep, yep, yep.

[08:04] So I predict in 2019, I think Chicago gaming company, I agree with you.

[08:08] I think they're going to have a great year.

[08:10] I think these titles are always in demand because they're great games.

[08:15] The updates to the games that they do are phenomenal.

[08:18] I think it's hard to argue that the classics look better.

[08:22] People might still argue that they play better, but I heard they got the flippers perfect

[08:27] on monster bash remake, which wasn't the case with the TAC from ours.

[08:31] I think they have a good year.

[08:32] I think these guys are a very formidable opponent.

[08:35] Did I add too many bees into that?

[08:37] Annunciation.

[08:38] I do think that Chicago gaming company is Stern's biggest competition.

[08:43] I think they are, they keep making the games that we know are great in a modern, more

[08:48] contemporary way.

[08:50] If I were to say what their next game would be, my guess would be Cactus Canyon.

[08:59] But what's curious about that one is will they update the software to be the Cactus Canyon

[09:04] continued?

[09:05] We will see.

[09:06] We don't think we're going to see them reveal on you game until all the way into October

[09:13] of Expo.

[09:14] Possibly.

[09:15] Yeah, I don't think they're going to make the same mistake again and sort of announce

[09:21] they're going to be a TPS and then be nowhere to be found with the game.

[09:25] Yeah, C.C.

[09:27] Cactus Canyon would be a perfect choice for me because then I could think about getting

[09:30] monster bash and have another year and a half, two years to wait to get the big bang bar.

[09:36] Right.

[09:37] The question that remains to with this company is can they make two remakes in a year and

[09:43] will they get manufacturing up to that speed because they listed a lot of games that they

[09:49] want to remake, right?

[09:50] Theater of magic, Cactus Canyon, Big Bang Bar.

[09:54] And in everyone's head we're doing the calendar and we're thinking, wow, it could be four

[10:00] years before I get Big Bang Bar and who wants to wait that long?

[10:03] Yeah, no, no, that's exactly it.

[10:05] I mean, you don't know, but you know what?

[10:08] Regardless of what machine it is, whether it's theater of magic or any of them, I mean,

[10:12] you have a whole lot of people waiting for them.

[10:15] So I mean, they're not going to, no matter what they do, they're not going to, it's not

[10:18] going to be bad.

[10:19] So, you know, I'm just, I'm just very happy.

[10:21] There's just so much coming out now and not even to talk about the deep, the deep group

[10:27] people.

[10:28] Right.

[10:29] We're going to get there.

[10:30] Sorry, don't jump ahead.

[10:31] I'm not.

[10:32] If I was Chicago gaming company, I would just, on April 1st, I would announce to the

[10:36] world that we're going to remake WWE, Ellie's only.

[10:40] That would be a good April fools.

[10:43] And I think I think people would read into it real quickly.

[10:46] Order them now.

[10:48] All right.

[10:49] The next company on our list is Circus Maximus.

[10:53] They are making pinball circus and they are remaking Kingpin, which they showed at

[10:58] Texas Pinball Festival last year.

[11:00] What do you think, Ted?

[11:01] Oh, you know, I may have been confused.

[11:05] Is Kingpin is not the same as Mafia?

[11:08] No, Ted.

[11:09] Oh, okay.

[11:10] I might have to put a laugh track in.

[11:12] You probably do, but I thought they changed the name of it because I thought it was the

[11:15] same game.

[11:16] But never mind.

[11:17] You know, Kingpin, there was eight, there was like eight prototypes made back in the day.

[11:22] Yes.

[11:23] Okay.

[11:24] Yeah, no, I know that the history of the thing.

[11:26] I just, somehow, I've only just seen a couple pictures and I thought that they renamed

[11:30] it Mafia because it seemed through the same type of thing, but never mind.

[11:33] So they didn't.

[11:34] So that's good.

[11:35] I don't know anything about the game.

[11:36] I've just seen the pictures like everyone else has seen.

[11:41] You know, again, it's not science fiction or horror stuff.

[11:44] So it's not up my alley.

[11:46] I certainly play it, you know, if it came out.

[11:50] But you know, that's about it.

[11:51] Well, okay.

[11:52] So the big question with Circus Maximus, you know, we'll excuse Ted of his ignorance on

[11:58] this company, but the whole thing is pinball circus was Python, Angelo's, you know,

[12:04] the vertical game with the two, they had the two versions at the Alan Tom pinball.

[12:10] I played them both and spoke to the guys about it.

[12:12] And I like the game a lot.

[12:14] I think it's really, really cool.

[12:16] So the big question for this company in 2019 is, will they finally deliver and manufacture

[12:22] either one of these games?

[12:23] Now we know for Kingpin, they are searching for a manufacturer all like a spooky or an

[12:29] American pinball to actually make the kingpin.

[12:31] So they're developing it.

[12:33] That's a definite though, right?

[12:34] That is a definite.

[12:35] They are looking for that.

[12:36] And the reason that using that to raise the money for the circus max for the other one.

[12:41] Well, that hasn't been communicated.

[12:44] So we don't know if that's the case.

[12:46] But my prediction for this company is that I don't think we're going to see Circus Max.

[12:51] I don't think we're going to see Pimball circus anytime soon.

[12:54] I think that game is probably a lot more difficult to get right.

[12:58] And I think mainly because Python and Jolo designed a game that didn't really work well.

[13:03] And so they have to make design changes to it to get it to function properly.

[13:08] I think it's a nightmare.

[13:09] I think the game has been, they've been working on it too.

[13:11] Yeah, it's been, they've been working on it for a few years.

[13:14] It sounds like a nightmare.

[13:15] Kingpin on the other hand seems like the safer bet if I were them to find someone like

[13:21] an American Pimball or a spooky to contract manufacturer, Kingpin.

[13:26] But I still don't think we're going to see that happen in 2019.

[13:30] So my prediction is nothing comes out from Circus Maximus in 2019.

[13:35] It'll be another year of prototyping and trying to find a manufacturer.

[13:40] That's my prediction.

[13:41] Okay.

[13:42] I don't know how far along they are with Kingpin.

[13:45] I thought they were further along than that.

[13:47] I thought I read somewhere and I couldn't be mistaken.

[13:50] I thought I read somewhere that they were doing that one first to raise the money for

[13:54] Circus Maximus.

[13:55] And they are far along.

[13:57] But here's the challenge is even though they're far along in the prototyping of it, they

[14:02] still have to find a manufacturer who can fit them in to their schedule.

[14:07] Yeah, it's probably not going to be spooky.

[14:10] Well, it can't be spooky probably.

[14:12] American Pimball.

[14:13] Here's where I think this would make sense.

[14:16] I think October Fest is going to be a sales flop.

[14:20] I just do.

[14:22] And I think American Pimball would be smart to get another game on the line to keep the

[14:28] line moving.

[14:29] And I think Kingpin makes sense.

[14:31] And there's a few other titles that would make sense for them.

[14:34] Yeah, I think it would be a good title for them because you see what they did with Magic

[14:38] Girls.

[14:39] I mean, they do have the ability to just grab some stuff and start up and make it.

[14:42] So I think American Pimball would be a good choice.

[14:46] So you just use Magic Girls an example of building a machine.

[14:49] I got to add another lap track.

[14:51] No, no, I mean, someone just came to them and said, you know, and build the machine.

[14:54] So we know they can do it from someone just, just to set the record straight.

[15:00] They, they hire John Papadu to be their lead designer, American Pimball.

[15:05] And they let him spend a year doing absolutely nothing to get those games into a functioning

[15:11] state.

[15:12] We all know the story, but I think they've learned a hard lesson with that hire.

[15:17] So speaking of this is perfect segue.

[15:19] Not everyone has learned it though.

[15:21] Exactly.

[15:22] So good segue.

[15:23] So speaking of John Papadu, on board, the next is Deeproot Pimball.

[15:28] And what do you think 2019 holds for Deeproot?

[15:31] Well, you know what?

[15:33] Hey, look, if it wasn't that, I've spoken to Dennis a few times.

[15:38] I did interview with him for my website.

[15:42] It's very nice, very level headed guy.

[15:45] And when he moved over there, I said, okay, well, now this is, I mean, they're hiring

[15:48] enough people.

[15:49] I mean, they've got tons of dough and they're going to be doing something.

[15:54] Hiring Papadu's big.

[15:55] I don't get it.

[15:57] I don't understand it.

[15:59] You know, they know that he's hated in the pinball world.

[16:02] Why they would do it.

[16:05] I have no idea.

[16:06] I mean, less than they were doing it specifically with the idea of saying, hey, we're going to

[16:11] bail everybody out and we're going to make the games for everybody.

[16:15] And you know, something like that.

[16:17] But otherwise, I just don't have any idea why they would hire a crook.

[16:20] It's like, you know, it's crazy.

[16:22] So, you know, for me, with them, it's going to be a wait and see because they made that

[16:27] hire.

[16:28] They made to, for me, a very serious mistake.

[16:31] And the pinball machines better be fantastic.

[16:33] Otherwise, people are just going to, you know, boycott them like crazy.

[16:37] Right.

[16:38] And what's interesting, Ted, is what you just gave as your prediction or your assessment

[16:43] of Deeproot was very similar to a year ago.

[16:45] But a lot has happened in a year in terms of the team that Deeproot has hired to surround

[16:52] John.

[16:53] And John's not the only designer.

[16:54] I mean, they've got like three, four designers over there.

[16:57] They've got coders.

[16:58] They've got, they've got a whole armada that they're assembling.

[17:01] They've got a big factory.

[17:02] They're, I mean, it looks like they're going to be the real deal unless they, you know,

[17:07] came out with one, two or three machines that were just total flops that would, that

[17:11] would sink them.

[17:12] I mean, they're sinking a ton of money every month into this place.

[17:15] They got to start bringing some money in.

[17:17] So what, what do you predict is going to happen?

[17:19] You think we're going to see games from them in 2019?

[17:21] Um, in 2019, probably.

[17:25] I mean, yeah, in 2019, yeah, there probably be something this year.

[17:28] And they were supposed to have something right away.

[17:30] And now they, it was pushed back a bit.

[17:32] But I mean, they had, I'm guessing they had to be pretty far along for them to make that

[17:36] first, you know, early prediction.

[17:38] So, you know, they have another year now.

[17:40] So I'm, I'm guessing that, yeah, the, the product now is something.

[17:43] What, who knows what the hell is?

[17:46] Right, right.

[17:47] Okay.

[17:48] So your prediction on Deeproot is probably something comes out.

[17:51] Yeah, I think something's going to come out in 2019.

[17:54] Okay.

[17:55] Do you think they're going to succeed?

[17:58] I mean, I'm looking, I'm not sure what their first machines were going to be.

[18:03] But if they're making that, one was supposed to be like a science fiction-y type thing.

[18:07] And if they come out with something like that that's, you know, really, you know, really

[18:11] neat that has a lot of, you know, cool stuff on it and it's fun to play.

[18:14] You know, sure.

[18:15] I think they can, uh, the science fiction-y type thingy you're talking about, Raza, which

[18:21] is the John Papaduks.

[18:23] Oh, no, they had their own, their own.

[18:25] It was something, I forget the name of it, but they had,

[18:27] and some, you know, science fiction stuff on it.

[18:31] Are you talking about the ad they ran with the alien and the, like, the ray gun?

[18:35] Yeah.

[18:36] Some kind of ad with alien stuff.

[18:37] Yeah, I think that's the new Raza artwork.

[18:38] So we're, no one knows for sure.

[18:40] And, and I'll say this, and I'll give my prediction on Deeproot.

[18:43] I actually give them credit for not showing anything yet.

[18:48] And, and I think a lot of pinball companies when they're new to market, right, Ted, they,

[18:52] they, they, they show us like, they tell us the themes.

[18:56] Like, Andrew Highway telling us alien two years before he even had, like, a game made,

[19:01] right?

[19:02] I like that they've kept it very quiet.

[19:04] They've kept it very secret.

[19:06] I think it's the right way to do it.

[19:09] I predict.

[19:10] This is what, this is my early prediction for Deeproot.

[19:12] I think they're going to bring stuff to T.P.F.

[19:14] I think Robert Mueller is trying to pull a fast one on everybody.

[19:21] And I think he's trying to like, get the competition sort of to, to underestimate him at T.P.F.

[19:27] I think there is no way Deeproot pinball does not bring anything to T.P.F.

[19:33] Which is the show that's their backyard.

[19:35] It's one of the biggest shows out in the pinball world.

[19:39] He supports T.P.F. and Ed who runs the show.

[19:43] There is no way.

[19:43] And I think he's hoodwinking all of us with this.

[19:46] Oh, we're not going to be there.

[19:48] I think it's, I think it's a tactic of his.

[19:51] And I think he's being clever, but I think he's going to show something there.

[19:54] Now, is he going to show five games?

[19:56] I don't know.

[19:57] My other prediction for Deeproot is that it's not going to be as easy as they think.

[20:04] And I'll say this, I think they're going to show stuff that has some wow for sure.

[20:11] Right?

[20:12] Because they're not stupid all these people.

[20:13] Like they literally can't come out and just show like a mediocre game.

[20:17] But I think where they're going to run into trouble is if they show something cool

[20:22] to Ed and like they get a thousand orders or 500 orders.

[20:26] How are they going to make those games in a short period of time?

[20:29] And Robert's already promised people that they'll have their game within two weeks of ordering

[20:34] it.

[20:35] And we know, we know that that's not realistic.

[20:38] So I think there's going to be some unforeseen stumbles and fumbles that are going to happen.

[20:44] And I think if they're smart, they would only reveal and release one or two games.

[20:50] Just think about that even just two games from a new manufacturer is two more than anyone's

[20:56] been able to pull off ever with the new manufacturers.

[20:59] Yeah.

[21:00] No, no, hey, look, if they do good, they do good.

[21:02] My concern with them is because of the misstep is how they treat the, you know, pop a

[21:08] douchebag people.

[21:09] How they what they're going to do with these people.

[21:11] It seems like they're making people to put out a lot of money, jump through too many

[21:14] hoops to get their deep root games.

[21:17] You know, I mean, if you have a receipt, you paid your money and they're offering the

[21:21] program, well, let the people in it stop making people jump through hoops and putting

[21:25] the time limit on this and that and saying, oh, you didn't give us enough of this.

[21:28] You know, just if you're going to hire that asshole, then man up and put out what you're

[21:34] supposed to put out and let the people put out the money, do something for them to build

[21:37] that goodwill.

[21:38] Right.

[21:39] Well, we'll see what happens.

[21:44] We'll see what happens.

[21:46] We know nothing about them other than the bold statement.

[21:49] They've got tons of money and they've hired a lot of good people.

[21:52] That's all we know.

[21:53] Right.

[21:54] Well, we know the money, the millions burns up quickly in the world of pinball manufacturing.

[21:58] All right.

[21:59] Next on our list, this is your moment, Ted, of convalescence, your moment to redeem

[22:05] yourself.

[22:06] That's how to become a millionaire in the pinball world.

[22:08] Start out being a billionaire.

[22:09] Okay.

[22:10] Guys, Dutch pinball go.

[22:14] I don't know.

[22:15] Nobody knows yet.

[22:16] I mean, they're saying they're trying.

[22:18] So I mean, I just got to go along with these people are trying to get something done

[22:24] and they're waiting for this this court system and whether they do it or whether they don't,

[22:29] you know, I don't know.

[22:30] I'm hoping that they that they do it.

[22:33] People seem to love the machine.

[22:36] You know, people want it and they just have to find a way to get it done.

[22:40] So, you know, I really don't know.

[22:43] It seems like it should be relatively cut and tried.

[22:45] They're either going to really going to just throw in the towel or they're going to actually

[22:50] try and come up with something.

[22:52] But I don't know.

[22:53] Ted, if you walked up to a body lying on the ground and you checked its pulse and there

[22:57] was no pulse, and I'm like, Ted, is that is that person dead?

[23:02] I want to put the paddles on him and see him give another jewel.

[23:05] Okay.

[23:06] Okay.

[23:07] So the last we've heard, and we haven't heard much.

[23:08] We haven't heard much other than the last thing we heard was that Yop was undergoing medical

[23:13] treatment for cancer.

[23:15] We have not heard anything since then.

[23:18] And that was a few months.

[23:20] Yes, we do hope he gets better.

[23:23] But it's hard to for me to come to any other conclusion.

[23:27] And it's actually like, I'm just going to say the same thing.

[23:29] I said, last year they're done.

[23:30] It's over.

[23:32] This is as over as it gets.

[23:34] But you said it was over last year and guess what?

[23:37] It's not totally over yet.

[23:38] But that's the point that annoys me.

[23:40] It's like they just won't come out and say it's not happening.

[23:44] It just won't die.

[23:45] Right?

[23:46] It's always on it.

[23:48] It's not even like life support.

[23:49] It's like you need just faith.

[23:52] It's like faith.

[23:53] It's blind faith that you will one day get your big Lebowski if you bought one.

[23:59] Yeah, it's sort of like Scientology.

[24:01] You sort of think it's a good idea, but ultimately you're really going to get screwed.

[24:05] Now, my prediction is this though.

[24:07] And because while we're on Dutch, is that one of these other pinball manufacturers out

[24:12] there will go get the big Lebowski game and manufacture it.

[24:17] Really?

[24:18] The game is great.

[24:20] The game is designed.

[24:21] The game is made.

[24:22] The game is coded.

[24:23] I played it.

[24:26] Why would you not, if your American pinball go get it?

[24:30] Now the reason why people are probably struggling with that is I think Bering and Yop are refusing

[24:37] to let it go, but they have to.

[24:39] They have to just let someone else who has the capabilities make the game.

[24:44] Now I think in 2019, we're still not going to see it.

[24:48] Well, the reason is it's the same reason that nobody picks up alien.

[24:53] It's just the nightmare of badwill that's there.

[24:57] I mean, people are still owed money.

[24:58] People are owed games that they paid in full.

[25:01] If somebody picks that thing up and makes it, the first thing they're going to want to do

[25:03] is they, where's my game?

[25:05] You guys picked it up.

[25:06] Where's my game?

[25:07] And a lot of people just don't want to get involved in that crack, my roof crap.

[25:11] They'd rather just move on and do another machine.

[25:13] So I mean, I get that.

[25:15] I understand that because for me, alien was a dream theme too.

[25:19] And it's a shame what happened to it.

[25:20] I was wishing someone would pick it up.

[25:22] When you talk to the manufacturing people, you find out they just don't want to deal with

[25:25] that baggage.

[25:26] Right.

[25:27] So, you know, so that's why you have to re-up the rights.

[25:30] You got to go, bye, but it's just a ton of crap you got to go through.

[25:33] So I understand why it's not easy.

[25:36] Well, we'll see what happens.

[25:37] The next company on our list, Home Pin.

[25:41] Yeah.

[25:42] Home Pin.

[25:43] You want to take a drink first, Home Pin.

[25:48] You know what?

[25:49] I just did.

[25:50] I just had a super one.

[25:51] Good job.

[25:52] Before you said that, Home Pin, I like Home Pin.

[25:56] I mean, you know, it's no secret.

[25:59] I mean, I talk about it a lot.

[26:00] What's not to like, Ted, right?

[26:02] I mean, I don't really care the guy's personality.

[26:04] Look at, look at who cares about these people's personality or what they believe, what they

[26:09] know.

[26:10] There's plenty of nuts out there.

[26:11] But the guy is doing good.

[26:12] He's doing what he needs to do for his business.

[26:15] He's going where he needs to go for his business.

[26:17] He's starting out slow.

[26:19] You know, I think he's doing all his own stuff, all his own parts.

[26:23] I think he's doing fine.

[26:26] I haven't played Thunderbird yet.

[26:28] It looks cool.

[26:29] Everyone's saying, oh, it doesn't look right.

[26:30] I think it looks fantastic.

[26:32] I can't wait to play it until I hope it's at Alan Town.

[26:35] So I can actually get to play the machine.

[26:37] You know, and there's one available very cheap.

[26:40] So I hope it does good.

[26:42] I hope he makes a good decision on the theme for the next game.

[26:47] And I think like anybody, if he continues, I think

[26:49] he, you know, the machines are just going to get better and better.

[26:53] Right.

[26:54] Like anybody.

[26:55] I mean, I kind of have to disagree with you.

[26:59] I don't take it.

[27:01] First of all, I don't think, see, this is like an interesting thing about the hobbies.

[27:07] I think there is a lot of like expectation that if you just keep making games, they'll

[27:13] just keep getting better and better.

[27:14] And I'm not sure that's the case.

[27:17] I think it really does require having the right talent to make things better and better.

[27:22] I think in any profession, right, it's like, it's like an athlete that sucks.

[27:27] He's not going to get better next season unless he really works hard or maybe you're just

[27:31] better off hiring, you're having a good athlete on your team.

[27:34] So here's the thing with homebid.

[27:35] My prediction is, Thunderbirds isn't selling well.

[27:38] And it's not selling well because of Mike.

[27:40] And I think a lot of people in the hobby Ted have sort of avoided wanting to get one

[27:46] for a few reasons.

[27:47] One is Mike's attitude really rubs people the wrong way.

[27:51] So he's not doing himself any favor.

[27:52] So if he could change his ways, which will be hard at this point, he would invite more

[27:59] people to consider his product.

[28:01] The real issue with them right now, Ted, is he's struggled to get these games out.

[28:06] I mean, it's been a long time in the making and he's actually burned the initial investors,

[28:12] the most, the people in Australia who bought the game first.

[28:15] They still have not received their games and yet he's shipping them to Canada.

[28:19] So it's kind of that new money.

[28:21] He needs new money to make the old orders, right?

[28:23] And we've seen that happen in Pimble.

[28:25] My prediction is this and I'm not going to, and Ted again, I love that you're the forever

[28:28] optimist.

[28:29] I think home pin is going to be one of the companies that doesn't survive.

[28:37] And I think they've got to be hemorrhaging money.

[28:40] I know they've showed game two is in the making and it's just a pop bumper cap.

[28:44] Cool.

[28:45] Sure it is.

[28:46] I think they're going to really struggle to stay viable by the end of 2019.

[28:53] Again, Canada the fatal is predicting that home pin will not survive probably by the

[28:59] end of the year considering what else is coming out in this hobby.

[29:02] I just think it's going to be game over.

[29:06] Okay.

[29:07] Well, again, don't forget you're using the gauge that he's selling Pimble machines around

[29:13] here as opposed to China where I guess there's a lot of people and if that game catches

[29:19] on there and who knows.

[29:22] I mean, again, he made it clear from the start that the United States is not his main

[29:26] territory that it was going to be overseas.

[29:28] Nobody in China knows what Thunderbirds is.

[29:31] It's an Australian like Kiwi property.

[29:34] Let's see.

[29:35] I mean, again, like anything else, I wish him well.

[29:38] I think he's going about it the right way.

[29:40] When there's mistakes made on the game, he's listening.

[29:44] He changed the toy.

[29:45] He's changing the ramp.

[29:47] When things have happened, he's going in there and changing it around.

[29:51] I just wish him the best and hope he comes out with the machines.

[29:56] Okay.

[29:57] Remember who's head?

[29:58] Just remember this.

[29:59] A year from now.

[30:00] We're going to play here.

[30:02] We're going to play here predictions.

[30:03] Thank you.

[30:04] And we're going to see who's right.

[30:06] Okay.

[30:07] And this one on this company really had a crossroads.

[30:11] Maybe not so much, but Jersey Jack Pimball pires the Caribbean a year delayed.

[30:17] It's finally shipping to customers.

[30:20] Their 2019 is going to be a very interesting one.

[30:23] Ted, you know, with the rumors of Willy Wonka and Toy Story and possibly Guns and Roses,

[30:29] Pat set on a pot, not Pat, but Jersey Jack himself said they were going to reveal two titles

[30:34] in 2019.

[30:35] What do you think 2019 holds?

[30:37] Yeah.

[30:38] What do you think it holds for Jersey Jack Pimball?

[30:41] I don't know.

[30:42] I mean, Jersey Jack is, I mean, I guess considered to be like the Lamborghini of pinball machines.

[30:48] You know, you're going to have to wait longer, you know, to get them.

[30:52] But people really seem to like them.

[30:54] I mean, I haven't played pirate ship, but people that I've spoken to that have said it's

[30:59] a fantastic game.

[31:02] Willy Wonka is another theme for me that I really, really like.

[31:08] And I know all the kids, you know, personally, I've done a lot of shows with them.

[31:11] I was one of the people instrumental in getting them to even start doing shows.

[31:16] And so that would be a phenomenal theme, you know, for me as well, you know, two games

[31:23] in 2019.

[31:24] Yeah.

[31:25] Holy crap.

[31:26] Now do you think Jack can like actually do that?

[31:29] He's failed to even reveal game and ship it in a timely manner ever.

[31:35] So how does it make sense for him to reveal to if he can't manufacture both of those games

[31:40] in that year?

[31:41] Well, I think he's getting better.

[31:43] I think every game, you know, he's learning.

[31:45] You know, I mean, he started up, you know, like that.

[31:48] And I think I think the last game was a 12 month delay between reveal and shipping.

[31:54] How is that getting better?

[31:55] He's got him.

[31:56] I mean, getting getting better as far as, you know, getting the things built, you know,

[32:01] getting them to be more reliable.

[32:03] I mean, you know, the trouble, they had some trouble with the Vaz.

[32:05] And I think they had probably less trouble with Hobbit.

[32:07] And now there's probably going to be less trouble.

[32:09] I mean, I think that they're just, you know, they're getting better and better at the

[32:12] build, you know, for these things to get him out faster.

[32:15] If he's saying it, let's let's hope it happens.

[32:18] Okay.

[32:19] That's always built.

[32:20] I have to go by his word.

[32:21] We don't know.

[32:22] There's a theme occurring here of Ted and the word hope.

[32:27] And I don't put much stock in hope when it comes to a non-essential toy like Pimbal.

[32:34] I don't think we should have to hope and pray.

[32:37] I think there's a very simple way to do Pimbal.

[32:41] And it's you reveal your game within two months of being able to ship it to customers.

[32:46] If you can't do that, then don't reveal it.

[32:49] It's super simple.

[32:50] I mean, certainly.

[32:52] But a lot of people, including myself, like to see the process, like to see the roughs

[32:57] and like to see the making of the game.

[32:59] So I enjoy that.

[33:01] But wouldn't it be fun to see all that and then get the game like a few weeks later?

[33:05] Oh, sure.

[33:06] But it's more fun to see all the toys on pirates being removed from the game because they

[33:12] can't figure out how to make them work.

[33:14] What's more fun?

[33:16] I just, I actually enjoyed that entire process seeing that happen like that where they put

[33:22] that in there and then seeing going into prototype and going into a practical use of it and finding

[33:27] out it didn't work or the way they thought it was and it breaking down more often and changing

[33:33] it out.

[33:34] I enjoyed seeing that process.

[33:35] You know, they're not seeing it at all having all that behind closed doors and then just

[33:39] come out with a machine with one disk and we never knew what it was.

[33:42] I enjoy seeing the process.

[33:44] It's enjoyable, but it makes no sense from a business standpoint.

[33:47] I'll tell you why because then you have customers feeling like they're getting the game in

[33:54] a way that is substandard to what they intended it to be.

[33:59] So for example, like we never know, right?

[34:01] Tide of Stern designed a mechanism that they couldn't make work.

[34:04] We never know.

[34:06] They will never show us that.

[34:08] And as much as it is, it's more entertaining and enjoyable to see the process, but it also

[34:13] hurts their Jersey Jack's ability to get people excited because they, you know, you

[34:19] only can get people excited if the reverse happens.

[34:22] You figured out a way to make something better, not worse or remove it or simpler, but

[34:27] better.

[34:28] Anyway, so my prediction for Jersey Jack in 2019 is I think this is sort of like a watershed

[34:35] maker break year for Jersey Jack.

[34:37] And what I mean by that is Jersey Jack finally needs to create a hit, a hit game that is

[34:44] a theme people want.

[34:46] We know the themes of Wonka and Toy Story are very popular.

[34:49] So they've got that.

[34:52] I think they need a standard body machine, which I think is Toy Story.

[34:57] Maybe it is one, I don't know, maybe it's Wonka too.

[35:00] But my prediction for Jersey Jack pinball is that they will once again, this is just my

[35:05] prediction.

[35:06] They will reveal the game much too early and they will make people once again, wait months

[35:13] to get their game.

[35:15] And my prediction is we are going to see Willie Wonka first.

[35:20] I don't think we're going to see it at T.P.F.

[35:24] I'm not sure when we're going to see it, but I still think people are going to wait at

[35:28] least four months between reveal to getting their game.

[35:31] And I think it could be a lot longer weight than that.

[35:34] All right.

[35:35] Next up, what about Canadian mystery pin?

[35:40] The mystery pin I've been teasing every once in a while.

[35:42] Have you heard about it?

[35:43] No.

[35:44] Okay, we'll just go on.

[35:45] I'm a little busy.

[35:46] All right.

[35:47] Well, we'll see.

[35:49] You guys all have to see if that mystery pin comes to fruition in 2019.

[35:53] Next in our list is.

[35:54] What is the mystery pin?

[35:56] Well, it's a mystery, Ted.

[35:57] If I told you it would be a mystery.

[35:59] No, I mean, who's coming out with it?

[36:02] What kind of mystery?

[36:03] That's all the mystery.

[36:04] What I'll tell you is this.

[36:07] It is going to visually blow everyone away.

[36:13] I hope I know it will.

[36:15] It's going to be.

[36:16] It's going to be.

[36:17] It's going to be.

[36:19] It's going to be amazing.

[36:22] I haven't seen much.

[36:24] And I'm going to be honest.

[36:25] I haven't seen much on purpose.

[36:28] But I hope it happens.

[36:29] It is a total mystery.

[36:32] When it gets reveal.

[36:33] It's going to be a very interesting.

[36:34] No.

[36:35] No, it's not from one end.

[36:36] It's the completely new thing.

[36:38] Completely new thing.

[36:39] But it's not trying to do what everyone else out there is doing in this sense of like trying

[36:45] to compete with Stern, you know, with Stern volume and Stern pricing.

[36:50] There's, there's, it's just going to be something that if it happens, I think it's going

[36:53] to be very special.

[36:54] I think people are going to want it in the collector world.

[36:58] And I look forward to eventually being able to talk more about it.

[37:02] Like I can't.

[37:03] That's.

[37:04] No problem.

[37:05] I'm not a problem.

[37:06] When is this, what's the time schedule in this one?

[37:07] I don't know.

[37:08] We're after way.

[37:09] We would see.

[37:10] So hopefully in 2019, you guys will be like, well, we heard it on Canadian pinball podcast.

[37:17] The next is P3 multi-morphic.

[37:20] Okay.

[37:21] So the news here is that Jerry is announcing that there are going to be new elements being

[37:26] added to the game into the lower play field area.

[37:28] So you know, his whole system is modular so you can swap stuff in and out.

[37:33] What do you think that means for multi-morphic in 2019?

[37:38] To be honest with you, all those kind of companies that have that kind of stuff, I have so little

[37:43] interest in that I don't know much about it.

[37:46] I mean, it seems, you know, kind of maybe for the younger generation that are into this

[37:50] stuff, but you know, I just like to straight pinball stuff, not only that crazy stuff.

[37:54] Right.

[37:55] No.

[37:56] That's just me.

[37:57] Look, it's not just you Ted.

[37:58] I mean, P3 multi-morphic.

[38:01] I think it's safe to say they've failed to capture the imagination of the broader pinball

[38:06] community and I think you're within that community Ted.

[38:10] Jerry's got to do something.

[38:12] You know, and this sounds like a new sort of mechanical change.

[38:16] He's implementing into the system itself.

[38:19] Two date and P3 has been around for many, many years.

[38:23] Two date, I think roughly less than 50 of them have actually been manufactured and put

[38:29] into consumer homes.

[38:31] He's got to do something and I like Jerry and everyone does.

[38:35] Everyone likes Jerry as a person.

[38:37] But my prediction for 2019 is that they won't go far enough and by that, I mean, they need

[38:44] to get a license theme onto this platform and do something magical to get the interest

[38:51] there.

[38:52] I don't think it will happen.

[38:54] I think we keep hearing like the license is expensive and this and that, but it is what

[38:59] it is.

[39:00] Like, you either need to do this to succeed or it's just going to be something that's

[39:04] not going to take off ever.

[39:06] And that's my prediction for 2019 with multi-morphic.

[39:10] Got you.

[39:11] All right.

[39:12] The next is, okay, these are the guys pinball brothers.

[39:16] And let me explain who they are because sometimes we forget.

[39:19] I even forget this.

[39:21] These are the gentlemen who bought highway pinball from Andrew highway or bailed Andrew

[39:27] out and took the reins.

[39:29] And they are also the gentlemen that declared it's over.

[39:33] They declared bankruptcy, but they are their own entity now, which is pinball brothers.

[39:38] Do you think these guys will stay in pinball and the rumor was they were going to make

[39:44] queen and possibly restart alien?

[39:49] What do you think?

[39:51] I literally know nothing about them other than what I've read from from Pinside.

[39:58] And that is that occasionally when people either write to them or call them, they give them

[40:03] some kind of help.

[40:06] I think that they would be very smart to get back into retooling, making some fixes.

[40:13] And if they can re up the license coming out with alien, it would be great.

[40:19] It's all there.

[40:20] It's ready to go.

[40:21] I mean, just need some tweaks and they know they have a seller.

[40:24] I mean, the machines are going on the market for 10 grand plus and they're selling in a

[40:28] matter of days.

[40:29] So I mean, there's obviously a demand there for them.

[40:32] For how many?

[40:33] I don't know, but there certainly is a demand there for the game.

[40:37] So I'd like to see it happen.

[40:39] I have no idea because I really don't know anything about them or what their financial setup

[40:43] is or where they would get their money to do this or anything.

[40:46] So I have no idea what's going on with that company.

[40:49] I'd love to see it happen.

[40:50] I'd love to see Ellie and continue.

[40:53] You know, right.

[40:54] Well, here's, here's, I'm going to do two things with these guys because I think there's

[40:58] like my prediction and there's also just my, my suggestion to them.

[41:03] Alien Pimball, I agree that alien Pimball is a theme people want.

[41:07] It's a theme they really want.

[41:08] If I were them, I would definitely sort of take the elements that are working really

[41:14] well in the game.

[41:15] And if you read about what people love about alien Pimball, it's the music.

[41:19] It's the modes.

[41:20] It's the callouts.

[41:22] It's like people, the experience of playing the machine I hear from the owners is like,

[41:27] it's like, unlike anything else out there.

[41:29] And a lot of it is just like the way it pulls you into the game.

[41:33] The artwork I would redo.

[41:36] I would redo the, I wouldn't do the highway cabinets.

[41:38] You put it in a standard cabinet, a standard wide body, get a great artist to do the art

[41:44] package on the play field, on the cabinets, on the back box and re-release it because

[41:49] the other hard work is done, the geometry, the layout, the coding, all that's done.

[41:55] I don't think they're going to do it, but that's what I would suggest that they do.

[41:58] Now they already have stuff that's already paid for.

[42:00] Why would they pay for it again?

[42:01] Well, because Andrew Highway cut a lot of corners.

[42:05] He lied to us when he said, oh, you can't hand draw the artwork for alien.

[42:09] Bullshit.

[42:10] Because then we saw the hand draw on artwork on the back box when he had more time and

[42:17] more money to put at it.

[42:19] We got a lot of lies.

[42:21] A lot of lies when he was pitching the game.

[42:24] My prediction for pinball brothers though, real simple, nada, nothing's happening.

[42:29] Nobody is ever going to spend money on this company.

[42:33] Clean pinball is, I don't think it's going to happen.

[42:35] I just think with all the manufacturers that are out there actually putting pinball machines

[42:40] in boxes, these gentlemen who have been successful at other areas of business should stick to

[42:47] those other areas and get the fuck out of pinball immediately.

[42:51] How would they get the lies?

[42:52] It's amazing that Stern hasn't tied up the license to Queen a long time ago.

[42:57] That's very broad.

[42:58] Yeah, I'm amazed too because with the Queen movie out this year, it would have been a perfect

[43:01] time to release a Queen pinball machine.

[43:03] I'm also amazed that Stern hasn't watched the calamity that was alien and just go get

[43:08] the rights and make the alien machine that we all deserve because you can't tell me the

[43:14] license holder is not like, can't be happy with how their IP has been destroyed by highway

[43:21] pinball in terms of its pinball presence.

[43:24] All right, here's the next one.

[43:27] This is a weird game, Ted.

[43:29] There's not much about this.

[43:30] There's hardly anything.

[43:32] Time shock by so much.

[43:35] I started a pinball.

[43:36] I started a thing on a pinstripe about that said, why isn't there more conversation about

[43:41] time shock?

[43:42] You know why there's not?

[43:44] Nothing's happening.

[43:45] I don't know.

[43:46] This game was announced four years ago.

[43:49] Do you think we'll finally see it in 2019?

[43:52] Well, they said we're going to see it.

[43:55] They said they're making it.

[43:56] But did they say what year?

[43:59] I hope that's what they meant when they said time shock.

[44:04] It's shocking how long it's going to take to make.

[44:08] When you find out how long it's going to take it, that'll be a shock.

[44:11] Yeah, they're going to be.

[44:12] Who knows?

[44:13] I hope it does.

[44:14] Again, it's another science fiction type thing.

[44:16] It's right up my alley.

[44:17] I like it.

[44:18] I hope it happens.

[44:19] We just have to wait and see.

[44:22] Right.

[44:23] Let's talk about a virus.

[44:25] They just announced a time shock comes out the day after you die.

[44:30] Get your orders in today.

[44:33] The next company in our list is Spooky Pimball.

[44:36] What kind of year is Spooky going to have?

[44:37] We know Alice Cooper and Nightmare Castle still not really shipping.

[44:42] Does Scott and E.C. game number two come out as well?

[44:45] What do you think 2019 holds for Spooky?

[44:47] A lot of people have said they really like the Alice Cooper road game.

[44:53] It's their best game so far.

[44:57] Again, I think Spooky is going to get better with every game.

[45:02] I think that's going to continue.

[45:03] I wasn't crazy about the nuclear meltdown annihilation.com, whatever that was, because it's just

[45:11] not my type of game.

[45:14] I think they're doing everything the right way.

[45:17] They're taking their time.

[45:18] They're doing small runs.

[45:19] They're moving on to another thing.

[45:21] They're taking consignments.

[45:23] They're building a company.

[45:25] I think I like Spooky.

[45:27] I think they're doing a lot of good stuff.

[45:29] I think 2019 just more sort of Spooky growing, getting better and continuing to stay profitable.

[45:37] We have to commend any Pimball company that has made a profit.

[45:42] There should just be a separate Pimball profit hall of fame.

[45:46] It's literally, you could count on one hand the Pimball companies in the last five years

[45:52] that have actually turned a profit.

[45:54] Are you ready?

[45:55] Stern, Spooky, and Chicago gaming company.

[46:00] Nobody else has made a profit.

[46:02] Really?

[46:03] Who else is there?

[46:04] You think Jersey Jack has made a profit?

[46:06] If you add a Jersey Jack in the total of its existence, there's no way they're in the

[46:10] green.

[46:11] I took Manchester's here.

[46:15] Well, I mean, ever.

[46:17] There's no way.

[46:19] There's just no way.

[46:20] Okay.

[46:21] Okay.

[46:22] Okay.

[46:23] So Spooky in 2019, my prediction is that I think you're right.

[46:28] They're going to be fine.

[46:29] I think Charlie has always structured his company where they bite off as much as they can

[46:34] chew.

[46:35] No surprises there.

[46:36] I do think Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle, the delay in getting that game out, is going

[46:42] to come back to bite them.

[46:43] And here's how.

[46:44] I think the $1,000 non-refundable deposits people had to put down all the way back.

[46:52] Remember, this game was revealed at Texas Pimball Festival.

[46:55] That is literally like eight, nine months ago, maybe more, right?

[46:59] So I can't do the math in my head on months, but we're quickly coming up on to March.

[47:05] It literally is going to hurt them because I think what's going to happen is 500 Alice

[47:10] Cooper's to me is too many in the sense that now Charlie's got to make this game for an

[47:16] entire year.

[47:18] And I think once people see a viral and monsters, they're going to want to jump out and get

[47:27] those titles and they're going to be locked in.

[47:30] Nobody in the history of Pimball Ted that I've been since I've been following this hobby

[47:35] has ever made a deposit non-refundable.

[47:40] How much when Alice Cooper comes out, how much is it going to cost?

[47:43] So it's 65, around like $6,500.

[47:45] Okay, so $6,500.

[47:47] So for $1,000 more, you can get a monster bet.

[47:51] Yeah.

[47:52] Well, and for $1,000 less, you can get a monster's pro.

[47:57] And for $1,500 less, you can get a Thunderbirds.

[48:01] Nobody want you.

[48:02] You can't.

[48:03] There's a Thunderbirds for sale right now for $3,200 bucks and nobody bought it.

[48:10] Maybe it was $52,000.

[48:11] No, I think it was $3,200.

[48:12] The guys just try to just give it away.

[48:14] I know at this point.

[48:16] But, yeah, so I'm looking forward to the viral.

[48:19] That's another one thing.

[48:20] We're going to get to this hold on.

[48:23] I just want to finish off on spooky.

[48:25] So my prediction is, I think that's going to bite Charlie.

[48:27] I think it's going to create ill will within his buyer base.

[48:32] I don't think we're going to see Scott and E.C. game number two next year.

[48:38] I don't think it, I think spooky just needs to get all the Aldous Cooper's made.

[48:42] And I think it's going to take up his whole year.

[48:44] I also think it's going to burn them out a little bit.

[48:46] I do.

[48:47] I think this game has sort of already started to burn them out in terms of like the delay

[48:53] and the excitement for the game is going to really start to dissipate.

[48:58] And meanwhile, most people are going to be locked in with the inability to exit their

[49:02] agreement with spooky.

[49:03] And I just think it's going to, I think it's going to kind of backfire on them.

[49:06] That's my prediction.

[49:07] Spooky's going to be fine, but I think the feeling of good will with the company is going

[49:15] to start to erode with the way he did this deal.

[49:18] All right.

[49:19] Well, I think the people that put down $1,000 a new, it was non-refundable.

[49:24] It really, really people that want an Aldous Cooper pinball machine.

[49:28] That's my hope.

[49:29] It's not going to turn around and cause ill will.

[49:32] I'm taking it for granted.

[49:33] These people put that down.

[49:34] They knew what they were doing.

[49:35] They really want that machine.

[49:37] But I don't think they realized how long the delay was.

[49:41] And I think a lot of people in pinball see people are spoiled, Ted.

[49:45] And this is why I think people, you know, Stern spoils everybody because the people are

[49:50] used to being able to like order their machine, get it within a few months, play it, enjoy it.

[49:55] If they don't like it, they sell it.

[49:57] If they like it, they might keep it a year, but they can always sell it.

[50:00] Most people are not nowadays as much as they say they're okay with waiting, they're

[50:05] not.

[50:06] And even though they get on the wagon, they were told by Chuck and company to expect their

[50:12] game much sooner than this.

[50:15] And I think Jersey Jack is burn people.

[50:18] Now spooky is burn people.

[50:19] I think the money is going to go.

[50:22] Okay, did you hear that little glitch that just happened on this interview?

[50:26] So what happened was Skype cut out on us for like 30 seconds.

[50:30] So what I meant to say during this period is I think the money is going to go to the games

[50:34] that are available in new inbox.

[50:37] The manufacturer is like in ship you game in a timely fashion.

[50:41] That's going to be where people gravitate towards in 2019.

[50:45] And we hear Ted and I are going to discuss Stern.

[50:47] Okay, just so you know my phone cut out there for like 30 seconds.

[50:51] Okay, that's fine.

[50:52] I was talking.

[50:53] That's good.

[50:54] We always say, is there like a 30 second period where you like you wanted to change your

[51:01] mind on your Thunderbirds assessment that we didn't get or no.

[51:10] So we know monsters is coming out.

[51:12] It's not a rumor.

[51:13] The rumor for next year is that we're also going to see Elvira 3, which I know just you

[51:20] probably already ordered this year.

[51:23] This year 2019 Elvira 3 monsters.

[51:26] I heard Brian Eddie's game is going to be James Bond.

[51:31] And then a new Steve Richie original title or one of you know it might be one of it.

[51:36] You know like black night 3000 or high speed 3.

[51:40] I don't know.

[51:41] Okay.

[51:42] So what do you think 2019 holds for Stern?

[51:46] More cool stuff.

[51:49] I mean, monsters again would be a very cool theme.

[51:53] It's sort of you know, bum me out a little bit when the rumor came up that the premium

[51:59] edition was going to be all black and white, which I don't like because I don't think

[52:05] it those kind of machines I'd ever spring for an LED.

[52:08] I would just go for the premium, but I wouldn't go for an all, you know, black and white

[52:12] one when I think the color, the color one looks really, really cool.

[52:15] So that was the only negative.

[52:17] If it's true, that was the only negative on that.

[52:19] So I'm really looking forward to seeing and playing the monsters.

[52:23] And we're going to see it next week.

[52:25] So it's not going to be very long.

[52:26] I mean, they're going to show it at CES.

[52:29] So L.Vir 3, Ted.

[52:31] I mean, it's just like your dream title.

[52:32] Like if they if this happens with Francia and Art, like you in the bizarre, they haven't

[52:38] put out anything on it.

[52:40] Not even a name.

[52:41] We don't even know what they're calling the game.

[52:43] We're just calling it L.Vir 3.

[52:44] We don't even know what that one name of the game is.

[52:48] Well, because they fucked up the announcement at T.P.F.

[52:50] It wasn't supposed to happen.

[52:51] It literally wasn't a mistake.

[52:54] Well, I mean, yeah, but we know now.

[52:56] So I mean, they could give us at least a little bit of a crumb, but at least we know

[52:59] it's coming out.

[53:00] So that's been confirmed.

[53:02] Well, Byred told some people herself that she was working on some sound thing.

[53:06] So I mean, we know it's coming out.

[53:08] And according to her, someone that they say, it's pretty far along.

[53:13] It's not like it's to just start now.

[53:15] It's just thing is pretty far.

[53:17] How do you think, how do you think Monster sells Ted?

[53:19] Because you're big in the horror genre.

[53:21] And that's a very like popular, but still much nearser than like Adam's family or Batman.

[53:29] I don't know.

[53:31] I think it's going to sell well.

[53:32] I mean, this is the stuff that we all love.

[53:35] I mean, this is the stuff that the people that have money want to buy.

[53:38] Even young people, everybody loves the monsters.

[53:41] I mean, it was just a fun, funny show.

[53:43] And it's just amazing how I watched a few of them a couple of weeks ago.

[53:47] It's just amazing how so it's so crazy.

[53:50] It holds up.

[53:51] I mean, I still find myself laughing at the stupidest jokes just because, you know, having Fred

[53:56] Quinn delivered a line with that voice and you're laughing or writing before even opening

[54:00] his mouth.

[54:01] It's just a fun, it's just a fun show.

[54:04] I don't know if young people are into monsters, but I think the pinball buying community is

[54:09] definitely into monsters.

[54:12] Yeah, look, so your prediction for Stern is another good year for Stern?

[54:17] Yeah, yeah, I think, well, they're starting out already with monsters and what was the other

[54:25] one?

[54:26] Well, that's all we know is monsters and then possibly Elvira 3.

[54:30] Elvira 3, so I mean maybe James Bond.

[54:34] We also know that Stern has the Godzilla license.

[54:37] We know that they have.

[54:39] James got the Pulp Fiction license that we floated that around last year.

[54:43] Godzilla would be big.

[54:46] Right, but it's like the Toho Godzilla.

[54:48] It's more like the obscure Japanese one, not the...

[54:51] Well, is there really like a difference?

[54:54] It's fucking Godzilla.

[54:55] Like you know what I'm saying?

[54:56] It's like, I don't...

[54:58] Most people I know don't compartmentalize their Godzilla's based upon like Toho versus

[55:02] whatever.

[55:03] Yeah, well, I mean, you know, if they want to do an original theme, you know, the

[55:09] you look and see what's what these big sellers are with all games.

[55:13] People really want to come up with a machine that's like Mars attacks attack from Mars.

[55:21] What the hell is the other one?

[55:23] All of the science fiction and stuff out there just put it together in a machine, big bang

[55:26] bar, pull stuff from these machines, put together a thing with flying sources and ray

[55:30] guns and all this stuff and then they'll fly off the shelf.

[55:33] Yeah, well, you know, it's curious like why don't we see more like Battlestar Galactica?

[55:37] Why don't we see another reimagination of Star Trek?

[55:40] Well, we need that.

[55:41] An original theme is fine.

[55:42] I mean, some of the biggest sellers out there are original themes.

[55:46] Attack from Mars is an original theme and so is medieval madness.

[55:49] Yeah, but I would argue that if you look at in most recent history, original themes are

[55:55] not big sellers anymore.

[55:58] But look at what they are.

[56:00] But look at dialed in.

[56:01] I mean, it's Jersey Jack's worst selling game.

[56:05] It's a fantastic game.

[56:07] I've played it.

[56:08] I've played it with you.

[56:09] But again, like they so it's a great pinball shooter for sure, but it's also his worst selling

[56:16] game.

[56:17] All right.

[56:18] And if it would have just been a alien's attack type of thing, what more flying sources

[56:23] and buildings be right, it would have sold a lot more.

[56:25] Right.

[56:26] Yeah.

[56:27] I mean, I think we all agree that if it was a, you know, escape from like attack from Quantum

[56:32] City or escape from Quantum City.

[56:34] And it was more fun.

[56:35] I think that game failed because the callouts are so damn boring that there's no personality

[56:41] in dialed in.

[56:42] You play it and it's just like it's just lacking in the call.

[56:46] Well, is anybody saying that dialed in as a failure?

[56:48] It didn't so well.

[56:49] Yeah.

[56:50] I mean, you have to look at it.

[56:51] Yeah.

[56:52] Look, you give Pat Lawler one of the greatest designers of all time, a blank check to make

[56:57] a game for you.

[56:58] This is Pat Lawler's big return to pinball and he can't even sell you like more than

[57:03] the hobbit.

[57:06] So anyway, so let's stick to Stern because we already did Jersey deck.

[57:09] So Stern pinball, my prediction is, of course, it's going to be another good year for

[57:14] Stern.

[57:15] I think Stern pinball in 2019 is going to fire on all cylinders.

[57:22] And by that, if you've looked at the last few years of Stern pinball, they are the one

[57:27] company to me that continues to improve themselves in the right areas every year.

[57:34] And I know we give them shit about not working on the mechanisms and the toys.

[57:40] But they literally have made improvements to the pinball experience that were significant

[57:48] every year from the node boards making it simpler to fix the games.

[57:54] I know people complain about the node boards, but they're really simple.

[57:57] They're really popping it out.

[57:58] The LCD, the artwork, Ted's like, right, I mean, Stern win and got the best artist in the

[58:04] industry.

[58:05] They keep making the games better.

[58:07] Now, there's still work to be done at Stern, but I think in 2019, we are going to see

[58:11] Stern fire on all cylinders.

[58:15] I think it's going to be a very bad year for everyone else who's not named Stern.

[58:23] Okay.

[58:25] Okay.

[58:26] That's my set.

[58:27] And I'm just saying, I think they're coming and look, I think there's going to be a few

[58:31] surprises we don't know about.

[58:33] And I just, I keep hearing rumblings within the world of Stern that are whispering in my

[58:41] ear that just like literally like it's going to be an end game scenario for a lot of these

[58:49] companies in 2019.

[58:50] And I'll talk about that in my final assessment.

[58:53] Before we do that, because I do want to ask your overall assessment of what things going

[58:55] to happen next year, Ted, the last one on our list is team pin balls, the mafia.

[59:00] This is the one you were thinking about earlier.

[59:02] This single level game for $7,500, where they're only making nothing 25 of them.

[59:07] Okay.

[59:08] Again, this is going to be a game that's for going to be for a small amount of people.

[59:12] I mean, they're making it just a few of them and it's fine.

[59:15] But you know, I mean, there are a lot of games out ramps that I like the old games, not

[59:20] too much of the new stuff.

[59:22] I mean, I enjoy now the games like, you know, scared stiff.

[59:26] I mean, I like to have the ramps and iron maiden is really cool.

[59:32] I like games like that.

[59:33] So, you know, I don't know about it.

[59:35] I don't know about that.

[59:36] Look, the team pinball, they're going to be gone.

[59:45] These guys use their own money, their own capital to make this game.

[59:51] They didn't catch on whether you call it a founder's edition or whatever marketing spin.

[59:57] They did the worst market research ever.

[01:00:00] There is no market research that would tell you that the way to succeed and pinball these

[01:00:04] days is to make a single level game based on mafia characters that are wearing 10 gallon

[01:00:10] hats that look like they're left over from a western movie.

[01:00:14] I mean, literally, the whole thing confuses me.

[01:00:18] I wish they would have done a little bit more market research before deciding to invest

[01:00:22] their own capital in this kind of pinball machine.

[01:00:26] Nothing personal against them, but they've just learned a hard lesson.

[01:00:29] I think a lot of people think if you just make a pinball machine, it will sell.

[01:00:33] And I think the mafia is the perfect example of that's not the case.

[01:00:38] Okay, well, again, we'll see on that.

[01:00:41] I mean, but there are a lot of, you know, people that just, you know, there's a Prano's

[01:00:45] fans that like that sort of thing that if they have that kind of decor in their house

[01:00:49] would may want more of those.

[01:00:50] It's just so few machines.

[01:00:52] So, you know, they may sell out.

[01:00:53] I don't know.

[01:00:54] No, they haven't sold out.

[01:00:56] And I don't think they will.

[01:00:57] So Ted, what is your overall if you were to summarize your assessment of the pinball hobby

[01:01:04] in 2019?

[01:01:06] What would you take on what kind of year it will be?

[01:01:08] It's, it's, I don't know.

[01:01:11] It's so crazy to me because, you know, pinball before when you only had a couple of companies

[01:01:15] doing it like, you know, Stern and and Jersey jacket, then maybe some, you know, they'd

[01:01:20] do that like Captain Nemo or something.

[01:01:22] Some would do 10 or 20 machines out there just as a, a boutique thing was, was kind of fine.

[01:01:28] Now that you're having four or five, six, seven, eight major companies out there that are

[01:01:32] trying to come out with at least one game a year, if not two games a year or more.

[01:01:37] Now the, the, the play field at that six to eight thousand dollar range is getting pretty

[01:01:44] damn crowded.

[01:01:45] And, you know, you can't buy everything.

[01:01:47] So, you know, something's going to happen.

[01:01:50] It went from, you know, pinball was this little thing coming back for the few.

[01:01:55] Now, all of a sudden, we have plenty to choose from.

[01:01:59] I mean, it's going to be, you know, this coming year is going to be very tough with all these

[01:02:05] games between the monster bash and monsters and Elvira and James Bond and Toy Story,

[01:02:13] Willie Walker.

[01:02:14] I mean, it's just, it's insane how much, you know, competition there's going to be out

[01:02:18] there for that money.

[01:02:19] And I'm taking for granted that, that a lot of people are like me.

[01:02:23] Yeah, you could afford to buy, you know, a machine or two a year or whatever, but you certainly

[01:02:27] can't buy everything.

[01:02:28] So what's going to fall by the wayside?

[01:02:31] Who knows?

[01:02:32] Interesting next couple of years to check it out.

[01:02:35] I couldn't agree more with you Ted and I think you're spot on.

[01:02:40] I think here's what's going to happen in 2019.

[01:02:44] Gary Stern is going to play the role of Thanos and he is going to snap his fingers and half

[01:02:52] of these companies are going to be gone.

[01:02:53] They're going to just disintegrate in 2019.

[01:02:57] It is going to happen.

[01:02:58] And you're right Ted and you know why it's going to happen?

[01:03:01] Because all these other companies are doing it wrong.

[01:03:04] They're trying to compete with Stern at Stern's price point and they can't possibly compete

[01:03:11] with the themes and the cadence of which Stern can get games into the marketplace.

[01:03:17] And so what you have now is a bunch of companies failing at doing what Stern does better than

[01:03:24] them with better themes and better frequency, better efficiencies, better customer service,

[01:03:29] all the stuff.

[01:03:30] And as much as people want to root against Stern, literally I think the fact that we can

[01:03:35] say in 2019, Ted, it's safe to say that Stern will give us four to five new pinball machines

[01:03:40] at least next year that we will own and have the ability to buy.

[01:03:45] With everyone else, it's always a question mark.

[01:03:48] It's always like do I really want that theme?

[01:03:51] It's like we have to convince ourselves to support these other companies.

[01:03:55] I think it's going to be a very interesting year.

[01:03:58] But I think you're going to see 2019 is going to be a year where the economy is going

[01:04:03] to start to dip.

[01:04:04] And when that happens, people are only going to buy what they trust.

[01:04:08] And I think the companies that are hanging on by thin ice and by a thread are all going

[01:04:15] to go away.

[01:04:16] And I mean that.

[01:04:17] I'm still just enjoying your Thanos equation.

[01:04:20] It's going to happen.

[01:04:22] You literally, everyone else, everyone woke Stern up.

[01:04:26] And they heard the complaints.

[01:04:28] Stern artwork looks like shit.

[01:04:29] What did they do?

[01:04:30] They went and got the best artwork.

[01:04:32] Stern never updates their codes.

[01:04:34] The games are like, you know, unfinished for two years.

[01:04:37] What did they do?

[01:04:38] They hired all these coders.

[01:04:39] Now code is being finished in record time.

[01:04:41] Stern games like lack the magic and the fun.

[01:04:45] You're going to see that in the games.

[01:04:46] Like literally.

[01:04:47] So then what?

[01:04:48] And then they give you the games, Ted, within a few weeks of revealing them.

[01:04:52] Like the monsters pro Ted, it's on the line.

[01:04:55] It's not even revealed yet.

[01:04:58] And the game is on the line.

[01:05:00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:05:01] I mean, hey, you know, but it's, yeah, they're the biggest.

[01:05:06] They're set up for it.

[01:05:07] They're, yeah, they're the top dog right now.

[01:05:10] And that's, you know, probably the way it's going to be, you know, for a while.

[01:05:13] So I sort of agree with that.

[01:05:14] I think some of these companies may make go by the wayside that are not just the boutique

[01:05:20] companies that know to only make, you know, a few hundred machines and then move on.

[01:05:24] And, you know, keep your line moving and not too many of them seem to be able to do

[01:05:28] that.

[01:05:29] So, so yeah, I like the Thanos.

[01:05:32] It's going to happen.

[01:05:33] Like we, every start I could just see him sitting in a room with his love on him.

[01:05:37] Just putting one stone in after the other.

[01:05:38] Yeah, that's what he's going to do.

[01:05:40] He's literally collected all the infinity stones of pinball.

[01:05:44] And it's just going to, it's just going to be over.

[01:05:46] I mean, people don't realize how hard it is to make a profit in pinball.

[01:05:54] Yeah.

[01:05:55] Well, like how's Deeproot with all that investor capital?

[01:05:58] Like let's say, for example, they have $13 million.

[01:06:01] They've been spending it now for months.

[01:06:04] How are they going to make that up?

[01:06:05] Yeah, buy sales.

[01:06:07] So they better have sales.

[01:06:09] But by selling a game at the same investors.

[01:06:11] Well, they already said that they want to sell the games at like a lower price than starting

[01:06:15] to you.

[01:06:16] You can't do it.

[01:06:18] I just want to see them make the people hold the pistol where their money on the property

[01:06:25] should be.

[01:06:26] That's all.

[01:06:27] If they do that, we happy.

[01:06:28] Right.

[01:06:29] I'll say this.

[01:06:30] I think it's going to be very interesting here for pinball.

[01:06:33] Every year is interesting for pinball.

[01:06:34] Let's be honest.

[01:06:35] I mean, we've been pretty accurate on this show before about sort of proclaiming what we

[01:06:41] think is going to happen.

[01:06:42] And I think we get a lot of pushback.

[01:06:44] I was saying Ted shows too negative.

[01:06:46] Canate is a fatalist.

[01:06:48] I'd rather just focus.

[01:06:49] But.

[01:06:50] So you have me here for exactly Ted.

[01:06:52] You know, if you listen to Ted, he hopes everything works out.

[01:06:55] I hope you like a terrible financial advisor.

[01:06:59] You'd be like totally enrawns.

[01:07:01] I hope they got good guys.

[01:07:03] I let's go.

[01:07:04] Well, you know what?

[01:07:07] I just hope everyone that starts a business does well.

[01:07:11] I don't wish ill on anyone.

[01:07:12] I want to see them succeed if they if they make the wrong decisions and they go out

[01:07:16] of business, that's on them.

[01:07:17] But I'm certainly not going to, you know, say anything bad about that.

[01:07:20] Well, Ted, you know, unless unless you know, you hire a scumbag, then I'll say,

[01:07:25] it's.

[01:07:26] And I've hung out with Ted a few times.

[01:07:29] We have to hang out again soon.

[01:07:31] No pinball.

[01:07:32] These from poor house.

[01:07:33] Exactly.

[01:07:34] I was just.

[01:07:35] I just.

[01:07:36] No pinball experience.

[01:07:37] I don't care how magical it is.

[01:07:40] Like what kind of world undergloss?

[01:07:42] No pinball experience is as much fun as having cigars and whiskey with Ted at a steakhouse.

[01:07:48] That is true.

[01:07:49] Right?

[01:07:50] And if you and pin starters have come down to take me up on that.

[01:07:53] And it doesn't cost you $9,000 for $9,000.

[01:07:57] We could do that every weekend for the rest of our lives.

[01:07:59] Yes.

[01:08:00] Well, let's let's do that.

[01:08:01] Let's do one of these things from will invite, we'll invite a couple people down because

[01:08:05] there are some local people.

[01:08:06] All right.

[01:08:07] Well, down there, we'll go in the back room.

[01:08:08] We have our own clubhouse room back there.

[01:08:10] We'll hang out.

[01:08:11] We'll have some tequila some whiskey some cigars and some food and we'll do a little

[01:08:15] podcast.

[01:08:16] I'm going to Uber it there so I can get home safe and really adult.

[01:08:19] Yes.

[01:08:20] Yes, that would be that would be something to see.

[01:08:23] All right.

[01:08:24] It would be great.

[01:08:25] We'll do it like two or three of us will call it like three drunk guys talk about pinball.

[01:08:30] It'll be phenomenal.

[01:08:31] Let's call it head to head to head to head to head pinball.

[01:08:34] Yes.

[01:08:35] Yes.

[01:08:36] So all right.

[01:08:37] All right, Ted.

[01:08:38] Have a great night.

[01:08:39] Thank you so much for joining us and for being so optimistic about the hobby.

[01:08:43] No problem.

[01:08:44] Say hi to Gary Thanos Stern for me and hopefully we'll do this again soon.

[01:08:48] I feel like when he snaps his finger like your eyes going to disappear in that moment too.

[01:08:52] It'd be like, what did that is?

[01:08:54] What?

[01:08:55] Oh God.

[01:08:56] Yeah.

[01:08:57] If like John Papaduke just like turns into like black dust and like Gary just like smokes

[01:09:04] a minute dooby.

[01:09:05] All right.

[01:09:06] Everyone we're at a time.

[01:09:08] We love you all you guys.

[01:09:09] Thanks for listening.

[01:09:10] Ted, thank you.

[01:09:11] I just immigrated.

[01:09:12] Bye.
