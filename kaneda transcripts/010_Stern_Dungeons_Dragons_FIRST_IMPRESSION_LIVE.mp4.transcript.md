[01:25] I wish they would let us know so as content creators could like actually plan.

[01:30] I think they're doing this.

[01:32] Yeah, they let the other content creators know.

[03:56] the tyrant's eye is worth it.

[03:58] How's everybody doing?

[03:59] Happy Friday.

[04:01] I know it's early.

[04:02] I didn't want to do this right now.

[04:04] I don't want to be on this right now.

[04:06] I wanted to be having some whiskey and talk for an hour.

[04:11] Now I'm hearing that people are going live

[04:14] with their first impressions in like 10 minutes.

[04:16] I don't know what that's about.

[04:19] Join on YouTube people.

[04:20] This is a terrible video.

[04:21] Okay, I'm closing out.

[04:23] I'm closing out of, go to YouTube, go to YouTube.

[04:38] I need a drink before I see this game.

[04:40] I don't know about you, but I need a little bit.

[04:42] It's a little nip, a little nip.

[04:44] All right, hold on a second.

[04:47] Oh!

[04:49] Don't you do this, Stern.

[04:53] You get this.

[04:55] Sure.

[05:00] Hm.

[05:24] I feel like we need something good because it's new pin launch day.

[05:28] Have they have their launch to yet?

[05:32] I feel like.

[05:33] All right, everybody we in the house.

[05:36] We ready for this.

[05:39] Well here's what we're drinking.

[05:40] Here's what we're drinking.

[05:42] We're drinking the Yamakasi baby.

[05:45] The Yamakasi tyrants eye.

[05:47] Just a little tiny ice cube in there.

[05:50] Let's have some.

[05:51] All right.

[05:52] A little nip, a little nip to get all of this in the mood because I think we've got

[05:56] nine minutes.

[05:57] Now I thought I had in hour I was in my bubble bath.

[06:00] You know me.

[06:03] Oh, that's about that's a $50 that's a $50 glass of whiskey in a restaurant Brenda.

[06:11] Here we are.

[06:12] Ah, at least pronounce your drink right it what it's not.

[06:17] Yamakasi.

[06:18] Yam.

[06:19] Oh Yamazaki.

[06:20] Oh yeah, that's way.

[06:21] Yamazaki.

[06:22] Yamazaki baby.

[06:25] Yamazaki.

[06:26] I'm all fired up baby.

[06:28] I'm all D&D.

[06:30] Is it going to have enough in it?

[06:32] Soloncha everybody.

[06:33] Happy Friday by the way.

[06:35] Oh, the 12 year is sweet.

[06:42] Oh, the 12 year goes down beautifully.

[06:47] Like I hope everyone's ready to see this new game.

[06:50] This is going to be an interesting moment.

[06:53] Stern pinball.

[06:55] I feel like they need to hit.

[06:58] I feel like they need to hit and I'm worried about this game.

[07:02] I'll tell you why I'm worried.

[07:03] I just don't know like how most of us are going to have an emotional attachment to D&D.

[07:08] I mean, I went and bought this t-shirt today.

[07:10] I did not own this t-shirt.

[07:12] I hope the artwork looks like this.

[07:16] What I'm worried about with this game is when you think about when you make a movie

[07:22] pin and you can't wait to see how they translate those moments in the movie you love so much.

[07:31] Big Lebouse is a perfect example of that.

[07:33] Tron is a perfect example of that.

[07:35] Star Wars is a perfect example of that.

[07:37] Lord, the rings is a perfect example of that.

[07:41] What moment of D&D are you like you can't wait to see how they translated into a pinball

[07:47] experience?

[07:49] That's the thing I'm nervous about with this game is like I just don't know like what

[07:54] they're going to do and what stuff you even want to see.

[07:58] Now you could argue that that's actually working in their benefit because it's going to

[08:02] lower your expectations of this game.

[08:05] But boy man, man, no, man, no, chef, it's like this game.

[08:09] I'm really hoping we see some magic when we see this game.

[08:12] The dragon on the premium and Ellie is full motion.

[08:15] You can bash it from all sides and it and retro Ralph, like what are you doing, buddy?

[08:21] What are you doing?

[08:22] I don't need info.

[08:27] It's in the chat.

[08:30] We're going to see it in 10 minutes.

[08:31] Retro Ralph, I don't get it.

[08:32] Like do you have the do you have assets?

[08:34] Retro Ralph.

[08:36] I feel like Zach Sharp hooked up his boys with content and assets and I don't really care,

[08:44] man.

[08:45] I don't really care.

[08:46] I want to see it when everybody else sees it.

[08:49] My worry about this game is that a lot of it's going to be on the screen like going through

[08:56] dungeons and choosing your own adventure and whether or not that's going to work.

[09:01] Yeah.

[09:02] So Retro Ralph does not have this stuff.

[09:05] So look, I heard that the thing they yanked out of the game is the wings of the dragon.

[09:12] I think they wanted to have dragon wings flapping and I don't think they can make it work out.

[09:18] So gang, gang, grab a drink.

[09:20] I think we might only have five more minutes.

[09:25] This might not happen in five minutes and if it doesn't, then we're going to go back

[09:31] and I'm going to go back in my bubble bath and I'll see you guys in an hour.

[09:35] But I think this is the moment.

[09:36] I think you normally knew an Eastern standard time, you know, 11, 11th central.

[09:43] Sounds about right.

[09:51] Doesn't spit the balls on the probe.

[09:55] What's up, gentlemen?

[09:57] We got 91 people, 91 sad souls in here right now.

[10:02] I don't know.

[10:03] I just, I can't wait to see it.

[10:05] I can't wait to see it.

[10:06] I can't wait to see if this is, this is what we're drinking.

[10:12] This is what we're drinking.

[10:15] Always I always enunciate this the right way.

[10:17] The Yamazaki Yamazaki 12 people at 11, 56 AM.

[10:27] Before noon, I'm drinking.

[10:29] No breakfast in me.

[10:31] We're keeping it classy.

[10:33] We're keeping it canada style.

[10:35] This is what your Patreon subscription money goes to.

[10:39] Aiding and abetting my terrible adult behavior.

[10:42] Come on people, you know, $5 a month, ain't going to buy bottles.

[10:45] A Yamazaki 12.

[10:47] You can get the basic stuff.

[10:49] But come on, we got up the ante, baby.

[10:50] Raise the roof people who's in the house right now.

[10:53] We got the dragon.

[10:56] The dragon is going to fireballs.

[10:58] Oh, yeah.

[10:59] Yeah, man.

[11:00] Hey, let me ask you guys a question.

[11:02] Be candid.

[11:03] How many of you in the last five years have encountered a buddy or a friend who is like

[11:11] yo bro, let's talk a little bit about dungeons and dragons.

[11:15] Has that ever happened to you in the last five years?

[11:17] Have you ever walked into a bar and someone's like, yeah, yeah, man, I don't care about the

[11:21] game on.

[11:22] I care about the D and D, the new D and D book that just dropped.

[11:26] How many of you know anybody who has been waiting for D and D?

[11:29] I'm just curious.

[11:31] I know there's like a billion people out there playing it, but not a billion people, a

[11:37] billion dollars.

[11:38] It's definitely not a billion people.

[11:40] I'm just curious.

[11:42] Like who's going to like go all in?

[11:44] Brennan, there's like a huge truck blocking our driveway.

[11:47] No, is that am I just making this up?

[11:48] Like what is that?

[11:51] Delivery next door.

[11:53] I played tons of D and D from age 15 until 29.

[11:58] What happened at 29, man?

[11:59] Is that, you know, you finally got some action?

[12:01] I know what happened at 29.

[12:03] You're like, yeah, you met a girl.

[12:05] You met a girl.

[12:06] Like, isn't that what happened?

[12:07] Isn't that how it works with dungeons and dragons?

[12:09] The moment you stop playing is the moment you meet a girl.

[12:14] Makes sense.

[12:15] It makes sense.

[12:17] That's the moment you stop playing.

[12:19] I feel like the moment you stop playing D and D is the moment you lose your virginity.

[12:23] I think that's how it goes, right?

[12:24] Isn't that how it's supposed to go?

[12:26] All right.

[12:27] Let's see.

[12:28] Sounds like, okay.

[12:29] Stern, I don't know.

[12:30] Is it going to be on Stern's Facebook or is it going to be, let's see, Stern Pimbal?

[12:35] Let's go to, let's get all our bases covered.

[12:38] I can't even see.

[12:42] Any glasses?

[12:43] Do I don't have Stern Pimbal on hold on?

[12:48] Stern.

[12:49] Here we go.

[12:53] All right.

[12:55] I got Stern's Facebook page and their YouTube page on repeat or on like Reese's.

[13:04] And I'm not selling me on X-Men Stern.

[13:07] I'm tired of looking at X-Men trolleys.

[13:10] All right.

[13:12] So here we go.

[13:14] One, is it T-minus one minute?

[13:18] Let's watch it together.

[13:23] Where is it up?

[13:28] I don't see it.

[13:31] I don't see it.

[13:32] Where is it up?

[13:34] It's not on their website.

[13:36] It's on their website right now.

[13:38] All right.

[13:39] Let's go.

[13:40] Hold on a second.

[13:41] Why is it not on YouTube?

[13:42] Stern Pimbal.

[13:43] You know, why can't I just be on the social channels?

[13:48] Here we go.

[13:49] It is up.

[13:50] Okay.

[17:22] Alright, to the next one.

[17:24] Hold.

[17:27] Screenshare.

[17:31] Nah.

[17:32] Oh, gotta get out of here.

[17:39] Shit.

[17:40] Okay.

[17:45] Hey everybody, it's George Gomez at CERN Pinval.

[17:48] And we're here today to celebrate a storied franchise

[17:51] that has entertained players for over 50 years.

[17:54] I'm thrilled to present our latest game,

[17:57] Dungeons & Dragons,

[17:59] the Tyrant's Eye.

[18:02] Players will go on an epic and thrilling adventure

[18:05] into forgotten realms to battle iconic enemies

[18:08] including the most advanced animatronic dragon in Pinval.

[18:13] Wrath the relentless.

[18:15] This red dragon intelligently reacts to player action

[18:18] with multi-axis motion and features

[18:21] omnidirectional impact sensing technology

[18:24] all while breathing fire in the form of Pinval's.

[18:27] In addition to an array of flowing ramps and shots,

[18:31] the game highlights some really cool playfield toys

[18:34] that bring Dungeons & Dragons into the Pinval universe.

[18:38] You'll notice the gelatinous cube

[18:40] with magical magnet ball interaction,

[18:43] a player-controlled shield device,

[18:45] and of course, a disappearing dungeon entrance.

[18:49] A sword is only as strong as the one who wields it.

[18:53] The Tyrant's Eye is brought to life

[18:55] with custom speech and voice talent

[18:57] by a star-studded cast, including Michael Dorn.

[19:01] Come here, tasty traveler.

[19:04] Luke Gaigax.

[19:05] Nothing is impossible.

[19:07] Kevin Smith.

[19:08] Enough talk.

[19:09] Let's finish this.

[19:10] Brendan Small.

[19:11] We meet again.

[19:13] Matthew Mercer.

[19:14] You are being attacked by a gelatinous cube.

[19:16] And many more.

[19:18] We are prepared for this.

[19:19] The art on the game was created

[19:21] by prolific Dungeons & Dragons illustrator Vince Pros.

[19:24] Crazy good.

[19:25] The music was created by a world-renowned video game composer Chris Velaskov.

[19:30] Most impressive.

[19:31] And now,

[19:32] lead game designer Brian Eddy

[19:34] and software Dungeon Master Dwight Sullivan

[19:37] will take you through the pinball adventure of a lifetime.

[19:40] All I had begun is...

[19:43] But I really wanted to do in this game.

[19:45] I don't like that transition.

[19:47] The fantasy world of D&D is so rich and full of incredible stories,

[19:51] places, characters, and of course monsters and traps.

[19:54] So how will you choose to navigate the world?

[19:57] You are on the road to Darkhold.

[19:59] We've really tried our best to integrate into a pinball.

[20:01] At the start of your first game,

[20:03] players will be able to choose from four characters.

[20:06] Each character will have their own buff within the game.

[20:09] For example, the wizard has longer shield time.

[20:11] Each of your saved characters will have their own progress.

[20:14] I'm proud to fight alongside you.

[20:16] Just like the openness of D&D,

[20:18] the game's story changes based on your choices.

[20:21] We have a map on the play field.

[20:23] You'll be able to travel about our map all you want.

[20:25] You can play different dungeons and wizard modes.

[20:28] You can also buy things from FISMO, our in-game shopkeeper.

[20:32] He has different things to sell at different locations on the map.

[20:35] So you've got to remember where the big ticket items are.

[20:38] Our game has a story, the tyrant's eye.

[20:41] Our writer, Zach Proceny, spent months writing a story.

[20:44] And then we took that story and we turned it into all of the money

[20:47] and turned it into all of the modes of the game.

[20:49] It all begins with Tiamat hatching a new plan to escape her banishment.

[20:53] You can't have a D&D game without a fierce dragon, right?

[20:56] And we have the most amazing one ever in a pinball machine.

[20:59] The red dragon, wrath, the relentless.

[21:02] I see you running away.

[21:04] On the premium and LE, not only does the dragon's head move

[21:07] in multiple directions, which allows him to avoid getting hit

[21:11] or the block play field shots,

[21:13] he can also shoot flaming pinballs out of his mouth.

[21:16] Okay, well, maybe not actual flames, but it's going to feel like that in a battle.

[21:21] Face my wrath.

[21:23] You and your party are, of course, trying steel rascals

[21:26] by hitting the three-bank under him and then trying to hit his head to defeat him.

[21:31] That's my treasure.

[21:33] Wrath is really brought to life by the incredible voice talent of Michael Dore.

[21:37] I will consume you.

[21:39] Making him one of the most iconic pinball villains of all time.

[21:43] You dare challenge me?

[21:46] There are also multiple overlapping and cascading ramps,

[21:50] so it feels like you're going on a journey.

[21:52] Hit the road to town, right ramp to travel,

[21:55] or take the shortcut loop to the upper flipper.

[21:58] The game features an up-down ramp that leads to a gelatinous cube

[22:01] that, just like the monster in D&D, will grab the ball

[22:04] with an electromagnet and freeze it inside the cube.

[22:07] You are stuck.

[22:08] The player must then come to the rescue by hitting it out in time before it's devoured.

[22:12] We have a dungeon crawl feature that lets you travel through a dungeon

[22:15] looking for the award room.

[22:17] A dungeon crawl is unique because it's part physical shots and part video

[22:21] where the player makes choices on which direction to go at his junction.

[22:24] It could lead to an amazing treasure room, attacking monsters or even a dragon.

[22:29] Don't go in there!

[22:30] The game is procedurally generated,

[22:32] meaning all the randomness in the game is predetermined and changes every Sunday.

[22:37] You'll have one week to learn and explore the game.

[22:40] You'll learn where the dungeon crawl leads you.

[22:43] You'll learn where Fismo is selling different items on the map.

[22:46] Then, on Sunday, you'll have a whole new gaming experience.

[22:49] It will start all over.

[22:50] Every single day.

[22:51] There are many other elements that pull you into the fantasy world.

[22:54] There are little details everywhere on the play field.

[22:56] During your travels, you could be attacked by monsters.

[22:59] And I will bet!

[23:00] Or you can shoot the critical hit, cap the ball.

[23:03] Or find a hidden temple shot behind the upper flipper for double scoring.

[23:08] On the pro edition, players will experience a lot of the same action and flow in the immersive world of dungeons and dragons.

[23:22] Through the power of Insider Connected, we're integrating our new pin-save system.

[23:27] With each new game, you will pick up where you left off.

[23:30] You will start on the map where you end at your last game.

[23:33] Even in the middle of a dungeon, you can decide not to have your play save.

[23:37] You can play from the beginning every single game if you want to.

[23:40] It's all up to you.

[23:41] Let's finish this!

[23:42] We are beyond excited for you to experience the fantasy world under glass,

[23:46] using pinball with the iconic franchise like never before.

[23:50] Make your choice.

[23:51] Get ready to roll with the new dungeons and dragons, the Tyron Science, SternPinball.com.

[23:56] Alright, sharing.

[24:03] Okay, so we all saw that, right?

[24:10] Wait.

[24:13] Wait, what happened?

[24:18] Did you guys see stuff?

[24:21] Oh, no, it was black screen.

[24:28] I see I couldn't see any chat.

[24:33] I've been black the entire time.

[24:35] Oh, that sucks.

[24:38] Alright, well, I'm sorry, guys.

[24:39] I don't know why it was black.

[24:40] Okay, I should have gone back.

[24:44] Alright, alright.

[24:45] Well, I watched it.

[24:47] Sorry, guys.

[24:48] You all get your $5 back.

[24:52] Shoot.

[24:53] I should have came back.

[24:54] Alright, so here's the deal.

[24:55] Here's the deal.

[24:56] Go watch the video.

[24:57] Go watch the video.

[24:58] I don't know why I was black screen.

[25:01] The other thing worked, right?

[25:02] Did the other thing work, the trailer?

[25:04] Alright, so.

[25:07] Is streaming privacy?

[25:08] No, I just think it's something with this thing.

[25:10] I don't know.

[25:11] Alright, let's talk about it.

[25:12] Let's talk.

[25:13] We guys have all seen it, right?

[25:14] Alright, you're all everyone come back.

[25:16] Come back.

[25:17] It's alright.

[25:18] My black screen did not.

[25:19] Did not prevent you from seeing the whole video.

[25:22] The trailer worked.

[25:23] Alright, so sorry about that, gang.

[25:25] So you had a six minute black screen.

[25:27] Alright, Kadeh fails once again in his YouTube endeavor.

[25:29] This is why this is why I don't even.

[25:31] I rather just do Facebook.

[25:32] Anyway.

[25:33] Alright, so here's the thing.

[25:34] Here's the thing.

[25:35] I just saw the whole thing.

[25:36] And.

[25:37] I think like.

[25:38] I think I'm going to have to do this.

[25:39] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:40] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:41] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:42] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:43] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:44] I'm going to have to do this.

[25:45] I think like.

[25:47] If.

[25:49] Let me let me be candid.

[25:51] I really do like.

[25:53] The mechanical stuff in the game.

[25:55] I think it's great.

[25:57] I do think the.

[26:00] The like.

[26:02] Like the complexity of how to play it.

[26:06] The complexity of how to play it.

[26:08] Is going to be something that feels very unpimble like for a lot of people.

[26:14] Um, and I just don't know if anyone really cares.

[26:17] I, I, I got to be honest.

[26:20] Like I just don't know.

[26:22] If this kind of choose your own adventure.

[26:27] Save your character.

[26:29] You know, continue where you left off in the dungeon.

[26:34] Is like really something that you want to drop.

[26:39] This much money on.

[26:41] So.

[26:43] I don't know once.

[26:45] Once.

[26:46] Once.

[26:47] Dwight started talking, right?

[26:48] You get you start to get real nervous.

[26:50] I'm sorry about the black screen guys.

[26:52] I know that you guys went to go watch it somewhere else.

[26:54] I'm sorry.

[26:55] Welcome back.

[26:56] Um, for some reason.

[26:57] I don't know why I didn't share that one, but it shared the other one.

[27:00] So here's the thing.

[27:02] I think the FOMO on this game.

[27:05] Is going to flame out faster than a dragon fires a pinball.

[27:10] And I don't really think the early artwork.

[27:12] I don't like the early artwork to be honest.

[27:14] That side image of it.

[27:16] If it looks like the, it looked for some reason.

[27:20] It looks like the, it looks like the character from monster zinc.

[27:25] So I, uh, you don't look, I, I think a lot of us.

[27:32] Are going to jump on this game.

[27:34] Have a good time on location with it.

[27:36] Um, just not.

[27:39] I don't have any emotional connection to this theme at all.

[27:45] It, it's like, I think here's a thing.

[27:48] It's like, and this is, this is what my worry was about Dungeons and Dragons.

[27:51] It's like, it's like.

[27:53] I don't love Dungeons and Dragons.

[27:55] So when they put something into Dungeons and Dragons.

[27:59] I don't know what they're doing.

[28:01] So when they put something into Dungeons and Dragons.

[28:05] I don't feel like I'm getting what I want it.

[28:11] I don't feel like there was anything missing.

[28:15] I just feel nothing.

[28:18] I feel like, all right, a little numb.

[28:23] Right?

[28:24] The dragon is definitely a cool mech from Stern Pimble.

[28:28] Definitely a cool mech.

[28:30] I think standing over this game is going to, you know, make a smile and, and have some fun flipping it.

[28:36] But, you know, I just worry about the whole.

[28:42] Choose your character.

[28:45] Go into the dungeon and get into these like random video modes.

[28:50] And then every Sunday the game like resets or changes and gives you new.

[28:57] And then every Sunday it's like a way to explore it.

[29:00] It feels like a.

[29:03] Like a one player experience, you know, it just feels like something.

[29:08] If you owned it.

[29:10] You'd have to really want to do that.

[29:13] Every Sunday.

[29:16] I again.

[29:17] Now, I, I just think in an hour from now.

[29:21] Are any of you ordering an Ellie of this game?

[29:25] That's modern Stern now.

[29:27] It's like, when you hit it out of the park.

[29:31] You know, it makes you I don't I don't know why you would order an Ellie though.

[29:35] I just don't.

[29:37] I don't.

[29:39] I don't.

[29:41] I just, I don't, I just.

[29:43] Let me try and pull up the images of the games because I think.

[29:48] I think that'll help.

[29:50] I like that it's a three flipper game.

[29:53] I think that.

[29:56] Let's view a game.

[29:59] Let's see.

[30:06] I'm trying to I don't want to black screen again.

[30:09] I want you to I want us to be able to see it.

[30:13] Hold on.

[30:15] That's weird.

[30:16] It's weird because like the.

[30:19] I like that.

[30:22] You know, I like that.

[30:25] I like that.

[30:27] Like rendered.

[30:29] Like that's so strange to me.

[30:33] Where you guys are aware of like a gelatinous cube and everything.

[30:38] I just think this looks.

[30:40] I mean, let me, let me stop here.

[30:43] Let me know if you guys can see the screen.

[30:46] It's not black, right?

[30:48] You can see the screen.

[30:53] I just, I'm looking at this translate.

[30:57] I'm like, this is just really bad.

[31:00] I don't even know like what.

[31:02] What's like.

[31:04] Like what's happening here?

[31:06] Like what's with the green?

[31:07] I don't.

[31:08] Does that like light up differently?

[31:11] I don't know.

[31:12] The art on the game.

[31:14] Let me go to the side art to see if I can.

[31:26] 740.

[31:27] Hold on.

[31:28] I don't know if the screen.

[31:30] Okay.

[31:31] Okay.

[31:32] Like I like I just see here's the thing.

[31:37] Here's the thing is like.

[31:42] I think Stern Stern's whole model.

[31:45] You guys know this like Stern's whole model requires them to have a

[31:52] an Ellie everybody wants because if they don't get FOMO around the

[31:58] Ellie, then distras and dealers don't need to like order their bulk order

[32:04] because you know, if I'm if this thing is going to be worth $10,000

[32:09] and just a month or two.

[32:12] I'm just I'm telling you right now this $13,000 Ellie is just not

[32:19] going to be a game that holds better value than James Bond or

[32:26] food fighters.

[32:27] I don't even I just don't like the Ellie art.

[32:30] I like it should have a huge dragon on both sides.

[32:36] Not this monster's ink dude that nobody is aware of like I don't

[32:41] understand like it's okay.

[32:43] I guess that's the tyrants eye.

[32:46] So this and so this is what makes me nervous is that Dwight and

[32:51] someone else at Stern Pimball they wrote the story for this game.

[32:56] This was not penned by you know the D&D masters at Wizards of the

[33:02] Coast and so I think Stern Pimball created this character.

[33:07] I could be wrong this might be a character within the D&D world but

[33:12] this Tyrant Eye Guy is featured predominantly on the game's cabinet on the

[33:22] Ellie trim of the cabinet.

[33:24] So okay I don't know so this is a D&D character.

[33:29] I don't know it's Mikey.

[33:32] Yeah it's Mikey the Tyrant.

[33:34] I mean come on guy like this just doesn't look good.

[33:39] That's a beholder beast.

[33:42] Okay so you D&D nerds out there.

[33:45] So you D&D nerds out there that are correcting me.

[33:50] Does this excite you?

[33:51] I'm looking at you guys in the check because I have no idea what the heck

[33:54] this thing is.

[33:55] Again no idea.

[33:59] I don't know D&D characters.

[34:02] The beholder is the second most well known D&D monster after you know the

[34:06] dragons by who?

[34:08] Do you guys know this?

[34:10] Alright fine I don't care like dudes like you can make fun of me all you want

[34:15] because I don't know who the D&D beholder is like cool.

[34:19] I never played D&D.

[34:21] I was busy playing Super Mario Street Fighter Neo geo I was busy

[34:26] riding BMX bikes riding you know Tony Hawk skateboards.

[34:29] I'd never sat down and was like looking at the beholder.

[34:34] So okay cool.

[34:35] My bad.

[34:36] My bad.

[34:37] Don't attack the messenger.

[34:38] You guys got your beholder Ellie.

[34:40] Now that being said I still think it looks like crap.

[34:44] I still think the Ellie cabinet doesn't look great.

[34:47] I just don't.

[34:49] Okay.

[34:50] I'm allowed to have my opinion.

[34:53] So you know the black coin door like I again gang.

[34:58] I don't know what to tell you man like this is look like a $13,000 like this

[35:03] sides way better.

[35:06] I mean the the images they have on their website are not the best.

[35:11] The dragon side is obviously better.

[35:14] You know it's throwing me off.

[35:16] These are rendered which is annoying like this is a rendered shot of the

[35:21] mech.

[35:22] Like look out rendered and stylized that is this is throwing it looks it looks

[35:28] almost CGI like AI generated.

[35:31] Um.

[35:33] I don't know like like that's not rendered it looks rendered doesn't it.

[35:41] Doesn't that look rendered to you.

[35:45] That doesn't look right to me.

[35:47] I don't know.

[35:48] Maybe it's me.

[35:49] I don't know.

[35:51] It's the way they took the food.

[35:55] Okay.

[35:56] I'm getting the sense.

[36:00] How do you guys feel like I don't know.

[36:04] Josh are you ordering one.

[36:06] I get this sense that certain people.

[36:10] Like there's things I want to give Stern credit for here.

[36:13] But I still think it's a.

[36:16] A theme that most of you are not going to plunk down 10 to 13,000 dollars on.

[36:22] And that's that like and again like I think it's a game that.

[36:27] If you wait and see you'll be able to pick one up for thousands of dollars less.

[36:31] And I think once you start to see gameplay.

[36:35] And then.

[36:37] And realize that this is going to be even slower when it comes to like.

[36:42] More complex and deeper than normal pinball experiences.

[36:46] I just don't know if you're all going to be on board for like a venom 2.0 kind of thing.

[36:52] And then you've got Harry Potter and King Kong right around the corner.

[36:56] I don't gang I'm just going to let me just be candid here.

[36:58] Like I think there's some stuff in this game.

[37:01] I really like.

[37:02] I think that's what I think is like blowing me away at these prices.

[37:06] And I again I just don't like I don't think the theme.

[37:11] Is is gonna like make a lot of you go in on one right now.

[37:16] And that's it.

[37:18] I don't think it there's nothing I don't like about it.

[37:22] But there but this isn't anything I wanted.

[37:25] And I look at all of pinball right now as a very personal thing.

[37:31] I don't have any personal connection to dungeons and dragons.

[37:37] So and and Dwight did say they created their own story.

[37:41] So I just think give give yourself a few hours.

[37:47] I don't like I just think stern like.

[37:50] What's confusing to me now is is they've lost the day one frenzy like there's no I have no formal about this game.

[38:00] But like I'm I don't understand how anyone would be like I'm in on an L.

[38:04] Lee I don't even think the L.

[38:05] Lee looks good.

[38:06] I mean think about it for 13 grand they don't even match the color of the armor.

[38:12] With the color of the team holding on the back box for 13,000 dollars they don't even paint the coin door.

[38:21] For 13,000 dollars spooky pinball paints its coin doors.

[38:26] Spooky pinball gives you a topper spooky pinball gives you a lot for 10,000 dollars.

[38:31] I'm just I'm looking at it through the lens of for 13,000 dollars.

[38:38] This L. Lee is not going to move and because of that everything is connected to the L. Lee frenzy.

[38:47] And once the L. Lee doesn't have popularity the rest of the titles gang you're if you buy new in box on a game without a lot of demand.

[39:00] You're losing thousands of dollars now.

[39:05] That's the way I look at it.

[39:07] I like look let's talk about the game.

[39:10] I like the dragon.

[39:13] I like let's pull up the game.

[39:15] I want to pull up I wish they had just like a great shot of above the play field.

[39:20] They really don't I'm like looking to find.

[39:24] So we can talk about the actual like what's in it and it's it's a lot of close up shots.

[39:30] I'm looking for just a top down view of the game.

[39:36] And I'm really struggling here Stern marketing team where's just like the overhead view of the game.

[39:43] I'm struggling to find one.

[39:46] I'm going through all these are their photos I might have to go on their Facebook page.

[39:52] I think the third photo.

[39:57] Yeah, but it's not this is not the full.

[40:00] It's not the full.

[40:03] Let me go on their Facebook page.

[40:05] Let me see if Stern's Facebook has better images gang hold on one second.

[40:11] Yeah, there it is.

[40:12] There is a dragon.

[40:19] I mean, this is pretty much the game.

[40:21] I mean, there's not much in the.

[40:24] There's not much in the lower play field.

[40:26] It's all just the map.

[40:28] So let me let me see if this works.

[40:31] I don't go black screen sorry about the black screen guys.

[40:34] For please forgive me.

[40:36] Can you see the dragon here?

[40:45] Can you can you guys see the dragon?

[40:50] Nope, no, nothing.

[40:53] Black screens happen.

[40:55] Okay, black screen.

[40:56] I hold on.

[40:59] Let me try again.

[41:01] I think it's Facebook gang.

[41:03] Let me see.

[41:06] How about now?

[41:12] Can you see it now?

[41:17] Okay, all right.

[41:20] Okay.

[41:22] All right, so like looking at it.

[41:26] I mean, I'm not really a fan of it's kind of a fan layout, but not really a fan layout.

[41:32] We've got a upper right flipper.

[41:35] We've got a lot, you know, I like the, I like the cave that the dragon head is coming out of.

[41:43] That big luminous block, gelatin block that freezes the ball is kind of cool.

[41:51] I like the fire and ice sort of combination going on here.

[41:55] I like the, you know, I like that there's a lot of dynamic movement in this game.

[42:01] Obviously way better stuff in this game than John Wick way better stuff.

[42:06] Like I think it's like when you walk up to it and you're like D&D, D&D nerds out there.

[42:12] Correct me if I'm wrong.

[42:13] Do you guys know what this gelatinous brick is?

[42:16] Is that a thing in the D&D world?

[42:18] I'm a little surprised there was no die.

[42:21] Right. There was no spinning of a 20-sided die that you that's anywhere in this game.

[42:28] So I was a little shocked. I didn't see any of that.

[42:31] Yes, the gelatin gelatinous cube is quite well known.

[42:35] Okay, gang, here's the thing.

[42:37] If you love D&D, then you are in luck because they made the game for you.

[42:47] I think if you don't like D&D or don't care about D&D, I don't think you know this game is going to sort of like when you over the way a game like Iron Maiden won you over if you don't love Iron Maiden music.

[43:04] So that's that because again, like I don't think you're going to want to go on this like you know choose your own adventure, level up and save your character.

[43:15] Start where you left off pinball experience. I think for D&D fans.

[43:19] Yes, you're absolutely going to love doing that.

[43:26] Yeah, I just I think this is a D&D fans like dream come true.

[43:32] I think for everybody else out there, it's obviously it's a new pinball machine.

[43:37] It's going to peak our curiosity. We're going to enjoy playing it.

[43:41] But I don't I just.

[43:45] Again, I feel bad because of where Stern's price model is at.

[43:51] It's impossible to avoid the question is like do you see the value and buying one right now?

[43:57] Because remember, that's what it all comes down you gain.

[44:00] Like this company needs to sell new inbox now.

[44:04] And what you know knowing the market and knowing what's in this game.

[44:09] I like it's it's weird because to me all pinball is fun and when you like you have to somehow take fun out of the equation and think about like whether or not it's a good buy.

[44:22] If okay, it's a good question evil dead or D&D if you had to pick one.

[44:28] I will I will say this.

[44:32] I tried to choose between evil dead and dungeons and dragons.

[44:38] I probably would just stick with dungeons and dragons because again, like I just don't like evil dead movies.

[44:48] Like I think evil dead is a miss and I think D&D is much more like iconic and sort of works better for most people's desires.

[45:01] So I think evil dead.

[45:06] You know, look gang gang.

[45:08] Here's the thing you know spooky put out a newsletter and they you know they didn't even sell 700 yet evil deads and the reason why is because it's evil dead.

[45:23] Stern is going to sell more D&Ds in a you know in a week then spooky will sell of evil dead.

[45:29] I don't think they're going to sell a lot of this game though.

[45:32] I don't I don't think this game is going to be a barn burner.

[45:36] I don't think orders are going to are going to roll in for this game.

[45:41] I think here's here's my worry is I think when you see more of like how the code works and how the gameplay works.

[45:51] I actually think it's going to turn off more people than it turns on because I just don't think most of you want another like venom 2.0 save your adventure as you're going level up kind of pinball experience.

[46:06] I think you want something that hits a little bit more sort of instant and direct.

[46:12] So I don't know I don't know I get nervous when I hear Dwight starting to talk about the game.

[46:19] I can feel that he's done some.

[47:19] You
