[00:00] Nobody said it was easy, No one ever said it would be this hard, Oh take me back to the

[00:17] start.

[00:19] Ah, nobody said delivering pinball rumors was easy, but man, welcome to Canadian Pinball

[00:30] Podcast, the one pinball podcast that is getting everything wrong lately, I was wrong about

[00:36] Beetlejuice, I was wrong apparently about Harry Potter rumors, and I'm just gonna say

[00:41] this right now.

[00:43] The reason I've been wrong is I've listened to some sources that had me believe that what

[00:49] they were saying was 100% true, I'm gonna talk to you about how this Harry Potter thing

[00:55] developed, but also, you know, there's some truth in these last two rumors I got wrong.

[01:02] Spooky Pinball is coming out with Beetlejuice and Jersey Jack is coming out with Harry Potter.

[01:08] Now what we don't know is the order and exactly when those things are gonna happen, we don't

[01:13] know exactly who's on artwork, this and that, but I'm not 100% wrong, is Canada 30% right?

[01:21] Who knows?

[01:22] You know, Damien has been more successful getting people fathom machines than Canada

[01:27] has been getting these rumors right.

[01:31] And so let's talk about this for a minute, so we were all excited about Harry Potter,

[01:35] heck, I was excited about Harry Potter, and here's what happened, someone hit me up, and

[01:39] they're like, Chris, I know for a fact Harry Potter is next.

[01:43] The reason I know this is a major distributor is showing me photos real quickly of what

[01:49] Harry Potter Pinball is gonna look like, and of course, you know, me, I love a rumor, I

[01:53] love a good scoop, so my eyes light up, my ears open up, and I'm like, what do you got?

[01:58] And he starts describing the game, and it sounds amazing, and he's so excited, and he's

[02:02] so enthusiastic, and I can't wait to share that enthusiasm with each and every one of

[02:07] you, and of course, I would love to have inside information on this game.

[02:13] Everybody is waiting for, there's been no news in Pinball for so long, nobody cares about

[02:18] these John Wick contracts.

[02:21] The only hit we need to put out is on Seth Davis for destroying the prices of Stern

[02:26] Pinballs.

[02:27] I do not advocate violence against Seth Davis, that was simply a joke, if you're a Gen Z

[02:33] kid and you're offended by everything, please turn off the show, okay?

[02:37] Nobody cares about that, we're waiting for Spooky's next, that's not gonna happen until

[02:41] the fall, there's nothing going on anywhere in Pinball right now, it's just Elton John

[02:46] CEO owners trying to convince themselves that this game is gonna sell out, they will never

[02:51] sell out of 1000 Elton John's at $15,000 a pop, unless Iceman and Beezle Boob buy every

[02:58] single one, it's not gonna happen, okay?

[03:00] So I was so excited, Harry Potter, right?

[03:03] It's a humongous theme and knowing what was gonna be in the game and I was gonna deliver

[03:07] it to all of my club members and then all of you out there in the Pinball world and

[03:12] the guy was describing it in great detail and he's like, Chris, do me a favor, just

[03:17] wait a week, I don't want my source to know that I gave you this information right away,

[03:22] so I sat on it and then he started describing it and he was drawing pictures and no, I have

[03:28] to be 100% honest, I never saw that damn homebrew game, I must have missed it, I never

[03:35] saw the photos of it and I didn't have a photo of it, he didn't send me a photo of

[03:39] that homebrew game, he was just describing it and then here's what happened, as I was

[03:45] sort of teasing that I was gonna reveal details of Harry Potter, those photos of the homebrew

[03:51] game started being shared around again and then I was like, wait a minute, this sounds

[03:57] eerily similar to what the guy was saying was in the game and then they were everywhere

[04:03] and then for like a fraction of a second I thought I might have had, like the white

[04:07] wood of Harry Potter and everyone's like, Chris, you're an idiot, that's from a homebrew

[04:13] game that's been around for a few months, what are you doing and then I knew in an instant

[04:19] that my Harry Potter rumor and my information was absolute hogwash from Hogwarts, so now

[04:24] we're back to the start, all of us are back to the start, nobody knows, like Mark Sidon's

[04:29] game is probably next, what's Mark Sidon's game, is it Muppets, who knows, I'm at the

[04:35] point now where I don't even really know anymore what to expect from anyone anywhere in the

[04:39] pinball world except for a stern pinball because they're gonna do what they always do and when

[04:44] a game like John Wick doesn't sell, they're just gonna go back to the well and now we

[04:48] know that they're bringing this Godzilla black and white edition, which you heard here first

[04:52] on Canadian Pinball Podcast, they are bringing that to Comic Con, I give credit to Don's

[04:57] Pinball Podcast for telling us when they were going to unveil this game, I've been a little

[05:02] bit all over the place because you know, I thought that Metallica Ride the Lightning

[05:06] was gonna come out in July, here's the thing, Stern is going to release both of these games,

[05:11] they're gonna do both Godzilla 70th and Metallica 40th anniversary of Ride the Lightning, when

[05:17] they do which one, I don't know, I wouldn't be surprised because John Wick sales are so

[05:22] bad that Stern maybe launches two vault editions in the month of July to get them to the next

[05:30] cornerstone game sometime in like August, September because think about it, they need

[05:35] to make hundreds of games a week, they need to make a few thousand games a month and nobody's

[05:41] buying these John Wick's, right, I know they're doing a rerun of Black Knight, but man, oh

[05:47] man, oh man, they're not used to this and I feel bad for all the dealers and all the

[05:52] distros who had to place orders on these John Wick games because they're gonna be sitting

[05:57] on them forever and if you bought a John Wick LE for 13,000, trust me, you lost $5,000,

[06:04] it's gonna be worth eight grand within a year, everybody knows that, okay, so back to Jersey

[06:10] Jack, here we are, it's like almost July, I think it is July, it is July like first today

[06:16] and Elton John sales, whatever, they're still sitting at dealers, the part I don't get about

[06:21] Elton John, it is a great game, I've said it since I've played it, I love the game, I

[06:26] still worry about owning one and how deep the code is if you're not the biggest Elton

[06:31] John fan, I think the reason for owning this game are a few reasons, first it shoots so

[06:36] damn well, if you're a fan of Steve Ritchie, you're gonna love it, but I just worry about

[06:41] spending this much money on Elton, if you're not the biggest fan, I worry that the code

[06:47] is not that deep and after owning it for a few months, you might get bored of it if

[06:53] you're not a diehard Elton fan and most people, you know, I don't know, they might not get

[06:58] bored of this game, it is a really good game, I think out of all the games out there, I

[07:03] mean this, out of all the games out there, if you were to buy a game blind, just based

[07:08] on people's feedback of the game, based on people's experiences of the game, the game

[07:14] I would still get right now is Elton John, because I don't think anyone's wrong, like

[07:18] everyone's loving the game and the other game that I think is absolutely crushing it right

[07:23] now and the new code update seems amazing and I will say this, there's just times when

[07:29] you just realize why Stern is number one, Jaws Pinball is out and they just keep code

[07:35] updating this game and making it better and better and better and I'm very envious of

[07:42] what Stern Pinball does for its owners as a Jersey Jack Guns N' Roses owner, where it

[07:47] took them three and a half years to polish the code, Stern Pinball really does reward

[07:53] you with consistent and great code updates and not only that, because they have Insider

[07:59] connected, I'm super jealous of stuff like 4th of July mode for freaking Jaws, right?

[08:06] They can do stuff throughout the year that is connected to what's happening seasonally

[08:11] and that's really, really cool, like just think about all the possibilities of Stern

[08:17] being able to do that and drop like special Halloween code for a game or Christmas code

[08:24] or Thanksgiving or like Mother's Day and Father's Day, like they could do all this fun stuff

[08:29] with Insider connected and Jersey Jack doesn't even have any connectivity with its games

[08:35] other than Wi-Fi code downloads, but nothing else. They don't connect their owners, they

[08:40] don't have a leaderboard, they don't have special code that's time that thing's happening

[08:44] in the year and I think that's also really fun for Stern Pinball while it's still free.

[08:48] That's the thing, if Stern hooks everybody with Insider connected and then wants you

[08:54] to pay like a monthly subscription to get all of those things, I don't think that's

[08:59] gonna work, I think people will revolt. So here we are, Canada doesn't know what's next

[09:04] from Jersey Jack, let's talk about this Godzilla black and white edition coming to Comic Con

[09:11] on the end of July, that's like in three weeks people, so it's coming soon. How do we think

[09:16] they're gonna do the black and white? If we look at Elvira and Munsters, two games that

[09:21] got the black and white treatment, what they normally do is they focus in on a primary

[09:27] color and everything else is black and white. There was a little bit more color, I believe,

[09:32] on Munsters than there was on Elvira Blood Red Kiss edition, which I think is the best

[09:37] black and white version of any of the two versions that Stern came out with. Now you

[09:42] know me, I would love it all to be black and white. I just think when you make it all black

[09:47] and white, it's actually kind of crazy when you're walking into a lineup of games and

[09:53] every single thing on that game is black and white, the slings, the inserts, the artwork,

[09:59] the legs, everything, the topper, like make it all black and white, it almost looks so

[10:05] disruptive and crazy, like you're going from a color world to an old school black and white

[10:11] TV, I would love to see them do that. They're not gonna do it, they're not gonna do it,

[10:15] it's not gonna be that way. What they're probably gonna do is either make Godzilla green or

[10:22] just colorize his blue like gamma ray beam, I think that's what it's called, whatever

[10:27] his atomic breath is called, and I think they might do that. But I would really love Stern

[10:33] to sort of go a little bit beyond. And I'll explain why, because this is the number one

[10:38] game of all time. It is, like if you just look at the pin side top 100, it is number

[10:43] one, it is arguably the best game Stern has ever made. It just is, right? And so if they're

[10:50] gonna make, if they're gonna pay homage to the 70th anniversary of what is ranked as

[10:55] Stern's best pinball machine of all time, it sucks, right? It's like this was the one

[10:59] game where really deserved like some super limited edition black and white version of

[11:05] Godzilla. And because Stern stupidly made remakes of games that people didn't even really need

[11:11] more of in Elvira and in Jurassic Park, they took away their own ability to make the nicest

[11:18] Godzilla ever. But here's what I think is gonna happen. I still think this is gonna be the

[11:23] nicest Godzilla ever. And I think it's gonna piss off every single one of those 1000 Ellie

[11:30] owners. And I'll explain why, because whether or not this is limited, it doesn't matter.

[11:34] This is gonna be the most unique version of Godzilla because they've made so many Ellie's

[11:40] in premiums. Every single Ellie in premium has the same exact play field, the same color

[11:46] play field, even though the cabinets are different. When you're standing over in Ellie, and you're

[11:52] standing over a premium, you are both looking at exactly the same game. But this black and

[11:58] white version, it's new. It's fresh. Not everybody has it. You're going to be looking down at

[12:04] something special. And if you love Godzilla, I think you're going to want this one. I know

[12:09] Canada wants it. He just has no room. And as I look at Brenda right now clutching baby

[12:15] Cassian, I can also confirm for you, Canada also has no money left. It's all gone. It's

[12:21] all gone. It went into this house. It went into furniture. No, I'm just joking. But you

[12:25] know, super exciting week. I brought the demon back here. I've got everybody. All my babies

[12:30] are in one place at one time. And I would say maybe the most important baby next to

[12:35] my baby girl Brenda is the baby demon that is in the driveway. So we're about to see

[12:40] this Godzilla. We know that Stern is going to make it a premium. We know there's not

[12:44] going to be powder coated armor. But here's what I think they're going to do. I think they're

[12:48] going to make an accessory package where if you buy it, if you buy the accessory package,

[12:52] they're going to have the nicest version of Godzilla. And I think we're going to see

[12:56] a lot of Godzilla. Ellie's go up for sale. Now here's the game that's really going to

[13:00] be fire sold all the people that own Godzilla premiums. I mean, we always think about like

[13:05] it's the Ellie people that get screwed. But man, if you own a premium, your game just

[13:10] lost about 1000 to $2,000. And we know everybody knows this. If you want to buy all of these

[13:18] exciting new and box games that are about to come out, a lot of you are going to have

[13:22] to free up some room. And the only way to free up room is if you sell something and nobody

[13:28] wants to see their games lose value. All right, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[13:32] I heard people are having a hard time getting their alien toppers. Remember when this topper

[13:38] was revealed months ago and they took deposits on it? Nobody has one. Nobody knows where

[13:45] they're at and nobody can get a refund. Welcome to the world of modern pinball. Show something

[13:51] before it's ready. Show something before you have it manufactured. Get a bunch of bored

[13:56] white old men to buy it and then have them pound sand for months as they try to get their

[14:01] merchandise and newsflash. Ladies and gentlemen, you shouldn't buy anything until it's made

[14:08] in a box ready to go to you. I could go buy an Elton John collectors edition today in

[14:14] a box and open it up for a fourth of July party and have fun. That's how life should

[14:21] work. Stop throwing money at stuff that's not built. Stop trusting people you don't

[14:28] know. The only person you should trust who you might not know is canada's pinball podcast.

[14:34] And the thing you should trust me for is that nine out of 10 times my rumors are going to

[14:38] be right and seven out of 10 times they're going to be wrong. So go try to do that math

[14:43] and get back to me and ask yourselves, why do I pay this guy $5 a month for the most

[14:48] entertaining damn pinball podcast on the planet? Alright, so nobody's getting their

[14:53] alien toppers. Guess what? Nobody cares. Nobody cares about this game. If you bought this

[14:58] game, I don't know what to tell you, but if you have the game, congratulations. And if

[15:01] you put a deposit on the topper, I don't know what to tell you. Like why'd you do it?

[15:06] Like just wait. Like these weren't going to sell out. There's no such thing as a topper

[15:10] that's impossible to get unless it's all the stern toppers that are impossible to get.

[15:14] What is canada doing? He is contradicting himself on every sentence right now. Why do

[15:19] we listen to this guy? So speaking of refunds, we're going to hear today from Zach many about

[15:25] his official policy on what he's going to do for haggis deposit people who gave money

[15:31] towards centaur. Now, you know that canada and Zach have buried the hatchet, but I'm

[15:36] going to say this and I mean this when I say it. I don't blame Zach many. I blame Damian

[15:41] and I've said this from day one. Zach many is doing his job. He's trying to help Damian

[15:46] sell some games. They took deposits on these things almost a year ago. It was July of 2023.

[15:54] And so at this point, right? It's like there was a promise of refunds if haggis goes under.

[16:00] But what exactly does that even mean? Right? Companies like Dutch Pimball survived for

[16:05] a decade without going under. And I know right now the latest is this like Damian's trying

[16:11] to like scratch build these games with like two to three people. I heard he's actually

[16:16] using Marty's shoes to hammer in all the posts. And this is crazy. Like Marty's shoes that

[16:22] we're hiding in the corner. Damian is actually using them to hammer in the posts on every

[16:28] fathom game. And that's why it's taking so long because Marty's shoes are not as effective

[16:33] as a hammer. Look, everybody knows this. This company is done. Zach really never even should

[16:38] have said he's going to give refunds because at the very beginning of deposits, everybody

[16:44] knew the risk. And if you gave money on Centaur, you did it knowing all too well, the fathom

[16:52] debacle that was happening. So for those people who gave a deposit, yes, you knew what the

[16:58] risk were going to be. Now what I think is going to happen is this. I think Zach is going

[17:02] to map out a timeline where if stuff doesn't happen by a certain date, you can roll over

[17:07] your money into some other deposit or credit for a future flipping out purchase. And I

[17:14] think that's going to be the best win-win scenario for everybody. I think when that

[17:18] does happen, I think Zach is not going to want to work with Damian again. I don't think

[17:24] anybody really wants to work with Damian again. I don't want to listen to Marty Robbins ever

[17:29] again, you know, turning on his podcast and he's all laughter with Jeff T. O. List. Like

[17:34] the guy took money from people. They both openly lied to everybody in the community.

[17:39] When you tell people you're going to have something in eight weeks and it takes eight

[17:43] months, you lied to them. And not only that, and then they lied to everybody again by saying

[17:49] we were going to finish all these games by the end of the year. We were going to have

[17:52] Centaur's in January. All of it is a lie. And the fact that you could lie to the community

[17:58] and then you turn on a podcast mic and you laugh and you joke about everything and you

[18:02] don't even address the very company you're a part of. You're a joke. You're an utter

[18:07] joke. And I will say this to your face, Marty, Damian, just call it quits. It's over, everybody.

[18:15] It's over. All right, Brenda needs to turn on the baby Brescia. Is that what we need

[18:18] to do? All right, everybody, this is going to be a first on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[18:22] You're going to hear in the background, baby Cassians formula getting made. You know, my

[18:26] little boy, when I teach him to grow up, Cassian, when you get older, do me one favor. Don't

[18:32] go into pinball manufacturing. Don't take deposits. Don't lie to people. Then don't disappear

[18:38] like a coward like Damian. It's over, everybody. Marty shoes and Damian should be retired in

[18:46] the pinball hall of fame. All right, everybody, look, a lot's going to happen in the next

[18:51] few months of pinball. Right now, I encourage, I encourage each and every one of you just

[18:57] enjoy your July 4th, like long weekend. Don't play too much pinball, have more barbecue

[19:03] and beer, and we'll be back this week with more episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[19:08] the one guy who even when he's wrong, he just makes it sound so right later.
