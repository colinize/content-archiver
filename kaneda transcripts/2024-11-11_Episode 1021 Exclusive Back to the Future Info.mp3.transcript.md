[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] I'm still searching for my voice, my throat still hurts.

[00:26] Why can't we all still be friends?

[00:29] We're all here because we're united about pinball.

[00:32] Yes, it was interesting having a little bit of a broader discussion about what's been

[00:37] happening in the world, but I just want to say this.

[00:40] No matter what happens in this world, we're never going to turn this pinball podcast into

[00:46] anything other than that.

[00:48] And I'm just going to say this for the record.

[00:50] If I'm friends with you, I am not going to stop being your friend because you voted in

[00:56] a different way than me.

[00:58] I'm not going to stop being your friend because you think differently than me.

[01:02] What happened to the world in which friends actually talked to each other and understood

[01:08] why you feel the way you feel?

[01:11] If Kamala Harris had won the election, I would not have threatened any of my friends that

[01:15] we are no longer friends.

[01:17] And that is what I received and it's a little bit disappointing.

[01:20] And I just want to say we're no longer going to talk about this topic.

[01:23] I respect each and every one of you and I'm open to a discussion and a dialogue with each

[01:29] and every one of you.

[01:30] I think that is a healthy way to live.

[01:32] And I think the unhealthy way to live in life is spending $6,000 to $15,000 on pinball

[01:38] machines.

[01:39] People think about it for a minute.

[01:40] How can we even with a straight face discuss the major issues affecting working class Americans

[01:48] as we spend $6,000 to $15,000 on pinball machines?

[01:54] We are all the biggest hypocrites in the world.

[01:58] If more people knew about how we spend our money, we would be public enemy number one.

[02:06] So let's just all align on that simple fact.

[02:09] We are all in a very, very privileged position.

[02:13] I mean it's incredible how much money you have to spend on a pinball machine when most

[02:19] people are suffering to buy the basics.

[02:21] We are not basic and that is why I love this hobby because it's introduced me to so many

[02:27] interesting people and so many amazing hypocrites.

[02:32] Let's do this.

[02:33] Let's go around the pinball horn.

[02:35] So right now we're heading into mid-November.

[02:37] We're getting into that end of the year crunch period.

[02:41] What's been going on in pinball?

[02:43] Let's go around and talk about each company, what they have coming out and I've got some

[02:47] exclusive news for you on Back to the Future that you do not know.

[02:53] I have not signed any NDA around this game.

[02:57] It's going to be an interesting thing I tell you.

[03:00] I think when you hear what I'm about to tell you that nobody else knows, I think it's going

[03:05] to put a little bit of pressure to move this game in the right direction.

[03:09] But nothing's a done deal right now.

[03:10] I just want to say that and we'll get into it later.

[03:12] I'm going to end this show with the big Back to the Future news for each and every one of you.

[03:16] So let's start out with a Facebook post.

[03:19] We'll just stay on Dutch for a little bit.

[03:21] I did get a Facebook post from CoinTaker saying that the end of the Big Lebowski is coming

[03:28] as this company gets ready to make Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[03:32] That's good news.

[03:33] It's been about 11 years of making the Big Lebowski.

[03:37] The thing about Big Lebowski and the final run of this game, I still don't know how many

[03:42] they've made.

[03:43] There still has not been a sort of number of games that they've made.

[03:47] I'm not sure if they're going to communicate.

[03:50] The final game will be game number this.

[03:53] And it's interesting because this game has always been somewhat limited, but they've

[03:57] been making them now for a few years.

[03:59] They've been sort of using this increased price of the game to make the older EA's whole.

[04:05] That has happened.

[04:06] The game used to be $8,500.

[04:09] Everybody.

[04:10] Now it's $13,500.

[04:12] Think about that for a minute.

[04:14] I think what that means is the bomb on the game is probably somewhere around $5,000 or

[04:18] $6,000.

[04:19] But basically we saw a $5,000 price increase on the Big Lebowski.

[04:25] I think one of the reasons people absorb that price increase is there's a lot in this game.

[04:30] It's got a lot in this game.

[04:32] You talk about theme integration.

[04:34] You talk about assets.

[04:36] You talk about upper play field.

[04:38] That's awesome.

[04:39] Lower play field.

[04:40] That's awesome.

[04:41] A rug that rolls out.

[04:42] It's got a lot of fun stuff in this game.

[04:45] And it's also not too hard.

[04:47] I think a lot of modern pinball machines.

[04:49] A lot of modern pinball machines are way too hard.

[04:52] And Dutch Pinball's Big Lebowski, it's just the right amount of challenge, I think for

[04:57] a lot of you out there.

[04:58] Let's face it.

[04:59] Some of you guys out there look, it's too easy.

[05:01] It's not deep enough.

[05:02] You're not playing the Big Lebowski and seeing the end of the game every time you play the

[05:07] game.

[05:08] You probably maybe get to the aim once a month if you're good.

[05:12] $13,500 and we're seeing a little bit of a last call on Lebowski.

[05:17] The only issue is if you go on the pinside marketplace, you can now go get a Big Lebowski

[05:24] for around 11 or 12.

[05:26] So they're out there on the used market for less money.

[05:30] Also, it's November now.

[05:33] When is the last Lebowski going to be made?

[05:36] When is the actual line going to turn over to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland?

[05:41] I'm already starting to get a little bit nervous because I'm starting to hear stuff like, Alice

[05:48] is going to go on the line in early 2025 and Q1 2025.

[05:54] That is not what I want to hear.

[05:56] We were told that Alice was going to be on the line in January.

[06:01] For some reason, the pinball world always does this.

[06:05] They give you a date, like a specific month.

[06:09] We're going to make this game in January.

[06:11] Awesome.

[06:12] I'm going to give you my money now and I expect the first games to go out the door in January.

[06:17] Then it turns into Q1 and then it turns into like production is beginning, but no games

[06:23] are going out the door.

[06:25] The only thing I'm nervous about with this Alice and the start of production is that

[06:29] Dutch pinball in its 11-year history has no history or experience turning a line over.

[06:38] I don't think it's going to go as smoothly as everybody thinks.

[06:44] They've had a few months, but there's a lot of specialized parts with Alice.

[06:48] I hope those parts have been ordered.

[06:50] I hope they're coming in.

[06:52] I hope this game does start to go out the door in January.

[06:56] Now, look, as I said, we're going to keep this company honest and come January.

[07:01] If nobody is unboxing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, we are already starting out

[07:07] on a bad note.

[07:09] Let's see what happens.

[07:11] All right.

[07:12] Speaking of games coming out soon, we've got spooky pinball and it is going to be Evil

[07:18] Dead, Christopher Franchi on artwork.

[07:21] I think we're going to see it in like a month.

[07:24] That's exciting.

[07:25] We are going to see this game in like four weeks.

[07:28] Usually, it's mid-December when spooky pinball gets their new game out into the world.

[07:34] It's right before Christmas.

[07:36] Spooky's found this December window.

[07:39] That's really nice for them because there's no competition.

[07:42] We look forward to seeing that game now before spooky pinball is Evil Dead.

[07:48] We may see a new game this week.

[07:50] Did you guys realize this?

[07:52] I know most of you are not waiting for this game, but we know that American Pinball is

[07:57] going to be at IOPPA.

[08:00] I think they've said something along the lines of, come see the new stuff happening at American

[08:05] Pinball at IOPPA.

[08:08] That is the end of this week.

[08:10] Will IOPPA be the moment in which American Pinball reveals to the world its next title?

[08:17] The rumor, because I haven't seen it, but the strong rumor on this game is it's going

[08:21] to be Cuphead.

[08:23] We know they didn't want to release the game at Expo to avoid the crowd is what they said.

[08:29] Maybe that was a good idea because at Expo, let's be honest, there was Metallica, there

[08:34] was Alice, and there was X-Men, and there was Avatar.

[08:39] There were a lot of games.

[08:41] If they released Cuphead amidst those four games, I think it would have been Dead on

[08:47] Arrival.

[08:48] Now, for some of you out there, this game is Dead on Arrival anyway because of the theme.

[08:53] But look, let's all keep an open mind.

[08:55] I don't love this theme, but let's face it.

[08:59] Did Avatar win us over?

[09:00] No.

[09:01] Are people super satisfied with X-Men?

[09:04] Not really, right?

[09:05] The code, the quality issues.

[09:08] Metallica's sold out, the LVs, and the premium you can get forever.

[09:12] They're going to make as many premiums as you want for the rest of time, so we've kind

[09:16] of moved on from Metallica.

[09:18] 500 people are really happy.

[09:20] Everybody else is either upset or getting a premium.

[09:23] And Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is not even going to be made for a few months.

[09:27] And so really, when you think about it, if American Pinball has Cuphead on the line this

[09:33] week, if they reveal this game and it's being made now.

[09:38] There's a window.

[09:39] There is a window.

[09:40] My fear is it's not on the line.

[09:43] It should be on the line.

[09:44] I mean, I don't know anyone who's been ordering Barbecue or their old games.

[09:48] They've retired their older titles.

[09:51] That's just inventory they've had sitting around.

[09:54] And so American Pinball, their strategy, has kind of worked out in their favor.

[10:00] So what does Cuphead need to be successful?

[10:02] Well, it needs to be an amazing game.

[10:05] It needs to have a lot of amazing stuff in it.

[10:07] I've seen people overcome themes they were not happy with because the game was so much

[10:14] fun, because the game was amazing.

[10:17] Games like Iron Maiden did it for people.

[10:19] A lot of people aren't the biggest Iron Maiden fans.

[10:22] I think Foo Fighters did it for a lot of people.

[10:26] So we shall see.

[10:27] I don't even know if the game is coming out this week.

[10:29] We haven't seen any teasers, no nothing.

[10:31] So it might not come out this week, but it's not a bad window if you're American Pinball.

[10:37] So we're going to go from that this week.

[10:39] If it happens, we're going to have a lot to talk about this week.

[10:42] If it doesn't, we're not going to have too much to talk about this week.

[10:46] And then we're going to head towards Spooky's Game.

[10:49] And then also in December, gang, I really think we might see Dungeons and Dragons.

[10:53] If you think about the fact that X-Men came out in early September, it was like September

[10:58] 6th.

[10:59] We are coming up on that four month period where Stern's next Cornerstone game should

[11:06] be coming out.

[11:07] Now I don't think it's going to be December.

[11:09] I think it's going to be January.

[11:11] I think they're going to want to get some Metallica's on the line.

[11:15] But it's coming, right?

[11:16] Stern does not stop.

[11:17] The Stern boulder keeps moving downhill and just flattening our wallets with new game

[11:25] after new game after new game.

[11:27] I think a lot of people are skeptical about Dungeons and Dragons.

[11:32] I think a lot of people have high hopes for Spike 3.

[11:36] I think when you think about Spike 3, I think it really needs to have more than just a big

[11:42] screen and a little bit better sound and lighting.

[11:46] I think overall, I want Stern games to have a little bit more fit and finish the way a

[11:52] Jersey Jack game is.

[11:54] Like a Jersey Jack game, when you put it next to a Stern, put a $12,000 avatar next to a

[12:01] $13,000 X-Man and it's really still night and day in terms of the material quality.

[12:09] I get it that the Stern might be more fun.

[12:12] It might flip better.

[12:14] But the physical material quality, it's like a hundred pounds more.

[12:19] Like the game weighs a hundred pounds more and I'm sorry, but it just feels more solid.

[12:24] I mean, some of you might argue that's a bad thing when you move games up and down stairs

[12:28] like I did and you don't need something so heavy.

[12:31] It is harder to nudge a Jersey Jack machine.

[12:34] I've noticed this.

[12:35] Like I've been playing GNR a lot and nudging that machine is not easy, especially because

[12:40] I have the rubber stoppers for the hardwood floor.

[12:44] And it does make playing GNR a little frustrating for me at times because I don't know how often

[12:49] you've played one.

[12:50] But I do find that whenever the balls go into the sling area, it just fires them into the

[12:56] out lanes like 40% of the time and it just makes it a little frustrating.

[13:01] I'm going to be honest.

[13:02] I cheated this weekend.

[13:03] I put the game on five ball just because I wanted to see more of the game.

[13:08] I didn't want to lower the post so I just put it on five ball and even then I'm just noticing

[13:12] a lot of out lane drains.

[13:15] So we've got maybe Dungeons and Dragons coming out.

[13:18] Is Stern going to continue to improve the X-Man code?

[13:22] We talked about this on the Saturday morning show.

[13:25] I think what's happening with X-Men is that right now the only wow happening in the game

[13:32] is the physical design.

[13:34] The software hasn't wowed people over.

[13:37] The music hasn't wowed people over.

[13:40] What the game is suffering from right now, and this is a little bit sad to me, what it's

[13:45] suffering from right now, same thing as Avatar.

[13:48] Both of these games are beautiful.

[13:50] Both of them have unique layouts, but both of them do not have a single wow moment that

[13:57] when you play the machine, something absolutely wow is happening.

[14:02] Now it's a lot easier for X-Men to get there.

[14:05] I'll explain why.

[14:06] Because X-Men has a lot more interesting stuff physically happening in the game with the

[14:11] Sentinel, with the Magneto magnets, with the lower danger room play field.

[14:17] There's just a lot more ability to code in moments of wow from X-Men, and I hope it gets

[14:24] there, but right now it's not there.

[14:27] It's a lot harder to code in those moments of wow into Avatar because there's not that

[14:32] much physically on the game itself.

[14:35] That's interesting.

[14:37] And also we know that Avatar code is pretty much code complete.

[14:41] It's at like 0.9 something, like Kiefer's not going to add too much more to this game,

[14:47] and Jersey Jack historically, when they ship a game, it's kind of code complete.

[14:52] They don't really do much.

[14:54] I mean people have waited six years to get the final wizard mode in freaking pirate to

[14:58] the Caribbean, and did you see it?

[15:00] I went and watched someone who showed us the final pirates wizard mode, and it's the most

[15:06] underwhelming thing I think I've ever seen.

[15:09] I mean you waited six years for that?

[15:11] There's like nothing happening on the screen?

[15:14] There's like not much coded into the game?

[15:16] It really was not worth it.

[15:18] I wish they would have gone further and did more.

[15:21] I mean a final wizard mode, like a final thing you get to should be the most amazing thing

[15:28] in the game.

[15:29] It should be like there and back again in Lord of the Rings, and something about like

[15:33] the final mode and Toy Story is also really lame.

[15:37] It's like they run out of steam when they get to the finale of the game.

[15:42] I mean the finale should be so damn awesome that you can't wait to get back to it again,

[15:47] especially because it takes you so long to get there.

[15:50] Alright so we'll see if we get Dungeons and Dragons, Jersey Jack, Avatar Sales, you know

[15:56] look it's mid-November, and nobody knows when a collector's edition is going to go on the

[16:03] line.

[16:04] But you guys notice this that Jersey Jack on Facebook has turned on a lot of sponsored

[16:11] posts trying to sell Toy Story, trying to sell Elton John, trying to sell Godfather.

[16:19] I mean they clearly have a lot of inventory on those three games.

[16:26] Avatar is going to be in the same boat.

[16:28] It's not selling people.

[16:30] It's not.

[16:31] You're ordering a $12,000 Avatar like nobody right now, and if you're a CE buyer and you

[16:39] were told your game was going to be made in November, where's your game?

[16:43] When is it going on the line?

[16:45] Did they fix the playfield ink issues?

[16:48] You don't know.

[16:50] And I don't like this.

[16:51] And just like X-Men, just like Avatar, you get one chance to make an amazing first impression

[16:57] in Pinball, and if you fumble it, we're on to the next.

[17:02] And I think everybody is kind of already on to the next.

[17:06] And when the next game is Harry Potter, it's hard to see a future in which Avatar ever

[17:12] gets embraced by the Pinball community, ever holds its value.

[17:17] The only thing I can see is that this game is not going to sell well.

[17:21] They're going to sell to some CE people who are just going to gush about how beautiful

[17:25] it is.

[17:26] But man, I don't think this game is ever going to turn around now.

[17:29] And you're going to be able to get a CE in six months if you want one for $10,000.

[17:36] Another game.

[17:37] This is another game, much like Godfather, much like Toy Story, where you're going to

[17:42] lose $5,000 on a CE.

[17:45] Elton John, you're going to lose about $3,000.

[17:48] It's a better game.

[17:49] It's a better game than Avatar.

[17:50] Elton John is the best Jersey Jack shooter to date.

[17:55] If I had money burning a hole in my pocket, I would try to find an Elton CE for $12,000.

[18:01] All right.

[18:02] So speaking of what's around the corner, let's go to CGC quickly.

[18:06] Everybody's waiting on these Pulp Fiction Lease.

[18:08] I don't think most people care.

[18:10] And then they're going to make more medieval madness games.

[18:13] And then it's going to be Mark Richie's Halo.

[18:16] The other thing we don't talk about as much anymore, but it's also happening.

[18:20] We don't talk about the fact that somewhere within medieval madness, somewhere within

[18:24] Halo, CGC is going to remake Twilight Zone.

[18:28] They are 100% going to remake Twilight Zone.

[18:31] The problem with CGC, if you take Pulp Fiction, Twilight Zone, Medieval Madness, and Halo,

[18:39] it feels like for them to even make four games, right?

[18:42] With different lines and different release dates, that's going to take them like eight

[18:47] years.

[18:48] It's like this company makes one game every two years.

[18:51] So there's absolutely zero enthusiasm.

[18:55] So I just think CGC as a brand has lost the enthusiasm of the community.

[19:01] They've lost my enthusiasm.

[19:03] I'm just over them because it's like everything comes out the day after you die.

[19:07] All right.

[19:08] What else is going on in Thinball?

[19:09] Princess Bride from P3 Multimorphic.

[19:12] Look, people have been telling me this game is a theme integration perfect game.

[19:18] I just want to see more games go out the door.

[19:21] Here we are.

[19:22] This game was revealed like 11 months ago or something.

[19:26] Where is it?

[19:27] Have you seen anybody unbox the full new version of the game with the swords on the side, the

[19:36] special version of this game that was like 13.5 or something?

[19:40] I haven't seen anybody unbox it.

[19:42] It's just really hard to follow some of these games.

[19:46] When you ask the question, why did you reveal this game 10 months ago?

[19:50] It just feels like these companies have no money, no plan, and are just hanging on.

[19:56] Like there's just too many companies executing right to deal with these like weird reveals

[20:01] like this.

[20:02] Turner, Thinball, Ninja Clips.

[20:04] Let's see when those go out.

[20:05] Chris sold 100.

[20:07] He's only got to make 100.

[20:08] All right.

[20:09] He's only got to make 100.

[20:10] And if he just makes a few a week, he's going to satiate those orders.

[20:14] Like I think anyone who bought into Ninja Clips, I hear people like, Canada, you got

[20:18] to be hard on Ninja Clips.

[20:20] And his association with Robert Mueller.

[20:22] And I'm like, oh, come on.

[20:23] I mean, the guy broke away from Deeproot, made his own game, sold it to people, and

[20:30] is going to make the games.

[20:31] And if he doesn't make the games, I'll be hard on him.

[20:34] But I'm not going to be hard on him now.

[20:36] And especially if you've met Chris Turner, he's the nicest person in Pinball.

[20:41] So I have nothing but nice things to say about Turner Pinball.

[20:45] And they're making a $6,000 game, guys.

[20:47] It's like $6,600 or it's like $64.99.

[20:52] So give the guy a break.

[20:53] He's not ripping anybody off.

[20:55] You know who's ripping you off?

[20:57] Jersey Jack, Stern Pinball.

[20:59] You guys are spending like $13,000, $15,000 for stickers on a game where they'll sell

[21:04] you the exact same game for like $4,000 less because they put a few stickers on the game.

[21:11] Talk about ripoffs.

[21:12] All right, am I missing anybody from the world of Pinball?

[21:15] I probably am.

[21:16] I'm not sure if I am.

[21:17] Barrels are fun.

[21:18] I think they have Goonies.

[21:20] I think they need to get this game out before TPF.

[21:24] Demand on Labyrinth is gone.

[21:26] It was a great first game to get out the door.

[21:29] What I want to see from Barrels on game two is a better theme.

[21:33] I also want to see their line moving more efficiently.

[21:38] I think they came out of the gate.

[21:39] They had like 10 games in a box and then production didn't really start then and they've been

[21:45] trickling these games out.

[21:47] But I want what's next.

[21:49] I'm not buying what was game number one.

[21:51] It wasn't a theme for me.

[21:53] So I just want these guys to do something that excites me and I want to get it sooner

[21:58] than later.

[21:59] All right, let's end this show right now with an exclusive bit of news on Back to the Future.

[22:04] So as you know, there's no way in a million years that Dutch Pinball can make Back to

[22:10] the Future considering how large the demand will be.

[22:14] But they were smart.

[22:15] They inked a deal to make this game with Universal.

[22:20] They've got Joe Kamnikau on board, Bob Gale on board.

[22:24] You know that Stern passed on the game with my interview with George Gomez.

[22:29] We know all of that.

[22:30] We also know Dutch Pinball has been talking to the likes of Stern, the likes of Jersey

[22:35] Jack Pinball.

[22:36] We know all of that because that was happening at Expo.

[22:40] People saw them walking into the buildings, people.

[22:43] And that's fine.

[22:44] It's a smart move to make.

[22:45] And I've personally been telling Barry, you got to get help here.

[22:49] If you try to do this all yourself, it's not going to work.

[22:53] I mean, the win-win scenario is to get a partner to help you manufacture it.

[22:58] So here's the part that you don't know.

[23:00] Both Jersey Jack and Stern are interested in this game.

[23:04] One of the hold-ups on a deal happening immediately is the licensing deal.

[23:10] You know, I don't know if Dutch Pinball had everything they thought they had with the deal

[23:15] for Back to the Future.

[23:17] And for Stern Pinball especially, they don't want to make a game and they don't want to

[23:22] enter into a partnership unless the deal is the right deal.

[23:27] They want to make sure they can get everything they need to make the game in the right way.

[23:34] Now the good news is nobody has better relationships with the company Universal than Stern Pinball.

[23:41] I know that exploration period is happening right now, but there's no deal, people.

[23:46] There's no deal between Dutch and any company.

[23:49] But here is a bit of information you don't know.

[23:52] And you know, when you hear this, you're really going to want Stern Pinball and Dutch Pinball

[23:57] to work it out.

[23:58] But this is something that's going to be challenging for Dutch.

[24:02] This is something that's going to be challenging for Barry.

[24:05] Because when you hear what I'm about to tell you, this is going to require some humbleness

[24:11] and some intelligence to collide.

[24:14] So one of the reasons why Stern Pinball wants to make Back to the Future is because somebody

[24:19] over there really wants to make it.

[24:23] And they have someone over there that if they got the license, they would figure out a way

[24:28] to shuffle some of his projects so that he could focus on making Back to the Future.

[24:34] The person who really wants to make Back to the Future over at Stern Pinball is Keith

[24:40] Elwyn.

[24:41] Keith Elwyn really wants to make this game.

[24:45] And all of a sudden you hear that.

[24:47] The greatest pinball designer of all time wants to make what would be one of the greatest

[24:54] themes of pinball of all time.

[24:56] And if he gets the assets to make this game, like the kind of assets we see in JAWS, and

[25:02] he brings his team on board, it's not just him, remember that.

[25:06] It's not just Keith Elwyn, it's the software team.

[25:09] It's everybody that rallies around a Keith Elwyn game.

[25:13] If I were to tell you Keith Elwyn and his team would love nothing more to make Back to

[25:19] the Future, you would be doing backflips.

[25:22] And that seems like a dream scenario for everybody.

[25:26] A dream scenario for Barry, a dream scenario for Stern, a dream scenario for you and me.

[25:33] Because if Barry inks a deal where he gets a royalty, and he should on every game sold,

[25:39] as he should because he inked this deal.

[25:42] And you let Keith Elwyn and Stern make the game?

[25:46] Are you kidding me?

[25:47] You'd sell 10,000 games easily.

[25:50] And you get to just sit back if you're Barry, and make your millions of dollars, and everybody

[25:56] wins.

[25:58] Now here's the challenging part.

[26:01] If you go down that road, then you're as Barry, you're not the personal designer of Back to

[26:07] the Future.

[26:09] You're not the rock star who made the game.

[26:12] You know, I've been saying a lot over the years, I love Barry's designs on the big Lebowski

[26:17] and he's one of the best pinball designers out there.

[26:20] And I can't wait to see what he does next.

[26:23] And I think some of that must be living on inside his head that he wants to show the

[26:28] world what he's capable of and what he can do next.

[26:32] But I'm just here to say this to Barry.

[26:35] I know he listens.

[26:36] Barry, I think you're great.

[26:38] You're not Keith Elwyn.

[26:40] I think Touch Pinball got themselves out of a bad situation.

[26:44] I'm really happy to see where this company is at.

[26:47] But you're not Stern's Elwyn team.

[26:50] You can't make the games like Stern can.

[26:53] You don't have the software team like they do.

[26:55] You don't have the genius that is Elwyn's unit.

[26:59] And so that is something that when you hear it, you can't unhear it.

[27:04] That back to the future if made by Stern has the possibility to be made by Keith Elwyn

[27:10] and his team.

[27:11] And it's like, guys, no brainer.

[27:13] Just get together.

[27:14] Make this happen.

[27:15] Make this happen.

[27:16] And if you think about it, the reason why I would never want this deal to happen over

[27:19] at Jersey Jack is we know Jersey Jack wouldn't do it right.

[27:24] We know they don't have a designer nearly as good as Keith Elwyn.

[27:27] They don't code their games in the right way.

[27:29] You'd have all these muted clips.

[27:31] And Jersey Jack, my indictment of you is simply based on everything you've been putting

[27:37] into the marketplace.

[27:38] I don't want you to have dream themes anymore because you don't do them right.

[27:43] You have muted clips.

[27:44] You have the wrong movie like you do just back to the future three like whatever you

[27:49] do, you just find a way to take something that people want and you just do it in a way

[27:54] that doesn't blow us away.

[27:56] And so maybe Harry Potter is going to be different.

[28:00] Maybe Harry Potter comes out.

[28:01] Look, I hope Harry Potter is different.

[28:03] I hope Harry Potter comes out blows us away.

[28:05] And then all of a sudden we're like, well, wait a minute, maybe Eric Mignor and his team

[28:10] are qualified enough to make back to the future.

[28:13] But until we see that until you can prove it, because Eric's last game, the Godfather

[28:18] was one of the most underwhelming pinball machines I think of all time.

[28:22] I mean, you set him up to fail with that damn theme.

[28:26] But man, Keith Elwyn, his rule sets, his team, and also the fact that Stern can manufacture

[28:31] the games.

[28:33] If we make back to the future with Stern, they're going to make all 10,000 games in one freaking

[28:38] year.

[28:40] You all will have the game in one year.

[28:42] Okay, so there you go, everybody.

[28:44] Let's stop arguing about politics.

[28:47] Let's all be friends.

[28:49] Let's not give up on friendships and family because they don't think the way you think.

[28:55] Having a rich life is surrounding yourself with different thinking people.

[28:59] I love each and every one of you.

[29:01] We haven't lost subscribers because of what I said or who I am.

[29:06] And I hope you respect me for who I am and I will respect you for who you are.

[29:11] And I think that's the right approach.

[29:12] And thank you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast, everybody.

[29:16] Happy Monday.

[29:17] Happy Veterans Day to all you veterans out there.

[29:20] It's amazing those who serve this country and shame on you.

[29:25] Columbia University will not celebrate Veterans Day.

[29:29] They think it's a horrible holiday.

[29:32] Screw these people.

[29:33] I mean it.

[29:34] I don't care how you think.

[29:36] You're not going to show respect for the very people that have made us free all these

[29:41] years.

[29:42] I salute each and every one of you who's a veteran of this country.

[29:46] I appreciate your service.

[29:47] You've done way more than I've ever done making a Pinball Podcast.

[29:52] Everybody happy Monday.

[29:53] Daycare is closed but work is open.

[29:55] It's going to be an interesting day in this household.
