[00:00] Good Monday morning people.

[00:18] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:20] You're weekly source for Pinball News Rumors Speculation and some of the greatest pinball

[00:27] interviews out there.

[00:29] I hope everyone enjoyed our interview with Roger Sharp.

[00:32] I thought he had some really interesting insights into the hobby in general.

[00:38] I got a lot of positive feedback from that interview.

[00:41] And Roger, you know, he really wants to see more and more pinball being played out there

[00:46] and out in the public.

[00:48] And I really found his take on pricing and themes really interesting.

[00:54] Now I personally don't think that pinball will ever come close to being out there like

[01:00] it used to be.

[01:01] And for all the reasons we talked about, right, the complexity of these machines, putting

[01:06] them on location seems to be in operators nightmare compared to where they're making their

[01:12] money, which is our redemption games and other forms of entertainment that just don't require

[01:19] looking under the hood and fixing things that are complex like pinball machines.

[01:23] So I do think pinball will be primarily a home collector device.

[01:29] But there are lots and lots of home collectors popping up on the scene who are getting into

[01:34] pinball.

[01:35] So we'll see if the home collector market can continue to grow on a global level.

[01:41] There's a lot of factors working foreign against that growth of pinball.

[01:46] It's never going to be sort of as populace out on location, but collectors are there.

[01:52] And men with money to burn, keep coming to pinball every single year.

[01:56] So we'll see how it goes.

[01:57] All right.

[01:58] So speaking of interviews and interesting people, I had the pleasure of sitting down

[02:03] Friday with the black knight.

[02:05] And I love talking to the black knight.

[02:07] He is one of the most knowledgeable people in the pinball world.

[02:11] And every time he talks, it's interesting because some people think he's long winded

[02:16] in this and that.

[02:17] And as he says quite frequently to me, you can't learn anything, Kaneda, if you don't take

[02:23] the time to learn.

[02:26] Pinside seems to be a place where the one sentence or two sentence, emotional response is

[02:31] what gets everyone going.

[02:33] But if you take the time and read, you will learn a lot.

[02:37] And he has a lot to teach.

[02:39] And so I love our conversations.

[02:41] We cover sort of this, what's going on in the hobby right now?

[02:44] We cover quality issues with stirring.

[02:46] We cover these new manufacturers and their struggles to get games out.

[02:50] And why we were recording Zambi Yeti's back glass for Magic Girl was being auctioned off

[02:59] on eBay.

[03:00] And we were sort of monitoring it.

[03:02] We ended recording right before the final hammer came down on that back glass, which ended

[03:07] up going for just a tick over $3,000.

[03:11] Which is awesome that Jeremy is being supported.

[03:14] And I think a lot of people are missing this point.

[03:16] The point of that auction was to support Zambi Yeti and put some money back in his pocket.

[03:23] He didn't get the game he deserved.

[03:25] We all know that game is worth at least $20,000.

[03:29] And so for him to recoup some of those losses by selling off some of his amazing artwork

[03:34] is great.

[03:36] These prototype back glasses, will they be remanufactured?

[03:41] Will they be recreated?

[03:42] I don't think so.

[03:44] I don't believe so.

[03:45] I know that Jeremy wants to put the Magic Girl chapter behind him.

[03:50] And he's getting rid of some really interesting stuff to put some money in his pocket.

[03:54] And that's how you need to look at this item.

[03:56] It's about supporting Jeremy.

[03:58] It's not about the physical cost of the back glass and the art.

[04:03] But as some people have said, it's also art.

[04:06] And I will always argue that pinball primarily is a work of art.

[04:11] And I think collectors out there, especially collectors, they are drawn to the artistic side

[04:16] of this hobby maybe more than anything else.

[04:20] Because we know that a lot of those collectors, they don't even like, they barely play their

[04:22] games.

[04:23] They like looking at them, waxing them and just keeping them beautiful.

[04:27] All right.

[04:28] I'm going to air the interview with Chris, the Black Knight, because he's awesome.

[04:31] And it's just so entertaining.

[04:32] I think you're going to love it.

[04:34] Without further ado, let's roll the tape.

[04:37] All right.

[04:38] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canada's pinball podcast, The Venera Ball,

[04:43] Black Knight.

[04:44] Chris, welcome back to the show.

[04:46] Hey, thanks, Canada.

[04:47] I had a question for you first though, if you don't mind.

[04:50] Shoot.

[04:51] I said, I wanted to know when the grand opening of Canada's pinball pleasure palace is going

[04:56] to open.

[04:57] And how do I get tickets?

[04:59] Right.

[05:00] It might happen in the next six months.

[05:02] So I'm getting rid of the arcade games and I'm focusing solely on pinball.

[05:08] So we've got to do the floors.

[05:11] We got to do the kitchen.

[05:12] We're, you know how renovations are.

[05:15] It reminds me of every time I see the money pit movie, I'm like, it's going to be two

[05:18] weeks into the contractors, give us a quote in two weeks.

[05:23] So we'll see.

[05:24] We'll see.

[05:25] Three.

[05:26] And you could should be able to get at least three.

[05:27] And on the side there, if you really wanted to.

[05:28] Three is the plan.

[05:29] Two in the bedroom and one in the living room.

[05:31] I like the way the living room looks with just like sort of that one to the side.

[05:37] And we've measured the bedroom so two should fit nicely in here.

[05:40] Sounds like a plan.

[05:41] I remember those days.

[05:43] Yeah.

[05:44] Yeah.

[05:45] So I think by my 41st birthday in September, we should have the grand opening.

[05:52] So I'll make sure I fly everyone in from pinside to celebrate with me.

[05:56] No, you're breaking the cardinal rule though, but Brenda's cool with that.

[06:01] Yeah, like she's actually, she's looking forward to one thing.

[06:04] And I should have clarified this on the last show when I talked about the renovation.

[06:08] She's looking forward to a real bed.

[06:11] We still want to pull out couch with every foam.

[06:14] Yeah, a topper.

[06:15] That's like a one inch thing.

[06:16] Not a real bed.

[06:18] Yeah, that got to step it up.

[06:20] I agree.

[06:21] Yeah.

[06:22] So we're, we're, we're maturing.

[06:24] Okay.

[06:25] I was going to close out this eBay listing.

[06:28] Let's start there.

[06:29] So how much do we see this Jeremy Packer magic life?

[06:34] 25500.

[06:35] Yep.

[06:36] Okay.

[06:37] Unless somebody just gets absolutely insane.

[06:39] But remember, it's Plexiglass.

[06:40] Right.

[06:41] It's not a real, it's not a mirrored backlash.

[06:43] I mean, not that the artwork isn't awesome.

[06:46] I mean, don't get me wrong.

[06:47] I mean, you know I'm a backlash collector.

[06:49] Right.

[06:50] I bought the reproduction.

[06:51] The one that you may have already seen.

[06:53] I was the person that bought the reproduction sexy girl on Plexi.

[06:58] That was on eBay just a few days ago.

[07:00] How much did that go for?

[07:02] $99.

[07:03] No, remember though, that and just so for, for edification for people that may listen

[07:09] it, Acro and Sexy Girl or, or Ranco, the original, they made two versions and they were actually

[07:15] on mirrored glass.

[07:16] That is a first generation reproduction from somebody that I don't even know who it was

[07:23] because it's not a BG Rastro.

[07:25] It doesn't look like it.

[07:27] Somebody made one and it's a good copy but it's not a mirrored backlash.

[07:30] And that's the reason why it's not worth them as much as the fact that it's on Plexiglass.

[07:34] Right.

[07:35] Well, with the magic girl translates, correct me if I'm wrong but it can't be glass

[07:40] because the speakers are screwed into it.

[07:43] No, it's Plexiglass.

[07:44] It's like Circus Voltaire.

[07:45] But can it be glass if you have speaker?

[07:47] I mean, if cut out.

[07:49] It's somebody?

[07:50] Well, no.

[07:51] Not the way it's designed.

[07:52] If somebody wanted to scan the image and make it a real backlash, you could probably overlay

[07:57] it perhaps and make a new one.

[07:59] But no, that's not glass.

[08:01] There's no way.

[08:02] You can't cut glass like that with the speaker panel.

[08:05] Right.

[08:06] Well, what's interesting about this sale?

[08:08] So Jeremy explains in the eBay listing how he's got this one prototype sample of it

[08:16] and it says prototype on it.

[08:19] But the question mark I have.

[08:21] If you look at J-Pop studio, he's got about like three or four magic girls with that prototype

[08:28] backlash in his shop, at least he did back in the day.

[08:33] And on his Zidware website, he says parts are coming soon and he lists back glass or translate

[08:41] play field and plastics.

[08:43] But that's been up now for months.

[08:45] I think I don't know if anything ever will materialize.

[08:49] But what's to stop John from seeing this eBay auction?

[08:52] Well, who owns the IPs right now?

[08:55] I own it.

[08:56] Is it Bill Brandes?

[08:57] Who owns the IPs?

[08:58] Well, it's really.

[08:59] It's American Pinball.

[09:00] I mean, who owns the real IP?

[09:03] It's a real IP.

[09:04] Curious.

[09:05] That's a huge issue.

[09:06] I don't know.

[09:07] So I think I know.

[09:08] I don't want to speculate or mishpick, but either.

[09:12] I mean, I'm not sure either because it's been floating.

[09:14] I mean, it's changed hands.

[09:16] It's exchanged.

[09:17] I just don't know who holds those rights.

[09:19] It's very similar to some of the questions that come out with planetary pinball because

[09:26] there's always been questions for, and I'm not getting into the past, but you compare

[09:31] Wayne Gillard in Australia with Rick at PPS in conjunction with Gene Cuttingham or is

[09:37] it the original company?

[09:39] Now we know in this case for Magic Girl, it's one of the three.

[09:44] It's one of those three groups of people.

[09:46] Right.

[09:47] Not ones we just talked about, but either through the Bill Brandes side or from American

[09:52] Pinball or from John Papdick.

[09:54] So, hey, I can't disclose details, but I know that Bill had the IP when American Pinball

[10:05] said they were going to make the Magic Girls.

[10:06] And look, there was a deal in place for the IP to transfer, but I'll say this.

[10:13] I don't believe the terms of that deal were met by what went out to owners.

[10:19] That's all I can really say.

[10:21] I mean, don't speculate.

[10:24] Speculation is good to some extent for certain things, but other things just gets people

[10:28] riled up.

[10:29] And I also think, ultimately, we've seen that American Pinball has washed their hands of

[10:34] John and Zidwares, so they've moved on completely.

[10:37] Bart Moog.

[10:38] So, yeah, they don't care about Zidwa or IP anymore.

[10:41] They've moved on.

[10:42] Let's start with the American Pinball, because the last time we talked, and we a lot's

[10:48] gone on in this industry, and Chris and I, we talk a lot about the boutiques and these

[10:54] new companies and their attempts to succeed in the pinball world, and how much the struggle

[11:00] is real in terms of getting off the ground for these companies.

[11:03] Now, Chris, what did you think of American Pinball actually being able to bring a working

[11:07] game to T-PF in under like five months?

[11:11] Obviously, they put a lot of hard soul in it, and they put their nose to the grindstone,

[11:15] which they should be absolutely commended for.

[11:18] Not that this isn't, I mean, I don't know how far along in terms of making adjustments

[11:22] that they had to do, but they obviously learned some lessons from their first little

[11:27] escapade and made some corrections fairly quickly.

[11:31] And one of the things that you were kind of keying in on was, and you kind of keed on

[11:37] with, we talked, you asked a question that we would talk about too, is what lessons

[11:41] could be learned from Zedware?

[11:42] There's a pair off with this, and one of it is, you have to, when you're developing a

[11:47] pinball machine, it doesn't matter if you're a starting company or you're, or you're

[11:50] an established company, is that your support team that you have has to be in place long,

[11:56] long before you actually even get into the down dirty of the design phase.

[12:01] And that's something that a lot of people overestimate on their abilities when they

[12:06] get involved in pinball as a manufacturer.

[12:09] And it's happened over and over again.

[12:10] I mean, every single company that is either tried to produce a pin or has produced a pin

[12:16] has gone through the same labors of pain and love to make it happen.

[12:21] And I mentioned in an email to you about retro pinball LLC, which nobody seems to remember

[12:27] anymore, that did the remake solid state version of King of Diamonds with her silvers,

[12:34] and his tiny number of investors that he did to make that game.

[12:40] And every single time that it's, as we talked in the past, it's not just about preparing

[12:45] manufacturers for parts, it's not about production facilities.

[12:49] Those are all critical as well.

[12:51] But if you don't have that critical support staff that's right behind you, I, you know,

[12:56] John Popdook, to kind of guide you, that's some of the same things that ran into Wichim

[13:02] cutting him.

[13:03] I mean, he had a support staff, but he needed more.

[13:06] He needed more people than he initially anticipated because he thought that he could do a lot

[13:11] of the work himself.

[13:13] And that runs into some of the delays that you see from all the different manufacturers.

[13:18] Now, as far as your question in American pinball and they're in their direction, I think

[13:23] that they're doing a very good job from the standpoint of trying to get started.

[13:27] You know what?

[13:28] I'm extremely against pre-orders.

[13:30] Right.

[13:31] Badly.

[13:32] I think that when I, and some people read that stuff online about my perspective over,

[13:38] they allowing distributors to accept pre-order deposits, not just $100 refundable, but

[13:45] some of the, you know, half down and half down stuff.

[13:47] I don't like that stuff.

[13:49] I think they need to bring the finished game to a show, put it out to the public, and be

[13:55] prepared to make it nearly immediately.

[13:57] That will get them secured sales, and nobody gets burned.

[14:01] Yeah.

[14:02] And I still don't know why nobody can understand that that is the modern day way you release

[14:08] a product.

[14:09] It's the way Apple does it, the way Stern does it.

[14:11] I've said it to my friends over at American pinball.

[14:13] I'm like, I really don't know why you guys went to T-PF, though.

[14:15] I commend you for making a working game happen in such a short period of time.

[14:22] But what good does it do to show the majority of your game eight, nine months before it's

[14:30] available?

[14:31] What good does that do?

[14:32] You're going to have to then struggle to get hype and excitement back again.

[14:37] Look at that.

[14:38] They're bringing it.

[14:39] They're bringing it.

[14:40] Yeah.

[14:41] They're bringing it now for seven months.

[14:43] You know that they're bringing a Houdini to Pag, right, Pingo?

[14:47] Yeah.

[14:48] Okay.

[14:49] So I'm going to get a chance to play it there.

[14:50] You know, you got a chance to play it in Texas.

[14:52] I'll play it there.

[14:53] I'm sure it'll be roughly the same game, although they're continuing to develop the software

[14:56] for it and fine tune it.

[14:59] It is very difficult.

[15:00] I know why the mindset of a new company, I mean, remember, I'm looking at it from the

[15:05] standpoint of a long-term hobbyist.

[15:07] So my perspective might be a little different.

[15:09] You know, I'm in tune with the industry.

[15:13] I understand the challenges of the industry.

[15:16] But it does seem a little bit premature just because they could capitalize on that marketing

[15:24] hype if they kind of tease things.

[15:26] Sort of like what even Stern does a little, does a better job at.

[15:29] They don't always tip their hand.

[15:32] And then hit them hard, especially when they have a product like they used to do, which

[15:37] was the old method at the expo.

[15:39] That was the time when they would bring this very close to finish product.

[15:42] Now occasionally they would bring prototypes and stuff because they just certainly wouldn't

[15:46] have them ready that year.

[15:48] But whatever game they were marketing was a finished product.

[15:52] It wasn't a half-bake thing.

[15:54] And like for alien right now, we can get more into that.

[15:57] That's still kind of languishing.

[15:58] Right.

[15:59] And we'll talk about that.

[16:00] But your point is a solid one because here's what I just sort of like it frustrates me

[16:05] as a marketer when I see the Houdini roll out the way it's happening because you've got

[16:10] this game.

[16:11] And the game has certain toys and mechs that are you've been working hard on.

[16:16] Like let's take the catapult for example.

[16:18] Right.

[16:19] It's got this freaking awesome catapult that fires the ball two and a half beat through the

[16:23] air into this magic box.

[16:27] That is incredible.

[16:28] And the first way you show that to the world is with people's crappy cell phone footage

[16:34] of it and you've sort of already revealed one of your coolest things ever in such a non-glorious

[16:42] way.

[16:43] And look, they could have professionally shot that mechanism working and just tease that

[16:49] and held people at bay for three, four months waiting to see what the rest of the magic would

[16:54] be in the game.

[16:55] It's just like, let's just throw everything on the plate at once, have baked a little

[16:59] bit and then you're not going to have any new surprises really.

[17:03] Maybe it should take the game to Magic Castle in California and showcase it there.

[17:07] I don't know.

[17:08] But it's just, you know, if there are a lot of opportunities, your marketer, I am not.

[17:13] I'm an engineer.

[17:14] So, you know, from my standpoint and as a collector, I would say, hold back.

[17:19] You know, hold back.

[17:20] You know, if you want to get side, I don't know if you want to talk about this now, but,

[17:24] you know, we talked, you want to talk about the Wall Street Journal article, which I also

[17:28] know, of course, was not directly you, which I knew early, but everybody else seemed to

[17:33] disagree.

[17:34] But the point with that, that seemed premature.

[17:37] The article itself, it was not particularly well written from a layman's perspective.

[17:45] It kind of shows like, hey, you know, pinball is still alive, but it's extremely struggling.

[17:51] And it's a huge challenge to make a real game.

[17:53] And for those people that aren't really in this pinball world, which is about 99% of

[17:56] the population, you know, that, that was like, hey, that's an interesting article, but

[18:01] it doesn't really put the best spin on either pinball or American pinball.

[18:06] Right.

[18:07] And it, it, it's that premature thing again.

[18:10] And it's like, yeah, maybe you should have waited a little bit and then kind of said, hey,

[18:14] and by the way, this game, although it wasn't entirely success, it was a start of a breakthrough,

[18:19] but we just are preparing to release this game called Houdini.

[18:22] Well, I think, you know, like there's a term I've heard a lot recently and that's just

[18:26] when you're tone deaf to them, to what's going on in the market and even to what your own

[18:33] achievement is, because I really think that the people at American pinball thought that

[18:36] making magic roll was really this victory lap moment and they thought that they could

[18:41] go on that victory lap with the Wall Street Journal.

[18:44] That would then get people excited for Houdini.

[18:46] I hate to be the, you know, the guy who spoiled that victory lap by showing what the game

[18:52] really was.

[18:54] And it, and when I was talking to the reporter, man, all he wanted to talk about was the failure

[18:59] of John.

[19:00] He did not want to talk about the future of AP.

[19:02] He did not want to talk about Houdini at all.

[19:05] It was, it was bad timing.

[19:07] And, and I think AP, I think now they've made up their mind on John, but when that article

[19:13] and when they see the story, I still think that they were considering working with John

[19:19] in the future.

[19:20] I think that those considerations are over with though, which is good.

[19:23] Yeah, they've got a, they've got a solid team now.

[19:26] They get their buckled down.

[19:27] You know, now it's time to move forward.

[19:29] Remember, when I posted some things about my opinions of pre-orders, I was not busting

[19:34] on American pinball.

[19:35] I was only concerned on a basis of distributors and how they handle this because it's very

[19:40] important when it comes to sales.

[19:43] American pinball wants to be successful and they let distributors do whatever they

[19:47] want to and that causes problems with the company.

[19:51] They have no foot to stand on.

[19:53] They have no reputation.

[19:55] And the only thing that happens is they get hurt.

[19:58] And it's too late when the damage is done in new owners, which, you know, are the majority

[20:04] of people that buy new pinballs right now are get upset and then also they're already

[20:10] starting to get hurt and they just started.

[20:11] I mean, I myself may buy a new Dini, but you know, I'm going to definitely see it out

[20:16] of its box playing it somewhere from its final finished product before I make purchase.

[20:21] Well, and I think they've made a cardinal mistake of setting the price already.

[20:26] It's not fully designed.

[20:28] I wouldn't have done that either.

[20:29] They don't know that.

[20:30] They don't know that.

[20:31] They don't know.

[20:32] They don't know what the bomb is going to be.

[20:33] They don't know where the market's going to be when they have to release the product.

[20:37] That's the question.

[20:39] Yeah, and that's the question I asked them.

[20:40] I basically said to them, what kind of company do you want to be?

[20:44] Do you want to sell 500 of these to high end collectors?

[20:48] Do you want to sell 2,000 of these to more of a mainstream audience?

[20:54] You know, and they, I don't think they know, right?

[20:57] And whenever I see companies going into pinball production, sort of figuring it out as they

[21:04] go, I'm like, oh man.

[21:07] It's not that kind of industry that allows for lackluster marketing research and sort

[21:12] of just like a winging it approach.

[21:14] Yeah, right now, there, obviously, we know the majority of the manufacturers at the

[21:19] exception of one are currently marketing the basis of small quantities at higher prices

[21:25] to try to offset the production requirements.

[21:28] That is the current model.

[21:29] However, that doesn't promote industry growth.

[21:34] It doesn't.

[21:35] It's just done.

[21:36] I'm going to disagree with you something that I heard on your last podcast.

[21:39] I have to because I don't agree with people.

[21:41] I'm not a conformist to everything.

[21:43] You know that.

[21:44] I disagreed with you, by the way, when we talk about productions and manufacturers regarding

[21:49] remakes, okay?

[21:51] When you talked about the attack from our remake and you were talking specifically about

[21:55] people that were selling their original games, obviously, for higher than new inbox standard

[22:03] models of the attack from our remake, that they are, you know, there's lost about, yes,

[22:09] there is.

[22:10] I agree with you on that perspective.

[22:12] However, in the long run, in the long run, the original model recoups its losses.

[22:17] Initially, it takes a hit, but eventually it recoups and people that are collectors want

[22:23] the original game.

[22:24] Now, if you're a player and you want to be an owner, there's absolutely nothing wrong

[22:30] with an attack from our remake.

[22:31] I try to explain that to people.

[22:33] I'm not against planetary pinball or, you know, or the, or Churchill cabinets.

[22:39] It's just, or sorry, Chicago gaming.

[22:41] It's just my biggest thing is that the market lost that it's initially hit from an original

[22:49] title is not, it's just like anything else.

[22:52] I hate car analogies, but it's so true.

[22:55] If you remake a 1967 stingray and you put an electronic ignition in it and you sell it

[23:01] as a remake, does that make the original worthless?

[23:04] Right.

[23:05] Well, let me ask you a question, Chris.

[23:07] What paths examples do we have to validate what you just said, right?

[23:12] So what remakes have been done that hit the original price at the beginning and then the

[23:18] original came back to recoup?

[23:20] Okay.

[23:21] You have to go really far back to the 70s and the 80s to get some of your earliest examples

[23:28] of this.

[23:29] And what I mean by that is during the transition period between the EM and the solid state

[23:34] era, there were a number of machines that were originally produced as electro mechanical

[23:39] pinball machines.

[23:41] And as a result of their initial success or the transition period, they were converted

[23:46] into solid state machines.

[23:48] However, the original games that were made always command it, well, especially over time,

[23:55] a good example of that would be Mata Hari.

[23:58] Mata Hari was originally designed as an electro mechanical pinball machine and it had about

[24:03] 170 grand.

[24:04] Rarity has a factor in this as well.

[24:07] It went on to produce thousands of solid state versions.

[24:11] In essence, that particular game is a remake because they converted it.

[24:17] Okay.

[24:18] But was there a gap though or no?

[24:20] Like it just they converted it while it was in one continuous line.

[24:24] It was a switch over production line.

[24:27] Now I actually wrote an article that let me bring it up so I can reference actual titles.

[24:33] Another remake that's pretty common that most people will remember is Fireball.

[24:38] They brought out member Fireball Classic in 1984, which is a remake of the original

[24:44] electro mechanical game.

[24:46] Okay.

[24:47] It had all the same features except a couple things.

[24:51] One of course is a used solid state technology.

[24:54] The second thing is it doesn't have zipper flippers.

[24:56] Means the ones as it were that the flippers are close together.

[24:59] As a result, if you compare the values between the remake solid state version of Fireball

[25:03] Classic and the original EM game, it's about three times the value.

[25:09] It's just because as a collector, they want the original game.

[25:15] That's where this comes from.

[25:16] But I would argue that those two examples are not really apples to apples with what's

[25:25] going on now, which what's going on now is these games that were some of the best games

[25:30] ever like 20 years ago where the used price of them went through the roof.

[25:35] Medieval manaces were going for 12 to $15,000.

[25:39] What's stuff from market too?

[25:41] I remember who is buying the games in terms of people that want to play the games.

[25:46] Like I said, there's nothing wrong with the remake and that in itself.

[25:49] But I'm not saying that that remakes will like drop through the roof and just automatically

[25:55] lose value.

[25:56] But over time, what you see is that remakes all games obviously lose value over time.

[26:02] It's like any other electronic device.

[26:05] But when it comes down to the long term bottom half of the market, there's a bottom-bottling

[26:13] that point for all games.

[26:14] It varies to based on the title and the age and so on and so on.

[26:19] I'm trying to look at some of the other comparisons.

[26:22] There are other games like, you know, there were a lot of games that were converted from

[26:25] EM, the solid state and they made a lot more of them and they all ended up in the same

[26:30] way.

[26:31] Where the original game always commanded a higher value in the long term than the remade

[26:37] game.

[26:38] The only exception that was kind of a fluke was that king of diamonds that retro pinball

[26:43] made in solid state because they made so few of them.

[26:46] It was like 30 of them or less than 50.

[26:49] So as a result, they're just plain unobtainable.

[26:53] But like I said, when you look at the values, it's not something that people are going

[26:57] to see in the next two years.

[26:58] It takes years for some of these games to balance out in terms of costs because you have

[27:04] to look at who wants the game.

[27:06] There's no doubt that the evil madness remakes will remain a popular staple of collections

[27:12] for years to come simply because the originals are unavailable.

[27:17] Right.

[27:18] And because the approach now is not just to remake it, but they're adding in the new

[27:25] displays with the new dots and that helps to retain the value for sure.

[27:29] So it's going to be interesting because I do think that it is hard to look at the past

[27:35] to know where it all will net out.

[27:37] I mean, I think with medieval madness, people will look at the new ones and man like

[27:42] the play field quality could be the one that thing that you know what it's like.

[27:47] Hey, yeah, you don't know.

[27:50] There was a lot of lessons learned from PPS when you talk about lessons learned by companies

[27:54] there too because that was another one where they weren't quite ready to build the game

[28:01] when they said they could and there was this huge lag.

[28:05] And it once again was just about support channels and parts and it wasn't about and how long

[28:11] would it take to build the games?

[28:13] It's always an underestimated thing and if they're not, if companies don't plan years

[28:18] in advance, it's hard to cash cow up quickly if you're going to do a pinball production

[28:24] because it takes so long to prepare to build the game.

[28:28] So once again, it's like, you know, don't tip your hand too early, which is what we talked

[28:31] about.

[28:32] But I can tell you this year, if people watch the new Mr. Pinball Price Guide when it gets

[28:36] released for 2017, it's 27th edition, you will see that

[28:41] medieval madness, the original games have rebounded again to hire the ray on the rise again

[28:48] and the medieval madness remakes are dropping.

[28:53] That's just the way that this is going to work for a while because now there's enough

[28:58] games of the medieval madness remakes in circulation.

[29:01] To my knowledge, they're still producing them in limited quantities.

[29:05] I don't particularly know.

[29:07] And as a result, those that are harder collectors still want the original game.

[29:13] And of course, excellent or up condition.

[29:15] They don't want to beat her.

[29:17] If that's the case, yes, they're going to buy a remake.

[29:19] So it just take those things into consideration because it just depends on your perspective.

[29:24] Are you a player?

[29:26] Are you an owner?

[29:27] Are you a collector?

[29:28] What are you?

[29:29] Sure.

[29:30] And that will determine what you're willing to pay.

[29:32] And it's interesting too because even though they just announced attack from ours and

[29:37] I think Rick did the smart thing is he waited to announce until he had production ready to go pretty.

[29:43] He learned his lessons from the medieval madness remake.

[29:46] He learned lessons and that was what was most important, which is what I said months ago when I said,

[29:51] does he have this, you know, does he have the production contract in place?

[29:55] Does he have the parts in place?

[29:57] Where is the formal advert type?

[29:59] Where is the don't speculate?

[30:01] And he, you know, because it told something actually physical hits fan, which is exactly what he did with the attack from ours on his release.

[30:09] And then he put out the advertisement information right behind it.

[30:13] Then I'm like, hey, this is a proper reveal.

[30:16] Let's go.

[30:17] Game looks great.

[30:18] By the way, it's all out of T.P.F.

[30:20] It looks phenomenal.

[30:21] And the price point is spot on.

[30:23] It's spot on.

[30:24] It's spot on based on the market.

[30:26] And he got that right.

[30:28] And I give him credit because the $6,500 price tag for the standard version is going to sell extremely well just as well as the limited edition for those who want the higher upgrades.

[30:39] Sure.

[30:40] Well, we wish them like I know they're going into production.

[30:43] I think they're going into production in May.

[30:45] I think it's happening real fast.

[30:47] As soon as they came, the more money they make.

[30:49] I'm not, like I said, I'm not beating on PPS.

[30:51] You know, my perspective on remakes is different as a collector.

[30:54] But I'm a different market.

[30:56] If I was to buy a remake right now, I would be basically being a hypocrite.

[31:01] I mean, because I don't, I mean, I'm a collector yet.

[31:05] I'll buy a remake.

[31:06] But that does to me that doesn't make any sense.

[31:08] But I'm not here to beat on the people that want to buy it.

[31:10] If they want to play a new game, and if it's choice between a crappy original game, it doesn't really work, right?

[31:17] And it's chewed the pieces or a brand new game for the same price.

[31:20] Of course, like buying a new one.

[31:21] Right.

[31:22] If I was in the store.

[31:23] Let's talk about that new inbox feeling and what's going on over it.

[31:28] Stirring these days, and we talk a lot about this with new inbox issues.

[31:33] And the latest one seems to be really problematic for them is the cabinet issues.

[31:37] Have you seen this being going on over there?

[31:39] Ah, yeah.

[31:39] Now that's a good one because I jumped in on that thread quite a few times.

[31:43] Not to try to spite people or to, I actually was trying to provide 100% guidance and support

[31:51] to help potentially eliminate the problem as soon as possible.

[31:56] I mean, that's the reason that you brought up that.

[31:58] And it's such a good topic is that it isn't about what the standards were in the past and so on and so on.

[32:04] I have personal experience in this.

[32:07] Not from the standpoint of problems with Stern because I think Stern does a good job overall for their customer service.

[32:14] It's particularly since most stuff isn't even covered by warranty.

[32:17] Roops.

[32:18] OK, I own, of course, the only Stern game currently I currently own my collection is a Metallica Premium Monsters,

[32:27] which I bought in 2015.

[32:29] It was a produced model game in 2015.

[32:32] And I got it home and I've told people in the past when you take a game out of the box,

[32:38] this is kind of that little bit of advice corner by the black night.

[32:41] OK, when you take it out of the box, don't just set it up on its legs, put the balls in and turn the game on.

[32:48] Take a look at what's going on.

[32:50] Not with the fine tooth comb.

[32:52] Like, oh my God, there's a scratch on my cabinet decal.

[32:56] But when I took the game out of the box and I put it up on my pinball doll,

[33:02] and I opened up that play field to inspect the inside of the game and I went to put the legs on.

[33:08] Two of the four legs bolt holes were stripped.

[33:14] I couldn't put the legs on.

[33:16] The screw holes were stripped out, partly because the plates that are used and most pinball machines are rather soft, softer than the leg bolts themselves, the acorn bolts.

[33:26] So I had to re thread the holes and I actually installed because the next thing I noticed when I got to put the, I looked at the play field, I go,

[33:37] wow, these joints are different.

[33:40] And they're using a square cut joint with a staple.

[33:44] It looks like a metal hinge staple with the glue.

[33:48] And I said, well, that doesn't look right.

[33:51] I mean, because I'm used to a 45 degree lock miter joint that was used for most pinball play fields in the 90s.

[34:00] And then on the 80s, they used a double lock miter joint with reinforcements.

[34:05] And none of that was existing on this Metallica.

[34:08] And I had one of course with the metal back box.

[34:11] And I said, wow, this doesn't look good.

[34:14] Now, granted, I don't shake my machines and I know how to set them up and take the pressure.

[34:19] The one of the key things that people need to understand when they're setting up their games is use something to support the weight of the cabinet when you install the legs because you need to take that weight off those bolt holes.

[34:32] Right.

[34:32] And I ended up putting in Williams and Balli plates from day one.

[34:38] And I looked at the top and I said, well, this isn't right.

[34:41] So I went out and got some proper flange, gosseted corner braces.

[34:47] And I stuck them on the top of the corners in order to what I considered to be is one of the steps that I bulletproof my games, which I do with every single one of the games that I ever owned.

[34:56] Because even if it's a use game, I usually will go through it and say, okay, does the cabinet need to be like repaired slightly or anything?

[35:04] So I don't have to worry about it down the road.

[35:06] And it's a scary thing that I don't know why it was changed.

[35:13] But I was trying to advise people that you can do some things that are simple to help potentially protect against problems.

[35:22] Now, I know that new owners may not want to do that.

[35:26] But is it really worth taking the risk when you can buy something that really isn't that expensive?

[35:33] Right.

[35:34] And now, I've noted that there's been a enormous number of changes from stern games over the past five years,

[35:41] protectually not just from the SAM system to the spike system, but also just in general build quality production.

[35:49] But of course, I was naysaid and people said I was full of crap.

[35:53] So I do what I feel that I need to do to help protect my investment, because pinball machines are still wooden boxes with,

[36:03] you know, that have lights and wire and stuff, and they're designed to be played and work around.

[36:09] So do what you can to help prevent damage, fix what you need to fix, and you have to accept the rest.

[36:17] What about, I saw a lot of conversation about the rubber furniture stoppers under the legs.

[36:28] Okay, yeah, I can explain this to you, because people don't understand what I was trying to say.

[36:32] When the games, those plates that I was mentioning that seem to people seem to be catching on to again,

[36:39] those were put back into the Williams and Balli games, because when they went to the super pins,

[36:45] like Twilight Zone and Star Trek Next Generation, Road Show, the weights of the cabinets were not necessarily strong enough

[36:54] to support the shifting that was being done in operation on a route.

[36:59] So they said, well, we need to do something about this, because operators were complaining.

[37:02] Now, keeping in mind, those cabinets are built differently.

[37:06] Not only do they have lockmider joints, the decals are not overlapping, and they are, so there's an edge seam.

[37:13] So with the cabinet splits, it's a clean split, and you can actually glue it back together,

[37:17] similar to what older games were used in the 60s and 70s.

[37:21] The problem with rubber cup casters on hardwood floors particularly is,

[37:26] without any additional reinforcement on the inside of the cabinets,

[37:31] if it gains it shoved on location, which some operators care and some don't,

[37:38] that puts a ton of torsional stress and twisting on those legs.

[37:43] And based on the joints that I saw from the current modern Stern cabinets, it will cause cracking,

[37:48] which is the reason why, unfortunately, that Ghostbusters LE that I showed you a picture of that had massive cracking,

[37:55] was exactly the case.

[37:57] Used rubber casters on hardwood floors, operators that were in the know never used rubber casters

[38:04] on the bottom of those feet in those type of hardwood floors.

[38:08] They always used pieces of cardboard or upside down carpeting to allow the machine to have give,

[38:18] but not rank or wretch the legs over if that makes sense.

[38:22] Right.

[38:23] It does.

[38:25] And to your point too, if you're a home-use only kind of guy and you're not throwing your machine around,

[38:32] it should be minimized.

[38:34] You shouldn't have too much of a problem.

[38:36] I say that because I have those rubber casters under my magic girl, but I don't move the magic girl.

[38:43] You're not shoving the thing left right.

[38:46] I don't even let people touch it.

[38:47] I don't even let people play.

[38:49] I don't recommend those even on carpet.

[38:51] I think there are better options for caster gliders that will reduce the stress.

[38:56] But once again, a pinball machine is not designed to be an unmovable object.

[39:00] If it is, it's just a wooden cabinet.

[39:03] I mean furniture that gets shoved like that would break too.

[39:07] Right.

[39:09] So all I'm trying to say is that there are small things that you can do to help potentially,

[39:16] because collectors are OCD.

[39:19] They want their games to be perfect forever.

[39:22] All I was trying to do is say, hey, here are some things that you can do to help protect your games

[39:28] from day one, just like mylar.

[39:31] Stern games aren't day one mylar all over the playfield.

[39:36] Okay.

[39:37] Now some people go the extra mile on older games and they install entire overlay,

[39:42] overlays made out of pet sheet plastic to protect the playfield surfaces, right?

[39:48] Yeah.

[39:48] I never understand why people don't just mile out of their shooter lane or the scoop entrance.

[39:53] Like, I don't, it's so easy.

[39:55] Operators did it for years.

[39:58] They did it for all the ones that were worried about that if they were considering

[40:01] the basis of doing resale down the road because after the 80s, I mean, it wasn't necessarily

[40:07] predominant in the 80s.

[40:08] But uppers like, well, when they would trade up games or they would dump their inventory and

[40:13] sell them to either private individuals or do a trade into a distributor for a new game,

[40:18] you know, obviously the condition of the games, if they were a better quality in the operator

[40:22] cared, they would take better care of it.

[40:24] So all of these tips and techniques that I'm talking about aren't new.

[40:29] They're just things that people have done for ages.

[40:32] And if someone, it's like, I got into with someone about the dimpling thing again.

[40:37] And I said, guys, do you understand the changes that have occurred in Clear Code since the 1990s?

[40:45] Even the 2000s.

[40:47] It was the request of owners after 2010 that they wanted thicker Clear Coats and shinier playfields.

[40:57] They wanted that.

[40:58] So, mid-stern responded.

[41:02] And there are some pitfalls.

[41:03] Right.

[41:03] Durable, Alacity, Clear Coats will crack.

[41:08] Or dimple.

[41:10] They just will.

[41:12] I have a real-time update.

[41:14] Chris, Magic Girl has received another bid for the Translate.

[41:17] We are now up to $2,425.

[41:22] $47 bids are in.

[41:25] Getting close.

[41:25] How many minutes are left?

[41:27] There is an hour and 18 minutes.

[41:29] Oh, we got money at time.

[41:31] Yeah, it ends at midnight.

[41:32] It ends at midnight.

[41:33] Eastern time.

[41:33] I hope it's like a million dollars for it.

[41:36] Because he could buy a whole collection games or a new car or a house.

[41:41] I don't know.

[41:41] Whatever.

[41:42] You know, it's probably J-pop bidding on it.

[41:44] He needs it to like finish another game.

[41:47] I looked at the general, you know, the hidden bitter, you know,

[41:51] listing of people.

[41:52] And obviously, there doesn't look like there's any shilling.

[41:54] I mean, it looks legitimate that there's a lot of people

[41:57] that are interested in buying that artwork.

[41:59] And I like the artwork too.

[42:00] I'm not sure it's worth that amount.

[42:02] This is getting up in the same loan as that big-foot,

[42:05] Plexiglass from Bali a few months ago that went into what they call

[42:11] Offline Bitting Wars.

[42:12] And I had the step out.

[42:13] It was up around here too.

[42:15] You could.

[42:16] I would imagine if you went to Jeremy and offered him $2,400,

[42:20] he would make you any kind of an integral artwork you would want.

[42:24] Maybe he has another one hiding in his closet.

[42:26] Yeah, he's like, oh, I just found five more.

[42:31] Well, let's talk about, look, because I agree.

[42:34] I think Stern hasn't officially responded yet to this cabinet thing.

[42:37] I think they will have to come out and say something.

[42:40] I think they will fix people's problems for those that are severe.

[42:44] But once again, I caution new owners when they're buying new games and

[42:48] spec their games.

[42:49] Don't go bat shit crazy.

[42:51] But if you have, if you look at a game and you have a question,

[42:55] you know, and like I did, I'm like, this looks different.

[42:58] Maybe I can, maybe I should do something to help eliminate this potential problem

[43:02] before it happens.

[43:04] Just spend a few extra bucks.

[43:05] Don't, don't, you know, get into a tizzy over it.

[43:09] And yours games is, you know, it's going to be as good as you can make it.

[43:13] I mean, what about the missing wood?

[43:15] I saw images of like wood missing at the joint.

[43:19] And did you see that?

[43:20] Well, that was, that was a crack.

[43:21] It looked like what they did when they formed some of the side panels

[43:25] that there would might have been some, some damage when it could have happened,

[43:30] you know, before the cabinets were put together.

[43:32] A lot of them looked like it was coming apart because of the,

[43:35] well, I don't know what glue they're using.

[43:37] I mean, from like 1960 something or plus, they've always used high glue,

[43:43] which has made out of horse-eyed.

[43:45] And I mean, it's not super duper industrial glue.

[43:48] So if you have splitting that comes apart from those seams,

[43:51] because that joint is not a fully mitered joint,

[43:54] which is what I'm used to and say, cabinets,

[43:57] you're going to start seeing some splitting that will come apart from them,

[44:01] just from, you know, moderate normal shifting and taking the

[44:07] lock bar off and on.

[44:08] I mean, it could happen.

[44:09] It could happen.

[44:10] Well, and we saw that Stern is now adjusted the decals to not wrap around,

[44:14] but have a crease that allows for if that hairline split occurs.

[44:19] They're undercutting them.

[44:21] Basically, they're leaving those gaps in the quarters.

[44:25] And I saw that some had it and some didn't.

[44:28] Honestly, this begs the question is how many people were making their cabinets?

[44:33] Right.

[44:34] I mean, it almost looks like there's more than one source that's being done to

[44:39] make the cabinet.

[44:40] Well, once again, I'm not sitting at the Stern factory.

[44:42] So I don't know what's going on.

[44:44] All I know is that from when I look at it, these are not as well-made cabinets.

[44:48] And it's just my opinion, from my experience,

[44:51] that these cabinets are not as well constructed.

[44:54] As the ones that were starting from all the way back into the 1960s.

[44:59] I mean, I made the example of four million bees,

[45:02] or so not four million bees, but caveman.

[45:06] Caveman is one of the heaviest pinball machines ever made.

[45:10] That was a normal size machine.

[45:12] And it had a doubled miter joint, metal supports and wood struts,

[45:17] and all sorts of crazy stuff, along with the support crossbar that no longer exists in

[45:22] modern pinball machines.

[45:23] And that thing never falls apart.

[45:26] So that's what I think is worrisome to people is.

[45:31] And we talk about this all the time.

[45:33] The prices are going up, and the quality is going down.

[45:36] Yep.

[45:36] And you just can't keep consumers coming back for more with that approach.

[45:43] Now, it's going to hurt eventually.

[45:45] I'm surprised it hasn't been them yet.

[45:47] But right now, there's such a huge influx of new buyers

[45:50] that it offsets some of the noise.

[45:52] Once again, I have no doubt that Stern will address these problems.

[45:56] But if things just went back to, I mean, pinballs have cabinets have pretty much been made the same

[46:03] for 50 years.

[46:05] So why change the joints?

[46:08] I don't know.

[46:09] I can't answer this.

[46:10] All I know is I see what I see.

[46:13] I've got one of their games in my house.

[46:15] I took care of it, and now I don't have any cracks.

[46:18] Right.

[46:18] I don't.

[46:19] Now, and there's no doubt if a person is wanting to resell their game,

[46:23] and this issue has become prevalent with games since whatever, 2015, or whatever,

[46:30] then that will of course affect the resell value of the game.

[46:34] It will.

[46:35] But don't keep in mind.

[46:36] I mean, I remember I have an Indiana Jones from 1998, and the right hand side of the cabinet

[46:43] started to come apart.

[46:44] And it was just based on age, and guess what I did.

[46:47] I got him some high-end industrial wood glue.

[46:50] I got my clamps in, and I locked it down, and guess what?

[46:53] It's because good as new.

[46:54] Right.

[46:55] Well, I think one of the reasons why Stern continues to get away with it is that

[46:59] no one else is really shipping games.

[47:02] And let's talk about, let's talk about production over at highway.

[47:06] And we've been hearing about how they're ramping up.

[47:09] It's the longest ramp up in the history of pinball ramp ups.

[47:13] Here we are almost at the end of April 2017, and only a baker's dozen of games have trickled

[47:21] out there.

[47:22] In the prototypes in Art Real?

[47:24] Yep, these handmade prototypes that are still just the beta test units are going out.

[47:33] But what do you think is going on over there?

[47:35] I mean, we talk a lot, and we speculate some on it, but we haven't seen the early artwork.

[47:42] Andrew set two new dates by which he wants to reveal that one is Alien Day, which is next week,

[47:48] and the other is the day the movie comes out, Alien Covenant, which is May 19th.

[47:55] He's coming towards these finish lines now, where I feel like if he doesn't deliver on these

[48:00] dates, people are going to start to jump ship and mass exodus.

[48:04] Well, he's definitely at this purely an opinion.

[48:07] I'm going to say that out loud. It's an opinion. I think he's been stalling for time to try to

[48:11] get the game ready to be produced, and that's the reason why he sent out the prototypes.

[48:16] To say, look, here they are. They're shipping, and hopefully they continue to get influx of

[48:23] income for it to build the machines.

[48:25] So it's pretty a...

[48:26] I think that's a really...

[48:27] A money...

[48:27] We need enough. There's a certain dollar amount you need before you can actually start a production line.

[48:33] Well, if you're really going to get furious, yes.

[48:35] But once again, I don't know how many games he can build in a week, a month, a day.

[48:41] I don't know. I have never visited his facility.

[48:43] So I don't know what he's truly capable of, because nobody really has an estimate based on his

[48:49] first game. I don't know how many games are built, and I don't know how long...

[48:53] That's been over what? Three plus years?

[48:56] How many full throws? I don't know.

[48:58] So the best guess that it's under 150 for full throwout of all these?

[49:04] That's what most people guess, but once again, nobody knows.

[49:07] If you take them three years, build 150 units of full throttle.

[49:11] How long is it going to take them to build 500 of an alien?

[49:15] Yeah, I was always worried about that when...

[49:17] It's 1020?

[49:20] Yeah, we don't have experience building in volume.

[49:24] Sometimes orders can be a curse, not just a blessing.

[49:27] If you get 2000 orders for an alien,

[49:31] and you only sort of trickle about 150 full throttles over three years,

[49:36] you're not equipped to fulfill those orders, which is a big problem for a manufacturer.

[49:41] There's a critical mass coming with some of these boutiques.

[49:45] You see it, I see it. It's part of the stall, and the critical mass is coming.

[49:50] Well, the same thing with Dutch.

[49:51] Let's lose, we're going to lose manufacturers.

[49:53] Of course, nothing about it.

[49:55] Let's look at Dutch.

[49:57] I mean, how is it not a money issue that...

[50:01] It's not money at Shukod.

[50:03] It is.

[50:03] To say it's not...

[50:05] Everybody we got distributors on the hook right now.

[50:08] They have investments with the company themselves.

[50:10] You got people who have been waiting for the games for three years.

[50:13] I mean, it's more about not just about being impatient.

[50:16] It's about we're at the point, and this has happened many times.

[50:23] There's been lots of little short starts and stops that people have tried to do this.

[50:32] I feel really bad for the number of people that are still awaiting their pre-orders for

[50:38] their big Lebowski's.

[50:40] I want them to get their games.

[50:42] But, you know, it should not take...

[50:48] At least they're still at the table.

[50:50] I talked to some people recently about the ARA and that at least they're still at the

[50:54] table to negotiate the purposes of a new manufacturing contract.

[50:58] Because, I mean, it's not dead, but time is slipping.

[51:02] And if they don't get...

[51:04] I mean, I'm not here to tell people I told you so.

[51:08] Because if I say something like that, then they people think I'm like...

[51:12] They become public enemy number one.

[51:14] And they treat you like they're getting...

[51:16] Well, yeah, and they treat you like you're betting against the hobby.

[51:19] That's not what we're doing.

[51:20] We're just trying to get people to think critically about where they spend their money.

[51:25] But I don't think that...

[51:27] There are other forums, obviously, outside of Pinside.

[51:29] I don't think Pinside is a good example of what I call a more moderated collector

[51:35] that is a little more grounded in understanding.

[51:38] I mean, there are people who are willing to risk small amounts of money.

[51:42] But I just talked to one of my friends who's selling a fair amount of the games he just bought

[51:46] new out in box because they were still in box.

[51:49] And he says, you know what?

[51:50] I get what you're trying to tell me now.

[51:52] I'm getting out of this.

[51:54] I'm stopping the madness.

[51:56] I'm stopping taking risks on things that I don't know are going to happen.

[52:01] Because he...

[52:03] You know, there was a certain pain factor that was involved.

[52:05] It's that angst that you have personally witnessed with your magic girl and Kim Mitchell.

[52:13] And people...

[52:15] You know the pain?

[52:16] Yeah, it's not fun.

[52:17] And these guys...

[52:17] It is not fun.

[52:18] They're locked in for years.

[52:22] They're kicking themselves in, especially with highways model.

[52:26] I know for a fact, people who have paid info for a machine for three years.

[52:32] And they just got the line cut by people who rocked up with cash at the end.

[52:37] Yeah, that really blows too.

[52:39] You know what I mean?

[52:40] But it happens.

[52:41] Jack did the same thing with Hobbit.

[52:43] He did the same thing with Waz.

[52:45] Any...

[52:45] There's never been an example of a game that if you want it bad enough,

[52:50] you can go get it right when it comes out.

[52:53] And it's a real game.

[52:55] And you can get it within probably two weeks of launch.

[52:58] Without any sleepless nights, you might pay another grand more.

[53:03] But that peace of mind is totally worth it.

[53:06] I spoke to Charlie Martin, the owner of Seattle Spin-Mole Museum.

[53:11] For some people they may have saw, I was playing dialed in for the first time last weekend.

[53:15] And he asked a very good question.

[53:17] He's like, well, if owners were given the chance to spend an additional $1000 to get their game now,

[53:23] would they do it?

[53:24] And the answer is absolutely.

[53:26] They've waited so long to get it.

[53:27] But they, of course, still pay them $1000.

[53:29] Well, that's why I'm not playing games.

[53:30] Just because I'm used about Lebowski.

[53:33] Because it's clearly a case of...

[53:38] We thought you were going to build us our games for this much money.

[53:41] ARA saying it's actually...

[53:43] It's costing us this much.

[53:44] There's a difference there.

[53:46] And I know that the way they were structuring the deal is ARA would be paid for every Lebowski ship.

[53:52] So about 50 went out.

[53:53] Now those 50 were not paid for.

[53:57] What happened is Dutch got the bill for those 50 that went out after 40 more were made and ready to go out.

[54:05] And that's when they should have the best.

[54:06] Well, there was trust.

[54:07] They could have made it.

[54:07] There was a trust...

[54:08] Yeah, right.

[54:09] There was a trust agreement based on the manufacturing contract.

[54:12] And there was definitely a breakdown in this significant communication, which I'm not privy to.

[54:18] I'm not in the Netherlands.

[54:20] I don't know what happened.

[54:22] But I might just kind of relate something similar to some of these analogies about what you just said is,

[54:29] if you want something, it will be available.

[54:32] There was a post just recently.

[54:33] I had the chime in.

[54:35] It was a funny.

[54:35] It was actually an RGP.

[54:37] And somebody really, really, really, really wanted a big bang bar translate.

[54:43] And I was like,

[54:45] Well, these have been available since like 1996.

[54:49] And they've been flooding the market for years.

[54:53] And now all of a sudden, because of course there's higher levels of interest in the pinball community,

[54:58] they've kind of sort of finally dried up.

[55:01] And says, you know, where do I get one?

[55:03] No sources have them.

[55:05] All the regular ones that used to have tons of them were gone.

[55:07] And I said, look, be patient.

[55:10] They show up at every pinball show on a wall.

[55:14] For like $100, $80, whatever they are.

[55:17] Okay.

[55:18] They're out there.

[55:19] The same thing applies for collectors if they want a game.

[55:23] Unless it's some weird-ass prototype that has never been made.

[55:27] And it's available.

[55:29] If I'm telling you, the industry will be better off if people put their hands in their pockets and not in their wallet.

[55:34] Because it will force the manufacturers to build their games first.

[55:41] And it will force distributors to do their jobs.

[55:45] Not feeding.

[55:47] And people thought I was overzealous saying that they're feeding on praying on new collectors ignorance.

[55:53] And I'm sorry, it's happened.

[55:55] You've already watched it.

[55:56] I don't need to say I told you so to anybody.

[55:59] Because nobody wants to admit it, but they already know it.

[56:02] Well, and if I could go back and I even tell this to Brenda as it'll look,

[56:05] she saw me struggle for six months with the whole magic of fiasco.

[56:10] And look, most people will struggle for five years.

[56:13] But at the end of the day, would I paid?

[56:15] I could have paid maybe 25,000, 2000 more than I paid and had a game

[56:21] right when they came out in February without waiting without any sleepless night.

[56:25] Oh, it's no doubt.

[56:26] And it would have preferred that.

[56:30] But here's the question.

[56:32] Now, granted, you obviously have a lot of information and experience into the magical saga.

[56:40] Not just from what you're saying, but also from what you know and also being a buyer.

[56:46] A good question that I will ask for your listeners would be,

[56:50] is not whether you would go back and do it all again.

[56:52] But if you had the opportunity right now,

[56:56] and you had not bought into that game and you had waited until it had been released,

[57:00] maybe you'd bought it for a few extra thousand dollars or not.

[57:03] Would you still have bought it once you realized what the end product truly was?

[57:07] Now, it's a great question.

[57:08] And would you have still bought it when I did blackble or a prototype?

[57:13] Just all about it.

[57:14] When I did buy it, I thought it would fully function.

[57:16] So I did not have information that it would be a half functioning machine.

[57:21] This is the piece that this is.

[57:22] Yeah, and I say this, and this is weird, but like I still would have wanted a magical,

[57:27] and I'll tell you why, because I literally I love the art and I love I love the story.

[57:34] You know, I love these rare items that are even if they're not complete,

[57:39] even and to me, and people have a hard time understanding when I explain this part of it,

[57:45] to me, Magic Girl and its incomplete state is what Magic Girl kind of,

[57:49] we always knew it would be.

[57:52] If you change it too much, and I know people are working on a fix.

[57:56] But if you fix too much of it, and if you rip out John's crazy center mechanism,

[58:01] that's three layers of nothing.

[58:03] If you rip all that out, and you put in something that works,

[58:07] do you still have what makes Magic Girl an interest in conversation,

[58:10] Peach, which is that three layer mechanism that clearly stunts it as a ability to finish the

[58:16] game for three years, and you could see why when you look at it.

[58:20] You know, so it's like, I'm pulling your collector.

[58:22] That's the point.

[58:23] Is your collector?

[58:25] I see it as from a different set of eyes.

[58:26] And I said it from the very beginning, I see it as art.

[58:29] And as I look at this translate on eBay, I think others do too.

[58:33] Right people.

[58:34] There's nothing wrong with it.

[58:35] As long as you're looking at it and you're satisfied with what you bought,

[58:38] knowing what you bought.

[58:40] Great.

[58:41] Don't create it.

[58:41] I don't crap on other people because they buy prototypes.

[58:44] So don't necessarily work.

[58:45] There's plenty of games out there that happened like Magic Girl,

[58:49] but they bought them for that same reason.

[58:51] You know, I would ask the question, if somebody bought all those owners that bought their

[58:56] super early, they weren't directly related purely to the certain,

[58:59] stern company as long-term supporters or connected investors or whatever,

[59:04] are they truly happy with their Batman super early with their current state of the code?

[59:10] Are they really happy?

[59:12] Now we're standing getting on close to six months later and it's still incomplete.

[59:16] Really?

[59:17] They spent that much money.

[59:19] I mean, obviously, stern listen for Aerosmith when they put this back last.

[59:23] I feel like the day after Batman code gets to the point where it actually becomes a decent

[59:30] game Star Wars is going to get revealed and no one's going to care.

[59:33] Yeah, I think those from what I can take from my friends doing an SLE, they're not happy.

[59:39] They're not happy.

[59:40] Right.

[59:40] I mean, I'm not saying they have to complain on Pinside.

[59:42] I'm saying if you know, if this is nothing to do with Look Before You Leap,

[59:46] we've talked about this.

[59:47] Everybody would say you're just repeating record.

[59:50] But my point is, is if they had no, they put trust and faith in a company.

[59:56] You know that I'm a supporter of the industry, I'm a supporter of collectors and I'm a supporter

[01:00:02] of knowledge and wisdom.

[01:00:04] If they knew, would they still have bought it?

[01:00:08] Some of them probably not.

[01:00:09] Yeah.

[01:00:11] Well, and about the other side too of the Batman coin, regardless of the code,

[01:00:16] I really think a lot of the SLE owners have looked down at the machine and just they can't

[01:00:23] see where the money went.

[01:00:24] And I know for a fact too, because there's nothing really that special or different from the

[01:00:31] regular version of the game, it's almost like you have the same exact experience.

[01:00:37] It's another thing that over time, when I talk to these guys, they kind of just shrugged

[01:00:41] their shoulders and they're like, yeah, you know, it is what it is.

[01:00:44] They all got taken for a ride.

[01:00:48] Will it happen again?

[01:00:50] Yes.

[01:00:51] Of course it will.

[01:00:51] Of course it will.

[01:00:53] Remember, there's still hardcore collectors in the pinball world.

[01:00:56] I mean, there's several thousand of them out in the world.

[01:00:59] I mean, granted.

[01:01:00] I mean, back in the 90s, people said, I just heard the statement from somebody the other day,

[01:01:05] nobody bought pinballs in the 1990s.

[01:01:07] Oh god, here we go again.

[01:01:09] It's like, you know, look guys, that's not true.

[01:01:12] I mean, in the 1990s, there were some of the between 20 and 25,000 collectors.

[01:01:17] When you say collectors, they might have one or two machines.

[01:01:19] And obviously that pales in comparison to the number of people that are today,

[01:01:23] because it's greatly increased.

[01:01:24] But I'm telling you that the conditions of buying games,

[01:01:29] they don't, it doesn't, it really isn't that much different.

[01:01:32] If you think about it, what is the current operator?

[01:01:35] It's the homeowner.

[01:01:36] Right.

[01:01:36] The homeowner is the new is the new operator.

[01:01:39] If the homeowner is the new operator, but games as, you know, coin operating devices

[01:01:44] are still being built under the standards of operators,

[01:01:48] then it becomes the responsibility of the owner, meaning private ownership,

[01:01:53] to be responsible for their games from the standpoint using the same standards,

[01:01:57] until pinball machines become recognized as consumer electronics devices,

[01:02:04] which they are not yet.

[01:02:06] The warranty practices just started to change.

[01:02:09] I don't know if you noticed that.

[01:02:12] PPS with the tech from Warren's remake.

[01:02:15] They're offering a different warranty.

[01:02:17] Yeah, the LE has a, as a traditional Warren T.

[01:02:20] And why is that?

[01:02:21] Because people, they're like, okay, we recognize that the home ownership is now

[01:02:25] the predominant market and they are not necessarily the same savviness as operators were in the past.

[01:02:32] So, I mean, I'm going to be brutally honest.

[01:02:34] I mean, if you have an MMR and we know how big that central SMD board that sits underneath

[01:02:39] the play field, it goes belly up.

[01:02:42] And it's out of warranty.

[01:02:43] Right now, it's $299 for a replacement.

[01:02:47] Because if it doesn't work, your game's in a op.

[01:02:50] Right.

[01:02:51] Okay.

[01:02:51] So, yeah, it makes complete sense for manufacturers to provide additional warranties.

[01:02:56] These are all things that are coming down the track.

[01:02:58] And as these things develop, improvements were resolved in the industry.

[01:03:02] And I look forward to those times.

[01:03:04] But right now, people are still, unfortunately, manufacturers are still producing games as if they did

[01:03:10] from the 1990s in some ways.

[01:03:13] But they're providing them for a different market.

[01:03:16] All right.

[01:03:17] And that's a problem.

[01:03:18] I mean, that's a huge problem.

[01:03:20] Right.

[01:03:20] I really think a year from now, a lot of what we see in terms of manufacturers and how things

[01:03:28] are operate.

[01:03:28] It's all going to shift.

[01:03:29] I think this year's have a really unstable year.

[01:03:32] We're...

[01:03:32] Oh, it's a rough one.

[01:03:33] Yeah.

[01:03:34] And it's...

[01:03:35] It's the next six to eight months are going to be really brutal on a lot of manufacturers.

[01:03:42] Don't think we're going to see most of them survive the year.

[01:03:44] I've said it before.

[01:03:46] It doesn't look good.

[01:03:47] You can't do the math.

[01:03:48] You can't run the numbers.

[01:03:49] You can't justify how they could survive.

[01:03:52] You just can't.

[01:03:53] And,

[01:03:53] inside the place where you can't say that stuff anymore because we just have to cheerlead

[01:03:57] and let people lose money.

[01:03:59] So that...

[01:04:00] Rises are dropping too.

[01:04:01] People are noticing that now, oh, wait a minute, games are dropping.

[01:04:04] Right.

[01:04:04] They are dropped because now that it's not a glut, it's a very healthy volume of inventory.

[01:04:12] Some people are reaching their saturation points in regards to how much they can spend.

[01:04:18] And new inbox games are now starting to be overtaken by used games based on the pricing.

[01:04:26] And that stall that I've been talking about and you have to now is happening.

[01:04:32] It's happening as we speak.

[01:04:34] I mean, I don't...

[01:04:35] I mean, on a side note that I think is kind of a small funny conversation that we can have was,

[01:04:41] what about people selling their old attack from ours is again?

[01:04:45] I mean, people are trying to cash out.

[01:04:48] Of course.

[01:04:49] And cash is gaining is rumored to be the next and that's why we're seeing those people try to

[01:04:53] cash out at the high.

[01:04:54] You can't sell an original attack from ours for $9,000 if you can buy a standard model for $6500.

[01:05:02] I'm not going to argue that point.

[01:05:04] Right.

[01:05:05] When I think...

[01:05:05] The games that create the stall in the secondary market or just sort of,

[01:05:10] I think, help levels set the market.

[01:05:12] Is that $2,200 Aerosmith Pro?

[01:05:15] Definitely helps.

[01:05:17] That game, when you look at it with the LCD, the artwork, everything in it, it's really hard

[01:05:23] to start to be like, you know what, I'm going to go drop 9 grand on a hobbit used.

[01:05:27] Yeah, it's not going to happen.

[01:05:29] There are reaches that baseline you're talking about is that people start to reflect

[01:05:34] on what's available in the market and they start...

[01:05:37] And this is where the education starts.

[01:05:39] Initially, when people get involved in this hobby and they're not

[01:05:42] involved in regards to understanding the market or the industry, they do start to look around

[01:05:48] and shop around.

[01:05:49] And once they start to see what reality is based on pricing, based on that they're not necessarily

[01:05:54] these new collectors anymore, then they start to get a little more savvy and they say,

[01:05:58] why am I spending that money that you just said?

[01:06:01] That doesn't make a lot of sense.

[01:06:04] And as a result, you start to see the stalling and the leveling out and then you have certain games

[01:06:10] that stick in the mud for months or years at a time until somebody decides to come down to

[01:06:15] earth, especially with the mods.

[01:06:18] And like I said, I'm looking forward to that too, but keep in mind, we've talked about before,

[01:06:24] pinball is still affordable.

[01:06:26] It is.

[01:06:27] It just be realistic in terms of your goals or be willing to pay the price for the time being.

[01:06:35] Right, and that's why I think with the inventory being where it's at,

[01:06:41] you know, this whole climate of having your money locked in with a pre-order of a game you've

[01:06:47] waited through, it's over guys.

[01:06:48] Like it's coming.

[01:06:50] It's coming.

[01:06:50] It's done.

[01:06:52] Once attacked from Mars starts shipping, once Star Wars is revealed, the requests for refunds

[01:06:57] that are going to happen to people who are sick of waiting for Lebowski, sick of waiting for

[01:07:03] Alien.

[01:07:03] And that is going to be what syncs those companies.

[01:07:06] Companies?

[01:07:07] Yep, I'm just going to hold it.

[01:07:08] It's going to kind of forward to refund people.

[01:07:12] Well, that's not the, like I said, that's not the first time that this happened.

[01:07:16] I mean, retro pinball LC in 2010 had the same problem.

[01:07:21] There was a rebound that was happening based on the market.

[01:07:24] They were a small company.

[01:07:26] And guess what?

[01:07:28] You know, Stern was starting to pump out some good machines.

[01:07:31] They just started the rebound.

[01:07:33] And, you know, they weren't able to meet the production quotas.

[01:07:37] They couldn't meet the requirements.

[01:07:39] The initial hype was, they missed the window.

[01:07:43] Pete, they kind of overestimated the interest in terms of people wanting to buy an old game

[01:07:48] that was now solid state over a new game, such as what Stern was producing.

[01:07:52] Because this is past in the period of Tron.

[01:07:56] And, you know, the hype died.

[01:07:58] And as a result though, but they didn't have the capital fall back.

[01:08:01] And as a result, the company had to close.

[01:08:04] Right.

[01:08:05] And that's the kind of, that's what I'm saying.

[01:08:07] History does repeat itself.

[01:08:08] I won't say it purely repeats itself.

[01:08:11] I'm going to do the Samuel Clemens thing.

[01:08:13] You know, history doesn't always completely repeat itself,

[01:08:16] but it surely does rhyme.

[01:08:18] It really doesn't mean how long these companies can drag it out.

[01:08:26] Like it is, you know, whether or not like,

[01:08:29] Dutch can survive a highway or these other institutions.

[01:08:33] But man, they do tend to drag it out.

[01:08:35] And they do tend to keep accepting money,

[01:08:38] even if they know the future's bleak.

[01:08:40] And like, I get it.

[01:08:41] I mean, there's nobody wants to fail in the world of business.

[01:08:46] But, man, I think you can only spend money on a real thing now.

[01:08:54] If you haven't learned that one lesson,

[01:08:57] then you're just going to put your money and your happiness and jeopardy.

[01:09:03] There's lots of happiness in pinball.

[01:09:05] Just don't, don't, remember what I said?

[01:09:07] Don't, you know, don't get off the LE train.

[01:09:10] You know, don't, don't get on, don't go drive your time on the

[01:09:13] Star Wars LE train.

[01:09:15] But I want to get off it.

[01:09:17] I'll tell you why I know they're going to make other versions of it.

[01:09:19] Ju-ju.

[01:09:20] They're going to make, they're going to make character versions.

[01:09:23] They're going to make vault editions of it.

[01:09:25] Like Star Wars will be made for the next five years.

[01:09:29] If it's that popular, it'll turn into another map.

[01:09:32] Yeah, they'll be Metallica over again.

[01:09:34] What do you mean that?

[01:09:36] I mean, that popular.

[01:09:36] Star Wars as a theme blows Metallica away.

[01:09:40] Well, the game be as good as the real question.

[01:09:41] So we'll see.

[01:09:42] Hey, maybe everybody should start selling off their DADY Star Wars.

[01:09:46] They're trying to steal a key.

[01:09:48] They're, they're, they're, they're, they're, you know, the Williams episode.

[01:09:52] They're all worthless now.

[01:09:54] It's only the start.

[01:09:55] They're only going to be worth money.

[01:09:56] Some guys, just come on.

[01:09:58] Some guys, some guys got the daddy East one on eBay.

[01:10:00] I think for like 12 grand or something.

[01:10:02] It's like, oh my god.

[01:10:04] Yeah, it was home you solely.

[01:10:05] It's called the new one, new out of box, right?

[01:10:08] Yep.

[01:10:08] New, new, new out of box.

[01:10:11] Well, Chris, we're at the hour mark.

[01:10:13] This has been great.

[01:10:15] We're going to do this again soon because I think a lot's going to happen.

[01:10:17] I want to get you back on when Star Wars gets revealed,

[01:10:20] when it attacked from Mars, start shipping.

[01:10:21] It's a big starting.

[01:10:21] And we're, look, we're seeing, we're seeing a lot of volatility

[01:10:26] and a lot of stuff happening in real time that.

[01:10:30] I don't mean to say like, we're kind of predicting what is happening.

[01:10:35] We predicted it months ago and we're in the middle of it.

[01:10:38] We predicted alien wouldn't ship.

[01:10:39] We predicted Dutch would stall.

[01:10:41] Like, it's happening people.

[01:10:43] We're not here to sort of make this stuff up.

[01:10:45] We're not sabotaging the efforts of these companies.

[01:10:49] We're simply looking at history saying there's a good chance

[01:10:53] it will repeat itself.

[01:10:55] Yeah.

[01:10:56] I guess I can say from this center, from my perspective,

[01:10:59] is do what you can to protect your games

[01:11:02] when you get them home, whether they're new or used.

[01:11:04] And because they are investments of a sort.

[01:11:08] I don't look at them as pieces of gold.

[01:11:11] But if you do take care of them, you will not generally lose value

[01:11:16] in the long term and be able to enjoy them as you go.

[01:11:21] Right.

[01:11:21] It's good advice.

[01:11:23] So that's the people you get that.

[01:11:24] Here's a great thing people.

[01:11:26] You get that advice for free.

[01:11:29] It doesn't cost you anything.

[01:11:31] I don't have a lot of that Charlie Brown

[01:11:34] health corner would Lucy for five cents or whatever.

[01:11:36] So that's what it's like.

[01:11:39] This podcast, Chris, is one of the most popular

[01:11:42] Pimbal Podcasts.

[01:11:43] I've never been approached once by any Pimbal vendors

[01:11:46] to sponsor the show.

[01:11:49] It might change.

[01:11:50] It might change.

[01:11:51] It's not that nifty out of the deal.

[01:11:52] You stick around along enough.

[01:11:54] You might be number one none.

[01:11:55] And you know, you know, we're trying.

[01:11:58] I'm well Chris.

[01:11:59] I really appreciate you taking the time on this Friday night.

[01:12:02] We got 48 minutes until the magic girl back.

[01:12:06] He's got it listed as a backlash.

[01:12:07] It's not even a backlash.

[01:12:09] But it's equivalent to it.

[01:12:12] I guess, well, I guess right.

[01:12:13] It's on the back and it's plexiglass.

[01:12:14] It's right.

[01:12:15] I mean, it is a plexiglass.

[01:12:16] It is a backlash.

[01:12:17] It's just made out of a different material.

[01:12:19] But hey, maybe you'll go buy a new game with it.

[01:12:21] I don't know.

[01:12:22] I mean, hey.

[01:12:22] I love it.

[01:12:23] I love it.

[01:12:24] What do you think?

[01:12:25] I think.

[01:12:26] What's that?

[01:12:27] Speculate one last thing and then we'll go.

[01:12:28] Sure.

[01:12:29] What do you think a magic girl play field would go for?

[01:12:32] Knowing that a backlash is going for this.

[01:12:35] The first ones that come up for sale will probably run

[01:12:37] around $3, $4,000 if it gets stupid.

[01:12:43] I mean, obviously they shouldn't go for more than maybe $2,000,

[01:12:46] $2,000, $2,500.

[01:12:47] They're not worth that much.

[01:12:49] But once again, it depends on the individual that wants it.

[01:12:52] If for some ungodly reason that John

[01:12:56] is able to sell his license IP and he sell,

[01:13:00] I mean, you said it yourself, man,

[01:13:01] he should have done that like long time ago.

[01:13:04] And if I have the whole company with the art.

[01:13:06] The first, I'm on the market.

[01:13:08] I always look for things that I don't have.

[01:13:11] The first of anything that's ever seen

[01:13:13] will always go for a higher price.

[01:13:14] That's normal.

[01:13:15] That's the way it is.

[01:13:17] Over time, it will subside.

[01:13:19] But yeah, that's my speculation.

[01:13:21] I would say somewhere between $3,000 and $4,000,

[01:13:25] it based entirely on this little, I don't know,

[01:13:30] when you want to call it, an interesting anecdote

[01:13:33] in the Magic Girl saga.

[01:13:35] Yep.

[01:13:36] That's what this is.

[01:13:37] There's another little anecdote into the story.

[01:13:39] First prototype back last sold on eBay for $2,500.

[01:13:44] I should sell my little Plexi owl that I took off.

[01:13:48] And when I replaced with the Magic Spot

[01:13:50] and see how much that little guy goes.

[01:13:51] Do you have a keychain?

[01:13:53] Did you get a keychain?

[01:13:54] What?

[01:13:55] There you go.

[01:13:56] Put that on eBay.

[01:13:57] I bet I'd go for like a couple hundred bucks.

[01:13:58] Did someone buy that when he made that 3D printout mold

[01:14:02] of the jinx head?

[01:14:03] Someone paid like a few hundred bucks for that?

[01:14:05] I'm telling you, right now everything is hot.

[01:14:07] I mean, one of the things I don't want to get into

[01:14:09] other discussion, but all, even everything is going up

[01:14:14] in craziness.

[01:14:15] I just sold, I won't say for how much,

[01:14:17] but I've been kind of like emptying out some of my extra

[01:14:21] duplicate parts.

[01:14:23] And it went in that sold in two hours, the entire box.

[01:14:27] Wow.

[01:14:28] Like everything in the box.

[01:14:30] I've been telling people, if you are considering

[01:14:33] buying a Magic Girl machine and you can get it

[01:14:36] for mid-20s, grab one.

[01:14:39] They're not going to go down.

[01:14:41] No, I don't think they'll stay.

[01:14:43] Well, as I said that, somewhere around, you know,

[01:14:45] our 20,000, 25,000, somewhere around there, just because

[01:14:48] of what it is.

[01:14:49] But it's kind of sucks though.

[01:14:51] A right and the only thing right now is until more

[01:14:53] reproduction parts are kind of cranked out on certain things.

[01:14:56] Certain types of parts are being challenging.

[01:15:00] So keep that in mind, collectors.

[01:15:02] If you're looking for a new game, whether it's in terms of

[01:15:05] being a use game, look real closely at what you're buying

[01:15:09] and make sure it doesn't have any broken assemblies

[01:15:11] and hard to find parts.

[01:15:13] Because right now things are starting to get stupid again.

[01:15:16] Like they didn't really 2000, like, Twilight's own clocks.

[01:15:19] I mean, that stuff went for absurd amounts of money.

[01:15:22] And now you're starting to see more of it again.

[01:15:24] People are putting up everything though.

[01:15:26] This is probably a good time to see what's available.

[01:15:29] That's true.

[01:15:30] But just be prepared to pay some of the price.

[01:15:32] It's a good time to be a seller.

[01:15:34] Oh, yeah.

[01:15:35] A good time.

[01:15:36] Yeah.

[01:15:37] All right.

[01:15:37] Well, Chris, thank you.

[01:15:38] Enjoy your weekend.

[01:15:40] And we'll talk to you real soon.

[01:15:42] Yippee-ki-ay.

[01:15:43] All right.

[01:15:44] I gave my leave with some money.

[01:15:48] Oh, yeah.

[01:15:49] I was good.

[01:15:50] Oh, yeah.

[01:15:51] I only came for the cake.
