[00:00] You're like the only one with mixed emotions.

[00:07] You're like the only shield of two darkness motions.

[00:30] Big shout out to Dwayne Cox who edited his pledge to $30.

[00:36] He is now the new Derek Stutzman.

[00:38] He has replaced Derek who took his ball and went home because I did not vote along his

[00:45] party lines, everybody.

[00:47] And look, it's hard to lose a best friend in life, let alone in pinball.

[00:51] So for those of you out there that are saying like, hey, just let it go, it's hard to just

[00:56] let it go when it's one of your best buddies.

[00:59] But you know why we love pinball and not politics is because it's much more fun to discuss what's

[01:06] going on in pinball.

[01:08] So here's what I want to talk about on this episode.

[01:10] I want to talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

[01:14] Can this game actually be a hit game for a stern pinball?

[01:19] We know they need it.

[01:21] X-Men is not doing tremendously well.

[01:23] A lot of people are staying away from X-Men because of code issues and mechanical issues.

[01:30] Metallica LEs, they did great, right?

[01:32] They sold all 500 Metallica remastered.

[01:35] They're now selling for $18,000 on the used market and people are getting that.

[01:40] It's not like they're listing it for $18,000 and getting $16,000, they're getting $18,000.

[01:46] But we haven't seen a stern LE really do that well in a long, long time.

[01:50] I think the last game that had such an increase in price right away was Godzilla LE.

[01:58] So here we are now, though.

[02:00] We know they don't have a Keith Elwynne game next.

[02:04] We know their next game is from Brian Eddy.

[02:06] Now Brian Eddy hasn't had a hit launch ever since he's been at stern pinball.

[02:13] He had Stranger Things, which remember when it came out, did not do that well.

[02:18] The game got much better over time.

[02:21] They didn't launch the game with the UV kit, which is crazy because they wanted us all to

[02:25] spend extra money to get the UV kit.

[02:28] Then he had Mandalorian, which had a lot of assets.

[02:32] Still an underwhelming game creatively.

[02:35] There's no real sort of exciting stuff happening on the gameplay of that game.

[02:39] And so now we await Brian Eddy's third game with stern pinball, the man you had, the medieval

[02:46] madness castle.

[02:48] And he's basically capable of designing a game that has the magic that he used to do

[02:53] back in the Bally Williams days.

[02:56] Now we know Keith Elwynne said he saw a game recently that had a mechanism in it that made

[03:01] him say, whoa, I can't believe we're doing that.

[03:04] That's insane.

[03:05] And it's probably not his own creation.

[03:08] So is this going to be Brian Eddy's Dungeons and Dragons?

[03:12] My worry about D&D is this.

[03:14] I'm just worried that it's not going to be the kind of theme that will justify the prices

[03:21] Stern is asking for all of these games.

[03:24] And will it be on spike three?

[03:26] Yes or no?

[03:27] This is the thing right now too.

[03:28] We know spike three is around the corner.

[03:31] So if a game comes out now and doesn't have spike three, are you really going to want

[03:37] it knowing that the new platform is right around the corner?

[03:41] Now we do know that spike three was supposed to be on this new Metallica game and they

[03:47] held it back because it wasn't ready yet.

[03:50] So I think we might get spike three with Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:57] Still, when I think about this from a theme standpoint, this game is not going to do tremendously

[04:04] well for Stern Pimble.

[04:06] I mean that.

[04:07] I just don't think this game is going to be a home run and I think it's going to be

[04:11] because of the theme.

[04:13] And if it is Dungeons and Dragons, what do you base it on?

[04:16] Is it going to be based on the D&D cartoon show from the 1980s?

[04:21] If history has shown us anything, Stern does not take those 80s cartoons and just serve

[04:27] them back up to us.

[04:28] They sort of reanimated themselves.

[04:31] So I don't know.

[04:32] I also don't think that cartoon show has nearly as much sort of nostalgia or enthusiasm for

[04:38] it as some other cartoon shows like Transformers and G.I. Joe and Voltron and Thundercats.

[04:46] Right.

[04:47] I mean D&D was always sort of much more niche and didn't have nearly as much of a fan following.

[04:55] And so I'm looking at this release with a little bit of concern for Stern Pimble.

[05:01] I think they need a hit game right now.

[05:03] I'm not sure they can weather another mediocre game, another soft seller.

[05:10] And at these prices, the thing that's really hurting them is that when you look at the second

[05:15] hand value of most of these new Stern machines, they're abysmal.

[05:20] They're absolutely abysmal.

[05:22] And then if the rumor is true, that Stern Pimble is about to raise prices.

[05:27] None of this adds up.

[05:28] How can you raise prices?

[05:31] Because your consumers are losing more money than they've ever lost before on every single

[05:35] pin.

[05:36] So I think something's got to give, right?

[05:38] And we know the only way out for Stern Pimble is simple.

[05:41] The only way out is if they make masterpiece games based on themes you really want.

[05:47] And you're not worried about the resale value of the game.

[05:50] And so I'm here to tell you right now, even though I haven't seen it, I think D&D is going

[05:54] to struggle to be a hit game for Stern Pimble.

[05:58] And also the other thing is this, knowing that it's D&D and knowing in just a few months

[06:03] we're going to get to see Harry Potter from Jersey Jack, it's hard not to just wait.

[06:09] The only reason to buy right away, the only reason to buy a new in-box game right away

[06:16] is if you feel it's going to be difficult to get an LE down the road.

[06:20] Other than that, there's really no reason why you would buy a new in-box game right

[06:26] away.

[06:27] And now starting to see Pimble manufacturers put games on sale for the first time ever.

[06:32] Jersey Jack had their Black Friday sale.

[06:35] They went down to IAPA and offered money off of those games as well.

[06:39] The moment you start doing that, the issue is this, you're telegraphing to everybody,

[06:44] you're about to buy a significantly depreciating item.

[06:48] And so the smart man is just going to wait and see.

[06:51] So I think here's what's going to happen with Stern Pimble.

[06:54] I think Stern Pimble is going to have a little bit of another flop with D&D.

[06:59] I think they're going to quickly get to Keith Elwin's King Kong.

[07:02] I think that game has been done for a while.

[07:05] And then I think they're going to relaunch Tron to coincide with all the Tron stuff Disney

[07:10] has in the works.

[07:11] I know John Borg's been working on a new Tron.

[07:14] It is still based on the old game, but I think he just wants to add more stuff to the mix.

[07:20] And I think that's going to be very exciting.

[07:23] I mean, a Tron with modern lighting, Daft Punk music, better artwork, and maybe a few

[07:30] more fun mechs thrown into the game.

[07:34] And with a big screen, remember, because the new Tron would be on Spike 3, which is going

[07:39] to have the much larger display.

[07:42] And with expression lighting and the fiber optic lighting, this game would be even more

[07:48] of a take my money now game than even Metallica remastered.

[07:53] And so I think that's going to be Stern's formula.

[07:55] And if I'm Seth Davis and I'm George, I mean, ultimately, it's seeming like the best way

[08:00] forward for Stern Pimbal to be successful and to grow and to get new people into the

[08:06] hobby.

[08:07] The best way forward is if they look backwards at all their hot titles.

[08:12] And you know, they're going to be thinking about Batman's 60th anniversary edition.

[08:17] They're going to be thinking about a Jaws 50th anniversary edition.

[08:21] And they have to be looking at games like Lord of the Rings.

[08:24] And oh my gosh, if we remade Lord of the Rings and just did it right, you're talking 5,000

[08:30] units easily if you remake Lord of the Rings.

[08:34] It's these new games to them that are really painful.

[08:37] I don't know how they're going to survive if they keep charging this much money for these

[08:42] games that really are not clicking with the buying community.

[08:46] You know, they put so much effort into Internet Connect, which is good.

[08:50] It's very satisfying.

[08:52] They put a lot of effort into achievements and making sure your games have replay value.

[08:58] Stern Pimbal machines still shoot the best.

[09:00] These games shoot better than everybody else's machines.

[09:03] But man, nothing's more painful than just losing a lot of money.

[09:07] And they have to figure out a way to stop the second hand value bloodbath that is happening

[09:13] to everybody that buys their product.

[09:16] And they haven't really made any moves.

[09:18] In my honest opinion, they haven't really made any moves to make the LEs really special.

[09:25] They still don't give you an exclusive topper.

[09:27] They don't even think about different artwork on the playfields.

[09:31] And they sure as heck don't give you more code in your LE machine.

[09:34] Those are three easy things they could do that would differentiate those $13,000 machines.

[09:41] Remember Jersey Jack gives you an exclusive topper with the CE.

[09:44] They give you different artwork on your CE game.

[09:47] They give you the radcals.

[09:49] They give you a lot more stuff so your CE looks leagues better than the model below it.

[09:54] Jersey Jack just should make one model.

[09:56] I mean, let's face it.

[09:57] They should just make one model, 1,500 units.

[10:00] It doesn't matter what game it is.

[10:02] It's $15,000 and then just go on to the next.

[10:05] So is anything going to happen over the next few weeks?

[10:08] Are we going to see D&D before the end of the year?

[10:11] I don't think so.

[10:13] I really don't think so.

[10:14] I don't think we see anything new from Stern.

[10:17] I don't think we see anything new from Jersey Jack.

[10:20] I don't think we see Cuphead this month.

[10:22] I just don't think we're going to see anything new.

[10:25] I think it's going to be a little bit of a dead month.

[10:27] And then things are really going to ramp up because we know leading into TPF,

[10:32] we're going to get Harry Potter.

[10:34] We're going to get the next game from AP, the next game from Stern.

[10:38] We're going to see Alice on the line has to be on the line.

[10:42] Dutch pinball knows they need to get that game on the line because all the orders for

[10:45] Lebowski are over.

[10:47] There's not going to be any more new Lebowski's made.

[10:50] And now I'm looking at Lebowski and heck, why would you spend 13-5 when I think you

[10:55] can kind of go get one now pretty easily for around $11,000?

[11:00] And so that game is now no longer in demand.

[11:03] I mean, it's been around for like 12 years.

[11:06] You know, the state of what back to the future will become is still up in the air.

[11:11] I'm not sure what's going to happen.

[11:13] I'm hearing Barry wants to make it on his own.

[11:16] I'm nervous now because this game, it just doesn't feel like this game is in

[11:21] development where it needs to be considering the theme, considering the

[11:26] expectations around it.

[11:28] So I'm nervous.

[11:29] And look, they need to get Alice is on the line because they need games going out

[11:34] the door. They need to get that revenue, right?

[11:36] They need to be able to knock on people's doors and say, hey,

[11:39] you now need to pay in full.

[11:41] And if you pay in full, you're going to get your game in a certain amount of time.

[11:45] And I'm a little bit nervous because they've never switched over a line ever before.

[11:51] And so we saw what happened with Haggis.

[11:54] And so they need to make sure that whatever they promise people,

[11:59] if you pay in full today, you're going to get your game.

[12:03] You're going to get your game on this date.

[12:05] They need to deliver on that.

[12:07] And will the tariffs happening in the world's impact games that are imported

[12:12] and built overseas?

[12:14] Most likely.

[12:15] So it's going to be very interesting to see what happens with that game.

[12:21] And I think all of us are sort of in a place now where we just want great games.

[12:29] We don't want to think about resale prices.

[12:32] We don't want to be moving games in and out of our homes.

[12:36] We don't want to be talking about quality issues on a brand new game like X-Men.

[12:42] We don't want to be tearing our games apart.

[12:45] We don't want to buy any Mirko playfields ever again.

[12:48] We just want more Godzilla's.

[12:51] We want another Tron.

[12:53] We want another Metallica.

[12:55] We want just great pinball because all pinball now is expensive.

[13:01] Then every game should be great.

[13:03] And the good news is imagine if you just got into this hobby this year,

[13:07] you'd have like 30 to 40 games that are absolutely amazing games.

[13:13] I mean, if you go on the pinside top 100 and you look at the top 30 games,

[13:17] most of those are readily available.

[13:20] They're available for less money than they were brand new.

[13:23] And you will have a great pinball experience.

[13:27] The problem is, is these companies can't survive.

[13:30] If all you want to buy is the old stuff.

[13:34] So they're going to have to find new ways to make it attractive to buy new

[13:39] and box games. I don't think they've done a good job of that.

[13:43] You know, Spooky Pinball did a great job launching Evil Dead.

[13:47] They sold over 650 in just a week.

[13:51] That is great.

[13:51] It now kind of makes no sense to get online after 650 because we all know

[13:58] by the time they make 400 of them,

[14:01] there's going to be a bunch of them for sale for less money than brand new.

[14:05] And if there's any issues with the game, they'll be worked out.

[14:09] Or if you know there's bad issues with the game, you'll just avoid it.

[14:12] So it only makes sense right now to wait and see how that plays out.

[14:16] But I will commend Spooky once again for a great launch.

[14:20] A lot of passion went into this game.

[14:22] I think people see the value in the game.

[14:25] I think people see the connection to the company as being part of that value.

[14:30] And when you buy a Spooky Pin, you feel like ingratiated into that Spooky culture

[14:36] and the community. And I think that means a lot for people.

[14:39] You know, when I think about this hobby in general, all of us, every time we wake up,

[14:44] we decide how we want to spend our time, how we want to spend our money,

[14:49] who we want to support.

[14:51] And with so many Pinball companies out there,

[14:54] I think the onus is on all of them to build stronger bridges to the community.

[15:00] And I think the days of like, well, we're not going to go on Pinside and engage with people.

[15:05] I think those days are over.

[15:07] I don't think you can just operate in the shadows anymore and people are going to buy your product.

[15:13] I don't think you can have social media channels that are not very transparent.

[15:17] You don't want to end up like Jersey Jack and you're just spamming everybody.

[15:21] All you do is spam everybody about what games you have for sale, as if we're confused.

[15:27] What game you have for sale.

[15:29] I mean, you literally are only making one new game at a time.

[15:32] We know the other games didn't sell.

[15:34] That's why nobody wants them and nobody wants to pay the prices they want for

[15:38] new and box like Godfathers or Toy Stories or Elton John.

[15:42] If anyone had half a brain, they would just go research what those games are selling for

[15:46] on the secondhand market and they're selling for three to four thousand dollars

[15:51] less than Jersey Jack wants to sell you one in a box.

[15:55] So we're at the end of the year.

[15:57] We are at the end of 2024.

[16:00] It's been one of the years where pinball has been the most expensive it's ever been.

[16:04] I think it was a little bit of an underwhelming year.

[16:07] I think the two games that stood out for me based upon people's feedback was Jaws,

[16:13] Pinball and Evil Dead.

[16:15] Those two games seem to have the most real enthusiasm around them.

[16:19] I think everything else is sort of just kind of come out and had its issues.

[16:24] Avatar was a flop.

[16:26] X-Men is one of the most creative designs Stern has ever done.

[16:29] But because of mechanical and code issues, it's kind of turning out to be a dud for people.

[16:35] I think everyone feels bad for Jack Danger.

[16:37] The game was rushed and it sure needed more time to bake.

[16:40] I don't think all the time in the world, though, would have made Weiss and code this

[16:44] game any better. I really don't. And for most of you, it doesn't mean you've had a

[16:49] bad year in pinball. You've loved the games you own.

[16:52] You know, you don't need many more.

[16:54] You know, I was thinking about this with Black Friday and all the consumerism

[16:58] that has taken over this country, this promise that you'll be happier if you just

[17:03] buy more, if you go further into debt and you put more items in your home,

[17:08] you're going to be happier.

[17:10] And I think the opposite is true.

[17:12] I think getting rid of more stuff will make you happier.

[17:15] I think having a smaller pinball collection will make you happier and make you

[17:19] appreciate the games you have.

[17:20] It'll actually make you play the games you have more often.

[17:24] And I think that's a good thing.

[17:25] And I think it's a good thing.

[17:27] And I think if we want these companies to be successful,

[17:30] they need to get better at theme selection.

[17:33] They need to put more magic under the glass.

[17:35] And they need to be more transparent.

[17:37] Again, the days are over.

[17:39] You can't just treat the community like we're suckers with money and anything you

[17:44] put in a box, we're going to buy.

[17:46] I think we're really going to push back, especially this year.

[17:49] And I think people are tired.

[17:51] They're tired.

[17:52] They're just tired of losing all this money and not getting dream themes.

[17:56] Everybody, thank you for being a member of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[17:59] We'll be back every week.

[18:00] We're going to still do this show.

[18:02] It's a lot of fun.

[18:02] There's a lot that's going to happen.

[18:04] Someone's going to make a move soon.

[18:06] I think there might be a surprise move by the end of the year.

[18:10] But there's always something to talk about in the pinball world,

[18:13] especially when you're in Canada.

[18:15] Everybody, have a great Monday.

[18:16] We'll talk to you soon.
