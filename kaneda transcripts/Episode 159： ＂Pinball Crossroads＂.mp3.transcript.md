[00:00] You're at a crossroads right now.

[00:24] Are we all sort of standing there in the middle of the road looking at the future of pinball

[00:29] wondering where does it go from here?

[00:32] And I think all of us wonder that.

[00:35] It's been an interesting past few years.

[00:38] We've had a lot of companies come out of the woodworks.

[00:43] Circa around 2013, 2014.

[00:47] When pinball started making its big resurgence and games were flying out the door at Stern

[00:53] Pinball, a lot of boutique companies jumped into the ring.

[00:57] They saw there was money to be made.

[00:59] They saw there were a lot of buyers out there that had a lot of money.

[01:04] That would buy a new-in-box machine after a new-in-box machine.

[01:08] And a lot of that boutique promise never really came to fruition.

[01:13] So here we are in 2017.

[01:16] There have been winners.

[01:17] There have been losers.

[01:19] There's been ups.

[01:20] There's been downs.

[01:22] There's been affordable games.

[01:24] There's been great buys.

[01:26] And there's been total cash grabs and rip-offs.

[01:29] And we've seen it all transpire.

[01:31] All of us, you and me, the people that love this hobby, the people that tune in to pinball

[01:36] on a weekly basis.

[01:38] And on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast, we're going to call it the pinball crossroads.

[01:43] I want to talk about my predictions where I see these companies going.

[01:46] I'm going to go down the list of all the companies that are out there.

[01:50] I want to give my next year or two prediction of where these companies are going to go.

[01:56] All right?

[01:57] And I have some user feedback that I want to read to that sort of dives into this.

[02:02] But before I do that, before I do that, I have to start this episode with my first time

[02:10] playing Star Wars Ellie.

[02:12] And I know I've been super down and out on this game.

[02:17] And I've been critical.

[02:19] And I've slammed Stern for releasing a Star Wars game with what I believe to be really

[02:28] lazy and uncreative theme integration.

[02:32] So all of that doesn't matter, right?

[02:35] Because I hadn't played the game yet.

[02:37] And so I went over to the most unlikely place on the planet to play Star Wars Ellie for

[02:44] the first time.

[02:45] I went to Bloomingdale's, the department store on, I believe it's on 59th Street and

[02:52] 3rd Avenue, which is just a few blocks from where I work.

[02:56] And I was able to see three pinball machines down in the men's section.

[03:01] And there's a no fear, a dialed in, and a Star Wars Ellie just sitting there with nobody

[03:07] on it.

[03:08] And I could play on free play over and over and over again.

[03:12] Which I thought was pretty awesome, right?

[03:13] How often do you get to play Star Wars Ellie on location over and over again without interference?

[03:19] I could hear the game perfectly.

[03:23] The game was set up nicely.

[03:25] Al set the game up.

[03:27] So it was all perfect.

[03:30] Okay.

[03:31] So what are my impressions of Star Wars Ellie?

[03:33] Did it change my mind?

[03:34] Did I feel like the game delivered more than I had originally anticipated?

[03:40] And I'm here to tell you, to all you who listen to this show, that I walked away from Star

[03:45] Wars Ellie.

[03:47] Absolutely 100% disappointed in the game.

[03:54] It actually reinforced for me everything I'd been saying about the game.

[04:00] And I'll explain why.

[04:02] First and foremost, number one, the game is so empty.

[04:06] It is so incredibly empty.

[04:09] There is an entire, like 80% of the play field with nothing on it.

[04:15] The whole middle has nothing on it.

[04:19] The game feels very empty.

[04:21] And you could say, well, that's how Steve Richie wants it because he wants it to be fast

[04:25] and he wants the game to have flow.

[04:27] The game sure does have speed and it sure does have flow.

[04:31] But I don't really care.

[04:33] I'd rather have so many more elements of the Star Wars universe inside that game than

[04:39] just have what we get.

[04:41] I think the theme integration is absolutely terrible.

[04:44] I really do.

[04:45] There's absolutely nothing satisfying to shoot at in the game.

[04:49] And that's my big issue.

[04:51] You know, I'm looking down at the game and I look at the Death Star.

[04:54] And first of all, it looks way too white.

[04:56] It doesn't even look like the right color.

[04:58] Look at it.

[04:59] That is not the Death Star Grey at all.

[05:02] It is, it looks white.

[05:04] It looks like a big egg there.

[05:06] OK.

[05:07] And so for me, what was really just so annoying is this, I played this game.

[05:11] I played this game for a half hour with nobody else around.

[05:15] I probably played about 10 to 15 games.

[05:18] Getting the ball into the Hyperloop never happened.

[05:22] I don't know how to do it.

[05:24] I don't know what I was doing wrong.

[05:26] But the fact that the major toy in the game, the major toy in the Ellie premium, the

[05:31] Hyperdrive, doesn't actually happen for most casual players, just who jump on it, is

[05:39] absolutely terrible.

[05:41] Absolutely terrible.

[05:42] There's no excuse for that.

[05:43] My other big, big issue with the game is that the major shot that you always want to

[05:48] hit, which is the Death Star shot, is so hard to hit.

[05:53] It is so tight.

[05:54] It's so awkwardly positioned that it's just a frustrating shot.

[05:58] It's not rewarding.

[05:59] It's never rewarding.

[06:01] When you do hit it, a lot of times the ball would just like trickle up and come back down.

[06:06] It's at this weird angle that is not smooth at all.

[06:10] That is not a good shot.

[06:11] It is a very, very clunky shot.

[06:14] So there you have the main shot in the game that you need to hit.

[06:19] Clunky.

[06:20] Clunky.

[06:21] So you want to tell me, Steve Richie is the king of design and king of flow.

[06:25] That is a clunky-ass shot.

[06:27] It doesn't feel smooth at all the way the shot in Game of Thrones does up that center

[06:32] ramp.

[06:33] It's very, very clunky.

[06:35] And I'm really disappointed that that shot is so poorly designed.

[06:40] And everything else that I believed about the game, the tie fighter on the spring, again,

[06:45] it's just all just so, so lazy and so cheaply put together.

[06:52] I would never own one.

[06:54] I would never own a Star Wars Ellie.

[06:56] I do not stand over that game and say $8,500 is there.

[07:02] The artwork, everything about it, it's just very underwhelming.

[07:07] The white team-olding just looks really weird.

[07:10] It doesn't go with the black of the armor.

[07:13] I would change that out.

[07:15] The artwork on the back glass is just really uninspiring and not that interesting.

[07:19] I will again say this, the cabinet artwork just doesn't do it for me.

[07:23] It's just so flat.

[07:25] It really looks flat, almost like a children's coloring book.

[07:29] It just doesn't have any depth or any emotion or any passion in any of the artwork.

[07:36] It's just flat.

[07:38] Which is so sad.

[07:40] How are we not at the gates of Stern with pitchforks being like, how could this be the Star

[07:46] Wars pen you give us?

[07:48] But the ultimate reason I think the game is just a total miss.

[07:52] An absolute miss is the software is such a complex, confusing mess.

[07:59] Absolute mess.

[08:00] I played for half hour.

[08:03] I played Star Wars for half hour.

[08:06] And I literally had no sense of what movie I was in, how I was supposed to progress through

[08:14] the game, like what is going on here?

[08:18] It is so strangely laid out with in terms of the way the code and the design of the physical

[08:24] game work together.

[08:26] I don't think they work together at all.

[08:28] I think there is such a disconnect between left brain, right brain in this game.

[08:34] It's almost like Dwight was given the game after it was designed and just told to do

[08:40] something with it.

[08:41] And he just poured it over the same sort of design approach from Game of Thrones.

[08:47] I really don't understand how you can fuck up making a Star Wars pinball machine so badly.

[08:54] How can you fuck up the player not feeling like he is progressing through the three iconic

[09:01] Star Wars movies that we all know so well that we are so familiar with?

[09:07] I think the big mistake, the biggest mistake they made is you should have selected when

[09:12] you forget selecting the way they do the modes with you know, Jedi training and this and

[09:17] that.

[09:18] It's like just too many things going on on the screen.

[09:20] They should have let you select the movie first.

[09:23] So I am playing a new hope first and the first things I need to do is get through the modes

[09:31] in a new hope.

[09:34] You can't make Star Wars.

[09:35] You just can't put all the iconic scenes from Star Wars into a blender the way they do

[09:40] in this game and expect you to come out feeling like you are immersed in those scenes

[09:46] in the movie.

[09:48] The movies are one of the greatest narratives of all time.

[09:52] You have to experience some of it in a little bit more of a connected fashion.

[09:58] And again, I just think it's a cluttered mess.

[10:01] It's an absolute cluttered mess.

[10:03] This game will go down as one of the worst theme integrations ever in pinball.

[10:09] It will be a game that will not be sought after.

[10:12] This is not going to be a classic great pinball machine by any means.

[10:16] And I am not the only one who feels this way.

[10:18] I think a lot of people feel this way.

[10:20] The only people that are still justifying this game are people that just want to like it.

[10:26] They want to like it so bad.

[10:28] Like even Beaselboob can't get over the fact that the game is just a brutal drain monster.

[10:32] That's not that much fun.

[10:34] And now he's like, oh now I know what Ghostbusters people are complaining about.

[10:37] It's not that much fun.

[10:39] It's not.

[10:40] Star Wars should blow you away.

[10:43] And this is such a half-assed sort of mediocre game.

[10:49] It really is.

[10:50] It really is.

[10:51] And I'm not just saying this to back up what I've been saying before.

[10:55] But I spent a lot of time on it.

[10:57] A lot of time on this game.

[10:59] And I came away just scratching my head that they thought this would be the best way to deliver

[11:04] Star Wars.

[11:05] You know, pinball shouldn't be so difficult to understand.

[11:10] Pinball shouldn't require a manual to figure out how to enjoy Star Wars pinball.

[11:15] So that's my freaking problem with the game.

[11:17] Is you need like someone there, you need like Yoda teaching you.

[11:21] You have to be like skilled in the ways of the forest to understand what the hell Dwight

[11:25] was trying to do in this game.

[11:28] And it's just a mess.

[11:30] It's an absolute mess.

[11:32] And there's absolutely nothing physically on the play field that's exciting.

[11:35] Tell me what is the ball do other than going up into the hyperdrive, which is

[11:40] hard to even figure out how to do that.

[11:42] What is the ball do in this game that is that exciting to watch?

[11:47] What?

[11:48] Nothing.

[11:49] Absolutely nothing.

[11:50] It just goes up, it comes down.

[11:51] It goes up, it comes down.

[11:52] That's Star Wars pinball.

[11:54] That's the best they could do with 30 plus years of pinball knowledge.

[11:59] That is the best stern pinball could do when making this 40th anniversary Star Wars game

[12:06] pathetic.

[12:08] It's a pathetic, pathetic game.

[12:11] All right, I'm moving on.

[12:12] All right, let's get back to our theme today, which is pinball crossroads.

[12:17] Where do we see these companies going over the next years?

[12:20] So what are my predictions for what's going to happen in the pinball hobby?

[12:25] All right?

[12:26] And I think it's a really interesting time.

[12:28] I think there's a lot of companies coming out with different products at different price

[12:34] points, with different themes, with different approaches.

[12:37] And if one thing is certain, there is one thing I'm absolutely certain on.

[12:41] They are not all going to make it.

[12:44] All right?

[12:45] They're not all going to make it.

[12:47] So let's start out.

[12:49] Let's go down a list.

[12:50] What I'm going to do here, and the easiest way for me to do this is actually I'm just going

[12:54] to go on Pinsider right now because they have all the manufacturers listed on the left

[13:01] column of Pinsider.

[13:02] So I can just go down and we'll go down the same way they have the list.

[13:06] It'll be easy.

[13:07] It'll be easy for me to follow.

[13:08] And it's also because I didn't do any show notes at the Saturday night.

[13:11] It's just me and Bubba hanging in the apartment tonight.

[13:15] All right.

[13:16] So let's see.

[13:18] The first relevant game manufacturer we have is Stern Pinball.

[13:23] So what is my prediction for Stern Pinball over the next year or so?

[13:28] So Stern will continue to dominate in terms of volume.

[13:32] All right?

[13:33] No denying that Stern will make the most amount of games.

[13:37] There is also no denying that Stern will get the best themes out of anybody.

[13:43] They are a licensing and manufacturing jug or not.

[13:48] Nobody has anywhere close the quality and caliber of themes that Stern Pinball has.

[13:56] You know, look at over the last couple years.

[13:59] Those busters, Tron, ACDC, Aerosmith, Metallica, The Walking Dead, Batman 66.

[14:11] Did I say those busters already?

[14:13] You know, we have Star Wars about to be Game of Thrones.

[14:17] Oh, no, no, no, sorry.

[14:18] About to be Guardians of the Galaxy.

[14:19] They Game of Thrones.

[14:21] It's ridiculous, right?

[14:22] And that's just, I'm even leaving out a lot of titles.

[14:26] You know, and Stern is just one after another.

[14:29] They're just the greatest themes out there they're making Pinball for.

[14:33] And I think that will continue.

[14:34] So if we look at what's coming, it's game of, sorry, Guardians of the Galaxy, probably

[14:40] Iron Maiden.

[14:41] We hear Deadpool.

[14:43] Will they come up with jaws?

[14:45] There's going to be another Kapow title coming out.

[14:48] Probably the monsters.

[14:50] So you know, it's, or here like maybe it's Willy Wonka, right?

[14:54] There's all these things that Stern will bring out that are huge, huge themes.

[15:01] But here's the thing.

[15:02] I think the crossroad for Stern is this.

[15:06] Stern does not give you games that are worth north of $6,500.

[15:13] Okay, to me, that is the most I would ever want to spend on the Stern machine.

[15:18] I just don't see the quality in what they charge for the premium or the LEs.

[15:24] I think the Stern pros are still the best buys in town.

[15:28] Remember, they're still cheaper than anything else anyone else is releasing.

[15:33] And they're, you know, for the most part, full featured games that are based on amazing

[15:38] themes and have probably the deepest code when it's finished, that's out there.

[15:45] So you can't deny that being able to go get an Aerosmith Pro for $5,200 isn't the

[15:50] best buy of the year.

[15:52] I mean, it's hard to deny that with that artwork and it's got the main toy box.

[15:58] And I think Aerosmith Pro is the buy of the year for sure.

[16:03] So but here's the thing with Stern.

[16:05] They now want to charge us increased prices.

[16:10] And I just think that people are going to stop running to buy every new unboxed Stern.

[16:16] They just are.

[16:17] And the tipping point or the turning point or the crossroad, the game that really is going

[16:24] to push people away from Stern is Star Wars.

[16:28] Star Wars was supposed to be the two year in the making amazing game that was going to

[16:34] show us what Stern was capable of and look at it.

[16:38] To Ghostbusters Ellie, Star Wars Ellie is pathetic.

[16:42] And I'm really starting to believe that a lot of what saved Stern recently have been

[16:49] these incredible artists.

[16:51] But a lot of it to me is lipstick on a pig, guys, until Stern shows me that they're going

[16:57] to go the extra mile in creating mechanisms, in creating innovation under the playfield,

[17:04] subways systems, lower playfields, upper playfields, like where is the creativity in that

[17:11] institution right now?

[17:13] And again, I'm really hard on them lately because for how big they are, for how many people

[17:19] they have and working for them who have been working in Pimball for decades, I think it's

[17:25] absolutely inexcusable that Stern isn't moving more towards a Valley Williams style of design

[17:33] and quality and manufacturing.

[17:36] They're going in the complete opposite direction.

[17:39] But yet they feel like they feel like we're stupid.

[17:42] They feel like we're all such idiots that they can charge us as much money as $8,000, $9,000

[17:52] for their product, $15,000 for the Batman SLE.

[17:57] See that's the thing.

[17:59] I think we all got raped by Stern recently with some of the prices and a lot of people

[18:07] went in and bought those titles who are now second-guessing them and are now wishing

[18:12] they would have held on to their money.

[18:15] So for Stern to really continue to dominate, it's not just going to be manufacturing, they're

[18:21] going to have to get the quality better.

[18:24] And I have yet to see a game that showed me that they put quality and premium elements

[18:32] into the game that match the price of the game.

[18:37] Right now they know that everyone else who's trying to do more is fumbling and stumbling

[18:41] and they're taking advantage of us because they know that everyone else out there has

[18:46] failed to deliver.

[18:47] I think Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of new predictions for Stern, Guardians of the

[18:52] Galaxy with Christopher Franchi and John Borg and Lonnie on code, I think my prediction

[18:58] is Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be a hit.

[19:03] Only if though they can get enough of the music from that film into the game because so much

[19:08] of what makes that movie awesome is the soundtrack.

[19:12] I also predict that it's going to have some great new mechanism in it that is going to be

[19:19] pretty cool.

[19:20] I hope so.

[19:23] And I think the art package is going to be phenomenal.

[19:25] I really do.

[19:27] And I think Guardians of the Galaxy, when showing it Expo, is going to make Star Wars look

[19:32] even shittier.

[19:33] I think we're going to see a lot of Star Wars up for sale when Game of Thrones.

[19:37] I keep saying Game of Thrones.

[19:38] I got the G.O. in my head and then I go to Game of Thrones.

[19:44] I think that Guardians is going to be the pin that we all want at Star Wars to be.

[19:50] I think ACDC premiums, the new ones coming out.

[19:54] You know what?

[19:55] They'll sell decently.

[19:56] I think there are so many ACDCs out there that I'm not sure there's that much demand for

[20:02] it.

[20:03] I think Iron Maiden is going to be delayed.

[20:06] Obviously with John Trudeau arrested for child pornography.

[20:10] And I think Stern is going to have a lot of competition.

[20:14] A lot of competition moving forward.

[20:17] But I still think Stern will be number one.

[20:20] I don't think anyone even comes close to putting a dent in their market share.

[20:24] I really don't.

[20:25] So it's like I'm glad Stern's around.

[20:29] I just wish Stern was making a better game.

[20:32] And that's my overall feeling on Stern right now.

[20:34] All right.

[20:35] Next on the list here is Jersey Jack Pimble.

[20:38] Now what do I think is going to be the future for Jersey Jacks?

[20:41] I think Jersey Jack is going to continue to sell dialed in.

[20:45] I think dialed in is a great game.

[20:48] I think it is the magic girl version of a Pat Lawler pin.

[20:56] This is Pat Lawler's magic girl.

[20:58] He spent years making it.

[21:00] No corners were cut.

[21:03] It's a complete opposite of a Stern machine.

[21:05] Instead of removing stuff out, it's like Jack let Pat put everything in and made the game

[21:10] exactly the way Pat wanted it to be.

[21:13] If you haven't played it yet, I think you'll enjoy it.

[21:16] It is a theme that is hard to fall in love with.

[21:19] I've played a lot of dialed in.

[21:21] And I really enjoy it as a pinball game.

[21:24] I just really feel like something is missing in terms of grabbing the emotional side of

[21:30] me.

[21:31] And I think it all has to do with the call outs and the way the game sort of speaks to

[21:36] you.

[21:37] I think the game physically speaks to you in a satisfying way.

[21:41] But then the personality of the game itself is lacking.

[21:46] And that's the only real weakness in dialed in for me.

[21:50] I think the collector's editions for $12,500 will not all sell out immediately.

[21:59] I think distributors who have a lot of them allocated are going to sit on those for

[22:05] a while.

[22:06] And my prediction is you're going to see dialed in Ellie's selling on the second hand

[22:11] market a lot in 2018 because people are going to play the game.

[22:15] They're going to enjoy it.

[22:17] They're going to beat it.

[22:18] But I think then they're going to want to move on.

[22:21] And so I think the price point for used dialed in is going to be probably somewhere around

[22:27] $6,500 for a standard edition, which no one's really going to want.

[22:32] The Ellie's is what you're going to want.

[22:35] The Ellie, which was $9,000 new, I think you're going to see a lot of them for closer to

[22:41] $7,000.

[22:42] I really do.

[22:43] I think people are going to start losing more money on second hand games because games

[22:48] will sit if you think you're going to sell your use game for just $500 or $1,000 less

[22:53] than you paid for it.

[22:55] Because there's just too many games out there that people are either going to go buy new

[23:00] or wait for the price to go down because there's just going to be a constant influx of games

[23:06] for sale.

[23:07] You know, be one thing if there's not that many dialed in Ellie's for sale or like, you

[23:11] know, how often does a really nice condition tails of the Arabian Knights come up for sale?

[23:16] Like not very often.

[23:18] But tons of dialed in Ellie's will come up for sale in really good condition and the

[23:23] lowest price will move the fastest.

[23:26] If Jack's next game is Pirates of the Caribbean, what do I think of that?

[23:31] Do I think it will be successful?

[23:33] I'm really worried.

[23:34] I'm really worried that it is the theme.

[23:36] I'm worried because I feel like Jack just can't get the theme right.

[23:43] He's always fighting a theme uphill battle and it doesn't make sense to me because he's

[23:48] got the financial backing now.

[23:51] I just don't think Pirates of the Caribbean is again at anybody wants, theme wise.

[23:58] I mean, I don't care how cool the pinball stuff is inside the game.

[24:02] I just think that Pirates of the Caribbean as a theme has dried up.

[24:07] The movie bombed.

[24:09] The movies are done with, you know, if this game was supposed to be Pirates, it's ill-conceived

[24:15] timing to have it come out a year after the movie bombed.

[24:20] I think people really want the next game from Jersey Jack, which is supposed to be toy

[24:24] story with Pat Lawler designing it.

[24:28] If Jack's model is one game every 16 months or something like that, I just don't know

[24:35] how Jack financially can deal with a flop.

[24:40] He has to make sure every game sells really well.

[24:44] I think because the Jersey Jack quality is so good, almost anything he releases will

[24:49] sell a thousand or two, which might just be all he needs to to keep going on to the next

[24:55] game, because Jersey Jack machines are the best modern day machines.

[25:01] There's no denying it.

[25:03] He's had issues, he's had problems, but when you put a Jersey Jack machine next to anything

[25:09] else on the market, it's almost laughable and embarrassing.

[25:12] How inferior other games look to a Jersey Jack machine.

[25:17] So for that, I think Jack will weather the Pirates of the Caribbean storm.

[25:23] If it's not a hit, I think the game after it will have been worked on too.

[25:27] I don't think he can accelerate game number.

[25:32] He should be game number five, if he has to, if game number four is not selling very

[25:37] well.

[25:38] I really wish Jack would just go get stuff like Blade Runner.

[25:43] I wish he would go get big trouble in little China.

[25:46] I wish he would go get goonies, go get gremlins, go get a new back to the future game.

[25:55] You literally nostalgia is everything right now.

[25:58] Looking back and looking at how successful Ghostbusters was, I really would look at the

[26:03] top movies that have nostalgic Paul with his audience and go all in on something that

[26:11] really people just crave.

[26:13] And I think that's the big issue.

[26:15] He's never had a theme that people crave.

[26:17] And I think he's going to see when he finally gets that theme right, his sales are going

[26:22] to quadruple.

[26:24] So hopefully we see that one day.

[26:26] All right.

[26:27] Next up on this list is Spooky Pimball.

[26:30] What do I think is Spooky Pimball?

[26:31] So Spooky Pimball is doing great.

[26:34] They are doing it right.

[26:36] They've done it the way you should do it, which is you build a company slowly, you take

[26:41] on as much as you can chew, and you grow.

[26:46] You make 150 games, then you make 300 games.

[26:49] Then you say you're going to make 500 games.

[26:51] Then you make multiple games at the same time because you can, because now you know how

[26:55] to do it.

[26:56] So Spooky is a company that has the biggest thing they have going for them is they have the

[27:03] love and admiration of the community.

[27:06] And that's an important thing.

[27:08] I think a lot of times, there's this sense that it doesn't matter if Stern ships all over

[27:13] people, people will just run back to Stern.

[27:17] But the reality is Spooky's got the goodwill.

[27:21] And goodwill goes a long way when you're in a boutique niche, hobby like Pimball.

[27:28] So that's going for them.

[27:30] I think total nuclear annihilation is going to sell in total 400 of them will sell.

[27:42] Which will make them pretty limited.

[27:43] I think people are going to enjoy them.

[27:47] I would say that people might get a little bored after six months, but almost every game

[27:53] gets boring after six months if you played a lot.

[27:56] I always love when people try to justify a new Pimball machine as being the best Pimball

[28:00] machine ever.

[28:01] And they always say stupid stuff.

[28:03] It's the game that got all the plays in my game room this weekend.

[28:07] That means Star Wars is great.

[28:08] No one else wanted to play Wizard of Oz.

[28:10] Everyone went right to Star Wars.

[28:12] It's like no shit Sherlock.

[28:14] It's your new $8,500 toy.

[28:18] Of course everyone's going to jump on it all weekend.

[28:21] It doesn't mean that it's better.

[28:23] It's just new.

[28:26] So well total nuclear annihilation.

[28:28] Be something that people want to keep for years.

[28:30] I don't know.

[28:31] I don't know.

[28:32] We'll see.

[28:33] It's different.

[28:34] I think it's meant for guys who have a lot of the same types of pin in their collection.

[28:40] And I think this is going to be a great game to break up the monotony.

[28:45] It's peanuts compared to what Stern will sell with a game.

[28:50] But this is a dream come true for Scott, Tennessee.

[28:53] And I think everyone in this small community couldn't feel happier for Scott because there

[29:01] was no nicer guy in this hobby than Scott.

[29:04] And so I think everyone's like rooting for him and happy to see that sales took off the

[29:07] way they did.

[29:08] I think it's great.

[29:10] I think Alice Cooper, on the other hand, is actually going to be a harder sell.

[29:17] And I think Alice Cooper is a questionable theme.

[29:20] I think Charlie and Spooky are making this game kind of for themselves.

[29:25] And they're going to hope that people are into it.

[29:29] The big question is this.

[29:31] Charlie himself has designed two games.

[29:34] And I think universally we could say that both of those designs were, you know, they left

[29:41] a lot to be desired.

[29:43] Let's just say it nicely like that.

[29:45] They weren't exactly the best pinball designs.

[29:50] And this is his chance to show, has he learned a lesson?

[29:56] And that lesson being you can't make just what you want to make.

[30:00] I mean, you could.

[30:01] You could.

[30:02] But eventually you have to make it.

[30:06] So it's half of what you want.

[30:09] But also half of what your customers want in terms of pinball.

[30:15] And so it's finding that balance between fan layout elements that we know people love.

[30:21] And then your own signature design items that become you.

[30:25] But right now I don't think Charlie sort of has like that signature design element that

[30:30] people are just in love with.

[30:32] You know, when you look at Stern designers, they all sort of bring their own flair to

[30:36] the table.

[30:37] And I think Charlie would be better off.

[30:41] I think he would be better off not designing games.

[30:45] I think he'd be better off taking on the role of Gary Stern and you know, running the company,

[30:50] managing the company.

[30:52] But I would hire someone with pinball design talent to take his company to the next level.

[30:59] Now again, this is just me and my feelings and you know, I'm the hobby.

[31:04] I think ego gets in the way of a lot of decision making in pinball.

[31:08] And this is not just with Charlie and then spooky.

[31:11] I think ego is what killed Star Wars pinball.

[31:13] I think Steve Richie's ego is what killed it.

[31:16] I think a lot of these guys, you know, because their names are on the playfields or their

[31:21] name is on, you know, they run the company.

[31:26] They want to take the reins because it's what they always dreamed of doing when they were,

[31:29] you know, when they were younger, like I would dream to be a pinball designer.

[31:35] The reality is not everybody's good at it.

[31:38] And if we look at Charlie's first two efforts, I think he'd be better off hiring someone

[31:43] to design his games or collaborate with him to make him a better designer.

[31:49] But I think his own attempts at designing, you know, they're not good enough.

[31:53] They're not good enough considering how competitive it is right now.

[31:58] And people can go, you know, buy a machine like an attack from Mars remake for just a little

[32:04] bit more than a spooky game.

[32:06] And it's one of the best design games ever.

[32:09] You need to up your game.

[32:11] You need to up your game.

[32:12] So I have absolutely no clue what will be out after Alice Cooper.

[32:18] My hunch is that spooky is not going to sell all 500 Alice Cooper's.

[32:22] I think that number's too big.

[32:25] Unless Alice Cooper comes out and blows this away, I just don't think it's going to do those

[32:30] numbers.

[32:31] My guesstimate is that they will sell around 350 Alice Cooper's, which is fine.

[32:40] I mean, Charlie said he'll make up to 500.

[32:42] If he doesn't sell that many, they'll just move on to another game.

[32:45] He's doing it right though.

[32:47] He'll never put himself in a position where he orders 500 parts for Alice Cooper pinball

[32:52] machines and sells 350 and is stuck with 150 parts.

[32:57] He is doing it right.

[32:59] And I applaud him.

[33:00] I applaud him.

[33:01] But like I think we have to be somewhat, you know, constructive criticism of spooky happens

[33:09] on this podcast.

[33:10] And I hope they don't take it personally.

[33:11] I mean, I want to see them get their games to a better place.

[33:15] You know, I didn't even talk about Jetsons or Domino's because I don't consider those

[33:20] to be like real pinball machines in the sense of like, I don't think anyone on Pinside.

[33:26] I don't think most people, like 95% of people who listen to this podcast, I know they're

[33:31] not in the market for either one of those machines.

[33:34] I think those machines were commissioned to be made, but I don't consider those machines

[33:38] to be sort of like the end product of like a labor of love.

[33:42] I think they were pinball at its most simple.

[33:47] They're machines that are designed to be simple and cheap to make and easy to produce.

[33:52] And they're not really full featured games.

[33:56] I just don't consider them that.

[33:58] So if you disagree, let me know about it.

[34:01] But I think most people would agree with that statement.

[34:03] All right, let's keep going on the list.

[34:06] Well, one thing I want to say though, someone said like, if there's a recession, spooky's

[34:09] going to go under.

[34:10] That's absolutely not the case.

[34:12] spooky is not going to go away simply because, again, Charlie's run his business wisely and

[34:19] he has a unique sort of situation with the rent and his facility and his workers.

[34:26] And I think he's going to do all right.

[34:28] I don't think he's going to go away if a recession hits.

[34:31] Look, I could be wrong.

[34:32] If a big recession hits all these companies could go under and everyone should be prepared

[34:36] for that.

[34:37] If you think Stern Pimball is immune to going under, if like a huge recession hits, you're

[34:41] absolutely wrong.

[34:42] It could easily collapse if the recession is huge and they have that huge factory and

[34:47] all those workers.

[34:49] They would just close up shop.

[34:50] They would close up shop.

[34:52] And then it could be a domino effect that all these guys would follow.

[34:55] All right, highway Pimball is next on my list.

[34:57] So as we know, there's a news item this week that the September 10th shipments of alien

[35:04] Pimball that we were promised that were supposed to arrive at CoinTaker will not be arriving

[35:10] on September 10th.

[35:13] It's at the point now where the only thing that would surprise me is if games actually did

[35:21] arrive.

[35:22] Right, I'm not surprised when they missed all these dates.

[35:27] It's what I expect.

[35:28] What I don't expect is one of these dates actually to come true and people actually get

[35:33] their alien Pimball machines.

[35:35] What I know has not happened is people who have a machine who are just waiting on parts

[35:40] still haven't received their parts.

[35:43] So my prediction for alien and highway Pimball is simple.

[35:47] And I've been saying it, I've been saying this for like almost over a year and a half

[35:51] now.

[35:52] I don't think highway Pimball is going to make it.

[35:55] I don't think they're going to survive for very long.

[35:59] I think they're going to get out maybe two to 500 alien Pimball machines.

[36:05] Maybe.

[36:06] I think they are going to quickly realize going into next year that this is a losing proposition

[36:14] that the company is so far on the red because of what Andrew did that they will never climb

[36:19] out of the hole.

[36:21] When they increase the price for all their machines, they basically cut their customer

[36:27] base in half.

[36:30] Now you have to couple that with the fact that this company has zero goodwill.

[36:36] People are fed up, tired and sick and actually hate these guys.

[36:40] They are extremely frustrated with this company.

[36:43] So this company has now raised prices, has taken all the elements out of the Ellie game,

[36:50] has yet to refund everybody, has delayed getting people their games when they said they would.

[36:58] They are going to be in for a rough, a rough 2017.

[37:05] And here's the big thing about alien.

[37:07] This is the elephant in the room.

[37:09] Is the game just not that good.

[37:11] The game looks great in terms of the light show and sounds great, but the game is not

[37:16] that good.

[37:17] It's a clunky mess and people have said it and more people will say it when guess what,

[37:25] more people get the games.

[37:26] The problem with alien has always been simple.

[37:29] It's the Andrew highway strategy was this.

[37:32] I will give the 20 or so games to people that I know will just cheerlead it.

[37:40] Meanwhile when the game went to shows and was clunky and not working well and had mechs

[37:45] disconnected, people just put their hands in their pockets, shrugged their shoulders and

[37:50] walked away and they didn't go on the forums and really articulate how disappointed they

[37:56] were because they didn't want to kick people when they were down because they knew a lot

[38:00] of the people had been waiting years and still had nothing.

[38:03] And so Andrew strategy was to give it to a bunch of cheerleaders, a bunch of cool aid

[38:07] drinkers like Hilton who we called out on the last episode.

[38:12] But the game isn't that great.

[38:14] It's wide body, it's floaty, it's just not a great game.

[38:20] It's not a terrible game, it's an okay game.

[38:23] But you can't just be an okay game with an okay art package based on a great theme

[38:30] and survive.

[38:32] There's just too many other options out there.

[38:35] It's just a shame that Star Wars and alien both got like mediocre pins based on these

[38:41] incredible themes.

[38:43] And so if you think that highway pinball is going to have game number three ready and

[38:49] going in 2018 early on, I think you're wrong.

[38:54] Yes sure, it's probably being worked on.

[38:56] But I just can't see these investors enjoying this for much longer.

[39:01] They're not going to enjoy it.

[39:03] They're not going to enjoy the delays.

[39:04] They're not going to enjoy the issues that happen if they ship out these games, they don't

[39:09] work perfectly and then all of a sudden, imagine if they have like something that needs

[39:13] to be redesigned or some quality control issue, why are these guys going to want to stick

[39:18] it out?

[39:19] These rich businessmen who can make money doing so many other things are going to just

[39:24] keep on trying to make pinball work for them.

[39:28] So I see highway pinball not making it through the end of 2018.

[39:34] That is my prediction.

[39:37] That is my prediction.

[39:38] Canated predicts that highway pinball will not survive past 2018.

[39:42] And speaking of companies that I don't think will survive past 2018, let's go on the

[39:47] Dutch pinball next.

[39:48] I'm jumping over.

[39:49] But my Dutch pinball, so we got another update Friday.

[39:53] We got an update that Yop had experienced a motorcycle accident.

[39:58] I hope he's okay.

[39:59] It seems like he is okay.

[40:01] The bike is not so okay.

[40:03] So he crashed his motorcycle and not much more of an update other than the parts are coming

[40:09] in.

[40:10] They hope to have a game assembled by October.

[40:14] And then they did something that once again, it's highway and Dutch.

[40:19] These guys are both doing the same exact thing together.

[40:24] They keep making the same mistakes.

[40:26] And that's why I just think both companies are going to keep failing.

[40:30] It's like the movie The Edge and the Marrow.

[40:33] It's just like Groundhog Day.

[40:35] It's like a new way to fail each day.

[40:37] They just keep waking up and each month they find new ways to fail all over again.

[40:42] They're in the same exact way.

[40:44] So they said that they think games are going to ship by December of 2017.

[40:49] And I'm just, I just want to pull my hair out because I'm like, why would you once again,

[40:54] when you haven't figured everything out yet, place the date in people's heads.

[40:59] Like we're on track to ship 2018 games in December of 2017 January 2018.

[41:07] Are you?

[41:08] Anything else is going to go wrong bearing up like no other unforeseen things will occur.

[41:13] Like ARA is not going to sue you once they realize what you're doing.

[41:17] There's going to be no issues with parts.

[41:20] And when you're remanufacturing these boards, have you quality tested everything?

[41:24] Have you put the new game through its paces?

[41:28] And you know everything's perfect?

[41:30] We know that in Pimbal, it only takes one critical part that needs to be redesigned

[41:37] and reordered even that could take months to get months.

[41:42] Not days or weeks.

[41:43] It could take months when you have the reengineering reorder part.

[41:47] So why would these guys put December in people's heads?

[41:49] The reason, I don't know.

[41:50] It's like they're giving refunds.

[41:52] Everyone's money is like locked with these guys.

[41:54] You're screwed.

[41:55] If you're, if you've paid for a big Lebowski with Dutch Pimbal, right now you're just screwed.

[42:01] You have to wait it out with them to see if you get your game.

[42:05] I still hope they make it.

[42:07] I just don't think they will.

[42:09] You know, I just don't think they will.

[42:12] And I think it's going to be another like long drawn out death that we are going to see

[42:20] with Dutch Pimbal heading into the next year.

[42:24] And there's no other title coming out from these guys.

[42:27] You're not going to see back to the future.

[42:28] Everyone keeps dreaming about that.

[42:30] You're not going to see.

[42:31] They've already said they're not doing the new Bob 2.0 anniversary edition.

[42:35] Whatever that thing was, that ill conceived stupid thing that showed a T-P-F.

[42:40] You're just not going to see anything else.

[42:42] And look, I feel bad.

[42:44] I feel bad.

[42:45] These guys, like they had something.

[42:47] They totally, totally fucked it up.

[42:50] And again, they're another company that people are frustrated with and people hate.

[42:54] And it's just, there's no room for, for, for that, this much forgiveness anymore in Pimbal.

[42:59] All right.

[43:00] What's next?

[43:01] We've got multi-morphics.

[43:05] So what is the future hold for multi-morphic?

[43:09] They're making them in batches of 25.

[43:13] It's, it's a game that is unique, that is different, that is trying something new, trying

[43:18] something innovative.

[43:21] But we've seen it for years.

[43:23] And until Jerry gets a theme that wakes up the platform, you know, I just don't think,

[43:30] you know, once he sells like maybe another batch, I think people are going to be like,

[43:34] are going to really hold out until they see the platform come to life with a theme that

[43:43] is great.

[43:44] I also think the, the platform itself needs to update a little bit, maybe a lot of it.

[43:51] And what I mean by that is, they need to figure out a way, you got a LCD screen.

[43:57] That's a size of a TV basically underneath the play field.

[44:00] And then you've got graphics that look like they're 16 bit.

[44:05] I don't, I don't get it.

[44:08] Like he needs to figure out a way to make that space just look like you're looking at an

[44:14] HD image with graphics over it.

[44:17] Like it really needs to be better sort of developed for.

[44:23] All right.

[44:24] And I know it's expensive.

[44:25] I know it's probably hard because no one's really done it before.

[44:28] I'm also just, I'm not sure like there's going to be this third party support where like

[44:32] all these people are going to design an engineer, swappable games to put into the platform.

[44:39] That only works if the platform's got a huge user base.

[44:44] And the only way you get a huge user base in the world of stuff like video games and whatnot

[44:49] is you sell at a lower price, at a loss just to get it in people's homes.

[44:55] The problem is, I don't, you know, $10,000, your customer base is tiny.

[45:03] And on top of that, you got a tiny customer base to begin with.

[45:07] You're then only giving them Lexi lightspeed, you know, the Canon Lagoon game.

[45:16] You're not giving them like a theme that would draw people in.

[45:21] So I think it's going to be difficult for Jerry.

[45:25] He knows this.

[45:26] He knows all of this.

[45:27] Like I'm not saying anything new.

[45:28] I'm not saying anything that's shocking or provocative.

[45:32] I just think multi-morphic.

[45:34] I'm just making a guess here, but a lot of this has got to be self-financed.

[45:41] And when you sell finance a company, I mean you can go as long as your pockets are deep.

[45:47] And there's a lot of, you know, people who are spending a lot of their own money to try

[45:51] and make their pinball ventures work.

[45:55] And you know, in a world like that, you could stick it out for, look, if Jerry was a billionaire,

[46:02] he could do it for 50 years and it wouldn't matter.

[46:05] All right, there's plenty of people out there who have hobbies and projects that they spend

[46:10] their whole lives doing because they can financially afford to do it.

[46:14] But do I think consumers will be running to buy?

[46:17] Not until the theme is there, okay?

[46:20] All right, Chicago Gaming, PPS, these guys are on fire in Fuego.

[46:25] I think this company is going to be the one Stern is probably the most worried about.

[46:31] And I'll tell you why because these guys, they know how to manufacture.

[46:35] They know how to manufacture.

[46:37] They've been building quality parts for a really long time.

[46:41] Now they're keeping those quality parts to themselves and in-house.

[46:46] I think these guys have a, you know, they're making Stern worry too because they have access

[46:52] to the library of some of the best games ever.

[46:56] And games that people have a hard time finding.

[46:59] So like if they go and make Monster Bash affordable with all new parts and do it in a way,

[47:06] they did.

[47:07] Imagine a Monster Bash Ellie that is dressed up the way Attack from Mars Remake is dressed

[47:13] up.

[47:14] You start to make, they're making all the right improvements with these games where they

[47:18] feel like a little bit of a modern twist on the old classic you love, but it's still the

[47:24] old classic you love.

[47:25] I think this company is the one Stern is probably the most worried about.

[47:30] And I think, you know, they're going to be on a roll.

[47:33] I think Monster Bash will be the next game followed by Cactus Canyon.

[47:38] I think if you have the originals of these games, you're going to get fucked.

[47:41] You're going to get fucked.

[47:42] There's no way around it.

[47:43] Don't give me this.

[47:44] People would rather they own the original.

[47:45] It's not a Shelby Cobra.

[47:47] The originality thing doesn't play so much.

[47:49] It really doesn't.

[47:50] It really does.

[47:51] I'd rather have the new one with the nicer trim and nicer topper and the mirror blades

[47:55] and new lights and all this stuff.

[47:58] New boards would rather, you know, what I think they should do.

[48:03] I also think if they wanted to, they could really get like new artists to sort of make

[48:09] some of those older art packages that weren't the best to make them even better.

[48:12] The Monster Bash Playfield art is kind of shit.

[48:15] Imagine if they actually spruced it up a little bit and made it even cooler and have

[48:21] the amazing guy like Brian Allen do Monster Bash Playfield art and Cabin Art.

[48:27] I think that would be a huge win.

[48:29] All right, let's keep going.

[48:32] Bootique Pimple.

[48:33] So, home pin is one that I haven't talked about much and we're going to hear a lot about

[48:39] home pin soon.

[48:40] I don't know why because my friends Martin and Ryan over at Head to Head Pimple, the Australian

[48:48] Pimple podcast that I love that's every Monday, they interviewed Mike from Home Pin.

[48:52] So you're going to be able to hear everything Mike has to say about his company.

[48:57] I know these guys ask like two pages of questions and they're going to ask all the questions

[49:02] that we all have about Thunderbirds and Home Pin.

[49:05] I really look forward to that interview.

[49:08] I know you guys who don't listen to that show, you should, it's Head to Head Pimple, it's

[49:12] every Monday, it's Martin and Ryan and these guys, they have a really good dialogue with

[49:18] Pimple.

[49:19] It is my go to other Pimple podcast.

[49:24] Nate doesn't podcast enough.

[49:25] I wish Nate would podcast more but I also think, you know, Nate always delivers quality

[49:32] unlike me.

[49:33] I'm just like all quantity with very little quality, right?

[49:35] Now, come on.

[49:36] I know you guys love this show.

[49:37] So Home Pin is one that, you know, Ryan, I'll tell you, I Facebook chat Ryan all the time

[49:45] and I'm always down on Home Pin's decisions.

[49:48] I'm always like, what the hell is Mike doing?

[49:50] Like why is Mike going into other threads and talking smack when he hasn't delivered shit?

[49:54] Why didn't Mike patent the, or patent the lighted decals for Pimple machines?

[50:01] Like that was stupid not to do that.

[50:02] We're going to get those answers on Head to Head Pimple on Monday.

[50:05] I might just, I was telling Ryan.

[50:07] I might just, I might just like re-air their show on my channel.

[50:10] I can't get all the, get all the listens.

[50:15] But Thunderbirds is clearly not a theme for most people.

[50:19] It is for the Australian market.

[50:20] But I'll say this from what I saw and there's a video on their Facebook page of Thunderbirds.

[50:26] It looks freaking cool.

[50:28] It looks colorful.

[50:29] It looks like it's jam packed with stuff.

[50:31] I'm going to go on a limb and say this right now and I think this is going to be accurate.

[50:35] You're going to see Thunderbirds with more stuff on that plate deal than Star Wars

[50:39] LE.

[50:40] I tell you right now, Thunderbirds for the money it's going to be is going to make you really

[50:46] think twice about Storm Pimple.

[50:49] It's going to make, it's going to make you feel embarrassed to buy Star Wars LE when

[50:54] you see Thunderbirds.

[50:56] Mark my words.

[50:58] He is going to show you what we all know.

[51:01] But Storm has been cutting corners and is leaving stuff out.

[51:04] It's not as expensive as Storm wants us to believe to actually engineer mechanisms and

[51:12] put toys in games and these things are expensive.

[51:15] These things aren't a thousand or two thousand dollars.

[51:19] I think Thunderbirds is like, oh man, it's like I think it would be, I kind of want to

[51:26] say I think it's going to do well.

[51:28] I think it's going to sell to the people that understand the show.

[51:30] I don't think it's going to sell well outside of people who know the theme.

[51:35] I also think the orange dots to me are just the Achilles heel of the whole thing.

[51:40] And I've been telling Ryan this.

[51:41] I think it's absolutely idiotic in 2017 to go through all the work of making a Pimple

[51:49] company from the ground up designing ever single part from the ground up.

[51:52] You do all that work and then you put orange dots in a machine that is like 20, 30-year-old

[52:01] technology.

[52:02] You're stuck with a 30-year-old technology display when you're building a modern Pimple

[52:08] company.

[52:09] That's called fucking idiotic.

[52:13] Idiotic.

[52:15] That is like putting in a modern car now.

[52:18] In a modern car, automated seat belts.

[52:22] Okay, it's like putting in a modern car.

[52:25] No ABS brakes.

[52:26] It's the same thing.

[52:28] Like, let's just leave out.

[52:31] And it's not even expensive.

[52:34] LCD screens are so freaking cheap.

[52:37] It's unbelievable.

[52:39] And I don't know what the future holds.

[52:42] I know that Mike makes other stuff other than Pimple and that other stuff brings in revenue.

[52:48] So he's not only making Pimple machines.

[52:50] His factory cranks out other things.

[52:52] I think home pin, I do think Thunderbirds is going to be a little bit like dead on arrival.

[52:58] I just do because of the theme.

[52:59] I mean, how many people in Australia are going to buy it?

[53:02] Is there enough marketplace there?

[53:04] How can you make a game?

[53:06] How can you make your inaugural game?

[53:08] Not a theme that anyone in America, the number one Pimple market wants.

[53:14] I'm also nervous about a company in China making Pimple.

[53:17] I just don't know if he's ever going to be able to break through.

[53:21] If he's only interested in servicing like Australia and Europe, I don't know what is,

[53:26] I don't know what market research this guy's done.

[53:29] I hope that Mike grows up and matures a little bit.

[53:32] And by that, I mean, Mike, stay out of other people's threads.

[53:36] You are now the leader of Home Pin Pimple.

[53:39] You are the president, founder, and CEO of your own company.

[53:44] You're behaving like a child when you go into other threads.

[53:47] And I think Mike really needs to understand that why go in and lose customers?

[53:54] It is marketing suicide to be the leader of a company that goes out and shoots off from

[54:00] the hip and becomes like belligerent with people that are his potential customers.

[54:05] That will just be a surefire way to go out of business.

[54:08] So I think he needs to sort of grow up a little bit and start to assume the role of a leader

[54:14] and an owner of a company and out of Pimple fanboy that just wants to talk smack.

[54:19] I don't know what game number two is for Home Pin.

[54:24] I think that it's going to be interesting to see how they sell Thunderbirds.

[54:30] I don't think it's going to sell that many.

[54:31] I would say probably 500 Thunderbirds get made before he goes on to the next title.

[54:38] All right.

[54:39] Who am I missing?

[54:40] American Pimple.

[54:41] And then I got to go to bed.

[54:42] I'm tired.

[54:43] Hopefully I didn't leave anyone else out.

[54:45] American Pimple.

[54:46] Who Dini?

[54:47] Last but not least.

[54:48] Who Dini?

[54:49] American Pimple is an enigma to me.

[54:52] They really are.

[54:54] Someone over there stood over magic and said this game is ready to ship out.

[54:58] So someone over there doesn't really know Pimple very well.

[55:01] But we got Joe Balls or who knows Pimple very well.

[55:04] We got Josh Kugler who knows how to code Pimple machines.

[55:07] I think this game is going to be well received.

[55:11] I still wish they would have used the Matt Andrews art package.

[55:16] That's just me.

[55:17] I know they want to go for a more realistic version of who Dini.

[55:21] But that was their decision.

[55:24] Steam Punk's not my favorite look.

[55:25] But the game doesn't look terrible.

[55:27] I think at its price point, it's going to be competitive.

[55:33] I don't know if they're going to be able to manufacture them that fast.

[55:38] They should be coming out any month now.

[55:40] And who Dini is a universal theme?

[55:45] I think it's a great theme for Pimple.

[55:46] It's got to kill John Papaduke that there is a who Dini machine coming out that's not

[55:50] his because it was like his favorite theme.

[55:53] It's the theme he always wanted to make.

[55:56] So I know he must be pretty bitter about that.

[55:59] And so I think that this game is...

[56:04] I think by the time it comes out though, I think they showed it too early.

[56:09] And I think by showing it earlier, really incomplete, it's going to make it harder for

[56:14] them to pull the sheet off it and get people excited again about the elements of the game.

[56:18] And I think that was pretty questionable marketing because by the time they're going to want

[56:25] to start taking real orders and people's real money, I think people are going to be staring

[56:29] at gardens of the galaxy.

[56:32] And I think it's going to be hard to make that game sort of more in demand than a theme

[56:41] as popular as guardians.

[56:43] You know who Dini is like what, like, 80 years old and guardians is like the hot sci-fi title

[56:50] now.

[56:51] So I think that American Pimple will survive past who Dini.

[56:57] I'm not sure what they're working on next.

[56:59] I'm no clue.

[57:01] But I think it's going to be challenging now.

[57:06] We're going to find out if they're hearts are in it because if this game comes out and

[57:11] does and fly off the shelves, will they look at the numbers and say it's just not worth

[57:16] it.

[57:17] Let's go on to something else.

[57:18] Because remember, this whole company was designed around working with John Papaduke.

[57:22] It really was.

[57:23] Like they really...

[57:25] They built their company around J-POP.

[57:27] Now they have to rebuild their company around J-POP.

[57:31] But they're going to get a shot at it.

[57:33] Like look, everyone gets a shot at Pimple's success.

[57:36] The only issue is there's a lot of real good games, new inbox that people can go by.

[57:44] So it's either go bigger, go home.

[57:46] It's games have to be great or don't even bother.

[57:49] There's no room anymore for mediocrity and Pimple.

[57:52] There just isn't.

[57:54] People should just either go buy old games for a good price and skip out on all the

[57:58] new inbox craziness unless the games are great.

[58:01] And that's why we love following what's going on with all these companies because we

[58:06] do want there to be great new Pimple.

[58:10] We want every new inbox game to be considered a classic, a game that's a keeper, a game

[58:15] that's never leaving my collection, a game that's fun to put some mods on, a game that

[58:20] just brings a joy and smile to your face every time you turn it on.

[58:24] Star Wars is not going to be that game.

[58:26] It's not going to be a classic.

[58:27] Aerosmith probably won't be Batman 66.

[58:33] I don't think it's going to get there.

[58:35] I wanted it too.

[58:36] I also think because Batman wasn't a fully original designed game.

[58:40] It was like a re-themed, half-game redesign.

[58:44] That really hurt making it a classic.

[58:47] That is not the way they would have designed Batman 66 from the ground up.

[58:51] I think the last classic game, the one that people years from now are going to go back

[58:56] and say, yeah, it's going to be your Metallica's and your walking deads and your trunks.

[59:03] Those are going to be the ones lower the rings.

[59:06] Simpsons Pimple party.

[59:07] There's certain Pimple machines that just elevate themselves over the others.

[59:14] I think Lebowski would have been that one that everyone would have wanted and been a classic

[59:19] and been a game that never left people's game rooms.

[59:25] Zidware games would have been that way if they had actually materialized.

[59:31] Dialed in, it's curious to me because I think Jack's games, even though the quality's

[59:36] there, even though the quality's there, I just don't know of his games right now.

[59:43] The games are like, I want to keep him play these forever.

[59:46] Do they have that intangible element to them?

[59:51] Are they the themes you want to hold on to forever?

[59:55] That's Jack's final hurdle.

[59:58] Is can he make a game that's his great and worth keeping for decades the way people

[01:00:06] hold on to for decades, Twilight Zone, medieval madness, Adams family?

[01:00:11] Dialed in maybe.

[01:00:13] But I think because of the theme, it's not going to have that same sort of retention that

[01:00:19] we see from other pat-lalder games where the themes are also why people keep them.

[01:00:25] Because remember, fun house, road show, you know, path other games, still not as like

[01:00:33] desirable as Adams family, Twilight Zone.

[01:00:37] All right.

[01:00:39] This has been episode 159 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[01:00:43] I've talked myself into a complete state of sleep.

[01:00:48] Bubba is on the couch, so adorable.

[01:00:50] He's got his arms crossed and he's just snoring away.

[01:00:53] I hope you enjoyed this podcast.

[01:00:55] Remember to check out Head to Head Pinball tomorrow to hear Mike from Home Pin.

[01:01:00] As always, enjoy your pinball machines.

[01:01:04] Don't worry about preserving them too much.

[01:01:07] And it's just pinball.

[01:01:09] Our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody in Florida.

[01:01:12] If you have family members in Florida, our thoughts and prayers go out to them.

[01:01:16] I hope everyone was able to evacuate and be safe.

[01:01:20] I was just in St. Martin a few weeks ago and it's beautiful weather.

[01:01:24] It was just in Miami and it was beautiful.

[01:01:27] The world is getting hit with some terrible news.

[01:01:31] We have this little bit of the world that we enjoy and it's called pinball.

[01:01:36] As much as we critique and talk about it and as much as I'm disappointed in Star Wars,

[01:01:42] I'm still just happy like pinball exists in a world that delivers us so many bad blows

[01:01:49] one after another.

[01:01:51] So just remember that when you're fighting each other on pinside and you're getting

[01:01:57] really overly angry about the hobby that it's sort of one of the joys of the world.

[01:02:04] It's not worth getting too heated over.

[01:02:07] Have a good night and we'll talk to you soon.
