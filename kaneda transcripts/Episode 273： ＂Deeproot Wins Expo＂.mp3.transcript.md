[00:00] Oh I must have been a dreamer, keep my mind low

[00:04] And I must have been someone else

[00:08] And we should have been all about that

[00:12] Oh, you say?

[00:14] Oh, oh, oh

[00:16] I have to say I think I was wrong about Pinball Expo 2018

[00:28] We got a lot of stuff coming from that show this year

[00:31] And so for those of you who went, it looks like you had a really really good time in Chicago

[00:36] We're going to do a recap of Pinball Expo 2018 on episode 273 of Canatus Pinball Podcast

[00:43] We're going to talk a lot about Deep Root Pinball on this podcast

[00:49] I am going to give my thoughts about their seminar

[00:53] I've actually also grabbed what I think are the most important sound bites from their seminar

[01:00] We're going to discuss everything they said

[01:02] Because there's a lot, there's a lot that they're saying in that our seminar that they gave

[01:08] I'm also going to talk about Mike Tyson and how it was really awesome to see Mike Tyson make a surprise appearance at Pinball Expo 2018

[01:17] And he was actually in the Deep Root seminar

[01:21] And I'm not sure if you saw him, but I'm going to air the clip of Mike Tyson there

[01:25] Which is completely incredible that we're getting someone of his caliber into Pinball

[01:31] And they say Pinball is not growing, okay?

[01:34] Before we talk about Deep Root and I want to sort of end this show talking primarily about them

[01:39] Let's just go down a recap of how I think everybody did at Pinball Expo 2018

[01:47] And what I think the next steps are going to be from these companies, right?

[01:50] Can we do that real quick?

[01:51] All right, let's jump right in

[01:52] So, number one, American Pinball October Fest

[01:56] So this was the big reveal

[01:58] This was the big reveal of the show

[01:59] And I think a lot of people were looking forward to seeing what would be next from American Pinball

[02:05] And we saw this Thursday night

[02:07] And there was a lot of conversation, a lot of response, a lot of feedback to what we saw with October Fest

[02:14] And I think we sort of hit the nail on the head a little bit that the overall feeling is a little bit of a mixed bag

[02:20] And I think there is some work to be done in terms of the artwork and the animations on this game

[02:26] You know, I have one question for everybody out there

[02:28] If Stern Pinball revealed a Pinball machine with this art package, what would the response be?

[02:35] Right? People would probably burn Stern Pinball down to the ground

[02:39] And it's not like it's that bad

[02:41] But the problem now in Pinball is that artwork has become so good

[02:47] That you really can't ask people to buy a game

[02:51] Where the artwork will be probably, you know, one of the most permanent items in the game

[02:57] Right? Artwork and design will not change after you buy it

[03:00] And I think we heard loud and clear from everyone out there

[03:04] We just want the art to be as good as it can be

[03:08] And I think these guys are lucky that they got a lot of really good feedback

[03:11] And so we'll see what they do with the artwork on the play field

[03:15] And I think even that is more important than the animations

[03:18] Because they can always fix those later on

[03:21] But the artwork is permanent and it needs to be addressed

[03:25] And I hope they address it

[03:26] All right, so I applaud the game design

[03:29] I think Balser continues to give us completely original thinking and fun new designs

[03:35] That are not the same old cookie cutter fan layouts

[03:39] So I think everyone feels that way about the game

[03:42] I also still walk away thinking that it's going to be a very tough game to sell

[03:47] And I've said this from the very beginning

[03:49] If you think theme doesn't matter, you're absolutely wrong

[03:53] Theme does matter a lot

[03:54] Now I still think people will buy original IPs and fun themes

[03:59] But this one is a hard one

[04:01] This isn't a festival in America that is widely embraced

[04:05] And it's just sort of difficult for people

[04:10] With everything going on in the pinball world

[04:13] To say this is it

[04:15] This is where I'm going to spend $7,500

[04:18] Okay, there is so much out there

[04:20] And there's so much going on

[04:22] And we're going to hear this when we talk about deep route

[04:24] But there's almost like this climate now

[04:27] Where you kind of are going to be gun shy

[04:30] Until you are absolutely sure this is the game you want to own

[04:33] And I think when I see distributors saying

[04:36] Place your order now for October Fest

[04:38] It's really kind of weird to me

[04:40] It's like pretty premature

[04:41] I think this worked to be done in this game

[04:43] I really do

[04:43] I don't think there is any reason why

[04:46] You would buy this game right now

[04:48] And I think that's the other challenge with these companies

[04:51] Where if there is no LE fear of missing out

[04:55] Why wouldn't you just wait

[04:56] We know they're going to be making

[04:58] October Fest for a year or two

[05:01] So there's absolutely no reason to buy it now

[05:03] And I think that culture of buy it now in pinball

[05:06] Is really fading away fast

[05:09] And without it, this is the crazy part

[05:10] When you remove that hype train

[05:13] And that fear of missing out

[05:15] The only way for your company to succeed then

[05:18] Is to give people the total package

[05:21] So that on day one

[05:23] They just really want to have the game

[05:25] They're not really concerned about

[05:26] Collectibility in this and that and resale

[05:29] They just don't see anything they don't like

[05:32] All they see is something they want to buy now

[05:34] And I kind of like the fact that we're moving

[05:36] Towards that environment

[05:38] All right, speaking of a company who knows how to create that though

[05:41] A company that knows how to get you to say

[05:43] Take my money now

[05:44] A company that has thrived

[05:47] On creating an environment of fear of missing out

[05:50] Stern pinball

[05:51] And Stern pinball really didn't do anything at Expo this year

[05:55] There was no new news from Stern

[05:57] There was some new code updates

[05:59] But for the most part

[06:01] I do think it kind of sucks

[06:03] That the world's biggest pinball manufacturer

[06:06] Who is also located in Chicago

[06:10] Doesn't bring anything new to the show itself

[06:15] And that sucks

[06:17] It really does suck

[06:18] Because we know we're going to see

[06:20] The monsters in a couple weeks

[06:22] And we're going to get the reveal

[06:24] And it's going to be the typical media outlet

[06:28] IGN

[06:29] This and that

[06:30] They could have at least

[06:31] Just announced what we already know

[06:34] You know how silly is it

[06:36] That John Borg on Facebook

[06:38] Actually announces that monsters is next

[06:41] And it's coming out mid-November

[06:43] And we all know that

[06:44] And yet

[06:45] Only the diehard geeks that are at the show

[06:49] Like we're the only ones that even care about this stuff

[06:52] You couldn't just give them

[06:55] Confirmation or give them something to chew on

[06:58] And get excited over

[07:00] And I just think that sucks

[07:01] I think it sucks

[07:02] I really don't care

[07:03] To hear Stern go up there and talk for four hours about games

[07:06] That have been out

[07:07] That games that they've already talked about

[07:09] They've been interviewing a million times

[07:11] By every other podcast about these games

[07:14] Nothing new to hear

[07:15] So that was Stern Pimball's

[07:18] Sort of presence

[07:20] At Pimball Expo

[07:21] Jersey Jack Pimball

[07:23] Pired to the Caribbean

[07:25] It's starting to ship

[07:27] I feel like I say that every single week

[07:29] Pired to the Caribbean is starting to ship

[07:31] It's like a broken record

[07:33] But I saw that Jack made a video that Eric Katz's game

[07:38] Is no longer a European game

[07:39] It's actually his game

[07:40] And it's going on a truck to Eric's house

[07:44] So congratulations

[07:46] You know look, hype around this game

[07:48] It's...

[07:49] I don't hear anyone talking about it

[07:51] The way they used to

[07:52] I think it's amazing what a difference a year makes

[07:55] I don't want to go on about this game

[07:57] I hope you guys who order it

[07:58] Get it soon

[07:59] I hope you guys who are curious

[08:01] Get to play it soon

[08:02] At a barcade or a friend's house near you

[08:06] Every time I go on to the thread

[08:08] Of the people who play it

[08:09] It's always the same thing with this game

[08:11] It's like the game is awesome

[08:12] The game is amazing

[08:13] The game is so simple to play

[08:15] It's so much fun

[08:16] And then they're like

[08:16] Here's what you gotta do

[08:17] And then they write paragraphs

[08:19] About how you have to figure the game out

[08:20] And I'm like

[08:21] Oh my god

[08:22] Face Palm moment

[08:23] See this is exactly what I'm talking about

[08:26] I think that pires the Caribbean

[08:28] We'll go down

[08:30] As probably

[08:32] The worst selling Jersey Jack pinball machine

[08:35] To date

[08:36] And I think it will struggle

[08:38] Big time

[08:39] To even sell as many as dialed in

[08:42] I don't think it'll ever reach the level of the hobbit

[08:45] I think people are going to pass

[08:48] On this title

[08:50] It's because they don't want the theme

[08:52] And it's because we all know

[08:55] That toy story guns and roses

[08:57] And Willy Wonka are right around the corner from JJP

[09:00] I think this game is going to go down

[09:01] As like

[09:02] It was revealed too early

[09:04] It wasn't a theme you wanted

[09:06] And Keith went crazy on the code

[09:08] And made it complex chess game

[09:09] Instead of pinball

[09:11] And even though homeowners will say

[09:13] What a great game it is

[09:14] I think the enthusiasm to own this game

[09:18] Has sailed away

[09:20] No pun intended

[09:22] And you know I saw

[09:24] Hilton and Crazy Levy

[09:25] Arguing on Pinside about dialed in

[09:29] And Hilton is like

[09:30] Dialed in is a great game

[09:31] Like it's sales are going up

[09:33] And Hilton

[09:35] You're not

[09:37] Well in the head my friend

[09:38] Even Jack

[09:40] Even Jack released the numbers

[09:41] Dialed in is the worst selling Jersey Jack pinball machine

[09:45] By far

[09:46] Okay

[09:47] And you really have to

[09:49] Consider dialed in to be a complete

[09:51] And utter failure for the company

[09:53] And here is why

[09:55] Jack gave Pat Lawler

[09:57] Five years a blank check

[09:59] He got to make the game he wanted to make

[10:01] Without any restrictions

[10:03] Without any

[10:05] Limitations

[10:06] And he delivered dialed in

[10:08] Now Pat Lawler is a God

[10:11] In the pinball world

[10:12] You would Jack probably thought

[10:15] That if Wizard of Oz could sell me

[10:16] Three four thousand units

[10:18] If Hobbit could sell me

[10:19] Two thousand twenty five hundred units

[10:21] That Pat Lawler is much

[10:23] Anticipated return to pinball

[10:25] Would sell me five to seven thousand units

[10:28] Instead it's like what like

[10:30] 1214 hundred at most

[10:32] And now that there are so many dialed in

[10:35] Going up for sale

[10:37] Mint games going up for sale

[10:39] On the used market

[10:41] It's done

[10:42] It's absolutely done

[10:44] This is where like orders just

[10:46] Dry up so quickly

[10:48] On these games

[10:49] Because you can go get one

[10:51] For so cheap

[10:52] Why would you go buy a new one

[10:54] It's like the Hobbit

[10:55] Why would anyone buy a black arrow edition

[10:57] For eighty five hundred

[10:59] When they can go get a used

[11:01] Smog Ali for like six to sixty five hundred

[11:04] You can spend two thousand more

[11:05] When you can go buy like the same exact game

[11:08] But you know maybe I'm wrong

[11:09] You know Hilton went into two bars

[11:11] In Wisconsin

[11:12] And saw the game there

[11:14] And saw people playing it

[11:15] So because of that focus group of two

[11:18] Hilton has

[11:19] Jumped to the conclusion

[11:20] That dialed in is a hugely successful game

[11:23] And sales are going through the roof

[11:25] So you know maybe he's right

[11:27] That he's really a smart guy

[11:29] All right so let's go on to spooky

[11:31] Spooky Pimble at the show

[11:34] You know it's Charlie and Scott and E.C. went up there and talked

[11:37] You know not much new from spooky here

[11:38] We all knew that spooky sort of

[11:40] Had his big reveal at T.P.F.

[11:42] With Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[11:44] I think that

[11:46] You know there's nothing really much to talk about

[11:48] Scott and E.C.

[11:49] He teased his game too

[11:51] As being Scott and E.C.'s haunted house

[11:54] That's totally bullshit

[11:55] There's no way that's the title

[11:57] The game Scott is totally trolling everybody

[11:59] He's going to keep trolling the community

[12:01] About what his next title is with spooky

[12:05] And you know that's going to be that

[12:07] He's got a good sense of humor

[12:09] I actually think people are more excited to see

[12:10] What's next from Scott and E.C.

[12:12] Than they are to see what's next from Chuck

[12:15] And as I said it before like

[12:18] Chuck should just let Scott design his games

[12:21] That's what I would do

[12:22] Or hire another designer

[12:24] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[12:26] The delay for it

[12:28] Is pretty interesting

[12:29] You know it's like

[12:30] It's a weird

[12:31] It's a weird like

[12:33] Economy around that game

[12:34] Where it doesn't matter

[12:36] People are locked in

[12:37] People committed to wanting it

[12:38] And I've said it before

[12:39] I think a lot of people

[12:42] Committed to wanting this game

[12:43] Before ever playing it

[12:45] And I think most of that is just

[12:46] The support Chuck and Co

[12:48] And either you know

[12:50] Or you're like a diehard Alice Cooper fan

[12:53] Whatever your reasons were

[12:54] For going in on this game

[12:55] Without ever playing it

[12:57] You know I think you could be

[13:00] Disappoint it

[13:02] Simply because you might have to wait

[13:03] A really really long time

[13:05] And there might be a lot of other games

[13:07] Coming out

[13:07] That you might want instead

[13:09] And we're going to see this

[13:11] When we talk about Deeproot

[13:12] I mean

[13:13] How many games are coming out in 2019

[13:15] Because it sounds like

[13:16] Shit ton if you believe everything they're saying

[13:18] All right

[13:19] So let's go on now next to Chicago gaming company

[13:22] Monster Bash remake

[13:23] Everyone considers it to be great

[13:25] I've heard nothing but amazing things about the title

[13:27] So congrats on getting that game

[13:29] Finally out the door

[13:31] It's amazing to you how quickly though

[13:33] I think hype just sort of

[13:35] Leaves the building on a game that is just a remake

[13:38] Right

[13:38] And you're not going to have a new experience playing this game

[13:41] It's the same game

[13:42] I don't think there's going to be any rush

[13:44] To have to get one of the LEDs at 1250

[13:48] They will not sell out

[13:50] There will still be Monster Bash remakes

[13:52] LEDs for sale a year from now

[13:54] New unbox that you can go buy from a distributor

[13:57] So again the climate is shifting

[13:59] We're all feeling it

[14:01] It's this

[14:01] See it's softening in this sense

[14:03] Like you are no longer going to see

[14:06] Take my money now immediate sellouts of games

[14:08] You know and

[14:09] You know when Stern releases monsters

[14:13] You know is it going to sell out immediately

[14:15] I mean I just don't see people being that anxious anymore

[14:21] Because of the cadence and the amount of titles coming out

[14:25] I think people are going to wait

[14:26] Why rush?

[14:27] Why rush it?

[14:28] I mean look it almost takes Stern like two years

[14:31] To finish the code on some of these games

[14:33] And so you're in a biogame

[14:35] And you're just going to wait and wait and wait for it to be done

[14:37] I don't know

[14:38] I don't know

[14:39] All right one other thing that I want to talk all about deeproot

[14:42] This is going to be primarily deep roots podcast

[14:46] The black and white twilight zone

[14:48] Did you guys see that at the show absolutely incredible

[14:51] Absolutely phenomenal job

[14:54] Creating that game

[14:55] It looks like your eyes are fooling you

[14:59] When you look at that game amongst all the colorful games next to it

[15:03] I inquired about how much they would sell that game for

[15:06] You know what they told me

[15:08] They said they're not accepting any offers yet

[15:11] But they rejected in offer to buy that game

[15:15] Or maybe not even rejected

[15:17] But they received an offer to buy the game

[15:19] For 35,000 dollars

[15:22] 35 grand someone want to pay for it

[15:25] For I mean it is kind of like a one-off

[15:27] Twilight zone that took hours and hours and hours to do

[15:32] But here's the thing

[15:32] Once you do all that work

[15:33] Once you do all of it

[15:35] It's not as hard to do it again the second time

[15:38] But you know see to me that's what I would like to see

[15:41] A company say hey we're going to make 25 black and white

[15:43] Twilight zone additions

[15:45] They're like 20,000 dollars each

[15:47] Place your order now

[15:49] Why not?

[15:50] I think they would sell them

[15:51] And it's such a unique work of art

[15:53] I mean when you start doing stuff like that

[15:55] You solely are making a work of art based on a classic pinball machine

[15:58] All right

[16:00] Let's talk about deeproot

[16:02] Because if you didn't hear

[16:05] The deeproot seminar

[16:07] On what was it?

[16:08] Friday night or Saturday?

[16:10] Maybe with Saturday

[16:12] I think you really are going to be in for a treat on this podcast

[16:16] Because what I've done

[16:18] After listening to it all

[16:20] I listen to it all

[16:21] And you know I'm friends with Robert

[16:23] And I talk to Robert

[16:24] And I've said before on this podcast

[16:26] There is only one pinball company

[16:30] That really has me curious

[16:32] And fully excited about what they're going to do

[16:35] And that's deeproot

[16:36] And the reason why I say that

[16:38] Is because I think for the most part

[16:41] We all know what to expect from the other manufacturers

[16:44] We know the next turn is going to be

[16:47] Like kind of just another stern

[16:48] Right?

[16:49] They're not...

[16:49] You're never going to get a stern pinball machine

[16:52] That ever looks like it's worth $9,000

[16:54] You're never going to get there

[16:55] Ever, ever, ever

[16:57] We know they know were fools

[17:00] We know that

[17:00] We...

[17:01] Let me repeat that

[17:02] We all know

[17:03] That stern knows

[17:04] That we are suckers

[17:06] Okay?

[17:06] We have to admit that reality

[17:09] That we will buy a $9,000 pinball machine

[17:12] That has different stickers

[17:13] And it's basically the same game as like a $5,500 machine

[17:17] All right?

[17:17] So that means we're suckers

[17:18] Okay?

[17:19] We know

[17:20] That Jersey Jack pinball

[17:22] Will try so hard

[17:25] To put so much into games

[17:27] And to like bring you know

[17:28] Valley Williams error pinball back

[17:31] We know Jack has this mission

[17:33] And creates these

[17:34] You know magical games

[17:35] But he always sort of finds new ways to mistomark

[17:39] We know that

[17:39] We know that he can't seem to ever just get it right

[17:42] That it always is like

[17:44] Something comes up way short

[17:46] But his games do feel like they're worth the money though

[17:49] Okay?

[17:49] But we're Jack falls down

[17:52] Is none of the games are like

[17:53] You know, you don't have that like sort of like emotional bond

[17:56] Or connection or giddiness

[17:57] When you jump on them

[17:59] And it's just you know

[18:00] It's just like what new way will Jack find to fuck up a game

[18:04] That's kind of like how I feel at this point

[18:06] Um spooky games are spooky games

[18:08] Like they just feel like a level above

[18:11] Sort of basic homebrew pinball

[18:14] That is you know manufactured to a certain number

[18:17] But they're not

[18:19] It's nothing happening in a spooky game

[18:21] Feels like it's anything we haven't seen before in pinball right

[18:24] It doesn't

[18:25] None of it feels like that innovative

[18:27] And it's like it's like innovative for them

[18:29] But not innovative for the industry

[18:31] Okay?

[18:32] P3 tried way too hard to reinvent

[18:35] So many aspects of pinball

[18:37] And we know that consumers are just not biting on it

[18:39] Right?

[18:40] What else?

[18:41] I think Dutch pinball and highway gone

[18:43] Right?

[18:44] I'm not even going to talk about them

[18:45] So when you look at the pinball landscape

[18:47] And you want to ask yourself

[18:50] Who's got me curious

[18:51] Who's trying to really change the game at this point

[18:53] You know who's trying to change the game

[18:56] In a new way that hasn't like proven to me that they can't do it

[19:00] Well look

[19:01] Deep root pinball is in a really interesting position

[19:05] And simply because they're selling us one thing right now

[19:09] They're selling us on hype

[19:12] And they're selling maybe

[19:13] I'm going to list more than one thing

[19:15] But they're really selling us a company

[19:17] That has yet to even make one game

[19:20] But they are selling us on their passion

[19:24] They're selling us on like their collaboration

[19:26] They are making so many bold statements and promises

[19:30] About what they're going to do to the pinball industry

[19:34] That literally

[19:36] Literally

[19:37] I walk away after hearing everything they say

[19:40] With only two emotions

[19:41] Okay

[19:42] One emotion is

[19:43] These guys are full of shit

[19:45] Like they're full of shit

[19:46] They're crazy

[19:47] All the things are saying

[19:49] They have to be full of shit

[19:50] Right?

[19:51] The other emotion I have

[19:53] Is

[19:54] Wow

[19:55] I think they're going to do it

[19:57] Like they sound like they're doing something absolutely magical

[20:00] That we've all been waiting for in pinball

[20:03] And in my head

[20:05] I have those two emotions

[20:06] Sort of competing with each other

[20:08] Like which one is it

[20:10] And it's not even like I feel like there's a middle ground

[20:13] It's like they're either going to fucking knock it out of the park

[20:16] Or they're going to be the biggest laughing stock

[20:20] Of the pinball world in 2019

[20:22] Now

[20:23] I tend to believe the latter

[20:26] I think there has to be something going on over there

[20:29] That has got all these people

[20:31] Working there

[20:32] Saying what they're saying

[20:34] And committed to this thing

[20:36] And what I want to do on this podcast is

[20:38] I want to play for you

[20:40] Sound clips from the deep root seminar

[20:43] And I want you to just listen to it

[20:44] I've strung them all together

[20:46] So you're going to listen to about five minutes of

[20:49] What this company is promising you

[20:51] And promising to do to the pinball industry

[20:55] And look there's a lot of hyperbole here

[20:58] There's a lot of extreme promises

[21:01] There's a lot of

[21:02] You know I almost would say like

[21:05] In an exaggerated way

[21:07] To make proclamations about pinball

[21:11] I mean they're talking everything from

[21:13] You know we're going to change the game

[21:15] We're going to change the narrative

[21:16] So you're going to get games that are story driven

[21:19] You're going to get mechs like you've never seen before

[21:21] You're going to get code like you've never seen before

[21:23] We're doing stuff that's never been done before

[21:26] And you're going to have all this

[21:27] And we're going to you know in March

[21:29] And we're going to ship more games in this year

[21:31] And we're going to do this

[21:32] And we're going to do that

[21:32] And I want you

[21:33] You know when you hear all this

[21:35] To just absorb it all

[21:37] Okay absorb it all

[21:38] And then I want to give my opinion

[21:40] About what all of this means

[21:43] Right and what can it mean for the pinball industry

[21:46] Before I do that

[21:47] I did think it was funny

[21:49] That when they introduced their designers

[21:52] This is what it was like

[21:54] When deeproot and robber took the stage

[21:56] And he introduced his team

[21:58] Because we knew we were going to get

[22:01] The return of a man that is

[22:04] You know we thought we would never see from again

[22:07] And that is John Papa Jr

[22:09] You know it is kind of crazy that J-pop

[22:11] After all he's been through

[22:14] After everything he's done

[22:15] After all the money he took from people

[22:17] After all the money he lost

[22:19] After all the failed promises

[22:21] Listening to him talk about pinball

[22:23] At pinball expo

[22:25] 2018

[22:27] Is kind of incredible

[22:29] The fact that he should have gone extinct

[22:33] Right we all feel that way

[22:35] How did he not go extinct

[22:36] How is he still around

[22:40] So the words he says are also very interesting

[22:43] And I'll say this

[22:44] I'll say this

[22:46] I think the reception he got

[22:48] Spoke volumes

[22:50] About what you guys felt

[22:53] About his return to pinball

[22:55] And when you listen to this clip

[22:57] The actual introductions

[22:59] And applause that everyone else got

[23:01] Is accurate

[23:02] I literally edited down a little bit

[23:04] But those are the

[23:06] Accurate feelings the crowd had

[23:08] And then when it went to J-pop

[23:11] It was something like this

[23:12] Listen everyone

[23:13] Well I'm Barry Osler

[23:14] And

[23:18] So I'm Quinn Johnson

[23:28] My name is John Norris

[23:36] I'm Dennis Nordman

[23:38] And I've been designing games

[23:40] On and Off for

[23:41] Well, last 30 years I guess

[23:48] My name is Stephen Bowden

[23:50] And I've been a pinball league

[23:52] In tournament players since 2004

[24:00] My name is John Papa Duke

[24:08] You did it

[24:09] You hit the mother love

[24:11] You saw these cypher

[24:12] A million with your own eyes

[24:14] And it's right there just inches away

[24:18] I'm just making it a whole team

[24:21] I think you

[24:24] You're the first to

[24:26] So we're working

[24:28] So there was complete silence

[24:30] After John Papa Duke announced himself

[24:33] And we're not surprised by that

[24:34] We're not surprised by that

[24:35] Okay

[24:36] So from then on

[24:38] There was an hour long seminar

[24:40] Where Robert Mueller was moderating

[24:42] And asking his team different questions

[24:44] And I'll say this

[24:45] When you hear all of this together now

[24:48] It is pretty

[24:49] It is pretty incredible

[24:52] What these guys are claiming

[24:53] They're going to do to pinball

[24:54] And I want to just play this for you

[24:56] So take a listen

[24:57] To Canada's greatest sound clips

[25:00] From the deep root

[25:02] Pinball Expo 2018 seminar

[25:04] And when we're done with this

[25:05] We're going to come back

[25:06] And we're going to analyze

[25:07] Some of the things these guys

[25:08] Are saying they're going to do in pinball

[25:10] We have some of the most amazing talents

[25:12] People coming from feature films

[25:15] Coming from AAA video games

[25:17] They're going to blow your socks off

[25:19] With the quality of

[25:21] Sort of the video and animation

[25:23] Audio

[25:24] That we're going to be doing

[25:24] I have no place here really

[25:26] I grew up loving video games

[25:27] And not pinball

[25:29] I have nothing to do with pinball

[25:30] Nothing to do with manufacturing

[25:32] What's been going on here

[25:34] Just got this jersey boy

[25:35] To move down to San Antonio

[25:37] And it's the best this year

[25:38] And I've ever made I think

[25:39] And so I think the stuff

[25:40] That we're putting together

[25:41] Is stuff that no one's

[25:42] It's kind of stuff that people have never seen before

[25:44] With pinball and so it's going to be super exciting

[25:47] So part of the problem is

[25:48] You can't work on a game for four years

[25:50] And not finish it

[25:51] You have to finish it in a reasonable amount of time

[25:54] Cut it off

[25:55] Move forward

[25:56] Take all those extra ideas

[25:58] And put them on the next game

[25:59] And the next game

[26:00] And kind of keep it going

[26:01] Because people don't want to wait

[26:02] Like five years for game

[26:03] It's just, you know

[26:04] It needs to be done

[26:06] In a more finite thing

[26:07] So

[26:08] You're a smart motherfucker

[26:09] That's right

[26:10] How has deeper changed the way

[26:11] That you design for pinball

[26:14] I don't get to stay on for snow days anymore

[26:16] What we're doing

[26:23] And the new design

[26:24] And a lot of new technology

[26:26] And things coming forth

[26:27] That's never been done in pinball before

[26:29] I don't think

[26:30] The pinball world's ever seen

[26:31] A roll set designer yet

[26:33] The level that Steve has come in

[26:35] And just pounded things out

[26:36] We came up with a new type of a diverter system

[26:39] That kind of has been done

[26:41] Roberts letting us

[26:43] Do whatever we want

[26:44] And our games

[26:45] Up to a point he hasn't told me yet

[26:47] I can't put something in

[26:48] So I mean

[26:49] My first game is really loaded with cool stuff

[26:52] I don't know how much might come out of it in the future

[26:54] But right now it's pretty interesting

[26:56] Awesome as things about working with deeper

[26:58] It is that we are

[27:00] Breaking a lot of molds

[27:01] And we're shifting a lot of paradigms

[27:03] And so it's opening up

[27:06] Whole

[27:06] I mean the way I look at it

[27:07] It's opening up a whole new era

[27:09] I guess you could say

[27:10] I know that sounds super dramatic

[27:11] But I mean it's

[27:12] It's being opening up a whole new era of

[27:14] What pinball now

[27:16] Can become

[27:17] And so it opens up so many new avenues

[27:19] For for these pinball games to be

[27:22] Really amazing

[27:23] Awesome experiences that were never possible before

[27:26] Get ready

[27:27] That's awesome

[27:28] This is pretty cool

[27:29] Like the gig that we got going

[27:31] And people kind of don't have any idea

[27:34] TPF and March

[27:35] We're going to have some amazing things

[27:37] So

[27:37] I think each one of the designers

[27:39] Has put a lot of effort

[27:41] Without any thought to cost

[27:44] Or complexity into a lot of different

[27:47] A lot of different mix

[27:49] I know the famous one for

[27:51] For John Papaduke is

[27:53] Shipping out magic girls

[27:54] Without the ball floating in midair

[27:56] And it might seem like an easy thing to do

[27:59] But it's never been done before in pinball

[28:00] Because it's almost impossible to do

[28:02] Trust us

[28:03] Until deeper got their hands on it

[28:05] And I'm very very happy to say

[28:07] That we have a very good solution to that

[28:09] And it's really good

[28:11] But it's no different

[28:12] Than each one of the other designers

[28:15] I think each one of the games now

[28:16] Has something never done before in pinball

[28:18] And I will say

[28:19] I'll add to that about prices

[28:21] We would love to get prices lower

[28:23] Than any pinball company has ever done

[28:25] But with more quality

[28:27] And toys in it

[28:28] Than any pinball company has ever done

[28:30] Yes

[28:30] We will release more titles

[28:31] In 2019

[28:32] Than any pinball company in history

[28:34] In fact, we'll also release more

[28:36] Than most of the entire industry released in one year

[28:40] Given any given year so

[28:42] Stay tuned

[28:43] I'm not worried whether something is very profitable

[28:45] Or not on a on a partital basis

[28:48] The way we've designed everything internally

[28:50] Is that any pinball machine sold will be profitable

[28:53] So I think I can't

[28:55] I don't

[28:56] My brain doesn't work

[28:58] I know highway kind of run the two weeks

[29:00] Quote before I even knew that was quote

[29:02] But our goal is still to be able to

[29:05] Sell a game and get it to a customer in two weeks or less

[29:08] Follows our ethos

[29:10] That we want to be able to mount

[29:11] And manufacture as much as possible in a two weeks

[29:14] In two weeks

[29:15] In two weeks

[29:16] In two weeks

[29:17] In two weeks

[29:18] In two weeks

[29:20] In two weeks

[29:21] In two weeks

[29:26] Deep root is going to make it

[29:27] And we're going to surprise you with some cool stuff

[29:30] And

[29:30] Doing a lot of cool things

[29:31] I've never been done

[29:32] I've probably never even thought of

[29:35] I don't know about y'all but I live breathed pinball

[29:38] Despite running 17 other businesses

[29:39] I live breathed pinball 24-7

[29:42] I can't get it out of my mind and it's a curse

[29:44] And I know a lot of the people here

[29:47] Back at the two offices that we have

[29:51] Have the same curse

[29:52] And we're coming up with some of the craziest

[29:54] Zaniest things ever

[29:55] And then making them reality

[29:57] I would love to see our machines last 50 to 100 years

[30:00] As some are

[30:01] I don't think we've underestimated anything yet

[30:03] But we're going to have the same problems every new manufacturer has

[30:06] And getting a line up and going

[30:07] We're going to have a lot of successes

[30:08] We're going to have some challenges

[30:09] And we're going to work through them

[30:11] I think what's really helped us a lot is that

[30:13] We've been talking about them

[30:15] For the beginning from years

[30:17] And while it's a different thing

[30:18] And planning as best as you can

[30:20] To actually start manufacturing

[30:21] Where we're still things are going to pop up

[30:23] That you can't even imagine

[30:24] Or think of beforehand

[30:26] I think that

[30:28] We've got some great talent

[30:30] In our engineering and technician department

[30:31] And come rain or shine

[30:35] When we get to March

[30:36] People are going to be able to buy pinball machines

[30:38] From Deep Root and put them in their home

[30:40] And we're going to try and make the best game games you can

[30:42] So come March get ready to buy them

[30:45] Yeah, I have similar feelings

[30:47] I'm just thankful to Robert and Deep Root

[30:49] For allowing me to do two original themes

[30:52] Which is something I've wanted to do for years and years

[30:55] And years some really happy to be able to be doing that

[30:58] Get ready

[31:02] A applause

[31:04] A applause

[31:05] A applause

[31:06] People are clapping for a company

[31:09] That has never shipped a game

[31:11] That has self-inmittedly

[31:14] Never manufactured a single thing around pinball ever

[31:18] That has not shown us a single mechanism

[31:21] That has not shown us a single piece of artwork

[31:24] That has no distributor base

[31:26] That has no sales model in place

[31:28] That has absolutely done nothing

[31:32] But talk about what they're going to do

[31:35] And yet people were clapping

[31:37] And that is the phenomenon of modern pinball marketing

[31:42] Is you literally you get credit before credit is due

[31:47] And look we've seen this many many times before

[31:51] But

[31:52] But here is the difference

[31:54] And here is why I can't

[31:57] I can't sit here on this show

[32:00] And tell you even after hearing all of that

[32:02] We're going to talk about all that stuff

[32:04] I still can't really tell you that I think these guys are full of shit

[32:09] And here's why

[32:10] All right but you know here's why because

[32:12] Steve Boutin

[32:14] Like he's a really credible dude

[32:17] He's a really credible dude

[32:18] And he like moved all the way from New Jersey

[32:21] To Texas

[32:23] And he is basically telling everybody

[32:27] Get ready

[32:28] Like why would Steve do that

[32:31] Why

[32:33] Like he he has such a reputation

[32:36] And so much credibility in this hobby

[32:39] That Steve Boutin would never do that

[32:41] John Norris

[32:43] Why would he get up there

[32:45] And say how passionate he is

[32:47] And how

[32:48] Committee is to this

[32:49] Why

[32:52] Dennis Nornman

[32:53] Who Dennis Nornman

[32:55] Who when he saw that Andrew Highway was full of shit

[32:58] Which was really early on

[33:01] He got the fuck out of highway pinball

[33:03] Immediately

[33:04] When he saw that Andrew was full of shit

[33:07] He's not saying that now

[33:09] He's there

[33:10] He's up there

[33:11] He's making two new games

[33:13] He's excited

[33:15] Quinton

[33:15] All these guys

[33:17] I mean it literally

[33:19] It literally

[33:20] If it was just Robert Mueller

[33:22] And John Papaduke

[33:24] You know, slapping ideas around in Texas

[33:26] We would all call this thing

[33:28] Full of shit

[33:29] Never gonna happen

[33:30] Another

[33:46] All of these other people

[33:47] You know, animators, mechanical engineers

[33:49] Everyone's working on these pinball games

[33:52] And they're talking this big talk

[33:55] And I don't know how

[33:58] It's bullshit

[33:59] Because they're all there

[34:01] Now but here's the thing

[34:02] I need to play devil's advocate

[34:04] Because we keep hearing

[34:06] And when you know

[34:07] When you hear these guys say stuff like

[34:09] We're gonna do all this stuff that's never been done before

[34:11] We've figured out the magic girl levitating ball

[34:14] That was impossible

[34:15] But we figured it out

[34:16] You know, we're gonna make more games

[34:19] In 2019

[34:21] Then every other pinball company combined

[34:23] Okay

[34:24] Let's just like

[34:25] Take that statement for example

[34:28] There were like eight to nine games released in a year

[34:31] Right

[34:32] We're at this point now

[34:33] Where that's where we're at

[34:34] With total manufacturers combined

[34:36] Right

[34:36] Everything from every manufacturer

[34:38] How is Deeproot Pimball

[34:40] Who's never made a single game before

[34:43] Going to go from zero to nine games a year

[34:46] When Jack at Jersey Jack

[34:48] Can only make like four games in seven years

[34:52] You know, Stern is still

[34:54] Only making like four games or five games

[34:57] And look at their facility

[34:59] How are they gonna make more than that

[35:01] Right

[35:02] So there's not even like a physics

[35:03] See you could you could say like well maybe it's

[35:06] Maybe it's

[35:07] Quality over quantity Chris right

[35:09] Maybe we're gonna make seven eight games

[35:11] We're not gonna make five thousand of each

[35:14] But then you start to hear stuff like

[35:16] It does you know

[35:16] We don't have to worry about profitability

[35:19] How is that possible

[35:21] How is every game

[35:21] Immediately profitable

[35:23] There's no way like

[35:24] You know you you can't have a crystal ball to the point

[35:27] Where you know

[35:29] What the demand is gonna be for each game

[35:32] And you can't just make one part for each order

[35:35] You're gonna have to make parts

[35:37] In bulk to get the cost down

[35:40] Because that's the other thing they said right

[35:42] Is we're gonna make games cheaper than anyone's ever made it before

[35:46] And they're gonna be better

[35:47] Right it sounds so good

[35:49] It sounds too good

[35:51] To be true

[35:53] So the devil's that the kid in me is like

[35:55] Well how are they gonna do that

[35:57] How are they gonna do that

[35:58] I mean all they really needed to do

[36:00] To put themselves on the map

[36:01] Was just to make one great game

[36:04] And immediately

[36:05] Deep root would have to have everyone's attention

[36:08] But their sites are far higher than that

[36:11] It's not just one game

[36:12] It's

[36:13] It's multiple games

[36:15] It's multiple games from multiple designers

[36:17] All happening at once with

[36:19] With people from the film industry

[36:21] And people from the video game industry

[36:23] And engineers and

[36:24] And software coders

[36:26] Artist

[36:27] Everything you can think of

[36:29] Has been thought of

[36:30] And is being worked on

[36:32] To deliver something that we've never seen before

[36:35] Like we keep hearing that

[36:36] Like this you're gonna get something

[36:38] That has never happened before in Pimble

[36:40] Okay

[36:41] So after hearing all of that

[36:43] Right and and and and and I apologize

[36:46] Robert for some of the humor I had to inject

[36:48] Into some of those lines

[36:49] So after hearing all of that

[36:51] What are we supposed to take away

[36:53] Like what are we supposed to

[36:55] Expect now at Tpf

[36:59] Now one of the things in marketing

[37:01] That you always have to be careful of

[37:03] It's you have to be careful of managing

[37:05] The expectations of the consumer

[37:08] Right

[37:10] I don't know what

[37:12] We're supposed to expect other

[37:14] Than the greatest Pimble machines

[37:16] Ever made of all time right now

[37:18] Okay because when I hear what they've said

[37:21] The those are my expectations now

[37:23] That you're gonna give me

[37:24] The greatest Pimble machines of all time

[37:27] And you're gonna do it

[37:28] As your initial titles

[37:31] Without any experience without any previous

[37:35] Manufacturing without any games to learn off of

[37:39] This is it like you literally

[37:41] Have just promised everybody the greatest Pimble ever

[37:44] Now look

[37:45] You know to their defense

[37:47] They're hiring people

[37:49] Who have been doing Pimble for decades

[37:50] So this isn't like all new people

[37:53] You know taking a swing at it

[37:55] But it's a really it's a really incredible

[38:00] Headspace they've put us all in

[38:02] Because there's no there's nowhere I feel like

[38:06] For them to go now

[38:08] But down when it comes to

[38:11] You know living up to those expectations and that's the challenge

[38:14] And that's why if I were them

[38:17] And I've said this before it's like what what what value is there

[38:21] In setting expectations this high

[38:24] What why do it like why come to expel in October

[38:28] To say this stuff. I mean it definitely puts you on the map

[38:31] It definitely peaks people's curiosity

[38:34] But now there is like an extreme pressure

[38:37] To deliver

[38:38] Something that is that magical and Robert was saying like they you know in the interview like they've got a countdown clock

[38:46] That's counting down to tpf that they need to get everything ready by

[38:50] And so if we've learned one thing in this hobby

[38:54] Is that deadlines and countdown clocks and pressure

[38:59] Rarely do those things lead to things getting finished on time

[39:03] In fact, it usually has the opposite effect

[39:05] And it creates delays it creates

[39:09] Missed

[39:10] Opportunities it creates

[39:12] Lowered expectations by the customer it gets people frustrated

[39:16] They haven't taken anyone's money so no one's like given these guys like pre order money

[39:19] No one's like ah you promised me a game on this date and I want it

[39:23] But they did say that they are going to get pinball out to you by March

[39:29] Of 2019 that is just six months from now

[39:35] All right now

[39:36] Okay, how do you guys feel? I want you guys to email me what your feelings are on deep route and everything

[39:44] They're saying they're going to do in pinball to canada pinball at gmail.com

[39:49] You know I am I continue to be absolutely

[39:53] Flabbergasted by the

[39:56] dramatic hyperbole and incredible claims and proclamations

[40:01] This team is making but

[40:04] It also excites me to know and to hear them and make these incredible claims

[40:10] Because I would rather have someone

[40:14] Boast to me that they're going to blow everything away

[40:19] Versus what the other companies are doing and I think they're all just approaching pinball the same way

[40:27] And and and like they can't do anything to dethrone stern, right?

[40:33] So let's just like look at it like that for a minute

[40:36] We live in the pinball world where nobody can even come close to touching what stern is doing and

[40:43] For us to get the best bang for the buck and for the games to get better

[40:48] We actually need somebody

[40:50] That

[40:51] Drive stern to improve

[40:53] Right the reason why stern artwork is so good nowadays is because we bitched and moaned on pinside about their shitty artwork

[41:01] And other artwork packages from other manufacturers

[41:04] Got really good and that's why stern hired these artists if they didn't have to they would still be dragging and dropping the crappy Photoshop

[41:14] Now what do you think

[41:16] Stern's response is listening to deep route. Do they do they consider these guys just a bunch of hot air like can they easily dismiss Robert Mueller's

[41:25] Team? I don't know. I don't know like

[41:28] How you can like you've got to be somewhat curious what is going on

[41:33] Another question I want to ask is what does a successful deep route do to some of these smaller guys?

[41:41] I mean I if deep route is successful if Robert and team are successful in doing what they want to do and doing what they say

[41:50] They're gonna do I feel like immediately overnight

[41:54] Companies like spooky American pinball and jersey jack pinball are fucked like they they literally the companies that are probably the most nervous

[42:05] About deep route succeeding are those three

[42:08] I mean, I think these guys and he I would even throw Chicago gaming in there if you've got Nordman

[42:14] Papaduke Norris all these guys making new games Barry Osler making new games

[42:19] Yeah, that they're excited about with new tech and new you know that feel modern who the fuck wants the old old stuff even if it's great games

[42:28] Because you know what we haven't had is anyone you know again do what these guys say they're gonna do

[42:33] Which is make the best pinball ever but making it in a modern way that's gonna be incredible

[42:39] No one has succeed it and getting Valley Williams error games back you know into the world the way everyone's wanted and like it's not even

[42:48] It's not even about like trying to recreate the Valley Williams magic, you know, I've talked to Robert like these guys

[42:54] They just want to make they think what pinball can be is better than even anything you've ever seen in Valley Williams error

[43:03] And how do you not get excited by that kind of ambition?

[43:07] That's that they're doing with their dollar and their money and their capital

[43:12] Do you think that anyone else in the pinball world is really trying to do that?

[43:16] I don't think so

[43:18] So

[43:19] You know if you're those other companies

[43:21] I think you're kind of terrified

[43:23] That these guys might in 2019

[43:27] Like completely fuck up your ability to survive

[43:32] But look look you you might be like Chris you're out of your fucking mind Chris these guys haven't done anything

[43:38] This is another like bullshit highway or dutch all over again

[43:42] And I just don't see it there guys. I don't I don't think you can compare

[43:47] The team and the resources these guys have to any of those failed ventures

[43:54] But the question the biggest question ever will always be can they manufacture and can they get you a game

[44:02] You know Robert saying they can build you and get you a game within two weeks

[44:06] How where where's the line? You know

[44:10] The reason why I started can do that is they give about 200 women who come in every day and build your game

[44:16] They've got that huge assembly line building your game

[44:20] Where

[44:21] Where where's deeproot gonna do that how they gonna do that?

[44:25] Um now they claim they're gonna do it. Octo manufacturing

[44:29] So look

[44:31] Look it all sounds crazy

[44:33] But here's my ultimate takeaway

[44:35] I'm happy that there's a company that wants to shake shit up all right

[44:39] I'm gonna call them out a little bit on their bullshit at times when they say stuff like

[44:43] We're gonna make more games and one year than then all companies combine

[44:46] I think that's a silly statement

[44:48] I think it's stupid. I think it's unnecessary Robert you don't have to do that

[44:51] Also Robert from a marketing standpoint all right

[44:54] This is Chris marketer and talking directly to you. You don't want to release 10 pinball machines in a year

[44:58] Why do that?

[45:00] Why do that to yourself? You know space it out, you know

[45:03] Disney doesn't release like 10 star wars movies in a year

[45:06] Marvel does not release five to seven

[45:09] You know they don't release like all their films in one year. They're I know you're trying to prove a point

[45:14] I know you want to prove a point. I know you want to show the world what you can do

[45:17] But here's the thing take it one step at a time you don't have to

[45:22] You know show everything you guys have been working on all that once

[45:25] It doesn't do you any good you also don't have to sell 15 games a year

[45:30] I would think that deeproot if they really want to like come into the market

[45:34] And they really want to shake shit up think about it think about it all you would need to do is have

[45:39] Two games a year and you're immediately better than spooky immediately better than jjp

[45:44] Immediately better than american pinball and if those games are magical if your two games a year are

[45:49] Fucking the magic that you're describing

[45:52] Then people are gonna buy them they will buy them over

[45:56] You know the stern games that just always seem to you know have the same sort of stern feel and stern layout and this and that

[46:02] You know lack of mex lack of magic

[46:05] You know

[46:06] I think people would gravitate towards them

[46:08] But if you over-promise and then under-deliver

[46:11] I think that is a recipe for

[46:14] Disaster and it also puts so much pressure on everyone there to do so many things at once

[46:19] You know, I I love the whole collaborative nature of deeproot

[46:23] But why not have all of them working to make two games or three games absolutely bonkers versus ten games

[46:29] Right now what do they know that we don't know don't you guys I just feel like what do they know

[46:34] That we don't know what if they figured out that we haven't figured out and you know for that reason

[46:41] I want to conclude this podcast by saying a couple things one is

[46:46] I can't wait for tpf 2019. I mean book your room book your flight tpf 2019 is going to be

[46:56] The most like

[46:58] Watched and followed event. I think of any pinball show I've ever seen ever

[47:04] I mean it literally this feels like the may weather McGregor of like pinball shows like this is the one

[47:09] Like I feel like ed could sell the show as a pay-per-view

[47:13] Fucking event right pay-per-view event

[47:17] Well speaking of pay-per-view event didn't I elude to Mike Tyson being at

[47:21] Pinball expert this year? I didn't even I forgot to to show you guys the clip

[47:25] But and then I'm gonna conclude my show but

[47:28] Mike Tyson was at the deeproot

[47:31] Seminar and he asked the following question now you tell me

[47:35] After hearing this clip that this wasn't Mike Tyson at fucking expo 2018

[47:40] To be interchangeable like listen like the pinball 2000 series from from Williams

[47:46] So you have one cabinet you can you can put like for each new game you can just swap out a play field into it

[47:54] No, there's not gonna be any gimmicks in our in our machines

[47:58] Well, I guess iron Mike is really looking for an Andrew highway model of pinball

[48:02] But come on didn't that sound like iron Mike unbelievable. Who is that guy?

[48:06] You know look I think at the end of the day

[48:09] You know, this is really gonna be the show that everyone is gonna wait to see is Steve Richie when we get to tpf

[48:16] Is he gonna is he gonna bum rush the five divs of deeproot and and show the same level of arrogance?

[48:22] He showed at expo when he did the Q&A like this

[48:25] This question is for Dennis Nordman

[48:30] Are you gonna do green water?

[48:33] Blue water red water

[48:36] Red water. Okay, just curious

[48:39] If Barry can you make another comic game?

[48:43] Hi John that's it. Thank you

[48:47] You know, I can't tell if he was being facetious reviews actually like talking smack

[48:52] But again, I think that kind of that kind of behavior from stern that kind of arrogance

[48:56] I know that's what's fueling

[48:59] Robert and the team at deeproot to prove a point. So you know tpf

[49:03] We're all gonna have to wait and see what happens now. I think this is gonna create a climate

[49:08] Where you'd be silly just to run and buy like every new game coming out now like are you gonna go buy October Fest and monsters and Beatles and you know

[49:16] Pirates of the Caribbean when you can just wait six months and if you wait six months

[49:21] And you see what happens at tpf

[49:25] Then you'll be able to decide where to apply your money and you'll have way more options than you do today

[49:32] So I think for the first time ever we are going to see a Q4

[49:39] Sort of slowdown on sales like never before in this hobby because I think people are gonna start coming to their senses and realizing

[49:48] It's not gonna be hard to get any of these machines. They all come up for sale look look at right now

[49:54] I was looking

[49:55] There's all these iron made in L.E.s for sale now

[49:57] There's even iron made in L.E.s new in box for $9,000 nothing

[50:01] Nothing remains unobtainium and if you just let that small little hype window that stern

[50:08] Need you to buy into so badly if you just pause

[50:12] You then realize I don't need it right now

[50:15] And I should actually wait until the game comes out that I really really want to play now look if

[50:21] Hearing everything that Robert says they're gonna do and you know if that doesn't make you want to just wait and see

[50:28] Then I don't know why you're even in this hobby because I think the point of them going to expo

[50:35] Was probably to get people to like wait

[50:39] Wait until you see what we do look and if they come out at tpf and they fumble and they fail cool

[50:45] You can go buy a monster's L.E. you can go buy a Beatles you can go buy whatever a primus you can go buy

[50:52] Stern Godzilla whatever the next stern must have pin is you'll find a million deadpool L.E.s for like less than you know

[51:00] Like like much less than $9,000 by then people will be selling their pirates the caribbean's for two thousand less than they paid for it

[51:08] You know this is what's gonna happen you're gonna be able to go get a dialed in and a and a hobbit at by tpf

[51:15] Probably for like below

[51:18] $6,000 like I'm not even shitting you when I say this

[51:21] There are so many of those games out there that they will all be going south fast

[51:28] And if way more games are flooding into the market you're gonna see

[51:32] So many good deals to be had that it only makes sense to wait

[51:37] All right, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna wait

[51:40] I'm gonna wait and and and I'm really gonna wait because I said this at the very beginning

[51:44] If you go back and you listen to me and how I talked about deeproot from the very beginning

[51:50] I've always said one thing

[51:53] if deeproot

[51:55] Can fix the problems of magic girl. I am buyer number one. All right. Give me serial number number one Robert

[52:04] I my I will buy

[52:06] Magic girl on day one from these guys all right, and I will buy a

[52:13] Deeproot pin that has the magic and the world under glass. I've been looking for and until I see what they do

[52:21] I am not buying anything new from any other manufacturer

[52:25] And that is not me shielding for them. That is just me saying I think the wise man

[52:31] slows down right now and just sees what the options will be right

[52:37] It's kind of like when you buy a new you like if you don't go buy a car

[52:42] Right before you know the new model years are coming out you don't unless you want a huge discount on the old model year

[52:48] But when you know a completely redesigned Mustang is coming out you don't go buy the last version of the old model

[52:57] And I feel like we're at that point now where Robert is promising a whole new

[53:03] A whole new pinball experience

[53:06] Just wait and it's not just him. He's got an entire team saying

[53:11] Just wait you know it's coming you're gonna be blown away

[53:15] All right, I'm willing to believe that they're gonna deliver and I think I think most of you out there

[53:22] Who collect and buy pinballs should also just wait and see

[53:28] Wait and see and I think too like sending a message to Stern. I'm not just gonna buy now

[53:33] I'm not just gonna buy everything you put out. I'm not just I'm not just gonna let you make me wait a year jack

[53:38] I'm not gonna let you like lock me in Charlie for a game for 18 months, you know

[53:45] You know I feel like right now every distributor is listening to this podcast be like you asshole can either

[53:50] You just cost me so much sales that I need to get this holiday

[53:55] I'm sorry, but like

[53:57] Ultimately, I think now's the time to wait and I'll sign off this podcast by saying who did I think one

[54:04] Expo like who won expo

[54:06] um

[54:08] You know there's two ways to look at this. I mean, I think obviously when it comes to like reveal

[54:13] I think that American Pimmon October fest one expo in terms of like creating the most conversation in chatter

[54:19] Right, but the game didn't win the game's not a win the game's not a home run the game's not like a slam dunk by any means

[54:26] All right, I think coming out of expo

[54:28] If you think about it like who's who's got the momentum coming out of expo

[54:33] Who's got the real momentum that's like everyone's just like up, you know, I can't wait to see what's coming next

[54:38] The expo was won

[54:41] By deep route. I'll tell you

[54:44] They were one and look they won with words which I rarely would ever say that

[54:50] But I think they won it because they're gonna have people talking and speculating so much more than everybody else

[55:00] Because they have to deliver on promises that we're not getting

[55:04] From any other manufacturer nobody else is trying to do what they're doing and how like again

[55:10] I only say this and I know like I could lose listeners over this

[55:13] I'm only saying this because of the entire team of people that are all validating those claims

[55:20] Where else have we ever seen that many people validate claims when Andrew highway was making claims

[55:26] It was only him right it was like an empty warehouse nobody else was saying the company was in good standing except for Andrew highway and hilton

[55:34] And we all know what happened there he fucking lied to us all in a failed same thing with bearing up

[55:38] It was just those two guys were trying to convince you things were okay. They lied went under

[55:43] It was just Kevin Kool-Ick and Hilton convincing you that skit b was okay and they went under

[55:49] Steve Bowden all right

[55:52] If this goes under we can all blame Steve Bowden because Steve we trust you so much

[55:59] But if this goes well

[56:02] I want

[56:03] Steve Bowden to come over my apartment and

[56:07] Set up my magic girl and show me how to play through the game

[56:13] I will buy number one. All right

[56:16] Deeproot wins extra because of what they've said

[56:19] Which I know seems hypocritical

[56:23] But this has been episode 273 of canada's pinball podcast agree or disagree hit me up a canada pinball at gmail.com

[56:30] If you want to come on the show

[56:31] I know I've been to link when I'm getting some of you on the show come on the show

[56:35] Let's discuss this let's debate it

[56:38] We have got an incredible six months ahead of us going to the five days of deeproot have a great week everybody

[56:49] Yes
