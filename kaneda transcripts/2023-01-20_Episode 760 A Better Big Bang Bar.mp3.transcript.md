[00:00] Don't listen to a word I say, the screams all sound the same, but for the truth made by this shit we'll carry out by the exception of...

[00:16] Cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere, cere

[00:46] ever since Big Bang Bar was remade. It's up there on the list of games like Tron,

[00:52] Vault Edition, another run of Pirates of the Caribbean, is Stern gonna do a

[00:58] Vault Edition of Ghostbusters and look I think this game is gonna be remade. I

[01:03] think it's going to be remade most likely by raw thrills. It might not be

[01:09] raw thrills but I'm telling you this right now. I have confirmation and I mean

[01:14] it and Mr. Josh Sharp can put a gif of him eating popcorn but raw thrills is

[01:21] getting into the pinball space and I think what's gonna happen is this. I

[01:27] think it's gonna be a joint venture between raw thrills and CGC and they

[01:32] are going to licensed games. Now look the Big Bang Bar license is still owned by

[01:39] Planetary Pinball and Rick over there. So this is still a licensed game but let's

[01:45] talk about this just from a macro standpoint first. Do we need more Big

[01:52] Bang bars? Now look if you love pinball and you love playing pinball and you

[01:57] talk to people who play a lot of pinball and if you talk to people who have

[02:02] jumped on a Big Bang Bar and not everybody has but the overall consensus

[02:09] is usually this. It's a beautiful pin, it's a quirky looking machine, it's overly

[02:16] sexualized and fun for men to jump on it but the overall consensus is usually

[02:21] it's not that good of a pinball machine and the reason why this game was always

[02:26] collectible is they didn't make many of them. Remember like this was a Capcom

[02:31] game and when Capcom went out of business Big Bang Bar never went into

[02:36] fault production and then Gene Cunningham went and remade the game. It like

[02:41] killed the man basically like he took so many years to remake this game and he

[02:47] got it done eventually and now here we are and the reason why this game is

[02:52] still special why do you think this game is still special? Because there aren't

[02:56] many of them in the world. Now if you go and remake it and add more code because

[03:01] that's the other part about Big Bang Bar is the code is very shallow. If you go

[03:06] and remake it it's gonna be hard to remake this game to get it to feel like a

[03:10] Capcom pinball machine. Now look there are people out there that might argue

[03:13] the Capcom game didn't feel that well so if you add a different flipper field

[03:18] maybe more like a stern the game would play much better. There's also some

[03:23] people out there I'm just gonna say this one of my friends I'm not gonna name

[03:26] his name he was like Chris. In 2023 coming out with a game called Big Bang Bar

[03:34] with women or naked women sort of dancing in a pinball machine is not

[03:39] culturally appropriate and I was like look bro just stop don't go woke on

[03:44] pinball if you look at the pinball buying audience and you look at like the

[03:49] fact that he look at Elvira for example right you can't get woke in pinball and

[03:53] then look at the Elvira machine and be like look we're not overly sexualizing

[03:58] women and look that's Elvira's stick right because you can't cancel Elvira

[04:02] because she's a woman who willingly presents herself to the world that way

[04:06] and look I don't take offense to some alien game about alien strippers on a

[04:11] pole like I'm not gonna get all woke and cancel that game and hello wonely big

[04:17] juicy melons people are sitting in the homes of people who also have wives and

[04:22] daughters and I don't think anyone's really complaining but my point is this

[04:26] this game is collectible because this game is rare so back in the day I think

[04:31] Capcom made like a hundred and twenty two of them and then Gene Cunningham in

[04:37] 2004 took deposits on 183 more games okay so there's not many big bang bars in

[04:45] the world and that is why this game if you see it it still feels like a

[04:49] collectible a museum piece and it's a sight to behold now look if you go and

[04:54] remake this game you're gonna destroy that sort of element of the game and now

[04:59] we've got three versions of it right we have the original Capcom will have the

[05:03] Gene Cunningham version and then we'll have the new version made by I don't know

[05:07] raw thrills or somebody else and so should we remake this game and if you're

[05:11] going to remake big bang bars should there be a limit on how many they're

[05:16] gonna make now look the question of whether or not this will sell let's talk

[05:20] about that do I think if they remake big bang bar in 2023 it's gonna be a huge

[05:27] hit and sell within the pinball community I think it comes down to a few

[05:31] factors I think it comes down to how many are you gonna make who's making them

[05:36] right what's the quality of the machine who's doing the code updates in the game

[05:40] to make it better and also ultimately how much is the game gonna be priced I

[05:45] mean we can't get around this now where would you price a big bang bar at right

[05:50] now because right now on the second hand market these machines are selling for

[05:55] over $20,000 I think you can get good examples of these machines now trade

[05:59] between like 25 to even $30,000 okay and that's because there's only like a

[06:05] handful in the world and if you go and remake it you're not gonna price this

[06:10] game at 9000 or 10,000 I think you've got to price it somewhere competitively

[06:16] within the collectible space and what sucks about all the pinball right now

[06:21] and this is why people are harping on this if you make just 500 James Bond

[06:26] single level games and Stern prices it at $20,000 if you go make big bang bar a

[06:35] game with more pedigree within the pinball space a game that's got more

[06:39] toys and fun stuff in it than James Bond a game that arguably is much sexier in a

[06:45] work of art wouldn't you price it over $20,000 but I think Stern showed

[06:51] everybody that they priced it too high the game is not still sold out you want

[06:55] to hear a crazy story I know a big distributor I'm not gonna name their

[06:59] name they bought 14 James Bond 60th anniversary editions 14 and they only

[07:06] sold four of them and that means they have 10 machines that they sent Stern a

[07:12] check for which is a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in inventory that they

[07:18] cannot move this game was so overpriced and is gonna go down as the worst

[07:23] launch in Stern's history it just is and everyone who buys one is gonna

[07:28] unbox and realize how they got hoodwinked by the Disney executives that

[07:33] are just gonna bleed us of what we love and it's gonna happen people it's

[07:37] already happening I love it when people say that they priced it right no they

[07:40] didn't if they priced it right it would be sold out okay so let's talk about this

[07:44] big bang bar so what do you price it at I think you got to price it around maybe I

[07:47] don't know 15 thousand dollars and then how many are you gonna make I mean that's

[07:51] the big question if you're gonna turn on manufacturing it almost doesn't make

[07:56] sense to do a small volume manufacturing run but if this is raw

[08:02] thrills and this is CGC working together to make this game the other company that

[08:07] I think it might be if it's not raw thrills and CGC I could see American

[08:11] pinball making this game like and I've always said this why isn't David Fix

[08:16] going and just making games that have more demand like why go through the

[08:21] effort to make a game like Legends of Vahala which is fine it's an all-right

[08:26] game it's a B-game and you make that game you sell it for 8700 it immediately

[08:32] loses value nobody really wants more of them and then what did you really do like

[08:38] what did you put into the pinball world that really created a shift or a

[08:43] momentum for your company you know I always believe this a pinball company

[08:47] needs to make sure its portfolio has a little swagger like if I had a pinball

[08:52] company and I was running a pinball company I would make sure that every

[08:56] title we come out with we're super proud of that we're not just throwing stuff on

[09:01] the line to throw stuff on the line and I think very few companies really

[09:06] understand the importance of protecting the master brand like even when I look

[09:11] at JJP it's all over the place like Wizard of Oz then Hobbit then dialed in

[09:16] really dialed in you want to put dialed in in the lineup no no no no no no to

[09:23] Toy Story 4 you can go from Guns N Roses the coolest badass rock band of all

[09:28] time to freaking Toy Story 4 you got to have some consistency some swagger your

[09:35] lineup is your portfolio and that is how cool your brand is and if you go from

[09:39] Houdini to Oktoberfest to Hot Wheels to Legends of Vahal I mean talk about a

[09:47] really weird motley crew lineup that I would not feel proud to stay in front of

[09:51] but we're not talking about that we're talking about Big Bang Bar so look

[09:54] here's my thing in 2023 we now have another rumored game coming out and

[10:00] here's another rumor for all of you I am hearing that there's another pinball

[10:03] company that is about to throw their hat into the ring in 2023 this is a

[10:09] company you have never heard of before they are making a licensed theme game

[10:15] there are people in the industry that you know very well working on this game

[10:20] here's the other crazy part they are not gonna reveal this game until they have

[10:26] at least 200 of the machines built and in a box ready to ship to customers they

[10:33] are not gonna take non-refundable deposits they're not gonna play games

[10:36] with everybody they are going to come out of left field and I've heard because

[10:41] I've talked to someone working on the game I've heard from him he said Chris

[10:44] look 2022 was very underwhelming I think when you see this game he said to me

[10:50] he's like you're not gonna be surprised about what it is which is crazy which

[10:53] means it's one of the themes we've been speculating on but he said I think you're

[10:57] gonna be highly impressed when you see this game in the flesh or in the wood

[11:03] and the lights okay so look this is just nuts to me we have so many pinball

[11:08] companies and there's more than 12 pinball companies making products right

[11:12] now in the pinball space and all I'm asking is this and this is just me

[11:16] personally I don't think we need to go back and make games from the 90s I don't

[11:21] I think what we need we need more new games based on themes we love that are

[11:28] integrated mechanically code wise light shows artistically that are integrated

[11:35] in a way that are just special and that's the thing about Big Bang Bar it's

[11:40] like really are we out of ideas as an industry are we out of ideas as

[11:46] manufacturers if we're gonna roll the dice on something why don't we roll the

[11:51] dice on a new theme that hasn't been made before I don't mean an original

[11:55] theme I mean a licensed IP theme that we know people love that we know people

[12:01] want and why don't we make it as good as we can why don't we show people what

[12:06] we got as an engineering company as an artistic venture and that's what I'm

[12:11] hoping for that is what canada wants to see in 2023 I'm optimistic we're gonna

[12:17] get there I am I really do have a lot of optimism that at these prices these

[12:22] companies can't come in with just mediocrity and look I'm not a dreamer

[12:26] I'm a realist too if you remake Big Bang Bar you're gonna sell a few hundred of

[12:33] them there's always gonna be buyers who line up especially that the game is

[12:37] selling for so much on the used market it's a no-brainer I think if they remake

[12:43] it I would make no more than a thousand and when they do do that it's then gonna

[12:47] like saturate the market a little bit on this very rare game all of the prices

[12:53] of Big Bang Bar will come back down and you will see owners who passed on people

[12:58] I mean there were people offering people like 30 40,000 for their Big Bang Bars

[13:02] during COVID yes those people will be kicking themselves and I always feel bad

[13:08] not bad for collectors like high-end collectors when they see something like

[13:12] this in the news because think about it you've got a Big Bang Bar you see this

[13:16] NAPS story and it's like now what do I do because everybody knows like if those

[13:21] guys have the old game with the old code and a new game is coming out with new

[13:27] code and maybe even some better engineering they're gonna have the

[13:32] version of the game that no one's really going to want or not want as much

[13:36] because let's face it you can make games better the Chicago gaming company

[13:42] remakes are better than the originals I will fight I will slap fight anyone who

[13:48] says the originals are better the Chicago gaming games look better the

[13:52] quality is better the playfield is better everything about it is better the

[13:56] toppers are better the artwork everything about it is just better so if they

[14:01] make a better Big Bang Bar they should call it that they should call it better

[14:04] Big Bang Bar just add another B and release it as the better Big Bang Bar

[14:09] or the best Big Bang Bar version on the planet so we will see what happens the

[14:14] real thing about to happen this month is spooky pinball is going to show us

[14:18] Scooby-Doo now look they're doing a great job I will commend them they are

[14:22] doing a great job of showing us the cabinets the playfield the employees all

[14:27] the work going on you know in one week spooky pinball has been more

[14:30] transparent than Haggis pinball in two years oh oh canada you can't rag on

[14:35] Haggis we got to support everything in pinball I just did Damien do you know how

[14:40] to work a camera do you know how Facebook works Marty do you know how to use

[14:45] social media come on guys just share some photos do a factory tour hey we know

[14:50] you're making the games how about just do a walkthrough so spooky pinball is

[14:55] doing what they do best they show us behind the curtain and everyone's

[14:58] getting excited but there's one thing they haven't shown us and it is the

[15:02] most important part of this game it is going to be the make or break element

[15:06] of the game and that is the code the code is everything on Scooby-Doo because

[15:12] you can tell like the shot layout it's not that interesting there's not that

[15:16] many toys in the game it's a fan layout right there's a big upper playfield

[15:20] there's a few magnets in it there's no pop bumpers and the gameplay could be

[15:24] look I think this game is gonna have a lot of flow but it also might be a little

[15:29] repetitive to shoot if it's just up and down up and down up and down not a lot of

[15:33] left to right not a lot of randomness not a lot of chaos not a lot of toys to

[15:38] interact with I think then the code needs to be the thing that wakes the game

[15:42] up and makes it exciting and gives it replay value so we shall see now look

[15:47] January is coming to an end and they said this thing was gonna be streamed in

[15:51] January so we shall see Jack danger is supposed to stream it I reached out to

[15:56] Jack he does not have a date from spooky pinball yet so we will see so that

[16:00] will be the big news item this month will be that and then we'll start to see

[16:05] those James Bond 60th editions land next month I can't wait to see these rich

[16:10] guys unbox it I hope when these rich dudes unbox it they can do like a walk

[16:15] around their house and their cribs I just want to see how rich they are

[16:18] because you have to have so much money to see the value in this game and I love

[16:24] all the rich pinheads there's so many great guys in this hobby that have like

[16:28] half a million in cars and of course this machine means nothing and I just want

[16:32] to see how much better your refrigerator is than mine can we do that can you guys

[16:37] share how cool your cribs are I don't really care about the game the game's

[16:41] boring to me I'm more interested to see how expensive your toilet bowls are and

[16:45] your bathtubs and your stoves like that's more interesting to me than what's

[16:49] going on with James Bond 60th everybody have a great Friday this is

[16:53] Canadian love you guys the club membership keeps going up thank you so much for

[16:57] the support and we're gonna march into Texas with our cargo shorts on later

[17:19] oh

[17:23] ship will carry our body safe to shore though the truth may vary this ship will

[17:34] carry our body safe to shore

[17:49] you
