[01:32] We're coming in.

[01:41] We're preaching to the choir.

[01:46] Can I get them like a little bit higher?

[01:50] What up?

[01:51] Live video blocked.

[01:53] Resume.

[01:55] They blocked my live video because of the music.

[01:58] I love it.

[02:00] How's everybody doing?

[02:03] Let's do this.

[02:05] Demon Hunter style.

[02:08] My hair is all over the place.

[02:10] Let's get this over here.

[02:12] Am I in the front or the back?

[02:14] I can't even tell if I have this on straight or not.

[02:17] I think so.

[02:19] This is going to be hard.

[02:22] Sad boy, baby.

[02:24] 100 fucker.

[02:26] Ruse.

[02:27] Have fun at expo my man.

[02:29] Use this towards your ball and out dinner and make sure to light predator on fire in front of everybody to see.

[02:37] Oh, geez.

[02:38] I'm not going to light predator on fire, but I am curious to see how that game plays.

[02:42] How is everybody doing?

[02:43] Welcome to Canadian Spinball podcast.

[02:45] I got a new wire here.

[02:47] We are all good.

[02:48] Let's turn it up.

[02:49] Can I get the mic a little bit higher?

[02:53] Ah, ah.

[02:54] It's like hairs are like in my face.

[02:56] How's everybody doing?

[02:58] How is everybody doing?

[03:00] We are here.

[03:02] We are jamming it as a week before.

[03:04] It's the week of expo.

[03:06] I think everyone realizes that expo is going to be.

[03:12] It's going to be Star Wars.

[03:15] And nothing else.

[03:17] Right.

[03:18] No walking dead.

[03:20] Nothing predator.

[03:22] Dune.

[03:23] We're going to talk all about what's going on in the pinball world.

[03:26] I've been lighting fires.

[03:28] Talking about Eric Gilly.

[03:30] I got someone else reached out to me.

[03:32] I was just going to tell you.

[03:34] What's going on over there?

[03:36] Are they losing it?

[03:38] Are they losing the swag of the momentum?

[03:41] How can they beat a guy like this?

[03:45] Don's pinball podcasts.

[03:46] We're getting close to reconciliation.

[03:49] He's back on the page.

[03:50] It's nice to see next on the list.

[03:53] Retro Ralph.

[03:54] Gotta look me in the eye.

[03:55] You know, Ralph's going to have to look me in the eye like this.

[03:58] What's up, baby?

[04:00] Ralph, are you saying that you don't want to be friends?

[04:04] Because you think I'm an immature 49 year old man, child, who

[04:08] will say stuff unexpectedly.

[04:12] I'm going to get your Ralph.

[04:14] We're going to get you back into the fold.

[04:17] It's not the dark side.

[04:18] This is the light side of the force.

[04:20] I think what everyone's realizing is that maybe just maybe.

[04:23] Can he has been right all these years?

[04:25] Maybe he's been right.

[04:26] Maybe these guys keep getting burned and they're tired of getting burned.

[04:30] And maybe they realize that Stern isn't the answer.

[04:34] They make fun games, but lots of stuff happening over there that I think has a lot of people nervous.

[04:39] It's a boutique moment in pinball.

[04:43] It's the boutique moment.

[04:46] You're looking at demon hunter, baby.

[04:51] Demon hunter.

[04:54] If you haven't seen demon hunter, if you have not seen K-pop demon hunters,

[05:00] you're just missing the biggest thing in the world right now.

[05:03] You want to talk about selling pinball machines.

[05:05] It's not about John Wick.

[05:07] It's about demon hunter.

[05:09] Hold on.

[05:10] I got to turn off my audacity.

[05:11] It's messing up my volume levels here.

[05:13] Let's force quit this bad boy audacity.

[05:15] You gone.

[05:16] Quit.

[05:17] What else we want to quit on?

[05:20] Let's see.

[05:21] I got to get the mic a little bit higher.

[05:22] I can't even hear it.

[05:24] How's everybody doing?

[05:29] Don, you've seen demon hunters, man.

[05:31] I know Don's the kind of guy that gets into this stuff.

[05:33] You got to geek out over this stuff.

[05:35] That's like the fun stuff right now.

[05:37] Demon hunter's man.

[05:39] It's all about K-pop demon hunters.

[05:41] Like literally, it is stoked.

[05:43] All right.

[05:45] I'll put, wow.

[05:46] Was that, was that not, I'll put into the mic.

[05:49] Let's see.

[05:50] Input vine.

[05:51] There we go.

[05:52] All right.

[05:53] So now I hear something in my ear.

[05:55] How does it sound?

[05:57] Output.

[05:58] All right.

[05:59] Is that good?

[06:00] Are we good?

[06:01] Are we sounding good?

[06:03] All right.

[06:04] Okay.

[06:05] There we go.

[06:06] Canada.

[06:07] I can hear myself now.

[06:08] I can hear myself now.

[06:09] I can hear myself now.

[06:10] I can hear myself.

[06:11] I can hear myself now.

[06:13] Is it better than a cure?

[06:15] Yeah, it is.

[06:17] It is better than a cure.

[06:19] It'll, K-pop demon hunters will have more of a,

[06:23] it hit with more of an impact on the global culture

[06:27] than a cure will ever.

[06:29] The songs are insanely good as right, Jeff.

[06:32] Like if you don't, if you don't,

[06:35] like I tell people all the time,

[06:37] like you can't be prejudice in this world.

[06:39] You gotta give stuff a chance.

[06:41] It's like, you know many people, like,

[06:43] wouldn't listen to the new machine gun

[06:45] Kelly album, MGK.

[06:47] And then they listen to Lost Americana.

[06:49] It's one of the best albums in the last five years.

[06:53] And I think you guys will have an amazing time

[06:55] if you listen to it.

[06:56] Like don't go into it thinking old MGK.

[06:58] It's like, it's an incredible album.

[07:02] What are you and what have we,

[07:04] ah, can I get the mic a little bit higher?

[07:07] Oh, okay, so we're going to go around the pinball horn today.

[07:11] We're going to talk about all the companies.

[07:13] I got a lot of work to do this weekend.

[07:15] I'm going to expo.

[07:17] I land Thursday morning very early.

[07:20] I'm out Saturday midday.

[07:22] And I can't wait to go.

[07:25] I've managed to make it to this year's show

[07:28] without being threatened that the police will be called

[07:32] if I show up.

[07:34] You guys know that happened to me one year.

[07:36] They were like, if you show up,

[07:38] we will call the cops on you,

[07:40] canada.

[07:41] Can you imagine being in the Chicago police department?

[07:44] And you know, you're battling violent crimes.

[07:49] And what a phone call comes in from a cargo short wearing

[07:53] coward and is like, sir,

[07:55] we have a, a, a Chris from Connecticut,

[07:59] a 49 year old father of two husband with a nice career.

[08:05] He's about to descend upon our pinball show and wreck havoc.

[08:12] He's about to create an incredible disruption to a bunch

[08:16] of middle-aged men with cargo shorts who are spending $15,000

[08:20] in a city where most people are struggling to put food on the table.

[08:24] And he's about to walk in here with a bunch of people

[08:28] who are struggling to put food on the table.

[08:31] And he's about to walk in here with his Gucci on

[08:34] and make us feel ashamed of ourselves in Shamburg, Illinois.

[08:39] Okay, let's get the cops on canada.

[08:42] Let's ban canada.

[08:46] Can't do it.

[08:48] Can't do it.

[08:49] I'm coming, baby.

[08:50] I'm coming.

[08:52] When you think about,

[08:54] you think about these grown men wanting to cancel.

[08:57] Other grown men who have opinions about pinball,

[09:00] you know, you got to think about like, you know,

[09:02] how microcannot penis get.

[09:04] And I think they've got some pretty micro penises on those grown men who,

[09:09] oh, canada.

[09:11] He said it again.

[09:12] He said nobody wants to buy.

[09:14] Doon.

[09:17] It's not that nobody wants to buy.

[09:19] Doon and doon is a beautiful game.

[09:20] You know, I was watching.

[09:21] Was it RF pinball?

[09:22] Was it over there in Europe?

[09:23] Like cleaning a doon machine?

[09:25] It's like, so beautiful machine I still don't want.

[09:30] It's just my opinion about doon.

[09:32] I just, I just,

[09:34] if I never see the Timothy Shamale movie again,

[09:37] I will feel fulfilled in life.

[09:39] It's just not what I want.

[09:41] It's just, it's a beautiful rendition of a theme

[09:46] that people just don't want.

[09:48] Look at Tron Eris, the new movie, bombed, bombed.

[09:53] Thank God, Stern didn't go all in on a Tron Eris pinball machine.

[09:58] Forget it.

[09:59] It would have bankrupted the company.

[10:02] You know, you got to make stuff that has staying power.

[10:07] You know, the doon TV show and HBO bombed.

[10:10] Like nobody watched it.

[10:11] Like doon, it doons like Avatar.

[10:14] It's an iMacs spectacle.

[10:17] Think about the new Avatar.

[10:18] Nobody cares about the new Avatar movie coming out.

[10:20] Nobody's like, oh man, I wonder what happened.

[10:22] Jake Solley and his family.

[10:23] Nobody gives a damn about Jake Solley and his family.

[10:26] Nobody, I don't even,

[10:27] if I asked you to name me four characters in Avatar,

[10:29] you'd be like, uh, I'm gonna get back to you on that.

[10:33] Name me four characters from doon.

[10:35] Like right now, can you guys name me four characters from doon, the movie?

[10:40] Four.

[10:43] Huh?

[10:45] Just four characters from doon.

[10:47] Anybody?

[10:49] I'll wait.

[10:52] I can name you four characters from diehard from top gun.

[10:55] I can name you four characters from cry to kid.

[10:58] Four characters from star wars.

[11:00] Four characters from Avengers.

[11:02] Four characters from big trouble in the little china.

[11:04] You know what I'm saying?

[11:06] That's it.

[11:07] Can't name you four characters.

[11:08] Let's make the pinball machine.

[11:10] And now I'm seeing like, well, there's man, they got an announcement.

[11:13] They got a personnel announcement.

[11:15] Did you see that, ladies?

[11:18] Now we're, now we're promoting, we don't have any news at the shows that we're gonna promote a new hire to barrels upon.

[11:25] Who's gonna be Steve Bowden?

[11:27] Bone Carings.

[11:28] He's already over there.

[11:29] Like, it's, you know, it's gonna be some pinball person.

[11:32] We all know the only hire that would make sense.

[11:36] We'd be hired.

[11:38] Jack Danger, maybe.

[11:41] I don't know.

[11:42] I just, I love it when pinball company is like, we have to have news.

[11:44] We have to stay relevant.

[11:45] We got to sell these damn librons, man.

[11:48] We've got 75 unsold labyrinth games.

[11:51] How are we gonna sell these bad boys?

[11:53] Are we gonna sell them before beetle juice comes out?

[11:55] We're not, we're not gonna sell them.

[11:59] Are we gonna sell these hundreds of dunes left to be sold?

[12:03] Big news from barrels, Wayne.

[12:05] What's the big news?

[12:07] Wayne, Wayne.

[12:10] What's the big news, brother?

[12:12] Is it gonna be big news, Wayne?

[12:14] Are we gonna be like, wow, they got who they get?

[12:18] Who they get?

[12:20] The problem is, is like, whatever they announce, think about it.

[12:24] Whatever barrels announces on Monday, what are you gonna see their end result of whatever the hire is?

[12:29] When are you gonna see it?

[12:31] I mean, they literally gonna make dune for another year.

[12:34] Yeah.

[12:37] Jenga's in the house.

[12:39] Don is in the house.

[12:42] You know, look, we're gonna talk all about these pinball companies, the eve of expo.

[12:47] Let's call that the theme of this show.

[12:50] You know, I got a savage note.

[12:53] Do you want me to read this?

[12:55] Like, I got a savage email from someone who's like, bro, you've got air gilly all wrong.

[13:01] I mean, let me know if you want me to read this later.

[13:03] Like, let's say this, if we get to, if we get to 5,000 stars and 200 bucks on YouTube, let's do this.

[13:11] Let's do a little, let's try a little orbiter Albert.

[13:14] Let's hide stuff behind the paywall.

[13:17] Let's hide stuff.

[13:18] I love that all.

[13:19] This is free.

[13:20] Now let's, let's both make it free and pay wall it.

[13:23] If we get 5,000 stars and 200 dollars on YouTube, I will share with you a savage email.

[13:29] That is a takedown.

[13:31] Take down.

[13:32] Take down.

[13:33] If you don't know demon hunters, you don't know what I'm talking about.

[13:35] A savage takedown of Eric Gilly, Stern, CGC, Planetary, and Stern's relationship with Williams.

[13:47] So yeah, but you know what?

[13:50] You're going to have to pay to hear it because it was a personal email.

[13:54] Now the person did not identify it like Brian, Brian with the 99 cents.

[13:58] We only got 99 dollars to go.

[14:01] But those are the terms of conditions.

[14:04] 5,000 stars, 200 bucks on YouTube, and you get it.

[14:07] You get it.

[14:08] Fizzy.

[14:10] Two bucks.

[14:11] I love it.

[14:12] We're getting there.

[14:13] We're slowly crawling there.

[14:15] Look, I think that it is so much fun.

[14:19] It is so much fun where we are all at right now in Pimball.

[14:25] We are going to get a teaser to Beetle juice, maybe.

[14:29] It doesn't matter.

[14:31] Like it doesn't matter.

[14:32] Like literally, if bugging Luke were like Chris, how do we, or canada, right?

[14:39] How do we get hyped for Beetle juice?

[14:41] Like the game is sold out.

[14:44] Not only that, I still think some of you have not got on a list with your distros to get it.

[14:51] Are there some of you out there that think you're just going to like get one the old fashioned way?

[14:56] Like I'm just trying to warn a lot of you out there that if you try to get this Beetle juice the old fashioned way, you're going to get locked out.

[15:05] And this will be a game.

[15:07] Mark my words where scalpers will buy multiples of it and flip them for 18k.

[15:12] I'm on the record.

[15:15] I'm on the record for saying that looking at the market of evil dead at 15k pop that Beetle juice is will be 18k pop.

[15:24] And I'm seeing a mass exodus of stern ownership and machines.

[15:29] I'm seeing it like they're all going up for sale.

[15:32] Everyone's kind of because here's why and I mean this when I say this I would rather have one.

[15:37] 18k dollar Beetle juice in which there will only ever be 999 in the world.

[15:45] Versus a $10,000 stern premium which there will be thousands of them in the world and even any $13,000 stern early because here's a thing about a stern early we all know stern alleys now mean nothing.

[15:59] And so if you own a jaws at Lee.

[16:02] Okay cool thousands of people own jaws premium which is the same exact game thousands of people a thousand or more people have jaws 50th so you literally have nothing special nothing unique nothing.

[16:14] Like you literally are paid for decals there will only be a thousand Beetle juices in the world for the rest of eternity.

[16:23] That's why these games are going to go up to 18k because I'd rather have one Beetle juice for 18.

[16:29] Then have to stern premiums and the good news is is Beetle juice will not be.

[16:37] 18,000 it'll be 9,999 dollars 999 is not a lot Jeff if Jeff there's only one trim brother.

[16:45] It's a lot when it's the early of again that also has a mass produced premium 999 of Beetle juice 9 times I can say it it's Jeff it's going to sell out in 9 minutes.

[16:59] Beetle juice is a horrible theme okay this this is where we go these these these guys okay Pat Pat's arcade Pat Pat Pat probably bought John Wick Ellie Pat probably bought venom and Pat probably bought star wars fall of the empire so Pat enjoy those games you have.

[17:19] You really you really get it. Beetle juice is like the best theme we've had in a long time John early is that John early.

[17:30] I don't know I don't think I don't think it's spelled the right way I can't even read.

[17:37] Pat. Pat I mean I could use numbers to prove you wrong but Pat you know it will just prove you wrong.

[17:46] If it was a bad theme it wouldn't sell out in 9 minutes so when it sells out in 9 minutes Pat and your begging can a to to give you one of the games spooky is going to give me to give to my fan club members you're you will talk brother.

[18:02] You guys are out of your minds Beetle juice is okay okay okay okay Tim Burton classic that is spawned.

[18:11] Millions of dollars in merchandise and Broadway show and has stood the test the time and is an iconic property it's okay like these dudes you know what okay is.

[18:28] John Wick King Kong with no assets I love it.

[18:34] I love it I love it people.

[18:36] Yeah with pinball boomers guys I don't know what you guys are smoking but here have some.

[18:47] Beetle juice is just okay yeah how many you clowns just bought Star Wars follow the Empire elite can show hands how many clowns out there just lost $3,000.

[18:57] I love it I love it I love the stern you look at Neil Neil McCray went on Pinside and said that Stern has a backlog of orders what what did this guy is a joke he's turned into a total joke.

[19:14] Stern's got a backlog of orders he's like he's like Stern's got a backlog of orders as long as you're on no they don't kneel only only you are the one ordering from them at that volume.

[19:25] Like seriously like as these games pile up as they're like basically demoting their director of sales as you know direct designers and people are unhappy yes turns got a backlog of orders come easily this is this like the stern apologists right now what they're grasping on you is so comical and it's so off base they don't have a backlog of orders they're in trouble everyone everyone knows it it's like so funny.

[19:55] I mean I'm not talking to me though these dudes can't just wake up. They can't wake up and just accept the reality of and then and then kneels out there trying to give spooky device like they need his advice I don't need his advice trying to tell spooky what they need to do to be successful a kneel last time I checked.

[20:11] Stern Pimole is the one that's floundering that's in big trouble and look I'm talking to people that work at Stern I mean this is like legit inside information it is not good it is not good.

[20:24] So we are 50 bucks away from the savage email but I love it because what's going to happen next.

[20:36] I what's going to happen next is is we're all going to we're all going to win we're all going to win.

[20:48] See Jack danger knows who roomy is it's it's time Jack you know people have no idea like K pop demon hunters of the Pimbal machine.

[20:58] This is where like if I'm if I'm David Vaness if I'm spooky if I'm bread Abyss and if I'm George Gomez or Jody Dengford go get K pop demon hunter IP K pop demon hunter as a

[21:17] Pimbal machine would sell to every single Pimbal buyer that has any child that is age like six to 60.

[21:27] But they don't do it they don't know how to hit relevance when it's hot they don't like the fact that there's still no Barbie Pimbal machine is just goes to show you how out of touch how out of touch these licensing people are.

[21:45] We don't buy Pimbal machines for our kids yeah you yeah what do you also like and this is I this is my challenge to all of you out there go watch the movie and tell me it wouldn't make for an amazing Pimbal game it's just an amazing movie and like if you call yourself a nerd or a geek and you like okay let's just let's just like break it down do you like animation.

[22:11] Do you like great music. Do you like an amazing storyline. Do you like like memorable moments.

[22:21] Okay so it has all of that so remember when you used to be like a little kid and you had an open mind and you actually like engaged with things that were special there's a reason why K pop demon hunters took over the world took over the global music charts and when Netflix put it into the movie.

[22:40] There's it became the number one movie in America. So you could you could hunker down in your cargo short world and say that Stern should make pan terra or we need an Ozzy Osborne pin like you could you could be that guy or you could actually go listen and watch what is one of the greatest animated movies of all time.

[23:05] And it's like if Disney made this movie it would be one of the biggest Disney hits of all time.

[23:12] Or you could just you know go go on the cargo short calm and order one with 18 pockets and you know put all of the $5,000 you're losing on every sternale in each pocket and walk around feeling dejected I mean it's your choice not mine I mean like I'm just live in my life.

[23:32] I'm just living a golden life it's going to be going to be golden you know ready for the take down.

[23:38] You have to understand this.

[23:41] I mean I've never seen a song just like stay at number one for so many weeks.

[23:47] No, no, no, Patrick Lake Avatar Avatar soundtrack was a hit you listen into the Avatar theme song if I offered a thousand dollars to someone you could actually hum the Avatar theme song nobody would be paid nobody.

[24:10] Yeah.

[24:16] You know bug you get it you get it you get it brother.

[24:24] I got a I got a gift for you guys I don't know like are you guys driving the expo I don't know if I should mail it to the hotel.

[24:31] Or I should mail it to your house or your offices but like can you text me after this I got something I want to send you guys.

[24:41] It's you'll love it.

[24:47] Oh my god you got you Aussie guys.

[24:56] Jack that's not the Avatar.

[25:00] Oh man Brian Gilly.

[25:03] Yo Jack how's Brian Gilly's week going like like literally you know like not hearing what I say Brian Gilly Eric Gilly how's Eric Gilly's week going.

[25:14] I don't know man like so I thought like you know I was like oh Eric's been like they're like backstabbing Eric and then I get this like email that's like a savage takedown of Eric and Stern and like you know Seth is is trying to fix things and and shake stuff up and Brian Eddie's kid is part of sales.

[25:42] Like I don't even know if this stuff is valid like this Brian Eddie I have a kid who's part of Stern sales for like all I know is this none of you on Star Wars.

[25:52] The biggest bimbaugh company in the world with the biggest IP of the year fumbled it.

[26:01] Ray Day is going to save it now Ray Day ain't going to save.

[26:06] Now now now every time I see someone on box of Star Wars.

[26:11] Ellie or premium I'm like yeah that's cool man that's cool hey Chico you could have just gone out back and let some money on fire bro because you can get the same game in three months for two to three thousand dollars less.

[26:26] Good job buying it now.

[26:28] Beetle juice is going to knock it down I can't wait walking dead will not be at expo.

[26:33] Not only that I've heard about the walking dead remastered I'm not gang I'm hearing it's not going to like.

[26:40] It's not going to like whoa it's not going to make your jaw drop.

[26:44] I what I'm hearing is the next Stern cornerstone will be at CES and I believe it's going to be transformers and it'll have the full spike three platform CES it's usually January.

[27:14] I don't know who to blame I don't really care about blame I don't I don't blame anybody for Star Wars I don't I don't blame anybody.

[27:29] I just think the game is mediocre it's last creativity and it's it's a silly by it 13.

[27:39] You know to me there's like one part on Star Wars every time I see it on like this company is out of ideas you want to know what that part is that every time I look at Star Wars Ellie.

[27:50] And I look at this one part of it you know it's kind of like putting a you take a beautiful mall it's not even a beautiful pin but you take a beautiful car.

[28:02] And you just put like a clown nose on the front you know what I'm saying like.

[28:07] The one part whenever I see it on Star Wars Ellie I'm like this company is out of ideas and they don't know what to do and they're just it's that little.

[28:18] Is it the ad at on the side armor next to the flipper button there's like a.

[28:26] Image of a let me let me put it up because it's just like hold on it's so embarrassingly bad.

[28:37] Star Wars pinball Ellie fall of empire which is really appropriately titled let me see if I can get a high res of this thing.

[28:54] I mean it's just it's so embarrassing hold on and I'm going to flip it around so you guys can see here.

[29:06] Share screen.

[29:12] I mean it's this look at that I mean this is quite honestly the most embarrassing like your your your out of ideas when you're a company and this is that's the best you can do like it doesn't even look good.

[29:32] This whole thing like it's so bad.

[29:39] And I love watching like Stern put this stuff out in the world.

[29:49] And thinking we're going to spend 13,000 dollars on it I mean it's embarrassing and I think you know.

[29:56] The stern Apologist out there I don't even know like how you even defend this stuff.

[30:08] They all look so bad it's so low effort.

[30:13] And you know again I just think.

[30:18] I don't know I don't know if I want to say this but like.

[30:22] I really think stern Ellie stands for loser edition now.

[30:28] I mean I have five years of data that actually supports that that stern Ellie now stands for stern loser edition.

[30:41] You're losing money.

[30:44] You lost money on food you lost money on James Bond you lost money on venom you lost money on John Wick you lost money on Star Wars you lost money on jaws now it is below 13 now you lost money on dungeons and dragons you bought the loser edition.

[31:06] For over 10 years not a single person ever lost a dime on a stern Ellie.

[31:13] And this is the part that nobody wants to address at that organization from WWE to Mustang it doesn't matter what the game was you never lost anything.

[31:25] Now we have four years in a row of every Ellie you are losing money at best you're losing 500 at worst you're losing 5000 go look at John Wick Ellie's now 85 hundred eight thousand dollars on the table if you want to move one quickly.

[31:46] The stern loser edition and I told those guys if you want to fix this company you need to fix that first and you're going to put up that crap I'm the Star Wars armor set George at the best you could do.

[32:04] That's the best you could do this little out of stick up.

[32:09] It's wrong with you guys wake up she goes.

[32:14] Wake up I know you sold to all of us board cargo short wearing mofos for like a decade and we handed our money over.

[32:26] We handed it over but I'm not doing it I'm keeping my money in the ostrich skin baby.

[32:33] ostrich skin.

[32:38] Feel that Seth smell that money in there you're not getting it brother because you stuck in at at sticker on the side of crappy side armor for 13 thousand dollars I have to make 26 thousand dollars.

[32:59] Before taxes to buy a little at at stick a chicco and then you want to send that game over to Europe and charge like 18 for it and then news idiots in Australia spending like 19 21 thousand on every Ellie Marty Robbins shoes are still missing where you at Marty.

[33:19] Come on what happened to Jeff T. O. this is effort to get Marty Robbins back into the hobby they failed you stole our money Marty you stole our money I have friends that lost 18 thousand five hundred dollars on a centaur and they never got their damn bike helmet or leather jacket Marty.

[33:42] Sell your little couches sell your little sneakers on the real real whatever they call it over there in Australia pay those people back nobody talks about haggis no more you can you just get to rob two million dollars from people in the pinball hobby and then what what is Damian hard into the cell is lotus we just let them go.

[34:04] We just let them go skip be Kevin coolic we let him go people saw match shows did nothing.

[34:15] Keep in the 13 thousand in the ostrich skin baby canada keeps coming at with these weird assing now that he's a people can't figure out.

[34:25] You know but all is going to be good because barrels of funds got a new hire what what David what what stop stop stop stop stop stop stop you got to sell doons brother I don't want to hear about some new do joining the company's not going to sell you one more doon or one more labring.

[34:46] I keep telling David like he's David stuck in his place we just I want to get credit I want to get credit for what we have the David make a theme people want brothers stop with all the nonsense make a theme for a grown man that's been laid like seriously like that's that's my brief to David Vaness make a theme for a grown man that's been laid.

[35:12] Labron Timothy Shama Leidune what what are we doing here.

[35:21] What are we doing here.

[35:24] Come on what's next what's next you know.

[35:28] Beaches the first what you know sisterhood of the traveling pants okay what are we doing here.

[35:36] All right so sad boy just gave another 50 bucks woman to read this email I read this email I don't really care.

[35:45] Now I'm reading this with the caveat that you know I look I there's two sides to every story.

[35:51] And this is a this is a side of the story so let me let me let me pull it up.

[36:02] Let's see let me let me let's see.

[36:14] All right can I read this.

[36:23] All right you guys ready.

[36:27] You got Eric Gilly all wrong the guy is a hot headed battle axe that strong arms dealers with complete and other BS the

[36:40] Fingai was supposed to be gone a long time ago they moved him over to Europe sales a while back when Eddie's kids started working with them.

[36:51] He's a okay I'm not going to read this next it's a little little too drug it he's something strong arms dealers and makes them jump through hoops over everything.

[37:01] The report cards and being penalized for not following their every little micromanage reporting mechanisms or if we report incorrectly then they

[37:12] F with allocations and put limits on them to outright calling our content creator a fraud because he doesn't have an online presence when we put in our M.D.F.

[37:24] Compensation I don't even know what that means does anyone know what that means M.D.F.

[37:31] Compensation also this BS with planetary and CGC planetary acts like CGC gives them allocations based on merit.

[37:41] When planetary has it in there contract to get the biggest allocations but yet pretend it's just because there's such a great company.

[37:52] Stern was not a beloved company they this is where it gets savage people get ready they took Harry Williams's empire and torched it to the ground in order to pave the way for

[38:05] Sam's little boy to run a monopoly on pinball in a strategy that started when Sam got in there and started setting up the hostile two-faced takeover that was a 50 year endeavor.

[38:21] There is a reason that Nordman and Stern cousins in crime made a bunch of turds for Williams.

[38:30] Norman only had a few net positive titles to maintain the illusion while twisting the knife in deeper Williams was able to blast out 200 units a day before the tiny hats got in there and slowly put a stranglehold on Harry's legacy savage take down there not sure who wrote that.

[38:58] But I don't know I can't confirm or deny any of that.

[39:08] Who knows I you know look there there are three sides all these stories.

[39:16] I don't know I don't know.

[39:19] I mean you don't know the truth behind any of this I mean look you know I love you brother but you have absolutely zero zero whoever's writing that clearly has some more specific information than Ian our friend in over at nudge magazine is saying that that is fiction and come on like let's let's not.

[39:39] I know you want to sell some copies of nudge brother but like to say all that is fiction I don't know bro I don't know that like Nordman's been crushing it classic day force.

[39:59] Yeah you know there's like this new thing now where if someone writes anything like anything now it's like everyone accuses of being chat GPT writing I don't even when someone when they were writing that thing the robber complaining about me going to expo there was a someone said that was chat chat GPT I don't know.

[40:23] Look the way I look at all of this is I don't think anybody cares man it's like I just want good good games I mean I don't care what happened in the history of stern pimo I don't care about nipple babies I don't care about Dennis Norman you know he's had enough chances to make hit games in modern times and he hasn't been successful I don't care you know it's not personal it's just like you've been you were given the stage to make a great game and you make galactic tank force you were given the stage.

[40:52] You know at other places and you didn't you didn't make the most of it joe balser was given many moments to make a magical game he didn't do it so like I don't really like in the end like.

[41:03] You know actions speak louder than words and I don't know the history of stern I don't care about the history of stern I really don't I really don't what I want.

[41:10] Is turn to release products that are magical in modern times and they're not doing it right now.

[41:17] And I think there's going to be a real interesting winter when Star Wars sales are not there and walking dead remastered is going to flop and then they're going to have to rush out probably Elliott isman's transformers and I can tell you based on john wick and star wars I bet you transformers is just another stern.

[41:39] And this is the problem is you know just another stern at these prices is the reason why people are just kind of over at all.

[41:47] You know I want more stern with ambitious designs like X men but I think a game like X men need it more time to be perfected and they didn't give it to Jack.

[41:57] And so like you know what do they do they they burn them out they probably they probably approach approach Jack.

[42:06] You know all all great creatives are a little difficult to work with and all great creatives have a little bit of a mixture of arrogance ego and insecurity it is a I've seen it in every industry I've been in the best creatives are a little bipolar by nature.

[42:29] And so like I bet Jack is a little difficult to work with and doesn't want to hear from everyone and you know is a little stubborn at times but in the end it's worth it and I don't think stern knows how to deal with people that are like that and that's why I think we get a lot of mediocrity is I think they want people to just tow the company line.

[42:51] Make the game with the bomb and I'm so happy Steve Richie quit when they wouldn't put stairway to heaven into Led Zeppelin I mean they just think about that for a minute now not that Richie's game was any good.

[43:03] But I love the fact that like that was it you're not going to give the guy you're going to ask the guy to make stairway to heaven and then not put in it.

[43:13] I mean I mean what asked me to make Led Zeppelin and not put stairway to heaven in it.

[43:20] Yeah, for Hedge I the hairs do keep going into my mouth.

[43:26] It's it's a little annoying I but you know I'm I'm committed to this look today it's it's happening thought I thought.

[43:34] I hold on a second let me let me let me go let me go change real quick hold on.

[43:38] Because it is.

[43:41] This thing weighs like 10 pounds.

[43:50] All right.

[43:59] All right.

[44:07] All right, all support brand is company.

[44:10] Bandle.

[44:11] More brand of works.

[44:14] All right, this is much I much more comfortable now.

[44:20] Ah, all right.

[44:25] Oh my God, Francie.

[44:27] Okay, never never keeps it.

[44:33] Now I like I don't.

[44:34] I don't.

[44:37] Hmm.

[44:43] Here's here's the thing.

[44:45] These band can a to t shirts will be available shortly on silver ball swag.

[44:50] The silver ball swag is not going to expo that's why they won't be at the show.

[44:56] But we're going to sell them and and like like Viva LaRaza shirts can a to will get a cut of everyone sold.

[45:03] So that'll be a nice thing.

[45:04] Oh, that'll be a nice thing to do.

[45:06] I'm I'm happy that I have help again making merch.

[45:12] Tell Brandon to stop sending me junk now.

[45:14] No, I know these.

[45:18] Hmm.

[46:21] You know Dave Sanders, man.

[46:23] Ting ran.

[46:24] Ting ran in his hobby is kind of like the sweet spot for most.

[46:30] Majority of people are saying yes.

[46:32] More people know on Facebook here.

[46:35] It's interesting split.

[46:41] Inter I love this split.

[46:43] Pete Rosen.

[46:44] What's up brother?

[46:45] Pete, I miss your 5,000 stars today.

[46:55] True.

[46:56] Thank you, Bill, for not just saying yes, but also who you're buying from.

[47:14] Yeah, we got.

[47:15] 135 people watching right now, which is.

[47:18] Out of this, this is 10% of the potential buyer base of doon pinball.

[47:24] Nope, not me.

[47:26] F that.

[47:27] Okay, sad boys.

[47:28] He's even it's making him upset the question.

[47:36] No.

[47:37] No.

[47:38] Is Tommy here?

[47:42] I did, but switched to Star Wars.

[47:45] Too long of a weight.

[47:48] Why'd you buy Star Wars, Mr. Gunnet?

[47:54] I love it.

[47:55] This guy didn't buy it, but his friend has doon and loves it.

[48:00] Okay, so most people know.

[48:01] Okay, how many of you bought Star Wars fall of the Empire?

[48:07] How many of you saw something the rest of us missed and ordered one of star wars?

[48:12] Star Wars fall of the Empire.

[48:15] No, no.

[48:18] Absolutely not.

[48:21] Hell no.

[48:23] Nah.

[48:26] LOL no.

[48:29] No more new unbox turned for me.

[48:32] I can't afford new unbox.

[48:34] Not a chance. Hell no, hell no, no Star Wars.

[48:36] No doon.

[48:37] Burned by labyrinth.

[48:38] It sucked.

[48:39] I'd be dead.

[48:41] I cussed.

[48:43] I don't know.

[48:45] I'm not a labyrinth.

[48:47] It sucked.

[48:49] I did, but I buy everything.

[48:51] Canceled my Star Wars Ellie, smart move, Matthew, very smart move.

[48:54] I was in on Star Wars Ellie, listen, thank Gunn as, yes, Fizzy.

[48:58] I saved you $2,000.

[48:59] There's nose everywhere.

[49:00] So who bought these games?

[49:02] I haven't seen a single person admit to buying.

[49:05] This is the problem now.

[49:07] money, but now when you publicly admit you got your hands on the latest

[49:12] sternalee, people are like, you're a loser.

[49:17] Where's it this one? I don't know. It's backwards on like my Facebook.

[49:21] Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Stern has turned its own

[49:25] collectible product into a joke. And it's what I told them a year ago,

[49:32] they had an entire year to rethink their Ellie strategy. And they just don't know how to do it.

[49:41] You know what happened with them is like a few things. They still don't have the themes people want.

[49:46] Be they're not making their games stand out enough. And they still don't know how to just like

[49:52] consistently roll it back to 500 Ellie's. And that's it forever. And never make more. They don't know

[50:00] what they don't know. They're like afraid to do that. They know they know the pressures of what

[50:06] they need to achieve, but they don't understand like when you limit the Ellie's and you make them

[50:11] special again and you make them worth money on the second hand market. I mean over MSRP,

[50:18] you got to figure out how to get there because that is what will lift the premium and the pro sales.

[50:24] The reason why premium and pro sales were so good is that we legitimately were most people were

[50:30] locked out of the Elise. And so it and you didn't feel so bad because only 500 and it was hard to get.

[50:36] And those things are not moving or trading hands very often. Nowadays it's like only an idiot buys a

[50:42] premium for 10 because you could get the Ellie for 10 in like two months. So they they've really

[50:47] created this like how secards has come down on their entire marketing strategy. Their entire golden

[50:54] goose they had they killed it. And when the house of cards falls, everyone's losing now significantly.

[51:00] So it's like it's like the only kind of smart buy is like the Stern pro.

[51:06] You know, it's like they flipped the whole thing on its head. It used to be pros for hose. Like you bought

[51:10] a pro, you know, you were a hoe. Like you just couldn't, you know, it made sense for operators.

[51:16] But nowadays it's like if you buy a Stern pro, you're basically playing the same exact game as

[51:21] everybody else, probably better because there's more flow in the game and you're not going to lose so

[51:26] much money. You know what I'm saying? You buy a pro for like six, you're going to sell for five.

[51:30] Maybe at most you lose a grand. You buy an LE, you can lose five grand on an LE.

[51:36] And they didn't see the problem in that and they didn't figure out a solution to that. They had a

[51:39] whole year to figure out a solution to that. So I don't really care where they send John

[51:43] Bruce Gagliad, Europe or Eric Gilley over here screaming about something or how how he hates

[51:49] all his eight years of work for now. I don't care. I don't set you come from Disney's George,

[51:54] you you guys like literally, literally these aren't very, here's the problem. I want to break it

[52:00] down right now. This is the main problem. This is why Stern pinball I think will ultimately,

[52:07] ultimately drive themselves out of business. And I mean this and I don't want them to, but here's

[52:12] the problem. Here's the here's the big mistake there. This is the problem with the industry they're

[52:18] in and the lack of understanding of this industry by the people they're bringing in to guide them

[52:26] from a marketing and strategy standpoint. The problem is this. It's one thing. If you have a product,

[52:34] a universal product that is consistently the same and you want to grow sales, right? So if I want

[52:41] to take a snicker bar, which is amazing and people in America love it and I want to increase the

[52:47] sales of snickers, then I can introduce snickers in interesting ways to Latin America, to China,

[52:54] to Japan, find where people have sweet tooths and introduce them to this delicious candy bar

[53:00] that never changes, right? It never changes. A snickers bar is always a snickers bar. A bottle of

[53:06] Jamison is always a bottle of Jamison. A bud light is always a bud light. The problem with pinball

[53:12] and trying to just grow it exponentially is that at the same time you're trying to introduce it

[53:19] to new markets, the product itself is radically changing every three months. So what once was a delicious

[53:27] snicker bar, aka Godzilla Ellie at $10,000, what once was a delicious bar that a lot of people

[53:35] said, hey, I like this. I like this product at this price. I'm willing to go in on this. You then

[53:43] are trying to scale up as the product is changing and all of a sudden that delicious snicker bar

[53:50] doesn't taste so good anymore. All of a sudden it tastes a little bit sour. All of a sudden,

[53:57] you know, people aren't enjoying it. And so like every three months, it's turned as a new game,

[54:01] or every four months, a new game, which radically changes the product, right? Because you can't just be

[54:08] like, it's almost like they have this arrogance, this delusion that people just love pinball so much

[54:16] that if you just keep serving up more pinball, regardless of how good the game is, regardless of

[54:21] how magical it is, like they'll absorb it. Yeah, and that works with the diehard, enthusiast side of

[54:28] the buyer base, which they ignored and turned their back on. So the only people that actually have

[54:34] that mindset are the pinheads, are the people on pin sight, are the subscribers to Canadian

[54:40] pinball podcasts, are the people, the only people that actually treat this as a lifestyle brand,

[54:45] are the people that think about it day in and day out every single week. And they turn their back

[54:50] on those people in a mission to attract new audiences to the brand. They turn their back

[55:02] on the only people that like keep them in business, basically. And so yeah, I don't believe Neil

[55:09] McCray, when he's like, Stern's got a back order, like, you know, as long as you're armed,

[55:14] well, maybe, maybe my arm, my arm, Neil is maybe what, two feet long. Yeah, maybe they only have

[55:21] two feet of orders when they need, when they need a country mile back order list to justify

[55:27] the size of the company. So I'm just saying like, I think they don't kind of get it. It's like,

[55:35] it's like they had a moment of like Godzilla, most popular game of all time, COVID frenzy. And like

[55:43] everything we do from a company standpoint is going to be based on us expecting tomorrow to be

[55:50] as good as today. Tomorrow is going to be even better than today. So we're going to scale up

[55:57] and we're going to see the same results we see in 2021, every single year, as we release dog games,

[56:05] like John Wick, like Venom dog games like King Kong, like we're just going to keep growing. And

[56:10] people are going to keep buying all this and we're going to make 500 to 800 games a week.

[56:15] And here we are. Here we are. And the problem now is, is how do you get smaller and better?

[56:26] Not bigger and worse. And they're stuck in a place now where they need growth. And this is the

[56:34] problem is they're not a publicly traded company. Stern Pimball growing too quickly or too big

[56:44] is like such a silly internal self inflicted wound. You know what I'm saying? They don't, none of us

[56:51] are investors in Stern Pimball. There's no outside people making money on Stern. They did this to

[56:57] themselves. So what I don't get is if they had stayed in the old factory and been a little bit

[57:04] smaller and leaner, their margins would be better. They would make more money per game. You know what I'm

[57:13] saying? They could probably cut 50 employees and make more money. Instead, they're like, they became

[57:19] so big and now the pressure is on. And why? Like why? Like why do you need to keep growing?

[57:27] It doesn't make any sense to me because you legitimately could just have it really good at this

[57:35] volume every year forever. Is it not enough to make your $10 million, $20 million, $30 million

[57:45] profit, whatever it is. So you put all that at risk to grow to a level that the consultants said you

[57:53] could reach and your consultants don't know jack shit about Pimball. The outside people that you

[58:00] brought in don't know jack shit about Pimball. And the people that know about Pimball, you turned

[58:08] your back on. I don't know any other way to look at this. I'm not wrong. They're stressed out. It's not

[58:19] working. You know, they they um they wanted to find a buyer. They wanted to find a buyer.

[58:31] And they didn't find one. And man, those books look good, right? Those books looked real good in 2021.

[58:41] The sales looked good. The data on the second hand value was incredible. Those books looked real good.

[58:49] They had a little window where they could have like, could jolt someone in the buy. You know,

[58:55] my brother, my other brother, he sold his liquor store. He had a liquor store. It was successful

[59:03] making good money. And he sold it at the height of COVID to a nice Korean couple.

[59:12] And you know, he was telling me, he was like, you know, they after a year later, they call me up.

[59:16] They're like, why aren't sales where they were? Well, you know, it's like COVID created a boom

[59:21] in liquor sales. People are going out more. People are spending money on other stuff. Like,

[59:26] it's not going to be what it was. You know, you got to you got to always, you know, plan for the best,

[59:33] but expect the worst. I know what I know for I know for exactly what Stern Pimbal was asking

[59:46] as to buy them. Okay. I know I know exactly what it was.

[59:57] And it's not a crazy number. All things considered. The problem is is who wants to absorb the headache?

[01:00:10] You know what I'm saying? It's like, it's not like your because again, like, if I was buying

[01:00:13] Snickers, you know, I'm saying, if like if I was buying Snickers and Snickers sales were this good,

[01:00:22] year over year, I'm willing to buy Snickers for this much money because I'm, you know, I might

[01:00:29] take a little bit of a loss in the next three to four years, but I see the future. The problem with

[01:00:34] buying Stern is you got to think about like the uncertainty of what you're actually buying.

[01:00:43] Because I can't, you know, look, they could show me all the data in the world about how successful

[01:00:50] all those older games were, but I can't make those games again. Because if I make those games again,

[01:00:57] I'm going to like burn all the customers and they'll never buy for me again. So what I now need to do

[01:01:03] is R&D games as good as those games, but I'm, but I'm still fucked. I'm sorry to curse on this,

[01:01:09] but I think I need to curse. I'm still fucked because I can't make a game as good as Lord of the Rings

[01:01:17] because even if I did, I have to charge twice as much as Lord of the Rings cost. And it's going to

[01:01:24] cost me maybe even twice as much to even make it from a manufacturing. It's just like for it to make

[01:01:31] sense for those numbers to work out for any future owner of Stern, you need to feel like you consistently

[01:01:37] will have hits. And then I would be like, and the vulnerability of like, what if Keith Owens leaves?

[01:01:44] What if Jack Danger left? Like just think about the reality of that. If Keith Owens left tomorrow

[01:01:52] and went to JJP, it would just be an instant kill shot.

[01:02:00] And again, like like spooky pinball only needs to sell. They only need to sell a thousand games a year.

[01:02:10] Same thing with barrels, same thing with Dutch. Not even Dutch like Dutch makes like 500 a year.

[01:02:16] I mean, Stern is how are they going to keep selling hundreds a week of mediocrity?

[01:02:29] And my connection's unstable. Let me try to let me shut some stuff down. Hold on a second,

[01:02:34] force quit. Stern is trying to pull the plug. They're trying to pull the plug on my show.

[01:02:40] This should help all this stuff open.

[01:02:56] That should be better. All right.

[01:03:02] Sorry about the

[01:03:03] I

[01:03:09] know it's crazy now all of a sudden I have a hundred and 44 viewers now 120 one. I feel like the

[01:03:16] moment I start talking this, there's like like a like a back phone goes off at Stern and they all

[01:03:20] start listening. I'm like, I mean, the answer is so simple. Get back to your roots. Get back to

[01:03:29] what made you great. Get back to what made you successful. It's not about the money. It's about

[01:03:38] the brand. It's about the way they talk to the community. We're not we don't want patches. We don't

[01:03:46] need badges. You know, Stern's big mistake is they went all in on insider connected and they

[01:03:53] they thought that insider. All right. Let's see. Did they get me? Did they knock me out?

[01:04:03] Are we back? I feel like I feel like the Stern's.

[01:04:11] Look, here's the thing. Here's the thing. I don't mind insider connected gang. I think it adds

[01:04:17] great replay value to the machines. But man, it's like you know what the strategy was.

[01:04:27] It was to get everybody connected and then sell you DLC. But I can why? Why? When you are making good

[01:04:37] margin per game sold. Why? Like why do you need to see how much you can bleed?

[01:04:48] Your your community. You know, the notion that I would buy something for $13,000, a toy.

[01:04:58] And it's incomplete. And I have to spend more to get the full game.

[01:05:06] You know, Stern, Fortnite is free. It's free. I don't mind spending a few bucks on DLC

[01:05:16] for a free video game that by the way is a hundred times better engineer than anything you've ever

[01:05:24] made in the pinball spit. There's a reason why these games are you know, these like grant

[01:05:28] a thought like I will spend a hundred dollars on grant that thought of six. And it'll run circles

[01:05:33] around enjoyment levels. And that's the problem, Stern is like all right. When people have like five

[01:05:37] to ten pinball machines in their home, you don't think you know these guys will find other areas of

[01:05:44] entertainment for this much money. They don't like or just don't get more. You know what I'm saying?

[01:05:50] You have five to ten great pinball machines. Wait, what's why would you buy like a Star Wars

[01:05:56] Elite for 13 when you can go buy a Nintendo Switch 2 and play Donkey Kong Benanza and for like

[01:06:03] freaking $490, you can have more fun for months than the price of a Stern topper.

[01:06:12] I don't get it. Look, Anthony, nobody cares about King Kong though. It's like I get it.

[01:06:27] All the code in the world will never have the right assets for King Kong. It doesn't matter how

[01:06:33] much fun they may it's like the game the game is tainted now because the game is symbolic of

[01:06:40] cutting corners. And if they couldn't get the assets, then Stern should have came out and explain

[01:06:50] why they don't have the assets when they can get everything for Godzilla. Happy Saturday everybody.

[01:06:58] I don't know, you know, look, I've just I've felt this way lately and I'll say it again.

[01:07:04] I think when you become more content with who you are, content with what you have, you will be

[01:07:15] happier that that happiness is not defined by consuming more new stuff that brings very little

[01:07:27] new value into your life. And unfortunately, you know, for these like these big pinball companies

[01:07:36] that need to sell thousands of games a year, they are going to struggle with that.

[01:07:44] And it's not that we don't we won't buy new stuff, but to actually feel like I need this new game,

[01:07:52] it's going to make my life better. And at these prices, it needs to be magical. And it's just that

[01:07:59] simple. And everything else is going to be dead on arrival. And I think Beetlejuice is going to

[01:08:05] fly off the shelves back to the future is going to fly off the shelves. They're going to sell all

[01:08:09] razas when they make raza. There will be much less than 500 razas. You know, it's just the way it is

[01:08:18] now. And I don't, you know, I love covering this hobby. I cannot tell you the amount of fulfillment I

[01:08:29] get from making content in pinball. I've met some of my best friends in this hobby. I've lost some

[01:08:37] great friends in this hobby. I've had some friends politically like quit me because I didn't vote for

[01:08:45] Kamala Harris. Like I don't care. Like fine. I don't it's not that I love

[01:08:52] Donald. I just, you know, if you go back and watch some of those Kamala Harris interviews, like I

[01:08:57] don't care. Like the word salad answers to everything dodged a bullet. Now, now we've got at least a

[01:09:05] piece treaty happening in the Middle East that nobody wants to give the dude credit for. I mean,

[01:09:08] at least he got it done. You think she could have got that deal done? You think she got a got,

[01:09:11] you think Kamala Harris could have talked to Hamas and Nandin Yahoo and and brokered something? Come on.

[01:09:18] Again, don't have to like the man, but can like the results. And again, like I'm very in the middle.

[01:09:24] I'll lean left and right. But you know, if I had to make a decision, who's right for the climate

[01:09:30] of the world right now? We got war going on. We got this going on. We got this going on. Like we

[01:09:33] got people just running through the borders. Like who's right right now? Who's right? Right. You know,

[01:09:37] we want to we want to put men on to women's sports teams so they can beat them up and

[01:09:44] walk through the locker rooms with their penises hanging out. Like sorry, sorry for the language,

[01:09:48] but come on. Silly times are over. Common sense. And both parties are going to have to speak

[01:09:55] common sense. I think they want to win. I mean, that's just where we're at. Common sense is most

[01:09:59] important. How's inflation going? I don't know. You know what the inflation was in the 1980s,

[01:10:07] Tolbert? Like 18%. Now that was the interest rates. Whatever. Just make more money. I don't care.

[01:10:17] You know what I'm saying? Like you got to make more. You got to find ways to make money.

[01:10:21] Sorry, Cory. Back to Pimball. It's funny. It's like whatever. Man, I care. Like you know me. You

[01:10:27] guys know me by now. I'm not like some political extremist on either side. I just love that like,

[01:10:35] you know, we live in a world now where if people, if people do something good, like even if you don't

[01:10:41] like them, like, okay, it's okay to say good job. Anyway, yeah, I agree. I hate politics. I

[01:10:52] absolutely hate it because I, but I also think discourse is important and we, you can't just like

[01:10:58] shut down discourse. I'm just gonna, but the final thing I'm gonna say is this and I mean this when

[01:11:03] I say this. The number one problem in culture nowadays are the universities. They are raising these

[01:11:11] kids to be victims and they're raising these kids to have stupid points of view on the world.

[01:11:19] They're like, can I just give you an example? I was hanging out with one of our Gen Z employees and

[01:11:26] we were going around the table. What are your hobbies? You know, people are like, oh, tennis, golf,

[01:11:30] Pimball, boom, boom, boom. We land on the young Gen Z employee. And this is with a client,

[01:11:38] like a founder of a company that makes a hundred million dollars a year.

[01:11:42] You know what she says her hobby is, you know what she says? They did, these are kids. What's your

[01:11:50] hobby? She says sustainability as her hobby. The fuck? Sustainability as a hobby.

[01:12:01] Like what, what, who, how did we get here? Like how did we actually raise kids to consider

[01:12:11] sustainability as a hobby? Like you could be for sustainability. I get that. Like you could be an

[01:12:18] environmentalist, but it's not hobby. Like what are you doing? You're going around like replacing

[01:12:23] plastic straws, which by the way, paper straws suck. Have you ever had like a moment with a

[01:12:31] paper straw and you're just like, I don't care how bad this is for the environment. I want a

[01:12:38] plastic straw with my McDonald's milkshake. All right. Literally you could take everything

[01:12:46] else from me, but give me my thick McDonald's milkshake straw back. Okay. And keep boys out of

[01:12:57] women's locker rooms. Can we just start there? Carluts. Yeah.

[01:13:11] Now it's sad to me. It's sad to me because like it is. Like it is. Like, you know, the reason

[01:13:14] why I do love this community is this hobby is you guys are like, you weren't a hobby. I mean,

[01:13:20] we're literally in a hobby. Every few weeks we get to talk about a new game, a move by a company.

[01:13:28] It's great. It's great. Yeah.

[01:13:34] Cari, I'm so happy we're done. I'm so happy we're done with this rollout of these

[01:13:40] pinball legends figures. Is anyone else like feel my excitement that it's over?

[01:13:45] You know, you know, Cari and I are good friends with Melvin and like I legit told Melvin I was

[01:13:49] like, bro, I don't what what is this? This like slow. He's like, I'm gonna give it to

[01:13:54] Cari. I love it because like Melvin was acting as if like I would be upset. I wasn't upset at all.

[01:14:00] Be honest. Like the silhouette first. Then the fit like I just like moment. Like I don't just

[01:14:06] release them all at once. Sell them. You know, the price is not bad. Just didn't need this like week

[01:14:13] long rollout.

[01:14:20] How many are there? I only saw two. There's like six Dave saying there's just like six.

[01:14:29] Oh, you know what I love about being a father of two young boys is like the honesty that's in

[01:14:36] this household. Like I know exactly who I am now more than ever. Like I love being a dad.

[01:14:42] I love being a dad so much. I feel like half of my life I was rudderless

[01:14:48] and just lost and all about me and all about my own enjoyment. It's so rewarding to see life

[01:15:02] develop and and seeing young Cassian beginning to form words and he just hearing how my kids talk

[01:15:08] and process the world and the way they the way they are reminds me of like what makes life so damn

[01:15:17] special and what childhood is so damn special and I can't wait to continue to raise these two

[01:15:23] little boys to be gentlemen but to have fun to get out there to enjoy this world. The short time

[01:15:29] we have enjoy it. Don't spend it online trying to change the world. It's addictive man. I was

[01:15:37] doomed scrolling last night at three in the morning. They just keep serving me like Bill Marclips or

[01:15:42] something. You know, it's like you can't help but watch all this stuff. You can go from like

[01:15:46] the algorithms. They know what we want. You know, I get fed the pinball stuff. I get fed like

[01:15:52] political stuff. Automotive. It's like it knows everything about me. Transformers. I care bearers

[01:15:57] hats. Like I've probably bought more dumb stuff recently like cheap stuff just from

[01:16:03] Facebook algorithms knowing if we show canada this Starscream jockstrap he's gonna want it

[01:16:11] and who knew I wanted a Starscream jockstrap but apparently I do. No joking but

[01:16:18] you know, it's really a fun time to be alive and you know for those people that think the world

[01:16:25] is like going to hell in a handbag life is better now than it's ever been for the majority of people

[01:16:30] that ever lived on planet earth. There's more opportunity now for more people than there's ever

[01:16:35] been on planet earth. There's more diversity living together than there ever has been on planet earth.

[01:16:41] So for all the people that feel like being alive today you're a victim of something or like life

[01:16:47] was better back in you know ancestral times wake up it wasn't this is it if you have a good idea

[01:16:55] and you're legally allowed to be in a country you can be very successful and you can climb up the

[01:17:00] ladder and yeah it takes a lot of something that nobody wants to do anymore you know what it takes

[01:17:05] work and work takes a long time and making money and building wealth is slow and arduous unless you

[01:17:15] have like a crazy investment that pops which is basically the same as winning the lottery it takes

[01:17:22] work and we all work hard for a pinball and that is why as I look at the pinball landscape let's go

[01:17:29] over each company right now real quick analysis stern pinball they're in the doghouse they are

[01:17:36] painted themselves in a corner no one wants star wars nobody's gonna go out they're walking

[01:17:40] dead remastered I've already heard from people that have seen it it is not gonna set the world on

[01:17:44] fire which means we're gonna get nothing very interesting until we get Elliott Eismans Transformers

[01:17:51] maybe sometime in December January most likely January at CES so nothing from stern until after

[01:17:58] beetle juice beetle juice spooky pinball is next game gonna be a juggernaut hit for the company

[01:18:05] gonna instantly sell out I think it's gonna change the guard of pinball I think france is gonna make

[01:18:09] the most beautiful pinball machine of all time I think bug and Luke and everybody over there

[01:18:14] are gonna make sure this game is a new level of special and I think it's gonna change pinball like

[01:18:21] like it's gonna be it's gonna do for pinball what Godzilla did for stern this is gonna be what

[01:18:27] it does for the boutiques I think it's gonna raise the bar of what boutiques can make

[01:18:32] and I think the other boutiques are gonna witness the possibilities of what they can do they need

[01:18:38] to stop making stupid themes that nobody wants stop making you know predator without Arnold stop

[01:18:43] making Timothy Shama-lae dune games get where it's at it's with nostalgia it's with games that

[01:18:51] connect emotionally with people and it's about understanding what your target audience wants

[01:18:56] it's really easy you know as I told David vines you know David vines is like Chris I got five

[01:19:01] titles I said David I can tell you four of them are gonna suck that was pretty mean I can be mean

[01:19:07] at times he's like Chris I got five themes I'm like I can tell you right now without you telling me

[01:19:13] that four of them are gonna suck he's like whoa how do you know that I'm like because you picked them

[01:19:18] you picked them that's how I know I love you David vines I'm looking right at you brother

[01:19:30] what you need to do you need to hire canada as a consultant I'll consult on the themes I'll help

[01:19:39] your creative people understand what needs to be in these games but like never would have landed

[01:19:45] under they I made my friends over there they've stopped talking to me like they like legit like I

[01:19:50] used to be my good buddies they don't talk to me anymore they should have spoke up you know there's

[01:19:55] an old there's a great saying I want to read it for you right now because this is like to me

[01:20:01] this is what David vines is biggest problem is and and I think he needs to like

[01:20:16] I want to read this quote

[01:20:26] and I think it's the smartest quote ever and it's by Norman Vincent Peele

[01:20:35] the trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise

[01:20:42] I

[01:20:45] added a dinner let me set the trouble with most of us is we would rather be ruined by praise

[01:20:51] than saved by criticism and I know I take a quote like this and it makes me feel good because I

[01:20:58] feel like I do feel like I'm trying to save these companies from making bad decisions

[01:21:04] and I think David vines is in that campaign like he'd rather be ruined by praise than saved by

[01:21:08] criticism because the criticisms are what are going to help all these companies and I think spooky

[01:21:14] pimple is the opposite I think spooky pimple was saved by criticisms I think they heard all the

[01:21:21] criticisms and they improved but if we praised rob zombie and we praised rick and morty and we

[01:21:30] praised Halloween and we praised ultra man and there are those people out there and that's why like I

[01:21:36] do believe like the guys like Colin you know who come out and say like we're all about

[01:21:43] pimple positivity and that's what we just need is every content creator should just be about spreading

[01:21:49] pimple positivity so cool Colin you know you're the kind of guy that wants to ruin people with praise

[01:21:57] because I haven't seen you like save any company with criticism

[01:22:00] and when I look at the pimple hobby and I look at the companies that are now friendly with me

[01:22:07] that I've like listened to a lot of the advice I've been giving over the last decade I've they've

[01:22:12] they've been successful the ones that never listen to me I'm fine I haven't been wrong I'm still

[01:22:18] here I'm still doing this CGC you know the thing about CGC pad is this they they're a

[01:22:29] unique organization because their the pimple is not their annuity Chicago gaming company is a

[01:22:37] byproduct of Churchill cabinets they make all of their money on the other side of the fence

[01:22:42] the pimple is like is the hobby of CGC they don't need it to survive

[01:22:50] so they can take their time so they can not talk to their customers so they can do every I get it

[01:22:54] I just don't like a company like that I don't like a company that

[01:23:01] eventually gets around to handing in the homework I just I personally don't like

[01:23:08] how they operate as an organization it doesn't excite me I don't want to go on those journeys

[01:23:15] with them and I don't even feel like I know them as an organization and I know franchy I know

[01:23:21] bug I know Luke I know Ben Heck I know Don who's now over there I like that I know who these people

[01:23:28] are I know Seth I know Gary I know George I know Jack I know you know I've heard of Keith I don't

[01:23:33] know Keith Owen I like that at least know who these people are you know and I think it matters I

[01:23:41] know Brett I know Tom Capara I know Eric Minier Minier Eric Minier you know I know Steve Richie

[01:23:51] I mean when I meet Steve Richie at a bar like he's nice to me we have a great photo with Kale Steve Richie

[01:23:57] me at the avatar launch Mark Sidon like these are you know I know all these people now knowing them

[01:24:05] personally helps a lot doesn't change how I feel about their games I'm I do think like you know

[01:24:12] like Mark Sidon's a good example it's like it's like if you praise avatar you literally you will

[01:24:18] you will ruin Mark Sidon as a as a designer but if you criticize avatar in the right way

[01:24:25] like these lower playfields are not fun like maybe you put too much effort and bomb into something

[01:24:31] that's not rewarding for the player that will save Mark Sidon's career he'll do better he won't

[01:24:38] make the same mistake twice you know again most people would rather be ruined by praise then saved

[01:24:47] by criticism so it's a quote to live by hard to do hard to exercise and look there's a there's an

[01:24:57] important balance between empathy criticism and you know people's feelings because you have to be

[01:25:05] hard on the work not on the people it's it's hard thing to do it's a hard thing to do

[01:25:09] well I mean I'm reading about the quality of these Merlin editions and it seems pretty you know

[01:25:22] imbalanced of course Roger Sharp is a nice man nobody's like there's not like you're not going

[01:25:29] to meet many people in pimple in real life that are jerks you're not absolutely not

[01:25:35] and that's what that's what kills them about canada go into these shows it's not that I'm going to be toxic

[01:25:41] it's not that I'm going to be dramatic it's that I'm going to be nice you know what you know I'm

[01:25:46] saying like when these pin-side babies who call me all sorts of names like you know why they don't

[01:25:52] want to come up to me at a show because they don't want to be wrong about me you know they don't

[01:25:59] want to be wrong and they don't want to have an open mind about me they'd rather sit in the corner

[01:26:04] and type away on pin-side there goes that loser wearing you know silly clothes like he's such a

[01:26:09] jump in real life like you know he's he's 90 pounds wet like you know like okay or you could come

[01:26:17] over and we could have a fun conversation about pinball and you could put your drinks on my tab

[01:26:22] which you won't do for anybody you know when when when they have the pin-side meeting greed

[01:26:31] is that all on the house because canada's will be at expo so if you're going to expo

[01:26:36] will be drinking my card will be down and none of you are going to have to pay for it

[01:26:46] that's how I roll you're my fans you contribute every month

[01:26:50] you know so they they would rather just go back to me throwing a drink in Tim

[01:27:04] sex and face as a sign that I'm a jerk and I look I've done jerky things I've been in a hole at

[01:27:09] times I mean I would love to meet the man who hasn't ever lost his cool or done something

[01:27:16] they regret I would love that perfect person to expose themselves to us and be the modern day

[01:27:22] Jesus I don't think there's a pin-side meeting greed I don't I think there's a is there a media mixer

[01:27:30] is there I think people forget I mean it was Colin who said he was going to call the cops if I

[01:27:36] showed about the media mixer that time he said the authorities will be notified if I show but

[01:27:44] the media mixer that was that was like last time I know francie can you imagine like just just

[01:27:51] that 9-1-1 call he's here with his Louis Vuitton and his ostrich skin briefcase

[01:28:03] smell it's vintage but this is my grandfather's my grandfather had good taste the my my grandparents

[01:28:09] came from some from Italy from Sicily some from Greece no money whatsoever they were broke my

[01:28:17] grandfather worked in the textile business my other grandfather had a a diner a restaurant in

[01:28:21] New Jersey made all the sacrifices in the world put my dad through college made my dad pay them

[01:28:29] back for college because they didn't have any money and now he was pretty successful and

[01:28:38] very successful I would say in the world of pharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions

[01:28:44] we now live in a beautiful town the grandchildren are happy

[01:28:49] people want to hate on america it's funny to me I hate like they're like they didn't they had no

[01:28:53] privilege they had no privilege they had no privilege my aunt who was a fashion designer sold

[01:29:02] her business you know she she kind of pissed it all away because she didn't have children and she

[01:29:07] didn't make a smart financial decision but she sold her business in the 80s for millions of dollars

[01:29:13] no there was no me too movement there was no no one to help her out no there was no social media there

[01:29:20] was no she didn't she didn't act a victim she wasn't a victim of anything she was just talented

[01:29:28] and and and did what she loved we raised these damn kids to think they're victims to think they're

[01:29:34] all victims and the victims are always losers no one's a victim here no one's a victim of anyone

[01:29:41] else's privilege or anyone else's opportunities are unequal it's such BS BS and I will never

[01:29:48] apologize for the success of my family for the success of my friends for the success of any of you

[01:29:54] I will never apologize that we all worked hard enough to make enough money to buy

[01:30:00] pinball machines right should I make you feel guilty should I tell you that they're starving children

[01:30:07] in the world and how dare you how dare you show your inequality to those individuals because you

[01:30:14] want to like have a little fun for you know in your spare time it's the greatest country in the

[01:30:20] world no one else can do it like this nobody you know my my sister-in-law came from the Netherlands

[01:30:25] right she's in the Netherlands and of course she's at university in Amsterdam and she's like

[01:30:32] everyone hates America and then she comes here to this town and she's like this is nothing like I

[01:30:41] thought and then she's like why are there US flags everywhere I mean because we love we love

[01:30:47] everyone who's here everyone is here like they made it here like I one of my neighbors here like

[01:30:53] I could tell she's like crazy all the way to Leva yeah I just got back from Spain I'm like where did

[01:30:59] you make all your money you keep you act like you don't like America like you're ashamed of America

[01:31:04] let me just ask where did you make all your money and then she shut up right away got back into

[01:31:10] her like $100,000 Audi EV Audi SUV and goes and you know drives to go get her lobster rolls in

[01:31:19] America I love you guys if I did more more of this talk I'd have much bigger follow I'm telling you

[01:31:32] how you guys doing

[01:31:32] I look I just love being alive I love the opportunities I've been given and I love

[01:31:43] that we found each other in this hobby I mean that's that's kind of where I'm at

[01:31:48] and I think when you wake up every day you can choose to be a victim you can choose to complain

[01:31:52] about everything and look complaining about Pim on machines is fun isn't it it's a way more fun

[01:31:57] for us to complain about like why'd you make doom why is an Arnold in predator

[01:32:03] you know we're like these middle age men yelling at the pinball clouds like it's fun it's fun

[01:32:09] because what we really just want is a game that blows us away that's all we want we want a game

[01:32:13] when it comes out it makes our jaws drop it's like Ghostbusters LE we want Batman SLE

[01:32:17] that's what Beetlejuice is gonna be I wish I stayed in the US after my master rather than going

[01:32:25] back to France well you know look I I was this close to moving to Ireland like this close to moving

[01:32:31] to Ireland taking the fam damn we were so close we were trying to get a mortgage a mortgage

[01:32:40] there was only one bank in Ireland that would actually consider us for a mortgage okay and this

[01:32:49] is what the crazy part is we add in cash on the property we were looking at 80% down 80%

[01:33:01] on where we wanted to live we had 80% in cash and the bank refused to look at my income in America

[01:33:13] and give us a mortgage because they said I needed a work visa for them to allow me to buy the property

[01:33:23] and I was gonna buy it as like a second home like a vacation home right as a way just like okay

[01:33:27] because I still have my apartment in New York City and they refused you know and Brennan I

[01:33:34] were like you know what screw them they don't want us there they want to make it hard like we're

[01:33:40] making good money do income a lot of money these idiots we would bring ideas creativity opportunity

[01:33:49] like they don't want us there then I'm you know and we made the best decision ever and we talk

[01:33:54] about it all the time we made the best decision of our lives not moving to Ireland not not to mention

[01:34:01] that Ireland is like headed south fast like ultra socialistic talk about open borders talk about like

[01:34:09] everyone the Irish people are mad like they're they're in big trouble and and Ireland is like

[01:34:15] it's more expensive than America it's the second most expensive country in Europe you can't get

[01:34:20] anything for your money but the problem in Ireland you can't make money this is the big issue

[01:34:28] it's hard to wealth generate in these extremely socialistic European countries and if you ever want

[01:34:35] to buy something like a pinball machine or a civic type art you're screwed you know much a civic

[01:34:40] type art is an America 40 grand you know much is in Ireland like 65,000 dollars you talk about

[01:34:46] tariffs and taxes those people are hammered whenever they want to buy anything that comes from anywhere

[01:34:52] else and the second America tries to do it everyone's well it's open

[01:34:55] anyway everybody happy Saturday I'm gonna go I think we stopped talking about pinball a while ago

[01:35:13] I think we stopped talking about what are we talking about pinball bad like you know everybody losing

[01:35:17] money on star wars we got the kids are home my family's so beautiful I just like little kill man I'm

[01:35:27] I'm literally when I walk by his pictures we have like this um digital frame and when I see pictures

[01:35:33] of him just the last three years of what a difference the three years have done to him I start crying

[01:35:40] in my kitchen it makes me so happy and sad at the same time he went from this little baby that I would

[01:35:49] just hold in the bathtub and was very nervous about that to to the little kitty is today and and

[01:35:58] and I'm so happy that I get to redo all of that with Cassian and Cass is like amazing he walks

[01:36:06] around this joint like a little stay puff marshmallow man and he's like starting to say dad that

[01:36:11] and mama and point at things and you know he shakes his head when he doesn't want food and when you

[01:36:16] want something it's just the most beautiful moment of existence and for those of you have been through

[01:36:23] it and have children you know exactly what I'm talking about and none of these pinball machines and

[01:36:29] clothes or watches or anything bottles and nothing nothing will ever compare to like the love of

[01:36:37] like a child and a parent and like that that is it like you could take you could strip everything

[01:36:42] in your if someone walked into your house today and said I'll give you you know $20,000 for each

[01:36:49] of your pinball machines you'd sell every single one if someone knocked on my door here and said I'll

[01:36:54] give you $20 million for killing and I'm not selling that's that's love like we we really do try to

[01:37:01] put on to these these items like this all this value and meaning and it doesn't mean shit like

[01:37:08] what means the most is our friendship our relationships this is all that's valuable that buying the

[01:37:14] machines is just a ticket to get to to this relationship that we all have it it is really the most

[01:37:20] valuable thing and it's why these companies that don't invest in the relationships with the people

[01:37:26] and the community are are are driving their organizations off a cliff and they they they need to

[01:37:32] get it back and that is what they don't get and it doesn't cost money like Stern Stern things they're

[01:37:38] going to advertise their way out of the hole no the only way out is through us and through the community

[01:37:44] and through building more meaningful moments with each and every one of us and I don't think they

[01:37:49] know how to do it I don't think they know how to do it I don't think they know how to talk from

[01:37:53] the heart anymore I really don't I don't I think they're kind of lost and and I think they they're

[01:37:59] operating with too much pressure and not enough passion and not enough you know transparency everybody
