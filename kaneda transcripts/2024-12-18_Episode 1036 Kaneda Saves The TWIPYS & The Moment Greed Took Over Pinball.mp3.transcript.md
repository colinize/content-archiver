[00:00] Good morning everybody, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:29] Isn't it crazy how a good song is actually just as good as a $15,000 pinball machine?

[00:36] We're going to talk about what's happening in the world of pinball as we all head.

[00:40] To Christmas in just one week.

[00:43] Have any of you bought a pinball machine for Christmas?

[00:47] Have any of you seen how expensive the world has become?

[00:50] We're going to talk about what's going on, we're near the end of the year.

[00:53] And this is a moment in time in which I think everyone reflects on the year that came before

[00:59] and what is ahead of us.

[01:00] Now look, there's a lot of rumor titles that we're looking at down the road.

[01:05] Stuff like Back to the Future, stuff like Now Blade Runner.

[01:09] I want to give you a little bit of an update on this Blade Runner game, right?

[01:12] So Melvin, he filed for the exclusive rights or the patent to make a Blade Runner pinball

[01:18] machine and yes, he did do that.

[01:21] Now what people don't know is all he did was file for the rights to make a Blade Runner

[01:26] game.

[01:27] The reason he did that, I believe the family of Dutch actor Rutger Hauer came to him and

[01:34] I guess maybe they saw Alice or one of the Dutch games at a show and they're just interested

[01:40] in making a game that will honor the movie that their relative was in because he passed

[01:46] away in 2019.

[01:48] Now that does not mean that you're going to get Blade Runner with Harrison Ford anytime

[01:53] soon because Harrison Ford is super expensive, but yes, absolutely.

[01:59] I think if you were to ask people would you rather have Blade Runner or John Wick, Blade

[02:05] Runner or Venom, Blade Runner or let's see, Halloween or Looney Tunes or Ultraman, of

[02:11] course we'd rather have Blade Runner over Cuphead, Blade Runner over almost a lot of

[02:17] these new games.

[02:18] But we're reaching a point in pinball now where I think people are just getting tired

[02:22] of waiting for those amazing themes around the corner.

[02:26] Goonies is supposed to come out, I know we're excited about that.

[02:30] Harry Potter by Eric Minier, we got Matrix by Steve Ritchie, we got King Kong by Keith

[02:37] Elwyn, maybe Pokemon by Jack Danger, lots of stuff right?

[02:42] Lots of stuff in the rumor mail, maybe Predator by the Pinball Brothers and with all these

[02:47] themes that are supposedly going to reignite our love affair with Pinball, the main question

[02:53] is going to become do you have room, do you have money and what are you willing to take

[02:59] for those games you need to move out?

[03:01] Because that's going to be the big question.

[03:03] Now before we go into this show I also want to give a big shout out.

[03:07] I want to give a big shout out to those of you out there, you know who you are, you know

[03:11] who you are.

[03:12] I'm going to tell you a little funny story before I do this.

[03:13] I got a notification from Patreon yesterday that they are giving me the ability to give

[03:20] a discount on Tears for Canada's Pinball podcast that you could lower the price for a limited

[03:26] time to enter Canada's Pinball podcast.

[03:29] Now what I don't do on this show and I hope you all appreciate this, what I don't do is

[03:34] I don't really follow the Patreon model, I don't offer different things for different

[03:39] tears.

[03:40] I simply give everybody the best possible show I can do every single week and I don't

[03:45] hold back.

[03:46] I don't say like well if you spend 30 bucks you get this, if you spend 100 you get a polo

[03:51] shirt and some exclusive information.

[03:53] I'm going to share with you photos of Christopher Franchi's next game.

[03:56] No I don't have those photos so don't ask me for them.

[03:59] I don't do that.

[04:00] I give everybody the best show possible and all I ask in return is that you give what

[04:04] you can give and that's it.

[04:05] I'm never raising my prices but I'm not going to reduce the $5 price, that's not going to

[04:09] happen.

[04:10] So I want to give a shout out and we used to do this, the Raise the Roof Club.

[04:14] I want to give a shout out to everyone who's raised the roof since December 1st and I'm

[04:19] here to tell you right now, Adam 700 and something of you.

[04:22] I get it, it's an expensive time of year.

[04:24] There's been four members I want to give a shout out to.

[04:26] I want to give a shout out to SRT2H, S-R-E-T-O-O-H.

[04:32] They edited their pledge from $5 to $30.

[04:35] Thank you so much.

[04:36] A shout out to CMG996.

[04:39] They edited their pledge to $1450 Canadian.

[04:42] I think that's like $10 US.

[04:44] Danny Hughes, thank you so much for editing your pledge to $10 and I also want to thank

[04:50] Ted Hauser who edited his pledge to $15.

[04:53] So if you want to raise the roof people, that's all you got to do to get a great shout out

[04:57] from Canada.

[04:58] I really do appreciate it.

[05:00] On the next episode I'll give a shout out to everybody in the $10, $50 and $30 club.

[05:04] You guys are going to get a shout out on the next episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[05:08] All right, so here we are.

[05:10] Here we are, December 18th.

[05:12] A week from Christmas.

[05:14] What kind of year has it been?

[05:15] We're going to do a year in review.

[05:17] We're going to go down a list of what we think were the best games this year and all the

[05:20] accolades these games deserve.

[05:23] I think I've single handedly saved the Twippies.

[05:26] Trust me, they weren't going to do this.

[05:28] I'm looking up the Twippy categories and they omitted so many categories that you were

[05:34] going to be able to vote on opening up like January 3rd.

[05:38] If I didn't say anything, trust me people, if I did not say anything and I didn't call

[05:43] them out and I didn't call Jamie live and I didn't let Colin know on my Facebook live,

[05:50] what are you guys doing?

[05:52] They basically only had like five categories for games made by manufacturers.

[05:58] They left out stuff.

[06:00] Let's talk about this.

[06:01] Not only do they leave out like so many important things that hardworking people who make pinball

[06:06] machines deserve recognition, they then have like nine categories for best location.

[06:12] They have four categories for pinball toppers.

[06:15] Oh my gosh, don't embarrass yourselves.

[06:18] What are you doing?

[06:20] You can't do it like this.

[06:21] So here's what they left out.

[06:23] They left out best artist.

[06:24] What?

[06:25] We're not going to recognize the best artist?

[06:28] That's insane.

[06:29] They left out best animations.

[06:32] Just think about that for a minute.

[06:33] There's more work that goes into what goes on that screen than what even goes into the

[06:39] design and layout of a game.

[06:41] No, we're not going to recognize those people who make pinball animations amazing.

[06:46] People who make games like Food Fighters, what it is today because of the animations, right?

[06:50] I mean, think about it.

[06:52] A lot of games, if you turn off that screen and you played it, half of the experience is

[06:56] gone.

[06:57] We're not going to recognize that.

[06:58] We're not going to recognize best sound.

[07:00] Oh my gosh.

[07:02] Most of the pinball experience is what you're hearing, right?

[07:05] It's what you're hearing.

[07:06] It's what's coming through those speakers.

[07:07] Let's leave that out.

[07:09] Let's not recognize best pinball callouts.

[07:12] Think about a pinball machine, right?

[07:14] Without its callouts.

[07:15] A callout is basically what really takes a game from being a good game to a great game.

[07:21] I would even say some callouts and pinball machines make a great game, an unforgettable

[07:26] game.

[07:27] I think callouts play a huge difference in the experience of a pinball machine.

[07:32] They also lump together theme integration.

[07:35] All they had was best theme integration.

[07:37] They didn't have best theme separated from best theme integration.

[07:41] You got to separate the two.

[07:43] We all know why because, look, Evil Dead, I think, might be the best theme integrated

[07:48] game right now.

[07:50] Maybe Jaws is the best theme integrated game, but Evil Dead might not win for best theme,

[07:56] but it might win best theme integration because it's not the best theme.

[07:59] I would say Jaws is a better theme than Evil Dead.

[08:02] They don't even have best designer.

[08:05] They got Game of the Year.

[08:06] They don't have best layout or design separated from Game of the Year.

[08:11] Think about that because this is going to be interesting this year.

[08:13] I think out of all the years, you did not want to consolidate the manufacturer awards.

[08:19] It's this year because this year there's not like a runaway Godzilla.

[08:24] It's not a game that's going to sweep everything, and that's what makes the Twippies interesting.

[08:29] If you take categories like best design and layout and then Game of the Year, in a year

[08:35] in which there's an iconic game like Godzilla, that game will win both.

[08:41] I would argue that this year, best creative layout and design would go to Jack Danger with

[08:47] X-Men.

[08:48] It's not going to win Game of the Year.

[08:50] I still think he deserves an award for best layout and design because it is.

[08:55] It really is.

[08:56] I would argue that Game of the Year is probably going to be right now as it stands.

[09:01] Jaws.

[09:02] Jaws will be Game of the Year, but they didn't do that.

[09:06] I think they're going to do that because I've been talking to Jamie and I've been talking

[09:10] to Colin and they know they need to do that.

[09:13] You've got to recognize the men and women who work really hard on these games.

[09:20] There's too much recognition happening right now as the Twippies stand.

[09:25] Too many categories for content creators.

[09:28] Too many categories for mods.

[09:32] You don't need a Twippy for mod that interacts with the ball and mod that doesn't interact

[09:39] with the ball.

[09:41] That is absolutely ridiculous.

[09:42] That's like giving car awards, car that turns left the best and car that turns right the

[09:49] best.

[09:50] Absolutely silly.

[09:51] If they want to make the Twippies fun and engaging, you've got to keep it on the games

[09:56] because people want to vote for those things first and foremost.

[09:59] When you start to get the stuff like best member of the pinball community, what are

[10:02] we doing now?

[10:04] That's like the most woke award you could possibly give.

[10:08] Just do best pinball podcaster, best pinball streamer, best pinball website, maybe best

[10:14] pinball news outlet so Naps Arcade can get recognized and then move on.

[10:19] Best new is fine, but just call it best new.

[10:24] You know what they're calling it best breakthrough.

[10:28] That's a little confusing.

[10:30] I work in communications for a living.

[10:32] Breakthrough to me doesn't mean best new.

[10:38] It just means you broke through.

[10:40] You could have a breakthrough year and it not be your rookie year.

[10:44] I know it can stand for your first year, but it doesn't always mean that.

[10:50] And why make it confusing?

[10:52] Just best new podcaster.

[10:54] That's it.

[10:55] Best new podcaster.

[10:56] And I think the reason they're calling it best breakthrough, you know why, because you

[11:01] know they want to give it to someone who's not new, who doesn't shake hands.

[11:06] And so you've made some ambiguous title now just so they can get it.

[11:12] I get it, everybody.

[11:14] And the reason why you probably left out artist is maybe you had a little thing with

[11:20] Frenchie and he upset you, but that doesn't give you the right.

[11:24] They started to slip down that slope the same way they made Canada ineligible like a year

[11:29] ago or you start to change the categories.

[11:33] You start to remove stuff because it doesn't fit your personal agenda.

[11:37] And I'm like, look, they're going to fix all this.

[11:40] The problem now they're going to face is Canada is going to be the one who said it was

[11:44] because of me.

[11:46] It was because of me.

[11:47] They weren't changing this.

[11:49] Nobody was saying anything about this because nobody pays attention to the Twippies more

[11:53] than Canada.

[11:54] Because I do think it's a great moment to recognize all the hardworking men and women

[11:59] who make the machines we love and all the hardworking content creators and mod makers

[12:04] and everybody associated with pinball.

[12:07] It's a great moment and it should be fun and it should be fun and you should not leave

[12:10] people out, but also stop with all the location stuff.

[12:15] That stuff is silly.

[12:17] It's silly.

[12:18] Most people don't have access to that stuff, but they have access to artwork, their eyes

[12:22] work.

[12:23] They have access to music, their ears work.

[12:25] They have access to podcasts and streamers because they can just go on and listen to

[12:28] everything.

[12:29] Everything is out there.

[12:30] I want to give a huge shout out to Spooky Luke.

[12:33] Do you see what happened yesterday?

[12:35] If you didn't, you're not on my Patreon chat.

[12:37] You should be on the Patreon chat.

[12:39] So one of our guys on the chat, Yeager, he's all over the chat every day.

[12:44] Like I wake up and it's Bob, then it's Yeager and it's Dave Sanders and it's a bunch of

[12:49] you guys, Donk.

[12:50] You know who you are.

[12:51] There's like 20 of you guys that don't stop talking.

[12:54] There's Robert and Europe.

[12:55] I mean, you guys just keep going.

[12:57] I love it.

[12:58] I wake up and I'm never alone because that thing is going and I can jump in and just

[13:02] say, hey guys, Guns N' Roses is great.

[13:04] And you're like, shut up, Canada.

[13:06] The game is four years old and you're not wrong.

[13:09] Well Yeager had an issue with one of his Spooky Machines.

[13:12] I believe it was the TNA Speaker Grill.

[13:15] It wasn't fitting right.

[13:16] There was a little bit of a gap and clearly when it was machine cut, it was a little bit

[13:21] off, just a little bit off.

[13:23] And he was doing all this stuff to try to solve the problem.

[13:27] I believe this is what happened and Spooky Luke is like, dude, I'll just cut you a new

[13:31] one right now and make it a little bit bigger and fill the gap.

[13:36] Because I'm reading this chat like a few minutes later, Spooky Luke shows a picture

[13:41] of the new Speaker Grills.

[13:43] He just cut for this guy live in real time on Canada's Pinball Podcast Patreon chat.

[13:50] And I'm like, this is it.

[13:51] This is it.

[13:52] This is the reason why everybody loves these dudes.

[13:55] I mean, how do you not root for a company like this?

[13:58] Like they listen to all their customers.

[14:00] They freaking make you parts in real time.

[14:02] You can't even get half these companies on the horn.

[14:05] And here we are.

[14:06] Oh man, the moment these guys, I mean it, the moment these guys make a Kira, I'm buying

[14:12] 499 of them.

[14:14] The moment they make a theme I really want.

[14:16] I'm in on it.

[14:17] I'm in on it.

[14:18] I just want to support these guys.

[14:19] I feel like a lot of people now, Spooky Pinball, we want to give you our money.

[14:25] We just need a theme that indicates that we've been late in the last 20 years.

[14:30] If you can do that for us, I mean it.

[14:32] If you can do that for us.

[14:34] If you can make me a theme that indicates I've had sexual relations with a woman and

[14:40] know that theme is not Evil Dead, it's not Looney Tunes, it's not Halloween, give me

[14:45] something that says, hey, this is a cool dude.

[14:48] He grew up normally.

[14:50] He grew up normally.

[14:51] Like he was in the cars.

[14:52] He was in the women.

[14:53] He was in the action movies.

[14:55] What men of my age grew up who actually developed into sexually active beings.

[14:59] I know they know this.

[15:01] I know they know this.

[15:02] And one day they're going to deliver and I'm going to open up my wallet.

[15:06] All right.

[15:07] So here's the thing too.

[15:08] I was just thinking about, I was just thinking about something as I was looking on Pinside

[15:11] and I saw this like James Bond, new in box, Ellie for $9,995.

[15:20] I mean, that's the new thing people.

[15:22] There's these games and they're there.

[15:25] You know, they're there.

[15:26] These Ellie's that were once 13,000 are sitting in a box somewhere and everybody with an open

[15:34] game that's got a lot of plays on it.

[15:37] Here's the funny part.

[15:38] They think their games are actually worth more than the new in box, unmalested game.

[15:44] And I just started thinking about like, how long has this really been going on?

[15:48] Right?

[15:49] How long have we really been taking these hits?

[15:51] And when you look at the dates, you start to realize that it hasn't been as long as

[15:57] we think, but it's been painful.

[16:00] It's kind of like having kids like the days are long and the years are short.

[16:05] And when you look at pinball, you know, when you look at pinball prices, like in 2020, right?

[16:10] That was just four years ago.

[16:11] That's when guns and roses came out.

[16:13] That's when guns and roses one game of the year and GNRCE was 12, five.

[16:18] If you look at 2020, four years ago, we all can remember that.

[16:22] What was the price of an Ellie?

[16:24] You know, four years ago, the price of an Ellie, we had Ninja Turtles and it was $9,099.

[16:32] That is what Ninja Turtles was in May.

[16:35] And then Stern started to do what Stern does.

[16:39] It's like they started to creep up the next launch in September.

[16:44] Avengers, $9,199.

[16:46] I see what you did there, Stern.

[16:50] You added $100.

[16:51] Okay.

[16:52] All right.

[16:53] All right.

[16:54] I see.

[16:55] But remember, these games only had 500 LEs.

[16:57] Now Ninja Turtles was not hard to get the LE of.

[17:00] Neither was Avengers.

[17:01] Then the next game, you remember what it was?

[17:03] The most empty Ellie of all time.

[17:06] Led Zeppelin LE, $9,199.

[17:10] All right.

[17:11] So then we head into 2021.

[17:14] Mandalorian kept the price the same, $9,199.

[17:19] They did up the amount of Mando's.

[17:21] I forgot about this.

[17:23] 750 Mando's.

[17:24] All right.

[17:25] We're going to start to make more.

[17:27] All right.

[17:28] Then they do the big jump, right?

[17:29] They got the big game, the big designer, the big monster, Godzilla LE, a thousand of

[17:36] them.

[17:37] Wow.

[17:38] This is the first time ever.

[17:39] This is a milestone.

[17:40] This is the first time ever.

[17:42] One made a thousand LEs.

[17:44] They had never made a thousand LEs before.

[17:47] Even when they made Star Wars back in the day, the Steve Ritchie Abomination to Star

[17:52] Wars, it was only like 800 units.

[17:55] Okay.

[17:56] So we've got a thousand Godzilla's and then they took the price up again and they didn't

[18:00] just get a little bit sneaky here, people.

[18:03] They went from $9,200 all the way up to $10,500, a big leap in September three years ago.

[18:13] It was just like three years ago they did this.

[18:16] All right.

[18:17] But it was Godzilla, right?

[18:18] It was like, if you're ever going to pick a game to jump the price up and justify it,

[18:23] Godzilla, not a bad game to do it on.

[18:26] Okay.

[18:27] Then this is where the greed happens.

[18:29] And I mean it, it only takes one feeding frenzy moment to think you can apply that to everything.

[18:36] We saw it with Jersey Jack and Guns N' Roses CE, right?

[18:40] All the moves that Jersey Jack made after GNR were reflective of the feeding frenzy that

[18:46] happened around GNR.

[18:47] The problem is they didn't have a game as good as GNR since GNR.

[18:52] And then you start to raise prices on products that don't deliver on the same level.

[18:57] So what happened next at Stern Pimbal?

[18:59] Remember this?

[19:00] I remember it.

[19:01] They then released the 40th anniversary of Elvira.

[19:07] And remember what they did on that game when everything was hot, right?

[19:11] You couldn't keep anything in stock.

[19:14] It was called for price.

[19:15] They didn't even have the guts to tell us what they thought the game was worth.

[19:21] They let the dealers set the price.

[19:23] And there are many dealers out there that charged and got $25,000 for Elvira 40th anniversary

[19:33] editions.

[19:34] I'm going to go on Pinside Marketplace right now.

[19:37] I'm going to go on Pinside right now and tell you what you can get in Elvira 40th for.

[19:41] Here's one new in box.

[19:43] New in box.

[19:44] It hasn't even been opened for $15,995.

[19:50] And opened one is $14,8.

[19:53] Another one new in box for $16.

[19:56] Another one opened for $16, or best offer.

[19:59] Another opened one for $15,000.

[20:01] So just looking at that game, most people when they got in knew it, spent $20,000.

[20:07] But this is where the greed began.

[20:09] This is where the greed began.

[20:10] Because remember when Stern did this, this was also the first time ever, ever people where

[20:17] Stern made another version of an LE when they said they were never going to do that.

[20:24] Remember before the 40th Elvira already had in LE a signature edition game that people

[20:32] spent a lot of money on that was very limited.

[20:35] They started to move the goalpost.

[20:37] And then we get to 2023, the period in which greed takes over.

[20:43] I know COVID is going on.

[20:45] I know the world's gone a little crazy.

[20:48] But this is where I think we're going to look back years from now and wonder where the beginnings

[20:54] of the pinball market collapse begin.

[20:57] Where did the greed really take over?

[21:01] And it was in 2023, January of 2023, nothing like starting a new year by releasing a 60th

[21:10] anniversary of James Bond.

[21:13] A game that is a single level game with no real mechs in it, terrible artwork, a ridiculous

[21:20] scoring reel that makes no sense.

[21:23] And they made 500 of them and they priced them at $19,999.

[21:29] And even to this day, every time I sit down with George, he says, we didn't price it,

[21:36] the dealers did.

[21:38] That's not truthful.

[21:40] It was on Stern's website.

[21:42] They quickly yanked it down.

[21:44] And if you look at this game now, let's see, one just sold for $12.5.

[21:49] One's in a box for $16.3.

[21:52] Another open for $16.5.

[21:54] $13.5.

[21:55] Here's the thing about this game is like, how are you trying to sell one for $16.5 when

[21:59] there's one right next to it for $13.5?

[22:01] And that's it, this delusion.

[22:03] And this game is not that good.

[22:05] It really is not that good.

[22:06] It was one of the most underwhelming pinball machines ever.

[22:09] And if Stern just wasn't greedy and made just 500 and priced it where it should have been,

[22:16] 10 grand at most, then they would have held value nicely.

[22:20] And it would have just been a nice thing.

[22:22] Everyone would have won.

[22:23] You can't tell me that that game costs, like the bomb on that game for Stern must be somewhere

[22:29] around $3,000 at most.

[22:32] And they come in and they want to charge you 20 grand.

[22:35] And then it happens, people.

[22:37] The first LE ever to be $13,000 at 1,000 units was Foo Fighters.

[22:45] Now I was there when Foo Fighter LE came out and the response was great.

[22:49] It was Jack Danger's first game.

[22:52] We loved Jack.

[22:53] They nailed it.

[22:54] The game is great.

[22:55] The animations were incredible.

[22:57] And again, there really wasn't much blowback.

[23:00] And I think a lot of this had to do with the surround sound effect of what was happening

[23:05] in the world.

[23:06] You know, COVID was hitting.

[23:08] We all were like in a weird mindset.

[23:10] We were witnessing all this stuff happening culturally because I think the context of

[23:15] how a pinball company can make a move in just a few years.

[23:19] And remember, now we're talking these games are $4,000 more in 2023 than they were in

[23:27] 2020.

[23:29] In a two and a half year period of $4,000 increase in the price of a Stern LE.

[23:36] And they doubled the amount of the games.

[23:38] And the reason why it was hard to sort of see the greed when it was happening, because

[23:43] it happened gradually and then it didn't.

[23:46] And we were living in a COVID world and we were watching people die.

[23:50] And we were staying at home and we weren't going out as much and we weren't taking vacations

[23:55] and we were bored and we were thinking about our mortality a little bit.

[23:59] And we were just thinking about living for the here and the now because that's what it

[24:03] did.

[24:04] It forced everybody to sort of be at home.

[24:06] How do I avoid all the despair?

[24:08] Well you double down on things that make you feel good.

[24:11] You double down on the vices that make you feel good.

[24:14] And all of a sudden we've got $13,000 Stern LEs.

[24:18] And if you look at the way Stern has increased its prices over the years, if you're a smart

[24:22] person, you're also going to come to the conclusion that we're long overdue for a Stern price

[24:27] increase.

[24:29] But Foo Fighters LE sold out.

[24:30] I remember that.

[24:31] It sold very quickly.

[24:33] It did sell out.

[24:34] And at this point, remember, not in the history of Pimbal, had we ever had a game that had

[24:40] that many LEs at that much money.

[24:42] So nobody knew what the market reaction would be when games went on the used market.

[24:48] First time ever, right?

[24:50] All those jokes about 10K by Christmas.

[24:52] We didn't know.

[24:53] And then now we know.

[24:55] Now we know that a Foo Fighter LE now, just a couple years later, people remember, this

[24:59] is not like four or five years ago, we're looking at a game that came out just a little

[25:04] over a year and a half ago.

[25:06] A little bit less than two years ago.

[25:08] And now you're losing $3,000 or more on every single one.

[25:13] And then after that, right, how'd they follow up Foo Fighters?

[25:16] Venom LE, $13,000.

[25:19] That game is worth about like nine, maybe 8,500 opened up.

[25:23] Okay.

[25:24] Venom.

[25:25] And then they got greedy again.

[25:26] They re-ran Jurassic Park LEs.

[25:30] More Jurassic Park LEs.

[25:31] And then they remade another Elvira.

[25:34] And this is it.

[25:35] Remember, like this was it.

[25:37] And everybody was fed up and the dealers had to go to Stern and the distros had to tell

[25:42] them to stop because they were not going to stop.

[25:45] They were not going to stop.

[25:46] They had Godzilla anniversary ready to go as another LE for $13,000.

[25:51] They were just going to keep doing this.

[25:53] You know, and that concludes 2023.

[25:55] So the last year for Stern Pinball, you had Jaws, right?

[26:00] Keith Elwin game.

[26:01] Pretty successful for them.

[26:02] I would argue pretty successful game for them.

[26:05] You can't find a Jaws LE.

[26:07] Those games are going to hold value nicely.

[26:09] But again, it's like Keith Elwin, unless we do a Keith Elwin game or we do a remake or

[26:15] an anniversary game, we've got nothing.

[26:17] Like nothing else is popping.

[26:19] John Wick was after Jaws.

[26:21] That flop.

[26:22] Those games are worth nothing now.

[26:24] Then you brought out Godzilla Black and White Premium.

[26:26] You know they wanted that to be a $13,000 anniversary game.

[26:32] Then you've got the Costco Jurassic Park home for $5,000.

[26:36] And this part makes no sense.

[26:37] The Jurassic Park home at Costco is $5,000.

[26:41] If you buy it on the Stern website, it's $6,000.

[26:45] It's almost like they're just doing that on purpose because they're trying to drive people

[26:48] to Costco so they feel like they're getting a deal.

[26:51] And then we have X-Men LE.

[26:53] They start to pull back the number of LEs, 8-11 at $13,000.

[26:59] We know what's been going on with that game.

[27:01] And then we finally get back to $500 again.

[27:04] Oh, it's exhausting, right?

[27:06] And this is always what fascinates me about Pinball people is when you go back and you

[27:10] look at the actual dates and you look at the numbers and you look at the moves and you have

[27:16] it all sort of summarized in such an easy way.

[27:20] I think it makes it so easy to realize that real bad moves were made.

[27:27] And Jersey Jack made equally bad moves, even worse than Stern because their prices are

[27:33] even higher.

[27:34] Their themes are not as good.

[27:37] Their platform is still the best.

[27:38] Let's not be stupid here.

[27:40] The Jersey Jack platform is the nicest looking pinball machine in the history of pinball.

[27:46] But just because you're rich and you have the money doesn't make you smart.

[27:51] And the moves they've made at Jersey Jack have been anything but intelligent.

[27:56] And that is why Jersey Jack games over the last four years since Guns N' Roses, they

[28:01] have not had a hit game.

[28:03] So that's four years, four games that were underwhelming.

[28:07] So will they return to the Halcyon days of G&R with a Harry Potter, with a Steve Ritchie

[28:15] Matrix?

[28:16] I mean, the titles are there.

[28:17] The talent is there.

[28:19] Is the passion there?

[28:21] And we're going to see that in 2025.

[28:23] I think that's why 2025 is very exciting.

[28:26] It's interesting when you think about Elwyn and can he keep doing it?

[28:30] Can he keep doing it?

[28:31] Jaws didn't wow us the way that Godzilla did.

[28:35] And so it's going to be interesting.

[28:37] Have we ever seen a designer capable of constantly reinventing himself and making hit after hit

[28:45] after hit?

[28:46] Eventually, you might run out of ideas.

[28:49] Eventually, it just might get to the point where you're really going to need more help

[28:54] in the toys and mechs department.

[28:55] I mean that because there's only so much you can do with layout.

[28:58] There really is.

[28:59] Like you really need to get more creative with the mechs and the toys and the world under

[29:06] glass.

[29:07] And I still think when I look at a stern machine, I mean this.

[29:10] I don't see anywhere near a $13,000 item.

[29:15] The sculpts are not there.

[29:17] They still look cheap.

[29:19] I mean that.

[29:20] Like when I look down at Jaws, it just looks so cheap.

[29:23] And even when you look over to Avatar, even though the damn thing is empty, it still just

[29:28] looks so much nicer.

[29:30] And again, if Stern wants to charge this much, it just should look better.

[29:35] And I think a lot of these companies have become lazy and they're just like relying

[29:40] on the mod community to fill in the stuff that they don't want to do.

[29:44] And it's not the way it should be.

[29:46] So everybody, you know, as we get to the end of this year, just remember, it hasn't been

[29:51] that long.

[29:53] Just like four years ago, games were $4,000 less.

[29:58] If you think about it like that, Stern has increased the price of their LEDs $1,000 a

[30:03] year over the last four years.

[30:06] They doubled the amount of games.

[30:08] Jersey Jack games.

[30:09] Now, three Jersey Jack CEs will set you back $45,000.

[30:17] You have to make $90,000 basically before taxes to buy three Jersey Jack CEs, each of

[30:25] which, if you bought Toy Story, Godfather, and Avatar, your CEs will lose collectively,

[30:33] $15,000.

[30:34] It's got to change people.

[30:39] It's either going to change or we're all going to have to make a lot more money to sustain

[30:43] all of this.

[30:44] I love pinball.

[30:45] You know, I love this hobby because the majority of these companies don't even need to be successful.

[30:50] They've got annuities coming from other places.

[30:53] They've got deep pockets that did not come from pinball.

[30:57] It's like this weird like Nepo Baby, Trust Fun Baby sort of hobby mixed with some legitimate

[31:03] hardworking companies like Spooky and Stern that aren't getting their money from anywhere

[31:08] else, so they have to make great games.

[31:11] When you look at the top games in pinball, it's still dominated by the companies that

[31:17] had to make great pinball.

[31:19] The companies that have all the money, the companies that have been financed by other

[31:24] things like CGC and JJP, you know, an American pinball with AIMtron financing them, there's

[31:33] a reason why they're not at the top because nothing will ever replace passion and hard

[31:38] work and a drive to get it done right.

[31:42] When you've got all this money and you're going to survive whether or not you succeed

[31:46] or not, that is a recipe for mediocrity and that's not the kind of environment that cranks

[31:52] out the best pinball and I'm glad to see that our hobby still and hopefully the Twippy's

[31:58] Wheel too, still will recognize and reward those who put the most passion in and those

[32:05] who have the most heart and soul in our beloved hobby.

[32:09] Everybody have a great Wednesday.

[32:10] I'll talk to you soon.
