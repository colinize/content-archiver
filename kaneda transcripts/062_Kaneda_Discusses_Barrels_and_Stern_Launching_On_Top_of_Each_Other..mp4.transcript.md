[00:00] Good morning, everybody. Happy Sunday morning. We're going to do a fun show today.

[00:07] Love these impromptu shows. Let's share this right now on Facebook.

[00:14] Let's get the link and we're going to go right now. Get everybody in live now.

[00:26] Live on Sunday morning to talk. Pinball marketing.

[00:34] I think I spelled marketing right.

[00:37] Let's get everybody in. Publish original post. Let's go to Patreon. Let everybody there. No, no, too.

[00:45] I really wanted to have this separately because I didn't really get a chance to articulate myself at automated as I was running around in my clown outfit.

[00:56] I think this is a much better forum for what I want to talk about right now.

[01:03] Let's see this. They changed the whole, I don't know why all these apps continue to change the settings and make it more complicated for content creators to do stuff.

[01:17] Like as you saw yesterday, what an absolute nightmare.

[01:22] Trying to flip the camera around.

[01:27] You know, it was absolutely terrible. And everyone's having the same problem. Like there's nothing you can do.

[01:37] So I just, I don't understand. I don't understand why these apps have made it much less friendly to do what you want to do.

[01:47] Let's just. There, there we go. That is me that we are live. We've got some people. Johnny pinballs in the house.

[01:55] I don't know what's up yet. No, I love these in primed to because they don't live live on on YouTube. So like, let's do this. Here's what I want to do.

[02:03] I want to talk about this topic because you know, I felt.

[02:08] I felt really. What's the best way to let me clean my camera. I'm really bad at tech as you can tell.

[02:21] That's much. I think it's better. Yeah, looks a little bit better.

[02:25] In the bedroom day, Canada, Brenda went out last night to see Kylie Monoke in New York City. Daddy was on duty. Kids are alive and doing well.

[02:34] I want to thank Mike at automated by the way, who.

[02:37] Who gave me.

[02:39] He let me go into this like vault. It was like a huge freezer, but it was like filled with toys and stuffed animals.

[02:47] I think it's a Chris take two of anything for your children. And I.

[02:50] I took the chisart or is that the name of the dragon from Pokemon and it's become Killian's new best friend.

[02:58] So like amazing the way children bond to a new toy.

[03:03] It reminds me a lot of why people buy new and box charzard. Okay. It reminds me why like the same feeling we have as adults.

[03:12] And the difference is like a kid can experience the joy for like five bucks.

[03:18] And we are out trying to.

[03:21] To spend 15,000 to capture even just a fleeting moment of what young children feel with toys that they get.

[03:30] I mean it when I say gang like adult toys are dangerous things because you can go down a rabbit hole of trying to fill the void if you will.

[03:40] I want to thank Mike it was a great time. I had a lot of fun on evil dead. I really am the more I think about it.

[03:49] I would I would buy the game.

[03:52] I thought I wouldn't want it. I'm being completely candid. I thought I wouldn't want it.

[03:59] And then I played it and I'm like damn like it's just such a stunning machine.

[04:06] And I it's not at the same polish as a JJP yet you know the monitors a little still I don't know why it's still a little washed out.

[04:18] But the details on it I think it might be the most head to toe detailed machine I've ever stood in front of I mean that I mean every inch of that game is covered in details that are awesome.

[04:35] From the speaker grills to the armor to the inner art plates like you don't have to buy anything the top or comes with the game.

[04:42] I actually would be happy with that top or I don't even know if you need the the much more expensive top or there is a level of passion that went into that game that makes anyone who stands in front of it a believer.

[04:58] I mean isn't that what it's all about it's not about marketing it's not about this is not about that.

[05:04] But we're going to talk about marketing on this episode because I think I think it's about to get real interesting because looking at evil dead next to dungeons and dragons premium gang it look like the D&D cost half as much money.

[05:22] I there's no other way to put it.

[05:27] It just felt like there's twice as much going on in an evil dead and I'll say this about evil dead gang.

[05:34] It shoots well it you know the flippers are not exactly where stern flipper feel is but man lots of shots not like do you remember the old spooky the old spooky was just a brick fest.

[05:50] The how far this company has come like if you go play like a rock zombie in Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and then go play evil dead really really.

[06:08] My connection is unstable why is it unstable.

[06:13] What give me some stability.

[06:16] I'm going to try to close some stuff out hope I can force quit we're in chrome here force quit so far.

[06:26] Are we back.

[06:29] Everybody still here in the comments guys.

[06:32] Can you guys comment let me know we're still we're still stable I'll take not as good flippers but the rest of the game.

[06:39] So it's it's it was eye opening it was eye opening I was absolutely surprised at the the amount of stuff and it the also the thing that I liked about evil dead it didn't feel like a wide body didn't shoot like a wide body wasn't floaty at all.

[06:55] It really felt very satisfying and and just the right level of difficulty on some of the shots like the shot to get the ball locked in the cabin really really nice.

[07:10] I'm not going to talk about you know there's like drop targets to unlock the pathway then that this I will say what I love about what spooky is done is is just the atmosphere of stuff in the game.

[07:23] Do you think the center post is needed.

[07:26] You know what are I I didn't mind it.

[07:29] You could argue the game is a little maybe easy on the easier side I think for very skilled players they might they might find this game be easy like.

[07:39] You know coming from guns and roses a game in which just out lane drains all day long guns and roses I don't know if people feel this way but I feel it's it is almost.

[07:51] The biggest tragedy in gnr is how the out lane draining the constant out lane draining just removes the fun from the game I get stupid it's like they have to blitz you with constant multi balls because they're going to be draining left and right I just.

[08:07] Getting on a game that doesn't sort of rob you of your gameplay or your ball times is refreshing.

[08:15] I think gnr is just I'm you know how I feel about a gang it's still a beautiful work of art it's still a beautiful I just I just think the gameplay is so mediocre and it's so brutal and then you're never going to get far into the game and then you just get.

[08:32] It just gets repetitive you just see the same stuff over and over again and it doesn't really feel like rewarding to constantly jump on gnr to choose your you know your how you want to play the game because you kind of always playing it the same way.

[08:47] Yeah so here's what I want to talk about though on this Sunday morning because you don't want to hear me complain about gnr shots we all know gnr doesn't shoot great.

[08:55] I want to talk about in less than two weeks two new games are coming out and I want to talk about a little bit about a reaction I had to a conversation I had with my friends at barrels of fun so they're mad at me they're not happy with me right there not they're not happy with me they think I haven't given their company enough credit and I will say I probably should be more impressed by the fact that they've made a thousand games in a year they got their first games to customers.

[09:24] They you know for an inaugural pin they probably achieved more successes and first than any other brand new pinball company.

[09:33] Fine right it's like fine fine fine it's also like they came out in a much more crowded pinball marketplace.

[09:40] You know David Vines was over at spooky for a while helping them on earlier titles but here's the thing and I just want to talk about this because it did trigger something in me.

[09:53] Because I don't like being told that I'm unfair because I do think I'm very fair I do and I also honestly I kind of am allowed to have my own personal opinions about the themes you pick about the games you make and about you know the market around them all so look labrins is is a really nice first effort game it's not a theme for me I've never been a secret about that I just don't think about that.

[10:22] Don't think it's a title that I'd want to own because I didn't watch those movies with with incredible fondness if I were to have said the reason why I would want one is Jennifer Connelly she's not in the game yeah I was a little boy like she was like she was like one of the the women that young boys fond over so.

[10:43] But whatever you know much rather have P we have much rather have the muppets I much rather have fraggle rock like if it was fraggle rock pinball I would be all over it spent way more days watching fraggle rock than rerunning labyrinth in my household so okay but they made it you know they love the theme I think they did a great job on them integration sans Jennifer Connelly so here's the thing so here's the thing I get the sense that barrels of fun.

[11:12] Sort of you know they didn't like the pinball world on fire with their first game it's fine it's the first title but now they're in it right now they're in it like there's sophomore title the gang has been working really hard they've been working around the clock and their second game is about to launch the exact same week stern pinball is going to launch King Kong and Keith Lwind okay so here's my issue and I'm going to text this thing.

[11:42] David Van S and my friends over there and Brian Savage is a member of canate is pinball podcast gang you're legitimately less than 10 days out you've been working on this game for probably a year and a half you this game has been in development you're less than 10 games out 10 games out 10 days out and what are you doing right where's the where's the hype where's the marketing.

[12:12] Where's David Van S saying hey we're we're less than two weeks away from our next title we're really excited there's nothing not only that do you know what day they're going to reveal the game do you know i mean i'm i'm a pretty nano influencer with a deep enough following do you know when they're going to reveal the game.

[12:33] So April 15th on tax day terrible day to do anything April 15th tax day when people are going to probably owe money April 15th in nine days okay in nine days this company is going to have media fly over there to see the factory and see the game okay so that in my in my mind.

[12:54] Would indicate that they probably would have to reveal the game before then because once you let anybody through the door doesn't matter what you have them sign stuff's going to get out.

[13:07] Okay so when here's the problem so I think David Van S and team over there do not want there to be a pre release of anything I think they're going to invite everybody in.

[13:19] And have them sign and the is create their content and then they want to reveal the game to the world later in the week here's the problem.

[13:28] Stern Pimball has indicated that April 17th the Thursday is the day in which media will be coming over to play King Kong now historically when stern does that they don't reveal the game on the media day they reveal the game earlier in the week so here's what's going to happen.

[13:48] This Friday right this Friday get I guarantee you this is how this all rolls out this Friday maybe earlier this Friday we will get the teaser confirmation of King Kong as the next theme from stern Pimball so that will happen on Friday of this week so King Kong will actually get out in front of anything barrels.

[14:10] If things just go the way they're going to go.

[14:13] Then they're going to do there's sort of you know Monday call with the distros or some you know Monday Tuesday right then the full game reveal of King Kong will happen on Tuesday the 15th two days before media are going to fly over.

[14:30] You know to Stern Pimball and if you're if you're a pinball content creator are you going to both are you taking a like two days off probably just most of your work week you're going to take off yes some people are going to do it.

[14:42] I can't do it i'm going to be coming back from Scotland so this is like okay so think about that so on the very day that barrels of fun is going to invite media there everyone's going to be looking at King Kong for the first time.

[14:59] And then two days later King Kong is going to have its big factory tourists stern media moment and so you're launching your game right on top of that okay so okay so what are you guys doing.

[15:10] What you know and then you know and this is why i'm kind of like frustrated because I talk to David Vaness I talk to like Blake and Brian over there they've had all like year all year to think about just the launch strategy didn't it feel like this company.

[15:31] They teased they teased the reveal of barrels of fun as a company for like a year.

[15:39] And it feels like they're doing nothing to get people excited about game number two.

[15:45] So my whole thing is this here's the thing why I think all this pinball marketing sucks and these people are amateurs and and maybe they might be good in other fields of business here's why pinball marketing is is in my honest opinion is pathetic.

[15:58] So I get that you've got your media days locked in so what moment is your game reveal with less than 10 days to go neither company stern nor barrels of fun has indicated to us the pinball buying demographic what day.

[16:19] Do we expect to see the game is there a countdown clock no so you're basically you're basically not giving anybody any time to get excited because they don't know even know what day you know you're going to pull the curtain off the game you you could have given all these content creators and communities a chance to like have watch party so okay so I know what's today what's Friday's date Friday what is tomorrow's a seventh.

[16:46] Monday Tuesday 7th 8th 9th 10th 11th right like April 11th like why aren't you letting people know when they can get together and watch something live like did you have.

[17:02] Zach come by and film a feature read I don't know is there there's nothing there's nothing and when there's nothing and there's no hype and there's no excitement going so then your only strategy is.

[17:14] To try to launch these games on top of each other with absolutely zero build up zero height zero excitement I mean it wasn't the best launch but look what carry and I did for Alice's adventures in Wonderland right I mean look the stream was garbage but you had carry in canada going back and forth for like two weeks even more.

[17:40] Melvin let us in and we got people excited about the game they were going to see right I don't know you know like whether or not like the game delivered to your standards doesn't matter sold out in like one week right sold out he got all the the people to raise their hands and say they want it one.

[17:58] So now here we have my friends at barrel saying I'm not there to I'm not fair to us you're not giving us enough credit yeah guys I'm going to tell you right now I think you're marketing around this game.

[18:09] Is horrendous because there is no marketing around this game there's no hype there's no build up and now you know you're going up against Keith Owen and you don't do the very thing that spooky does.

[18:19] And I keep saying this to Blake I keep saying it to to Brian to David you have no transparency there I don't even think I have to people here even know what David Van S looks like do you do you.

[18:32] And all day long I see bugging Luke all over the internet all over the internet kissing babies shaking hands and selling evil debts.

[18:41] So if you want to pull people in and make them feel good you got to build that good will and nowhere to be found.

[18:47] No where to be found I shouldn't have to I don't need to fly to Benton Wisconsin to feel like I'm part of the spooky family because they let everybody in.

[18:56] And so this is my thing is like you you can't run your company in this secret vacuum and then expect this all to just wake up wake up and like want to be a part of like your thing your tribe and I think the tribe is a good word like each brand creates a tribe of fans that are following it and spookies made it so you feel so awesome being a part of spookies tribe.

[19:26] And it and all of it matters all of it matters you know the level of transparency matters the level of like connection to your buyer base matters and you're nine days out.

[19:39] You're nine freaking days out from watch and here's here's the only thing I can think about that this is not due.

[19:46] That's the only conclusion I can make is that these dudes are sitting on goonies and they're laughing their asses off inside and I hope that's the case.

[19:57] I really do I hope doon has been one ginormous misdirect I hope they're laughing their asses off and it's really going to be you know it's really going to be a goonies because I can't think of any other reason to that.

[20:15] And then do this like you know the vibe around doon is like and did you come out and get in front of it did you control the narrative and the word I'm getting is like well we're we're like head down to get the game at why what's the rush to get it out now the reality is they need to get it out because they need to keep the line going like barrels can afford to float its workforce if there's a big pause between labyrinth and the next game right.

[20:45] They can't do a JJP can which is like have like six weeks with nothing being made as you transition over to Harry Potter like you know what I'm saying like nobody's buying avatars now.

[20:57] Nobody's buying avatars now but my point is it's like and I told this to Blake and I'll say to David like I you got to help me help you it's like a Jerry McGuire moment if you don't give me anything and you treat me like like just an outsider like everybody else.

[21:15] Then all I'm going to do is articulate what a big marketing mistake that is you know I've got like if I do a video and I shared on Facebook it's going to get like two to 3000 views.

[21:29] So that's three times the amount of people that you're even trying to sell your product to and look people are going to make up their own mind you know like you know I'm saying like I could rant and rave it doesn't matter it's goonies it's going to sell out instantly if it's doing it's not.

[21:43] It doesn't matter it's just it's just not going to work like that.

[21:47] But I also don't understand like what I don't even think Brian understands like Stern's launch schedule you're literally going to have King Kong.

[21:55] Reveal to the world on the same day you want media to spend money out of their own pocket to come visit your factory.

[22:02] So I'm walking through the door barrels I just dropped like 500 bucks on a plane ticket 200 bucks on a hotel and then and then I'm looking at my phone the whole time because Stern just dropped King Kong.

[22:13] And then I'm like oh shoot maybe I should have just traveled to Chicago and seen King Kong.

[22:18] You know it's just it just doesn't work out.

[22:21] And where's the countdown clock?

[22:23] Where's David Van S and the team over at barrels being like here's what I told Blake I say to you guys because like honestly you know me I'm an open book like I just I don't even think these are like private side conversations.

[22:37] If I was working at barrels of fun you know what I'd be doing right now if I was David Van S.

[22:41] I'd have a little bit more of an external facing voice.

[22:45] I'd be like yo guys I know you saw a Jersey Jack up there the other day announcing Harry Potter saying you shouldn't buy anything other than Harry Potter and that he's got all the assets.

[22:56] I'd be like you know what that's great. I can't wait for Jack to release Harry Potter.

[23:00] I'll make you guys all a bet. I bet you it doesn't have all the assets you want because every time Jack gets up there and says that it doesn't.

[23:07] Jersey Jack got up on stage and put up two middle fingers one for Harry one for Potter.

[23:15] He told every other Pimball company out there F you and you're as a consumer you shouldn't buy from any of my competitors and you guys just all took it nobody said anything.

[23:26] Nobody said anything you guys took it on the chin.

[23:29] So he's got Harry Potter and he just told everybody you're trying to sell to to not buy from your company and what did you do did you say anything did you did you punch back.

[23:40] Did you remind everybody how Jersey Jack fumbles every single major theme they've ever had did you right.

[23:48] Did you like oh not every major theme I mean guns or roses theme wise it was good but like gameplay no.

[23:53] But you know what I'm saying did you remind Jack how he had no assets in pirates no assets in Willy Wonka did you remind everybody of that that the that the first the only time he really got most assets in was the first game he ever made no one said anything.

[24:06] So like it's just it's just funny to me that like everyone's just kind of in their own swim lane and nobody's like zooming out a little bit so if I was David like look.

[24:19] Look you can wait for Harry Potter it's going to come out in May and oh by the way that's a canada exclusive for all you guys Harry Potter is not going to be shown in April.

[24:28] So if you're waiting for Harry Potter it's going to be a may reveal and so you're going to have you know at least two weeks between Kong and barrels until you see Potter.

[24:42] I think it's really going to be funny to me so whatever if if I'm David I'll be like look.

[24:48] Look here's the other thing with this game of ours you know not only do we put all of our heart and soul and do it it's not going to be one of these unlimited games this is going to be one model that comes with everything.

[25:00] And I can't wait for you guys to see it.

[25:04] And if it is doom and I've been telling this to my boys over there guys just say it.

[25:10] Say it.

[25:11] You don't have to like show anything that you're waiting on license or approval.

[25:16] But we want to let you know that you know you're going to you're going to want to go watch the dune movies again because when you see what we've done.

[25:25] And how awesome it is to watch the magic of that universe come the life under glass like just.

[25:31] Just rip the bandaid off if it is.

[25:34] You know like I said I think it's going to be goonies or maybe a little shop of a horrors.

[25:39] I don't know it I don't think it's goonies because David or Brian Savage has confirmed in the email that the ball gets eaten.

[25:46] So why would the ball be eaten in goonies.

[25:51] Um this is this is a good time to fill her.

[25:54] Sean I'm happy I'm filling for you as you're waiting for your flight.

[25:59] Look gang I just I just don't get it.

[26:04] Look stern knows they don't really need to do much around L winning Kong but what what the other thing I heard is this there's no spike three with Kong.

[26:14] So that's also annoying is like you know stern's got this new platform and they continue they continue to remember spike three was supposed to have launched with Metallica remastered now we've got three games that won't have it as the platform.

[26:32] Here's why I think they're holding it back is they know it comes with a price increase.

[26:38] I bet it was the plan to put it into Kong but stern knows if they raise prices now with what's happening in the world.

[26:46] It's it's just it's going to be brutal.

[26:50] I um I like many of you.

[26:54] I like many of you probably have lost six figures or more in two days or three days whatever it's been.

[27:01] Six figures on paper right nothing I was ever going to like I wasn't going to sell anything or trade anything it'll always come back and you know the investment strategies when you go through these recessionary periods is to keep investing like that's the whole point like you keep putting money in.

[27:17] You buy in the bad times and ride them up when times are good.

[27:22] And like my advisor says you when you're in the market for decades you really only make money 13 days out of the year but in

[27:30] but you want to be in it on those 13 days to really really make money.

[27:35] Um

[27:37] Sputters Kong sells great without spike three.

[27:42] Uh, that doesn't make any sense Keith like you're not going to if you you're not going to put spike three into John Wick and it's going to help sales.

[27:49] So I just I just want to say what I think is going to happen is I think that barrels is so focused on getting the game ready.

[27:59] That they've forgotten what marketing looks like they forgot in what marketing is and the only time you can turn marketing off is when you don't need to market the title because it's so popular you don't need to market Pokemon.

[28:14] You don't need to market Star Wars you don't need to market.

[28:19] Um Harry Potter you don't need to market back to the future but if you've got dune.

[28:26] You need to do real marketing to get people excited.

[28:30] If you've got dune you need to like start the hype window well before 90s out.

[28:37] If you've got dune you need to be much more transparent in building a community of people that are excited to see the following title.

[28:45] And that's that's it.

[28:47] That's it.

[28:48] And I think there is a level of like like I don't know I don't know the word it's they're not smug people.

[28:55] I just think they're they think it's cute right to keep everything a secret like that's our thing like no nothing leaks from barrels of fun.

[29:02] Yeah you guys are right nothing leaks but you also don't do anything else.

[29:06] So nothing leaks but you're not doing anything to generate excitement or hype.

[29:10] And I think you're going to learn a really really harsh lesson come come a you know come nine days from now.

[29:18] They're dune.

[29:20] Yeah all these they're dune.

[29:22] You know all these things like you're I think they're going to get I think they're going to get clobbered by Kong.

[29:28] If what they have is dune and they haven't spent enough time getting people connected to the game because because remember like it's not like you're going to have a week or two guys where like everyone's focused on your dune game.

[29:42] You you might have hours before King Kong is revealed.

[29:46] And if I'm them if I'm them I'm releasing the game tomorrow tomorrow.

[29:54] You you need to get a window of exclusivity and you need to manufacture that if I'm David Van S get gang.

[30:06] I David Brian you guys you got money or smart gentleman I talked to you you can't do this.

[30:14] You can't buy a 300 dollar microphone and flip open your laptop it's free to stream on YouTube.

[30:22] Why aren't you doing this?

[30:24] If you get I told us to Blake give me give me the assets now.

[30:30] Let I will sign an NDA I would never burn anybody gang.

[30:35] I had in my phone guns and roses for an entire year the actual white wood of the game.

[30:43] Eric knew I had it.

[30:47] Can you I had it Jack knew I had it and I said to them gentlemen.

[30:53] I'm not going to burn you.

[30:55] I'm not going to burn you I'm not going to release your hard work before trying.

[30:59] But I could talk about how excited I was for everybody to see it.

[31:03] And as I told Blake in that moment.

[31:05] Give me something.

[31:06] Give me something exciting and I'll start to get people excited.

[31:10] Don't I'm not going to burn you show me the game show me the game.

[31:18] You know I'll sign an NDA and I can at least talk about what I saw.

[31:22] Because what you want is someone like canada being like wow.

[31:26] Can't wait for you to see it even I was looking gang.

[31:28] I I don't think evil deads a good theme and then it blew me away.

[31:33] So I think do needs to do the same thing is if it but here's what I heard I heard Kong is loaded.

[31:39] I heard people that have seen it are so excited.

[31:42] I heard Kong is killer.

[31:45] And it's it's going to you know the the whatever it is like the mystery of terror island or something or the myth of terror island.

[31:53] So I look I think these guys are going to go up against an 800 pound gorilla and it's actually like an 8000 pound gorilla.

[32:02] And I and I like my friends over there but you know is what I do for a living do marketing for a living.

[32:12] My bill rate is is is a lot of money and I offer my services for free to my friends in the in the hobby.

[32:20] And I think that it's not hard it's not hard to do pinball marketing but it's it's seemingly like these guys don't even understand the very concept of what works the best.

[32:31] And what works the best is is transparency and hype and excitement and a personal connection between product.

[32:39] You know and look I get I mean it like I like it's actually even more so having a live something like this where you guys can answer quite like if I David Van Esch would be in this seat.

[32:50] Talking to you guys because everyone he connects with is another potential customer.

[32:55] Yeah these feature at videos don't do that they're they're more like pre canned marketing materials they're fine but man they don't they don't give you a personal connection.

[33:07] They're edited right there look at the Jersey Jack I'm a hundred thousand dollar video where they brought in fake lighting to pretend the game glow like it did they lied to you all it was bait and switch you could probably sue them for bait and switch I mean they basically.

[33:23] They brought in overhead UV lighting and pretend it like that's how the game looked in your game room is a lie is the biggest bait and switch ever.

[33:37] Well you look I again it's common sense.

[33:41] Nine days out these guys are doing nothing nine days out no materials nine days out you don't know what the reveal date is nine days out you don't know what time of day it is nine days out you can't plan a watch party with your friends nine days out.

[33:54] 52 weeks in a year you're going to launch your product on top of stern pinball Keith L. and game.

[33:59] Nine days out.

[34:02] What wake up gentlemen wake up.

[34:05] And the world's on fire right now economically good luck good luck.

[34:10] I just don't.

[34:12] There's going to be no photo to grab grab that game.

[34:16] It's just because they haven't created any formal.

[34:19] They haven't done anything they haven't said anything.

[34:25] You know and then you try to put it all in a blender at once it's not going to work out.

[34:30] Gang I did a podcast or alive a Saturday morning live there were 30s there were 30s something remaining evil dead games for sale by the time I show ended because I highlighted that and was added distributors 30 games sold in a matter of minutes 30 games.

[34:52] Yeah let's not give canada info.

[34:55] Keep them away look I was invited to both barrels and stern I just want to say thank you gentlemen for the invite I just can't make it I'm going to Scotland on Thursday for my brother and laws wedding.

[35:04] And I don't get back to like Tuesday.

[35:07] And I'm going to be exhausted and I've got work to do.

[35:11] And I really want to you know.

[35:14] I have work I mean I don't know any way around it like I have work.

[35:19] I'm kind of burn of occasion day.

[35:22] And also it's just so funny to me that stern paid for everybody's John Wick travel.

[35:27] And now they're not paying for your travel and people are still going to go like gang gang.

[35:32] Did you forget like why are you doing them favors why are you helping them sell products.

[35:38] And they can't just at least hook you up with a flight in a hotel room.

[35:44] Todd I'm going to miss you Todd do you know how to Todd on on the phone.

[35:49] Do you know how to flip the camera around because everyone was saying Todd tucking knows how to do it.

[35:54] But I'm assuming you're filming with a laptop not a phone.

[35:59] So I yeah no it's no I'm not spending my own money to then help these guys sell products like that like it's just that.

[36:10] Look because here's the deal like I don't know like it's just.

[36:15] Any other reason is like because they established a precedence where they would pay and now they won't.

[36:22] Jersey Jack did it right class act Brett and Leonard and Tom Capara and Eric Minier and Jersey Jack himself like they they paid for everybody to be in the room.

[36:35] If you brought us from your tor phone you could flip the camera what do you mean tor phone.

[36:42] No carry didn't know how to do it even carried tried to do it carry uses his laptop like me that's why it looks right now.

[36:53] It's new like cow move but.

[36:57] I mean move but man it's just like the fact that I'm I'm clicking with a guy named move but just says it all.

[37:07] You know Todd I'll have to give you a call want to figure this out because I know we couldn't figure it out for like two hours yesterday.

[37:17] Now it didn't work yesterday gang I tried it I tried it out to try again.

[37:24] Maybe I have to reset the phone with the camera not you know not mirror on the camera setting.

[37:30] So that's it gang.

[37:33] Look I think I'm going to call over to my friends at barrels after this.

[37:43] And I'm going to well.

[37:49] What makes you question these games are not going to be at fantastic yet fantastic is like.

[37:56] Like two days before they're revealing the that makes no sense to me why wouldn't they just mail a game to fantastic if you're.

[38:03] Did you did you ask David for for gang for a game.

[38:07] Like they're going to be in boxes.

[38:14] Or at least like ready for production.

[38:19] Happy Sunday morning gang.

[38:22] I just want to say like last night spending hours with the boys watching young boys.

[38:31] 11 months one is four years old the beauty of family and how.

[38:38] Sweet and genuine and loving and caring and emotional life is at that stage is just.

[38:48] It fills my heart it fills my heart.

[38:51] I also want to say I want to give a shout out to a new friend of mine Dave Frazier.

[38:56] Cool dude man he's been on my patreon for a while he lives one town over.

[39:01] And and you know I've really made like some a couple really really good friends in Frank D'Angelo Frank I love you brother and Dave Frazier.

[39:10] And it's just like at my age.

[39:13] I have almost 700 subscribers I meet people I chose.

[39:17] But it's it's hard to have like local people.

[39:21] That you can connect with and you have a good time with and you can nerd out over pinball.

[39:27] I think it's really important.

[39:29] And you know moving out of the city was tough because I've friends there.

[39:34] But I'll say getting older the toughest thing is.

[39:37] Is is maintaining an in real life.

[39:41] Connection to people.

[39:43] So important and it's what pinball does for us right it like it brings us together.

[39:48] With conversation that never gets old it brings us to.

[39:52] To like events and to barcage and to each other's homes to sort of enjoy the pinball machines.

[39:57] But it's just the connector it's a great connector.

[40:02] Let's see these people are talking about flipping camera Frenchy many artists best stuff is their old stuff.

[40:08] Whereas I think your evil dead might be your best work.

[40:12] What's your see look at you trying to interview franche on my show what's your secret for you.

[40:17] Franchie is evil dead is franchies best our package to date.

[40:21] It without a doubt.

[40:23] It's not even close in my honest opinion it blows away monsters it blows away Batman like it's just.

[40:29] It's stunning.

[40:31] I it's so stunning you know what I love about evil dead is unlike stern who sometimes uses artwork.

[40:37] To disguise the fact that there's not a lot in the game.

[40:41] What I love about evil dead is there's a lot of detail in the art.

[40:45] But there's even more stuff to do in the game like it is like it's the best of both worlds.

[40:50] It's like it's like all of it.

[40:52] All of it is there you know it's like wow are those trap doors are those like top up like medieval madness zombies are those.

[41:00] Yeah yeah yeah are those drop targets that work are those.

[41:04] But you know is that is that a flipper hiding by the right sling where it would normally be yeah all yeah like all this in it.

[41:14] It's awesome matrix is not happening.

[41:18] Okay guys I am I I'm very close to getting stebrichies theme.

[41:23] I'll tell you right now it's not top gun it's not matrix.

[41:26] Steve Richie's game is not in 80s or 90s title.

[41:32] That's enough information you're going to get from me.

[41:35] I think it's going to be another theme or like are people sorry people into this.

[41:42] Well I actually um I don't I don't really love god's oh 70th you know I saw it yesterday again.

[42:08] It's not as nice it's not nearly as nice as Elvira blood kiss to me god's oh 70th suffers from the fact that it was supposed to be an Ellie.

[42:17] It was supposed to look a lot nicer and a lot more and they had to like remove I think the the finishing details I'm going to tell you right now like evil dead blows blows away god's oh 70th in terms of like a.

[42:31] A representative is that even like a word in terms of presentation evil dead blows it away avatar looks much nicer than I don't know God's oh 70th to me gang it's just a little like yeah yeah yeah it's not as much fun.

[42:56] Evil dead will go up in price of Kong and Potter fall short.

[43:01] Yeah like look the good news about evil dead is there's never going to be that many of them out there and I think much like the movies is just going to become like a little bit of a cult classic pin that people who have it love it.

[43:16] And it's just you know like I'll say this like after playing it to I was like man I wish Rick and Morty was this much fun.

[43:24] You know I think the biggest the biggest the thing that sucks the most is Rick and Morty the code is so fun and the adventures and the callouts just some of the worst gameplay in history pimple.

[43:39] But this is like no way around it like there's not much to shoot in Rick and Morty it's just some of the worst gameplay ever.

[43:47] Yeah.

[43:52] Fred you should do it.

[43:55] You know for Chris I talk a lot to people about I think we're two Italian dudes who have like been at each other's throats.

[44:03] And I think we both ended up in a good place.

[44:08] I think we're going to be doing that so thank you for for having the capacity and your heart to forgive and to move on with me I think it's it's it's very.

[44:18] It's very honorable of you and I think there are some people out there who just don't possess that ability to forgive and move on and we know we went through some stuff and.

[45:00] I think we're going to have him back happy to have him commenting.

[45:05] So I think it's it's good like I'm not at odds with anybody I don't even I don't really have any open fights with anybody.

[45:15] In my face yeah no it's funny.

[45:18] I don't even know if anyone parody me so much and I'm I'm also just confused why he he like wears multiple headphones like I only wear like one just one headphones at a time so I'm just but you know it's cool it's cool I look it's it's the greatest form of flattery right I mean I don't think is like I watch people copy my format how long my shows are the consistency even like the way you do like Facebook updates like every I've been copied to the team.

[45:46] What I love about can it is pinball podcasts is I didn't copy anybody I didn't copy anybody style I didn't copy anybody's like approach I didn't copy anybody's anything and everybody copied me not everybody like you know but you know I'm talking like some people just copied everything I did it's cool in the end I'm glad I think it's good I think the shorter shows you know this franchi right it's like you put all that effort in like you know I'm not going to be a little bit more.

[46:15] I'm not going to put all that effort in like you can do like a two hour show with interview it's a ton of work it's it's so much work and then I realize like right people forget this my shows used to be 45 minutes to an hour of just me talking right I mean I realized like holy crap like it wasn't it wasn't worth it it was just like just quality over quantity just get right to the topics hit with it and get off stage.

[46:44] So I started doing less lengthy shows more frequent shows and and then like the lives were always like fun to do stuff like this unedited and you realize you can just kind of like don't have to put in all the effort because the production stuff is just a nightmare.

[47:02] Right I mean I did and franchi I hear the same thing why don't you do more interviews franchi gets this there are some people in this hobby well you'll interview them for an hour two hours and they are impossible to re air how they talk with like um um like you know you know like and so you go back and you listen to it is like all these awkward pauses and then the way they talk is in very entertaining and so you have to go and.

[47:32] Edit them to make it more enjoyable hours hours like sometimes it could take eight to 10 hours to get a two hour interview ready for your listening pleasure and to franchi's point for zero dollars what it's like what a distributor gets to just like hey guys King Kong at least and put 50 thousand dollars in their checking account like that day and just drop ships the games to customers.

[48:03] You know it's true you know it's true.

[48:10] What do you guys want to talk about we got more people here man I love it Sunday morning can a day hit he hit again.

[48:17] He hit again he did it two days in a row.

[48:21] Um I uh I hear predators sucks.

[48:25] Sit I knew it would suck I just hear it doesn't have Arnold in it and I don't know man what do you think of portal uh I don't know I can't really make an opinion about portal till I play it uh which I think will happen maybe never because I don't know anyone who's gonna have it like Mike it automated doesn't have multi morphing so where are you gonna where am I gonna play portal unless I

[48:55] go through a physical portal and end up somewhere that has it.

[49:00] I think with all multi morphing it like it looks neat I also just like I don't know they did they even shift the princess brides with the collectors addition cabinets yet.

[49:11] I think Jerry's one of these companies too that like when when stuff really when the recession does come like.

[49:17] I mean it's just gonna be brutal man I just the amount like only the stronger gonna survive only the strong appal and what's up brother it's good seeing him and how's the family doing appal and I was thinking about our fun lunch at uh at loma son the other day.

[49:35] Predator is not gonna be good it's not gonna be good name me one good pinball brothers game that pinball brothers designed from the ground up.

[49:43] And I'll wait uh in eternity for you to come up with an answer same team same team it in higher jack danger then in higher like Dennis Nordman let's talk about you dog and on my screen name when I was trying to support your point move but.

[50:01] Well when you when you call yourself move but you know you gotta sort of you gotta sort of expect there to be a somewhat of a confusing thing.

[50:09] Chris your show is always informative and holds no punches you speak from your heart a lot of times to which is great I like someone who tells it like it is and doesn't beat around the bush well thank you Robert.

[50:21] You know for those of you out there who are not a member of canada's pinball podcast it's like come on it's still fight all right there's no tariffs in canada land fight all there's a month canada pinball just go to canada pinball that patreon and sign up.

[50:38] Question is anyone out there met pinhead Patrick marino like I've been trying he's got like a picture of a parrot on his Facebook page and now he's I think he changed his photo to I think Adams family or something or but I just I always feel like I'm always getting into it with him on Facebook and I just I don't know why because he's just always online when I'm up at 5 a.m.

[51:02] But as anyone met him because it's just like it's hard to have seen a guy in my chats and in my on my page for years and the only picture of my see as a parrot I just I said I was a little bit I'm just tired of talking to a bird like who are and he wouldn't share photo of himself I just ask here's me here's my family just can you just show me what you look like and he just refuse to send a photo I was like it's like weird in my honest opinion.

[51:33] Wow first grandchild coming this week our daughter graduate in college in May wow.

[51:39] Paul and that's so amazing you must feel so proud I mean I'm just happy my kids are so young now Paul and because like I feel like college won't even be a thing by the time these kids are of college age I won't have to spend like half a million dollars on college.

[51:53] You know it's crazy is my daycare 70 to 2000 dollars a year you know what people are like college is so expensive like my pay 70 2000 a year for daycare for how to tie your shoes and fall in love with Paw Patrol.

[52:07] Well you know the thing is is like when you think about like why people go to college is like to learn information right information which now is for the most part unless you're learning a real skill information which is now 100 all of the information in the world is like instantly available with like AI but what I'm going to push my kids to do and what I where there's a lot of things that I'm going to do is I'm going to do that.

[52:36] And what I were how I see I was never really guiding and and I love my parents and they they they gave me the best education in the world but what they didn't give me on top of that education.

[52:49] Was like guidance okay and I'll explain what I mean by that like when your son comes home and says he's going to study communications and he's going to do a job in public relations you kind of should have been like no what are you doing.

[53:03] Like what are you doing you like you know because I grew up and my dad was in finance and he worked in M&A and like so all these nice things were like the byproduct of working in finance and so I kind of was spoiled and and and probably felt like I was entitled to and like more enjoyable upbringing and we never were without anything we wanted but man I would probably you know he should have probably been a little bit more.

[53:31] If you want to maintain the lifestyle you grew up with you can't go do that and and he didn't do that now look I do love that my parents let us do whatever we wanted and like supported us and in the end like turned out to be you know successful in my own field but but you know I think more than that it's not even about finance or marketing I think the thing that I've learned is I just want my children to have skill sets that are real.

[54:00] That won't be obsolete because of a technology I want them to have skill sets where they could become their own bosses and they can control their own destiny and that's because to me if I were to think about like what's the one thing I really learned that I would love for them to never have to suffer through because if you think about life as this combination of pleasure and pain and apparent should help guide their children to avoid the problems that they're having.

[54:30] They've been employed some of the suffering they went through and we all suffer in different ways gang I mean it's everybody like life is suffering like if you believe in Buddhism and the existence of life the moment in these beautiful children of mine they don't know that one they don't know one thing yet they don't know they're going to die like they don't know there's an end they don't know that they're ever going to have to live without their parents with I remember the day I realized like the the infinite length of passing away and being.

[55:00] It's when that when that cascades into life it's what leads us all to buy stupid Pimom machines right where time is limited time is short like once you realize that you start to act differently you start to process things differently but what I don't want them to ever have is something that I've carried with me for a really long time and that's just these overwhelming this overwhelming anxiety that I've carried with me my whole career because that that like just at any moment.

[55:28] You can be let go and it can be over and you'd have to like start over again and I look I've been fired three times in my career I've had other times were like Pimbal manufacturers try to get me fired and it's like it sucks it sucks that like doesn't matter how hard I work how much value I create your name's on on the door and it's not a business that you control you're you're at the mercy of somebody else and I just feel like the modern world is turning a lot more into a place.

[55:58] That's all about the bottom line and you know the trend is to cut loose the people that have all the years of expertise in favor of you know junior people that don't really cost as much and don't have as much expertise and you're willing to just wing it.

[56:15] So that's that's it you know that's where I'm at and I want to help my children avoid that if I can.

[56:23] And money is not the answer it's more about self esteem self confidence and skills now that you know and I always say is the brand alike if I wake up tomorrow and I find myself without a career where I'm at I will do everything I can to go get another you know source of income and I feel like I have the skills set and I have the charisma and I have the intelligence and I have the knowledge to do it and I also and I mean this when I say this game.

[56:52] Knowing so many amazing people in this hobby I do feel like we would all help each other out if if the time came where we would need to help each other out and I think what we're about to go through as a world and as a society and as it like there may be times when we need to help each other and I mean that and a lot of us like again it's not just financially you know I know some of the wealthiest people in the world are inside or are dying you know so like it's it's tough you know I have a family member right now who's a big one.

[57:21] I have a family member right now who's unfortunately you know has some very grave medical news and it's just it is it's a it's a it's a tough time you know and I think this is a fun hobby to find help right and we don't talk about right right like you become an adult you're like you guys just survive and great and you but but but but but but but I don't know like it's a different thing you know a different thing like we we we we should help each other out and I just like I don't know what I'm saying is really good and I'm not sure if I can do it.

[57:48] Like it's a different thing you know a different thing like we we we should help each other out.

[57:52] We should give Canadian the assets to barrels of funds new game and let them start the hype train.

[57:57] These guys are nine days out and they're seemingly doing nothing they're just trying to get the game ready I don't care about the game being ready barrels where you've been went when is a game have to even be ready to take money on it.

[58:11] Next turn doesn't even like finish a game before they ship it to you.

[58:15] You don't have to say they didn't even game test X men before it was in a box and people were like guinea pigs.

[58:21] So you know I'm saying just get the game out.

[58:27] Ah barrel you know I was like I was thinking of like barrels of none is it barrels not well hung that was that was the name I came up with like if they dropped the ball on this.

[58:36] It's going to be barrels not well hung is my nickname for them.

[58:44] Do you think Alice buyers are going to drop out.

[58:48] Yeah yeah I do.

[58:52] But I think Melvin and you're going to hear more about this I think they've got I think they've got a plan that's going to work I think they're going to make most of the European games if not all the European games first.

[59:02] That'll give them a nice three to four to five month buffer so that by the time people are asked to pay for their US games hopefully you know we'll see some sort of resolution in what's happening with the tariffs.

[59:15] So they they can do that I think they're going to have some wiggle room on in terms of what is their strategy.

[59:22] Um peppered farm remembers when can it is with selling out yeah barrels of Dung now I'm not going to like that's.

[59:33] I don't think anything is going to be a big hit this year.

[59:38] Maybe Harry Potter I don't think Kong is going to be as big as people think because I again I just think like.

[59:46] I don't think Kong even has as much love as jaws does as a theme.

[59:52] So I think Kong is going to be you know it's going to get compared to Godzilla.

[59:58] But I just don't think Kong is going to have the same level of campiness and fun that Godzilla has.

[01:00:05] And you know and I think it's going to be more like Jurassic Park light is my guess on King Kong.

[01:00:13] The world is getting tougher by the day especially for young people just getting started.

[01:00:19] Well you know and Robert I mean you know if you follow history.

[01:00:23] What's going to help young people get going is is a huge recession.

[01:00:30] You know because what they're going to need is for things to go down in value and for stuff to crash a little bit.

[01:00:37] You know because as things but I don't know though because like I don't even think like real estate is going to crash because in these desirable towns there's no more inventory.

[01:00:46] You know there's something like three I want to say there's.

[01:00:52] 3000 billionaires in the world now there's 20 million millionaires in America.

[01:01:01] It's really expensive.

[01:01:06] I mean we still make pennies right didn't didn't trump cancel the creation of the penny.

[01:01:11] I don't think everyone's afraid to talk about the effects of mass immigration on the housing market I just don't think anyone wants to talk about the mass immigration on the housing market on a pinball show.

[01:01:28] How much is evil dead on used on Pinside let's go look I always forget I can do this like we can go look at stuff.

[01:01:36] Market evil dead.

[01:01:41] I'll say this the game I was like least impressed with was Metallica.

[01:01:47] Just look after playing evil dead Metallica looked really cheap.

[01:01:58] All right let's see.

[01:02:02] All right so I see.

[01:02:13] Two for sale.

[01:02:16] One is in Connecticut by me knew out of the box owner just open the box 1500 butter cabinet 14 dollar top or under 20 plays not interested in the theme.

[01:02:28] I mean okay.

[01:02:33] Which is fair but.

[01:02:37] What why'd you buy it.

[01:02:41] B. You got a knock about.

[01:02:45] 1500 dollars off that asking price because I just think like he's basically selling it for what he paid for it.

[01:02:51] I do not know you're not into something I'm I also think 20 plays is not enough.

[01:03:01] You know it's like I just think that's like.

[01:03:07] Why would you not just play it more and see if you like it more.

[01:03:11] Yeah Metallica to me when I stood over it after evil dead just it just looks so dated it looks so old.

[01:03:26] As soon as we just finished daycare yeah.

[01:03:31] I mean I will say this I would 100% get the butter cabinet that was the only thing I noticed on the evil dead yesterday is like.

[01:03:37] The standard just doesn't look as good as butter it's not even close I'd have to butter up every spooky game I got.

[01:03:46] It's just so much nicer game it's night and day.

[01:03:51] Let's see what else is happening in the pinball world.

[01:03:54] Did you see ice man tried to start a topic I saw this what what what a what a nasty thing to do to me.

[01:04:00] He tried to start a topic and I don't even I don't even know why you're still like mad at me man I like we don't even like.

[01:04:07] Of course bomb he's he tried to get people to cancel their memberships.

[01:04:12] Look at this.

[01:04:18] Yeah look at this.

[01:04:22] He started a thread and they closed it thank you pinside for actually but he he started a thread.

[01:04:30] Have you forgotten to turn off your auto pay for five dollars twenty two days ago.

[01:04:35] Asking people to cancel their memberships of canada's pinball podcast.

[01:04:41] I just like what what what did I do and what if I continue to do to dug.

[01:04:48] That warrants this level of like why are you trying to hurt me from.

[01:04:53] From my hard work and this stuff I you know I create like you know and and and you look at it it's like.

[01:05:05] It's like it's something.

[01:05:10] Um.

[01:05:16] I want to look at the total number of post form activity.

[01:05:23] Let's see we're going to find.

[01:05:33] Somewhere it's fine you can scroll and just find the peoples.

[01:05:37] I'm going to look at the other one.

[01:05:42] I'm going to look at the other one.

[01:05:47] Like he started.

[01:05:52] He started another thread.

[01:05:54] When was locked.

[01:05:56] Another wasn't.

[01:05:58] He started another one don't forget to turn off your auto pay subs five dollars a month is still worth a couple of beers.

[01:06:05] Again using the five dollars a month because that's what that's what mine is.

[01:06:10] And.

[01:06:17] Okay then he writes don't we waste enough money on pinball definitely shouldn't pay for content inside his voluntary okay.

[01:06:25] So so Doug you don't pay for content.

[01:06:28] You don't pay for Netflix you don't pay.

[01:06:31] You do realize that you also pay for your for the internet which is providing you the content but anyway.

[01:06:39] Is the number I want to zoom in on.

[01:06:48] Look at this number here.

[01:06:52] Where can you get two beers for five dollars.

[01:06:56] 28,452 posts right think about that for a minute.

[01:07:05] 28,452 posts on pinside.

[01:07:14] 28,000 let's break that down.

[01:07:18] Like if you post it once a day let's do the calculator.

[01:07:26] Let's put that in 28,452 divided by 365 right.

[01:07:35] That should give us how many a day.

[01:07:39] Okay.

[01:07:41] That's.

[01:07:44] That's.

[01:07:47] 77.

[01:07:50] Post a day is that right 78 post a day.

[01:07:54] I don't even know if this is the how you do this math.

[01:07:58] Um.

[01:08:00] I just like I like it's like he's another one we're like I don't understand he's like friends with Bill brain is bills like one of my good friends and like.

[01:08:07] He's like mad at the success and like Doug I don't think it's successful I get you make a lot of money and finance but bro like what's the big deal.

[01:08:19] Like why is it still triggering you.

[01:08:22] And then he says the same thing as me man it's like that's the funny part is when you look at his.

[01:08:30] Like like this is like if if I was the topics he talks about another new inbox buying thread simple poll not whether you can afford it or not.

[01:08:41] Our new inbox games at these prices delivering the juice because they used home use only says otherwise yeah that's what I've been saying Doug on my show.

[01:08:50] And for I think him and I like almost to the tea.

[01:08:56] Like think exactly the same about modern pinball pricing.

[01:09:00] You know I just it's just it's strange to be so angry at the guy that's like saying exactly what you're saying you know you always you always calls me nasty names but do I'm saying exactly what you're saying.

[01:09:15] Let's see something here trying to see like there's anything popping right now Harry Potter and not going to see it until May.

[01:09:26] Let's see I'm still waiting man.

[01:09:30] Do you guys want another let's see.

[01:09:41] I just don't I just think he's mad I think there's a difference there.

[01:09:47] What do we think.

[01:09:51] How is this game aging in your minds.

[01:09:57] I mean I am.

[01:10:00] You know the one thing I wish this game had it was a butter cabinet.

[01:10:06] It looks good but it's not radical good.

[01:10:11] And it's a collectible work of art.

[01:10:14] I think this game is like.

[01:10:16] It's still looking pretty sexy right I mean I still am a little confused as to why nobody.

[01:10:23] It's streamed the game.

[01:10:26] And the final game is this is still one of the pre production units or game number one that wrench has.

[01:10:34] I'm going down here there's Melvin my boy with a tour of Dutch.

[01:10:40] But like where where where the games.

[01:10:45] There's two for sale right now.

[01:10:50] Let's do this let's look at market.

[01:10:54] Let's look at.

[01:10:57] All right John Wickele.

[01:11:09] I mean I wouldn't even have paid 10 five for it.

[01:11:14] I mean this is I mean the poor poor poor distros poor distros sitting on these games trying to move them.

[01:11:20] Let's look at D&D see if there's any more D&Ds on the market.

[01:11:26] I mean you're you're you're you're you're you're you know you know this guy's not getting 11.

[01:11:42] You know so right away.

[01:11:46] You know this guy's going to be able to this is this is the same guy holy crap.

[01:11:51] The same guy selling evil dead.

[01:11:54] It in Connecticut and same thing under 20 plays just open the box not wait is this it.

[01:12:01] Is this a distro have we just exposed like who who's Wally 16 who has the same exact description this guy selling games for distros.

[01:12:12] And he's trying to like move distro buddy games like I think we just who's wall come on this guy.

[01:12:19] I unbox both brand new games says he doesn't like the theme.

[01:12:24] And he needs to move them on right away after 20 plays what what what what.

[01:12:28] This guy's this is this is this is like a fake description.

[01:12:33] What but no but this this this is like perfect example of someone just trying to do like.

[01:12:40] Something shady here.

[01:12:45] Is he tied to automate it.

[01:12:50] I don't know.

[01:12:56] I do know this that like if you if you just see what I don't get about anybody who bought D&D early right away is I don't you know the market.

[01:13:07] Oh did I just did I just mess up.

[01:13:14] Did our chat just end.
