[00:00] Ah, good morning everybody, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcaster

[00:18] that has self-worth issues.

[00:20] On this episode, we are going to get right to it and in like 20 minutes, do what other

[00:24] shows take 2 hours to do.

[00:26] So what do I want to talk about today?

[00:28] It's Wednesday, we're waiting for the new Stern teaser to come out any Friday now.

[00:33] We're going to talk about that when I think it's going to happen, I'm getting mixed reports

[00:37] and so we are going to discuss Venom or James Bond and when we will see it.

[00:42] I want to talk about Spooky Pinball.

[00:45] They're doing a Saturday morning Spooktacular this Saturday morning at 10am.

[00:51] They are copying Canada's format doing a Facebook live Q&A.

[00:56] I've got some questions for Spooky but the ultimate question I have is this, if you've

[01:00] been in the Halloween thread, people are starting to debate whether or not these games have

[01:05] hit rock bottom in pricing and if the price of these games will increase over time.

[01:11] I want to talk about that.

[01:13] Haggis Pinball is back online and in real big letters Damien has put sold out over the

[01:20] website.

[01:21] Wow, sold out.

[01:22] You guys are super successful.

[01:24] We're going to talk a little bit about Haggis because there's someone who ordered a game

[01:29] who paid in fall who was told eight weeks he would have his product.

[01:34] I'm going to tell you how long this person has been waiting and they still have no game.

[01:42] At what point are we going to say this company is really, really struggling?

[01:47] And then let's talk about the fall into winter of Pinball and what we think is going to happen

[01:52] in this Pinball marketplace.

[01:54] Super interesting time as we wait for Stern's next release.

[01:58] So let's start there.

[01:59] When is Stern Pinball going to put out the teaser for their next title?

[02:04] Now what Stern normally does is a Friday teaser and then a dealer call on Monday or Tuesday

[02:11] and then the fall game reveal happens on a Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.

[02:16] Now I've been getting reports that the teaser is going to happen this Friday or next Friday

[02:23] and then I've got people chiming in on the thread saying actually it's going to be first

[02:28] or second week in September.

[02:30] You know what that leads me to believe?

[02:32] Nobody knows.

[02:33] Nobody really knows when Stern is dropping the next title.

[02:37] But what I know is this.

[02:38] Stern Pinball is the most efficient and the most effective at getting a game on the line.

[02:45] So here's what I think has happened over at Stern Pinball, why they've been doing these

[02:48] back orders.

[02:49] I think Stern Pinball probably has at least two titles complete and ready to go at a moment's

[02:57] notice and I think they can shuffle the deck.

[02:59] I think James Bond is done and I think Venom is done and I bet you Jack Danger's or Keith

[03:06] Elwin's next pin is really close to being done.

[03:10] These designers have not stopped working on their titles.

[03:14] Like once John Borg put out Rush, he's been working on his next title since then.

[03:19] Same thing with Keith Elwin in Godzilla.

[03:21] So I think Stern Pinball probably has about 4-5 games very far into development and I

[03:28] bet like 3 games are almost ready to go.

[03:31] Remember Stern Pinball is the only real pinball company out in the world that knows how to

[03:37] do this.

[03:38] They have probably ordered all of the parts for at least two new titles coming out.

[03:42] They don't wing it.

[03:44] They don't take non-refundable deposits.

[03:47] They don't reveal a game and then make you wait 4 months to get the LE.

[03:51] This company knows what they're doing.

[03:53] And I've said it before, it's been a golden opportunity for everyone else not named Stern

[03:59] Pinball to come out with something and take advantage of this gap in the marketplace because

[04:05] if Venom comes out or James Bond comes out in a couple weeks, here's the scary part for

[04:10] everybody else.

[04:11] These games come out and they are pretty much completed and they've got amazing toys and

[04:16] they're beautiful and they're sexy.

[04:18] This is the worst possible thing to happen for all of you out there waiting on your toy

[04:23] story collector's editions.

[04:26] It's the worst thing to happen for American Pinball that's waited forever to get the next

[04:30] game out and revealed.

[04:32] It's the worst thing to happen for Queen Pinball and the Pinball brothers.

[04:37] Because at these price points, I think most people are going to be very, very selective

[04:42] of where they spend their money and there is no better bet in all of Pinball than buying

[04:48] a Stern machine.

[04:50] Not only will you get probably the best gameplay in all of Pinball, you're going to get the

[04:55] most code complete game in all of Pinball.

[04:58] And the other thing is this, the games will hold their value pretty much better than anyone

[05:03] else's machines.

[05:04] And here's why.

[05:05] The other part, I think people forget sometimes.

[05:07] Yes, there are anomaly titles out there like Pirates of the Caribbean from Jersey Jack

[05:12] Pinball, but for the most part, the reason why Stern Pinball's hold their value so well

[05:17] is the majority of collectors out there collect Stern Pinball machines.

[05:22] You have much greater demand and there's a much larger community around Stern than everybody

[05:29] else and Stern has earned that.

[05:31] They earn that community, they earn that love and they earn the respect from the Pinball

[05:36] lovers of the world because they deliver time and time again.

[05:41] Now they don't always make masterpieces.

[05:43] They don't always make the greatest games, but they keep making games.

[05:47] And I think all of us over the last six months, we've felt how boring this hobby is when Stern

[05:54] Pinball turns itself off.

[05:56] How boring is it, right?

[05:57] Because when Stern Pinball stops releasing new games, it shines a light on every butty

[06:03] else.

[06:04] And everyone else, I mean this when I say it, everyone else for the most part is simply

[06:09] winging it.

[06:10] Look at Haggis Pinball, okay?

[06:12] It has been over a year since they took people's nonrefundable deposits.

[06:16] And so here's what I read on the Haggis Thread, in which Haggis themselves won't even comment

[06:20] on any of this.

[06:21] But they took someone's money and they said, if you pay in fall, you will have your game

[06:26] in eight weeks.

[06:27] Okay, so guess how many weeks have gone by since that person paid in fall?

[06:32] This person on Pinside said it has been 20 weeks now since they paid in fall and they

[06:38] still don't have their game.

[06:41] When are we going to, as a community, stop pretending that this company isn't in big

[06:46] trouble?

[06:47] I mean, if your Haggis Pinball, what were your projections and how did you tell people

[06:52] that they would have their game in eight weeks and now it's been 20 weeks?

[06:57] So eight months is two months.

[06:59] You'll have your game in two months.

[07:01] 20 weeks, are you ready for it?

[07:02] Is five months and the person still does not have their game.

[07:07] And Haggis Pinball, when they launched this company, they said they would not take payment

[07:12] in fall until your game is in a box and ready to ship to you.

[07:18] See, then when I say this company's being disingenuous or they're lying, I use the L

[07:23] word, how is this not a lie?

[07:25] Like if someone says to me, you're going to have this in eight weeks, nine weeks go by,

[07:30] 10 weeks, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 weeks.

[07:34] It's going to be 21 weeks at the end of this week and this person still doesn't have a

[07:39] game.

[07:40] So were they lying to him?

[07:41] Were they misleading the person?

[07:43] And this is why, ladies and gentlemen, the boutique pinball space, it's just not worth

[07:48] it.

[07:49] It's absolutely not worth it.

[07:51] And it's just crazy to me, right?

[07:53] And there's still no communication.

[07:55] Can you imagine, ladies and gentlemen, can you imagine if you were the head of a pinball

[07:59] company like Haggis Pinball?

[08:01] If you built your company from this community, right?

[08:04] You built your company from pin side, from the pinball shows, and you built your company

[08:09] saying to everybody, we're going to talk to you.

[08:12] We're going to be transparent with each and every one of you.

[08:15] Can you imagine if your company's thread on pin side was having a lot of conversation

[08:20] happening and you refused to enter your own company's thread and give your own customers

[08:26] and the community updates?

[08:28] Think about that for a minute.

[08:29] How crazy is that?

[08:31] And the reason why they're not doing it is they don't want to face the music.

[08:34] They don't want to hear people say, what are you doing?

[08:37] Like why did you tell people eight weeks?

[08:39] Why did you tell people pay in full?

[08:41] And the other part is this, go into the Haggis thread, read people's feedback on the game.

[08:46] They're having issues with the code.

[08:47] They're having issues with the gameplay.

[08:50] And people are saying, I have no idea what to shoot.

[08:52] I have no idea.

[08:53] This game does not indicate to you what shots to hit next.

[08:56] Like the inserts aren't really helping people because you know why?

[09:00] Because the majority of people who bought this game, you're so used to playing games

[09:05] from companies like Stern Pinball.

[09:07] And you're so used to modern pinball experiences that when you hop on a game like this, it's

[09:12] not going to be as enjoyable as what you're used to.

[09:16] And I think people are somewhat confused as they play this game.

[09:19] Now I just have one simple question out there.

[09:20] I want to challenge someone out there.

[09:22] Marty, Robbins, please, come on.

[09:24] Someone must know Marty who listens to this show.

[09:27] Marty, can you just be transparent and tell us how many fathoms have you built to date?

[09:33] How many?

[09:34] Why is this such a mystery?

[09:36] But at least the website is back online.

[09:38] That means everything is okay.

[09:39] The last question I have is how long can they continue to burn?

[09:43] How long can they continue to pay all that money and have the overhead and have no games

[09:48] going out the door?

[09:50] There's no way.

[09:51] I think there was 250 mermaid editions, 250.

[09:55] And I think they haven't even made 22 dates, 20.

[09:59] And this is a company that said back in April of 2021, production would start in July and

[10:05] be done by the end of the year.

[10:07] And Marty's game would be revealed at Expo 2021.

[10:10] Go back, people, and look at the dates and tell me that Canadian is not the best pinball

[10:14] podcaster on the planet.

[10:16] All right.

[10:17] So enough with the haggis.

[10:18] It's spooky because this is funny.

[10:19] So spooky pinball.

[10:20] Spooky pinball is a company that sold 1,750 games with nonrefundable deposits.

[10:27] And for everybody out there who's been following these two titles, Ultraman and Halloween,

[10:31] there has been a pretty much a market collapse on both titles.

[10:36] And what I mean by market collapse, it's this.

[10:38] It means before you took possession of your game, your game lost about $2,000 in value.

[10:45] So these games were about 9,000 and 9,500.

[10:49] With a butter cabinet, it's over $10,000.

[10:52] Now people, we need to remind everybody when these games were unveiled to the world, does

[10:56] everyone remember how they did it?

[10:58] They announced both titles.

[11:01] They took nonrefundable pre-orders on both titles and they didn't show you the game.

[11:07] You didn't see the game.

[11:08] You didn't see the layout.

[11:09] You didn't see anything.

[11:10] Now I would argue that there was a reason why they didn't show anything because they

[11:14] knew the games were not far along.

[11:17] And they knew that if they showed you the sort of Spartan code on both machines, that

[11:22] people would not have spent nonrefundable deposits on these games.

[11:26] But it was also a period in which there was a drought in new titles, right?

[11:31] Demand was through the roof.

[11:32] COVID was making everybody go crazy.

[11:35] We were throwing money at everything.

[11:37] People were buying stranger things, LEs for $18,000, Pire to the Caribbean was selling

[11:42] for $40,000.

[11:44] It was like we couldn't throw money fast enough at Pimball.

[11:48] Everybody had like cabin fever because of COVID and I had to have my toy.

[11:52] Like I was going to live for today, not for tomorrow.

[11:55] And spooky Pimball, what could possibly go wrong?

[11:57] Like look at Rick and Morty.

[11:58] Those games, they sold out in a few hours and the Rick and Morty prices held steady and

[12:03] went up in value right away.

[12:05] And you could have flipped the Rick and Morty in like one day for like $2,000 to $3,000

[12:09] over what you paid for it.

[12:10] So what could possibly go wrong if I went in on Halloween in Ultraman?

[12:14] And then we saw the games and then we saw the gameplay and then we saw the animations

[12:20] and then we saw the code and then we saw all the bugs and then we saw Hedge Multi-Bot and

[12:25] then we saw everything and then immediately here's what happened.

[12:28] A lot of people who put deposits down, they wanted out.

[12:31] They didn't see a game they wanted to spend $9,000 on.

[12:36] And so the market got really soft right away and you couldn't even find someone to buy your

[12:41] game for like a thousand off.

[12:43] And I think most people who wanted to flip their game realized you're either going to

[12:48] sell it for a huge loss or you're just going to walk away from your deposit and absolutely

[12:53] get nothing back.

[12:54] Now that brings us to today and I go into the Halloween thread and I want to read something

[12:59] for all of you.

[13:00] This is from pin side user, Kerbin.

[13:02] He writes, the Godzillas have held their value.

[13:05] The Halloween's drop significantly.

[13:08] I largely blame the K-Man.

[13:11] I think it's tough to recover from bad initial word of mouth.

[13:15] Look back at Stranger Things archives.

[13:17] A lot of premiums were listed for around 6K.

[13:20] That said, K wasn't necessarily wrong with anything he said.

[13:25] It's just that he seems to whip the pinball crowd into a frenzy and Hazard had too much

[13:31] power to shift momentum.

[13:33] Halloween is unique compared to most of my pins.

[13:35] Not sure how to describe it, but it seems more methodical.

[13:39] So is it the K-Man's fault that the reception to Halloween was so poor?

[13:44] Or maybe it was Spooky Pinball's fault.

[13:47] Maybe it was their fault for letting their talented software people leave.

[13:51] Maybe it was their fault for not looking over hedge multi-bought and fixing it.

[13:55] And maybe it was their fault for hiring a local animator who made some of the worst

[14:00] animations in pinball history.

[14:02] But you know what?

[14:03] It's K-Man's fault.

[14:04] What does he know?

[14:05] He doesn't really play pinball.

[14:07] He's just being negative Nancy.

[14:08] He's so toxic.

[14:09] It's not my fault, people.

[14:11] I didn't make this game.

[14:12] I didn't make Godzilla.

[14:13] I didn't make Guns N' Roses.

[14:15] I don't make pinball machines.

[14:16] I just give you my opinions about them.

[14:19] And if people can't formulate their own opinions about these machines, I think something's

[14:24] wrong with you.

[14:25] And I don't think that I make you think a certain way about a game.

[14:29] I think when I say stuff about a game, it clicks with you.

[14:33] I think I'm the only pinball podcaster out there that will say this stuff because everybody

[14:38] else is worried about burning their relationships and burning the bridges.

[14:42] And most of them have tight friendships with the companies or they're selling you the product.

[14:48] Now look, I think universally when spooky pinball launched these games, there is a reason why

[14:53] everybody felt sour about them because they never should have launched the games in the

[14:58] condition they were in.

[14:59] Now let's fast forward to today to the question of today, which is this.

[15:03] Do I think these games are going to be able to turn around and will their value increase

[15:09] over time once they stop production and once they fix all the bugs in the game?

[15:16] A lot of owners are saying these games are very buggy and they really can't wait for

[15:20] spooky pinball to fix all the bugs.

[15:22] Now let's just say right now a Halloween is worth $7,500.

[15:27] That seems to be the going price for a Halloween machine.

[15:31] That's about a $1,500 to $2,000 loss based on shipping and taxes for owners.

[15:36] Do I think this game is ever going to be worth more than that?

[15:40] Will it make a little bit of a U-turn?

[15:42] I'm here to tell you right now, I don't think so.

[15:44] I don't think so.

[15:45] I think these games are going to continue to go down in value.

[15:51] I think both of these games are going to end up being worth around $6,500 to $7,000.

[15:58] And let me explain why.

[16:00] The reason why these games are going to continue to go down in value is spooky pinball's next

[16:05] game is going to be such an improvement over these two games.

[16:10] These games were made by the spooky JV team and they know this.

[16:14] They lost the talent that made the other titles more special and they really put the

[16:19] JV team on the court.

[16:21] Now with the next game, we are going to see if the JV players have either honed their

[16:28] skills more and are going to make a better game.

[16:31] And I also think spooky is going to hire people that belong more on a varsity team.

[16:37] I don't think code fixes these games or makes the demand come back to these games.

[16:42] This is not strange or things people.

[16:45] This is Halloween and Ultraman.

[16:46] I mean, Ultraman is an obscure title to begin with.

[16:49] So I don't even think that demand is ever going to come back because I don't think there

[16:52] was much demand for Ultraman ever.

[16:55] Halloween is the one where there's more of a fan base, but there's 1,250 of them.

[17:00] So that's not that rare of a machine that doesn't have that much demand to begin with.

[17:07] I just think there's a lot of forces that people forget about.

[17:09] I think there's a lot of forces like if you jump on a Godzilla and then you jump on a Halloween,

[17:16] you absolutely would walk away wanting a Godzilla premium over a Halloween.

[17:21] It's such a better shooting machine.

[17:23] Everything about it is better.

[17:25] So why would you spend the same amount of money and get a pin that is so much more mediocre

[17:30] than Godzilla?

[17:31] Because people, when it comes to the dollar amount, it's apples to apples.

[17:35] You're going to spend nine grand on a new and box Halloween or you could get Godzilla

[17:38] premium.

[17:39] I mean, it's not even close how much better Godzilla is.

[17:43] But when Scooby-Doo comes out and I think it's going to have more in it, I think it's

[17:46] going to have more toys, I think it's going to have better animations, I think it's going

[17:50] to have better code, I think it's going to have everything better than Halloween.

[17:54] And so look, I just think Halloween slides down to 6,500, 7,000.

[17:59] I think the owners of the machine are going to be like, why doesn't everybody realize

[18:03] how much fun it is, how much fun I'm having with it in my home environment?

[18:08] And look, if you own a Halloween and you're enjoying it, good for you.

[18:12] But I'm just here to tell you, my prediction is these games are going to keep going south.

[18:16] The only saving grace of the value of these machines that could bump them up a little

[18:21] bit, here's, you know what it is?

[18:22] Is that the rest of the pinball market is going bonkers on new and box prices, right?

[18:27] So if Halloween is 7,500 and now we've got every JJP now is 12K or 15K and you've got

[18:34] almost every other machine from every manufacturer inching closer to $10,000, all of a sudden

[18:40] getting a game in good condition for 7,500 bucks doesn't seem like a bad deal.

[18:47] So I think the market going up is going to help stabilize these Halloween and Ultramans

[18:51] around $7,000.

[18:53] But I don't think you're ever going to see people like rediscover these pins and go bonkers

[18:58] for them.

[18:59] These games are not going to have some sort of emotional turnaround like a Deadpool or

[19:03] a stranger things.

[19:04] It's not going to happen because I just don't think the talent is there to turn these games

[19:08] around.

[19:09] There's far greater talent at Stern Pinball coding their machines.

[19:13] Spooky Pinball is at a crossroads.

[19:15] They really are.

[19:16] Their next game is everything.

[19:19] It is everything.

[19:20] I don't think people are going to throw money at it right away.

[19:22] I don't think we're going to do nonrefundable deposits.

[19:25] They need to prove to us that they can make a game that is worthy of $10,000, right?

[19:33] Of $9,000 to $10,000.

[19:35] They need to make a game.

[19:36] Get ready for this people.

[19:37] They need to make a game that actually has a toy in it.

[19:40] Look at Halloween in Ultraman.

[19:42] What toy is in the game?

[19:44] There's not one single toy.

[19:45] They also need to make a game from the ground up that was designed to be that theme.

[19:52] They did not design these two games to be Halloween or Ultraman.

[19:55] They said it was John Wick.

[19:57] They did not design Rick and Morty to be Rick and Morty.

[19:59] It was TNA too.

[20:01] So I really think Spooky Pinball needs to show us what they can do.

[20:06] Rebound up design of the theme if it's Scooby-Doo and just make some toys and make the animations

[20:12] good.

[20:13] They need to make sure they can make a game that is as least as good as a Stern Pro if

[20:18] they want to charge these prices.

[20:20] And look, this is nothing personal.

[20:21] I mean, look, they've just been in the game long enough to do that.

[20:25] All right.

[20:26] So what do you think about my assessment of Spooky Pinball?

[20:29] I will read your answers on the air next show.

[20:33] Make it short though.

[20:34] Don't make it like paragraphs.

[20:35] CanadianPinball.com.

[20:36] Now, speaking of feedback, right?

[20:39] Because people are giving feedback to Spooky Pinball on the code on Halloween and Spooky

[20:43] is listening like, I'll give Spooky this.

[20:45] Like I like that they're transparent.

[20:47] I like that they're in the thread.

[20:49] I like that they actually talk to their buyers.

[20:52] Like they're not afraid of people the way Haggis is.

[20:55] They're not afraid to communicate with people the way JJP is.

[20:58] Like they're in the thread with their buyers.

[21:01] The other game out there, people, which is like, I think it's a masterpiece, but clearly

[21:05] after owning it for like a year and a half, I think this community has given a lot of

[21:10] great feedback on code changes that would make Guns N' Roses Pinball a better game.

[21:17] I think Kiefer needs to address some of the imbalancing with the scoring.

[21:22] Someone said it best.

[21:23] They said, when you play Guns N' Roses, the problem with it from a scoring standpoint

[21:27] is it's so imbalanced that you don't even want to start a song.

[21:32] Like you're trying to delay starting the concert.

[21:35] You have to do all this stuff before the song to get to big points.

[21:39] And why is it that?

[21:41] And people are just asking for there to be more balance so that when you start a song,

[21:45] you can actually get to really big points while you're in the song.

[21:48] Because that's the whole point of this game is to get the concert going.

[21:52] You know, and I also think they could address the amount of multi-balls.

[21:55] I think they could address some of that stuff.

[21:57] You know, and here's the thing.

[21:58] It's like, I don't think they're going to do it, right?

[22:00] I mean, Kiefer hasn't even finished the Pirates of the Caribbean code.

[22:04] And for a company that only has one game out every two years, I think it is a little disappointing

[22:10] that we haven't seen Jersey Jack Pinball take in the feedback from the community and

[22:15] made many changes to the game.

[22:18] It's not a lot of changes, but it's some work to be done.

[22:21] And I wish they would have addressed some of it and really polish Guns N' Roses and

[22:26] make it the perfectly balanced concert going masterpiece pinball machine.

[22:31] It could be.

[22:32] Because right now when you play Guns N' Roses, the overwhelming feedback I get is this.

[22:35] If you just stop caring about scoring and you just enjoy it as a concert going music

[22:41] pin, you'll have a great time.

[22:43] But if you're someone who wants to follow like how to get to high scores, then you're

[22:47] going to be disappointed because it's not that balanced and you end up playing the game

[22:53] the same way every time.

[22:55] And that's not good, right?

[22:56] A game with 22 songs in it should have so many different ways to get to high scores.

[23:02] And it seems like that's not the case.

[23:05] It's also just this feeling of I got to chop wood before I start the song, but that's not

[23:09] why I want to own the machine.

[23:11] People don't want to chop wood before they have to start the song.

[23:15] All right.

[23:16] The next question I have for Jersey Jack is, are we going to see the replacement playfields

[23:19] for Guns N' Roses?

[23:21] Still no word on it.

[23:22] Thank you for starting a thread, some of you.

[23:24] And nobody seems to care now.

[23:25] I don't understand this community.

[23:27] So many of you out there have guns and roses machines with playfield issues and they told

[23:32] you they were going to get you replacement playfields in the summer of 2022 and no one's

[23:37] even speaking up.

[23:38] Nobody wants to utter a single word.

[23:40] Why is that?

[23:41] Why am I the only one trying to keep these companies accountable for the very things they

[23:45] said they were going to do?

[23:47] I didn't make them say that they did.

[23:49] Such a weird hobby.

[23:50] It's such a weird hobby.

[23:52] These companies can just say anything.

[23:54] All right.

[23:55] Well, that's really it.

[23:56] I mean, there's not much else happening in Pinball.

[23:58] We are all waiting for Stern Pinball to save us.

[24:01] It's like save us from the boredom, Stern.

[24:04] Give us your new game to chew on.

[24:07] We want something new.

[24:09] Toy Story, it's over.

[24:11] They're not going to get that demand back.

[24:13] It's going to sell all right.

[24:14] Don't get me wrong.

[24:15] Toy Story is going to sell all right.

[24:17] Here's how Toy Story is going to sell all right.

[24:19] A lot of NeoFights and a lot of new to the hobby people are going to go into distributors

[24:24] and have no idea.

[24:26] They're going to have no idea that the game is overpriced.

[24:29] They're going to have no idea it doesn't have many toys in it.

[24:32] They're just going to see Toy Story and they're probably going to want one because it's still

[24:36] a sexy machine when you put it next to other games that are available.

[24:40] You know, it's not going to win over the pin side community.

[24:43] And that's the thing.

[24:44] They've lost the people who know this industry because if you know this industry, you know

[24:48] the game is empty.

[24:49] You know it's not the theme you want it.

[24:51] You know the game is overpriced and you add those three things up and it's real easy.

[24:56] I'll just wait because if you wait, you're going to save thousands of dollars.

[25:00] Now CEO owners still don't know when the game is going on the line.

[25:03] My friend told me his distributor said in two weeks they are going to start making the

[25:07] collector's edition.

[25:08] So look, here's what I think is going to happen.

[25:10] I think once the CE start rolling off the line, there's going to be more demand for

[25:15] them because you can have the game.

[25:16] Now look, I sold mine for $14,000.

[25:19] I still think the CE's are going to slide in value to like $12,000 or maybe lower.

[25:24] There's just too many of them.

[25:25] I also don't think Jersey Jack makes all $1,000.

[25:28] There is no way that a thousand people are committed to buying this game at $15,000,

[25:34] but we'll never know that they don't make $1,000.

[25:36] They're always going to keep that a secret and that's also going to cause the price to

[25:40] go down and down and down because it's just too many because making a thousand at $15,000,

[25:45] it's just too many.

[25:46] The market doesn't want to pay that, not for what's in this game.

[25:50] So I think it's going to be a pretty rough fall for JJP.

[25:53] I think they know it.

[25:54] I think they know they have more exciting games coming.

[25:57] I think they know over at JJP that Pat Lawler was this old Cremugian.

[26:02] He kind of took over the company.

[26:04] He forced Jack out of his own company.

[26:06] All this happened.

[26:07] He didn't deliver what they thought he would over the years he was there.

[26:10] He was there for like 10 years and he gave them three games that are all going to have

[26:14] lukewarm and meaty ochre receptions and sales.

[26:18] They just are.

[26:19] I think Lawler just didn't have new ideas.

[26:22] If you look at this game, all of these ideas are recycled from no good gopher's.

[26:26] So that's the thing.

[26:27] It's like, I think Pat Lawler, I'm just going to say this.

[26:30] I think he's another one of these designers who was made to look amazing because he had

[26:36] the Bally Williams engineers making all of the incredible toys that made his games incredible.

[26:43] And then you remove those engineers from Pat Lawler's team and look at what you get.

[26:50] Every single idea in both dialed in Willy Wonka and in Toy Story.

[26:55] These are just old leftover ideas from Pat Lawler.

[26:59] I want you to point to any of his games and tell me some toy or mechanical thing he engineered

[27:05] in any of his three JJP games that felt original, felt like you never saw it before and felt

[27:12] like it had the wow factor like the toys in Adam's family and in Twilight Zone.

[27:17] I challenge you to do it.

[27:18] None of his games have stuff in it that are as cool as no good gopher's.

[27:22] I think the greatest mechanical engineer over at Jersey Jack Pinball is Eric Minier and

[27:27] he's not going to help Pat Lawler out.

[27:29] He's not going to save him out.

[27:30] These guys weren't getting along collaborating like one big family.

[27:33] That's not the case.

[27:34] And you could just ask people who used to work with both of them.

[27:37] So I think the future of JJP is far more exciting than this game.

[27:41] And I think everybody realizes that.

[27:43] Nobody wants to see JJP stutter.

[27:46] Nobody wants to see Jersey Jack Pinball fail.

[27:48] I mean Jersey Jack Pinball was the great hope of Pinball.

[27:51] They were going to bring the Balli Williams packed games back to Pinball when Stern was

[27:55] giving us baron games.

[27:57] Now it's like weird, right?

[27:59] It's like Stern is giving us Godzilla.

[28:01] That's amazing.

[28:02] And Jersey Jack Pinball is stripping stuff out of their games.

[28:05] I mean they're heading in different directions.

[28:08] If Stern Pinball keeps going this way, it's going to be game over for everybody.

[28:12] And that's a good thing for us because if Stern Pinball just starts clobbering everybody,

[28:17] it means the only way you can compete with Stern is if you make games that are as good

[28:22] as theirs.

[28:23] And that's why competition is so important in every industry.

[28:28] Everybody thank you for your support.
