[00:00] I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need.

[00:07] Don't care about love, there's a lot of need for Christmas.

[00:13] Alright, welcome to episode 188 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:26] I'm your host, Canada, this is like a double feature upload day for me.

[00:31] I just uploaded the interview with the Black Knight and his girlfriend.

[00:35] And now I want to do a smaller little snackable podcast for you guys to talk about.

[00:40] Some of the pinball news that's been going on this week.

[00:43] Alright, but before we do that, you guys need to close your computers.

[00:47] Now, actually, keep them open, go to this week in pinball and vote for Canada's Pinball Podcast

[00:54] as the greatest pinball podcast on the planet.

[00:58] Alright, if we win, what should I do if we win?

[01:01] If we win, I will pay to fly Hilton.

[01:06] Wow, I can't believe I'm going to say this.

[01:08] I'll buy him a first class ticket to TPS.

[01:11] Let the man experience how the other half live, maybe even just for a couple hours.

[01:16] It might change his perspective on life.

[01:19] So you heard it here first, Hilton, first class, if Canada wins, best,

[01:24] Twippy award podcast.

[01:27] Alright, let's talk about what's going on in pinball.

[01:30] So there's not too much news, right?

[01:32] We are right upon the holidays.

[01:34] And this is an interesting time of year to be in pinball and to be trying to sell a pinball machine.

[01:40] So for some reason, I can't get anyone to bite on a tails of the Arabian Knights

[01:48] that has over $6,000 in additional items put into the game and work done to the game.

[01:56] Right?

[01:57] And I'm asking $9,000.

[01:59] See, what I think is funny about my tails of the Arabian Knights for sale is that people throw money

[02:06] at modern machines that are really built like crap compared to the Bally Williams Hay Day.

[02:14] Just, no, if you put a tails of the Arabian Knights like mine next to any modern machine,

[02:20] it holds its own and then some clearly far superior than anything coming from Stern.

[02:26] Jersey Jacks, so I think are comparable to the Bally Williams games, but I love it.

[02:30] I love that people are like, you're overpriced at $9,000.

[02:34] Alright, well here's the deal.

[02:36] I'm not going below $9,000.

[02:38] There's no way.

[02:40] I had a guy who asked me if I would pay for shipping and then he'd buy it.

[02:45] You got to love the Pimball Collector.

[02:47] They all have one trait.

[02:50] They all have to feel like they are getting a deal.

[02:54] Like they're about to spend $9,000 and if they just get $2,000 to $300 off, then they'll buy it.

[03:03] But without that, oh no, no.

[03:06] They stall, they waver, they go back and forth, they waffle, such BS.

[03:12] I love it.

[03:13] It's like, oh here's a $10,000 item.

[03:15] I'm not sure.

[03:16] I'll throw in some balls.

[03:17] How about it?

[03:18] Okay, deal.

[03:19] Like they have to feel like they're getting something.

[03:22] So I also think it's just a weird time of year to buy, right?

[03:25] I think the holidays, people are spending money.

[03:27] Some people get holiday bonuses.

[03:29] Some people don't.

[03:30] Probably most people have purchased their Pimball machines.

[03:34] I'll for the year that they want and they're just probably going to wait.

[03:38] So we'll see.

[03:39] It's at 9K.

[03:40] If you want the tails, hit me up.

[03:42] I'll even throw in some free Pimballs for you.

[03:45] Let's call it a deal.

[03:46] All right, what's going on in Pimball?

[03:48] So two big news items are coming from Stern and from Chicago Gaming.

[03:54] And I want to talk about those two on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[03:58] Let's start with Stern.

[04:01] So how do you think Guardians of the Galaxy is selling?

[04:05] Like do you think this game is flying off the shelves?

[04:09] Do you think orders are going out to distributors?

[04:12] I have been sort of saying or the past couple weeks.

[04:15] I think it's going to be hard for Stern to get momentum and hype back for this game.

[04:21] I think it had probably one of the strangest sort of haphazard launches

[04:28] in recent Stern memory.

[04:31] And the reason why is we all have reached the point now where we're just absolutely fed up

[04:36] with getting games that aren't complete or even near complete and seeing something

[04:40] for the first time half-bake, it doesn't work anymore.

[04:43] It just doesn't work.

[04:45] I don't know what Stern is thinking when they do this.

[04:49] And it's not that it's, see, here's a difference between Stern and Jersey Jack.

[04:52] Jack might show you Pirate of the Caribbean in complete, which I also don't always think

[04:57] is the smartest thing.

[04:59] But Jack's not shipping that game to customers three weeks later.

[05:03] Stern would ship that game to you three weeks later if they, you know,

[05:08] because they would keep the line going.

[05:10] And that's the problem is why do they do that?

[05:15] Why do they expect people to open up a box with an incomplete game in it

[05:20] and expect people to be patient and to wait?

[05:23] I think Batman was a painful year for people, painful, painful year.

[05:29] And people are not as patient with Guardians of the Galaxy.

[05:33] Now, the big news that they announced is there are two new songs that are being included into the game.

[05:39] You got the Jackson's Five.

[05:41] The Jackson Five, like, was it give me one more chance?

[05:45] You know what? I need to, like, let me pull up the actual announcement because it's the Jackson Five song

[05:51] and it's also the, the U Child things are going to get easier.

[05:56] Was it Marvin Gaye's song?

[05:57] So let me just, I'm going to Stern Pimball on Facebook.

[06:00] I wanted to make sure I get this right because I should have done show notes.

[06:05] But as you know, we don't always do show notes on this show.

[06:08] So Stern's Pimball page is slow to load.

[06:11] Come on.

[06:12] All right. Here we go.

[06:13] Here we go.

[06:14] So new songs.

[06:16] I want you back to Jackson Five, 1969 song, an Aint No Mountain High enough by Marvin Gaye and Tammy Torell, 1967.

[06:25] Okay. So there are people that are talking about whether or not they think this was planned all along from Stern

[06:36] or if this is in response to the feedback and potentially to the lack of sales of this game.

[06:44] And none of us will know for sure.

[06:47] Okay. So all of what you're about to hear is pure speculation.

[06:50] On my part, these are my opinions about all of this.

[06:55] So I think that the negotiations to get these songs into the machine occurred after the reveal.

[07:04] I do not think Stern was planning from the very beginning.

[07:08] Right. And what I mean by that is I don't think when this game was being developed that they had the songs in mind.

[07:18] I'll tell you why.

[07:19] I'll tell you why.

[07:20] It doesn't take that long to anchor licensing deal to get this music.

[07:26] And how long does it take to develop a pinball machine?

[07:29] It takes a bit.

[07:30] I mean, these games are in development for like a year at least, aren't they?

[07:34] Doesn't code take at least a few months before even need to get to like 0.50 or 0.60, right?

[07:43] So all of that time when you're coding a machine and you're making a game,

[07:49] you're going to want to have the music.

[07:52] And you're going to want to know what musical assets you have as you start to code the game, make the modes.

[07:58] It is absolutely a name to think that Stern had this planned all along.

[08:05] Okay. This game, I think more than any other game, maybe Batman is somewhat similar.

[08:11] They are building the ship in the ocean.

[08:15] You don't build the ship in the ocean.

[08:19] And it's just this process of trying to sort of bolt things on to the game

[08:26] and bring it, you know, sort of build it when it's already out.

[08:31] It's already available.

[08:33] People are already on board the ship and they're still constructing it in people.

[08:38] And it's just this is it's reaching a point now where I think people are just fed up.

[08:44] Okay. I don't think this was planned.

[08:47] I saw someone said like everyone in Stern's marketing department should be fired.

[08:51] I don't know about fired, but I really do think that Stern is being taught a lesson.

[08:56] I have to imagine that out of the 600 limited editions for Guardians of the Galaxy,

[09:03] that not most of those are sold.

[09:07] And I think Stern is realizing that their marketing and the anticipated hype and demand for this game just is not there.

[09:16] And it takes more than just beautiful artwork and a theme like Guardians to move pinball machines

[09:24] because the competition is tough because the theme doesn't hit people over the head as hard as some of the nostalgic themes.

[09:31] And I also think that like people are just absolutely tired with this.

[09:36] So yes, I do think that these songs were negotiated very recently and I think it's due to a lack of sales.

[09:42] That is my speculation.

[09:45] I do not think this was planned from the beginning and I hope that these songs are coded into modes

[09:53] and don't just play on a random loop the way the first two songs have been playing in the game itself.

[09:59] You know what I love about Batman is when you start a villain,

[10:02] each villain comes with its unique sort of soundtrack that's really awesome and it changes the dynamic and the feel of the game when that happens.

[10:10] And I think the same needs to be true for Guardians that these songs need to be incorporated properly and coded properly,

[10:17] which means that when you enter a mode, the song doesn't just start from the beginning and loop.

[10:24] You should be able to use different elements of the song and the song can come on at different points in the song to reflect what's going on in the machine and with the gameplay.

[10:36] And I hope they do that and don't just lazily have like a background soundtrack going because as Ted said,

[10:43] well then you might as well just get a boom box and put the soundtrack from the movie on while you're playing the pinball machine and it's the same thing.

[10:50] That's not how music should be incorporated into pinball.

[10:54] But again, this whole thing is like how can you go in and buy a Guardians now knowing that the game is still just kind of being figured out,

[11:03] you might as well wait and we all know the only reason to run and buy now is if you have a fear of missing out on a limited edition and they are not going to sell out,

[11:14] they are not going to sell out.

[11:16] And that was to me a huge marketing mistake by Stern because when it comes to limited editions, you want to make one less than there is demand, one less.

[11:27] Okay, that is the key in all marketing. I want to make one less than there are potential buyers.

[11:34] In some games they made a lot less. There's way more people out there that want than 240 who want a Batman LE, way more than 400 people who wanted a Ghostbusters LE before we all realized the game wasn't very good.

[11:47] But the demand was there. 800 Star Wars. I don't know, right? I don't know. I think that was too many.

[11:54] There's also a point where nothing feels limited. So Guardians of the Galaxy, I do. I still think it's going to go down as a problem title for Stern.

[12:06] And when I look at what games are coming out for Stern and Sharon, I'll talk about this in my sort of year prediction episode that's going to come out.

[12:15] I think it's going to be an interesting year for Stern because they have games coming out but none of them are blockbuster titles.

[12:25] The way Batman was, Ghostbusters and Star Wars. So if you look at those are juggernaut.

[12:32] Joggernaut. Decade spanning. Generations spanning themes. Ghostbusters, Star Wars and Batman.

[12:42] Okay. Versus Guardians of the Galaxy. Potentially Deadpool. We're hearing monsters. We're hearing Iron Maiden. We're hearing like a pow game.

[12:54] I don't know what the next, I don't know what the, you know, I don't know, you know, those don't stack up theme wise anywhere near what Stern had prior.

[13:04] So it's going to be, I don't know, I think, I think 2018 is going to be an interesting time for Stern. I think if they were smart, I think with the message and the writing on the wall is very clear.

[13:15] Stop launching games so early. Get these machines fully baked before you sell them to customers. Okay.

[13:25] And the problem with like two with games like Guardians and, you know, any game right now that's not being coded by Lyman Sheets just doesn't have the faith that it's going to be like this amazing game anymore.

[13:41] I think, you know, you've got the other coders out there, you know, you got Lonnie, you know, it's more simple sort of repetitive code.

[13:53] And you got Dwight that's like playing chess like way too complex. I mean, Lyman, just, he's their best by far.

[14:01] But he works really slow. It takes him like two years to complete a game. But I think people would be happier with two to three amazing Stern games that are complete a year versus four to five incomplete things that take years to complete.

[14:19] And I think we all agree. I'm going to move on. I think Guardians is never going to get buyers lined up for a long time. And I think I don't, I just, I just don't. And I think it's, I think people are sending Stern the message that I need to hear.

[14:33] Alright, the other news that happened this week, the big news. And this is something as again, as a marketer. I look at this stuff and I'm like, huh, why'd you go do that?

[14:45] Why did Chicago gaming? Why did Rick basically put out an announcement saying enough with all the speculation, the rumors are true. We are remaking games. And we are going to remake monster bash cactus canyon, big bang bar and theater of metal.

[15:02] And theater of magic and another one. We're not going to tell you what that other one was. Now that was a strategic move on his part. And he did that for a reason. He did it so that everybody would chime in and speculate what the other one would be.

[15:18] Or they would tell him what they want it the other one to be. What a great free focus group that Rick has amongst the community to see where the demand is for this stuff. I mean, he knows where the demand is. He's not an idiot. He knows pinball really well. What he's doing is very smart. He's remastering the hits. That's all he's doing. He doesn't have to guess. He doesn't have to put tons of R&D into making the games great. He already knows what people want.

[15:46] And he's giving them what they want in a newer version. And he's improving the things that people would like to see improved in the games. And he's making them sexier with better toppers. And he's giving the better screens. What's not to like? What's not to like? And as much as people will keep saying, well, the originals, the originals will always hold a special place.

[16:06] They will, but they also will decrease in value. And people want a new game. They don't want a game that's 20 years old that could have issues that they have to buy site unseen. They would rather have a brand new product arrived. Nobody would want a used versus a new. It's just the way it is.

[16:26] It's an interesting thing remakes because in other industries and other categories, if you collect toys or you collect arcade games, a remake usually doesn't come anywhere close to fetching the same amount of money as the original.

[16:41] But again, the reason why is when it, like let's say transformers, for example, you're just paying for the fact that that's the exact toy that was on the shelf in the 1986 that you ripped open as a kid. That is why it's valuable.

[16:52] Nobody is like, oh, well, this is the Adam's family that I remember. My parents giving me when I was just a child and I would not accept a remake of this. It is not the real thing.

[17:04] No, none of us feel that way. It's a toy. It's an electro mechanical device. It looks the same. It plays the same. It is the same.

[17:12] So what do I think about Rick doing this though? So here's a thing. If you're an owner of a big bang bar, you are like fuck. Like I wish I sold my game a couple months ago, the way Kim Mitchell did.

[17:28] I mean, Kim Mitchell got out on these titles at the right time and I love reading him and Hilton going back and forth on Pinside about this.

[17:38] Hilton is just like, he's just a work of art. He's like work of art. I love how he like, he accuses Kim Mitchell of knowing these things. We're going to happen selling them at a profit.

[17:50] And then he accuses Kim Mitchell of not having any inside information and he probably just got lucky and it was good timing. Which one is it, Hilton? I'll tell you this.

[18:01] Kim Mitchell smart man, he was doing, he's, Kim Mitchell knows a lot of people in this industry. He's, he's been in this industry longer than Hilton has been in school probably. Right. And it's, it shows it shows.

[18:14] These smart guys, I love watching them run circles around Hilton because he just, he can't figure out that the joke is always on him. So look, this is pinball. Right. We all have inside information.

[18:26] All of us who dig deep enough or ask the right questions of the right people, we know it's going on in the hobby. You don't have to be a genius. All you got to do is buy a few guys a few drinks at any of these shows and they'll spill the beans. I mean, Jersey Jack has already told certain people what his next titles are.

[18:42] Like more like well beyond toy story. How do I know this because they tell me Jack came over. Jack had some drinks. Jack told me. And I'm like, well, what did he say? They're like, I'm not going to tell you.

[18:53] But I'm just saying it's out there. And you know, the circles do get smaller. The more valuable the information is. But you know, sometimes I'm in those small circles on certain games. Sometimes I'm not.

[19:06] But to say all these titles at once. I think sucks. I'll tell you why I think it sucks because great. Now Rick has gone off and basically blown up or made it really great.

[19:22] Made it really hard now for people to sell those titles that he mentioned because and here's the thing. Now they're hard to sell because people are just going to wait for the remakes or see what the remake entails.

[19:35] But it could be years. Who knows. It could be two years for theater or magic. It could be five years. It could be one year for cactus Ken and it could be four years.

[19:43] But now he's basically said it doesn't matter. Years don't even matter. I just I now own the value of these machines. I now I now can stunt sellers ability to move these games. And I now can like decrease the prices all because of one simple post by my company.

[20:07] The power the man wields in terms of the second hand value of all these classic games is incredible. And the part that really hurts me is this list can change. And now there's like this mystery title that is just out there that is now what that is doing.

[20:26] It's fucking over everybody that is trying to sell a game like mine like tails of the Arabian nights because it's like well. Tails could be the next title. It could be Adam's family. It could be Indiana Jones. It could be the twilight zone. Right. It's just it could be anything almost from it could be kingpin. Even though kingpin is going to be made by circus Maximus.

[20:46] But you know, pinball the pinball collecting world now it's it's it's it's it's being rocked rocked back and forth in this weird way where now it's it's it was never a great investment. Now it's really not a good time to be a seller in the pinball hobby.

[21:07] There are certain people who got in at the right time you know maybe like eight years ago 10 years ago people got in on monster bash is around like three thousand four thousand dollars. And those people always feel satisfied.

[21:20] But people were buying some of these games like monster bash and medieval madness and cactus canyon. I mean these games were selling to certain people anywhere from twelve to twenty thousand dollars depending on the condition of the game.

[21:36] Now they're all going to be worth like less than ten grand. It's just it's what's going to happen. And that's a huge bath to take a losing ten thousand dollars on a pinball purchase is a hard pill to swallow.

[21:52] And the tug of war happening in the hobby right now is you have the collector on one side and the pinball player on the other side right the player is just like what I just want more people to be exposed I want to be able to play these games in in new condition and I'm happy this is happening.

[22:09] The collector is like shit like my collection is declining in value it also makes me nervous about I think you got to be nervous just buying a new game.

[22:22] And I think you have to just buy the game you absolutely love because I think you have to be nervous that pins will hold their value as well as they have over the last like five years.

[22:33] I think you have to start realizing there are so many machines for sale there are so many games that everyone is trying to sell for just five hundred to a thousand dollars less than they paid.

[22:46] And then there's so many new machines coming out the over saturation in this market it's incredible right now you know my my friend just listed his spider man for seven thousand dollars and I'm like a spidey for seven grand like really.

[23:01] Really and we'll see right it's it's a hard time everyone thinks they're ACDC's and their metallic is our worth all this money and I just don't see these games staying anywhere near MSRP when they're used and they're five six seven years old there's just no way there's no way there's just too much coming out.

[23:23] So this just creates more that market instability I'm not sure why they did it other than to just basically make a power play I mean God bless Rick and co like these guys own they own the classics they own the classics and they are going to profit nicely on those classics.

[23:46] And you know look as someone who doesn't own any of those old machines and it's not doesn't stand to lose any money on them I I'm very very sort of I'm happy as a potential buyer of these games I just think a lot of people out there are going to be you know a little sad that they're valuable collectible is now going to be remade and look better and they're probably going to want one like as people have said you put an attack for Mars the new one next to you.

[24:15] The new one next to the old one it's not even funny which one looks better which one like people would rather have okay I know some people disagree and the purest the purest out there will always want the original but the purest the Pimbo purest is like a point 0.01% of the market it they just are all right okay that's my thoughts on that what else is going on and Pimbo is anything else like really going on I saw total nuclear annihilations have been shipping.

[24:45] I'm going to be going to people and I have to say that those butter cabinets have you seen the butter cabinets they are incredible they're shiny they're glossy they're beautiful I really I really think it's it's it's a nice looking package if I was getting that machine I would definitely I would definitely order it with with the butter cabinet I just like shiny things I think a lot of people like shiny things let me go to my email and I said I would read people's emails and I I want to.

[25:15] And I want to read an email I got let's see from Scott so Scott is a drager Scott thank you for listening to the show he writes canada I like your show and listen to most episodes you are clear and articulate so I understand your positions even when I don't agree with them he has a mail bag part for me and I'll read that the position I have the most is the most I can do is I can do it.

[25:45] And I think the most important thing is that I think you're right when you say Pimbo machines are expensive toys for dudes in their 40s and 50s yes diversity is low in the hobby because a lot of machines themselves are sexist.

[26:00] I don't really see a lot of diversity just in terms of ethnicity playing Pimbo I just don't I mean it's very Caucasian driven phenomenon right that's you know and you know and I think too like if you look at the themes of Pimbo I think they're also like very like Caucasian driven themes not to say like you know there's obviously like these big things like Star Wars catch everybody

[26:30] but for example like look at the music music pins like there are no music pins by the way this is me talking this is not Scott this is not Scott's email I took a break there are no musical pins that appeal to other ethnic groups I wish there were I can't believe there's not one rap Pimbo machine out there M&M two-pock biggy bad boy like why why because the target right all right let me keep

[26:59] I'm now I'm going back to Scott's email he writes if you're investing in Pimbo I think you're doing it wrong you are correct with Pimbo ultimately losing to virtual reality or other entertainment technology

[27:13] Hummel figures used to be expensive those people died and nobody wants them the $500 Bini babies of the 90s are worth nothing because the kids grew up

[27:23] Harley's used to be expensive but baby boomers can't easily swing their legs over them past 65 so they're dropping in value Pimbo will be the same it's a wave and we're in it

[27:36] So enjoy the hobby but don't expect the kids to fight over who gets which machine in the well they will think great I have to move this heavy ass thing out of the basement

[27:47] All right, but I always respect your views because you articulate with them well sorry you tell me articulate them well I can't even read

[27:56] Well first of all

[27:58] Scott thank you for that note and I think we talk a lot about investments and Pimbo's and you look I don't think a Pimbo machines a Harley Davis and bike and I think there's a reason why like

[28:08] People age out of Harley's because to your point they can't get on them. It's like my I want my dad to get an exotic car and he's like

[28:16] I can't get in it and he's right he can't

[28:19] Pimbo machine is like probably the one thing that as long as you can move two fingers

[28:25] You can play a Pimbo machine until you're like a hundred years old so it doesn't age people out

[28:31] And I am surprised I think everyone is surprised that a Pimbo machine

[28:38] Can't you know is an obsolete in 2017 that there are more new inbox Pimbo's being made two day

[28:45] Then there ever was in the history of Pimbo in terms of the number of manufacturers

[28:50] Which is incredible?

[28:51] Well, maybe like I don't know like in the 40s and 50s like when they were everywhere

[28:55] But you know what I'm saying? It's it's really interesting that it hasn't died and will virtual reality will that ultimately kill Pimbo and the answer is

[29:05] Yes, the thing is I don't think that happens for a good

[29:11] 10 to 20 years and the reason why is

[29:14] Virtual reality and wearing headsets and wearable technology that won't be the thing for another decade

[29:22] It's got a long way to go, okay, and young kids aren't growing up using that kind of technology and

[29:30] Look Pimbo will survive for the next 20 years. I I I firmly

[29:36] Believe that I think the market will shrink significantly in like five years

[29:41] I and I think in the next couple years we're gonna see half of these manufacturers go out of business

[29:46] But they're still gonna be a market for it

[29:49] Because you just can't replicate it and we we talk about this now in terms of it being an investment again

[29:54] Like I think beanie babies when you think about a beanie baby that is to me a beanie baby is like a baseball card

[30:00] It's it's something to be put on a shelf and there's a difference between things that were arbitrarily

[30:08] Like they arbitrarily became collectibles and the only reason they were collectibles is because it was a flash in the pan moment

[30:16] That was driven by like marketing and hype and and by like rabbit rabbit collectors right who bought beanie babies and but but ultimately

[30:25] People stopped and looked at them and said it's just a stupid little stuffed animal that's on a shelf like you can't play with it

[30:32] It that that whole market only survives if other people out in the world really really want your rare like princess Diana beanie baby

[30:42] And that's the only reason why some of them skyrocketed in value now once all those people

[30:48] Get them and no new collectors are coming into that beanie baby hobby

[30:53] It the whole market collapses and also because people just realize these are just stupid little stuffed animals on shelves that now nobody cares about anymore

[31:03] Pimball is different. It's a toy that you can play you can engage with its interactive

[31:07] It's so much more of a dynamic

[31:10] engaging thing than a stuffed animal and I think because of that and because nothing can replicate the joy of a pimball machine

[31:19] I think that's why pimball sort of exist in a separate economy from other collectibles and you know

[31:27] There's just something about it that makes it really special and I think toy collectors

[31:33] I think baseball card collectors other collectible things, you know watch collecting

[31:37] It's just it's just different. There's kind of nothing quite like it and that is why we love it

[31:45] It's why I love it and I know you guys love it, but yes

[31:48] You you'd be better off if you bought some bitcoins a few years ago than a pimball machine

[31:54] But Scott thank you for the email. I appreciate it. Always nice to have listeners right in I got an email from Cody

[32:01] Keele saying are you alive just making sure you're still alive and missing the podcast

[32:07] Cody I am alive. I know I went like three or four days without a podcast

[32:12] But trust me. I mean I also have work. I have other things going on

[32:18] I'm excited because my car might be ready in in two weeks my dealership said the demon the new demon arrival date is

[32:26] December 30th or like January 5th

[32:28] Which is the worst time of year to get a car where I had a sign a legal contract saying I wouldn't drive it in

[32:35] In temperatures below 40 degrees because the drag radios crack and I have to get the car in January in the Northeast

[32:43] Terrible, but I'm excited so you might not hear for me as much either when the demon arrives because

[32:48] It's just gonna be cooler than pimple. All right Ronald sent me an email telling me how to change the volume in Batman

[32:57] Ronald thank you for that. Thank you. I I sometimes like it's not super easy to

[33:04] To figure out pinball machines and how to adjust things. It's all in there

[33:09] You just have to dig through a mountain of options, but thank you Ronald for that email

[33:14] I got an email from Jeff Patterson Jeff is the man my main man who who is the

[33:23] Creator of this week in pinball and he asked about

[33:26] My magic girl playfield and he was gonna talk about it on this week in pinball. So for those of you

[33:32] I need to put it on as an eBay auction. I did I was meant meaning to do it Sunday night

[33:37] But I didn't but if any of you out there who collect playfields

[33:40] I have a magic girl playfield new old stock for sale and I have the original prototype

[33:46] Translate for sale as well that will be going up. So

[33:51] Jeff

[33:51] Thank you for asking about that and I appreciate that you're gonna highlight it on the next this week in pinball

[33:58] And then ed C also sent me an email about how to adjust the Batman sound so thank you guys

[34:04] I appreciate that not being on pinside is hard for me sometimes to figure out little things

[34:10] People have asked me over the last like week. So how's Batman? Are you tired of it yet?

[34:14] Or do you want to sell it?

[34:16] The answer is no, I am not tired of it

[34:18] But you know if I'm honest if I'm honest every game

[34:23] Every game has like that first week or two where you're like all about it and then you play it a little bit less

[34:30] A little bit less a little bit less. I've been turning it on less

[34:33] But it's all working very nicely. I

[34:37] Ordered for Batman pin stadium lights. I

[34:41] Think Batman needs additional lighting. It is really dark in the middle of the playfield

[34:47] So I ordered the pin stadium lights. I also ordered some

[34:50] Spotlights and I'm gonna see which ones I like more I ordered like those dual spotlights that go on the

[34:57] Comes with a post and you put them by the slings and that might be enough the pin stadium package looks really cool

[35:05] I'm just not sure. I think you have to like take the pin stadium lights on and off every time you lift the playfield

[35:10] Which seems like it could be a bit of a hassle

[35:13] but

[35:14] The they sure do look nice like when you see the before and after of pin stadium lights

[35:19] It's a huge improvement. It's night and day literally no pun intended so I'm excited

[35:25] But here's the thing that they're like the demand for pin stadium lights is so great that it's a month

[35:30] Wait to get there and you would think right you would think with my podcast and my cloud in this hobby that that I would be bumped to the front of the line

[35:38] But no, I'm just an average Joe when it comes to this stuff

[35:43] You know, nobody sponsors this show nobody gives me anything. I get nothing. I get nothing

[35:48] Nothing a thousand pinball people listen to this podcast and I would like to think that there is

[35:55] Influence like I know this. I'm always telling this to Ryan and Marty over at um head-to-head pinball

[36:01] We have influence like people listen to this show and I think we do have some influence over what people will buy

[36:08] Like what how people think about these games?

[36:11] So I am shocked that more manufacturers don't reach out to us as media to talk about their games and to explain their stories like we have to chase them down

[36:22] Uh, and it should go the other way it should go the other way

[36:25] They should be coming to us to tell the stories of their games because I do consider as

[36:31] Pinball journalist or media we are media like this is a medium and we are

[36:37] Objectively for the most part looking at this hobby. Well subjective as well

[36:42] But you know what I'm saying like we're we're like news like we talk about news

[36:46] We're you know we and I would love to interview all the people over at store and about their games

[36:52] But the you know problem is is they don't commit they don't commit they don't they don't really feel like they need to do it

[36:58] I think it helps. I think it helps

[37:00] I think John Borghton the story of how he came to that design

[37:03] I think when Christopher france he talks about the artwork. I think all that stuff helps get people excited because when you buy these things

[37:10] You want to have as much of the story that went into making the game as possible

[37:14] And I think a lot of these companies do a bad job

[37:17] Delivering that story, okay?

[37:20] What else is going on in pinball? What else is going on?

[37:23] Um anything in the J pop world. No, we're not going to hear from deep room for a couple of years

[37:27] Look forward to the next episode where I do my sort of year in review

[37:32] I know I did it with Marty and Ryan, but I'll do a shorter more abbreviated version of what I think is going to happen next year and what happened this year

[37:39] I'll also go down that the Twippy awards

[37:42] Uh this week in pinball has like their annual award show and I'm gonna go down and give what I think are my

[37:48] Picks in each of those categories

[37:51] And I'll tell you right now for best pinball podcast you're listening to it have a great day guys

[38:01] Maybe
