[00:00] Friends with the monster, the son of my bed, get along with the voices inside of my head.

[00:08] You're trying to save me, stop holding up, man.

[00:12] When you think I'm crazy, I think I'm crazy.

[00:20] Alright, the weight is over.

[00:22] Godzilla is here. Stern Pimball, Keith L. Win, zombie Eddie's Godzilla.

[00:26] I'm going to give you my first impressions. I'm not going to hold back.

[00:29] I'm going to tell you how I feel about the launch, how I feel about the game,

[00:34] and all of the different things that went through my head when I saw this machine today.

[00:39] And it's been a long day, and I'm tired, and I've been up since very early,

[00:43] giving you guys Facebook Live for two hours.

[00:46] I've been giving you guys the video. I've been chatting with all of you throughout the day

[00:51] about your opinions on Godzilla and my.

[00:54] Are there many, many opinions about this game?

[00:57] But I want to tell you how I feel.

[00:59] Now, each and every one of us will have a different opinion when we see a Pimball machine for the first time.

[01:04] I want to start out by saying that it is always a very exciting day when we get a new Pimball machine in the world.

[01:11] There are not that many people on the planet who care about these moments,

[01:16] but you do, and I do, and there are thousands of people like us who really value this stuff.

[01:22] I do want to say thank you to the team at Stern that actually made this day happen

[01:26] because these people have been working hard on this game for an entire year,

[01:30] and we get to criticize it or praise it within a few seconds.

[01:34] Think about how traumatic that is.

[01:37] Think about the anxiety associated with that.

[01:40] Keith L. N. and Zombie Eddie and the Stern team have been working on this for a year.

[01:45] They pull the curtain off it, and we get, you know, the typical Stern release video, which are still horrible.

[01:52] I'm going to talk about that.

[01:54] I think Stern needs to do a much better job showing us these games for the first time.

[01:58] Because when we see them, our first impression is forged by these videos that wash all the colors out,

[02:06] and they don't do anything to get you excited.

[02:09] And we also can't go back and forget that Jersey Jack Pimbal gave us the greatest launch ever with Guns and Roses.

[02:18] The Guns and Roses launch video and the excitement around that game and how they drop that game on the world is still.

[02:26] So many levels above what Stern does with their launches.

[02:31] And I think now that Stern is charging us over $10,000.

[02:36] We're going to talk about the price, but a pro is now 67.99.

[02:41] A premium is now what like 88.99 or 89.99.

[02:46] And the LE is a whopping $10,500.

[02:51] Now if you bought it on the Stern shop site with taxes and shipping, a Stern Pimbal machine without a topper, without a new shooter rod,

[03:03] a Stern Pimbal machine is now with tax and shipping $11,557.

[03:12] And the sticker shock matters.

[03:14] I think that a lot of us now that these machines are costing this much.

[03:18] You can't fault people for having higher expectations, not just of the game itself, but how Stern reveals the game to the world.

[03:26] And they're still revealing these games as if these things cost $4,000.

[03:30] And they need to wake up a little bit because the marketing department is letting down the design department.

[03:35] Zombietti and Keith Elwin work so hard on this game they deserve to have it be shown to the world in a much better way than this.

[03:42] But Stern's piss poor marketing aside, there's still that moment when you see a game for the first time.

[03:48] And I want to start there.

[03:50] How did this game make me feel when I saw it for the first time?

[03:54] Did it blow me away? Did it knock me back? Did it blow my socks off that I don't wear?

[03:59] I want to say that when I saw this for the first time, the first thing that went through my head was wow, this game is pretty packed.

[04:06] Like there's a lot of mechs in this game.

[04:09] There is more going on in this game than almost two or three Stern machines combined.

[04:14] I was really happy to see a lot of mechanical stuff happening in Godzilla and all of the things that I rumored to be in this game are in the game.

[04:23] The multi level building, the bridge that collapses, all the fun wire forms, the rotating target, the single pop bumper, the three flippers, this game has a lot to shoot.

[04:35] It's got a lot going on. And that was the other thing I saw all the mechs and I got excited.

[04:40] The first thing I said was this thing looks like a blast to flip.

[04:44] And then obviously the next thing is the artwork and I was like wow, this game is very, very colorful.

[04:49] And I knew right away, I knew right away when I saw the artwork, I knew that this would be the topic of conversation.

[04:56] Like nobody debates whether or not Ellen Games shoot good.

[05:00] Nobody really cares if there's that many mechs in Stern machines because you've been buying Stern machines every single year without many mechs in it.

[05:09] It's like we're not even used to judging Stern mechs because we never get that many wow mechs from a Stern machine.

[05:15] And because we're not seeing any gameplay, we then go to the artwork.

[05:20] Now what do I think about zombie Yeti's artwork in Godzilla on these three different models?

[05:26] I'm looking at the Ellie right now and I'm looking over it.

[05:29] My thoughts right now are the same they were when I first saw this thing. Wow, that's colorful.

[05:35] It is a very, very colorful interpretation of Godzilla.

[05:39] Now I knew that this would drive some people crazy because if you love classic Godzilla and you love the look and feel of classic Godzilla, it's a lot darker.

[05:49] There's a lot more gray like Godzilla himself is a major topic of conversation because in the movies themselves, Godzilla is more of a charcoal gray.

[06:00] Now on some of the original movie posters, he's green.

[06:04] Now here, he's very bright green.

[06:07] I heard some people say that Godzilla looks like a watermelon or a cucumber.

[06:11] I started laughing out loud because I can see it. I can see it. I can see why people would say he looks a little smooth and vegetable-like.

[06:19] And then I look at the scope of Godzilla in the upper left and once again, you know, here we go with a sculpt that does nothing that just sits there.

[06:28] And I started to realize that this is what's going to happen.

[06:32] People are going to start to nitpick and people are going to start to complain.

[06:36] And I also said to myself, this thing is going to sell out and it's going to sell out in day one.

[06:42] It is sold out. Now there might be distributors that have them but the ones that have them for sale I'm hearing are charging more than the $10,500.

[06:52] But what everyone needs to realize is this is a stern machine.

[06:56] This is not a Jersey Jack machine. This is not a Chicago gaming company machine.

[07:01] This is a stern machine. And every stern machine, every time we get super excited and super hyped for a stern machine, for the most part,

[07:11] for the most part, stern machines never fully blow you away on day one.

[07:17] They never fully do. But I think when I look at this game and I see everything in it and I see how colorful it is

[07:25] and I see how fun it looks and I see all the cool stuff they packed into this pinball machine.

[07:30] I don't know how you walk away from Godzilla, not excited.

[07:36] I really don't. I really don't. I like what Zombie Eddie did with this art package.

[07:41] I understand that people are going to say it looks too much like Avengers and Ninja Turtles and that's not Godzilla.

[07:47] I also think people are wrong when they say that's not Godzilla.

[07:51] This was never going to be a Christopher Franci like game in which he took assets or artwork from the original Godzilla universe and enhanced them and made them look really sexy.

[08:02] Like monsters looks amazing. I think some people thought it was going to be that more like throwback using the original Godzilla artwork.

[08:09] Zombie Eddie likes to take on challenges where he creates his version of something and he has definitely done that with this Godzilla.

[08:17] Now I also think when you see this game in person it's going to look stunning and I know I know that sounds like a cop out right.

[08:24] Well you have to see it in person like shouldn't it be stunning by just looking at pictures but there's so much going on here.

[08:30] There's so much going on from an artistic standpoint and so much going on from a mechanical standpoint.

[08:35] I do think it's a lot to take in and that was another thing that I felt right when you look at this game when you look at this game you could say to yourself it's pretty busy.

[08:45] Like is it almost a little too busy? Did they try to overdo it? Did they over bake it? Did they put too much into this machine and it almost becomes difficult to appreciate it all.

[08:56] And I will say there's some validity to that. I think when you're making a pinball machine and you're designing the layout and the artwork and you're thinking about what to put where.

[09:05] There has to be a point where you say we can't do too much we can't make it too confusing on the eye.

[09:12] If we overload it with stuff it almost detracts from what we're going for but there is no confusing when you walk up to this pinball machine that this is a Godzilla pinball machine and almost every single thing you would want from the Godzilla universe is reflected in this game.

[09:28] So personally I like the art package I wish it was a little bit simpler I think there's a lot going on I don't think it's yet his best.

[09:38] I would still put Ghostbusters above this I think there's just something about the cohesiveness and the simplicity to the layout of the Ghostbusters game that works so damn well.

[09:50] It's almost like Ghostbusters when you look at it it still has a lot of hints of magic girl in it it does the way the smoke is the way the game looks it looks so beautiful.

[10:00] And I think Godzilla is just a lot busier and it's harder to absorb it all and I think that's what's detracting away from some people's ability to enjoy it.

[10:10] Now I haven't stood over the machine and I do feel like when you stand over this machine it is going to look very very cool and very very fun.

[10:20] What about the cabinet artwork it looks cool the pro and premium what's interesting is that each side is the same so you're not getting a different image on the Ellie you are going to get a different image on each side and the Ellie is got meca Godzilla versus Godzilla and the Ellie looks great but and there's a butt here.

[10:39] I'm not sold on this armor there's something about this silver armor that just doesn't translate well through the pictures and you've got this colorful colorful game and then you've got the most dull color on the planet imaginable as the armor.

[10:56] Gray is really dull and I know it's supposed to reflect like meca Godzilla but look at the meca Godzilla in the image look at the meca Godzilla in the artwork and his armor and his metal is much darker and I think this game would look so much better if the armor color was the same color as the meca Godzilla in the artwork now I know what they did they made this armor the same color as the meca Godzilla toy.

[11:25] But I think that's where I think it's throwing everybody off is aesthetically and I mean aesthetically it just doesn't connect with the artwork it's overlapping and so I think I think when people look at the Ellie that's what's jumping out because when we see the Ellie the major difference in the Ellie other than the artwork is always the armor and so we really want that armor to compliment the art package more than reflects something on the play field.

[11:54] It's the reason why the slimer all green package looks so good normally when I see an Ellie I want to look at it and say there is nothing I would change there is nothing I would make different but I don't know about this armor selection when I saw the purple armor on guns and roses collectors addition it was perfect when I saw the sparkled black on Batman 66 it was perfect this just doesn't connect as much as I'd like it to I think it would be better than I thought it would be.

[12:24] Better if it were darker what I like about Godzilla and what I appreciate about this game is they're trying new things that's why people love Keith L and that's what we need more of in pinball like the magnet grab have you seen this thing this new

[12:39] Tim ball that's capable of catching the pinball and sending it in five different directions and sending it back to the left flipper that thing is super freaking cool it's got this motorized collapsing skyscraper

[12:51] bash toy okay you want a bash toy it has it it diverts the ball it also works as a diverter it lifts the ball up it locks the ball on top of the roof building this is what we want in

[13:04] pinball we want next that interact with the ball that are super fun and I absolutely love this world under class I mean I'm looking at the photo right now of Godzilla standing behind the bridge this tall building that lifts up this

[13:19] mecha Godzilla I mean stern normally they normally would have stopped at just the mecha Godzilla mecha I mean think about it this is more just the mecha Godzilla mecha

[13:29] mecha alone that's more than you got in all of Led Zeppelin Ellie and that's not even the major mech in this game there are three major mechs in this game that are all

[13:39] super freaking cool and there's stuff on top of that so how can you be disappointed by what they packed into this game now this definitely looks

[13:48] like a world under glass and if we're going to say we want to see a world under glass and we want to celebrate pinball

[13:53] companies that give us a world under glass I think you have to look at Godzilla and say that's a really cool world under glass there's one big

[14:01] miscreative opportunity for me that I just can't believe they didn't incorporate into the game whenever you integrate a

[14:07] theme in the pinball I always think you should take the theme and you should ask yourself what's the main thing that this

[14:13] theme is known for and if it's a game like Godzilla I think you would ask yourself what's the main thing Godzilla is known for

[14:20] besides stomping on things and knocking down buildings which they have in this he is famous he's famous for his like gamma ray shooting like

[14:29] fire breath beam whatever you call the thing that's what he's famous for this screen and then he lights you up with that like

[14:36] gamma ray beam now he is standing right behind this bridge in this game and you're telling me that stern pinball couldn't

[14:45] put in LED or something inside his mouth that opened up and actually destroyed the bridge like why isn't that in this game that would have been such a

[14:55] great pinball moment to have Godzilla roar and this blue beam comes out of his mouth and destroys the bridge you see what I'm saying we need to get Joe a

[15:04] body on this because he's fixing Mandalorian but once again we have a static figure in the upper left corner of a stern pinball

[15:13] that does nothing stern listen to me right now you need to stop putting static dolls in your games that do nothing it's becoming embarrassing we are now two for two in which the two

[15:26] most popular characters in the two recent games Grogu and Godzilla are both there in the upper left and they're doing nothing what is

[15:34] this some like penalty box turn where you put the main characters up there you're not allowed to move you're not allowed to do

[15:39] anything you can interact with the ball you're just supposed to sit there and draw people into the game very lazy stuff I'm looking at the 3D sculpt of

[15:47] Godzilla right now and that is a real weak part of this game that just doesn't really look like Godzilla where the big scales on his back they

[15:56] look so understated and that was the other part to about the main Godzilla image on the lower part of the play field it's like a

[16:03] weird angle of Godzilla you can't see the big spikes on his back which is so famous for that's why I think you know I could see people saying like the Godzilla I know in love isn't

[16:13] jumping out at me right now here's my takeaway I think this game looks great I think it's a great effort from stern pinball is it the

[16:22] greatest stern pinball machine in the last five years I don't think so I just think there's a lot going on in this game and I think

[16:28] because of that it's not as easy to see something as simple as the Elvira house or the T-Rex I'm trying to think of other

[16:37] mechs that really wowed us there's just not that singular thing to focus on and get excited about there's just a lot going on

[16:45] and I think sometimes when there's a lot going on it's harder it is it's harder to sort of get excited about it all

[16:51] because you haven't seen how it all works together the other thing we haven't seen anything of is how they've integrated the

[16:58] Godzilla movies into this pinball machine there are clips from ten movies in this game all right there's like the blue oyster

[17:06] cult song in this game we've seen nothing of gameplay so I heard when you see the video of how this game works with it all

[17:14] going together you're absolutely going to be blown away the other thing I reacted to today and I think this has a

[17:20] lot to do with everyone's first impressions of these stern machines is the price increase right it's now really

[17:27] expensive to buy these stern machines we're talking 68 99 for a pro 89 99 for premium and 10,500 or 499 for an

[17:38] Ellie machine now if you bought this machine on Stern's website on the Stern shop with taxes and shipping a Stern

[17:45] Ellie without a topper without any shooter rods or any additional accessories is 11,557 dollars almost 12,000 dollars

[17:59] and that's the problem lately with these stern machines the prices are now insane Stern pinball for 10,500

[18:09] dollars charges you for a game that only has 13 RGB controlled LEDs let me repeat that you get 13 fully controlled RGB LEDs 13

[18:22] this game is more money it is more money or the exact same price as guns and roses limited edition guess how many

[18:30] fully controlled RGB LEDs there are in guns and roses 350 plus fully controlled RGB LEDs if you put a gun and roses

[18:42] Ellie next to this game it's still a joke people there is still no way that this game should be the same price as a

[18:49] gun and roses machine I don't care what you say about the play field quality stop that when you look at what JJP is putting into their games it justifies the price

[19:00] when you look at what Stern is putting into their machines it doesn't justify the price the stuff is still not fully sculpt it there's still a lot of

[19:09] plastic there's not a lot of lights in the game there's not nearly the level of craftsmanship in a Stern machine as a

[19:16] Jersey Jack machine and now they cost the exact same price 1000 Ellie's of Godzilla 1000 to they raise the price and they raise the

[19:28] number of games they're going to make which cuts the special nature of the Ellie in half because you've got twice as many now

[19:35] that was my final feeling of the day is when you walk away and you just dropped 11 plus thousand dollars on a Stern

[19:44] Ellie it just doesn't make you feel great and that's how I felt that's how I felt seeing the price of this game is I just

[19:52] wouldn't feel great spending this much money and getting this and I understand the second hand market and people are

[19:59] paying bonkers prices for things but as I've said before that money is not going into the game this stuff just does not

[20:07] look like stuff that's worth more than 10,000 dollars I'm sorry and that's how I feel and it's nothing against

[20:13] Zombie Eddie and Keith L. Wynn they didn't set the price now there was clearly more bomb put into this game than

[20:20] Led Zeppelin absolutely more was put into it but I still for this much money for these games costing this

[20:27] much money we're at the point now we're two Stern Ellie's are going to cost 24,000 dollars you have to make 50

[20:34] grand before taxes that by two Stern Ellie machines we can't look at these machines anymore the way we used to

[20:42] it's just there's no way around it there's these things are now so much money and I have to compare them to the other

[20:48] games in the marketplace and what those games give me for that much money but none of this really matters

[20:55] that's just my feelings on it but none of it matters because the game is sold out there are way more people that want these

[21:01] games and because Stern Pimball will make all these Ellie's before Christmas I think it doesn't matter because they're

[21:08] going to be able to get you the product and everybody who wants a new and box Pimball machine is addicted to getting a new

[21:14] and box Pimball machine and only Stern Pimball will deliver you a game in a timely manner but the Pimball world

[21:20] and I'm going to be completely honest and this is going to go away from just my first impressions of Godzilla is I'm just a little bit tired

[21:27] I'm tired that we are now at a point in Pimball where if I want the best from Stern it's almost 12,000 dollars

[21:34] if I want the best from Jersey Jack Pimball you know if I don't get it on day one it's going to be 15 or 20,000 dollars

[21:40] I'm tired that a fully featured spooky game is $10,000 this hobby has become so expensive

[21:47] that our expectations should be super high and I just don't believe deep down inside in

[21:54] Canada's gut that these games are delivering at these price points I don't I don't see the craftsmanship

[22:01] and I don't see the detail going into these games once we start getting $10,000 and above I don't

[22:08] and I know the reason why the games are this way and I know the community has created this frenzy

[22:13] that's how I feel I just feel like a little bit burnt out I just feel like for this much money I do want to be blown away

[22:20] I don't want to nitpick anything I don't want there to be anything to complain about

[22:25] and when I see these games and I do see a lot of things that maybe could have been different or people want to be different

[22:31] when a game starts to become divisive like then I walk away feeling like well maybe they didn't nail it

[22:37] like nobody really walked away from Big Lebowski saying I would have changed this and that nobody said that

[22:43] nobody walked away from guns and roses saying I would have done this and that differently nobody said that

[22:48] so I would say that this game because a lot of people are walking away saying I would have changed this I would have like this differently

[22:54] I would say that this game still has some work to do to win people over

[22:58] I don't think this is a day one oh my god yes it's absolutely you know the second coming of pinball and you did it

[23:04] no it didn't hit like that it didn't it's definitely an awesome game from Stern it's definitely a super fun colorful game from Stern

[23:11] pinball is it the game that's going to change everything I don't think so is it going to be amazing to play we don't know yet

[23:18] but I assume it's going to be because Ellen knows how to make games that play well so that's my take I'm totally exhausted

[23:25] and here's the thing I might change my mind on all of this tomorrow and this is what we do with first impressions

[23:31] we are going to go through mental roller coaster ride on whether or not we love this game or hate this game

[23:36] we think it's beautiful we think the art sucks we think the shots are great we think the shots are horrible we think these

[23:41] mix are cheap we think these mix are amazing you know that you're feeling that everyone goes through that at the end of the day

[23:47] everyone will be sold out getting an elite will not be easy and this has been can you just pinball podcast

[23:53] episode 614 first impressions of Godzilla have a good night

[23:56] you think I'm crazy well that's nothing

[24:03] well that's nothing
