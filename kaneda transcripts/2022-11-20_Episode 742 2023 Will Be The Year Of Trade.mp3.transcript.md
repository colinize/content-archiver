[09:28] was another weird photograph though.

[09:30] You know me, I always make fun of these photographs

[09:32] that are supposed to give us confidence

[09:35] that all of this progress is happening at these companies.

[09:38] Did you see the photograph?

[09:39] Why can't we get more of an action shot

[09:42] of all of these games on the line and the people over there?

[09:46] I would just love to see behind the curtain.

[09:48] So it actually feels like they're making like 20, 30 a week.

[09:52] I don't know how many a week they are making,

[09:55] but I do know they sold out of all 1,250 of them.

[09:59] And so look, if you're in on one, this is good news.

[10:02] You've waited a year.

[10:03] This is now turning out to be the best bang for the buck

[10:07] in pinball because think about it,

[10:08] you're getting this game and it's got more toys in it.

[10:11] I mean this, this game has more toys in it

[10:14] than James Bond and Toy Story combined.

[10:18] It's got great shots.

[10:19] It's super fun.

[10:20] It's a fan layout, Balli Williams game.

[10:22] You're gonna get this upgraded Lyman sheets code

[10:25] and you might even get working saloon doors

[10:28] that they give you as an upgrade to each machine

[10:30] that they sell.

[10:31] You also get what I would argue is one of the most

[10:34] impressive toppers in pinball history,

[10:37] free of charge with your LE.

[10:40] That's right, for $9,700, you get a topper

[10:43] that is way more intricate and way more interesting

[10:46] than the Mandalorian topper.

[10:48] So look, if Stern made the topper,

[10:50] they would charge you $2,000, okay?

[10:52] So that means that you are now getting this game

[10:55] for $7,750 if you add the value of the topper.

[11:00] Now, if Stern made this machine,

[11:02] how much do you think it would cost?

[11:03] Think about it.

[11:04] If Stern put this much into a machine,

[11:06] how much would it cost?

[11:08] You know, I see people being apologist again

[11:10] for Stern Pinball.

[11:11] James Bond is $13,000 and Stern is now using

[11:16] a single node board to fire all of the pop bumpers.

[11:21] So they're no longer individually firing pop bumpers,

[11:24] which is so much cheaper for them to do.

[11:26] They do it in their cheap like Stern the pin,

[11:29] you know, that home version of pinball.

[11:31] And you're telling me that they're not cutting more corners,

[11:34] they're not yanking more out of these games

[11:36] and then charging you more money.

[11:38] And it's really disgusting to see.

[11:40] They took out the foil decals,

[11:43] they're taking out individually fired pop bumpers.

[11:46] How much cheaper can they make these games

[11:48] and then charge us more money?

[11:50] I think everybody's seeing this and being like,

[11:52] I'm done, I'm fed up with this.

[11:55] Why would I give them money

[11:56] when they're clearly removing stuff from the games?

[12:00] So look, Cactus Canyon Ellie is making its way to customers.

[12:03] The game is gorgeous.

[12:04] Now, this means we're gonna start to think about

[12:07] what's next from CGC.

[12:08] The next game from them is going to be Pulp Fiction,

[12:11] which is a collaboration with Thraw Thrill's.

[12:14] It is a single level game

[12:16] and that should be coming out sometime in 2023.

[12:19] So CGC finally making progress.

[12:22] Haggis Pimbal, let's talk about them for a minute.

[12:24] Damien said that he would finish

[12:26] all of the Fathom mermaid editions by the end of the year.

[12:30] He's not going to do that.

[12:32] There are 250 mermaid editions

[12:34] he was supposed to have made by the end of the year.

[12:38] I don't even think they're making more than five a week.

[12:41] And if you do the math,

[12:42] and let's say they're making five a week,

[12:44] that means it would take them an entire year

[12:47] to make all 250.

[12:50] The duck guy, the duck Pimbal, the duck dynasty,

[12:52] whoever that guy was down from South America,

[12:55] he's left Haggis Pimbal.

[12:57] We have not seen another production update video.

[13:00] We've seen some games going out.

[13:02] Don't get me wrong, these games are going out,

[13:04] but they are nowhere near the timeline

[13:07] Damien has been telling people.

[13:09] And the reason why Haggis still upsets me

[13:12] is they are still telling people,

[13:14] it will be eight weeks.

[13:15] If you pay in full today,

[13:17] you will get your game in eight weeks.

[13:19] Damien continues to tell people that.

[13:22] You know how long it's taking people to get their games?

[13:24] More like six months.

[13:26] So I just want to say for the record,

[13:28] whether you vote for me in the Twippies or not,

[13:31] I still think this business practice is disingenuous.

[13:35] And I think it speaks to the character

[13:37] of the people over at that company.

[13:39] Don't lie, just tell people it'll be six months.

[13:43] Tell them it'll be a year, right?

[13:45] Jerry over at Multimorphic, he's telling people,

[13:48] if you order a P3, it's gonna be 12 months

[13:52] before you get it.

[13:53] At least he's being honest.

[13:55] If Jerry told people, if you pay in full

[13:57] for your Multimorphic, you'll have it in eight weeks

[14:00] and then it takes six months, then yes,

[14:02] you are knowingly misleading your buyer base.

[14:06] And I don't like this behavior

[14:08] and I don't hear any other podcasts talking about it.

[14:11] Like nobody else is talking about the fact

[14:13] that Haggis Pimbal, once again,

[14:15] is misleading its customers

[14:17] because as long as a few games trickle out,

[14:19] everyone has just like revisionist history

[14:22] and just gives this company a pass.

[14:25] They're not gonna get a pass with Canada.

[14:27] I think the games are beautiful,

[14:28] but I think the management team over there

[14:31] has been misleading people since day one.

[14:34] And I don't see a long-term future for this company

[14:38] if they continue to do business practice like this

[14:41] because this behavior indicates

[14:43] they have real cash flow problems.

[14:45] And the big problem for Damian now

[14:47] is he priced these games before COVID.

[14:50] And now his material costs must be through the roof

[14:55] and he can't charge more for these games.

[14:57] Like he's gonna look at a game like Fathom,

[14:59] which is gonna have a lot more in it detail-wise

[15:02] than the Keith Elwin pin.

[15:04] And he's charging what, $10,000 for only 250 of them.

[15:09] And he's gonna watch Stern Pimbal charge like 25 to 30,000

[15:14] for a game with twice as many units in the market.

[15:18] Think about it.

[15:19] But you know what?

[15:20] He couldn't really charge more

[15:21] because he's not efficient with the manufacturing.

[15:23] If he was able to make like 10 a week,

[15:25] he probably could have charged 15K and got it,

[15:29] but he can't and they still to this day

[15:32] will not tell people how many they've made.

[15:36] Let me tell you something.

[15:37] If you have to hide how many games you can make a week,

[15:40] that's not a good sign.

[15:42] They always try to pretend like it's a trade secret.

[15:45] Like this is an industry proprietary secret.

[15:48] We can't let people know how many games we make a week.

[15:50] That only is a stance you take when you're successful.

[15:54] Like Stern won't tell us how many games

[15:56] they really make a week.

[15:58] They don't want us to do the math

[15:59] because they don't want to know the sheer volume

[16:02] of games that are out there.

[16:03] Because if you knew Stern was making this many games a year,

[16:07] it might make you hesitant to think you have something

[16:10] that's actually rare and collectible.

[16:12] But when you're a boutique company,

[16:14] if you hide your production,

[16:16] that's really a bad indicator

[16:18] because we know when a boutique company can figure it out,

[16:22] they don't hide how many they can make a week

[16:25] and we have to look no further than spooky Pimbal,

[16:27] who's always been very transparent

[16:30] about how many games a week they can make.

[16:33] And that is why spooky had goodwill with the buyer base

[16:36] because you know exactly where you stand

[16:39] when you buy a game from spooky.

[16:41] When you buy a game from spooky,

[16:43] they tell you what number you are.

[16:45] So you can do the math and they have pretty much hit

[16:48] to the exact bullseye their target dates on their production.

[16:53] In fact, they've usually like come in a little early

[16:56] and have rewarded customers by getting them their games

[16:58] even before they thought they would get the games.

[17:01] But maybe you thought Canadian was going soft

[17:03] and I'm gonna be light on spooky Pimbal on this podcast.

[17:06] I'm not because did you see this TNA for $10,000?

[17:10] The TNA game has two issues with it

[17:13] that they are shipping to customers.

[17:15] It's got that weird like plate by the shooter rod

[17:17] where it's like not aligned properly.

[17:20] There's like a one inch gap, right?

[17:21] You could see it between like the lockdown bar

[17:24] and where the shooter rod housing sort of plate is.

[17:27] Spooky, come on, you've already made TNA.

[17:29] How is it hard to just make this game again

[17:32] without these boneheaded mistakes?

[17:34] And the other mistake people have pointed out,

[17:36] which is really weird because spooky's background

[17:39] was a printing company.

[17:41] The other mistake is the quality of the TNA back glass

[17:44] is like kind of washed out now.

[17:46] And one of the owners who has the new game,

[17:48] he put it next to his old Translight

[17:50] and the old one looks 10 times better.

[17:52] And he's like, why does the new game,

[17:54] which costs a lot more money, look a lot worse

[17:58] when I'm looking at the Translight

[18:00] and it's how it's printed.

[18:01] It's not the lighting, it's how it's printed.

[18:03] So spooky pinball, let me give you some advice.

[18:06] There's a reason why you're still not sold out of your TNAs.

[18:09] You need to up the quality.

[18:11] You need to stop shipping games to customers

[18:14] in which the first time they look down at their game,

[18:18] they see a lazy boneheaded detail mistake

[18:21] like the gap by the shooter rod or the Translight printing.

[18:25] I shouldn't look down at Halloween

[18:27] and see hedge multi-baw right away.

[18:30] You should have caught that at the factory.

[18:32] And I'm really encouraging spooky pinball.

[18:34] Now that they are making millions of dollars,

[18:37] now that they are ordering Corvettes,

[18:38] and I've been saying it on my Facebook Live,

[18:40] they need to stop using glue guns,

[18:43] stop making games with glue guns.

[18:44] It's too cheap.

[18:45] We're paying too much money for you to glue gun stuff down.

[18:48] They need to put the better LCD screens into the game.

[18:52] So like for this much money,

[18:53] a customer should not have to buy a $30 LCD screen on eBay

[18:57] to make the contrast on their game look much better.

[19:00] You know people want the better LCD.

[19:03] They are out there.

[19:04] They wouldn't cost you that much more money.

[19:06] You are now charging $2,500 more for this TNA over the old one.

[19:14] And you can't put a $50 LCD in it, that's better.

[19:18] This is my issue with all of pinball these days people.

[19:21] Now that the prices are this high,

[19:23] we are gonna be looking at these games like a hawk.

[19:26] And you better put everything in it,

[19:28] and it better arrive with quality.

[19:30] You better not have these boneheaded mistakes.

[19:32] Come on, spooky, you're better than this.

[19:34] All right, so we talked about spooky.

[19:36] We talked about CGC.

[19:37] We talked about stern pinball.

[19:39] No real news over at Jersey Jack Pinball,

[19:41] other than if you're a Guns N' Roses fan,

[19:43] go get your replacement playfield.

[19:45] They are now available.

[19:47] They will help you out there.

[19:48] You know my feelings on Toy Story.

[19:50] It's gonna be like catching a falling knife.

[19:52] We're gonna see this price go down and down and down.

[19:54] If the next game is Godfather, who knows?

[19:57] Like I've heard from someone who worked on Godfather

[19:59] that they think it's gonna be the surprise hit of 2023.

[20:03] And they also said it's gonna be a Cinderella story

[20:06] for Jersey Jack Pinball in the wake of Toy Story 4.

[20:10] Eric Minier, I believe in.

[20:11] I have faith in Eric Minier.

[20:13] I love Eric Minier's designs.

[20:15] I think he approaches games uniquely.

[20:17] And I think he's one of the best designers in pinball.

[20:20] And if you don't like that, go look at his game sales.

[20:23] And I don't know why anyone who loves pinball

[20:25] wouldn't really be excited about Eric.

[20:27] Like look at what he did with pirates.

[20:29] Look at what he did with Guns N' Roses.

[20:31] Why would you not be excited

[20:33] that pinball has a young designer like him

[20:36] who's willing to really push the envelope

[20:38] and think about theme integration in a really unique way.

[20:42] I really look forward to everything he does.

[20:45] And I think he is the shining star

[20:47] over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[20:49] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[20:51] All right, let's end this show

[20:53] talking about the Twippies real quick.

[20:54] Because you know me, for five years in a row,

[20:56] I've won favorite pinball podcast over at the Twippies.

[21:00] And I've always promoted the show.

[21:02] I've always been excited about the Twippies.

[21:05] I've always promoted it as the go-to annual awards

[21:08] for pinball.

[21:09] And I wanna be honest with each and every one of you.

[21:11] I'm gonna be totally candid.

[21:12] I still wanna win the sixth Twippy.

[21:13] I hope each and every one of you votes for me

[21:16] as favorite pinball podcaster

[21:17] and possibly favorite pinball streamer.

[21:20] Last year we were runner up favorite pinball streamer,

[21:22] which is crazy because I never streamed myself

[21:24] playing a single game of pinball.

[21:26] But I wanna be completely candid right now.

[21:28] I'm not excited about the show at all anymore.

[21:30] Last year's show was a total debacle.

[21:32] I was in the room.

[21:33] It was embarrassing.

[21:35] They didn't put much effort into it.

[21:36] They got the awards wrong.

[21:38] Like they literally got up there

[21:39] and didn't know what order the awards were in.

[21:41] The audio was horrible in the room.

[21:44] And for those watching back home, it was equally as bad.

[21:47] And now we're being told that this year,

[21:49] they are not gonna live stream the awards.

[21:52] That you can't watch it over the internet live

[21:54] and find out who wins each category.

[21:57] Let me ask you guys a question.

[21:58] Can you name a single other award show

[22:00] that is not broadcasted live?

[22:03] The whole point of an award show

[22:05] is that you wanna see in real time

[22:07] who wins and who loses.

[22:09] You wanna see people's acceptance speeches.

[22:11] You wanna see what they're wearing.

[22:12] You wanna see what they say.

[22:13] How can you pre-record that?

[22:15] That's gonna ruin all the fun.

[22:17] There is not a single award show that is pre-recorded.

[22:20] And so here we are in 2022 being told

[22:23] by the new TWIPI committee

[22:25] that this is how they're gonna do it.

[22:26] They're gonna make sure that the event at Texas

[22:29] goes off without a hitch and record it

[22:32] and put it up on YouTube probably days later

[22:35] so everybody else can watch it

[22:37] after they already know who won and who lost.

[22:40] Why would you do it that way?

[22:41] For five years, what I loved about the TWIPIs,

[22:44] whether it was over the internet or was live in Texas,

[22:47] is that I would go down to Texas when it was a live show

[22:50] and I knew all of my friends and family

[22:53] who voted for me all over the world

[22:55] were able to watch live on the edge of their seat

[22:59] and see if I won or not.

[23:00] And I loved knowing that, that Brenda was there

[23:03] with our friends in New York City and with Bubba

[23:05] and everyone was celebrating and cheering

[23:07] as they saw the show as it was happening.

[23:10] So you're gonna remove that element.

[23:12] 95% of people who vote in the TWIPIs

[23:15] will not be in Texas in that room.

[23:17] You need to make this show tailored

[23:20] for the 95% of people who are engaged with the show.

[23:24] So this news is absolutely inane.

[23:27] It is asinine.

[23:28] It is not how you do the show.

[23:30] It has me not excited for the show.

[23:32] This is not how you do it.

[23:33] And the reason why I know it's not how you do it

[23:35] and I'm just gonna end with this simple fact.

[23:38] Why don't buy the excuse it can't be done?

[23:41] Because it was done when Zach and Greg did the TWIPIs.

[23:46] Remember when they did it live in Texas

[23:49] it was the best show ever.

[23:51] They figured out a way to get the volumes right in the room.

[23:55] Everybody watching back home could see it

[23:57] and hear it clearly and perfectly.

[24:00] So why were they able to do it perfectly?

[24:03] And now you've done the show three times without them

[24:06] and arguably they've been getting worse each year.

[24:10] And so either you figure out a way to go back

[24:13] and get Zach and Greg on board and mark my words.

[24:17] People are just gonna stop caring about the TWIPIs.

[24:20] People are not gonna travel to TPF for the TWIPIs.

[24:24] And that's my other point.

[24:25] I don't feel like going to Texas this year.

[24:28] I always used to wanna go there for the TWIPIs

[24:31] but now I don't even care.

[24:33] I don't even wanna go.

[24:34] Why am I gonna spend money to be in a room

[24:36] in which everybody else I know is not gonna be able

[24:39] to see the show?

[24:40] I might as well just make a canned acceptance video

[24:44] and a defeat video and give it to them and say,

[24:46] hey, if I win, can you edit this into your rebroadcasting

[24:51] of the TWIPIs?

[24:52] Because I don't really feel like going there

[24:54] if everybody who supports

[24:56] Canadian Pinball Podcasts all around the world

[24:58] can't watch the show live.

[25:01] It's a boneheaded move and trust me, they're gonna alter it.

[25:04] There's no way they're gonna keep this thing

[25:07] the way it is right now.

[25:08] And I think it's absolutely boneheaded.

[25:10] And think about it like this.

[25:11] Now they've got Canada,

[25:12] the world's number one supporter of the TWIPIs.

[25:15] The guy who hyped it every single year,

[25:18] telling all of my listeners and everybody,

[25:20] I still wanna win it.

[25:21] Cause I think it sends a message to everybody out there

[25:24] that this is still the best pinball podcast.

[25:26] It's the most entertaining.

[25:28] It's the most honest.

[25:28] It's the most candid.

[25:30] But the show itself, I almost feel like boycotting

[25:33] because it's turning into an absolute joke.

[25:36] They need to get Greg and Zach back

[25:38] and it's just that simple.

[25:40] Everybody go watch the World Cup.

[25:41] I love you guys.

[25:42] Happy Sunday.

[25:44] More shows coming this week.

[25:45] There is always news in pinball as you can tell.

[25:48] And for you new club members, welcome to the club.

[25:53] Canada will be back with more episodes

[25:55] of the world's favorite,

[25:56] Twippy Voted Pinball Podcast

[25:58] that he might now be boycotting.

[25:59] Oh, Canada, you're never happy.

[26:01] I actually am really happy.

[26:02] You come to New York City.

[26:03] Let me buy you some beer, ramen and omokase later.
