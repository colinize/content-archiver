[00:00] All right, it's episode 72 of Canadian's pinball podcast and it's one of those great days

[00:24] where we finally get to see a new pinball machine and you know what I'm talking about.

[00:31] Stern's Aerosmith pinball machine has been revealed. It's at CES and I want to give my thoughts

[00:39] on that on this episode of Canadian's pinball podcast. I want to talk a little bit about American

[00:45] pinball's latest updates. I want to talk about some of the conversation taking place in the

[00:50] alien pinball thread and then I want to figure out what's going on with these collectives

[00:57] editions over at Jersey Jack. All right, so let's just let's just kick it off. So I think

[01:03] Aerosmith is a title that if you don't like Aerosmith as a band, this doesn't really matter

[01:11] to you. You know, you're not going to probably go in on an Aerosmith pinball machine and

[01:15] I think a lot of people are, you know, somewhat like, I don't know, Aerosmith as a band doesn't

[01:20] seem to have the love affair that Metallica does or ACDC or Guns and Roses. I always found

[01:28] Aerosmith to be a good band like more like a guilty pleasure rock band versus a band that

[01:33] I would openly admit to be a huge fan of. But that being said, I think this pin looks

[01:40] amazing, right? The artwork alone and I've said this before, artwork is probably the number

[01:48] one thing that we gravitate towards first. The pin looks incredible. This is Dirty Donny's artwork,

[01:55] his art package, Dirty Donny did Metallica, which people loved. I actually think his work

[02:02] on this pin is even nicer than Metallica. I think overall it just has more detail. I

[02:10] love the color usage. It's very, very sort of psychedelic sort of trippy sort of like

[02:15] that 70s Aerosmith vibe. I think it looks great. I really do. I think he did a wonderful

[02:22] job making this game just pop. I also, you know, when we look at the, what was shown

[02:30] today, what we heard, we saw that there's going to be three models of this pinball machine.

[02:35] There's going to be a pro, a premium, and an L.I. I'm not going to go into like all the

[02:39] difference sort of what's on the pin, the visual cues. You got to go look at it. I really,

[02:45] I can't really stand when podcasts try and describe something that's very visual. Just

[02:51] go look at it. But the pricing is interesting. So here's what we're hearing from people,

[02:56] because there's been so much speculation after Batman was so expensive, what would Aerosmith

[03:02] cost with the LCD and whatnot. And here's what I'm hearing distributors are quoting as the

[03:08] street prices for Aerosmith. $5,195 for the pro. The premium is $6,995, and the L.I. is $8,295.

[03:24] So that's not bad. That is not bad. You have to be happy in a world where machines are

[03:31] costing $10,000, $15,000 that you can still go get a brand new and box pinball machine for

[03:38] around $5,200. So I think pricing has come back down to earth for people, and people will be happy

[03:46] where this game is priced. What else I want to talk about with Aerosmith? So I also think the LCD

[03:53] is great. I've said it before. When I saw the video of the LCD at work with Aerosmith, I think

[04:02] it's better than Batman, because I think there's a lot more rendering and graphics that are going on,

[04:09] that feel more like a pinball machine, versus just looking at DVD clips from a TV show over and

[04:15] over again. I know a lot of people were concerned that it would just be Aerosmith music videos that

[04:21] we'd see over and over again, but no, it's really cool animations. I know some people are like,

[04:27] well, this looks like mid-90s animations from Flash and bad computer graphics.

[04:35] Let's come on, guys. This is so much better than Red Dots on Ghostbusters and what color DMDs

[04:43] bring to the table. So I think as a step forward in pinball animations, I think it looks really,

[04:49] really good. I haven't shot the pin. I think the main discussion going on on the forum is all about

[04:57] the pro versus the premium and LE. The lack of, there's an upper playfield on the premiums

[05:02] and LE that are in the upper right corner. I have to say, I haven't been a big fan of upper

[05:09] playfields and then adding to the game. I wasn't a fan of it in Game of Thrones. I don't think that

[05:17] upper playfields have been utilized in the right way, and they actually detract from the flow

[05:24] of a game. So I think the pro might actually be the more fun pin to play. But that being said,

[05:31] it doesn't look like this upper playfield is going to trap the ball up there for very long

[05:37] or will disrupt the flow very much. A lot of people are comparing this to KISS. This is a

[05:42] Borg design pin. Borg designed KISS too, right? I think I have that right. So I'm not shocked that

[05:53] there's similarities between the two. But I think what Stern is doing, and in some say this,

[06:01] yes, they do play it safe and yes, the layouts aren't completely original, because they know

[06:09] what works. They know what works. Would I like to see more creativity in layout and design from them?

[06:16] I think a lot of people say it. There's only so much you can do with layout before you start

[06:21] getting into territory that ruins the flow of a game. I don't like the way Waz is laid out at all.

[06:29] I don't think there's any flow in that game at all. I'm talking about Wizard of Oz.

[06:35] What I'm trying to think about other games that have will have just unique layouts. Rob Zombie is

[06:40] one. It's unique layout. Is it a great layout? I don't really think so. So I think Stern knows

[06:47] or has their formula of flow and has their formula of fun shots and they sort of stick to it.

[06:55] And yes, it's not the most completely original game. The big mechanism or toy in this game is

[07:02] really cool. It's like this jester's box that locks the balls and then spits out six balls for

[07:08] a multi ball. Really cool. There's a magnet in front of that as well that interacts with the ball.

[07:14] Overall, I'm very impressed with this package. You gotta just zoom out and look at this game and say,

[07:22] wow, it looks great. The video looks fun. I don't mean, I don't, again, I think all pinball on

[07:30] some level looks fun. I think this game has succeeded in a simple thing that it's done. It's made

[07:37] the people who are just naysayers who said like, I don't care about Aerosmith pinball at all. I

[07:43] think it's made those people reconsider it and be open to enjoying it because it just looks so

[07:50] awesome. It looks so awesome. And I think if you're an Aerosmith fan and you've been waiting for an

[07:54] Aerosmith pinball machine, your ship has come in. I think you're going to be super excited. I would

[08:00] be, I wish I could get a new guns and roses pinball machine from Stern that looked this damn good

[08:04] and had this kind of awesome artwork. Dirty Donnie's style works perfectly for rock and roll theme,

[08:11] pinball machines. And I think this game looks great. I'm trying to think like what else people

[08:17] are really talking about. You know, there's the back and forth discussions on pinside and it's

[08:22] all healthy and I think it's all been pretty positive. I think people are really just satisfied with

[08:27] what they're seeing so far. And I think the pricing is exactly where it needs to be for Stern to

[08:33] be successful with this pinball machine. I mean, at the end of the day, 5195 for 5200 bucks. I mean,

[08:41] that is what spooky is charging for Domino's pinball. Think about that for a minute. Compare Domino's

[08:48] pinball to Aerosmith Pro. Compare the art package on Aerosmith Pro to Alien, right? Again,

[09:00] looks great. Looks great. And it's, I don't know, did they say when it's going to be available?

[09:06] Usually when Stern reveals something like this within a, you know, a month or six weeks,

[09:11] it'll be shipping. So we look forward to reading more about what people say about this pin. We look

[09:17] forward to seeing people play this pin shortly. But I think overall, if we have to say, you know,

[09:24] our initial assessments, I think it looks stellar. I think it looks stellar. And I think Stern is,

[09:30] I won't say like they're going to have a huge hit because it's Aerosmith. And I again,

[09:34] still think the band's polarizing. But I think this is just showing that Stern has the best pinball

[09:40] platform going right now. The LCD is the perfect size. The back box, Translight is the perfect size

[09:48] for artwork still to be there when the game is off. And they know what they're doing, man. We said

[09:54] this in our 2017 prediction show, but Stern is on a roll. Stern has a lot of momentum. And it's just,

[10:02] it just seems like they're going to keep coming out with hit after hit after hit. Now that brings

[10:07] me to my next point is Stern's pacing just boggles my mind. And the marketer in me is like,

[10:14] didn't we just serve Batman 66 to the world? And we haven't even let that game even ship,

[10:23] even even those owners haven't had like two weeks to have the latest Stern pinball machine. And

[10:30] there's already we're on to the next. We're on to the next. And I think this is just a huge mistake.

[10:36] And from what I can tell, Aerosmith was actually further along than Batman was and was supposed to

[10:45] come out at Expo with Batman to follow. But because they wanted to hit the Batman

[10:51] anniversary year and Stern's birthday with Batman, they flipped it. And this is what I'm hearing.

[10:57] And so they rushed out to show Batman and shelved Aerosmith the CES. And I you know, I don't

[11:04] really care like the reasoning behind it. But I then think it's still silly that Aerosmith is being

[11:12] shown like two weeks after people are getting Batman. There's just no there's no pace here that

[11:19] feels right. And I've said this before, like doesn't Ghostbusters Ellie feel like five years ago,

[11:25] the hype was around that pin. The Batman hype, it's it's already kind of fading away a little bit.

[11:34] And I really think Stern needs to stop with the way they just sort of pile everything on top of it,

[11:41] you know, each other. They need to pace this stuff out better. And I know this is like silly,

[11:46] right? I'm asking a company to slow down their shipments, to slow down their reveals, to slow down

[11:52] their new inbox deliveries. Isn't that crazy that I'm asking that where everyone else needs to

[11:59] speed it up and get their shit out? But I think Stern would be better off really revealing and

[12:06] shipping games like three major games every four months or every four months we get a new title

[12:14] or every three months if they're going to do four titles a year. But it's it just feels like when

[12:18] they layer them so close to each other like this, it's just I don't know. It's a stupid thing to

[12:23] complain about. But as a marketer, I just think it it doesn't give enough of a window of excitement.

[12:29] Because we're already on to the next. We're on to the next. We're on to the next. We're on to the next.

[12:33] You know, and then and then what is there going to be like a long drought now between Erasmith and

[12:37] the next pin? And you know, none of us really know what the next one is. I don't think it's going to

[12:42] be Star Wars. I don't. I think they're going to hold Star Wars off to later in the year. More like

[12:47] an expo to have them ship around episode eight coming out. So I you know, I think it's going to be

[12:54] there like a mystery pin or a vault edition of something but but we'll see. But you know, hard to

[13:00] complain about a company shipping too many pinball machines, right? Very hard to complain about that.

[13:07] All right. What else has been going on this week that I want to discuss on Canada's pinball

[13:12] podcast? Let's go to collector's editions of dialed in. So we asked like a few podcasts ago that

[13:23] one of the New Year's resolutions we hope all companies would adopt is just to be more honest

[13:29] with their communication and their transparency. You know, Stern doesn't say anything so Stern never

[13:34] breaks a promise. You know, sometimes they get themselves in trouble with maybe some of their

[13:39] quality control reports and their messages to customers about when they'll fix a certain issue.

[13:45] But for the most part, Stern doesn't miss deadlines. Stern doesn't say things and then

[13:52] then go radio silent or not deliver. So Jersey Jack said we're going to make or take orders for

[14:00] dialed in collector's edition. And we're going to take orders up until New Year's Eve, right?

[14:08] The December 31 midnight is going to be the cut off. And once we reach that, those number of

[14:14] orders are going to be the only amount of games we build for dialed in collector's edition.

[14:20] And then we will announce the next day how many orders we got. Okay, that's what Jack said he would

[14:26] do. Jack didn't do that. He hasn't announced yet how many orders they got. And there is one guy

[14:35] on the forums. I think it's his name's Richie. He's on the dialed in thread. And it's amazing

[14:42] because this guy is like the most excited person on planet earth. His name's Richie wrench.

[14:49] And he's been just going back and forth like justifying the collector's edition. And I almost

[14:54] thought this guy was like a shill for JJP, but he's not. He's just an excited buyer. And it's great.

[14:59] His enthusiasm and his passion to get the collector's edition has been palpable.

[15:06] And this guy is just like this is bullshit. This is bullshit. Like Jack, like where is the

[15:12] communication around the amount he's going to build? And everyone else everyone else has been saying

[15:18] where you've been, bro. This is exactly what Jack does over and over and over again. And guess what?

[15:25] He did it again. It is just amazing that he would say what he was going to do and then not do it.

[15:32] And what is it? January 3rd, January 4th. And we still don't have, I'm looking at my phone,

[15:38] January 4th. And we still don't have the number. And you know, look, I think this is what Jack is

[15:43] going to do. And this is why I don't trust Jack when it comes to these special editions.

[15:49] I think Jack is going to say a number sometime soon, but I think that number is going to be made up.

[15:56] I think it's going to be inflated on purpose. And here's why. Let's say what actually happened was

[16:04] by December 31st midnight, Jack only got 57 collectors edition orders for dialed in.

[16:11] Right? That number doesn't seem good, right? It doesn't seem like people are that excited,

[16:18] especially seeing the frenzy created around Batman's super LA. So does he want to announce that

[16:26] the number is really low? And it's very small because that might start to indicate that there's

[16:31] just not that much interest or popularity in this pin. It also will prohibit him from selling

[16:37] more than that number if people really want to get one down the road and then Jack's leaving all

[16:44] that money on the table because we know the profit margin on the collectors edition is the highest

[16:49] profit margin of any model he'll make because none of those extras even come close to adding up to

[16:55] the $12,500 price. So instead of doing that, instead of Jack communicating the actual number,

[17:02] what I think he's going to do, I think he's going to announce a made up number that's inflated.

[17:06] So instead of like let's say 67 sold, I think Jack is going to say we sold 250 or 300 were ordered.

[17:17] Again, I think that number is made up. I think he's going to make up a big number. And that way,

[17:22] he's kind of got the people who actually ordered stock because remember, those people gave $1,000,

[17:28] non-refundable deposits on the machine by midnight. And so I think what's going to happen is

[17:36] those people are not really going to back out. And then if Jack ever wants to make more,

[17:41] he can just always make more because oh, we said we're going to make 300. He doesn't have to build them

[17:46] until other people come to him and ask for one. I think it's a little bit shady.

[17:53] I think the fact that he didn't come right out and answer how many were sold right away,

[17:59] like he said he would, is lame. Jack, why? Why? Why do you do this? Why did you say I'm going to do

[18:06] this and then not do it? It just annoys me and it continues to show that Jack just can't be trusted.

[18:15] He can't be trusted. We will trust you, Jack. When you stay true to your word and you stay true to

[18:21] your deadlines of when you're going to either deliver or when you're going to communicate something,

[18:26] there's no excuse. There's no excuse in this modern error where Jack has access to Pinside. Jack

[18:33] employees have access to Pinside. That thing could have been communicated at 12.01 AM,

[18:39] New Year's Eve, how many were sold? He knew. He knew. There was no mystery.

[18:44] Disappointed in that, and I think he's going to pull a fast one again and just make these things

[18:50] well into the future. There's no cut off to getting a collector's edition dialed in people.

[18:55] You could hit Jack up at any time, any year, and get one. He'll just say that was one of the original

[19:02] 300 that were ordered. It's like when they do the smoug alleys and the gold editions and the

[19:09] Ruby Red and there's like 1500 of them and you know they don't ship an order and it's all a

[19:16] farce. It's all a farce. The numbers are arbitrary. You can get it whenever you want it.

[19:21] All right. What else is going on in the forum this week in Pimbal?

[19:26] Well, one thing else before I move on from like Aerosmith, how can you justify a $5,195

[19:37] dollar? Aerosmith Pro next to a $15,000 Batman Super Ellie. I really think the Batman Super Ellie

[19:47] guys right now are feeling a little bit underwhelmed. I think the hype has died down.

[19:55] I think the art package on Aerosmith is actually much nicer and was designed, was hand drawn

[20:02] specifically for the machine is much more cohesive and it's just a nicer art package than Batman.

[20:09] Nothing beats when you hand draw the artwork for the machine specifically versus Photoshop dropping it.

[20:17] I have to think that those people on Batman are feeling a little bit taken. You're not going to be

[20:25] able to look down and justify that $15K price. So yeah. And even with like the renderings on the LCD,

[20:33] I think this week if I'm a Batman SLE owner, I'm feeling like my parade is being reigned on a little

[20:42] bit and I might be scratching my head to try and justify $10,000 more than an Aerosmith Pro

[20:52] for Batman SLE. That is crazy. I think Stern was, they created a vacuum to sell those SLEs and people

[21:02] man, they fell for it, they fell for it. But I think now that we've got something to compare it to

[21:09] and the pricing has come back down to earth, I just can't see people being over the moon

[21:17] dropping 15K in an SLE. And like I said before, we're going to see SLEs go up for sale and they're going

[21:24] to go down in value. There's just no way they're going to go up or keep their value. All right.

[21:29] What else is going on? American Pimball. Let's go there because this is the other thread that

[21:35] has been coming alive again. And I got to say, you know, as much as I've said, I feel like I know

[21:43] what's going on at American Pimball. I really just want to pull my hair out with these guys at this

[21:49] point because I just don't know what the fuck is going on. And I say that in a frustrated way because

[21:55] it's like every day there's just a different announcement now that seems to just conflict

[22:02] with each other. And nothing is clear. Nothing is clear. It's this purposely ambiguous communication

[22:11] that continues to make people scratch their head and just say, what is going on over there?

[22:17] And why can't we just get an answer that's specific that actually outlines,

[22:25] you know, what they plan to do. So I just want to read the two posts that they put up literally

[22:34] three days apart. So the first one was on January 1st and you know, beginning of the new year at 9am,

[22:40] they say, Happy New Year's everyone. We appreciate everyone's support and interest in the progress

[22:45] related to Magic Girl and how American Pimball is supporting Zidware with the manufacturing of the

[22:51] machines. As many of you've mentioned, due to some unexpected Zidware administrative and legal

[22:57] challenges, the company has begun to has been unable to ship the Pimball machines as originally plan.

[23:04] However, things are looking up for 2017 as the company is making good progress and hopes to have

[23:10] an update for Magic Girl customers and the Pimball community very soon. In the meantime, happy

[23:14] holiday to everyone. Stay tuned for more updates. Okay. So if you just take that post by itself,

[23:20] January 1st, three days ago, that post to me says, we're still going to ship Magic Girl.

[23:27] We ran into some legal and administrative issues. We've ironed those out and there's good news

[23:34] coming soon for you guys, for Zidware guys that were manufacturing these machines for. Okay. That's

[23:39] it. I don't think you can extract anything else from that. All right. All right. So their latest

[23:44] post that happened yesterday, like two days later, happy holidays everyone. As the New Year is

[23:51] upon us, we too have something to be grateful for. We are happy to say that we've made some great

[23:56] progress on Houdini, our first original Pimball machine. The rumors are true. We have started fresh

[24:03] from the ground up with our new team and we imagine the game in ways we never thought

[24:09] possible. Okay. I love that they say the rumors are true. There were no rumors that they were

[24:13] started completely over. We have heard nothing from them. Nothing. There has been no rumors. We have

[24:19] been unable to even rumor about this. And then they go on to say, while it's too early for pictures

[24:26] to share just yet, we felt it was important to share that our American Pimball team is growing

[24:30] and we're proud to say that we've added some well-respected experience Pimball professionals to

[24:34] our American Pimball family. Thanks for all your support so far and please keep a look out for

[24:39] more details and another update later this week. Okay. So if we take both of those posts as separate

[24:47] things, one says, Zidware guys, good news is coming soon. We're still going to deliver magic girls.

[24:55] Look for an update soon. The other says we're proud to announce that Houdini is being made new

[25:03] with Joe Ballsor basically, right? That's what they're saying from the ground up.

[25:09] And so what that infers is it's not John Papadouk's Zidware version of Houdini. This is an

[25:15] original American Pimball Houdini game that you're going to get. Okay. So if you were to take those

[25:21] two things and just look at them separately, disconnected, you really could just take them

[25:27] each at face value and be fine and move on. The problem is, the problem is there's a linchpin,

[25:35] there's a connective thread of John Papadouk that connects the two of these entities in a way

[25:42] that you can't just separate as cleanly as I think American Pimball would like us to separate

[25:48] because John Papadouk was working on Houdini. John showed us his vision for Houdini, his art

[25:55] package which we know is not going to carry over. We saw on Texas Pimball Festival is going to

[26:02] have Joe Ballsor there showing Houdini and showing the new art package. So it's all going to be

[26:08] different. It's all going to be different. And I think you know, people are plotting that.

[26:12] It makes sense to start fresh, fresh new company. But then a whole lot of stuff doesn't make sense,

[26:20] and everyone's pointing this out. It's pretty obvious. Why even connect the John in the first

[26:26] place? Why get all the baggage? Why show his Zidware version of Houdini? And then now you have

[26:31] the backtrack and start over again. I think what people are just saying is, what's your deal with

[26:37] J-Pop? Are you cutting ties completely? Are you going to just ship the magic girls? And that's

[26:42] sort of like, you're just building them for Zidware that wasn't an AP game, that wasn't an AP thing.

[26:49] Are you going to just get that done and be done with him and have Joe do Houdini on his own?

[26:55] Are you cutting ties with John completely? Is John still going to stay on as a designer and a

[26:59] consultant? None of these questions have answers, right? They are being speculated on left and right.

[27:06] I think a lot of people are reading too much into what these two posts are with American Pimball.

[27:13] I reached out to American Pimball and to Scott and I've had open dialogue with Scott and I'm

[27:19] not going to share everything we say, but I think a lot of you should just reach out to American

[27:24] Pimball if you do have questions. I think we need to take these posts a little bit at face value.

[27:30] And they are this. They are that Houdini, yes, is not longer going to be a J-Pop game. That doesn't

[27:37] mean they've sacked J-Pop. It doesn't mean they're no longer working with J-Pop. It just means

[27:41] Joe's the designer that's going to get that game done. They want to get it done in a timely manner

[27:45] and they would be crazy to give John Papaduke an assignment to finish a game in six months or

[27:51] nine months. They'd be crazy. The guy can't finish quickly. So they gave it to Joe. Joe's like come

[27:56] in. He's like, I'm going to finish it. I'm going to make this game happen and get it done

[28:01] on the, you know, within the deadline that we've set. Took Joe a long time to get Wizard of Oz done

[28:08] so we'll see if you can do it. I'm rooting for them. I'm optimistic. They can get it done. So

[28:13] that's what that update is all about. And then the Magic Girls Zidware update that they said is

[28:20] like look like we're making these games for Zidware to go out to customers and they're distancing

[28:28] themselves from the rest of like Zidware and the rest of like the the Asco that that whole thing

[28:35] became. And look, I got to like give these guys some slack like they don't deserve to be crucified

[28:46] 100% yes they do deserve some blame. They know they were getting into but they wanted to show

[28:51] they could make a game and look I want to believe they can make a game. I want to believe they made

[28:56] Magic Girl. I want to see Magic Girl ship. I know every I 99% of people want to see Magic Girl ship

[29:02] nobody doesn't want to see it eventually out there. No one doesn't want it to to to be in people's

[29:09] homes. You know some of the Rosalow owners just are a little bitter and are just screaming for

[29:14] the whole thing to collapse but why that's just like that that's just a silly way to approach this

[29:21] whole thing. But but I think over the next couple weeks the next couple weeks are critical and

[29:28] I'll say this why because I think the window is open for them to to get this machine out there

[29:34] and and and again like I just I know more than I want than I'm going to say but I'll say this

[29:40] the balls and Johns Court the balls and AP's court to just get the games out now the hurdles aren't

[29:47] there and whatever the hurdles are now there's only one big hurdle that would prevent it from going

[29:55] out at this stage and that is that the game is not done and if the game isn't done then I think

[30:02] everyone's patience is going to be done I think you know Bill Brandnis was brought up in the thread

[30:07] and Pintage and all these people that are working to get the game out. There are no hurdles other

[30:17] than John and and I want people to understand that there is only one person that is now responsible

[30:24] for getting these games out and two people and that is John Papa Duke Jr. You know it's it's not

[30:30] AP it's not it's not Bill Brandnis it's not lawsuits it's not Razah owners John needs to finish

[30:39] the game and put it in a box and and and say it's done and I still and and and and I reached out

[30:46] to John the day and I didn't hear back and and I'm telling him like this isn't man he he need it to

[30:52] stars to align to have a shot at redemption he needed those stars to align and the stars aligned

[30:59] they aligned and he got his dream he got his wealthy investor he got his his angel investor he got

[31:07] and he got the right guy he got a guy with manufacturing skillset he got another year to work on it

[31:13] he got the legal people to say okay like ship it everything aligned for him where's the pin

[31:21] where's the pin John and and and again I think everyone's patience is running out my patience

[31:26] everyone's patience I hope I hope within two weeks we see video of someone unboxing a magic girl

[31:34] it sounds like a crazy wish it does I it's I sound like a madman even saying I hope for this but

[31:41] enough is enough John if you're listening if AP out there listen they know they know how I feel

[31:48] and I think this echoes how a lot of people feel it's time to get this thing out or just pull

[31:53] the plug on it for good it's done it's over forget it just put the zidware suffering to one final

[32:02] and if it's not going to go out soon all right the last thing I want to talk about on this

[32:06] episode of Canadian's pinball podcast is alien pinball and and and and and the thing I want to talk

[32:13] about is something that it's crazy that this doesn't get more conversation going and I've said it

[32:20] before I'm just I'm I'm I'm boggled by the the past that people continue to give highway pinball

[32:27] and how if other pinball manufacturers were pulling the same thing they're being army at the door

[32:33] expecting some answers and I'm also referring to like a great post the black knight just put up

[32:38] recently and it was in the Houdini thread just being like you guys are all angry at the wrong

[32:44] manufacturer these guys haven't taken anyone's money AP they don't owe you anything on Houdini there's

[32:49] another another manufacturer out there that's taken a lot of people's money and promised a pinball

[32:53] machine and keeps missing dates and missing promises left and right and but here's here's the thing I

[32:59] want to focus on with alien on on this podcast and I just have one simple question and and it's a

[33:05] question for for oric for Andrew for those of you in on the game where is the Ellie package

[33:12] of the machine why has the Ellie package of alien pinball not been shown why not I don't

[33:21] understand they said in the summer that they were working on the Ellie artwork and they were

[33:26] going to submit to Fox and we would see it shortly where where's the trim what is it going to look

[33:34] what does it look like the final game with the beacons on topic what the fact that people's money

[33:40] has been taken for something they haven't really seen yet is is is wrong I isn't that wrong and I

[33:48] the reason why I bring this up because on the thread I hear people saying well it doesn't matter

[33:53] anyway I don't really need to see it um what you know everything's going to be a viable option

[34:00] for standard owners are you kidding me if stern pinball took money on an Ellie like without showing

[34:09] you the package wouldn't you go crazy and like they did a little bit that with Batman right and it

[34:14] was wrong it was like they've never really done that before but but this machine this is we're talking

[34:20] like a year delayed we're talking s it's been like I feel like eight months since or showed the

[34:27] playfield maybe like six months at least since we've been promised the Ellie artwork and I'm just

[34:33] like where is the Ellie package and and this just means just saying I think people deserve to see it

[34:41] I think highway needs to stop stalling I also think it's like highly questionable that they're not

[34:47] building Ellie's first and showing people the Ellie first look there's one company out there

[34:53] that knows how to do it right and it's stern ask yourselves people why does stern build the

[34:59] Ellie's first and get them out because those people pay them most so they deserve to get it first

[35:04] but also the Ellie package like should be designed and shown and is the best way to show what the

[35:10] game is capable of you know it's like the it's like the halo version of the product and that's what

[35:15] you want to like get people excited with and then you can you can sell people like the pro or the

[35:20] you know the premium the lesser models um but the fact that there's nothing and and people are

[35:26] asking like why can't we see it so what's the official response the response are we still waiting

[35:31] on Fox for approvals I don't buy it I don't buy it and I think more people need to be asking to just

[35:37] see this stuff and and and and Andrew like you said you were gonna you said you were gonna ship

[35:43] games in December you said you were gonna you're gonna ship a lot in January how are you gonna do

[35:47] that um if this stuff's not final and like doesn't have to be ready to go on the line but just show

[35:53] people what they're getting their money for and for those guys with money I just don't understand

[35:57] why people are like still handing over money until you're seeing what you're gonna get I say these

[36:03] guys you need to approach them carefully and you need to be cautious that's all I'm saying you

[36:11] need to be cautious here I don't want to say I told you so if people run in and and things go

[36:17] wrong here there are red flags and I think not seeing the Ellie package is a major red flag in

[36:23] January of 2017 all right before I conclude two things I want to address before and this episode

[36:30] um you know I I go back and forth with certain people and call people out and and one of the

[36:35] people that I've had some back and forth with has been a Jeff Rivera over the pinball podcast and

[36:42] I want to say something that happened yesterday and I think it's important to mention

[36:47] um Jeff had mentioned something about me or Canadian flipping his Batman Ellie on one of the

[36:54] threads and said it in a way that was you know pretty slanderous about my actions and and and I

[37:01] hit him up on Facebook and and I said like yeah like I I sold my Batman Ellie for for $12,000

[37:07] in cash and why are you so upset about that and and at first like we started going back and forth

[37:13] the way we would on Pinside where you know it's jab after jab after jab and and then after like a

[37:19] while it is it was actually great we both were just we started to just calm down and talk about

[37:26] pinball and all of a sudden we realized that we kind of were agreeing on almost everything that

[37:31] our feelings about stern and what they've been doing recently we agreed upon and we started just

[37:36] buried the hatchet like two grown men in real time on Facebook while we were chatting and we had a

[37:44] great talk and and I think I want to adopt more of that sort of let's just all be a little bit more

[37:52] positive towards each other and and don't slam each other or say personal things that indicate

[38:00] we know the person right because so much of how we tear each other down indicates like we know them

[38:08] no like just because someone doesn't like this on like pinball machine doesn't give you permission

[38:13] to call the person like an idiot you know and it's like just because I flipped my Batman

[38:18] machine doesn't make me like a scumbag I'm as I told Jeff like I'm not ruining the hobby

[38:23] you know I sold a machine to a guy who's happy I'm happy I didn't take possession of the pin not

[38:28] because I didn't want it it just didn't turn out to be the pin I want it but I don't think

[38:33] profiteering is a bad thing because as we see at the end of the day you can't always be a profiteer

[38:42] in this hobby you will get burned and and and I'm not the reason why Sterns increasing prices you

[38:49] know people want to pay it they'll pay it but I think Erasmith and what it's priced at is going to

[38:54] start to show people that it's just getting ridiculous like just get the premium the Ellie hype

[39:00] train and and and and falling forward every time and needing to have it it's just so stupid like

[39:06] five years from now everyone's going to be like all these Ellie's don't mean shit because there's

[39:11] just so many just good pins out there everywhere that the experience isn't enhanced just because

[39:17] you got that fucking armor on it no one's gonna care about that stupid fucking plaque again it's just

[39:24] new in box hype that just brings out the worst in everybody all right and the last point I want to

[39:30] make a listener of the show Tim sort of hit me up and it was like canada you didn't give Dutch

[39:35] pinball enough airtime on your your your predictions for 2017 you just kind of glossed over them

[39:41] and they're shipping pins and you spent more time on companies that haven't shipped anything like

[39:45] what gives and I read his whole explanation about how they've shipped 50 pins and they might ship

[39:53] 250 in 2017 and how that's a pretty big deal and I should talk more about Dutch pinball

[39:59] and my response to Tim is the same as it will be right now is I don't think there's anything

[40:05] they really talk about or get it excited about with Dutch pinball in 2017 I don't so all they're doing

[40:14] is finally fulfilling orders that were placed two three years ago all right cool what is there to

[40:23] look forward to there's no game two on the horizon and I have to say this at the level they're

[40:29] shipping out pins I'd be surprised if Dutch pinball is still in business in 2018 same thing with

[40:37] highway pinball if they don't get alien out the door in large numbers I'd be surprised if you see

[40:42] highway pinball in business in 2018 that's not me rooting for these companies to fail I'll tell you

[40:48] what's going to sink these companies is Aerosmith Star Wars Batman look at look at Stern their

[40:54] machine can crank out these machines and they're already designing the next games for the next

[41:01] few years they're in development do you think Andrew has like lots of money to keep developing game

[41:08] the next game the next game and is no where's the money coming from how's he paying people to

[41:15] design those games if no one is coming in and no pins are shipping he only makes money when

[41:19] pins ship nothing shipping same thing with Dutch like where's the funds the all the money that they're

[41:27] getting now is just to to make the games that were ordered so long ago and Stern is already on to

[41:33] the next on to the next and look I think Stern this year is just going to cripple everybody else

[41:40] cripple them I would hate to be a Stern competitor in 2017 good fucking luck good luck you better

[41:49] come with magic and maybe Houdini can do it we'll see that's episode 72 of Canators pinball podcasts

[41:55] have a good day everybody I'll talk to you real soon
