[00:30] Let's start this show talking about this rumor because a year ago when I put up that picture of the cornerstone, right?

[00:36] And I was like these are gonna be the cornerstone games from Stern Pimbal. It was Foo Fighters. It was Jaws.

[00:43] It was James Bond and we had Indiana Jones on there. Now I heard like a while ago

[00:49] that John Borg was gonna go back to Indiana Jones and make a brand new game.

[00:55] Now here's the thing. Do we think this is gonna happen? And I hope this happens.

[00:59] I mean just when we thought, you know, we were gonna write Stern off and Stern doesn't have big themes and everything's gonna

[01:06] go Jersey Jack's way. If they make Indiana Jones, how many of you out there is this a buy it now theme?

[01:14] I actually think Indiana Jones is even more popular than Back to the Future and it just doesn't have a modern game

[01:22] that was good. The old Balli Williams game is a classic, right? The Mark Ritchie game

[01:28] absolutely a classic Pimbal machine. And you know, Sterns are really cheap.

[01:32] I don't know how Stern could ever make a game better than that Balli Williams game,

[01:38] but what we haven't had in the history of Indiana Jones machines,

[01:42] we haven't had a game in which Harrison Ford is actually in the game itself.

[01:46] Remember, it's not his likeness on the Translight and it's a DMD error game.

[01:50] And are we gonna get a modern Indiana Jones game? And if Stern's gonna make Indiana Jones,

[01:58] wouldn't that be the first game you use Spike 3, right? Why does Stern always do this?

[02:03] They use the outdated platform with a juggernaut theme because I'm hearing that Metallica is

[02:10] gonna be the first game on Spike 3. And if so, Indiana Jones is next.

[02:15] That means it's gonna be on the old hardware. Remember when Stern made Ghostbusters with the DMD screen, right?

[02:22] And then the next game was freaking LCD. They couldn't give us Ghostbusters with the new technology.

[02:28] And so, John Borg, Indiana Jones. Now, here's the thing. Which Indiana Jones movie would it be?

[02:36] Everybody out there wants it to be Raiders of the Lost Ark, right? Just start with that movie.

[02:41] Make it just that movie. Don't make it the first three movies.

[02:45] Just make it Raiders of the Lost Ark. And then, hey, the next game can be

[02:49] Temple of Doom. And then after that, make a standalone game for The Last Crusade.

[02:55] When you have a juggernaut property like this, and they really are three separate movies,

[03:00] it's not one trilogy like The Lord of the Rings. It's a separate movie.

[03:05] Each one has a separate storyline, has a lot of different elements that are different, and the physical things you would want in the game would be too hard to do

[03:14] if you try to cram it all into one game. And so, if you made those three movies separately,

[03:20] you would sell five to six thousand of each one. Like, Stern could have chopped up Star Wars, and they should have.

[03:27] They should have made A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi as three separate machines.

[03:33] Now, here's the part where I'm starting to get a little bit nervous.

[03:37] Because what game do we think is coming out, right? The rumored game is D&D, Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:44] Now, here's the speculation that I'm gonna put out there, is that D&D does not stand for Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:52] D&D stands for Dial of Destiny, which is the last Indiana Jones movie, and now it sort of maybe makes sense.

[04:02] Maybe D&D was just codename for Dial of Destiny Indiana Jones, and I can hear everybody out there crying and cringing

[04:11] if that's the Indiana Jones game we get. That would be the equivalent of making Just Toy Story 4.

[04:18] So, I really hope that Stern Pimball's not gonna make Dial of Destiny, but they're gonna go back and make the classic Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[04:27] And John Borg, he made an Indiana Jones game back in the day, and it wasn't very good.

[04:33] So, will he come back and hit us with something much more spectacular?

[04:38] I'm a little worried over at Stern these days because they don't really have the engineering power anymore.

[04:43] Their head of engineering went over to Jersey Jack Pimball for a reason, and I heard he quit because he was not happy

[04:51] with the stuff that was going into Jaws Pimball, and all you have to do is look down at Jaws Pimball, look at the mechs in it,

[04:58] and then go look at a Bally Williams game and realize Stern is nowhere near putting the engineering magic into these games.

[05:05] Okay, so that's Indiana Jones. Is it gonna be next?

[05:09] The other rumor I'm hearing now is that Metallica, which will be the first game on Spike 3, you heard it here first from

[05:15] Canadian Pimball Podcast, might still be the original design. It might not be a brand new design, and it might have new artwork.

[05:23] I really don't know what's going on with this game. I've been hearing from reliable sources that it's an all-new design,

[05:30] and maybe it's just new artwork, so we shall see. I don't think we're gonna see Metallica next though.

[05:35] I think Metallica is now, we're hearing that Metallica might be at the end of the year.

[05:40] So if you own a Metallica, do you want to see the same design with new artwork and upgrade it to Spike 3 with LCD screen?

[05:48] So that would mean everybody who owns a Metallica right now, you should list your game for sale today,

[05:55] if they're gonna recycle your design, but just make it better, because now you're gonna have the one that's not desirable,

[06:01] and it sort of makes sense that Stern would just do that, because this is a Lyman sheets game.

[06:07] The original game is phenomenal. They fell out of love with Dirty Donnie,

[06:12] so why not let Zombieetti make it even better, and

[06:15] Zombieetti's artwork is better than Dirty Donnie's, and then you're gonna have an all-new Metallica.

[06:21] Now it's gonna get interesting, right, when George Gomez said that they're not gonna redo LEs.

[06:26] They're not gonna burn the old LE owners.

[06:29] So how are you gonna re-release Metallica, George, and not have an LE version if it's an all-new artistic game,

[06:36] if it's the same design with different artwork, is that not burning the old LE owners of the game?

[06:43] I don't think George wanted to say that. I don't think that was ever Stern's strategy,

[06:48] but now he's gonna have to hold true to his word, and we know Stern doesn't care about misleading us.

[06:53] They did it with The Walking Dead, and they can do it again.

[06:56] They told everybody the toppers for James Bond's 60th were exclusive to the 60th anniversary of the game,

[07:03] and then they released them for everybody.

[07:05] They also told everybody they were only gonna make 500 of those toppers to sell them out instantly,

[07:10] and now they've made like 2,000 of them, so don't really believe a thing Stern says.

[07:15] All right, so we shall see a lot of exciting stuff starting to brew.

[07:19] A lot of exciting rumors now about what's next from Stern Pimbal,

[07:22] and this is why I keep telling everybody, wait and see is the best approach,

[07:26] because if you wanted a Jaws LE, trust me, you're gonna be able to get one for less than $13,000

[07:33] in a few months when the code is done. There's no point to Russian buy any of these games.

[07:38] Jaws premiums are gonna instantly go down in value, and now we might be getting Indiana Jones,

[07:43] a far more popular theme than freaking Jaws, and I'm just gonna say this, Jaws is not Keith

[07:48] Elwin's greatest design. It's not that spectacular to shoot. It's okay. It's not a bad game.

[07:54] It's not a bad game, but there's nothing in Jaws that is a wow, and I'm sorry, but at these

[08:00] prices people, every game should be a wow, and I just don't see it. So speaking of wow, let's

[08:05] real quickly talk about Looney Tunes. I was watching the spooky stream bug finally shut up,

[08:10] and just let us hear the game, and it was a really good stream. He did almost an hour of gameplay,

[08:16] and I will say this. Look, I keep making jokes. If you're a grown man, how can you be into Looney

[08:21] Tunes? But the game looks really good. The game looks really good. Now, does Looney Tunes have

[08:26] the wow? Does it have something that the game does mechanically? That's a wow? I don't think so.

[08:31] It's got a good layout. It looks a lot of fun, but nothing in it is like, oh my gosh, did you see that?

[08:35] Did you see a jump? Did you see a teleport? Did you see the magnet grab the ball? Did you see it

[08:39] disappear? It has a magnet, but nothing in it is making anybody do backflips. But that being said,

[08:45] if you're a fan of Looney Tunes, I think you're going to love the game, and the game looks like

[08:49] it's a lot of fun, and the code in the game looks really awesome. You really are playing through

[08:55] the iconic Looney Tunes episodes you remember and you love, and I think they're doing it right.

[09:01] Like, it's not a mess. I love the way it's like linear. Like, you're going through the episodes,

[09:06] and you're going through the iconic scenes in each episode, and I think it's perfectly presented in

[09:11] pinball form. I would like to see more of that in Jaws. I don't feel that way when I watch a Jaws

[09:16] stream. It's just jumping all over the place. I don't feel like I'm starting from the beginning

[09:21] of the movie and culminating in the end and killing the shark. It just doesn't feel that way at all.

[09:26] It's all over the place, and I don't understand why people keep making excuses for this approach

[09:31] to pinball. I think it's chaotic. I don't think it's the way Jaws pinball should have been made.

[09:36] All right? What do I know about making games? Not much. What do I know about podcasting? The world's

[09:40] greatest pinball podcast. You're getting Canada on a Friday for the discounted price most of you at

[09:45] $5 a month. You know you should be paying more. You know you want to double up to $10 a month,

[09:50] and maybe even $30 a month, and join the Omokase Club. Let's go get some Omokase people. All

[09:55] right, so spooky pinball. Really nice loony tunes. I don't really care about Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[10:00] but if you're a fan of that movie, knock yourself out and go buy one. I would never buy both. I

[10:05] think that's pretty idiotic. All right, so what's next happening in the world of pinball? So David

[10:09] Fix is going around and confirming for people that the next game is a BBQ game. It is a barbecue

[10:16] game, and it's going to be Barrio. I heard it even might be single level, and I'm just going to say

[10:21] this right now. If David Fix thinks in this current pinball market where we know that Matrix is coming,

[10:27] Pulp Fiction is out there. We know Back to the Future is coming. Harry Potter is coming. Jaws is

[10:33] out there. Indiana Jones is around the corner. If he thinks he's going to march out with a Barrio

[10:38] designed barbecue game and have any sales success, he's a fool. And I don't understand how this guy

[10:45] is making these decisions. And you know what he's telling people? He thinks that all the barbecue

[10:50] restaurants in America are going to buy this. I'm telling you right now, David Fix, they are not.

[10:58] They are not going to buy this game. It's the same way they thought. Everyone who collects hot wheels

[11:03] is going to buy hot wheels. No, they're not. People that collect Star Wars toys are not going

[11:08] to just buy Star Wars pinball. It doesn't work like that. You need to make something that the pinball

[11:14] buying community wants. If you go into a room as a pinball company leader, and you're like our next

[11:21] game, our target audience, our barbecue restaurants in America, you should be fired. You should be

[11:27] fired. If you think that's going to sell and you think that's what people want, you should not

[11:33] have a job in pinball making decisions and playing with millions of dollars of other people's money.

[11:39] And that's where you're investing your time and your energy and you're making games like that.

[11:45] When Pulp Fiction is out, they're not going to pay for your brisket and barbecue chicken

[11:49] Barrio game, David Fix. I don't understand. I can't wait to see this game at TPF. If it is a

[11:56] barbecue game, it's going to be the laughing stock of the pinball world. Trust me, that's what it's

[12:00] going to be. All right, speaking of laughing stock, do you know Damien was asking people in January

[12:06] to pay in full for Centaur? What a joke to pay in full for a game. And then the next week,

[12:11] he's recapitalizing. I don't understand. I know you guys don't want me to talk about Haggis and

[12:16] I'm not, you know me. I think American pinball and Haggis, they're like overcooked barbecue.

[12:22] Stick a fork in both of them because I think they might be done in 2024. I don't see a way forward

[12:28] for either of these companies with all the exciting stuff happening by companies that are

[12:32] executing so much better with such better themes. All right, let's go on to Chicago Gaming Company.

[12:39] I'm hearing that Ryan White is no longer associated with CGC. I don't have total confirmation,

[12:45] but I heard it from a birdie that Ryan White is no longer over there. Now, are people going to

[12:51] miss him? I don't think so. Like he never really did much. I mean, I've known Ryan personally and

[12:55] every time we talk, we have a good conversation. But man, as a guy that should be out there celebrating

[13:02] CGC and its quality and communicating as the buyers are waiting like a year and a half for their games,

[13:08] they do nothing. They do absolutely nothing. I do more marketing for CGC. I don't even work for them.

[13:16] They have no presence on social media and they haven't built a community around their stellar

[13:21] products. And I'm not surprised that Ryan's no longer over there. So that's not really big news.

[13:26] The big news is this. What's going on with the audio in Pulp Fiction? Because I keep reading

[13:33] that people when they play the game are not happy with the callouts in the game. The callouts are

[13:40] coming across all muffled. And when you crank the volume, they sound even worse. And then we get David

[13:47] Thiel coming in saying, this is one of the best sounding pinball machines he's ever worked on.

[13:51] So who's telling the truth? Who's right and who's wrong? I'm a little bit worried that maybe David

[13:57] is talking about the music, but the callouts, if they're lifted from the movie, they might be a

[14:03] little bit distorted sounding. So I don't know, but this is just something to look out for. If you

[14:09] get a chance to play Pulp Fiction or you have one, can you please crank it up and come to my Facebook

[14:15] page or hit me up on the Patreon chat and let us know what the callouts sound like. This shouldn't

[14:22] be something where there's uncertainty. Either they sound good or they don't. Who's lying? I played

[14:28] it at Texas Pinball Festival and I did notice that the callouts did sound like crap. I didn't want to

[14:34] say anything. It was a loud show. I didn't know if that's why the game was sounding so poorly,

[14:39] but something about it didn't sound right. When you go over like in Elton John, it sounds amazing.

[14:45] When you go over to Jaws, it sounds amazing. The callouts and Jaws sound incredible. And then when

[14:50] you play Pulp Fiction, it sounds tinny. It sounds like this metallic distorted sort of voices, and

[14:56] it doesn't sound good. So we'll see what happens. I mean, we should have an answer on this by this

[15:01] weekend because the games are out in the wild. All right, what else is going on in the world of

[15:06] pinball? We got people stealing IP and selling dust covers for pinball machines, stealing the artwork

[15:13] of Christopher Franci and Zombie Yeti, and selling you $50 dust covers. It's a blanket. Oh, you know,

[15:20] look, I don't want to get into this because people always accuse me of stealing the Canadian IP.

[15:25] I'm just going to say this. There's so much happening in the world of modding and dust covers,

[15:31] and I think everybody needs to sort of like simmer down in this area. Like there's way too many mods.

[15:38] Everyone is starting to glue tacky stuff to their games. Don't do it. Trust me. Don't do it. A mod should

[15:45] simply enhance something that the company put into the game. And I understand people want to mod stuff

[15:51] like that. For example, in Jaws Pro, right, that Jaws is just there in the middle of the game. And

[15:57] people are doing mods where Jaws is breaking through a shark cage. They're just making that Jaws figure

[16:03] look better. People did the same thing with Godzilla. If you take like the flat plastic and you make a

[16:08] sign that's more sculpted and you're making that piece better, I don't have a problem with that.

[16:14] I think where it gets stupid is when people start gluing like stuff all over the games that weren't

[16:20] in the game. That does not make it a world under glass. Like this is not a diorama, people. This

[16:25] isn't a middle school art project. It's an expensive pinball machine. And so that's where I think people

[16:31] go overboard. And I see people doing it with Jaws already. They're like gluing signs and they're

[16:36] gluing shark towers and all this stuff all over the game. And people did the same thing with

[16:41] Godzilla. They started putting like electrical wires and all these things. And then you look down at

[16:45] the game and you're blocking half of the ball paths in the game. And I know some of you are like,

[16:50] Kaneda, why do you care what people do with their machines? Well, where you have been? I've spent

[16:55] the last 10 years of my life telling you that I care about what you do with your money and what

[17:00] you do with your machines. And if I were you people, I would hold on to that money and make some

[17:06] purchases at the end of the year. A little back to the future news for everybody. We don't talk

[17:11] about it too much. There's probably going to be three versions of back to the future. There will

[17:16] be an SLE, an LE, and a standard edition. And I hear the standard edition is most likely going to be

[17:23] unlimited. So, you know, Dutch pinballs got this juggernaut license and they will be making it for

[17:29] the rest of their lives in standard format. And there will be a tremendous race to get some of

[17:35] those 88 super limited edition games. And as I've said before, Chris Coloris, the controversial

[17:43] figure from Kaneda's Pinball podcast, will be offering up some of those exclusive games,

[17:50] exclusively to his club members, to his controversial club members. So you heard it here first. I'm

[17:57] also going to be able to get you guys in on the super rare version of Alice in Wonderland. So,

[18:03] if you ever wondered why you were a club member to the super controversial Chris Coloris from

[18:08] Kaneda's Pinball podcast, now you know why. I feel like I'm almost like a distributor now. I'm not

[18:14] getting any cut. I'm not getting any kickbacks. And we're going to have some fun and we're going to

[18:18] have a good sort of party with CoinTaker, Barry, and Kaneda. It's going to be amazing. We're going

[18:23] to be popping bottles of Cristal when those two games come out. Alright, anything else happening

[18:27] in the world of Pinball on this Friday? We've got the Princess Bride stream tomorrow. Is this game

[18:34] selling? Are more people going to buy it now that you know about Indiana Jones? Are you going to write

[18:39] a check for $13,750? See, Jerry made a mistake with the collector's edition. No one's buying that one.

[18:47] Nobody's buying it. And he should have made it a kit that you could buy if you were an original

[18:53] P3 owner. And it's not too late, Jerry. But here's the thing, Jerry. It's kind of embarrassing

[18:58] that everyone's buying the middle tier. They're buying the LE. And you know, that doesn't make

[19:03] any sense. Like you've got to make collector's editions that creme de la creme version of your

[19:07] machine should be the one that everybody wants. I don't know. Maybe everybody's looking at it

[19:12] like, I don't know, it's not worth $1,000 more for two plastic swords and some bronzed armor.

[19:18] It's also ironic that Jerry is now making a dedicated cabinet for a game like the Princess

[19:25] Bride because that goes against his whole philosophy that the cabinets are not supposed to be

[19:30] permanently dedicated to any one theme. But that's the problem with the Princess Bride collector's

[19:36] edition. So I can't wait to see this game tomorrow. Buffalo Pinball is going to stream it. I'm not

[19:42] sure what time they're going to stream it. But you best believe I will be watching it tomorrow

[19:47] with a glass of whiskey in hand. Everybody have a great Friday. Lots of exciting stuff happening

[19:53] in Pinball. Just when we thought there was no Pinball news, here we go. And we're covering the

[19:58] news people as it happens. You know, you can't wait a week or two to do a podcast in Pinball

[20:03] because by the time you're talking about Haggis, we already talked about Haggis and they've already

[20:08] failed at recapitalizing. You know, we're on to the next. Like that's old news. Like we're hitting

[20:12] it when it happens, everybody. This is the best five to 10 to $30 to $100 a month you can spend

[20:18] in Pinball. Canada out. Some people call me Maurice.
