[00:00] Come on, come on, now, before the money.

[00:03] Come on, come on, listen to the money.

[00:07] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:11] Uh, welcome everybody to Canade is Pinball Podcast.

[00:14] We'll see how this show sounds.

[00:16] I'm on my old computer.

[00:17] I left my computer in Queens.

[00:20] I was working out there on something today, but I wanted to get a show up today.

[00:26] We're gonna talk about Stern Star Wars Fall of the Empire at the Rocky Mountain Pinball Expo.

[00:34] And now we are getting on the ground in the hands of pinheads.

[00:40] The feedback is rolling in.

[00:43] And just as we all expected, the game is not lighting the pinball world on fire.

[00:50] Now, what does this mean now that Stern Pinball will now have had three games in a row?

[00:56] That have not been really big hits.

[01:00] Dungeons and Dragons was not a huge hit.

[01:03] King Kong was not a huge hit.

[01:05] And now we're getting a very lukewarm response to this Star Wars Fall of the Empire.

[01:11] In fact, I think more people are kind of disappointed in this game than probably even King Kong.

[01:18] Probably even D&D.

[01:20] I think if you're into D&D, you are probably very satisfied with that pinball machine.

[01:25] But Star Wars is different because our expectations of Star Wars is pretty high.

[01:31] And, you know, we've had Star Wars before.

[01:34] So you're kind of like juggling two things happening at once.

[01:38] High expectations with high fatigue.

[01:42] And then you bring out a game that is kind of getting called mediocre at best.

[01:48] A fan layout.

[01:49] Some of the shots are really tight.

[01:51] Some of it are clunky.

[01:53] But the overwhelming feedback as I read people give their reviews is that it's just underwhelming.

[02:00] There's nothing in it that's really magical.

[02:03] And people keep saying it's an operator's dream.

[02:07] But that's not what Stern needed right now.

[02:10] They did not need an operator's dream.

[02:12] They needed a pin that was going to make a lot of us open up our wallets and buy the game.

[02:17] Now I'm starting to get nervous for Stern Pinball.

[02:20] I don't think they've had three strikes in a row like this in a really long time.

[02:26] And what happens now?

[02:28] The Walking Dead remastered in a month at Pinball Expo.

[02:32] Is that going to save the day?

[02:34] Will that game and all of its full Spike 3 glory win us over?

[02:39] I don't think that's going to be the answer.

[02:41] And I think we're going to see a teaser for Beetlejuice at Expo.

[02:45] I think that's going to start to get people very excited.

[02:48] And so I'm getting worried about Stern.

[02:50] I really am.

[02:51] And I think there's this misconception too that is out there in the pinball world

[02:56] that we're rooting for Stern to fail.

[02:58] Nobody wants Stern Pinball to fail.

[03:01] But nobody has done this to Stern other than themselves.

[03:06] And I do think they need a hard reset.

[03:09] You can't come out in 2025 with a Star Wars game

[03:14] that doesn't really have anything wowing people.

[03:18] Stern's wowed us before many, many times.

[03:21] It's almost unfair.

[03:22] It really is almost unfair because they've released so many good games

[03:27] over the last 10 years and almost everybody else has not.

[03:31] The only problem is all those great Stern games came out years ago

[03:37] when the prices were so much better.

[03:39] And now that the prices are where they are at.

[03:43] Sorry, gang.

[03:43] If you hear Cassian crying, I have to do this on my old computer

[03:47] which requires a second monitor because the main monitor on the computer is broken.

[03:52] And so the whole family is downstairs.

[03:54] So if you hear a little bit of crying in the background, it is not your baby.

[03:58] It is mine.

[03:59] And it's not Canada's inner monologue about Star Wars.

[04:03] But they released so many great games years ago when the prices were much better.

[04:10] And now when they really need a hit, when they really need to justify

[04:14] the modern pricing of Pinball, they've built the big factory.

[04:19] They can make hundreds of games a week.

[04:22] They just don't have the bangers.

[04:24] It's really unfortunate.

[04:26] And everybody else in Pinball over the last 10 years

[04:30] hasn't had as many great games as Stern.

[04:33] They've struggled to manufacture.

[04:35] And Stern has carried the entire industry on its back.

[04:40] But now that's no longer the case.

[04:43] They never acquired a single boutique company.

[04:47] In fact, they let every boutique company survive or fail.

[04:52] But now a lot of the boutique Pinball machines are starting to look a lot more attractive.

[04:58] Now look, Stern is not dead.

[05:00] They are not going out of business tomorrow, but they need a hit.

[05:05] And I'm worried that The Walking Dead is going to still fatigue us.

[05:09] I'm worried that Star Wars in general were kind of over at all.

[05:13] I was just watching the Mandalorian movie trailer and I couldn't be less excited for that movie.

[05:21] It just feels like we've had so much of that with Grogu and the Mandalorian.

[05:26] And it just doesn't feel new.

[05:29] It doesn't feel original.

[05:31] And the stuff they're doing, again, it's like old recycled ideas

[05:34] and at-at walking on a snowy cliff falling down.

[05:38] Like that's supposed to make us go, wow, I can't wait to see this.

[05:42] Everything's starting to feel fatigued, especially in the pinball industry right now.

[05:48] And the companies that are really going to get the new and box money

[05:52] are going to be the companies that are thinking a little bit more outside the box,

[05:56] giving us more for our money.

[05:58] And I'm worried that Stern Pinball is the greatest pinball company

[06:03] if the goal is to make thousands of games at a good price.

[06:09] They can't survive at these prices.

[06:11] It's not sustainable.

[06:13] They can't expect to sell at the volume they need to sell.

[06:17] Remember, they need demand to be one more, one more than they can supply every single month.

[06:26] And when you're making games like Star Wars, that is not the case.

[06:30] Spooky Pinball only needs there to be a thousand people who want a Beetlejuice

[06:36] and they're doing just fine.

[06:38] Barrels of fun, same thing with like Dune.

[06:40] They need what? Like 801 people to want one.

[06:43] Same thing with everybody else out there.

[06:45] You need one more than you can supply.

[06:48] The problem now for Stern is, no matter what the title is,

[06:52] if it's a cornerstone, they need thousands of people to want it

[06:57] and to want to buy it new and box.

[07:00] And if you're looking at the way things are going,

[07:02] Star Wars will be another game in which in just a couple months,

[07:07] not even six months, in a couple months, it's a $10,000 LE.

[07:11] And so that is where we are at.

[07:13] I am looking forward to seeing what their next move is,

[07:17] but I do think they have to be in somewhat of a panic mode

[07:22] because this is not it.

[07:24] So speaking of panic modes, I know I said that there is a possibility.

[07:28] And again, none of this, none of this is confirmed,

[07:31] but there is a possibility that we are not going to see Big Bang Bar

[07:35] at Pinball Expo.

[07:36] Now, it was never confirmed it was going to be there,

[07:39] but the latest I'm hearing and I said it on my live,

[07:42] I'm hearing that who knows now?

[07:44] Because you remember, you got to remember,

[07:46] Pinball Brothers and Padrety Gaming,

[07:49] they are united in that European Pinball Company,

[07:52] whatever they call it.

[07:54] And both companies recently haven't had much success

[07:59] and there is no way that these companies can absorb,

[08:03] they can't absorb the low volume of demand for Funhouse

[08:07] and the extraordinarily low demand for Predator.

[08:10] They could not even sell 300 Predators.

[08:13] And now with the tariffs in place,

[08:16] they're going to have a really hard time selling anything.

[08:19] Now, Big Bang Bar is the next game.

[08:21] I've been looking at pictures of it.

[08:23] I've seen video of it,

[08:25] but now if you're a Rikid Planetary,

[08:28] you don't really know what the state is.

[08:30] Like, can they afford to make this game if Predator is a flop?

[08:35] And I know it's not a Pinball Brothers game,

[08:37] but I'm sure both of these companies' finances

[08:40] are somewhat intertwined to keep that factory going

[08:44] because isn't it the factory in Italy, right?

[08:46] They both kind of have like a joint deal to make games.

[08:50] But now with where the tariffs are at,

[08:53] it seems to make a lot more sense

[08:55] to maybe have Chicago Gaming Company make these games

[08:59] and not Padready and not the facility over there in Italy.

[09:03] So it's about to get really, really weird in Pinball.

[09:07] There's a few companies that are doing great right now.

[09:09] They're in the driver's seat.

[09:11] Jersey Jack is one of them.

[09:12] I think Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be great.

[09:15] I think it's going to be one of Steve Richie's

[09:17] most fun pins ever.

[09:19] And I think it's going to look phenomenal on their platform.

[09:22] I think Stern Pinball is in big trouble.

[09:25] And I'm starting to feel like they don't even have Pokemon.

[09:27] And I think they might be in big, big trouble

[09:31] if the next game out of Stern Pinball

[09:33] is Elliot Isman's Transformers.

[09:37] Again, I love Transformers.

[09:39] Nobody loves Transformers more than me,

[09:41] but the mistake they're going to make with Transformers

[09:43] is you don't want to make the TV show.

[09:46] It's not as good as making G1 Transformers the movie.

[09:50] I'm not sure they're going to even go down that road

[09:53] because the movie would probably be more expensive to do

[09:56] because you have to license the music from Stan Bush,

[10:00] but you want all that music.

[10:01] You want dare.

[10:03] You want you got the touch.

[10:04] You want the weird Al song dare to be stupid.

[10:07] You want all that instruments of destruction.

[10:09] It's so much better.

[10:11] Can you imagine when you open the matrix of leadership

[10:15] and that's the topper, a rise, Rodimus Prime,

[10:18] and you got the touch plays?

[10:20] It's just better.

[10:21] If you do the TV show, it's just so broad.

[10:25] It's not as focused.

[10:27] And, you know, I want Unicron under that glass.

[10:30] I don't know. I'm nervous.

[10:31] I feel like if Stern does G1 Transformers,

[10:34] it might be a lot like how they did Ninja Turtles

[10:38] and they're going to illustrate it in-house.

[10:40] I'm at the point now where I just don't trust anymore

[10:44] that Stern is going to nail it.

[10:46] They used to kind of always nail it.

[10:49] I feel like they're an organization that needs some new blood,

[10:53] more new blood.

[10:54] I feel like they're an organization that might need new senior,

[10:58] senior leadership to shake it all up and we'll see what happens.

[11:02] I mean, I would hate to be in charge of managing

[11:05] that ginormous company.

[11:07] It's going to be tough and we're almost into October in November.

[11:12] I think we're going to get maybe Beetlejuice at the end of November,

[11:17] early December.

[11:18] It's going to come up really fast.

[11:20] Pinball Expo is in just a couple weeks.

[11:23] It's in like three weeks.

[11:25] I am confirmed.

[11:26] I have booked my travel.

[11:28] I'm going to Expo.

[11:30] So if you are going to Expo, get ready to hang out.

[11:33] Most likely we are going to be hanging out Thursday night

[11:37] at the Renaissance and Friday night.

[11:40] I am flying back Saturday at like noon.

[11:43] The show breaks down Saturday night.

[11:45] So if you are only going Saturday,

[11:48] we will most likely miss each other unless you want to get coffee in the morning.

[11:52] But I'm looking forward to going to Pinball Expo.

[11:56] I'm looking forward to an absolute drama free time with everybody.

[12:00] I've unblocked everybody that I blocked like a week and a half ago.

[12:04] I really do feel like everybody was just acting silly

[12:09] and everybody let their emotions get the best of them.

[12:12] And I think everybody would rather just go back to being nice to each other.

[12:19] It's just a better approach for life and for this hobby.

[12:23] Okay.

[12:24] So this is where we're at right now in Pinball.

[12:27] The main thing is going to be how to stern repair what is now three Mrs.

[12:33] in a row, three absolute Mrs.

[12:36] in a row and people are not even holding back man.

[12:38] People are pretty brutal and where the fanboys now right?

[12:42] Where's Neil McRae now?

[12:44] Where are the stern shills?

[12:46] All those people who went to stern.

[12:49] They played this game.

[12:50] You could see it in the video.

[12:51] They just know it's not great and we know that stern is capable of so much more.

[12:59] This company would be better off only doing two cornerstone games a year,

[13:05] but really nailing them, nailing the theme, nailing the magic, only 500.

[13:12] L.E.'s only 500.

[13:14] L.E.'s and stern those 500.

[13:16] L.E.'s need to come exclusively with their own topper and I would also make it.

[13:23] So maybe there's a few exclusive modes in those L.E.'s Allah death punk multi ball.

[13:29] You need to stop stern.

[13:31] We see through it all now.

[13:33] You can't cut corners.

[13:35] You know it's so funny.

[13:36] It's like they cut corners so much that they are using I think the same exact play field

[13:41] on Star Wars Pro as they are on Star Wars premium and L.E.

[13:48] But it doesn't make sense because Yoda does not force grab the ball on the pro machine

[13:55] and yet you still have the artwork there with the ball being force grabbed.

[13:59] You know and it's just like enough enough like your play field on your 13,000.

[14:05] $6,000 game should be nicer than your play field on your $6,000 game,

[14:10] but they don't want to make those changes and everybody else out there in the pinball world.

[14:15] It's all about the details.

[14:17] It's all about the little reasons why you want to buy that version of the game.

[14:23] It's just confusing to me why stern pinball seems unable to make any sort of move that really shows us.

[14:30] They're listening and what we're telling them is our money is talking.

[14:35] The lack of us spending money on your recent offerings stern is us telling you.

[14:42] It's not that we want you to go out of business, but you need to listen to us more.

[14:47] You need to put something in front of us that's much more compelling and this is just not it.

[14:53] You know, go into expo.

[14:55] I don't even know what I'm really excited to play now.

[14:58] What are the exciting games?

[14:59] Star Wars is clearly not that exciting.

[15:02] I can't wait to play Dune on the latest code.

[15:05] We're not going to see Beetlejuice.

[15:07] We're not going to see Raza.

[15:09] I guess Predator.

[15:10] I'm somewhat curious to play that machine, but no real surprises.

[15:15] So once again, we're like, this is going to be the greatest pinball expo of all time.

[15:21] And then you step back and you think about it.

[15:23] Is it like, is anyone going to make a surprise?

[15:25] Do we think Dutch pinball might tease back to the future?

[15:29] Just to get us excited, just to get people clapping.

[15:32] I don't know.

[15:33] Look, the floor is open for someone to march in there and surprise us.

[15:37] Remember when like Barry did that like 12 years ago?

[15:41] Nobody knew who Dutch pinball was and he rolls in with Lebowski.

[15:45] I feel a little bit like sorry that no one's able to do that.

[15:49] Like 12 years later, pinball brothers couldn't march in with a new game.

[15:54] That's going to blow us away.

[15:55] No, they make Predator without Arnold.

[15:58] Or another company just wants to remake Big Bang Bar, a game that's like 30 years old.

[16:04] Like nobody's got an original idea.

[16:06] And I don't mean like an original IP.

[16:08] I mean, go get a movie from the 80s that we really want and make the pinball version of it and then roll into the show and drop the mic.

[16:20] I just wish we would see more of that in this hobby.

[16:23] At these prices, we all just want more.

[16:25] That's it.

[16:26] You're spending more money.

[16:27] You should get more.

[16:28] And I think that's where a lot of us are out.

[16:30] You're just like happy with games that you bought years ago that are just so much better.

[16:35] I was thinking about Ghostbusters.

[16:36] Why is Stern not remaking Ghostbusters right now?

[16:40] Like look down at that game.

[16:42] Look at everything that's in it.

[16:44] It's so much more creative than Star Wars.

[16:47] It's so much cooler than Star Wars.

[16:49] And I understand it would cost them money to go like renew the license and get the clips, but go do it, Stern.

[16:57] Your bomb is still around four to $5,000.

[17:00] Okay, you could do this on Ghostbusters and sell like a $15,000 Ghostbusters.

[17:06] We would spend as much money on Ghostbusters if it had everything we wanted in it.

[17:12] The same way people are spending $15,000 on Harry Potter and not even blinking because Ghostbusters has way more mechanical magic in it than Harry Potter.

[17:23] It just doesn't shoot as well, not even nearly as well.

[17:27] And you'd have to fix some of the geometry issues and fix the big gap down the middle.

[17:32] But man, the rest of it is pretty damn cool.

[17:36] And I would actually find a way to use stronger magnets in the slingshot so you could really use those magnets.

[17:42] It should have felt like the ghosts were passing the ball back and forth to each other.

[17:47] It's not really done the best possible way.

[17:50] But now you've got Spike 3.

[17:52] So can you supercharge Ghostbusters somehow and add even more magic?

[17:57] And so here's what I'm going to tell you right now.

[17:59] I heard that Walking Dead, there's nothing added to it.

[18:02] There's nothing added mechanically to it.

[18:04] Like Spike 3 is not going to make the game even better.

[18:07] They're just going to change the scopes and probably add more lighting.

[18:11] And then we'll see what's up on the screen, whether it's like comic book or show footage.

[18:15] I mean, knowing Stern lately, I think they're just going to animate what was on the DMD screen.

[18:21] I don't think you're going to see show clips.

[18:23] Remember, this is Stern.

[18:24] When was the last time they actually exceeded our expectations?

[18:29] Everybody, I love you.

[18:31] Happy Monday on this old technology I'm recording on.

[18:34] If it doesn't sound as good or if it's clipping, it's because it's my old computer.

[18:38] It's even the old version of Audacity.

[18:41] I want to commend each and every one of you for not running in on this game, New and Box.

[18:46] Like almost nobody I know bought it.

[18:47] And it's going to send a message and they're either going to make games more magical

[18:51] or bring the prices down.

[18:53] There's no other way out for Stern Pinball.

[18:55] All right, everybody.

[18:56] Happy Monday, Canadian Out.
