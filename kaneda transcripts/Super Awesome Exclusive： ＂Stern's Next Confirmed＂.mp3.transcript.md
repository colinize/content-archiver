[00:00] and sampling the best.

[00:02] Better than all the rest.

[00:07] Better than it's in the warm.

[00:12] And it won't let the mess.

[00:16] All right, welcome to a super awesome exclusive update on

[00:28] Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:30] See, this is how you win the Twippy.

[00:32] You don't go away.

[00:34] You don't go into hiding.

[00:36] You actually continue to talk to the pinball community.

[00:38] So here's how we're going to do it.

[00:40] So here are two updates on Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:42] So the first update is this.

[00:44] CoinTaker has received a fully functioning new inbox

[00:48] alien pinball machine from the pinball brothers.

[00:52] Now here's the funny part.

[00:54] CoinTaker is on vacation for a week.

[00:56] And they are not going to unbox that game for an entire week.

[01:00] Now I hope they cut some holes in that box.

[01:04] Because part of me feels like there's not an alien game inside that box.

[01:08] It's actually Andrew Highway trying to sneak himself into America.

[01:12] But that is the rumor that CoinTaker has a fully functioning alien machine.

[01:18] And we should see it in their showroom within a week.

[01:22] So on my last episode, I talked about 2021.

[01:26] And what was going to happen at Stern Pinball.

[01:28] Now I have more clarity on this.

[01:30] And this is what happens when Canada puts stuff out into the world.

[01:34] People hit me up and they correct me on things.

[01:38] And here's what I'm hearing.

[01:40] Okay, are you ready for it?

[01:42] Are you ready for some information that tug-of-war between Zach Sharp and Canada continues?

[01:46] So the next title from Stern Pinball.

[01:50] 100% is confirmed to be a game from Brian Eddie.

[01:56] The other thing I'm hearing is this.

[01:58] This game is 100% confirmed going to be Brian Eddie with Zombie Yeti on the art package.

[02:06] And the other thing I'm hearing is that the theme of this game.

[02:10] And we can figure this out together, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:13] The theme of this game is a contemporary theme.

[02:17] So it's something new-ish that has come out in the world recently.

[02:22] So it's not an 80s title or not a 90s title.

[02:26] So what do you think the contemporary theme that has Brian Eddie and Zombie Yeti about to release a game from Stern Pinball?

[02:35] They gave Brian Eddie the juggernaut in Stranger Things.

[02:39] And here we are once again in which Stern Pinball is giving Brian Eddie a huge content.

[02:46] A huge contemporary theme in Pinball.

[02:49] So I can't wait to see what it is.

[02:51] So here are my guesses.

[02:52] I mean, what's contemporary right now that would make sense for Brian Eddie to make a Pinball machine on?

[02:59] So what about the Mandalorian?

[03:02] What about Cobra Kai Karate Kid?

[03:06] What about, could you consider Mortal Kombat?

[03:09] I don't think it's going to be Mortal Kombat.

[03:11] That's not new. That's not big enough.

[03:13] That's kind of a washed-up property.

[03:15] I mean, the movie coming out is cool, but that's not the kind of thing that's going to sell a lot of units.

[03:20] I don't think they're going to give Brian Eddie something like Mortal Kombat.

[03:24] The Mandalorian would be incredible.

[03:26] So let me know what you think Brian Eddie's machine is going to be.

[03:30] But that's what's going to happen in the next few weeks.

[03:33] Brian Eddie, Zombie Yeti, and a contemporary theme in Pinball.

[03:39] And then the other thing I'm hearing is this.

[03:41] That this summer game, the summer game is possibly going to be John Borg's next title.

[03:47] And then we're going to get to Keith Ellwyn.

[03:51] And I have 100% confirmation.

[03:55] And I say 100%, but maybe 99%.

[03:58] Confirmation that Keith Ellwyn is working on Godzilla.

[04:03] Now here's the other part I heard.

[04:05] I heard that Godzilla is going to have mechanisms in it.

[04:10] And Godzilla will contain things that we have not seen in any modern Stern machine.

[04:18] They are giving Keith Ellwyn, Cart launch, to put whatever he wants into this machine.

[04:25] And as I said, this is going to be the Keith Ellwyn machine that becomes the masterpiece.

[04:32] So this game is the one to really, really look out for.

[04:36] But I also heard this.

[04:38] The person who told me what Brian Eddie's next game is, he said, Chris, you're going to want one.

[04:45] So what is the contemporary theme that I would want?

[04:50] I hope it's the Mandalorian.

[04:52] We know Stern has a relationship with Disney.

[04:55] We know it's the biggest thing on TV right now.

[04:59] But it might not be.

[05:00] But what could it be?

[05:01] What could it be?

[05:02] John Wick?

[05:03] No, that doesn't feel big enough.

[05:05] It's not going to be one division.

[05:07] No, that's too recent.

[05:09] What could it be?

[05:10] What's the contemporary Brian Eddie, zombie Eddie machine we're going to get?

[05:16] And man, oh man, they're using zombie Eddie a lot.

[05:19] We're going to get this guy on a lot of Stern stuff.

[05:22] And you know what?

[05:23] I'm happy about that because he's the greatest pinball artist of all time.

[05:28] I just said it.

[05:30] Zombie Eddie is the greatest pinball artist of all time.

[05:34] You know what?

[05:35] He's got the twippies to prove it.

[05:36] I've got a magic girl play field to prove it.

[05:39] And I can't wait to see what this game is.

[05:41] And I hope that Brian Eddie redeems himself because Stranger Things was a total miss.

[05:46] It was.

[05:47] I don't care what Zach Manny and Beasel boobs say.

[05:50] Stranger Things was a total miss.

[05:52] And this game might be Brian Eddie's redemption.

[05:55] Here's the good news.

[05:56] We only have to wait a couple weeks to get it.

[05:59] So you heard it here first.

[06:01] Okay.

[06:02] And the last bit of ridiculous news is this.

[06:05] Brian Allen, the incredibly talented artist, he worked with Andrew Highway again on a new

[06:12] logo for Andrew Highway's latest company.

[06:15] It's called Ice Explosion.

[06:18] Ice Explosion.

[06:19] It's like frozen ice company.

[06:22] And here's the best part about this.

[06:24] Andrew Highway once again has not paid Brian Allen for the work Brian Allen has done.

[06:30] He's stiffing him once again.

[06:33] Brian Allen has been chasing Andrew Highway down for four weeks trying to get paid for the

[06:40] logo he made for Andrew Highway's ironically new business venture.

[06:46] That's about frozen ice.

[06:48] It's amazing how these guys jump from one category to the next from Pimball to like

[06:54] boats to frozen ice.

[06:57] And as Andrew Highway going to learn, you're going to have to be like the rest of us, bro.

[07:02] Get a job.

[07:04] Go in nine to five and earn a living.

[07:07] You're not an entrepreneur.

[07:09] It ain't going to happen.

[07:10] This has been a super awesome, super duper special update by Canadian Spinball podcast.

[07:17] We'll see you all at the twippies in two weeks.

[07:20] And we're going to see.

[07:21] Are we going to go for for four?

[07:23] Because we're still here.

[07:24] We're still on the airwaves.

[07:26] Where's everybody else?

[07:27] Where's everybody else who's supposed to be taking Canadian doubt?

[07:29] Okay, we're here.

[07:31] Come on, Mr. Franchi.

[07:32] Get back on the airwaves.

[07:33] Canada out.
