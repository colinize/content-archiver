[00:00] I just finished watching a documentary that you may have seen called Zero Dreams of Sushi.

[00:21] And if you haven't seen it, I recommend it.

[00:23] I've seen it many times before, but I watched it again tonight with Brenda because we're

[00:27] going to Japan.

[00:29] And it was really inspirational.

[00:32] It was really eye-opening.

[00:34] And I couldn't help but think about applying the principles of Zero Dreams of Sushi to the

[00:40] world of pinball.

[00:42] And I'll make that connection right now on Episode 300, I think, 86 of Canadian pinball

[00:47] podcast.

[00:49] But here's my question for all of you out there.

[00:52] If you've watched the documentary, just to summarize it real quickly, it's about in,

[00:56] I think during the filming, he was 83 years old and he's been making sushi for something

[01:02] like 60-something years of his life.

[01:05] And the whole notion is that when you pick a profession in life, you should do your best

[01:11] to master that skill, to become the best you can possibly be within that category, it

[01:18] went in that skill set and that job.

[01:21] And you should wake up every day and apply yourself to constantly be improving upon what

[01:28] you're doing.

[01:29] So his goal, for example, is to just make the best possible sushi ever, right?

[01:35] And to break the rules and the paradigms down that existed in the sushi category.

[01:41] Now when you think about pinball and we think about where we are today, ask yourself a question,

[01:48] do we feel like there are people in the pinball hobby right now that are designing games and

[01:55] are on a mission to make the best pinball experiences we've ever had?

[02:01] Have they taken what we've learned from the past and are they applying new sets of skills,

[02:07] new passions and are they dreaming about the possibilities of what could be inside a pinball

[02:13] machine?

[02:14] And I just want you guys all just to think about that for a minute.

[02:18] And I think a lot of what happens in this hobby and I know I'm guilty of this and you're

[02:23] guilty of this is we start to look at this hobby in a vacuum of here and now.

[02:29] And we start to look at the options of pinball in the here and the now and we almost have

[02:34] to just accept what is served to us today.

[02:38] And I think that there's an issue I have with that and I think it's starting to chip away

[02:42] a little bit at my ability to enjoy this hobby right now and to get excited about each

[02:49] new pinball release because if I'm really honest and if I'm really honest and I look at

[02:55] pinball not just about what's available today, but if I look at what's been available to

[03:01] the pinball world over the last 20, 30 years, it's hard for me to look at these modern

[03:07] games and really be wowed.

[03:10] And what I mean by that is I don't think I'm seeing pinball at its finest.

[03:16] Do you do you think that we are now seeing the world under glass better now than it ever

[03:22] has been before?

[03:25] And so got me thinking a lot about you know this guy and how he applied his life to making

[03:30] the best possible food on the planet.

[03:33] How could we look at pinball through that lens and let's just do a little journey and keep

[03:39] it very focused on that on this episode of Canatus Pinball podcast.

[03:43] So let's ask ourselves one question.

[03:46] Do you think when you see these modern games, do you think that you see anything in these

[03:51] games from a design and a mechanism standpoint?

[03:55] Does anything feel like it came from the dreams and the imaginations of the designers?

[04:02] Like they woke up one night and they had a new idea of to do something completely never

[04:07] before seen in pinball and then they were able to sketch it out, bring it to the mechanical

[04:12] engineers and they were able to actually put that into the game.

[04:17] Do you think we're getting that level of going from dream to design to execution to the

[04:24] final product?

[04:26] Or do you think what's happening in pinball nowadays is more about designing to a cost

[04:32] and designing to a bomb?

[04:34] You know, there's an interesting part of Giro dreams of sushi in which he says if we're

[04:38] not worried about the money, we are simply focused on making the best possible thing we

[04:44] ever can make.

[04:45] They are somewhat in a pursuit of perfection and obviously it's an arbitrary goal that

[04:51] you can never really reach but they keep aiming for that.

[04:55] And then I thought about pinball and I thought about pinball today and if we were to look

[04:59] at the pinball companies that make up the pinball landscape, which companies out there

[05:04] right now, do you feel are really striving to make the most perfect pinball experience

[05:11] that are constantly pushing the envelope of where we've been before and taking pinball

[05:17] to new heights?

[05:19] When you start to look at it through that lens, it really gets difficult and I know it's

[05:25] very subjective but so is food.

[05:28] Almost everything in which it's for enjoyment's sake, a lot of that stuff is subjective.

[05:35] You know, it's not about the numbers, it's about taste buds and that's why I like this

[05:40] documentary.

[05:41] It's different than having some stupid argument because it is subjective, it all is subjective

[05:46] but I think the lessons that I saw on this documentary tonight, I think they apply nicely

[05:55] to the world of pinball because you know, I just get this sense lately that most of us

[06:00] out there who love pinball and are super excited about each new pinball launch, we really

[06:07] start to dream and imagine what a new game could be like, what will the possibilities hold

[06:13] for us when a new pinball machine is revealed and then reveal happens and I think all of us

[06:19] and again, I could be wrong but maybe I'm just speaking from my own point of view, I think

[06:24] our expectations of what we expect in these modern machines have been lowered so much over

[06:32] the years that we're not really even looking for a lot of magic under the glass anymore,

[06:39] that we've stopped expecting that, that we've stopped expecting a designer to put something

[06:45] in the game that is going to make that ball do something magical and maybe I'm just saying

[06:51] that because tonight I saw the Jurassic Park stream and I get the game shoots well on everything

[06:57] but then I just ask a very simple question, well what is being done in this game that

[07:03] hasn't really been done before and what magical thing is happening in the game that sort

[07:09] of feels like, oh you know, Keith woke up at night and had this idea and they spent

[07:14] an entire year figuring out how to make it work, right?

[07:18] I mean in Jiro, the guy spends, they make them spend 10 years before they can even move

[07:23] on to making their rice like something silly like that and I know we're not, I'm not expecting

[07:28] people to spend 10 years learning how to make pinball machines before you actually get

[07:33] to make a pinball machine but there's something to be said about studying something for a

[07:39] very long time before you're ready to be in the big leagues and to be making something

[07:45] that people are spending so much money on and pinball to me is a little bit stuck, right?

[07:50] And I think it's stuck because we have designers from so many years ago who have been designing

[07:55] games for a very long time but I also think when you look at all those designers, the best

[08:01] mechanisms, the best designs, the best games they've made are usually in their past that

[08:08] they're not making machines nowadays that eclipse what they've done before and so it begs

[08:15] the question are they done?

[08:17] Have they lost the passion?

[08:19] Somewhere along the line have they been told that they have to design games to a certain

[08:23] price?

[08:24] You got to look no further than Willy Wonka, right?

[08:27] When I look at Willy Wonka, do you see stuff in that game that makes it feel like Pat

[08:33] Lawler dreamed this thing up and he worked day and night for a year to make it happen, right?

[08:40] What mechanism do you see in Willy Wonka that feels like it's the extension of a dream

[08:45] of a guy who's a pinball wizard, right?

[08:49] Who's a fanatic who's so passionate about pinball that he's constantly pushing the envelope?

[08:55] There's a gobb stopper mechanism that spins around and just opens up a scoop and there's

[09:01] a wonka vision, but there's really nothing else, right?

[09:04] If you really start to break it down, there's nothing in that game that feels like it's

[09:09] sort of the wild imagination of a guy that's been making pinball machine for so many years.

[09:15] We start to see more of the passion in the new designers, right?

[09:18] The hungry youth of pinball today and I think that's why there's a lot more excitement

[09:24] with guys like Eric and Scott Dinesi, but I think all of them are running into a problem

[09:29] and I think that problem simply becomes, I don't think the goal of any pinball company

[09:35] in 2018, 2019 is to make the best possible pinball machine and the most magical machine

[09:43] ever.

[09:44] I don't think that's the goal.

[09:46] I think for a lot of these companies, the goal is one thing we have to make a profit,

[09:52] which is obviously important.

[09:55] But again, when you watch the documentary and you look at how they make this food and

[10:01] they charge people $300 for sometimes a meal that only lasts 15 minutes.

[10:08] You then ask yourselves, well, how can you charge so much money for such an abbreviated

[10:13] experience eating food?

[10:15] It's because it's so good.

[10:17] And then you look at pinball and you look at the way the pinball world is structured right

[10:21] now.

[10:22] And the games are costing between $5,000 and $12,500.

[10:27] And here's the kicker.

[10:29] They are going to cost that much money regardless of how good they are, regardless of how much

[10:35] is in those games, regardless of the amount of magic, regardless of the amount of engineering

[10:41] time that went into the games, regardless of any of that, right?

[10:45] There's just a price on it.

[10:47] And for so many years, so many people have just been running to buy these games, running

[10:53] to buy every LE.

[10:54] You all, you've seen it.

[10:55] I mean, when I first got into this hobby, there were so many collectors that would just

[11:00] go run and buy every new game that came out.

[11:03] Not even just the LE guys, but guys that would just buy every new game because they wanted

[11:10] to experience pinball and they loved pinball.

[11:13] But do you feel, when you look at these companies, do you feel like there is constant improvement,

[11:19] like the games are getting better?

[11:21] Now, you could argue, and I would say that this might be true.

[11:25] You could argue that each company respectively has been improving what they do, and that

[11:30] is true.

[11:31] But somewhere along the line, somewhere along the line, I think we're things, you know,

[11:36] what's unfortunate, what's unfortunate is that the dominant company, the company making

[11:42] the most money, was starting so far back in terms of like Stern pinball.

[11:47] I mean, they were making games very, very basic and they were making games.

[11:52] You know, I mean, some of them, there were some, there were some games that were an exception

[11:57] to the rule, but you have to look at Stern games and look at the mechanical engineering

[12:01] around them.

[12:02] And it wasn't anywhere close to what we were getting in the 90s with pinball, you know,

[12:08] and then, you know, we went through a whole thing where it was all about the artwork, but

[12:12] then they start to take more and more out of the games.

[12:15] You know, you look at a game like Lord of the Rings, it has more mechanically in it, much

[12:19] more magic on a mechanical level in that game than any modern Stern pinball I'm seeing

[12:25] right now.

[12:26] But, you know, the artwork was crap, or the DMD wasn't up to snuff, right?

[12:30] And so now, it's always been about a juggling act.

[12:34] And I think they're right now, if I'm looking at Stern's approach, it's, it's win them

[12:40] over with artwork, win them over with themes, and win consumers over with reliability.

[12:46] And that's great.

[12:48] We want the games to be reliable.

[12:50] But do you look at Stern machines?

[12:51] And this is just a question I have on this, this, this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcasts,

[12:55] do you look at these machines?

[12:57] And do you see what looks like the dreams of a designer?

[13:02] Like they dream this up and they made this happen and they made it work.

[13:06] Right, when I look at the Lord of the Rings and I see that ring that George Gomez dreamt

[13:11] up that had the magnets around it and the ball would just float in mid-air and then get

[13:17] sucked through the back of the machine.

[13:20] Name me one Stern mechanism.

[13:23] Name me one in the last five years, ten years that has as much magic as that.

[13:31] Because the T-Rex head in Jurassic Park, does it do the same magic?

[13:34] I don't know, I don't think so.

[13:37] And that's what I'm saying.

[13:38] And I still consider George Gomez to be, I think, the best designer and dreamer in one

[13:42] of them in pinball history.

[13:44] But who's doing it now?

[13:46] You know, if I look at, I think George Gomez is a little bit like Jero, like standing over

[13:50] the apprentices of the industry.

[13:53] But who's doing the stuff now that makes you feel like this is it, right?

[13:58] And the person I thought, you know, and this guy always, always to me, you know, was

[14:03] the dreamer, but couldn't execute was John Papaduke.

[14:07] And if you think about what is the appeal of John Papaduke, how is this guy still around,

[14:11] right?

[14:12] How is he bailed out, like, for the third or fourth time?

[14:15] Why are we still excited to see what John Papaduke has been working on all these years

[14:20] at Deep Root?

[14:21] Isn't the answer so simple and just staring us in the face?

[14:24] Because I do think John Papaduke is the kind of guy that is constantly dreaming up radical

[14:31] new ways to try to put magic into a pinball game.

[14:35] Whether they work or not, I think he is always trying to experiment about what's possible

[14:40] in a machine.

[14:41] Now, we know from his own capabilities, on an engineering level, he's complete failure.

[14:47] I mean, he failed to make anything work in magic, girl.

[14:51] And that game was just an abomination of like eight dreams gone wrong.

[14:56] And that doesn't work either, right?

[14:57] I mean, so much has to be in the execution of a dreamer, it's just wasted talent.

[15:02] You know, and there's another thing too that in Giro that I pulled out of that documentary

[15:07] tonight that applies to pinball and it's basically this, good dreamers that have an idea.

[15:13] They're not great collaborators.

[15:15] I mean, they sort of, you have an idea and you want to work on it and you want to work

[15:19] it through to perfection.

[15:21] Now is that happening in pinball?

[15:24] You know, we hear a lot about like, oh, it should be about everyone collaborating to

[15:27] make a game.

[15:28] I don't really agree with that.

[15:30] I think great pinball will come from a great mind.

[15:33] It will come from a great leader.

[15:34] Now that leader's responsibility is to make sure he's leading his team to bring the entire

[15:41] package together.

[15:42] So a great designer who has an idea for what the magic should be under the glass, that

[15:47] person also needs to design the artist, you know, direct them and where they want the

[15:52] art to go.

[15:53] They need to have a sense of how they want the music to be.

[15:55] They need to have a sense of what's going to be on the screen.

[15:59] You know, they're a conductor and they need to conduct this symphony and orchestrate the

[16:05] game so it all comes together.

[16:08] And I think that's what a lot of people are missing in these games today is just that

[16:12] orchestration.

[16:13] That sense that everything is working together in harmony.

[16:16] You know, a lot of this stuff nowadays in these games, it feels piece together.

[16:20] It feels like, are you over there doing this?

[16:22] You're over there doing that.

[16:24] And then you kind of put it all together and you hope it works out.

[16:27] But very frequently do these games feel like they have the cohesiveness that people experience

[16:33] with some of the greatest machines of all time and like a lot of the games we got in the

[16:37] 90s.

[16:38] And I felt like there was more of like things were connected in those games in a way that

[16:45] I think we're still hoping to get in modern Pimble.

[16:49] And maybe you're thinking, can you, you're crazy.

[16:52] But let's take a company like Jersey Jack.

[16:55] Because if you were to look at the companies that you think are like trying to do the most

[16:58] and trying to push the envelope the most in Pimble, when Jersey Jack showed Wizard of Oz,

[17:05] I mean, that game really felt like, all right.

[17:08] We're going to push now.

[17:09] And Jack always would say like, Waz will be my worst game.

[17:14] And since then, you know, and you look at Waz to where we are now, right?

[17:19] Seven, eight years later, does Willy Wonka look like everything they've learned and then

[17:25] some?

[17:26] No, right?

[17:27] It looks like we're moving backwards.

[17:29] It's like almost like Jersey Jack is sliding back down to be more like a stern and stern

[17:36] and climbing up a little bit to get better and get more of what we want in terms of Pimble

[17:42] magic into the game.

[17:44] But again, I just beg the question, there's so much you can do.

[17:48] Can't you with a steel ball and underneath a glass with a wood play field and all the

[17:55] different types of toys and mechanisms and crazy things?

[17:59] Can't you design more dreaming into this game?

[18:03] Can't Pimble be more than it is now?

[18:05] I guess that's my point.

[18:07] And maybe it's just me.

[18:08] Maybe I'm just like bored.

[18:09] Maybe I'm just like guy that likes to see things, you know, take unexpected turns and I like

[18:13] to see things that blow my mind.

[18:16] I mean, blow my mind.

[18:17] Like just for this much money, for a toy that none of us need, how come there is so little

[18:24] in this toy that makes you go, wow, like, oh my God, did you see that?

[18:30] Did you see that?

[18:31] Do that?

[18:32] Did you see that?

[18:33] Make the ball do that?

[18:34] That ball disappear.

[18:36] Did you see that ball levitate?

[18:37] Did you see, you know, I don't see much of that.

[18:40] I really don't.

[18:41] I really don't.

[18:42] I think we're at the state now where we're starting to cover up these games with hundreds

[18:48] of dollars in mods that are just static mods.

[18:51] Like, and I see Wank and I see all these people just tacking on stuff that do absolutely

[18:58] nothing that interacts with the ball.

[19:01] Absolutely nothing.

[19:03] Only nothing that enhances the gameplay.

[19:06] And I'm wondering why are we here now?

[19:09] Is this where we're at?

[19:10] Is we're just going to stick stuff on and we're going to tack on like 3D printed molds

[19:17] on the games and we're going to pay like 500% premiums on these mods and and and that's

[19:23] what's going to bring the world to life.

[19:26] Why aren't people dreaming about bigger things in these games?

[19:33] Would it require more money to bring bigger ideas in the pinball?

[19:37] Would it require us to find new engineers, mechanical engineers to work with?

[19:43] I think some of it has to be that these companies are simply doing what works.

[19:52] They have a formula and they follow it and they have a bomb and they follow it.

[19:56] And no matter what the theme is, no matter what the ideas of the designer are, I think

[20:03] everything is getting watered down to a cost level.

[20:08] And no matter what you think or what I think or what the designer thinks, I think the

[20:13] accountants are running these companies and the investors are running these companies

[20:18] more than any of us would like to admit and would like to realize.

[20:24] And because of that, you have to somewhat feel like, I don't know, maybe I maybe it's

[20:30] just me, but I kind of feel like the machines aren't progressing beyond a certain point

[20:37] when it comes to the mechanical world under the class.

[20:40] And maybe I'm crazy, maybe I just criss-cross watching a documentary about sushi, but where

[20:46] is it?

[20:47] Where is it?

[20:48] And people are losing their minds and have to love every new thing they see.

[20:52] I mean, Stern can put a black knight mechanism that all it has is an up-down shield and

[20:58] it flail that spins super simple, nothing really complex.

[21:03] And all of a sudden we're getting ready to like praise this stuff as being like, oh my

[21:07] god, mechanisms in games.

[21:10] And we're still looking back at games like the Big Lebowski and wondering, well, why can't

[21:15] we get more stuff like that?

[21:16] A lower play field, an upper play field, a bowling alley return lane.

[21:22] I mean, all this cool stuff in the game, but why can't we get more?

[21:29] Am I being selfish?

[21:30] Should I just like shut up and just buy what's available?

[21:34] Because right now, I look at the pinball landscape and I just don't want to buy any of these

[21:42] games.

[21:43] I feel like nothing makes me want to move Batman out.

[21:48] Nothing makes me want to own a bigger home to have more machines.

[21:51] Nothing makes me want to have like 15 of these machines in my home.

[21:56] Nothing makes me want to take $10,000 and go buy a pinball machine right now.

[22:02] Nothing.

[22:03] Am I crazy?

[22:04] Am I not seeing what you're saying?

[22:08] Do I need to take a break?

[22:10] Am I lost my ability to enjoy the hobby?

[22:13] I don't think so.

[22:14] I don't think so.

[22:15] I just don't know what the new standard is in pinball if that's fair.

[22:21] I think a lot of people praise some of these new games so much more than they really deserve

[22:28] because maybe they like the designer or maybe they like the company and so much of the praise

[22:34] is coming from the inner circle of pinball people that know the people who made the game

[22:40] or so much of the pinball reviews and streams are coming from the podcasters or the

[22:45] distributors that have media channels within pinball and so you know I get it.

[22:50] It's like if you're going to think inordinately amounts about pinball on a daily basis, it's

[22:56] healthier to always be positive and always say nice things but at some point don't you reach

[23:02] a point where you want to see these companies do the unexpected.

[23:06] Don't you want to see a game that comes out that truly disrupts the category?

[23:11] Don't you want to see the pinball do something magical that hasn't been done before?

[23:16] Don't you want to see a mechanism where you look at it and you say wow how did they engineer

[23:21] that?

[23:22] You know where are these things?

[23:26] And that's all I'm saying is when I watch this documentary and I see this guy spending

[23:32] decades to constantly be improving what he's doing and then you look at some of these pinball

[23:38] companies and they have years and years and years I just don't feel like every new thing

[23:46] feels like it's getting better or it's improving upon the past and I know that's hard it's

[23:53] a hard criticism to make and I know that I should just be happy that pinball is out there

[23:59] and around and we should celebrate every new game coming out but that's where I'm at.

[24:05] You know that's where I'm at I just want to see something that really blows me away

[24:09] like what blows you away really what blows you away in pinball right now we look at graphics

[24:16] on the LCD screen that are not even as good as like video games from 10 years ago but

[24:21] then we're not allowed to say that we're not allowed to say that it's not as good as

[24:24] something I've been enjoying for over 10 years.

[24:28] Then we're not allowed to look at the mechanisms and say well these aren't nearly as impressive

[24:32] as mechanisms from 20 years ago we're not allowed to say that because if we say that

[24:37] then we're discrediting these companies that are keeping pinball alive.

[24:43] You know for the most part for the most part yes the code has been the one thing the code

[24:48] has been the thing that is improved dramatically in pinball and I would say the artwork has

[24:53] improved dramatically but man if I want to play something with incredible code I'm going

[24:58] to go play a video game and if I want something that's incredible artwork I'm going to go

[25:03] by art or go see a CGI movie pinball is different pinball is physical and I think somewhere along

[25:11] the line we've lost touch with that that we should be judging these things on how amazing

[25:19] the physical elements of the game are they don't but the companies don't want you to

[25:23] do that they don't they want you to start to adjust your expectations of these machines

[25:29] they want you to look at these games through a different lens you know Pat Lawler wants

[25:34] to convince you that he made Willy Wonka for operators for location play I mean that's

[25:41] just spin another way of saying there's just not that much magical in this game I mean

[25:48] all you have to do is put Willy Wonka next to dialed in and you can see the difference in the

[25:53] amount of stuff he tried to put in each game and that dialed in was his like 10 year in the making

[25:59] opus that just didn't work out because it was an unrelated theme so I just want maybe what I'm

[26:07] asking for maybe what I'm asking for is maybe the non stop cheerleading of every new thing that

[26:12] comes out maybe I'm just asking that every pinball machine shouldn't get an A or a B when it's

[26:17] reviewed maybe I'm I'm asking for engineers to start putting more stuff in the games that have

[26:24] like an oh my god like you like when you grab your friend you you gotta see what this game can do

[26:29] you gotta see what it can do and it doesn't get boring because every time it happens it's still

[26:35] conjures up a smile from your face you know something that just does that and maybe maybe you might

[26:40] be saying Chris you're an idiot it's a game it's just meant to be enjoyed quickly and with over

[26:47] a few beers and maybe every game gets old and maybe that's true and that is true but I just think

[26:54] that in 2019 with the amount of engineering students we have in the world with the amount of

[27:00] engineering knowledge we have with the amount of you know designers who have been designing pinball

[27:05] for so many years that we should be getting much more creative in this industry and the creativity

[27:14] should make us feel like that these these people making these games woke up at night and had an

[27:19] idea that they just had a had a had a make happen and and and I know they're doing it but they're

[27:25] doing it to a cost and they are and that is the number one thing driving this hobby right now

[27:31] and it's also why I'm just bored I don't I'm bored I'm just gonna be honest I'm a little bit

[27:37] bored with all of these things I mean it just feels like it's getting really predictable what's

[27:43] gonna come out from each manufacturer each time and I don't see the wow stuff that I think we're

[27:51] sort of putting on top of some of these new releases maybe it's just me being like 11 o'clock

[27:56] and night and I'm just putting up a pinball podcast but that's just what's on my mind tonight you

[28:01] know I want to see more magic I want to see people innovating more I want to see us as buyers of

[28:08] these expensive machines demand more and I also want the manufacturers out there to know if you

[28:16] push the envelope if you give us more if you reach higher the money will be there you shouldn't

[28:25] worry about the bomb you should worry about making a great game and you should worry about

[28:32] making something happen in that game that's truly incredible and awesome and really push the

[28:36] envelope in pinball and and I know it's hard it must be hard I mean I mean it must be hard to

[28:42] stand over games like October Fest or P3 and how do you not stand over those games if you're the

[28:48] creators of those games and maybe those are the dreams of those designers and that's the best

[28:53] they could do with what they had to work with but you know I'm just waiting for that game to come

[28:59] out that that just it just it just it takes my breath away and it makes me feel like wow like I

[29:08] couldn't I couldn't even have imagined they could have made that work and that's a kind of stuff

[29:13] I'm hoping we can see in pinball moving forward I hope newer companies can start to bring that I

[29:19] hope Stern can start to mechanically engineer a little bit more magic back into these games because

[29:24] I think they have everything else starting to click and I and I hope Jersey Jack does not start to

[29:31] sink back down into making the games simpler for operators you know with the short ball times I

[29:38] just everything I hear around the strategy lately has me worried I don't want that I don't want

[29:44] that I want them to say like we made this game because this is like this is the dream come true

[29:50] you know and don't tell me this is like the most innovative thing that can possibly be in a pinball

[29:55] machine no it's not no it's not the limits we're not even near the limits of what you can put in

[30:01] pinball machines I know it's easy for me to say that as a podcast or not a designer but

[30:06] you have to look no further than than what's going on in other areas of entertainment and all the

[30:12] amazing toys that are out there and the things that you know the things that you can physically do

[30:16] with engine I mean there's the reason why I'm saying that because so much so many amazing things

[30:22] were done like 25 years ago and now we're seeing such a smaller level of that kind of engineering

[30:28] sort of feats so this has been it just a weird sort of dump of a podcast on you I don't know if

[30:36] you're going to like it or not I don't even you know but this is what we do this is what we do

[30:40] on Canadian Spinball Podcast we just have a little bit of a thought and we put it out there

[30:45] and that's that's it I think all of us should demand a little bit more than what we're getting

[30:50] from pinball right now and hit me up tell me if you agree or not at canada pinball at gmail.com

[30:56] all right everyone have a great night and go eat some omokaze sushi later
