[00:00] Oh, baby, please, give me respect to you.

[00:11] La Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera, Cera.

[00:16] Welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:19] I want to start out today's show by telling you I'm never going to raise the price of

[00:22] this show.

[00:23] I'm not going to change the price from $5 to $10.

[00:27] I'm not going to get greedy.

[00:28] I know what this show is worth, and I think you get more than your money's worth, and

[00:32] that's why we have so many people here every single week.

[00:35] And then I'm looking at this Foo Fighters topper, and I'm saying to myself, wait a minute, how

[00:39] come when the Black Knight topper came out?

[00:42] It was like $500, and now they re-release the Black Knight topper at $1,500, and now

[00:49] we've got the Foo Fighters topper, which is basically the same exact topper as the Black

[00:54] Knight topper.

[00:55] I don't even think it does as much as the Black Knight topper, and all of a sudden it's $2,000.

[01:00] And I just want to say this right now.

[01:02] I'm just exhausted by Stern and their greediness, and the apologist who defend these moves.

[01:08] I don't think many people are defending these moves anymore.

[01:11] It's just gotten to the point now where Stern Femball thinks we're all idiots.

[01:16] These are idiot prices.

[01:18] These are idiotic amounts of money to spend on such little things.

[01:23] I encourage everybody to walk through a Walmart, go to a Costco, go to your local toy store,

[01:30] and see what you can get for like $500 if you want to buy your kid a toy.

[01:35] See all the flashing lights, the movement, the Xbox, the PlayStation 5 you can get.

[01:40] You could get stuff for $100 in a toy store.

[01:43] That's doing what these things are doing on top of these Stern machines.

[01:47] And I don't even know what makes me more upset.

[01:49] Is it the $2,000 topper?

[01:51] I'm not really that upset about it by the way, because all this is doing,

[01:55] and I think it's doing it to a lot of you, it's just making it easier to not support a company like Stern Femball.

[02:02] $2,000 for this topper.

[02:05] And then I look at this shooter knob, a freaking knob people.

[02:09] This is just plastic made from a mold.

[02:12] The second you make one, you can make $10,000 easily.

[02:16] And they want to charge you $225, almost half the price of an Xbox for a shooter knob.

[02:26] And you have to ask yourselves at what point are they just telling us we're idiots and we're fools and we will buy anything.

[02:34] So much of this is coming from Seth Davis, the new CEO over at Stern Femball.

[02:39] It's like they watched everything happening during COVID.

[02:42] They watched people going crazy, right?

[02:44] Spending $2,000, $3,000 on Black Knight toppers.

[02:48] And the only reason why we ever had to spend that much on a Black Knight topper, do you know the reason why?

[02:55] Because Stern wouldn't make more.

[02:57] They controlled the supply and there was way more demand than supply.

[03:02] And they took all of that behavior.

[03:04] They watched us acting like idiots, spending like $4,000 on Ghostbuster toppers,

[03:10] which cost them $200 to make in China.

[03:13] They saw all of this behavior and they said, hey, we could get that money for ourselves.

[03:19] Let's not let those people have the money.

[03:21] Let's take it in-house.

[03:22] And so now we have where we're at today.

[03:25] We have Stern Femball charging way more for everything.

[03:28] It's not just toppers.

[03:30] It's not just shooter knobs.

[03:32] It's everything.

[03:33] The fact that you could take a Stern Femball machine that's $13,000 foreign LE

[03:38] and then you add a $2,000 topper and a $224 shooter knob.

[03:44] And now all of a sudden, a Stern Femball machine is more expensive from Stern themselves

[03:51] than a Jersey Jack Femball collector's edition.

[03:54] And if you put those two machines next to each other, put a Foo Fighters next to an Elton John

[04:00] and you're going to tell me the Stern is worth just as much money.

[04:04] Both of these companies are playing in La La Land right now.

[04:07] It's over.

[04:08] Like all of it's over.

[04:10] Like we all know all too well that these things are way overpriced.

[04:15] Nothing is rare.

[04:16] Nothing is scarce.

[04:17] The only way Stern could ever charge $2,000 for a topper is if they announced they were

[04:23] only making like 500 of them or 250.

[04:26] But we don't know how many they're going to make.

[04:28] And you know this, people.

[04:30] How much do you think?

[04:31] Let's ask this question.

[04:32] How much do you think?

[04:34] How much do you think they pay Stern for a $2,000 topper?

[04:38] Remember that.

[04:39] A distributor is getting a cut on every topper sold.

[04:43] Now let me ask you this question.

[04:45] Why should a topper even have to go through a distributor?

[04:48] Why should we have to pay a middleman to get our hands on something that goes inside a

[04:53] tiny little box?

[04:55] It's not like you're going to have a ton of issues with your topper.

[04:58] You're going to need to have like replacement parts sent for your topper.

[05:02] We're basically paying for nothing.

[05:04] We're absolutely paying for nothing.

[05:05] I understand paying a distributor for a game because they can help you out if the game

[05:10] has issues.

[05:11] But we're paying a premium just to have a middleman sell you a topper.

[05:16] Like Stern can't mail us these toppers.

[05:18] Like we couldn't just buy this thing on Amazon for 500 bucks and have it dropped off at our

[05:23] door.

[05:24] And I think everyone's just feeling this fatigue.

[05:26] I don't know.

[05:27] Is it just me?

[05:28] I don't think so.

[05:29] I don't think so.

[05:30] And what's going to happen next?

[05:31] Is it going to be a topper for Jaws a year from now for $2,000?

[05:35] Stern is not reading the room.

[05:37] People are turning away from them.

[05:39] Their business model is not going to last much longer.

[05:43] And it's kind of funny to watch this.

[05:45] And I encourage each and every one of you just wait it out.

[05:48] Like wait and see is the only way to go right now.

[05:51] It's going to make everybody save thousands of dollars and you're not going to have any

[05:55] problems ever getting a Foo Fighters topper or a shooter knob or expression lighting for

[06:01] $500 or side armor for $250, art blades for $99.

[06:07] Think about that for a minute.

[06:09] That's two stickers.

[06:11] Just for two stickers that go on the inside of a Stern Pro for Foo Fighters, you're going

[06:17] to spend $100 for two decals.

[06:22] This must be the highest profit margin on any Stern item ever.

[06:27] It's two stickers at most.

[06:30] This is costing Stern like $10 at most.

[06:34] And they're going to charge you a hundred bucks.

[06:37] Distros are getting a cut on a hundred dollars sticker.

[06:40] I mean, everybody, we need to wake up.

[06:42] We need to wake up.

[06:43] And I know you have woken up and man, this is where we're at with Pimball in 2024.

[06:48] And it's just going to only get worse because I think they're not reading the room.

[06:52] I don't think they care.

[06:54] I think they're going to see how stupid we really are.

[06:57] It's like an insult to the community that Stern has turned Pimball into this.

[07:02] And now there's nowhere else to go.

[07:04] And it's almost like the boutiques probably like this because Stern has raised the ceiling

[07:08] so high.

[07:09] Now, all the boutique companies are charging us like $10,000 or more for their games.

[07:13] Like you add up a spooky Pimball machine, fully loaded.

[07:17] It's almost $12,000.

[07:19] Same thing with barrels of fun.

[07:20] $12,000, $12 here, $12 here, $15 here.

[07:24] At what point does everybody say, what have I done?

[07:28] What have I done?

[07:29] Honey, I just bought five Pimball machines.

[07:30] I didn't realize I just spent $75,000.

[07:33] Heck, what happened to this hobby?

[07:36] I used to buy five machines and it was $25,000.

[07:39] And I'm talking LEDs back in the day.

[07:42] What has gone on in Pimball is absolutely a name and it is ridiculous.

[07:48] And it's just funny to watch.

[07:50] Like it is funny to watch this stuff happen.

[07:52] And so here's the deal.

[07:53] I wouldn't go anywhere near these accessories right now.

[07:57] Even if you love Foo Fighters, just wait because we all know what's going to happen next.

[08:02] These distributors are going to be stockpiling games.

[08:05] They're going to be stockpiling accessories.

[08:07] And I think we all need to send a message to Stern Pimball and all of these distributors

[08:11] that they have to get together and they have to force these companies to lower the prices

[08:16] and stop ripping us off.

[08:19] $225 for a shooter knob.

[08:23] It is gone insane, people.

[08:25] It's just what?

[08:26] Are you getting your money's worth?

[08:28] I mean, it's absolutely bonkers.

[08:30] One shooter knob from Stern Pimball that they can make in a nanosecond.

[08:34] One shooter knob is the price of four years of Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[08:39] Just think about that for a minute.

[08:41] Four years of this podcast and they make that selling one shooter knob.

[08:47] And that's where we're at.

[08:48] Don't even get me started on the freaking Foo Fighters topper.

[08:51] And by the way, people, it's the same exact mechanism as the freaking mechanisms from

[08:56] the Black Knight topper.

[08:57] So think about that as well.

[08:59] They're not even R&Ding in original sort of mechanism or topper.

[09:04] It's the same thing.

[09:05] I bet they went to the same company where they used to make a profit selling the Black

[09:09] Knight topper for 500 bucks.

[09:11] I bet you Stern is only spending $200, $250 on these toppers at most.

[09:16] You know why I know that?

[09:18] How could they sell the Black Knight topper for a profit for 500 bucks?

[09:22] You think they were losing money on everyone sold?

[09:25] Absolutely not.

[09:26] So now they're going back to this company and saying, hey, make us another.

[09:29] Make us another.

[09:30] And I bet that company has charged Stern incrementally more for each one made.

[09:36] And Stern is now turning to us and charging us two to three times more money on what the

[09:41] item should cost.

[09:42] And here we are.

[09:43] 2024 pinball.

[09:45] Canada just can't believe this stuff.

[09:47] What else is going on this week?

[09:49] You know, we did a show yesterday.

[09:50] The next thing I want to talk about for us Pulp Fiction fans out there, it looks like

[09:54] the verdict is clear.

[09:55] The audio clips from the movie don't sound good.

[09:59] Owners are getting their games.

[10:00] They sound really bad.

[10:02] As people are saying, it sounds like someone held a microphone up to a TV that was playing

[10:07] the Pulp Fiction movie.

[10:08] It's not good.

[10:09] And I think they're going to have to solve this because between David Thiel saying the

[10:13] game sounds amazing and owners saying the callouts from the movie are terrible.

[10:18] And it's all the movie callouts like the original callouts in the game sound great.

[10:23] And I know that's not music to the ears of people waiting for Pulp Fiction because the

[10:27] lines that you want to hear the best and the lines that you want to hear the most clear

[10:32] are the movie lines that you love.

[10:34] So I hope there's a solve for this.

[10:36] There has to be right.

[10:37] There has to be.

[10:38] You can put in a DVD of Pulp Fiction and it'll sound amazing.

[10:42] So I'm not sure why the game doesn't sound great.

[10:46] Look Texas Pinball Festival is right around the corner.

[10:49] We're going to get a lot more news from the show.

[10:51] I just wanted to do a real quick show just saying this.

[10:54] I'm exhausted by all of this.

[10:56] I'm exhausted by the greed.

[10:58] I'm exhausted by the stupid little trinkets that we're now spending a fortune on.

[11:03] And it comes down to simple things right for two little stickers that go inside your game.

[11:08] We're going to charge you $100 for a shooter knob to 25 for a topper that we used to sell

[11:13] you for 500.

[11:14] It's now 2000.

[11:15] And again, I'm just out.

[11:17] I'm out.

[11:18] I'm tired of these companies.

[11:19] I'm tired of them not reading the room.

[11:22] It's not about the money.

[11:23] It's about the principal.

[11:24] If I walk into McDonald's and they want to sell me a quarter pounder with cheese, as I

[11:28] always say, it's still delicious at $5.

[11:31] It's just as delicious at $50.

[11:34] But I'm not going to spend $50 on it.

[11:36] And I think that's where the conversation begins and ends with me.

[11:40] If you want to sell me something, I want to know what the price is first.

[11:43] And everyone's just lost the narrative in this hobby.

[11:46] The reason why this hobby survived for so many years over the last 10 to 20 years is

[11:51] that value was passed on to the customer.

[11:53] Things were still collectible.

[11:55] That is gone.

[11:56] The collectability is gone.

[11:58] The value is gone.

[12:00] Cool.

[12:00] If all that's gone and you just want to have pinball fun, then you might as well wait

[12:04] until the price is on all of this plummet.

[12:06] And it's coming, people.

[12:08] It is coming.

[12:08] A couple games will not save an industry.

[12:11] And I think it's going to be brutal for Stern and Jersey Jack if they don't figure out a

[12:16] way to give us the value at these prices.

[12:18] Everybody will talk soon.

[12:20] A short little episode.

[12:21] Just want to say I love you.

[12:23] Thank you for the support.

[12:24] And it's always fun talking about this stuff every day.

[12:27] And I don't want to complain about this stuff.

[12:29] I don't.

[12:29] I don't want there to be $2,000 toppers.

[12:32] I don't think there should be $2,000 toppers.

[12:34] I think there should be some hip hop and pinball.

[12:37] And I think these companies should be making themes that make us not even have conversations

[12:43] about price.

[12:43] We're not going to be talking price if the matrix comes out.

[12:47] We're not going to be talking price if diehard came out or top gun.

[12:51] The reason why we're so focused on price, they're shoveling these mediocre themes at

[12:55] us.

[12:56] They're charging more than they've ever charged before.

[12:58] And then they're selling us plastic crap for 10 times what it should cost.

[13:02] Everybody can ate it out.
