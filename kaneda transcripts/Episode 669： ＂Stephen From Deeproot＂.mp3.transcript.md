[00:00] You can get it. I can take it. Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it.

[00:07] I know tonight. Somebody's going to fight.

[00:14] Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

[00:18] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast. The only pinball podcast that Ed Robertson

[00:24] won't admit he listens to it. Without further ado, I want to give you Steven from Deeproot.

[00:30] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to the show Steven Candel, who used to work at Deeproot Studios in Utah.

[00:38] Steven, welcome to the show. Hey, thank you so much, Canita.

[00:41] Now Steven, let me just ask right away, when you hear the word Deeproot, what comes to mind?

[00:47] Just a pit in my stomach. It's not really anything that comes to my mind.

[00:51] Nor of a shiver down my back in the foot in the stomach.

[00:55] What, you think you're going to get this show for free? You cheap bastards.

[01:00] No, you're not getting anything. You're going to have to sign up for the Canadian club.

[01:06] You know, the only thing I'll give you right now is a little bit of a preview of the soundtrack

[01:13] you're going to get in Stern's Jaws pinball because they don't have the assets to the movie.

[01:20] Are you ready for it? Canita, five for five. Drop it.

[01:56] It's making it a lot of fun.

[01:59] Thank you.

[02:01] You're welcome.
