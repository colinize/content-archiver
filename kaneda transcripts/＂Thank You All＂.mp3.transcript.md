[00:00] I am number one, no matter if you like it, take it down it right, but I am number one.

[00:07] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say.

[00:11] Well, we did it two years in a row.

[00:15] Favorite pinball podcast, Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:17] I want to thank everybody from the bottom of my heart who voted for this podcast.

[00:23] And I don't know what the total number of votes were.

[00:26] All I know is I do this show for each and every one of you.

[00:30] And I'm tired.

[00:31] I don't know about you guys, but when you go to these shows, they are very long days.

[00:36] And there's a lot of times spent waiting in line to play games.

[00:40] You're still adjusting to being on airplanes and living in hotel rooms for a couple days.

[00:47] But the whole reason I came down to Texas pinball festival, first and foremost, was to see so

[00:52] many of you out there who I normally don't get to talk and hang out with.

[00:57] And so many of you guys out there who chat with me over the last few days, I just want

[01:02] to say, I think I love all you guys.

[01:05] I do.

[01:06] Like on some level, I just love all of these men who are super passionate and super geek

[01:13] out over something like pinball, this harmless little game that is still surviving well into

[01:19] 2019 has connected all of us in a unique way.

[01:23] And I really do appreciate all of you who came up to me.

[01:26] I mean, it really means a lot.

[01:28] When guys like Frank DeAngelo come up and say, hey, me and my son, we listen to every

[01:32] show.

[01:33] We really enjoy it.

[01:35] And there are so many other stories like that of people coming up and saying, hey, you

[01:40] know, I just want to say, I'm a fan.

[01:41] I love every episode.

[01:42] Well, maybe not every episode, but I love the show and keep doing what you're doing.

[01:48] And tonight's victory in the Twippies.

[01:50] And it really, for me, it means a lot that we won this for you guys.

[01:56] I mean, that is why I really appreciate this award because I think it gives you guys

[02:03] some, some hopefully some sort of validation of the pinball podcast you decide to listen

[02:08] to on a weekly basis.

[02:10] Now, if you watch the Twippies tonight, you will have seen that this award was not giving

[02:16] without controversy.

[02:17] I'm going to talk a little bit about that later on.

[02:20] But first I want to thank Greg and Zach and Jeff for putting on an incredible show.

[02:26] I mean, this year's Twippy awards blew last year's away.

[02:30] I mean, it was a lot of work.

[02:32] I mean, the mountain of work that these gentlemen did.

[02:35] And there was other people helping them out as well.

[02:37] But for the most part, they turned something that went from just being a Twitch stream

[02:42] into a live event that packed the room that had incredible quality video introducing each

[02:49] category and having all the different presenters from the industry come up there and present

[02:54] all the different awards.

[02:56] It really was an amazing night.

[02:58] And I'm really, I'm going to talk a little bit about my feelings on the one individual

[03:04] who tried to spoil the evening when we got to the favorite pinball podcast category.

[03:09] But you know what?

[03:10] None of that.

[03:11] That takes away or detracts from what was such an incredible show.

[03:16] And I want to go down the list of who won Twippy awards is I want to congratulate everybody

[03:21] who won and all the different games that were recognized and the people behind those games

[03:26] who were part of some of the best in pinball.

[03:29] And we know that this is not all that all there is that is good in pinball, right?

[03:35] There is so much good stuff happening in the pinball hobby right now.

[03:37] It's an exciting time to be following pinball.

[03:40] And even to make it into the top three of any of those categories and being shortlisted

[03:45] like that, I think all those people should be really proud of what they've created.

[03:50] And so the winners were I'll just go down the list real quick.

[03:54] Best home brew was nightmare before Christmas.

[03:57] Best callouts was Deadpool.

[03:59] Best tournament was pinburg.

[04:01] Best toys and gimmicks was pirates.

[04:03] Best mod was Penn Stadium.

[04:06] Best theme was Deadpool.

[04:07] Best arcade was Logan's arcade.

[04:09] The favorite festival was Tpf.

[04:12] Best light show was pirates.

[04:14] Best pinball publication, pinball magazine.

[04:17] Best pinball website, pinside.

[04:19] Best theme integration, pirates.

[04:21] Best streamer was Jack Danger.

[04:24] Best artwork was Iron Maiden.

[04:26] Best YouTube channel was straight down the middle.

[04:29] Best rules was Iron Maiden.

[04:30] Rookie of the year was Keith Allen.

[04:33] Best play field and layout was Iron Maiden.

[04:35] And the game of the year was Iron Maiden.

[04:38] And of course the best pinball podcast was Canadian's pinball podcast.

[04:42] So amazing, amazing night.

[04:44] And we saw like a theme here.

[04:46] It was pretty much Iron Maiden and pirates of the Caribbean battling it out left and right

[04:50] tonight for these awards.

[04:52] Keith Allen was not in attendance, but I'll say this.

[04:57] Everyone who did the present, you know, the, you know, the categories, everyone who accepted

[05:02] the awards, it was a great night.

[05:05] It was a fun night.

[05:06] And I really, I want to sort of take this time on this episode of Canadian's pinball

[05:12] podcast as I, as I pack up my luggage and I get ready to go back to New York.

[05:17] I want to tell you a few things that I wasn't really able to communicate when I got up

[05:21] on stage because I was not expecting somebody in the back of the room to start booing in

[05:28] a classless way and sort of ruining the moment, you know, during the favorite pinball podcast

[05:34] category.

[05:35] What upsets me?

[05:36] I don't care if this guy doesn't like me.

[05:38] All right, that's fine.

[05:39] There's a lot of people out there that I rubbed the wrong way.

[05:43] I can't make everyone fall in love with me and then you shouldn't, right?

[05:48] You shouldn't.

[05:49] But here's what upsets me the most.

[05:51] While it was a little bit disrespectful to me to boo like that from the back, it was

[05:55] extremely disrespectful to Greg and Zach and Jeff and all the hard work they did to put

[06:01] that show together.

[06:02] It also was extremely disrespectful to all the people in the audience who just came there

[06:09] to root on their favorite things, okay?

[06:12] And I think it also puts a really bad stain on a show like that because or not even the

[06:19] show, the hobbyist, right?

[06:21] This reflects poorly on the pinball hobbyist and who are going to boo like that in a classless

[06:28] manner.

[06:29] Imagine if you're at the show and you're there and you're celebrating not everyone there

[06:33] listens to pinball podcasts.

[06:35] I would say probably half of that room doesn't even care about pinball podcasts.

[06:40] They're there to celebrate the games.

[06:42] And so they're there and then all of a sudden the entire show is somewhat disrupted in a

[06:47] negative way because of one person and one person's agenda.

[06:50] The reason why I know it was one person is you could tell it was one person and I ran

[06:55] up to him afterwards and I was just like, what are you doing?

[06:58] Like what's your problem?

[06:59] And he didn't really have much to say.

[07:01] He said he plays pinball.

[07:03] So I can only imagine it was a tournament player and that's his contribution into the pinball

[07:07] world and it's great.

[07:09] And I just said he's classless and I walked away.

[07:11] I didn't do anything.

[07:12] Maybe he was trying to bait me to do something physical.

[07:15] I wasn't going to do that.

[07:16] I think that gentleman will live the rest of his life knowing that he did something that

[07:23] was classless and mature.

[07:25] And so what?

[07:26] In my mind, I'm like, well, this guy is booing from the nosebleeds all the way in the back

[07:30] of the room and I'm up on stage.

[07:34] I'm up on stage accepting an award on behalf of all of my listeners and all of my fans

[07:38] who love this show.

[07:40] So that guy is going to wake up tomorrow and still be cranky and I'm going to wake up tomorrow

[07:44] and I'm going to put this trophy next to last year's trophy and we're going to walk away

[07:51] and satisfy that two for two on the Twippy Awards.

[07:56] And I don't do it for the awards.

[07:58] I do it for you guys and you guys determined that it was your favorite show.

[08:01] All right.

[08:02] I didn't do any shenanigans with the voting.

[08:05] And so I just, you know, and what I wanted to say when I was up there, and this is what

[08:08] upset me the most is why I wanted to get up there and I wanted to say a few words and

[08:12] I tried to, the best I could to get those things out.

[08:16] Of course, I wanted to have a couple jokes.

[08:18] This isn't like a serious award show.

[08:20] I mean, we're all there to have a good time.

[08:22] I mean, that is the key of this entire hobby to have a good time.

[08:26] And I wanted to get up there and the few things I wanted to do was I wanted to thank

[08:30] Brenda because every day she allows me to do this show and she doesn't allow me.

[08:33] She just supports me.

[08:34] I don't have to ask her permission.

[08:35] She knows I love it and she knows that you guys love it.

[08:38] When it came to coming to Texas, she's like, you have to be there with your fans and

[08:41] you have to be there in case you win.

[08:44] I wanted to thank, you know, Zach and Greg and Jeff for all they do.

[08:48] I wanted to thank Robin for banning me from Pinside, which I didn't get to thank.

[08:53] I also wanted to, and I did thank Nate Schivers for his contributions to the Pimbal

[08:57] podcasting world.

[08:59] And I wanted to thank all the manufacturers, which I did do for all they do without

[09:04] manufacturers and without all these games.

[09:07] There's no reason to talk about Pimbal on a daily, weekly, hourly, monthly, yearly basis.

[09:13] All of their hard work gives us the topics and the news and the content we need to actually

[09:19] create shows like this.

[09:20] And I also wanted to congratulate everyone out there who does a Pimbal podcast because

[09:26] I wanted to say this and I was interrupted rudely, but I wanted to say that when you do Pimbal

[09:31] content, the only thing people are seeing out there who listen to our shows or watch

[09:36] our videos, they're just seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the amount of

[09:41] work and hours we all put in to our craft.

[09:45] And the amount of energy we put in, you know, reading different forms, reading websites,

[09:50] talking to people, you know, conversing about Pimbal, trying to find rumors and what are

[09:56] people speculating on and when are new games coming out, all the stuff we do and all the

[10:01] different hours we spend doing it ultimately leads to all the different podcasts and shows

[10:07] that you love and enjoy and you might listen to an hour podcast or a half hour podcast

[10:12] and think it only took that person a half hour or an hour or you know, think it, do you

[10:17] think it takes Marty and Ryan only, you know, two hours to sit down and record that show?

[10:22] No, there's a mountain of hours of lining up interviews of getting people on the phone,

[10:28] of reading up on those people's backgrounds so you have as much information as you can

[10:32] when you talk to them.

[10:34] And then you've got the editing of the show to make sure it all sounds proper.

[10:38] You know, you've got, there's so much stuff that goes into it for your enjoyment.

[10:43] And here's the thing about every single piece of Pimbal content and every Pimbal podcast

[10:47] out there.

[10:48] Here's the real kicker, everyone.

[10:50] They're free.

[10:51] We give this to you on a weekly basis for free.

[10:55] We don't charge you.

[10:57] We simply sacrifice some of our time to give it to you because we enjoy it.

[11:02] We don't even see it as a sacrifice.

[11:03] It's not, maybe sacrifice is the wrong word.

[11:06] But for that person to boo the category, I mean, again, it's just absolutely classic,

[11:13] classless act.

[11:14] And I think, and I think that person, whoever he is, if you know who he is, if he's

[11:18] bragging to you, I think he owes me an apology.

[11:21] I think he owes Greg and Zach an apology.

[11:24] I think he owes Jeff an apology, okay?

[11:27] And I've been reading Pinside and someone said something.

[11:30] They said, I should have taken that opportunity on stage to apologize to Tim Sexton, okay?

[11:37] I want to address this again because I apologize to Tim Sexton already.

[11:42] I sent him a note.

[11:44] I believe I'm Facebook.

[11:45] I sent him an email.

[11:46] I apologize to Levy as well or Levy as well.

[11:51] And I was sincere in that apology.

[11:53] And I also apologized on this show as well, multiple times for that incident at the New

[11:58] York City Pimble Championships.

[12:01] And so in my mind, I'm trying to move past that.

[12:05] I didn't even have a lick of alcohol in me during this weekend.

[12:08] I gave up drinking for Lent.

[12:10] So I'm stone sober this whole time.

[12:13] And so why would I, on a night in which it's about recognizing people's contributions,

[12:20] why would I spend that time continuing to apologize for things I've already apologized

[12:25] for?

[12:26] And I think I try to do my best to say I'm sorry when I'm wrong.

[12:31] I think I do my best to admit when I've made mistakes.

[12:34] And I ask for forgiveness and I say I'm sorry and I am sincere.

[12:38] Now I can't make people accept my apologies and I can't make people validate my sincerity.

[12:46] So I think those of you who know me know I am sincere when I apologize.

[12:51] I think those of you who know me know I'm not this tyrant who deserves to be booed while

[12:57] up there.

[12:58] And again, packed room full of people, nobody booed but one guy.

[13:04] It does take one bad apple, can spoil a moment for people absolutely.

[13:09] Okay?

[13:10] Now look, the other thing I want to talk about and then I'm going to let you guys go because

[13:13] I'm tired.

[13:15] The other thing that I do a lot on this show and I say a lot of stuff about a lot of manufacturers

[13:20] and it's not easy for me.

[13:22] It's not always easy for me to come on this show and say, hey, look, I played this game.

[13:26] I think it's good.

[13:27] I wouldn't buy it.

[13:28] I don't think it's great.

[13:29] It's not for me.

[13:30] And you know, I do that.

[13:31] That's like my stick on this, this show, like I give you my honest opinion of the game,

[13:36] right?

[13:37] Or of a company or of a personality and pinball.

[13:40] But mostly we're focused on the game.

[13:42] I'm very rarely a personally going after anybody, right?

[13:46] But here's the deal.

[13:48] I do that.

[13:49] I come to these shows and I have to walk past those people.

[13:52] You know, there's no avoiding that.

[13:53] I have to walk past the American pinball people.

[13:56] I have to walk past, you know, Charlie Emory.

[13:58] I have to walk past Jersey Jack.

[14:00] Okay.

[14:01] So some of you might have seen me just lambasting Jack about how sloppy and messy their presentation

[14:07] was last night, right?

[14:09] What you didn't see is me talking with Jersey Jack for a half hour today about what I think

[14:16] they can do to help improve things.

[14:17] And we had a great conversation.

[14:19] It was me, Jack and Bill Brandis talking about his company and about marketing and how

[14:24] he needs to be more protective over the brand.

[14:27] And Jack was great and Jack's very receptive and Jack has a lot of passion and Jack cares

[14:32] a lot.

[14:33] And he's a man who's, you know, he's got a lot to deal with.

[14:36] A lot more than I have to deal with when I strap on the, you know, headset and the microphone

[14:39] and talk about his company.

[14:41] But I was trying to give Jack some tips on just things they could do.

[14:45] And Jack has a lot of exciting titles coming down the road.

[14:49] And I really want to make sure they launch them in the way that just again gives those titles

[14:53] justice.

[14:54] And I think a game that is special deserves to be launched in a way that's special.

[14:57] That's just, I'm a marketer by trade.

[14:59] I mean, that's just how I feel.

[15:01] But you don't see that.

[15:02] So you might just hear that podcast and think Chris is just an asshole who went on a tirade

[15:06] about Jersey Jack.

[15:08] And that Jersey Jack and I are like enemies.

[15:10] And that's not the case.

[15:12] You've heard me time and time again.

[15:14] Talk about Alice Cooper's nightmare castle and spooky pinball and how I think, you know,

[15:19] Chuck needs to get the designs better and they need to do this and they need to do that.

[15:23] Right?

[15:24] But here's a deal.

[15:25] As I said to you, I walk into these shows with an open mind and I want to play the games.

[15:28] I want to see the games and I want to experience them and see how far along these games have

[15:33] come.

[15:34] And I really enjoyed playing Alice Cooper's nightmare castle.

[15:36] As I said on my last podcast, I think people are going to be happy when they see the final

[15:40] product.

[15:41] It took a year.

[15:42] It took longer than I thought it should have.

[15:44] I wouldn't want to be in on a game waiting a year with $1,000 non-refundable, but it is

[15:49] what it is.

[15:51] Every person who's in on that game, that was their decision to go in on the game and it's

[15:55] their decision to wait for it and it's their decision whether that when they get it, they

[15:59] want to keep it or sell it.

[16:01] We're all grown men.

[16:03] And I think I try hard on this podcast to just give you my opinion and it's not always

[16:08] the same opinion you might have, but I think a lot of what I say connects with some of

[16:14] you or many of you and not every episode, right?

[16:17] Not every day.

[16:18] And I enjoy doing that.

[16:19] It's just this, it's our little space.

[16:21] You know, when I do this podcast, it feels like it's me and you in a room talking Pimball.

[16:26] And I'll tell you what Texas Pimball Festival is.

[16:28] That's all it is.

[16:30] That's all this is.

[16:31] That's all these shows are.

[16:33] It's me and someone else talking Pimball.

[16:36] And we're giving our opinions on the companies and we're doing it away where we're very

[16:40] candid.

[16:41] And the difference I think is I just take what I feel and instead of just talking to you

[16:46] like in my hotel room here at, you know, the Embassy Suites or us having a conversation

[16:51] about Pimball over a beer at the bar across the street at Paris, those conversations, I'm

[16:56] just telling you what I would say to you there here on the air with this mic.

[17:01] And that's all my show is.

[17:03] And I don't know how else to be and I will make mistakes and I will upset some people

[17:09] and I will apologize when I make those mistakes.

[17:11] But I also want it to be fun and I want it to be entertaining and it should be entertaining.

[17:16] I mean, if you zoom out a little bit, if you zoom out a little bit and you look at all

[17:20] the calamities in the world and all the hardships we're all going to go through in life, right?

[17:24] It's not all roses.

[17:26] We are in Pimball, a non-essential toy that is having some crazy resurgence in 2019.

[17:32] And if I'm going to do a podcast about it, God damn it's going to be fun.

[17:36] God damn it's going to be energetic.

[17:37] God damn I'm going to jump right into it.

[17:39] I'm not going to tell you what I have for breakfast.

[17:40] I'm not going to tell you about the maintenance I did on my machine.

[17:43] You know, I'm just going to jump right into it and tell you what's on my mind.

[17:47] And that's how I do this show.

[17:49] And there are a lot of great Pimball podcasts out there.

[17:52] And I love so many of them and I think all of those personalities bring something different

[17:56] to the hobby and I think that's great.

[17:58] Again, nobody's forcing anyone to listen to this show and no one's making any money on this.

[18:04] And that's the part that's a little deflating for me tonight.

[18:07] I have to be honest.

[18:08] I'm sitting here in my hotel room.

[18:09] It's 11.33.

[18:10] I have this award.

[18:12] I'm not down there drinking at the bar because I gave up drinking for lent.

[18:15] I kept telling people, yeah, I'll meet you for a drink.

[18:16] I'll meet you for a drink and people kept wanting to buy me some drinks.

[18:19] But I just, I gave it up for lent.

[18:21] I actually feel great.

[18:22] I feel great without alcohol in me, especially the last couple weeks.

[18:27] And so I'm sitting up here doing this show.

[18:30] And part of me is like this is just where I want to be in this hobby.

[18:34] I want to be talking to you.

[18:36] I want to be sharing with you my thoughts on the hobby.

[18:38] I enjoy this tremendously.

[18:40] And I thank you so much for listening.

[18:43] We will do another show obviously early this week.

[18:46] Blake is going to come on the show and we're going to give our reaction to T.P.F.

[18:50] We'll also do our feedback on the Twippy Award winners.

[18:54] My overall take, again, I don't want to get into it tonight because I'm talking about

[18:57] tired.

[18:58] I got a pack and I got a go.

[19:00] It's just really interesting that Pires of the Caribbean was getting so many accolades

[19:05] right at the same point in which it is being yanked off of the shelf.

[19:11] It's no longer going to be supported.

[19:13] And I think I've been reading people saying like, Eric's a little monotone.

[19:16] He's not very enthusiastic.

[19:18] Like, Eric's always a little bit that way.

[19:19] That's just his demeanor and that's cool.

[19:21] Like we should not like make fun of anyone for like their demeanor.

[19:26] He probably is a little bit bummed out that his game, which now everyone is finally recognizing

[19:31] what he did and what is being heralded as like a great game on so many levels tonight

[19:36] is no longer going to be up for sale.

[19:38] So I don't think you can blame him that he now has to wait to show us what he can do

[19:42] again with guns and roses.

[19:45] And so, thank you, thank you, thank you.

[19:49] All of you, all of you who I saw at the show this weekend, all of you who voted, all

[19:54] of you who can't stand me but still tune in, all of you out there.

[19:59] I just think, you know, I'm just very thankful that there's so many really interesting people

[20:05] in Pimbo and I could go down a list for hours naming all of them.

[20:08] But you guys really make my days different.

[20:11] You make my life a little bit more unique.

[20:15] You've injected a, an expertise into my head that I just never thought I would have.

[20:23] But when I was a kid growing up in the arcade, I never played Pimbo that much.

[20:26] I played the arcade games.

[20:27] I never knew I would know so much about Pimbo.

[20:31] And I'm happy I do.

[20:32] It's a really, really interesting topic and the personalities behind it are really interesting.

[20:38] And I want to say, I have the best fans in all of Pimbo.

[20:43] So thank you so much for all your support.

[20:45] I look forward to giving you many more exciting episodes of Canadian Pimbo podcast.

[20:51] All of you traveling home, please get home safe.

[20:54] I hope you can listen to the last three episodes and at least crack a smile and just, you

[20:59] know, just enjoy that we have a little bit of a different take on the Pimbo hobby with

[21:03] this show.

[21:04] Everyone, have a great night and I'll talk to you soon.
