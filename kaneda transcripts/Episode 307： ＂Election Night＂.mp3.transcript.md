[00:00] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Election Night 2018 happening in 2019 of January, but

[00:08] tonight there is a buzz in the air that you can't measure with a million yardsticks because

[00:14] at midnight tonight, January 31st, the Twippy Voting closes for all of you out there.

[00:22] So spend the next four to five hours and make sure you haven't already.

[00:27] Go cast your vote for your favorite pinball designer, artist, coder, layout, call outs,

[00:34] manufacturer, and especially your favorite pinball podcast.

[00:39] Now look, you know who I hope you write in.

[00:41] Canadian pinball podcast, but please go do that.

[00:44] The polls close at midnight tonight and now we're going to do a little short little

[00:49] episode 307 of Canadian pinball podcast, a little extra treat for all you guys out there

[00:54] that I know have gone out of your way to vote in the Twippy's this year.

[00:58] We really, really appreciate it.

[01:00] Let's start the show right now.

[01:01] All right, it's Election Night.

[01:09] I never thought we'd get here the final day in which you can vote in the Twippy's.

[01:14] So make sure you go do that.

[01:15] Also, while you're on this weekend pinball, do me a favor, everyone.

[01:20] If you read that site and if you enjoy it and if you appreciate everything Jeff does

[01:25] for the community, which is give you every major thing happening in pinball with none of

[01:30] the drama.

[01:31] You don't have to weed through pin sight anymore to see what's going on.

[01:35] He listens to every podcast and transcribes the interviews for you so you can get the

[01:41] juicy morsels without having to listen to ding bats like me for hours pontificate about

[01:48] pinball.

[01:49] That's incredible.

[01:50] Think about the amount of time he puts into the hobby.

[01:53] And so what I'm asking all of you, if you go to that site and you enjoy it, please donate

[01:58] to Jeff's site.

[01:59] I think he spends an inordinate amount of time that no one really sees or understands

[02:04] and I think we all should.

[02:06] If we're fans of this community, show him some love and donate so he can continue to do

[02:11] that site and to make it even bigger and better.

[02:14] And I know he has some awesome plans for it and I know he would love to do it even more.

[02:18] But he's doing a lot more than guys like me who just put on headsets and scream into

[02:23] a microphone three times a week.

[02:25] All right.

[02:26] So I hope you guys can find some money in those deep pockets to do that.

[02:29] All right.

[02:30] So on this episode, we're going to talk a little bit about some pinball news.

[02:34] Thanks to this week in pinball.

[02:35] I just saw something ridiculous.

[02:37] And we're going to read some of your emails and then I'm going to be done because this

[02:41] was just meant to be a little snackable episode for all of you out there.

[02:45] So first things first.

[02:47] Let's talk a little bit about the node board conversation that continues to rage on.

[02:51] It seems my conversation with the black knight has ignited a little bit of a fire and it

[02:57] continues to burn and there's a debate going on and it's getting really heated and it's

[03:02] kind of funny because in the middle of the debate, you've got guys like ice man being

[03:07] like, what are you talking about?

[03:08] There's no designing for planned obsolescence.

[03:11] You've got the black knight which use that word, which is very much an extreme word.

[03:16] I don't think pinball machines are designed the way an iPhone is designed to stop working

[03:22] in a year or two.

[03:23] We all know when we use our cell phones, how shitty the battery is come a year later.

[03:29] They're designed that way.

[03:31] I mean, I know batteries lose charge over time but they definitely build a lot of technology

[03:38] these days with designed obsolescence.

[03:40] So you buy the next version of it, right?

[03:43] Do we think that five to ten thousand dollar pinball machines are designed with the same

[03:48] approach?

[03:49] I do not.

[03:50] I do not subscribe to that.

[03:52] I do not believe in that.

[03:53] That now that is separate.

[03:55] I think that's like the extreme way to look at this.

[03:58] That is separate from us knowing what the long term reliability is of the node board system

[04:05] of spike two.

[04:06] We don't know.

[04:08] There are some questions though that I would just like to get a specific answer on.

[04:14] And those should not lend themselves to opinion.

[04:17] So one question I have are the node boards on new Stern spike games?

[04:25] Are they repairable?

[04:27] Like can you 15 years from now if one breaks and you don't have a new one, can you repair

[04:34] it?

[04:35] I love someone to email me in who knows that answer specifically.

[04:40] I would assume yes that they will be that they are repairable.

[04:44] Is there something that is just irreparable?

[04:46] That's a piece of electronics.

[04:49] I don't know.

[04:50] I don't know if that's the case with these node boards.

[04:52] I also saw in the thread it was interesting.

[04:55] Rotodev was chiming in on one of his friends as a Batman Ellie.

[04:59] It went down and he said that his friend contacted the distributor and the distributor told him

[05:06] I want nothing to do with this.

[05:08] I don't you know don't come to me with that.

[05:11] And I don't understand that.

[05:13] Why would a distributor tell a customer that they're not going to help them out?

[05:19] That's actually the complete opposite of what a distributor is supposed to do.

[05:23] So I just think that's having a shitty distributor because as I was reading that I was in

[05:29] an Uber this morning because it's the polar vortex.

[05:33] I couldn't walk more than five feet and I was talking to Chris Marquette, a coin taker

[05:39] because that's what I do.

[05:40] I wake up in the morning and I talk to the distributors.

[05:42] No, he called me.

[05:43] We had a nice chat and I just asked him, hey Chris, what's the deal with node boards?

[05:49] Would you replace them?

[05:51] If I have a Batman and it's not broken, can I hold on?

[05:55] Bubba's barking.

[05:56] Alright, Bubba's been fed and Bubba actually wanted to go out as well.

[05:59] So we had a little bit of an unforeseen delay there.

[06:02] I asked Chris if I want to replace a node board, Stern will sell you them through the distributor.

[06:08] So you can buy them even if they're not broken.

[06:10] So you could stock up on node boards for your game so you have peace of mind in the future.

[06:15] So that's one route.

[06:16] Now as people have said though, if the backboard PCU goes down, that's $1,000.

[06:22] That's a lot.

[06:23] It's a lot of money.

[06:24] The other thing is if your node board breaks, you send back the broken one and Stern sends

[06:28] you a new one.

[06:29] And what Chris also told me is that good distributors, they stock up on these node boards and they'll

[06:35] usually do what they can to help out their good customers.

[06:39] So I just think one example of a bad distributor in New Zealand is not indicative of how most

[06:44] pinball distributors are treating their customers.

[06:49] But I think this also just opened a little bit of Pandora's box of once again, people complaining

[06:56] about Stern.

[06:58] And I give Stern shit when I think Stern should be given shit.

[07:02] But how can you really complain about Stern and what they're doing in terms of bringing

[07:08] pinball to people every year?

[07:10] Sure, they've created new systems.

[07:14] But again, I've had a Stern spike two system on my Batman for an entire year.

[07:21] I play the game frequently and I've had no issues.

[07:25] And they make thousands of games.

[07:28] And that's the other thing.

[07:29] These other manufacturers, they hardly make nearly that volume and look at the amount

[07:33] of problems their games have.

[07:36] So for the most part, we don't hear about nearly as many problems as you would think

[07:41] we'd hear if Stern games were really built as bad as some people would like us to believe.

[07:47] And that's just my take on it.

[07:49] And I don't want to think about 20 years from now.

[07:53] 20 years from now, I'll be 62 years old.

[07:56] God help me if what I care about is getting a pinball machine up and working again when

[08:03] I am 62 years old.

[08:06] I will probably be more concerned about how to pay for hopefully my kids college tuition

[08:11] which will probably by then be $100,000 a year, probably more.

[08:17] You know what I'm saying?

[08:20] So look, I think Stern will take care of their customers.

[08:24] I don't think we've seen many examples in which they've turned their back on their customers.

[08:29] All right, let's talk about highway pinball.

[08:33] You must be asking why are we talking about highway pinball?

[08:37] If you go to this weekend pinball, you can see a game that Andrew highway was pitching

[08:43] to make amongst the five to seven titles he had already promised Nate shivers would be

[08:49] out by the end of like 2016.

[08:52] But one of those titles was Angry Birds pinball.

[08:56] And what's really cool about this is somehow Jeff got possession of highway pinball's

[09:04] pitch to the manufacturers of Angry Birds.

[09:08] And this is really funny because we don't normally get to see a pitch deck of a company

[09:16] sort of trying to win a license to make a pinball game based on.

[09:21] And so here we have a Andrew highway.

[09:24] This is funny.

[09:25] It says a stellar combination and it's Angry Birds, you know, the $1 billion franchise

[09:32] and pinball coming together for an incredible once in a lifetime experience.

[09:37] And then we see the play field.

[09:39] And of course, it's computer generated, but you should go look at it.

[09:43] It has pop up, pig pop bumpers like bash targets.

[09:48] It's got some strange like pop bumpers that are normally where the slings are at.

[09:51] I'm not sure how that would work.

[09:54] Then it has a sort of like a a a a slingshot that looks like it comes up in between the

[10:00] flippers that actually fires the ball towards these two buildings or castles that are hidden

[10:08] behind these pigs that come up and down from the play field.

[10:12] You have to just go look at it.

[10:14] This is probably the most complex mechanical ambitious machine.

[10:19] What it looks like a simple machine, but these mechanical features are super duper complex.

[10:25] And I just have a question and maybe I'll get the answer from from a from our friend

[10:30] Dave Sanders, but I highly doubt that highway pinball had mechanically figured out everything

[10:38] that's in this pitch.

[10:40] I think they put this together as something they were confident they could do.

[10:47] But the one thing that keeps popping into my head is this company couldn't even manufacture

[10:54] the xenomorph head grabbing the ball with a tongue a simple mech a tongue coming out to

[11:03] magnetically grab a ball and pulling it back in to its mouth.

[11:09] That proved to be too much for this company.

[11:13] And yet in this they have castles raising and lowering inside the play field targets within

[11:19] those castles a can in slingshot to hit them the angry bird experience in pinball form.

[11:26] What the world is always wanted brought to you by a company that can't figure out how

[11:31] to make complex mechanisms.

[11:33] Here's a game filled with complex mechanisms and I know they don't seem that complex going

[11:38] up and down rotating, but how often do we see stuff like this in pinball and the other

[11:43] part I was thinking about it too is like wow like you're firing the ball all over the

[11:48] place that this game would probably have more dense and dings and chips on the playfield

[11:56] than any game we know about because the ball would be bouncing off that castle if you

[12:01] missed the target and sort of smacking the play field.

[12:06] But you know what my analysis of this machine is pointless because you could just stop

[12:11] at one thing, angry birds.

[12:15] How bad is that as a pinball theme?

[12:19] It makes absolutely no sense and it once again goes to show these companies don't understand

[12:28] who buys pinball.

[12:30] Pinball is played by 50, 40 to 60 year old white males around the world who have game

[12:39] rooms and want a pinball game based upon themes that they love the majority of which

[12:47] are nostalgic themes that they grew up with.

[12:50] Like Ben Heck said they want to feel like kids again in their game room.

[12:56] Angry Birds, a mobile app game that is within the last 10 years pretty recent, enjoyed by

[13:04] tons of people don't get me wrong.

[13:06] And we've all played angry birds probably, we've all had fun with it and angry birds

[13:10] for what it is is fun for what it is in the medium in which it is it does not need nor

[13:16] beg nor translate very well to being a pinball machine.

[13:22] Okay and it just goes to show how bad their market research was to think that this would

[13:29] be a good idea.

[13:30] It is not a good idea.

[13:32] It is not a theme they should have ever gone after.

[13:35] It makes no sense to me from the company that brought you alien pinball comes angry birds.

[13:44] Think about that for a minute.

[13:46] It's almost like Andrew just went down a dictionary and in alphabetical order he just picked

[13:52] the next theme in that dictionary.

[13:54] So it's like aliens after aliens is angry birds.

[14:01] I mean come on.

[14:02] How do you think this is a good game?

[14:05] And I love the way that when pinball people pitch these major franchises the language

[14:11] they use is always we're going to bring pinball to a whole new generation all you know the

[14:16] fan base of pinball meets the fan base of angry birds and you just kind of scratch your

[14:21] head because you have to remember what what if you were on the receiving end of this

[14:25] pitch not only does this deck look completely look it's not the worst deck I've seen in

[14:33] terms of a pitch deck but it is pretty comical.

[14:37] There's no way there's nothing in here that would convince these people to ink this

[14:40] deal remember angry birds people I mean they're they're they're making motion pictures but

[14:46] that being said they do license out the angry birds property to put it on a million things

[14:52] but I think they're probably much more precious when you're pitching them something that's

[14:56] a game because then you're asking to maintain the integrity and the fun of that of that

[15:03] franchise right they don't care if you slap it on it like a lunch box or backpack but

[15:09] when you want to make a gameplay experience based on the franchise I bet they're much

[15:12] more dubious in making sure it's something that would would enhance or be complimentary

[15:19] to how popular their franchise is so it just stupid it's you know it's like just funny

[15:25] that this highway I would love to see what else highway pitched we've heard so many rumors

[15:31] but I love that this is my favorite part of the this week in pinball article so at the

[15:34] very bottom of after all the pictures it just says it was declined very interesting to

[15:40] see though so yeah little blast from the past Andrew highway trying to get angry birds

[15:46] pinball anything else and the other question I was like where did where did Jeff get this

[15:51] from who at highway gave this information and and look even though highway is now defunct

[15:58] and bankrupt it is still not legal to share stuff like this whenever you put together a pitch

[16:05] deck of ideas there is a non disclosure agreement that is still binding I believe when you create

[16:15] stuff like this so that should never been leaked out into the world but you know what nobody cares

[16:22] they don't they're not going to see over this no Andrew highway can't see anybody but just

[16:27] interesting to see angry birds pinball is a potential thing so yeah the joke never seems to stop

[16:34] with highway pinball so let's talk about national pinball day so there is a petition out there

[16:39] to create a national pinball day every year I think that's a cool idea I think it's a really

[16:45] cool idea I mean there is a national day for everything and I work in marketing I mean there's

[16:49] national like national cupcake day national mayonnaise day national hot dog day national mustard day

[16:56] you know national go to work with your kid day every day is a national something now the thing is

[17:03] 95% of those days or more nobody knows about cares about or gives a shit about and media don't

[17:10] write about it and consumers don't engage with it but a national pinball day seems somewhat

[17:15] interesting the day being suggested those seems kind of weird so it is suggested that it be August

[17:22] first which is Roger Sharp's birthday and Roger Sharp which we all know we all love we all respect

[17:29] is the man to thank for pinball being where it is today when he went in front of what was a

[17:35] congress or senate and and and showed them that it wasn't a gambling device it was a game of skill

[17:42] and he pointed at a shot he said I'm going to hit that shot and then he pointed at another

[17:45] and said I'm going to hit that and they finally saw after all these years it wasn't just a ram

[17:51] random gambling device wasn't a game of chance it was a game of skill and that is why we have

[17:57] pinball the way it is today which is awesome and everyone knows that about Roger now August

[18:04] first is Roger's birthday it's not the day he went in front of the government to to win them over

[18:10] it's not the day the ban was lifted so it's just his birthday I do think they should rethink the

[18:16] day of this it should be more commemorative of the actual day in which the ban on pinball was lifted

[18:26] I'll give you another example Budweiser one of my clients we we celebrate prohibition day the

[18:33] repeal day right a prohibition we don't celebrate the birthday of of and house or bush because he

[18:41] lobbied for it we celebrate the actual day in which the ban was lifted and I think that is the date

[18:48] in which national pinball day should be based on what do you think can you to pinball at gmail.com

[18:55] all right what else is going on in the world so do do do do do any more news national pinball day

[19:01] node boards monsters nothing new it's been it's been one of those weeks man I'm telling you I've

[19:07] been working so hard I just I just want to get this show up for you guys so I'm going to read some

[19:11] of your emails let's go down in order from Joe Zankus Joe wrote always love hearing black

[19:18] nights opinion on the industry I think Jerry will be just fine continuing to sell p3 boards

[19:25] American pinball is buying them if multi morpheck were truly a separate company I would say they

[19:32] aren't going to last continuing going down that dumb giant LCD play field concept I think the

[19:40] future is projection mapping he has a link to it did you see highway pinball's next game angry

[19:48] birds yes too old to be relevant not old enough to be nostalgic all right this is not a new pitch

[19:55] so it's it's I did see it we just talked all about it look here's a deal I'm going to read on

[20:00] their email to that goes into what somebody thinks Jerry makes alone from just sale of p3 boards on

[20:08] one game and I think it's going to be pretty shocking and maybe Jerry is laughing all the way to the

[20:13] bank because he's built the engine that runs a lot of games and he's well paid for that so it

[20:19] doesn't matter if multi morpheck makes money or not but it is kind of sad to me if that is the

[20:25] case knowing what he knows about pinball shouldn't he know how to actually make a game that people want

[20:31] is that not fair and I think I would say that to Jerry if I saw him just take your talents man

[20:37] and make a game that people really want it's it's that simple all right the next email is from

[20:46] Jeff S the title is Super Bowl ad 2019 I watched the stellar art wall ad and I am not a fan

[20:54] I like the concept like the tagline and even found it effective because I remember it clearly

[21:01] afterwards what I didn't like was the execution and thought that could have been more enjoyable to watch

[21:09] for instance Carrie was out of her element she belongs in a small bar surrounded by her gal

[21:16] and with all of them drinking cosmos and martinis when she orders the Stella and all hell breaks loose

[21:24] that would have been much better and as a result I predict it won't be considered seminal

[21:29] nor one of the best same comment for the dude who belongs in a bowling alley that could and should

[21:36] have been a separate ad seeing those two together was a no way this at wait seeing those two

[21:43] together was no way this would happen moment anyways the ad is effective and I may be ordering

[21:50] Stella soon why not have someone playing it the big Lebowski Pimball machine in the background

[21:55] and the waiter delivers and sets the beer in the play field glass keep flipping well Jeff first

[22:00] of all thank you I didn't know you were an advertising creative director but I do now

[22:06] and I'll say this the reason why the spot works is you're putting together two people that

[22:10] would never be together and that's why it is effective and I did think that was a bar that would

[22:15] be much more likely to be a place where Sarah you know Sarah Jessica Parker's character would hang

[22:20] out I'm not going to talk all about it I'll just say this TV guide has ranked their favorite

[22:26] Super Bowl ads this year and this spot got ranked as one of the best so I think it will work and

[22:32] I hope you buy Stella for your Super Bowl parties because remember it is for good cause all right

[22:37] anyway let's go back to Pimball and I'm not talking about advertising creative decisions

[22:41] I got an email this is the one about Jerry it's titled maybe Jerry is the big winner and this is

[22:46] from Hugh Hugh thanks for for writing in he's a canada you are my favorite podcast and all of your

[22:53] badgering finally got me to vote in the twippies just for you well thank you who I definitely wouldn't

[22:58] have voted if you didn't keep begging for it you deserve it maybe the P3 Pimball system is going

[23:06] under but let's look at Jerry's other products that are making money quoted um Scott Dinesi

[23:14] Tina uses the following p rock boards okay so he lists five p rock boards that is in the game one

[23:23] is for 175 one is for 45 dollars one is for 85 dollars and one is for seven seventy dollars

[23:30] okay and then he writes a okay so the total cost in tna I'm not going to go into like there's

[23:36] multiple boards the total cost for tna in terms of p rock boards are you ready for this

[23:42] 875 dollars assume 20% discount for volume uh equals okay 875 so spooky pays 700 dollars a

[23:52] machine assume cost of manufacture populate board is 50% of retail price so that's

[23:58] 473 dollars and 50 cents this is worst case assuming a commercial product with razor thin margins

[24:07] I'm really guessing he has a higher markup so Jerry takes home 226 dollars and 50 cents a machine

[24:17] with 550 built machines Jerry has taken home a cool 124 thousand dollars and 575 wait 124

[24:28] 575 dollars this year from tna alone Alice Cooper is now built off the p rock boards guaranteeing

[24:37] Jerry will make more money next year Houdini is built off the same board so he makes a cut on those

[24:43] machines I'm guessing October Fest will be built on those boards stern made money I'm guessing Jerry

[24:50] made more profit this year than Chuck personally did so that's a really interesting email I got

[24:57] does Jerry make on one game alone 124 thousand dollars oh my dinners here hold on people

[25:05] all right so dinner is in the house sorry guys this you know I'm doing this at a weird hour I never

[25:09] do my podcast this late at night so just got my dinner it's probably frozen cold but whatever

[25:15] all right so Jerry makes 124 thousand dollars imagine if we multiply that against

[25:22] Alice Cooper which will have 500 made that could be another hundred and something thousand dollars

[25:27] Houdini October Fest so all of a sudden it seems like Jerry you know might be pulling in

[25:34] you know quarter million three hundred thousand dollars a year on his parts alone which is great

[25:40] I mean he makes the parts that make these games feasible and so maybe he's not in dire

[25:48] straits because of p3 multi-morphic but I think again to my point imagine if he could

[25:55] awesome make a game that would sell a thousand units it'd be that's where the real money lies if

[26:01] you can sell a thousand at seven thousand dollars do the math it's way better than then those

[26:07] margins all right so let's go on I got an email from Jerry Garcia and he was just get I think he

[26:14] was just guessing that the most interesting man the world will be the the surprise character in

[26:20] the Stella spot you'll just have to wait and see on that Jerry I got an email from Joe

[26:25] so pinball predictions and health update Chris guess I'll get in on the pinball predictions

[26:32] especially with another brand new company in sun coast pinball the market will be beyond saturated

[26:40] within two years there will only be two companies left stern and spooky wow

[26:46] Joe that's a that's a bold claim so C.G.C. is going to go under

[26:50] Jersey Jack he writes annual pinball sales will need to double at a minimum in order to support

[26:58] all the new players in the market at the end of the day stern announces and ships no other

[27:03] company can compete with that let me stop there so Joe I just think that for the most part

[27:12] annual pinball sales will need to double at a minimum I don't think that why why spooky is doing

[27:19] all right right now um stern is obviously doing great right now Jersey Jack would be doing great

[27:26] if they would actually just make a good game and they would also I think jack's problem is he's

[27:31] scaled up so much in his factory I think Jack probably needs to downsize his factory and get

[27:39] because when you go to Jersey Jack and you go to Jersey Jack pinball it seems bigger than they need

[27:46] and and maybe I'm wrong I don't know about building pinball companies uh but it seems bigger than

[27:51] it needs to be and there's like so many parts just there but the assembly line seems like such a

[27:58] smaller area to me I don't know maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong but now you're saying Chicago

[28:04] gaming is going to be gone you're saying American pinball is going to be gone you're saying deep

[28:10] root pinball which hasn't even started yet will be gone uh who else you p3 gone who else is going to

[28:17] be gone you know some coast will be gone uh you know so I don't know I don't I do think there's

[28:23] going to be a consolidation but I think there's going to be more companies than that still trying

[28:28] to do it hold on a second bubble this is like really going to be disruptive so I don't I don't know

[28:32] what's wrong with Bubba tonight he's fine he just wants attention his daddy's home and uh and

[28:37] I'm doing a pinball podcast his mommy's in Boston all week so I think he just wants me to play with

[28:41] him so we're gonna keep going through this email because I want to get to Bubba Belly rub time so

[28:46] he then goes on the right not sure if you remember but I wrote to you about a year ago telling you

[28:52] that I was down 87 pounds in a 10 month period now after 21 months I'm down an additional 53 pounds

[29:00] bringing my total weight loss to 140 pounds I'm now 20 pounds later then I was when I

[29:08] in college and the same weight when I graduated high school back in 1996 I even just got done

[29:15] completing the dopey challenge down in Disney world four races in four days 5k 10k half marathon

[29:23] and a full marathon for a total of 48.6 miles my legs were shot after doing the marathon on the

[29:31] fourth day but it was totally worth it considering I would be out of breath walking up a flight of

[29:36] stairs two years ago good luck on the twippies you are by far the best pinball podcast out there

[29:43] thanks Joe first of all Joe congratulations man that is an incredible story it is unbelievably

[29:51] motivating to hear that tale of you getting your weight down getting your life back I've said

[29:59] it so many times on this show health has to always come before all of this and pinball is fun

[30:07] pinball is fun but it's no fun playing pinball when you don't feel good and all of us who have

[30:13] followed the pinball hobby over the years we've seen people we love and care about get into situations

[30:19] where their health declines and then everything else is pointless all right so I just shoved a

[30:25] dental bone in Bubba's face so hopefully that quiet and I'm so sorry for that but let's go back

[30:31] to Joe's story Joe just thank you so much for the twippy vote thank you so much for making the

[30:37] decision to put your health in front of anything else and to getting into shape you're not the only one

[30:42] I have a bunch of friends that are always looking for ways to feel better and I'm always inspired

[30:49] so much by people's decisions to turn a page and to get in shape and to feel good to eat good

[30:57] and to give up all the things that make us feel crappy and so Joe congratulations again from

[31:02] canada's pinball podcast to my brother I'm so happy this is probably one of the greatest emails

[31:08] I've received I'm so happy to hear about your transformation he's still barking are you fucking

[31:13] kidding me all right so I've moved outside the Bubba's couch I'm now sitting on the couch next to him

[31:18] I took a picture of our situation right now and that will be the photo for this podcast so if

[31:23] you might be wondering what is going on that is what's going on I'm trying to calm Bubba down all

[31:29] right let me go to the next email and this is from david it says are you kidding me and he writes

[31:35] here's what he says hey Chris are you effing kidding me with the black night I could possibly look

[31:40] beyond the mallop props and made up vocabulary of the guy if he came across as credible where is your

[31:48] bs meter you're talking with a repairman who positions himself as an industry expert I don't

[31:55] own a single stern game because the play lacks and the value blows but there's nothing wrong with

[32:01] the spike system or hardware software quality I have viewed the code I'm a software guy and it's

[32:08] a solid platform planned obsolescence is bold shit stern is running a real business I have a bunch

[32:16] of bali Williams games and they're not bold approve they're great but very fallible you're a good

[32:22] interviewer so please stick with legit guests and not ancient posers oh snap Dave really you're

[32:30] calling the black night a poser I don't think he's a poser at all I think he knows a lot about

[32:36] pinball more than most of us I think he's seen a lot of pinball companies come and go

[32:41] but this we've talked about this debate with the spike node board in the system I think that it's

[32:48] it is silly to get into a debate about how this thing will be in 20 years again I think we need to

[32:52] answer the question are these boards repairable and what will access to them look like in the future

[33:00] all other debates and arguments about it are kind of ridiculous because you have to remember

[33:06] if stern was shipping 10,000 games a year that were pieces of shit that would break down all the time

[33:12] they'd be out of business let's let's not fool ourselves they'd be out of business sure do I

[33:18] wish there were fuses on the boards where if something went wrong just a fuse blue and I could

[33:24] pop a new one in absolutely I don't know why they didn't design them that way probably because

[33:28] it's cheaper so you know surface mounted LEDs I don't think you can you repair those there is

[33:35] it a nightmare a lot easier to pop in a bulb so look I know that people prefer Sam over spike but

[33:41] what we're just gonna have to wait and see on this one I don't I really don't want this podcast

[33:45] to turn into all about node board discussions how fucking boring would that be all right I got an

[33:50] email from edc he writes black knight 65,000 hey Chris fantastic episode with the black night I just

[33:58] want to stop there you see that you see what happens you interview someone and one person is like

[34:03] this guy's an f in joke and the next guy's like I loved it I this is just just goes to show how hard

[34:10] it is to please people in the pinball hobby I can't even please them consistently with my choice of

[34:18] guess imagine trying to please them making a pinball machine right where there's so much more to

[34:25] complain about he then writes he's he's got such a great insight and knowledge about the hobby

[34:31] unfortunately he's absolutely right about stern and our ticking time bombs it's nice to have

[34:38] someone finally address this publicly hopefully we can get our machines running for a long time I

[34:45] vote for Chris as Ted's permanent replacement for new years predictions by the way I voted for you

[34:52] on the first day of twippy voting for best podcast hope you win because you deserve it keep up the

[34:57] great work well Ed thank you I'm glad you love the black night as I guess I also enjoy him on

[35:03] there as well on there on my show I think he's great we will have him back on I think most people

[35:09] enjoy his take I think the node board thing through people for a loop I think it sparks debate and I

[35:16] don't think you know that's a thing is like when you spark a debate where there are there's a lot

[35:21] of speculation going on and not a lot of facts you you can just find yourself in an endless loop where

[35:28] there is no correct answer because we're all just giving what we think our opinions are about something

[35:34] we all don't fully understand are you confused by what I just said because I am which is why we could

[35:40] debate it for hours on Pinside and no one would know who's right who's wrong all right I got an

[35:45] email from Steve Steve writes can a great show again thank you my only request is to get your thoughts

[35:51] on what was said in the interview after I feel like there was a lot to talk about with a three

[35:57] guest what did we learn what can we speculate on all right so we talked about that last time Steve I

[36:03] think you're right and we did that I was a little unsure who the black night guy was in relation to

[36:08] the industry but the stern topic was bombshell like planned obsolescence I really wouldn't put

[36:14] it past them let's be real the company is about money not pinball period the only reason they are

[36:21] pushing up quality is the competition is forcing them to and that is Steve Steve I wanted to say

[36:27] something if you think stern pinballs about money and not pinball I think you're 100% wrong

[36:35] I they're not a hedge fund they're not an investment bank they are a pinball manufacturing

[36:42] company they are a manufacturing company that makes pinball and they want to manufacture pinball

[36:48] to make a profit but I guarantee you if you went into stern pinball and you talked to people there

[36:56] what they're passionate about and what drives them is pinball now there is a reality that is

[37:03] financial for all of those people who love pinball that is you need to make a game at a certain price

[37:11] to stay in business and each designer is given a budget by which they need to hit that budget

[37:18] to make their game but do not for a minute think stern is just doing this for money now look

[37:25] there may be a few people at the top of stern the investors who are all about the money and may not

[37:31] give two shits about pinball but see the potential to make money in pinball I also highly doubt that

[37:37] because I don't think anyone who wants to invest in a company that is manufacturing pinball

[37:44] could care less about pinball because you could invest your money in so many other areas that

[37:50] would be easier probably to get you a return for example jersey jacks billionaire angel investor

[37:58] once you have that kind of capital that guy could open up 10 holiday in expresses and make way more

[38:04] money than jersey jack pinball but when you open up 10 holiday in expresses by the way each one

[38:10] would probably cost like eight or 10 million dollars when you open up 10 of them guess what you don't

[38:15] get new pinball in the world and guess what that guy loves pinball so that's why he did what he did

[38:21] and I would assume that the investors that are in bed with Gary they also love and appreciate

[38:27] putting pinball into the world so I think you're wrong there man I don't think I think it's easy

[38:33] to take cheap shots at stern and call them all sorts of names but I do think the passion exists

[38:40] I think it exists in George Gomez I think it exists in the designers over there and I think

[38:45] they're under pressure to stay afloat I think if you knew how hard it is to ship 10,000 pinball

[38:53] machines a year and stay in business and have 200 people on the line and have all these designers

[39:00] you know and you know facilitate tournaments and go to shows it's it's it's it's comical sometimes

[39:07] I think how people oversimplify all that stern has to do to remain viable and feasible and profitable

[39:15] and yet how quickly people are to insult them tear them down and make fun of them do I think stern

[39:23] is making the best most magical pinball machines right now I do do I think here's but here's the

[39:31] thing do I think they are making games that are as magical as they could be or as like impressive

[39:39] from a mechanical standpoint as what we saw in the 90s I don't and that's how I feel and but I

[39:46] think they found new ways to bring the theme integration into pinball that are much cheaper

[39:53] than mechanical ways and I'm not a fan of that I know most of you are not a fan of that but can you

[40:01] can you really knock them for that because they did what they needed to do to to be where they are

[40:10] and I'm sorry but you know I mean that's a little bit of a shill stern period but no it's just like

[40:16] I still think that they get sometimes beat up too much all right I got an email from Tim he says

[40:21] a ray hi Chris just listening and a rays and the Netherlands not sweet and thank you Tim I appreciate

[40:28] that I'm always wrong on my geography you could spin a globe and ask me to you know if I stop my

[40:33] finger on a country there's probably like a 75% chance I couldn't name you what country it is I'm

[40:38] sorry how many of you could do that right or kids like we learned stuff like that but I probably

[40:43] couldn't even look at a map of Europe and get like 50% of it right is that me just admitting that

[40:48] I don't I maybe 70% I could get right all right let's go on right now all right so this is an

[40:54] email got rid of Ghostbusters now at hi Chris thanks for your advice it was really helpful I played

[41:00] Lord of the Rings and loved it a few days later I had the chance to play many different games here

[41:04] are some of my thoughts monsters pro looks very nice superb artwork feels better quality wise and

[41:10] some other recent stern releases it shoots really good however I think it's way too simple for my

[41:17] taste after a few plays all reached monster madness mode easily I don't know how much the mini

[41:24] playfield adds to the game probably not too much so after five to six plays I got bored and walked

[41:30] away I think it's a great location pin I know this won't last long for me the Hobbit what a beautiful

[41:36] game it's quality all over the light show is stunning I was really excited to play but I thought

[41:43] playing it was boring I mean interesting from a rules software point of view but the ball just

[41:48] floats up and down felt more like a game from the 70s I told my friend whatever I buy it won't

[41:56] be the Hobbit dialed in looks great plays great it's just not a world I want to get immersed in

[42:03] beetles looks beautiful plays very well very nice but way too expensive for half the price it would

[42:11] be perfect birthday gift for my dad and then I played pyrr to the Caribbean man that game is a blast

[42:18] everything about it is beyond everything I have ever seen luckily I was able to play it in a

[42:24] separate room like this I heard all the sound effects and music the sound effects are from another

[42:31] planet it's like music made with sound effects the orchestral soundtrack is superb the light show

[42:37] is killer it really sets the mood I had no clue what to shoot for but that's so much fun it's fast

[42:44] like a normal body it has an incredible amount of little details I managed to shoot the cannon

[42:50] and couldn't stop grinning that was so cool the next day I ordered my pirate to the Caribbean

[42:56] Ellie and of story I hope you make it again as best podcasts you sure have my vote cheers

[43:04] Philip or Philippe or Philip okay Philip thank you so much I'm gonna end on this email tonight

[43:11] because I think you sort of captured so much of so of all the games we've been talking about lately

[43:17] and you ended buying a game that I have not recommended on this show you have bought a game

[43:23] that I've told people I think is too complex that I that I think doesn't have that much magical

[43:28] stuff to shoot for that is based on a theme that I don't think is relevant or popular anymore

[43:34] and I love that you bought the game because you bought the game that you had fun with you bought

[43:42] the game that you love to shoot and that is the only thing that will ever matter in this hobby

[43:51] it is the only thing that should ever make you buy a pinball machine that goes into your house

[43:57] it's the only reason why when you're in a barcade or in any sort of environment where there's

[44:03] a lot of pins lined up you're gonna go to the game that you enjoy and maybe the thing about Pimbo

[44:09] that's always tricky is you know depending on the day you might want a different kind of experience

[44:15] right because it's funny to me that you said monsters shot really well but you thought it was too

[44:21] shallow and too easy and even though you didn't know what you were doing in pirates you had more

[44:28] fun and you thought it was the game for you right so you weren't really experiencing the code

[44:34] but you you must know the code is deep and there's a lot to to learn there and when you have it

[44:40] pirates will not be a game that will ever be considered shallow and easy and you're getting to

[44:45] stuff super quickly in fact I've been reading in the pirates thread people are a little nervous

[44:50] that the game is too hard and that they're loved ones and and people who are not good at Pimball

[44:56] might get bored of being frustrated trying to progress through the game but that's besides the

[45:01] point the lesson here is try everything out play everything you can and when you find the game that

[45:09] just clicks with you that you want to own buy it enjoy it play it every day for the rest of your

[45:17] life life is really short we get 365 days in a year it's not a lot really starting to like

[45:26] eat away at me a little bit lately how fast the weeks go how fast the days go how fast the years go

[45:32] we have so little time and we're all lucky to be in a position where we can actually apply some of

[45:38] that time to Pimball which is not something those people around the world have the time to think

[45:44] about have the time to enjoy so on some level we're all sort of blessed that this is something that

[45:50] we have the time to enjoy and so I think it's a good way to end this show it's a good way to think

[45:57] about what you vote for in the twippy's vote for the game that you like vote for the thing that you

[46:02] think is the best don't worry about what everyone else thinks you might think the Beatles artwork is

[46:06] the best vote for it you might think it's Deadpool you might think it's Alice Cooper's this entire hobby

[46:13] this entire hobby is one big subjective journey this podcast gives you one person's opinion on a hobby

[46:24] that has thousands of collectors thousands of tournament players and millions of people that know

[46:32] what Pimball is now only a few thousand care enough to listen to podcasts and hopefully most of

[46:39] those people will show their support in the twippy's for all the people making Pimball and think

[46:44] about it too there's only like in all the people on planet earth like nine billion plus people

[46:51] how many people are actually making Pimball machines how many maybe what in total a thousand people

[47:00] probably less probably like 500 people out of nine and a half billion are actually waking up every

[47:08] day working hard to make you Pimball I think that's incredible I think sometimes you know we can focus

[47:15] on the negative but when you start to like look at the glasses half full we're in a hobby that should

[47:21] be dead should have been dead years ago and on this podcast you know I always want you to get the

[47:27] most for your money I want to push these manufacturers to make the greatest game possible I want to weed

[47:33] out the charlatans the frauds the hacks the fakes the people that will steal your money I don't want

[47:38] them to get away with it I want to weed out the sexist the racist the bad people out there that just

[47:44] think you know they can say whatever they want and it doesn't impact their companies and I want you

[47:49] to get the best Pimball machine you possibly can for the money and that's it that's it that's really

[47:56] why we're here and I thank you from the bottom of my heart episode 307 of Canatus Pimball podcast

[48:02] enjoy enjoy your weekend enjoy the Super Bowl I think you guys are probably one of the most

[48:09] entertaining and passionate groups of people out there I wish I could do more for Pimball I really do

[48:15] you know to the guy who says put a big Lebowski Pimball machine in the Super Bowl spot I wish I wish

[48:21] I could actually come up with more Pimball ideas from my clients it's just too small it's too niche

[48:27] but I like that about it I like that it's just this tiny little club of dudes out there that you

[48:34] know are screaming at the clouds that you know that there's not a real bank of targets in the lily

[48:43] target bank in monsters literally 99.9999% of people will be like what the fuck are these guys crying

[48:50] ladies and gentlemen episode 307 of Canatus Pimball podcast have a great weekend

[49:20] but
