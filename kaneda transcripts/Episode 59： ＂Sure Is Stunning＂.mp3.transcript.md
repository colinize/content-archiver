[00:00] Do you believe in magic?

[00:02] In your girls heart, how the music can free her whenever it starts and it's magic?

[00:10] And it's...

[00:16] Welcome to KenedA Live, your daily source for pinball podcast news.

[00:21] It doesn't it feel like we're doing this every day now?

[00:25] There is just always so much to talk about and when we last left off,

[00:29] we were wondering whether or not we would see pictures of Houdini today and we got them.

[00:35] And so on this episode, I wanted to discuss them and I wanted to discuss some of the feedback that we've been seeing going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth on Pinside about this whole Harry Houdini game

[00:48] made by American Pinball designed by John Papaduke and what this means for the hobby.

[00:54] So we finally get a closer look.

[00:57] We saw in the morning, American or sorry, pinball news put up a story about American Pinball.

[01:03] A lot of people have some issues with that story saying it's a little bit of a love letter that it's soft journalism.

[01:09] Guys, it's a pinball media outlet.

[01:11] Do you really expect him to go in there like the Wall Street Journal and pull the whole thing apart and ask these guys like tough questions inside their hotel room on day one of meeting these guys?

[01:21] He was probably just thrilled to see a brand new pinball machine inside a room.

[01:26] So cut him some slack here, right? He gave us information and I think we're at the stage now where everyone, if you read between the lines, is just starving for information.

[01:36] They want to know what is up here.

[01:40] And on this episode, let's just tackle this from a few angles.

[01:45] One being, let's just talk about what we think about the game.

[01:47] All right, I'm going to start there and then we're going to get into all the back and forth and then continue debate and all the ethical and moral questions that people are raising on Pinside.

[01:55] I just saw even Orrick is chiming in, Iceman's chiming in, PDX monkey chiming in.

[02:00] I mean, everyone, this thing is activated every major player on Pinside and has just got them all in one room debating this, which is exciting.

[02:08] I mean, it is exciting to hear all these different personalities give their two cents.

[02:11] So I have to admit, I'm, there is mixed emotions around this game and that is simply because I know what I'm supposed to feel, but then I know how I really do feel.

[02:21] So I'm supposed to look at this thing and be skeptical, be cynical, and be critical because of everything that J-pop has done, right?

[02:30] All the bad, I'm supposed to look at this guy and just go in hating what I'm going to see.

[02:35] And then I feel what I really feel, which is the game looks amazing.

[02:40] Shit, he did it again. He just makes machines look magical.

[02:45] He makes them, there's something about a J-pop game that just from a distance you look at it and it's like nothing else you see out there.

[02:53] And it's just again, it's, it's the reason why as much as you guys might hate this, it's the reason why this guy was sought after by American Pimball.

[03:03] If you're looking to hire a Pimball designer to really make a statement, you, you cannot deny that J-pop games, again, I'm not talking about whether this flips or not, that J-pop games visually hit hard and they immediately make you want to jump in and play.

[03:20] And so the artwork, we learn that this is all new hand drawn art by a new artist that we don't know who it is.

[03:29] And I have to say, the art looks amazing. It absolutely looks amazing. I even asked Zambi Yeti for his opinions on the artwork and I'm not going to share everything he said with me about it.

[03:40] But he said one thing that was just interesting, he said, finally John is allowing there to be contrast between lights and darks.

[03:46] And I think if you compare Houdini to Magic Girl, you'll see what he's talking about.

[03:52] There's a lot more contrast in color here. But I have to say, you know, the back box with Houdini with his arms out, one hand, got a deck of cards floating, the other got some Pimballs, and he's got chains attached to his wrist, and he's got, I love like the H's on the speaker grills.

[04:09] It just looks really, really nice. And there's an image of the play field art. And it looks like there's like a Harry Houdini holding up a ball and there's like a thing in the middle that says believe.

[04:23] And it's got your typical J-pop. It's what you expect. It's these clear, squiggly ramps, it's got a bunch of toys, it looks like it's got a bunch of Balls Eye magnets.

[04:34] It's got the big screen in there that we saw from Zidware. And so it looks great. It's got this big pinball on top, like a topper that says believe in it.

[04:45] But we only have three pictures. And it was a little frustrating. You know, these guys are showing the game for the first time, and I wish they would have taken the glass off.

[04:53] I wish they would have done some more close-ups of the mechanisms and what's on the game on the play field.

[04:59] But no one apparently was at the show. No one at Pinside went to the show and was able to take a lot of photos. So we have to go with what we can see here.

[05:10] There's not even any real images of the cabinet or the back box area. But what we've seen, it looks J-pop. I'm going to say it looks J-pop. And I think it looks really exciting.

[05:26] As much as people want to say, well, it's not flipping. It's another Smoking Mirror's Act on John's part. This is the same shit all over again.

[05:35] And I'm going to address that right now. Because I don't think this is the exact same J-pop Act all over again. And I've said it before because J-pop has people backing him this time with lots of money.

[05:49] That is the big part people don't get. I get John burned through $1.2 million. But when John was burning through money, he didn't really have a team surrounding him getting things moving.

[06:03] He was meticulously moving through stuff. He couldn't make up his mind. He clearly didn't have a project manager. He clearly didn't have deadlines.

[06:09] He clearly didn't have anyone around him with any manufacturing and production expertise. And I have to believe that these people that he's with now have that.

[06:20] If they don't, let's just play this scenario out. Why would these people do this then? Why would they open up all the wounds of J-pop?

[06:29] Come out and announce that they're going to make the magic girls. They announce that they're going to make Houdini.

[06:35] And announce that they're working with J-pop. And announce that they're going to run the rights of J-pop. Why would they even do that? Why would this very wealthy man even start a company and go down the road unless they have magic girl finished?

[06:50] Unless they have Houdini very far along. It just makes absolutely no sense that these guys would open up that wound again and hurt people all over again.

[07:01] And I understand. I understand. We're going to talk about the response from Pennside. And it's pretty unanimous. It's pretty understandable.

[07:11] And then there's the response on Facebook that people are also talking about. So what was the response? I mean, the response is the same as it was with magic girl. It's that, look, here we go again.

[07:25] This guy is revealing a pin and it's not flipping. No one's playing it. It doesn't work. We heard a lot of people say it's just got a static screen in the back that says Houdini on it.

[07:38] So it's, you know, there's probably no code. This thing is really premature. They shouldn't even show it. And I don't know. I was told by Scott that Houdini will be playable. It's absolutely playable. And it will be playable at Expo.

[07:54] Expo is in like a little over two weeks. So everybody just be patient. If Houdini is not playable at Expo, then yes. I think people have every right to call bullshit.

[08:07] But again, why would they go to Expo? Why would they even take Houdini there if it wasn't playable? It doesn't make any sense. So I have to come to the logical conclusion that these guys came out and revealed themselves to the world when they knew they had two machines that were pretty far along.

[08:30] And I think Magic Girl is pretty much got to be done if they're going to give Chris from Cointaker his game at Expo. You know what I'm saying? Why would they do it?

[08:41] You think they're, they start this company just to punish people all over again. And you know, like I hear guys like, or being like, I can't believe this shit. Like my friends got burned and have we learned nothing. And I get it.

[08:57] Like I get it. Like it's you definitely have every right to be pissed off that we're going on the J-pop merry go round again. But as someone else pointed out, and I think it was PDX monkey, well what would you like to have happen, or would you like people just accept the fact that it's gone for good?

[09:17] Or would you like them to at least have a chance at getting something out of this whole thing? And all of a sudden this company comes along and they are, they're basically making claims that they're going to make it right.

[09:30] Isn't that better than nothing? I don't understand how anyone could argue that that's not better than nothing.

[09:36] There's a whole bunch of conversation around where is the, where are these games being made and where are the parts coming from? Are they coming from China? Are the play fields going to be assembled in China with cheap parts and just mail to America and stuck in cabinets?

[09:50] I have pretty good information that that is not the case that these parts are coming from US made pinball parts. And that is what will be in these machines.

[10:01] The hardest part, and this is the thing that, you know, it's really hard to look at the business side of this whole thing because a lot of people are saying this makes no sense financially, right? And I agree.

[10:11] If you look at it at face value, why would anyone do this? Why would anyone want to inherit a company that's got $1.2 million in people who were defrauded from their games that has bad sort of will and bad reputation within the community? Why would anyone do it?

[10:28] Why would anybody even do this with J-pop? And I think what we saw today is why? There are nobody makes games that look like J-pop games.

[10:40] There is nobody out there designing that is blowing people away the way this guy has been able to just visually blow people away with his games.

[10:49] I'm sorry, but like the only thing that is in the realm of it in recent titles in terms of artwork and toys is Ghostbusters.

[10:59] But that's, and look, Ghostbusters used the artist that J-pop discovered for the world. And I do know for a fact that John did reach out to Jeremy with an apology. I know this.

[11:13] So John is starting to try and write some of the wrongs. And is he moving fast enough? Of course not. Does he feel bad? I don't know.

[11:24] I can't answer that question. I think for those of you who feel like you are owed a personal apology by John, that is between you and John.

[11:32] And if John does the right thing, then he will reach out to the people that he knows deserve those apologies. But everyone on Pinside is making it seem like J-pop owes all of them an apology.

[11:42] He doesn't owe you an apology or he doesn't owe you guys an apology who weren't even personally involved in this whole thing.

[11:50] For the buyers and the people who gave John their money and John their trust, of course he owes them an apology.

[11:56] But I think everyone just needs to just calm down a little bit. I understand the anger. But this whole thing is going to play out sooner than later.

[12:05] If one thing if these guys came out like six months ago and are like at Expo, we're going to show our plans.

[12:11] Can you imagine like six months of us having to deconstruct this thing? At least this entire operation is going to be exposed for what it really is by Expo.

[12:21] And I keep trying to think like what could sort of hinder them at Expo and the whole issue around who has the IP for these games? Is it Bill Brandis? Is it John?

[12:31] How are these guys getting away with Magic Girls if Bill owns the IP for everything? And Bill said, you know, like this cryptic statement about lawyers contacting him and then said don't worry about it.

[12:40] We're not moving forward with any of the projects. And then all of a sudden Magic Girls moving forward. So it's really, really interesting to see what happens here.

[12:47] Because if you look at the Magic Girl Cab and that you don't see the Zidware logo on it. So I'm not sure what they're doing.

[12:54] What I do know is it sounds like a lot of really rich people are going to be battling this out for the rights to get this game out.

[13:02] And I think look, I think Bill just wants his hands cleans of it too. Clean of it too. Like everyone else spoke to him a little bit.

[13:08] And it brings up just terrible emotions for him and I get it. He wishes he could have done a lot more with that money than trying to save John's ass.

[13:15] So there's just a lot, a lot of people that are just riled up around this. We got Iceman. He's like, what about the code? I mean seriously.

[13:25] The last thing we should be worried about is code. Everyone's so concerned about Magic Girl and how will it shoot and what will the code be like.

[13:34] And that is an interesting question. And then, you know, who do we haven't seen it shoot? So we can't say, but it looks like the shots can occur.

[13:42] The Magic Girl is the big question mark for me because when we saw Magic Girl shoot, there were so many issues with the layout.

[13:50] And I just don't know how they redesigned it and got like all those 10 magnets, magnets working. I don't know if they moved stuff around.

[13:57] And if they moved stuff around, how did they get, how's the art going to work? Because zombie Yeti drew it with all those things in the positions they were in.

[14:05] And Magic Girl was a little bit like just throw everything in.

[14:08] So I have to imagine they took some stuff out and made Magic Girl playable and much more realistic of a game.

[14:14] It's still a beautiful game. Jeremy's artwork on Magic Girl, I still think is incredible.

[14:19] Whenever I see that Magic Girl back box, I can't help but just want one. It just looks so awesome.

[14:26] But it's been, it's been an interesting day. And then the other part that really just kills people is if you go over to American Pimbles Facebook page,

[14:36] the reaction is a little different. It's not completely different. But you have a lot of people that are just like, this looks sweet, I want to get one.

[14:44] And you know, those people are often chastised and are reminded by the other people that they shouldn't even consider giving pre-order money to these guys to buy Harry Houdini.

[14:58] And I don't think these guys are expecting to get pre-order dollars.

[15:01] If Magic Girl's do ship out, I could see them taking orders. I think it's hard to deny that they are being looked at one step at a time.

[15:12] And people, you know, everyone wants answers to everything. But we gotta at least give them a chance to go one step at a time with this, right?

[15:20] Let me read some of the feedback that people wrote on the American Pimball Facebook page.

[15:26] I just think it's interesting. So let's see, Bill Cohen wrote, much kudos for what you are trying to do. You definitely have an uphill battle because of past history with J-Pop.

[15:37] But I give you huge props for trying to make something that was not your fault right best of luck.

[15:42] Let's see. One guy writes, great artwork. Love the large LCD too.

[15:50] Justin Kelly writes, all of this is a moot point. If they don't make right on J-Pop's past fuck up, if they hook everyone up, who got robbed with their cash, then they'll be a customer for life.

[16:01] Otherwise, I'll make it my mission for them to go down in flames. One guy wrote, looks amazing. Mike Nogo, and we've heard this a lot.

[16:10] You're really limiting yourself with the LED in the play field. I get it for one game, but you may want to reconsider on future and put it up in the back box.

[16:17] This will allow more space and height for ramps and mechs. Good looking game.

[16:22] And then you know, you get some guys who are just like, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, right?

[16:29] Like one guy writes, unfortunately J-Pop did some bastardly things. Maybe it was intentional, maybe it was not.

[16:36] That is debatable. He did however screw many people and many vendors, including myself for money owed and two of my good friends from Magic Girl and Zombie.

[16:47] While it's great to see another company and no doubt it's good for Pimball. Not sure if J-Pop was the guy to represent American Pimball launch.

[16:53] But then again, I understand that American Pimball is standing behind Magic Girl and will deliver them after all.

[16:58] Alright, so like, look, we're all saying the same thing. There's like, there's 10 different ways people are saying it. There's 50 people saying the same exact thing.

[17:06] Like no one is not many people are saying one thing, and that is, I want one. But I know this for a fact.

[17:15] There is a silent, silent majority out there that is probably like this game looks fucking cool. I didn't get screwed by J-Pop before.

[17:25] And if this game comes out, I'm buying it. And they would buy it even before people who got screwed on Magic Girl, Razor and Alice in Wonderland got their restitution.

[17:35] They would. It's just, it doesn't make it right, doesn't make it wrong. I don't know. I mean, it's like, yes, you could argue we should be a community and stand together.

[17:46] But that's such bullshit. When I hear people like, you know, like Ork say that stuff like all of a sudden it's like, kumbaya, we can all be allies now against the common foe J-Pop.

[17:56] I'm kind of like, no, like all Pinside ever does is fight each other, argue with each other, complain about each other, attack each other's companies, pull each other apart, being hypercritical of each other's games. And when we saw it, we saw it.

[18:11] You know, it's unbelievable. People complaining about the inserts on Ghostbusters, the fonts that were used, this and that. Nothing has been positive.

[18:20] And so if I'm a pinball collector and I didn't get burned on Roz and I don't want an alien or I don't want a lawler pin and this thing is like, whoa, and it's Harry Houdini and it's got all these toys and these mechs and it's only $7,000.

[18:34] I have no problem ordering one. I have no problem ordering one. I think a lot of people are probably feeling that way. They're not going to say it. If you say that and you go on Pinside and say that, you're walking into a buzzsaw.

[18:47] Now personally, I would just wait. I think Expo is going to be this amazing time where like all this stuff is just put out there for people to decide on what to buy and why Rush into it.

[19:00] You know, American pinball has not said anything about pre-orders. They have not said anything about how many Harry Houdini's they plan to make. They have not even said anything about the timeline for Houdini.

[19:10] I don't buy it that they've said that they've only been working on this pinball machine for three months. That's bullshit. They're saying that. I think they're trying to impress us with how much they can do in three months.

[19:22] Like if they can do this much in three months, imagine where will be three months from now. There is no way that machine with all that artwork drawn with all those mechs and all the design on it was done in three months. There's no way. I'm calling bullshit on that.

[19:36] I think they said that to appear to be much more efficient and effective than they are. Because we all know that when it comes to making pinball machines, nobody is really accomplishing shit in three months.

[19:47] The thing is this. And I think this is something that we all have to start to accept. Not everybody who got screwed over by J-Pop is going to be made right.

[19:57] Because look, there are certain people that may have done things with great intentions and they were doing the right thing and they were trying to help John.

[20:07] But there's just a reality. And I think there's a lesson learned by a lot of people in this is nobody should ever work for free.

[20:15] We're all big boys. We all have professional careers. We all have skill sets. We all have things we're doing. And I think if you're working for free with hopes of getting a pinball machine, I think you're not a good businessman.

[20:29] I just think that that is inexcusable. I think Eric didn't he do the artwork for alien just to get a machine. Like what if highway went under all that work he did and he's not going to get a machine.

[20:42] I hear all these other vendors saying I did all this work for John and I got screwed and he owes me a machine as well. And I just look, people need to learn that that is not a binding contract.

[20:56] Yes, like the man's word might have said that but you have to remember you're a professional. All these guys who are working on this machine were professionals.

[21:06] And if you didn't get it in writing, isn't that like an old saying like get it in writing. Like nothing is guaranteed unless you get it in writing and with a signature and dated and maybe even have it like notarized.

[21:20] So I think there's a lot of people out there who are expecting a magic girl that just aren't going to get one. And I said this on the last podcast but that's the lesson learned.

[21:30] If a pinball manufacturer contacts you and says I want you to do some work for me, but I'm not going to pay you anything.

[21:38] Does that sound like a good deal. Does that sound like something you should do that's it's that sound like something you should apply your time against.

[21:46] And then he says to you know what but because I can't pay you now because we're in the middle of making it and you know money's really tight.

[21:54] I'm going to give you a game. I'm going to give you a game. Doesn't that set off some alarms. So if a company is at a point where they can't even pay you and they're deferring payment and they say to you what we're going to give you a game.

[22:08] Just ask yourself where's the money from that game going to come from to make it so you can just get one.

[22:16] Where where like as much as you gave the pinball manufacturer some time and a skill and some work. He still needs to get physical money to build the machine he's going to give you.

[22:30] He can exchange the hours or gave him for doing artwork to give to the vendor to then get the parts to build the machine. You see what I'm saying it just it's it's it's not feasible.

[22:42] You should never accept the product is payment especially if the products not even built yet especially if the company doesn't even money to build the product.

[22:51] So I think a lot of people are going to learn a lesson here that if you have you know a love of pinball and you want to do something to help a pinball company out.

[23:00] You gotta always think about yourself first and you have to be a little bit selfish in business is the only way to guarantee you're not going to get screwed with these kind of handshake deals that john was doing.

[23:11] You know and I think a lot of those people are going to still be screaming on the forums for for many more months and years to comment as especially when people start getting their magic girls.

[23:21] If that does happen I think these people are going to like still want theirs. But I don't think they're going to get them I think it's a lesson learned.

[23:29] So this whole thing this whole thing is interesting this is this is a topic that is not going to go away for a while.

[23:38] I'm actually I want to let you guys know that as I know you guys are like probably sick of hearing from me every day.

[23:44] You're actually going to get like a nice break from canada. I am leaving in 15 minutes to go to the airport to go to Peru.

[23:52] I'm going to Montu Picchu my my my girl from Brenda surprised me with an amazing 40th birthday gift an impromptu expedition to an ancient civilization where we're really just going there for one reason and one reason only to set up 50 duplicate accounts on proven soil.

[24:13] So Robin and moderation team if you if you start seeing some Peruvian

[24:19] Pinside logins you know that's me at Machu Picchu. I'm going to summon the spiritual gods of old and ask them for wisdom on which machine to buy this year.

[24:30] Because God knows we're we're acting like ancient Incas right now where we're ready to do some human sacrifice of J-Pop.

[24:38] I implore everyone and I said this on the last podcast. This whole thing is going to play out in three weeks or you could go on the Pinside and make every hour feel like three weeks.

[24:50] You can fight each other back and forth you can speculate all you want but I implore all of you to do this grow up be men stop discussing it amongst yourselves and do one thing reach out to American Pimble.

[25:03] They respond to my emails they respond to every one if you have questions ask them the question get an answer from them respond on the forum what their answer is invite them on to the forum.

[25:15] They're not showing away who's really showing away is the Pinside Mob which is they really just want to keep fighting it.

[25:23] This whole thing is going to play out in three weeks another thing I want to address before I go because I want to give you guys like what what what's been the latest in the Canadian world.

[25:33] I am officially no longer an owner of Ghostbusters Ellie I sold it before ever even getting it and I'll tell you why I really I mean I love the artwork to death I love zombie yeti's artwork on Ghostbusters Ellie.

[25:50] I think it's the best artwork in any Stern Pimble machine ever in fact it might be the best artwork in any Pimble machine of all time but I can only have one machine and I just got this tails of the Ruby night a few months ago and you know I love it I love it and I didn't want to send it away I didn't want to put it in storage and I got offered $9500 for my Ghostbusters Ellie and I have a check for $9500 and that offer was on the table for a couple months a nice deal.

[26:19] A couple months a nice gentleman is buying it in New Jersey and I just want to say to all you pin sight people out there when I duplicate a count it and was selling my Ghostbusters Ellie for $9500 before the thread was deleted by the moderation staff.

[26:38] I just want to say to like KPG to all you guys out there who who slammed me who said that the hype had moved away from Ghostbusters Ellie that I would never get that amount that I think I got like 14 downloads on the asking price I just want to tell you guys wake up come back to reality you are not the only people buying Pimble machines out there this thing was swooped up immediately this guy has no idea who what pin sight is and I want you guys also to read the story.

[27:08] I realize a real lesson here the majority people don't give a shit how you guys hate the fact that people try to make more money on their pins they try to flip him quickly this guy is like very probably ex like wealthy lawyer who doesn't really care it doesn't matter to him he just wants his game and he wants it new in box he doesn't want to you think you think people who are successful want to read

[27:32] the same thing is going to happen if Harry Houdini comes out 95% of people will never even be aware of the holes did where Friasco they're going to see this machine and they're going to compare it to what else is out there and they're going to be blown away and it's not going to matter if someone's like hey do you know the guy who designed that like ripped off some people like a few years ago

[27:56] but why would they give a shit they can go buy the game I think you need guys need to just understand it's not all about you and when I say that I want $9500 for Ghostbusters and you slam me and I have a check for $9500 who's to blame my buyer is happy I'm happy the only one who's not happy is pin sight I think all you guys should really really just practice the art of saying

[28:24] do I always have to constantly say something that's like negative do I always have to complain about everything do I use it to slam everyone's for sale threads it gets old it gets old we are in a new golden error of pinball it's not all about American pinball and J pop you know that's what we're focused on right now but there's so much exciting stuff going on we've got alien right around the corner we've got

[28:49] ballers game we've got batman we know what Star Wars is and I have a little Star Wars information that I'll share on my next podcast but we know that Jetsons is coming out we know Domino's is coming out we know that you can get a rub zombie now for not too much more than people paid MSRP we'll be three might come out big

[29:09] Bowsky is shipping hobbit is shipping Star Wars is around the corner arrow Smith is coming out and there's also a way you're going to be able to see the arrow Smith art and play field at expo I know where it's hidden and I'm going to tell you next time maybe if you're nice to

[29:25] Canada I'll let you know but it's going to be shown at expo in a way that they didn't expect I might reveal that but my point is this this is what everybody wanted this is what fueled all of what happened

[29:41] since like 2011 till now people just want options they want a lot of pinball machines they want they love pinball they love sing a new machine

[29:50] so don't crucify tim when he walks into a room and sees a new J pop machine that he has stars in his eyes we all looked at this machine and we had a little bit of those stars in our eyes you cannot help but get excited by a new J pop pinball machine it doesn't mean we agree with it it doesn't mean we'll buy it it doesn't mean we don't

[30:08] fucking hate the guy for what he did but it's still exciting it doesn't matter there's no way around it we're on a pinball forum we are in the pinball hobby any new pinball machine will be looked at with some level of

[30:22] excitement I think everyone should just learn to be a little bit nicer to each other all right be nicer to each other there's so much

[30:30] bickering back and forth and it just it gets old it gets old and if you want to help your friends out and if you want your friends you got burned by J pop to see some sort of restitution your only option right now your only option to get those people

[30:46] resolved to heal their pain is to just let American pinball fulfill what they're saying they're going to do if you burn them right now and force them away

[30:57] and if wise know how to way and like kept them from expo and like and and and and like and like denied them the ability to do anything then those people are for sure screw there are 100% they're going to get fucked so everyone all of this is going to be resolved in three weeks so I implore all of you to just chill out a little bit just a little bit and I look forward to seeing you guys an expo and I look forward to seeing you guys like when we're in an elevator ride in the west end and guys don't even know what I'm doing right now

[31:27] I don't even say hi to me like I know who you are like just say hi to be nice be nice of bird the hatchet with oric I've bird the hatchet with like anyone I've had issues with I even bird the hatchet with beasel boom man I sent the guy and know it I said man I'm sorry I'm sorry for being a dick to you and like and like threatening you when I got mad because you said something about my girlfriend if I see you at a show like there's no beef man like it's just fucking pinball all right and let's see what happens over the next three weeks

[31:57] hug each other love each other and play some fucking pinball I'm going to march you peach you in 15 minutes and I'm going to ask

[32:06] the ancient Incas what they think of the fucking silver ball everyone good night
