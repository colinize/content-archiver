[00:00] 

[00:30] Remember this when it becomes Twippy Voting Time.

[00:32] All right, so here's how I'm gonna do this.

[00:34] So here's how tonight went down.

[00:36] I'm about to have dinner with Brenda.

[00:38] I've got the food on the plate.

[00:40] I've got the plate on my lap.

[00:41] I'm about to eat with my wife.

[00:44] I get a text message.

[00:45] Chris, I have Jaws details.

[00:48] I said, baby, I gotta go.

[00:50] I ran into the other room.

[00:51] I got my computer and I just started taking notes.

[00:55] Now what I'm gonna do is this.

[00:57] I am going to read for you my notes

[01:00] as they were told to me.

[01:02] And it might be a little bit all over the place.

[01:04] And here's why.

[01:05] Is this person was so excited by what they saw.

[01:08] And imagine trying to tell someone

[01:10] what Keith Elwyn Jaws pinball is like

[01:14] by looking at the photos.

[01:15] Like where do you start?

[01:17] You kinda jump all over the place.

[01:19] And even though this is gonna jump all over the place,

[01:22] you are going to get specific details

[01:25] that are going to come true in the game.

[01:28] And just remember when you hear this stuff

[01:31] and you take it to pin side

[01:33] and you take it to the Facebook groups

[01:35] and you take it to the other media channels.

[01:37] Just remember to say, Canada, all right?

[01:40] Before I get into the details, I just wanna say this.

[01:43] The person who saw this said that this is going to be

[01:47] Keith Elwyn's masterpiece.

[01:49] Everybody who's been involved with this game

[01:52] is super excited.

[01:53] It was made by people that are tremendously excited

[01:57] about this theme.

[01:58] I've always said you gotta make a game

[02:01] from the ground up with people who are passionate

[02:04] about the theme.

[02:06] This is definitely a game that you can't reskin

[02:09] into Looney Tunes or Halloween or anything else.

[02:13] This is Jaws pinball through and throughout.

[02:16] All right, so let's just get started.

[02:18] These are my notes.

[02:19] And again, it's gonna be all over the place

[02:21] because this person was excited.

[02:23] Again, just imagine if they're in your shoes,

[02:25] where do you start describing a pinball machine?

[02:27] We are going to start with the armor.

[02:30] I know you're like, oh, Chris, come on,

[02:31] we're gonna start with the most boring thing.

[02:33] All right, so you're hearing all of this first.

[02:35] The Jaws armor on the Ellie of the game,

[02:39] the color of the armor is going to be white.

[02:43] On this game, the Ellie armor on Jaws Ellie,

[02:47] this is cool.

[02:48] On each side, it's going to look like a shark

[02:51] has taken a bite out of the armor on the game.

[02:55] White armor, shark bite on each side of the armor.

[02:59] The premium will come with black armor

[03:02] that has the angled armor like James Bond Ellie

[03:05] and Godzilla Ellie.

[03:07] It's got that angled cut that protects the cabinet.

[03:09] So you're gonna get a nicer version

[03:12] of the armor on the premium as well.

[03:15] And I'm also here to tell you that I am hearing

[03:17] there is no price increase on this game.

[03:20] So this game is gonna cost the same amount of money

[03:23] as James Bond and Foo Fighters.

[03:25] All right, so let's keep going.

[03:26] In terms of the play field,

[03:28] you are going to see two main characters from the movie

[03:32] predominantly featured on the play field of Jaws.

[03:35] They are in the middle of the game.

[03:37] They are in the middle of the game real big

[03:40] next to each other.

[03:41] You are gonna see illustrated artwork

[03:44] featuring two characters, Quint and Hooper.

[03:47] So Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfus's characters

[03:50] are going to be the predominant characters

[03:53] on the play field and no Brody Roy Scheider's character

[03:57] will not be on the play field.

[04:00] The rumors that his estate was really difficult

[04:03] and would not give permission is true in artistic format.

[04:07] But even though he does not appear in art form

[04:10] on the play field, I am hearing there will be clips of him

[04:14] on the LCD screen.

[04:16] That is what I am hearing that he will be in the game itself

[04:19] but you most likely won't hear his voice

[04:22] or hear call outs from him, which is interesting.

[04:25] You know who they're gonna get to say,

[04:26] smile you son of a, you know what?

[04:29] So that's the predominant artwork on the game.

[04:32] Let's talk a little bit about the Ellie artwork.

[04:35] On the right side is Jaws underwater

[04:38] and all these people's legs.

[04:40] Okay, so we're gonna see Jaws and he's underwater.

[04:43] It's not just gonna be the movie poster face.

[04:45] I think you're gonna see the full shark

[04:47] and then all these people's legs.

[04:49] And then on the other side,

[04:51] we're gonna see Jaws swimming at us.

[04:53] So that's what I'm hearing is on the Ellie artwork.

[04:56] So the rumors I heard of just having the woman

[04:58] swimming on it, it's not gonna be the Ellie artwork.

[05:01] I was not told what was on the artwork

[05:03] for the premium and the pro,

[05:05] but I was told that they all look kind of similar

[05:08] and they all look really good.

[05:09] I was also told that the pro cabinet actually looks the best.

[05:14] This is something Stern's been doing recently.

[05:16] They've sort of been putting really nice artwork

[05:18] on the pro packages because they wanna sell

[05:21] as many of those as possible.

[05:23] I'm also hearing the translate for the Ellie of the game

[05:27] is going to be the iconic movie poster of Jaws

[05:32] with the woman swimming and Jaws coming up

[05:35] from below the surface.

[05:36] So when you walk up to this game,

[05:38] it is going to telegraph right at you

[05:41] the iconic movie poster everybody loves.

[05:44] All right, here's where the good stuff starts.

[05:46] I'm here to confirm for you that there will be

[05:50] an upper playfield in this game and Canada was right.

[05:54] It is on the upper left side of the game

[05:57] and the upper playfield is the butt of the Orca ship.

[06:01] So I was right, the upper playfield is the Orca.

[06:05] The Orca will also feature one flipper.

[06:09] So it's going to be a one flipper upper playfield.

[06:12] The very center of the game is the big shark.

[06:16] And here's how Jaws is going to work.

[06:19] This is what I was told.

[06:20] Jaws is going to be a bash toy.

[06:23] And when Jaws is underwater, you don't see the shark.

[06:27] What there will be is a Newton ball

[06:29] that's on the playfield that you have to hit.

[06:33] And if you hit it enough times,

[06:35] then Jaws will pop up from underneath the playfield.

[06:39] So you heard it here first, a shark, a big shark

[06:44] with a Newton ball on top of its head,

[06:47] a kinetic shot that you're going to hit over and over.

[06:49] And then Jaws is going to pop up

[06:51] and you're going to bash Jaws.

[06:54] How awesome does that sound?

[06:56] All right, here's another thing that's news to everybody.

[06:59] Instead of three barrels,

[07:01] I am hearing there is only one barrel in the game

[07:05] and the barrel will be featured

[07:07] to the right of Jaws on the playfield.

[07:10] And apparently like you hit the barrel

[07:11] and I guess there's like some plastic

[07:13] where you're trying to light three barrels.

[07:15] So instead of doing three barrels, Stern is doing one.

[07:19] What I heard was there was originally supposed to be

[07:22] three barrels that went below the playfield.

[07:24] But I think that idea was scrapped by Stern pinball.

[07:27] I'm hearing like the middle to down low of the playfield

[07:30] is a little barren,

[07:31] but I'm hearing the back of the playfield

[07:33] is absolutely packed.

[07:35] There is a vertical up kick that is near the orca.

[07:39] Here's another brand new piece of information

[07:41] between the orca and the shark.

[07:44] They said this is a little bit of a weird thing.

[07:47] There is a chumb bucket mechanism in the game.

[07:50] So you're going to see a sculpted chumb bucket

[07:53] that has a pinkish color that is in the game.

[07:56] Remember people, I talked to someone who played this game,

[07:58] but the details on the gameplay are very vague.

[08:01] Most of the information I got is all about

[08:04] what's on the machine itself.

[08:05] So I just wanted to know what the details were.

[08:07] So I will try to get more information from you

[08:10] on gameplay itself.

[08:11] So there's going to be a chumb bucket

[08:13] that is a pinkish color that is between the orca

[08:16] and the shark.

[08:17] It's obviously a shot where you're going to want to fill up

[08:19] the chumb bucket and get ready to go get some jaws.

[08:23] Now look, there's an upper playfield flipper.

[08:25] There's also going to be three other flippers in the game.

[08:29] It is going to be a total of a four flipper game.

[08:32] The third flipper on the lower playfield

[08:34] is on the left side of the game.

[08:37] And that's going to be a flipper you use to bash

[08:39] into the barrel that's in the upper right of the game.

[08:43] There's also going to be two ramps in this game

[08:46] and lots of wire forms.

[08:48] I heard there's like wire forms going into the orca.

[08:51] Again, just going off of photos,

[08:53] it seems like that orca upper playfield

[08:55] might actually lift up and down

[08:58] kind of like the building in Godzilla.

[09:01] I'm not 100% sure about that, but that might mean

[09:04] it could be what I said where the orca is like taking

[09:07] on water and sinking as you're playing the game,

[09:10] which will open up different ball pathways when you're playing.

[09:14] Again, all of this is so super cool.

[09:16] I'm just so excited just giving you guys this information.

[09:19] All right, so I don't know if it's a Newton ball

[09:20] or a trapped pinball on top of Jaws' head

[09:23] because I'm reading this again and it says,

[09:25] there are two rubber posts with a trapped ball,

[09:28] a Newton ball on top of the shark's head.

[09:31] You hit it hard a few times and the shark pops up.

[09:34] I'm also hearing that there is no fin

[09:37] that comes up from underneath the playfield.

[09:40] That was another idea that might have been scrapped

[09:43] somewhere along development.

[09:45] All right, there is a ramp up to the orca from the right.

[09:49] The ball can exit the orca from two ways.

[09:52] Wire forms on both sides.

[09:54] Game looks really, really busy.

[09:57] Someone was talking again to someone who's involved

[09:59] with the making of this game and they said,

[10:01] this is their all-time favorite game.

[10:04] The game is ripping killer and Keith Elwin's best to date.

[10:07] I'm just reading you what I was told, people.

[10:10] The Jaws hype train has officially left the station.

[10:13] Now, the game is supposed to come out in January.

[10:16] So does that mean the reveal is gonna be in January

[10:20] or will Stern reveal this game in December

[10:22] and then the game is on the line in January?

[10:25] We shall see.

[10:26] Most of the playfield is blue.

[10:28] Duh, it's a Jaws pinball machine,

[10:30] but here's another interesting thing.

[10:32] To the right of Quint and Hooper in the game,

[10:36] there is going to be a piece of the playfield

[10:39] that is transparent.

[10:41] All of what we see in James Bond,

[10:44] creature from the black lagoon.

[10:46] So it's gonna be like a transparent blue piece of plastic

[10:50] where you can see underneath it.

[10:52] So that is leading us to believe

[10:54] that you're gonna be able to see

[10:56] like Jaws swimming underneath the ocean.

[10:59] So maybe that's where the fin appears.

[11:01] Maybe they're gonna use that to simulate

[11:03] the ocean turning blood red when Jaws has the advantage.

[11:07] Look for that blue plastic that's transparent

[11:09] and something is underneath.

[11:10] And the final thing that was weird,

[11:12] the people I was talking to,

[11:13] they were having a hard time explaining

[11:16] how this thing functions.

[11:17] In the upper right of the game,

[11:19] it looks like there is a spinning disc,

[11:22] a la the Avengers.

[11:24] Unlike the Avengers in which it's on the playfield,

[11:27] this was lifted above the playfield.

[11:30] So look for a spinning right Avengers-like disc

[11:34] in the upper right side of the game.

[11:37] And ladies and gentlemen,

[11:38] that is all of the information I have

[11:40] for you right now on Jaws Pinball.

[11:43] So we're gonna have a major mechanical shark

[11:46] that comes up from under the playfield.

[11:48] The Orca as an upper playfield.

[11:50] We've never seen Keith Elwin do

[11:52] in upper playfield with a flipper.

[11:54] We're gonna have a yellow barrel that you bash,

[11:57] a shark that you bash,

[11:58] a boat where you're gonna be bashing something

[12:00] with the flipper, multiple ramps, a vertical up kick.

[12:03] You know there's gonna be a magnet somewhere in there.

[12:06] We've got a spinner from Avengers.

[12:08] And this game just sounds packed already.

[12:10] I mean, think about it, like in Elton John,

[12:12] where are the mechs?

[12:13] In Galactic Tank Force, where are the mechs?

[12:15] You want it, mechs.

[12:17] You want it, toys.

[12:18] You want it, a world under glass.

[12:19] And I think this game is gonna deliver it like no other.

[12:22] I'm so happy I'm in on a Jaws LE.

[12:24] After hearing what this game is going to look like,

[12:27] I think it's gonna be an instant sell out.

[12:29] And unfortunately for all of us complaining about prices,

[12:32] this is what Stern New is coming.

[12:34] I've said it, wait and see.

[12:35] You know what, after hearing about this game,

[12:38] I'm not sure I would wait.

[12:39] I would be calling up your distributors tomorrow

[12:41] and try to get an LE spot,

[12:43] because they're gonna go like hotcakes.

[12:44] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[12:46] You got two shows in one day.

[12:48] Just remember how much I love you.

[12:49] And every time I get this information,

[12:51] I'm gonna get it to my fans and my subscribers first.

[12:54] And you're the first people on planet earth

[12:56] getting this information.

[12:57] Everybody, peace out.

[12:59] Go get your Jaws.

[13:00] I'm so happy I'm in on a Jaws.

[13:02] I'm so happy I'm in on a Jaws.

[13:04] I'm so happy I'm in on a Jaws.
