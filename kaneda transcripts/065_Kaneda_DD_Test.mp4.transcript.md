[00:00] Grown men rolling die gotta get through the dungeon to beat the dragons.

[00:09] Alright, we're doing a little test here. Let me share this link with the dingbats. My dingbat motley crew fans. It's the share.

[00:18] Copy link. We can talk a little pinball who amongst you plays D&D in your old age.

[00:27] Billion dollar franchise. It's like I don't know who plays it has anyone ever met anyone who plays D&D as an adult.

[00:35] We are pretty positive those people are not procreating though. So it's probably the last generation of D&D fans.

[00:42] You know, go into a bar and be like, yo dude, it's like last night's D&D game was crazy. Okay, never gonna hear that.

[00:50] Let's get people in here, Brenna. Don't look at me like that.

[00:54] Babe, it's she's going. She's got 15 minutes. Just let me do my test. Relax. Calm your horses.

[01:01] Cheese. Cheese Louise. Cheese Louise.

[01:07] Alright, testing show. Show for D&D tomorrow. Come join. Come join and let's chat.

[01:17] Alright, let's see what it is.

[01:21] DDDD. Look, I got Roy's in the house.

[01:26] Roy best wishes you two, man. It's going to be a good year.

[01:30] Every day above ground is a good day as pit bull says, Mr. 405 is a 405, Brenda.

[01:36] Is that his zip code? No, it's not. Is it? Is it 405? 305? Huh? What's in the 405?

[01:45] I should be Mr. 405 and just go live wherever that is and like one up one up pit bull.

[01:54] Scott Jones. Alright, guys, I'm going to try something in a second.

[01:58] You let me know if this works because I'm going to.

[02:03] I'm going to use this tomorrow to look at Stern Pimball's D&D launch with everybody live.

[02:10] You know, I had those big technical complications when I did the the Canadian.

[02:15] Who does award by the way?

[02:17] His world famous now where it's.

[02:28] Okay.

[02:31] Alright, can you guys tell me.

[02:34] If you see, I'm going to share screen and I'm going to go.

[02:41] Here.

[02:46] Alright.

[02:50] Alright, can you guys see? Okay, can you see me?

[02:56] Can you see the Stern screen and.

[03:01] Man, me talking. I'm going to play the video. Let me know if you can see me talking.

[03:06] You can can you see both now.

[03:08] Here.

[03:13] Can you hear their screen with me?

[03:20] I love it.

[03:33] I love it.

[03:40] It anyone hasn't deciphered.

[03:44] Did anyone.

[03:47] Your audio is low when the trailer is playing.

[03:50] That's fine. I'm not going to talk over anything.

[03:53] So that's fine. Is the audio better now?

[03:57] Yeah, I made the video audio loud so we can lower that a little bit.

[04:01] But how's my audio now? Is it good?

[04:05] Man, I'm like.

[04:07] I'm like excited to see this thing. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

[04:12] Do we think it's positive?

[04:19] It does look like the attack from Mars Dragon, right? Let's just keep this up.

[04:28] Disappearing.

[04:37] What do you guys think? You think this dragon eats the ball?

[04:40] Man, I love the way you read that description yesterday really cracked me up.

[04:46] You're right. I mean, it was like the nerdiest thing I've ever read.

[04:51] And it's like these grown men are like, yeah, man, I'm totally into D&D.

[04:55] And you're like, yeah, man, can't wait to grab the amulet that features little gemstones that lets the Necromancer pause.

[05:03] The Necromancer skills in the third left tunnel of the trolls left wing.

[05:09] You know, it's like, what the heck is this stuff? Welcome to D&D people.

[05:15] I think balls will release from its mouth, but can't shoot it in.

[05:20] Well, that makes sense though, right? That makes sense.

[05:24] The balls should fire from the dragon like he's firing a flame, right?

[05:30] The flame doesn't go into his mouth. So it does look like the mouth has a ramp there with no lower teeth.

[05:38] And it's going to open up.

[05:40] But it looks, I don't know, just looking at it right now.

[05:44] It does look like it's going to look more like it's vomiting pinballs at us.

[05:53] But we shall see. It definitely looks like there's the three bank target below the dragon.

[06:00] How's the audio, by the way? Is it popping at all? Because when I did my show, I'm wondering if I'm just too close to it.

[06:05] If I need to just, let's see.

[06:08] I don't get really any audio settings on YouTube, but hopefully it sounds all right. How's it sound?

[06:14] Dragon maybe eats the ball. Why would the dragon eat the ball? I don't think so.

[06:21] It does feel like we're going to get a fan layout.

[06:25] And that is seemingly Brian Eddie's thing.

[06:30] I'm on Facebook now and all the, it's interesting seeing all the dealers, right?

[06:37] They're already trying to get the film going.

[06:40] Order yours today. Order here. Order there.

[06:43] There's so many dealers and distros now.

[06:46] And it's funny how they're just all going to spam us as if we're unaware.

[06:52] So I just encourage each and every one of you just absolutely enjoy the reveal.

[06:58] Don't order anything on Friday. Trust me, the game's not going to sell out.

[07:03] What the game is going to do, it's going to sell through every single distro is going to grab their LEDs that they get.

[07:09] They have a certain allotment. They're going to buy them.

[07:13] The game is going to technically sell through a K a sell out, but that doesn't mean that those dealers have found customers for all 740 units at 13,000 a pop.

[07:24] They're not going to find customers for all those on day one.

[07:27] The other thing is this don't go off of Stern's website thinking the game is like moving like hotcakes.

[07:34] They only release about five to 10 games at most sold directly through Stern.

[07:40] And they do that on purpose to sort of say that it sold out again, not an indication of how popular the game is every single game.

[07:49] John Wicc included venom included every single game is an instant sell out on Stern's website.

[07:57] Okay, spooky didn't even sell out of evil dead. You're right, man.

[08:01] It's crazy when you think about it. Everything that's like the reason why spooky did not sell out of evil dead is it's because it's evil dead.

[08:10] Let's be honest folks that movie is not hugely popular with most of us.

[08:16] Okay, I've seen it. You've seen it. Do you watch it over and over again. Dungeons and Dragons is a much better theme for pinball than evil dead.

[08:27] And you know, as much as evil dead looks amazing and the mexico like all it's cool.

[08:32] It's but it's still evil dead like do you want to own in evil dead game. Do you want to watch those movie clips over and over and over again.

[08:39] I don't I don't D&D is a better theme. It's a bigger franchise. It's way bigger. It's way bigger.

[08:47] The thing about look the thing about D&D being nerdy. Yeah, like but it's not going to go into that level of nerdyness.

[08:55] They're going to take thematically D&D and take the elements of D&D but it's not going to be the way you experience it when you play the game in real life.

[09:08] You know the the game on a table with the books and all the descriptions and all the die wrong like it's not going to be nearly as nerdy as that.

[09:18] All right, so like I've seen evil dead one into 200 times. All right. Well cool man. Look, here's a good news.

[09:25] If you're obsessed with evil dead, you are very happy with that title.

[09:30] But the reason evil dead hasn't sold out yet. That was the point I'm responding to. The reason evil dead has not sold out yet is because of the theme.

[09:41] I mean, they put everything and the kitchen sink into the game. So why didn't they sell 800 and you know whatever 80 of them because of the theme when they release goonies, which is next goonies will sell out day one goonies will sell out in the first hour.

[10:02] And then goonies spots will be sold for more than MSRP within one day of reveal. You understand what I mean there. See how that works with the theme in popularity and having an emotional connection to a theme matters a lot.

[10:19] So and with a big pirate ship and what's going to be in goonies going to be a way bigger response than evil dead.

[10:27] I bet evil dead will sell out by Canada day. Okay. Well, I don't know who knows. Here's the reason why I don't think they sold the last I don't know like 50 or 100 of them is because I think everyone is also aware that once spooky makes 400 of them.

[10:45] It's going to be easy to cut the line get one for less money and why would you want to be at the end of the line because that's the problem and remember the deposits are non refundable.

[10:55] So if you give your roof the if you go in now on an evil dead and you're at the end of the line you can't get your money back and you're going to watch people be able to buy the game you want in front of you and for less money.

[11:12] So that is why the later deposits are really the last place you want to be with a boutique deposit and I think the same thing might be true with Alice is adventures and wonderland.

[11:25] You know you want to either get your game early enjoy the game or you want to just wait and get it on the second hand market that's what's going to happen.

[11:34] It's what happens with all these boutique games and you know they're going to bring some games to the show and you're going to be able to cut the line there and then people are going to like you think about like this people might want D&D over evil dead people who put the positives down on evil dead are going to then by the time they're evil dead is even on the line gang they're going to see D&D they're going to see kinkong they're going to see Harry Potter they're going to see you know maybe

[12:03] gremlins from barrels whatever barrels is next game is so that's the thing too is you know it's going to take them six months to get halfway through the builds of evil dead and by the time your game is up you might want something else and you might not have room and you might not you know have enough money to buy two games in one year.

[12:24] If spooky was smart they wouldn't limit goonies Josh come on don't don't don't say things they need every game needs to have a limit with these boutique companies you know it's it without that then no one goes in if you make an unlimited amount of goonies then why would anyone rush the buy one if you're going to make them forever you need to have some sort of phomo built into these boutique companies you can't just yeah I look I do think they should I just

[12:54] do agree with you they should limit the number of C.E.s this whole like will make as many C.E.s as people want and then every single game is a C.E. and then you know the highest trim version is the most made version is not really the I don't know it but again like I like what they're doing with evil dead there's no trim levels right there's just one there's just one version so just make one version of goonies and make whatever 800 or a thousand and let that

[13:23] game be forever in demand that is the way to do it you don't want to burn your customers you want to make it when you building a brand pinball company brand you want everyone is bought your products to feel like they're part of some club and I also think what's become ridiculous in pinball is that nobody has nobody and I mean it's not Jersey jack not stirring not spooky nobody nobody has rewarded

[13:53] consistent long term buyers with the ability to get first dibs on new games think about how silly that is that I asked this of sub Davis and George Gomez and Gary Stern I was in the room with them have you ever given anybody who's bought two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in your product have you ever given them the ability to buy a game without having to wait online without having to maybe miss out on it they've never done that

[14:22] and the same is true with like spooky yeah you can be part of the fan club but I mean it when I say this like anyone who buys an evil dead gets first dibs at goonies imagine if they said that anybody who's bought three or more spooky titles never has to wait on line again

[14:40] imagine if they said that you know there's absolutely no loyalty you know I go to one of my favorite restaurants and there might be a line outside every day I don't wait online because I go all the time and like Chris you're a normal you know you're one of our best customers and we want to make it so you don't have to wait like everybody else

[15:00] because you've shown us loyalty and spend a lot of money with us and the new people online are brand new they don't deserve to get the same treatment as you

[15:11] but there is no system like that because there is no marketing that is focused on the customer for the most part the world of marketing and pinball completely is just not none existing it's existing let's get to a different screen here

[15:27] there we go

[15:29] do you guys want to look at dnd or me I don't even know why I'm sharing I'm not showing you anything

[15:37] all right so if you're a member of the Canadian club you got some good exclusive info today

[15:47] it's how I do it people I don't wait I don't wait I don't need to like I don't I don't need to do things on a schedule I don't even need to do things with fact checking I just I got a little birdie whispered in my ear this morning what's the next

[16:03] Pajradi gaming title

[16:06] okay can a did did stern do the Metallica animations I believe so I don't think they brought in anybody from outside I don't think those are from Metallica I don't know if

[16:20] Metallica has like a cartoon or those animations were further concert but I believe those were all done by stern

[16:27] outsource you probably Josh I mean look it makes total sense for them to work with vendors and other studios that are out there for animations I think that's smart I don't think you

[16:44] should rely only on in house animators when you're making a pinball machine stern animations are a joke compared to Jersey Jack and spooky I don't agree

[16:59] with that Engleberg Humper Denk from Princess Brad I think you're wrong on that you think spooky animations are better than the stuff that's

[17:11] happening in X-Men and in Godzilla and in no spooky animations are not better than Sterns there's not a single spooky game with better animations JJP's animations are really good

[17:27] what JJP has done well is they've sort of they just have a beautiful big screen you know JP to win really you know makes everything look really nice and polished I wouldn't say like you know some of the

[17:45] G&R animations are really cool I wouldn't say like their mind blowing you know like when the gun revolver fires what your bonuses or the extra ball or

[17:57] slashes solo comes up like they're they're really good to me the best animations I've ever seen I'm just going to be candid here the best on screen animations I think I've

[18:11] seen in a game that just made me feel like more modern pinball should be like this are the animations in dialed in to me dialed in like what's on that screen for the first time I felt like someone

[18:27] used the big screen in the right way and dialed in real it just it just such a it just all looks so nice thinking about what the theme is and the city and like I just love dialed in

[18:39] animations and it felt like they worked hard on them we got a question can't wait for a DNA tomorrow yes I can't wait either I hope you guys all hang out here it's

[18:51] gonna be right here we're gonna do it right on the YouTube channel gonna do it starting at noon eastern standard time it's Friday it's the last Friday before I really go back to work I think I might

[19:05] have to pour some of my famous Manhattan cocktails I think we should sauce up this drag in a little bit what do you think you think we should do this like completely sober we should get a few in us and set some pinball records we got 26 lonely men right now with

[19:20] canada talking about pinball and YouTube this is it this is gonna be like in my retirement remember you guys I tried to monetize this thing I don't know how to meet the criteria for YouTube monetization I will try to figure it out again I don't know what I'm

[19:35] doing wrong everybody make sure you subscribe to canada's YouTube channel the let's see what else I'm trying to read what you guys are saying here there are lots of animations houses and yeah guys we don't need like guys the world has

[19:49] like hundreds of thousands of animators out there like I love out pinball people think the world is like there's not that many good artists for you guys are like out of your minds you do realize that a graphic designer let me just

[20:03] tell you something right now a graphic designer at my company most likely a senior one in the in the marketing ad world makes more money than Keith L.

[20:12] Wynne all right they make more money than Eric Minier they make way more money than all your pinball designers I think it's funny how in this myopic space we don't realize like what real

[20:25] skill and real talent is is paid so you guys like just don't get it like pinball design is tiny in terms of like the need for it where the need for like

[20:40] good designers that are working on like multi million dollar programs blows away these you know these people that we hold up as like gods and dieties in this pinball space so yeah no Josh right does tons of great ones

[20:59] and I think what's funny to me is like pinball is nice like it's a nice side it would be like a side hustle for really talented designers and artists it wouldn't be their focus but you know it much like you know all artists they struggle to have consistent work

[21:19] do do do then why does the same artist do every single play if it like I I agree I agree I I think the artist should be selected based on the theme and I don't think they should just keep giving every theme to every artist now the reason why

[21:42] I think she in a lot of ways is is is a is a better option for that strategy is like he just takes the source material and makes it look really good see we're like yet he's an illustrator man and like he's incredibly talented but you know his illustration style isn't always ideal for every theme he has to do it's like he's really good when it comes to comic book style

[22:11] style stuff Godzilla isn't my favorite like I don't think he should have been used for Godzilla his art style again it's not what Godzilla art looks like when you look at all the iconic Godzilla posters and how you think about Toho Godzilla you know I don't think that was the right match up and like so that's what's interesting right as we get towards King Kong

[22:36] and King Kong has those iconic movie posters from yesterday years that's what King Kong pinball should look like not newly illustrated Kong so you know the thing is this though it's like you know there are also these companies are

[22:56] they they they they want to do things more consistently because there's more cost effectiveness there so you know yet he is now employee

[23:04] I'm not looking at the thing is with stern making three cornerstones a year across a variety of themes there's always going to be more than enough work for zombie Eddie on an annual basis.

[23:14] For ten games announced release this year how many this year so look on mighty yogurt I love these names almighty yogurt I feel like I'm talking to you guys on a very personal level

[23:30] Ingleberg a Humper dink and almighty yogurt are really standing out right now as as phenomenal YouTube names I think we get just as many games this year if not more

[23:42] and I think you know we're going to see I don't think we're going to see anything new from American pinball that Ryan McQuade post was was really sad to see I hope Ryan really has a better year this year than he did last year

[23:58] I don't even know where to start with what I'm assuming it's a mixture of personal and professional and I also just think those two things are combined like when you become a pinball designer your professional world and your personal life are one.

[24:13] And so I don't think we're going to see cuphead but I do think we're going to see more games from pinball brothers from hydrady gaming I think you know turner pinball might have another game I think we're going to definitely see more from spooky we're going to see everyone's going to come out.

[24:27] I think we might see two from Jersey Jack Harry Potter is going to be so popular though I don't know if they're going to be able to like get another game out by the end of the year.

[24:37] I think it's going to be really exciting I think stern is going to start doing more remix.

[24:42] Do you want a little bit of an exclusive on you know right now for all you guys who hopefully will hear this and then sign up for the Canadian club.

[24:50] How about this I'll give you guys an exclusive right now what I've heard all right you ready.

[24:55] Don't share this don't share this don't give this to carry hearty and then carry is going to you know say oh yeah I don't know why people are hearing this I don't know where people are hearing this hearing it right here carry after Keith L. Wins King Kong.

[25:11] The next two stern cornerstone games will be John Borg games.

[25:21] John Borg two cornerstones in a row so Kong.

[25:28] Now here's what I think that might mean.

[25:32] We'll see maybe one is drawn and they're considering in a cornerstone and maybe one is something else but if you think about it.

[25:40] I mean Borg hasn't really had a new game in a long time like what was the last new John Borg game was it rush.

[25:49] Right is it in my wrong was it rush.

[25:55] Huh I don't I think so.

[26:01] We got orbiter Albert in the house Albert do not waste money and go to stern pimp all on Tuesday I keep telling my media friends why are you guys going to waste money.

[26:10] Here's what here's what's sad to me is like you guys are going to waste money and fly to freaking freezing cold Chicago to go into a corporate sort of no man's land area of Chicago to go see dungeons and dragons.

[26:27] You you you you fool should fly to Vegas see stern should be flying you guys to Vegas a special guest of CES they should put you up in hotel rooms.

[26:38] And they should actually roll out the red carpet for the main content creators for their industry that's what everybody else does in the tech world that's what everyone else is doing all my friends in tech media are going to CES they're all like you know they're not being treated like slubs.

[26:58] And you guys are funny you're like you're going to you're going to spend your own money to go to stern pimp all and get the be tore of the game because isn't everyone else going to be at CES while you guys are in Chicago.

[27:12] And the fact that you're going to spend your own money is comical to me because that game is going to be shipped out to distros like real soon.

[27:22] I just like I just like go ahead man you guys are all wasting hundreds of dollars when they paid for your travel for john wick.

[27:29] And and and again like I just think it's comical that you know you let them get away with this you let them and you know I get it you want to be a part of something you want to feel special but how does that make any of you feel special.

[27:44] You have to take money at your own pocket I also don't think you could launch game at a worst time than right now I don't know about all of you but man how many of you are looking at what you spent during the holidays.

[27:56] And feeling like alright now is the time to sort of like tight in the bell for a little bit you drink less eat less spend less like new year like new you resolutions.

[28:07] It's probably the worst week in the entire fiscal year to ask people to spend another 13 thousand dollars and then 10 thousand for unlimited premiums I just don't like the timing.

[28:21] I don't think CES is important to sell pinball machines I don't think pinball like pops out at a show like that and I just think that most people probably have had the most expensive holidays they've had.

[28:36] Because the world is so expensive now people I don't know about you but every time I go anywhere.

[28:41] 100 dollars here 100 dollars there big Macs or like 15 20 dollars for a big Mac meal like the world of dollar menus is over the I you know most people haven't had a good pay increase in forever.

[28:53] So I don't know like maybe all y'all are just swimming in it and got great year in bonuses but I also like the world now like people don't get their bonuses anymore like you know.

[29:05] I don't know if the bonus is anymore like in December they get them in like Q one so my company most company is like March you know this like they wait for the first quarter to do it.

[29:17] It's weird Josh because like as much as like the economy is not in good shape the stock market is through the roof you know I was just looking into it like I bought some Ethereum and I didn't even check it out I I lost my log in the coin base like oh my god it like double so I'm like OK.

[29:34] So this stuff is done great.

[29:37] This stock market is about to crash I mean Engelberg everyone's been saying that now for the last like eight years the stock markets about the crash remember when COVID hit everyone's like it's over the recessions here and then everyone made fortune you know and they keep making fortune.

[29:54] It's fine tax returns see see I'm going to owe on taxes because I have to pay for my podcast taxes.

[30:03] I'm going to crash it's not going to crash I just don't think people want to spend money in January on Pimble I I could be wrong.

[30:13] I don't think it's a good time I I don't think it's a good time I think a lot of people go away to warm weather vacations and they look for other things to spend money on so I don't know.

[30:29] That's like that's like where I'm at I mean I told you the reason why I'm not buying a Pimble machine right now is I I bought a a I bought Brenda piece of jewelry that costs a Pimble machine so I'm good I'm good I'm good we're about to get the apartment money and I'll be back back to good monthly cash flow the way look at my finances in life people is like I've got my savings I don't dip into that ever use the savings for things that matter like a habit.

[30:58] It matters like a house and a mortgage and you know and like meaningful things that that are appreciating and value.

[31:05] And then I've got like my Pim money right that the phrase Pim money is actually an old phrase from I don't know like 100 or 200 years ago Pim money used to be money that women like they would stick a pin in it and it would be like money that they would use to buy things on the side like your Pim money was your money for you know.

[31:27] Sort of frivolous things that you wanted that you didn't really need and it's ironic that pin money today in modern times.

[31:37] It means the same thing like none of you need another Pimble machine none of you need to spend this much money on a new Pimble experience and I also just think everybody like let's just face it the need to buy a new inbox game week one if you look at the data now statistically the data.

[31:56] Why would you do that knowing that there's a like 90% chance your Ellie is going to lose $3,000 in six months and then there's like you know 75% chance your premium is going to lose like $2,000 in the same time period and really the only good buy is the pro.

[32:15] They flip the whole model people the only game that holds value decently now is the pro on the majority of games and knowing that the pro additions of the games have the same exact code the same experience it really has turned into the pro buyers are the smart guys and they're having more fun because think about it like this two gang a pro machine is the same thing.

[32:43] The real machine is half the price of an elite that is insane it never used to be that so one pro of D&D which will probably have the dragon because they can't remove that dragon if they want to make the game work right.

[33:02] The pro of D&D is the price of two L's and you know the pro machines now have nice artwork if you look if you were up to me and I keep telling us to the stern marketing folks you guys are making the pros two nice.

[33:16] You're making the pros way too nice the artwork is way too nice on the pro the pro should be as pedestrian they should be sand bagging what the cabinet artwork on the pro is like instead they idiotically sometimes make the pro artwork even better.

[33:31] Then the damn premium and I'll eat everything about the pro should be very basic it should be very basic just that you know they should not be putting nearly as much detail into the pro so absolutely crazy this is 7,913 go pro wait I don't I don't know what's going on here.

[33:55] Yeah time check I know my computer is about to die Sarah's got it right you got it 10 o'clock right yeah you got it we got 17 I give me five moments we got the adonovins and that brand inner sister here they're going to go do work.

[34:10] Do you have people I think I have work today but I'm taking off a personal day because I'm old and I need more time to recover and get back into the work mindset don't tell the skimp on the pro they will.

[34:24] Yes like Keith man I'm just being honest man like the pro should look like it should look half as good as the le you know what I'm saying like the truth is this the le buyer now is the ding that the le buyer is the sucker the only le worth buying is either there's only two le's now that are worth buying for the rest of all of what stern does.

[34:54] You only buy an le if it's a remake of a classic like Metallica and you only buy an le if it's Keith L.

[35:04] That's it there is you might as well just forget every other le that they're going to make because it's just not going to hold it's not going to be hard to get and that's that you know so.

[35:18] No it's just so it's a sucker bet Steven you know I look it's not like look if you have money to buy a premium you have money to buy an le and this is what's killing Jersey Jack too with like you know it's funny is Jersey Jack will sell more avatar C.

[35:39] E's then they will avatar Ellie's because if you have twelve thousand dollars to buy an avatar Ellie you have 15 to buy the C.

[35:51] And the C. is way nicer now the problem is this when Harry Potter comes out those avatar C.

[35:58] They're going to be worth less than ten thousand dollars.

[36:03] You know avatar C. E. is just just going to drop like a lead balloon in value.

[36:11] So you know that's that's the reality and and you know the fact that Jersey Jack is teasing Harry Potter and they haven't even shipped a single avatar C.

[36:22] They don't need a customer's I don't even know why they made avatar to be honest they would have sold more pirate if they remade pirates they would have sold more wizard of Oz machines I'm going to say this right now.

[36:34] Jersey Jack if they remade wizard of Oz to coincide with the launch of wicked they would have sold more more wizard of Oz back on the line then avatar.

[36:51] And it's just like avatar is going to go down much like godfather to me those two games barely made any nobody really wants them they're never going to be the staple of a J.J.P. collection none of them did anything unique I mean think about it like what what's the unique thing that they did the armor the taper right that you be lighting doesn't work well.

[37:19] I look it's it's a beautiful game with no personality.

[37:24] That is the reality of avatar.

[37:29] Guns and roses Ellie guns and roses Ellie is the greatest value right now because you can get them for $6,000 and the reason why you can get them for $6,000 is because they made $6,000 of them.

[37:45] Right there is no shortage and what's crazy about G and R.L.E. is hundreds of them I mean this hundreds not like a handful hundreds of them are sitting new in box around the world at dealers and distros.

[38:04] And when you look when you put a G and R.L.E. next to a stern pro or a home pin machine or a Turner pin ball like it's six grand game.

[38:20] It's six grand.

[38:22] It's like it's a no brainer now look now look you know and like a person playing the Ellie is having pretty much just as much fun as someone playing the C as a G and R owner.

[38:33] You know and I love the C.E. I think it's a gorgeous work of art.

[38:38] I think the C.E.s are going to hold around like 11 K maybe a little bit more but they're not going to go below 10 K.

[38:47] There's only 500 and you know the thing the reason why I think the G and R.C.E. isn't like a little bit higher.

[38:57] I don't think the top is nice enough and I mean that like you think about the exclusive things you get.

[39:03] Yes the purple is beautiful the artwork is beautiful the top or on G and R.C.E. isn't really that nice.

[39:11] And the other thing about it is when you hook up pin woofer sound system to guns and roses C.E. which I think everybody has done that by now.

[39:22] So you don't need to unhook the top or speaker. So you're not even using the top or speaker because you don't need it when you hook up pin woofer.

[39:32] But yeah no it's a great time to buy a G and R.L.E. they're going to keep going down.

[39:39] I'm one more minute getting ready I'm going to like I've been saying this recently and people think I'm crazy.

[39:43] You know L.E.s will be worth $5,000 pretty soon.

[39:47] And I keep saying that we're now going to get to the point with the over saturation of games and there's so many games out there.

[39:54] You're going to start to see games that you think you know you we're going to start to see games go into the three and $4,000 range.

[40:03] Where like if you want to move your ultra man it's going to be $3,500 $4,000.

[40:09] And again there's just there's just again if you want to sell it.

[40:13] There's just too many games out there and with brand new L.E.s going for $6,500 you know old or sorry brand brand new pros going for $6,500.

[40:24] There's just going to be so many deals to be had so get ready for if you think you're not going to lose on your $6,000.

[40:34] I don't know I could see G and R.L.E.s hitting $5,500,000 in the next year as well.

[40:41] No there's not going to be a topper. Stern doesn't ever give toppers on L.E.s so don't expect one.

[40:49] You know okay everybody be good I got to go I'm going to clear out this room so people can work because I am working just distracting everybody.

[41:01] Alright everybody I'll see you tomorrow noon.

[41:05] I'll go do today go figure something out. Alright later.
