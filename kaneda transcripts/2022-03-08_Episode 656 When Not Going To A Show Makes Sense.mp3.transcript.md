[00:00] Wow, we've done 656 podcasts about pinball.

[00:24] 656, so if you are ever floating through space and you need to kill a few years, just put

[00:31] on the Canada Pinball Podcast.

[00:33] We are just a couple of weeks away from Texas Pinball Festival.

[00:38] Normally this is a very exciting time in pinball, because normally TPF is the show in which

[00:44] all of the big news happens in pinball, but lately that hasn't been the case.

[00:49] It's still going to be a great show, Ed and Kim put on an amazing show, there are always

[00:55] a ton of machines to play, and you know that the greatest part of these shows is just coming

[01:00] together and it's been a long time since we've all been together.

[01:04] I saw many of you down in Chicago or down over in Chicago for Pinball Expo and that

[01:09] was a lot of fun, but I fully expect TPF to be even more fun than Expo because the facilities

[01:16] and the embassy suites is a lot more better situated than the pinball expo destination

[01:22] because at Expo you couldn't go anywhere, like everything was just in the hotel.

[01:27] I think what's fun about TPF is you're in Frisco, you've got the embassy suites, you've

[01:32] got Perry's Steakhouse, you've got Wildpitch, which is the weirdest and most awkward place

[01:38] to go into because I feel so bad for the women who work there.

[01:42] They're wearing like nothing but they're underwear.

[01:44] It's really creepy getting these pinball guys into that place and watching them look at

[01:49] these women.

[01:50] I don't like it and that is why Canada is going to be at Perry's Steakhouse Friday night.

[01:56] If you want to hang out and grab a beer or a drink, I will be there from 5.30 to 7.30

[02:02] at night doing a little like Canada happy hour, if you will.

[02:05] Now I might see you around the show and I'll happily say hi and we can talk and we can

[02:09] always go grab a drink, but I am dedicating that time.

[02:13] If you don't want to miss Canada and you're going to be at TPF, just come over to Perry's

[02:17] Steakhouse.

[02:18] It's right across the street, 5.30 to 7.30 on Friday night and I will be there and I

[02:24] will be putting everything on your bar tab.

[02:27] No, I'm just joking.

[02:28] I'm just joking.

[02:29] No, everyone will just get their own drinks.

[02:30] This isn't going to be like Canada throwing down thousands of dollars.

[02:33] I've got kids to feed.

[02:35] Now normally as we go into TPF, we're all really excited because there's usually going to be

[02:40] a big game reveal or some big announcement, but I must say this year, there really isn't

[02:46] anything humongous happening at the show other than we're going to see Weird Owl for the

[02:51] first time.

[02:52] Jersey Jack is going to be there with Steve Ritchie at 8 o'clock on Friday night.

[02:57] That's one of the reasons why my happy hour is ending at 7.30 so we can go over there.

[03:03] Now I'm hearing a rumor that the next JJP game will be revealed at MGC, but they might

[03:09] show us some photos at TPF.

[03:12] Now here's what I think will happen.

[03:14] I think if anything, they will just reveal that the game is Toy Story.

[03:20] It is the worst kept secret in Pinball.

[03:23] And so I think Jack will get up there.

[03:25] He'll talk with Steve Ritchie about the future of Jersey Jack Pinball, but Pat Lawler's not

[03:30] going to be there, which is a little strange, right?

[03:32] Because if Toy Story is next, you would think Pat Lawler would be up there, but I also think

[03:37] we're going to get the news any month now that Pat Lawler is retiring from Pinball,

[03:44] that this will be his last game, that this man has had one of the greatest legacy careers

[03:50] in Pinball.

[03:51] He may go down one day as the greatest pinball designer of all time.

[03:56] He's easily the greatest pinball designer from the Balli Williams era, and he's just

[04:00] a man who's made some amazing pinball machines.

[04:03] Now say what you will about the man personally.

[04:05] I hear he's a little cantankerous, but that's Pat Lawler.

[04:09] So many great musicians and artists are really hard to get along with.

[04:14] They take their craft ultra seriously.

[04:17] They don't want to hear any feedback.

[04:19] They do it their way.

[04:21] Sounds a little bit like Canada, right?

[04:23] I mean, if I had a dollar for the amount of times people give me feedback on how to do

[04:26] my show better, I'm like, guys, pick up a mic and let me see you do it better and do

[04:31] 656 podcasts about pinball and keep coming, and then I'll take your advice.

[04:37] All right.

[04:38] So yeah, are we going to see Toy Story?

[04:40] Are they going to tease it or give us a little bit to chew on over at Texas Pinball Festival?

[04:45] I hope so.

[04:46] The other crazy part is this.

[04:49] Mirko Playfields is going to be there.

[04:51] Mirko Playfields is hosting some sort of seminar.

[04:56] Get ready for this title.

[04:57] The forgotten tales.

[05:00] What the hell is this?

[05:02] And I saw this and I'm like, why is Mirko coming to TPF?

[05:06] You know, you have to read the room.

[05:08] You have to have common sense.

[05:09] You have to have some sort of sense of whether or not people want to hear from you.

[05:14] And I don't think anybody, and I mean this, I don't think anybody in pinball wants to

[05:20] hear from Mirko right now.

[05:22] This man has made four Jersey Jack games in a row that have had Playfield issues.

[05:29] Now, calling this the forgotten tales is the forgotten tales alluding to the fact that

[05:35] he's forgotten how to make Playfields that don't chip, that don't fall apart.

[05:40] And this man is told everybody out there to pound sand when you reach out to him about

[05:45] his Playfield quality.

[05:47] So here's the thing.

[05:48] I am going to go to this seminar.

[05:50] I'm going to be very respectful.

[05:52] Don't go to these seminars and heckle people, but I do think if he's going to get up on

[05:57] stage and he's going to do a Q&A period that as a community, we should have some questions

[06:04] to ask him because he can't hide.

[06:06] You know, when you try to reach out to Mirko on Facebook, he ignores you.

[06:10] He doesn't want to talk to you.

[06:12] He escapes the conversation.

[06:15] But this is the part.

[06:16] If you're going to get up on stage at TPF and you're going to field questions from people

[06:21] and you have thousands of customers, and I mean this when I say it, there have been hundreds

[06:26] of customers who have bought JJP games that he put Playfields into and those Playfields

[06:33] have had issues.

[06:35] Now look, I don't understand what goes on inside the head of a man that wants to get

[06:41] on stage after the year he's had.

[06:43] I don't think he should be up there.

[06:46] I think he should be back making quality Playfields and figuring out how to make the Playfields

[06:52] bulletproof.

[06:53] If he's going to get up on stage, I hope this entire thing is not him trying to convince

[06:59] us the Playfields are great by trying to over screw a post into the Playfield.

[07:04] I hope he gets up there and comes clean on everything that's happened with his product.

[07:11] I hope he gets up there and says, hey, it's been a rough few years.

[07:15] We've learned a lot.

[07:16] I know many of you have had issues with my Playfields.

[07:20] Here is what I have been doing over the last six months to ensure that all Miracle Playfields

[07:27] moving forward do not have these issues.

[07:30] I hope that's what he's going to talk about, but I have a bad feeling that it's not going

[07:35] to be that.

[07:36] He's not going to do it.

[07:37] He's just going to go up there and pat himself on the back and I'll say this about this community.

[07:42] I have never, ever seen a community fold like lawn chairs like the pinball community.

[07:49] I was there when J-Pop got up on stage and nobody even asked them any tough questions.

[07:55] This was after J-Pop robbed people of their money and everyone just sat there.

[08:00] Now look, we can be respectful, but we can ask questions.

[08:04] I want to ask him what happened between The Hobbit and Willy Wonka and Pirates and Guns

[08:11] and Roses because The Hobbit Playfields did not have issues.

[08:16] I want to ask him, are you an investor in Jersey Jack Pinball?

[08:21] Do you have an exclusive deal with Jersey Jack Pinball because you are an investor in the company?

[08:27] That is a fair question to ask.

[08:29] I still just can't believe he's going to get up there.

[08:31] I really can and it's going to be interesting.

[08:34] I'm definitely going to try to do a Facebook Live and film the seminar so you can see it.

[08:39] Got Cactus Canyon is going to be doing seminars.

[08:41] We've got CGC is going to do a seminar.

[08:43] We've got American Pinball.

[08:45] We've got Multimorphic.

[08:47] I'm looking forward to these things because when you go to the show, there's only so much

[08:51] you can walk around.

[08:52] There's only so much alcohol you can consume.

[08:56] Then Saturday night will be the Twippies.

[08:59] It's going to be an exciting, fast and furious two days at TPF.

[09:04] A lot of people are flying in Friday, all day Saturday, early out Sunday.

[09:09] It is a wham-bam show, which is good because if you went to Expo this past year, a lot

[09:14] of people flew in Wednesday and sat around all day Wednesday and Thursday with nothing

[09:21] to do.

[09:22] You really only need two days at a pinball show to get it all, to get your fill, to get

[09:29] your kicks with your pinball friends.

[09:31] I like the way that TPF is just two days, 48 hours.

[09:35] I can be the pinball nerd I want to be and then I'm back home in the real world.

[09:40] I will say, is Canadian nervous about the Twippies this year?

[09:44] I'm a little bit, I always get a little bit nervous.

[09:46] I never know which way the votes are going to fall.

[09:49] All I can do is ask for my fans to vote for me and get some of my friends and family to

[09:54] vote for me.

[09:55] But you never know.

[09:56] There's a lot of pinball content creators out there.

[09:59] There are a lot of pinball shows.

[10:01] There's a lot of pinball streamers.

[10:03] You just don't know because my competitors would always tell me they get 5,000, 6,000

[10:09] listens per show.

[10:11] The Twippy votes come out and they get 300 votes, 400 votes.

[10:16] Somebody's lying.

[10:18] How can you have 4,000 or 5,000 listeners per episode but you only get 350 or 400 votes?

[10:24] I don't know.

[10:25] I mean, Canada would get between 2,000 to 3,000 listeners per episode when I was out

[10:30] on the open airwaves and then I think I got around 900 and something votes last year.

[10:36] We won by three times the amount.

[10:38] We beat Franchi by three times the votes.

[10:41] So I feel somewhat good going into this year because here's why.

[10:46] Even if I just got one vote from every single one of my club members, that would be enough.

[10:51] But the reason I am a little bit nervous is if I lost the 500 additional votes and those

[10:56] went to the second and third place podcast, then they would have won.

[11:00] So say what you will but every year during the Twippies, the favorite pinball podcaster

[11:06] category is always one of the most exciting and drama-filled categories.

[11:12] I do think this year's Twippies is going to be very boring because Godzilla is going to

[11:17] win everything and that is going to make the show feel a little bit monochromatic.

[11:22] And also because it's live this year and I mean it when I say it, people have a hard

[11:27] time when it comes to getting up in front of a live audience and giving an acceptance

[11:33] speech.

[11:34] Often times they can get awkward and too short.

[11:37] So we will see how Jeff will keep this show entertaining and this is going to be the first

[11:42] live show without Zack and Greg.

[11:46] So we will see how Emoto and Jack Danger handle a two-hour live crowd.

[11:52] It's a lot harder to keep a crowd entertained if you're not playing pinball.

[11:57] And I've always felt like the big issue with the Twippies is this.

[12:01] Nobody makes fun of the industry enough.

[12:03] If you look at the Oscars, the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards, they always have a comedian

[12:09] host it and roast the people in attendance.

[12:13] And when you get to this show, it's like nobody does that.

[12:17] Nobody's going to make fun of Haggis for taking forever to get fathom out.

[12:21] Nobody's going to make fun of Spooky and Hedge Multibah.

[12:24] Nobody's going to make fun of the fact that Stern sold like a $25,000 Elvira with $500

[12:29] and stickers as the only difference.

[12:31] I so wish I could Ricky Gervais the show.

[12:34] I think we need to take the piss out of this hobby a little bit more.

[12:39] It's way too serious and earnest.

[12:41] So is there any news going on in pinball right now as we head to TPF?

[12:45] So the big news this week is there is a major code update for Halloween and Ultraman.

[12:50] And you know and I know that the code has been the main thing people have been waiting

[12:54] for.

[12:55] They've been waiting for this game to mature and wake up.

[12:58] I'm here to report after being in the threads for both of these games that people are getting

[13:03] a lot more satisfied with their purchases.

[13:07] And you know I'm at this stage now where I'm curious to see how these code updates

[13:12] are advancing these games.

[13:13] I'm glad that people are enjoying their games more.

[13:17] I still think these games have a way to go and you still hear people having problems

[13:22] just updating the code in their games.

[13:25] I don't understand how a spooky game if you update your code wrong it bricks your machine.

[13:32] You know they just need to get all of this together better.

[13:35] I mean that's my feeling about spooky pinball.

[13:38] It's just like it still just feels like a really really really big garage operation

[13:44] still.

[13:45] And some of these things just need to be ironed out and not be issues ever again.

[13:51] If you have a Mac computer it shouldn't be hard to update your game.

[13:56] Why isn't there Wi-Fi in a $10,000 machine to update your game.

[14:02] You shouldn't have all these people trying to figure out how to get the new code into

[14:06] their game.

[14:07] It should be the easiest thing to do.

[14:10] So the code is better as I'm in the thread and I read people.

[14:14] It's funny because I feel like spooky games are not even built by spooky anymore.

[14:19] They're built by the community.

[14:21] It's like they're basically using their customers as guinea pigs on everything they do with

[14:26] their games.

[14:27] It's like if you buy a spooky game now they're going to use you and they're going to crowdsource

[14:32] your feedback to make their games better.

[14:35] And I'm all right with that to a certain point.

[14:38] But there's going to come a time where spooky pinball needs to stop doing it this way.

[14:44] They need to be able to make a stellar machine at these prices and not rely on the community

[14:52] to tell them the user interface isn't any good.

[14:55] Or these fonts aren't good.

[14:57] Or you should blow up the clips from Ultraman to be full screen.

[15:01] It's like the entire community has to help show them the right way to do it.

[15:06] And I think now that they've been in pinball manufacturing for almost 10 years now, spooky

[15:12] pinball should be further along than this.

[15:15] And that's my overall feeling about these two games is I'm sort of over the whole crowdsourcing

[15:22] it.

[15:23] I'm just sort of over it.

[15:24] I want a pinball machine to come out from the factory in the best possible way it can

[15:29] be.

[15:30] I don't want to give the designer tips.

[15:32] I don't want to have to give the coder feedback on how to make it better.

[15:36] I want them to hire coders that are better than I could ever be.

[15:41] I want them to hire designers that make games flow better than I ever could imagine.

[15:46] I just think there's way too much relying on the community to help them along.

[15:51] And when I go into the thread and I see it, like they're in the thread, like there's

[15:54] the other spooky Luke is in the thread every single day, like answering pinside questions

[16:00] every single day.

[16:01] And while some of you think that's amazing, right, they're in it.

[16:05] They're part of us.

[16:06] They're one of us.

[16:07] I'm starting to think that that's a sign of weakness, that they don't really know

[16:12] which direction to go in with stuff.

[16:15] So they need to ask all of you every day, what do you want?

[16:19] And they know the stuff they're putting out there is somewhat buggy and has issues.

[16:24] So they want to be there right away to help you out because they know you're going to

[16:29] have issues.

[16:30] And that's just my feeling.

[16:32] They are very nice people.

[16:34] They mean very well.

[16:36] But the next game needs to be way more polished, way more buddend up, and this company needs

[16:43] to mature more.

[16:44] It just feels like a big garage operation that they're trying to figure out with us at the

[16:49] same time.

[16:50] I don't get that from Jersey Jack.

[16:52] I don't get that from Stern.

[16:54] I don't get that from CGC.

[16:57] Spooky pinball, that's the next evolution of spooky.

[17:00] I'm all about being a part of the community.

[17:02] It's like they need the community to figure out their mistakes.

[17:06] They should be catching a lot of these mistakes and making a lot of these changes without

[17:11] even having to hear from us.

[17:14] All right.

[17:15] Well, at least spooky talks to people.

[17:17] The company that still has not said a word.

[17:20] Haggis Pinball is still MIA when it comes to an official statement about where they are

[17:25] with Fathom production.

[17:27] Now, I think the games are in production of some state.

[17:31] I also think Damien is going to do this.

[17:33] I think he's going to show up at TPF with some fully built Fathoms.

[17:39] I think that is what their goal is.

[17:42] All heads are down.

[17:43] All hands are on deck.

[17:45] If we can show up to TPF with Fathom and everyone sees how well built this game is and how sexy

[17:52] it is, all will be forgiven.

[17:55] And I'm here to tell him right now, he's not wrong.

[17:58] He is not wrong.

[18:00] I mean, that's all we ever wanted, Damien.

[18:03] We didn't get into this to get Christmas cards.

[18:06] We just wanted games.

[18:08] You sold games to your customers.

[18:11] And I think that will be the goal.

[18:13] The one thing Damien will never really ever be able to do is take too much of a victory

[18:19] lap because of the delay.

[18:20] Now, I know he wants to shut up someone like Kaneda.

[18:23] I know he thinks I'm being unkind and all these things.

[18:27] But look, I think he's realizing how hard it really is to make pinball machines.

[18:32] The other mistake I think he's making is this.

[18:34] And I've said this before and I've said this to every single pinball manufacturer out there

[18:38] that has had significant delays and needs to make sure that every single dollar works

[18:44] hard for them.

[18:45] The silliest thing he's doing is coming to TPF.

[18:49] There is no reason to be there.

[18:51] There is no reason to spend the money and go to TPF to put people's fears at ease.

[18:57] Here's why.

[18:58] Because Damien, all of your deposits are non-refundable.

[19:02] There is no reason why you have to go show people that you can get it done other than

[19:07] a pat on the back.

[19:09] It's only an ego play because it makes no business or financial sense for you to go

[19:14] to TPF in a few weeks.

[19:17] Why would you do it?

[19:18] Because every day you're here, you're losing money.

[19:21] Every day you're not in the factory, games are not getting built.

[19:24] And you don't need to sell more fathoms, you just need to make them now.

[19:29] But this is always the problem with these new pinball companies is they want to do the

[19:34] victory lap.

[19:35] Andrew Highway was like this, Robert Mueller was like this.

[19:39] It's like the most important thing to these guys is going to the shows and getting all

[19:44] the credit.

[19:45] But you're not at that stage yet.

[19:48] You should have had these games in people's homes six months ago and then TPF would have

[19:54] been a victory lap.

[19:55] I fully expect to see Marty and Damien at TPF, given Kaneda the cold shoulder because he's

[20:02] so unkind.

[20:03] And I mean it when I say it, their presence at the show is just a waste of money.

[20:09] I mean we saw it when COVID hit and all the shows were canceled.

[20:13] You don't even need a pinball show to sell games.

[20:16] And it's still crazy to me that these companies that really need to make sure they spend every

[20:22] dollar wisely are still wasting money going to the shows.

[20:27] You could even argue there's no point for Jersey Jack to be there.

[20:31] Guns and Roses demand is done.

[20:33] It's gone.

[20:34] There are games sitting in boxes at distributors.

[20:38] So why is Jersey Jack at the show?

[20:41] Maybe to announce something, but we're sure as hell not going to get Steve Ritchie's announcement.

[20:45] I get it.

[20:46] Part of it is just to have a presence, right, to keep your company relevant.

[20:51] And I get it.

[20:52] But for companies like Haggis, for companies like Pinball Brothers, it wouldn't make sense.

[20:56] It wouldn't make sense for Dutch Pinball to go.

[20:59] I think when you're a small boutique and you need to just make your games because you've

[21:04] got your orders, right?

[21:05] It makes sense to go to a show to get orders, but if you have your orders, it makes no sense

[21:11] to go to the show.

[21:12] And I've said it about Multimorphic too.

[21:14] It's like, Jerry's going to go to the show.

[21:16] We're all going to play Weird Owl.

[21:18] I think people are going to enjoy Weird Owl.

[21:20] But then if you go to order a Weird Owl at TPF, you're waiting over a year to get your

[21:25] game.

[21:26] Now we got some more clarity on when Weird Owls will be going out.

[21:30] Now I've been hearing as early as April, May for the kids.

[21:34] And then if you ordered a full machine, I'm hearing sometime in the fall, like September,

[21:39] October, a lot of people were also told they're not going to get their Weird Owl until February

[21:44] March of next year.

[21:46] So it is going to take Jerry a very long time to make all of these games.

[21:51] The one question I still have of his company is this, how many games can you make a week?

[21:59] That is the most important question when you order from these companies.

[22:04] And the reason why we want to know that is we just want a number by which we can keep

[22:09] these companies accountable.

[22:12] It's a delayed year.

[22:13] I mean, if you look at Spooky Pinball, they are not cranking out these games as fast as

[22:18] they want to.

[22:20] I think we're only at like Ultraman number like 130, 140 and only at Halloween in the

[22:27] 300s.

[22:28] So they've got a long way to go.

[22:32] 900 more Halloween's have to make their way out in the world.

[22:38] Another like 400 Ultramans.

[22:41] I think they are just at the first quarter of manufacturing of these games.

[22:46] Now what advice did Canada tell you?

[22:48] Because I was on the marketplace and I knew this would happen and I tried to give people

[22:52] this advice.

[22:53] What did I say?

[22:54] I said, don't buy Legends of Vahala for $8,700.

[22:59] You're going to lose a lot of money.

[23:02] You're going to lose your shirt on this game.

[23:04] And I said it a year from now after this game has been out, a year from the October release

[23:09] date, this game will be $2,000 less than it is new in box.

[23:14] And what am I seeing already?

[23:16] If you want to buy an opened mint condition Legends of Vahala, the lowest price right

[23:23] now is $7,900.

[23:26] So that's $800 off MSRP and you can have the game tomorrow.

[23:32] And guess what?

[23:33] For $7,900, nobody's biting.

[23:37] Nobody bought it.

[23:38] And that price is just going to keep going down and down and down.

[23:42] This is the problem with David Fix's strategy.

[23:46] Nobody has an emotional connection to these original IP games.

[23:50] And I know a lot of you want to support every pinball company, but let's face it, you're

[23:55] going to get bored of something that's an original IP game, especially one that doesn't

[24:00] have a ton in it.

[24:01] I mean, you have to be out of your mind.

[24:03] And I mean it when I say this.

[24:05] You can go get a dialed in LE for $7,700.

[24:11] And it's got 10 times more in it is a better designed game than Legends of Vahala.

[24:17] And yet dialed in for $7,700 are sitting.

[24:21] People don't want them.

[24:22] Try to go get a licensed game at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[24:26] Those prices have all gone up.

[24:28] And that's going to be the problem with these American Pinball games because they can't

[24:33] make them fast enough.

[24:34] I said it, if you sell 500 Legends of Vahala, you really want to get those games into customer

[24:40] hands within two months because what happens now is this.

[24:44] Great.

[24:45] I've got to wait two months to get my game.

[24:47] By the time I pay for my game, by the time I pay $8,700 for my game, I could probably

[24:53] save $1,000 and get the same exact game.

[24:57] If I wait six more months, I'll be able to save like 1500 bucks.

[25:01] If I wait a year, I'll be able to save 2000.

[25:05] What's the point?

[25:07] Why would you buy it new when you can get the same exact game?

[25:11] I mean it when I say it.

[25:12] The only thing I would ever rush to buy now or ever buy with FOMO is something where I

[25:19] knew I either wanted it because emotionally I love the theme more than anything or I knew

[25:26] that the price would never go down.

[25:28] Like you will never be able to get a Godzilla LE for 10.5 ever again.

[25:34] You'll never be able to get a Gundon Roses Collector's Edition for 12.5 ever again.

[25:39] If you bought those games, all you've done is made yourself money, thousands of dollars

[25:45] and you'll never lose a penny on the game.

[25:49] I understand why FOMO drives people to buy those games, but then if you ran and bought

[25:54] Legends of Ahala on day one, think about what you just got.

[25:59] You just lost a thousand dollars and you're going to lose more every month that goes on

[26:05] and you could chalk it up as like, well I love the game.

[26:08] Even if you do enjoy the game, wouldn't you want to just save yourself money?

[26:12] And this is why I think David Fix's strategy just won't work because people are going

[26:17] to see this and now who's going to go buy the next AP game day one with any FOMO?

[26:22] Just wait.

[26:23] Where if it's a Dennis Norman pin, it doesn't matter.

[26:26] Just wait six months or a year and every single original IP game is going to lose at least

[26:32] one to two thousand dollars in one year.

[26:35] Give it more time as more of these huge themes come out and it's going to keep sinking in

[26:39] value.

[26:40] Now speaking of huge themes coming out, Back to the Future is back on my radar.

[26:44] I'm hearing more and more about it as a 2023 title.

[26:48] So we'll see what comes of that.

[26:51] We also heard from Christopher Franci on my Facebook Live that he says he denied that

[26:56] he's doing the artwork for Eric Minier's The Godfather.

[27:00] So that either means that there is no Godfather next or Franci's not on the art package.

[27:07] But I did hear that Franci was working with Eric Minier on his next title.

[27:12] So the plot thickens people.

[27:15] This is just exciting.

[27:16] This is what I love about speculating about what's next.

[27:20] Is it going to be James Bond?

[27:21] Is it Venom?

[27:22] Is it Back to the Future?

[27:24] Is Jaws going to come out?

[27:25] Look, I have not seen any of these.

[27:28] I mean it.

[27:29] I haven't seen any of them.

[27:30] When I told you Guns N' Roses was next, it's because I had the machine in my phone for

[27:35] six months before they revealed it.

[27:38] Nobody is passing around photos, I think, of any of these pins.

[27:42] So I'm excited to see what comes out.

[27:44] I'm excited to see if any of my rumors become reality.

[27:47] But this is what we love.

[27:49] We love wondering what is down the road.

[27:52] Alright everybody, this has been Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[27:55] It's always a pleasure talking to you about what's going on in Pinball and sharing my

[27:58] thoughts on this hobby.

[28:00] It's going to be an interesting few weeks.

[28:02] I think TPF is going to be fun.

[28:04] I do think we're going to get some surprises at TPF.

[28:07] And I think Toy Story is right around the corner.

[28:12] When Toy Story comes out, it is going to just take over this hobby like no other pin in

[28:18] 2022.

[28:19] Super exciting time.

[28:20] We've only got a few weeks to go.

[28:23] Everybody, Canada out.

[28:24] As you can see, we didn't body the damn lambs.

[28:26] Lower please let them accept the things that can't change.

[28:29] And prayed it all and it came to champagne.
