[00:00] Well, if you don't know that Pinside Babies episodes are gonna have a lot of cursing, this one's gonna be maybe the worst ever

[00:05] So please put your kids in a different room and somebody please tell Craig Bobby not to listen to this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast

[00:11] Here we go

[00:12] Mommy baby, we never reach home to home

[00:17] Mommy baby, we will be the same for you

[00:23] Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say

[00:27] Holy shit, I don't think I've ever seen a more ridiculous threat in my life than the Rick and Morty thread in which

[00:33] Canada has swapped out the LCD monitor in his Rick and Morty to a much better monitor

[00:40] And I've got fucking morons like razor's edge and coin dork on fucking Pinside telling people that I'm manipulating the images

[00:49] That canada is manipulating the difference in the LCD display between the stock Rick and Morty LCD

[00:56] And the new one that I put into the game

[00:59] We're gonna talk about that and I'm also gonna talk about the fucking drama the drama

[01:04] Between Zach Manie and Jack Danger it fucking stops it stops on this fucking episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast because the babies and

[01:12] The crying and the moaning and the groaning it's gonna fucking stop it has to stop

[01:17] People have to stop being so fucking delusional so I wake up this morning and I go into the Rick and Morty thread in which I am sharing with the community

[01:26] Things they can consider doing to their Rick and Morty games. You don't have to do any of this shit

[01:33] You could buy your game you can enjoy it the way it is and you could fucking flip the kingdom come and nobody will care

[01:39] You'll have a fucking smile on your face and you'll die and no one will give a shit that you played Pimball Machine or you

[01:45] Collected Pimball machines nobody fucking cares to begin with but if you're listening to this Pimball podcast

[01:51] It's because you care about Pimball more than most people and all I'm trying to do on

[01:56] Canada's episode of this fucking Pinside babies is tell you is tell you why the fuck would I manipulate the images on the two LCD screens

[02:05] Why would I do that am I selling you the new one and then there's some fucking asshole who was like

[02:10] I don't even think he swapped them out. Oh, yeah, cuz I woke up

[02:13] I had nothing better to do with my fucking day than to wake up and let me fucking manipulate and lie to the Pimball community

[02:21] About the spooky Pimball LCD screen. Let me go on a mission to tear down the quality of this game a company that's been very nice to me

[02:30] A company that gave me game number 50 a game that I've been playing and loving and enjoying

[02:35] Let me just wake up and find something to bitch about with this game

[02:39] You think that's what I was doing no you stupid mother fuckers if you stand in front of Rick and Morty and you look at the LCD screen

[02:48] It is fucking washed out. It doesn't look as good as a stern LCD and there's a few reasons for that

[02:55] But the main reason is so fucking simple

[02:57] It's a fucking cheap LCD and because it's a cheap LCD the field of view when you're looking at it

[03:05] Fucking is bad and it washes the colors out. It's not because I'm a fucking hobbit who stands on a fucking pedestal to play the game

[03:12] You stupid Pinside fuckers. No, and I'm so sick of these fucking guys who are like oh, it's you know

[03:18] I played on three machines and they all looked fucking good. Yeah, it's fine. It looks okay

[03:22] You don't have to change this fucking monitor

[03:25] But for those of you out there who want the best quality

[03:28] There are much better LCDs on the market

[03:31] There are much better LCDs on the market and I'm not the one fucking who's telling you this fucking use Google look it up

[03:37] This monitor that spooky put in the game standards probably like 30 to 40 bucks and the one I put in is

[03:42] $60 and it's twice the thickness and it's a got a better field of view

[03:46] And this is the part that people don't fucking get it's not the contrast

[03:50] It's not the brightness. It's not the settings that you can change to make it better

[03:54] It's the field of fucking view

[03:56] Some LCD screens if you look at them from different angles the picture remains clearer

[04:02] And on some it doesn't and that's what you get when you buy a more expensive TV

[04:07] Have you never seen the difference in TV prices you stupid fucking Pinside babies like you guys are fucking unbelievable

[04:14] Like you don't understand the concept of how one TV might cost like 800 bucks and the same size TV

[04:20] Might cost three thousand dollars because it's better picture quality

[04:24] And that is what we're talking about here you stupid fuckers you can't take in

[04:28] $800 or TV and fuck around with the settings and get it to look as good as a three or four thousand dollar TV

[04:36] But that's what these stupid fucking Pinside babies are trying to convince people you can do and this one guy on here man

[04:41] He can't even he's so fucking annoying because his name is DNA

[04:46] DNA pack DNA

[04:48] P.A.C from orange city Iowa and he keeps saying that he messed around with his Rick and Morty settings on his LCD

[04:56] And he got his game the way it came from spooky by changing the settings

[05:00] He got it to look better than my game does with the new LCD in it

[05:05] But you know what he's not sharing with anybody out there

[05:07] He's not sharing what the settings are and then every time someone asks him

[05:11] Hey, man, like what are your settings set at he just keeps showing the picture of the control board

[05:17] That that changes the settings. It's like hey you dumb motherfucker and I'm serious

[05:21] I'm calling you a dumb mother fucker. We're asking for the setting numbers

[05:25] Not that fucking control board. What are the numbers man?

[05:29] What's your number for contrast? What's your number for color? What's your number for brightness?

[05:33] Jesus how is this confusing to you?

[05:36] You said that you're able to perfect it with the settings that you put into your game

[05:41] So what are the fucking settings my man do you have 75 for contrast?

[05:46] Do you have 15 for brightness? Do you have this for for contrast?

[05:49] Wait, what is it? Why is it a big fucking secret? And here's why it's a big fucking secret because nothing you do

[05:56] On that control board will fucking work will change the field of view issues that the LCD has and here's the thing

[06:03] It's not a huge fucking issue. So yes, canada is telling you you don't have to make this change in your game

[06:09] And you'll still be fucking happy so don't fucking say that I'm manipulating photos

[06:14] You think like also think about it like this

[06:16] Why would I manipulate the photos and am I selling you am I trying to sell you the new LCD is canada now in the LCD

[06:23] Fucking business the way pinstadium always does these before and after photos that are clearly

[06:29] Clearly the most manipulated before photos of all time whenever they sell those goddamn things

[06:33] We ever see those things those those pins stadium before and after is like the before

[06:37] The game has been shoved into like a black hole and they pour like black pain over the entire playbook

[06:42] So you look you can't see any of the art and then the after the whole things fucking glowing

[06:46] Like a fucking towering inferno and it's like no, I don't think that before

[06:50] It's like come on guys like that's not the same game in the same room under the same conditions like you completely

[06:55] Fuck him manipulated it and yes

[06:57] Yes, I will admit when I took my photos like the the the new LCD was in the the

[07:03] Housing of the back box and the old one I had to stand up

[07:06] But come on. I'm not fucking sitting there trying to make how can I make this look as bad as possible and how can I make this look as good as I don't give a fuck

[07:12] Either you change it in or out or you don't I don't give a fuck

[07:16] I'm telling you right now. Why would you think just think you's fucking common sense you pinstile fucking idiots

[07:21] Why would you think that swapping in a better LCD that's more expensive that has a better field of view that has a better display ratio

[07:31] Why would you think why would you come to the fucking conclusion that when canada made the switch it wouldn't make it look better like what the fuck is wrong with you people

[07:41] You just look at me you hear my name and everything I do is fucking wrong everything I say is fucking stupid

[07:46] Okay, so who fucking got you the target decals fixed in the game all right who was talking to Scott and easy about the upper orbit loop

[07:53] I saw that two people saying like I'm not fucking taking credit you fucking losers for them fixing that

[07:58] But I am taking credit for highlighting the issue more than anywhere else and we kept talking about it

[08:03] And we got it fixed but I don't give a shit

[08:05] I don't want credit for it

[08:07] But man you guys are fucking losers if you think that I don't have enough intelligence

[08:12] To find things in games that companies can fix and I've always been on the side of the fucking consumer

[08:18] I've always been on the side of the consumer and I do look over these games

[08:21] And I want you guys to make sure that when you get your rick and morty all the things that you should think about you think about

[08:28] Another example that is like okay when you get your rick and morty you should probably put a piece of tape underneath the lockdown bar

[08:35] Because it's going to scrape the rails when you put the lockdown bar on and off

[08:39] It's already starting to make a little nick on my machine. Oh should you see something canada

[08:43] Are you complaining that spooky didn't put enough fucking rubber underneath the lockdown bar and oh my god

[08:48] How could you care about that like because guys like hilton don't give a shit about stuff like that

[08:53] They're fucking lockdown bars are all scratched the shit on location

[08:56] So they don't care but I'm here to tell you like you're probably gonna want to do that if you want to keep your rails looking nice forever

[09:02] Okay, no, but what the fuck does canada know he doesn't know anything about pinball

[09:05] He only has 498 fucking podcasts how many does fucking razors edge have or coin door they have nothing

[09:11] There's simple pin side babes and here's the other thing about these losers on pin side

[09:15] You know what they do they hide behind pin side you want to know what I don't manipulate who I am razor or zedge

[09:21] You know what I know what you manipulate who you are we I've seen guys like this in the past

[09:25] Remember like bezo boob bezo Bob remember that guy used to talk so much shit

[09:29] And then he came out from underneath the anonymity of fucking pin side and he showed everybody who he was and fucking

[09:35] You know whatever and that's it he could never regain you look at him now

[09:39] He's so neutered on pints hide he can't say anything ever again because people see who he is you see who I am

[09:43] I'm not I'm not hard to find I'm right here. I am here canada pimball at gmail.com. I go on Facebook live

[09:49] I don't hide who I am I don't hide where I live

[09:51] I don't hide what I look like I don't hide what I what I do for a living

[09:54] It's all out there. It's all out there. I'm not hiding from any of you guys and you know you know that this is like who I am

[10:00] And so like sometimes I get stuff wrong sometimes I get stuff right but I'm telling you right now if you swap in a better LCD

[10:06] It's gonna look better than the standard spooky machine. Do you have to do it? No and the fucking story

[10:11] But don't accuse me a fucking line about even doing the fucking swap people are lying saying

[10:16] I don't even think he did the swap fuck these losers

[10:19] These guys are losers people they know they're losers. You've seen these guys that shows they're fucking losers

[10:25] They're losers hanging behind the internet trying to accuse me of making this shit up whatever

[10:30] Whatever now here's what's gonna happen here's what's gonna happen

[10:33] I bet spooky fucking puts a better LCD in the next game

[10:37] And I'm so tired of this new thing where everyone just has to say well. I just I'll just live with it

[10:42] I'll just live with this. I'll live with fucking your paying so much money for these things

[10:46] Why are you just gonna live with it and learn to live with it?

[10:50] I mean, I'm telling you right now if you're OCD about this game and you don't want any dimples on the game

[10:55] Yeah, I was fucking wrong and I'll admit when I'm wrong

[10:57] You're gonna want a play field protector because the game's gonna dimple

[11:00] It's gonna dimple down the middle where the scoop ejects and there's nothing you can do about it

[11:04] You can spend 700 bucks on a cruise man

[11:07] You can get spooky who might install you a play field protector before they make your game or you could just fucking live with it

[11:12] Those are your three fucking options. Fuck everything else. All right

[11:16] All right, and the final thing I want to talk about is two of the biggest babies going on right now in pinball

[11:21] Are two of the biggest personalities in pinball and I just want to say what I'm really pissed off about is whenever there's pinball drama

[11:28] Whenever there's a lot of pinball like anger and there's like shit being thrown left and right

[11:33] I'm usually at the middle of it

[11:35] I usually started and I'm so disappointed that this pinball drama is happening and I'm fucking left out

[11:41] I'm left out. I'm nowhere part of it. I didn't do anything to start it

[11:45] I'm not even in the middle of it. That's fucking bullshit if anyone has the right to be part of the most relevant pinball drama happening in the world

[11:53] It's fucking me

[11:54] I earn that right to be at the center of this attention and I'm a fucking

[11:59] narcissistic

[12:00] Social-pathic attention or that should be at the center of all of this and it's not fair

[12:05] All right, that's what they call me. They call me all those things. It's fucking bullshit

[12:09] No, but here's the thing here's the thing two people out there are feuding and they've been feuding for a long time

[12:15] And they are two of the biggest names in pinball

[12:18] They're two of the biggest names in the pinball media

[12:20] And I'm here to tell you on this episode of canada's pinside babies that I want this shit to stop

[12:27] And I am so sick and tired because I'm in the middle of it too

[12:29] I wanted on this episode

[12:31] I want to do a call to a truce a date hum a ceasefire between

[12:38] Zach Manie and Jack Danger and they listen to the show both of them

[12:43] I talk to them both of them separately. No, I'm kind of in the middle

[12:46] I'm kind of in the middle, but what I'm gonna do on this episode right now of pinside babies

[12:50] I'm gonna fucking call them both out because they both are right and they both are wrong

[12:55] And they're both alpha males and they're both egomaniacs like me

[13:00] They're both a little bit narcissistic like me. They both have outspoken personalities like me

[13:05] We're all kind of similar and of course we're going to clash because people like us

[13:10] We want to make the best of what we do we want to make the best content

[13:15] We want to make the best streams we want to make the best podcasts

[13:18] We want to make the best this that and we also we also want to be seen as the leader

[13:23] Who carries the torch in pinball and in our respective fields and there's no denying that and here's the fucking crazy part is

[13:30] I think each of us

[13:32] Really excels well at what we do and when we dip our toes into other areas

[13:38] We're not as good. It shouldn't be the thing that we own

[13:41] But you know, there's a lot going on and I'm gonna fucking be honest on this fucking part of the podcast because I think only honesty

[13:48] Will bridge the gap between these two men and only honesty from canada as an observer

[13:53] Can maybe help men the wounds between this whole scenario and I think I can do it

[13:57] I see Chris the pintern trying to do it like

[13:59] We there's no way a guy that dresses up like fucking willy-wanka is gonna be the one who fucking solves this problem

[14:06] And Chris you know, I love you bro

[14:08] But man I was watching you post in the thread recently and you're you're like slamming jack danger for his work on rick and morty

[14:15] We're gonna talk about that and then you turn around and say but I like jack and I like his content

[14:19] No, here's the thing people this is the problem with the world today and the problem with fucking pen side and the problem with

[14:25] Fucking social media your passive aggressive approach doesn't fucking work

[14:31] It doesn't work when you're passive fucking aggressive like that

[14:35] When you fucking slam someone and then pretend like you're not slamming them and then you like them

[14:40] That's called being passive aggressive. It's the fucking weakest behavior that a human being can display

[14:46] And I'm not passive aggressive. I will tell you right out of the gate like I think

[14:50] Org's art was crappy on alien now a passive aggressive would be like

[14:54] Well, you know, I kind of think but but but you know and that's the problem with the fucking pinball media

[14:59] I'll give you another example that happened recently when Craig Bobby did his midweek show on the pinball network

[15:04] And all he did for 10 minutes was complain about people that are complaining about the Jurassic Park top or buyers being morons

[15:13] Now there's only one person out there who said that and it was me and instead of saying my name and hey canada said this

[15:19] And I disagree with you Chris and I disagree with canada. No, he's got to go passive aggressive

[15:24] And that is such a loser move and that's a weak move and it's a move of a coward

[15:29] And I'm so tired of the cowards in the pinball media world if you have a problem with someone just fucking say it

[15:35] And being passive aggressive is what creates the foundation for all of this drama and don't get me wrong

[15:41] If you go passive aggressive look

[15:43] I've been in blowout fights with people and then we shake hands and make up

[15:47] But if we were passive aggressive and not shaking hands and making up the drama would continue

[15:52] I just saw the other day with the fucking puppet powers the new show

[15:55] What a passive aggressive dick move it was for them to be like oh we got a letter from New York of a guy who lives in a one-bedroom apartment

[16:02] Who's lonely yet you're talking about me you fucking losers

[16:04] So just say my name you fucking losers like if you want to come at me fucking come at me like that's okay

[16:10] Like I can handle it

[16:12] But that's the whole thing it's like it's a passive aggressive loser who like writes you a note and tells you to

[16:17] Fuck off but doesn't sign their name

[16:19] I've always been signing my name on every single time I've told someone to fuck off or they were wrong or they were right or their

[16:25] Game was beautiful or their game was fucking ugly. I don't hold back

[16:28] But these passive aggressive losers are the real problem in the world today

[16:32] So fuck all of you if you have an opinion and you want to say something about another man or woman or grown adult

[16:38] Then fucking have the courage to sign your name to it all right now back to Jack and Zach

[16:44] So these two a lot of the problems are the passive aggressiveness that occurs between the two of them and the fucking the way they pretend to act one way on

[16:53] Social media and then how they act another way maybe privately and I want to say this

[16:58] I want to say this I think the best way to get these two to make up

[17:01] I want to tell both of you right now. This is coming from me. This is coming from me

[17:05] Who I believe I'm a good arbiter of people and human beings. I believe both of you are good men

[17:11] I believe both of you sincerely have really good hearts

[17:15] I believe both of you stand up for what's right. I believe both of you stand up for a diverse world

[17:21] I don't think any of you are either one of you are bad men at all

[17:26] Okay, and that's why I'm friends with both of you

[17:28] I'm friends with both of you despite some of the things that might annoy me about both of you

[17:33] And I'm gonna go into that and I think that's another reason why both of you are friends with me

[17:37] It's because as much as people say all this terrible shit about canada deep down you know

[17:41] That's not true. You know some of this is always just an act for entertainment and any fucking intelligent person can understand that

[17:48] So I think you both are really good men and above all of that

[17:51] I think both of you represent this hobby so well

[17:55] I think you represent this hobby so well and I'm gonna be completely candid on why I think that's the case

[18:00] I think you're both attractive men not as attractive as me

[18:04] But you're both good looking men who are in shape

[18:07] Who are well spoken who are educated who are articulate who really are a great figurehead for the pinball hobby

[18:15] Now there's a reason why a lot of times we get stereotyped as being like add a shape like diabetic like boozing like beer drinking like losers

[18:24] And like you guys you guys open up this hobby to a broader audience because you're more approach

[18:30] For a lot of people you're more relatable for a lot of people and yes

[18:33] You're not the most diverse two guys in the planet

[18:36] But you know what I'm saying is like you guys are disarming

[18:39] People see you and they want to talk to you people see you and they'll like you people

[18:43] And that's why you guys have so many fans both of you and and you both are very approachable and very relatable

[18:50] And very enthusiastic and you can articulate your enthusiasm for this fucking hobby so goddamn well now

[18:57] I think both of you want to be the leader of a stupid thing like pinball

[19:01] And to be the leader of pinball and to want to be the leader and the sole leader and the voice of this hobby is fucking stupid

[19:08] Because no one no one is entitled to that and I see this all the time like people think that I should not have a podcast

[19:14] That I'm not entitled to my opinion about pinball like here's a thing

[19:17] There's enough room in this fucking hobby

[19:20] There's enough room in this fucking world for all of us to have our voice our fan bases

[19:26] And not go at each other

[19:28] Not you know attack each other and again it goes back to the passive aggressiveness

[19:32] You know I know that and here's the thing I'm gonna go off on both of these men right now

[19:36] Okay, because everyone goes off on me

[19:38] It's it's can-aid is time to tell you why I think that you know what are the origins of this fucking feud

[19:43] And I know there's a lot a lot a lot but I'm gonna tell you right now. I'm gonna start

[19:46] I'm gonna go in order all right jack danger. I'm gonna start with you my friend. Jack here's the thing

[19:51] Here's the thing

[19:52] When Zach created the pinball network you should not have fucking labeled this guy as a racist as a sexist as all these things

[20:02] And you did you put up the Bernstein Bears image and that was fucking stupid like you went too far

[20:08] And you started making accusations about Zach many that are not true

[20:12] They're not accurate and you have to be really fucking careful when you start to label people these things

[20:18] He's a husband he's a family man. He's a business man

[20:22] He's got clientele when you say that about someone and it's not backed up with any facts

[20:28] And it wasn't it wasn't that is fucking horrible man

[20:32] And you can't do that and I know I know that's not you jack and that's the thing

[20:36] I know it's not you so I think you should apologize for that because I think that is and I think that's a lot of the reasons

[20:42] Why a lot of this shit's going on behind the scenes and in the fighting for the reveal of fucking hot was

[20:47] I can't believe we've been live a fucking world where people are fighting to reveal in a fucking American pinball game

[20:54] Like if you came to Canadians and hey canada how would you like to reveal American pinball's hot was I'd be like no

[20:59] I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm gonna pass

[21:01] You know I'm on season like seven of the office episode 22

[21:04] I'd rather do that than reveal the fucking game. I don't fucking care

[21:07] I would easily pass on revealing the next American pinball title because as you know

[21:12] I'm not passive aggressive

[21:13] I think American pinball is run by a fucking bunch of fools and this game to me does not turn it all around

[21:19] Fuck man. I'll get a side trick

[21:21] I've been listening to the poor man's pinball podcast

[21:23] They talk about hot wheels like this game is like they figured it all out. They this game's got fuck that

[21:28] Jesus in and true like what happened you guys like put the fucking bottles down man

[21:33] This game is not the second coming of pinball. There's nothing fucking in it

[21:36] There's nothing fucking in it. Yeah, you could steal a fucking multi-ball from a Steve Richie game

[21:41] Where all the game goes red and it's time but fuck man. Are we really looking at hot wheels is like the fucking

[21:47] You know slice bread invention like get the fuck out of here guys like wake the fuck up look at other games man

[21:53] Jesus everyone's in in such a need to kiss the ass of the industry not happening on canada

[21:58] Okay, so my point is this jack you fucking should not have done that right and I need you need to apologize to Zach for that

[22:05] Okay, you need to apologize to Zach for banning him from your twitch channel my man like

[22:10] Jack danger is the best twitch streamer in pinball

[22:13] He just is each of these guys has to let each other like succeed in areas and not try to take him

[22:19] It's like when Zach tries to say he's gonna be better at canada podcasting. It's never fucking happening

[22:23] And he knows he's doing it. I'm gonna go in his act hold on Jack you should not have banned Zach from this stream that you do and you've done it

[22:30] Like dead flip his band-zack many. I think he's banned some of Zach's friends and that's fucking bullshit like once you start

[22:36] banning people who are just there to check it out and and it's again

[22:40] It's that's passive aggressive behavior. That's passive aggressive behavior before it ever came to that point of banning Zach from your twitch stream

[22:47] Like did you talk to the guy in the phone? Have you tried to work it out?

[22:51] Have you tried to like create a better resolution than this and so I think like a lot of this again

[22:57] It just keeps carrying over right? It's like this carried over

[23:00] Anemosity and I think look I get it and I'm not asking you guys to be best fucking friends and and split a fucking Sunday at McDonald's

[23:07] But I'm asking you know you guys to fucking bury the hatchet and at least like let's get to a place in which we can all work together

[23:13] Because it's fucking it's fucking annoying. We got I can't take it. I can't I can't watch Chris the fucking pin turn dresses

[23:19] Willy Wonka trying to play the role of fucking mediator here. I can't do it

[23:23] I can't fucking do it now. He's gonna go on Orbor Albert show and complain about me

[23:27] But I called you out by name. I love it. We give Albert content now. Okay, Jack look you're a great guy man

[23:33] And I'm friends with you because again, I think in your heart you're an awesome guy

[23:36] You've got awesome friends and you're an amazing ambassador for pinball. Zach man

[23:40] I'm gonna go to you and Zach you're another guy you're a good guy. You are a really good guy

[23:44] I don't need Greg fucking bone to tell us why you're a good guy Greg. I fucking get it. I love you to Greg bone

[23:49] They're both great men straight down the middle is the best video series on pinball

[23:54] I've ever seen the reviews are great until you get to the score in which they give everything a B plus

[23:59] But they make great pinball content and so you know like I think nobody out there doesn't really enjoy

[24:05] Would Zach many brings into the pinball world? Yes, is he a shill for pinball apps of fucking lootly because he's a distributor

[24:11] Like way I can't blame the guy. It's his business like I don't blame a guy who's trying to fucking sell me

[24:17] On something that he's selling but but I just you know you take it with the grain of salt, right?

[24:22] I mean every time Zach says the Jurassic Park toppers great

[24:25] I I laugh because I know it's it's a pathway to a fourth twippy for canada

[24:29] So I encourage him to keep shilling like that on his show because it means no one's gonna fucking vote for him when it comes to the best pinball

[24:36] Podcast but the thing about Zach is this and and Zach you know I love you

[24:40] You know I love you Jack and Zach. I love both of you

[24:43] But Zach here's the thing that you always fail to understand and it's one simple thing

[24:48] You are the most passive-aggressive mother fucker in this entire hobby and you're the most passive-aggressive

[24:55] Fucking personality I've ever met and what I mean by passive-aggressive is you play these fucking games

[25:02] You play these manipulative games with people and you know what you're doing man

[25:06] The way the best way to describe Zach many if when you were growing up as a kid is Zach is the kid

[25:11] Who's like behind you that just keeps like blowing on your ear?

[25:15] He just keeps blowing on your ear to get a rise out of you

[25:19] And then you turn around and you smack the fuck out of him and the teachers like what did he hit you exactly?

[25:24] He's actually I didn't touch him. I didn't touch him. I never touched him

[25:26] I never touched him like I didn't do anything and then and then it's all of a sudden he's the victim

[25:30] And that to me is what Zach does and he knows how to do it

[25:33] He knows how to get under people's skin and he thinks it's fucking cute and Zach

[25:38] Yeah, like if that's the game you want to play with people

[25:41] You then have to

[25:43] Anticipate expect and understand you're gonna get blowback you're gonna get people that fucking hate you for doing that

[25:50] And it there comes a point where it's it's no longer cute where you are kind of trying to manipulate things to your agenda

[25:57] And people see fucking right through it man

[25:59] It's like there's just these times in which why is he doing it this way like why you know?

[26:03] And it's like whoa, I didn't you know

[26:05] I didn't like really say anything like and then he gets on his show

[26:08] And he acts the victim even though he knows he said things that really riled people up

[26:13] You know, he did it with the trippies and and again

[26:15] He always says like well, you know what I knew and you know what I it's like Zach

[26:19] Zach it's causing effect in this world like it's just you have to understand like some of this vitriol coming your way

[26:26] Is because of some of this stuff you've done you're not just this innocent victim

[26:29] But he plays that role so nicely now when I'm here to encourage Zach to deal is just stop that shit as well

[26:34] You know all the jabbing at me you know, it's funny because like I'll say things directly and then every time you listen to the pinball network

[26:41] It comes passive aggressively back at me and then half of the shows like all the content becomes like passive aggressive ways for them to achieve their agenda

[26:51] Of saying

[26:52] Dis tasteful things about me, but they don't say it directly and I'm just here to say like why don't we all just fucking cut it out

[26:58] You know, why doesn't all of our vitriol and all of our fucking anger

[27:03] Why don't we just apply it where it should go and that is to the manufacturers when they make cheap shit when they cut fucking

[27:10] Corners when they design games we don't want like we're all connected for our enthusiasm for pinball

[27:15] So everything should be applied in that area. So what I'm calling for is this and I know this is like a big fucking request

[27:21] I think that Zach many and Jack danger should fucking just call each other call each other and say look like men

[27:30] Let's let go of all of the shit to date. I know I've done shit that I fucking regret

[27:36] I know you've done shit that you fucking regret it

[27:39] Why don't we just bury the fucking hatchet you don't have to be best fucking friends look

[27:43] I'm gonna put it out there right now for all of my listeners

[27:46] I would love to have you both come on the show and let's just talk it out and just have you know

[27:50] We don't even have to talk about any of the past. Let's just talk about pinball

[27:54] Let's just have a normal dial like sometimes the best way to move forward is to forget about all the shit and just connect on

[28:01] Something positive that's happening and move forward through it

[28:05] You know, I want to watch a dead flip stream and see Zach's man in the chat. I want to see that

[28:10] I want to go on to Zach stuff and see Jack danger there

[28:13] I want to say that you know get you know these guys could easily share

[28:17] They could easily share the limelight for a lot of this stuff like there's enough games

[28:22] There's enough shitty games to go around where each of these guys could take turns streaming it like why not like I

[28:28] I just don't get why it has to be so black and white so fucking this or that and none of you guys are racist sexes

[28:36] homophobic people you guys are good men and I think you could fucking figure it out all right

[28:41] And this is canada asking me for you guys to do that because I respect both of you

[28:45] And you both fucking do amazing stuff you both do things that annoy each other. I get it

[28:50] But maybe now maybe now coming out of this pandemic we can fucking forgive some of this stuff and we can move forward

[28:57] And we don't need a guy dressed as a fucking willy-wanker outfit intern to fucking create that we could fucking

[29:02] We could achieve it ourselves, but I invite both of you on the show and Zach between me and you

[29:07] And I'm gonna say this Zach and this is part of the passive aggressive approach you take behind the scenes

[29:12] Zach always tells me you and me feuding Chris is good. It's good for business

[29:16] It's good. No, it's not Zach. It's not good and it's and it creates an environment of passive aggressiveness

[29:22] And you're the one perpetuating that you're the one avoiding my show

[29:26] You're the one who won't allow me on the show and I'm just here to tell you right now

[29:30] I think the pinball network is a fucking colossal failure

[29:33] And I'm gonna tell you directly and I don't mean this to make more drama

[29:36] And the reason why I think it's a failure is we didn't need it

[29:39] We didn't need to create a pinball network to exclude certain people from your little powwow

[29:44] You didn't invite half of the content creators that are making great shows

[29:48] Why not you didn't you didn't need to do it the shows on the network some of them are really good

[29:53] And you know what shows those are and some of them are so fucking bad

[29:57] It's excruciatingly painful to listen to them

[29:59] You know and so you've got these good shows and like but it wasn't necessary because all those content creators

[30:05] You have not identified a single new content creator that is great

[30:10] All of the good content that is on the fucking network was great before the network

[30:14] And it will be great after the network

[30:16] You know you don't need pinball cribs like you don't need to keep doing all this stuff to try and take over

[30:22] That's your goal Zach you want to take over maybe let go of it

[30:25] Maybe just do it. You're really good at and then maybe share in the riches with everybody else

[30:30] Maybe join canators pinball podcasts and let's have a conversation when we disagree on something Zach

[30:35] How much more powerful would it be for you to invite me on to give my point of view

[30:39] For you me to invite you and Dennis on the my show

[30:42] But see when you do stuff like Dennis Kreisle won't even say my name Dennis Kreisle won't even give me credit when he's using stuff that I broke the exclusive on

[30:51] That stuff is where the drama is born and I'm here to tell you just because you have canada on your show

[30:58] Is not an endorsement of canada and just because I have you on my show doesn't mean that I'm endorsing you know what I'm saying

[31:05] We're grown men who are just giving our points of view on the dumbest fucking thing on the planet a fucking pinball machine

[31:12] It's the dumbest fucking thing to be the origins of this drama

[31:16] So let me end this episode of pinside babies by saying this everybody

[31:22] Everybody let's try and fucking work this shit out. Let's get along

[31:27] Let's fucking bird the hatchet between Zach and Jack swap out your fucking LCDs if you wanted to look better

[31:34] If not, I don't give a flying fuck. I didn't lie or manipulate the photos all you pinside fucking babies out there

[31:41] I fucking challenge all of you directly pick up a fucking microphone

[31:46] Starts your own fucking podcast and see if you can do what I did all right

[31:52] And I'm not here to hurt the community. I'm not here to fucking just prop myself up

[31:57] I don't make fucking money doing this

[31:59] This is only because I do love pinball and I know it fucking annoy some of those people out there who fucking think they're

[32:06] Entitled to this hobby the hiltons of the world they think it's their hobby because they play pinball all day long

[32:17] It doesn't matter. It doesn't make your love for pinball better than mine

[32:22] It doesn't make your fucking

[32:24] Enthusiasm for it more than mine and it must hurt you that you deny that you listen to this show

[32:30] How can that guy say he doesn't listen man of at some point someone's got to be like man hilton

[32:34] You probably should check it out like he's actually given really good tips to the community

[32:39] And he's actually helping rick and morty owners more than your sorry asses

[32:43] But hilton I love you too, bro

[32:45] And I then just for the record just for the record then I'll let you go
