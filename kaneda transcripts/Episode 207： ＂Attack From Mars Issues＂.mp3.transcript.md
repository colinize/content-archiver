[00:00] Cause I'm just a teenage dude that baby, yeah I'm just a teenage dude that baby,

[00:10] Let's get to our young maiden baby, we'll be together.

[00:22] Alright, welcome to episode 207 of Canadian's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] The Twippie Award winning favorite pinball podcast in the world, I'm your host,

[00:31] Canadian. Here's what we're going to do on episode 207.

[00:34] We're going to go down the list of manufacturers, some new stuff to talk about.

[00:39] We're going to talk about all the rumors and speculations surrounding Deadpool and Iron

[00:44] Maiden. I'm going to give it to you guys straight up.

[00:46] This is everything we know about Deadpool and Iron Maiden.

[00:49] You can take it or leave it.

[00:51] And then we're just going to go over what's happening in the pinball world.

[00:54] How's that sound for a little short digestible version of Canadian pinball podcast?

[00:59] So let's start out with a company that we haven't really covered in a long time.

[01:05] But I got a bunch of people who hit me up and they said, Chris, you really need to check out what's going on

[01:12] in the attack from Mars remake thread right now and read up on it.

[01:17] And I did spend the last hour reading up probably the last like four to five pages in that.

[01:23] About warranty issues with attack from Mars remake.

[01:28] Now I'm going to summarize to the best of my ability what I believe is going on.

[01:33] And I'm going to read some stuff that people have posted in that thread itself.

[01:37] So basically here's long story short.

[01:40] Certain people who have had issues with their play fields and cabinets have sort of explain that

[01:48] when they go to PPS and Chicago gaming with warranty issues related to those larger areas,

[01:56] whether it's the cabinets that are cracking or play fields that are chipping or wearing in certain areas,

[02:02] they are not getting a desirable response from Chicago gaming.

[02:09] Okay. And so here's the thing.

[02:12] That leads to our own sort of little discussion around play field where because I've seen a bunch of people not everybody.

[02:21] Okay. But every once in a while we see that with these new games and with the new clear code process that these companies are using,

[02:30] you know, people want the shinier glass like play field clear code.

[02:35] Those clear codes can chip. They can lead to where they can lead to dimples.

[02:41] And time and time again, we know that play fields wherever there's a scoop, wherever there's a hole,

[02:48] wherever there's an edge, right. Those play fields will wear in those areas and they could also chip in those areas.

[02:57] And so, you know, I've said this and I said this before.

[03:00] I first want to tackle this just from a pure sort of, come on, some of the own has to be on the buyers of these machines to realize certain things.

[03:10] Why don't people, why don't people who are collectors who want to keep their games as pristine and in good condition as possible?

[03:21] Why don't they install cliffies and play field protectors or put mylar down over areas of play fields that they know will wear.

[03:32] They know will chip if there's no protectors there.

[03:35] Now, I would also say that every Pimbal manufacturer out there is so silly now for not installing cliffies or metal play field protectors or mylarying areas of the games that are prone to wear.

[03:49] Because you know that nothing good will come of you sending someone, you know, a six to nine thousand dollar toy that starts to wear and have play fields chipping in the first year of ownership.

[04:03] You know, it's just going to cause a complete headache for the manufacturers and it's so much easier to install a $100 set of cliffy protectors into a game that costs $8,000 or $7,000 and be done with it to alleviate any potential headaches.

[04:23] And so, but that's not that's not what's happened. Okay, people have got the game and they're seeing the clear coat chip. I mean, there's even some examples of people's shooter lanes chipping really badly to the point where there's like black underneath the shooter lane, which shows that when they cut out the shooter lane, there was an imperfection in the woods or they put putty down and clear coated over that.

[04:47] And you know what happens here too in these threads is that when people have a problem with their game, they post pictures and oftentimes those people who are, you know, they're suffering their product being sort of what's the best word to say.

[05:05] They're product is having issues. Then you have the fan bullies who attack those people for sort of over dramatizing the problem or saying that it's not affecting a lot of games. It's only affecting your game. You shouldn't make such a big deal out of it. I'm sorry, but you know, the reality is this. The internet gives a megaphone to everyone. And if your game is having an issue, you will scream until you get some sort of resolution from the company.

[05:33] So we know that there are certain attack from our remakes out there that are having play field issues and some have cabinet issues. Now, the big issue that I'm noticing is how is the company, how is Doug over there, how are they responding to people who are having issues.

[05:52] And I want to read someone's comment about what they went through when they were reaching out to see what the company would do for them. And all right, this is this is word for word from a pin-side post.

[06:08] And he writes after describing to Doug what the issues were. At this point, he when he says he's talking about Doug went into pin-side and the things people are posting on there. He said he has a few employees and friends on there. He said all these things are completely normal and people need to stop posting.

[06:29] At that point, I told him I was a poster and had posted things on there. He said people need to understand we make the best pinball machines. And this is not like manufacturers issues or other manufacturers issues. He said that I need to stop posting.

[06:45] I changed the subject and asked if they were going to send me an email and writing on what we chatted about. He said it will be in the ticket. At this point, he brought up the posting again and began pressing that they do not want people posting issues.

[07:02] I finally had enough and politely said thank you for his time and I'm looking forward to the parts. All right. Now look, the other thing that we hear is that they're giving people a five year warranty extension on the market.

[07:14] They're not really replacing people's play fields if people are unhappy with them. That's a whole other thing we'll talk about in a second.

[07:25] But here's what I want to talk about right now. Pinball is a small community and pinball manufacturers, they are selling to pinball fanatics and those fanatics live on pin-side.

[07:38] Now pin-side definitely is not all of the people out there who buy a new and box pinball machines, but we do know that pinball fanatics and pin-side and podcasts like these and other podcasts out there, we have extraordinary influence on people's decision making.

[07:57] We know that if people are having issues with a pinball manufacturer or with quality of a game that will hurt that company's ability to sell games.

[08:08] And so for them to ask people not to post on social media the issues they're having, I think is an incorrect way to go about it.

[08:18] And because here's what I was told they're doing is they're basically saying to people, they want people to call them. They don't want to put things in writing because they don't want people to share the email correspondence on pin-side.

[08:33] They also don't want people to post on pin-side the issues they're having. They want those people to just deal with them directly.

[08:41] Even if the dealings are unsatisfactory to the customer, they're asking those people not to share that on pin-side.

[08:51] And look, I think communication in the modern day is in something that you can control. You can't contain an issue like this.

[09:01] The best thing you can do is try to figure out a solve that makes these customers happy.

[09:08] Now that's the other part of this that's also interesting is what is a potential solve for people that are having play field issues.

[09:18] If your play field is chipping in the shooter laner, in the ball drain area, down the middle, or in the scoop areas, and your play field has chipped and you just spent whatever $8,000, $7,000 on a pinball machine, and you're not happy that you now have a chipped play field.

[09:36] What are they supposed to do for you?

[09:38] That's the other part of it. I don't know what they're supposed to do. Are they supposed to send you a fully populated play field which would be super difficult and nobody out there believes that that's a solution because they would lose so much money doing that.

[09:55] Do they send you a new play field just so you could have it so that one day if you wanted to swap out your play fields, you could.

[10:04] I don't know if that's a solve for people. Let's be honest. I don't think hardly anybody ever in the history of pinball swaps out their play fields.

[10:13] It's like this peace of mind thing when people have a backup play field of the game they have. It's like then they'll beat on it because one day in the future they could do a play field swap.

[10:22] But we all know that a play field swap is hours and hours of work that's highly technical that 99% of pinball home use owner buyers could never perform a play field swap if they tried. They just couldn't.

[10:36] So there's I think the most likely solution is that they would send out to customers metal play field protectors to go over the areas of the game that have chipped away because oftentimes those play field protectors will hide the areas that have chipped and you will never notice it.

[10:55] But this issue is something that's happening currently and it couldn't happen at a worse time and I'll explain why if this is happening now and it does become a bigger issue and people do lose confidence in Chicago gaming, pps's ability to stand behind their products.

[11:16] It couldn't happen at a worse time as the company is about to announce monster bash remake and all these other remakes that they're planning to do if those products continue to have play field issues or cabinet issues or the company is perceived as a company that is bullying its customers around and not standing behind the products.

[11:38] I think that could negatively impact them and I don't think responses like we make the best pinball machines like we do 13 layers of clear coding or screen printing and stern only does five it's not about how much better you are you have a customer and the customer has an issue there's an old saying in business that the customer is always right and I don't think bragging about what makes your company so amazing and all the things that you do.

[12:08] Clearly shows that it can't be your fault that it has to be on the customers and I don't think that's the right approach and I think that it's going to be interesting to see this way the way this whole thing plays out.

[12:21] It's always hard for us to sort of understand who's the blame here because if you zoom out if you zoom out and you look at these things from a bird's eye view I would also say that pinball machines are a good example.

[12:37] Our are prone to wear and pinball machines were never meant to be these things that remained perfect and I think it is such a headache for manufacturers to have to deal with the vocal minority of people who have issues and there will always be issues when you sell a few thousand of something there's going to be a few that have issues it's so frustrating that those vocal minority could scream loud enough to keep potential new buyers away from your machines.

[13:06] Because the majority of people who have attacked from Mars remakes they probably don't have any issues and that's just the reality of the internet and what the internet does is it creates an imbalance sort of scenario in which most people think the sky is falling that all games are having issues and they're probably not they're probably not.

[13:30] Now here's my recommendation for all of you out there if you buy a new game please put cliffy protectors in it immediately mile are your shooter lane or do what I did with Batman put a play field protector in the game I'll say this I have nothing but peace of mind knowing that my machine will never chip it'll never have where it'll never dimple and it plays amazingly well it plays super smooth and it'll it'll remain brand new.

[13:59] Every day I play it and that peace of mind was worth the $200 that I spent on the play field protector and if you if you really want to have a bulletproof game I think you should have the play field protector I also think that every single manufacturer out there should offer a play field protector as an option for people to put in their games yes you do get a little bit of dust underneath the play field protector yes it does scratch a little bit but at the end of the day you won't care.

[14:29] Because the game will play great it'll look great and it has it gives you one thing it gives you peace of mind so let's see how they handle this I think shame on them for asking people not to post on pin side but I also think the onus is on the buyers a little bit to protect their games and we know the areas of all pinball machines that will wear so don't be shocked if stuff happens to your game and you have no protection in those areas all right let's move on.

[14:58] So Jersey Jack pinball this is a funny threat we see these threads every once in a while where someone wrote former dialed in owners thread and the question was very simply for you guys out there who sold your dialed in why did you sell it because I'm thinking of buying one and I want to know like what issues you led you to sell and there really wasn't there were hardly any responses I don't think there was any response really from anyone you sold their dialed in we actually don't see dialed in come up for sale that often which is a

[15:28] really good thing I think that's a testament to how much people are enjoying that game here's the other part though who cares what someone else thinks if someone else has a reason why they sold the game it doesn't mean that you will also feel the same way about the machine it's it's also like when you go to a restaurant you know and you ask someone what's your favorite thing on the menu who gives a shit what the waiters favorite thing on the menu is because you and the waiter are not the same thing.

[15:58] The same person what what if he loves like capers and you don't and he recommends something with capers on you know it's just it always boggles my mind but look at the end of the day everyone play the machine if you like the machine buy the machine the other Jersey Jack thread that was kind of funny was is Jersey Jack pinball are they pricing themselves out of business and I think we've been talking a lot about pinball pricing and where it's going is

[16:27] Jersey Jack pricing itself out of business and I would say no they're not they're actually pricing themselves to stay in business Jersey Jack price themselves out of business when they priced wizard of us at $6500 at that price point they couldn't make a single dollar making the wizard of us the Jersey Jack games are now appropriately price for what you get in those machines and just yesterday I was at Pioneers bar and I was looking at a

[16:57] dialed in right next to a Batman SLE and I have to say $9000 versus $15000 I mean the dialed in is just jam packed there there is no scratching of one's head on in terms of is this game worth the money because I think everything is there

[17:14] now look you could ask the more macro question is the pinball hobby going to shrink if the majority of of new pinball machines from these new companies cost between eight and $10,000 and the answer is of course it will you will always have a larger customer base when your products are cheaper what it just opens the door for more people to buy I think a lot of people over the last couple years are starting to do a more and more

[17:44] waiting on the sidelines because as these games get really expensive what is the point of running after every new inbox game that is available you really have to make sure you love the game because these things are really expensive and I also think people are going to have a lot harder time selling their machines on the second hand market and we're seeing that already I mean some of these games are losing one to $2,000 immediately and that's a lot of money to lose if you go in on a lot of pinball machines

[18:13] but I think Jersey Jack is appropriately priced I don't think they're going out of business I think the fact that Jack has a billionaire investor helping the company out now will keep them around for a while which is a good thing because we all want to get to the future titles of Jersey Jack pinball

[18:31] and I think everyone out there is excited for what's to come we won't go into the fact that I think knowing what's to come is Jack's biggest issue

[18:40] you know people wants the excitement to be around pirates the care being but everyone's kind of knowing what toy story is and everyone kind of knows what the title after that is to and one of the mistakes Jack makes and this just happens with pinball manufacturers in general is they tell people they tell people what their next titles are they go over to some of the homes of their collectors and they reveal what the titles are and so individuals at Jersey Jack pinball I mean I already know what the game after toy story is

[19:10] and the problem is this if you know what that game is then that is going to hurt the sales of pirate to the Caribbean and then loose lips, you know sink ships

[19:23] is that isn't even a phrase or did I just make that up I don't even know but I'm just saying that's the problem is is ois is is I feel like people are always excited for the next thing coming from Jersey Jack when they should just be excited for everyone because I do think Jersey

[19:39] right now is bringing the best pinball machines out into the world. The only

[19:45] issue that I think they face is I think they they try to go too far with all the

[19:49] games. They put too much in it. They need to focus on making the game as fun as

[19:53] possible and not just jam packing it with as much code and mechs and toys as

[19:58] possible. There's something they're just they're not quite there in making that

[20:02] game that's just incredibly fun and an amazing pinball experience. I just I

[20:08] there's always something just quite not there. All right, Stern Pinball. I want to

[20:15] talk about real quick. I played a Batman super Ellie last night and I want to

[20:19] say this for you guys out there. Do you get sad when you see an amazing machine

[20:25] on location and it's sort of like beat up and it's sort of got tons of wear at

[20:31] Pioneers Bar New York City. They have a Batman super Ellie on location and

[20:36] having one in my bedroom and then going there and playing there. It always makes

[20:41] me sad to see a pin that I know how great it can play and I know how great it

[20:46] can look and I know how great it can be and then playing the same pin on location

[20:51] and everything about the location pin is just beat up and rough around the edges.

[20:56] The playfields got tons of craters. The flipper powers are weak. The lighting is

[21:01] bad. The you know the the rubbers are all worn and you know there's a ball stuck

[21:06] in an area. There were hang ups happening and it's just like oh man like pinball

[21:11] machines just they just take a beating on location. So it's just it's oh you're

[21:18] always going to get the best experience when you play it in someone's home and

[21:22] the game is really like well taken care of. I just still I still think owl is

[21:26] crazy for putting a Batman SLE out on location. All right so let's talk about

[21:32] Iron Maiden and Deadpool because I want to give you guys here's here's

[21:36] everything I know. Here's everything I know about these two titles. I've seen

[21:40] some stuff I've I've sort of heard many rumors but I want to just go down

[21:45] quickly so you can hear it on Canatus Pinball podcast. Here's what we know about

[21:49] Iron Maiden and Deadpool. All right Deadpool was originally designed by no

[21:57] other than Mr. John Trudeau. John Trudeau was working on Deadpool with

[22:03] Zombie Yeti and for obvious reasons he was yanked from the product. I heard the

[22:08] game. It was either finished by Borg or Gomez or maybe they collaborate to

[22:13] finish the design. Deadpool is based on the comic book of Deadpool. It is not

[22:21] based on the Ryan Reynolds movies. Okay so you're gonna see on the Deadpool

[22:25] play field you're gonna see X-Men characters. You're gonna see Wolverine drawn in

[22:31] Zombie Yeti artwork. So Zombie Yeti is the artist and it is very very cool. So that

[22:37] is what Deadpool will be and you're also gonna see another very interesting

[22:43] like sword lock mechanism on the game where you're gonna see you know Deadpool's

[22:50] like saber that he uses sword is like his like samurai sword. Now you're gonna

[22:54] see a ball lock on one of those things again which is very cool. That's all I'm

[22:59] gonna tell you right now. I mean I'm not gonna tell you anything else. I'm not

[23:03] gonna share with the photo with anybody. I'm not gonna I'm not gonna win

[23:07] anyway but here's the thing. So many people I know have the photo. I mean it's

[23:10] like this thing that's just getting passed around passed around. Now it's an

[23:13] early photo. It's like a white wood with with just some sketches on top of it.

[23:18] It's not the final thing but interesting layout. Little white open you know

[23:24] Stern layout seemed to be very wide open but that's Deadpool and it's it's not

[23:30] coming out yet but it should be pretty far along because I know they they were

[23:34] designed the game for a while before Trudeau had to get yanked off it. All right

[23:38] Iron Maiden is coming out first. Iron Maiden will most likely be shown at

[23:42] T.P.F. We'll probably see it a week or two before T.P.F. which is probably maybe

[23:47] any day now. Iron Maiden is Keith Ellwyn's game. Iron Maiden is a re-skin or

[23:54] re-theme of his archer game. So if you go Google Keith Ellwyn archer you will

[24:01] see pretty much the layout of Iron Maiden. You are also going to get a killer

[24:06] art package from Zambiyeti on the game. I'm also hearing that Iron Maiden is

[24:11] based on an Iron Maiden album. The game itself is based on one of the Iron Maiden

[24:17] albums. Now which Iron Maiden album is it based on? I'm not an Iron Maiden fan

[24:23] but I'm gonna Google Iron Maiden albums and let's right now and I'll tell you

[24:28] which one I'm rumored that it's based on. I'm being told it is possibly going to

[24:32] be based on Iron Maiden's album The Book of Souls which is a 2015 album. So

[24:40] I'm not sure if that's what you fans want it. I'm not sure if it'll probably have

[24:43] you know songs from other albums but they might maybe that's just like the art

[24:46] package of what. Maybe there's gonna be different albums that have different

[24:50] art packages. I'm not sure but that is what we know about Iron Maiden. I also

[24:55] know that Keith Ellin is working on the rules set and might even be working on

[24:58] the coding of the game. We are gonna see it any day now. These rumors and these

[25:03] speculations and everything we know it's like who cares I just show the games.

[25:07] I kind of wish we didn't have to do this all the time on every game. So that is

[25:13] what we're gonna probably get and those are probably gonna be the next two

[25:16] stern titles Iron Maiden into Deadpool into Beatles into Monsters and that is

[25:22] your year for Stern Pimball. They do not have like a juggernaut A license

[25:27] coming out unless you consider Iron Maiden to be a juggernaut A license. So

[25:32] that's everything we know so far. We might see more information on this week in

[25:38] Pimball when they talk about their rumors on Thursday. All right let's move on

[25:43] to spooky Spin Pimball. So spooky. So I heard basically you know what broke up

[25:49] Charlie and Ben you know it like severed the relationship once and for all. What

[25:55] created the ultimate walking away point it came down to one thing. It came down

[26:01] to $500. $500. Between a $500 difference they couldn't see eye to eye and they

[26:12] decided to part ways. Now I haven't listened to the Charlie Emory interview on

[26:17] Head to Head Pimball. It's over there now you can check it out. I've invited

[26:20] Charlie on this show many many times. It's nothing personal. I just don't think he

[26:24] he wants to come on this show. I don't think he ever will. I'm always friendly

[26:28] with Charlie at shows. I think he's still a little bit pissed at me because I

[26:31] scooped them on their Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle announcement at T.P.F. last

[26:37] year but again. Same thing. Lou Slips. They went around telling a lot of people

[26:41] that they thought were like close friends and those people told people and

[26:44] those people told me and that's what happens. You tell people things thinking

[26:48] that they're going to keep it confident. Whenever you tell a pin-side fanatic I

[26:52] don't tell anyone. The first thing they do is they tell their five pinball buddies

[26:55] who will all say like I won't say anything and then those five guys tell their

[26:58] five friends and before you know it a hundred people know about the information

[27:01] but again it doesn't matter. They can cost them any sales. I think Charlie's doing

[27:05] it right. I think Alice Cooper is going to come out right after T.P.F. but we're

[27:10] not talking about Alice Cooper. We're talking about the $500 that separated

[27:15] Charlie and Ben. Now you might be asking what do you mean $500? So basically Ben

[27:20] was working on his new game. It was it was a horror based theme. I don't know what

[27:25] the theme is but it was horror based. I think Ryan C. Overt head to head pinball

[27:30] knows what the theme is. He just won't tell me. So if you want to hit someone up

[27:33] hit him up. But here's what happened. They needed $500 to add to the bomb.

[27:40] To get I believe the voice actors to do the game right there or something maybe

[27:45] wasn't the voice acting but they needed $500 more per game to get to secure

[27:50] the license properly and Charlie would not budge on letting Ben raise the price

[27:56] of the machine by $500. He wouldn't budge. He's like that's it. I'm not raising

[28:01] the price of the game. We won't do it and because of that they called it quits

[28:06] on the project. Now here's the thing. Here's a question for you guys out there.

[28:10] Is $500 in addition to spooky's price? Is that a deal breaker for people to buy?

[28:16] The game does Charlie know the marketplace well enough that he knows people will

[28:21] not absorb that kind of price increase or is Charlie being stubborn and small

[28:27] minded and making a decision that is preventing his company from growing.

[28:32] That is really I think Charlie is at that crossroads and I've said it before. I think he's

[28:37] being stubborn. I think he's not realizing that to make the games better he's

[28:41] going to have to increase the price of the machines because he's not going to be

[28:45] able to make the games physically better or make the experience as much better

[28:49] unless he invests more in the product and then he also needs to charge more for

[28:54] that product. But for some reason I think he's just hell bent on keeping prices

[28:58] at a certain point and I think he's hell bent on keeping the bomb at a certain

[29:02] level and I don't think he wants to grow or in heavily invest more in the

[29:07] games or maybe he's figured out a better way to do it without having to add too

[29:12] much to the bomb and maybe we're going to see the proof in the pudding with

[29:15] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle because we know the price of that game is not

[29:19] significantly more than Rob Zombie I believe it's $6,800. Now look if if he had

[29:26] given in to Ben and they brought out a machine that was $7,300 do you think it

[29:33] would have been a deal breaker it's hard to say right we don't know what the

[29:36] theme is we don't know what the game is I'll say this I don't think $7,300 I

[29:40] don't think $7,500 seems like a lot of money for a spooky pinball machine I

[29:45] think so many games now are costing so much more money that if the game was

[29:50] somewhat limited I think people would definitely go in on it but Charlie's

[29:54] probably looking at it from you know Stern pinball machines are still the

[29:59] pros are still around like $5,000 to $5,500 I really don't want to start selling

[30:05] machines at $2,000 more than that now I'm competing with Stern premiums and I'm

[30:11] not quite sure that's what I want to compete with because Charlie you know they

[30:15] don't have 20 titles they don't have 10 titles they don't have a huge assembly

[30:20] line that can simply throw some vault additions on there no one's ever going to

[30:24] buy a vault of Rob Zombie or America's most haunted Charlie needs to make sure

[30:28] that every game is successful and every game works so if he thought that Ben's

[30:33] game at that price point wasn't gonna sell it's too much to risk now the question

[30:38] then becomes is what is after Alice Cooper's nightmare castle the thing I've

[30:44] always been wondering too is like if he didn't get TNA I mean spooky pinball would

[30:49] have probably been in trouble over the last year because Rob Zombies had

[30:54] finished being produced Alice Cooper wasn't ready to go on the line and then

[31:00] Charlie has basically a factory making nothing for months and months and months

[31:05] now I think his response to that is well we would have we would have hurried up

[31:11] and got Alice Cooper out the door faster and having TNA on the line has allowed

[31:15] us to make Alice Cooper better so that's great and all but I just wonder like

[31:21] what's next because I think spooky is like they're at the crossroad they are

[31:25] either going to grow and become a little bit of a bigger pinball manufacturer

[31:30] where I think they're gonna get stuck and I don't want to see them get stuck in

[31:35] this like marketing position where they're just making like horror spooky themed

[31:39] games you know because they haven't had any new people come to them to contract

[31:44] manufacture games right remember they had Jetsons they had Domino's they had

[31:47] other companies come into them to make pinball machines but we haven't seen any

[31:52] of those sort of contract manufacturing titles come to spooky there are some

[31:57] games out there that would benefit from a contract manufacturer like spooky to

[32:02] make their games stuff like the nightmare before Christmas stuff like woolly

[32:08] wrath of Olympus right so we'll see what this future holds for spooky you know

[32:14] it's it's it's it's interesting that him and Ben have parted ways you know I

[32:19] don't think anyone's ever gonna make Bible adventures we saw someone start a

[32:21] threat about that and most people said they would never buy it I think that it's

[32:26] sad losing Ben from the pinball hobby because I think Ben is such a great

[32:30] personality he's such a great person I think he's a great collaborator and I

[32:35] think he has a lot of good ideas you know but look you know money changes

[32:40] everything and businesses business and this probably was just a business

[32:44] decision that they made and I don't know the business as well as they do I don't

[32:50] I don't know the business as well as Stern does or Jersey Jack I am simply a

[32:54] bully with a headset on in my apartment I do know marketing pretty well I

[32:59] think I do and I think spooky spooky would be wise to broaden the kinds of

[33:06] titles and themes they bring to the marketplace all right so let's talk

[33:10] quickly about American pinball the games are still trickling out trickling out

[33:15] I mean I think there might have been a delay we don't know what it is but new

[33:20] owners are getting the machines slowly and they're they're sort of uploading

[33:25] what their experiences are with the machine and look here's a thing people are

[33:30] having some issues with the game not major issues but things need to be tweaked

[33:34] out of the box and if you go in on a Houdini and think you won't have to tweak

[33:41] the game a little bit or there's not going to be some issues it's the first

[33:44] pin from a new company that is never mass produced any pinball machines before

[33:50] you are going to be someone of a guinea pig you are going to have to do some

[33:54] things to that pin to make it play right but nothing seems to be major all

[34:01] right so there's nothing that should have you like wanting to cancel your

[34:04] order or get out so I think that's a good sign and we look forward to more

[34:09] people playing Houdini I hope to play it at tpf and you know the faster they

[34:15] can get these games out the better all right nothing really new going on in the

[34:19] alien or Dutch pinball world I think we've covered them significantly I look

[34:24] forward to hanging out with Robert Mueller over at deep route at tpf hopefully we

[34:28] can you know find some time just sit down and chat you know I've been sort of

[34:32] negative nelly on a lot of like deep route and and and and what their plans are

[34:38] but I've sort of like woken up and just I've sort of I'm asking you know as I

[34:42] think about like well what's what what am I most curious and what am I most

[34:46] excited to see happen and I have to say I'm very curious as to what they will

[34:51] develop I think we have a lot of time before we see the results of the things

[34:55] are talking about I definitely wouldn't have said some of the bigger and

[34:59] bolder statements about you know Stern is gonna find it hard to compete with them

[35:04] but look at the end of the day I think these guys are very adamant and they

[35:08] seem very confident in what they're gonna about to go do and even somewhat

[35:13] crazy about what their plans are but you know look I've always said it in the

[35:17] world of business it's only the crazy angry people that change the world and

[35:22] and flip industries on their heads and we'll see what happens I and there's

[35:28] nothing you know there's no reason for us to be negative anymore I mean if

[35:31] you're in on a zidware game I think you're you're the only people that have a

[35:37] personal sort of a connection to what they're doing and it's up to you on whether

[35:42] or not you think this is your best chance or you still want to go in on a lawsuit

[35:47] but we're gonna I think we're gonna have some months go by before we see anything

[35:51] really develop there all right I'm trying to think if there's anything else going

[35:55] on in the pinball world I think that's it I think we covered it on this short

[35:58] little digestible episode of Canadian pinball podcast thank you everyone for

[36:04] listening I will be at tpf so if you are there I look forward to meeting a lot

[36:10] of you and hanging out I also might want to go there's like this mo par dodge

[36:14] car show in Dallas that Saturday morning I'm gonna have to hit that up you

[36:19] know three days of pinball shows it's I don't know about you guys but from just

[36:22] from a hygiene standpoint it's usually too much for me it's too much everyone

[36:27] have a great day and we'll talk to you soon
