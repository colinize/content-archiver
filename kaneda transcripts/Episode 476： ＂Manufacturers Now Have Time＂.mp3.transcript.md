[00:00] Every single pinball manufacturer has one thing going for them right now and they all need to take advantage of it.

[00:08] Time is on time.

[00:12] Yes in the end, yeah.

[00:15] Time is on time.

[00:20] Yes in the city.

[00:25] We're not doing any more homework.

[00:27] We're not going to bring you down with COVID-19 talk right now.

[00:30] We're going to talk about time and how every single pinball manufacturer in the world right now has nothing but time.

[00:38] Time is the most valuable commodity in the world.

[00:42] You can't buy more of it.

[00:44] You can't recreate it after it's gone.

[00:47] And when you have time to figure stuff out and I think all of us have more time in our lives than we ever thought we'd have.

[00:53] We have more time with our wives and children on a daily basis.

[00:57] We have more time to think about our career choices, our life choices, our buying choices.

[01:04] And now that there is so much time out there for the pinball manufacturers, I wanted to take this episode of Canadian pinball podcast and talk about how I think each manufacturer should spend this valuable time that they all have now to figure out a strategy on how to use this time.

[01:22] To make it when we hit go again that all these companies come back and are more successful.

[01:30] Now some of them are already really successful, but for some companies out there, this delay can help them sort of reorganize, rethink things, re-strategize, team up with new people, do new partnerships, think about new approaches.

[01:46] And I'm going to give you what I would do if I was these pinball manufacturers during this delay that is impacting everyone.

[01:54] How's that sound for episode 476 of the world's number one pinball podcast? Let's go right now.

[02:01] So let's start right at the top with Stern Pinball. How should Stern Pinball spend this time?

[02:06] And the truth is, Stern Pinball is the most well-oiled machine in the industry. Nobody would argue with that. They were ready to get Ninja Turtles out into the world.

[02:16] If there's one thing that everyone is looking for, in how Stern Pinball should spend this time off, it's simple. I think one word comes to mind.

[02:25] Code. Stern Pinball now has enough time to make sure that all of their games, because we've weighed it for them and there's this delay,

[02:35] there's no excuse now for Stern Pinball machines that are shipping in 2020 to have poor code in them. And Ninja Turtles especially, people will be looking at this game.

[02:46] Now I heard a rumor that Stern Pinball is aiming to ship Ninja Turtles with code at 1.0.

[02:54] I don't think they'll do that because 1.0 always signifies for most people that it's done. It's strategically smart to keep that number somewhere below one,

[03:03] because then there's always hope that things you might want will be added in. So 0.96 is really smart. 1.0 is really dumb. So I look for Stern to spend this time getting the code to completion.

[03:16] And the best part about this time off is, now you can't physically go into the office for most people, but the coders can code remotely.

[03:25] So a Pinball coder, this isn't really a bad thing. There's less distractions. They're being pulled in less directions and they can focus on getting the code done.

[03:35] Now during this time off, I'm wondering how the heavy metal game is going to kind of come back, because that game was, they were right on the release schedule of it.

[03:45] They even revealed that they were making the game. I don't know if time will help or hurt heavy metal. I would assume that this title didn't have that much excitement around it. And now that this delay has happened, I really think heavy metal is just going to come out.

[04:02] And there's nothing they can do given this extra time to create excitement for that game. And because Ninja Turtles is coming out right on top of it,

[04:11] I think heavy metal is going to be so DOA when it finally arrives. And I don't care what zombie Eddie said I'm inside about how the artwork on heavy metal looks really good in person, because we all know when he shows what he's done on Ninja Turtles, it's going to blow away heavy metal.

[04:28] And heavy metal is going to be one of those games that just was never going to be that great if it got released on time, but it's going to be one of those games that just completely flops in terms of sales when it is released.

[04:41] Now Stern doesn't care because it's a contract manufactured game. They've already been paid, right? People, people remember that Stern will be paid for every game they make. If the games don't sell, it's not on Stern to sell them. It's on heavy metal to sell them, so they don't care.

[04:55] Now something I'd like to see Stern do with this time. And again, this is just things that I hope these companies do. I want to see Stern find some new designers. And I mean that. I think that Stern needs to get more young designers into the company.

[05:10] And there's just no excuse anymore for not giving young guns and young talent a chance, a chance to prove themselves in the pinball industry.

[05:21] You can't tell me that nobody young wants to get into pinball. And I think Stern has a lot of people that are just grandfathered in to this company and into this industry. And that's fine.

[05:33] But I think it's time with this excess time for some people to start to hang it up. And I'm going to say it. I think Steve Richie might have one more game in him. I think it might be Led Zeppelin.

[05:46] But there comes a point. There comes a point when lead designers on games, how you have to find younger talent. And I think Stern pinball, they see the writing on the wall, Keith L. Wynn is their young new designer.

[06:00] And he's not even that young, but he's new to pinball and look at Keith L. Wynn. He immediately has taken over as the most exciting designer at Stern.

[06:10] Now if I'm George and I'm Gary, I'm looking at that like, oh my god, like we brought in new talent. He approached what we do differently. And his games, he just cleaned house at the twippies.

[06:22] And again, I think the twippies are a great marketing tool for these companies to understand what people want. Who's the next Keith L. Wynn?

[06:29] The next Keith L. Wynn is not going to be John Borg. The next Keith L. Wynn is not going to be Steve Richie. Who else am I missing over there in terms of designers?

[06:39] I don't know. Gomez. I mean, he's still designing. I like George Gomez designs. Just got to take the clunk out. Anyway, so here's here's that's what I would do if I was Stern. I would sort of try to find your next Keith L. Wynn in this time.

[06:51] Like interview people get some people in there, like start to shuffle it around a little bit. Okay. We're going to talk about that shuffling of the players. Now that more and more companies aren't Chicago, will we see people migrate and take different jobs? There's no more excuses for some people.

[07:06] You know, if you're Stern employees, do you do something differently? If you're John Borg, are you finally after Ninja Turtles? Is it time to go find somewhere else to apply your skills?

[07:17] Now, John Borg is a guy that him and Gary are really tight. But if I'm John Borg, maybe you reach a point during this moment of reflection where you say, maybe I should go somewhere else. Maybe I should show people what I could really do if I wasn't hamstrung to this low bomb at Stern.

[07:36] And everyone knows that we know that he gets mad that they ain't stuff out. If I'm John Borg, I am calling over to one place, another place who I think also could use a third designer desperately. And that's Jersey Jack Pimball. You need to mix it up more at Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:54] And I think John Borg should be knocking on Jersey Jack Pimball's door and saying, hey, let's do something together. And let's see what John Borg can do over at Jersey Jack Pimball. I would love to see that. I don't think it's going to happen.

[08:09] But I'm thinking if I'm John Borg, or I would go over to another company that desperately needs design help. And how much better would it have been if American Pimball invested all their money, not in Joe Balser, but invested their money in John Borg? I think you would have got much better products as a result.

[08:28] We'll talk about American Pimball, what they do in this time off. But Stern Pimball for the most part, they will come back. They will come back the strongest out of everybody.

[08:37] Their sales will be down. There's no denying it. People look at the prices of these games now. So Stern in this time off, they must be evaluating how many games do we release now in 2020?

[08:49] How do we sort of reignite reignite the frenzy in Pimball and also Stern I think needs to figure something out. And I'm going to say this, I think they need to figure out how to help out the industry.

[09:03] And by that, you know, Stern Pimball is the largest provider of Pimball machines to operators and distributors and to location play. I think Stern Pimball should figure out how can we help get these operators back on their feet.

[09:19] If anyone can do it, it's Stern Pimball because here's what is happening. Operators are getting decimated. Is Stern Pimball going to do something for operators to try and help them get back on their feet, get people into their locations and sort of help them make up for everything that's hit them so hard over the last few months?

[09:41] And maybe they're thinking, or I would help them think of like, what can we do? Maybe we could do a new payment plan for operators so they don't have to pay up front for the entire game just to get people in. Maybe we can do a deferred payment plan on the new titles coming out. Maybe I don't know how do you do it? Maybe we can organize a lot more Stern Army events at these locations to get people through the door.

[10:05] Think of ways in which I could possibly help the locations. The hard part, and I'll say the hard part is scale because there's so many places that are getting decimated. How do you help if you can't help everybody? That's always the challenge, right?

[10:19] It's the kid who brings candy to the classroom. Do you have enough bubble gum for everybody? And then the teacher says, nope, you don't so you can't give anyone any. And that's the trouble, and I'm going through that now at work.

[10:29] If you want to do something to help people, but it's not scalable to everyone who needs the help, does it work? Okay?

[10:36] But Stern Pimbal, I fully expect them to come out of this the best out of everybody. Alright, who else? Who's got time on their side? So Jersey Jack Pimbal, let's go on to Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:46] Now Jersey Jack Pimbal, first and foremost, we have to say congratulations to Mr. Ken Cromwell. If you didn't hear the news, Ken Cromwell is joining Jersey Jack Pimbal as their, I believe it's their head of communications or communications strategist at Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[11:02] He will be stepping down his duties at the Pimbal network. So he won't be doing the Pimbal show or the stream on Monday nights, and he will be joining Jersey Jack at the middle of this month to be running their comms department or be their head of comms.

[11:17] Okay? So I just want to say that's awesome. I mean, it's always super, super cool to hear people go from being on the fan side of the industry to working in the industry.

[11:26] So Ken, you've always been a good buddy. I'm really I'm happy to see you make the jump to Jersey Jack Pimbal. And Ken joins Jersey Jack at an interesting time. It's probably the most interesting time to join this company because it's a company in transition.

[11:42] And we know that they're moving to Chicago from Jersey. I listened to Jack's interview on the super duper awesome Pimbal show with Christopher Franchi yesterday and typical Jack answers. You kind of get half answers to everything.

[11:57] Everything is you know, I just want to say this to Jersey Jack. I always said and I'm going to tell this to Ken. Ken, your first your first thing that you should tell Jack to do as your new role as the comms lead is very simple. It's this don't ever compare this high end Pimbal company ever again to Jersey Mike's subs. Don't ever do it.

[12:20] We are selling high end bespoke Pimbal machines to a more lucrative audience stop comparing our company to a goddamn hogey. Okay. Nobody wants to hear about how Jersey Mike's subs expanded and Jersey Mike's subs started in Jersey. And now they're stop stop comparing your high end Pimbal company to a sub company that makes hogeys. Jack, you need to stop.

[12:45] All right. It's just it's just this weird fascination with it's not new Jersey people love Jack. It's it's it's the high end Pimbal you make. Okay. I just hate to break it to you. So here's so here's the thing. So they have time and they've moved to Chicago. Now here's how I would use that time if I were Jersey Jack Pimbal. You got to get guns and roses launch plans in order.

[13:05] Now their launch plans for guns and roses are not out there in the open. They never officially said they were bringing the game anywhere. I think people are saying that guns and roses. It was going to be at MGC. I don't think that was the case because there's no way they were

[13:18] tooled up and ready to start production of this game. Jack knows especially with guns and roses when Jack shows guns and roses. That game needs to be on the line. The collectors additions need to be the first ones on the line. Jack, I'm telling you right now. And I'm saying this without hesitation. If you put guns and roses collectors additions on the line from day one. There's a there's a 75% chance I'm ordering that game on day.

[13:48] I'm not worried about Eric. I'm not worried about the design. I'm not worried about the sound. I'm not worried about the code even because it's going to have all the songs I love. The only thing. And this is weird to say it but the only thing that could keep me from buying a guns and roses Pimbal machine from Jersey Jack Pimbal is one thing and one thing only. If they mess up the art because that is a thing that has me the most nervous about this game. And that is the other thing I wanted to bring up before I go back to the game.

[14:18] I'm going back to guns and roses launch. I think Jersey Jack Pimbal needs to go get some good artist. This company, if there's one thing this company I just think just doesn't do well and I'm looking over all their games. And they're beautiful games. But the art packages on them have all been mediocre.

[14:38] It's never been illustrated in like they don't have beautiful hand drawn art on their games. They've arranged Photoshop stuff nicely. But again, the Jersey Jack games they need to have better art.

[14:55] And that is the one thing that is really I think been confusing to me because why does Stern Pimbal that sells a much cheaper game have such better art packages on their games.

[15:08] And I'm sorry but in this time off don't ever don't ever release a cabinet that looks like Willy Wonka standard ever again get these games looking so much better on the cabinets and on the playfields and they can do it.

[15:22] I mean, even when you look at go put the monsters next to Willy Wonka. I didn't really notice this until I saw the twips when you put them side by side it is embarrassing how barren the Willy Wonka looks next to the monsters.

[15:36] It's embarrassing how much less detail there is and that shouldn't be the case because art is easy to nail out of the park. And again, Jack you're making the nicest looking Pimbal machines on the planet bar none.

[15:48] But you need to get incredible art and guns and roses needs to have just just it needs to have like dirty Donnie on crack like guns and roses.

[15:57] I would have gone out and I would have found and this is why I am always so annoyed when people are like it's it's it's it has to be these five people in Pimbal art.

[16:06] Get the F ad here Jack go find and it's too late for guns and roses it's too late because I know france you was going to help out with guns and roses a while ago and Jack was like we've already got our guns and roses art figured out that has me nervous it has me nervous there are so many amazingly talented tattoo artists who guess what right now if you're a pinball company guess what right now are you listening American pinball do I have your attention every single amazing tattoo artist in America right now guess what's happening.

[16:35] They are out of work but you know what they can do they can make art for your Pimbal machine what they can have is people walk into their tattoo parlor and get tattoos because of what's going on so now it be a really smart time for you to reach out for some of those tattoo artists that are starving for work and kick them some money to do your pinball cabinet your pinball playfield but no one's thinking like that you know why because people in Pimbal winning the game.

[17:04] When you're in Pimbal when it comes to making decisions they don't think a lot of bone head moves use this time wisely people I just gave you another great suggestion go take it's actually go find some of the most talented tattoo artists right now and get them working on Pimbal packages and I bet you'll get them I bet you'll get them at a third of their normal rate because they don't have any work coming in use this time wisely.

[17:28] So Jersey Jack go get an artist or two that elevates the art on these games I'm sorry I just when I see Jersey Jack machines they just the art just leaves a lot to be desired okay now guns and roses launch now how you gonna launch this game Jack we've got time you've got time to figure this out it's not going to be at a pinball show most likely don't launch guns and roses at expo don't be a dummy don't be a dummy now the other thing I mentioned a while ago is that slash should be the one who reveals this game to the world.

[17:58] Now the good news is this right now and this is where again Jack don't can Jack can I know you're listening you're the new head of comms can here's an idea right away for you slash can't go on tour right now slash could not make T.P.F.

[18:13] because of the guns and roses tour slash his home like everybody else slash can't go out and do the you know the not in this lifetime tour why don't you guys figure out a way to get slash the game and record some content and get him to reveal the guns and roses pinball machine to the world he has the time now you can figure out a safe way to get him the game and just think about that headline again I'm gonna give Ken and Jack a gold and PR

[18:42] moment think about that headline that national news headline here's how slash is beating being stuck at home here's how slash is spending his time in quarantine he's playing a brand new guns and roses pinball machine he's getting the first one delivered in the entire world

[19:01] and here's the visual of it and this game is going to be available soon as soon as Jersey Jack pinball can turn back on and make these games for everyone to enjoy that's how you do it that's how you launch the game the guns and roses pinball machine is slashes stay at home beat the quarantine boredom with the new Jersey Jack guns and roses machine.

[19:23] Do you think they thought of that do you think they got a guy like marketing this good on their staff like canada I'm giving it to you guys for free there's a reason why I make all the money in our guys it's not because I'm a pinball fanatic is because I'm a marketing fanatic there's your idea get it to slash do it tomorrow I think they should do that I think now is the perfect time to do that so then when the thing turns back on you have this great content of him with the game or or maybe he can go live in the game or

[19:52] he can go live on on a stream and reveal it to the world and and take orders on it see here's the thing too I think because we're going through this no one's thinking differently about how we can sell games and I mean that if if Stern had shown Ninja Turtles Ellie last week with everyone home everyone drinking everyone board out of their mind people are people will spend money right now and I might have been a little wrong I think coming out of this yes you're going to see a lot of people that tight in their wall it's but the

[20:22] people that buy the L.E.s they typically have more disposable income I think everyone right now I'm going to say this I think if you want to sell

[20:34] 500 or less of something that has a lot of demand it don't matter when you put it on the production line you can lock in non-refundable orders of that game right now and the

[20:48] way Stern's been selling Ellie's the big distributors have that policy you have to pay and fall within 48 hours or that's it you're you lose your deposit I think J.J.

[21:00] has that positive and that's to prevent the flippers but anyone right now who has a hot product and a buyer base that's all at home waiting and waiting and waiting it would sell Stern would sell out all 500 Ninja Turtle Ellie's if they launched it like yesterday they would

[21:17] so my point being if Jersey Jack revealed guns and roses collectors edition first to show the hottest one first that's the other thing to show the hot model first we are going to reveal to the world guns and roses

[21:29] collectors edition don't make 500 collectors editions of guns and roses Jack it's apparent that the the demand for collectors editions game to 12 5 is not 500 units he overshot it with wonka and now wonka collectors editions will never feel that special and it's just they're still available there they're

[21:47] never going to sell all 500 guns and roses collectors editions you should make 200 to 250 I think 200's been the sweet spot at 12 5 if Jack announced we're making about $12,500

[21:58] or collectors editions at 200 units he'd sell everyone and these are going to be the first ones that go on the line why not why not lock in all that revenue as you're going through this move and do it that way right now when no

[22:10] analysis is is showing anyone anything or locking in any orders right just change the playbook you know right now we're living in a period where every

[22:18] playbook is being thrown out the window why not just change the playbook so if I'm Jersey Jack I do that the other thing I'm if I'm Jersey Jack in this time off

[22:26] there's one thing that if I'm Jack there it just comes a point now where there's no avoiding this there's no avoiding this reality your company that has you know let's let's

[22:38] be honest your company that has made games where there's been a varying degree of demand for some of those games wizard of Oz had

[22:46] demand and you you you supplied more than enough of those games to meet the demand there wasn't that much demand for the

[22:53] habit there was not that much demand for dialed in and then we get to pirates of the Caribbean an interesting game in which

[23:01] there there was extraordinary demand for it then a year went by without shipping the game and people saw the

[23:06] streams of it to the point where they got bored by it and then the game came out and it was a slow burn now people are getting their

[23:14] games there's only a thousand out there the game is now the number one game on pinstites solely because the collector's

[23:21] addition guys are all giving it like nine sixes and nine sevens and that's fine but it's the number one game of all

[23:27] time and I'm not even good on that road the game is good it's it's just it's so funny to me how the owners of pirates are

[23:35] just like it's the greatest game ever okay whatever sure it is no but look here's the thing all that Jack should take away

[23:42] from this and he knows this there's money on the table how can you not remake pirates of the Caribbean and I've

[23:50] said this to people the there's only one reason why Jersey Jack Pimbal does not remake pirates of the Caribbean there's

[23:56] only one reason because it's the smart move to do that's the only reason why they're not making the game Jersey Jack Pimbal

[24:05] is a company that although they make these amazing games oftentimes I wonder who makes the decisions over there

[24:12] because they oftentimes don't do the smart thing they think about it the smart thing to do is make a game where

[24:19] there's a ton of demand for it right now that selling used for four five six thousand dollars over what you

[24:24] charge people for it you're not seeing any of that money Jersey Jack so if Jersey Jack remade five hundred

[24:30] pirates of the Caribbean games they would sell out immediately I don't care how hard it is to make just remake it now if Jack

[24:35] were smart he would remake pirates of the Caribbean call the black pearl edition put the nice top or on top of it

[24:41] make it all black like the black arrow edition hobbit and make five hundred of them and have have it look really awesome

[24:48] and sexy go over the machine you have all this feedback fix and tweak some of the stuff that people have given you

[24:54] feedback on put some clifters here and there figure out like how to wire this differently whatever it is you have

[24:59] you have almost a year and a half of players feedback on things that need adjusting make the adjustments sell five hundred of the

[25:07] black pearl editions for eleven thousand five hundred dollars if Jack offered them right now five hundred black pearl

[25:15] editions with black powder coated armor the big black pearl ship on the side of the game and the black pearl

[25:21] topper if he offered it that way he would sell out all five hundred right away and put in the bank right what's what's

[25:30] eleven five times five hundred that's a little over what five and a half million dollars no why why would we do that

[25:37] why would we why would we do that because it's so smart let's not do that let's let's just keep it saying I don't know

[25:43] unbelievable Jack charge whatever it cost do you do not see what's happening Jack people are people are

[25:49] fighting over each other to spend sixteen seventeen thousand dollars on this machine remake the game but he probably won't remake it

[25:57] because it's the smart move to do and I swear to God there's like a monthly meeting at J.J.P. that's just like what's the

[26:03] dumb thing we can do with this launch okay let's do that what's it okay yeah let's let's make the standard

[26:09] edition Willy Wonka with like the worst cabinet art ever because that's that we want to sell that in volume oh yeah

[26:14] because Pat Lawler said it's gonna go into locations and they don't show the side art you're so stupid bonehead

[26:19] moves stupid bonehead moves stop Jack make prior to the Caribbean next to guns and roses at the same time

[26:28] Jack don't you understand what happens at Stern Pimball go into Stern Pimball they're making like six to eight games at

[26:35] once why are you so like one trick pony at a time you're only gonna make one game at a time when you when you

[26:43] move into these big spaces when you have you have the demand there for more than one game at a time he's got to stop

[26:50] he's got to use this time to rethink the strategy because it's it's not making much sense and

[26:56] people want the game now the other thing is this I do think that if you remake pirates a lot of that

[27:02] demand will evaporate because a lot of the demand is there simply because there's no more but that's why you have to say

[27:08] look we're not gonna rerun pirates I would do this we're not gonna rerun pirates we're not gonna order more parts

[27:16] unless we sell all 500 of these and this is all we're gonna do when the remake and that's it and then we're moving on because Jack also

[27:24] has to get out of this we're gonna constantly be redoing titles

[27:29] because collectors don't want that and that's always where he struggles and look at look at the yellow brick road

[27:33] edition just think about that like he came back out with that removed mex and he still won't tell people what the total

[27:40] number of yellow brick road games is so you you're getting game number something of God knows what and that's not the right

[27:48] approach either so you know when it comes to launching guns and roses I think a guns and roses pirates of the

[27:53] Caribbean 2020 is a great way for Jersey Jack to close out the year and then I would hit it with toy story big

[28:02] at next marches like tpf and and I would just be all about toy story next year and whatever the next title is but that's

[28:10] how I would do it because how awesome would it be if both of Eric's games came out and just

[28:17] dominated and he showed people like a new version of pirates and also guns and roses ones a wide body

[28:24] ones a standard body and those two games I'm gonna say this they don't compete with with each other very

[28:29] much there the the music pen versus a pirates the Caribbean completely radically different themes and just

[28:36] for you people who think guns and roses suck you guys suck if you think guns and roses is not good

[28:40] ban is games not going to sell you're out of your minds all right what's going on in American

[28:44] pinball so here's what I would do in this time period an American pinball now first I want to read for

[28:48] you something that went out yesterday so American pinball is listening to what I said and they are doing

[28:56] some market research now uh mr. michael grant over there at american pinball he's been sending

[29:03] emails out and here's the subject head special message to all american pinball customers so he's

[29:10] corresponding with everyone who's bought an american pinball game now i'm not going to read this

[30:17] answer any questions or issues that have not been addressed before thanks for taking the time to

[30:22] read this and i look forward to hearing from you please stay safe and he said all the best from

[30:27] american pinball right michael grant sales and marketing manager so here's the thing here's the

[30:32] thing american pinball a company that is also in transition a company that launched a game at the

[30:37] worst time ever with hot wheels and michael grant is asking for feedback which is great now here's

[30:42] here's the thing you need to do michael here's the thing you need to do michael grant sales and

[30:47] marketing head at american pinball the people's feedback you need in this time off to figure out how

[30:53] to make your company the best pinball company in the industry which by the way you know this you guys

[30:58] are failing horribly at that goal the people you need to ask on what to do to improve are not people

[31:06] who bought who deni or octoberfest because those people are the exception to the rule those people

[31:15] are the anomalies if you could sell to those people anyone could sell to those people the people you

[31:21] need to sell to are the people who didn't buy octoberfest and who deni which is almost everybody

[31:28] in the pinball buying community and that's the feedback you need and what you need to do in this time

[31:33] off michael grant is you need to go on the pin side and you need to start a thread that's just

[31:38] says we want your feedback on how to make american pinball games better and it's going to be a

[31:43] bitchfest it's going to be a bitchfest a little bit people are going to give you like but they'll

[31:47] be constructive I mean for the most part I think the community wants to help american pinball

[31:51] get better I think people want a true true quality product from these other companies that makes

[31:59] them think twice about buying a stern or or leveling up to a jersey jack machine and american

[32:04] pinball has failed to do that and the sales are indicative of that and I don't care who thinks

[32:10] otherwise you're wrong because the sales show it the first thing I would do in this time off at

[32:15] american pinball are you ready for it I would completely rejigger the staff whoever was in place to

[32:20] make those first two games gone sorry hit the bricks pal I know you had your chance you messed up

[32:26] you're out of here they need a complete overhaul american pinball should go higher john borg

[32:31] american pinball should go find other designers they need to they need they they gave joe balsard

[32:36] two shots three shots now it that sales weren't there and there's no one to blame there's no

[32:41] one to blame because if joe balsard's blaming dovel for those two products then then like then

[32:47] double got to go but I doubt it I think dovel strikes me as a guy that doesn't know what he's even

[32:53] doing in pinball and he he trusted and had faith in the team over there so that's it I'm not even

[32:59] I'm not going to get nasty on this company they have they have a time now to restructure this

[33:04] organization they have a time now to take feedback this is when you put a new team on the court

[33:10] and they need to go do that the problem is I think now they're trying to do things like for cheaper

[33:16] they're trying to cut costs and hot wheels is proof of that now you're going to hear you're going to

[33:20] hear on another show coming up this week that another company was close to getting the hot wheels

[33:23] license and sounds like they did a lot and Mattel went with american pinball you're going to hear who

[33:28] it was but anyway anyway so you look american pinball in this time period I don't know how you get

[33:35] hype going for hot wheels again if I were them hot wheels to me is the last product from the old

[33:40] company I would spend this time going to make an offer to a john borg can you get lime and sheets

[33:48] you'll never get them who can you go get they need to go get someone that brings an audience

[33:53] with them they need to go get someone that has a fan base they need to go get a new designer like go

[33:58] paste got an easy twice as much money whatever it is they need to go get someone that becomes the

[34:03] face of this company that knows what they're doing and it's just it's just if it's the same staff

[34:07] I expect the same results and that's just that okay who am I missing right now so I got stern I got

[34:14] jersey jack I got a american pinball p3 multi morphing in this time off I mean Jerry's Jerry's

[34:18] shown his his his high scheme and he's ready to go with it in this time off I think Jerry needs to

[34:25] just manufacture those things and find ways to get people to buy the platform I think what I would

[34:31] do if I was Jerry in this time off is I would get my game to streamers that have large followings

[34:38] and get them the product of stream he needs to get jack danger the game the problem with Jerry

[34:43] he's got just a couple homeowners playing the product and those guys are actually hurting sales

[34:48] because they suck at pinball and when I was watching one of his homeowners play the heist or heist

[34:54] I was it sucked because the guy sucked it was just like he wasn't able to show much of the game

[35:00] so Jerry needs to get some streams of this thing going and then he's got to get creative I think

[35:05] Jerry also needs to look at the harsh reality that ten thousand dollars is just not the price point

[35:10] for this platform I'm I'm sorry it's too much money he's got to take a he's got to do like a

[35:17] a little bit of a loss on the upfront of getting it into people's homes and make up that money

[35:21] as people buy more of the games but at 10k it's just such a hard pill to swallow you know I was

[35:28] thinking about it too it's like you can't even sell it used and this is the problem is like

[35:32] guys are trying to sell Lexi lightspeed used for like 6500 bucks but then you got to go buy the

[35:38] heist for 2700 bucks and then you're then you're back once again up to that nine ten thousand

[35:43] dollar range and you might as well just get a new one here's the thing with p3 I just always

[35:47] want everything for 10k like if you have Lexi lightspeed and heist and rocks and cosmic cart racing

[35:53] I don't I just I want to spend 10k and get all of it I don't want to have to spend like the the

[35:59] whole bundle is almost sixteen thousand dollars like you just ludicrous no one's doing that

[36:03] because then you can't sell it used like how do you sell p3 with all the bundle who's gonna buy

[36:09] it for 16k it's like that moron that was trying to sell wrath of Olympus where there's six of them

[36:15] you see this guy in France tried to sell wrath of Olympus for 19,500 dollars 19 five and now he's

[36:22] all the way down to 15k and still nobody wants it I always laugh because Hilton said he he rejected

[36:27] offers of twenty five thousand dollars for the game twenty five thousand dollars he says someone

[36:33] offered him for woolly and he was like no now now it's 15k great nobody wants that stupid game anyway

[36:40] all right it's not a stupid game I take that back it's just nobody wants the game they net they

[36:44] didn't want it years ago they don't want it now all right Chicago gaming company what do they

[36:49] do in this time off so look they they're delayed I hope you guys enjoyed my last episode I got a few

[36:55] things inaccurate which I knew I would because there was so much to unravel one of them was they

[37:00] did end up shipping medieval madness remakes a little bit earlier than January of 2016 I think

[37:06] that was the date in which European games arrived they were still about a year late on getting games

[37:11] to customers the other part is Chicago gaming company did make vacation pinball which was sort of

[37:17] like a spin off sort of Chevy Chase national ampune kind of game that was for the home only so they

[37:23] did actually put a game together it was a terrible game and it was it was you know it was in for

[37:29] operators there was no coin mech on the machine and it was a cheap cheap game so that this wasn't

[37:35] their first pinball venture but I do think the show did a great job in capturing all of the back

[37:43] and forth going on between planetary and cgc and stern and spi and wms and all that all the craziness

[37:49] going on now I'm Chicago gaming company I'm doing one thing during this time off I am really

[37:55] starting to think about like what what are we doing with which titles were bringing out next because

[37:59] if you saw the pin side some guys doing an awesome like march madness bracket tournament to find

[38:05] the best game of all time and he has all the valley Williams titles that are in the remake pool

[38:11] for Chicago gaming company and the game that they're making next is most likely going to be cactus

[38:17] canyon but as you can see in terms of games that people are most excited about cactus canyon is

[38:22] not more popular than big bang bar it's not more popular than theater of magic it's definitely not

[38:29] more popular than tales of the Arabian nights and if you were to ask people which game would you

[38:35] like to see be remade with code improved upon the game that would I think be the two games that I

[38:42] think would be the the number one games for them would be big bang bar and tales of the Arabian

[38:47] nights cactus canyon to me is a game in which I get that they didn't make many of them I get that

[38:54] it was one of the last games valley Williams made but it's just I don't think people wanted that

[39:00] game as much as they think people did and I think they were looking at the fact that use cactus

[39:05] canians were selling for so much money but that's just because they were rare it wasn't because it

[39:11] was like the best game and even though they're going to make the game deeper with new code I still

[39:17] think they need to look at what people really want in terms of the game and making the best game

[39:23] there is versus just trying to make what's the most expensive game that was collectible that we

[39:29] can remake so I would make I would make the J-pop games and big bang bar like I would just start with

[39:34] those and I think you would you would do phenomenally well with sales but again the whole question with

[39:39] the company is how long does it take to get these products out there I can't imagine planetary

[39:43] pinball is is happy with how long it's taking but you know this company again they've been around

[39:50] for seven years like why can't we at least do one a year like what why isn't taking so long so we'll

[39:55] see what happens with them but I think that's another case of like when they show the like they show

[40:00] the world cactus canyon it's got to be done gotta be ready gotta be ready to go and they gotta

[40:05] they gotta be thinking about how do we get at least two titles out of here just taking too long

[40:10] who am I missing then I gotta be done here am I missing um dutch pinball well dutch pinball is just

[40:14] gonna keep doing what they're doing uh I think that there's there's not nothing new I would give them

[40:20] other than make the games as fast as you can now ironically through this pause period the only

[40:26] company that's still manufacturing games the only company that's still in business is dutch pinball

[40:33] the irony of all of this is amazing it's like in a world in which everyone is in honest business

[40:39] person has to shut down the guy who lied is still open for business right isn't it just there's

[40:45] there's a level of irony in that so whatever dutch pinball they're trickling out lebowski's uh those

[40:52] who had a pay choice will remain hopeful here's what dutch needs to do in this time off and this is

[40:57] what Barry needs to do he needs to finish the code of this game the code is at like 0.67 the game is

[41:02] still great the game is still the best world under glass I've seen since I've covered this hobby

[41:06] but Barry in this time off you need to finish the code because I think what Barry doesn't realize

[41:11] is the lack of polish in the code and finishing the game if he does that and he makes this game so much

[41:18] more interesting to play because I hear from all the owners like after you have it for a while

[41:22] it gets boring really fast what he needs to do is get that code complete put more in it make it more

[41:30] magical and that's what's going to lead more people to want to own this game and he's got time to do

[41:35] it but it also reeks of a red flag and a warning is that he clearly doesn't have the money to pay

[41:44] someone to finish the code I mean who was working on the code go give that guy whatever you owe him

[41:49] and get him to continue working on the game it's like how can there be zero progress on code on a game

[41:56] that's been stagnant for years you know coding doesn't require anything other than the man to have

[42:02] the game to work on and that's that's my concern is that if they're not working on code this

[42:07] company is still just like running on fumes all right so deep root pinball what what what should they

[42:12] do in this time off how should deep roots spend this time off well here's the thing I'm not going

[42:16] to tell you what I think they should do right now because I interviewed Robert Mueller yesterday

[42:21] and that interview is going to go up Friday morning and so you're going to hear straight from Robert

[42:25] Mueller how deep root is spending this time off how they feel about missing the March 25th date

[42:31] due to this pandemic and what the future holds for this company in 2020 and on it's a really good

[42:38] interview and I think you're going to enjoy it and I was glad Robert spent the time to come on he

[42:42] even gave me like a little treat for you guys a little a little bit of the side box or cabinet box

[42:48] uh I think the back box artwork I got a little sliver of artwork that he gave me to put up with

[42:52] the show so at least it's something right I tried to get him to get me more but he wouldn't so you're

[42:57] going to hear from deep root on the Friday show so here's the thing lots of time to plan in a lot of

[43:03] ways we all know this when the pinball machine turns back on when the industry comes back alive not a

[43:08] lot is going to change these companies are are still going to pretty much do what they do the way

[43:12] they do it but I do think now is the time for them to rethink strategy for companies who aren't

[43:18] so successful now's the time to figure things out and for companies that are doing it very well

[43:24] you know you have a little bit more time now to put a little bit more polish on what you do I don't

[43:28] expect radical changes from Stern I don't expect radical changes from Jersey Jack I don't expect

[43:34] radical changes from most of these companies but the truth is some of these companies really need

[43:39] to do radical changes and I hope they they listen to some of this feedback now I didn't miss spooky

[43:45] pinball now spooky pinball and I hate to like put them last because they're not last right now they're

[43:49] they're in the fortunate situation where they sold every single brick and morty already so Charlie's

[43:54] doing all right he got really lucky on on when he launched this game because it was like right before

[44:00] this all hit now what spooky pinball needs to do in this time off they really need to sit down and

[44:06] they really need to figure out a way to make games faster and and this albatross is not going to leave

[44:13] this company's shores they need to figure this out because this they can't keep doing this if

[44:20] they make games that people want that sell out in four hours they need to rethink the strategy and

[44:25] Charlie can't fall back on well I never want to be in a position where I have to let people go

[44:30] Charlie I think it's quite clear you're never going to be in that position if you keep doing what

[44:34] you're doing which is making these kinds of games there there's that kind of demand for it and I

[44:39] know Chuck's probably a little insecure that they can constantly have Rick and Morty like hype and

[44:46] I would be the same way like maybe every title's not like this but he really needs to figure out a

[44:51] way and maybe this CGC partnership will help him do that but I really think he needs to figure out a

[44:56] way to make these games faster and if you were to ask me again I'm just going to say this I think the

[45:01] two companies that it would make sense to consolidate I don't even think it's spooky in CGC you've got

[45:06] American pinball in a 55,000 square foot facility that knows how to make stuff and build stuff

[45:12] incredibly well you've got with no demand right so American pinball's got this all this space and

[45:17] all this know how when it comes to manufacturing and absolutely no demand for their games you've got

[45:23] spooky pinball with incredible demand for the games and they know how to build their games fine and

[45:28] they're in inventing Wisconsin there's something about me is just like can't these two like figure out

[45:33] a way to just like combine and somehow just I don't know there's just but you know if I'm

[45:39] chucked I don't want I don't know it's a weird way like I get it like no one really wants to combine

[45:43] probably with AP because of like I don't know AP doesn't have like a fan base AP doesn't have like

[45:48] any good mojo or momentum and maybe Chicago gaming companies the way to go but whatever it is if I'm

[45:53] chuck I'm trying to find a way to build these games faster does that mean like hiring a night shift so

[45:58] we just we have two shifts going every day so instead of 18 months it's nine months whatever he

[46:02] needs to do I think there needs to be a way to get these games faster especially with this delay

[46:07] because this delay let's be honest this delay is going to remove a lot of the hype and excitement

[46:12] for Rick and Morty I mean only like 70 games have gone out game was announced in December right I

[46:17] didn't even get game number 50 it's sitting somewhere with a butter cap I don't think any butter

[46:22] cabinets went out I might be the first butter that's the first time you know canators butter brought

[46:27] to you by can either um anyway so that's where we're at that's where at I think when it turns back on

[46:32] it's gonna be interesting to see if sales are impacted I think for me the the big thing I'm

[46:38] looking forward to seeing is how location play pinball how it comes back and can it come back and

[46:43] I do I think the companies all need to get together to figure out how they help locations out I do

[46:49] I do and I think the companies can give operators a break uh in how they sell them their games so we'll

[46:56] see if that happens as well everyone this was episode 476 on Friday you'll hear from Robert Mewler

[47:02] we're gonna keep giving you podcasts until there's nothing left to podcast about uh we'll talk to you

[47:07] soon everyone stay healthy stay inside and don't don't for any reason go out and play pinball with

[47:13] your friends not yet we'll get there but not yet
