[00:00] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] You do not have to wait long when you listen to this show.

[00:24] We're gonna get right to it on episode 800 and something.

[00:27] Thank you for being a club member.

[00:28] Let's talk first about Godfather, you sale prices.

[00:33] Then we're gonna talk about Evil Dead.

[00:35] Spooky Pinball is most likely making this game sometime next year,

[00:40] the 1981 version of the Evil Dead movie.

[00:43] And then we're gonna talk about the data.

[00:45] What did people vote for when I put up a poll

[00:48] about what were the themes you were most excited about

[00:51] in the pinball world as we head into 2024 and 2025?

[00:55] And it's gonna shock you where people were voting.

[00:58] I'm surprised and we got over 2,500 votes on these themes.

[01:03] So this is a pretty good sample of the pinball buying community.

[01:07] All right, so let's talk about this real quick.

[01:09] There's no avoiding this.

[01:11] You can, as of today, go buy a new and box Godfather LE

[01:16] for $10,699.

[01:19] Now that is a game that is brand new, unopened.

[01:22] We also have distributors trying to sell you this game

[01:25] for $12,000 firm, firm.

[01:29] And I'm looking at this marketplace and I'm saying,

[01:31] wait a minute, if you're a distributor

[01:33] and you're sitting on a Godfather LE for $12,000,

[01:36] how do you think you're gonna find a buyer

[01:39] if someone is selling the same exact game for $10,699?

[01:44] How do you think you're gonna find a buyer?

[01:46] That's $1,300 less money if you just buy the other person's game.

[01:52] And now what do you think these opened up Godfathers

[01:54] are going to be worth?

[01:56] It's just gonna get worse and worse and worse

[01:58] for these games where there's not a lot of demand.

[02:01] I think a lot of you out there are all in the same boat.

[02:04] You wanna see what's around the corner.

[02:06] You don't wanna buy into these games at these prices

[02:10] and now we're starting to see what's really gonna happen.

[02:12] The inventory is gonna start to pile up with these distributors.

[02:17] And what's gonna happen then?

[02:18] How are they gonna order the next game?

[02:20] How is a distributor who's sitting on a lot

[02:23] of not just Godfather but also Toy Story,

[02:26] who's also gonna be sitting on a ton of Venom Premiums,

[02:29] how are they gonna write a big check

[02:30] to order new games like Elton John?

[02:33] How are they gonna do it?

[02:34] We're definitely seeing a slowing down in the pinball market.

[02:38] And I also think a lot of it has to do

[02:40] with there hasn't really been a home run game since Godzilla.

[02:43] There hasn't really been a take my money now game

[02:45] like that game.

[02:47] Foo Fighters did really well.

[02:48] James Bond did okay.

[02:50] But we really haven't seen a game

[02:52] that just won over the imagination

[02:54] of the pinball buying community since Godzilla.

[02:57] Now look, if the year were to end today,

[02:59] absolutely Foo Fighters would win Game of the Year.

[03:03] It probably would win best art package of the year that

[03:06] or it would be Venom, which means Zambietti

[03:09] is hoisting up the trophy regardless.

[03:11] But I really do think we're starting to see people

[03:13] be a lot more cautious

[03:16] because nobody really wants to lose money, nobody.

[03:19] And now that we're seeing Godfather Ellie

[03:21] at 10, 6, 9, 9, not even unboxed,

[03:25] what do you think all these opened up

[03:26] Godfathers are gonna be worth?

[03:28] They're gonna be worth much less than that right now.

[03:31] And then I think we're gonna see these Godfather CEs

[03:34] just absolutely tank in value.

[03:36] They're gonna be $12,000 by the end of the year.

[03:39] And all of this just speaks to a larger issue.

[03:41] It's not just Jersey Jack.

[03:43] It's a larger issue happening in pinball.

[03:45] It is gonna be really hard to keep these prices this high

[03:49] and put these high prices on every single game

[03:52] you come out with, regardless of the theme,

[03:55] regardless of the demand, regardless of the toys in it.

[03:59] And I'm gonna do a whole nother podcast

[04:01] about mechanisms and toys coming up soon

[04:03] where we look at each company and we ask,

[04:05] hey, have they made a magical toy

[04:07] in the last like five or 10 years?

[04:09] I think it's gonna be really interesting

[04:11] when you see the criteria by which I'm gonna say

[04:13] what really makes a good pinball toy, right?

[04:16] It's like why we see games like Medieval Man

[04:18] still holding strong.

[04:19] Like the values are holding so strong.

[04:22] A game that's like 30 years old

[04:24] still has some of the coolest toys

[04:26] in the history of pinball.

[04:27] So the other thing that's interesting too is,

[04:29] we're seeing distributors like JJ at Game Exchange

[04:32] and he's like, make me an offer on Toy Story CE

[04:36] and Toy Story LE, cause I have them new in box.

[04:39] He won't even put a price on what he wants for those games.

[04:43] Make me an offer.

[04:44] Isn't make me an offer?

[04:45] I can't refuse a Godfather line,

[04:47] but it's all speaking to a larger issue.

[04:51] And for all of you out there who have waited this out,

[04:54] if you've waited on the sidelines like Canada,

[04:57] it is gonna be a really great 2024 for you

[05:00] because if you want any of these games,

[05:02] you're gonna be able to march in

[05:04] and get any of these games for thousands less

[05:07] than if you bought them in 2023.

[05:10] How is that not a good thing?

[05:12] And I think it's gonna send a message

[05:14] to all of these manufacturers.

[05:16] You just went a little too far, maybe a lot too far,

[05:19] but you really hit the ceiling and then some,

[05:22] and I think people are gonna hit pause more and more.

[05:25] All right, so speaking of that,

[05:27] do we think Spooky Pimball has a hit theme on their hand

[05:30] with Evil Dead?

[05:31] So here's what I'm hearing.

[05:33] Evil Dead is going to come out.

[05:35] It is a standard body game.

[05:36] The main mech in the game is the cabin that's in the movie.

[05:40] I think it's gonna be the original movie from 1981.

[05:44] Maybe it's gonna be Evil Dead one and two.

[05:46] I think fans of that franchise are hoping it's both of those,

[05:49] but I'm hearing that Spooky has that theme.

[05:52] Now, some of you are like,

[05:53] Canada, you already said it's Looney Tunes

[05:55] and you said it's the Princess Bride.

[05:57] Well, I'm also hearing Spooky has three titles secured

[06:01] so they could easily be working on

[06:03] all three of these titles, okay?

[06:05] So we will see what happens.

[06:07] They've still got a ways to go

[06:08] with all these Scooby-Doo's to build.

[06:10] I think we'll probably see a new Spooky machine

[06:13] sometime in the middle of next year.

[06:16] All right, so let's get to the data.

[06:19] So I asked people,

[06:20] what themes are you most excited about?

[06:23] Which ones have you the most excited?

[06:26] Now, you know me, I always harp on this.

[06:28] I think pinball companies do very little market research.

[06:32] Market research means you don't make galactic tank force.

[06:36] Market research means you do not make Toy Story 4 only.

[06:40] Market research would show you

[06:42] you do not do the Godfather pinball.

[06:45] If you simply go by your gut

[06:47] or pick a theme that might be popular somewhere else,

[06:50] like Godfather is hugely popular

[06:52] with the movie and the cinema buffs,

[06:54] but is it a good theme for pinball?

[06:56] No.

[06:57] Will it have tons of crossover

[06:59] with the pinball buying demographic?

[07:01] No.

[07:02] Simply because it's not a good theme

[07:04] and it's also a very old property.

[07:07] Now that does not mean that old properties can't work.

[07:10] You know, it's another old property.

[07:12] I love when people complain about Jaws.

[07:14] Another old property that came out right when Jaws came out

[07:17] is a little movie called Star Wars.

[07:20] So that works really well in pinball format.

[07:22] So I asked people out there to vote

[07:24] and they could vote more than once on which games

[07:27] they're most excited about from a theme point of view.

[07:31] Here is what we got back

[07:32] and I'm gonna read these in order of most popular,

[07:35] which means most people want these themes in pinball

[07:38] to the least popular.

[07:40] All right, are you ready?

[07:41] Let's do this.

[07:43] Number one on the list, out of 2,653 votes.

[07:47] That's a good sampling of this pinball market.

[07:50] Number one, number one with 409 votes

[07:54] is a little theme called Back to the Future.

[07:58] Obviously this is a game that a lot of people want.

[08:00] It's had a pinball machine before.

[08:03] It was never a great machine.

[08:05] And so if they can make this game,

[08:07] and you could just base this on the first movie,

[08:09] I think it would be great to base it on the first two movies

[08:12] because the second one is a lot of fun as well.

[08:15] I mean, who wouldn't want a hoverboard happening

[08:17] in a pinball machine, right?

[08:19] I don't think we need the third one.

[08:20] So I think you just do the first two.

[08:22] So Back to the Future,

[08:24] that's a Take My Money Now theme for a lot of people.

[08:26] It's a Take My Money Now theme for me personally.

[08:29] I launched Pepsi Perfect when Pepsi was a client at Comic-Con.

[08:33] I love this movie.

[08:35] It's perfect for pinball.

[08:36] The hard part is getting the assets,

[08:38] but if anyone can do it, it's gonna be stern pinball.

[08:41] And we're hearing rumors.

[08:42] I mean, this has been a rumored game forever.

[08:45] If it does happen,

[08:46] I think it's gonna be a Joe Kamnikau game.

[08:48] It's gonna be a Kapao title.

[08:49] And gosh, you know,

[08:51] as much as we complain about high prices right now,

[08:53] if Back to the Future comes out,

[08:55] may we all tell our wives and partners and kids

[08:58] we're not going on vacation this year

[09:00] because whatever it takes, we're gonna go get it.

[09:02] Number two, a very close second with 396 votes is Jaws.

[09:08] And I was surprised by this

[09:09] because a lot of people have been down on Jaws,

[09:11] but here's why I think people are loving this theme.

[09:14] And I think it's gonna do super well

[09:16] is that we know it's real.

[09:17] It's coming.

[09:18] Like this isn't just pure speculation.

[09:20] We also know it's gonna be Keith Elwin.

[09:23] So I think Jaws is gonna really surprise people.

[09:26] I think it's gonna be a humongous hit.

[09:28] If I were you,

[09:29] I would at least get on a distributor's list

[09:32] for Jaws right now.

[09:33] Mark my words, it's gonna be hard to get.

[09:36] After that, it gets really interesting.

[09:38] The next highest game with 196 votes is He-Man.

[09:44] A lot of people voted for He-Man.

[09:46] And you know, we hear a lot of polarizing things.

[09:49] Like it's too much of an 80s cartoon.

[09:51] I was just too old when it came out

[09:53] or I was too young when it came out.

[09:55] But He-Man Masters of the Universe

[09:56] is a great theme for pinball.

[09:58] If they do it right and get the original clips,

[10:01] I think it can work really well.

[10:03] So after He-Man with 186 votes is another game

[10:09] that is a recent rumor that we are hearing

[10:11] might be a Keith Elwin game or a John Bohr game.

[10:14] And that is John Wick.

[10:16] So John Wick is at the top of this list.

[10:19] It's a contemporary theme.

[10:20] And I think that's why John Wick has a lot of votes.

[10:23] I think people just want some new themes in pinball.

[10:26] We're tired of always looking backwards.

[10:29] Now, John Wick doesn't have the nostalgia factor,

[10:32] but it's an awesome movie.

[10:33] And if done right,

[10:35] I think it can make for a great pinball machine.

[10:37] After John Wick with 177 votes

[10:41] is the Tim Burton classic Beetlejuice.

[10:44] Beetlejuice would be a great theme for pinball.

[10:47] They just greenlit the sequel to the movie.

[10:50] It's gonna be in culture again.

[10:52] It's always been in culture.

[10:53] I think Beetlejuice is one of these great evergreen properties.

[10:57] I think it would be the first Tim Burton movie

[11:00] made into a pinball machine.

[11:02] And I would love,

[11:03] I would love, love, love to see them make

[11:05] a Peewee's big adventure game

[11:07] considering Peewee is no longer with us.

[11:10] So after Beetlejuice with 164 votes is the Matrix.

[11:15] Wow, the Matrix this far down the list.

[11:17] A little surprising for me, but another one

[11:20] where there's four movies, two of which are terrible.

[11:23] Matrix one and two are the ones

[11:25] you'd wanna make the pinball machine on.

[11:27] I actually would just make it

[11:28] based on the first movie only.

[11:30] I kinda feel like this trilogy didn't really work out

[11:33] and then the fourth one is just terrible.

[11:35] So Matrix, if done right.

[11:37] Now the rumor is,

[11:39] this is gonna be Dutch pinball's next game.

[11:41] And I think if Dutch makes this game,

[11:44] the way they integrate it, the Lebowski,

[11:46] if they integrate the Matrix in pinball format,

[11:49] I think this game is gonna be a knockout hit.

[11:52] Now, after the Matrix, surprising this one

[11:54] is this far down the list.

[11:56] With 159 votes, Harry Potter.

[12:00] The most expensive pinball license of all time,

[12:03] apparently, $10 million just to get it.

[12:06] But Harry Potter, you know,

[12:07] you think it would be more at the top of the list,

[12:09] but this kind of makes sense.

[12:11] Because Harry Potter isn't really

[12:13] within the 40 to 60 year old male demographic.

[12:17] It's not really the fantasy theme that you grew up with

[12:20] because you grew up with Star Wars.

[12:22] You grew up with Star Trek.

[12:23] You grew up with Lord of the Rings.

[12:25] And so Harry Potter, you know,

[12:27] has a humongous fan base around the world.

[12:30] But does it carry over into the pinball buying demographic

[12:34] and would getting the assets you need to make it right

[12:37] be worth spending 10 million on the license?

[12:41] And it's starting to look like the answer is no.

[12:44] So after Harry Potter,

[12:46] one of my favorite movies of all time

[12:48] with 136 votes is Top Gun.

[12:52] Now look, I'm very biased here.

[12:54] Top Gun is a take my money now theme for me.

[12:57] I think it's perfect for pinball.

[12:59] I think you can make either movie

[13:01] and it would work for pinball.

[13:03] Both of them are incredible.

[13:05] And we would love to see a Tom Cruise pinball machine

[13:08] for the first time.

[13:10] I also think because it's a Tom Cruise movie,

[13:12] that's why we'll probably never see it.

[13:15] Because I hear he's a nightmare

[13:17] to get approval for his licensing permission.

[13:20] All right, after Top Gun with 107 votes

[13:22] is the Evil Dead from Spooky Pinball.

[13:25] Now look, for Spooky to make Evil Dead work,

[13:28] they really only need to sell between 750 or 1000 of them.

[13:33] And I think if they license a theme like this,

[13:35] there's enough fan base around the world for Evil Dead

[13:39] for Spooky Pinball to sell 1000 units.

[13:42] What I don't think we're gonna see from Spooky

[13:44] is another like double run,

[13:46] like one layout over two themes.

[13:48] I also don't think they're gonna sell 2000 games

[13:52] like Scooby-Doo.

[13:53] It's too much.

[13:54] I think they need to figure out

[13:55] a better model moving forward.

[13:58] Everyone who buys a Spooky game now,

[14:00] the first time they open the order banks,

[14:02] you guys are all losing money.

[14:03] And who's gonna rush in again

[14:05] to buy a Spooky machine right away?

[14:07] If you just wait, you can then go get the machine

[14:10] for much less money than if you commit your dollars to them.

[14:13] And remember, all the Spooky deposits are non-refundable.

[14:17] So it really is a silly, silly thing to do

[14:19] is to give any of these companies non-refundable deposits,

[14:23] especially seeing the way the market

[14:25] has cooled off so much.

[14:27] So after the Evil Dead, with 101 votes,

[14:30] a little surprising it's this far down the list

[14:32] is Indiana Jones.

[14:34] Now look, the reason why I think Indiana Jones,

[14:36] people are kinda like, eh,

[14:37] like is it gonna be the original movies we love?

[14:40] Is the studio gonna make them do the most recent film,

[14:43] which was just okay.

[14:45] The last two ones were just okay.

[14:47] They were sort of mediocre.

[14:49] I think if you make this game,

[14:50] you've gotta make it based on the first three movies

[14:53] everybody loves, but I don't see them doing that.

[14:56] And I don't want all five of them in one pinball experience.

[15:00] And we already have one of the best

[15:01] Indiana Jones pinball machines ever

[15:03] in the Balli Williams game.

[15:05] So it's a weird game to try to go remake.

[15:08] Stern tried it and they failed horribly.

[15:10] So that is why I think people are sort of like, eh,

[15:13] we don't really need another Indiana Jones.

[15:16] After Indiana Jones with 84 votes is Sonic the Hedgehog.

[15:20] Who has this license?

[15:22] We know that someone took it from American pinball.

[15:25] We just don't know who.

[15:27] I can't imagine it's not Stern.

[15:29] Now look, I would love to see

[15:31] a Sonic the Hedgehog pinball machine.

[15:33] You gotta do the loop-to-loops.

[15:35] You gotta collect the gold coins.

[15:37] It would be perfect for pinball.

[15:39] Now look, Super Mario Brothers would be better,

[15:41] but we all know we're never getting

[15:42] a Super Mario Brothers pinball machine in modern time.

[15:45] But I think Sonic the Hedgehog, done right,

[15:48] with the colorful world of Sonic the Hedgehog

[15:51] would be a great pinball machine.

[15:54] That's why I'm not surprised Sonic got

[15:56] a somewhat decent amount of votes.

[15:58] After that with 82 votes is Metallica Vault Edition.

[16:02] And so look, I'm not surprised.

[16:03] People don't want to pay the high prices for Metallica.

[16:06] I'm not excited by really any Stern Vault editions

[16:09] unless it's Lord of the Rings and unless it's Tron.

[16:12] Those are the only two ones.

[16:14] I would love to see them redo, fix the artwork,

[16:18] and make some enhancements on the game packages overall.

[16:21] You don't need to do that with Metallica.

[16:23] It's already come out in so many trims.

[16:25] And what are you gonna do to enhance it?

[16:27] So like, I don't know why we need more.

[16:29] After that with 80 votes is Twilight Zone Remake.

[16:33] And after that with 69 votes is Whitewater 2.

[16:37] So some of these classic games,

[16:39] people definitely would buy them.

[16:41] If Twilight Zone came back,

[16:43] they would not have a problem selling it.

[16:45] I think the real issue would be

[16:47] how much do you charge for a Twilight Zone Remake?

[16:49] How much would you pay, right?

[16:51] They made a lot of them.

[16:52] They're floating all over the pinball space.

[16:55] I think the thing about Twilight Zone is this.

[16:56] It is loaded.

[16:58] It's not the best game from a gameplay standpoint.

[17:01] And it's a little bit overrated.

[17:03] I know, I know, don't kill me,

[17:04] but I do think Twilight Zone out of the older games,

[17:08] I do think it's a little bit overrated.

[17:10] I would rather have an Addams family, a Toten.

[17:14] There's just other games from that period

[17:15] that I think are better,

[17:16] medieval madness, Attack from Mars.

[17:18] Like those games are just better pinball experiences.

[17:21] Twilight Zone is a game that like newbies

[17:23] just fall in love with.

[17:24] It's like Wizard of Oz.

[17:25] They walk up to it and they see so much stuff

[17:29] that it just wins them over by the sheer amount of stuff

[17:32] that's going on under glass.

[17:34] But here's the thing people,

[17:35] put a Twilight Zone next to a Godfather's CE

[17:38] and a Venom LE and one is 13,000 and one is 15,000.

[17:43] Twilight Zone looks like in the current marketplace,

[17:46] it would cost $37,000.

[17:48] So I don't know how they're gonna make this game

[17:51] and price it, but man, if they can get the price right,

[17:55] you know, how come CGC can figure out

[17:57] how to put everything and then some into Cactus Canyon

[18:00] and only charge people $9,000?

[18:02] Why is Stern charging for a game like Venom

[18:05] with so little in it?

[18:06] And that's the other reason why I think people are just like,

[18:08] huh, it doesn't make sense.

[18:10] Like it doesn't make sense.

[18:10] Like these guys are totally over-inflating the price

[18:14] with greed.

[18:15] It's not getting into the game.

[18:16] And that's why people are just hitting pause

[18:18] and saying, nope, I don't see the value.

[18:21] All right, so after Whitewater,

[18:22] we've got with 56 votes, a Big Bang Bar remake.

[18:26] All right, well, that's a rumor that's been floating around.

[18:29] I think out of all these remakes,

[18:31] we're most likely gonna see Big Bang Bar

[18:33] unveiled at Chicago Expo in October

[18:36] by Padready Gaming in partnership with Planetary.

[18:39] That's my bet.

[18:40] Now we're getting towards the end of the list.

[18:43] And this is a problem for a company that you know all too well.

[18:47] After that, with just 50 votes is Elton John.

[18:51] And if you're Jersey Jack

[18:53] and you need your next pinball machine to be a hit,

[18:56] like Elton John is coming people

[18:58] and you see it this far down the list

[19:01] of what people are excited about.

[19:04] I think someone needs to raise the red flag over at JJP.

[19:08] They need to call a huddle

[19:10] and they need to figure something out

[19:12] because this is not working.

[19:14] These are not the themes people want

[19:16] and they need to get their ducks in a row.

[19:18] And I think the sad reality is Jack Guinari,

[19:22] his name is on the company.

[19:24] He's the one who's been steering the ship

[19:26] on theme selection.

[19:28] He's the one who picked Toy Story 4.

[19:30] He's the one who picked Godfather.

[19:32] He's the one who picked Elton John.

[19:35] I don't get it.

[19:35] I really don't get it.

[19:37] It's a head scratcher.

[19:38] After Elton John with 49 votes is the Princess Bride.

[19:42] I totally understand why this niche movie

[19:45] is all the way down here.

[19:46] It is a cult classic.

[19:48] And again, I think if Spooky just made like 500 of them

[19:51] or a thousand, I think they would find buyers for it.

[19:54] But it's definitely not one of the more popular themes

[19:57] out of all the rumors we're hearing about.

[19:59] And then right after that with 46 votes is Looney Tunes.

[20:03] So again, here we're in the section of

[20:04] if I had themes that were only getting this many votes,

[20:07] I would be nervous.

[20:08] I think all these themes right now,

[20:10] Looney Tunes, Princess Bride, Elton John,

[20:13] you know, I think you're starting out with two strikes.

[20:16] Nobody's on base, right?

[20:18] When you have Back to the Future,

[20:19] it's bases loaded in a 3-0 count

[20:22] and the next pitch is a fastball right down the middle.

[20:24] That's what's gonna happen with Back to the Future.

[20:26] That's what's gonna happen with Jaws.

[20:28] But man, when you've got Looney Tunes

[20:30] and Princess Bride and Elton John,

[20:32] I think you're staring down the barrel of a gun.

[20:35] And if you don't get it right,

[20:37] in this marketplace with these prices,

[20:39] it's gonna be really, really difficult for these companies

[20:42] to justify some of these themes and some of these prices.

[20:45] All right, the final four with 36 votes.

[20:48] Marty Robbins is War of the Worlds.

[20:51] All right, well look, not very popular.

[20:53] I don't know if we're ever gonna see the game.

[20:55] I think Haggis is saying

[20:56] that they're gonna fill up a container.

[20:58] I've been reading this on Pinsight.

[20:59] Everyone's getting all excited.

[21:00] They've never been able to fill up a container.

[21:03] Here's the one thing I'm asking of Marty and Damien.

[21:06] If you fill up a container, can you do us a favor?

[21:08] Take a picture of it.

[21:09] I would love to see you finally, after three years,

[21:13] fill up a freaking shipping container

[21:15] for the people who put deposits down on these games.

[21:18] So they don't have to spend like $1,800

[21:20] on air-frating the machine to their house.

[21:22] All right, after that, the final three with 24 votes,

[21:27] Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary Edition.

[21:29] We don't want any more Jurassic Parks.

[21:33] I think people know if they do this,

[21:35] it's gonna be like in Elvira 40th

[21:37] and Stern's gonna try to charge $25,000

[21:40] and that's why nobody's really excited for it.

[21:44] After that, this is shocking with 18 votes.

[21:47] Avatar, Avatar.

[21:50] And we know the rumor is that Jersey Jack

[21:52] might have Avatar.

[21:53] That might be Mark Saden's game.

[21:56] I hope it's not Avatar now because it's second to last.

[21:59] The only game it beat out on this list

[22:01] with just six votes was Food Truck.

[22:05] Food Truck.

[22:06] It's rumor that American Pinball

[22:07] might be making a single level version

[22:09] of Barry O's Food Truck.

[22:11] The six votes here were probably

[22:13] from the employees at American Pinball.

[22:15] So there you have it, people.

[22:17] A really interesting journey

[22:19] into the themes that are rumored,

[22:21] how excited people are.

[22:23] And if I was just to have a crystal ball,

[22:26] I think Stern's got the big themes ready to go.

[22:29] I think Jersey Jack does not.

[22:31] I think American Pinball is lost.

[22:34] I think Spooky Pinball is gonna be fine.

[22:36] They're gonna pick themes that they know

[22:38] they can sell like a thousand of

[22:40] and they've got a little niche community.

[22:42] But Spooky Pinball needs to get their quality up.

[22:44] But otherwise, I'm never really worried about Spooky

[22:47] because as much as we say,

[22:48] oh, we're never buying from them again

[22:50] because of the quality and then this and then that.

[22:53] And then every time they launch a game

[22:54] because they're so damn friendly and nice, we buy it.

[22:57] And it's a no-friil purchase.

[22:59] You know you're gonna get it.

[23:00] I think CGC is gonna be fine with Pulp Fiction.

[23:03] And then Mark Ritchie has another game coming out after that.

[23:06] One of these might be Mark Ritchie's game.

[23:08] So that's exciting.

[23:09] You know, we hear American Pinball might have He-Man.

[23:11] And if you look at this,

[23:12] He-Man is number three on the list.

[23:15] So if you're David Fix and you have He-Man,

[23:18] why would you make Galactic Tank Force?

[23:20] Why would you waste a day even bothering

[23:23] with original IP stuff when you've got

[23:26] the third most popular theme on this list

[23:29] voted by 2,653 people.

[23:32] You've never sold 2,653 games.

[23:36] So look, this market research is important.

[23:39] You know, what's interesting about this industry

[23:40] is they always wanna keep everything secret.

[23:43] They wanna create FOMO on launch day.

[23:45] And that's why they never tell you

[23:47] what their release schedule is gonna be.

[23:48] And I think it's starting to bite

[23:50] some of these companies in the rear end.

[23:52] And it doesn't always work.

[23:54] You can't implement the same marketing strategy

[23:57] regardless of theme, regardless of what the game is.

[24:00] If American Pinball got out in front of people more

[24:03] with Galactic Tank Force,

[24:05] the reception would have been different.

[24:07] Same thing with Godfather.

[24:09] Same thing with Toy Story 4.

[24:11] You've gotta give people time to warm up the stuff

[24:15] that is not stuff they really want.

[24:17] You've gotta convince them.

[24:18] What do I know about marketing?

[24:20] I've only been doing it for 20 years.

[24:22] Everybody, thank you for being a member

[24:24] of the Canadian Club.

[24:25] More shows probably coming this week.

[24:26] If not Friday, you're gonna get

[24:28] Saturday Morning Spectacular.

[24:30] Thank you.

[24:31] Let me know in the comments section

[24:32] which of these games you are most excited for.

[24:35] We'll talk to you soon.
