[00:00] Oh, you love me more than anyone, yeah, we were up so high, we were lost when we were young, but you were mine once upon a time.

[00:13] No, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars, Cedars!

[00:43] Are they gonna mix it up? I've heard from some people that Stern delayed everything by a month, so if you were expecting a game in August, that might not happen until September.

[00:54] Nobody really knows, it's coming any day now. It is now a horse race, we're gonna talk about this, it is a horse race.

[01:02] On whether or not distributors can get people to pay for their Toy Story Collector's editions before Stern shows its next game.

[01:12] I'm really excited watching this thing happen, because you know and I know that there are gonna be some people holding the bag.

[01:20] And if Stern comes out with a game that blows people away, that gets people excited, that has like a lot of toys in it, and's got sexy artwork,

[01:29] and it's gonna feel like a bargain regardless of what's in it.

[01:32] This is the thing, we're gonna talk about this, something happened, once you price your game at 15k, everything seems like a deal right now.

[01:42] Someone said it the best, they're like, you could pretty much get a Cactus Canyon LE that comes with probably the best topper in the history of Pinball,

[01:53] and a Stern Pro for just a smidgen more than a Toy Story Collector's edition.

[02:01] That's insane! You know they jumped too far, they jumped too far with a game that had too little in it.

[02:07] We're gonna talk about that, we're gonna talk about what distors are telling Toy Story 4 CE buyers they can expect.

[02:15] Cause it's interesting, you're spending the most money ever on a pinball machine, and it's still pretty ambiguous when you're gonna get your game.

[02:24] I also wanna talk a little bit about Spooky on this episode, we haven't talked about Spooky much, but there are some threads starting to pop up now that are speculating on something I've wanted to discuss with all of you.

[02:36] And that is whether or not we think these games, Halloween and Ultraman, if they're going to have a rebound on value, now that Spooky is getting near the end of the run on both games, can they turn the corner?

[02:51] Are they gonna go up on value? They've both lost a lot of value, I wanna talk about that and what my feelings are on both of these titles.

[02:59] So let's talk timing though about Stern's next game, so do we think it's going to be James Bond?

[03:05] Do we think it's gonna be Venom? Or do we think it's gonna be the wild card back to the future? I don't think it's gonna be back to the future.

[03:14] So let's talk about James Bond first, because the 60th anniversary James Bond activities are going on this year, and there is a huge Sotheby's auction that's based all on the old James Bond stuff.

[03:28] And that auction is happening. Are you sitting down? The 25th of August through the 8th of September. So it is going on right now, and it is going on for the next two weeks.

[03:42] So do we think that Stern Pinball is gonna come out in the middle of all of this James Bond anniversary frenzy and drop a James Bond pinball machine based on a Sean Connery James Bond film?

[03:56] Now you know I'm on the record for saying I heard it might be Thunderball, it might not. My bet is it's going to be a single Sean Connery movie.

[04:04] I don't think you're gonna see like multiple James Bond films in one machine. I think it would be a licensing nightmare for them, and you know Stern, they know they don't have to spend that much.

[04:16] If they just get the old license, they're gonna do it justice. And then let's talk about Venom. So Venom would be a great title to get out right now in September, because you've got Comic Con the first week of October in New York City, which is a humongous deal.

[04:34] The other thing is this, in all of our years following pinball, nobody ever seems to be able to time up the launch of a game with any of these milestone moments happening with the properties, right?

[04:44] Stern never even gets Star Wars out in time to hit the May 4th news or to get to the Star Wars convention. It's always after that. So there's always a delay.

[04:53] But looking at this James Bond date, it starts to make total sense now, if it is James Bond, that this would be when they would hit with it, right? It makes total sense.

[05:04] It also makes sense that they would bring James Bond out now and keep Venom for a later date, because I think Venom could come out whenever, because it's just the comic book version of Venom.

[05:16] But this is really a year in which we're celebrating old James Bond. And so that is my bet. I think it's going to be James Bond. There is a poll on pin side. Would you rather have Venom or James Bond?

[05:28] And it's pretty evenly split. It's like 53% is for James Bond, 47% for Venom. So the community is divided on both of these games. If it is James Bond, I do expect Joe Kamikau to be a part of it.

[05:45] And I do think you're going to see something crazy. And I mean it, I think you're going to see something crazy, like a 60 numbered limited edition super le crazy price version of the game.

[05:56] If it is the 60th anniversary of James Bond, I could see them doing something similar to Elvira's like 40th or Batman's 50th. And I think they're going to make just 60 with some like Aston Martin, like on the cabinet.

[06:12] And I think it's going to be like $25,000 or $20,000. And you know that if Stern makes only 60 of a super rare version, they will get it. History has shown that you guys have faith and deep wallets when it comes to these super rare stern machines.

[06:31] Do I want to spend 20 to $25,000 on a pinball machine? No. What Stern will most likely do is they will give those 60 SLEs to distributors for 15 grand and they will let the distributors set the price.

[06:45] See, Stern's pretty smart. They make the distributors the bad guys, right? They make the distributors be the ones who are like, well, they're the ones who are inflating the price. They almost give their distributors a chance to act like scalpers and flippers.

[06:59] Remember, because they never set the price for Elvira 40th. They sold it to distros at 15. And anything a distro could get over that was money in their pocket.

[07:08] It's just a nice way for Stern to hook up all of its distributors with a game that makes them a lot of money. Jersey Jack has never done that. CGC has never done that. Nobody's ever done that for distributors.

[07:19] Looking back on it now, it would have been smart when CGC came out with the medieval madness royal edition if they gave distributors a chance to set the price on it.

[07:30] They all silly and foolishly sold every single one for 10k and then a year later distros watch those games go for $20,000.

[07:39] And I think a lot of these distributors are starting to learn their lesson. Our good friend Zach Menne's learned his lesson. He's got the vault now. Have you seen this? He's got a vault on his flipping out site.

[07:50] And in the vault is hard to find games and items and he's selling them for like the market value. If you want a Godzilla LE, how about $19,000 for one?

[08:01] And if you're a Zach and if you're another distributor, I would absolutely hold back at least one LE, one CE, one pro, one premium.

[08:11] Just hold back one version of every game and every topper and just wait a couple years and you can jack the price up once the game goes out of production.

[08:21] I mean, it's just a super smart move because that can make $1,500 on a Godzilla LE today if he sells everything at price or he can make $9,000.

[08:30] You tell me what puts more food on the table and the many household. Okay. I would absolutely do the same thing. I think there's nothing wrong with it.

[08:37] So let's see what happens this week. The other crazy thing and I've just been thinking about this because I'm like, you know what?

[08:43] And this is just maybe a crazy pipe dream. But I know that George Gomez absolutely loves Christopher Franci's artwork.

[08:51] It was never Gomez that had the problem with Franci. It was other people at Stern.

[08:56] I also know that Joe Kamikau is working with Christopher Franci throughout the years and they're friends too.

[09:02] Now, I'm just going to throw this out there because I think if there's anybody out there in the pinball world that would love to troll us, that would love to mislead us, it would be Franci.

[09:14] I think there might be a slim chance. It is a slim chance that we are going to see Franci's artwork on this James Bond game because the game is going to be a capoe game and not a Stern.

[09:28] And that is how they're going to spin it. That Joe Kamikau commissioned Franci to make the artwork for his game and it is being manufactured by Stern Pinball.

[09:37] I know this is a pipe dream and it also doesn't make sense because Franci said watch out for his next game in October and it is now September, August.

[09:47] So look, it's probably not going to happen. I wish it would happen because his artwork on James Bond is incredible.

[09:55] He's done some James Bond stuff in the past and I think it's going to be something else.

[09:59] But I just wanted to throw it out there that there might be a Hail Mary chance in a million years that we see Franci's art on another Stern machine.

[10:06] All right, let's talk about totally story collectors editions and I got an email and I got a few emails from distributors because I was in on a collector's edition.

[10:15] And so here's what's happening right now. These distributors need to find buyers for the games they bought.

[10:22] But here is what they're telling consumers. The collectors editions are now shipping and they are on the line.

[10:28] They're also telling consumers, I don't know what number games I have.

[10:34] They're also telling consumers that I don't know when you're going to get your game, but your game order might come up any day now.

[10:43] Now you can let them know if you'd rather be at the end of the line and delay paying for your game.

[10:50] See, I don't think that makes any sense. If you're going to get this game, my advice is this.

[10:54] Just get it now, get it over with and then determine if you want to have it or not in your home.

[11:00] But you might as well play the game a little bit because if you put yourself to the end of the line, here's what's going to happen.

[11:06] You're going to watch this game go down and down and down in value and then the likelihood of you wanting to send in another check for 12.5 is going to diminish.

[11:19] Once the new Stern game comes out, it is going to be a tragic moment for all of these people who are in on a 15K machine.

[11:28] Because mark my words, here's what's going to happen.

[11:30] There is going to be more in a $9000 Stern premium than is in a $15,000 Jersey Jack Toy Story game.

[11:41] There is no way around the fact that they're just making too many.

[11:45] Here's the other part that I do find comical is these distributors, they're trying to create this like hype that doesn't exist.

[11:53] They're saying stuff like, you know how popular this game is. It's sold out in one day.

[11:59] Like there was such demand for this game. And then on the very next message, they're saying, but if you know someone who wants one, let us know because we have units available.

[12:08] It is not sold out. It's sold through in one day.

[12:12] But there is no way there are a thousand people willing to buy this game right now.

[12:19] They're making too many. It's too expensive and there's not enough in the game.

[12:24] That is the overwhelming consensus on this game.

[12:28] Yes, the game is fun to shoot. It's maybe one of Jersey Jack's better shooting games.

[12:33] But the game is pretty empty compared to everything else Jersey Jack has made.

[12:38] So let's compare this launch to Guns N' Roses and Willy Wonka.

[12:41] Guns N' Roses had the most demand maybe ever on day one for a Jersey Jack machine.

[12:46] They sold out immediately of 500 CEs at $12,500.

[12:52] If they made a thousand of those CEs, they would have sold probably a thousand at $12,500.

[12:59] But they would not have sold a thousand at $15,000 each.

[13:04] They just wouldn't have. That's just twice as many would have been available.

[13:08] And it's a lot of money for a lot of people.

[13:11] Here's the thing too, is when Guns N' Roses came out,

[13:13] what I like about Guns N' Roses and I like about Eric and the difference between his LEDs and his CEs,

[13:19] there's a significant difference in his games.

[13:22] When you look at the LED of Guns N' Roses, it's gorgeous in its own right.

[13:27] And the art package on that machine is absolutely incredible.

[13:30] A lot of people would argue that the art package on the LED is better than the CE.

[13:35] But the CE is also a gorgeous work of art that just goes in a different artistic direction

[13:41] with the purple and, you know, the appetite for destruction machine on the cabinet and all that stuff.

[13:46] It looks phenomenal.

[13:48] They both look phenomenal and they look radically different.

[13:52] When you look at Toy Story, LED and CE, look at the cabinet artwork, look at the play field artwork,

[13:59] look at the games themselves.

[14:01] They're not that radically different.

[14:03] It's really just different colored armor.

[14:05] And remember with Guns N' Roses Collector's Edition,

[14:08] the artwork on the play field was different than the artwork on the play field of the LED.

[14:15] On Toy Story, they made absolutely no differences.

[14:19] And so when Guns N' Roses came out, you had $9,500 was the price of the LED, $9,500.

[14:26] And then $12,500 was the CE.

[14:28] Now you've got the LED of Freakin' Toy Story is $12,000.

[14:34] And they're giving you a game that's got less in it, less differences, less artistic moves, less everything.

[14:42] It just makes absolutely no sense and the market is speaking.

[14:45] So now the question becomes this, how many of you out there are going to walk away from your deposits?

[14:53] How many of you out there are going to take possession of the game and at least enjoy it for a little bit and then sell it?

[15:00] The reality is this, everybody out there who's about to get a game is going to lose money.

[15:06] I'm not going to tell you that you're not going to have fun, but you are guaranteed to lose money on this game.

[15:12] Did you see the first dude who's got a new and box CE?

[15:14] He lists it for sale on Pinside for $16,500.

[15:20] Do you know this guy also has an LED and he's got to move one of them and he's selling an LED for $11,000.

[15:27] So he's trying to make up the loss on his LED by increasing the price of his CE.

[15:32] He's about to lose money.

[15:33] I'll tell you why because I just sold a CE for $14,000.

[15:36] My friend Derek sold one for $13,000 and you're going to see more and more of these games being sold at fire sale prices because people are not going to go in at $15,000.

[15:46] We all know the way this is going to go.

[15:47] They're not going to make all $1,000.

[15:49] They are absolutely not going to make all $1,000 of the game.

[15:52] This is going to have a very short production run, but let's just say the demand is there and this is Jersey Jack's first $1,000 CE game.

[16:01] I have a very simple question.

[16:03] How many games are they making a week?

[16:05] How long until you get your game?

[16:07] I think they need to get these games out fast.

[16:10] I think they need to tell people what game number you are and when you can expect your game.

[16:14] But the whole thing is kind of ambiguous and I think they're going to learn a lesson from this.

[16:18] They definitely are going to learn a lesson from this.

[16:20] This is a marketing lesson.

[16:22] Someone over there made the marketing decision to price it at that and make twice as many units as they normally make.

[16:30] Here's the problem in pinball these days is like once all these companies started to make everything a thousand LEs for Stern and a thousand CEs for Jersey Jack Pinball,

[16:39] The problem now is this.

[16:41] They're not really adding a ton of value to those games because the supply of those games is so high.

[16:48] What they've really done and you're seeing it in the marketplace, what increasing the number to a thousand has done,

[16:55] it's just made the old LEs and the old CEs in which there were only 500, right?

[17:02] That was the magic number for Stern LEs 500 for Jersey Jack CEs 500 or 250 or like even like 150 I think dialed in and only 200 Pirate CEs.

[17:13] All this is doing is jacking up the price of the real stuff that now feels rare and feels exclusive and feels limited because there's nothing limited about a thousand pinball machines that cost well over 10 or 12 or $15,000.

[17:31] That's not limited.

[17:32] You'll get one easily if you offer those kinds of prices.

[17:36] But this is why we're seeing games like Ghostbusters and games like Stranger Things and games like The Monsters.

[17:42] We're seeing these games go up and up and up in value simply because there's not that many.

[17:48] Look, I think at the end of the day, the distros are going to be holding the bag on Toy Story 4 CE.

[17:53] I don't think they're going to be telling JJP that there's strong demand and I don't think they're going to make all of them.

[17:59] We'll see if I'm right or wrong.

[18:01] All right, speaking of The Monsters, I want to just say real quickly, there's been a great discussion on my Patreon page about Mr.

[18:09] John Borg.

[18:10] Now, I've always said I think John Borg is a great designer over at Stern Pinball.

[18:14] I have not knocked John Borg's designs.

[18:17] I will just say this about John Borg games.

[18:20] For the most part, Borg has his formula the same way George Gomez does and Borg designs, you know, they're not always the most

[18:29] original.

[18:30] And so here's the thing.

[18:31] I think if you own a great John Borg game or two, you don't feel compelled to sort of chase after every new John Borg game.

[18:41] I'm not saying he's not a great designer.

[18:43] He is.

[18:44] But there's just a lot of similarity in the design.

[18:48] And that's a fair point.

[18:49] When it comes to monsters, I just want to say this once and for all, the Monsters code is nowhere near as good as games like

[18:58] Batman 66 as games like Godzilla.

[19:01] There are just so many other games out there that have such better code than the Monsters.

[19:07] And when you jump on Batman 66, that's how you wanted the Monsters to be.

[19:12] You wanted to see this overload of integration with the show you loved and all these clips and all this campiness.

[19:19] It doesn't even come close to what Batman has in it.

[19:22] And then I'm just going to end the point with this.

[19:23] Yes, the game is gorgeous.

[19:25] The game is beautiful.

[19:26] But the lower play field is so unsatisfying.

[19:29] The little pinball they put down there, it's too light.

[19:32] You don't feel anything.

[19:34] It's so numb when you're down there.

[19:35] It's just the wrong weight of that mini pinball.

[19:38] And I just don't like it.

[19:40] I don't think it adds anything to the game.

[19:43] And yes, I haven't played Monsters in a home environment for hours and hours and hours,

[19:48] but I've been following this hobby for years and I've seen the response to the Monsters.

[19:53] You know, and this is a good segue into spooky pinball because I think what's happening now too is

[19:58] you get these like fanboys who after two years, the company decides to make the game better.

[20:04] And now we're all supposed to run back to it,

[20:07] play the final version of the game and make up our mind now.

[20:11] I'm sorry, but at these price points with all of these games,

[20:15] I want these games to come out from the manufacturer in the first few months and be amazing.

[20:21] I don't want to have to wait two years for code updates and neither should you.

[20:25] When Rush came out, it's pretty much code complete.

[20:27] Same thing with Godzilla.

[20:29] Stern is not launching games anymore where you have to wait forever to get the code.

[20:34] All right.

[20:34] So let's end this show with Spooky's games and whether or not Halloween and Ultraman,

[20:39] but mainly Halloween.

[20:41] I think Halloween is the one people talk about as a game that once they stop making all 1250,

[20:47] will this game have a better second life?

[20:50] Will people look at this game a year from now and still want it?

[20:54] Will the demand for this game go up in value?

[20:57] Now look, you've got your fanboys who will start a post saying,

[21:00] this game is bolted to my floor.

[21:02] It's amazing.

[21:03] It's incredible.

[21:04] I don't understand why people don't see that.

[21:07] Distributors are buying these games back and making a ton of money on them.

[21:10] I think the problems with Spooky right now is there's still a pretty young company, right?

[21:15] I know they've been around for eight, nine years, but there's still a young company.

[21:19] And this is why they're a young company.

[21:21] They're not a company that's been used to success year after year after year.

[21:27] They're not.

[21:28] They really only had one humongously successful game and that was Rick and Morty.

[21:34] And they use the success of Rick and Morty to then create the kind of demand they got for these two games.

[21:41] And it put them in the driver's seat, right?

[21:43] Rick and Morty put Spooky Pinball in the driver's seat and then Spooky Pinball started to do stuff

[21:49] that was reflective of the other manufacturer's marketing decisions.

[21:53] I also think Spooky Pinball, when it comes to their marketing, they need to start reevaluating stuff.

[21:59] Now, look, they sold every game on day one before they even showed product.

[22:05] Now, in the marketing world, if you can do that, then you don't need me.

[22:09] Like, you don't need any help.

[22:11] You don't need any advice.

[22:12] You don't need to do anything differently.

[22:15] That is an incredible feat.

[22:17] And I think the fact that they were able to do that, I think it speaks volumes to the confidence people had with Spooky Pinball.

[22:23] I think they built a lot of goodwill over the years.

[22:26] I think they're a family-run business.

[22:29] And I think there's always been a sort of connection between the Pinball community and Spooky Pinball.

[22:34] They were always like the David versus Goliath.

[22:37] And I think people really enjoyed supporting them over the years and they still do enjoy supporting them currently.

[22:43] They cashed in all the goodwill with these two games.

[22:46] And it hasn't really worked out for most people.

[22:49] It's not that I think they took advantage of that goodwill.

[22:52] You know how I feel?

[22:53] I just don't think that the games we're seeing right now, these two games, I just don't think the design is there.

[23:00] I don't think the code is there.

[23:02] I don't think these games have the same level of polish or depth as we see from other Pinball manufacturers.

[23:09] But it's also little spooky and bent in Wisconsin, right?

[23:12] You can't expect to get the same amount of stuff.

[23:15] In a Spooky game, as you will, in a Stern game or a Jersey Jack game.

[23:20] So everybody knows that, right?

[23:21] No one's like disillusioned.

[23:23] And even though these games cost around the same amount of money now as a Stern machine,

[23:29] there's nobody out there who thinks they're going to get apples to apples like Spooky versus Stern.

[23:34] Now that being said, I think the reason why these games tanked so hard value-wise,

[23:40] it's not just because like these were all scalpers and flippers.

[23:43] That's not the reason why.

[23:45] The games launched in horrible condition.

[23:48] And you really do only get one chance to make a first impression.

[23:53] And when the first impression on these games was so bad, and it was bad for months,

[23:59] it wasn't like they had a quick code update that fixed stuff.

[24:02] It's been a long journey to get to where we are today.

[24:07] If Spooky Pinball launched Halloween in its current form on day one,

[24:13] yes, the perception and the feeling towards the game would have been much better.

[24:19] Yes, we probably would not have seen so many people panic and run for the hills,

[24:24] but they didn't do that.

[24:26] And when you make people wait a really long time, people start to develop more disinterest.

[24:33] They start to lose confidence.

[24:35] And the whole process is just fatiguing, you know, waiting and waiting and waiting.

[24:40] And yes, look, I think the code is better on both games.

[24:43] I think people are enjoying the games more.

[24:45] But I also think the layout and the design of these games is not a design

[24:52] that people are going to want to bolt to their floor.

[24:55] If you play a Halloween and then you walk over to a Godzilla or you walk over to a rush,

[25:02] you know, you walk over to a Mandalorian or a stranger things,

[25:06] it's just this simple people.

[25:08] Almost every single Stern pinball machine ever made still shoots better than Halloween.

[25:15] That's just the way it is.

[25:16] Like they don't have the design there yet.

[25:19] They're getting there.

[25:20] They're getting better.

[25:21] But from a design standpoint, if you're someone who loves shooting pinball machines,

[25:26] you are not going to walk up to these Halloween and Ultramans and really enjoy the way they shoot.

[25:33] There aren't any toys in the games whatsoever.

[25:36] They don't have any toys in them.

[25:38] Like from a mechanical engineering standpoint, there's really nothing fun to bash.

[25:42] There's nothing fun happening with like magnets and there's no like building like in Godzilla.

[25:47] They just don't have the engineers and they're not putting stuff into these games

[25:52] that have like a lot of wow to them, you know, so they need to rely more on light shows and on code.

[25:58] Like right when you can't afford to do it mechanically,

[26:01] you've got to figure out a way to wow people with the lights and with the code and with the callouts,

[26:07] you know, and you get into that.

[26:08] But the problem again in pinball is we've just seen companies like Jersey Jack pinball elevate what a light show can be.

[26:16] And Rick and Morty arguably have the best light show in all of spooky pinball history.

[26:20] And I don't think there's anything happening from a musical or a light show standpoint

[26:24] that's in Ultraman or Halloween that's even nearly as good as TNA or Rick and Morty.

[26:30] Scott Denisi really knows how to orchestrate music and lights to go together in such an amazing way.

[26:36] Here's my main issue with spooky though, and I think they're pricing and I want them to address this right now.

[26:41] Spooky pinball ostensibly sells each and every one of us when we buy a game from them.

[26:47] They basically have a three tiered model.

[26:50] It is basically like their version of a pro, a premium and an elite.

[26:55] But their three tiered is really weird when you think about it.

[26:58] They basically say on day one, we will make as many collectors additions as people want.

[27:04] Can you imagine if Stern said, we're going to make as many le's as you want?

[27:09] What would happen to the price of the le?

[27:12] What would happen to the volume of le orders?

[27:15] All of a sudden, if you did that, you'd actually have more le's being made than premiums.

[27:21] And that's what's happening with spooky pinball.

[27:24] The cheapest version of Stern's machine, the pro version, always has stuff taken out.

[27:29] There's not as much mechanically in the machine.

[27:32] When you buy the standard version of spooky pinball's game,

[27:35] there's nothing from the gameplay or mechanical standpoint that's taken out of the game.

[27:41] So when people always complain like, spookies are not worth eight, nine, ten thousand dollars,

[27:45] the truth is when it comes to just what's physically in the game,

[27:50] spooky pinball is pricing their machine at six thousand nine hundred and ninety five dollars.

[27:57] That is what this machine is worth before you add all the unnecessary bells and whistles

[28:03] before you add like the knocker kit, the shaker kit, interactive RGB speaker kit and standard grill.

[28:10] You know, powder coating, they're not adding more toys into the game

[28:13] when you buy the bloodsucker edition or the collectors edition.

[28:16] And then you get obviously this topper that probably cost them nothing to make.

[28:21] So I just think spooky pinball moving forward, you know, they need to figure this part out

[28:24] because the fact is between a standard edition for seven grand

[28:29] and one with a butter cabinet, which is closer to eleven grand,

[28:33] it's all just the same game, right?

[28:36] The other thing is this, does spooky pinball change the artwork

[28:40] between the standard, between the bloodsucker and the collectors editions?

[28:44] They do not.

[28:45] And if they want to charge these prices, they need to start making these games more unique from each other

[28:51] because then every single game looks the same.

[28:54] The tier system starts to mean nothing.

[28:56] And then when your most expensive tier is also the one that has the greatest volume out there,

[29:02] that's why the value goes down.

[29:04] You're not making the most expensive the scarcest, which is silly.

[29:08] You're not making it any different art wise, which is silly.

[29:11] It's really strange.

[29:12] It's like, I get what they're going for.

[29:14] Like they're the opposite of what Stern tries to do and what Jersey Jack tries to do.

[29:19] Spooky wants to make every fan of that theme happy who wants all the bells and whistles.

[29:24] Like I get that approach.

[29:26] It's a very earnest and heartfelt approach.

[29:29] Problem is, it's just going to burn everybody this time.

[29:31] Because if you really love Halloween and you spend around $9,000 on a CE,

[29:37] the truth is this, you could wake up today and if you didn't go in on day one,

[29:41] you can now save yourself $2,000 and go get the pin this week.

[29:46] So they basically burned everybody who's a diehard fan of the theme who went in on day one.

[29:51] They got burned.

[29:52] They got burned.

[29:53] Patients would have saved you a couple thousand dollars.

[29:56] I'll just end this podcast by saying these games are not going to turn around.

[30:00] They're not going to turn around because the dirty little secret is the majority of people

[30:05] who love shooting pinball machines, they know the design is not there in these games.

[30:11] They can't always say it on pin side, but you talk to anyone who's a real good pinball player,

[30:16] and that is where these games are falling down.

[30:18] It's not even about the code.

[30:20] It's not even about like the call-outs.

[30:22] It's not about the hedge multi-boss.

[30:24] It's about the fact that the design is just not there.

[30:28] It's going to get there.

[30:29] And the other reason why these games are not going to go up in value

[30:32] is because their next game is going to be better.

[30:34] And Stern's next games are going to be amazing.

[30:36] And Jersey Jack's next games are going to be great.

[30:39] And everyone's going to keep making good pinball.

[30:41] Like there's so much great pinball coming.

[30:44] And I just think chasing after like mediocre games from like a couple years ago,

[30:48] that's not going to be something people wake up for.

[30:51] There's just too much pinball coming down the pipeline.

[30:54] The only reason to buy this game a year from now is you're going to be able to get it for like 6500 bucks.

[30:59] Mark my word.

[31:00] Both these games, Ultraman and Halloween,

[31:03] they will lose another thousand dollars off in a year, not gain a thousand dollars.

[31:09] I think you're going to see collector's editions of both trading for around the price of a Stern Pro.

[31:14] Just wait.

[31:15] Once the volume's out there, these aren't going to be both of the floor games.

[31:19] People are going to want to move them out.

[31:20] And guess what?

[31:21] They're going to want to move them out to get the next spooky game

[31:24] because it's going to be so much better.

[31:26] That's my feeling on the whole thing, everybody.

[31:28] Have a great week.

[31:30] Hopefully we'll get the new Stern.

[31:31] I came in on a Sunday because I wanted to do a show this morning.

[31:35] And I also just want to get ready for when Stern breaks the damn wide open,

[31:40] destroys the sales of Toy Story CEs,

[31:43] and now we're all just talking about the next Stern machine.

[31:46] I can't wait.

[31:47] It's coming, people.

[31:48] Have a good day.
