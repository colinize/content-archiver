[00:00] Let's do this Saturday morning. Let's get everybody in the house. Let's get the party started.

[00:04] Gonna go to the gym after this. We're gonna talk a little bit about what I've been talking about

[00:08] this year, which is I want everybody to invest in themselves as much as they invest in pinball.

[00:16] We're gonna talk about that. No judgment, but just talk about what I'd like to see everybody do this

[00:22] year as we wait for pinball machines to come out. Let's get the Magic Girl playfield in the house.

[00:29] What's up everybody? Happy Memorial Day weekend. I'm sure we'll have a little bit of a lesser than

[00:35] audience today as people just enjoy the long weekend, the beautiful weather here in New York City.

[00:41] I mean, I look at cars with the 10 stars. Zombie Eddie is the only reason why Magic Girl is nice.

[00:50] Well, Matt Andrews did beautiful cabinet artwork too.

[00:56] Good morning, haunts. Good morning, people.

[01:02] We're losing some club members, people. We're at 6.06. We went from 6.20 to 6.06.

[01:10] Well, I knew we were gonna get like 10 people, but like if you're watching this right now,

[01:15] and I mean it when I say it, the days are gonna come to an end of me doing this hour and a half

[01:23] every week while some of you can't join the club. Why is it? Why can't you join the

[01:31] Canadian club? Listen to the podcast and then just show your support, okay? It would be great.

[01:38] $5. I went to buy two iced coffees yesterday. $9.87 for two iced coffees in the freaking suburbs.

[01:52] I'm not charging enough for the work. I mean, you guys know this, but I'm not gonna raise the

[01:56] prices. It is what it is. I'm not gonna go to $10 a month. I'm not gonna do freaking 25 tiers like

[02:03] $5. You get the best pinball podcast on the planet. I've got some really,

[02:10] I've got an interesting bit of news. I've got an interesting bit of news that I'm going to

[02:16] share on the show next week, and it's gonna be good. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be news that you

[02:22] wish went the other way in the sense of somebody was trying to go back and work with a pinball

[02:29] company and they couldn't work it out. Thank you, Joseph. Appreciate it. We're gonna talk all about

[02:38] what's going on in pinball this week. We're gonna talk about the state of the pinball hobby. We're

[02:44] gonna talk about what each company has going on, what we think is gonna happen over the next few

[02:52] weeks, and these teaser games, these new companies that are threatening to throw their hat into the

[02:58] ring. We're gonna talk about those companies. What I think the likelihood is we're gonna see

[03:03] something that actually either lives up to or exceeds our expectations. I was talking a little

[03:10] bit to George Gomez yesterday. We're gonna talk a little bit about Jack Danger is no longer gonna

[03:16] be doing dead flip streams every week. Now would be Joe Kamikaw has blocked me from Facebook.

[03:30] He got all triggered by me about, I want to say, three years ago. And I don't know why it was a

[03:38] really weird thing he did. Like we were having a conversation. I think he shared with me

[03:45] some of franchise James Bond artwork that he did for Joe's like Aston Martin. I don't even,

[03:54] I didn't say anything to piss him off, but all of a sudden he comes back at me and says,

[03:58] I don't have time for this high school drama and then just blocks me. So I don't know what to tell

[04:05] you Joe Kamikaw is not going to be coming on the Canadian Pinball podcast anytime soon.

[04:11] And I think, you know, this, this admission that Jersey Jack has the license for Harry Potter,

[04:18] the fact that he distributed that information. I mean, look, I wouldn't have done it.

[04:27] If I were him, I think he's, you know, I think he's got, I think maybe he's a little bit bitter

[04:34] that they didn't get it. I don't even like, I have to say this people, I think there's too much

[04:39] material to get Harry Potter right. I don't think Jersey Jack is going to get it right.

[04:46] I think there's too many books, there's too many movies, there's too, like they're just going to

[04:50] end up making it like you choose one of the four houses and then you learn these spells. I don't

[04:56] think it's going to, I think Harry Potter, I'm just going to say it right now. I just think it's

[05:00] going to disappoint any diehard Harry Potter fan. I think it's going to diss, I don't think you can

[05:06] make it as one machine. There's too much source material. They need to break it up.

[05:13] Now, I self-admittedly, like I did not read the books. I've seen all the movies and I just,

[05:21] I understand why people love Harry Potter. So I'm not going to say anything negative about

[05:25] people's love affair with the property. I also don't think it is what I would choose for pinball

[05:33] knowing, again, how are we going to do it justice, how are we going to have Quidditch,

[05:38] how are we going to have spells, how are we going to have magic, how are we going to have

[05:41] magic wands doing interesting things, how are we going to have Voldemort, how are you going

[05:45] to have all this stuff, how are you going to do it, how are you going to have the, you know,

[05:49] the flying car, how are you, you got to make it magical, the train station, you got to make

[05:55] it magical, getting the Hogwarts, like the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

[05:58] the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

[05:59] that all the kids and students sit in.

[06:01] Like, I don't know how you do it, Justice.

[06:05] It definitely begs for a world in our glass.

[06:07] My, again, my worry about all these new games now

[06:11] is that I just don't see these companies

[06:13] making worlds anymore.

[06:16] I see them making artwork and code.

[06:20] And so that's my concern about any property

[06:24] where there's such an identifiable world

[06:26] you want to see come to life in a three-dimensional way

[06:30] underneath the play field or sorry, the glass.

[06:34] I think you want to see that.

[06:40] So, and it's also, let's be honest,

[06:42] if they got the license for Harry Potter,

[06:45] they just got it.

[06:46] They just got it, right?

[06:48] And so Jersey Jack is probably just getting to work

[06:53] on the design of this game.

[06:56] Obviously, I think Eric Minier would be the one everyone

[07:01] would want to touch this machine.

[07:03] We haven't seen what Steve Ritchie can do at Jersey Jack.

[07:06] I think everyone is watching closely

[07:08] to see what Steve Ritchie's game is.

[07:10] I really hope Jersey Jack gets its mojo back.

[07:13] I really do.

[07:15] I really do hope that that is the case.

[07:19] And we shall see.

[07:21] It's gonna be a really interesting

[07:24] next half of 2023 for Jersey Jack.

[07:28] We are almost at the end of May

[07:30] and not a single Godfather Collector's Edition

[07:33] has made its way to customers.

[07:36] So hopefully we see those sometime in early June.

[07:38] I'm not worried people are gonna get them.

[07:40] I'm not worried whatsoever in there.

[07:42] They're gonna make these games.

[07:43] It's gonna be fun to see people unbox

[07:47] Godfather Collector's Editions.

[07:50] I haven't seen anybody,

[07:53] I haven't seen anybody unbox

[07:56] a Galactic Tank Force Limited Edition.

[08:00] And also if you've been following

[08:02] the Galactic Tank Force thread, ladies and gentlemen,

[08:06] not good, not good.

[08:07] The number one advocate for this game

[08:10] is now disappointed with the way the game was engineered.

[08:13] Did you see Flinnie Bus?

[08:16] He pulled out the, that center bank of all those targets

[08:21] and it's just so poorly engineered.

[08:24] And it's really starting to feel like this game

[08:27] went from prototype stage to production

[08:32] in a way that they didn't really

[08:36] take into consideration issues.

[08:39] They didn't play this game as a whitewood.

[08:41] They didn't, it's not, you know,

[08:42] it doesn't it feel like they didn't make five of them

[08:44] and just banged on them for four months

[08:46] to make sure this was the right way

[08:48] to engineer this or that.

[08:51] So I actually think, Pat Lawler is not doing Harry Potter.

[08:58] Pat Lawler is not doing Harry Potter, Daniel.

[09:01] Like don't even start a silly rumor.

[09:04] Pat Lawler is done designing.

[09:07] Okay.

[09:10] But I think Galactic Tank Force is in big trouble.

[09:18] And I know people think I have an agenda against the game.

[09:21] I just think this game was in thought through very,

[09:25] very thoroughly.

[09:27] And the fact that Flinnie Bus,

[09:29] the fact that Flinnie Bus who was advocating for this game

[09:33] is like, look, this game's not, it's not engineered right.

[09:37] And this isn't how I would have done it.

[09:40] And it looks like a mess.

[09:41] It looks like, so I don't know what they do now.

[09:45] I don't know what they do now.

[09:46] There's, they, I think what they need to do,

[09:49] they need to get the damn Tank Edition games

[09:52] to their customers.

[09:54] There are people who spent 11-five or 17-five.

[09:58] They have no idea when they're getting their game.

[10:01] So like, I think American Pinball,

[10:04] you know, if you listen to my podcast,

[10:06] I told you what happened.

[10:07] They tried to pull a fast one with their vendors

[10:10] and they got caught.

[10:12] And that is why I think you're seeing a real struggle

[10:16] to make this game quickly.

[10:21] They're another company where,

[10:23] they're another company where we don't know

[10:25] how many games a week they can make.

[10:28] We've seen some walkthroughs of American Pinball.

[10:30] I'll give them that.

[10:32] But doesn't it feel like this game

[10:35] just did not live up to the expectations people had?

[10:39] Doesn't it feel like American Pinball

[10:42] after making Houdini,

[10:46] Oktoberfest, Hot Wheels,

[10:49] Legends of Vahala,

[10:51] this is their fifth title.

[10:54] Doesn't it feel like,

[10:56] and you could throw Magic Girl

[10:57] because they built those, don't forget that people.

[11:02] Doesn't it feel like as their fifth title,

[11:06] American Pinball has still not really had a hit game?

[11:12] How do you make five pinball machines

[11:16] and you haven't made a game

[11:19] where you can sell at least 1500 of them?

[11:24] And you're like spending millions of dollars,

[11:28] all the hard work to manufacture pinball,

[11:32] they just lack creative vision

[11:35] and they still lack creative vision.

[11:40] I also think it is damning

[11:44] that Dennis Nordman is nowhere near the marketing of this game.

[11:49] Like where is Dennis Nordman?

[11:52] Where is he?

[11:53] He's not streaming his own product?

[11:58] I think Nordman just wanted to make a tank cabinet.

[12:02] I really do.

[12:03] I think he had this idea.

[12:06] I don't think the game came together

[12:09] the way he kind of wanted it to.

[12:12] I think the whole thing feels like a huge compromise

[12:15] to his initial vision.

[12:18] Okay, I haven't heard anything from them.

[12:22] They don't like Canada very much.

[12:24] I don't really care.

[12:26] I'm just curious, look,

[12:28] let me talk about this company on another level.

[12:32] I don't know how many they're gonna make

[12:34] and I wonder if Galactic Tank Force is gonna end up

[12:38] becoming some like niche cult classic game

[12:41] that actually holds value on the secondhand market.

[12:45] But then I don't think it's going to

[12:47] because Galactic Tank Force is half the game

[12:51] that dialed in is.

[12:52] Dialed in shoots much better,

[12:54] has twice as many toys, has much better code.

[12:58] Everything about dialed in is way better

[13:02] than Galactic Tank Force, right?

[13:03] The scopes are not 3D printed.

[13:06] Everything is way better than dialed in.

[13:10] You can go get a dialed in LE for 7,500 bucks.

[13:13] I think dialed in LE, if I were any of you out there,

[13:17] that is the game I would buy right now.

[13:20] I think dialed in LE has hit rock bottom with pricing.

[13:26] Like you can get one for 7,500 bucks in great condition.

[13:37] That is criminal with the amount of stuff

[13:40] that's in that game, with David Thiel music,

[13:45] I think arguably Jersey Jack's best usage

[13:48] of the 27 inch screen ever, dialed in to me.

[13:54] And I've always enjoyed playing it.

[13:56] There was just something about it

[13:57] that just didn't make me wanna own it.

[13:59] But now that it's so damn cheap,

[14:03] I think you're like, I would rather have it dialed in

[14:08] than just another generic $10,000 stern premium.

[14:13] And it's $2,500 less than a stern premium.

[14:18] I think dialed in like years from now

[14:21] is gonna have like a second coming.

[14:24] I do, I do.

[14:25] I just think it's one of those JJP games.

[14:28] When you stop and think about it,

[14:31] it's still Pat Lawler's best game

[14:33] that he made at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[14:37] And it's the one he took the longest to make.

[14:40] He didn't rush it like he did Willy Wonka

[14:42] in Toy Story.

[14:44] And I would go get a, you know, the pro,

[14:48] there's a CE new in box.

[14:49] Here's the issue.

[14:50] Here's what's interesting.

[14:53] 15,000 for the CE new in box is like,

[14:55] it's like impossible to buy that

[14:57] because the CE is not nice enough.

[15:00] And the thing is, this Chris from RCK

[15:05] wants to join the video.

[15:07] You gotta give me a reason why you wanna join.

[15:09] You can't just join.

[15:10] It's just, you gotta pitch Canada

[15:12] why we should go live to you.

[15:16] But man, the LD looks exactly the same.

[15:20] So you might as well get an LE for half the price.

[15:29] Canada keeps asking why AP is getting manufacturing wrong

[15:32] since they've done four previous titles.

[15:35] Issue is none of the people involved in those.

[15:39] Well, yeah, I mean, there's a reason why

[15:41] people have left American pinball.

[15:44] There's a reason why people left spooky pinball.

[15:48] You know, there's a reason why Bo and Karen's

[15:50] and Scott Denisi went over to multi-morphic.

[15:53] I mean, think of it, I mean,

[15:55] stuff had to get pretty bad at spooky

[15:57] for Denisi and Bo and to go to multi-morphic, right?

[16:02] I imagine like being like, I'm out of here.

[16:05] Well, where are you gonna go to like

[16:07] be part of pinball momentum?

[16:08] I'm gonna go to multi-morphic.

[16:10] What?

[16:11] Like, I don't know, man, that feels like a,

[16:15] that's not a lateral move.

[16:17] That's a downward move.

[16:21] Going from spooky to multi-morphic is,

[16:23] you are going to a worse company.

[16:27] Now you might have more creative control over there,

[16:30] but I mean, I don't even, I can't take company seriously

[16:35] that are hiding how many games a week they can make.

[16:38] I mean, that's my new thing.

[16:40] It's hard for me to take any of these companies seriously

[16:43] when you ask them, so how many games a week can you make?

[16:45] And they just, they won't, they refuse

[16:47] to answer your question.

[16:52] Stern will tell you, I bet Jersey Jack would tell us

[16:56] if we, you know, we asked them.

[16:59] American pinball won't tell us, Haggis won't tell us.

[17:06] I bet Padredy gaming would tell us.

[17:09] We're talking about Padredy, you know?

[17:12] I don't know why they put the,

[17:14] the queen machines on the floor.

[17:17] Have you seen this?

[17:19] I'm like, guys, just buy a table.

[17:21] Like it just looks better.

[17:22] Like, did you see the production shot of queen pinball?

[17:26] It's nice that they're making games,

[17:28] but I don't think a game should ever end up on the floor.

[17:31] Like nothing you're making should end up on the floor.

[17:35] Get a long table and line them up there.

[17:40] It just looks bad.

[17:44] I don't care who's making games.

[17:45] I don't think there's ever a point where Stern's playfields

[17:48] or Jersey Jack's playfields or Spooky's playfields

[17:52] populate it, end up on the floor of the factory.

[17:57] The floor is where your shoes and feet should go.

[18:00] Not, not, not your $10,000 assembled playfield.

[18:06] I don't know why I have to tell companies this.

[18:09] Everything you show is a reflection of your organization.

[18:18] Pick up the playfields that are populated Padredy.

[18:23] And buy a table.

[18:25] Buy a table, okay?

[18:30] I think it'll present better.

[18:39] But look, I mean, they're making games.

[18:43] Should we count how many pinball companies right now

[18:46] are making machines?

[18:47] Let's do this first.

[18:48] Gang, I need your help on this.

[18:50] In the mid-90s, when pinball was at its highest

[18:55] in terms of volume, right?

[18:56] Games were selling 10 to 20,000 units.

[19:01] In the mid-90s, we're gonna talk about

[19:03] that French company, don't worry, Albert.

[19:06] Is that Albert who asked?

[19:09] You're a cliff, Albert.

[19:12] No, clip, we'll talk about the French company.

[19:14] Let's, let's do this first.

[19:16] In the mid-90s, how many people were making pinball machines?

[19:21] You had what?

[19:23] Balli Williams, you had Capcom, right?

[19:28] A couple games.

[19:30] You had Data East Stern, right?

[19:34] Same company, Data East Stern.

[19:37] You had Gottlieb, right?

[19:41] Was still making some games.

[19:44] Four companies, am I missing anybody?

[19:48] Balli Williams, Gottlieb, Capcom, and Data East Stern.

[19:54] Okay, so that's four.

[19:58] I got Gottlieb in here, John.

[20:00] Anyone else?

[20:01] That's four companies.

[20:03] Sega, okay.

[20:05] And Sega was kind of part of Data East Stern, right?

[20:09] All right, so we got five companies.

[20:12] We're making pinball machines when pinball

[20:16] was the most popular it's ever been

[20:19] and when there were the most purchases

[20:21] of pinball machines ever.

[20:23] Five, okay?

[20:27] All right, cool.

[20:29] Let's count today.

[20:31] Stern, right?

[20:35] CGC, okay?

[20:39] Let's go on to, I mean, I'm gonna count them.

[20:41] Play Mechanics is a separate entity.

[20:45] Let's count Spooky Pinball, Multimorphic, okay?

[20:51] Pinball Adventures, Dutch Pinball, let's keep going.

[20:58] I, it's hard to remember all them.

[20:59] Jersey Jack Pinball, American Pinball.

[21:03] It's getting scary, right?

[21:04] Let's keep going.

[21:08] Did I say Multimorphic already?

[21:10] Let's talk about this new French company.

[21:14] All right, 10.

[21:16] Pinball Brothers, 11.

[21:19] Let's go on to, I think we're missing some.

[21:23] Home Pin, Haggis, all right?

[21:28] 13 we're at.

[21:29] We're still going, we're not done yet.

[21:33] There's somewhere missing, I know we're missing some.

[21:36] What am I missing here?

[21:37] Spooky, 14.

[21:46] I thought I got Spooky.

[21:52] 14 companies.

[21:55] We're not even gonna count Quetzal.

[21:58] Balorama, okay.

[22:01] You see why we have roughly 10 to 15 companies

[22:07] give or take their size and their, you know,

[22:15] their scale and fifth, so stupid, right?

[22:19] Stupid.

[22:21] And Stern has like 90% of the market.

[22:25] They really do.

[22:26] Stern has like 90% of the market.

[22:28] And here's my prediction gang.

[22:30] Stern is gonna put seven of those companies out of business

[22:34] in the next two years.

[22:36] Easily.

[22:37] Stern will put seven of those 14 companies out of business

[22:40] in the next two years.

[22:43] There's no weight space.

[22:46] There's no weight space.

[22:47] You can't compete, oh, turn or pinball, right?

[22:51] You can't compete with Stern's talent,

[22:55] with their efficiency, with their,

[22:58] they're gonna put half of these companies out of business.

[23:00] And the thing is this with Stern, you know,

[23:03] they've been raising prices, raising demand

[23:09] all throughout a period in which they didn't even have

[23:11] a triple A title.

[23:13] Do you know how scary that is?

[23:16] Do you know like George Gomez must be sitting back

[23:19] realizing he's got back to the future,

[23:21] he's got Jaws, he's got Indiana Jones.

[23:24] He's like, he knows what he has coming.

[23:27] He's got amazing Spider-Man, Venom.

[23:30] He knows what's in the hopper.

[23:33] He knows he's got probably Motley Crue.

[23:35] He's probably got Beastie Boys.

[23:37] He's probably got, you know, it's just like,

[23:39] it's not stopping.

[23:40] And here's the part that is so beneficial to Stern

[23:44] and they did it right.

[23:46] The Stern Insider Connected and the Stern Community,

[23:49] they really did, they really did make their brand

[23:52] out of all the pinball companies,

[23:54] the most close to a lifestyle brand.

[23:57] Because when I say lifestyle, I mean,

[24:00] the majority of people that buy pinball machines now

[24:04] that are looking for new pins,

[24:06] I don't think they have like this love affair

[24:08] with Ballity Williams.

[24:09] I think these people have really discovered their love

[24:13] of pinball through the Stern era of pinball

[24:16] and they now look at Stern as the benchmark

[24:20] for the best pinball.

[24:22] And as they wanna buy new games,

[24:24] they're looking primarily at what's next from Stern.

[24:29] Stern is setting the agenda and controlling 90%

[24:34] of the pinball market, both with their audiences.

[24:37] They think about it.

[24:38] Stern has won the collector community.

[24:42] They've won over the tournament

[24:43] and the league night community, right?

[24:46] The players, like the pinball players,

[24:49] what games do they wanna play?

[24:51] What games have their respect?

[24:53] Which games do they love?

[24:55] Like it's Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern, Stern.

[24:59] Everybody else is really, is like, is so hit or miss.

[25:04] I would argue that Jersey Jack

[25:06] should have always been targeting the high end collector.

[25:09] They failed at doing that.

[25:11] Now they're charging high end collectible prices,

[25:16] but they don't have the product to back up the pricing.

[25:20] You know, no collector is like, oh yeah,

[25:22] like Godfather CE and Toy Story CE,

[25:26] it's not what people want.

[25:28] It's not what a high end collector wants.

[25:31] They've failed and the games are empty

[25:34] compared to Wizard of Oz, compared to Dialed In,

[25:37] compared to Pyrr to the Caribbean.

[25:39] So they've lost a lot of that collector

[25:42] who thought they were gonna have

[25:43] that like high end alternative.

[25:45] And here's the saddest part, people.

[25:48] It's not only did Stern Pinball beat everybody

[25:50] at their own game and then some.

[25:52] They also now make a thousand LEs.

[25:57] If you add the topper,

[25:59] a Stern LE is now $14,000 to $15,000.

[26:02] They're laughing all the way to the bank.

[26:05] Stern didn't double the bomb on its games.

[26:09] They simply, slowly, then gradually, then quickly

[26:13] have now doubled the price of almost all of their product

[26:17] and they have twice the demand for all of it.

[26:21] Foo Fighters LE was the fastest selling LE

[26:24] in Stern history.

[26:26] Foo Fighters LE sold out in record time, right?

[26:29] Okay, a thousand of them sold out like that.

[26:33] Foo Fighters, a theme that arguably,

[26:36] what do you think's gonna happen

[26:37] when it's back to the future?

[26:39] What do you think's gonna happen when it's Jaws?

[26:42] What do you think's gonna happen when it's Indiana Jones?

[26:45] It is gonna be crazy.

[26:49] And the part that I left out of my collector's corner

[26:53] was that there are a lot of collectors

[26:56] that simply buy every single new LE that comes out

[27:00] when it comes out, not even if they don't like Foo Fighters

[27:03] or they don't like Rush, they simply buy it

[27:07] so that they remain at the top of the list

[27:10] with their distributor.

[27:12] Because think about it, there is almost zero risk

[27:17] of buying every single Stern LE new inbox.

[27:20] There's zero risk you're going to lose money.

[27:24] I don't even think you lost money on Led Zeppelin,

[27:26] I think you broke even.

[27:27] But cool, so let's say you break even on Led Zeppelin

[27:30] for 10, five, whatever it was, 11,000.

[27:33] You bought Godzilla, you just made yourself 6,000 to 7,000.

[27:37] You bought Rush, you broke even.

[27:39] You brought Foo Fighters, you maybe made 1,000 or two.

[27:42] But no one's losing money.

[27:44] Nobody who buys a Stern LE is losing $2,000 to $3,000

[27:48] in like six months.

[27:50] But if you bought Toy Story CE,

[27:52] you lost $3,000 in six months.

[27:56] Same is gonna happen with Godfather.

[27:59] You know, there's a lot more risk.

[28:00] If you bought Scooby-Doo, you already lost $2,000 to $3,000.

[28:04] You're Scooby-Doo, if you are at the end of the Scooby-Doo

[28:07] line, you are now kicking yourself

[28:10] because you could have got a Scooby-Doo immediately

[28:14] and saved yourself $2,000 to $3,000.

[28:17] Guns and Roses also, yes, has lost people money.

[28:20] I'm telling you, if I was just gonna tell someone,

[28:24] what would I buy?

[28:25] How do you tell someone to buy anything other?

[28:30] I mean this, as a new and box game,

[28:32] how do you buy anything other than a Stern LE?

[28:38] I mean, and that's where it gets,

[28:40] that's why the demand for a Stern LE,

[28:42] even though there's 1,000, it's just gonna keep growing

[28:46] because you're gonna have thousands of people

[28:50] around the world that are gonna wanna get their hands

[28:53] on one of a thousand.

[29:00] Double up on the due to describe the Scooby-Doo.

[29:02] Billy B's in the house.

[29:03] Billy, you're here, but you didn't kick any stars.

[29:09] All right, gang, I wanna encourage everybody

[29:11] to do something.

[29:12] I'm gonna take a little bit of a,

[29:14] a little bit of a tangent real quick.

[29:16] And this is one of my new messages,

[29:19] and I mean it when I say it.

[29:22] The last, after losing my friend and losing a lot this year,

[29:28] I basically have been probably self-medicating myself,

[29:35] not probably, I know I have,

[29:36] like self-medicating too much.

[29:38] And by self-medication, too many happy hours

[29:42] that weren't happy.

[29:43] Just going out, like finding an excuse to drink,

[29:45] eating food that wasn't really healthy.

[29:48] I stopped really taking care of myself

[29:50] the way I normally try to.

[29:52] And I'll tell you what I did, like I hit rock bottom,

[29:54] it was bad, like really bad on Cinco de Mayo,

[29:57] just drinking, isolated drinking.

[30:00] And I said to myself, this isn't you,

[30:02] this isn't what you should be doing,

[30:04] like it made everything unenjoyable,

[30:05] made doing my podcast unenjoyable,

[30:07] made playing pinball unenjoyable.

[30:09] And so the last like three weeks,

[30:13] just drinking a lot less, eating healthier,

[30:15] and exercising a lot more.

[30:17] And the only thing I encourage each and every one of you,

[30:19] and I know that everybody's life is different.

[30:22] I know each of your backgrounds, and where you're from,

[30:24] and sort of like your schedule, your financial situation,

[30:30] every one of us has a different situation.

[30:32] But I just want to encourage each and every one of you

[30:34] to do me one thing this year, just one thing.

[30:38] Invest as much money in your health this year

[30:42] as you do on one single pinball machine.

[30:46] That's it.

[30:48] That's it.

[30:50] Nothing more.

[30:51] So if you buy a Stern Pro for $6,000,

[30:56] spend $6,000 investing on taking care of yourself,

[31:00] whether that's a gym membership that you use,

[31:02] whether you spend a little bit more, but eat healthier.

[31:06] Because I really do believe this.

[31:08] I do think that, and I talk to so many of you personally,

[31:12] and I just see people, just, and I have friends

[31:15] who are just, they buy every single new game,

[31:17] and their life hasn't changed at all in years.

[31:20] And for some of you out there, you know,

[31:23] in their 40s and 50s, some of my friends,

[31:26] way, they're struggling way too hard, physically.

[31:30] I see them at shows, I see them in person.

[31:32] They're just, they're beat down, and I'm like,

[31:36] no, like, we all can get a little bit better at this,

[31:40] all right, and that's just what I encourage

[31:42] each and every one of you to do, and that's it.

[31:44] I'll get off the soapbox now.

[31:46] It's made a big difference in my life over the last month,

[31:49] and I always plan to invest more in my health

[31:52] than I will in pinball machines.

[31:55] So I just encourage each and every one of you

[31:57] to think about that, and I always hear this from everybody,

[32:00] that I don't have time, I don't have time to go to the gym,

[32:02] I don't have time to exercise.

[32:04] That's total BS.

[32:06] It only takes a half hour, three days a week,

[32:08] and your life will change dramatically.

[32:11] And, you know, all the time you're spending playing

[32:13] pinball, think about it.

[32:15] Again, just invest in yourself.

[32:16] All right, so let's go on to what we think is gonna happen

[32:21] at these companies right now.

[32:23] Let me get a go.

[32:24] By the way, I don't know if any of you,

[32:28] I don't know if any of you suffer from allergies,

[32:31] but I think I finally are suffering from allergies

[32:36] because the pollen this like spring, summer is terrible.

[32:42] And now the last few days, I don't know what it is.

[32:47] I just bought some flonies.

[32:49] I just have this like nasal drip happening at night,

[32:53] and it's just torture, torture.

[32:57] Like I can't sleep the moment I'm lying down,

[32:59] I'm just congested, and it's just,

[33:04] it's the worst feeling ever.

[33:08] Natural honey, all right.

[33:13] Oh God.

[33:16] Oh, I gotta take the demon out this weekend.

[33:18] The demon is the ultimate Memorial Day ride.

[33:21] It's like, it's just this little tingle you get right here.

[33:30] It's right here.

[33:32] It's right here, there's a little tingle,

[33:33] and it doesn't go away,

[33:34] and you just wanna clear your throat or blow your nose,

[33:37] and it's just terrible.

[33:39] We're gonna go to the gym later.

[33:41] Today's gonna be pull-ups,

[33:44] it's gonna be back and legs today.

[33:45] So I'm gonna do a bunch of pull-ups,

[33:48] and I'm gonna do back exercises and leg exercises,

[33:52] and I'm gonna do it for 40 minutes,

[33:54] maybe throw in some crunches in the middle,

[33:59] and I will feel great.

[34:01] 46 years old.

[34:03] I mean, I feel good for 46.

[34:08] When I tell people I'm 46,

[34:09] I mean, maybe it's because of the way I act,

[34:11] maybe because it's my stupid haircut,

[34:13] maybe it's because I don't wear clothes

[34:14] that are age-appropriate, but whatever it is,

[34:16] whatever it is.

[34:18] I'm happy at 46 to be doing this show every Saturday,

[34:22] to be doing the podcast,

[34:24] to be trying to find that balance in life.

[34:27] It's not easy, trust me, trust me.

[34:30] I mean, speaking of balance in life,

[34:31] let's talk about Jack Danger no longer streaming

[34:35] dead flip pinball.

[34:37] I mean, this is like the world's number one pinball streamer,

[34:41] is now going to focus more on family

[34:44] and focus more on his job.

[34:48] I know this is really hard for Jack.

[34:50] I mean, I congratulated him on it,

[34:52] but as someone who does this every week,

[34:55] someone who does the podcast,

[34:57] someone who has a wife, a child,

[34:59] and Jack has two beautiful girls, a beautiful wife,

[35:06] I'm not gonna make any suppositions other than,

[35:11] I know that it's gotta somewhat be killing him

[35:15] to be hanging up the stream.

[35:18] The problem is, and I face this more than,

[35:23] more than I admit to you,

[35:25] as a dad with young children,

[35:29] it is a really difficult balance

[35:33] between children that need nurturing

[35:37] and then the role of dad and helping out your wife.

[35:42] I mean, that is it.

[35:44] And I openly admit that I don't do enough

[35:48] of what I should be doing for Brenda.

[35:51] I don't.

[35:52] I'm not present as much as I should be.

[35:55] And I make stupid excuses why I'm sometimes too,

[36:00] and I don't look, we're both tired,

[36:02] but nobody's more tired than Brenda.

[36:04] Nobody does more work than Brenda.

[36:06] I mean, most mornings waking up with Killian,

[36:09] getting his lunch ready, getting him to daycare,

[36:11] picking him up from daycare almost every night,

[36:14] like giving him dinner.

[36:15] Like it is basically a job in itself.

[36:22] And so of course I'm tired too.

[36:25] I don't sleep as well as I'd like to.

[36:28] Killian is in our bedroom with us.

[36:30] I mean, the crib is right freaking here, if you can see it.

[36:33] So, you know, I pull this card all the time.

[36:37] Like, oh, well, dad's role doesn't really begin

[36:39] to like three or four years of age.

[36:41] And look, I change diapers, I do stuff,

[36:43] but not as much as I should.

[36:46] And I think, you know, I can't imagine coming home from work

[36:51] or not coming home because I'm streaming pinball.

[36:54] I know, I feel like, you know,

[37:01] he probably didn't want to give it up,

[37:04] but you got to give up some things.

[37:06] And you got to be a, if you want,

[37:09] if you want to save your marriage

[37:11] and you want to have a healthy family,

[37:14] you've got to have the balance.

[37:16] I think I just heard Brett and Yolanda killian.

[37:20] It's like, this is all like ideal time for this.

[37:22] As I talk to you about how I should do more

[37:25] as a husband and father, they're out there,

[37:29] she's struggling out there with Killian.

[37:32] It's hard, it just nothing, nothing really prepares you

[37:37] for the amount of time and effort it takes.

[37:39] And for those of you out there without children,

[37:44] all I can say to you is enjoy your time.

[37:47] You can do whatever you want whenever you want

[37:49] for the most part.

[37:51] It also does take a village to raise a family.

[37:54] And that's the other thing that we find difficult

[37:56] is we don't really have family and friends nearby

[37:59] to help out.

[38:01] So for example, this Memorial Day weekend,

[38:03] while most people out there who are young

[38:06] without kids are looking forward to a long weekend,

[38:09] parents, now it's like the third day,

[38:14] like now you got three full days with no support.

[38:18] It's like you almost don't look forward

[38:21] to having these days off from work.

[38:24] Finally gonna get a much needed vacation

[38:28] at the end of June Gang.

[38:30] So just mark your calendars.

[38:32] There will be, actually, you probably won't miss much

[38:37] because we're gonna go to the Bahamas

[38:40] the last week in June from Monday through Friday.

[38:44] So I probably will still do the Saturday morning

[38:47] spectacular when I get back.

[38:49] Brenda's sisters are gonna fly in from Ireland

[38:51] and watch Killian.

[38:52] So Brenda and I can finally after two and a half years

[38:56] just take a vacation amongst ourselves,

[38:59] which we need badly.

[39:04] Look gang, 10 stars here, 10.

[39:08] We've got Billy B owns the nicest hotel in Vancouver,

[39:13] makes more in one bar tab than I do all month podcasting.

[39:20] Nothing, nothing yet.

[39:22] Normally we get, I think it's Jason,

[39:26] we get Mr. Scott, we get Scott Rosen.

[39:34] Where the big dog is that?

[39:35] Hector, Hector just joined.

[39:46] What do you guys wanna talk about?

[39:48] I think Cliff Albert want to talk about the French company.

[39:52] Wee wee pinball.

[39:53] I don't really, I'm just gonna say this,

[39:57] from what I've seen of this French pinball game,

[40:02] I don't understand it.

[40:03] I don't understand who would buy this.

[40:07] I think marketing is weird when you'd make a game like that.

[40:13] You did no market research.

[40:14] You're just making something you wanna make

[40:17] and that's cool.

[40:18] It's not my money, it's their money,

[40:20] but I don't think they're gonna sell many of that game.

[40:24] I think people are more,

[40:25] even though there's more companies,

[40:27] people are becoming more selective than ever before

[40:30] on what they purchase

[40:31] because there's just too much to risk now.

[40:34] If you really wanna have something different,

[40:37] knock yourself out, go buy a Galactic Tank Force,

[40:39] buy this French game,

[40:40] but I don't think most people just want a different pin.

[40:43] I think everyone still wants a great pin

[40:46] and we have not seen any of these startup boutiques

[40:50] make a great pin.

[40:52] Not since arguably the Dutch pinball's Lebowski,

[40:56] that was a decade ago,

[40:58] but nobody else that's thrown their head

[41:00] into the boutique space has made a great pin.

[41:02] They don't have the software is the problem.

[41:12] Look, I think people who are self-aware

[41:15] and don't wanna have kids, I mean, that's totally cool.

[41:19] Don's pinball podcast is in the house.

[41:22] Don has been wasting his time with merchandise nobody wants.

[41:25] Don, what are you doing?

[41:26] Don, why are you selling $25 T-shirts

[41:29] to get back like $3.75?

[41:34] Just give it up, Don.

[41:35] No one's gonna be buying your merch.

[41:37] No one's gonna buy your merch.

[41:38] It's okay, Don, I get it.

[41:40] I get it, you're doing everything everyone does.

[41:43] Just keep doing what you're doing.

[41:45] Just do the short, free show that fills the void.

[41:49] It's for me.

[41:50] Well, yeah, it is for you because trust me,

[41:52] like you're gonna be losing money on this stuff.

[42:00] Don's fun because he captures,

[42:03] he's got that sort of neo-fight enthusiasm for pinball.

[42:07] Like he almost considers buying everything.

[42:09] It's like, Don, I think you're gonna learn like real soon.

[42:13] Like that's not the, you gotta like,

[42:17] every time you play a game,

[42:18] you don't have to feel like you need to buy it.

[42:21] Especially because you've got stuff on location near you.

[42:27] I ain't got crap near me now

[42:29] because John and Jack Bar won't buy any of the new games.

[42:31] I'm still like, it's just like, all right,

[42:33] like I don't wanna make the trip for only Foo Fighters.

[42:37] Nothing else new.

[42:38] No Godfather.

[42:39] There's not a single Godfather in New York City.

[42:43] All right, talk about the Godzilla topper.

[42:46] All right, it's coming out Tuesday.

[42:49] It's $1,000.

[42:52] And I bet you it's gonna be a bunch of flat plastic

[42:56] for $1,000.

[43:02] Well, I don't, I haven't seen it.

[43:04] I don't, I don't really, like, I think,

[43:07] I think, look at the stars.

[43:09] Here we go.

[43:13] Just book Chicago Pinball Expert Bill.

[43:16] We haven't talked about this yet, but Bill, trust me.

[43:21] If you booked Chicago Pinball,

[43:23] only book Friday and Saturday.

[43:27] Fly out Sunday morning.

[43:30] Do not book Thursday.

[43:32] Do not book Wednesday.

[43:35] Do not, do not stay more than two days.

[43:40] It is too long being there.

[43:43] The show is too small.

[43:45] You'll see it all in an hour

[43:47] and you will regret going in early.

[43:51] Trust me.

[43:55] Everybody makes this mistake.

[43:58] They go to these shows way too early,

[44:03] hang out with their pinball buddies

[44:05] and they're freaking exhausted

[44:06] by the time Saturday rolls around.

[44:15] Don, they're gonna use your t-shirts

[44:17] to clean the, the laboads.

[44:23] Good.

[44:28] You know, I was banned from Expo last year.

[44:32] I was banned last year.

[44:34] I don't think I'll be banned this year.

[44:37] So I might as well go grab a room.

[44:42] I'll tell you this gang, like,

[44:45] Pinball Expo, like, two years ago was a lot of fun

[44:49] because it was like the first show back after COVID.

[44:54] I'm, I'm really on the fence about investing

[44:59] and going to shows, like, as often as I used to.

[45:03] And I mean it, like, I don't know,

[45:06] like, it's fun to walk around and see everybody,

[45:09] but you kind of see the whole show in a few hours.

[45:16] And then you like can't, I, I, let me, let me be candid.

[45:23] I think pinball shows suck at getting a feel for games.

[45:28] And I think we need to find balance here.

[45:30] I think we need, I think pinball shows,

[45:33] they need to rethink some of this

[45:36] because I think the companies need to rethink it a little bit.

[45:40] I think the experience at the shows themselves

[45:44] is when it comes to playing pinball is so bad.

[45:51] Think about it like this,

[45:52] cargument coming or movie.

[45:54] Imagine screening a movie

[45:58] in which you're, you have 20 movies

[46:01] screening right next to each other,

[46:04] blasting their movie volume.

[46:07] Imagine a car show in which every car is turned on

[46:11] at the same time revving its engine

[46:13] in the conference center.

[46:16] None of these, these shows are relics.

[46:20] They're set up the way they were in the 80s and 90s

[46:23] as a way to sell product to operators.

[46:28] You now have a collector or a home buyer

[46:32] and you're presenting your product to them

[46:35] in the shittiest way possible.

[46:37] I'm gonna curse right now.

[46:39] It is the shittiest way possible

[46:41] to showcase people of the game.

[46:45] Why does nobody even,

[46:46] if I was a pinball manufacturer,

[46:50] I would not wanna be on the main show floor.

[46:53] I would have a separate area and I would allow people,

[46:57] I would allow people to book an appointment

[47:02] throughout the tournament or throughout the show

[47:06] to come see the product,

[47:09] learn about it from the coder and the designer,

[47:12] have a glass of whiskey or a beer.

[47:16] Would you like to order one?

[47:18] Like actually make it a real sales experience.

[47:22] Create your own little showroom

[47:25] somewhere in the hotel and show the game properly.

[47:32] You would sell more product that way.

[47:36] It's really terrible.

[47:40] And I don't understand why this hobby

[47:45] continues to be Bush League

[47:48] when it comes to marketing its own.

[47:50] Like it doesn't, it seems silly.

[47:52] Like Jersey Jack comes with this big,

[47:55] you know, scaffolding and who cares?

[47:57] The experience sucks.

[47:59] Stern puts all these games at Marko's booth,

[48:02] experience sucks.

[48:05] It sucks.

[48:05] I would rather play Foo Fighters Ellie in the bathroom

[48:11] than on a loud show floor.

[48:16] It's a stupid, stupid way to try to get into a game.

[48:22] It doesn't work.

[48:23] I don't understand.

[48:24] Like why, this is not, this is, again,

[48:26] this is a relic, these shows are set up like relics.

[48:30] This is how it, this is like a trade show,

[48:34] but your clientele is now your consumer, not an operator.

[48:44] So it's exhausting.

[48:46] Can I be candid?

[48:47] It's not fun.

[48:49] When I was at TPF, I've spent as little time as possible

[48:52] on the show floor because it's exhausting.

[48:56] It's overwhelming.

[48:58] I feel bad for my vendor friends.

[49:02] It's not fun.

[49:04] I just have fun hanging out at Perry's Steakhouse

[49:08] talking pinball, but if that's the case game,

[49:12] I'd rather you guys fly to New York City,

[49:14] let's spend three days here talking pinball

[49:17] at better restaurants, at better bars,

[49:20] have more to do, and then we could go to Jack Bar

[49:24] and play pinball and we could rent the place out from John.

[49:29] You don't even have to rent the freaking place out.

[49:31] We roll in, if you're rolling the Jack Bar at one PM,

[49:36] you got the place to yourself.

[49:39] Instead, you're gonna spend a few thousand dollars,

[49:43] a thousand dollars, $2,000 and have like nothing

[49:45] but a headache coming out of, like it's just,

[49:47] it makes no sense to me.

[49:52] I just don't understand how you,

[49:54] and then you got the seminars, which are the worst.

[49:57] It's like you got these old curmudgeoning dudes

[50:00] who don't even understand how to work PowerPoint,

[50:03] and it's just so sad.

[50:05] Like it's so sad how people launch their games

[50:09] at pinball shows.

[50:15] You know, I wish you guys could go to a real,

[50:17] have you ever been to like a real event?

[50:19] Like, can I ask you guys a question?

[50:21] Like, there's millions of dollars being made

[50:24] by these pinball companies.

[50:25] Have you ever like legitimately gone

[50:28] to a real product launch, a real event,

[50:33] a real seminar, a real walkthrough panel discussion

[50:42] about a product?

[50:45] Would you go to a pinball one?

[50:49] Legit, like middle school kids could put on

[50:51] a better presentation than half of these companies

[50:53] do at these shows.

[50:55] It's embarrassing.

[50:57] It's embarrassing, especially considering

[50:59] how much these games are, because this is no longer like,

[51:02] this is not cheap and cheerful.

[51:03] A watch company will put on a much better exposition

[51:07] than Stern Pinball would, or Jersey Jack,

[51:10] or American Pinball.

[51:13] And gang, trust me, you don't have to spend

[51:18] a lot of money to have a nicely polished professional

[51:23] showcase of your product.

[51:28] There's that misconception, oh well, they don't have, no.

[51:33] No, you just simply need to grow up industry

[51:39] and stop acting like Bush League 1993 marketing

[51:43] is all we know, and dressing like it's 1996.

[51:48] Like, have you seen the dress?

[51:51] And look, I don't know.

[51:54] Again, not my company, not my brands,

[51:57] not my way I would do it.

[52:01] I mean, obviously Stern does everything the best.

[52:02] They don't even need to do a lot because of their demand,

[52:06] but everybody else does.

[52:09] Everybody else needs to up their game,

[52:12] up their ante, up their marketing.

[52:14] Everybody else needs to, and you know,

[52:18] Stern has earned the ability to sort of,

[52:22] they've earned the right to sort of bypass a lot

[52:25] of that marketing requirement because they don't need to

[52:28] because they just make the best damn pinball machines

[52:30] consistently for the last like 20 years.

[52:33] I mean, even Stern Pinball is making the best pinball

[52:36] machines over the last 20 years easily,

[52:40] and so they can coast now and just make

[52:42] their 60, 80 million a year.

[52:45] Nobody else is doing that.

[52:48] Don't lump all shows into your impression

[52:55] of just two shows.

[52:56] Gabe, okay, so Gabe, you're telling me, Gabe,

[53:00] that up in Boston, it's not the same thing.

[53:06] It's not all games are on at once,

[53:08] and it's a drowning headache as you're trying to get

[53:12] an impression of a machine.

[53:13] You're telling me that up there in New England,

[53:16] you guys do it differently?

[53:18] Like it's actually not a headache to try to get immersed

[53:21] on a new machine, or is it all just on one floor?

[53:25] You know, when we did the walk around of the Golden State

[53:28] pinball show like last weekend and that big hanger,

[53:32] I was just like, I wouldn't want to walk into that hanger

[53:36] with all those games on at once.

[53:37] I just wouldn't want to do it.

[53:39] I think this hobby needs to change a little bit.

[53:45] You need soundproof rooms or soundproof areas.

[53:51] They need to do more.

[53:54] Like why do I want to walk up to like,

[53:59] like Marco's setup with like four of the games

[54:03] that I've been playing with,

[54:04] and I've been playing with like four of the games

[54:07] all touching each other, like I'm not having a good time.

[54:11] Like the only thing you get from a pinball show is layout.

[54:15] You get none of the sound,

[54:17] you get none of the lights properly,

[54:18] you get none of the call outs,

[54:20] you get none of the codes and the mode coming through.

[54:24] None of it.

[54:25] None of it is presented properly.

[54:29] And I love that like, being negative is being negative

[54:31] is being negative is being negative is being negative

[54:34] is not supporting funeral.

[54:36] Like, no, maybe your pinball show

[54:37] should think about this a little bit.

[54:39] Like why has it got to be like this?

[54:43] You know, like why would you want to have Jersey Jack pinball

[54:47] just worked all this effort to make the Godfather?

[54:51] Okay, let's talk about Jersey Jack for a minute.

[54:53] Okay, so I'm going to put like 15 Godfather pinball machines

[54:59] all next to each other on at the same time.

[55:02] Okay, that makes sense.

[55:03] Then flanking them are just a bunch of random dudes machines

[55:09] all turned on with their speakers pointed at my booth

[55:15] where I'm trying to sell people on our brand new game

[55:18] that we just spent millions R&Ding.

[55:21] So we're in the worst possible place

[55:27] in a basically nothing but noise and lights

[55:33] hitting my potential customers.

[55:35] And this is the best way to showcase the Godfather.

[55:42] And I can see it.

[55:43] I can see Ken standing there.

[55:44] Like it's just, it's not a good environment to show pinball.

[55:52] But they're not even handing people headphones.

[55:55] They don't have headphones,

[55:57] but they're not giving people headphones.

[55:59] You think Jersey Jack would have nicely branded headphones

[56:04] and have a few games reserved for their clientele.

[56:11] No, they don't even have them there.

[56:13] They don't even have headphones.

[56:25] Earmuffs for galactic tank.

[56:27] You guys are bad on the stars.

[56:29] I mean, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna indict you guys.

[56:31] 540 stars.

[56:32] I can't eat.

[56:33] I can't eat.

[56:34] I can't pay for this magic girl play field.

[56:37] Let's go get it.

[56:43] Yeah.

[56:45] Eventually I'll hang this up.

[56:48] Oh, look, Kanata's, he doesn't play pinball.

[56:51] He just holds up pinball play fields.

[56:53] Magic girl.

[56:55] Oh, wow.

[56:56] If you wanna watch, if you wanna buy the working version

[57:01] or half working version,

[57:02] all you need is 45 or $65,000

[57:06] and CoinTaker will sell you one.

[57:08] $65,000.

[57:11] Get the F out of here, Chris.

[57:13] I love Chris and Melissa, but come on.

[57:20] $65,000.

[57:22] 45,000.

[57:23] Oh.

[57:25] Let's just throw it on the bed.

[57:28] It's like, get out of here, poppy-doo.

[57:34] Mm.

[57:40] Oh, you guys with your stars, 10 stars.

[57:42] What am I doing?

[57:46] You know, one day, imagine if Kanata went away

[57:51] and we just donned pinball podcast weekly.

[57:56] I love Don.

[57:57] He's like, I played Galactic Tank Force five more times.

[58:01] I'm ready for a review.

[58:05] Don, I'm gonna give you,

[58:06] I listen to Don, stop doing,

[58:07] I know you're stuck, you're stuck.

[58:10] I know there's no news, you're trying to find news.

[58:12] I get it, I get it.

[58:14] What you need to do, what you need to do

[58:18] is you need to now pull back the layers

[58:19] of this hobby a little bit more

[58:21] and also realize nobody cares about your collection.

[58:25] Okay, rule number one,

[58:27] when you're podcasting, talk about the industry,

[58:29] talk about the companies,

[58:30] no, nobody cares about what you're putting in your game room.

[58:32] Nobody cares.

[58:33] Nobody cares.

[58:34] I don't even have, Don, I'm the number one podcaster,

[58:38] number two or three streamer in the world.

[58:40] I don't even have a pinball collection.

[58:43] Nobody cares.

[58:44] Nobody cares that you put a Star Wars topper on.

[58:46] Nobody cares.

[58:48] Trust me.

[58:52] Canada paved the way, man.

[58:54] Canada proved that you don't even need to play pinball.

[58:58] Yeah.

[59:07] 96 hours of straight pinball.

[59:11] I don't get it.

[59:13] Don, Don, I hope you have it, Don,

[59:15] I hope you're buying some,

[59:16] I hope you have like a good S&P 500 fund.

[59:20] I hope, I hope, I meet a brother.

[59:22] I see you keep saying you're buying games.

[59:24] I hope, Don, what do you do for a living?

[59:26] Can we ask you, Don, what's your career?

[59:30] I mean, I'm assuming like you're doing

[59:32] pretty damn good over there.

[59:33] I mean, there's a lot of decent amount of games there, man.

[59:37] Decent amount of games.

[59:42] See, if it were me right now,

[59:44] I'd be buying Disney stock, not Disney pinball machines.

[59:48] Disney's at $88 a share.

[59:52] Stock has been cut in half.

[59:55] I'd throw $100,000 in Disney now,

[59:58] and not $100,000 in pinball machines.

[01:00:02] They'll be fine in the long run.

[01:00:03] They're just going through a bad patch.

[01:00:06] When Netflix crashed down,

[01:00:08] when Netflix, this is a year ago, people,

[01:00:10] when Netflix, right, when the war in the Ukraine happened

[01:00:13] and people did not sign,

[01:00:14] the Russian Netflix subscriptions went away,

[01:00:17] Netflix stock went from 700 a share to 160.

[01:00:26] Netflix, like Netflix is not going anywhere.

[01:00:30] You put $100,000 in there,

[01:00:31] you now would have $350,000 in one year.

[01:00:36] Or you could buy pinball machines.

[01:00:48] Oh, so Don, you're a doctor.

[01:00:51] Awesome, brother.

[01:00:54] All right, so you got the money.

[01:00:55] You got the money.

[01:00:59] Yeah, well, look,

[01:01:01] I think we obviously all know this.

[01:01:07] We all know we're in a little bit of a news lull.

[01:01:10] Like we're excited for toppers.

[01:01:13] Like this, when we get to this point,

[01:01:16] where we get excited for toppers,

[01:01:18] like big topper news, Godzilla, like, you know,

[01:01:21] great Godzilla topper.

[01:01:23] Let me tell you right now,

[01:01:24] you're not going to get your money's worth

[01:01:26] on the Godzilla topper.

[01:01:28] You're going to pay $1,000 for something I guarantee you,

[01:01:33] Stern makes for $100.

[01:01:38] You will pay $1,000 for something

[01:01:41] that I bet costs are in $100 to make.

[01:01:44] So how about it?

[01:01:46] Go for it.

[01:01:49] Put it on top of your Godzilla.

[01:01:51] Guess what it's going to do to the game?

[01:01:52] Nothing.

[01:01:54] Nothing.

[01:01:56] It's just, I mean, Godzilla's already had

[01:01:59] its glorious run of the industry.

[01:02:14] So like, look, it is what it is.

[01:02:16] Like, I mean, it'll be cool to see it.

[01:02:18] Is a pinball topper worth more than five minutes

[01:02:21] on a podcast?

[01:02:22] No.

[01:02:29] I think, here's what I think.

[01:02:30] I think this is just going to be the year

[01:02:33] like only Stern is going to have a successful year.

[01:02:38] That's my take on 2023 people.

[01:02:41] I think only Stern is really going to have

[01:02:43] a successful year.

[01:02:46] I think it is Venom.

[01:02:48] I think those crappy teasers, like something amazing,

[01:02:51] those are not Stern teasers people.

[01:02:54] Those are not Stern teasers.

[01:02:57] Stern doesn't do stupid teasers like that.

[01:03:07] I'm excited, like I always say this, I always say this.

[01:03:10] And let me tell you why, let me tell you why I'm really

[01:03:13] excited about where everything is at in pinball right now.

[01:03:18] I am excited because I think there has never been

[01:03:20] a better time to be in this hobby.

[01:03:24] I'll tell you why.

[01:03:26] Yes, prices are bonkers.

[01:03:28] Yes, use game prices are bonkers, but it was always

[01:03:32] going to go that way.

[01:03:34] We all know it.

[01:03:34] Go look at cars, go eBay Porsche, right?

[01:03:38] And search by high to low.

[01:03:41] All these GT3s for 300,000.

[01:03:43] Imagine if everyone who owns a single nice car

[01:03:48] was also into pinball.

[01:03:50] Do you know what $15,000 is to those people?

[01:03:56] It's nothing.

[01:03:59] For a toy for a wealthy man, this hobby is still just,

[01:04:05] I don't know, like how do you price something

[01:04:10] that's actually really, like for a lot of you dudes

[01:04:13] out there, this is more fun to you than a car

[01:04:17] and a watch, right?

[01:04:19] Like this watch, let's see.

[01:04:22] They mass produced this thing.

[01:04:24] I love it.

[01:04:26] It's a very fashionable watch.

[01:04:29] Tag Hue, Monaco, right?

[01:04:31] St. McQueen's watch, Studywar.

[01:04:35] They mass produced this thing.

[01:04:38] It's nice.

[01:04:38] It's got like a, you can see the mechanism inside it.

[01:04:45] $6,000.

[01:04:46] And this is just a basic entry level nice watch.

[01:04:51] I would say like, I don't know, $6,000, right?

[01:04:53] Okay.

[01:04:55] Look how much more goes into a Stern Pro.

[01:04:57] I mean, I don't really think we've seen the ceiling at all.

[01:05:05] You keep that watch up your ass.

[01:05:12] You know, so like,

[01:05:17] so here's why I love being in the hobby right now.

[01:05:20] It's a collector's hobby right now.

[01:05:22] The players are getting priced out.

[01:05:25] Like if you're just, if you just want to bang on a game,

[01:05:28] yeah, like Stern will sell you the pro,

[01:05:31] but man, you're looking at the direction of this hobby.

[01:05:33] Like, like what happened?

[01:05:36] But look, the good news is there are more pinball locations.

[01:05:39] You're going to be able to bang on machines

[01:05:41] to your heart's desire

[01:05:42] and you're not going to need to own everything

[01:05:44] and you're not going to buy anything at these prices.

[01:05:46] So you're good.

[01:05:50] So here's the thing.

[01:05:52] I love pinball right now because of two things, two things.

[01:06:00] I love that prices are this high because that's number one.

[01:06:05] I love that everyone has climbed into this hobby now

[01:06:09] and it's like a 10 to $15,000 proposition.

[01:06:12] I love that, right?

[01:06:14] That there's 15 companies all trying to sell us

[01:06:16] product around that price.

[01:06:19] That's reason number one, right?

[01:06:20] We get to watch 15 companies try to sell us pinball machines

[01:06:24] roughly around 10,000 to $15,000.

[01:06:29] The reason why I love this hobby right now

[01:06:30] more than ever before is reason number two,

[01:06:34] is for that much money,

[01:06:36] these games need to be freaking masterpieces

[01:06:40] or it's so easy to pass on them.

[01:06:44] There's never been an easier time

[01:06:46] since I've been following this hobby

[01:06:48] to not feel the urge to buy every single new game.

[01:06:53] It's stupid.

[01:06:54] It's too much money and most of the games

[01:06:57] are not as good as they're priced at.

[01:07:02] It's just not there.

[01:07:05] And if you listen to Canada and you wait,

[01:07:10] look at what's happening if you wait.

[01:07:12] You get a Scooby-Doo for two to 3,000 less.

[01:07:14] You're gonna get Godfather for 3,000 less.

[01:07:17] You're gonna get Guns N' Roses for 4,000 less.

[01:07:20] You're gonna get everything for less money.

[01:07:22] If you wait, like there are people that bought day one,

[01:07:26] James Bond 60th for 22,000 with tax from Stern, $22,000.

[01:07:34] They would have saved $7,000 if they listened to Canada.

[01:07:37] Trust me, James Bond 60th is gonna net out

[01:07:40] at like 12 grand for one.

[01:07:42] A year from now, once you see Keith Elwin's jaws,

[01:07:47] James Bond 60th will be so forgotten.

[01:07:49] It's not even funny.

[01:07:51] I'd rather have a woe-nelly, big, juicy melon.

[01:07:54] It's just more interesting cabinet, at least.

[01:07:58] So it's easy.

[01:07:59] It's easy.

[01:08:00] Like, and I'm at a stage in my life now

[01:08:02] where like it's all about cash flow, wealth generation,

[01:08:06] getting a house, investing in things

[01:08:08] that are gonna make my life better.

[01:08:10] I will have two to three pinball machines and that's it.

[01:08:13] I will not buy more than two to three pinball machines.

[01:08:21] I don't want to have more than three pinball machines

[01:08:24] in my home.

[01:08:25] I don't.

[01:08:27] I hope I have friends in the neighborhood

[01:08:29] I can talk into getting into the hobby, right?

[01:08:31] I mean, think about it.

[01:08:32] When I move, I'm most likely gonna move

[01:08:34] somewhere in Connecticut.

[01:08:36] When I move into town and I make friends

[01:08:38] with the people that have much more money than me,

[01:08:41] what do you do, Chris?

[01:08:42] Well, I do marketing, I'm a creative,

[01:08:43] I'm also a new pinball podcasting.

[01:08:44] Oh yeah, like, and these are people with, you know,

[01:08:46] four, five, 6,000 square foot homes.

[01:08:50] So strategically, I could be the guy that wants

[01:08:53] to have them all in my house or I'll talk to the lawyers

[01:08:57] and the doctors and the hedge fund managers like,

[01:08:59] hey, like, should buy a few pinball machines.

[01:09:01] Oh yeah, that sounds cool.

[01:09:02] Which one should I get?

[01:09:03] Okay, and I'll recommend all the ones

[01:09:06] that I don't want to buy that are still good games.

[01:09:08] Oh.

[01:09:17] Like, I don't think having 20 watches

[01:09:21] and 20 pinball machines and 20 cars, like,

[01:09:28] for the people that can do that, great.

[01:09:32] But I've never met anyone truly happy

[01:09:36] because of the things they've owned.

[01:09:38] I've met people that are happy because of what they produced

[01:09:42] in life, right?

[01:09:43] Like something they created themselves,

[01:09:46] like through their career, their business,

[01:09:49] that's what brings them fulfillment, their family,

[01:09:53] not buying $15,000 pinball machines.

[01:10:00] I don't want to have a lot of them.

[01:10:03] I also think when you walk into a room,

[01:10:05] and I mean this, I've seen a lot of your game rooms,

[01:10:12] I think a pinball machine is like,

[01:10:14] when you have like one in the right room

[01:10:17] where like everything in that room

[01:10:18] is thought through properly,

[01:10:20] I think it stands out way more.

[01:10:23] And you're actually able to appreciate that machine way more

[01:10:28] than when you shove it in a line of like 20 games

[01:10:31] or 10 games or 50 games in the room.

[01:10:34] Like I, you know what I'm saying?

[01:10:35] Like now nothing feels like it has any attention.

[01:10:41] And again, like I just don't want to have an arcade

[01:10:44] in my home.

[01:10:45] I did that, I had it, I have a few games here.

[01:10:49] Let me tell you what happens,

[01:10:50] people never come over to play.

[01:10:53] They rarely does anything get used

[01:10:57] and I'd rather be doing something else.

[01:11:05] Am I coming to Iowa this weekend?

[01:11:09] No.

[01:11:11] Someone just said some games sold for a lot of money

[01:11:13] in Iowa. Emily, I'm wondering if you bought it.

[01:11:20] So Don, let me ask you a question.

[01:11:21] Don, Don, do you go to the gym,

[01:11:27] do you exercise, Don, at least as much

[01:11:30] as you play pinball a week?

[01:11:32] I'm going to put people on the spot here.

[01:11:35] Don's a public figure so we can put them on the spot.

[01:11:41] Imagine if everybody did as many pushups

[01:11:44] as they did plunges every week.

[01:11:49] You could do it.

[01:11:57] I think I'm always going to go to the gym.

[01:11:59] You know, I like going to a gym.

[01:12:01] I'm not going to put a gym in my home.

[01:12:04] Just, I don't like the way exercise equipment

[01:12:07] looks in the house.

[01:12:10] Again, it's just me.

[01:12:11] It's like I think getting to the gym,

[01:12:16] I like seeing other people exercising.

[01:12:18] It's motivating.

[01:12:24] That's a game.

[01:12:25] You know, look, I think everyone knows

[01:12:28] what they need to do.

[01:12:29] Everyone here is an adult.

[01:12:30] Everyone knows like the right balance they need.

[01:12:33] Following our own advice is always the hardest thing.

[01:12:40] Look, we've got a long weekend.

[01:12:42] It's gonna be fun.

[01:12:43] You guys, you know, drinking beers, playing pinball,

[01:12:46] enjoying the good weather.

[01:12:47] John's in New York.

[01:12:48] John knows how nice it is outside.

[01:12:49] Like it is, it is perfect weather.

[01:12:54] Perfect weather.

[01:13:01] Can you hear the push up challenge?

[01:13:09] Did someone ask you about expo?

[01:13:11] Push up challenge at expo?

[01:13:12] Okay.

[01:13:16] Oh Hans, that sounds great.

[01:13:17] Wine tasting.

[01:13:21] My thing with wine is I am,

[01:13:23] I feel like you give me a bottle of wine

[01:13:26] and I'm like, I'm gonna go get a bottle of wine.

[01:13:29] You give me a bottle of wine that's like 50 bucks

[01:13:32] and like, I love it.

[01:13:33] Jack, danger's in the mother of FN house.

[01:13:36] Jack, welcome to the Saturday morning's particular.

[01:13:40] We talked about you earlier,

[01:13:42] but we wanna say live thank you

[01:13:45] for all of your amazing streams.

[01:13:48] We'll always be the world's best pinball streamer.

[01:13:51] The only man that can actually play a game

[01:13:53] and read the chat and make it engaging all at the same time.

[01:13:57] Not sure why you help other companies,

[01:13:59] so they're games, but look,

[01:14:02] I think you're gonna find the middle ground, Jack.

[01:14:04] You will, you will.

[01:14:05] And it's always hard, like,

[01:14:07] I was talking all about how like,

[01:14:08] I don't do enough for Brenda and Killian and I don't

[01:14:11] and I feel guilty about it.

[01:14:13] And I think the hardest part about being a new dad

[01:14:17] and John, you probably know this too at Jack Bar.

[01:14:19] Just like not, some of it's just not fun.

[01:14:21] Some of it's just damn boring.

[01:14:22] Like being a new parent can be damn boring

[01:14:25] and no one tells you that until you're in it.

[01:14:32] I don't know, guys are like,

[01:14:35] men are weird.

[01:14:36] Like we're weird in the sense that like,

[01:14:38] we don't really wanna do stuff we don't wanna do.

[01:14:40] You know, I'm always getting in this debate with Brenda.

[01:14:42] She's like, you never wanna do what you don't wanna do.

[01:14:44] I'm like, yeah, well, yeah,

[01:14:45] why would I wanna do stuff I don't wanna do?

[01:14:48] And one of my first reviews at work in my first company,

[01:14:56] I was like 23 years old, 24 years old.

[01:15:05] My boss said to me, your problem is you only wanna work

[01:15:10] on the accounts you wanna work on

[01:15:12] and you don't wanna work on the stuff

[01:15:14] that doesn't interest you.

[01:15:15] And I just looked at him like, yeah.

[01:15:18] Yeah, bro, that's how it works.

[01:15:22] I'm not gonna be like, oh yeah,

[01:15:23] I wanna do like shampoo and conditioner companies.

[01:15:34] All right.

[01:15:41] John said being a parent is the most satisfying.

[01:15:45] It is absolutely satisfying.

[01:15:48] It's even more like,

[01:15:51] I give an example.

[01:15:53] Sometimes you just see your kid do something

[01:15:57] and it's just amazing to see the origins of life.

[01:16:02] Just the origins of how we process things

[01:16:07] and things stimulate us.

[01:16:08] So, Killian takes a drink of his milk the other day

[01:16:10] and he goes,

[01:16:14] he's like, and he goes,

[01:16:18] and I'm like, that is the greatest,

[01:16:21] like I've ever heard.

[01:16:22] Like just the way his beverage satiated his thirst

[01:16:26] and he's just like, ah.

[01:16:28] You know, like he has no care in the world.

[01:16:30] He knows nothing about taxes or pinball prices

[01:16:33] or any of the drama on pin side.

[01:16:35] He's just, he's like, ah.

[01:16:39] So beautiful to witness.

[01:16:44] Well, look, gang, now is the time where like,

[01:16:47] usually Donald Hopkins gets us the 40,000 stars.

[01:16:50] I think we got 40,000 stars last weekend.

[01:16:52] Now we got 595.

[01:16:53] I can't even order soy sauce,

[01:16:55] a pack of soy sauce for this bill.

[01:16:58] You're watching me suffer, Bill.

[01:17:00] I can't believe it.

[01:17:03] We didn't talk about the Ballet Williams remakes.

[01:17:06] They're all coming gang.

[01:17:09] You're gonna get another version of Tales

[01:17:12] of the Arabian Nights.

[01:17:13] So if you have a toad in and you want a new one,

[01:17:15] now's a good time to sell it.

[01:17:17] We're gonna get a new version of Theater of Magic.

[01:17:19] If you have one and you want a new one with all better stuff,

[01:17:22] now's a good time to sell it.

[01:17:24] We're gonna get a new Twilight Zone if you have one,

[01:17:26] but you want a brand new one with all better stuff,

[01:17:28] you better sell it.

[01:17:31] Twilight Zone, Theater of Magic,

[01:17:34] and Tales of the Arabian Nights.

[01:17:37] They're all coming back.

[01:17:43] All of them, maybe Circus, they're all gonna come back.

[01:17:48] Yeah, I'm for real.

[01:17:50] I'm not joking here.

[01:17:53] Here's what's gonna tip everything off.

[01:17:55] You wanna know how you'll know which ones are coming first?

[01:17:59] Simply look out for when a large bulk order happens

[01:18:04] of parts for one of those games.

[01:18:09] You're gonna see Padredy Gaming announce a remake soon.

[01:18:14] You know, Padredy Gaming making Queen and Alien,

[01:18:18] you think that's where they're gonna stop?

[01:18:21] Nope.

[01:18:23] My, I am making a very educated guess.

[01:18:29] Padredy Gaming will be making Twilight Zone remake.

[01:18:36] Look, gang, I've already spoken to people

[01:18:40] like involved with this project, it's happening.

[01:18:42] I'm not lying to you, I don't care if NAPS Arcade

[01:18:46] doesn't ever give me any credit for anything.

[01:18:49] It's happening, Matrix is coming from Jersey Jack,

[01:18:52] Steve Ritchie, boom.

[01:18:58] This stuff is all gonna happen.

[01:19:00] That's why I'm like, gang, why would you jump

[01:19:03] into any of these games right now?

[01:19:04] Why would you throw tons of money at Godfather,

[01:19:06] tons of money at a collective tank force?

[01:19:09] When you know what's around the corner,

[01:19:11] and I know a lot, it's such an easy time

[01:19:16] to just sit back, chill, put on your tag,

[01:19:19] hu-er, sip a glass of rosé this weekend,

[01:19:22] and don't send a check-in for $15,000 for something

[01:19:26] right now.

[01:19:28] Again, I'm just trying to save you, gang,

[01:19:30] I'm trying to save you guys money.

[01:19:32] If you want a Godfather Collector's Edition, guess what?

[01:19:36] You'll be able to get it for $12,000 in six months.

[01:19:39] New in box, new in box, people.

[01:19:43] You actually think a thousand CEs sold at $15,000

[01:19:47] to a customer?

[01:19:50] Come on, the big distributors are gonna sit on them

[01:19:54] for a while.

[01:19:58] They're, what people here seem to forget,

[01:20:01] you think distributors are allocating their games

[01:20:05] to customers one to one?

[01:20:10] Gang, wake up.

[01:20:13] Oh, then all of a sudden you're gonna see distributors

[01:20:15] with new in box this for $18,000.

[01:20:18] The distributors are speculating now

[01:20:21] and holding back inventory.

[01:20:25] They don't want you to feel like you can get one right now

[01:20:28] because they wanna speculate.

[01:20:30] I'll tell you the game, the game that's gonna make

[01:20:42] people the most money.

[01:20:46] The game that's gonna make the biggest flip this year

[01:20:48] for money, money, money, money, pulp fiction alley.

[01:20:54] Pulp fiction alley, I think pulp fiction alley,

[01:20:58] where they charge like 9,700 for it.

[01:21:05] Right?

[01:21:07] Yeah.

[01:21:09] Pulp fiction alleys will go for 15 grand, new in box.

[01:21:14] Easily, easily.

[01:21:18] It's freaking pulp fiction.

[01:21:21] It's just, just watch, trust me.

[01:21:25] You will see pulp fiction alleys go for 15k.

[01:21:29] And people will buy them.

[01:21:31] I don't think over that, but you're gonna see pulp fiction

[01:21:35] alleys go for that much.

[01:21:39] The topper will be on obtain him.

[01:21:41] No one will separate the topper from the game.

[01:21:45] The topper alone is worth,

[01:21:49] I mean, it's hard to put a price on it, right?

[01:21:54] Everyone who buys a regular pulp fiction

[01:21:56] is gonna have L.E.N.V. everybody.

[01:21:59] Nobody's gonna not, nobody's gonna wanna have

[01:22:01] the basic addition of the game.

[01:22:05] Nobody.

[01:22:06] You're gonna want the L.E.

[01:22:09] I wouldn't buy a non-L.E. of pulp fiction.

[01:22:12] I would not wanna have that game without that topper.

[01:22:19] It's too good.

[01:22:21] It's integrated into the game.

[01:22:23] It's part of the gameplay experience.

[01:22:27] I bought a pulp fiction instantly.

[01:22:33] Now, I may have a pulp fiction alleys

[01:22:37] to do the Canadian Raffle, right?

[01:22:40] Where people get a chance to buy one at sticker price.

[01:22:45] But I don't know, you know?

[01:22:47] I think I'm just gonna do it for club members.

[01:22:51] And last time I did it for the new club members,

[01:22:57] but this time,

[01:23:05] Don, look at Don trying to,

[01:23:07] look at Don, Don didn't get a pulp fiction alley.

[01:23:12] And he's trying to convince himself that it's,

[01:23:14] oh, it's just scopes, Don,

[01:23:17] you bought a Star Wars topper that looks like shit,

[01:23:20] that does shit.

[01:23:23] All right, Don, right?

[01:23:24] R2-D2 looks like shit.

[01:23:26] What is he even popping out of?

[01:23:30] That topper is ass.

[01:23:33] And how much of, like, Don,

[01:23:36] it looks like shit on top of the game.

[01:23:38] Pulp Fiction topper looks amazing.

[01:23:41] It's one of the best toppers in the history of Pimble.

[01:23:44] I'm one of the coolest games in the history of Pimble.

[01:23:49] He bebops.

[01:23:52] As you see, Don, telling you, bro,

[01:23:55] you're gonna get a Pulp Fiction alley.

[01:23:57] You're gonna cancel your SE order,

[01:23:59] because ordering one was stupid.

[01:24:01] You should have waited.

[01:24:04] You should grab an alley now for 2000 over sticker

[01:24:07] while you still can.

[01:24:09] I'm trying to be helpful.

[01:24:10] Don, you're new.

[01:24:12] I know the type.

[01:24:14] You're new to the hobby kind of.

[01:24:16] You haven't seen this before,

[01:24:18] and you're gonna wait too long.

[01:24:22] You look, you already waited too long.

[01:24:26] I, you gotta grab it now before the games get made.

[01:24:31] Once people start seeing these games unboxed

[01:24:34] and the beauty that is Pulp Fiction,

[01:24:36] because I've stood over this game,

[01:24:38] you're, the prices are gonna go up.

[01:24:42] No, but Don, the mistake you made was,

[01:24:45] why are you wasting money on a Star Wars topper

[01:24:48] when you simply should take that money

[01:24:51] and go grab a Pulp Fiction alley spot right now?

[01:24:55] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[01:24:57] You're not investing,

[01:24:58] and you don't care about the Star Wars topper.

[01:25:03] You want, you think about not getting a Pulp Fiction alley

[01:25:07] more than you think about that Star Wars topper.

[01:25:15] The other thing about this,

[01:25:16] I think you're gonna see Pulp Fiction's made pretty quickly.

[01:25:19] I don't think you're gonna see the big light.

[01:25:21] First of all, thank you for the stars.

[01:25:24] Who, we just got 3,000 stars from Hector.

[01:25:29] And I hope we see Rocky for.

[01:25:33] Gang, it is, we are at time, is a fun show today.

[01:25:37] It goes quickly, it goes quickly.

[01:25:42] I think we're gonna, you know, look, trust me,

[01:25:45] invest in yourself, invest in your health.

[01:25:49] Wait it out right now.

[01:25:52] Right, wait it out.

[01:25:53] There are a lot of games coming,

[01:25:55] but at these prices, these games need to be masterpieces.

[01:25:58] I think, you know, Foo Fighter owners,

[01:26:00] you guys are having a blast.

[01:26:01] The game's a great hit.

[01:26:03] Game's doing really well.

[01:26:06] Other than Foo Fighters,

[01:26:09] slow burn on Godfather,

[01:26:12] it's always gonna be that way.

[01:26:13] That game's never gonna fly off the shelves,

[01:26:15] not the L.E.s, at least.

[01:26:17] I don't think, or obviously not gonna see the C.E.s

[01:26:19] until June, but I think, you know, they're beautiful.

[01:26:23] And then here's what's gonna happen.

[01:26:25] L.E. owners that have fallen in love with their L.E.

[01:26:29] of Godfather, right?

[01:26:31] The dudes that bought it at 12,

[01:26:36] they're then gonna want a C.E. if they love the game.

[01:26:40] And they're gonna lose a ton of money selling their L.E.

[01:26:42] and then they're gonna spend,

[01:26:44] they're gonna lose like twice.

[01:26:45] I can't wait to my friend Derek,

[01:26:47] literally loses like five to $6,000

[01:26:50] just to own a Godfather,

[01:26:51] which is gonna be so easy to own.

[01:26:54] Because I can already see what he's doing.

[01:27:02] All right, everybody,

[01:27:02] I'm gonna go enjoy this beautiful weather.

[01:27:05] John, I'm gonna try to make it over to Jack Barn,

[01:27:07] have one of your frozen cocktails,

[01:27:09] make sure the machines are working.

[01:27:10] Every time I'm there,

[01:27:12] they're never frozen.

[01:27:13] I'm always waiting.

[01:27:15] Are they, are they, are they,

[01:27:17] you gotta keep them on all night, right?

[01:27:20] We'll see you guys next week.

[01:27:22] Really good bit of juicy information

[01:27:25] on the Canada's Pinball podcast coming up this week

[01:27:27] about Jersey Jack and the making of the Godfather.

[01:27:32] I have some really interesting true story

[01:27:34] that happened about the making of that game.
