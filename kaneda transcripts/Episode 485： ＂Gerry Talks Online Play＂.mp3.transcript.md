[00:00] Welcome to just another Pimball Podcast featuring Canada as your host.

[00:24] This is episode 485 of Canadian Pimball Podcast and we're going to talk to Jerry Stelemberg

[00:29] today about online play.

[00:32] So today Jerry announced that for the first time in modern Pimball history we have Pimball

[00:38] experiences that can be played online.

[00:41] You can play one game against another and I still to this day can't believe we are

[00:46] in 2020 and we are talking about online Pimball play as a revolutionary thing that hasn't

[00:54] been brought to market before.

[00:56] It's crazy to me that all of these boutique companies are the ones that are really pushing

[01:02] the Pimball innovation if you ask me.

[01:04] I mean online play is happening at P3, multi-morphic.

[01:07] Why isn't it happening at JJP?

[01:09] Why isn't it happening at Stern?

[01:12] Spooky Pimball has figured out how to create play fields that don't crater.

[01:16] Why isn't that happening at the other big manufacturers?

[01:19] So I think the answer is pretty simple and you're going to hear us talk about it is when

[01:22] you're selling a ton of stuff you don't really need to innovate.

[01:27] And so Pimball does pretty much stay the same for a very long time and for many of you

[01:32] out there that's good enough.

[01:34] For some of you out there you want to see new stuff happen.

[01:37] And so that's why I think we're excited to see what Deeproot does, we're excited to

[01:40] see what new companies do in Pimball because we do want to see people explore the possibilities

[01:46] of what Pimball can be and the possibilities of how we could enjoy Pimball in new ways.

[01:52] And with different variety.

[01:54] Now before I air this interview some good news.

[01:57] Spooky Pimball is back in business and I got the note today that my Rick and Morty machine

[02:03] number 50 with a butter cabinet is ready to be invoiced and it is ready to be shipped

[02:09] and it is inside a box.

[02:12] Woohoo, mother efforts.

[02:13] I am so excited that I can finally put a Pimball machine back into my apartment.

[02:18] I can finally be a legitimate Pimball podcast again.

[02:23] After all the criticisms that the world's number one show is hypocritical because the

[02:28] man himself does not have a Pimball machine.

[02:30] So here's the thing I'm working with my building management company this week to see if it's

[02:36] okay for me to accept the delivery of this game.

[02:41] And so I really hope we can do it.

[02:42] I can't wait to pay spooky for this game.

[02:44] And I have to say this.

[02:45] I have to say this.

[02:47] Spooky Pimball throughout this entire experience has been the most amazing Pimball company to

[02:53] work with and especially Morgan over there.

[02:57] If you've ever dealt with spooky Pimball and I haven't dealt with them on a sales level

[03:01] before I've critiqued their games.

[03:03] I've talked about them on my show but I was a customer and my interactions with them.

[03:09] I have to say this has been the greatest interactions I've ever had with a Pimball

[03:14] company.

[03:15] They immediately get back to your emails.

[03:17] They go over the moon to accommodate whatever you may need and whatever questions you may

[03:22] have and it's unbelievable.

[03:24] My situation is not the easiest one for them to figure out but they're so accommodating

[03:31] to me.

[03:32] They say Chris will hold on to the game until you can get it.

[03:36] You can pay us when you're ready.

[03:37] We know the situation you're in.

[03:39] So I have to say I've never dealt with a company that just makes it feel this good to

[03:45] buy from them.

[03:47] I want to say spooky Pimball not only do you have a home run theme but you really are

[03:52] treating customers in a way that I don't think they're getting from any other manufacturer

[03:57] out there and I mean that.

[03:58] I don't think there's any other manufacturer out there that has the customer service and

[04:03] the personal touch that spooky Pimball brings to the table.

[04:07] So I really, really can't wait to take possession of this game and no I'm not flipping the game.

[04:13] You people out there I have a heart and I want this game.

[04:15] This isn't like, this isn't like, you know, I'm just not flipping it because I don't want

[04:20] to say, you know, screw you guys for giving me an early number.

[04:22] No, I really love this game.

[04:24] I played it.

[04:25] I love it.

[04:26] I think those of you who get it are going to love it as well and I will review it objectively

[04:31] when I do get it.

[04:32] You know me.

[04:33] I don't hold back.

[04:34] Okay.

[04:35] Let's talk to Jerry about online play.

[04:36] All right.

[04:37] Ladies and gentlemen, it's kind of crazy that it is May of 2020 and we're going to be

[04:43] talking about Internet connectivity in Pimball for the first time I think when it comes to

[04:49] gameplay, thanks to Mr. Jerry Stellenberg of P3 Multimorphic.

[04:54] Jerry, welcome to the show.

[04:55] Take her.

[04:56] Yes.

[04:57] Thank you.

[04:58] Now Jerry, why is it taken so long to get Internet connectivity play into Pimball?

[05:02] I got the announcement today.

[05:04] So a couple things there.

[05:06] One we've had Internet, well, we've had network connectivity for a few years now with

[05:09] heads up in Cosmocart racing playing local games, but the Internet connectivity playing

[05:13] against people over the Internet is in fact new.

[05:16] And the reason for that is because I assume most people think Pimball is a physical game

[05:21] that you just play between you and the machine.

[05:23] And that debate rages on, right?

[05:25] Does it make sense to link up two games around the world?

[05:31] And what are your, I mean, obviously your thoughts are yes on that.

[05:33] What do you say to the skeptics who say that that's not really how Pimball should be played?

[05:38] Well, ultimately my goal is just to come up with new ways or fun ways for people to play

[05:45] Pimball to experience these games together.

[05:47] I don't really care if certain people don't see value in it.

[05:51] They just simply won't play it.

[05:52] But we've come up with some games with a platform with a game like CCR or heads up where

[05:57] it just makes sense to try to compete against somebody else.

[06:01] For me, in sports or in all of my social activities, I just love competition.

[06:07] And I love comparing myself to somebody else.

[06:09] You can do that locally on a Pimball machine or if you're by yourself on your machine,

[06:13] why not connect to someone else and see who can do better?

[06:16] I mean, I couldn't agree more when it comes to gaming and online play.

[06:20] I tell people this all the time.

[06:21] I actually enjoy playing Xbox more than Pimball.

[06:26] And it doesn't mean I don't love both of them.

[06:28] It's just, it's fun to know there's some other human being on the other end of the game

[06:32] on playing.

[06:34] Talk to me about the announcement today that P3-Multi-Morphic is flipping the switch and

[06:39] allowing people who have cosmic cart racing correct to play over the internet?

[06:43] Yes, that's right.

[06:44] And like I said, we've been working on network connectivity, linked games for a long time.

[06:50] Now we've allowed our customers to, mostly at shows because not many people have multiple

[06:55] P3s, but it shows people could walk up and get on multiple P3s and play against each other.

[07:00] This announcement today is the announcement for full internet connectivity, meaning I

[07:05] with my P3 sitting here in my living room can log on to a cosmic cart racing, ask it,

[07:11] who's out there who wants to play against me, set up sessions, I can connect to someone's

[07:14] session and we can race against each other.

[07:16] So let me ask you a question first before we go on to the network side of it.

[07:20] Does anyone have two?

[07:22] Have you sold two to one customer work in their house?

[07:25] They've got two of them next to each other?

[07:27] We've talked about it, but no, no one's pulled the trigger in a second one yet.

[07:31] Because it's a lot, right?

[07:32] I mean, that's a lot of money to invest in.

[07:33] I've played it at shows and it's super fun when they're connected to each other.

[07:37] What's the game where the blocks all come up and they go green or red?

[07:42] Yeah, you're talking about heads up.

[07:44] And to that point, the networking features for LAN, local area network are more for locations,

[07:52] arcades that have multiple games or might have multiple games, just like you would walk

[07:55] into a Dave and Busters or whatever, sit down at a racing game and play against your

[07:58] friends.

[07:59] But that's where it makes more sense to have multiple P3s.

[08:02] Now, I know people are not really going out to Dave and Busters and not to sort of side

[08:06] track this a little bit, but are you guys, I know you were testing Dave and Busters out

[08:10] as a possible location?

[08:11] Are you guys still in there right now?

[08:14] We're not in there.

[08:15] We went through the full testing trial.

[08:17] We got all the data.

[08:19] They are, I don't know what their current process is actually, but they were in the middle

[08:23] of deciding what to buy for the next year.

[08:26] Okay.

[08:27] And arcades are mostly closed down and Dave and Busters are probably, I don't think they're

[08:30] on the essential list yet as reopening start to happen, but I think they might be in the

[08:35] next round.

[08:36] Entertaining places and bars are starting to figure this whole thing out.

[08:40] So, let's talk about across the internet.

[08:44] How does someone who has a P3 multi-morphic this weekend play someone else?

[08:49] What are the steps?

[08:50] Like, walk me through it if I have one.

[08:52] What do I do?

[08:53] Yeah.

[08:54] Super easy.

[08:55] You'll download the latest updates, stick it on your machine, then it's going to act just

[08:58] like it normally does with CCR.

[09:00] You'll launch the application.

[09:01] You'll hit the start button.

[09:03] When you hit the start button, you get a little menu that says, do you want to play a career

[09:06] mode game, an arcade mode game, or an internet game?

[09:10] If you select internet game, it takes you to what we call a networking lobby where it

[09:14] just lists the games that other people might be hosting or you can select yourself to host

[09:19] the game, you get to select which racetrack you want to play over and how many you laps

[09:23] you want to race and those kind of details.

[09:26] And then you simply wait for people to connect.

[09:29] And when they connect, it'll show you you've got two players waiting or three players

[09:32] waiting or whatever.

[09:33] And at any time, you can hit the launch button to kick off the game.

[09:36] It drops you right into a race and then you're playing CCR.

[09:40] Now, when you update the game, is it USB stick or is Wi-Fi update available?

[09:46] It has kind of funny to talk about internet connected gameplay and still using USB sticks.

[09:50] But yes, we're still using USB.

[09:52] We've got a long roadmap, a lot of features that we're going to build into our networking

[09:56] subsystem and updates will be there.

[09:58] But the focus for us was on obviously getting cool, exciting gameplay features and where

[10:04] people could enjoy more of the gaming experience.

[10:06] And now, since we're all isolated and playing pinball at home, hopefully give them a way

[10:11] to experience the social aspects of pinball, but even during isolation.

[10:15] So talk to me about how the gameplay is different when you select an online game with someone

[10:21] else who has a P3 and a cosmic cart racing.

[10:24] So what's the game the same like?

[10:27] How did you code that so that with everybody, right?

[10:29] So four guys are racing in the same race.

[10:32] Yeah, so cosmic cart racing now has the three different play modes.

[10:37] The thing we added a couple of months ago was called career mode, which is a traditional

[10:41] three ball type of game with traditional rules and multi balls on modes and that kind of

[10:45] thing.

[10:46] We're not talking about that here.

[10:48] This is the arcade style of racing where you start a game if you were in a location or

[10:55] in your home before you would just hit start.

[10:59] And if there were players connected to you locally, they would join the game where you'd

[11:02] play against computers.

[11:04] Computers would be the other three cards.

[11:06] Cosmic cart racing is a four player game.

[11:08] So there's a track with four tracks or a race with four tracks and four players.

[11:12] So the code is smart enough to know if you're connected to other machines, then use those

[11:18] other machines as input to control the cart.

[11:22] And if you're not connected to other machines, then there's an algorithm that just controls

[11:26] the AI, the computer cart.

[11:28] So as a player on your machine, fundamentally, you don't know if the guy controlling the

[11:34] other cart is a computer or a real person until you connect to our system and it shows

[11:39] you their profile name.

[11:40] But it gives you some indications that the real people.

[11:43] When you're playing, and I haven't played too much Cosmic cart racing, so when you're

[11:47] playing and you're racing someone else, it's not your traditional three balls and you

[11:54] drain game over.

[11:55] Is it, do you get as many balls as you need just to finish the race and that's the point

[11:58] is to win the race?

[11:59] Yeah, that's exactly right.

[12:01] This is a racing game.

[12:02] It's not a three ball pinball game.

[12:03] This is modeled after Mario Kart or something.

[12:07] And the big difference is you're using a physical pinball and flippers instead of a control

[12:12] pad with a directional pad and buttons.

[12:15] How long does each race last roughly?

[12:17] Roughly a minute or two minutes.

[12:20] Okay.

[12:21] So it's, you can get some, if you only have like 10 minutes to kill, you can have some

[12:24] quick fun and jump on and have a few races.

[12:27] Yeah, that's the whole point.

[12:29] Just like again, the Dave and Buster example, you walk into Dave and Buster, just sit down

[12:32] at a racer, you play a 90 second game, you see who wins and then you move on to the next

[12:35] game.

[12:36] How long did it take to come up with this and how long have you been planning this implementation?

[12:41] Oh gosh.

[12:42] So P3s have shipped from day one with Wi-Fi adapters and then because we intended all along to

[12:49] build in a whole suite of networking features.

[12:51] The cosmic heart racing was the second game we conceived for the platform right after

[12:56] Lexi Lightspeed and it again is built or it's conceived around the car, the kart racing

[13:01] idea, Mario Kart and those kind of games where you're racing against other players.

[13:07] So we went traditional with Lexi and then we went very non-traditional with cosmic heart

[13:11] racing.

[13:12] We kind of skewed very far away from the traditional three ball pinball game.

[13:17] We created this racing game.

[13:18] We fully intended all along to have it be networked, which is why the first implementation

[13:25] was this racing implementation where you're racing against three other players and that's

[13:30] why we developed these local area network based connectivity.

[13:35] The internet capabilities have always been in the plans but it's a ton of work to work

[13:41] through all of the ins and outs and the details of connecting to other machines to making

[13:46] sure the connections are reliable for making sure they can all register their game with

[13:52] a matchmaker and the matchmaker coordinates who connects to who and what do you do if

[13:56] ten people want to play and they all try to join the same game and there's just a lot

[14:00] of details to work out.

[14:01] So we've been working out for a long time but now we feel it's stable enough and tested

[14:05] well enough to go out to the message.

[14:08] Talk to me about lag and Wi-Fi.

[14:11] Has that been an issue because when you think about connecting to other machines and pinball

[14:15] as a fast-paced game and things are happening lightning quick in real time, is there any concern

[14:20] of the Wi-Fi connection has to be at a base level for the machines to work properly together?

[14:26] Well, there's machines working and talking together and their specific game implementations.

[14:32] If some random person came up with a game and said, hey, I want to connect these together,

[14:36] what data do I have to send back and forth to do it?

[14:39] Chances are it's not going to work very well.

[14:41] Really when you're designing network games, you have to design the network game.

[14:45] You have to figure out the minimum amount of data that you need to transfer back and forth.

[14:50] You need to conceive how the graphics on the screen might not completely represent where

[14:55] the other player is right now because you haven't gotten that piece of data that says

[14:58] there two meters ahead of where they are now.

[15:01] So there's a ton of work, ton of design work and a ton of planning that goes into how

[15:06] you build a network game.

[15:09] Racing games are very common in the arcade world so there's a pretty well-known kind of design

[15:14] cycle for those.

[15:16] If you came up with a card game, card game where you're playing spades or hearts or something,

[15:21] it's much less dependent on latency because you can wait an extra three seconds for someone

[15:25] to flip the cards over.

[15:26] But in the racing game, if you don't get the data pretty quickly, you're not going to

[15:30] know where they are.

[15:31] They're going to play a power up against you and they're going to see you blow up on

[15:34] their machine and you're not going to blow up on your machine.

[15:37] So yeah, there's some considerations there.

[15:39] But generally, you try to design the structure of the game so that those are minimized.

[15:43] Okay.

[15:44] So how long, how long in development is this?

[15:46] Are we talking a year, six months, two years, 18 million years?

[15:49] How long have we been working on this baby?

[15:52] So CCR, customer cart racing was about a two-year development cycle.

[15:58] It ended about six months ago for the base CCR stuff.

[16:03] We took about a year to develop the infrastructure for internet connectivity.

[16:10] This is outside of customer cart racing, all of the multi-morphic framework features

[16:13] and the networking traffic and all the basic stuff and structure that took about a year.

[16:19] And then it took about three or four months to integrate those new features back into

[16:24] the game so we could attach to the internet processes instead of the local processes.

[16:29] So altogether, I mean, CCR has been about a three-year project.

[16:32] But adding internet capabilities, the interesting thing is it's taken about a year, but the

[16:37] best part about it is since we're talking about the P3, which is a framework.

[16:40] Now we've all this infrastructure built the next game.

[16:43] We're going to integrate internet capabilities into heads up.

[16:47] That game that you were talking about where you play against the guy shoot the green blocks

[16:51] or the red blocks, that's going to take a week or two weeks or whatever.

[16:54] Yeah, I mean, that game, I've always said it.

[16:56] I've played it at shows.

[16:58] It's super addictive.

[16:59] I mean, anyone who's played it, networked, it's a lot of fun.

[17:04] And so that's going to come out soon.

[17:07] And so we just saw the highs.

[17:09] I mean, I'm going to stop saying the highest.

[17:12] And we're going to talk about that in a little bit because I know we talked right when

[17:15] we were getting into this pandemic.

[17:17] So is internet connectivity something you could apply to that game as well?

[17:22] Technically, yes.

[17:25] But the question is, does it make sense?

[17:27] We'll probably go over some to try to figure out what we want to do with networking, but

[17:31] we're not going to force a feature on a game just because it's a cool box to check

[17:34] off.

[17:35] So there might be ways to put people in a cooperative mode or to do some kind of statistical

[17:40] tracking based on who can get to a mode faster, beat something quicker.

[17:44] But those aren't that interesting to me, at least right now.

[17:48] I'm more interested in developing games that are designed around battling people and

[17:54] doing some specific all over the network that just makes sense.

[17:57] You know, it's, it's, I really do encourage people to play heads up when you get to a show

[18:01] and obviously cosmic cart racing because it's, it's, it's, it's foreign to most pinball

[18:07] people, right, Jeremy?

[18:08] I mean, people are not used to, I think the closest people got back in the day was the

[18:12] two NBA games you could connect to each other.

[18:15] I'm not sure how many other games had network play like that.

[18:18] Yeah, I think there was one other one as well.

[18:21] But yeah, we've obviously done a lot of different things with the P3 one.

[18:24] It looks a little bit, it looks a little bit different.

[18:27] It feels a little bit different.

[18:29] And then we've come out with games that plague different.

[18:31] So people walk up to the P3s generally a little scared regardless of what the game is.

[18:37] But when people put some time on it, when people, there was a, I tell the story all the time,

[18:41] the first T.P.F. we took heads up to was I think 2017.

[18:45] And then there were a group of, I think they were all sisters or friends that played on

[18:51] the soccer team.

[18:52] They were probably 10 or 11 years old.

[18:54] They were with one of the fathers and they got them heads up and their kids.

[18:58] So they didn't really have a strong understanding of what pinball was, but they understood network

[19:05] to game play and battling against people and hitting these very simple shots to complete

[19:09] tasks.

[19:11] And they sat on those machines for two hours jumping up and down, giggling, screaming,

[19:15] being super competitive.

[19:16] It was a blast to watch.

[19:17] I remember playing with Brenda and she really enjoyed it.

[19:19] I mean, it's simple, competitive fun to your point of view.

[19:24] You never really get that player versus player.

[19:27] And that's why I love fighting games in the arcade world.

[19:29] It's you're standing next to the person you're fighting or you're playing them online.

[19:33] And it's quick.

[19:34] It's, it's quick, snackable fun that really pinball is not really known for that.

[19:40] I mean, it's either long, deep games or brutal games that you experience mostly by yourself

[19:47] or you're just playing for score, but you're not really battling.

[19:50] When you thought of cosmic heart racing, how does it work in the race?

[19:54] And something I do in my machine, how does that impact what might happen in someone else's

[19:59] machine?

[20:00] Yeah.

[20:01] So you hit the launch button.

[20:02] It stages a ball and the ramp and then it counts everyone down together and it feeds

[20:06] the ball to the flipper.

[20:07] At that point, whatever you do, whatever shots you hit, either affect your progress in the

[20:12] game.

[20:13] If you hit one of the lit shots, one of the shots that are lit the same color as your

[20:16] track, then it accelerates you.

[20:19] Your car goes faster.

[20:20] Your opponent will see you going faster.

[20:23] If you drain, then your car spins out.

[20:25] It goes to zero speed.

[20:26] You stop moving and your opponent's wall see you spin out on their machines or on their

[20:31] screens.

[20:32] Now you can, at certain times during the race, there's a power up shot that's lit.

[20:38] In a traditional game like a Mario Kart, you'll be driving along and you'll see a square

[20:42] box with a question mark in it when you, when you drive over that, you collect the power

[20:46] up.

[20:47] You have a similar concept where at certain points along the track, it'll light a captive

[20:53] ball shot on the physical play field.

[20:55] If you shoot that captive ball, then the game awards you a power up.

[21:00] That power up could be an EMP, could be a blockade, it could be a speed boost or it could

[21:06] be a shield.

[21:07] If it's a shield that saves you from other attacks and it also saves you from losing your

[21:13] speed when you drain.

[21:15] If you get something like a blockade, then if you hit the launch button, it plays it

[21:20] against the guy who's in the lead.

[21:23] Another opponent will have this blockade happen to him.

[21:27] That blockade in Cosmic Car Racing is it raises two of the physical scoops on their playfield

[21:32] to block physical shots.

[21:35] That's cool.

[21:36] If he were to play a shield power up, it would immediately lower them and let them proceed.

[21:41] The EMP power up will zap him and spin him out, make him lose the speed and a speed boost

[21:48] is obviously it just accelerates you.

[21:50] If you hit the launch button, you'll play it against the guy who's in the lead or you

[21:54] can specifically aim the pinball at the left side targets to play it against the guy

[21:59] to your left, the right side targets to play against the guy to your right or the top

[22:04] stand-up targets will play it against the guy on the track opposite of you.

[22:08] This is cool.

[22:09] You got to send these to the top streamers.

[22:13] Is that in your marketing strategy, Jerry?

[22:15] Get Jack Danger to play one versus someone else in the streaming world versus maybe straight

[22:20] down the middle.

[22:22] How are you going to show people this?

[22:24] Yeah.

[22:25] Certainly streaming is a big part of our marketing plans going forward.

[22:28] Getting them to people is of course expensive and has a lot of demands on us, but yeah, that's

[22:35] the goal.

[22:36] Ultimately, we hope to get to the point where all these guys have P3s anyway because

[22:39] we'll have so many games coming out for them, but yeah, we have a short-term problem

[22:42] for sure that we need to solve.

[22:44] Well, the good news is you're not spending any money traveling to pinball shows this

[22:48] year.

[22:49] That is true.

[22:50] And you know how many people are spending money buying new luxury items?

[22:53] Is it our sales up?

[22:55] Yeah.

[22:56] Sales were great at the beginning of this obviously because of the release of Heist, which

[23:00] did a lot better than even we had predicted, but I mean, everyone knows what's going on

[23:04] right now and people aren't spending a lot of money.

[23:06] So we're looking forward to things getting back to normal so we can ramp up marketing again

[23:10] and get the sales train going.

[23:14] How so how has production been for you guys?

[23:16] I know a lot of places have had to shut down.

[23:20] What's it been like for P3 multi-morphic?

[23:22] So we didn't completely stop though we did like most counties, all counties in Texas.

[23:29] We had to basically shut down our factory presence.

[23:33] So we haven't been going into the shop until recently, but we were able to transition a

[23:39] lot of our play field building from the factory to people's houses because the play fields

[23:44] are so small for the P3.

[23:45] They're about a two foot by two foot area.

[23:48] We were able to have some of our technicians actually doing assembly in their homes.

[23:53] So we've obviously been building them a lot slower, taking a lot longer than we otherwise

[23:58] would to ship them.

[23:59] We have been progressing.

[24:01] We have a bit of a back order list still on Heist that we're working through.

[24:05] And in the next couple of weeks we'll have a few more people in the factory with strict

[24:10] isolation measures in place, but they'll be building machines.

[24:15] Hopefully a little more faster.

[24:16] How do you think Pimball is going to come out of this?

[24:19] I know there's no one really knows for sure, but what are your thoughts?

[24:22] Yeah, I don't know.

[24:24] I mean, everyone says the world's changing.

[24:27] We're all going online and we're all learning the value of video conferencing and working

[24:33] from home and all that.

[24:34] But I suspect mostly it'll just be back to normal.

[24:38] It's going to take a little while and we're going to see if we're jumping back into things

[24:42] too early and what fallout there is from people potentially stopping isolation and getting

[24:49] sick.

[24:50] Again, we'll see hopefully that doesn't happen.

[24:51] But I mean, any company that survives this in the Pimball world, I think they'll pretty

[24:56] much be back to normal operating procedure.

[25:00] The question is how many of the companies have enough cash to survive?

[25:04] Yeah.

[25:05] And also, the customer base is going to shrink up for the short term as operators and

[25:11] location play might be the last to return to normal.

[25:15] That's a good point.

[25:16] I agree with that.

[25:17] The consumers who are the bread and butter of our customer base are probably more likely

[25:22] to buy games in the short term than locations.

[25:24] So I think I heard the same thing you did that locations, arcade type locations are in

[25:30] the last phase of reopening in most states.

[25:32] And not only that, I think they're going to be the last place.

[25:36] People are going to visit.

[25:37] I mean, if you're trying to slowly get back to life as you knew it and you're making

[25:43] a decision of where do I want to apply my time and where do I feel safe and playing a

[25:48] Pimball machine in a barn which strangers are playing it.

[25:52] I don't care how much you wipe it down.

[25:53] I just don't think that behavior is going to return nearly to the level it was before.

[26:00] And the precautions people need to take, wearing a mask and doing this.

[26:04] I don't know if it's going to be worth the hassle, but playing in your house where it's

[26:08] completely safe for the most part, I think you're going to see home ownership, which

[26:13] will benefit you, Jerry, because I'm assuming most P3 multi-mortem or big soul to date are

[26:18] to the home user.

[26:19] The large majority of them, yes, we do have good packages for locations, but yeah, most

[26:24] people see the value of it more from a consumer perspective where you buy that one machine

[26:28] and you can build up a game library.

[26:30] And I agree with you generally speaking, but at the same time you go out or you look around

[26:35] or you wipe the news.

[26:37] And no matter where you're looking, people are ignoring suggestions to isolate and wear

[26:42] masks and all that.

[26:43] So I suspect there will be a large percentage of the population that's like, we're

[26:47] open back up.

[26:48] Let's go out.

[26:49] I think it's going to have negative impact on what we're trying to do, but we'll see

[26:53] what happens.

[26:54] I mean, it's everyone's got an opinion.

[26:56] Jerry, let me ask about the fact that this is built into the P3 multi-mortem orific

[27:01] system, which runs on P-Rock, correct?

[27:04] Yes.

[27:05] So now that you've developed this, is this applicable to other manufacturers that use the

[27:12] P-Rock system to start to think about implementing online play?

[27:17] So the answer is generally yes, but not for the reasons you think.

[27:22] We've developed a software system that runs on top of our hardware, the P-Rock system,

[27:27] but the software system doesn't necessarily care that you're running P-Rock or any other

[27:31] hardware.

[27:32] It just cares that you're running a computer that can process these applications or these

[27:36] specific networking libraries.

[27:38] So we've developed a framework that certainly other P3 game developers can have because

[27:43] they're building games directly on top of our framework.

[27:46] But we've also written these things in such a way that it's very easy or it would be

[27:50] very easy for any other manufacturer to write games to interface to it, to leverage our

[27:56] servers, to leverage our networking infrastructure.

[28:00] So if they want to reinvent the wheel and do everything themselves, they can or we can

[28:04] all work together and build up a cohesive and well-defined networking solution for everybody

[28:10] really.

[28:11] Okay.

[28:12] So that's a huge thing right there because I want to unwrap this.

[28:15] Because basically what you guys have been working on could help Stern, it could help Jersey

[28:20] Jack Pimball, it could help Chicago gaming company think about bringing their games online.

[28:25] Is that correct the way the software works?

[28:28] Yes, that is correct.

[28:29] Now let's fire side talk candidly, Jerry.

[28:33] Is this maybe one of the end games for you is to build the engine that these companies

[28:42] could tap into from a software standpoint.

[28:45] I know you've been so focused on software and hardware with the platform.

[28:50] How driven are you to get other manufacturers to maybe think about the software you've

[28:56] just created to bring those titles online?

[28:58] So I don't think of it in terms of software and hardware.

[29:01] I more think of it relative to features.

[29:05] We have a set of features, some of them are hardware features, some of them are software

[29:09] features.

[29:10] Some of them together along with our intellectual property, the patents and stuff we've had

[29:16] approved for the things we've done on the P3.

[29:18] All these things are features that could help other manufacturers.

[29:23] Certainly, we're always looking for ways to bring in revenue and if it makes more sense

[29:28] to help another manufacturer along their product development cycle and that brings us more

[29:34] revenue and it helps them, then it's a win-win.

[29:37] Obviously, we're not going to give away the stuff for free.

[29:39] We're not going to help people compete with us if that hurts us.

[29:42] We're always looking for win-win scenarios.

[29:45] I'm a big fan of if we can help you make money and it makes us money, then we're doing something

[29:50] good.

[29:51] If what we're doing is going to screw us or screw you, then we shouldn't do it together.

[29:55] The next question I have, that being said, the doors open for you to talk to other manufacturers,

[30:03] are you proactively knocking on their doors and showcasing this technology and proprietary

[30:10] stuff to them?

[30:11] Yes and no.

[30:12] Of course, we commonly talk to most of the manufacturers about technology and about developments, but there's

[30:19] also this industry is known for.

[30:23] Let's just say not the friendliest IP relationships in the world where a lot of companies in the past

[30:28] have made themselves based on theft of IP from other companies.

[30:34] There's a lot of interesting parts of these conversations, but yeah, we've talked to

[30:40] most of the manufacturers.

[30:41] You're going to drop a bomb like that.

[30:44] You know, Canadian is going to want to ask you, can you share any examples in which IP

[30:50] has been stolen?

[30:51] I'll give you one that I saw being debated on the forums was when Mike from Homepin seemingly

[30:58] stole Ben Hex design.

[31:01] Anything else that you're comfortable saying?

[31:04] Yeah, no, it's more of the history of pinball is full of examples, but I mean, the biggest

[31:09] one that I see often is just like the data east circuit boards are the exact same thing

[31:17] as the William system 11.

[31:19] Okay, so Stern, Stern, when they were data east, Jack, the Williams boards.

[31:24] I don't know who did who.

[31:26] Someone did it.

[31:28] Yeah, those boards are basically the same.

[31:29] There's an interface board, someone developed to interface to a p-rock, a p-rock to a system

[31:33] 11 game and it works for dead east games as well because it's the exact same board.

[31:38] So yeah, there's a lot of examples.

[31:40] There's also a lot of how should I say and not invent in here syndrome in this industry.

[31:47] I've talked to a lot of people over the years.

[31:49] We could have helped a lot of manufacturers get up going a lot quicker for a lot cheaper

[31:54] and be a lot more successful if they had allowed us to help them get started by using the

[31:59] p-rock or by using some of our software frameworks or those kind of things.

[32:03] But there are a lot of people in this industry who sometimes it's a good reason that you

[32:07] want to own all your IP and house and other times is simply that I think I can do something

[32:11] better than you therefore I'm going to prove it and oops, I just took five years to do

[32:15] it, but now I have it.

[32:17] All right.

[32:18] All right.

[32:19] Well, so the other company in Texas is deep root and have you ever talked to them?

[32:24] I mean, you guys are both in the same state.

[32:27] They're seemingly taking a very long time to get anything off the ground.

[32:31] I don't know too much of what's going on there.

[32:34] Robert and I had a bunch of discussions a couple years ago, but for the last couple years,

[32:40] they've pretty well separated from those kind of discussions.

[32:44] Okay.

[32:45] Now, Joe, you're smart guy.

[32:46] You're an engineer.

[32:47] You work on board sets.

[32:48] You work on software.

[32:50] I'm always contemplating on the show whether or not the quality goes into the engineering

[32:56] of these games in terms of the other manufacturers out there.

[33:01] Who's engineering are you most impressed by if you were to say like, well, they're pushing

[33:06] it.

[33:07] They're innovating.

[33:08] If it wasn't P3, multi-morpick, who else do you think has raised the game in Pimbal?

[33:13] I loaded question that I'm not going to answer directly, but generally speaking, and

[33:19] I know I read Facebook posts and Pinside posts all the time where people are talking about

[33:24] innovation and what games are innovative and who's been innovating.

[33:27] I say the same thing in all of my seminars.

[33:30] I ask people, point blank, name me an innovation in the last 20 or 30 years in Pimbal.

[33:37] The answer is always LEDs.

[33:41] LEDs, displays.

[33:43] We have high-death displays now.

[33:44] We had LEDs.

[33:46] Now we do RGB LEDs.

[33:48] That's always the answer.

[33:49] When I push and I push and I push, I ask again and again, and no one can ever name me

[33:53] what I think is a real innovation.

[33:55] The answer is unfortunately, or fortunately for us, is I think no one's really innovating.

[34:03] On the flip side, they're all coming out with really great content.

[34:06] Obviously, they're playing to licensed themes and doing all those things that interest

[34:10] the consumers a lot more than just technology does.

[34:13] There's really no motivation for a company like Stern to innovate if people are buying

[34:19] their games.

[34:20] I would say that if you were to look at the Pimbal landscape, let's say over the last

[34:24] 10 years, the number one innovation, maybe other than lights, would most likely be the LCD

[34:30] screen.

[34:31] Okay.

[34:32] Do you consider that an innovation, what Jersey Jack brought to Pimbal with that screen?

[34:38] I don't because to me an LCD is just more dodge than a DMD.

[34:43] It's the exact same thing.

[34:45] The same thing.

[34:46] It's the exact same thing.

[34:49] It images an image.

[34:51] Yeah, sure.

[34:52] It gives you a little more information.

[34:53] It can improve the experience for you, sure, because it can give you movie clips or more

[34:58] detail animations or whatever.

[35:00] It can give you more fonts and more scores and more stuff.

[35:04] But yeah, it's just more information.

[35:06] The transition between an alpha numeric display to a DMD did the same thing.

[35:09] It gave you more information.

[35:11] Was that an innovation?

[35:12] I don't know.

[35:13] Through that lens, you could possibly argue that a screen as a play field is simply just

[35:20] more information on the play field.

[35:23] You could until you add interactivity to that play field where the ball physically rolls

[35:28] over a graphic and the graphic blows up because the system detected the ball there.

[35:32] So yeah, I wouldn't say that having a play field display is necessarily an innovation.

[35:37] I would say that having an interactive one is how much do you think Pimbal needs to

[35:42] innovate?

[35:43] And we've talked about this before, right?

[35:45] Because obviously P3 Multimorphic is on a mission to innovate and experiment with new ways

[35:51] to enjoy this hobby.

[35:53] Stern Pimbal, Jersey Jack, for the most part, every other Pimbal company out there, Jerry,

[35:57] has pretty much been doing it the way it's been done in the past, right?

[36:00] And two varying degrees of sales success.

[36:04] And so do you think that this internet connectivity, we've got Heist, which is push the envelope,

[36:12] and I think the best possible way for your platform.

[36:16] Are you, how are you going to get customers on board?

[36:19] You've got a lot of differentiators now.

[36:22] Are you hopeful now that this is the platform and it's only going to get better from here

[36:28] and the stuff now is worth jumping into?

[36:31] This is the one.

[36:32] This is the feature.

[36:33] I mean, that's always the hope, right?

[36:35] All I can do is continue to add value to owning a P3.

[36:43] As long as people compare the newest game or any game to their favorite other game,

[36:50] then to me, they're comparing apples and oranges, but we lose that comparison because they

[36:55] have their favorite theme from somebody else that has an emotional attachment and they'd

[36:59] rather play that than some original new theme from a new manufacturer with new hardware

[37:05] that costs $10,000.

[37:07] When they start to realize that $10,000 machine, it can have multiple games or does have multiple

[37:13] games.

[37:14] It has multiple features.

[37:15] It has internet connectivity.

[37:16] It has this ball tracking.

[37:17] It has these scoops that has all these features that you can't do on traditional games.

[37:22] And you can add more content to it for $1,000 or $300 or the new Heist for $2,700.

[37:29] It's more value that you can attach to that game.

[37:32] At some point, it becomes an absolute no-brainer.

[37:35] Clearly, we're not at that point yet because people are still choosing other games before

[37:41] the P3.

[37:42] But that will change.

[37:43] Did you ever get frustrated when you see just the same formula, the Rinse and Repeat,

[37:48] license theme, pro premium Ellie onto the next, incomplete software.

[37:54] Wait for two years before the game is done.

[37:56] How do you make you, does it keep you up at night watching the same cycle, just inundate

[38:04] the hobby?

[38:05] This is like, I'm on your couch today.

[38:08] Yeah, of course, it frustrates me, but I can't fault people for wanting what they want.

[38:15] If there are customers that just want the next best theme and there's some that want the

[38:19] pro version of it because they want to spend $5,000 or $6,000 or some that want all the

[38:25] bells and whistles for $11 or $12 or $15,000.

[38:29] I can't fault people for wanting what they want.

[38:32] My goal in you and I've talked about this before, I don't develop things because I think

[38:37] there what other people want.

[38:38] I develop things that excite me and I'm building games that excite me and I've learned

[38:44] along the way that there are a lot of people that like what I like and there are a lot of

[38:48] people that don't like what I like.

[38:50] So hopefully, as we continue to add features and game content and new ideas to this thing,

[38:56] more of those people that don't like what I like will start to see more value in the P3

[39:00] and come over.

[39:01] But yeah, of course, it's frustrating that we haven't.

[39:05] I mean, I obviously feel like the P3 has a ton to offer people and my marketing spills,

[39:11] my seminars explain all the reasons I think it makes more sense to buy a P3 than a traditional

[39:18] game with the big exception of the theme.

[39:21] Obviously, one of the hurdles is price and 10K is a lot, but the whole market's gone

[39:27] upstream with pricing and no longer seems like an insane amount of money anymore.

[39:33] I mean, this is pretty much, you can option out a Rick and Morty for around $10,000

[39:38] now.

[39:39] So we're not talking like this like, supernal realm of pricing anymore.

[39:44] But to get a customer base up, Jerry, have you guys explored ever trying to move the

[39:50] price down, even if it's for a little bit of a loss to get into market more?

[39:55] And that happened or is it just not financially feasible?

[39:57] Yeah, that's a tough financial challenge.

[40:00] When you're comparing to video game consoles, you're usually talking about a company like

[40:03] Microsoft or Sony who has billions of dollars backing them and they can afford to take

[40:10] a gamble for a couple of years selling something in a loss in the hopes that they'll develop

[40:14] a user base and make all that money back by selling the higher profit margin games.

[40:21] We're a bootstrapped company still where we found it in 2012, so we're about eight years

[40:26] into this thing.

[40:27] And we've spent less in total R&D.

[40:32] I've probably signed fewer checks than most companies sign to develop a single game.

[40:39] So we've built this company on the backs of people's, you know, their passions and their

[40:43] desire to help and their desire to see this cool machine come to fruition.

[40:48] So we don't have the budget to be able to afford to buy parts if we were selling them

[40:52] at a loss.

[40:54] And what we do have is people who are willing to help us for a lot less than they'd be

[40:59] making at another company.

[41:01] And usually that's because they have day jobs and they're helping us in nights and weekends.

[41:06] So they're willing to work for basically free.

[41:08] I'm basically still working for free.

[41:10] We have a small payroll and then we have, then we're able to, you know, buy parts with

[41:16] the revenue that we make on the previous set of parts.

[41:19] So no, we couldn't afford to, you know, build 200 P3s in sell them at a $2,000 loss of

[41:25] piece, hoping to get them out there.

[41:27] And then we recover that money later.

[41:29] The only way to do that is to have backing, to have investors backing us.

[41:33] It must feel good to be a part of pinball history.

[41:36] I mean, you've developed something that I'm shocked that we don't have more internet-connected

[41:42] games by now.

[41:43] Are you shocked?

[41:45] I'm always like, I don't understand why people don't see the potential in this.

[41:49] No, no, no.

[41:50] I'm not shocked.

[41:51] I think you're right.

[41:52] The potential you see in it is cool.

[41:54] It's going to be super fun.

[41:56] It is not going to make another company a lot more money than what they're making today.

[42:00] But you know what it does do?

[42:01] And here's the thing that this is why I think pinball as all of these people harp about,

[42:07] we need to make pinball more attractive to the next generation.

[42:10] We need to get kids in the pinball.

[42:11] I'll tell you right now.

[42:13] 99% of the pinball games I play at a show are not for kids.

[42:17] Kids won't find them fun.

[42:18] They're overly complex.

[42:19] They're confusing.

[42:21] When I play heads up, every kid can jump on that and have fun.

[42:24] And I've always said that to you, Jerry.

[42:26] I mean, I really feel like P3 is probably the only system that is approachable for a younger

[42:32] audience.

[42:33] And yeah, it's actually amazing how kids walk up to it and they seem to understand what

[42:37] to do it even though it is pinball that they're not familiar with.

[42:39] I don't quite understand the dynamic there.

[42:41] But kids love stranger things.

[42:42] They could walk up to a stranger things game and they ain't going to know what to do.

[42:47] And so the other thing that kids are used to is internet play.

[42:51] See, I think you're right though.

[42:53] I don't think Stern cares.

[42:54] I think Stern's got their target audience as 40 to 60 year old men who like these themes

[42:59] and understand the principles of the game and just keep going down that road.

[43:05] But if you have younger people and you have a family and you want to make something that

[43:09] everyone can jump on.

[43:11] I think the games that you have in the arsenal, Jerry, are probably the most approachable

[43:17] and pinball.

[43:18] And I mean that.

[43:19] Thank you for that.

[43:20] They're also the most diverse.

[43:21] So we hope to be giving that pinhead father or pinball owner that the experiences they

[43:27] want with Heist or Lexi light speed and then games like Ken and Lagoon and heads up and

[43:32] all these other games are more breadth and more variety that they can get their kids playing

[43:38] and their spouse is playing and their friends playing and all those things.

[43:40] So as a product, the P3 seems to make a lot more value sense.

[43:48] But if somebody just wants a particular theme then we're never going to win that battle.

[43:51] Well, it's good to have variety and ladies and gentlemen, we want to congratulate Jerry

[43:56] on being the first to bring this to market and it's real internet play.

[44:00] This isn't just like a leader board.

[44:02] I know some games have done that but this is your playing against someone in real time.

[44:07] So Jerry, congratulations on bringing this to pinball.

[44:09] But thanks Chris, always a pleasure.

[44:10] All right Jerry, have a good night.

[44:12] Take care.
