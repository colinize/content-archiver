[00:00] Go, Johnny Go, Go!

[00:02] Go!

[00:03] Johnny Begoo!

[00:10] Alright, Kaneda's got one COVID shot down, one to go, and I will be fully vaccinated with

[00:16] anti-bodies ready to talk to you about Pimbal.

[00:20] Now I will say this, I hope everybody gets vaccinated, it's the fastest way to get back to

[00:26] the life we love and the shows we love, okay?

[00:28] Don't be like the fools down there in the Texas Ranger Stadium packing themselves in

[00:33] before most of those people are even vaccinated.

[00:35] But I will say this, the vaccine knocks you out, I had the Moderna on Monday and I feel

[00:41] like a ton of bricks was dropped on top of me and I was just so tired, I'm still tired,

[00:48] it's Wednesday morning and here's the thing though, please get vaccinated, I think everyone

[00:52] needs to do their part.

[00:53] Okay, what's happened in the last week?

[00:56] So this has been really funny, Pinside has been down now for a few days and what a glorious

[01:03] few days it has been because now all of you out there who love Pimbal, I think you're

[01:09] realizing when this site goes down, I think you're learning two things, I think you're

[01:13] learning how important Pinside is to the momentum and actually caring about this hobby, for

[01:20] so many of you out there who are listening to this show, you go on to Pinside every day

[01:25] and you see what's going on in the Pimbal world, when that gets shut down, I think there

[01:30] are pros and cons to a site like that being removed from the internet for a few days as

[01:36] they're dealing with a fire in their data, something network sort of room, I don't know

[01:42] what's going on over there.

[01:43] Now some people have accused Canada or Robert Mueller of setting this fire, so if there were

[01:49] two people in the world that wanted to see Pinside burn, it would be Canada and Robert

[01:54] Mueller, I'm here to tell you I did not set the fire over at Pinside, but here's what

[01:59] happens when that site goes down, I think we lose our connection to so many people, so

[02:05] many conversations, both good and bad, I think it's very refreshing when that site goes down

[02:12] because a lot of people who are keyboard warriors who spend all day on there hijacking every

[02:18] thread, they can't stop talking about Pimbal on Pinside, it's good for these people to

[02:23] go walk in the park, understand there's more to life than sitting on the toilet arguing

[02:28] about deep root and whether or not they're going to get games out, it's good not to jump

[02:33] into every Led Zeppelin thread and say what a piece of crap the game is, and just live

[02:38] your life, but the biggest part people miss when a site like Pinside goes down is access

[02:43] to others in the community, mostly for help and support, I think that is the main value

[02:48] proposition of Pinside, you have a problem in your game, your left flipper on Rick and

[02:53] Morty might be acting up, or your diverter and guns and roses might be acting wonky, or

[02:58] you need to know this or that, or you have a problem, and you can go to Pinside at any

[03:02] hour of the night during any day of the week and you will get a response from someone in

[03:07] the community who probably could help you out, so that's a good thing.

[03:11] Now I did put up the great Canadian Pinside Derby on my Facebook page just to show you something

[03:17] that I've been thinking about, and that is this, there are a few hyperposters on Pinside

[03:23] who are responsible for the majority of the conversation, so leading the pack with 54,000

[03:32] and something post is Odin, and I did a little summary, if he had spent just two minutes

[03:38] thinking about each thing he posted and thinking about what he was about to write, he would

[03:42] have wasted 75 days of his life, 75 days of his life, he's spent posting on Pinside, I'm

[03:50] going to talk a little bit about this on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast because

[03:53] I do think Pinside going down causes some people to reflect about the amount of time and

[03:59] energy and money you're pumping into this hobby, and when this thing goes down I think

[04:05] it does make some people step back and reflect, what am I doing?

[04:09] Am I spending way too much time arguing with these fools on the internet?

[04:13] Why am I doing this?

[04:14] Is there any real value in this?

[04:16] And I'm going to give you some conclusions that I've been thinking about over the last

[04:19] couple of weeks as I've had a new baby, as I've seen Pinside go down, as I've seen these

[04:25] prices skyrocket in this hobby.

[04:27] I don't know how anyone who's in the Pimball has not had a moment of reflection over the

[04:32] last month.

[04:33] This hobby is going in a direction in which I'm not sure that I want to be on this train.

[04:40] If this train's going to keep going in this direction, we'll talk a little bit about

[04:43] that.

[04:44] I also found it interesting because when people say life was better in the 80s and the 90s,

[04:49] right, we all are very nostalgic for that period of time in our lives when we were growing

[04:53] up in the 80s and 90s and for many of us going to the arcade and the arcade experience

[05:00] in which we played so many iconic games that we love, not just all those Bally Williams

[05:05] games from the 90s in Pimball, but you know who I'm talking about.

[05:08] You Street Fighter fans out there, you Mortal Kombat fans out there, you Donkey Kong fans

[05:13] out there, you Pac-Man fans out there.

[05:15] We used to go into an arcade.

[05:17] Think about this time.

[05:18] And when a new game came out, there was no internet, there was no like release date for

[05:23] any of these games.

[05:24] You walked into an arcade and there it was.

[05:28] The new game that you couldn't wait to put your quarters into.

[05:31] The other thing that happened is you played the game and you either liked it or didn't

[05:36] like it.

[05:37] Now your expectations were much more likely to be entertained by these things.

[05:42] You know why?

[05:44] Because there was no internet.

[05:45] There were no YouTube and TikTok, Jackass is telling you what a piece of crap this game

[05:50] was, right?

[05:51] There was no early reviews from people who went to the arcade show and played it already.

[05:56] We had an open mind back then.

[05:59] And if there's one thing I miss about my childhood, about growing up in that period of time,

[06:04] we had an imagination and we let stuff in.

[06:08] Like we actually saw stuff and let it in without having all of this outside noise, constantly

[06:14] telling us what to think about stuff.

[06:17] Ding ding ding.

[06:18] Outside noise like Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[06:21] I mean, how many of you out there have had a hard time enjoying or even thinking about

[06:26] Willy Wonka because of Kaneda berating the game over and over and over again?

[06:31] And I'm also part of that problem we all are.

[06:34] Like everyone wants to have an opinion about this stuff and by the time you step up to

[06:39] things in the modern world, your opinion about them has already been forged.

[06:45] And that is not the best way to experience this stuff.

[06:50] But the other part is this, when we went on those games and we played them, if we didn't

[06:54] enjoy them and they were not great, there was no way to tell people, don't put your

[06:58] quarters in this machine, it's terrible.

[07:00] Stay away from major havoc, it's horrible.

[07:03] Stay away from this game, it's not very good.

[07:05] You know, we didn't play these Bally Williams games and go to the internet and complain about

[07:09] the lack of code.

[07:11] Nobody had these machines in their homes, they just went out and enjoyed them.

[07:15] And so when Pinside goes down, imagine a world in which there is no Pinside.

[07:20] Just think about that for a minute.

[07:21] Let's close our eyes and think about a world in which there is no Pinside.

[07:26] And how much different, how much different this hobby would be for so many of you out there

[07:32] who need it, who need it to be interested in this hobby day in and day out.

[07:37] I think Pinside does a great job of getting people into this hobby.

[07:41] But I also think Pinside does a great job of placing too much importance on Pimball into

[07:48] people's lives.

[07:49] And I mean it.

[07:50] And I see people and I see how addictive it can be to be in a community like Pinside,

[07:55] in which your persona on that site actually brings you more enjoyment.

[08:01] And you might even have more attention, more clout, and more power, and more relevance

[08:07] on Pinside than you do in your own personal life.

[08:11] That people know who you are more on Pinside than at your own company.

[08:15] But you might have more of a relationship there than you do with your own wife and kids.

[08:19] And then you see these guys clearly, many of them are held up somewhere and all they

[08:24] can think about all day long is Pimball.

[08:26] And I'm not here to shame those people.

[08:28] I mean maybe you need outlets.

[08:30] We all need outlets in life to sort of get through the day.

[08:33] But there's something about if this site went down, we would not live in a world where

[08:38] pirates of the Caribbean would sell for $38,000.

[08:41] We would not have all this frenzy to get this stuff.

[08:44] There is something I'm learning more and more.

[08:46] And maybe this is just me because I'm a parent and I'm looking at the world these days

[08:50] and I'm watching NFT artwork sell for this.

[08:53] I'm watching Jared hype up Ninja Turtle toys.

[08:55] I'm going to talk about that next because I'm just I'm kind of at the point now and I

[09:00] know I'm the ultimate height man.

[09:02] I'm at the point now where it's almost like there's too much of it.

[09:06] There's too much of us saying everything is going to be the next greatest thing on the

[09:11] planet.

[09:12] The next pinball machine is going to be the one you're really going to want.

[09:15] Oh my god, if they never make pirates of the Caribbean again, you have to get it because

[09:20] if you don't get your hands on it, your life will be incomplete.

[09:24] I'm here to tell you right now for $38,000 for $30,000 for $20,000.

[09:32] You could take a first class trip to Japan and have the most amazing time in your life

[09:37] that you will never forget.

[09:39] I would rather go to Japan.

[09:41] I would rather go to Tokyo and play in those arcades and eat great sushi and see the

[09:47] sights and learn about a new culture and travel around that countryside for two weeks

[09:52] than own a pirates of the Caribbean.

[09:54] I would trade all of my rare Neo Geocabments for another trip to Tokyo.

[10:00] This notion that once we buy these things, we are somehow going to feel better about

[10:05] ourselves that this stuff is going to make us happier.

[10:08] It's bogus.

[10:09] And those rich guys who are doing it, you know this and I know this.

[10:13] It's not making them any happier.

[10:15] It's not making them any more satisfied.

[10:17] Now, a lot of these gentlemen are very happy to begin with.

[10:20] Don't get me wrong.

[10:21] When you are wealthy and you are rich and you have a lot of money and you can burn money

[10:24] on $30,000 Pimal machines and you can order alleys and CE's without even thinking twice.

[10:30] Good for you.

[10:31] And if you deserved it and you worked hard and you're proud of what you produced in this

[10:34] world, good for you.

[10:36] I will never be some crazy socialists who says we need to come and take from those people

[10:41] they're enjoyment.

[10:42] We need to take from them the profit that they made off of their productivity and life

[10:46] absolutely not.

[10:47] The whole reason we live is work gives life meaning and you need to feel good about what

[10:51] you produce in this world.

[10:52] If you do not feel good about what you produce in this world, you will not feel any better

[10:56] because you stuck a Pimbal machine into your studio apartment and now a third of your

[11:01] net worth lies inside a Pimbal machine.

[11:03] That's not how you're supposed to live and we need more people to tell these people

[11:07] not to do that.

[11:08] Okay, but this height train, this phomo, this fear that if you don't get this machine now,

[11:14] somehow your life is going to be incomplete.

[11:15] It's stupid.

[11:16] Let me read you.

[11:17] Jared's post on this Ninja Turtle Stern collaboration that I saw.

[11:21] This is so representative of the modern world of the social media influencers and the way

[11:28] they want us to think about all this stuff that we don't need.

[11:32] Okay, it's just going to be another item you put on your shelf.

[11:35] It's a toy in which you're not going to want to open the box because if you open the

[11:39] box, you're not going to have any value left in the item.

[11:43] So it's a toy you can't play with.

[11:45] How stupid is that?

[11:46] Did you see the Super Mario Brother game that sold for $666,000?

[11:52] Simply because two things.

[11:53] It was put in a desk drawer 35 years ago as a gift and was never taken out.

[11:59] Okay.

[12:00] And part-wise worth so much money.

[12:02] It's not just that.

[12:03] This was a unique variation of the game in which it was made with a special shrink wrap

[12:11] and the box had like a sticker on it that they didn't put on every single copy.

[12:16] Just some random nonsense thing that happened as they were making millions of these games.

[12:23] There was a variation in the shrink wrap of the game on the box.

[12:28] And now it's worth $666,000.

[12:31] It's stupid.

[12:32] It's stupid.

[12:33] This is the problem with where everything is going is we've almost lost touch with what's

[12:38] important in life.

[12:39] And I'm telling you, the things that are important in life are experiences over possessions.

[12:44] And I know it's weird to say that on a pinball podcast is all of you are listening, being

[12:47] like, is Canada on like some sort of like medication right now?

[12:50] I'm not.

[12:51] I'm not.

[12:52] And I definitely think we all should own some pinball machines if we love pinball.

[12:56] Don't get me wrong.

[12:57] But man, we should not be spending two to three times with pinball machines are worth.

[13:00] But let me read you the Stern pinball and teenage mutant Ninja Turtle toy collection.

[13:07] So Jared says, let me tell you how proud I am and how amazing this is.

[13:12] What you're seeing here is the NECA time Stern pinball teenage mutant Ninja Turtle collectors

[13:19] box coming exclusively to Walmart.

[13:22] Let's just stop right there.

[13:23] You know, nothing, nothing that will ever bring you true happiness and joy in life is found

[13:30] at Walmart.

[13:32] Nothing worth collecting.

[13:34] Nothing truly valuable is found exclusively at Walmart.

[13:39] People he then goes on to say the artwork was done by long time Stern pinball collaborator

[13:44] Jeremy Packer, aka zombie Eddie studios and was first featured on the 2020 pinball machine

[13:51] release.

[13:52] But now has been reformatted for actual toy packaging, a t-shirt, a beanie, keychain and

[13:58] magnet exclamation point.

[14:00] Now here's the part.

[14:01] This is the part.

[14:02] This is the world we live in.

[14:04] This is the world we live in.

[14:05] You gotta go in and get Ethereum.

[14:06] You gotta go in and get Bitcoin.

[14:08] You gotta go in and get these NFTs.

[14:09] You gotta go in and get this Super Mario game.

[14:11] You gotta buy the Dittombraiti rookie card for two times what it sold for last year.

[14:15] You gotta have all this stuff.

[14:17] If you don't have this stuff, your life is incomplete.

[14:19] And then he goes on to say for toy collectors, this will be a must have item because of the

[14:24] exclusivity and rarity.

[14:27] Okay, let's break this down.

[14:29] It's 2021 Jarrett.

[14:30] Who the hell needs an Ninja Turtles toy that was built this year on their shop?

[14:35] Who?

[14:36] There's no story.

[14:37] This is in part of the Ninja Turtle world we grew up with.

[14:40] It's just a new toy.

[14:41] And I don't even know what's different about it other than the fact that it has Stern's

[14:44] artwork on the box.

[14:46] He then goes on the right for TMNT lovers.

[14:49] This will be a must have item because of the collectibility and art, the collectibility

[14:55] and art.

[14:56] Let me tell you something Jarrett.

[14:57] Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a property for kids.

[15:02] It's a property for kids to enjoy, to use their imagination to want to be the Ninja Turtles.

[15:08] Now the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property is something for collecting what happened

[15:13] to the world.

[15:15] We used to wake up and enjoy this stuff.

[15:18] We used to rip open these boxes.

[15:21] We used to play these games.

[15:22] We used to bend these toys.

[15:24] We used to hurl shredder across the room at our brothers.

[15:27] We used to not give a crap about any of this.

[15:31] Now here we are.

[15:32] It's a must have because of its collectibility.

[15:35] What the heck happened?

[15:37] All right.

[15:38] I'm just being a little bit sarcastic.

[15:39] I know Jarrett lives in this world of grown men who collect these toys.

[15:43] I know he's always at the Dallas store that has all those toys and his room is filled

[15:48] with toys.

[15:49] I used to be one of those men.

[15:50] I used to be one of those grown adults who collected transformers.

[15:53] Guess what I did?

[15:55] I sold my transformer collection for $35,000.

[15:59] The reason why I sold it.

[16:01] I just got tired of walking by these toys, seeing them on a shelf.

[16:06] I never opened them.

[16:08] I was just OCD paranoid about the condition of the boxes.

[16:12] That was it.

[16:13] That was the only thing.

[16:15] And the more I looked at them, I'm like, you know what?

[16:17] I enjoyed these when I was a kid.

[16:19] I will never be able to relive the magic of walking into toys or us.

[16:24] And there was an entire aisle of transformer toys.

[16:27] And trying to relive that as a grown adult, maybe it's easier just to like live with those

[16:32] memories versus trying to like hoard every single thing for my youth.

[16:37] Put them on shelves.

[16:39] And then that's it.

[16:40] They don't do anything.

[16:41] They just literally sit there.

[16:43] And then goes to say, for Pimball lovers, this will be the must have item for the connection

[16:48] to the Pimball machine and to support a beloved artist in the community.

[16:52] Let me repeat that.

[16:53] If you love Pimball, this is a must have item.

[16:56] Can we just stop right there?

[16:57] This is like, what?

[16:59] Where is this connection even happening?

[17:02] How is this a must have item if you love Pimball?

[17:04] How?

[17:05] All right.

[17:06] Because of the connection to the Pimball machine and to support a beloved artist in the community.

[17:10] We all love Zambietti.

[17:12] And here's how you support Zambietti.

[17:14] You buy his Pimball machines.

[17:16] That's why he made this artwork for a Pimball machine.

[17:18] And then it goes on to say, I love this part.

[17:20] This is like where they're like all this hype.

[17:22] I'm just getting, again, I can you tell, can it is getting a little fed up with this hype

[17:25] world we live in?

[17:27] And for Pimball itself, this is now a massive leap forward in front facing visibility

[17:33] and awareness about the Stern Pimball brand being on products on the shelf at every

[17:39] Walmart in America.

[17:41] It's just a massive collaboration and move.

[17:45] Okay.

[17:46] No, it's not.

[17:47] No, it's not, Jared.

[17:49] It's not.

[17:50] You're acting as if there are no other products in Walmart.

[17:54] Okay, let's picture this for a minute.

[17:56] You walk into Walmart and you go into the toy aisle and you see this new Ninja Turtles toy.

[18:02] Okay, you see the shredder with the box.

[18:04] It's got the Zambietti artwork on it.

[18:06] Okay, what goes on inside your head?

[18:08] When was the last time you saw a toy box and said, hey, I wonder who did the artwork?

[18:11] When was the last time you walked into a toy store and you saw the box and you saw like

[18:15] a little logo at the bottom that says Stern, just this Stern Pimball on it.

[18:19] That's it.

[18:20] There's no big connection or story on the back about how this artwork came from the

[18:23] Stern Pimball machine.

[18:24] There's no massive connection going on.

[18:27] It's just a little logo on a box.

[18:30] Nobody's gonna think about it.

[18:32] This isn't some massive way in which the Pimball sort of brand is getting out into the world.

[18:37] But this, but this is it.

[18:38] This is it.

[18:39] This is the world we live in.

[18:40] We have to buy a pie to the Caribbean for $38,000.

[18:44] This is a massive move for Pimball having a little logo on a toy box that no grown adult

[18:48] should even be looking at.

[18:50] These are toys for kids and no kid can afford a Pimball machine.

[18:53] Is a side effect of getting the vaccine cranky canada?

[18:56] Ah, man, it's just, I just really, really, really want to get back to life the way it

[19:03] used to be.

[19:04] But when we turn life back on, I really do implore all of us out there to think differently

[19:10] about how we behave a little bit coming out of COVID-19 because this internet hype world,

[19:17] these influencers who think they have influence, all of this is not what we need.

[19:22] What we need in Pimball is simple.

[19:25] We need Pimball machines that put the most magic into the game and give us what we pay

[19:31] for.

[19:32] That will always be the narrative of Canadian Pimball podcast.

[19:36] I want to get what we're paying for.

[19:38] Now I might like or not like Willie Wonka based on the gameplay, based on the theme integration,

[19:44] but if you buy a Willie Wonka for what Jersey Jack Pimball is charging you for it, you are

[19:51] getting your money's worth.

[19:52] You just are.

[19:53] There is so much more in that game, so much more quality of product, so much more bomb

[20:00] in that game than you are getting from a Stern.

[20:02] So you're getting what you pay for.

[20:04] Now with Stern machines, I think you're getting what you pay for in the pro and the premium.

[20:09] I absolutely don't think you're getting anywhere near what you're paying for in a Stern

[20:13] LE.

[20:14] They know what they're doing.

[20:15] They're doing the smart thing.

[20:17] They're getting this hype train going with these LEDs.

[20:21] The FOMO is what drives their LEDs.

[20:23] I saw this week and this was somewhat depressing.

[20:26] Now Vira Ellie, not even the signature one, in a Vira Ellie just sold for $15,000.

[20:34] $15,000.

[20:36] I think Vira Ellie was 10 grand.

[20:38] Now it's sold for the price of the version with the couch.

[20:42] So now you're telling me that the signature edition, which was limited to 50, that was

[20:47] such a cash grab piece of crap.

[20:49] You're telling me that game now is worth 20 grand?

[20:53] I probably could have sold my Batman SLE now for at least 20 to 25,000.

[20:58] I sold it for 16,000.

[21:00] And so here we are.

[21:02] Here we are.

[21:03] It's no longer about the game.

[21:04] It's no longer about the gameplay.

[21:07] It's no longer about the magic.

[21:09] It's no longer about how much people love the game.

[21:12] It's simply about having something that was shrink wrapped in the factory with a sticker

[21:18] on it that just makes it different.

[21:21] There's no reason why if you want to enjoy the Vira experience, you can have it.

[21:25] They're all the same game.

[21:26] There's no difference in the game.

[21:27] But now all of a sudden, this is become what people are doing.

[21:32] They just want rarity.

[21:34] They just want collectability.

[21:36] They just want to have something that their neighbors don't have because there's only

[21:40] a finite amount of it.

[21:42] Because there's only a finite amount of Bitcoin.

[21:44] It's now like 50 to $60,000.

[21:47] Even if there's nothing back in it, even if you can make more money in crypto in the

[21:52] last year than your entire career of working.

[21:54] It's sad.

[21:55] It's sad.

[21:56] I watched my dad work 37 years for a company working his butt off, saving his money, doing

[22:01] all this.

[22:02] And if he had simply put just 5% of his income into crypto, he would have made more than

[22:06] he did in all those years of working his ass off.

[22:09] And we're supposed to celebrate this stuff and get excited about this.

[22:14] I don't think so.

[22:15] How's that exciting to anybody?

[22:17] But that's the world we live in.

[22:18] You want to make money for nothing.

[22:20] You want to buy these things at these crazy high prices just to say you have them, just

[22:26] to say you have them.

[22:27] So who is the person you bought the new inbox prior to the Caribbean?

[22:30] Is he going to open it up and lose $10,000 immediately?

[22:34] I saw Viddy is selling his again.

[22:37] And he regretted selling this machine that he had to go get it back.

[22:42] And then he went and got it back.

[22:43] And now he's selling it again.

[22:45] And he'll regret selling it even for $30,000.

[22:49] Because as my good friend Derek tells me, he says it like this.

[22:52] It's a lot easier for me to go make $30,000.

[22:56] Then it is for me to find a pirate to the Caribbean collectors edition.

[23:00] And he's not wrong there.

[23:01] He is not wrong there.

[23:03] There are only 200 in the world.

[23:05] But this is how it starts.

[23:07] This is how the mental snowballing begins.

[23:11] And if I get these things, they are somehow going to make my life so much better.

[23:15] And look, I'm just here to tell you, like I'm just having a reflective day.

[23:18] So I just want you to think about it.

[23:19] I think Pinside being down is good because we no longer have to see these crazy prices

[23:24] for a week.

[23:25] Okay.

[23:26] So let me give you some news and rumors and what I'm looking forward to in Pimball because

[23:29] here's what excites me about Pimball.

[23:30] And here's why if you've found the first half of this podcast and I'm not going to go

[23:34] for 50 minutes.

[23:35] But if you've found what I've been saying to be a little melancholy, did it bring you

[23:39] down a little bit?

[23:40] Don't worry because here's the good news.

[23:42] The good news is this.

[23:43] There are so many good games that are going to come out and you're going to be able to buy

[23:47] them for not a penny more than the manufacturer suggests.

[23:51] And that's a good thing.

[23:52] I think all of us, and most of us are on the sidelines watching One Rich Idiot by LVYRF

[23:59] of 1500, another rich idiot buying pirates for 38,000.

[24:03] The majority of us are not these people.

[24:06] For the rest of us, we will have the most fun in this hobby because we are going to get

[24:11] a lot of new games out this year and we're going to be able to decide which games are

[24:17] the most magical, which games are giving us the most for the money.

[24:20] And here's the thing too, ladies and gentlemen, I think for many of you out there and you're

[24:24] like me, you will decide that none of these are for me.

[24:28] That I will wait.

[24:29] I will play these games at a friend's house.

[24:31] I will play these games at a show because we will be going back to Pimball shows and I

[24:36] will play these games on location and I will enjoy them, but I don't need to own them.

[24:42] That is the part that Jared doesn't want you to know or George Gomez or anyone over

[24:46] an American Pimball.

[24:48] Imagine if you woke up every day and said, I don't need to own another Pimball machine.

[24:53] Imagine trying that.

[24:54] Imagine saying, I'm happy with the way my life is right now.

[24:57] I don't need another game.

[24:59] I'm just one person.

[25:00] For many of you out there, why do you need 30, 40 games or 15 games or 10?

[25:05] For one person, you can play one game at a time.

[25:08] Yeah, I get it.

[25:09] Some of you found your games at bargain basement prices, but for those of you who are getting

[25:13] into the hobby now, trust me.

[25:16] You don't need a large collection.

[25:18] You don't need more than one or two games at a time to enjoy Pimball because you could

[25:24] have two machines that complement each other game style wise.

[25:27] You could have a gun in roses, next to an Avengers and you could be happy for the next

[25:32] six months exploring each of those games.

[25:35] That's it.

[25:36] And you wouldn't need anymore.

[25:37] Your wife wouldn't be embarrassed when she shows people the room with all the games in

[25:41] it.

[25:42] Let's face it, your friends aren't coming over that much.

[25:44] I mean, when I had an arcade, like everyone thinks, oh, I'm going to get an arcade.

[25:47] I'm a grown man and I'm going to get an arcade and everyone's going to come over and it's

[25:51] going to be like it was, no, it's not.

[25:54] Trust me.

[25:55] Nobody's coming over.

[25:56] If they do come over, they barely come over.

[25:59] Those games will barely be turned on.

[26:01] Those are going to play them.

[26:02] Your kids are going to play them.

[26:04] And for the most part, they're going to be bored of them.

[26:06] But you're never going to get, you're never going to get that moment you think you're

[26:10] going to get like it was walking into an arcade in the 80s and 90s.

[26:13] It's not going to happen.

[26:14] It's not going to happen.

[26:16] So new games are coming out.

[26:17] Now I'm going to give you some rumors right now.

[26:19] I made you wait for it.

[26:20] I made you listen to me talk about other stuff.

[26:23] Here's what I'm hearing.

[26:24] Okay.

[26:25] So Brian Eddie's game.

[26:27] I got an email yesterday and I want to just tell you exactly what this email said.

[26:33] And it said, and this is from one of my somewhat reliable sources.

[26:36] But I have now two sources that are contradicting each other.

[26:41] I have one person over here, Mr. Rare here who says he knows what Brian Eddie's next game

[26:46] is, but he won't tell me.

[26:47] Okay.

[26:48] Thank you.

[26:49] Greg, I'm so happy you know what it is and you won't tell me.

[26:53] And then I have another person who's anonymous who said the following Brian Eddie's back to

[26:59] the future is imminent or imminent.

[27:02] He said that.

[27:03] So what does that mean?

[27:04] So that means any day now, any week now Brian Eddie back to the future.

[27:09] Okay.

[27:10] How exciting.

[27:11] Would that be great?

[27:12] Awesome.

[27:13] Then I take that to Rare hero and I say, Hey, is it back to the future and he goes, that's

[27:16] not what I'm hearing.

[27:17] So take it for what it's worth.

[27:19] Do you think Brian Eddie and back to the future is going to come out from Stern Pimball?

[27:24] Now, if anyone can get as much of the back to the future license lined up and everybody

[27:30] wants Michael J. Fox, everybody wants him, but not even Joe Kamikaw was able to get him

[27:35] in the original game that came out.

[27:37] Now Joe Kamikaw is the guy that would get this for Stern.

[27:42] So do you think that Joe Kamikaw and Brian Eddie are going to make a back to the future

[27:48] game via Stern Pimball?

[27:50] It opens up a lot, a lot of excitement in a lot of you.

[27:55] Now look, we're going to find out sooner than later.

[27:57] I for some reason don't think it's going to be that if I were to guess what I think

[28:01] it's going to be, I think it's going to be mortal combat and that's my guess, but

[28:08] I don't know for sure.

[28:09] I haven't seen anything.

[28:11] Everyone is going on rumors right now.

[28:14] So is it going to be that?

[28:16] Is it going to be back to the future?

[28:18] Is it going to be something completely different?

[28:20] Who knows?

[28:21] Is it going to be Beetlejuice?

[28:22] I don't know.

[28:23] Nobody knows right now, but I did hear that it's a contemporary theme.

[28:27] So if it was back to the future, then the contemporary theme is out the window, but

[28:32] mortal combat would be a much more contemporary license because the new movie is coming out

[28:40] right now.

[28:41] And mortal comments from the 90s.

[28:43] So we'll see what happens with Brian Eddie's next game.

[28:47] It's coming soon though.

[28:48] And that's my point.

[28:49] Why would you run and buy Elvira right now when you could just wait and let's be honest.

[28:56] Elvira Ellie's are now not worth $15,000.

[28:59] Pirates of the Caribbean machines are now not worth that.

[29:02] A couple more on spending this much money is not the new price of the game.

[29:07] It's not.

[29:08] It's not.

[29:09] And what's going to happen is this, if back to the future comes out and it's great,

[29:12] it's a toy story comes out and it's great.

[29:14] If Jersey Jacket actually shipped Guns and Roses machines faster, more people would want

[29:19] them right now.

[29:20] No one wants to wait a year.

[29:21] I mean, I'm not even going to talk about this, but if you order a Guns and Roses right

[29:25] now, you're like an eight to nine month waiting time to get your game.

[29:29] Why would anyone order now?

[29:31] I would in order and you're spending $1,000 more.

[29:35] Everyone's just going to wait and buy used versions of the game because people will get

[29:39] tired of Guns and Roses and people will want to sell their machines.

[29:44] And because they raise the price, Ellie buyers who got in at the lower price are absolutely

[29:50] going to cash out and go give the game to new people.

[29:52] But every time I see a picture of the JJP line, I just don't see people making the games.

[29:57] I saw another one today.

[29:58] It's all the back boxes lined up like, why can't they take a video in the middle of

[30:03] the day when things are being made?

[30:05] So Brian Eddie back to the future, we will see.

[30:08] I saw that Chuck and Bug took a road trip and they alluded to their visit being something

[30:13] around their next title.

[30:15] As I said, spooky pimples next game is coming out in June of 2021.

[30:20] It's not going to be what was at night of the living dead or was they had a hat on the

[30:24] dashboard.

[30:25] It's not going to be that people.

[30:27] They're not they love to do this.

[30:29] They love to sort of tease people and send them in the wrong direction.

[30:33] It's going to be a movie.

[30:35] It's going to be a mainstream movie.

[30:37] So how about Beetlejuice over at Spooky Pimball?

[30:40] Wouldn't that be a great home for Beetlejuice?

[30:43] We know that Stern passed on it.

[30:46] I don't think Beetlejuice would make sense for CGC considering everything they have going

[30:50] on.

[30:51] So how about a Beetlejuice?

[30:54] How about a Christopher Franchi working with Spooky Pimball on a Beetlejuice machine that

[30:59] is next from Spooky?

[31:02] That would be a perfect mainstream movie that falls into the spooky theme that I think

[31:08] a lot of people would want.

[31:10] Can they get all those assets from the Beetlejuice movie?

[31:13] I don't know, but I think you would need to have that.

[31:15] I'm excited to see this next one.

[31:17] I really am.

[31:18] Speaking of Spooky Pimball, there is a new code update for Rick and Morty.

[31:22] It has the Martian Moonman song and it really cool update.

[31:26] Really neat that they got that in there.

[31:28] If you have a Rick and Morty, I think there's going to be more fun stuff that keep dropping

[31:31] into this game.

[31:32] And I'm happy for all of you out there who are enjoying your Rick and Morty's.

[31:36] The gameplay is not for me.

[31:38] It just wasn't for me.

[31:39] Gameplay wise.

[31:40] I do love the callouts.

[31:42] I love the clips.

[31:43] I love the theme integration.

[31:45] But I just wish it was more rewarding to shoot and I can already hear like Rare Hero yelling

[31:49] at me because he loves it so much.

[31:51] It's great.

[31:52] I'm happy you love it.

[31:53] On the day I did my April Fool's show of Raza Shipping.

[31:56] On that day, Robert Mueller and the Deeproot team had their next correspondence in which

[32:02] we heard more delays.

[32:04] And now we're starting to hear the fact that they are going to possibly offer refunds

[32:09] if we get to mid-May and games are not ready to ship.

[32:13] Here's my take on Deeproot overall.

[32:15] I don't want to give Deeproot that much more air time because only 130 people are in

[32:22] on a Raza.

[32:23] That's nothing.

[32:24] Stern makes 130 games in a day and a half.

[32:27] Just think about that for a minute.

[32:29] Stern Pimball in one day and a half can make more games than Deeproot Pimball got orders

[32:34] for.

[32:35] Now in a day and a half, Deeproot Pimball can't make anything.

[32:38] In a year and a half, they can't make anything.

[32:41] In three and a half years, they can't make anything.

[32:43] So I don't even want to treat this company with the same level of focus as we do the other

[32:50] companies in the industry who are getting it done.

[32:53] I was talking to a friend the other day and I said right now Pimball is really just a

[32:57] three horse race.

[32:58] And that's it.

[32:59] It's a three horse race with an outlier that every once in a while decides to race, but

[33:05] they're not really part of it.

[33:06] To me, Pimball is Stern, Jersey Jack, and Spooky.

[33:10] And that's it.

[33:11] That's it.

[33:12] Every once in a while, Chicago gaming company will come in with a remake, but we wait two

[33:16] years for that and we've already played those games until they make a new game.

[33:20] But still just the old stuff with some new trimming and dressings on it.

[33:24] Year in and year out, who else is really giving you Pimball?

[33:27] Everybody else?

[33:28] Not so much.

[33:29] Doesn't have the demand.

[33:30] I know I can already hear Jerry from P3 Multimorphic being like, well what about us?

[33:33] Yes, Jerry, you're an outlier though.

[33:35] You're not leading.

[33:36] You're not one of the lead dogs.

[33:37] You're not selling 100 to 200 games a year.

[33:39] You're not.

[33:40] I would add an American Pimball to this race as well, but American Pimball has really

[33:45] struggle to be in that top three position.

[33:48] They really have.

[33:49] They haven't had a title that really has excited people like Spooky, like Jersey Jack,

[33:54] and like Stern.

[33:55] If I were to say to you, who's really leading?

[33:58] Right now it's those three.

[34:00] American Pimball definitely the fourth.

[34:02] CGC is the fifth because God knows why it takes them so long to get anything done.

[34:06] The rest of the companies are so far in the back.

[34:09] It's unbelievable to me that we have 16 or 17 Pimball companies that are legitimately trying

[34:15] to still make Pimball machines.

[34:17] American Pimball has to win us over.

[34:19] They know that.

[34:20] They know that their next title has to be won that shows us this is a new American Pimball.

[34:25] I don't know where it is.

[34:26] I don't know what the delay is, but if it's Legends of Vahala, that's not going to cut

[34:30] it.

[34:31] They know that.

[34:32] They know that.

[34:33] After David Fix said he's got Roger Sharp and he's got Dennis Norman.

[34:36] We are excited to see what's next from AP, but to me AP still has not been a Pimball company

[34:43] that has wowed us with anything yet.

[34:45] Let's see what happens over there.

[34:47] The good news is this, AP's price point puts them in a good position to be successful.

[34:53] Now what they need to figure out, they need to figure out a way to make it like a two-tiered

[34:58] model.

[34:59] They didn't make anything for collectors.

[35:01] They had the worst marketing strategy of like, we're going to make these games as long

[35:05] as people want them and we're not going to like limit it.

[35:07] It doesn't work.

[35:08] You still need to have some sense of this game will not be made forever.

[35:13] If you say you're going to make the game forever, there's no urgency to buy.

[35:17] And with so much competition in Pimball, you need to create some urgency to buy.

[35:22] If Rick and Morty was like, we're going to make as many Rick and Morty's as people

[35:25] want, there's no way the game sells out in one hour.

[35:27] And they would be making that game for 18 years because the demand for it is greater

[35:32] than the 750.

[35:33] So I'm excited to see what's next from all these companies.

[35:36] I think AP has to be giving us a game in the next couple months.

[35:40] They have to be.

[35:41] There's no way they can keep waiting because here's what's going to happen.

[35:45] If Brian Eddie's title is a juggernaut theme and the game is good, it doesn't have

[35:51] another stranger things moment.

[35:53] It really makes it hard for everybody else.

[35:56] There's only so much money and room people have.

[35:59] And so I'm super excited to put my feet up and watch all of this because I have no room

[36:03] for any of these games.

[36:05] My guns and roses collector's edition is paid for and it is sitting in storage in Chicago.

[36:11] I am not going to take delivery because there's going to be a crib where it would have

[36:15] been.

[36:16] When I get a house, who knows when?

[36:18] Look at the housing market.

[36:19] You want to talk about depressing?

[36:21] Look at the stupid housing market in America.

[36:23] I mean, literally people are doing everything opposite of what a financial advisor would

[36:29] tell you to do.

[36:30] People are bidding on houses without even doing inspections.

[36:34] People would rather be house broke and look rich than have money in the bank and live

[36:39] below their means.

[36:41] See, I'm going the other way and that's why we're in this one bedroom is I'm living

[36:45] below my means.

[36:46] I'm saving a lot of money each month, investing a lot of money each month so that when I

[36:51] am 60 years old, I never have to work another day in my life versus looking super wealthy

[36:57] when I'm 44.

[36:58] And then I get to the point where like, oh, I'm an old creative and there's no need for

[37:02] me anymore.

[37:03] And then God forbid something happens in my career and then we're under water immediately.

[37:08] I'm not doing it.

[37:09] I'm not doing it.

[37:10] I'm not buying a pirates as my investment strategy.

[37:13] I know this has been a little bit of a weird episode, 568, but you know, I'm back on the

[37:16] airwaves.

[37:17] There's no pins side.

[37:18] What else are you going to do?

[37:19] What else are you going to listen to?

[37:21] Come on, can you just spin ball podcasts?

[37:23] We went four for four.

[37:24] All right, we're going to get some interviews.

[37:25] I just have to find the time.

[37:26] You'll be able to catch me on Orbiter Albert show sometime soon.

[37:30] We're just trying to find the right time.

[37:31] Have a good day, everybody.

[37:33] Enjoy this period off of Pinside.

[37:36] Babykilling is crying.

[37:37] I'm going to go see how to suit this little man.

[37:39] Love you guys later.
