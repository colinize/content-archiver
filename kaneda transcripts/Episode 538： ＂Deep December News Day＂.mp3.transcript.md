[00:00] Slip inside the eye of your mind

[00:04] Don't you know you might find

[00:07] I've had a place to play

[00:12] You said that you'll never be

[00:15] But all the things that you've seen

[00:19] You slowly fade away

[00:22] You know this is the busiest

[00:26] December in the pinball industry I've ever seen

[00:30] And I've been covering this industry now for four years

[00:33] And we have been getting more companies

[00:36] Trying to make major moves in the month of December

[00:40] It is incredible right?

[00:42] And I want to talk a little bit from a marketing standpoint

[00:45] What I think this means all this stuff colliding on top of itself

[00:48] And how I think these companies are going to come out of this

[00:51] Very very busy December

[00:53] On this episode of Canadian pinball podcast

[00:55] We are going to talk about the news, the rumors, and the speculations

[00:58] Okay, we're going to keep it focused there

[01:00] Nobody expected there to be a humongous, deeper announcement yesterday

[01:03] We're going to talk a little bit about that

[01:05] I've got some details that I'm hearing about

[01:07] Alien pinball that are new

[01:09] And there's a stern rumor as well

[01:11] We're going to talk about that

[01:12] Now before I jump into that I want to address a few of the criticisms

[01:16] I've been hearing about Canadian pinball podcast

[01:18] Because if you go out of the air for just one day

[01:21] Someone asked to start a pin-side thread about that

[01:23] Then everyone asked the pile on how much they hate Canada

[01:26] It's amazing, there's still so much hatred out there

[01:28] But I want to address a few of the criticisms directly right now

[01:31] First one was his show is losing momentum

[01:34] Losing momentum

[01:36] Okay, I have done 538 podcasts about pinball

[01:41] Okay, I'm allowed to lose a little momentum

[01:44] This is an industry in which there is maybe legitimate news

[01:49] Six or seven days out of the year

[01:52] And we pick up the mic, I say we, but it's really me

[01:55] Because you know, I'm bipolar as everyone says

[01:57] I put on the mic and I do a show about pinball three times a week

[02:01] So you lose a little bit of momentum

[02:04] But we don't have to do segments, we don't have to do long shows

[02:06] We get right to it

[02:07] The other criticism I heard recently was that I didn't give enough air time

[02:12] To replay fx and pinberg going away

[02:15] Now I have mentioned that it did go away

[02:18] And we did have a moment of silence for that show disappearing

[02:22] And for everything that went on around that show

[02:24] But here's the thing, and I want to be totally candid

[02:26] I never went to replay effects

[02:29] I never engaged in pinberg

[02:31] So I do understand that this was a huge loss for a lot of people

[02:35] But I don't have personal stories to share from the show

[02:39] And if you listen to most people and most of the other podcasters out there

[02:44] When they talked about it, they talked about their personal experiences at the show

[02:49] And why they are going to miss it so much

[02:51] And I think they all did a tremendous job articulating

[02:55] Why losing the show is such a big thing in the pinball industry

[02:59] Why would you want to hear me talk about that?

[03:01] I've never been

[03:02] And you know that I also don't talk about tornemans

[03:04] So it's not surprising that canada didn't talk about that

[03:07] And then the other thing I heard was well there's going to be 400 machines that enter into the collecting community

[03:13] So surely he'll talk about it from that angle

[03:16] And I just want to say this

[03:17] 400 machines going out into the world is nothing

[03:21] Stern pinball makes 400 machines a week

[03:24] There are thousands of machines for sale at any moment in the world

[03:28] So yes, yes, I'm sad to show in a way

[03:31] But it isn't this seismic shift in the pinball world

[03:35] And I think that the show will come back

[03:39] Because there's enough people that want it

[03:41] There's enough money to be made if you do it right

[03:44] And this pandemic is not going to last forever

[03:46] So I covered it, there you go

[03:48] What else have I done wrong for you out there?

[03:50] Alright, let's jump right into the news rumors and speculations

[03:53] And I want to start in reverse order of magnitude

[03:56] Okay, so the first thing I want to talk about is that I am hearing from my sources now

[04:01] This might be wrong and then people will call me out

[04:05] That December 15th, Stern pinball is going to announce its next cornerstone title

[04:12] December 15th, so that's next Tuesday

[04:16] We are going to hear the next cornerstone from Stern

[04:19] Now, so what's the title?

[04:21] The best guest going is Led Zeppelin by Steve Richie

[04:24] Not sure who's coding it

[04:25] I would guess it would probably be Tim Sexton leading that coding team

[04:29] Because we haven't seen him on a game since Black Knight with Steve Richie

[04:32] And they worked well together

[04:34] I'm hearing that Stern called their distributors

[04:36] And told them that that is the date they are going to walk the distributors through the new title

[04:42] The pro will be on the line

[04:44] And games will be shipping to Europe on the 18th

[04:47] I believe the 17th or 18th games will ship to Europe

[04:51] Okay, so that means we might get a new Stern title under the Christmas tree

[04:56] Before the end of the year

[04:59] And I'll say this, sometimes we have to remember that Avengers came out in August

[05:04] So even though Stern has a backlog, this makes total sense for them to stay on this schedule

[05:10] Because here's the other thing I think people forget about

[05:12] Stern doesn't really care if you cancel one of their game orders and move over to another

[05:17] Because they're going to make money either way

[05:19] And they have so many lines going at the same time

[05:22] It doesn't really affect them very much

[05:24] They have their making Ninja Turtles, their making Avengers

[05:27] And they're going to make this new game, they're making heavy metal

[05:30] They can do the impossible

[05:32] Stern always does the impossible when it comes to manufacturing

[05:35] It never ceases to amaze me how efficient and how effective Stern Pimball really is

[05:41] And I've always said this, we give them crap every once in a while

[05:44] But without Stern Pimball, there is no Pimball industry

[05:47] I mean, there really isn't

[05:48] These guys keep Pimball going consistently

[05:51] All the other companies, they take a really, really long time to get their games out the door

[05:55] I mean, just ask people who ordered their guns and roses, how long they are going to wait for guns and roses

[06:00] Now that being said, I am very glad we have options

[06:04] I am very glad we have Jersey Jack Pimball in this industry

[06:08] I am very glad we have spooky Pimball in this industry

[06:11] I am very glad we have all these boutique companies trying to innovate American Pimball

[06:16] Dutch Pimball, highway, now Pimball brothers, deep route

[06:20] We've got all these other companies, P3 multi-morphic, who am I missing?

[06:23] Who am I missing here?

[06:24] So we've got all these companies giving you options

[06:27] So it's a great time to be a Pimball buyer, it's a great time to be in the industry

[06:32] Because all these companies are competing for your money and space in your home

[06:37] Or space in your bar or arcade

[06:39] That's an incredible thing that we have so many options

[06:41] I mean, there's way more companies now than there ever was in the 80s and 90s

[06:45] And in Pimball's heyday, they didn't even have this many options

[06:49] So it's great, it's great

[06:51] So the other rumors I'm hearing right now revolve around alien Pimball

[06:54] Now every day we get a new teaser from the Pimball brothers

[06:57] The latest one today showed the white wood with more holes cut into it

[07:01] So here's what I'm hearing the plan is with alien Pimball

[07:04] Okay, you're hearing it here on Canadus Pimball Podcast

[07:07] I'm hearing this game is most likely going to be made in Europe

[07:12] It's not going to be made in the States

[07:14] So that means rule out Chicago gaming company

[07:17] Rule out American Pimball, they are going to make it overseas is what I'm hearing

[07:22] Now I could be wrong on that

[07:24] The other thing I'm hearing about alien is they are going to release it with a three tiered model

[07:30] There's going to be a base model in Ellie and then a collector's edition

[07:35] Now I'm hearing the Ellie version of the game is going to be priced around a stern premium

[07:41] So you're going to see like a $7,500 to $8,000 alien Pimball machine that has all the features

[07:48] And then I'm hearing they are going to make a collector's edition sort of higher end limited game

[07:53] Which they're going to make less than 500 so what does that mean?

[07:56] Probably 400 alien Ellie's will be a CE version

[08:02] Now I'm not sure what all the bells and whistles are but I am hearing that the top of the line alien game will be around $12,500

[08:11] Now why wouldn't you do it right?

[08:13] It makes total sense as Dutch Pimball continues to sell Lebowski at that price with a wait list

[08:19] Guns and Rose is sold out in one hour, one hour of GNR sold out for $12,500

[08:26] And we know that the alien theme is a juggernaut theme that tons of people would love to get this game

[08:32] You know and I heard Zach many say this and I still do agree with Zach

[08:35] This game will never go down as a classic game without Sigourney Weaver in it

[08:41] I'm sorry like you just can't make a game where you leave out the main character of the films

[08:47] Now that being said from the people who have this game

[08:51] They say that the game is amazing the atmosphere is incredible

[08:54] I have not played enough of alien and the reason why I haven't is most of the times when I went to the shows

[09:01] This game was broken down so I do look forward to seeing how the Pimball brothers have sort of taken Andrew's design and improved upon it

[09:10] Now we are losing some things in their game they have removed the screen from the playfield that is confirmed

[09:16] We can see by the very playfield themselves there's no screen there the cabinet will be different

[09:21] They are adding a magnet to the game so there's some things taken out there's some things put in

[09:26] Now we will see what this final game is like when it is revealed now this game has to be revealed soon

[09:32] Because they are almost showing everything and then some so there's really not much left to show other than

[09:38] Are they going to use Aurex artwork or are they going to use new artwork

[09:41] And then it's like when you can get it how much is it and here's the final game

[09:46] But I'm excited to see what the Pimball brothers do with this and I am glad that they gave the vouchers for those who got robbed by Andrew Highway

[09:54] So that is good news and of course the big news item yesterday after all these years after all these promises

[10:01] After all the hyperbole after all the teases after all the five days of deeproot at tpf

[10:07] We got to see deeproot pimball turn on their website and share with the world what their plans are for retro atomic zombie adventure land

[10:16] The order banks open up today and they go through to December 30th I want to talk about this in broad strokes

[10:23] Because it's a lot to digest okay, and I want to talk about it through this lens to me pimball is simple

[10:29] It's simple. It's a simple game. It's a simple product everyone around the world knows what you're talking about

[10:36] When you talk about pimball it's simple to start a game. It's simple to play a game. There's two buttons

[10:41] There's two flippers usually right and some games have more but for the most part when I think about pimball and why I love pimball

[10:48] It is a simple game. It should be simple to buy a pimball machine right you buy a pimball machine from a company

[10:54] They put it in a box they mail it to you you open it up and you have your game the games should be done by the time you unbox it

[11:00] We all feel that way right? I don't want to wait for the game to be completed after I've bought it

[11:05] There is no other entertainment device where you buy it and it's not completed when you open it up right you don't go to see a movie and only half of the special effects are put in and they tell you to wait and come back in a few months and you'll see more of it

[11:18] Come back in a year and you'll see even more of it a pimball machine for the amount of money it costs should be complete the moment you open up the box

[11:26] Especially games that have been worked on for many years right there is no excuse why a new modern pimball machine should be incomplete when you unbox it

[11:36] We saw guns and roses out of the box pretty much complete Avengers pretty much complete

[11:41] Thurnt Pimball has really started to improve how far along the code is when you open up a game so you know this is what pimball should be

[11:48] A simple toy even though cost a lot of money even though some of the codes are complex and whatnot it's a simple toy and so when I look at everything that went live yesterday the first thought I had was there's just a lot there's a lot here to unpack there's a lot going on with this company almost too much right I almost wish it was just simpler I wish it was just a game one game

[12:09] Where the game was the focus on everything everything should be about the game now there is a lot of walking through of the platform and what's going on and the innovations that have happened at deep route but for the most part the most important thing in everything is the game itself and then the second most important thing in all of pimball and everybody knows this the second most important thing with all of these pimball companies

[12:30] and this is not just deep route the most important thing is a company's ability to make the product because if you've covered pimball and you've followed this industry for years that always is paramount without that there's nothing there's nothing else you don't have anything if you can't make these products and there's a reason why Gary Stern always says we're a manufacturing company I mean think about that for a minute the world's largest pimball company that only makes pimball still considers itself not a pimball

[12:59] Not a pimball company but a manufacturing company and there's a reason why Gary says that and there's a reason why Stern positions itself is that because all pimball is is the thing they're making on the line but it also it also means this the thing that they're the most proud of over at Stern is how they've set up a manufacturing company in America and they should be proud of that and it's an incredible thing when you take a tour of the Stern production line and see what they're going to do is do that.

[13:29] all the work and all the effort that goes on behind the scenes to put that simple

[13:34] pinball machine in your house or in your bar. So right now that is still

[13:39] question mark for everybody out there is what does the production look like for

[13:43] deep-root pinball we haven't seen anything. Now I think everybody out there

[13:46] wants to see what production looks like. They did announce the schedule of how

[13:50] they're gonna do pre-orders and how they're gonna do deposits and the

[13:53] different phases by which they're gonna ramp up production. Now look I don't

[13:57] know I know I've said on a previous podcast whether or not they have

[14:01] production ready or not. I don't know what's going on over there okay so I just

[14:04] want to say for the record I have not seen that they do or do not have a

[14:09] production line ready to go. So ultimately the only thing I can go on is when

[14:14] they get games in a box right because if they do have a production line ready

[14:18] to go then we should see games ready to ship in the next few weeks. So the proof

[14:23] is just gonna be in the pudding it's not gonna be something that I'm gonna

[14:26] speculate on it's not gonna be something that I'm gonna say you know run for

[14:29] the hills because it's not there. No ultimately every company that sells you a

[14:34] product. The onus is on them to deliver on that product. Now as a buyer in the

[14:40] pinball marketplace every buyer out there I don't care if you're brand new I

[14:45] don't care if you've been following pinball for years it's on you as well as a

[14:49] buyer to ask the questions of the companies that you are thinking of spending

[14:54] money on to make sure you feel good about placing an order with that company

[15:00] okay it's not like a podcaster to tell you what to do it's not what a company

[15:05] wants you to believe you have ultimate power it's your money so pinball buyers

[15:09] over the years have gone on many journeys with many different companies and

[15:13] some of them have worked out some of them have not and I think most buyers right

[15:18] now do want to see manufacturing more than ever because they want to know that

[15:24] if I pay you today that I'm confident that I'm gonna get my product I mean it's

[15:29] just that isn't it just that simple it doesn't need to be complex you don't

[15:33] need a million different options you don't need a million different innovations

[15:36] it just needs to be a simple agreement between customer and company and I

[15:41] think that's the simplest way to think about it all now I know a lot's changed

[15:45] in the world covid and delays and increasing costs and it's obviously been

[15:50] really hard for deep route to get to this point where they're ready to sell the

[15:54] game but they're at this point now they are taking pre-orders so that was one

[15:58] thing that they said they would not do so they are taking pre-orders and you

[16:02] can pay in full and that gets you to the front of the line or you can give a

[16:06] deposit that's non-refundable so again this is just a moment in which as a buyer

[16:10] this is on you to figure out whether or not you feel comfortable with this now

[16:15] the one thing that will make everybody feel really comfortable is seeing games

[16:19] going into boxes and I think that would be one thing that I would want to see

[16:23] as a customer if you are going to spend money now the other part and again I'm

[16:28] just talking about this in broad strokes well you don't have a lot of time to

[16:31] see that because order banks are open only from December 8th through December

[16:37] 30th so you know I've always said there's a few ways to create FOMO you can

[16:41] limit the amount of games you make like they could have came out and said we're

[16:45] only making 500 roses like you can do it that way but the other way to create

[16:50] FOMO is this way you limit the amount of time people have to buy your product

[16:55] we saw Jersey Jack do this remember with dialed-in collectors additions it was

[16:58] sort of similar to this I think Jack said we're only going to make the amount of

[17:02] orders we get in the month of December and at midnight on New Year's Eve that

[17:06] is when the order banks close and that's the exact number of dialed-in CES

[17:11] we're gonna make now we know that Jack wasn't really being honest there

[17:15] because they ended up making like 150 like it was such an exact number but

[17:19] that's exactly what's happening here now I'm curious to see at December 30th at

[17:23] 3 p.m. when order banks close if Robert will transparently tell us how many

[17:29] orders they got because you know if people are in on a game and it's more

[17:32] limited they would like to know that because we also know that if the less they

[17:36] make the more valuable each one will most likely be in the secondhand market

[17:41] just because supply is not very high so order banks for rasa are open so this

[17:45] is it you know they'll this been a long journey to get rasa to market it's been

[17:49] so many years in the making and so I am curious like the rest of you just to

[17:53] see what the consumer reaction is to this game I'm not gonna speculate I'm not

[17:58] gonna say negative things I am just an observer to this whole thing because I

[18:02] am curious to see how well the strategy works of selling the game between the

[18:07] eighth and the 30th now the marketer me may say why not just keep your order

[18:11] banks open for longer like you don't need to limit your sales the very thing you

[18:16] need after all of this R&D and all of this innovation you need sales so it's

[18:21] really a little strange I think to limit your sales window so if I could

[18:25] recommend something over a deeper maybe extend that I and look they could

[18:29] easily say hey we got we got enough orders or we you know we want to open up

[18:32] the order banks more because of the enthusiasm around the title nobody would

[18:36] care like no one's gonna be upset if that order window doesn't extend past

[18:40] December 30th so that's some advice I would give them two other pieces of

[18:44] marketing advice I would just give to the team at deep root one is don't call

[18:47] the arcade version the budget version never use the word budget right Chevrolet

[18:51] would never say this is our budget Corvette when they talk about the base trim

[18:54] it's your arcade version it's meant for operators it's it's a simpler

[18:57] platform and that is how you should refer to it the other thing is when you're

[19:02] filming the pin bar and you have about in playing the pin bar just couldn't get

[19:05] over this part he's wearing a hat and so when they're filming it from the

[19:09] top down the brim of his hat covered the pin bar the entire time so Steve you've

[19:15] got to remove your hat if you want to show people how the pin bar is working

[19:19] while you're playing the game all right so ladies and gentlemen it's December

[19:22] 8th we've got deep root is now making Raza available to you it is now one of

[19:27] the options you can have as you decide what you want to do with your pin

[19:31] dollars okay when you have so many options like we do right now if you were to

[19:36] ask me the companies that are gonna win this battle and they're all in the same

[19:40] ring battling for your pin dollars the companies that are gonna win this

[19:44] battle are the companies that make it simple the companies that simply get

[19:49] you your game in a timely manner the companies that simply give you themes

[19:54] that you really want to play the companies that simply have no hassles no

[19:58] headaches have good quality that is where the money will ultimately end up

[20:03] going you know we buy pinball machines for entertainment for enjoyment we

[20:08] don't want buying a pinball machine to be laborious we don't want it to

[20:13] create headaches we don't want it to be aggravating we don't want the buying

[20:17] experience to be frustrating we don't want the ownership experience to be

[20:20] frustrating we don't want these pins to break down immediately when we get

[20:24] them right and we've all been following this industry for a long enough time to

[20:28] realize that the company right now that makes it the simplest is stern and there's

[20:34] a reason why stern is so damn successful because it's no hassle it's no

[20:38] hassle here's a theme I know I love here's all these distributors that will

[20:42] happily sell me a game and if I order with stern right now I'm gonna get my game

[20:46] in a few weeks the most all wait is a few months but I know I'm gonna get my

[20:50] game they're the simplest and that's why stern dominates you know and so any

[20:54] new company entering into the space that's really what you're competing with

[20:58] that simplicity the machine is very well oiled like it is over there and that's

[21:03] why they refer to it as a manufacturing company because they have that down so

[21:08] well and that is so well oiled their distributor model is so well

[21:12] established like people always forget this stern distributors are their sales

[21:17] force so every time they have a new title they've got this army of sales people

[21:22] that are going out there and finding them clients for their products and it's

[21:26] really really simple and all of you know this like those distributors become

[21:29] your friends and there's some of the most outspoken and incredible

[21:32] personalities in the pinball business and in the pinball community and it's

[21:36] awesome it makes you feel good you know to buy a game to simply get in in a

[21:41] timely manner knowing that your distributor who's your buddy is gonna make a

[21:44] few bucks because you ordered through him all of this makes people feel good

[21:48] and it's the holidays ladies and gentlemen I want everybody to feel good about pinball

[21:53] feel good about these options but I also want everyone to remember by the games that you want

[21:58] buy from the companies you feel confident in and all the information is out there nowadays

[22:03] you know people give this podcast so much crap all the time like they come at me they call me this

[22:08] they call me that I think that this show and I think others out there as well I think what we've

[22:14] been able to do is create much greater transparency within the community and also educate people

[22:21] on the kinds of things they should look out for the kinds of questions they should ask of companies

[22:26] and the kinds of things they should have in their mind before they buy pinball machines it's all

[22:32] good it's none of it's bad it's not a negative quality to be a critical thinker and I think a lot

[22:37] of times people insult me and call me all these names because I'm simply not cheerleading

[22:42] everything going on in the pinball world but if you follow the pinball industry as long as I have

[22:48] you've seen good bad and ugly I just want to sign off this show by saying this because we have

[22:53] so many companies and so many products ultimately it comes down to the simplest thing putting the game

[22:59] in the box selling that game to a customer that is all you need to do you don't need to do anything

[23:06] else you don't need to innovate every single element of pinball you don't need fancy launch videos

[23:11] like the guns and roses one you don't need it right spooky didn't use anything fancy to sell

[23:15] Rick and Morty and that's it make your game sell it to customers it's simple pinball is fun all

[23:22] pinball is fun I mean at one time you went on a pinball machine and that wasn't fun fun is the

[23:27] easy part the hard part is making these incredibly complex machines available for home ownership that

[23:34] is incredibly hard and it is incredibly amazing how many options all of us have right now as we

[23:41] head into 2021 I mean it's incredible so we all should be very thankful at these options and you

[23:47] know what we're all just gonna win because now that we have so many options as a pinball buyer what

[23:52] better time can you live in than this everybody this has been episode 538 of Canadian pinball podcasts
