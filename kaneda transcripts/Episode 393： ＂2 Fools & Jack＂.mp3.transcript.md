[00:00] Well, you want to explain what happened, Jonathan, about this interview that we got.

[00:07] Well, I'm not sure whether I'm the most educated on the subjects, but there has been quite some,

[00:16] well, let's put it like this, some people have been very vocal about

[00:20] the play field issues that have been occurring or popping up the last month, whether it's

[00:31] clipping of clear codes on play fields or the rambling of clear code around posts, like you have on

[00:43] slingshots. Slingshots usually has three posts around it and on some play fields by different

[00:51] manufacturers, so they're which have different contracts manufacturers providing the play fields

[00:58] to them. These problems apparently occurred, but there's no relation between these different

[01:08] manufacturers, but for some reason apparently multiple manufacturers are facing these

[01:17] problems and some people have very big issues with them. For some people is the most important

[01:22] thing in the world. Personally, obviously not being affected by all of this since I have no game

[01:30] on order, I don't get that much what the fuzz is all about, but apparently on a forum like

[01:39] Pinside and certain podcasters tend to spend a lot of their energy in dissecting this problem.

[01:50] Apparently, even if they have no interest in this whatsoever because they don't have any of

[01:55] these games that are affected, but still it's a very big issue for them and apparently it's

[02:02] such a big issue that Jack Warnieri of Jersey Jack Pinball contacted us basically as he appreciates

[02:14] what we're doing with our podcast and the way we cover news for the pinball enthusiast community,

[02:22] so to speak. I wanted to speak up about the issue and we previously recorded a

[02:33] well him commenting on the situation so to speak. Yeah, I think that's absolutely right.

[02:40] Now one of the things that I think it's important to point out as you just did and maybe to stress

[02:46] it a bit more, this is not something which is unique to that to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:50] Other manufacturers have experienced similar issues although it seems to be something which is

[02:58] not entirely understood at the moment and as part of that understanding it also means they don't

[03:05] necessarily have a solution to this problem as such. There are trying various things, some of

[03:13] which will work, some of which won't work, but it might take a little while for them to actually

[03:17] get to the root of where the problem is and be in a much clearer state of mind as to how to

[03:24] tackle it and move forward. But it's not a thing which prevents the game from being played and

[03:32] being enjoyed but it is a definite cosmetic issue and so far, Jersey Jack Pinball have been

[03:41] spending their time trying to work out what it is that's wrong with the

[03:46] well, it's basically the clear coat on some of these games. And it's worth expressing that

[03:55] it's not like it's affecting apparently all games, it's a very small minority number of games

[04:00] that appear to be affected. Exactly, just a rise about to say. And the important thing there is

[04:09] that they get the feedback and they understand what the problem is, how many people it's affecting

[04:19] what the results are and to do that, Jersey Jack Pinball, amongst others I'm sure have been

[04:26] going through, I've been working with affected customers to try and resolve their issues and

[04:31] understand what the problems are. And that I think has led to some people seeing

[04:39] Jersey Jack Pinball is not communicating well with their customers, but there's in fact they

[04:46] have been working until behind the scenes to do this. But Jack wanted to come onto our podcast and

[04:52] tell us all exactly what's been going on and what he and the company and the play field supplier

[05:01] has been doing to try and resolve the problems and we'll continue to do so with people who

[05:08] get in touch and report any issues they might be having there. But as you say, it is a very small

[05:15] very small number of percentage of customers who have reported issues to them. But I guess we

[05:22] would just hear from Jack and he can tell us exactly what it is he has to say about the issues

[05:28] on the play field. Right. He has Jack. All right, well first of all I just want to

[05:34] apologize for the delay and speaking about this matter publicly as we sorted through things internally.

[05:40] And we understand that some of our customers are concerned to see in here of clear code

[05:46] shipping around posts on our willy walk again. The number of actual cases we have seen with true

[05:53] play field shipping is extremely low and we're in the process of developing a program for anyone

[05:59] who's documented damage and we'll work with those customers on a case by case basis and you know

[06:08] feel free to call tech support or call me directly if you feel your machine has true shipping or

[06:14] damage and we want you to feel confident and comfortable with your purchase always. We want to

[06:20] notify customers not to take apart their machine, remove posts etc. for the sole purpose of

[06:26] looking for shipping or problems under the posts. If you truly need to remove any part of the

[06:31] machine we recommend contacting JJP tech support for instructions on how to do this properly.

[06:37] And for those customers who see rippling or pooling around in any post we want to urge you this

[06:43] does not mean your game will chip. We're diligently working with our vendor and engineers day and

[06:49] night on correcting any pooling moving phone. We have no reason to believe any games out there in

[06:56] the field or an adequate in any way shape or form. You should continue to enjoy and play your

[07:02] amazing game. Our companies put countless hours and efforts into making Willy Wonka a fun

[07:08] experience for you and your loved ones to appreciate the years to come. I mean really our people

[07:13] work hard every day with passion to design and create amazing games for you to play. As we always

[07:20] have we will stand by our product and support our loyal customers and I can tell you that will

[07:25] never change. Thank you. Okay so there you have it folks. Straits from the horses mouth although I

[07:32] wouldn't want to say that check the horse but yeah you couldn't any any more directly than that.

[07:41] Right at least JJP speaking up which can't be said for all manufacturers who are basically either

[07:50] well keeping the conversation to themselves. Let's call it that and I can understand that Jack is

[07:57] looking for or is judging each case on its own which they are apparently doing and they're not

[08:08] going to be being very vocal about it which I understand as well. But I think it's a good thing that he

[08:18] speaks up he's not hiding and if people have an issue then they can contact him. Yeah I don't

[08:26] think any people in manufacturer would be particularly looking to broadcast the fact that there were

[08:32] potential problems with a small percentage of their games but the question is how do they deal

[08:38] with them and how does it resolve the problems that directly with the customers and obviously each

[08:46] issue needs to be dealt with in a case by case basis if somebody's got a little bit of wrinkling

[08:51] of the clear coat around an outlaying post that's not going to result in the same kind of

[08:58] resolution as somebody who might have no large flake taken off there the an important part of the

[09:05] play field along with the artwork that could be that could have a different solution to it so each

[09:12] one will be addressed on its merits and deal with the

[09:16] yeah and it also depends on how did this occur because if your play field was fine and you're

[09:20] figured like oh I got to check out the weather my play field is chipping and you take a

[09:23] play field apart and you ruin it that way yeah then you sort of brought it onto yourself I guess

[09:30] yeah I guess so though I guess we're also quite you know with older games we're quite used to

[09:36] you know taking posts out and and cleaning the play field and I'm putting it all back together again

[09:43] without the play field delaminating or the code coming off right well many of these

[09:49] play fields don't have the code that we are using today today's code is much thicker I don't know

[09:55] how long it takes for such code to completely harden out or I'm not sure what the correct verb would

[10:03] be no I don't think anybody knows how long I take to to completely cure I think that's the problem

[10:08] with them that they put all these extra extra thicknesses of clear on people assume oh we'll just

[10:14] take you know a little bit longer to to to completely cure and then it will be as hard as as a

[10:20] thin layer I don't think that I think we're finally now that's not the case and maybe in some cases

[10:24] these will never be entirely hard I think it's it might vary on me in case of not applying

[10:31] too many layers because the more you apply the softer the bottom layers will end up being

[10:38] yeah I think I think that is I don't think you can you know he can't just keep

[10:43] part in more and more layers of clear on unexpected them all to end up being as hard as the top

[10:48] surface and that's he doesn't seem to be the case so if you're going to put a post on it and

[10:52] tighten it down and start twisting it you can expect some some slippage to occur right and the

[10:57] thing is obviously these well they're building these games now it's you can't predict what will

[11:02] happen to a play field in in I don't know six months or a year I mean you just don't know what

[11:09] will happen with something that you spray on today I mean it's the same as walking across the

[11:14] street you don't know what's going to happen there might be a guard it might not be a guard that's

[11:19] true but I mean from from from our our discussions both before and after that that kind of

[11:28] statement from Jack I think we we kind of got a feel for certainly for Jackson's eye to get

[11:36] this problem under control and nine terms of PR but in terms of making sure customers are happy

[11:44] or the way that that any issues are resolved but also that it's it's still very much as a

[11:49] it's so it's a black art when it comes to clear-coating playfields these days with the extra layers

[11:57] and and the higher quality finish that the higher prices kind of have demand so when you're putting

[12:05] this extra glossy almost mirror like finish on playfields it's kind of something which has not

[12:12] been done much in the past and and also that it's very possible that there are changes in the

[12:18] composition of these coats that they're putting on due to various you know health and safety

[12:23] regulations and and banning of of hazardous chemicals right so you basically need a chemist

[12:29] to figure out what's going on and how to prevent it and or how to get rid well even then you know

[12:35] there's so many factors involved you know what what's the atmosphere when this does put on what's

[12:39] the wood it's going on to now what's the moisture content of that wood what's the ink because of

[12:44] very minor playfields now almost entirely inked so your clear coat is not bonding with the wood

[12:50] anymore your clear coat is bonding with the ink which is bonding with the wood so if there's any

[12:55] any the ink is not sticking to the to the wood you know then it might not be a clear issue it

[13:00] might actually be an inking issue could be well there's obviously this plan gets speculation going

[13:06] on and but for something that apparently it's not even such a big issue we've already been talking

[13:12] about it for over 10 minutes

[13:15] and

[13:39] mesh each
