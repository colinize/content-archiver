[00:00] What the hell am I to hear?

[00:06] I don't belong here.

[00:15] Welcome to episode 321 of Canadian Spinball Podcast,

[00:19] the only pinball podcast that is best listened to in a home use only environment.

[00:26] Let's talk about Pirates of the Caribbean and my review of the game and the subsequent conversation that has happened.

[00:34] I want to talk about this on a few levels.

[00:37] I'm going to talk about some pinball news because we're going to move past this.

[00:40] We're not going to be labor prior to the Caribbean forever because there's a lot of other stuff going on in the pinball world.

[00:47] This is not a podcast dedicated solely to one game.

[00:51] But it is probably the most interesting title to look at right now in the pinball landscape.

[00:57] There's also Monsters Ellie which I played and I'll give my thoughts a little bit on that later on in the show.

[01:03] So here's what I want to talk about.

[01:05] I understand that for those of you out there who love Pirates of the Caribbean,

[01:10] you are annoyed by my rant about my experience with the game.

[01:14] Maybe the word review is a hard one to attribute to my experience.

[01:20] I think the question I want to pose to all of you out there is at what point can you review a pinball machine and how much work do you have to do beforehand in terms of your knowledge of the game?

[01:33] How much do you have to do as a player before you are allowed to give your opinion about a game?

[01:40] That's a question I'm posing to all of you out there.

[01:43] When I read people's feedback, a few things always seem to rise to the top.

[01:48] First of all, apparently you have to know a lot about the game and the modes and the coding in the game.

[01:55] You have to know what you're doing before you plunge the ball.

[02:00] For that to happen, you have to watch Twitch streams and different videos and different walkthroughs of the game.

[02:07] A lot of people were slamming me because I did not know that you can stack multi balls in Pirates of the Caribbean.

[02:14] Apparently that is one of the main objectives.

[02:16] What I did yesterday was I watched a really great stream of the game.

[02:21] I think it was i.e. pinball or e.i. pinball.

[02:25] This guy was amazing.

[02:26] He played on one ball for 30 minutes and went through pretty much all the different 5 chapter multi balls in Pirates.

[02:35] I get it.

[02:36] I get the way you can stack multi balls.

[02:38] That seems to be the main objective of this game is to get to the different multi ball chapters and connect them and progress through the game that way.

[02:51] I watched all of that.

[02:52] It's two hours and 45 minutes.

[02:55] Let's not fool ourselves.

[02:57] His games were lasting a half hour if not more.

[03:02] There's a lot of time you have to watch a pinball machine.

[03:06] Apparently before you know enough to jump on to it.

[03:10] That's one school of thought.

[03:12] You need to educate yourself with a significant amount of streaming before you understand how to play the game.

[03:19] Now I could play devil's advocate and say that pinball shouldn't require such a long period of studying and watching and learning before you jump on a machine.

[03:32] That's sort of a thing I'm going to talk about is where are we now with pinball and how immediately enjoyable should a game be designed to be in the modern world.

[03:46] It's kind of funny that we live in an ADD world in which stuff needs to be immediately gratifying.

[03:53] And yet now some of these machines are requiring a level of knowledge that has never been required in the history of pinball.

[04:00] And yet people yell at me that I need to do my homework and understand the game more.

[04:05] There's that part of it.

[04:08] Now so there's the understanding of the rules of the game.

[04:11] And so some people out there say you need to understand all the rules before you even start flipping a game.

[04:17] Because the game itself will not intuitively tell you enough of the rules I think to get through some of these modern games.

[04:27] So there's that.

[04:29] The second thing and maybe the most important thing and by far the most important element that affected my experience with the game was how the game was set up.

[04:40] And again I want to thank Serge for showing me the game and he outlined on pinstead I'm not going to read everything.

[04:45] All the things that were wrong with the game and there was about like eight of them that he noticed as being off between the machine at sunshine and his machine at home.

[04:56] And I think a lot of people stop calling me all sorts of names and said look if I had that experience on that machine I probably would walk away with the same feeling about the game that Chris did.

[05:10] So I think some people gave me some slack a little bit that I was really upset not upset well maybe a little bit upset but really disappointed with my pie to the Caribbean experience.

[05:21] And so but that's the point where I struggle a little bit because how many times do I have to play a game on location like pirates and have a similar experience and then when am I allowed to come on this show and give you my opinions.

[05:35] So some people out there that they are like you need to do more work you need to do this so maybe I should do something a little bit differently maybe I should reach out to the different manufacturers out there and say hey I'm ready to review.

[05:49] Your pinball machine I would like to do a review of pirate to the Caribbean I would like to do a review of a monster Zellie and maybe the manufacturers out there could set me up with a game that is set up properly is at the right pitch has the right flipper power has all these things maybe they would help me out and point me in the direction of a game in which they believe it is set up correctly now I live in New York City now every major

[06:18] major manufacturers games they do make their way to New York City pretty quickly whether it's in a location or whether it's in a home collection there are people in this area that get every single new pin now here is the thing that this is why manufacturers probably will not help me out it's not because I slam them on the show it's because this is the reality of a world in which we now have pinball media and pinball influencers that are doing it.

[06:47] So I'm going to do a review of the other industry that are telling you there are points of view on the products now in every other industry I work in in every other industry whether it's the auto industry whether it's Oreo cookies whether it's Royal Caribbean ships let me tell you what happens when you've identified influencers and media within your industry what the manufacturers always do is they make sure that those people get access to the stuff beforehand and they also get the

[07:17] really good experience on the product which by that I mean that Stern would in some way or Jersey Jack in some way would find a way to invite the pinball media to play the game when it's set up correctly so they their first experience on it can be stellar now that doesn't happen that doesn't happen they completely don't care about pinball media they they always hook up the same streamers all the time and that's it that's it it's like you get Jack danger on a machine

[07:46] straight down the middle there's a great job of buying the games they buy the games these guys buy the games to review them you think Stern and Jersey Jack and other people would just send send Greg and Zach these games for free to do their great reviews and then they just send it back like that that and again I say that because in the tech industry when you're launching

[08:11] a five to ten thousand dollar TV the media will oftentimes be sent the TVs to test and then they get it back I mean Dodge gives journalists hundred thousand dollar demons to to to borrow for a weekend and then they give the car back it's not that hard to send someone to pinball machine and then pick it up and then send it to the next media person how awesome would that be if they sent canada a machine for home use only where I can have it for a week play it they can walk me through it and then they can

[08:41] then they just pick up the game not not extremely expensive when especially when you consider the amount of money the amount of money these these companies spend flying around the world to different shows and oftentimes bringing these things to shows that are not even in front of their audience or their buyers I mean Jack still brings all these Jersey Jack games to arcade shows and operation you know shows were where the target is arcade operators they're not buying these games Jack they're not

[09:11] and that leads me to my other point which is I think I keep hearing people say if Chris doesn't play pirates of the Caribbean in a home use only or home environment he is never going to fully experience why this game is so magical and I think that's a really big point that I want to talk about is do you have to play if you have to play a game in a home only environment why is the

[09:41] why are these games also trying to target barcades and be on location and especially and I said this before about Jack's games especially games that are much more complex that have a lot more issues on location that are super expensive that seem to be tailored towards more the high end buyer why then why then is Jack even focused on trying to get these games on location more

[10:09] and think about the reverse effect it has when you put a game like prior to the Caribbean on location and the experiences terrible is that going to make more people buy it and I said this when I went with surge the stern games on the other hand on location they crush it they're not they work better they shoot better there are more immediately satisfying because they're not so hard to get into stern understands I think how to you know win over the location play it

[10:39] above Jersey Jack and yet and yet Jack has had the I'm not I'm going to also say this Jack has had some real location hits like wizard of Oz and dialed in I hear have done really well for distributors out on location and so that or operators on location so look because they're

[10:57] much more visually wow games they are they make you want to put your quarter in but I think Pirates the Caribbean out of all of his machines seems to be the most problematic on location all right

[11:09] so I'm gonna I'm gonna again raise my hand and if you're in the Northeast and you have a Pirates of the Caribbean in a home use environment if you have a game that is set up correctly in the Northeast within an hour to two hours of New York City I'm raising my hand and saying I will happily come over and play the game the right way and I could tell from the IE stream that I watched that the game I played

[11:38] was totally fucked like it was beyond fucked the it all the shots this guy on the stream was hitting the the right ramp he was hitting it with the left

[11:47] flipper he was back handing he was back handing the right ramp every single time with the right flipper on the machine at sunshine that is impossible you if you if you fully hit the the right flipper

[12:03] back handing it towards the right ramp the ball would barely even get to the entrance of the right ramp it would or go maybe maybe halfway up and come right down and straight down the middle so

[12:15] maybe where your vitriol should lie is with Peter at sunshine laundromat for setting up his game so brutally hard maybe he's doing a disservice to some of these games setting them up that way

[12:29] and this guy was starting multi balls on the stream left and right pretty easily that was something that not only me and surge had a really difficult time doing so

[12:40] I'm asking you out there if you have one let me know I'll come by I don't have a close mind I don't I want to have a good experience on this game

[12:50] but I'll say this and this is something that some of you out there who love pirates of the Caribbean something that you all just have to accept is that not everyone is going to love this game I saw somebody right

[13:02] canate is the only one bagging on this game he's the only one who doesn't like this game and I'm here to tell you that that's absolutely false that there are other people there are a lot of other people who don't like pirates of the Caribbean

[13:17] okay there are the vast majority the vast majority of people who don't like pirates of the Caribbean just don't like the theme at all

[13:27] and those vast majority of people they also don't care to own one even if you think it's a great pinball experience a lot of people more people than none

[13:37] more people than none are not able are not able to separate their hatred of a theme

[13:45] and just go in on the game even if they like the way it shoots on a pinball level now that's not everybody we know some people hate

[13:50] metallic music and acdc music and iron made in music but still enjoy the pen because of the pin experience but for the most part and this is the silent majority

[13:59] there are most people out there they just won't buy a pen if it's not a theme that they want okay that that is that is the first door you have to get people through

[14:10] when it comes to pinball sales hence the reason why stern locks up the greatest themes for people because they get most people through the first door

[14:18] all right then it's like gameplay experience okay and so from there I think again people are being a little bit delusional

[14:26] when they act as if this is the greatest shooting pinball machine there ever is the the shot layout the geometry the toys

[14:34] I get why some people love this game but I also understand the counter point that this I don't I don't this isn't the most fun pinball machine to just shoot on a on a shooter level on a layout level

[14:47] I get there's a lot to shoot for but there's also a lot of issues I could see people having with the way the shots are and you also get people that just don't like wide bodies

[14:58] and that's a whole another category there's nobody out there who's like I just don't like standard I don't like standard body pins I always want it to be wide

[15:06] I that's like like one to five percent of people might think that way but I would say again the vast majority of people prefer standard body machines

[15:17] and I know there's going to be those people who say well this doesn't shoot like a wide body yes it does a little bit

[15:23] I do like what they did with the orbits are more towards the middle and not on the outsides you never do feel like you're always shooting wide you are shooting it almost feels like you are shooting more

[15:35] of a standard body game I would even argue that this game could have been standard body but again but I get I'm not even going to get go there right now

[15:44] okay so I guess what I'm saying is are people not allowed to not like this game it's like the owners of this game they have this feeling that if you experience everything I

[15:56] experience you're crazy for not thinking it's this incredible pinball game and I think that those people are in the honeymoon period I think I

[16:07] understand why they like the game but I also think they don't want to hear they don't want to hear why people don't like the game they don't they're they it is like when I live in

[16:18] New York City the equivalent I have is nobody in this city wants to hear why Donald Trump won the presidency now look I'm not I'm not saying like Donald Trump is is is

[16:29] pired to the Caribbean but there is a lack of dialogue and then there's a lack of conversation nowadays just in society about people just trying to

[16:39] understand why you think differently why you might not like what they like and and I don't think it goes vice versa I've been trying really hard to have a

[16:49] dialogue and talk to people about why is it you like what you like but but at the end of that conversation there also has to be a time in which you can

[16:57] say I understand why you like this game I understand the multi balls sorry my alarms going off I've got to get the work soon I understand the way the multi balls work the

[17:06] wizard mode work I understand how they had to make this game with a lack of assets and then at some point I'm allowed to sit down and look how they did it all

[17:14] and say to myself well this game just might be a miss for me because of the lack of assets in the game or the lack of narrative in the game

[17:24] or I don't think any of the toys are that magical to me right it's all subjective it's all subjective and I don't think anyone who who spends time on pirates who

[17:34] doesn't like it should be chastise and and sort of crucified for coming to that conclusion all right all right so ultimately ultimately the one question I always end up on I always ask this question is if it's so good

[17:52] and it's so amazing and Jersey Jack made the greatest pinball machine of all time why aren't the sales where they need to be why aren't people gobbling the game up

[18:04] and that's a question that I post to all of you out there who own a pirate to the Caribbean Derek friend of the show he bought two of them see they even with owners buying two of them

[18:14] they're still not sold out they're only going to make a thousand of them stern at the end of the day stern is going to end up selling more

[18:21] aerosmiths than Jersey Jack will sell of pirates of the Caribbean stern will sell more deadpools than Jersey Jack will sell of pirate to the Caribbean

[18:30] and it's got to be really frustrating for Jersey Jack and the team look about how hard they work on these games and they're just not selling

[18:38] they're just not selling they're not even coming close to selling the amount of games that stern sells I mean stern will ship stern will have shipped more monsters

[18:49] in two months then Jersey Jack pinball will have sold of pirates of the Caribbean again that he took two years to to work on two years

[18:59] and stern makes more money in two months off a game that has barely a quarter of what's inside pirates of the Caribbean

[19:07] from an engineering standpoint and that's why I feel bad for Jersey Jack pinball and I keep saying it over and over again

[19:15] I want Jersey Jack to succeed but this isn't working this approach is not working and as much as you might love

[19:24] you know the super deep code and all there is to do and all the all the different ways to approach the game

[19:30] I'm here to tell you that what's what's failing what is failing

[19:35] empire to the Caribbean and where Jack is falling down is he's not making the games

[19:42] immediately accessible and that is where he's getting crushed because if you remember

[19:48] if you remember what we heard from from Joe Newhart from pinball star if you read and Joe look and also

[19:55] Joe doesn't even distribute stern machines which are the number one selling machines

[19:59] if if you think about the majority of people who buy pinball machines are not okay they are not

[20:07] like you they are not like me they are not Hilton or Crazy Levy they're not the pinball

[20:13] of Fish and Nautos the majority of people who buy pinball machines walk into a distributor

[20:19] and they want something fun for the game room and they go and they play games and and pirates

[20:27] the Caribbean when you go into a distributor that has that alongside long side stern machines

[20:33] absolutely it's phenomenally looking and it has so much more in it but here's the thing the

[20:39] majority of distributors that people will walk into they don't even carry Jersey Jack pinball

[20:45] you know why they don't really carry Jersey Jack pinball nearly as much as stern

[20:50] this is the other thing that we don't really talk about when we talk about pinball sales

[20:54] but you know as a distributor selling Jersey Jack machines is financially not to your benefit

[21:01] you make less money this is crazy you make less money selling a Jersey Jack pinball

[21:09] pirates Ellie you make less money than you do if you sell a stern monster's pro the margins

[21:16] for distributors are far better on stern machines than they are on Jersey Jack machines now that's

[21:24] crazy and that is why that is why you know Jersey Jack machines you know the

[21:31] I you know it's hard for me to say the lack of sales is because like the theme or this or that

[21:35] a lot of their struggles literally just come down to like the distribution model of the games where

[21:42] the prices are at how well distributors can make you know make money on these games because

[21:49] what are you going to sell if you're a Zack many at flipping pinball and I love Zack and you know

[21:55] and I love Christopher Marquette at coin taker and I love Joe at pinball star you know if you're

[22:01] a distributor and you want to make money and your livelihood is selling pinball machines

[22:06] and you can make a lot more money selling a stern pro load him up load him up and here's the thing

[22:13] they keep bringing out new stuff so you're you're going to build your empire probably more

[22:19] around stern pinball than Jersey Jack because Jack games not only do they come out on a much

[22:25] slower level you make less money and then here's the part they're more problematic what you're

[22:32] going to get phone calls probably from who you know you then you have to go help someone whose

[22:38] wires are cut underneath their upper play field and you have to send a tech out to go solder wires

[22:44] together because remember this imagine if you buy a pinball machine it's one of your first pinball

[22:49] games ever and you're not used to working on them and if I paid $9,000 from a distributor and

[22:56] my rocking ship isn't working or the switch is not working I'm going to make that distributor fix

[23:02] the game I just bought it there's no way a brand new pinball owner should have to bring out a

[23:08] soldering iron and take off the upper play field and get to work like that there's just no way

[23:14] so again if you're a distributor less maintenance more money equals more enthusiasm to sell those

[23:21] products and I think that's another thing that keeps hurting Jersey Jack pinball all right all right

[23:27] this is again like you know all this you know all this and this is Jack's year where he either has

[23:33] learned his lesson or he's going to continue to make the same mistakes of the past so all right

[23:39] what else do I want to say before I move on to some pinball news so first of all I'm hearing that

[23:43] Jersey Jack will be bringing the new Wizard of Oz to TPF now here's the thing that I keep hearing

[23:48] different reports on how many yellow brick road additions is he going to make I've heard everywhere

[23:53] from 250 and the latest I heard yesterday is that he's going to make like 1200 yellow brick road

[24:00] now this is the game that keeps on giving for Jack he continues to sell this game on a global level

[24:06] it continues to be the game that when people stand over it they just have to have it

[24:11] it's his most successful title so I highly doubt that he will only make 250 what I'm curious

[24:17] what I'm curious about is when he reveals the yellow brick road addition if he puts a number or a

[24:23] cap on the number of them he's going to make if history has shown us anything he probably will

[24:28] because that does drive a little bit of scarcity and demand if you know they're only going to make

[24:33] this many of them all right what else is going on and then apparently Willy Wonka is done that when

[24:40] when he reveals it Jack will ship the game within a month or two that is what I'm hearing but I'm

[24:46] also hearing that he he wants to get I don't know toy story out by the time the movie I think this

[24:51] is old news I still think it's going to go Wonka G&R toy story all right what else is going on in

[24:56] the pinball world so over at this week in pinball they interviewed a Zach Sharp about the stern

[25:04] pin cider the pin cider club what are they called the stern insiders is that what it is oh it says

[25:12] the insider member program all right so we talked a little bit about this it's $30 a year you

[25:19] know how I feel I just thought some of the answers from Zach were funny I want to read them to

[25:23] you because whenever I really reach out to Zach and ask him to come on the show he always says no

[25:29] whenever I ask him for like a quote he does give me quote so he talks to me but what I love about

[25:35] this program is it clearly was a marketing decision on how to make money off of stuff that they

[25:42] should just communicate with us so so this this is what he says was the process behind the launch

[25:49] of the insider program he writes we have wanted to do something to give folks access to the world of

[25:55] stern outside of our current channels for many years as part of our new website development and

[26:01] redesign it provided the perfect opportunity for this goal sorry my alarm is going off again there we go

[26:11] we have an amazing global community of pinball fans and we want them to feel like they are part

[26:16] of the stern family all right so what I don't get about is this hey Zach hey Zach welcome to

[26:22] social media my friend your new website your new website which you have put up it it should not

[26:30] have taken you guys years which you said to share with people the world of stern pinball what what

[26:39] see I love when it says outside of our current channels to give folks access outside of your current

[26:45] channels here's why that makes no sense to me Zach why is Facebook not adequate enough for you to

[26:52] do all of this what why wait every single company on planet earth that is a multi billion dollar

[26:59] company can share information with their fans via Facebook they all do it Chevrolet does it

[27:07] Microsoft does it Apple does it oh but stern pinball stern pinball can't do it on Facebook for free

[27:13] they now have to charge us to get access to the world of stern so I just think that doesn't make any

[27:19] sense to me that you you couldn't do this with the current channels is there anything that you're doing

[27:25] on this new channel of yours that is that it that provides something different you can sell stuff

[27:33] on Facebook you could sell people t-shirts on Facebook no you know what they can do now is they

[27:38] can make you they can make you see what they can't do on Facebook is they can't charge you $30

[27:43] and make you have to log in with an email and password to get you to see the video or the podcast

[27:49] or whatever the t-shirt that he buy exclusively that's that's the only thing that is different is

[27:55] on their new website they can charge you money to then see a part of that website or some content

[28:02] that they're going to put up all right he then the question was can you give an example of what

[28:07] to expect at a stern insider only event oh this one man get ready he writes stern insider only

[28:14] events will vary from private webinars or podcasts directly with our game designers programmers

[28:22] and artists to exclusive entrance or early access to a stern sponsored party oh man get early access

[28:33] get into that party first yeah we all know what's going to happen we all know what's going to happen

[28:38] with this shit exclusive entrance or early access so there's there's going to be stern events in which

[28:46] only people who pay to be part of the insider program can get to let me tell you how often I

[28:52] think that's going to happen zero okay these guys are not stupid what they will do is they will just

[28:59] give everybody access but they'll probably just charge everybody inside or get in for free but

[29:03] everyone else has to pay remember their birthday party remember the big what was it the the 30th

[29:09] birthday party of stern pinball and they were celebrating 30 years of stern pinball do you remember

[29:13] that party at I believe it was a tpf you remember what they did they made you pay money to get into

[29:20] their own birthday party I think you might even in Chicago I forget it was at expert tpf but how

[29:25] funny is that imagine inviting your friends to your birthday party hey guys come celebrate me being

[29:29] so successful for 30 years and by the way it's 50 bucks each of you come on come on see the DNA

[29:36] within this company still remains super super cheap and money grab come on you know it you can't

[29:43] come on George I know you listen Zach I know you listen you can't charge people to come to your

[29:47] birthday party and let's talk about in event I don't understand why he would list a webinar or

[29:55] podcast as an event but it does sound like now they are going to keep their people exclusively

[30:04] for the most part on see here's the thing all of their people are doing podcasts for free with

[30:10] guys like special one lit head to head you know there's a lot of other I just saw they they had

[30:16] a stern the coder for beetles went on to the little kings pinball podcasts I mean they won't even

[30:22] do this show and they do the little kings pinball podcasts that gets like 200 listens for episode I

[30:27] mean it's unbelievable the the lengths at which they go to avoid the show um but so you know look

[30:33] but here's the thing are they now going to not let those personalities go on to other shows and

[30:40] make those podcasts are they going to make them pay for play so you can't so the insiders get

[30:47] that information first the other thing is this who's doing them who is doing stern's podcast

[30:54] is it Christopher Fransche and and is he doing it is he's setting up these interviews does he have

[31:00] the time to do all that is is this going to be where we finally see the super duper extra awesome

[31:06] you know 10 times back flips podcast that that he promised last June is it finally happening I don't

[31:12] know I don't know who's doing the podcast so it seems really silly to me in a world in which there

[31:17] are 35 plus pinball podcasters out there that are doing this for free and getting you guys great

[31:24] interviews with the stern people that stern is now going to go take that in house and again they're

[31:30] not specialists at pinball podcasts so he then goes also the reason why I don't like it is here's

[31:36] why there's just something I think that's lame that when a company controls the interviews with

[31:42] its own employees and I'm sorry but are they going to ask them the hard questions are they ever

[31:47] going to press them the only reason why you listen to this show meant me not the only reason but I

[31:52] think the moon big reason why people like this show is is we're not in anyone's pocket like we're

[31:58] not we don't have an agenda to just only say nice stuff about stern and I think that's a big

[32:03] issue I have with these shows in the way they're going to just lob all the softball questions up

[32:09] to these guys and also they're going to edit them we're never going to know if anyone said anything

[32:13] interesting you know and so that's an issue I have that's an issue I have because here's here's

[32:19] why because when Jared came on this show and I never was able to interview it he's we asked about

[32:24] what do you think of Steve Richie calling pinside a cancer right what do you think about one of your

[32:29] biggest designers saying that the form in the community is a cancer to the hobby and we asked

[32:34] and we talked about that because that was a big news item of the time and what happened stern pinball

[32:40] listen to that interview and then refuse to let Jared give me the green light to put it up and

[32:46] at a respect for my friendship with Jared I have not put that up but one day I might just do it

[32:52] because enough time has passed I also think it makes stern look overly protective all right all

[32:57] right then he goes on to say will insiders see new game reveals before the general public and he writes

[33:04] right possibly with an exclamation point I mean I feel like he entered it like Scooby-Doo like

[33:09] possibly like with the exclamation I mean come on come on there no they're not no they're not there

[33:16] is no way the insiders will get it first because this is where I think even in stern's cash grab

[33:22] insider program they're not stupid enough to realize that the second someone sees something it's

[33:27] gonna end up on pinside immediately everything will all right then it says in the press release it

[33:34] mentions private access to exclusive webinars videos and interviews with game designers programmers

[33:39] artists and other stern insiders can you explain more okay so he writes similar to early access to

[33:45] the newest games as an insider you'll get to be part of interviews with the designers programmers

[33:50] and artists and other stern insiders not only will the focus be on new releases but also games

[33:56] from our catalog and the history behind some of our classic titles there will be tips on the latest

[34:02] code releases as well as service webinars from our expert team here in tech service well first of

[34:08] all everyone should get service webinars not just like insiders but also this is what what is new

[34:14] here that we're we're getting this currently all the pinball podcasters out there that interview

[34:20] these designers they are doing great jobs of getting these designers to talk about yesterday

[34:26] games and the current new release so there's nothing new here okay then the question was the press

[34:33] release mentions exclusive access to product launch webinars does that include new pinball machines

[34:39] and what would a webinar happen at the time of the official launch so Zach writes for every new

[34:45] gamer release we have internal product launch webinars to educate our dealer and distributor network

[34:51] about the latest title now is a stern insider with all access you can see in here these presentations

[34:58] after a game is launched okay I think that's a great thing I think that's a great thing that they

[35:03] have a webinar that explains to the distributors like all there is in the game why doesn't everybody

[35:08] get that why does not everybody get that kind of information and that kind of access before you're

[35:14] asking these people to pull the trigger on nine thousand dollar games before they even play it

[35:19] should should not every consumer get this kind of information all right and then we'll we'll

[35:24] the content include jack danger he wrote it won't include their initial live stream but there will be

[35:30] exclusive videos that will we'll include jack sometimes all right that's a given all right I'd

[35:34] love this giveaways and limited edition merchandise are also mentioned he writes we don't want to spoil

[35:40] all of the surprises here but let's just say every month there will be a random stern insider receiving

[35:47] wait there will be a random stern insider receiving a special item in the mail all right so is that

[35:52] just one person want one I huh so one person is gonna receive something in the mail whoa guys

[36:03] holy shit how are you gonna afford that to send one person something man I got to sign up for this

[36:09] program as for the limited edition merchandise we will be bringing exclusive merchandise that will

[36:15] only be available to stern insiders at several of the major shows in addition to items that will be

[36:21] available on our store these items will vary from exclusive t-shirts pins wait let's stop there

[36:31] holy shit guys there's an exclusive monsters Ellie pen and only stern insiders can get it

[36:40] man man I've just there's nothing I want more in life when my dad asked me hey Christy feel like

[36:46] you made it that I made it man all the education all the years of college all the all the accolades

[36:53] and work I've received all the billions of impressions and media coverage none of that was worth it

[36:58] dad at the end of my day when I hold up this stern insider pin it's it's it's the beacon

[37:07] it is the highlight it is the greatest accolade of my career daddy stern let me buy an exclusive pin

[37:15] this is only and you had to be an insider to spend $30 a year to get this pin and I'm gonna

[37:21] wear this pin daddy I'm gonna wear it every day Jesus Christ fucking air you kidding me a

[37:27] fucking pin a fucking pin they they are so out of ideas but exclusive t-shirts pins hats and more

[37:37] could you know I love it when it's and more it could be a fucking anything what they need to do is

[37:43] make stern underwear all right because they've got you by the balls they might as well just do

[37:48] that make a pair of stern tidy whiteies that have like two pin balls where your nuts go because this

[37:54] company this company just has everybody buy the balls and moves like this just reek reek

[38:02] of a spoiled sort of super successful category market leader there they've they've they've

[38:10] they control so much of pinball that they can now do stupid shit like this there this all this

[38:17] information all these hats and pins and t-shirts there's no fucking reason why you should have

[38:22] to pay this company any money to get to any of this stuff it's such bullshit Christopher

[38:29] Franchi can crank out 15 different t-shirt designs in a fucking week and then they're just gonna put

[38:35] like only a hundred of these only a hundred of those only and then here's the thing you all you

[38:40] get is access to those fucking things you they're not free you still have to buy them it's just $30

[38:47] in their pocket a year so if they get a thousand people to sign up for the insider program which I

[38:52] don't think they're going to do that's only $30,000 a year extra to then create this stupid layer

[39:01] between them and their customer base and it's a name and it's idiotic and it's greedy they don't

[39:07] need it they don't need it if stern wants to set up if they want to set up events in which only

[39:16] you know stern insiders can get into or they want to reward people with exclusive events here's

[39:21] a fucking suggestion Zach how about you make it so only if you bought a stern Ellie can you get

[39:28] into this event how about you have a stern limited edition club where anyone you buys more than

[39:33] two Ellie's gets access to it how about the money people already gave you gets access to things

[39:40] or how about this how about you stop all this stupid shit and just do stern parties in which you

[39:48] allow pinball people to come together and you do it in a way that doesn't require people to give

[39:52] you money in some arbitrary way to get access to it you see what I'm saying it's just not cool

[39:59] it's not cool at all to have to pay extra to get to these kinds of things you should just

[40:06] fucking be doing them because you have 90% of the pinball market you're the only company that

[40:10] making a ton of money you're the only company that has four to five like really good games a year

[40:16] sometimes a couple great games a year you're the only company that keeps pinball alive you are the

[40:21] leaders fucking act like leaders this is to me this is not a leadership move it is just a really

[40:28] simple lazy marketing approach to put a few extra bucks in someone's pocket I don't know whose idea

[40:33] was it says it's as idiotic as the marketing move was around the Beatles pricing which isn't

[40:38] working out we we they didn't sell everyone the games are not moving they're sitting there they're

[40:44] sitting there and so like when are they gonna learn that we like you okay stern we like you we like

[40:51] you as a company we like you a lot we just want to see you do stuff that doesn't wreak of this

[40:57] sort of greedy desperation for money when you don't need it you have the most profit happening

[41:04] in the industry you have the most consumers you have the most fans why are you doing this dumb

[41:10] shit why are you doing it why are you now gonna like only give people who pay money access to

[41:15] webinars and podcasts and fucking pins exclusive pins for fucksakes who wants that like who sat in a

[41:24] room is that did you sit in a room in someone like well what can we give a value well what about

[41:28] those pins like what the fuck what the fuck no no you know what should be happening over at stern

[41:36] instead of this garbage instead of this this stupid plan is you know what they should be saying is

[41:43] well when someone spends nine thousand dollars on the limited edition game can we actually give them

[41:47] something that the different experience so it justifies the cost can we actually have one of

[41:53] our coders put a mode in that's exclusive to Ellie owners can we actually give them something

[41:59] that's not the same exact game as the premium like that's what I want to see in stern fucking pinball

[42:04] I want to see the limited edition games actually have a little bit of like a limited sort of

[42:08] personalized touch for the owner they started it with the SLE on Batman and he calls your name out

[42:14] why can't they do that with every fucking machine that's an Ellie you only got to do it for 500

[42:19] people and for all the money they're spending I think they deserve personalized touches and it's

[42:24] not hard it is not hard to just code an extra mode in a game and get Ellie owners a different

[42:31] experience that makes them feel a little bit more special versus just the cosmetic things that

[42:37] separate these games like make the gameplay different all right I'm sorry I'm a little upset

[42:43] I gotta get to work I gotta run out soon all right I'm gonna end this show pretty soon I'm gonna

[42:49] say that I played monsters I want to give my thoughts on it monsters Ellie I'll say this in a short

[42:53] little review of monsters Ellie because Surgeon I played it the game shoots really fun it's fast

[43:00] you can jump right into it without even knowing what to do stuff is happening it's pretty easy to

[43:05] figure out like a multi ball you just shoot Herman and it locks the ball on the magnet and then it

[43:10] releases it and even if you drain it then releases it into a multi ball the lower play field it's

[43:17] neat I will say that it's a little like it's a little numbing when you're down there because you

[43:21] can't feel anything I do think they need a shaker mode that every time you hit a shot on the lower

[43:27] play field it gives you a little bit of a shake because I think the the lack of feel even when

[43:34] you hit the button is is is there maybe there's a little shake that happens because we're just so used

[43:39] to when we when we hit the flipper button you can physically feel the vibration of the flipper

[43:44] through the game and there's a sense of doing something when you do the lower play field on the

[43:48] monsters it's completely numbing because there's absolutely no sensation both in feel and you know

[43:55] and even I don't know like even in sound I don't know there's something about it like it just feels like

[44:00] very sort of numb if that's a good word will the novelty wear off I don't know I think it's cool to

[44:05] have it down there it was interesting that the lower play field on the one at sunshine the the the

[44:11] the glass above it was fogged up so no one you know kind of like old school acdc fogging up on on

[44:17] the lower play field the glass but you can you can unscrew that and clean that but that was just

[44:21] interesting to see it like that um okay I have I have to run to work I love you guys thank you

[44:27] for keep tuning in and listening to me rant about pinball we'll have more guests coming on soon

[44:33] and and we'll go from there all right lots of other news to talk about riot pinball trying to

[44:37] come up with another machine sure sure it's all we need we just need more pinball there's not

[44:42] enough there's as if there's not enough great games inboxes right now that need sales we still have

[44:47] so many new boutique still making stuff I I don't get it if you're riot pinball why are why are
