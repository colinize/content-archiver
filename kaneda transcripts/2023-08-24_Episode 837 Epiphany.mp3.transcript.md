[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Femball Podcast.

[00:18] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:19] I called this episode Epiphany because I think every once in a while you gotta kind

[00:24] of take a break, take a pause, think about everything you're doing, think about everything

[00:28] you're saying, and just evaluate, like why am I doing a pinball podcast?

[00:32] Why am I talking about this hobby we all love?

[00:35] And why do I take the approach I take in pinball podcasting?

[00:38] And look, I've been doing this now for over eight years.

[00:42] I have a very good finger on the pulse of this hobby, of the community, of these companies,

[00:47] of these distributors, of these fans, everything about pinball.

[00:51] I've seen it all.

[00:52] I've been to all the shows.

[00:53] I've played almost all of the games.

[00:55] We're gonna talk about that in a little bit.

[00:57] And I do a podcast about pinball because they banned me from Pinside like eight years ago.

[01:03] Now when you do 830-something podcast about pinball, of course you're gonna get repetitive.

[01:10] Of course there's only so much news.

[01:12] I always say this.

[01:13] There's like five days out of the year where there is legitimate pinball news.

[01:18] And then you think about the amount of content people are making around those five days.

[01:24] And that's why it's a lot of fun to speculate what's around the corner.

[01:27] I'm super excited to see what's next from Keith Elwin.

[01:30] I'm super excited to see if Steve Ritchie can really deliver a home run over at Jersey

[01:34] Jack Pinball.

[01:35] I'm so excited to see what's next from Mark Ritchie after Pulp Fiction.

[01:40] It's coming.

[01:41] His game is done.

[01:42] His next game is done over at CGC and Play Mechanics.

[01:44] I'm super excited to see what Barry has cooking up over at Dutch Pinball.

[01:48] Does he have the matrix?

[01:50] We're gonna talk a little bit about Barry on this episode.

[01:53] And that's what makes pinball so exciting is every few months a company gets to show

[01:57] us what they deem to be is a great pinball machine.

[02:02] I don't know how to make pinball machines.

[02:04] I don't know how to run a manufacturing company.

[02:06] I don't know how to draw a play field art package or a cabinet art package.

[02:10] I'm good at what I do in marketing, you know, but I would be a terrible pinball company.

[02:14] But I do believe I can make good decisions if I was out of pinball company because that's

[02:19] what's really weird about this hobby to me is after all of these years and all of these

[02:24] decades, it's so obvious what a good game is.

[02:27] It's so obvious what you need to put into a good game.

[02:31] I would say like seven or eight out of every new machine we get is not as good as previous

[02:36] machines we've had.

[02:38] And as the prices keep climbing up and up and up, I think there needs to be a little

[02:42] bit of a voice of reason.

[02:44] You don't listen to my show and hear a bunch of advertisements for vendors or distributors

[02:49] or for games.

[02:50] You don't.

[02:51] You can turn on other podcasts and they'll do that.

[02:53] You can listen to other pinball personalities and they're always super excited and shilling

[02:57] everything happening in the hobby.

[02:59] And look, that's their prerogative and that's fine.

[03:01] I think the world needs those sort of everything is awesome cheerleaders.

[03:06] But we also just need a counterpoint.

[03:08] And that's why I love doing Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[03:10] But let me get back to why I call this show Epiphany.

[03:12] I got a nice letter from Pinball Mania 2023.

[03:16] I'm not sure who this is, but it's Pinball Mania and he says, Dear Canada.

[03:20] And the subject of his email to me was mocking others losing money on games.

[03:25] Wow.

[03:26] Okay.

[03:27] I'm not sure I mock people.

[03:28] Well, we'll talk about this, but he wrote to me said, Dear Canada, just some general

[03:30] feedback on how you are regularly mocking others losing money on games.

[03:35] For one, it's not cool to do and in poor taste.

[03:38] Two, many of us new and box buyers don't care if we lose 1000 or even $3,000 on these

[03:44] games.

[03:45] Okay, I'm just going to stop right there.

[03:46] Who out there amongst you does not care if you lose $3,000 on a pinball machine?

[03:51] Who wants to lose $3,000 on a pinball machine?

[03:54] You don't have to lose $3,000 on a pinball machine if the prices didn't go up 40%.

[03:58] He writes, No money is made or lost unless you sell a game.

[04:01] That is true.

[04:02] One game price for a fast sale doesn't mean every game of that title is now worth that

[04:07] amount.

[04:08] That is also true.

[04:09] He then goes on to write, Our collections don't represent our 401ks and other retirement

[04:14] funds.

[04:15] You have clearly mentioned things about buying Gucci clothing that is a worse investment

[04:19] than new pinball machines with terrible resale value, but no one is bringing that up.

[04:23] Well, look, you're right.

[04:25] Buying Gucci buying high end fashion is a terrible investment.

[04:28] Nobody buys clothes as an investment and most people are not buying clothes worth thousands

[04:34] of dollars.

[04:35] Now the thing is this, if you're going to go buy like Gucci and Louis Vuitton, you're

[04:38] Louis Vuitton makes more in one year than pinball has made in its entire history.

[04:42] LVMH is the most valuable company in Europe.

[04:45] Think about that.

[04:46] They're worth more than Mercedes Benz.

[04:47] You buy something because you just want to enjoy it.

[04:49] And I get the same is true about pinball, but clothes in pinball are not the same thing

[04:53] because when you buy clothes, you tend to keep them.

[04:56] You tend to wear them to you, wear them out, and then you move on.

[04:59] And most people are not buying high end fashion.

[05:01] For the people who do buy high end fashion, they absolutely know that they are buying

[05:06] something that they are never going to see that money again.

[05:08] And they know that going into the transaction.

[05:11] But in pinball, it's different.

[05:12] Pinball is different because we move pinballs in and out of our homes more often.

[05:16] We are more likely to want to trade in the pinball marketplace.

[05:19] And I'll tell you this, what's great about fashion, if you like fashion, I think most

[05:23] of you out there don't.

[05:24] I've seen the way you guys dress at the shows and it's okay.

[05:26] It's okay.

[05:27] I love the fact that I have such an eclectic group of friends.

[05:30] I have friends that dress in super high end fashion who have $100,000 watches on.

[05:35] And then I have friends who just wear cargo shorts and t-shirts and they're both happy.

[05:39] And that's all everybody ever should be.

[05:41] If you're waking up, trust me, if you're waking up and you're in a good mood,

[05:45] you are winning in life.

[05:47] That is all that matters.

[05:48] Nothing else matters.

[05:49] It doesn't matter what I say, what other people say.

[05:52] If you in your personal decisions are waking up in a good mood, you are winning on planet earth.

[05:58] And to wake up in a good mood though, you probably have to be on top of your finances.

[06:02] You probably have to be surrounded by some friends and family that you love.

[06:07] And you probably have to be doing something with your life that you're proud of.

[06:11] And that will put you in a good mood.

[06:13] And every single moment we have on this planet, and I learned this the hard way this past

[06:17] year by losing two things that meant so much to me and two people that meant so much to

[06:21] me, every single moment we have is impermanent.

[06:25] It's not going to last.

[06:26] And that's why I am so happy I can do this podcast.

[06:29] And for just a sliver of your existence, you get to listen to Canada talk about pinball

[06:34] and I think it's fun and I think it's entertaining.

[06:36] But for those of you out there who do like fashion, here's the good news.

[06:39] You can go on all these like secondhand sites like Grail and RealReal and get high end fashion

[06:44] for pennies to the dollar.

[06:46] That's what I do now.

[06:47] I don't walk into brick and mortar anymore and pay retail prices.

[06:50] Now in pinball, that's not true.

[06:51] This is the thing about pinball.

[06:52] When you want to buy a pinball machine secondhand, the secondhand market has gone through the

[06:57] roof.

[06:58] These still things were living in a COVID error marketplace for pinball and it's getting

[07:02] crazy.

[07:03] But let me go on and read the rest of what pinball mania said.

[07:05] He writes, I just heard that over 3000 new Dodge demons are being made.

[07:09] Will the value of existing ones tank?

[07:12] Will they be less desirable?

[07:14] Should people mock others for buying the original?

[07:16] No.

[07:17] So please just stop being so negative all the time.

[07:21] Don't mock buyers with larger collections.

[07:23] Not everyone is in this hobby to break even or make a profit.

[07:27] Overall message.

[07:28] Please do better and be more positive as when you are more positive, I think you are the

[07:33] best pinball podcaster out there.

[07:36] Being critical of the companies is fine and welcomed.

[07:39] Just don't do that to the buyers of these games.

[07:42] Finally, stop telling everyone to wait and see.

[07:45] You can't wait and see forever, but that seems to be your message over and over again for

[07:50] years.

[07:51] People are going to buy games they want.

[07:53] It's their money.

[07:54] Let them do what they want with it.

[07:56] Wow.

[07:57] I love getting this kind of feedback from my fans and from the community.

[08:02] Stop telling people to wait and see.

[08:04] Well, look, I'm not going to stop telling people to wait and see, but yes, have I been

[08:07] saying it maybe too much?

[08:09] Absolutely.

[08:10] Have I been beating a dead horse with that message?

[08:12] Yes.

[08:13] And the reason why, and I want to explain why I am encouraging everybody to wait and see

[08:15] because I think telling people to wait and see is actually looking out for the community.

[08:21] I'm trying to save people money and I don't think that's a bad thing.

[08:26] Now look, I don't know who Pimbalmania is, but thank you for the note.

[08:29] It does sound like he probably has a large collection.

[08:32] It does sound like he probably is well off financially and it does sound like he wants

[08:37] Canada to be more positive.

[08:39] Now look, I think we can take this note from Pimbalmania and I think I can reflect on what

[08:43] he's saying and I think I can make this show more positive.

[08:47] I'm willing to do that.

[08:48] I'm willing to not be so negative and down and out.

[08:51] And look, I get it.

[08:52] I get when I get caught in a little bit of a cycle where I'm just ragging on haggis

[08:56] or I'm ragging on American Pimbal.

[08:58] And I love ragging on companies when they make boneheaded decisions.

[09:02] You know why I love doing it?

[09:03] Because nobody else is doing it.

[09:04] Nobody else is doing it.

[09:05] Everybody else will interview Dennis Norman and wants to hear his story about why he made

[09:10] Galactic Tank Force.

[09:11] And I'm like, well, I don't really care.

[09:12] I don't really care.

[09:13] You made the game.

[09:14] You finished the game.

[09:15] You put it in a box.

[09:16] I got to play it.

[09:17] I've seen other people play it.

[09:19] And I don't think it's worth 8,000 or 11,5 or 17,5.

[09:22] I think after 30 years of all these great Pimbal machines from Bali Williams to today,

[09:28] if you're going to drop Galactic Tank Force out into the Pimbal world, the only people

[09:32] that are going to buy this original theme, no Pimbal very well, no one's going to be

[09:36] fooled by it.

[09:37] And what was the point?

[09:38] Right?

[09:39] What was the point of spending three years making a game that almost nobody wants?

[09:42] Why would you do that with Mukesh's money?

[09:45] Why would you do that with someone else's dollar?

[09:47] And that's the thing is like, I'm not going to stop being that canada.

[09:49] But what I can do is just ease off the throttle a little bit and I get it.

[09:53] And I'm probably overdoing it.

[09:55] And the reason why I overdo the wait and see stuff is simply when I listen to everybody

[09:59] else.

[10:00] Everybody else is shilling for these companies and I don't understand why.

[10:05] We are never going to get better Pimbal machines that wow us if we do a plaza and cheerlead

[10:12] and do jumping jacks with every new game that comes out.

[10:16] Now here's the thing.

[10:17] This is why I think I've been more negative than I want to be is simply this.

[10:20] I'm not happy because I'm not able to play most of these new games.

[10:25] And I'm being honest about that.

[10:27] Like I have not been able to play Godfather at all.

[10:30] In New York City where the Godfather takes place, there are zero Godfather games on location.

[10:37] Now whose fault is that?

[10:39] Are you telling me Jersey Jack Pimbal can't find an operator in freaking New York City

[10:45] where there's 16 million people?

[10:47] There are hundreds and hundreds of potential buyers in this area.

[10:52] You can't put one game into a location.

[10:56] You can't find one place to just drop it.

[10:59] It could be in Barcade.

[11:00] It could be at Jack Bar.

[11:02] And here's the thing.

[11:03] I know the operators don't really want it because they don't want a game that's not

[11:06] going to earn as well as a stern machine or is going to have more complications.

[11:10] So I can't play Godfather.

[11:12] So I'm still just talking about a game now for five, six months where I don't even have

[11:15] any time on the machine.

[11:16] I have no time on Galactic Tank Force.

[11:19] There's none of those in New York City.

[11:20] There's no Scooby-Doo's in New York City.

[11:23] So all of these new games are coming out and I barely get any time on them.

[11:27] And so yeah, I would love to play these games more often.

[11:30] But what I'm not going to do is buy them to play them.

[11:33] I'm not going to buy them to play them.

[11:35] None of these games look like games I ever want to own or would spend this much money

[11:39] on, but I still just want to enjoy them.

[11:42] And so it's been hard.

[11:43] I mean, New York City, you know, New York City, when it comes to pinball, is terrible.

[11:47] It's absolutely terrible.

[11:48] We don't get the new pins.

[11:49] We don't.

[11:50] We're going to get Venom over at Jack Bar pretty soon.

[11:52] But other than that, it's a dry zone for pinball.

[11:55] I'll tell you this.

[11:56] I stay up late some nights being like, I should just open up a pinball place in New York City,

[11:59] right?

[12:00] If New York City prices weren't so expensive, I would open up a pinball bar tomorrow.

[12:04] But no, I mean, I've seen them come and go, a pinball place will not keep you in business

[12:09] in New York City.

[12:10] I mean, modern pinball was just like burning money every month.

[12:13] But that's been my thing lately is I just want to jump on these new machines and I don't

[12:17] want to jump on an airplane to have to play them.

[12:19] Now look, here's the thing.

[12:20] I've got 600 or something club members.

[12:23] I've got 3000 people, 3000 people that are fans of Canada's Facebook page.

[12:28] Now I know more people are listening to this show right now and some of you are listening

[12:32] right now and you didn't pay for it.

[12:33] Some of you are logging in illegally and to you cheapskates out there, I say, hey, I

[12:38] think you should be ashamed of yourselves.

[12:40] It's five dollars a month and you're enjoying this show and you're not paying for it.

[12:44] I think you're lame and I think you should join the show.

[12:47] Okay.

[12:48] But here's the truth.

[12:49] Canada has some influence in the pinball space.

[12:51] Do I have a ton of influence?

[12:52] I think I have enough influence to change the narrative on a game for a few hundred people.

[12:58] Absolutely.

[12:59] I also think my show is popular because when I make my point of view on a game, it's like

[13:02] a lot of you agree, right?

[13:03] I'm not like coming out of left field being like, oh, Godzilla sucks.

[13:06] Like, you know what I'm saying?

[13:08] Like that would be the greatest clickbait headline ever.

[13:10] Keith Owen is overrated.

[13:12] Like you don't see headlines like that.

[13:14] If I wanted to really clickbait you and be negative, you would hear me say stuff like

[13:18] that, but I don't.

[13:19] I think I call it like it is.

[13:21] Like even my own Guns N' Roses, I will tell you right now, do I think the Guns N' Roses

[13:25] gameplay is pretty bad?

[13:26] Yeah, it's not the best gameplay.

[13:28] Does it feel like chopping wood with all the multi-balls?

[13:31] Absolutely.

[13:32] Is it still my favorite band?

[13:34] Yes.

[13:34] Will I ever sell my 500 Guns N' Roses CE?

[13:37] No.

[13:38] I will keep that machine my entire life because it means more to me than the money.

[13:42] It's about the band I grew up with singing, pretending I was Axel Rose in the mirror for

[13:48] like 10 years of my life, people.

[13:50] It's not easy doing this show every week and saying something that you know is a little

[13:54] bit contentious.

[13:55] It's going to rub certain people the wrong way.

[13:58] Friends come and go when it comes to my friends in the pinball hobby.

[14:01] And that's just the natural way of...

[14:03] I saw something in the elevator that said the ideal amount of friends you need in life

[14:07] to be happy is three to five.

[14:09] Okay, three to five.

[14:10] And I've definitely got that.

[14:11] And I know you probably have that too.

[14:13] So I don't need to be friends with everybody.

[14:15] I don't make anybody listen to my content.

[14:18] I don't force anyone to join my Facebook page, but people just decided that they enjoy the

[14:22] content and I'm really happy that you do.

[14:24] But I definitely have some influence.

[14:26] And here's the thing that's funny to me.

[14:28] With all of the influence I have, with all the fans I have, because think about it, like

[14:32] let's just say like 10% of my Facebook page or half of you are really going to latch on

[14:37] to like an opinion I have about a game.

[14:39] And I get you're going to make your own opinions, but you know, it's hard to get people's opinions

[14:43] out of your head.

[14:44] Like we read movie reviews for a reason.

[14:46] We read restaurant reviews for a reason.

[14:49] And that's why it's important for pinball companies to control the narrative whenever

[14:53] they release a game.

[14:54] I mean, that's basic marketing.

[14:56] And that is why it is funny to me that pinball companies, they don't even approach me.

[15:00] They put me in a corner like I'm some sort of black sheep.

[15:02] And it's fine.

[15:03] I like being there because I'm free, but it doesn't help them any.

[15:06] It only helps me.

[15:07] And I'm always open to building bridges between myself and pinball companies.

[15:11] I have really good friendships with some people very high up in organizations like Stern.

[15:16] You just don't know it.

[15:17] I don't talk about it.

[15:18] I don't reveal what those private conversations are because they're private and I have intimate

[15:22] conversations with some of the top brass there.

[15:24] And right now they're scrabbly trying to figure out who that is.

[15:27] But it's a good thing.

[15:28] It's a healthy thing.

[15:29] And I've met a few of my best friends in life through pinball.

[15:32] And that's a good thing.

[15:32] But I am always open to your feedback.

[15:34] I'm always open to your criticisms.

[15:36] You know, I got another note and I love getting notes like this.

[15:39] I got this note yesterday at 828 in the morning from Felipe says, Hi, Chris, just wanted to

[15:45] raise my membership to express my gratitude for the work you do.

[15:49] I drive a lot to commute here in France, Switzerland border.

[15:52] And your podcast has a good place in my trip.

[15:55] So thanks again for the hard work and keep up the good spirits.

[15:58] Cheers, Felipe.

[16:00] You know, I love stuff like this.

[16:01] I love that I am part of your impermanent world for just a little bit of time.

[16:06] I don't care what anybody says about me.

[16:08] I don't.

[16:08] I fight my own battles.

[16:10] I make my own show and I'm free to do what I want on these airwaves.

[16:13] And I'm going to keep doing it.

[16:14] I'm going to keep doing it.

[16:15] I don't do it for the Twippies anymore.

[16:17] I used to.

[16:18] I used to need that accolade, but six years in a row.

[16:20] And I still think we're going to win a seventh year in a row because all I've got to do is put

[16:24] up six free shows or seven free shows.

[16:27] And then we eligible and then those 3000 people and the 600 of you.

[16:31] If I just get all of you to vote, we win.

[16:33] I mean, every year, that's what the numbers indicate.

[16:36] You know why it's hard to beat Canada?

[16:38] It's not just my show.

[16:39] It's not just my point of view.

[16:40] It's consistent and it's good.

[16:42] And you get it every single week.

[16:44] There are very few people that work really hard at pinball content creation that make good content.

[16:49] And I mean that that make good content.

[16:51] You know who they are.

[16:53] Jason Knapp is one of them.

[16:54] Zach Many is one of them.

[16:55] Greg Bone is one of them.

[16:57] Loser Kid Pinball Podcast is one of them.

[16:59] Bro, do you even talk pinball is one of them.

[17:01] Silverball Chronicles is one of them.

[17:04] You know who they are.

[17:04] And I have nothing but respect for those people who make really good content and are consistent at it.

[17:09] I enjoy Jengus' content in Denmark.

[17:11] I do.

[17:12] I like the way he talks about this hobby.

[17:14] And look, there's a lot of people that try to do this.

[17:16] There's a lot of people that want to mirror my style and drift off of the way I do my show.

[17:20] And they're never going to get there.

[17:22] You're never going to be able to mirror me.

[17:23] Everyone's got to find their own style.

[17:25] And I respect everybody who does it their way.

[17:28] And I know there's drama all the time in this hobby.

[17:30] Some of it is self-inflicted.

[17:32] Some of it just happens.

[17:33] So what?

[17:34] So what?

[17:35] Who cares?

[17:36] We're all grown adults talking about a super expensive toy.

[17:39] And so that's my thing.

[17:40] As I head into 2024, I just want to say that I am nothing but excited about pinball.

[17:46] And I think you should be too.

[17:47] And I know the prices are high and who cares?

[17:49] Because no one's going to make us buy any of these games unless they wow us.

[17:52] And that's exciting.

[17:53] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[17:54] And I mean it.

[17:55] I'm going to get the hype train going on this.

[17:57] I think Keith Owens game is going to be with Joe Kamnacow.

[18:00] I think it's going to be Jaws.

[18:01] I think it's going to blow us away.

[18:03] I think this game is going to be the game we all need.

[18:06] We haven't felt this way since Godzilla.

[18:08] Jaws is a theme that has more popularity with the pinball buying demographic.

[18:12] I think Jaws is going to crush.

[18:14] And I think Jaws is going to send a signal to everybody else.

[18:17] If you don't have a game as good as Jaws, as good as Godzilla,

[18:21] just stop making pinball machines.

[18:23] I think Barry is going to make a game that's as good as Jaws.

[18:26] I do.

[18:27] I think it's going to be the Matrix.

[18:28] I'm super excited.

[18:29] I think Mark Richie's next game is going to be bonkers.

[18:31] Great.

[18:32] I think it's going to be incredible.

[18:33] It's going to be harder for companies like Spooky to get your money unless they crush it.

[18:37] They need to get the game higher.

[18:39] They need to get their design to be as good as the artwork.

[18:41] That is Spooky's job to be done.

[18:43] If I were to march over there and first of all, congratulations, AJ on the baby over at Spooky Pinball.

[18:48] That is all that really matters.

[18:50] Family and the family we love and the family that we bring into this world.

[18:53] Your baby is adorable.

[18:55] So congratulations.

[18:56] Now, let me go back to saying something about Spooky.

[18:59] They need to get their design as good as their artwork.

[19:02] If I were to fly over to Benton, Wisconsin and walk through the door, I say, guys, we're so close.

[19:06] We're so close.

[19:07] You got everything else figured out.

[19:09] Like, you know how to make games.

[19:10] You know how to do it now.

[19:11] You know how to screw all the parts together, right?

[19:13] Now, the only thing left for us to do is get the design and the toys to where they need to be to justify these prices.

[19:20] And the way we're going to get there is we're going to hire somebody.

[19:22] All right, you're making the money now.

[19:24] Go hire someone else.

[19:26] Think about how sad it is that that other designer is just sitting idly over at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[19:30] He could be at Spooky.

[19:32] Mr. Satan, you know, the guy who made the Metroid homebrew game.

[19:34] What's he doing over there?

[19:35] Like, he's just sitting there with his hands in his pockets for years as we wait for his game.

[19:40] And it's not going to come out anytime soon.

[19:42] So like, it's just like, at least at Spooky, you'd see your new game out like every year.

[19:46] And look, what else?

[19:47] I don't think Haggis is going to get all these fathoms made.

[19:50] I don't think they're going to finish the Centaur run.

[19:52] And I think they're in big trouble.

[19:54] The reason why these boutiques that are not executing right now are going to be in big trouble is at these prices.

[20:00] Why would you even bother?

[20:01] Like, why would you bother buying a mediocre game if Keith Ellen is going to knock it out of the park?

[20:07] That's why nobody's buying Godfather.

[20:09] It just doesn't wow us.

[20:11] It's why nobody bought Toy Story 4 or Galactic Tank Force.

[20:15] And it's OK.

[20:16] It's OK to watch these companies put something in front of us.

[20:20] And as a community, we say, I'm not buying this.

[20:23] And we could say it with a smile.

[20:25] And I feel good because every time you say no, every time you say no, your checking account stays seven to 10 to $15,000.

[20:33] Just instantly stays in your checking account.

[20:35] And that's great.

[20:36] I don't know all your finances.

[20:38] I kind of think it would be funny to walk around a pinball show and everyone had a little bubble over their head that was like their net worth.

[20:45] I wouldn't want to walk near Bill Brandis.

[20:47] I wouldn't want to walk near Kim Mitchell.

[20:49] I wouldn't want to walk near Hector.

[20:50] I would feel so broke.

[20:52] I wouldn't want to walk next to Neil McCray.

[20:54] You know, I wouldn't want to walk next to my friend Robert Mooney or my friend Adam in New York City.

[20:58] I mean, look, some of you guys, God bless, I'm so happy that you've created such great personal wealth.

[21:03] I am never one to be spiteful or envious of anybody's success.

[21:06] I think it's great.

[21:07] I think the only people we learn from are successful people.

[21:10] The plague of society is people who hate on people who are successful.

[21:14] Who blame other people for their misfortune.

[21:17] Who look for the government for solutions.

[21:19] No, you got to pick yourself up by your bootstraps and make it happen for yourself.

[21:23] And those are the people, as I said, those are the people that wake up and are in the best mood.

[21:30] Can you tell them in a good mood?

[21:31] I like this feedback.

[21:32] Keep criticizing Canada.

[21:34] If you criticize me, it will only make me better.

[21:37] It will only make me stronger.

[21:38] So thank you, Pimball Mania 2023.

[21:41] Thank you, Felipe.

[21:42] And thank all of you for joining Canada's Pinball Podcast, because it really means the world to me that every week you tune in, we're still right around 603 or 4 or 5 club members.

[21:54] And for you guys freeloading on this show, come on, it's time.

[21:58] You know, it's time.

[21:58] You've got the money.

[21:59] Like I could go get a cup of coffee downstairs.

[22:02] That would be about $7.

[22:04] And you can't kick Canada $5 for years of the most entertaining Pinball podcast on planet Earth.

[22:10] And anyone that wants to try to mimic me, you're never going to make it.

[22:14] You're in the rearview mirror and no one's going to care because they got Canada and Canada going nowhere.

[22:18] Later, everybody.
