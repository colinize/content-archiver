[00:00] I created a monster, there's nobody wants to see more so more they want shady unchopped

[00:07] libel.

[00:08] Well if you want shady this is what I give you.

[00:09] A little bit of weed makes us some hot, they get some bark, I thought I jumped stock

[00:13] my heart quick and then a stock when I get dropped at the hospital by the doctor when

[00:16] I'm not cooperating when I'm rocking the table while he's operating.

[00:20] Yeah.

[00:21] Well it's Monday morning and you just can't start a new week without me.

[00:29] I'm going to show it in an episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:32] This is episode 174 I believe and it's going to be just a little bit of a news update

[00:39] and I have to do this before I even give my commentary on what's going on in the Pimball

[00:44] world and some stuff that's occurring that's newsworthy.

[00:47] I want to give a shout out to what I believe is probably the healthiest way to stay in the

[00:52] loop on this hobby and that is the website this week in Pimball.

[00:57] If you don't read this site and you are in the Pimball you should start reading this

[01:02] website because it tells you everything that's going on that's newsworthy and an update

[01:08] on all these manufacturers in such a simple concise way and here's the best part about

[01:13] it.

[01:14] It does it without all of the forum nonsense and all the drama and all the bickering

[01:19] back and forth.

[01:21] Have you ever found yourself when you're trying to just get the latest update on a company

[01:25] and you go into the thread and it's people arguing about like I don't really like 3D

[01:30] movies.

[01:31] I put brown sugar on my oatmeal.

[01:33] Why do you put bananas?

[01:35] It's like they do rail every thread so many times.

[01:40] So this website is what I go to for Pimball news now.

[01:43] It's actually made my life so much better because I can give my commentary on what's happening

[01:48] without spending hours plowing through threads and gibberish that happens on pin sight

[01:53] every day.

[01:55] So let's go down some of the news items that's going on.

[01:58] Obviously the big new game Guardians of the Galaxy there's just been a lot of back and

[02:02] forth back and forth on like what's going to be in the game what's not what's included

[02:07] on the Ellie what's the armor going to be is it left over W.W.E. armor and before I talk

[02:13] about this game I want to say that what I tried to do because last week I think I got

[02:18] it.

[02:19] It was like one of those Canadian moments where I was in the weeds I was like reacting

[02:24] emotionally to everything and I sort of spent the weekend just stepping back a little

[02:28] bit.

[02:29] And one of my friends was talking to me about any problems that you want to provide

[02:33] analysis on.

[02:35] You need to zoom out and look at the overall sort of context of where that problem lies.

[02:40] And yes I definitely think there are problems that I would like to see improved upon at

[02:46] Stern Pimball and how they reveal their games.

[02:49] But for the most part if we all step back and realize okay wait a minute we're talking

[02:54] about Pimball machines.

[02:56] Okay let's just start there.

[02:58] And we're talking about things about new Pimball machines that bother us right things that

[03:04] we would like to be better things that we're critiquing.

[03:08] Nobody is forcing any of us to buy anything right these are not essential items.

[03:12] This isn't a drug that I need to take to live.

[03:16] This isn't an air conditioning unit that you know will help me sleep at night without

[03:24] it I'd be up all summer sweating right.

[03:26] This is a Pimball machine that is simply a toy that is meant to bring joy and entertainment

[03:31] for many hours.

[03:33] And so you know it's a non essential.

[03:36] And if you look at the entire Pimball category and you look at all the players in the Pimball

[03:41] hobby over the last let's just say five years the majority of companies have taken people's

[03:48] money have lied to people have not delivered product.

[03:53] So say what you will about Stern and I have my criticisms and I'm going to talk about

[03:57] some of those criticisms on this podcast but Stern has never robbed anybody of their

[04:03] money.

[04:04] So just in that in that checklist of like who is who is taking money from consumers and

[04:09] given them nothing.

[04:10] There are a lot of companies that fall into that category skip B, J-Pop, Dutch Pimball,

[04:16] Highway Pimball.

[04:18] Didn't people pay for the Pimball circus prototypes?

[04:22] I think they did the 12 or sold.

[04:25] The list goes on and on and on.

[04:27] And so then you have Stern you know Jersey Jack took people's money took him a long time

[04:32] but now Jersey Jack is over on the other side of that fence which is good.

[04:37] So you have all these companies that have made broken promises that didn't deliver and

[04:42] you know so Stern Pimball who constantly delivers but delivers games that are never really

[04:48] fully complete and it's like that's the two major options you really have in this hobby.

[04:53] If you want to get consistent new product your only choice of consistent new stuff is

[05:00] Stern and that's why Stern being the category leader will get the lion share of the feedback

[05:06] and the insults and the adoration and the agony and the ecstasy that goes along with

[05:11] selling people a toy that they want to love.

[05:15] Right?

[05:16] This product makes everyone into children like we all behave a little bit much more juvenile

[05:22] than we would in other areas of our life because it's like I want to have my toy be the

[05:26] best toy possible.

[05:28] And I understand I understand why people get really passionate about it.

[05:31] It's why we love this hobby though too right?

[05:34] You know it'd be kind of lame if we collected I saw this documentary once or 60 minutes

[05:39] special where people collected washer machines and got together to talk about washer machines

[05:44] and people some guy in his home had like 50 washer machines.

[05:47] Okay no that's not really fun to go over and watch someone pour some soap in and turn

[05:53] the cycle on but Pimball is a sport that is fun it is fun to collect it is fun to go

[05:58] over and see people's collections and talk about the games right?

[06:01] So that is the context of where Guardians of the Galaxy comes out.

[06:05] Now if you look at the last few years of Stern releases here's my big issue here's my

[06:10] big issue and I've tried to sort of come at this from different angles but the main

[06:15] issue I'm seeing right now is Stern is they just can never make up their mind what they

[06:20] want to go into each game and I think the reason why as a customer I see them as constantly

[06:28] going like all over the place on what's going to be included in an Ellie how many Ellie's

[06:33] will there be what's the difference between a pro and a premium it's pretty clear why

[06:38] they make every decision they make and I've said this in some in ways sometimes that might

[06:44] have been unfair when I say they're profit driven not passion driven.

[06:49] Okay now the truth is the truth is it's probably somewhere in the middle but the reality is

[06:56] if you're not profit driven you'll go out of business and everyone else in this hobby

[07:02] Andrew highway what happened to him he was this communicator that you guys bought everyone

[07:07] of his lies you gave him your money and he went out of business he ran out of money

[07:12] bearing the opposite thing they showed what I believe still to be one of the greatest

[07:16] pinball machines of all time they took your money they rolled around expo like rock stars

[07:21] you paid for your game and what happened they went out of business they lost their money

[07:26] jersey jack he put everything he could into the machine right he went bigger or he was

[07:31] going to go home and what happened they ran out of money twice and pretty much jjp went

[07:36] bankrupt two times so if all of the reality of running a business came to fruition it would

[07:43] only be stern and spooky right now there would be nobody else right American pinball hasn't

[07:49] taken anyone's money they haven't broken anyone's promise with them but as Josh said in

[07:54] the interview they need to sell a lot of games to keep that company in business with the

[07:59] amount of stuff they're putting in Houdini for $7000 so if you really want to show your support

[08:05] for start a pinball companies that are giving you the most bang for your buck then don't

[08:10] just type it on pinside go buy a Houdini and show these guys they did it right because

[08:15] that's what you've been asking for all these years so stern makes every single new release

[08:21] and new reveal they make a decision about what that game is going to have based upon the

[08:26] bomb right the bill of materials and and where the profit lies it's the reason why when

[08:32] you look at a game like star wars they spent a lot on that license in the game with the

[08:38] re reveal is very underwhelming the game is very stripped down there's no denying that

[08:42] star wars doesn't have a lot in it okay I'm not arguing the merits of whether it's fun or

[08:47] not okay so then they have 800 star wars total nostalgic game I don't think they sold out

[08:53] all 800 which again is a testament to how underwhelmed people are by by that title okay other

[09:00] you know other games like Ghostbusters 400 Ellie's much more nostalgic title what they would

[09:07] sold 600 Ghostbusters Ellie's right Batman very nostalgic sold out Ellie's you know 240 of those

[09:13] but if you look at now Guardians the Galaxy is an interesting reveal because it's not really an

[09:19] nostalgic game right the the property's not that old where people reminisce about that property

[09:25] when they were kid now I was talking you know I'm gonna give credit to Ryan I know he's doing a

[09:30] podcast with Marty today and they haven't put it up yet it's what you get Marty if you get drunk

[09:35] and Ryan gives me something juicy that you guys talked about now it this but this makes sense

[09:40] and the reason why people are bummed out about the music and guardians because guardians of the

[09:45] galaxy the reason why that movie was awesome it was a mix up of modern future space adventure with

[09:52] music from the 80s right it's kind of like the way puff daddy built his empire remember he just

[09:56] he just remade old songs in a modern context and that's what that movie did and that's why people

[10:03] loved the movie so much because the soundtrack when you went to go see Guardians and you had no

[10:07] idea about the awesome like mix tape you it it it made it gave so much personality and made that

[10:15] movie so special and so that's where the nostalgia lies and that's what head to head pinball we'll

[10:21] talk about the nostalgia lies in the music of Guardians with you remove that from the pinball

[10:27] machine and you remove the emotional nostalgic draw people had to that franchise and to that sort of

[10:34] property because it I mean really it was like a very original movie that transported us back because

[10:39] of what it did with music and I don't think removing the music is a negotiable thing I think it's

[10:45] a mandatory element if you're going to make that that game come to life via pinball okay so here's

[10:51] where we are you know November 6th Monday here's the reality of the Guardians reveal because I want

[10:56] to clarify some things and I want to share some of my opinions on what's what's happening okay you

[11:01] know I've been arguing about the W W D leftover armor this and that this and that look the truth is

[11:08] yes the armor they're using is probably left over armor from WWE we're never going to get an

[11:14] exact word on that it is growing on some people some people hated it's subjective I'm not going

[11:22] to argue about it anymore okay now they showed that Instagram photo of the laser etched armor and I

[11:29] got excited and maybe jump the gun removing the podcast or I was like well they've listened to us

[11:33] now they're going to give the Ellie some nicer laser etched armor the way they laser etched the armor

[11:38] on some of their games like AC DC and and Game of Thrones and whatnot nope I was wrong that armor

[11:45] will be sold separately it will be I believe it's $250 and you will be able to order it in

[11:52] in the gold color you'll be able to order it in the black color and it'll be something that you can

[11:58] put on you know a pro or a premium or an Ellie okay so it's available to everybody and that is a

[12:07] decision by Stern because you know look they're gonna make money selling this nicer armor it's

[12:10] what people will want I think again I don't want to jump what my overall opinion is but it's just

[12:17] again everything to me chips away at buying an Ellie because I just think the Ellie's now become

[12:24] the the ultimate like compromise that you have to sort of justify it okay so that is that

[12:31] now the music is now being heralded as a confirmation from straight down the middle podcast

[12:37] and the YouTube show love the show that two licensed tracks will be in the game and I will tell you

[12:43] as of today Monday November 6th that is not confirmed the deal is not done I don't even know where

[12:49] they got that information from but from from what I'm hearing from Stern that is not that is not

[12:55] a confirmation that songs will be in the game so people should stop congratulating and saying they

[13:01] did it because as of today there are no two tracks confirmed if they had confirmed music in the game

[13:09] they would have announced it it would have been part of the reveal you know when you're revealing

[13:14] something to the world that is when Stern is like going to the media they're going to journalists

[13:18] are telling everyone here's why you should buy this game because remember the order books open

[13:23] up immediately do you think they would leave out the fact that they had two songs in the game

[13:28] and not put that as part of the reasons why you should buy it right I think the the description

[13:33] of what's in the game in a not even like in a clandestine way but it just it it's just sucks when

[13:39] you go down the feature list and there's no songs right okay so that is where we are at today

[13:45] you also will get the full RGB LEDs throughout the entire game with both the premium and the LE the

[13:53] inserts will all be clear which is awesome the game is going to look incredible now the other

[14:01] question the big question the major question that always sort of piggybacks any new Stern reveal is

[14:08] what condition will the code be in I'm here to tell you today I know for a fact the code will not

[14:15] be done but that's not surprising right anyone telling you that Stern's going to launch a game with

[14:20] incomplete code it you would be more shocked if I if I told you the code was complete we have not

[14:26] seen what anything looks like on that LCD screen yet other than that retro style Stern logo

[14:32] how complete will the code be what will the interface look like because remember with these LCDs

[14:39] what's up there does matter it changes the overall experience of the game so we're waiting to see

[14:44] what happens there but here we are and my overall point is this is I could spend you know three to

[14:53] four podcasts a week I could constantly nitpick the reality of what it means to buy a Stern pinball

[14:59] machine but I think all of us should do ourselves a favor and just realize this is what it is it is

[15:06] what it is these are the options that are before us in the pinball hobby today if you want a new

[15:15] inbox game and you want to buy something that is fully complete and and it's got like great code

[15:21] and and and and it's almost like done you then you should go buy today you should go buy a game like

[15:28] dialed in which is on code 1.50 there's also a bunch of Stern games where the code is done you should

[15:35] go buy an ACDC premium right now vault edition ACDC because the code is done the game is proven to

[15:43] be a great game people love it you won't have any headaches if you open up that game I would stay away

[15:51] from the games that are incomplete that we've never seen flip that you don't know if you're even

[15:57] going to like it for though the only reason to go in early on a theme is just so you get the

[16:04] early version of a theme you love because they will make the premiums of all these machines for years

[16:11] which leads me to my ultimate point about Stern doesn't know how to handle limited edition

[16:19] machines they really don't they they it's kind of funny because they got away with a lot of

[16:25] BS with some of these other early machines simply because the hype was so big on those nostalgic

[16:31] properties it didn't really matter what they what they did the games just sold out I've always said

[16:37] like I believe Star Wars was the turning point but they didn't sell out of Aerosmith Ellie they

[16:42] there's a lot of Ellie versions of Stern machines that don't sell out but they look at the Ellie

[16:48] now as sort of this it's just like a necessary thing to do to stay true to their three tier system but

[16:58] you know there's there are some things that are in the Ellie that you would just want like

[17:02] everybody would want a mirrored backlash translate that used to be something that wasn't just an

[17:08] Ellie thing it was just something that was in Pimball they know that everybody would love to have

[17:14] a shaker mode or in a game you know the Ellie still don't come with the Invisi glass

[17:20] the Ellie's don't come with any other features of like gameplay right so it's like there's

[17:24] absolutely nothing between an Ellie and a premium other than cosmetic things and that's fine

[17:29] I think with Guardians they overshot the number I think 600 is too many I think it's it's always

[17:36] the Stern's benefit that Ellie's sell out quickly and I think the marketing department at Stern

[17:42] should get the number when you get the number spot on the game is sold out within like 48 hours I

[17:48] think to them that's a win I think not selling out of an Ellie is a marketing mistake because

[17:53] remember it's not most people don't need the Ellie and you always want those Ellie's to not just

[17:59] be in demand on day one or two you do want those Ellie's to hold their value over the years you

[18:05] know similar to the way porches special models of their cars they almost just keep going up in value

[18:10] simply because of the number of that they made but Stern you know I don't think they care that much

[18:17] about it I think you know it's a little bit of an arbitrary moving target probably where they put

[18:22] the number on these Ellie's because Guardians is not sold out if you want one you can go get one

[18:28] the thing that I wish Stern would do more of and it's you know I give Stern credit for making so

[18:33] many games for bringing all these themes to life the Stern's big issue is just always communication

[18:39] it's November 6th and people got emails from their distributors basically asking them to lock

[18:46] in their spots on Guardians Ellie Premiere Pro now the part that's frustrating is this as of today

[18:52] we still don't know for sure what all the features of the game will be and we still haven't seen

[18:59] any gameplay video and we still they can't just tell us like what's going on like and that's

[19:05] that's my oh that's my big issue with Stern is like why can't you talk to your customers and

[19:10] just say hey we're trying to get some music in hey like you know we're gonna offer nice or armor

[19:16] or hey like where's the where's the Star Wars topper or is there going to be a topper for game

[19:21] of thrones because that topper might bring the whole package together that makes someone go in and

[19:26] buy it and by not showing everything I think it really creates an environment of speculation of

[19:34] anxiety am I making the right decision should I wait is there going to be more they add to it

[19:40] that would have made me want to get that version versus this version and and and you just don't

[19:46] know and I wish they would just stop doing that because you know it's it's it's it's not a

[19:52] ginormous complaint but I think it always makes their customers feel like buying a new in box

[19:58] Stern pinball machine just isn't a lot of fun because you don't feel like you have any control

[20:04] you don't feel like you can even like control or customize what goes into your game you don't

[20:09] feel like you have any control over the information you would like to know to make the best decision

[20:16] purchase possible now I hope Stern listens to a podcast like this and take some of these things

[20:22] into consideration Zach Sharp who's their new marketing man over there Zach needs to make an

[20:29] impact in this area he if if I were him on day one of my marketing job at Stern I would say look

[20:37] if I look at like the marketplace and I look at where is their opportunity to make more money

[20:45] or get more repeat purchases if I were him I would say look guys we've pushed too far

[20:51] we've made the people that love to buy every new in box Stern now anxious about doing that

[20:58] and here are the reasons why we've done that and at the top of that list is lack of communication

[21:05] I would say it's lack of code updates and support of these games it does feel a lot like

[21:11] the MO over there is hyped that a lot of a game in the first month it's out and then cut

[21:17] bait on it and move on to the next because we've already got the money in the bank we don't need

[21:21] to continue supporting it let's move on to the next few titles that are coming out and it's a

[21:26] never-ending cycle you know if I were him I would really try to make an impact there and communication

[21:31] is everything you know when I look at the Batman 66 code debacle it's not that it's taking

[21:37] Lyman forever it's the fact that he's not communicating what he's doing I'll say this about

[21:43] all pinball fans and all pinball collectors as long as they feel like they know what's going on

[21:49] they're okay with waiting it's the lack of communication that leads to speculation that leads to

[21:56] rumors that are on true that makes it really hard you know if you tell me look

[22:01] enjoy your game it's gonna take us a year to get the code where we wanted it to be we had to get

[22:06] this game out to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the company in the 50th of the movie

[22:11] or the TV series you know I could live with that I could live with that but to then tell people

[22:17] you're gonna get new code every two weeks and then a year goes by and then that's happened

[22:21] that's what makes the pain and that's what makes the agony real for people as they feel like they were

[22:27] not not like lied to maybe lied to but they they just didn't get the information that is accurate

[22:32] I know it's hard it's hard being stern because you're trying I'm not trying to code all these games

[22:37] at the same time and you look around you and the rest of the industry is is doing nothing but

[22:42] you know taking people's money and not delivering anything and you're getting crucified for at

[22:46] least putting a game in people's homes so you know it's not easy it's not easy but it is easy it

[22:53] is very easy the easiest thing to do in the whole pinball hobby is just say I'm going to wait I'm

[23:02] not gonna rush to buy I'm gonna make sure I buy a game after I play it and I know I love it

[23:07] that's the easiest thing to do no one is holding a gun to your head to buy anything okay you know

[23:14] when I look at what else is going on in the hobby alien pimples are starting to ship and

[23:19] and you know those games seem to be having some issues and you know I after all this time after

[23:26] all this time people getting their alien machines want a game that's pretty bullet proof but I

[23:33] think it's going to be one of these games where you know what the quality is going to be like

[23:37] hit or miss because they probably didn't have the time or money to properly test these machines

[23:44] we all know Andrew is trying to rush the games out to avoid bankruptcy and these new owners are

[23:50] probably in the same boat they they are in a race against shipping product and refund request

[23:56] and there are still people today November 6th that have not received a refund on their game

[24:03] a well-known podcaster is the whole reason why that company went under or struggles right now

[24:09] uh...

[24:10] dutch pinball their update is that they are looking at a second a second build of the big labowski by their

[24:20] contract manufacturer and that should appear at the dutch pinball open that is coming out they say

[24:26] they're still working on code for the big labowski um... I don't know what to thank man I'll say this

[24:33] I'll say this I would love to own a big labowski pinball I would love to own one if there was

[24:39] absolutely no drama associate it with trying to get one it's just not fun it's none of the drama's

[24:46] fun none of the drama I'm here to tell you that the whole rare limited version of pinball or chasing

[24:53] after an expensive game that doesn't have any support it's not fun you know it's fun you know

[24:59] it's fun the most fun you can have in pinball is you own a game that's got a deep rule said it's got

[25:05] great art it's got great toys and if you have a problem and you pick up the phone stern pinball

[25:11] helps you out jersey jack pinball helps you out spooky helps you out you know those three to me

[25:17] those three to me right now are the only ones the only ones that I would actually consider

[25:23] buying right now simply because I know I'll be taking care of and I know there's going to be a

[25:28] person on the other end of the phone that will help me out if I treat that person with respect

[25:34] or I don't I don't even I don't even take into consideration the people who went nuts on pinside

[25:40] about ghost buster issues and then like nuke the company and then expect it to get help immediately

[25:45] you don't do that like I do believe there are still people waiting on ghost buster playfield which

[25:50] is insane anyway so just wait be patient I mean that is that is the key that is the key in this

[25:57] whole hobby is that our insanity led these companies to tailor the way they market it machines

[26:04] towards us and the end result is that the majority of people the majority of people who got too

[26:11] crazy and too obsessed with owning every new and box le those people have all woken up and now they

[26:18] realize what they should have done all along all along and just waited to buy the games that

[26:25] actually were great that they would keep the whole world of pinball collecting is shifting and

[26:31] the market is softening you can see it you're not going to be able to buy a game anymore play it

[26:37] for a year and sell it for just 500 bucks less you will probably lose a thousand to two thousand

[26:43] dollars on it depending on the model and the trim that you get it's just it's just the way it's

[26:49] going to be and that's a good thing because what that will do is that will keep people from rushing in

[26:56] it will make people buy games they really enjoy and don't want to flip this is it's so stupid to

[27:01] flip something so expensive like how many people go buy a five thousand dollar TV and then upgrade

[27:06] the next year for the for the newer version of that TV you just toys these unnecessary toys do you

[27:12] go buy a car drive it for like 12 months and then try and sell it for almost what you paid for it

[27:17] no the same is true of pinball the same will be true of pinball um you know we're at a period now

[27:23] it's November there's not a lot of news it's going to happen we're going to have to wait a couple

[27:28] weeks for people to play Guardians of the Galaxy I don't think there's any real news happening over

[27:33] a Dutch or highway pinball that's going to be that exciting American pinballs Houdini coming out

[27:40] will be exciting we we look forward to seeing that game ship and when you if you heard Josh and I

[27:45] talk about that machine you get a lot for your money in that machine you get a lot for your money

[27:51] and I think that's a title that if they can get production up and the quality is there

[27:57] I think there's going to be a lot of interested people who are going to be taking a look at that

[28:01] because again it's got though it's got a lot of wow going on under the play field um you know

[28:06] dialed in who in you know sales have probably softened up done dialed in I would imagine that

[28:12] the announcement of Pirate to the Caribbean's did nothing to make dialed in orders you know flood in

[28:19] Pirate to the Caribbean really exciting title will the hype will the excitement remain for that

[28:25] title and that theme a few months from now it's always challenging because Stern's not going to stop

[28:33] and from what I'm hearing it's always the hype machine you know they've got all these new games

[28:37] coming out this year and in 2018 that are going to blow us away um look I just wanted all to be fun

[28:44] I want to sometimes take a step back and look at the whole thing we complain about is pinball
