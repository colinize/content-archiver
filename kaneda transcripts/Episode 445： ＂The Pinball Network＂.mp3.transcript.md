[00:00] What do I have to do to get an invite ladies and gentlemen to the pinball network, so for

[00:19] those of you out there who are speculating that all of these podcast that were closing

[00:24] their shows were actually strategizing to join.

[00:29] a new conglomerate of pinball media.

[00:33] You were right.

[00:34] Today it was revealed that the pinball network

[00:37] is a real thing.

[00:38] It's led by Zach Mennie.

[00:40] It's got Ken Cromwell, Greg Bone, Jason Fowler.

[00:44] It's got Marty.

[00:46] It's got Jeff T. O'Lis.

[00:48] It's got Dennis Creasel.

[00:50] It's even got the damn guy from pinball supernova

[00:53] who flamed out and said he was done with this hobby

[00:56] for good a few days ago.

[00:58] And all of a sudden, he's back.

[01:01] And he's going to be joining the crew

[01:02] at the pinball network.

[01:04] And so look, this is not going to be a full episode

[01:06] of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[01:08] I don't do this pinball podcast to talk about

[01:11] other pinball podcasters.

[01:13] I don't do this pinball podcast

[01:16] to talk about the personalities making content.

[01:19] I do this because I love pinball.

[01:20] And I want to focus on talking about the pinball games,

[01:23] the companies, the rumors and all that stuff.

[01:26] But simply because my last podcast is now completely

[01:29] incorrect, I just wanted to do a quick show

[01:32] to share my quick thoughts on the pinball network.

[01:35] Well, first and foremost, I hope they create great content.

[01:39] It's that's what they're designed to do.

[01:41] Is they want to look at the pinball content in the world

[01:45] and they want to put their approach to it.

[01:47] So more power to them.

[01:49] We don't have any inclination into what it's going to be.

[01:52] If I were to guess, I think it's going to kind of be

[01:56] the kinds of content that these people have been doing before.

[02:01] And what I mean by that, I think, can and Jason

[02:05] are going to do like a stream that is going to be similar

[02:08] to the one the flipping out stream.

[02:10] Marty and Jeff Tealis, I know they're going to do a podcast

[02:14] that's not like head to head.

[02:16] They are going to do a podcast that is about tournament playing

[02:20] and tournament talk, which is good.

[02:22] Because then I don't have to add that to my list

[02:25] and my weekly rotation because I don't know about you,

[02:28] but I just can't do a podcast or listen to a podcast

[02:32] about tournament talk.

[02:34] It just it borrows me.

[02:35] But some people love it.

[02:36] Some people love it.

[02:37] OK, so my thing is this.

[02:40] This is all I want to say.

[02:42] I'm friends with a lot of these guys.

[02:44] I was talking a lot of these guys over the last couple weeks.

[02:47] And they knew they were doing this.

[02:49] But when I asked them what they were doing,

[02:50] I was just, you know, we're shutting the show down.

[02:53] And there wasn't any communication about this being

[02:56] the alternative or ulterior, sorry, motive for the show's closing.

[03:01] And do I think it was a little bit manipulative

[03:04] that they all shut down within one week?

[03:07] And they all had their various reasons

[03:09] why they were closing shop.

[03:11] Yeah, I just thought that was like thinking back on it now.

[03:14] It's just kind of lame that they weren't

[03:16] more transparent with their listeners about what they were doing.

[03:19] I mean, they easily could have said, we're closing the show

[03:22] and here's why and just say what it is.

[03:25] And just announce that's the case.

[03:27] The other part is because, you know,

[03:28] I'm friends with all these pinball content providers

[03:32] is when you do something like this,

[03:35] you naturally have people that are involved.

[03:37] And then you have people that are not involved.

[03:40] So you have some people feeling like they

[03:42] weren't invited to your party.

[03:44] And as much as their building this as being

[03:47] a collaborative effort to get the best pinball content out in the world,

[03:52] to have content that's non-competitive,

[03:54] I don't even know what that means.

[03:56] I just think it's a little like Lucy Goosey,

[04:00] how they're marketing this thing to the world.

[04:02] And I know it's more like, they should just be honest.

[04:07] We're doing pinball content the way we want to do.

[04:11] And we're all really good friends.

[04:13] And that's why these are the people on the roster.

[04:17] And if you're not really good friends with us,

[04:19] there's a really good chance we don't really want you to be part of this.

[04:22] That's cool.

[04:23] It's different strokes for different folks.

[04:25] I mean, look, you know me,

[04:26] I don't want to be invited to this thing

[04:28] because I wouldn't do this thing.

[04:30] I wouldn't join the pinball network.

[04:32] I mean, my show will always be Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[04:35] You're not going to hear an ad for a distributor in front of my show.

[04:39] You're not going to be fed things that I want you to buy from me.

[04:43] I'm just here to talk to you about pinball.

[04:45] And that's how I do my show.

[04:47] Now, other shows will be different.

[04:48] Other content providers will be different.

[04:49] People have sponsors.

[04:51] People will have to consider those sponsorships.

[04:54] When they talk about pinball, they will.

[04:57] You know, my new tagline, it's going to be this.

[04:59] Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[05:00] Thrills, not shills.

[05:03] Thrills, not shills.

[05:05] You're only going to get thrilling entertainment pinball content for me.

[05:09] Look, I just think it was like a little weird

[05:11] that they all canceled their shows.

[05:13] The weirdest one for me, though, was the Lea at Supernova.

[05:17] I mean, this guy like raged quits the hobby.

[05:20] Completely raged quits.

[05:21] Read the blog.

[05:23] I copied his blog because I think he's going to want it to lead it.

[05:25] He raged quits the hobby a few days ago.

[05:29] Now, I got to be honest.

[05:30] I never really heard of pinball Supernova before.

[05:33] He raged quits his site.

[05:36] It's just not a place I would go.

[05:37] And I've been in this hobby for five, six years.

[05:40] I go to pinside.

[05:41] I go sometimes to tilt forums.

[05:44] I go to Facebook.

[05:46] I just, I wasn't aware.

[05:48] Doesn't mean I don't think his site's good or bad.

[05:50] I just, I wasn't aware until he raged quit.

[05:52] But then all of a sudden, he's back within like 48 hours.

[05:56] He went from hating the hobby, wanting to sell all his games,

[06:00] talking smack about personalities like me on his outro blog.

[06:05] And then he's back and he's part of the network already.

[06:08] I mean, I would love to know what they sold them on that changed his mind so quickly.

[06:14] I mean, I wish they would sell that to me every time I feel like I'm burnt out and

[06:17] ready to go.

[06:19] So look, at the end of the day, all of this stuff is stupid.

[06:24] We all know it.

[06:25] It's dumb.

[06:26] We've already, we have so much pinball content.

[06:29] You're going to, you're going to listen to who you enjoy.

[06:32] You're going to listen to what entertains you.

[06:34] You're going to watch the streams that are good.

[06:36] You're going to watch the streams when you have time.

[06:39] I don't care about any of this crap anymore.

[06:42] I really don't.

[06:43] I really don't.

[06:44] I just want great pinball machines.

[06:46] What's the point of having all this pinball content if so many of the machines are mediocre?

[06:52] What's the point of streaming something when there's nothing really interesting to capture

[06:57] in the game?

[06:58] I think some of this stuff sometimes takes the focal point away from the products.

[07:04] I also think some of these manufacturers wanted that way.

[07:07] They don't want you to think too hard about the product or deconstruct it or have a guy

[07:12] like me tell you that that game and that great.

[07:15] Uh-oh.

[07:16] If Kaneda says that stranger things is mediocre, uh-oh.

[07:21] That's not good.

[07:22] We need to sell as many as we can because we paid for this license for five years.

[07:25] You know, stuff like that.

[07:26] I'm sure conversations like that happen behind closed doors.

[07:30] You know, it is what it is.

[07:31] And sometimes when stuff like this happens, it becomes a conversation in a vacuum amongst

[07:38] a lot of people that are making content.

[07:41] But you guys don't give a crap.

[07:43] You want to hear their news, the rumors, and the speculations and you want to get reviews

[07:47] on games and you want people to just give it to you straight.

[07:52] The only thing I wish for this all new pinball network is that when I hear stuff like we

[07:58] want to make content that's not competitive, we want everyone to get along and be collaborative.

[08:04] But for me, what makes content interesting is when you have differences of opinion.

[08:11] What makes content interesting is when you speak your mind and you're honest and you're

[08:16] transparent and you tell people how you really feel.

[08:20] And these guys are, you know, it's always hard.

[08:22] If you know Brian Eddie is coming on your show that night, are you really going to

[08:28] tell people on your podcast or on the next show that you really don't think the game

[08:34] is all that that you think it's kind of mediocre.

[08:37] And that's that's just it.

[08:40] All of us have that dilemma.

[08:43] How honest do I want to be or how, you know, even with ourselves and how much do I still

[08:49] want to be connected to the personalities that I want to talk to.

[08:54] Now I would love to have Zach many come on the show and talk about the pinball network.

[08:59] The invitation to have Zach on this show is always there.

[09:04] If he wants to launch this whole thing under the premise of being more collaborative, being

[09:12] more inclusive and being more positive in creating pinball content, then shouldn't he

[09:20] just come on the show and let's have a nice positive conversation about pinball.

[09:24] And what his intentions are with the pinball network.

[09:28] So let's see, Zach has failed to ever take me up on my offer.

[09:33] And it is a little strange considering this is the number one pinball podcast in the world.

[09:38] And if you want to be collaborative, you should also think about inviting the people who

[09:44] have some of the largest audiences in pinball.

[09:48] So that's it.

[09:49] I was wrong.

[09:50] I didn't think these guys, I actually took these guys more for their word.

[09:53] And I thought they were actually a little burnt out.

[09:56] I thought they had scheduling conflicts.

[09:59] I thought they were telling us more directly the reasons why they were quitting.

[10:04] But now we know the reason.

[10:06] I'm like, it's not how I would have done it, but it is the way they wanted to do it.

[10:11] And ultimately, I think we should just judge them on the quality of their content and

[10:16] not all this BS, you know, the market.

[10:19] It's like they're marketing the marketing.

[10:22] They're marketing content that's not even out there yet.

[10:25] And ultimately, the content itself will speak whether or not it was worth it to shut down

[10:33] all those shows with loyal followings to join this thing.

[10:37] I happily, I happily reside on the outside of the pinball network.

[10:44] This podcast can exist inside something like that.

[10:48] It just can't.

[10:50] There will be pressures to toe the line.

[10:54] There will be.

[10:55] You know, I used to write movie reviews once for a friend of mine.

[10:57] He got invited to all the junkets.

[11:00] And when I would give a bad movie review, he used to tell me like, dude, I just heard from

[11:04] Sony Pictures and they don't want to give me any more invites because of your review.

[11:09] But my reviews were awesome.

[11:11] And that's how I feel about pinball.

[11:12] I never want to have to like hold back because I got to be a little worried that we might

[11:17] upset the very people that are either sponsoring the show or have employees that we want to

[11:22] interview on the stream that we've already scheduled for next Monday night.

[11:26] You know, it's sort of like that.

[11:28] So like a lot of feathers have been ruffled by this behind the scenes.

[11:31] A lot of the Facebook conversations have been pretty heated and strident.

[11:37] Some people have been really burned by this news, though, too.

[11:39] And those stories will come out in the near future.

[11:42] But it's up to those people to tell those stories.

[11:45] I mean, I haven't been burned.

[11:47] I don't really care.

[11:48] I welcome all competition in pinball podcasting.

[11:53] I welcome all people that think they can create an entertaining pinball podcast for a duration

[11:58] of time.

[12:00] And it seems easy.

[12:02] It seems doable.

[12:04] It's very cheap to do a podcast.

[12:06] But I'll tell you this, when you are by yourself in a room with a microphone and you hit record

[12:14] and you're trying to create a show about pinball in which a few thousand people will listen

[12:19] and come back.

[12:21] It's not that easy.

[12:23] And ultimately, ultimately, every show comes down to the personalities behind them.

[12:30] But again, I just really want all of us to get the kinds of content that entertain, that

[12:36] inform, and that are honest and candid about how people really feel about these games.

[12:42] And I want to hear people's real excitement.

[12:45] I want to hear people's real disappointment.

[12:48] You need both.

[12:49] You need both.

[12:50] You just can't have real excitement all the time.

[12:54] There are crappy games, all right?

[12:56] Poonie factory.

[12:57] Is that how you...

[12:58] Poonie?

[12:59] Whatever.

[13:00] Celts.

[13:01] Oh man.

[13:02] Did I just say?

[13:03] Yeah.

[13:04] The Mafia.

[13:05] Team Poonball is the Mafia.

[13:06] Primus.

[13:07] Should just keep listening out like bad games.

[13:08] Anyway, everyone, I love you for listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[13:13] If you do me a favor, make sure you vote for Canada Pinball Podcasts in the Twippies.

[13:18] Some of this move had to be.

[13:19] Had to be.

[13:20] If we can collaborate, we can take down the guy that doesn't know what a fan layout is.

[13:24] How can he...

[13:26] I love it.

[13:27] He's a guy that doesn't even have a pinball machine in his apartment that didn't know what

[13:31] a fan layout is.

[13:32] How can he have the number one pinball podcast?

[13:34] Wait, he must be saying something they like.

[13:40] He never going to be a Canada.

[13:42] Never.

[13:43] It's never happening.

[13:44] It's never happening.

[13:45] The best they can do is get me to sign up.

[13:46] They can't afford me.

[13:47] They can't afford me.

[13:48] Anyway, everyone, have a great day.

[13:50] We'll talk to you soon.

[13:52] We're going to get back to the games, the rumors, the speculation, the news.

[13:55] Oh my God, Christopher Franci's, JAWS artwork.

[13:57] Let's talk about that.

[13:58] Nope, we're not end of show.

[13:59] Bye.
