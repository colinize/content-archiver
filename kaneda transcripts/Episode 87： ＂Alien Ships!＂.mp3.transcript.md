[00:00] I don't know what it was about Valentine's Day 2017, but so much pinball news is now colliding

[00:26] in this week.

[00:28] A week that we're supposed to be with our loved ones and talking to our significant others

[00:33] about anything other than pinball.

[00:37] And I had a laugh, I had a laugh because yesterday I'm getting all these text messages and

[00:41] emails from people wanting to talk about pinball.

[00:45] And I responded to a few people and just like, look, I'm going out with Brennan tonight

[00:49] and we're going to have a bunch of Manhattan's, some whiskey, a good dinner, listen to jazz

[00:54] music.

[00:55] I gave her tickets to the Red Hot Chili Peppers Saturday night.

[00:58] She loves them.

[00:59] I don't really love them, but it's going to be fun.

[01:02] And all this other stuff is happening.

[01:05] We're going to cover that and what's been going on over the last few days on Canadian

[01:08] pinball podcast right now.

[01:10] And there's a lot going on, right?

[01:12] Finally, alien pinball machine is put inside a box and in a truck.

[01:16] We're going to talk about that.

[01:18] I want to talk about Magic Girl.

[01:19] I got a lot of feedback from you guys.

[01:21] I've been reading the thread about what's going down there.

[01:24] I want to talk about Kevin Coolick and what's going on in that court case.

[01:28] And then just shoot the shit about some other pinball related stuff.

[01:31] But I don't know if you can tell by my energy levels have improved.

[01:34] I had a great night last night.

[01:36] I had a cup of coffee.

[01:37] I'm no longer as depressed and in that shell that I was a few months ago simply because

[01:44] I feel like we're closing in.

[01:46] I feel like we're closing in on some good endings to some terrible journeys for many people

[01:52] out there.

[01:53] And that's why it's a time to celebrate.

[01:56] And I know it's not a time to celebrate for everyone and we will talk about that.

[02:00] But first things first, I have to talk about alien pinball because I got so many messages

[02:05] from people basically saying, Canada, it's time for you to eat crow.

[02:10] Alien pinball machine is now shipping.

[02:13] And I'm like, what?

[02:14] Cool.

[02:15] I got the photos that you all saw and I couldn't help but start to laugh because I'm like,

[02:22] oh my god, yes, I am happy that alien pinball is now shipping, right?

[02:28] But what I saw the photos, I come on guys, is everyone like so gullible where they see

[02:34] one thing and everyone's already popping the champagne.

[02:38] Everyone's already saying, oh, things are amazing.

[02:40] Everything's great over at highway.

[02:42] They're shipping games.

[02:43] And me, maybe I'm just a cynic.

[02:45] Maybe I'm just the guy that always looks at stuff a little bit more with an intellectual,

[02:51] maybe cynical, maybe a little bit over scrutinizing mine.

[02:54] But I look at that and I'm like, wait a minute, why did you only build one?

[02:59] What?

[03:00] If the production line began and there was like 10, 11 games on the line, really only one

[03:05] game is done.

[03:07] That was my first reaction and my second reaction was, where the hell is that game going?

[03:12] I bet Andrew sent that game to himself.

[03:15] That's what I was telling people last night.

[03:16] They were laughing.

[03:17] But look, I'm happy that the game is done.

[03:20] I'll tell you why because I want to hear how the game is.

[03:23] I want you guys to get your games.

[03:25] I do want you guys to get your games.

[03:27] I think there is this feeling that Canada doesn't want highway to succeed and Canada doesn't

[03:31] it.

[03:32] Yep, whatever you guys think, I want you guys to get your games.

[03:36] Am I going to buy an alien?

[03:38] No.

[03:39] I think I've told you why I will never go in on an alien.

[03:42] Because I just don't like the package.

[03:44] I don't think it's like a great looking machine.

[03:47] But that's just my opinion.

[03:49] It doesn't mean it's your opinion.

[03:51] And I know people love this theme, so I'm happy you're about to get your machines.

[03:54] Now, where is alien number one going?

[03:57] Does anyone know?

[03:58] Is it going to coin taker?

[03:59] Is it headed overseas?

[04:01] Is it going to be on location soon?

[04:03] Andrew also said that more machines are going out this week.

[04:06] So that's a good sign.

[04:07] I still laugh.

[04:09] Every time I see the background images of his factory, I don't really see much going

[04:13] on.

[04:14] But I'll say this people.

[04:15] I'll say this.

[04:16] Don't be fooled by just photos.

[04:21] You guys have to understand something.

[04:22] I still think that highway pinball is in for a rocky ride.

[04:26] I do.

[04:27] I don't think financially they can be in a very good place.

[04:31] And I think they need money.

[04:32] And when I saw the photos of number one going out, I did laugh when I also saw on the

[04:38] same communication.

[04:40] He's always saying for those looking to buy one, here's how you can contact me.

[04:46] It's always a cash grab moment.

[04:49] Just ship them out.

[04:50] Ship them out.

[04:51] The real question I have is when are the LEDs going out?

[04:54] When is the LED our package going to be done?

[04:56] But look, look, I'm not going to be a Debbie Downer on this moment.

[05:00] This is a good moment.

[05:01] Now, I want to see more machines go out this week.

[05:03] And we'll see if highway can live up to what they have promised as a company that is

[05:10] going to mass produce alien pinball machines.

[05:13] One game slapped together put in a box does not make me think that they've succeeded in

[05:20] any way.

[05:21] But now what's great is that there is an alien out in the world.

[05:25] So I don't know where it is.

[05:26] I don't know what's going on.

[05:28] But I said, canada, you got to find out.

[05:30] You've got to track it down.

[05:32] So what I did.

[05:33] And guys, I know you want to like paypal me or Venmo me or give me money.

[05:38] You don't have to.

[05:39] I spent my own money and I flew out to the UK last night.

[05:44] I told Brenda you know what this date's over.

[05:46] I flew out there and I tracked down where the truck was going.

[05:50] I found it.

[05:51] I was like, here it is.

[05:53] I had a GPS on it.

[05:54] I've got a mole inside the highway factory.

[05:57] So I know where every alien goes.

[05:59] And I found where it landed.

[06:01] And I didn't just bust into the room.

[06:04] I put my ear to the door.

[06:07] And I really wanted to hear what the first owner's unboxing experience was going to be like.

[06:12] And here's what I heard.

[06:15] When I put my ear to the door and I listened to the first owners of alien pinball deciding

[06:21] how they were going to unbox it.

[06:23] David, please open it.

[06:27] I guess you nicely.

[06:30] Look if you're scared, I get it.

[06:33] It's okay.

[06:34] But I'm not.

[06:36] And I've come this far.

[06:39] So I'm going to ask you one more time.

[06:43] Please open it.

[06:46] I can't.

[06:50] Open it!

[06:52] Open it!

[06:53] Open it!

[06:54] Open it!

[06:55] Open it!

[06:56] Open it!

[06:57] Open it!

[06:58] Open it!

[06:59] Open it!

[07:00] Open it!

[07:01] Open it!

[07:02] Yeah, so we'll see.

[07:04] Yeah, I mean, there was quite a scuffle.

[07:08] Let's see what happens.

[07:09] I hope we see some unboxing and gameplay today or tomorrow or wherever it goes.

[07:15] And I hope more people get their alien pinball machine.

[07:17] So that's, you know, look, it's good news.

[07:20] It's good news.

[07:22] I think people waited a long time for this.

[07:25] And we'll see.

[07:26] I think it's going to be an interesting next few weeks for highway.

[07:29] I really do.

[07:31] Will they bring the Ellie to Texas Pinball Festival?

[07:34] What will people say of the game?

[07:36] That's what I'm curious about because the weight is one thing and then the actual game

[07:41] itself will it be worth the weight?

[07:43] So we're going to find that out real soon.

[07:45] All right.

[07:46] So, what else has been going on?

[07:48] So, magic girl.

[07:50] This is my last podcast sort of woke up a lot of people and got a lot of commentary.

[07:57] And I know that the thread has been blowing up all over the place.

[08:01] And I've said it.

[08:02] I've said it before.

[08:05] Magic girl will always be this like contentious conversation piece and there's no way around

[08:10] that.

[08:11] There's no way around what this pinball story has done to the hobby.

[08:15] You know, there's no way around the fact that it sucked the life out of the hobby for

[08:19] so many people.

[08:21] And I spoke to people yesterday and I want to clarify something because I was speaking

[08:25] to Zambiyeti and you know, and I want to apologize if this came across wrong in my last

[08:30] podcast.

[08:31] But I am not giving John Papadu credit for the artwork on magic girl.

[08:37] Everybody knows that Zambiyeti 100% created the artwork for magic girl, created the artwork

[08:44] for Raza, created the artwork we love for Alice in Wonderland and Ghostbusters artwork.

[08:49] What I did mean by my comments was I give John Papadu credit for bringing great artwork

[08:57] back to pinball, right?

[08:58] So I think John Papadu has the kind of mindset where he understands the value of great

[09:05] hand drawn art.

[09:06] That's what I was saying.

[09:07] And I don't think anyone would disagree with that.

[09:09] And nothing that I said was meant to discredit Zambiyeti.

[09:13] Now I want to sort of go down like what happened with magic girl the last like 48 hours again

[09:19] and what are some of the feedback I got from you guys I want to read out there and even

[09:23] want to talk about like again like why I went in on magic girl.

[09:27] But here's the thing here's the thing.

[09:29] The reality is this.

[09:31] The most of the conversation continues to be around like the game itself.

[09:35] Like should magic girl exist knowing that Raza and Alice in Wonderland people are still

[09:41] left out to dry.

[09:42] And I've said it before, do I think that John did this to buy time with what else is going

[09:48] on with lawsuits and that this and that right.

[09:51] And so yes, like I do think that magic girl the timing of it is very, you know, it's

[09:57] eerily close to the February 10th date right that was supposed to be when deposition were

[10:02] going to be heard.

[10:03] So I think that's why they announced that magic girl shipping.

[10:05] If you're a judge and you're hearing a case that this man has not made any pinball machines

[10:10] and this man has defrauded investors and this man is not living up to his promise.

[10:15] On the date you're hearing all this, they go out with a letter that says, hey, look,

[10:20] we know it's taken longer than usual magic girl is now ready.

[10:23] So and look, I also think it was curious why the letter from John was post marked February

[10:30] 6, which was before the court date.

[10:33] I think all that was strategic, but it is what it is.

[10:36] You know, you can either you can either just be angry that it exists.

[10:41] And I look, I think everyone's anger is valid.

[10:43] Like you should be angry if you gave John money and are not getting a game like that.

[10:50] I'm not here to tell you like you need to relax.

[10:53] That's the last thing you should hear.

[10:54] I'm not here to tell you you should stop your fight to get your money or your game.

[10:59] You should continue that fight.

[11:02] But I am here to say that this was step one.

[11:04] This was always going to be step one.

[11:07] There was never going to be a scenario where everyone was made whole at once.

[11:10] There just wasn't.

[11:13] I also want to tackle the other part of magic girl, which is everyone keeps saying that

[11:20] the vendors and everyone got screwed in this and that.

[11:23] And here's the thing.

[11:24] Everyone who worked on magic girl was an adult.

[11:27] Was a grown man, right?

[11:30] A grown individual who decided to work for John.

[11:34] And here's the thing.

[11:36] Yes, do I think John like told people false promises and defrauded them out of money?

[11:43] And out of machines?

[11:45] Absolutely.

[11:46] Absolutely, I think John Papaduke talked to people and made them promises and he didn't

[11:50] deliver on them.

[11:51] Now, but here's the thing.

[11:53] It takes two people to get screwed in any deal.

[11:57] And the people that did work for John for free, the people who gave John time, money and

[12:02] energy.

[12:03] Why did they do it?

[12:04] Why?

[12:05] Because they got stars in their eyes about Pimbal.

[12:09] And he was able to convince people to go the extra mile for him and on a handshake deal.

[12:17] On a handshake deal.

[12:18] For those people out there that say, I'm owed a machine.

[12:21] My simple question to those people is, do you have it in writing?

[12:24] Did you sign a contract that you should get a machine?

[12:28] Do you have anything that protects your time and your money and your investment in Zidware?

[12:34] Did you get any of that?

[12:35] And if you didn't, chances are you're probably going to get screwed.

[12:40] But that's a lesson that we all have learned the hard way from Zidware.

[12:44] I've heard people say this time and time again that you're not going to go in and give pre-order

[12:52] money anymore.

[12:54] People got burned and learned.

[12:56] You got to get burned to learn.

[12:58] And that's what happened with this whole thing.

[13:00] I listened to the coder of the machine saying, I'm owed $11,000 and a Magic Girl Pimbal

[13:06] machine.

[13:07] And so my response is like, well, why did you keep doing the work?

[13:11] Why did you even start the work before getting paid?

[13:14] And if you believe John's line of like, oh, I don't have money, money's going to come

[13:18] in, that's silly.

[13:20] It's silly that Orrick did all that work for Alien and just waiting for a machine.

[13:25] Get paid first.

[13:27] Get paid first for your work.

[13:28] And like, Zombie Eddie, do I think Zombie Eddie deserves a machine?

[13:32] How yes I do.

[13:33] How yes I do.

[13:34] But does he have in writing or does he have in any contractual form that deal?

[13:40] I don't know.

[13:42] I don't know.

[13:43] I hope he would.

[13:44] Bill Brandis is a businessman.

[13:48] Bill Brandis got in writing.

[13:52] He put in contractual legal binding form his deal with John.

[13:58] He wasn't an idiot.

[13:59] He sank his money into the project, but he took the IP.

[14:03] You see what Bill did?

[14:05] Whatever money Bill put in, I don't know how much it was.

[14:07] Whatever tens of thousands of dollars Bill put in, he then owned the IP to the games that

[14:13] John was making.

[14:14] So let's say John collected a million and a half dollars.

[14:18] I'm just hypothetically speaking, a million and a half dollars to make those three IPs.

[14:23] Bill now owns those IPs for whatever tens of thousands of dollars he put in because

[14:27] he did a smart move.

[14:29] He protected his money.

[14:31] Nobody else protected their time and their money with John.

[14:34] They just went in flippantly and expected to get a game.

[14:37] I did the same thing too when I started working for the guy and giving him all these marketing

[14:40] ideas.

[14:41] I didn't charge him.

[14:42] I spent hours working on materials for John and with hopes of getting a game and everyone

[14:48] had the same hopes.

[14:50] And at the end of the day, if you don't have it in writing, I don't know what to tell

[14:54] you.

[14:55] You're just going to hate John for the rest of your life and be bitter.

[14:57] But I'll say this for those individuals who feel they're owed a game.

[15:03] Go knock on the door of AP and Scott and John and say, where's my game?

[15:08] Have you done that?

[15:09] And here's the thing.

[15:10] And I know this for a fact.

[15:12] Most people aren't doing that.

[15:14] They're just complaining on Pinside.

[15:16] I'm going to tell you, Fralic is not going to get you a game.

[15:20] Why is Snow is not going to get you a game?

[15:22] The only one who's going to get you a game is John and Scott.

[15:29] And if you feel like you deserve one, go to them.

[15:33] Be a man and just yell at them that you deserve your game and show them proof that you deserve

[15:39] one.

[15:40] I tend to think that a lot of these people don't have anything to show.

[15:44] So they're just going to say, John told me so.

[15:46] And that's just probably not going to be good enough for AP to deliver on.

[15:52] But if there's anyone who deserves it, it definitely is.

[15:55] It definitely is zombie yeti.

[15:56] So I hope he gets it.

[15:57] I know he reached out to AP and I hope one of those extra games they made for accounting

[16:02] reasons.

[16:03] That's why there's extra games people for accounting reasons.

[16:06] That is what those games exist to do is make some people whole.

[16:10] So what else have I heard over and over and over about Magic Girl the last 48 hours?

[16:15] I've heard everything from your idiot from going in on it.

[16:19] The game's going to suck.

[16:20] It's going to be a box of lights.

[16:22] It's not going to be any good.

[16:23] It's not going to be worth anything.

[16:26] Let me read some.

[16:29] So I got an email from Joe Zankas saying, I really hate to be a Debbie Downer, but I think

[16:34] you made a big mistake even assuming it shoots okay.

[16:40] I think if the mex work, there will be ball stuck sections that get overlooked.

[16:44] There's still the coding.

[16:46] I'm sure every owner just paid one K.

[16:48] Okay.

[16:49] He goes on to say like, I don't think you made a good choice on this.

[16:53] A lot of other people have said that too.

[16:55] Other people are like, are you just going to flip it?

[16:57] Are you going to get rid of it?

[16:59] People are speculating how much I paid for it.

[17:02] And look, here's the deal.

[17:04] Here's the deal.

[17:05] I am not going to disclose how much I paid for Magic Girl.

[17:10] And I think what people don't understand is one simple thing.

[17:14] If you think Magic Girl won't be worth money, you're out of your mind.

[17:19] You're out of your freaking mind.

[17:21] This is a collector hobby.

[17:24] Collectors.

[17:25] In a world where people run and through $15,000 at Batman SLE with $Fidoller toys, with

[17:33] a re-skinned game, with not much innovation in it.

[17:37] And not even that rare because the actual game itself is going to be replicated thousands

[17:42] of times with the other Batman 66s that get made.

[17:45] Nothing in your super Ellie is super.

[17:48] It's going to be on everything else.

[17:50] The same game, the same experience.

[17:53] If you think that 25 Magic Girls out in the world amongst pinball collectors won't be

[17:58] sought after, I think you're crazy.

[18:01] That's my opinion.

[18:02] You could think I'm wrong.

[18:03] If you think that the code matters on the value of Magic Girl, I think you're nuts.

[18:08] It doesn't matter at all.

[18:10] At all.

[18:11] The game, you know, I look, Black Knight has been saying this and Fat Train has been

[18:15] saying this on, on Pinside.

[18:18] It's a fact that a lot of you guys don't want to accept that there are collectors out

[18:23] there that are not on Pinside.

[18:25] They want the rare items and yes, rare equals value.

[18:30] A great story to a rare item makes it even more valuable.

[18:35] There is no denying that the story behind Magic Girl is one of the most interesting, painful

[18:43] journeys or stories or narratives in the pinball world.

[18:50] You can't deny it.

[18:52] It is one of these just once in a lifetime ridiculous things that happen in a collector hobby.

[19:00] This doesn't happen very often.

[19:02] A project gets started.

[19:04] It doesn't get finished for years.

[19:06] People think there's no hope.

[19:10] People happen at the 11th hour.

[19:12] A company comes in for no reason whatsoever and decides to save the project.

[19:17] It's illogical.

[19:19] As Fralla keeps saying, none of this makes sense and then it does make sense.

[19:24] But the story might come to a good end in two weeks.

[19:27] We'll see.

[19:28] I'm still upset with American pinball because I'm upset that they came out with a letter

[19:34] that said Magic Girls are ready.

[19:36] They're ready.

[19:37] I know me and other owners out there are like, okay, we're ready to come get them.

[19:42] It's like, wait a minute.

[19:44] We don't have a schedule of when our games are actually available to pick up.

[19:48] We know it's going to be within two weeks.

[19:50] I've talked to Scott.

[19:51] I've talked to John.

[19:54] But when?

[19:55] That's the thing.

[19:56] When?

[19:57] I don't even know.

[19:59] Are they in boxes?

[20:00] Is John going to put them in boxes?

[20:01] Does he want people to pick them up?

[20:04] Are people, are they going to let shipping companies come by and take them?

[20:06] Is he going to allow that to happen?

[20:08] So I don't know when.

[20:09] But I'll say this.

[20:11] I've also been reading a lot when people say like the vendors were burned, the vendors were

[20:14] burned.

[20:15] You guys have no idea how much money American pinball put into this project over the last

[20:22] year.

[20:23] You have no idea.

[20:25] If you knew, you'd fall out of your chair.

[20:29] You'd think they're idiots.

[20:31] And I look, I think that's up for debate.

[20:33] Why they did it.

[20:34] People know that it was meant to invest in using John on other projects that might not

[20:39] happen.

[20:40] But at the end of the day, they did it.

[20:42] It was their money.

[20:43] They put it in.

[20:44] They got it to the finish line.

[20:46] And so you have to give them some credit here.

[20:50] This wasn't like they inherited a machine that was anywhere close to production, anywhere

[20:55] close to being finished.

[20:57] And they got it there.

[20:59] But we haven't seen anything.

[21:01] So we'll see.

[21:02] I mean, I know that a lot of you guys are super fucking pissed off.

[21:05] I get it.

[21:06] I get it.

[21:07] But if you think magic girls are going to go down in value, good luck.

[21:12] I don't think they are.

[21:14] That's my bet.

[21:15] I took a bet.

[21:16] I took a risk.

[21:17] I don't think they're going to go down in value.

[21:18] And here's the thing.

[21:19] A lot of guys keep coming to me and saying, you know, I hope it works out for you.

[21:22] Like, what does that mean?

[21:23] Like, I'm not going to get screened for cancer.

[21:25] I'm not going to, you know, in on a stock.

[21:29] I'm not going, I didn't go into this deal to flip it.

[21:33] I know Kineh has been flipping pinball machines and I will keep flipping pinball machines.

[21:37] I'm not going to flip magic girl.

[21:39] I think magic girl is a special piece of pinball history and I want to collect it.

[21:44] And as I was saying, there are a group of collectors out there that are, they go after the rare

[21:50] high-end items and they don't really talk a lot on pin side.

[21:55] They're not going to really show you what they have.

[21:58] And so to those collectors, that group of people, there only needs to be, let me repeat

[22:03] this.

[22:04] There only needs to be 27 high-end, wealthy pinball collectors out there that want magic

[22:11] girls to drive the value of one of them through the roof.

[22:16] Because all you need is two people who really want one and maybe only one machine is available.

[22:21] And as Black Knight was saying, here's the thing about value.

[22:25] It doesn't matter what wise snow thinks it's worth.

[22:28] It doesn't matter what all the people complaining about John think it's worth.

[22:32] It doesn't matter what all the people who say the code or the mechs or this or that.

[22:35] I've been talking to Crazy Levy.

[22:37] He's like, it's going to be a piece of shit.

[22:38] It doesn't matter what any of these people think.

[22:40] What matters is this.

[22:42] How much money is it going to cost to get one from an owner?

[22:47] That's the value of the game.

[22:50] That is the value of a magic girl.

[22:52] How much it takes to get one.

[22:53] Not what your personal opinions about the gameplay are.

[22:56] That doesn't mean shit in the value of a product.

[22:59] It doesn't mean anything.

[23:01] My Fixit Felix Jr. I'm looking at it right now.

[23:04] What do you think it's worth?

[23:06] When I was on Claw, everyone said it's worth nothing.

[23:09] It's a piece of shit.

[23:10] It's just a made up game.

[23:12] It's manufactured rarity, right?

[23:14] Disney only made about like 20 to 30 of them.

[23:17] Only like 12 of them are in private hands.

[23:19] Man you factured scarcity.

[23:21] Everyone tells me Fixit Felix is worth nothing.

[23:23] I heard it from all the Claw guys for years.

[23:27] I just got an offer on my eBay auction for Fixit Felix Jr. for $7,000.

[23:33] $7,000.

[23:35] That's more money than a major havoc.

[23:37] That's more money than some of the rarest arcade games of all time.

[23:40] It's almost the same price of like an environmental disc of tron

[23:44] for a manufactured scarcity game.

[23:47] You know, all those Claw guys can go eat a big fat DICK.

[23:52] Because that is the shit I hear on Pinside all the time.

[23:55] And I hear it from the price police there.

[23:56] I heard it from people at Claw.

[23:58] You guys don't get it.

[23:59] You don't get the way high-end collectibles work.

[24:03] If you want my magic girl, good luck.

[24:06] Do you know much money you would have to offer me to get it from me?

[24:10] It...

[24:11] I wouldn't sell to you for 30 grand.

[24:13] I wouldn't sell it to you for it.

[24:15] And I'll tell you why.

[24:16] Because to me, A, I don't need your 30 grand.

[24:19] I don't.

[24:20] I'm just fine financially.

[24:22] I've got no expenses in the world that I can't take care of.

[24:25] I've got plenty of money saved up.

[24:27] I don't need your 30 grand.

[24:29] And if I sold it to you for 30 grand and I had buyers remorse

[24:32] and I wanted to go get one back, how much do you think it would cost me to get it back?

[24:39] At least 30 grand, right?

[24:41] So then you start to ask yourself,

[24:43] shit, well maybe that's the reality of it.

[24:46] And I think that's what pisses people off.

[24:47] As you realize that, you know, as much as John like fucking brought everyone down this

[24:52] terrible journey, he's going to end up putting a product into the world that's going to be

[24:57] one of the most sought after invaluable Pimble machines of all time.

[25:00] And you think it's tainted and it doesn't deserve it.

[25:02] And I get it.

[25:03] All you guys are like, it doesn't...

[25:04] It's not worth shit to me.

[25:06] It's tainted to me.

[25:07] I wouldn't pay one dollar for it.

[25:09] That's cool.

[25:10] That's your prerogative.

[25:11] That's your prerogative.

[25:12] But do not for a moment think it's not going to be worth more than the $16,000.

[25:16] And I asked someone this question, how many Jetsons pinball machines is Magic Girl Worth?

[25:22] How many?

[25:23] $6,000 for Jetsons.

[25:25] Is Magic Girl worth $10,000 more than that?

[25:27] Is it worth $20,000 more?

[25:30] How many?

[25:31] Next to a Batman Super-Elly, how much is Magic Girl Worth?

[25:34] 80 Batman Super-Elly's 25 Magic Girls.

[25:39] 200 Big Bang bars out there, right?

[25:41] $192 I think is the final number.

[25:43] How much is 25?

[25:45] 25 Magic Girls made by one of the most celebrated pinball designers of all time.

[25:52] Am I making this stuff up?

[25:54] 25.

[25:55] The whole project was ridiculous.

[25:57] It never should have worked.

[25:58] It didn't work.

[26:00] I will never know why AP did what they did, but they did it.

[26:04] And now John is on to Raza.

[26:06] But here's the thing.

[26:07] Over the next two weeks, I can't wait to go to American pinball and pick up Magic Girl.

[26:15] Right.

[26:16] I know most of you are not excited for me.

[26:18] I know most of you are...

[26:20] It's a punch to the...

[26:22] Someone said it's a punch to the nuts that Canadian is going to get a Magic Girl and I'm

[26:25] not going to get my Raza.

[26:27] And if people think I did this to piss off pinside members, I didn't do it for that reason.

[26:32] I know it's going to piss some of you off.

[26:34] Some of you just can't stand me.

[26:36] You can't stand me.

[26:37] You can't stand the fact that like...

[26:40] I'm in this hobby.

[26:41] I love pinball.

[26:43] Maybe some people just want to hate on me for some reason.

[26:46] You hate the fact that I have a hellcat.

[26:47] Well, demons coming guys.

[26:49] I'm going to drive over to Wysnow's house and the demon and just do a donut in his front

[26:53] yard when I get the demon.

[26:56] But look, I'm going to go over there in two weeks.

[26:58] And here's what it's going to sound like when I walk through the doors of AP.

[27:03] This is how Canadian is going to make his entrance into American pinball.

[27:06] It's going to sound something like this.

[27:08] I'm here.

[27:09] I'm here.

[27:10] I'm here.

[27:11] The million dollar man is here.

[27:15] I want to see it now.

[27:19] I want to see it now.

[27:21] Then you know I'm going to pack it up.

[27:23] I'm going to put it in the car.

[27:26] And as I'm sort of like driving away, this is what I'm going to say out loud.

[27:33] It's mine.

[27:34] It's mine.

[27:36] Finally.

[27:37] Finally, a possession worthy of a million dollar man.

[27:40] And finally, something that will show the entire pin sight.

[27:45] Just how truly great I really am.

[27:50] And then I'm going to sort of off the road crash and magic girl number 14 will be lost

[28:01] forever.

[28:02] So we'll see.

[28:03] We'll see what happens.

[28:04] I'm excited to go get it.

[28:06] I know that a lot of you guys out there are curious to see what it looks like, what

[28:10] it plays like.

[28:11] And I'm in the same boat.

[28:12] I'm in the same boat.

[28:15] But I just want to tell people that I don't think magic girl shipping absolves John of

[28:22] his other responsibilities and his other obligations to make the other two games.

[28:27] So this is step one though.

[28:29] Let's see what happens the next couple of weeks.

[28:31] I keep the part of me is just like, man, we still haven't seen anything.

[28:36] We're all congratulating ourselves on an email.

[28:40] And it's not real until the games go out.

[28:42] So I know this is a premature celebration on magical for sure.

[28:46] But I just want to tell you guys, look, look, I think it's going to happen.

[28:51] I think it's going to happen.

[28:52] All right.

[28:53] So let's switch gears.

[28:54] Let's get off a magic girl for a little bit.

[28:56] And let's talk about Kevin Kool-Aid.

[28:58] Because this was probably the greatest Valentine's Day gift of all time.

[29:04] Kevin is in deep shit right now.

[29:07] And that is where everybody wants to see this guy.

[29:10] It is coming to an end.

[29:14] He is from what I can take is this.

[29:17] I saw court papers that basically said Kevin has until Friday this week to either turn

[29:26] over $50,000 or lose possession of the RV that will be auctioned off.

[29:32] I think they're valuing it as a $25,000 item.

[29:37] And then there's another $25,000 he owes as well.

[29:40] So what I can take from, you know, I'm not a lawyer, but what I've read is that Kevin basically

[29:46] gave money to his co-workers at Skip B and to his family and bought items.

[29:52] And the guy's an idiot.

[29:53] Like he just thought he could get away with this.

[29:55] So I have a feeling come Friday or when this thing finally has the ultimate conclusion,

[30:02] this is what the jury and the judge is going to sound like when they read the final verdict

[30:08] on Kevin Koolik.

[30:32] Someone said it and it's true.

[30:44] We have to put Keith in the pinball hall of fame for what he's done.

[30:47] Keith is the lawyer who has continued to pursue this case and it is unbelievable that

[30:53] job he has done getting the evidence, getting everything together.

[30:58] I think everyone who's been involved in helping Keith out should pat themselves on the

[31:02] back.

[31:03] It's a great example of the pinside community coming together to provide Keith with a lot

[31:07] of that evidence.

[31:08] Again, I think there's no greater moment that when the community works together to bring

[31:15] down someone like Kevin Koolik and it's about time.

[31:19] This guy really thought he was going to get away with it.

[31:21] I mean, it is incredible.

[31:23] It is incredible.

[31:24] I don't think Kevin and J-pop are the exact same, not at all.

[31:29] They're very similar though, right?

[31:32] They both asked for money when they knew stuff was not going to work out and they both

[31:38] deserve to have the same fate if they don't deliver the products.

[31:41] The only difference is that Kevin could never deliver predators.

[31:45] He was never going to get the license to do it.

[31:48] John could possibly get out of his situation and make the Raza's one day.

[31:53] I still think to this day, J-pop having two titles on the shelf, Raza and Alice Wonderland

[32:00] and he's got them designed and he's got the artwork done and he's got all the stuff

[32:03] ready to go.

[32:04] It's like Quentin Tarantino having two scripts ready to go, ready to be made.

[32:09] I still think it's for those pinball companies out there who want to sell product, make

[32:16] a bunch of J-pop's games and you'll sell them.

[32:18] I mean, you will.

[32:19] There's no way around that.

[32:20] They will sell.

[32:22] But he doesn't know how to make them.

[32:23] That's the problem.

[32:24] I don't think he's going to get support after Magic Girl from AP.

[32:27] So we'll see what happens.

[32:28] But Kevin, you're done, man.

[32:30] They're going to take that RV.

[32:32] I, Canada should buy the RV, right?

[32:33] That would be the ultimate F you to Y Snow.

[32:36] I should buy the Kevin Coolix mom's RV for 25 grand and I should park it out front of

[32:41] Y Snow's house and that should be like my vacation spot.

[32:45] I should set up the Magic Girl on the roof of it and have Y Snow run outside and be like

[32:51] you're going to get, you're going to get sun fate on the cabinet, Canada.

[32:55] What are you doing?

[32:57] You don't even, and, and, and, and, Canada, there's no dollar bill, except on Magic Girl.

[33:02] That means it's worth nothing.

[33:04] Oh, God.

[33:06] The world needs dollar bill, excepters or Y Snow's going to go crazy.

[33:11] Anyway.

[33:12] Oh, Hilton, you know, you, you make it interesting on Pinside.

[33:16] You really do.

[33:17] I have to say, I love reading every idiotic thing you write.

[33:20] Oh, what else is going on?

[33:22] So okay, did you see this story?

[33:24] This one is just idiotic.

[33:27] This guy on Pinside is redoing his Ghostbusters Ellie play field.

[33:32] He gets a Ghostbusters Ellie.

[33:34] He spends $8,000 on it and it starts chipping after like 20 plays.

[33:40] The clear coat starts chipping in the shooter lane.

[33:43] And what does Stern do?

[33:45] They, they, they were going to send him sandpaper and clear to cover it up.

[33:50] I did total F you to this buyer.

[33:55] And he's like, you know what, I'm going to make lemonade at a lemon and life deals you

[34:01] injustices.

[34:02] And so I'm going to, he's basically like redoing his play field.

[34:06] He's taking everything off.

[34:08] And you know, I am so tired of hearing stories like these and Stern not standing behind

[34:14] their products.

[34:16] I'm almost as equally tired of hearing KPG on his endless crusade to remind people in

[34:21] every single thread.

[34:22] You could have any thread on Pinside.

[34:23] You could have a thread about like, hey guys, what did you think of the Super Bowl?

[34:27] And KPG will be in that thread being like, the Patriots won, but you know who lost Ghostbusters

[34:32] Ellie owners, man, those guys fucking lost.

[34:35] You know, it's like he, there's no thread that is safe from KPG's rants about Stern

[34:40] quality.

[34:42] But here's the thing, he's freaking right.

[34:46] If Stern would have just taken care of him, he wouldn't be on this crusade and they have

[34:50] him.

[34:51] They still haven't bought back his pinball machine.

[34:53] They're singling him out.

[34:55] They're making an example of him.

[34:57] But in the wrong way, like how stupid is that?

[34:59] Like a company shouldn't make an example of someone who's upset when he got a defective

[35:04] product from them.

[35:06] I sort of, you know, I don't know like if me harping on this is the reason why no one

[35:10] else from Stern will come on my podcast.

[35:13] George Gomez is supposed to come on.

[35:15] Keith L. Wednesday come on and Keith just disappeared.

[35:17] I mean sending him notes.

[35:18] Hey man, like would love you to come on and give your perspective and point of view on

[35:23] creating a world on your glass.

[35:25] I want to talk to these guys.

[35:27] But you know, I don't know.

[35:29] I won't not say bad things about companies when they do bad things, you know.

[35:35] So it's silly.

[35:38] When I see stuff like that, I'm absolutely flabbergasted that people have to like rip apart

[35:43] in $8,000 toy.

[35:46] Before they feel happy or satisfied, you should not have to do the warranty work.

[35:49] If my Dodge Hellcat, if this, if something happened to it, I wouldn't be taking a wrench

[35:54] to it.

[35:55] I wouldn't be saying, oh, I have to fix the supercharger now because the supercharger is

[35:58] not working sucks.

[36:00] But you know what?

[36:01] Some things in life do suck.

[36:02] So I'm just going to do the work myself.

[36:03] Bullshit.

[36:05] You just spent eight grand on ghost busters.

[36:07] It should work.

[36:08] It shouldn't be defective.

[36:10] And I love how Stern has in their warranty.

[36:12] Like that stuff like this isn't covered.

[36:14] Like that's bullshit too.

[36:16] Nobody should be buying these machines until these issues are figured out.

[36:20] And there is definitely a play field quality issue.

[36:24] I'm surprised that it hasn't happened on Batman.

[36:27] So hopefully it's fixed.

[36:29] But the communication, nobody knows.

[36:31] It really is.

[36:32] You're playing like Russian roulette with your money.

[36:35] So you know, I've been hearing a lot too about magic girl, quality of people.

[36:39] I know I got off magic girl now.

[36:40] I'm back on magic girl.

[36:42] Magic girl is, I don't know.

[36:44] Do you believe that John is going to hand this hand built machine is going to have the best

[36:47] parts possible and the quality is going to be great?

[36:49] Or do you think when you start flipping it, things are going to be flying off the thing?

[36:53] I don't know.

[36:54] Who knows?

[36:55] Who knows?

[36:56] We'll find out soon enough.

[36:57] What else is going on?

[36:59] Anything in the pinball world.

[37:00] I want to sort of read some, let me see if I have some feedback from you guys that is

[37:03] interesting to read.

[37:04] I got an email from Joe Perino.

[37:08] I hope I pronounced that right.

[37:10] Joe said, love the last episode.

[37:13] You are a man that brings passion to the hobby.

[37:16] Crazy balls you got going in on magic girl.

[37:19] Glad to hear the risks is going to pay off.

[37:22] Question I'm going to be buying my first pinball machine in April.

[37:26] I have two games I'm looking at, Wizard of Oz or Spider-Man Vault Edition.

[37:31] Which ones you believe will be worth more five years down the line?

[37:35] Okay.

[37:36] Well Joe, I think Apple stock will be worth more five years down the line versus these two

[37:42] pinball machines.

[37:43] If I had a guess, Wizard of Oz or Spider-Man Vault, I think down the line, my money will

[37:51] always be on Wizard of Oz.

[37:53] I think Jersey Jack created a game that was severely under price.

[37:59] When it first came out, Wizard of Oz was $6,500.

[38:03] Think about that for a minute.

[38:04] Wizard of Oz was only $500 more than the Jetsons and look at the two machines next to

[38:10] each other.

[38:12] Jack priced Wizard of Oz to go bankrupt.

[38:14] Jack went bankrupt with the pricing of Wizard of Oz.

[38:18] Jack got bailed out.

[38:19] Jack has realized that to actually make a company succeed, pinball machines that are intricate,

[38:25] complex and have a lot of bells and whistles need to be priced at least at least at $8,000

[38:32] or above.

[38:33] It's just that that's the reality of the marketplace and how expensive it is to make pinball

[38:36] machines.

[38:37] Because you have to also stay in business, right?

[38:40] These aren't home brew machines.

[38:42] These are companies.

[38:43] So I think Wizard of Oz will definitely be worth more than the Vault Edition Spider-Man.

[38:47] I also think Spider-Man, the Vault Edition is nicer than the original.

[38:52] I know it is plagued by a lot of ghosting issues and play field concerns and they're

[38:57] making a lot of them.

[38:59] How long will Stern continue to make them?

[39:01] Who knows.

[39:02] But I do think that the quality of Jersey Jack machines in the long run will be more sought

[39:09] after than Stern error machines like Spider-Man Vault Edition.

[39:13] Now would I pick one of those two games?

[39:16] So I'm not sure if you've had time on Vault, but I really think you should look at, maybe

[39:21] you're going on theme, but I really do think that dialed in shoots way better than Wizard

[39:25] of Oz.

[39:26] And you may want to think about Houdini.

[39:28] Again, Balser made Wizard of Oz.

[39:31] Balser is doing Houdini.

[39:32] You may want to consider that as well for something.

[39:36] But if your whole reason, Joe, for getting a machine is what it will be worth five years

[39:41] from now, I got to be honest.

[39:43] The game I would buy and keep it in box, or even if you play it and hold on to it for

[39:47] five years, I think the big Lebowski is going to be the one that is worth a ton in five

[39:52] years.

[39:53] Simply because I don't think Dutch is going to make it.

[39:56] I don't think they're going to make many big Lebowski's at the end of the day.

[39:59] They've made thousands of Wizard of Oz's and Stern has probably made thousands of Spider-Man

[40:04] and in its totality.

[40:06] So big Lebowski is where I would sink my money.

[40:08] All right.

[40:09] Let's see some other emails that I've gotten.

[40:12] I got an email back from Louis.

[40:15] My friend over there, he said, I smiled at my name.

[40:18] The Louis part is perfect.

[40:20] Francois sounds like France plus Wau.

[40:23] France Wau.

[40:24] Louis France Wau.

[40:26] Last name Roy sounds like Rua.

[40:30] So France, Louis France Wau Rua.

[40:34] I hope I said that right.

[40:36] Louis, thank you for listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[40:39] The author said, there's a new show on YouTube by Pinsiders.

[40:43] Looks okay.

[40:44] You should watch Zero Presence or Appeal.

[40:48] That's your thing.

[40:49] Start thinking about Canada 3.0 in video.

[40:51] So I have been considering doing a video podcast of this show.

[40:57] So you guys can see me in my pajamas wearing uggs, recording my podcast.

[41:05] It's going to be epic.

[41:07] Now if I got Brenda in a nice tight dress, leaning over, playing toad in, I'm sure I

[41:13] could get like a million views.

[41:15] I'm sure she'd freaking slap me in the face if she heard me say that.

[41:19] But maybe it'd be great to put Bubba on the air too for you guys to see.

[41:23] Let's see.

[41:24] I got an email from Thomas O'Connell.

[41:27] Thomas, thank you for listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[41:29] Thomas wrote, you seem to like the thrill of the chase as much as making a few bucks.

[41:34] I can only guess what kind of discount you got on the Magic Girl spot.

[41:38] So can't imagine you're not going to sell it.

[41:42] And I wrote back to Thomas.

[41:43] I was like, Discount.

[41:45] You're out of your mind, Thomas.

[41:47] And I think these are going to sell for North of 16K.

[41:51] So he basically said, hopefully it'll pay off.

[41:55] And as I said before, Thomas, it'll pay off for me if I actually get a machine.

[42:00] If American Pinball holds up, they're under the bargain.

[42:03] And I have a Magic Girl by the end of February.

[42:06] I love Zombies at his artwork.

[42:09] I love John Papadouk's crazy antics with Pinball machines.

[42:13] I love the kinds of mechs he dreams up.

[42:16] And I hope it lives up to my expectations.

[42:18] If it doesn't, I still will enjoy it as a work of art.

[42:22] I consider Pinball machines to be the ultimate works of art.

[42:25] And I consider Magic Girl to me the most visually stunning game of all time.

[42:29] That is how I feel.

[42:30] So if I have it, it will be worth it.

[42:31] I am not flipping this game as I said.

[42:33] I'm not in this one for the money.

[42:36] Let's see.

[42:37] Joe Zankas, I want to go back to him because he went down a list of why.

[42:40] I said, when I said, if a thousand people, or sorry, 25 people gave a thousand dollars,

[42:45] we could recode Magic Girl.

[42:47] It's not that simple.

[42:48] It won't work like that.

[42:49] You need more than that.

[42:51] And maybe he's right.

[42:52] But as Ben Heck also said, people will get together and code this machine.

[42:58] And Joe went on to say, because we were talking about rarity.

[43:00] And I was like, look, I expect your opinion.

[43:02] But I think it's going to be a great game and be rare.

[43:04] He wrote, something has to be more than rare to be valuable.

[43:07] Magic Girl is just going to be an unfinished pinball.

[43:10] The only thing that makes it valuable is its story.

[43:13] And Joe, I agree with you on that point.

[43:15] Joe went on to say, Rob Zombie was speculated to be valuable at 300.

[43:20] Then people started selling them left and right some of a hard time.

[43:25] Marley's last podcast, he even admits that there are still some spots left.

[43:29] I.E. he didn't sell out.

[43:32] America's most haunted is still somewhat sought after.

[43:35] Half as many, spooky's first game.

[43:37] But even that title can be hard to move you's at 6500.

[43:40] I can't believe people are paying 6K for a play field and translate.

[43:45] Then again, when Zombie Yeti was selling those Alice in Wonderland prints, they sold out

[43:49] in like 20 minutes.

[43:51] Glad I got mine.

[43:52] You'll be glad you kept toad in.

[43:55] Magic Girl is going to look pretty and that's about it.

[43:58] Well, Joe, look, I agree with a lot of what you said.

[44:02] Look, I think it's going to be more than just a pretty box of lights.

[44:06] It may be that, but I'd look, I think it's going to have something that works.

[44:10] I really do.

[44:12] I don't think you can compare the Magic Girl game to anything spooky makes.

[44:17] I think Spooky's value and I think the game's, the hype around spooky die down because

[44:24] I think people finally started to, they judge the spooky games by the merits and the fact

[44:29] that the games did feel and still do feel a little home brew for people.

[44:35] There's just this sense when you're in front of a spooky machine that, you know, it's

[44:40] a little bit cheaper.

[44:42] It's a little bit, I don't want to say cheaper.

[44:44] It's not the right word.

[44:45] It just doesn't have as much going on as other pinball machines.

[44:50] They're a brand new company they're working on it.

[44:51] I love these guys.

[44:52] I always say I love spooky, but I think what happened with spooky games is the hype and

[44:58] the drive to own one and the rarity is what people were chasing after.

[45:02] There's only 150 America's most honnets and so people were driving the prices up.

[45:08] Remember when that game was selling for $8,000 new in box, $9,000 new in box and then

[45:13] everyone ran to rob zombies because they were like, well, this theme is better.

[45:17] The art's better.

[45:19] How could this not go up in value?

[45:20] That's what drove me.

[45:21] I followed the cattle.

[45:22] I followed the cattle right to Charlie's door and said, here's a $1,000 deposit and I'm

[45:26] going to flip this for $8,000, $9,000 and I'm going to make a cool $2,000, $3,000 without

[45:30] doing a thing.

[45:31] Then what happened?

[45:32] Nobody was able to get more than what they spent MSRP on rob zombies, right?

[45:37] Because here's ultimately what happened.

[45:39] It doesn't have the story.

[45:41] It doesn't have the story.

[45:42] It doesn't have anything interesting behind it that makes it valuable.

[45:48] There's nothing that happens in those games that makes you need to have to play it.

[45:53] That's what it comes down to.

[45:56] You have to be in front of a toad and to see the shooting star, the disappearing magna.

[46:01] There's really cool shit in the game.

[46:03] There's really amazing artwork.

[46:05] What makes games valuable that are rare is the story.

[46:08] The story behind Big Bang Bar, the story behind Kingpin, the story behind King Kong.

[46:12] The story behind Magic Girl.

[46:15] There's nothing like that to go with your purchase of Rob Zombie other than the story of Spooky

[46:20] Pimball, which is cool, which is cool, but not going to drive the games up in value.

[46:27] I think it's safe to say that Magic Girl has the story.

[46:32] It has the rarity.

[46:33] It has the artwork.

[46:35] Everything else has a question mark around it.

[46:37] I don't think it's going to lose value.

[46:44] I got an email from Greg here.

[46:48] Greg and I are like buddies.

[46:49] We're buddies.

[46:50] We Gmail each other all the time.

[46:52] I know he listens to the show.

[46:53] Greg, I really appreciate you listening.

[46:56] I know we've had our dramatic back and forth, but at the end of the day, Greg is a cool

[47:01] dude.

[47:03] He writes, Magic Girl.

[47:05] Oh you.

[47:07] I'm telling you, the hobby was way more fun when it was non-stop cheap games that you

[47:11] could repair yourself and build a great collection.

[47:15] Data, ESAG, games were always under 1K.

[47:17] My first game was back to the future for 300 bucks.

[47:20] I picked up Golden Eye for 650 bucks.

[47:25] Let's see.

[47:26] What else?

[47:27] A13 for 800.

[47:28] With Shaker, Jurassic Park for 700, Guns and Roses 1900.

[47:32] And if you did get new in box, the prices were right and the code was solid.

[47:36] As far as investment goes, if I do purge my collection, it's mostly where two to three

[47:40] times what I have, Induate, Nintendo Switch and two weeks.

[47:43] Woo.

[47:44] Well Greg, yeah, I agree.

[47:46] This hobby, man, it hasn't been fun.

[47:49] It hasn't been fun for me.

[47:51] It hasn't been that much fun for a lot of people waiting for Alien.

[47:54] It hasn't been fun for Zedware customers.

[47:57] It hasn't been fun for Stern customers with defective products.

[48:01] It hasn't been that much fun.

[48:03] What is fun is what Greg is talking about when you pick up games that are done.

[48:07] When you pick up games that aren't that expensive.

[48:09] When you just play pinball, playing pinball is really fun.

[48:13] The hunt, the chase, it might be thrilling, but it's not fun.

[48:17] And Greg's final point, Nintendo Switch and two weeks, how freaking yeah.

[48:22] You know what I do most nights?

[48:23] I play Xbox.

[48:24] I play UFC.

[48:25] I love it.

[48:26] You can be like Mike Tyson and Bruce Lee and it's so much fun.

[48:29] And it hours in enjoyment for like 50 bucks.

[48:32] I've said this pinball is great.

[48:34] Pinball is great, but $8,000 a pop per game, $10,000, $16,000, $15,000.

[48:41] So fucking stupid.

[48:42] When you step back and think about it, it's so stupid.

[48:46] It's so stupid.

[48:49] And yet, and yet, here we are, like involved in it every week, every day, thinking about

[48:56] it.

[48:57] And it's like such a stupid toy.

[48:58] It really is.

[49:00] At $1,000, $2,000, amazing, right?

[49:03] But for the price where these things are going, I'd rather have a hellcat and no pinball

[49:09] machines than $6,000, $10,000 pinball machines.

[49:14] For those of you who have never been in a hellcat, let me tell you, I will give you a ride.

[49:17] If you're ever in New York City, come for a ride with me in a hellcat and let's put

[49:22] Rob Zombie music on.

[49:24] Coming down the highway, playing demon speeding in a hellcat with the mid muffler deleted,

[49:30] sounding like a fucking bad at a hell going down the highway, I can reach 130 and third gear.

[49:39] Tell me that that experience is not more immersive and amazing and get your blood boiling

[49:45] more than playing Rob Zombie pinball.

[49:47] You guys don't get it.

[49:48] Those of you who know cars, you get it.

[49:50] You understand that the pinball thrill is very, very miniscule next to other thrills.

[49:56] And look, video games provide the thrill for many people for like 50 bucks.

[50:02] Are you who else hit me up?

[50:03] Let's see.

[50:05] Frazier Whirly, he said, Frazier, thank you for listening to Canada's pinball podcast.

[50:09] I appreciate it.

[50:10] I love all my listeners.

[50:11] He said, I should have known you'd get in on Magic Girl given how much you revered

[50:15] J-Pop's machines.

[50:17] The toys and the artwork and all.

[50:20] And I'm with you on that front.

[50:22] Tode in, CV, theater of magic, all fun machines and beautiful to look at.

[50:26] I don't know if we can expect it to live up to half the hype, but I hope it arrives

[50:31] that it shoots well enough and the build quality lives up to the promises.

[50:36] It's a bold brave move of yours, but it'll make some interesting podcast for sure and

[50:42] all your listeners should be grateful for those cheers, Frazier.

[50:46] Thank you Frazier.

[50:47] I appreciate the note.

[50:49] I do hope it lives up to some of my expectations.

[50:52] I do think it will make for interesting podcast material.

[50:56] I hope to get John on, Scott on.

[50:58] I also want to get the artist to do the cabinets for Magic Girl on.

[51:01] I know who he is.

[51:02] I've been talking to him.

[51:03] He's a great guy.

[51:05] Very much in the shadows.

[51:07] Nobody really knows who he is.

[51:08] So I can't wait to sort of introduce him to more of you pretty soon.

[51:12] Pete, I know you're listening.

[51:13] I know you're out there.

[51:14] I owe you a chance to come on the show and many more chances.

[51:18] And Pete, I am sorry.

[51:20] There's just all this news has been breaking, but I'm going to get you on next week for

[51:24] sure.

[51:25] So, what else did I see?

[51:27] I saw that someone listed their alien Ellie for sale and said it would ship in two weeks.

[51:32] I love that the meme that we created around two weeks has paid off.

[51:36] So that's it for episode 87 of Canatus Pimbal Podcast.

[51:41] I think there's a lot going on in the hobby right now.

[51:44] I think it's a time to celebrate.

[51:47] It's also a time to keep fighting.

[51:49] If you are still waiting for your game and you have not gotten it on any level from any

[51:54] of these manufacturers, whether it's Lebowski, whether it's Razza, whether it's alien, keep

[52:00] fighting.

[52:01] Don't give up.

[52:03] Don't sit back and be gullible and fooled by emails, by a photo of one game going out.

[52:11] Don't be that gullible.

[52:13] You have to demand you get your game by a certain time frame.

[52:18] And don't for the love of God.

[52:21] Don't pay for something before you see it.

[52:26] Don't do it.

[52:27] I did it and it sucks.

[52:28] Don't do work for anybody in anything at any time for free.

[52:35] Unless it's someone you love, a family member and they deserve it.

[52:39] Do not give up yourself onto someone with a handshake deal.

[52:44] You're going to get burned and ultimately we're all adults.

[52:49] We really have known a blame but ourselves if we let someone take advantage like that.

[52:53] I don't trust anybody and I'll end on this point.

[52:57] I don't trust many people in this hobby.

[53:00] I have to say this.

[53:02] Pimbal manufacturers are sharks, they're salesmen and they're liars.

[53:07] They're liars.

[53:08] There's more lying going on in this hobby than any other hobby I've ever seen.

[53:13] It's absolutely disgusting.

[53:16] There's also sharks, liars and psychofence and untrustworthy people on the consumer level,

[53:24] on the collector level.

[53:25] Don't be fooled for a second.

[53:27] Pimbal collectors are the biggest sharks and liars.

[53:31] They will stab you in the back to get to a game before you get to one.

[53:36] When a deal is out there, it's like blood in the water.

[53:38] They'll do everything they can to get it for themselves.

[53:42] Look, I think there's chum happening over there in Illinois, over the American Pimball Factory.

[53:47] All magic girl owners are circling around like sharks waiting to swoop in and get their game.

[53:52] As much as every owner is like, oh, we're going to help each other out.

[53:55] Everybody just wants their own epin game.

[53:57] It's like every man for himself.

[54:00] I tend to not have that approach.

[54:03] I'm working with Chris and Bill and I'm happy to figure out how to pick up these games

[54:08] and work it out together.

[54:10] But you never know who to trust.

[54:12] It's hard to know.

[54:14] It's a weird hobby like that.

[54:16] But all collector hobbies are like that.

[54:18] People will stab you in the back to get the good deal.

[54:21] You just have to be careful.

[54:22] You just have to be grown adults and act with your own best interest in mind.

[54:28] Is it in your own best interest in mind to pay in full for alien two years ago?

[54:33] To pay in full for dialed in collector's edition?

[54:36] To pay in full for the big Lebowski two years ago?

[54:42] No, protect your best interest.

[54:44] Don't worry about not being able to get a machine down the road.

[54:49] Every machine, every machine, whether it's magic girl, big bang bar, Lebowski, every

[54:55] machine you can eventually get.

[54:58] If you put your money in the stock market over the last five years instead of chasing

[55:03] after every new pinball machine, you would have like doubled or tripled your money.

[55:08] And then you could have gone and got a hellcat and a wizard of Oz and a Lebowski and this

[55:15] and that.

[55:16] Don't forget that.

[55:19] Everything becomes available and there's no point in owning a machine before the code

[55:22] is done.

[55:23] Great Batman 66, a year from now when the game's great, I'll think about maybe tracking

[55:29] one down.

[55:30] Great.

[55:31] Cool.

[55:32] To save up, make up my mind, actually play it to see if I like it before I go in on it.

[55:37] They won't be on Obtainium.

[55:38] They'll be available.

[55:39] So that's it.

[55:40] Canada, you're like your pinball sage that some of you love, some of you can't stand,

[55:45] but I hope you enjoyed this podcast.

[55:47] I thank you for listening.

[55:48] If you have feedback, hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com and let's talk.

[55:57] Come on the show.

[55:58] I want to hear.

[55:59] I want to see that alien unboxed.

[56:01] I want to know how it plays.

[56:03] Have a great Wednesday, everyone.

[56:05] Be happy, be healthy, hit the gym before you plunge pinball machines.

[56:10] Good day.
