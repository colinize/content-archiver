[00:00] And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain.

[00:10] Today is going to be an interesting day on Pinside because the J-Pop wounds will be reopened

[00:24] and the deep root plans that have been revealed are going to spread through that site like wildfire.

[00:31] And there was so much information that came out at once.

[00:33] It was like the dam broke on what they've been planning.

[00:37] And it was kind of crazy to see they've been planning this stuff for years.

[00:41] All right.

[00:41] Now I want to give my fast thoughts on this.

[00:43] I can't go too long on this podcast because I do have to get to work on presenting to clients today.

[00:48] I have to come up with some new ideas this morning.

[00:51] But I can't not cover this immediately.

[00:54] But for the record, I want to say one thing.

[00:56] I invited Robert from Deeproot to come on the show and talk about this whole thing.

[01:02] I want him to clarify.

[01:03] If he thinks I made any mistakes, if he thinks I spun things out of control or created a frenzy

[01:09] because I saw that in a lot of their statement that podcasters made people sort of spin in

[01:18] you windows out of control and created a bunch of hysteria, I would just like to know what I did wrong.

[01:24] And I happily invite him on the show to clarify anything I got wrong.

[01:28] Now reading through some of what their plans are, I think the one thing I did get wrong was

[01:34] I said that they were going to swap out people's magic girl.

[01:37] So you give them your magic girl that you got from American Pimball and they would give you

[01:43] one of their games.

[01:44] Now it seems you can keep your magic girl.

[01:47] But the reason why, well let's just tackle this from the very beginning.

[01:51] Let me take a macro viewpoint of this because I'm going to go into more detail about this,

[01:55] but I just want to give you my initial thoughts on this podcast.

[01:57] So I think what I want to do is just step back and look at this from a bird's eye view

[02:03] that when you're launching a Pimball company, let's just look at Pimball.

[02:08] It's a toy, it's an entertainment device that's supposed to bring people happiness and joy.

[02:13] And you want to launch a Pimball company.

[02:16] And the first website you put up is all about legal issues,

[02:22] mumbo jumbo's claims and discussions about making people whole about all this stuff.

[02:29] It's all words, right?

[02:30] I mean it's amazing.

[02:31] You're launching a product that is a toy.

[02:34] And the first thing you put up online is a bunch of legal speak.

[02:38] Okay, so that's red flag number one.

[02:41] Red flag number two is you're going to put all the time, money, and effort into making a Pimball

[02:48] company. And you're starting from zero, right? You can go in any direction you want.

[02:53] You got a bunch of smart, wealthy guys in a conference room and you say let's enter the Pimball

[02:57] category. And then you decide to go with the one designer that is toxic, that is lost so much

[03:05] money for people, that nobody has any faith in or any trust or credibility in.

[03:09] So you hit your horse to him, which by the way time and time again is proven to fail.

[03:15] Okay, so there's that part of it.

[03:17] Then you have to navigate this minefield of all the people that John

[03:24] screwed over who didn't get games, vendors who didn't get paid,

[03:29] contractors who were promised a lot of things.

[03:31] Because as I think these guys are going to see, because they haven't really opened up

[03:36] their claims site yet, they're going to realize that there's a lot more people that are

[03:43] owed things than they even realize. Okay, and it's not just money, right?

[03:48] It's not just money people are owed. There's a lot of promises of other things that people just

[03:54] never got. But if you again zoom out, so you're starting off, you're starting your company off,

[04:01] so far behind the April. And I think a lot of people, a lot of people are just like, why would you

[04:09] do that? Why would you create a company that is trying to leverage the one guy, the one guy

[04:18] that nobody wants to hear from any more in Pimble? Okay, so there's that part of it. It just doesn't

[04:23] seem to make much sense. As I said on my previous podcast, I think it's a combination of ego mixed

[04:29] with naivete mixed with stupidity, right? It's kind of like a little amalgamation of those three

[04:36] things. The thing is this, the thing is this. A lot has been going on behind the scenes with

[04:43] deeproot, the plaintiffs, zidware owners. And we, you know, we saw Zambietti come out and say he

[04:50] wasn't going to work with them. Now he's going to work with them. The problem with Robert and the

[04:55] problem with deeproot is simply this is that Pimble is a really small, close knit community. It

[05:03] is. I mean, there's not that many of us out there. Okay. And when you enter into something like

[05:10] this and you try to keep it confidential and you try to keep secrets and you try to do, you know,

[05:17] deals in the shadows and you try to resurface J-pop and you try to do all these things and you try

[05:23] to control the information. It's never going to work because within this deep knit community,

[05:32] this community looks out for each other. And this community is comprised of mostly really good

[05:39] people. There it is. And as much as there are some people in this hobby that might rip you off and

[05:44] there are some people in this hobby who might sell you again, that's really a piece of shit and

[05:48] not give you the right photos and rip you off like that. Or there might be manufacturers that take

[05:52] your money and make you wait for years. For the most part, the majority of people in this hobby

[05:57] are very good people. And when those good people get information that is, you know, of concern,

[06:08] they share that information. So nothing is really private, right? And anything you're doing behind

[06:13] closed doors in Pimble will ultimately come out and become public information. And there aren't

[06:19] really many forums out there where you can share information that is of concern to people,

[06:26] right? I've said it for the longest time that Pinside should be a place where people could air out

[06:32] this information. The problem is the moderators there, yank it down, and they don't allow the

[06:37] conversation to take place. So when Robert says podcastors out there that have sort of been

[06:44] speculating and sharing information they shouldn't have, I really wish he would have just said

[06:48] canadus Pimble podcast because no other podcast out there was talking about this, no other podcast

[06:54] out there was sharing the truth. And I was receiving information about what was going on behind

[07:00] the scenes because the people who share the information, they do care about Pimble and they are

[07:07] standing up for what's right. You know, when I look at this information today and everything

[07:12] they're saying and how they're articulating this, again, it's so much legal stuff to weed through.

[07:18] It's saddens me. I'll tell you why it saddens me because it shows me that they were able to

[07:24] strong armed people into going along with them. And they used force and they used threats to get

[07:31] where they are today. And see, here's the thing, they can't deny that they used force to get people

[07:39] like Zambi Yeti on board, right? Because if they do, if they do, they should know that there's

[07:46] information out there that showcases that they pressured people to getting on board. Now look,

[07:52] now look, I'm not going to share those details, right? Because here's why. Here's why.

[07:58] Zambi Yeti, Jeremy Packer, he's a great guy. If he wants to sign over his rights to all the work

[08:03] he did for John and be done with it, that's his prerogative, right? He's allowed to do that. He

[08:08] should get compensated for his money and fine. Now, deep root owns the artwork and can move forward

[08:15] with whatever they're going to make, right? Okay, there's that part of it. Apple juice, I've been

[08:19] saying for the longest time that Apple juice, you know, he's been really bitter. He's been bitter and

[08:24] says he's been owed money. Now, yes, Apple juice did make upwards of $100,000. But what people are

[08:30] failing to realize is this guy worked for years on John Papaduke's project. So you break up 100

[08:38] grand over five years. That's only 20K a year to code and work on something. And that's not a lot.

[08:44] You see, people forget the the significant amount of time John had people working at his disposal.

[08:51] And here's the other thing. The big thing that John promised everybody who was like busting their

[08:56] butt on this project was a game, right? Apple juice never got his game. Zambi Yeti never got his

[09:02] game. And that game was going to be worth way more than the 16K because it was going to be the

[09:08] most magical game ever. And there was only going to be 16. And it was like giving someone like 20,

[09:12] 30 grand for their services. They never got it. Right? So it's a series of all these people who

[09:19] were made promises who got screwed over and deep root comes into this. And the timeline of them

[09:26] starting this in 2015. So like two years of building this company and this is where we're at,

[09:32] right? They want to remake John's games. They want to remake Zidware games. Now the part that if

[09:38] you just look at it from a distance, they want to remake Zidware games. And basically if you look

[09:44] at what they're selling them for, they're going to each game is going to be worth $5,000. So cheaper

[09:50] than a Stern Pro, they're going to recreate the Zidware games. I don't understand that. I don't

[09:59] know how you run the numbers to show that that's going to be viable. And it's just, you know,

[10:05] it's their plan. It's their plan. And we've sort of seen this kind of plan before, you know,

[10:09] this exchange of credits from Zidware credits to the new credits. We saw it with Pentasia. We saw

[10:16] we tried, you know, American Himbal tried to go down that road. They realized it didn't work.

[10:21] But this time we're being told it's going to be different. And I don't want to, again, I'm going

[10:25] to, I'm going to read through all the details later. This is not going to be the time I do that.

[10:30] I want it, again, I want to say just overall, I really think this is going to create another dark

[10:37] cloud over the hobby. And I've been telling friends why because it just reopens all these wounds

[10:43] for people. It reopens the negative conversation. It basically says over the next two years now

[10:51] because they're saying they're not going to ship games until 2019, we have to sort of live in a

[10:57] world with this J-pop uncertainty again. 2019, John first took deposits. I believe it was like

[11:09] what, 2012, 2013. So six, seven years later, you know, it's just this ongoing thing.

[11:20] I think deep root, if they wanted to enter Pimbal, and they wanted to create goodwill and

[11:26] create a customer base or create excitement, there's so many other directions they could have

[11:32] gone in to get a designer, to get coders, to get a company built of all stars where people would

[11:41] have celebrated and looked forward to their creations. Because, you know, my, my, my tales of the

[11:48] Arabian nights is being, it's being refurbished. And as each part is being pulled out of that machine,

[11:54] I looked at it mechanically and said, there's no way John made this stuff. There's no way he

[12:00] engineered these things. It was a team of people that actually did it. Now, I know deep roots saying

[12:05] they have all these engineers and they're bringing people on board, but that's cool. Like, I'm glad

[12:09] they've got a team. Now, when it comes to a designer, why didn't they just go get one of the

[12:16] existing designers out there and you know how you go get those people? You just pay them more money

[12:22] than they're making currently. Anyone who's ever left the job or a company for a competitor,

[12:28] they leave for more money and a better opportunity. So they were to say, hey, we're going to give you

[12:33] total creative freedom. We're going to pay you more. We're going to give you this team of engineers

[12:37] to make it work. And you're going to have two years to design the game of your dreams. And we've

[12:41] got a series of IPs that we're exploring. How much better would it have been to enter into the

[12:47] pinball market that way? But they chose to go this way. And I just think anyone who chooses to

[12:55] grab the J-pop torch and wave it around the pinball hobby is making it so difficult for themselves.

[13:03] And there's there really is no rationale for why. You know, I would just love to know why,

[13:10] deep root, and all their analysis of the category could ever land on that being a good conclusion.

[13:17] That that is where we should go. It's like me starting a new service tomorrow and be like, you know what?

[13:22] Let's go with Matt Lauer. Let's get him. Let's get him as the anchor. People love him. His ratings

[13:30] were amazing when he was on air. You know, it's just that we live in a world now. We're social opinion.

[13:37] We're social commentary is what drives sales is what drives enthusiasm and hyper on a product. If you

[13:46] do something that pisses off the community, you're going to have a really hard time getting them on

[13:53] board. And the other part, right, the part that I'm just like, I think there are just significant

[13:57] questions on how they're really going to get these things made at a price cheaper than Stern. I mean,

[14:02] come on guys, Stern can get the price down to where they can get it to because of the huge factory

[14:07] 30 years of experience, hundreds of employees, all this stuff, deep root comes in and says they're

[14:12] going to make the most expensive Pimball machine ever, magic girl. And they're going to make it for

[14:16] $5,000 and they have absolutely no experience making Pimball machines. I mean, just just just what

[14:21] that sink in for a little bit. You know, so it's just it's just it's a merry around that is going

[14:29] to continue to spin now for two more years. The other thing is this from a market standpoint,

[14:34] where is the Pimball market going to be in two years when this thing comes to fruition?

[14:41] I mean, we are at a point now where the market is just oversaturated. There are more than enough

[14:45] good games. There's just not enough room or money in people's collections or in their homes or

[14:50] in their wallets to even support where Pimball is at now, right? I'm working Guardians of the Galaxy

[14:56] Pimball machine with amazing art with Stern support. It's going to struggle to sell a lot of them

[15:02] because there's so many options. You know, companies who have a real knowledge of how to make

[15:07] games, you know, Jersey Jack Pimball, you're going to get who Dini coming out. You have all the

[15:12] the remakes from Chicago Pimball. What if Big Lebowski figures out, highway Pimball's not going to stop?

[15:17] I mean, you've got all these companies, all these companies coming out with games and the last

[15:23] thing, the last thing they hobby is like, you know, what we really need? We need some more J-pop.

[15:28] You know, so it's it's it's just J-pop was the most in demand thing. It was so exciting when

[15:34] John announced it where there was such an excitement back in 2013. I think these guys are going to

[15:40] realize that six, seven years later, six, seven years later, the buyers just are not going to be there.

[15:46] They're also not going to be able to manufacture a wow sort of blow you away J-pop magical game

[15:53] and sell it to you for $5,000. There's just no way. And the fact that they're already putting a

[16:00] price and a date on something they haven't built yet, as we all know, is the carnal sin of every

[16:09] new manufacturer. You can put a price or a date until you figure out the bill of materials and you

[16:16] actually build it. And so that's the other part that just blows my mind is there is a roadmap for

[16:22] how to succeed as a boutique Pimball company. That roadmap was created by Spooky Pimball and hardly

[16:29] any of the new boutiques have followed that roadmap to the tee and I don't get it. I don't get it.

[16:37] Everybody thinks making Pimball is easy. Everyone thinks they can do it and then they realize the

[16:42] reality of the situation. My final thought on this whole thing is this. It sucks the life out of the

[16:49] hobby. These guys will suck the life out of the hobby. And what I mean by that is they will simply

[16:56] make a lot of people angry. There's nobody excited here. Even if you're a Razor and Alice in Wonderland

[17:03] investor, are you excited? No, you're just like, shit, now I need to think about this. Most people

[17:09] have probably chalked that money goodbye. You know, it's just this feeling that this is something

[17:16] that should just go away. It's become, J-pop's become sort of like the Donald Trump of Pimball. He's

[17:22] just like a constant headache and I just don't understand, you know why? Why? Like, we can't just be

[17:32] done with it. And as a hobby and as a community, I think people will speak with their wallets and I

[17:38] think people will speak with their opinions and their minds. And you know, for Deeproot, the challenge

[17:44] for them and this American Pimball saw this is to drum up sales and to get people excited. Remember,

[17:51] nobody outside of Pimball gives a shit about Pimball. Nobody outside of Pimball gives a shit about

[17:57] John Papaduke. The people they need to sell this to are Pimball fanatics and enthusiasts. And

[18:03] how is Deeproot going to go to the different shows, the different expos, the different places

[18:08] and drum up excitement for their brand and for their product? They're not going to want to do it.

[18:13] Like, they're not going to want to speak to people. They're going to drop this legal website on

[18:18] the Pimball world and then they're just going to go away for years and then maybe resurface with

[18:24] the game. And it's just going to become another thing that is just filled with speculation, filled

[18:29] with doubt, filled with anxiety. If I were them, what they should have done and what they should have

[18:34] really done is just built the games behind the scenes completely without any of this. And they

[18:41] can't blame me or blame people for speaking because they put John Papaduke up on their website.

[18:49] I didn't. They did. Did they not think putting J-Pop up on the website would create an immediate

[18:56] backlash and an immediate dialogue about what the hell is going on over there. So, you know,

[19:05] I just, we knew this was coming. Now we have the actual statements. We'll go through it at a

[19:11] later date. I hope Robert comes on the show because I do want him to have a chance to speak

[19:16] and hear from him about what his plans are with Deeproot. And, you know, we, I offer everyone

[19:24] a chance to come on this show and speak. And I don't think this show spins things out of control.

[19:29] I don't think this show reports things erroneously. I do not. And I'll tell you why. I know that's

[19:35] the fact because if anything I said was inaccurate, right? And any of what Deeproot was doing with

[19:40] the plaintiffs and all this stuff. If any of what was inaccurate, I would have got a cease and

[19:46] the cis letter. I would have been told that takes up something down or I would have gotten a note

[19:50] to clarify some remarks. I never got that. And they know how to reach me. They know who I am.

[19:55] Canada Pimballatgmail.com. I'm not slandering them. I'm not saying, you know, screw these guys,

[20:03] like get refunds. No, they're not asking for money. That's the that's the only silver lining in

[20:08] this whole thing is they're not asking for anyone's money to get this thing going. This will all be

[20:12] self-financed by these wealthy men. And, you know, history has shown us that wealthy men who

[20:18] self-financed Pimball endeavors. We all know how that turns out. But, you know what? Hey, this time

[20:23] it's going to be different, right? This time it's going to be different. It's an interesting hobby.

[20:29] It's an interesting hobby for sure. I've never sort of seen this in any other hobby. I'm a part of

[20:34] no one ever says, like, I'm going to go make my own video game council and it's going to be amazing.

[20:38] It's like, that doesn't happen in my gaming world. No one says, I'm going to go make my own car.

[20:43] This car is going to be better than anything. And it's going to be a Ferrari, but it's going to be

[20:47] price like a Kia. If anyone said that line in the auto industry, they'd be laughed at. And they'd

[20:54] be laughed at the whole industry. You know what? And that's the thing. It's these promises.

[20:58] It's these false expectations, all these companies set. And it's like, it speaks of just this mixture

[21:05] of confidence, of ego, of naivete and stupidity. You know, it's all those things together.

[21:15] You know, and it just sucks too, because there's a lot of companies out there that deserve our attention,

[21:21] deserve our dollars, our working hard to actually make Pimball machines come out. You know,

[21:26] all those American Pimball people working really hard to get Houdini out. And now they've got

[21:30] like, deep root, savaging the guy that almost sank American Pimball. People forget. So,

[21:36] what about American Pimball who sank hundreds of thousands of dollars into John? Are they going

[21:41] to get some games given to them? Is Dovel going to get like, what, like, 60 games, whatever the

[21:47] money he invested in in John's stuff? And I guarantee you behind the scenes, there's probably a lot

[21:54] of like strong arming going on between deep root and American Pimball because Dovel must own some

[22:00] stuff and have some rights to all the money he sank into Magic Girls. Well, so it's all a mess.

[22:07] And I just think it's comical that Pimball is now relegated to websites with nothing more than

[22:15] legal speak that I need a lawyer to talk to about whether or not I should go in on a Pimball game.

[22:22] How how sillious has it become? I can't wait to just get my Batman, play Pimball and like, almost like

[22:29] take a break from the forum and from Pimball for a while. I kind of feel like doing that. You know,

[22:33] I think when my car arrives, I'm just going to take another like little hiatus because it's just like

[22:40] fuck this hobby at times, right? It just puts nothing but a bad taste in your mouth. I want to

[22:48] just play Pimball and joy it and all these all these boutiques, man, they just suck the life out

[22:54] of this hobby. Everyone have a good day. I hope Robert accepts the invite to come on the show.

[23:01] I would love to talk to Zambiyeti about why he reached an agreement with them. I kind of know why

[23:08] he wanted to be done with it. I respect him. I will always respect. I will always respect people with

[23:13] talent that add value to this world. Robert is a businessman with money. Zambiyeti is a man with talent.

[23:21] Talent. He's the only reason why Magic Girl and Ross and Alice are still even like talked about is

[23:26] because of his artwork. Let's be honest. Nothing John did was impressive. Everything Zambiyeti did

[23:32] and Maddie Andrews did was impressive. These two men are the only reason this guy is still even

[23:37] talked about. Like that's it. All right, have a great day. I got to get to work. Can you add out?
