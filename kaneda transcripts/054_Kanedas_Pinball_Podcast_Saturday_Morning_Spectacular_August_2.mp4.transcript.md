[00:30] This is it.

[00:57] Beautiful day in Rawaden, Gennadikid, and I got nothing better to do than to talk to y'all about Himbal.

[01:10] What a day! How's everybody doing? Ah, let's get on the driver's seat here. Neo Geos in the house.

[01:23] How's everybody doing? Who we got here? Who we got?

[01:29] Canada is in the house? Who we got? Who we saying hello to? Jeremy's here. We've got Louis, Carlos, Charles.

[01:42] What's up guys? Nick is in the house. We're doing it. Now that Nick's here, we're doing it.

[01:48] We're going to do it anyway. We're going to do it anyway. We're going to do it anyway.

[01:56] Dan, what is up brother? Dan, condolences. I read the store. I'm so sorry about

[02:04] your passing. We, you know, hearts going out to you and the family brother.

[02:08] Alan and what's up? Look at this. Sad boy is already in town. He's already rolling in with

[02:14] the 50 bucks. I love this guy. By the way, I think my entire show is just going to be dedicated to

[02:22] Sad Boy from now. Sad Boy, I'm going to do like just just shows just for you brother. Shout out to

[02:28] my boys at next level, Pimball shop in Hillsboro, Oregon for talking the number one spot in, wait,

[02:39] for taking the number one spot in Newsweek's poll for best arcade in the country.

[02:46] More than deserve no one can touch the place. Wow, I got to go next level. Sounds next level.

[02:56] What's going on everybody?

[03:01] How's everybody doing? I'm coming at you live from Rewaiden, Connecticut.

[03:06] The most beautiful town I think in the world. I love my little house. I love my wife, my children,

[03:14] my fans. I love Pimball. I love that. We're going to talk about it. Retro Ralph in

[03:22] Canada, back baby, back. I mean like legit. Like life is way too short to hold any grudges.

[03:33] Whatsoever. Ralph is a good guy. We're going to talk about that later. We're going to just get

[03:39] into it because I actually woke up this morning beyond hungover. Past the point of hangover is the

[03:47] point of eternal happiness. I mean it where you just start to see everything clearly. Beautiful day,

[03:56] no humidity, 70 degrees and sunny. And I'm talking about something that I've been feeling lately.

[04:06] And I'm just going to say it right now for all of you. I think the next three years of Pimball

[04:12] will produce the best Pimball we've ever seen ever. I mean it. I think the next three years of Pimball

[04:23] will produce games better than the last 30 years of Pimball. I think this industry,

[04:32] even though the prices are high, which is another reason why it's going to happen, is people are

[04:37] going to deliver on the expectations, on the themes, on the execution, on the assets, on the layouts.

[04:47] We are going to get the best three years in Pimball over the next three years. Back to the future,

[04:54] I know what C. Richie's next is. You're going to buy it. I know what Spooky's next is. You're

[04:58] going to buy it. I know what Stern has coming. You're going to want to buy a lot of it.

[05:02] It's going to be great. It's absolutely going to be great.

[05:09] Ah, how's everybody doing? Welcome.

[05:15] I am going to go to the beach today, Charles. I'm going to go to the beach. Please give

[05:20] titles of the next three years. You're going to want them all.

[05:23] Sad boy, thank you so much for the 50 bucks. Remember, if you love Canadian Spimball podcasts and

[05:28] you want to show your support, there's a little dollar sign down there. You can super chat me.

[05:33] You can super chat. You come into extra course. I'm going to expo. I always go to expo.

[05:42] They wanted to kick me out last year. I didn't do anything. David Ficks tried to get me kicked out.

[05:47] You know who saved me? When David Ficks tried to kick me out, Melvin said, if you kick him out,

[05:55] I'm taking my game and I'm going home with Alice. The longest line was to play Alice.

[05:59] That's why I got saved. Rob Burke was a nice guy about it. But like, damn Ficks,

[06:05] it wasn't enough just trying to get me in trouble at work. You got it now. I can't.

[06:13] I can't. Everyone just chill out. I'm allowed to say disparaging things about

[06:21] pinball products. That should not get me fired. I am a pinball reviewer, a commentator, a personality.

[06:33] It's crazy, right? Try to get me fired. Almost, almost was successful.

[06:43] Ah, probably. Let's see what Perry said. And again, on Facebook, for you guys,

[06:48] love and Facebook, kick those stars. Oh, man, I'm like, look, I'm just, I'm just happy to be alive,

[06:57] guys. Seriously, I've lost too many friends way too early. When I think about, you know,

[07:05] when you zoom out a little bit, how many of you raise your hands, have lost someone you loved

[07:09] well before their time, right? How many of you have lost loved ones, friends, well before their time?

[07:18] And to hold grudges and pinball and to try to get people fired because they don't like a pinball game.

[07:26] You know, so I was so happy to hear Ralph reach out and just be like, it's too short.

[07:30] Like, let's just, let's just like move on and we both make great content. We both do it differently.

[07:36] And it was so great to hear from Ralph. It's just, it's way too short, right? Life, you know?

[07:42] And it's crazy to me. I walk into a room and Donald Garrison, I like, don't like, come on, like,

[07:49] let's just bur that I go to shake his hand and he goes, I don't want none of that.

[07:56] But wait, wait, wait, wait, we're in person now. And even though we've said stupid stuff,

[08:04] here we are, two grown men and you're a man of God and you reach out to shake someone's hand and

[08:10] just let's let's move on and he refused to. That's crazy to me. Like, I don't care how pissed I am at

[08:20] somebody. If they walked up to me and said, Chris, come on, I'm sorry. Like, let's just move on,

[08:25] handshake. I'm shaking your hand. Life is way too short. Look at this, Dave Sanders, none of his

[08:34] brothers live past them. Man, I'm sorry. I love that you're still talking about this. Look at

[08:42] this. Who is this guy? Yeah, I'm still talking about it because it's life, brother. So yeah, I'm happy

[08:49] to say that retro Ralph and canada have broken bread and reconciled, okay? Reconciliation, baby.

[08:59] Let's talk about what's going on in pinball right now. All right. So here's the deal. Here's the deal.

[09:04] As I said, we got, we got the next four weeks, okay? Like, hey, attention here.

[09:14] It's about to get star wars crazy soon. And I think it's going to come out sooner than we think.

[09:22] King Kong sales are not great. And John Borg and Stern have, they have something big,

[09:33] something big, right? And like, this is going to be the most important pin for stern pinball

[09:45] in a long time. The company needs a hit. And they're going back to the biggest theme imaginable.

[09:54] We're going to talk predator after this. I wouldn't want to shake your hand, Chris, to

[10:00] afraid my lumberjack hands would crush you. Yeah, they probably would. My soft little delicate

[10:09] crunch, Jim hands. All I do is make PowerPoint slides all day long. I know it's stupid. It's stupid.

[10:19] I wish there was more handshake and going on in the world. I wish there was more

[10:23] conversation that was normal. I wish people could not get offended by Sydney Swini jeans ads,

[10:29] which I think are great. I think the world has become a strange place. I think a lot of people

[10:35] are acting like they are victims and they're not. I think a lot of people now just want to tear down

[10:41] anybody who has anything nice. I think people out there are jealous. I think they're envious and

[10:47] I think they're lazy. And I think anybody who has something, they want to take it from you.

[10:53] Right? My parents came from nothing. My grandparents didn't have any money. And anyone who got any

[11:00] success in this world, they want to label you as like evil and you're this and you're that. And if

[11:06] you have kids, you're not allowed to give them any advantage. And if you're beautiful, you're not

[11:11] allowed to use that to your advantage. And if you're this or that or you're funny or you're offensive,

[11:16] then we want to cancel you. Okay? That's what they tried to do to culture and culture push back.

[11:23] And they didn't win. And it's never coming back. And Disney was a bunch of idiots. Other brands

[11:30] were a bunch of idiots. You want to talk to me like just to be a strong man, you're now toxic.

[11:36] Screw that. Canate is not toxic. Baby, I'm all about love, but I can love a beautiful woman.

[11:43] I can love a beautiful pinball machine. How is everybody doing? How is everybody shout from the

[11:51] mountain top, Canadian Perry? You know I will, baby. You know I will. Chris, I'm not offended by your

[11:57] money just when you make fun of above ground pools. Baby, look, I know Don's got an above ground pool.

[12:05] It's fine. He's got a pool. I don't even have room for an above ground pool here. I've got like

[12:10] no backyard. Look, it's all, it's all just for giggles. People, this is the thing. It's like

[12:18] kale over at electric bat. I mean, this when I say this, kale is like my new best bud in pinball

[12:23] because we literally just every day have so much fun with it. And like it's just like it's crazy,

[12:33] right? It's crazy that anybody wouldn't want to be in that click. So I had a great conversation

[12:41] with Buggin Luke because if you listen to my last show, Buggin Luke, Buggin Luke and canada are

[12:52] planning something for the next game launch. And if we work it out, let's just say you're going to

[12:58] want to be a member of the Canadian club. All right. Just going to say it, you know, you know,

[13:07] I know, you know, my friend Ralph got and he should have got, he got a Harry Potter C for making

[13:14] the launch content. I think I think we've got something special planned for this new spooky game.

[13:24] By the way, gang, it's like already sold out. So like if you don't have your name on a list

[13:29] and you, I don't know what you're doing. When will Kingpin, it's never getting,

[13:35] Kingpin's never coming back. Kingpin's never coming back. Gang, it's never coming back.

[13:41] Christopher Frenchy better than in a book. Septic tech. Frenchy, we like, you know, I love that

[13:51] Frenchy's doing this next spooky game. And it's just going to be like, it's going to be

[13:56] Frenchies drop the mic moment. Like we know it is. Like he knows it is. Like it's just going to be his

[14:02] drop the mic. Most beautiful game that everybody's going to want that is going to be bolted to

[14:10] everybody's floor. As I said on my show and I'll say it right now, spooky's next game with all the

[14:16] accessories around 13 grand. It's going to be an $18,000 game instantly. It's just, it's just

[14:23] the way it's going to go. Because we now live in a modern pinball world where you're only going to

[14:31] want like the masterpieces. I'd rather have one game. I pay 18 for then three mediocre games that are

[14:39] 10. If Beetlejuice is somehow better than evil dead, it's going to be better. Sad boy. Thank you

[14:47] again for the 20 bucks. Beetlejuice. Now look, if they don't have a microphone in this game,

[14:59] where the way to turn it on is say Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, what are we even doing here?

[15:05] What are we even doing here? Stop putting so much pressure on Frenchy. No, no, no, he's going to kill it.

[15:14] Stop typing. Canada, I have no room. Stop lying. Wait, wait, wait, okay. I'm trying. Oh,

[15:23] stop hyping. I don't know my glasses. So I can't see everything perfectly. So work with me here.

[15:31] I'm just wearing my my vintage World War II World War II aviators with my Japanese leather wrapped

[15:39] around it. This guy does amazing work. These glasses. I love them. What in a game require power

[15:48] to make a mic work? Yeah, it's true. It's true. All right. So you turn it on and then you have to say

[15:56] Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. How did you put your name on a list? Okay. I'll tell you how I

[16:01] put my name on a list. I did 1118 pinball podcasts. That puts my name on every single list with every

[16:11] single distributor with every single manufacturer for the rest of time. But in all, in all honesty,

[16:20] get on Joe Newhart's list at pinball star. Get on mic at automated list and get on Melissa's list

[16:31] at coin taker. Those are three places to go that are going to get a lot of games. And yes,

[16:38] as franches has coin taker is going to get a lot of these. But get on her list. Call up Melissa.

[16:45] Here's here's a recommendation. How about you call Melissa and Chris up and you just introduce

[16:52] yourself and say hi. How's your day going? How about you build a personal relationship with the

[16:58] distra that's how the world should work. They can give their allotments to anybody they want.

[17:06] Okay. So let's let's let's let's be honest here for a minute, right? Because I've grown adults now

[17:10] in modern world have forgotten how to act like adults. So if you want to get like on a list or

[17:17] you want to get some privileges, then go earn it. Go earn it because everyone's got money now.

[17:25] Like I mean it's like look, look gang. Like I drive around this area of Connecticut, $20 million

[17:32] homes. Like they just keep going. People have money's not the problem. It's who's got the relationships.

[17:40] Who's got the access? Okay. Build those bridges to your distros. She can give those games to

[17:48] anybody. And when people are like, well, why is Canada get well, yeah, because Canada is friends

[17:53] with these people. And when I publicize their companies, I'm helping them out. You know,

[18:00] many sales I've sent to these distro friends of mine. A lot. You know how many kickbacks I've got in

[18:07] zero. You know how many special deals I got zero? How much I got off reach zero? You know, a lot of

[18:14] content creators out there, they pay in full price like Canada. You know, they're saying nice stuff

[18:20] about venom because they didn't buy that venom at MSRP. Not Canada. I didn't buy venom because

[18:31] I'm smart. Like that. Not an idiot. Like you know, who who who bought venom in John Wick? And like

[18:37] like people who bought D and DLE like just light money on fire.

[18:42] Money is a problem for a lot of people. Lots of okay. So like the thing about money is this.

[18:51] If you don't have money, you should not be buying any new inbox pinball machines.

[18:59] And I mean that. Like if you only have like 50K in the bank and

[19:04] we put that in the S&P 500. You know, buy $5,000 of Ferrari stock. You know, don't buy a pinball machine.

[19:13] Nobody's buying $20 million homes by getting on pinball distro list if you can get a game.

[19:22] John, I love you. I think about you, Daley. I can't wait to see you again.

[19:28] We got you got to bring bring the bring the kids.

[19:34] Bring a are there two kids John now or just what's the one? I like my memories going foggy.

[19:42] You got to come up to Connecticut. I know John. Let's see here. Hold on.

[19:51] Who doesn't love to play with the stock certificate money is a problem for a lot of okay.

[20:00] How's everybody doing? Where's Pete Rosen at?

[20:06] Retro Ralph in Canada.

[20:11] It's just too sweet, right? I know everybody wanted to see the reconciliation. I know it makes

[20:16] everybody happy. I told Rob, you know, you got don't ever apologize. Don't ever defend your

[20:22] honor on Pinside. These cargo short wear and mofos. Are you kidding me? Who cares what anybody

[20:30] says about you on Pinside? Do imagine walking into a barn be like, oh man, someone just thumbs

[20:38] down me on Pinside like the like a chick would throw a beer in your face. They should be like

[20:45] grow up bro. What are you doing on Pinside? Some of these dudes have 30,000 posts. Think about

[20:51] that from it. 30,000 posts on Pinside like what? What? You know, one day they're going to wake up

[21:01] and realize what a waste. What a waste all that effort was. Do you have a hall pass with I love

[21:09] Sydney Swini by the way, man. It's like, you know, like my whole company is offended by that ad

[21:14] and I was like, yo, can I get everybody's addresses so I can send every woman who works at this

[21:18] company a pair of American Eagle jeans for Christmas? Like what's wrong with people?

[21:24] What, you know, seriously, she's so hot. Like I tell Brenda like, damn, damn, remember the end

[21:31] in a cold Smith. Those ads back in the day. You got to love it. You got to love how woke culture

[21:41] tries to like tries to act like like hot women can't be hot women anymore and like all women are hot.

[21:50] Man, it's not true. It's like saying all guys are handsome. That's not true either.

[21:56] I love it. I love it. Man, even like talking about this stuff, right? You're like, oh man,

[22:01] Internet's going to come for you. Oh man. I think I need a jaws 50th. I, you know, look,

[22:11] oh, is it guest jeans ads? It was an anaclost myth. Okay. Yeah, but like they wouldn't,

[22:16] they wouldn't try to cancel Cindy Crawford's Pepsi commercial from the Super Bowl. Remember that

[22:20] when she got out of the the Lamborghini? Was it? And, and just seductively drank a Pepsi.

[22:28] Think about that ad today. What this mob would try to do. And you know, it's funny is the

[22:35] funny thing about the woke mob and it's it's the far left. It's the fringe of the far left

[22:40] is the more they do it, the more they're never going to win an election ever again at the top level.

[22:46] So it's like, and again, I'm not, I'm not some crazy mag a conservative guys. You know me,

[22:51] I'm very moderate, socially liberal, physically conservative. I just love watching the political scene

[22:57] and how triggered it makes people. Because I think it's ridiculous. I don't think politics should

[23:03] make anybody upset. And I actually just think what's healthy is discourse. And this is the part that

[23:09] kills me is there's no discourse. You can't talk about stuff. I try to talk, I mean, I work in

[23:16] marketing and I can't even talk about that ad at work because nobody would agree with me.

[23:26] And my own point is I don't, I just don't find it offensive. I think make, I think finding it

[23:31] offensive is making it offensive. It's like a weird world we live in now gang. So I just shut up

[23:38] because I have the biggest bullseye on my back. I do. I know it. I know it. You're not allowed to be

[23:46] a bro in 2025. Like even though the majority of the brands I work on are targeting me my age.

[23:54] And I just mean like you're a man 40 to 60. That's it. I don't care about the color of your skin.

[23:58] Like we're trying to sell beer cookies, cars. You know, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's crazy.

[24:07] Okay. Anyway, should we talk pinball?

[24:14] You know, it's nuts is my dad worked in that building where the, where the shots happened,

[24:18] where the people were killed. 345 park avenue. That was the old headquarters of where my

[24:23] father worked at Bristol Myers Squibb. He worked in that building for 38 years. I went into that

[24:28] building so many times as a kid. My dad worked on the 45th floor. Absolutely a crazy random

[24:38] act of violence sucks like horrible. Like someone I work with knew one of the victims.

[24:43] Again, it's, it's why when we talk about life is short and we talk about pinball prices and

[24:48] the things we mope about like in the end, you zoom out a little bit, you keep zooming out and

[24:52] you just happy to be alive. Happy to be alive in a time when retro ralfing,

[24:56] canada are buds again. Happy to be alive in a time when there's air conditioning.

[25:01] Happy to be alive in a time when there's a dodge demon. Happy to be alive when there's

[25:05] a 14 pinball companies. Happy to be alive. Just be happy to be alive. Just look at what you have.

[25:12] And you know, you always do this do this exercise. If you write down on a piece of paper, I'm glad I'm not.

[25:19] You will walk away happy because there's so many things that can make life worse.

[25:25] Like 15,000 dollar pinball machines.

[25:31] All right, so let's talk about Star Wars. Now, do you guys think it's episodes 4 through 6? How

[25:39] many of you in comments right now? How many of you right now think it's episode 4 through 6,

[25:46] John Borg's next game coming out end of August, early September? How many of you?

[25:50] I'm glad my pool isn't below ground. That's amazing. I think it's based on planet Hoth.

[26:06] Okay. How many of you think it's Star Wars episode 4 through 6?

[26:13] So okay, so chance is it has to be they need the money. I

[26:17] I

[26:19] Man, but I heard it was 1 through 3 at the beginning. Darth Maul. I mean, Maul has a new TV show. I think coming.

[26:27] I just think any any game where that Star Wars theme song hits is gonna crush John Borg.

[26:41] I you know, they've got all the assets.

[26:43] What do you think will happen at prices on Richie's version? Yeah, Richie's version is terrible.

[26:51] I hate I don't use the word hate a lot. I hate that game because I love Star Wars. I think Richie's

[26:58] Star Wars is is an abomination of the theme. I think the the shots are too difficult. I think

[27:09] the lack of magic and the toys is pathetic. I think the tie fighter on a spring is is beyond

[27:15] pathetic. And I think Dwight just destroyed that game. The stacking of the modes, stacking movie

[27:22] scenes on top of each other is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. You have the greatest storyline of

[27:28] all time. And they messed it up. I hate that game. I don't understand anyone who would own it.

[27:35] They sold like 8,000 of them. But it's it's a terrible integration of Star Wars in the pinball format.

[27:51] Well, they're going to use the video assets again. Just don't stack them in a stupid way.

[27:56] It's just it also like the high the whole like making the hyper you know why? Because

[28:02] gang that game is a risk and he was supposed to make Jurassic Park. And the hyper drive mech was

[28:10] supposed to be the raptors running around the park. Makes more sense right? What why would the

[28:18] hyper drive be the main toy in Star Wars? Like that is the dumbest thing I like it's such a small

[28:27] little part of that trilogy. It's going to be 7 through 9 like all the Disney Park stuff.

[28:45] Forse Awakens now man. I don't you know it's crazy man. I almost like forget those new movies

[28:51] even came out. You right? Like forse Awakens like there's something about those films. They

[28:58] did not leave an indelible impression at all. At all. Hyper drive. Hyper drive.

[29:12] All right, so someone wants to talk about Predator. Let's talk about it. Here's my thoughts on Predator.

[29:21] Here's how many games I think they're going to sell. Here's my thoughts on how they release the game.

[29:34] Any other questions about Predator? It's like $15,000 to your door.

[29:41] I mean it's here. It's like I mean I don't I don't understand.

[29:59] You can't make Predator without Arnold. They should have made something else. It's that simple.

[30:04] I'm going to go get another cup of coffee. Hold on guys. Energy levels are fading. I love this show.

[30:14] Beautiful out though. I got to go to the beach. Take the demon out.

[30:24] Oh I don't know how much I drank last night.

[30:34] Oh I'm over and happy. There's nothing better than being hung over and happy. Oh I feel ripped.

[30:55] Oh I don't want to show you my six pack but it's there baby.

[30:58] I can probably make more money on only fans. That's what Brendan tells me. She's like you can get

[31:04] on only fans and make more money than pinball podcasting. How's everybody doing?

[31:14] Yeah my dad's like you maybe shouldn't drink so much. I was telling him this story how

[31:19] I was picking up for Brenda's birthday. No it's for Christmas.

[31:30] All right you know we've got bills. We've got daycare. I got her a couple bracelets from Tiffany's

[31:39] and I only want to spend a certain amount of money. I was like all right you know I want to go

[31:43] extravagant because that's always what I'm known for. I just go extravagant with my wife because I

[31:47] love her to death. I want to say like I don't know I got to spend like three to five. I think like

[31:56] 40-500 bucks on two bracelets or something and we were going to go I think like get him sized

[32:04] or you don't pick him up and get the right size from Tiffany's and we go to lunch beforehand

[32:10] in Westport Connecticut and I had a few espresso martinis you know which is what I do.

[32:18] It's how I roll during the holidays. And then it's not a good idea to have a few espresso

[32:26] martinis before you go into a jewelry store. I did. And you know because when you do that

[32:39] then those diamond bracelets look real good. And you know what they look really good on an

[32:45] a beautiful Irish roses wrist. And so I'm like oh man that looks great on you Brenda. How much?

[32:54] I don't want to tell you how much. Okay more than any pimbal machine costs. And then I'm like all right

[33:01] yeah cool let's take it. That's how canator rolls. And you wake up the next day you're like oh man

[33:11] what happened. I'll tell you what happened your wife is happily married I think so she's with the

[33:19] kids right now there they're there at some play date with another kid. Look I um I've spent way more

[33:27] money on my wife than I will ever spend on pimbal machines. Brenda is a super limited edition.

[33:36] She is a one of one. She is so beautiful so lovely. I worship my wife. Now she wouldn't

[33:46] she would she would tell you all the things I don't do but I worship her. You know I you know

[33:54] in these wealthy towns I tell you I meet a lot of people divorce on their third marriage I'm like man

[34:01] I'm glad I waited and got everything else out of my system because I'm like I don't even understand

[34:07] like why did my jaw get married I mean I like I understand like every like people get married at

[34:12] different ages every every look everything happens for a reason but I worship Brenda.

[34:17] I love I love worshiping her. I love I love I love anyway but this is not the Brenda podcast.

[34:28] Stop trying to get lucky later yet no it's not gonna work it never works.

[34:33] All right so predator dead on arrival let's talk about Dune. Let's talk let's give a shout out

[34:39] can everyone give a shout out to Retro Ralph back in the good graces with Canada Ralph and Canada

[34:46] don't you think we should do a roundtable isn't it time that Ralph Jamie Kale and me all just

[34:55] did a roundtable like wouldn't that be the best roundtale I keep telling that to Jamie like Jamie

[34:59] right now as it stands me commentating on your roundtable videos will get more views than your

[35:08] actual video gets so the answer is clear let's do a roundtable together for you Facebook guys

[35:18] the 16 of you here no stars I might have to just stop Facebook I don't know I don't know who

[35:27] wants the super chat let's test it is it working oh yeah Albert 22 years great

[35:38] all right anybody buy a Dune we got 79 people on YouTube we got 15 on Facebook anybody buy a Dune

[35:48] how's your Dune going anybody isn't that the yeah that is the group Josh it is the group and let

[35:57] me tell you when I talked to Jamie yesterday he's signing back up look the the thing is this

[36:04] I look I'm not going to go into all the details about this but Jamie was mad at me because I wasn't happy

[36:12] with how they launched Dune that's why he canceled my show in talking to Jamie yesterday he's like

[36:21] dude you're right like you were right like everything you said about barrels like you were right so

[36:27] that's why he's signing back up and I'm like look bro I understand like why you got upset but

[36:33] just remember like I I am not worth the money if I was wrong all the time right people would not

[36:42] subscribe to my show or tune in here if what I say about Pimball and the and the companies is

[36:50] inaccurate sure I don't always get every rumor right but in the end I think I called it like I

[36:56] see it like I'm calling it Harry Potter's a hit it's going to be a hit game for Jersey Jack I

[37:04] don't love the way it's coded I hope they balance it better I hope they let more of the movie come

[37:09] through you know when I see these billion score games that people are putting up I I worry that

[37:17] the game doesn't have enough moments of wow it's but it is fun to shoot and maybe see the thing

[37:23] about Jersey Jack games tricky because the wow is just in how it's presented and the way a

[37:31] Jersey Jack game presents itself to you as a player is a wow you know and like GnR has the wow

[37:38] factor but it doesn't shoot great Harry Potter's got the wow factor and it shoots great

[37:45] that like that that that's like two plus two equals four you know it's it's a banger it's a banger

[37:51] hit for them okay let's see I put an hour on Dune loved it but needs more code yep I think

[38:01] you can buy one but you can't actually get one anytime soon yep that's true too what would be

[38:07] Potter be worth if they only made a thousand okay good question Rick asks what would Harry Potter's

[38:13] CE be worth if they only made a thousand CE's um

[38:27] twenty thousand dollars I think that's kind of what that would be the

[38:35] twenty grand would be the price they would go up five thousand dollars of value do you think walking

[38:44] dead remastered is happening um I hate to say it but yeah I do I I think Stern's gonna mess up and

[38:57] not do Tron and do walking dead instead um I hope I'm wrong this is one of those moments where

[39:04] like I hope I'm wrong I hope it's Tron but I think it's gonna be walking dead there was just too much

[39:10] there's just too many people were saying it all at the same time

[39:18] David Van S is in the house should check out the new code on Dune okay David when did the new code

[39:22] drop I think it dropped like yesterday right or two days ago there's a lot of callouts there's a lot of

[39:29] there's a lot of voice actor work in it so um yesterday okay that's what I thought all right

[39:36] so David does does Mike it automate it have a dune yet because that's my closest I mean look

[39:47] the the thing is this is David should just send one to canada I'll send it back bro

[39:55] but David I mean it doesn't it wouldn't hurt to have canada with a dune on loan to play the game

[40:04] and be able to review it and because think about like even if just even if just like half of my audience

[40:14] buys one your sold out

[40:21] kale her nandes kale baby I want to thank kale for brokering the reconciliation with Ralph it's

[40:29] because of kale that Ralph gave me a call and we buried the hatchet yesterday kale can you can you

[40:36] do a little victory lap can we all say what's up kale at electric bat the only man the only man

[40:44] to dethrone canada for favorite pinball podcast even though I did get almost a hundred more first

[40:50] place votes and the weight it woke system beat me we joke about it every day not not sure how I

[40:56] lost Colin never never released the second and third place vote stats so like I lost

[41:03] but kale one and I couldn't have lost to a better guy and he's amazing he's in here too he's

[41:10] celebrating he's been pulled side with the wife he's he's live we're living the life baby sad boy

[41:17] no offense but dune is oh man dune is horrendous and the pain box is quite possibly one of the

[41:24] worst features in a pinball machine ever no BS damn damn David are you gonna take that from

[41:31] sad boy you're gonna donate more money sad boy like like it's not horrendous isn't the pain box

[41:39] when you play with one hand why I love that I actually like that feature I'm not gonna heart this

[41:47] I'll take your ten bucks but I'm not gonna heart this but I you know I want this to be an open

[41:53] discourse um Rachel look Rachel is kale's Brenda he worships Rachel and Rachel is amazing

[42:05] and it's the it's Rachel and kale they have such a good back like I envy you guys because you

[42:11] get to wake up and do what you love every day I mean Brenda and I still have to go work for other

[42:14] people but you two we're gonna open up electric bat East Coast it'll be Brenda and Canada that

[42:22] that are like running it and and we should do it with special guest Ralph retro Ralph

[42:30] yeah kale's Brenda oh man

[42:37] let's see we don't work a day in our lives nope when you do when you love what you do for a living

[42:43] that's the way to do it oh you know the problem is kale I you know living in this expensive part of

[42:50] the country you sometimes have to like work a day a day or a thousand right um but no thank you

[42:59] for for making um for making that reconciliation happen it's been a it's been a great 24 hours

[43:05] having Ralph back and um you know look miracles do happen you know I I would love it if Don and

[43:12] Canada would bury the hatchet I've said it many times you know there's there's nobody wants to

[43:17] be into any content creator drama like there really isn't I feel like the only drama left

[43:23] is Canada and Don and that's that's not on my side of the fence you know that I tried to shake the

[43:28] man's hand I tried to bury the hatchet you just you know why he won't do it and it's a sad reason why

[43:34] he feels that he will lose respect from his followers if he does and that's sad because it's sad

[43:43] that the the pressure is on him to stay angry and to stay divided that's sad to me Don be the

[43:54] bigger man man don't care about those people will still follow you

[44:02] yeah of course yeah kale's gonna do it kale already kale solve it with Ralph he can solve it with

[44:13] Don I think we got the right guy on it you know you know it's funny is yesterday uh and I don't

[44:19] know if Jamie's here right now I don't think so but like you know Jamie's text to me he's like

[44:22] I get to all you know Jamie gets like upset at times and I just call him up because you know because

[44:29] I think he called me bipolar and I'm like bro I'm not bipolar man like it's everything we're doing

[44:35] is orchestrated and meant for entertainment sake and he's like yeah yeah yeah you're right he's like

[44:39] you're right you're right he's like he's like dammit you know Jamie's like he like wants to hate me

[44:45] and then we have a phone call is I I get it like you're right man you're right it's like Jamie

[44:51] just needs me to tell him to man up is the thing and then when you do he's like he's like you're right

[44:57] you're right you're right right um I'm excited to play dune someday uh it's a short

[45:07] uh saving your ball it's not a certain okay do you agree with don's list of stern's next six titles

[45:15] uh I haven't Pete Rosen what what what what are uh what what where's don's list of stern's next six titles

[45:21] does he he knows all next six okay put put put put them up here Pete let's see let's let's talk about it

[45:29] um I let me let me guess at what I think stern has I think Star Wars Pokemon

[45:36] I I do think fallouts coming I think walking dead uh I think

[45:45] the super mario brothers will be a stern game

[45:50] all right one is Star Wars great that's that's nothing new I want to see there's anything on don's

[45:55] list that we haven't already talked about so we know we know about Star Wars

[46:01] what else what's number two walking dead we knew that okay nothing new nothing new there

[46:14] okay what else come Pete I don't know why it's taking you so long Pokemon okay nothing new there

[46:20] now the next three will be the interesting ones because we knew all those transformers

[46:29] okay that's interesting

[46:36] fallout we knew about which is gonna be terrible

[46:47] ACDC again

[46:48] I mean the only one that's like interesting is obviously transformers but

[47:04] you know I I yeah I mean I think what makes me nervous now is like

[47:14] who's doing transformers are probably Brian Eddie

[47:26] oh you like my gummy bears

[47:33] I love I love I got this for Brenda

[47:37] oh you know when I I sold my Batman SLE and I I bought furniture for Brenda in this house

[47:45] I sold it for 25 27 thousand dollars I bought a kitchen table I bought

[47:55] Jonathan Adler furniture and I don't regret it

[48:02] yeah so George Gomez might be doing the transformers home

[48:06] I don't know doesn't it feel like Stern's out of ideas fallout's gonna just bomb

[48:12] like they I don't I don't even know like who's buying that

[48:17] they might as well only offer it to Dingo berries that bought venom in John Wick you know

[48:22] like talk about Dingo berries like who bought a John Wick or Venom Ellie like like new in box

[48:29] you ever think about that I mean I don't mean to be mean but I'll be mean a little bit what more on

[48:35] how much of a moron did you have to be and I'm sorry if you bought it just just take this with

[48:39] the grain of salt but how much of a moron did you have to be to buy John Wick or Venom Ellie

[48:46] at 13,000 I mean seriously think about it yeah you know why you know why you're making money

[48:54] kale because oftentimes it's the games that nobody wants to own that they'll play a lot on location

[49:02] it's it's an interesting phenomenon like you get the curiosity quarters is what I call it

[49:08] you'll make more money with curiosity quarters than you will on a game that everyone owns at home

[49:15] because they're not gonna go out and play it it's true I'm smart guy went to boarding school I

[49:22] went I went to private middle school you can't beat my intelligence the only thing I'm stupid with

[49:29] is how I spend my free time making pinball content not it's not smart it's not smart I should have

[49:35] done something else I would be making a lot more money

[49:42] yeah in my haircut right no peep my mom I saw my mom this morning she she once again is like I

[49:48] hate your haircut like what are you doing like you're absolutely embarrassing yourself it's my mother

[49:53] talking so the thing is the thing is this I'm annoyed that Guns and Rose is not coded better

[50:10] the the November rain light show doesn't alter throughout the song it's still annoying me I didn't

[50:15] realize it I for the first time I played through the whole song I thought it would have like a

[50:18] dramatic ending I thought when slashes guitar solos would come in the game would alter no it's just

[50:24] it just loops for 10 minutes the same light show

[50:35] look at we got David vines we've got Christopher franchi someone go tell retro Ralph to join come on

[50:42] does anyone have Ralph's like I can't because I'm on Facebook right now but someone go tell Ralph

[50:48] to pop it and say hi can someone do that who's got who's got Ralph's personal let's get him in here

[50:56] he used to hang out here anyone can someone who's gonna do that kale you gonna do it kale go go text him

[51:09] I don't know I think Stern's in trouble gang I think Stern's in big trouble I think they blew up

[51:14] their collector community and I think they're not gonna get it back and I think they don't know

[51:19] what to do and I think they allowed too many of these other companies to gain too much momentum and

[51:25] too much enthusiasm and I think the other companies have done a better job of creating more of a

[51:31] family vibe like I think Jack being head of community Jack danger is a good move I think it's

[51:37] it's important move because I think they realize like if we don't win over the people we're not going

[51:43] to win over the profit right and we're not going to win this anymore like we can't just keep

[51:48] shoving these games at distros you know because Stern's biggest problem is they they act it

[51:54] like the distros are their customers and that's all they cared about and they burn the distros they

[51:59] let too many distros in they let too many dealers sign up and that's what led to a thousand alise

[52:04] if anyone thinks it's anything other than that they're wrong the reason why there's a thousand

[52:08] alise is not because there's the man for it it's because Stern signed up way too many dealers and

[52:13] distros and now just wants to thin out the allocations and it didn't work and you know they've left a

[52:20] lot of people stockpiled with inventory they've they've got inventory stockpiled through the roof and

[52:29] you know the dam's gonna break and you know Costco deals are not going to save them they need to

[52:36] they need to return to what made their formula work and I don't think they are

[52:49] I mean look I I I hearing that list of games acdc with a screen they're they're going to do it

[52:58] right Stern is absolutely gonna remake all of the DMD classics with spike three and they're going

[53:09] to charge you thirteen thousand dollars for a game that was one six you know you gotta think

[53:13] about the the the the the the the nameness of that and that's what they're gonna do I'm here late

[53:19] with suck Robert there are zero Facebook stars Pete Rosen are we are we are we doing this

[57:34] carry hardy's been like oh there's a carry carry you know I think a lot of um I think a lot of

[57:41] content creators are struggling right now to make entertaining shows because they they they need

[57:46] pinball news um and as Kael and I always say pinball news is stupid like that's not what makes it

[57:51] fun you you tune into canators pinball podcasts because we talk and we we make it entertaining every day

[57:56] doesn't matter there's only like five real news days a year in pinball like but it's the commentary

[58:03] it's what's going on this week you know you got to read pinside you got to stay in involved in the hobby

[58:10] what what a john say

[58:15] hmm top gun I don't know

[58:20] is Sandra Bullock speed why not

[58:27] Todd Tuckies on Facebook right now Todd get the YouTube brother are you on YouTube Todd

[58:33] I I think YouTube's where it's at I mean more people prefer YouTube I'm just doing it on

[58:37] the only reason I'm doing this on Facebook is because the rewatches on Facebook are huge

[58:44] huge like for some reason now the algorithms like 4,000 people are now watching these videos

[58:49] I'm not sure if they want to be watching but they are it's 11 o'clock let's do this for like 10 more

[58:55] minutes because it's so nice outside and I want to go improve my tan it's so freaking nice out

[59:03] all right

[59:05] ah how's everybody doing yeah look there is a little bit of a low going on in pinball

[59:11] but it's going to pick up real fast and I think it's good because I think a lot of us are

[59:15] traveling we're spending money it's the summertime I don't know is the yes of someone under NDA

[59:25] no it's not

[59:28] you learn life lessons on this channel well I you know like I mean

[59:32] I don't know if we're learning I think we're all learning as we go

[59:38] life is really crazy right now for for a lot of reasons you know the world is a crazy place

[59:44] it's it's crazy that you can we live in a world where there's so much to be thankful for

[59:53] yet there's so much anger and hate and atrocities still happening in the world that is

[01:00:01] mind-boggling as the world gets smaller I can't you know it's like I mean who knows

[01:00:06] with the answers right it's like look at Russia like what happened to Russia

[01:00:12] we they they they turned the corner and then they went right back and then the and then the world

[01:00:18] just stood by and let it happen what what's happening in the middle east what's happening you know

[01:00:26] I you know I have my friends are Jewish I mean I'm just going to say like the the the amount of

[01:00:35] modern-day anti-semitism in here is ridiculous like what again and these are very complicated

[01:00:42] situations I do not pretend to have a a full understanding of foreign affairs in some of these

[01:00:49] situations that are thousands of years in the making but man I just hope for all of our children's

[01:00:57] world that a few things happen that that like the hate and the anger dissipates that

[01:01:04] social media does not ruin the next generation for life I'm I'm worried about Gen Z I think Gen Alpha

[01:01:10] and Gen Beta are going to be fine I think Gen Z for some like they were just they just got the

[01:01:15] worst period of it all and they don't know how to climb out of it they really don't like when

[01:01:23] when a Genes ad is upsetting you you're like something's wrong like you you you don't know how to

[01:01:30] handle like what life is going to throw at you ah what did you and so you can I ask you guys a

[01:01:41] question aren't there just like certain games that like it does it doesn't even feel like they even

[01:01:46] came out games like Avatar right think about like have you ever heard anybody like talk about Avatar

[01:01:57] like I I know like oh that there's there's this moment in Avatar pinball where no no one ever said

[01:02:05] that ever doesn't feel like it came out right what are the games are like that what are the games

[01:02:11] like they came out but did anyone really pay attention ninja clips talk about bringing down the room

[01:02:25] right now

[01:02:31] spinal tap yeah man is it out is spinal tap out

[01:02:39] is it like it is that like I feel like Queen Queen is like that too right

[01:02:45] oh damn pinball powers throwing dune in that list damn it doing just came out we can't we can't

[01:02:52] you David how many dunes have shipped we've got David here how many dunes have gone out the door so far

[01:03:00] 123 okay now alien felt like it came out abba there's another one I mean look I mean I

[01:03:25] I I'm worried about the pinball brothers I think the weirdest launch ever

[01:03:40] what you guys want to talk about right now maybe a few more minutes then I'm gonna go enjoy the

[01:03:45] sun and the beach I think Kong is going to be Owens worst selling cornerstone um

[01:03:55] do you think Kong is gonna sell worse than Avengers you might be right I think I actually think

[01:04:01] Avengers is a better game than King Kong I think it's a better shooter Kong is not bad it's just

[01:04:07] the problem with Kong is like it's not bad but it's not great

[01:04:15] and that's the problem with Kong you know what it is to about King Kong is you just you just

[01:04:22] really don't want to own it you know I like I think it's a good shooting game but there's nothing

[01:04:31] about King Kong that makes me want to own it and again the fact that they made the Ellie look

[01:04:35] exactly like the premium and the pro it's like f off-stern just f off and you know I don't often

[01:04:41] tell Stern to f off but come on what what lazy ass shit is that I don't mean to curse but I just

[01:04:46] curse you're gonna try to sell me a 13,000-dollar product that looks exactly like the 6,000-dollar

[01:04:51] product what how come on Jeremy Packard you're the head of art now you need to make better decisions

[01:04:59] they they you can't make the base level look as good as the top of the line like it's just stupid

[01:05:09] like that is that is terrible marketing and that is a marketing decision they should have just

[01:05:15] had the Kong logo on the pro just put the logo sandbag it

[01:05:18] so you just you don't you don't want to own it you can't even get 11 for a Kong Alina in a box

[01:05:33] not even open the problem with Kong is I'm not emotionally invested in the theme because story

[01:05:42] I'm not yeah like Kong has a lot of problems in that department and what's what's kind of sucks is

[01:05:51] Kong is a very emotional story Kong is a very heartfelt story and they they didn't nail it

[01:05:58] they they turned it into this rainbow bright weird mashup of like the big ape doesn't feel like

[01:06:10] it doesn't feel like Kong should have been this beautiful game it should have been a throwback to

[01:06:20] not New York City when that when the original takes place right was it like 1930s whatever

[01:06:29] 40s New York City the whole game should have looked beautiful like traditional New York like old

[01:06:36] school classic New York like that original Kong movie poster and it should have been a beautiful game

[01:06:43] where you know you're trying to save King Kong and he you know he he falls from the Empire's

[01:06:51] day building and dies like that's this game just feels like it just misses the emotional connection

[01:07:03] of what people love about King Kong but again if they want it to go more towards like modern day

[01:07:13] King Kong like the you know the action movies with Godzilla then they should have done that they

[01:07:18] should have licensed those movies and they should have made that game they didn't they it's just

[01:07:22] this it's it's they just didn't license any of the Kong stuff

[01:07:28] and so I 100% agree with end though it shoots great and it's fun it's addictive the shoot but

[01:07:35] you're just not connected to it that is why it's a great location game and then you walk away and

[01:07:41] you save yourself 13 thousand dollars and you sign up for Canada's pinball podcasts and then

[01:07:46] Canada saves you tens of thousands of dollars because you take his advice over the last four years

[01:07:51] I've saved my I've saved my fan base tens of thousands of dollars because they listened to me

[01:08:00] don't buy James Bond's 60th anniversary edition those who did lost 12,000 dollars

[01:08:10] Mr. Masculine retro Django in the house did anyone go reach out to Ralph is he joining

[01:08:17] and we got jang is in the house we've got David Van Es we've got spooky Luke we've got

[01:08:25] you know this is a good group is a good group gang I wanted to say this

[01:08:31] have an amazing Saturday give your kids a call if they're not near you give them a hug and a

[01:08:37] kiss if they are give everybody you love a ring today you know today I woke up and I just

[01:08:46] drove down to see my parents there 30 minutes away I don't do that enough I call my dad every day

[01:08:55] and and my mom every once in a while my mom is amazing she the reason why I talked to my dad more is

[01:09:01] my dad is more even keel and my mom just will never stop being my mom which is why I love her but

[01:09:09] but the bud is you know she'll find some reason to give me some hard motherly love and I you know

[01:09:17] there's just there's only so much a son can take but she framed these amazing she has an

[01:09:24] art gallery she framed these amazing pop culture car pieces of artwork for me that I'm going to

[01:09:31] figure out where to put them but here's the thing here's the thing

[01:09:36] and I've been feeling this a lot lately not just that life is short but the time the time we have

[01:09:46] together is where all the value is in this hobby it's the people I mean kill and I've been saying

[01:09:53] this those who emphasize too much the games are missing what makes us love this hobby

[01:10:02] if not another game came out new in box we would still love this hobby because of the people

[01:10:09] and that's where the memories are that's where the moments that matter are and that's where

[01:10:13] the magic lies it's all the different personalities we all come from different walks of life we all

[01:10:18] come from different mommas we all come from different places we all have different you know

[01:10:22] socio economic backgrounds and yet this analog toy which can't be digitized has brought us all

[01:10:29] together I was banned from pinside if I wasn't banned from pinside I would not have started the podcast

[01:10:37] if I didn't start the podcast I don't meet most of you it's great it's beautiful it's just kind

[01:10:44] of like real it's like a real beautiful story um what this hobby has created in a community and

[01:10:50] I love it because it's like it's small like it's neat like we're like a nano community
