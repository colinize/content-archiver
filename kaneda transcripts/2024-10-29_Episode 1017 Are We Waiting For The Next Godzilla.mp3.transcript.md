[00:00] All my friends live in the same small town, My parents live in the same small town, My child is a small town, Prevents me love and do the team.

[00:30] So, what do you feel? We're sort of just waiting for the next great game to come out. A lot's been happening in Pinball, but let's be honest, nothing is universally taking over the pinball space.

[00:44] A major congratulations to Chris Turner, who has sold 100 Ninja Eclipse machines. And the reason why I want to give Chris a real nice shout out is remember a year ago, he showed up to Expo with a game in a weird cabinet, right? He was trying to do new stuff.

[01:04] He thought the only way to differentiate his company was to mess around with what people expect in a pinball cabinet. And that was very much, I think, like Robert Mueller still in his head.

[01:17] And what did Chris do? He spent the last year putting the game back into a normal cabinet. He released only 100 of them and it's priced now in a place that feels like a bargain. It's like 6,600 bucks or something.

[01:31] And so he went to Expo this year and the four games on the show floor were sold out and he's now has orders for 100 Ninja Eclipse games, which he can now make.

[01:44] This is how you start small in the boutique pinball space. You don't rip people off. You don't lie to people about deadlines. You don't take their money and then deliver nothing. You run at the pace you are capable of.

[01:57] So Chris, I'm excited. Now look, Ninja Eclipse is not the game for me, but it means that he will then learn some stuff as he makes this game and move on to his next game.

[02:08] And we all know real success lies in pinball when you get to a licensed theme product and you're not going to be able to make a licensed theme product unless you can show a license holder. You know how to make a game.

[02:21] So Chris, congratulations. We're happy to see 100 games sold. Now, speaking of a company that sold a lot more than 100 games, let's talk a little bit about Avatar and November.

[02:32] So the Avatar CEs were supposed to be out in November. Do any of you think you're going to get your Avatar CE in November? Now look, that's a week from now.

[02:44] And I know a lot of people are distracted by the election and we probably can't wait till we just move on to how America will be come November 6.

[02:52] But the thing is this, they did not have these bait or play fields ready to go and in great working order at Expo. And does that mean they are still at the drawing board with this game?

[03:05] And we all know like Avatar has had a sluggish start, right? It hasn't had this sort of take my money now sort of energy around the theme.

[03:14] And I think it is the theme. I think there's only so much you can do with toys and mechs. And maybe if it had more moments of wow, the code is getting better.

[03:24] But here's my observation of this game launch. They spent $100,000 on an amazing launch video. And then what have they done since then?

[03:37] This is my concern. It almost feels like Jersey Jack doesn't really know how to market this game now.

[03:45] There have been code updates. Has Jersey Jack had any official streams of the new code? Have they done anything with Mark Sidon to get people excited about this game on a weekly basis?

[04:00] When you have a title like this, which is a slow burn seller, right? This is not a game. Think about it. This $100,000 video did not get them thousands of orders.

[04:12] Now they have to play the long game. And I'm just a little bit concerned that as every month goes on, we're getting closer and closer to Harry Potter.

[04:24] People know that's next. And there's also not a lot of exciting wow to show people in the game right now. They're struggling with the UV.

[04:35] It doesn't have this like wow moment the way it does in Stranger Things. I also think everyone's looking at UV ink now, not as a feature, right?

[04:46] It's not a mech. It's not a toy. There's not a lot of engineering that goes into UV ink. You walk into a Spencer's GIFs in a mall and every poster's black lit in a much brighter way than a $15,000 pinball machine.

[05:02] And I think we just want more. We want themes that we want more. We want the translation of those themes into pinball to be done better.

[05:11] And we're also at a point now, everybody, and I think you'll agree with this and we're seeing it with X-Men. You really only get one chance to make a first impression.

[05:20] And if you make people wait months after months after months to see the game potentially wake up, we're just not going to throw money at these things if that's the way you launch your game.

[05:32] I mean, look at Pulp Fiction LE. I just read something that was absolutely ridiculous. Here's a game that over two years ago everybody was excited about.

[05:43] We were still in that period of the COVID frenzy. We were kind of buying anything that excited us and there was a great 20 minute launch video that Zach put together interviewing the team, why they made the game that way.

[05:57] Everybody was excited. And if you got an LE, you were really happy. You felt like you got your hands on something truly special.

[06:05] And now look at the vibe and the energy around this game. It's been out forever. The LEs are still not on the line.

[06:14] And now I read something that's like, well, they just got in a part for the topper so now they can make the games. Are you kidding me?

[06:21] How could that topper that just moves back and forth? That's it. It just shimmies back and forth as they're dancing and it's just a plastic scope.

[06:31] How could that topper take longer to engineer and manufacture a production ready version than an entire pinball game takes to make?

[06:42] Jack Danger made all of X-Men in 12 months and CGC can't make a topper in two years.

[06:50] And it's at the point now where I just don't care at all. I'm walking away from my LE spot. I have an LE spot. A lot of you have LE spots. I don't care anymore.

[07:00] I'm walking away from it on principle alone. I just don't like CGC. I don't like the way they treat their customers. They say absolutely nothing to any of us.

[07:10] What is that? In what world do you get to get away with the worst communications imaginable?

[07:17] I think it's at a point now where some of us might just want to speak with our wallets. And if you're going to do this, I'm not going to invest in this company.

[07:25] And the only time I'm going to buy a CGC game now is if it's in a box at a distributor ready to go.

[07:33] And here's what I think is going to happen. There are going to be now plenty of Pulp Fiction LEs in boxes at distributors.

[07:40] Because I think a lot of people are over it. I think a lot of people have moved on.

[07:44] And when you know what's coming down the pipeline in the pinball industry, this game, I don't know. It had a moment. It had a moment. The moment has passed.

[07:54] And I just don't think there's going to be enthusiasm where like all thousand of those LEs are going to be spoken for.

[08:01] They're not going to go up in price. And you're going to be able to get one easily without having to wait more than like a weekend to get it.

[08:08] Shame on you, CGC. There's just no excuse why this company can't get it together.

[08:14] Alright, so let's move on. We've got Stern's X-Men. A game that is still being baked.

[08:19] A game that I think the jury is undecided on which direction this game will go.

[08:26] I'm still somewhat surprised the LEs have not sold out. But then I'm not surprised because I think the community again has moved on.

[08:34] We've moved on from I have to have it right now. You've seen so many people run at these LEs and lose money.

[08:43] Everything has gone down in value. Even Jaws LE has gone down in value.

[08:48] Metallica LE probably won't go down in value, but we're not talking about Metallica. We're talking about X-Men.

[08:55] Now Metallica LE coming out and creating that frenzy at Expo obviously does not help X-Men sales at all.

[09:03] And we're a fickle bunch. We're like a flock of pinheads. We fly to the next exciting thing coming out.

[09:10] We had a lot of fun on the Saturday show figuring out someone who would win a chance to buy one at MSRP.

[09:17] Pavel, congratulations on winning that. It was great. We had 47 club members trying to get that spot.

[09:24] Look, I wish I had 46 other ones to give you guys. I think by the time the X-Men code gets great,

[09:31] by the time they figure out the auto plunge issues, everyone will have moved on to something else.

[09:39] And also because X-Men Pro is so good, I think X-Men is just going to be a game where the players are going to enjoy it.

[09:47] But I think the collectors and everybody else who want to spend like $9,500 or more on a pinball machine,

[09:53] I think they're kind of going to avoid buying X-Men at MSRP.

[09:58] Alright, and then we got what's next from Stern Pinball. I put up the rumor. I heard that its fallout is something Stern is working on.

[10:05] I don't think fallout is going to come out in 2025. I think fallout might be a 2026 title.

[10:12] But again, it's just a rumor. I don't know for sure. But it's always fun to speculate what's around the corner.

[10:18] If you were to ask me, I think in 2025, we're going to see Dungeons & Dragons from Brian Eddy.

[10:25] We're going to see King Kong from Keith Elwyn. We're going to see Spike III.

[10:29] And I think if this Metallica remastered has shown us anything, I absolutely think we're going to see a Tron come back out.

[10:37] Stern knows this works. They know this works tremendously well.

[10:42] And so I think we're going to see another Tron. Will we see another game by Jack Danger? Does he need a break?

[10:48] You know who we need to see a new game from? John Borg. Where's John Borg's new game?

[10:53] I know he worked a lot on this. Well, maybe it's Tron. Because if he worked as much on the new Metallica as he did on the original Metallica,

[11:02] then maybe this is his way to be successful. And I think he's on to something.

[11:08] And Stern Pimball, if they're going to remake the best of yesteryears with great new games, I'd hate to be competing against Stern.

[11:17] They're going to have to deal with the fallout, not the game fallout, but the fallout from all of those older collectors who are going to be pissed off when they make a new version.

[11:28] Now, if you think about Tron, there's only 400 Tron LE owners. So that's an interesting question, right?

[11:35] Do we piss off those original 400 owners, make 500 new LEs, and then a new premium?

[11:42] Because remember, Tron never had a premium. It was just the LE and the pro. And when Stern first released Tron, on the box itself, it said Tron premium.

[11:53] So it's interesting to see what they're going to do with their new factory. They absolutely need to continue to make games every single month.

[12:03] They can't have a slowdown. It's not going to happen. I mean, Stern's going to keep firing.

[12:08] I worry in general about the oversaturation of pinball in general. There's so many companies. There's so many products coming out.

[12:18] There's only so much room everybody has. I really do think in 2025, it's going to get even softer as a market, not stronger, unless everybody dials it back.

[12:31] I mean that they've got to start thinking about dialing down production a little bit, dialing down the price a little bit. It just can't keep going at this pace.

[12:41] I think everybody's going to burn out. I think the companies are going to burn out. I think the customers are going to burn out. I think the collectors are going to burn out.

[12:49] I think location players are going to burn out. I have to learn another 18 rule sets because there's 18 new games this year.

[12:56] I think everyone just needs to relax a little bit in pinball. I think everybody needs to chill. I think everybody needs to realize we don't need 18 new games a year or 12 new games a year.

[13:06] There's not room for that much pinball. And if you come out with a major theme like a Back to the Future or a Harry Potter, you might be good for a while.

[13:15] When a game enters the top 10 on Pinscider, top 15, if you make a game that climbs that high on the top 20 games of all time, that's going to satiate people for a year.

[13:27] Like how many of you out there who own a Godzilla have gotten deep into that game? How many of you?

[13:33] Every time you walk up to it, isn't it still fun? Isn't there still a ton to do?

[13:37] I mean, that's how I feel about Guns N' Roses. Every time I walk up to it, it gives me more than enough to try to do.

[13:43] And I still haven't scratched the surface at what's in the game.

[13:48] And so as I'm content with one game and most of you have more than one great game, do you really feel the need to put another new thing into the lineup?

[13:59] For some of you, the answer is yes. But I think for a lot of people, the only way a new game is going to make its way into your lineup is if it's amazing.

[14:09] And again, I think we're all just waiting for the next Godzilla. I don't think there's been a game since Godzilla that's had the sort of universal love that that game has had.

[14:19] We got a little bit close with the beginning of Foo Fighter Sales, but that trickled off. That theme was never going to win over most people.

[14:27] Jaws was good. Jaws was good, but I think people were just really disappointed with the lack of the shark eating the ball.

[14:33] Nothing from Jersey Jack really captivated people. Elton John is loved by those who own it, but it's not being bought at volume numbers like Guns N' Roses was.

[14:44] So what do we think about Spooky's next game? Spooky, are they going to make that game that everybody loves?

[14:49] Well, I think they're at the point now where it would be nice to tease the new game on Halloween because if you think about it, sales of Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre are over.

[15:01] Like there's no new sales happening. I was at Expo. Those games on the floor were for sale, and I don't think they sold many of them.

[15:10] And so now we're all looking forward to the next game. As you know, and I know, and Jason Knapp knows, we've known for the longest time, it is going to be based on the Evil Dead.

[15:20] It is Evil Dead 1 and 2, those two movies. It is not Army of Darkness. They got Bruce Campbell to do the callouts.

[15:28] And look, Evil Dead, obviously it's not a mainstream thing. It's not as popular as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street.

[15:37] It is definitely a theme that makes sense for Spooky Pinball. Is this another case of they're making games for themselves?

[15:44] Or are they making games for the larger pinball community? The good news is this, I don't think they're going to make anywhere near a thousand of them.

[15:52] I think we might see 666 or 800 or some other number maybe from the Evil Dead world, but I know they're never going to do a Scooby-Doo again.

[16:00] They're never going to announce like 1969 Scooby-Doo. Like that's just too many. There's no demand.

[16:07] So I think Spooky Pinball has like two to three games that are in development. And so if that is the case, I don't think they want to make Evil Dead for an entire year.

[16:17] I think they want to get another game out like in the summertime of 2025.

[16:22] So I could see this being a smaller run game. And if they do announce that only 666 Evil Dead games, guess what?

[16:31] They're going to sell out like right away because that's like the perfect amount for the theme.

[16:36] And Spooky Executes, right? No one's worried that when they give Spooky money, they're not going to get their game and the company's not going to be transparent.

[16:44] Like they are probably the most transparent company in pinball, which makes everybody feel good.

[16:50] Now, if the quality's there and the mechs are awesome, you know, they're going to integrate the movie into the game perfectly.

[16:56] They're going to do it. They're going to do it. You're not going to see muted clips like you do in Avatar.

[17:01] They're not going to need a hundred thousand dollar sizzle launch video to sell this game.

[17:08] They're going to sell this game because they actually put toys into it and they actually integrated the theme in the right way.

[17:15] And they picked a cult theme that people love. And that's a smarter marketing move than Avatar with muted clips.

[17:24] And nobody would ever get an Avatar tattoo. I mean, that is the test people.

[17:28] All right, everybody. So that's where we're at. That's where we're at.

[17:31] Is there going to be another big move by the end of the year other than Spooky Pinball?

[17:38] Is Stern Pinball going to release its next cornerstone in December?

[17:42] Remember, they released X-Men in August. So timing-wise, it should be right around there.

[17:49] And I'm really curious to see what Jersey Jack does in November with these CEs of Avatar if they're going to find a way to fix the UV and get more moments of wow into the code of that game.

[18:03] And we'll be covering it all here on Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[18:07] Everybody, we will talk again maybe before Halloween if not have a happy Halloween.

[18:12] And let's see what happens in this pinball world.

[18:15] I don't know about you, but I feel like all of our money is probably pretty safe over the next month and a half as we wait for the big stuff that is down the road.

[18:25] Maybe now is a good time to spend your holidays engaging with your family and not buying, buying, buying.

[18:32] I think the world is over consuming and we all feel it. I mean that.

[18:37] The only thing you need to consume every month is Canada's Pinball Podcast and we scratch the itch, right?

[18:42] It's $5 a month. It's nothing $60 a year.

[18:46] Everybody, thank you for being here. We'll chat soon.

[19:02] Yeah.
