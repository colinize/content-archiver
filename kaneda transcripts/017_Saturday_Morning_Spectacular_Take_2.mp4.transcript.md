[00:00] Is it going to work?

[00:06] Oh my god, let's do this.

[00:25] The interwebs.

[00:27] Saving.

[00:31] All right, I moved it inside as you can see.

[00:34] It was not going to work outside.

[00:36] It was not going to work.

[00:37] There was just too much lag.

[00:50] Everybody doing.

[00:51] We're going to talk Pimbal.

[00:54] We're going to get this party started real soon.

[00:57] Oh, I'm going to make glasses on.

[01:00] There's too much glare in here.

[01:06] Spooky show, baby.

[01:08] I didn't win the Ultra Man.

[01:09] Was it my Ultra Man?

[01:11] Because mine.

[01:11] Yes, I lost my Ultra Man deposit years ago.

[01:17] Smartest move I made by the way.

[01:19] All right, I got a GNR behind me.

[01:21] Oh my god, what is going on with Facebook?

[01:27] We're going to talk all about what's going on in Pimbal this week.

[01:36] People, we're always off to a rough start on Canada's Pimbal podcast.

[01:42] Live take two.

[01:48] Who cares?

[01:50] Right.

[01:50] Does anyone really?

[01:54] We've always been sloppy on this show.

[01:57] Always been sloppy.

[01:58] Demon is out of storage.

[02:00] I'm having a good time with the demon.

[02:04] Incredible.

[02:06] I just need to be careful.

[02:09] It's a rocket ship.

[02:13] I don't even understand why people need more power than that.

[02:15] It's stupid.

[02:18] All right.

[02:19] Spooky didn't just give away a new inbox machine.

[02:27] Didn't Stern also give away a D&D?

[02:32] Both machines aren't good.

[02:34] Newsflash, Ultra Man and D&D.

[02:36] Two machines, nobody.

[02:37] You kind of have to give them away.

[02:39] You know the third machine you could add into the mix is a galactic tank force.

[02:44] I love like the first sale ads for the sick editions that are like

[02:48] save 75.

[02:50] Yeah.

[02:50] There's a reason why this thing is $7,500 off the sticker price.

[02:57] So disappointed on Predator.

[02:59] We're going to talk all about Predator.

[03:02] Pimbal Brothers.

[03:04] I don't know what's going on with this game.

[03:06] Like is Arnold is it?

[03:07] Is he in it?

[03:08] I don't think he's in it.

[03:09] He's not in it.

[03:14] Did Eric Minier?

[03:16] I think so.

[03:16] I don't get it.

[03:17] I don't get it.

[03:18] I've been very congratulatory of his game.

[03:20] All the work that needs to be done on the game is not design work.

[03:24] It's coding work.

[03:25] So like I get I think it's funny because I'm talking to Brett Abis.

[03:30] And he's all like excited to make the changes.

[03:32] And he's been listening to the feedback.

[03:34] So I think like

[03:36] I think that's what he's going to do.

[03:38] And I think that's what he's going to do.

[03:40] And I think that's what he's going to do.

[03:42] And I think that's what he's going to do.

[03:44] I think like I think Eric needs a little bit more humility

[03:52] and humbleness.

[03:53] And I think he needs to adapt that a little bit.

[03:56] I think sometimes he snaps back at people and it's like,

[04:00] bro, like you're not Keith L.

[04:02] And you don't have the you don't have the pedigree of games.

[04:05] And we're all just trying to help you out, man.

[04:07] You know what I'm saying?

[04:07] Like nobody nobody like is ever saying nasty stuff about Eric.

[04:12] Every time we've ever given Eric any feedback,

[04:15] it's really to help his games get better.

[04:18] So you know, it's cool.

[04:22] When you say you don't care what a personality says,

[04:24] sure you do.

[04:25] Sure you do.

[04:26] You wouldn't you wouldn't bring it up if you didn't care.

[04:28] It's like it's like Bill Brandis is always a yelling at me

[04:30] about a Harry Potter like how amazing it is.

[04:32] And he's like, I don't care what anybody thinks.

[04:34] I don't care what you say.

[04:35] I don't and like bro, if you didn't care,

[04:37] why would you be here right now barking at me for like an hour

[04:41] about the game?

[04:42] When you don't care about something,

[04:44] you don't even pay it any attention.

[04:47] It's like I don't I don't listen to some pinball podcasts

[04:54] that are out there because I don't I don't care.

[04:56] You don't hear me mention them.

[04:58] You know, if I had a dollar for every time someone said,

[05:01] hey, they're talking about you over there.

[05:03] I don't care.

[05:04] Cool.

[05:05] Six twippies.

[05:06] The problem with Jersey Jack is always this.

[05:12] They just don't have a chief creative officer.

[05:15] You know what I'm saying?

[05:16] Like they've got good ideas.

[05:17] They've got bad ideas and everything goes through.

[05:21] That's the problem is they don't have someone with real

[05:26] style and taste that's helping them.

[05:30] Like when I was watching the doon stream last night,

[05:33] well, we're going to talk about it.

[05:35] Carl was playing the game,

[05:36] but a much nicer usage of the assets in doon

[05:42] than currently in Harry Potter.

[05:45] Now Harry Potter can get there,

[05:47] but they should simplify it the way doon is.

[05:49] Doon deserves more attention.

[05:52] Maybe the best layout of the year.

[05:56] So, um, Lou, you think doons layout is better than

[06:00] Potter, better than Kong,

[06:06] better than, I don't know, the whole year we're talking

[06:11] evil dead.

[06:12] Uh, I don't know.

[06:15] I played doon for three hours.

[06:17] It's amazing.

[06:19] Hey, look, gang, I'm not here to tell you anyone's right or wrong.

[06:24] I think that um, doon is showcasing

[06:28] much better than predator who's good to showcase.

[06:32] I think doon is um, here's my thing with doon.

[06:36] I really love watching Carl play it.

[06:40] I love the two screens and how they connect with each other.

[06:44] I love the movie assets.

[06:45] I love the music.

[06:46] I love so much about the game.

[06:50] I think the hardest thing for me to warm up to in doon

[06:55] is still the theme.

[06:56] Like that's still the part that just like watching Timothy

[07:00] Shamale with his knife.

[07:03] Try to act like a badass.

[07:05] Like it just, it doesn't work for me.

[07:07] You know, like I'm just, I don't have any emotional

[07:10] connection to the doon movies.

[07:12] I saw them in iMacs.

[07:14] I enjoyed them kind of.

[07:16] I didn't think they were that great to be honest.

[07:18] I think I thought they were very overrated.

[07:20] I thought the hype around them was overrated.

[07:23] And I just, it didn't give me goosebumps the way

[07:27] Star Wars did, the way other Star Trek movies have even,

[07:32] the way.

[07:32] Remember that first Star Trek movie that came back with Chris Pine?

[07:36] You know, I just, I don't know.

[07:38] I just, there's something about the doon movies

[07:41] that I just don't connect with.

[07:43] And so, even though this game I think is executing

[07:46] on such a great level, the theme integration,

[07:49] it doesn't make you fall in love with the theme anymore

[07:53] if you don't love the theme.

[07:55] So that's my, that's my thing about doon is like,

[07:58] I was watching it.

[08:00] And I really liked what I saw.

[08:02] And I think if you love doon as a franchise,

[08:05] I think you're going to love this.

[08:07] I would even say if you, you know, if you enjoyed Pimball

[08:10] and just want something different,

[08:12] this is a nice game for a lineup.

[08:16] That being said, well, actually,

[08:18] I enjoyed the simplicity of how this game comes at you

[08:21] way more than the Harry Potter code right now.

[08:24] So I really do think if I'm the team at Jersey Jack

[08:28] and you've got all these assets, like maybe hop on a doon,

[08:31] hop on a jaws, hop on a Godzilla,

[08:34] just see like how other people are utilizing assets

[08:36] because I just, again, I think they need help.

[08:40] Predator is another case of rushing to market.

[08:43] They should have got their licensing finalized.

[08:49] So, there's a Southern fried gaming expo is going on right now.

[08:57] Correct. I think Eric is there.

[09:00] I know Brett is there.

[09:03] It's, um, it's that the thing is, is,

[09:09] I, let's suck predator.

[09:13] Okay, because predator is the, is the newest thing happening.

[09:17] It is, what's the day's date?

[09:19] It is like June 21st.

[09:23] All right, it's June 21st.

[09:25] I don't even think you're going to see any customers

[09:28] unbox a predator until September.

[09:34] You know, I, I don't.

[09:37] And I don't know why the game

[09:42] was revealed when it was.

[09:44] It's not on the line.

[09:46] And so I just think again, by the time that game actually starts shipping,

[09:52] so many of you are not going to want it.

[09:54] And I also just think they don't, I don't know.

[09:56] I just think the, the non-arnled leak with Arnold in it.

[10:01] And they're, I, I, I listened to all the interviews

[10:04] of the Pitmob Brothers.

[10:09] I don't know. I just don't see much of a game there.

[10:12] And even with, forget Arnold.

[10:15] I just don't see much of a game there.

[10:17] It's like I said in my podcast, you would,

[10:19] you would never accept this as predator from Jersey Jack.

[10:22] You would never accept this as predator from Stern Pimball.

[10:26] You, why, why, why would you accept this as predator from Pimball Brothers?

[10:31] All in with shipping and tariffs and jungle addition.

[10:36] This game is $15,500 without a topper.

[10:42] Can, can I repeat that?

[10:45] I don't know, the jungle addition have a topper?

[10:46] I don't know, maybe it does.

[10:47] But this thing is $15,500 for a Pimball Brothers game.

[10:56] Alien is $7,899 with Ripley.

[11:02] So tell me what, what drugs you need to take to come to the conclusion

[11:10] that this thing is fully loaded to your door is twice the prices of Alien.

[11:21] Daniel said it was not from them and an old code in the dirty,

[11:26] it was not from them.

[11:28] So who is it from?

[11:30] What do you mean, old code?

[11:32] How could they start coding the game with Arnold in it?

[11:38] And that went out to people.

[11:40] So someone's trying to sabotage their launch.

[11:47] Gang, look, look, if you haven't inked the deal with Arnold,

[11:52] which they didn't, you don't start making code of your game with him in it.

[12:00] You know what I'm saying?

[12:00] That is E Lee goal.

[12:03] Not only that, so you did it, which was illegal,

[12:07] you then sent that code out to somebody.

[12:10] Because that's not a cell phone camera.

[12:13] That's like footage you shot.

[12:16] So you actually think they did not send that to probably like someone in the,

[12:22] I think I heard like maybe Tommy got it in Nitro or a distro or something.

[12:26] How did it get out?

[12:29] How did that footage get out?

[12:32] They knew it was out there.

[12:36] And they still like this whole,

[12:40] you're going to see him from a distance, BS.

[12:42] What is that?

[12:43] What is it?

[12:44] Like someone's likeness is someone's likeness.

[12:46] There's no like you bought Arnold from 10 feet away, but not close up.

[12:51] That is hogwash people.

[12:53] That's not how licensing deals work.

[12:57] So I don't know what they're saying.

[13:00] There's no such thing as like a close up deal and then a far away deal.

[13:05] You know what I'm saying?

[13:07] Literally do deals with talent all the time.

[13:09] So whatever they're saying, they're, you know, what they mean is there might be quick cuts

[13:16] where you just see Arnold's arms or something and with a gun.

[13:20] But this whole far away, I should do a canada's bimbal podcast with no close ups,

[13:26] no close ups of the canada.

[13:27] You're going to get me far away.

[13:29] Just see me in the distance.

[13:30] Waving.

[13:31] Hey guys, doing jumping jacks like a jackass grumpy weirdo over here from a waiting can

[13:35] edit it grumpy weirdo checking in.

[13:40] I look at this game's this game is going to not do well.

[13:49] Gang gang.

[13:51] Himbal brother said the video I have is old.

[13:55] It doesn't matter if it's new or old gang.

[13:59] They legitimately put Arnold into a coded version of the game without permission.

[14:04] What were they trying to do like a big Lebowski then get Roger Sharp to go ink the deal?

[14:08] After the fact, I just I just think it's funny.

[14:14] I just think it's funny.

[14:15] And now and now how many people ordered that game seeing that Arnold get to the chopper?

[14:21] The whole conversation after that footage was out was hey Arnold's actually going to be in the game.

[14:26] Not only is he not in the game, there's no characters on the play field.

[14:31] The play field art has nobody from the film.

[14:34] If you walked up to this game, you would not even know it's the first movie.

[14:38] I'm sorry gang.

[14:40] I'm sorry.

[14:41] You would not accept this from any other manufacturer.

[14:44] And so it's just going to be another pinball brothers game.

[14:47] They will sell a few hundred.

[14:51] And that will be that it'll be a novelty game.

[14:54] You'll bang on it at shows and you'll be happy you didn't spend the money on one.

[15:00] And and that is it.

[15:01] It'll never go down as an adequate predator pinball machine without Arnold gang.

[15:09] This is like the dumbest.

[15:10] I can't even leave I'm like wasting time on this.

[15:12] You make predator one without Arnold in it.

[15:14] It is the stupidest thing you could ever do.

[15:17] The moment you find out you can't have Arnold in the game.

[15:20] You don't make it.

[15:20] It's like making big trouble in little China without Kurt Russell.

[15:24] Oh, you play as Kurt.

[15:26] You play as Jack, you know, Jack Burden.

[15:31] Like no, no, like you don't, you know,

[15:34] oh, we're making cry to kid without Ralph Macho.

[15:36] You know, you play as Daniel son.

[15:40] That's how that's how the game works.

[15:42] Stupid.

[15:43] It's a cop out.

[15:45] It doesn't work.

[15:47] At least in John Wick, you see John Wick.

[15:49] Imagine John Wick where you play as John Wick,

[15:50] but you're not going to see Ken O'Reaves.

[15:51] It's just stupid.

[15:52] Dead on arrival.

[15:55] Dead on arrival.

[15:56] Spooky look, I wish you guys would make predator.

[15:59] I saw that you guys wanted to make Star Wars.

[16:01] I hope you guys make Star Wars one day.

[16:02] You guys are going to be in a driver's seat real soon.

[16:07] I kind of feel like as all these,

[16:11] you know, I was telling a friend this the other day.

[16:13] I was like, you know, if I would do if I were bread Abbas,

[16:15] I would buy spooky pimpal right now.

[16:20] I would buy spooky pimpal.

[16:24] I would buy spooky pimpal and here's what I would do.

[16:27] I'm going to be talking about it.

[16:28] And this is what I would do.

[16:29] I would buy spooky pimpal,

[16:32] but let, but not change anything about how spooky does what it does other than.

[16:40] I want you guys to keep doing the boutique themes you're doing.

[16:44] We want to keep spooky its own entity.

[16:47] The only thing I want to give you guys is our platform.

[16:52] So I still want you to make a thousand beetle juices.

[16:54] I still want you to make a thousand gremlins, whatever it's going to be.

[16:58] But I want you to put it on the platform we have.

[17:00] So you're going to you're going to get to have our LCD, our hot rails,

[17:05] our everything.

[17:06] So you're going to take you up the next level.

[17:10] And that's how it's going to be.

[17:13] And but we don't want to interfere with anything else.

[17:16] And we're going to invest in getting you guys all that.

[17:21] I don't know.

[17:22] I don't think he would.

[17:23] I don't think I don't think he would.

[17:27] I find it fascinating that there's been no

[17:33] there's been no

[17:35] merger or acquisition that's happened at all in pimpal.

[17:40] I mean, think about like for the amount of

[17:43] ridiculousness it is to everyone have independent manufacturing of something that could be more like

[17:49] united and streamlined.

[17:51] The fact that everyone tries to go at it independently.

[17:55] And no one's really got any proprietary IP advantage anywhere other than stern.

[18:01] I mean, that's the thing that nobody talks about.

[18:04] Is stern has patterns on things

[18:08] that I hear could pretty much put almost everybody else like

[18:12] up SHITS is creek like stern could if they wanted to

[18:19] shut down more of the competition if they wanted to.

[18:24] But I get you know they're smart to not because in the end

[18:30] rising tides you know what they say.

[18:33] I don't know what the phrase is all ships whatever go up or some stupid thing like that.

[18:38] I don't know whatever you know the phrase all ships rise with the tide.

[18:41] I don't know.

[18:44] But nowadays I think we're going to see a faster

[18:53] closing of the doors if you will of companies that are just not

[18:58] Yeah, they're just not competitive.

[19:00] If pinball brothers can sell 800 predators game over.

[19:05] Multi more fig Jerry.

[19:06] I don't know like he's just going to keep making these things to the cows come home.

[19:10] I don't know.

[19:10] I don't I don't see people unboxing portals.

[19:13] He still never discloses how many units they've made in like 12 years.

[19:17] I think they've been in manufacturing now for six or seven years.

[19:21] I bet they haven't even made 500 right?

[19:23] So you see seven years you haven't made 500

[19:25] 500 units in seven years.

[19:29] I don't know to tell you I don't know where the money's coming from.

[19:32] I don't know like you know the p-rock money's dried up because everyone's using other systems.

[19:37] I don't know what what the deal is.

[19:39] I it's just it's mind-boggling to me that's stern pimple in one week in one week

[19:45] of one calendar years.

[19:47] Stern pimple makes more games than Jerry's made in a decade.

[19:56] I do not want to make money.

[19:59] This dream.

[20:10] Everybody let me see.

[20:12] Let's talk about what we're going to talk about Potter.

[20:16] Before we talk about Potter, I want to talk about King Kong.

[20:19] Stern's got a problem with this game.

[20:22] This Kong Mac is just terrible.

[20:26] I am it is not me saying this.

[20:28] I'm just reading the thread.

[20:33] You know it's not like it's not like I'm rooting for a certain company.

[20:37] But I don't know.

[20:38] Stern never sends me t-shirts.

[20:40] I can't even figure out how to cancel that stupid Stern annual charge for whatever

[20:46] insider connected I signed up for.

[20:48] The King Kong

[20:52] the King Kong

[20:54] Mac is really problematic.

[20:57] And nobody can really figure out how to properly calibrate this masturbating gorilla.

[21:05] And it's been a headache for all the owners.

[21:08] And it's really crazy to me.

[21:12] I think the mistake they made with Kong is I think they tried to do too much with him.

[21:24] They really take enough time to press your test and quality control the Mac.

[21:29] And before they realized it was too late.

[21:32] They were already making games.

[21:33] The Kongs got to move up and down.

[21:35] He taps the glass.

[21:36] He's got to trap a ball.

[21:38] He's got to knock the subway over.

[21:40] And it's just it's finicky.

[21:42] Right because again, like you look at it.

[21:43] It's like it's like a cheap

[21:46] kind of Mac in a way.

[21:47] Like it's not how it is.

[21:52] All right.

[21:53] Is that all right.

[21:55] How's that?

[21:58] I don't know why it won't reconnect.

[22:00] Still frozen?

[22:04] Where is it working now?

[22:08] All right.

[22:09] All right.

[22:10] I know how to do that.

[22:10] So if it freezes,

[22:13] I will turn off the Wi-Fi

[22:19] and start it.

[22:22] Something happened there.

[22:23] I got like bum rush about Stern tried to pull the plug.

[22:30] I also just shut down some of my other stuff running.

[22:35] You know, look,

[22:35] King Kong,

[22:37] there's some really fun code in the game.

[22:40] And I've never questioned

[22:42] Stern's ability to put fun code into a game.

[22:46] I think that Elwin layout is really interesting.

[22:50] I just think in the end,

[22:52] Kong is another great $8,000 premium and $10,000 LE.

[22:57] And Kong is a terrible $10,000 premium and $13,000 LE.

[23:02] That's the problem.

[23:03] I mean, basically, I mean,

[23:06] like Iceman says it every day on Pinside.

[23:08] Stern killed the Golden Goose.

[23:11] All their games are so overpriced.

[23:13] They don't even come close to giving you nearly as much as a Jersey Jack game.

[23:18] They're the quality's not there.

[23:19] Like, look at Harry Potter next to King Kong.

[23:22] Guys, it looks,

[23:24] it's like looking at a Ferrari next to a Corvette.

[23:28] I'm sorry.

[23:29] And I love Corvette.

[23:29] But like, there's a reason why Ferrari costs twice as much as a Corvette.

[23:33] Imagine if Corvette tried the charge for $1,000 for the New ZR1X, right?

[23:38] No.

[23:39] They know they know they're going to give you value.

[23:41] Like a Stern machine at $13,000 is so stupid.

[23:46] It's so stupid.

[23:47] Even a $10,000 premium is absolutely asinine.

[23:53] And everyone just feels that way.

[23:56] And you know, the content creators that are just like, it's fun.

[23:59] It's fun.

[24:00] Yeah, but even that's just like, what?

[24:02] But what's fun about losing $3,000 to $5,000 on every Stern Alina?

[24:07] Like, what is fun about that?

[24:10] They never want to answer that question.

[24:12] Because you're like, I get that the game is fun,

[24:14] but wouldn't it be much more fun to buy

[24:18] Bufighter's Alina for like eight?

[24:23] Right?

[24:24] Like, wouldn't it be more fun to buy Kong Alie for 10 in just a few months?

[24:32] I don't get it.

[24:40] I don't get it.

[24:42] All right, so I still think we're going to get jaws 50th.

[24:48] I think it's going to come out

[24:51] probably the week of July 4th.

[24:53] I think they're going to do some like,

[24:54] 4th of July weekend,

[24:56] bananza around it.

[24:59] I think it's going to be a weird thing.

[25:01] I think more jaws is like, who is buying more James Bond games?

[25:06] I saw like James Bond on the line.

[25:08] I'm like, what dope is buying a new inbox James Bond premium now?

[25:14] Like, who Stern knows that like,

[25:17] half the market are just newbies who have no idea

[25:21] canada exists or pin-side exists.

[25:24] Like, they know that that's half the market.

[25:26] And, you know, these guys are just like,

[25:30] all right, I didn't even realize this pinball.

[25:32] James Bond cool.

[25:33] I'll get one for 10,000.

[25:36] I've never liked James Bond.

[25:40] I don't like the way it shoots.

[25:42] I just don't like where the shots are on the game.

[25:46] I understand why people like it,

[25:48] but I just find the way that game shoots

[25:53] to be very unfulfilling.

[25:56] I think Stern has way better shooters in its arsenal.

[26:05] I don't think it's about getting better, gang.

[26:08] I think it's one of those games where you really have to

[26:11] learn the shots because they're just in really awkward places.

[26:17] I don't like the ramps in Bond.

[26:18] I hate the way the ramps are.

[26:21] And the upper left, you guys really enjoy shooting that missile

[26:25] or the Vux scuba Vux.

[26:28] On the whole left side of that game just feels so boring to shoot.

[26:36] Have you need the new music pin from Padredi?

[26:40] What?

[26:43] Well, I think Elwin is going to do Pokemon.

[26:50] And that's going to be Elwin's big one.

[26:56] Can I ask a serious question?

[26:58] Why can't Stern make their machines look as nice as

[27:02] Jersey Jack machines?

[27:05] Why is that so hard?

[27:06] Isn't it just wood and stickers and lights?

[27:13] I don't understand why a Jersey Jack machine

[27:19] looks twice as expensive as a Stern machine.

[27:22] What's going on?

[27:24] Why can't Stern make the game just look more expensive?

[27:30] I don't get it.

[27:31] I don't get it.

[27:35] I really, like, nothing that's going on in a Jersey Jack

[27:40] is like a different mineral they had a mine or some precious gem.

[27:46] It's literally just shinier decals,

[27:49] nicer screen, like the overall package just feels more solid.

[28:03] Yeah, I've noticed that on these Stern machines,

[28:05] they're just not glossy anymore.

[28:08] They're like, they're looking really dull.

[28:11] Like, it's like, I was looking at King Kong next to Potter.

[28:17] And Potter is just shiny.

[28:20] It's just illuminated.

[28:22] It's just coming at you like a beautiful thing.

[28:26] And then you look over at the Kong and it's dull.

[28:30] And it's like rough looking.

[28:32] And it just looks like it's been out for years and it's brand new.

[28:41] I love my Guns and Roses still gang.

[28:46] I got to be honest.

[28:49] I love Harry Potter, but I just think

[28:51] GnR is still going to go down as the best code.

[28:56] The best code it game that Jersey Jack's done

[29:00] when it comes to theme integration will still be Guns and Roses.

[29:05] I like that it's just easier to know what to do.

[29:08] It's just still a beautiful machine.

[29:11] I mean, I as a work of art, stunning.

[29:16] And there's only 500.

[29:17] I know CEs, even that's still not hard to get one.

[29:20] It's easy to get one.

[29:25] Man up the bug and give away your gen to stream.

[29:27] Come on.

[29:28] Why would I give up?

[29:38] So has anyone played the new Potter code?

[29:42] Because Brett was telling me they just dropped a new code update.

[29:46] And I'm not sure if anyone's played it.

[29:50] I don't know if they've fixed some of the issues.

[30:00] Potter's got a lot of work to do.

[30:03] You know, like Eric, Eric had to, I think Eric threw his shade on

[30:08] on Canada.

[30:09] It doesn't give an F what personalities say about him.

[30:14] Eric, I own your game.

[30:16] All right, I own one game.

[30:18] It's yours, Eric.

[30:21] I've given nothing but really great,

[30:24] constructive balance feedback on Potter.

[30:28] And I look forward to people getting it.

[30:30] You know, Potter is going to really hit at a bad time for Stern.

[30:35] They're going to sell a lot of potters.

[30:37] And it's good.

[30:38] And Jersey, Jack said he's got five more bangers ready to go.

[30:43] Five more banger titles.

[30:46] The non-banger titles that you might own as a Jersey Jack machine,

[30:53] gang, get rid of them now.

[30:55] I mean this when I say,

[30:58] Godfather's CE will be a $7,000 pain.

[31:01] That'll mean $8,000 loss on that game.

[31:03] The LE's will be $5,000.

[31:06] Dialed in same thing.

[31:10] I mean, you're just going to see

[31:12] avatars are going to be like brutal too.

[31:16] Nobody wants this stuff, gang.

[31:17] Like nobody.

[31:19] Like, you know, if they've got beastie boys or top gun or Sonic or Matrix or,

[31:25] you know, they got some stuff coming.

[31:28] That's banger.

[31:29] I just hope they're bangers though, because you never know who to believe, right?

[31:32] Because Jack thinks that Godfather's a banger and avatars of bangers.

[31:35] So like, who made, you know, it's the same people making the decisions

[31:41] and they've made some terrible decisions.

[31:43] So I don't know.

[31:47] Yet Jersey Jack, man, they haven't had any real bangers since Guns and Roses.

[31:52] You know, Guns and Roses and then Potter.

[31:55] I mean, the two biggest themes they've ever had.

[31:58] Are Guns and Roses and Potter?

[32:02] Because Toy Story 4 is, no.

[32:05] That's like if they only made a Chinese democracy album pin for GNR.

[32:10] That's Toy Story 4.

[32:13] So Guns and Roses and Potter and they will be the best selling Jersey Jack games of all time.

[32:20] And then third is easily Wizard of Oz.

[32:23] Hobbit, Jack got screwed on Hobbit because the movies kind of sucked.

[32:29] Like, you know, he inked that deal.

[32:31] He thought he had the next Lord of the Rings and the movies came out.

[32:35] There's this great story about filming of Lord of the Rings Hobbit movies.

[32:41] Wasn't like Guillermo del Toro was supposed to direct them.

[32:46] And his production company worked on the movies.

[32:50] And the dude like quit the project like at the 11th hour.

[32:54] Like right before filming started and then Peter Jackson had to come in

[32:59] and direct these movies that he did not work on the pre-production of.

[33:04] And there's this great story how they're like filming a battle.

[33:07] And they don't even know like who's supposed to win the battle.

[33:11] What's going on?

[33:12] They're like, but they couldn't.

[33:14] They just had to keep shooting because they were so far over schedule and budget that they're just like,

[33:18] I don't know, just film it and we'll figure out who wins his battle in post-production or editing.

[33:23] It just like literally it destroyed all of their enthusiasm for Lord of the Rings

[33:29] who was making the Hobbit movies.

[33:33] It's also so stupid the Hobbit book is tiny.

[33:36] So they take this tiny book and try to stretch it into another trilogy that it was never.

[33:41] The whole movie feels like it ends when they after the first movie.

[33:46] What's the latest on back to the future?

[33:49] Uh, well they were just they were just going to announce the title, not show the game.

[33:58] I don't know man.

[33:59] I think Barry and company are not equipped to manufacture a theme this popular.

[34:08] They're equipped to design a game.

[34:11] The big Lebowski's awesome still.

[34:14] I just I don't know how they make it.

[34:16] I don't know how they make it.

[34:19] I mean, it's like place your order and wait five years to get it.

[34:22] Like that's what it's going to be like.

[34:23] So I

[34:29] I don't know who amongst you is going to want to wait that long to get your back to the future machine.

[34:39] Evil dead and doomed for Game of the Year.

[34:41] No, it's a Louis, Louis, right?

[34:44] Louis.

[34:45] Game of the Year is voted on.

[34:48] By the pinball public, right?

[34:52] Same thing, Twippies.

[34:54] And you can get a hundred more first place votes and lose the weighted system.

[34:59] I love it.

[34:59] Kill and I still joke around about that.

[35:01] He's like, I don't even think he's like, I don't know bro.

[35:03] I don't know.

[35:05] You got him was a hundred more first place votes and you lost.

[35:08] He's like, I don't know.

[35:10] I don't know.

[35:10] You know, Colin, Colin is now like

[35:14] gone back to just not caring about building relationships with the other content creators.

[35:20] And he's just off doing his like controversial clickbait stuff now.

[35:26] Seriously, like think about it.

[35:27] He's the only pinball content creator that had to go down that road of like,

[35:32] should we be talking about trans rights and pinball because of Harry Potter?

[35:36] Like you went there, bro.

[35:38] You went there.

[35:40] Yeah, he went there.

[35:41] Yeah.

[35:42] So I called him out on it and then, you know, then he's that's it.

[35:47] Anyway, my point being is

[35:51] evil dead and dune will never win game of the year because way more people will own

[35:59] kinkong and

[36:01] Potter and it's just it's just number of votes.

[36:12] See, Pat, I don't think it's the best time ever for pinball lovers.

[36:16] I think it's one of the worst.

[36:19] I think it's one of the worst.

[36:21] I'll tell you what the best time for pinball lovers was.

[36:24] 2008.

[36:29] 2008 was the best time.

[36:34] I think the best time for pinball lovers

[36:36] is when you could still get a great deal on a masterpiece.

[36:43] The best time for pinball lovers was when you had a masterpiece and you went to sell it

[36:50] and you didn't ask for double the price on your Lord of the Rings.

[36:54] LE, right?

[36:55] It's like you got it for six.

[36:57] You sold it for 65, 7 at most.

[37:00] You didn't list it for 16, 9 or best offer.

[37:04] Pimball now is forever tainted by a post-COVID reality.

[37:11] The hobby now is stupidly overpriced.

[37:14] We're getting primarily mediocre themes across the board.

[37:19] Theme integration is for the most part piss poor.

[37:24] And so like for this, how is this the best time ever for pinball lovers?

[37:31] Where three games can cost you 45,000 dollars.

[37:37] Three games.

[37:38] That's the best time for pinball lovers.

[37:41] You used to be able to get three L.E.s for 18 grand.

[37:45] And before the LCD screen, guess where the magic was, under the glass.

[37:51] Under the glass.

[37:53] Now they can't even put a dim masturbating gorilla in a game without it breaking down

[37:59] every week.

[38:06] It's the most exciting time.

[38:08] I'll restate this, Pat.

[38:10] I think it's the most exciting time to observe the pinball hobby.

[38:15] As a pinball content creator, I love this time.

[38:18] I love it.

[38:18] I mean, I am not buying any of this overpriced stuff.

[38:21] I think it's all overpriced.

[38:22] I think all of it is overpriced.

[38:25] And the data proves me right.

[38:27] And I can drive 25 minutes to automate it and spend hours on all these games.

[38:33] I can go to the pinball like locations.

[38:35] I can go to friends homes who have games.

[38:38] I, again, I don't know what grown adult has unlimited amount of time to play pinball.

[38:43] I don't do you.

[38:46] The concept of having 5, 10, 15 machines.

[38:52] When the amount of time in a week, you have to actually play.

[38:57] Is limited for most adults.

[39:00] And you're going to keep buying more.

[39:03] To me, it underscores more of a problem in a disease than it does a beneficial behavior.

[39:12] That like you're just not satisfied with what you have.

[39:15] So you have to keep buying more of the same type of game.

[39:19] Remember, like, game, this is no pinball.

[39:22] My friend Greg Colton, rare here, always says,

[39:25] all pinball is old.

[39:26] It's an old analog game.

[39:29] Like no great pinball machine gets old or boring to play.

[39:36] More of the new stuff, in my honest opinion, is the stuff that gets boring faster.

[39:42] And now it's not just that they get boring because the themes are mediocre.

[39:46] It's like then you're also losing a fortune if you went in on it.

[39:49] New inbox.

[39:50] So I love observing the hobby now more than ever.

[39:57] Because now you've got this great amalgamation of high prices, high expectations,

[40:04] and then high volume of launches now.

[40:07] We used to sit around and wait for like three companies to do something.

[40:10] Now we've got 15 companies.

[40:13] Let's count how many companies right now are making new inbox pinball machines that you can buy.

[40:19] All right, I'm going to all of them.

[40:22] Home pin and help me out if I miss one.

[40:24] Home pin.

[40:28] Pajready gaming.

[40:30] Pinball brothers.

[40:33] Dutch pinball.

[40:36] Dutch pinball X.

[40:37] Let's just separate them.

[40:40] Okay, five.

[40:46] I'm trying to do all of Europe first.

[40:49] Am I missing anybody in Europe?

[40:55] I don't think so.

[40:56] All right, so there's five.

[40:57] Stern pinball.

[41:00] Jersey Jack.

[41:03] Jersey Jack.

[41:05] Spooky.

[41:06] CGC.

[41:08] Turner.

[41:09] That's 10.

[41:10] Let's keep going.

[41:10] There's more.

[41:12] There's more.

[41:12] Multi-morphic.

[41:15] Right?

[41:16] Multi-morphic.

[41:19] Um.

[41:22] Barrel's a fun.

[41:24] Hex pinball.

[41:27] Americans dead.

[41:28] They just died.

[41:29] But American, they're still selling games.

[41:33] Gang, where we're at?

[41:34] We're at 14 right now.

[41:36] Is that road trip guy?

[41:37] Right?

[41:38] That road trip dude.

[41:39] He's going to sell his bringing his game to market.

[41:42] 15.

[41:45] 15 companies.

[41:47] How's Ramos?

[41:52] Ramps?

[41:52] Is that the name of the cup?

[41:54] Is it rams or Ramos?

[42:01] Pinball adventures.

[42:02] 16 puny factory.

[42:09] Stupid.

[42:12] Stupid.

[42:13] So you see how like

[42:15] you guys want me to turn on G&R?

[42:17] Hold on.

[42:45] I'm going to take the opportunity.

[43:03] I'm going to be nice to you all.

[43:15] Look how beautiful it is.

[43:22] Beautiful, right?

[43:26] I mean,

[43:29] I mean, look at that.

[43:32] Theme integration.

[43:35] The lights are going.

[43:38] It's perfect.

[43:39] It's all like that.

[43:44] Michael Scott pinball.

[43:47] But my point being this game,

[43:50] it's a terrible time to discover this hobby for people.

[43:56] And that's why when you see the newbies,

[44:00] they really don't want to hear it.

[44:02] Like I get it.

[44:03] Like you've got some money.

[44:05] You discover this hobby.

[44:07] You know, instead of buying a $100,000 car,

[44:10] you can go buy four pinball machines.

[44:11] You know, you flip a few houses somewhere in the middle

[44:14] and nowhere in America and you got yourself a few hundred grand.

[44:18] And then all of a sudden, you can become a content creator.

[44:21] And you know, and you look like a baller

[44:24] because you bought a bunch of pinball machines over the last five years.

[44:27] You know,

[44:28] Canada did with those six, seven figures.

[44:30] He put it in the markets.

[44:32] My money's making money.

[44:34] Why would I keep throwing it into a depreciating asset?

[44:37] I don't have that much time to play pinball machines.

[44:40] And we do it's funny.

[44:41] I own one pinball machine.

[44:43] I've monetized my pinball content to make more than

[44:48] all of them combined and get all the arrows in the bag

[44:53] and still most subscribers

[44:55] because we talk about killing this guy.

[44:58] Because we talk about the hobby

[45:01] in a way that's not

[45:04] concerned if you will about what the manufacturers say about me.

[45:10] You know, I'm like, I saw what Eric said.

[45:11] Like, I don't care.

[45:13] Eric said, Eric said, dude, like he can, he should say that.

[45:18] Do you actually like pinball?

[45:20] No, Ian, I hate pinball, man.

[45:23] I hate it.

[45:24] I've just spent the last 12 years of my life

[45:28] making content about something I hate.

[45:30] Ian, you found me out, man.

[45:33] You fed me.

[45:35] Nudge, baby, nudge.

[45:38] Ian, I'm sorry to hear about the job, man.

[45:39] We'll get you something in marketing.

[45:42] I'll be in the boat soon enough, man.

[45:44] AI is going to put everybody out of business

[45:46] in the marketing world.

[45:47] It's coming soon.

[45:48] It's coming so much sooner than people realize.

[45:54] Now, gang, it's like, I think what everybody forgets is like,

[45:58] when it comes to the gradient scale of once you play enough pinball,

[46:06] it's like riding a bike, you kind of just, you get it.

[46:10] Like, you're good enough to hop on any machine

[46:13] and experience what that machine has to offer.

[46:16] 99% of people on planet Earth get on a pinball machine

[46:20] and they just like, they don't even understand.

[46:22] There's like software.

[46:23] They don't understand.

[46:23] There's like objectives.

[46:25] They're really just trying to keep the ball from draining.

[46:27] That's 99% of planet Earth.

[46:33] You like pinball as an asset.

[46:35] Others love pinball and don't care if they lose money.

[46:40] So who wants to lose money when they don't have to?

[46:43] That's the part I don't get.

[46:45] What smart person?

[46:46] Here's the thing again, because I've covered this hobby for 12 years, gang.

[46:51] The part that I literally, it makes me,

[46:56] it makes me cringe a little bit because the people covering the hobby now that weren't around

[47:01] when we all got started so much longer ago,

[47:05] they don't understand like, you can have bull.

[47:10] You can still have all the fun and not lose the money.

[47:16] I know you say they don't care about losing the money,

[47:18] but what person do you know wants to lose like $15,000 on three stern alley purchases?

[47:25] Do you know anyone who's like actually like, I don't care?

[47:30] There are some of those people, but the majority of people are not those people.

[47:35] And those are the super wealthy.

[47:38] They're not what keeps pinball alive.

[47:49] The real problem gang is, again, again, it's personal for everybody.

[47:54] I wouldn't own $100,000 in pinball machines unless I had a million dollars in other assets.

[48:01] That's just me.

[48:02] I wouldn't own $100,000 in pinball machines unless I had a million or more in other assets.

[48:13] Now, I would probably argue, most people that have $100,000 in pinball machines have a million

[48:19] dollars plus in other assets.

[48:20] But the thing that sucks gang is you know, you know you're paying for something you're not

[48:31] getting now. That's what sucks now.

[48:34] Gang, Godzilla was 10.5.

[48:38] What justifies a $13,000 stern alley now?

[48:47] Isn't your home a million dollar asset?

[48:50] Yeah, you can't know. It's more than a million dollar asset this home.

[48:52] You can't get a home in this town unless it's like completely dilapidated.

[48:57] Like, I'm in an affordable home in this town.

[49:01] There's homes in this town.

[49:04] 20 million, 8 million, 5 million all over the place, all over the place.

[49:10] But nobody in this town has $100,000 in pinball machines.

[49:13] Nobody. They just, people don't roll like that.

[49:16] Most people don't roll like that.

[49:20] What release would you put money down on so far this year?

[49:25] Like, any of the games that this are okay?

[49:27] So that's a good question.

[49:28] What, what release would I put money down on this year?

[49:32] None. None. I wouldn't order any of these games right now because I'll tell you why.

[49:38] All of these games right now are incomplete.

[49:41] They're all incomplete. Why would you buy a game now?

[49:45] Every single game right now,

[49:47] Dune, Predator, Kong, Potter, they're all incomplete.

[49:54] They're all six months away from being closer to being complete.

[50:01] So why would I buy any of them?

[50:04] And by the time they complete them,

[50:08] I'd have the option to buy it at the end of the year for so much cheaper.

[50:12] Or I'll be able to see Beetlejuice,

[50:15] Star Wars, Tron, or Remastered.

[50:19] Right? I'll be able to see Pokemon maybe,

[50:23] right? Because Pokemon's also going to be January.

[50:25] So like, why would I buy any of this stuff right now?

[50:28] Tell me, there's zero FOMO on any of these games right now.

[50:35] To buy a game right now, new unboxed.

[50:37] Who's that? I love people.

[50:38] Why do you want to play something incomplete?

[50:40] I'm so tired of playing a game before it has everything in it that the company wants in it.

[50:51] You just said if you had a million in assets, you do.

[50:55] You you meant 10 million assets.

[50:57] No, wait, wait, gang, the reason I don't have

[51:01] a hundred thousand dollars in Pimple machines is I don't have room.

[51:06] And if I did have room, I wouldn't buy a hundred thousand dollars in Pimple machines.

[51:13] I just would not.

[51:15] I don't think anybody, and I mean this.

[51:19] I don't think anybody needs more than like three great machines that all complement each other.

[51:27] I've always felt this way, whether it's Pimple or Watches or Cars or Bottles of Effent,

[51:34] look, and I get it. The more money you have, the more space you might have, the more disposable

[51:40] income you might have. And it means nothing to some of these gentlemen, nothing.

[51:46] But this is just me personally.

[51:49] There's only so much time in a day.

[51:52] So like I get that you could have 15 cars or 10 cars.

[51:58] You can really only take out one at a time.

[52:02] You know, so you might have one car that's a muscle car.

[52:06] One car that's like in it, you know, like a lightweight roadster.

[52:12] And one car that's like a sedan or in a state that you're not going to have any more fun

[52:20] than that in the automotive space. A little lightweight six-speed manual car,

[52:25] a muscle car, and then a sports car.

[52:30] Or like a sedan.

[52:32] What else are you going to have?

[52:36] Look, I will say this though too. And you guys know this.

[52:40] Everybody knows this. Playing on location is not the same as playing at home.

[52:46] It's not. It's like trying to have sex with your wife in a public bathroom.

[52:49] It is. It still can work. It still can work. And you can still get somewhat of the satisfaction.

[52:58] But it's much more enjoyable to have sex at home in your bed.

[53:02] The same way it's a lot more enjoyable to play pinball at home when you want to play it

[53:09] without distractions, without anything else going on around you.

[53:13] It's just the way it is. It's it's it's you can focus on it.

[53:17] How do you feel about pinball machines sitting next to a window?

[53:21] I think it's great, Mike. It's not block in the window. It's caddy-cornered.

[53:26] But yes, thank you for that. We haven't heard that joke before.

[53:30] I mean, there's literally dudes with like a row of games in front of windows.

[53:34] That's fine.

[53:40] Orbeez Arcade is fine, but location play is way more rad.

[53:46] I'm on fire gang. I want to answer all your questions. Fire anything at me.

[53:49] Ask me anything. I don't care whether it's pinball related or not. Ask me anything.

[53:53] I like getting underneath at all. Like let's just let's just hit directly at life right now.

[54:03] Not liking location plays the most spectrum thing about you that doesn't even

[54:09] like let me in. I like playing at automated. I'll tell you why I stopped playing like league

[54:16] nights because it was just a stupid waste of time after like I literally people would spend three

[54:21] hours to win a translate. I'm also at a different stage in life gang. Like again, I've got a

[54:27] one in a four-year-old. Why would I if I get any time off? Why would I choose to go stand in front

[54:36] of a pinball machine with my head down instead of being out there in the world like having conversation,

[54:41] like building relationships, like raising a glass of margarita, like sitting on a boat with

[54:47] lobster rolls. Like why would I again? It's the stage I'm at. Many of you, your kids are older,

[54:53] you had kids earlier, I get it. But you got to put yourself in my flip flops. I'm like not

[55:01] that's not to me. Like to me, what I always hated to see in, into the story, to me the saddest

[55:07] thing I ever see is when people travel to another culture, another city, and instead of like going

[55:12] to experience what's in Paris or New York or San Francisco, they go try to find an arcade and

[55:18] sit there and play the same damn pinball machines they can play anywhere. You're gonna take

[55:24] the tiny amount of time you have in life and get to a new place in the world and just

[55:30] stare down at the same damn pinball machine that's available where you come from. You're gonna

[55:38] seek out the pinball in Paris, in Tokyo, in Germany, you know, in Brazil, like what is what?

[55:52] You need more friends to enjoy location play. I got friends. None of them want to play pinball.

[55:59] None of them. I don't have a single friend that's like, hey man, let's go play some pinball.

[56:03] I retired young and have plenty of investments. I would never personally buy an L.E. Yeah Pat,

[56:12] because you're smart. You're smart. Are you having fun Ian? Are you having fun? Are you gonna have

[56:22] you? You're having some fun? This is fun. This is fun. You don't be more fun when you're playing on

[56:27] location. Canada just rocks up with like a sledgehammer and just takes out the entire back box. Now tell

[56:32] me that wouldn't be fun. Now show me how to get to wizard mode mofos. What am I on today? I don't

[56:39] know. I got the vodka in the freezer. I'm not even on it yet. What else we got here? But what you

[56:46] like value the dollar is nothing to do with it. You know, it's something rich people say. I love it.

[56:52] You know, you must be rich. I love you know, rich people always got the advice about money. Rich

[56:56] people are like, ah, it's time. You know, you can't tell it like you're rich because you rich.

[57:02] Only rich people say stupid like captain obvious stuff about money. That's it. You know,

[57:10] you're like, you're like, come on man. Come on man. Only rich people are in the pinball for the

[57:16] most part. If you think you'll collect buy pinball machines. I don't mean in the pinball. Only rich

[57:21] people really buy pinball machines. How can you not how can you buy these expensive things if

[57:26] you're not somewhat rich? How? Most people in this country are struggling to pay a bill.

[57:34] They're not following Harry Potter's CEO launch.

[57:37] Canada is the Debbie down what's Debbie down or about this game?

[57:48] Gang BW it's the best way to have pinball fun is buy a use game with broken plastics. Lord of the

[57:59] Rings baby for like six grand and just bang on it. Bang on it. Don't don't look at the shooter

[58:06] lane where just bang on that game and have fun. The guy having the most fun in pinball has a

[58:13] house full of stern pros and doesn't care. He does in care. He's not on pinside. He's not like

[58:22] right now. He's just waking up having breakfast beer rolling off the couch and throwing some

[58:30] games on freaking iron man man. You want to have fun in pinball? You want to have fun in pinball?

[58:36] Go play iron man. You know what game you don't hear people talk about a lot iron man and I'll

[58:41] tell you right now iron man is faster than Harry Potter. It's faster than Elton John. It's damn

[58:49] fun and you could go pick up an iron man for like hardly anything and you'd have more kinetic

[58:56] pinball fun on iron man than you ever will on a $15,000 Harry Potter. You know how to say that

[59:03] canada you can't make sense like that. You're the Debbie downer. You're not supporting every new launch.

[59:11] You're not supporting everything. You got iron man is boring. No, it's not. Iron man is not boring.

[59:23] Who coded iron man? Who coded it? Does anyone know?

[59:41] Look.

[59:50] Look. Look. Yeah. Thank you, Anthony. I was waiting for someone to realize that Lyman Sheets

[01:00:01] coded iron man. I would you know I'm just going to say this. You want to build the right pinball

[01:00:11] collection. You just buy every game Lyman Sheets made. Any game that man touched.

[01:00:21] I'm just so much better than everybody else when it comes to how to like make a game.

[01:00:30] Fallen. He could take anything and make it work. He could take the worst layout. Keep you coming

[01:00:38] back for more. Right? Batman 66 not the best layout. But man Batman 66 is better

[01:00:51] mechs in it than anything and Potter anything and predator anything and King Kong.

[01:00:59] Debbie downer grumpy weirdo here. You guys are hanging out. It's good. It's good. No, it's good to get it

[01:01:04] out. It's good to talk like this. Nobody else even talks like this. Like these guys weren't

[01:01:10] around when Iron Man came out. You know, I'm going to share a story. I did this. You guys say,

[01:01:16] never let me let me share something with you right now. Let me let me find this.

[01:01:20] They're no longer in business. But like this was one of the most, this was one of the first

[01:01:24] things I did at my when I went to Weber.

[01:01:26] Hold on.

[01:01:34] Hold on.

[01:01:42] Hold on.

[01:01:50] This was my story.

[01:01:52] Share screen.

[01:02:00] Hold on.

[01:02:10] So there was a weird rule in certain cities. Remember when they banned Pimball in the 60s and sharp

[01:02:20] guy that lifted but not everywhere. So in certain cities, there was still a ban on Pimball.

[01:02:30] And so radio shack at the time was my client. You know, and they sell tech devices.

[01:02:38] And so when the 80 year old ban on Pimball was getting lifted, it was then legal to play Pimball in Oakland.

[01:02:46] We put in Iron Man Pimball machine in radio shack and whoever came in and set the high score won the machine.

[01:02:56] That was it. Super simple. So much fun. It looks so cool in store.

[01:03:04] Look at even like the Iron Man. I mean, you look, this is a drag and drop stern days. But like, there's a Canadian special when a Canadian, you know, imagine what I would do if I was at the the CMO one of these Pimball companies.

[01:03:14] I you could be seeing Pimball out in the world in way better ways than just mailing mailing some PC dude a dnd for free.

[01:03:26] Like there's no creativity there whatsoever. That's not the kind of story that's going to travel.

[01:03:32] You're going to get a hundred thousand people to see that who don't give a shit. Like that's called reach and no impact.

[01:03:44] Well, that's the thing is like, again, I think because a lot of these newbies in the Pimball content space weren't around then.

[01:03:54] They want to feel the excitement we did when those games came out and they have they know and they're they're they're excitement is valid like they they only know what they know.

[01:04:05] They don't know what they don't know. So, you know, they all got excited doing co it is great $15,000 for again is great 13,000.

[01:04:13] They don't have the context to understand that they're getting ripped off because to them they're not getting ripped off because to them it's all they know.

[01:04:26] You know, like I put my foot down this week and then I got to go soon gang and I don't look there's just principles of like what things should cost.

[01:04:39] And we've got this beautiful ice cream shop in Roatin Brandon's 101. I moved in a year ago.

[01:04:51] A year ago one scoop of ice cream was 450 expensive right two scoops was like 550. So it's like no brainer. I'm going to get the two scoops.

[01:05:01] A lot more than you want to spend and some of these teenage girls they have scoop and don't understand like what a scoop should be like it should be a good scoop.

[01:05:11] Okay, but I love the place love going there bring Killing and you know we have good time like.

[01:05:18] I went in I went in the other day like two days ago.

[01:05:23] And I just just two scoops can I get two scoops. They're like that'll be seven dollars.

[01:05:30] What?

[01:05:32] Like there wasn't even like an increment just it now all of it two scoops are seven one scoop is 550 two is seven and three is eight for three scoops of ice cream.

[01:05:45] I haven't raised can a just pinball podcast prices in five years since I started taking money I haven't raised it a penny.

[01:05:55] And that's and I was like I'm not going back now.

[01:05:58] Like you know I'm saying I have the money.

[01:06:01] I'd rather spend $18 on a margarita than eight dollars on three scoops of ice cream.

[01:06:06] So I just I'm not doing it.

[01:06:09] And that's the problem with some of the modern world nowadays is like you're just you gotta be every look everyone's got what they're threshold is to pay for certain things might just happens to be two scoops of ice cream shouldn't be anything more than like six bucks.

[01:06:30] You know, you know, you know, here's the thing, you know, you're you're you're not wrong, but they're not buying as much as they used to and you know you're in Europe right.

[01:06:44] And you're you're in Europe and you don't see like the impact come on people are not buying as much as they used to in Europe I speak to your pain distributors all the time brother.

[01:06:59] It's just come on I mean I know what you're I know like you it's it's not great.

[01:07:10] But you know that's the thing man it's like it's cool it's like again.

[01:07:14] It's just but you know it doesn't matter if you're richer poor like ice cream shouldn't be seven dollars it doesn't matter if you're richer poor a stern alleys should never be 13 and this is the thing you know is like if to you it doesn't matter it still doesn't change the principle of how much this particular thing should cost.

[01:07:40] Back in my day paid two dollars for a canada.

[01:07:45] I look again.

[01:07:47] A lot of people don't care.

[01:07:53] But I think there's a reckoning coming.

[01:07:56] I think there's a reckoning coming.

[01:07:59] I think in the world I think for a lot of people personally and I think there's um.

[01:08:04] There's a there's there's going to be a real reality check happening.

[01:08:10] And you just got to prep for that rainy day man because it's just been too good for too long and too few people have made all the money and it's not trickling down like it used to.

[01:08:21] It's not it's not trickling down like it used to.

[01:08:25] Back in the day like you worked in corporate America like it's money trickled down like the CEO made a lot but everybody else like who'd with the company it's not that case anymore.

[01:08:35] It's not that case anymore.

[01:08:47] You don't have to.

[01:08:52] We get it bro we get it we're happy you're successful we're happy you came out of like you know look you got to we got to take risks in life you're never going to.

[01:09:01] You're never going to be successful without taking a risk.

[01:09:05] And everything's hard work right what you know I'm saying everything's hard work.

[01:09:09] It's hard to wake up and be unsuccessful just as much as it's it takes a lot of hard work to become successful.

[01:09:16] Everything is easy nothing is easy I always tell this to people like if you want a job or you're just coasting that it's not going to be easy because you're going to go home and feel unproductive and that's hard to wake up every day feeling unproductive.

[01:09:29] If you inherit money and didn't work for any of it you're going to feel like lazy and insignificant and that's hard feeling like inadequate like it just.

[01:09:45] No trickle down works Gino it works.

[01:09:55] You know you need a podcast brother the Gino the Gino busy the Gino busy pinball podcast about money and life.

[01:10:10] I mean like I think in today's market potter at 10k is a real enticing game right it's like it's the lot it's cheaper than predator it's cheaper than dune it's cheaper than multi more thick it's cheaper than you know a lot of stones it's the same price as a storm premium way more game in it.

[01:10:38] Yes it's yes crazy if they just put the rad cows on that.

[01:10:46] They would they would just sell so many of them.

[01:10:53] Well GnR is one of the nicest opinions the Gino yellow show.

[01:11:09] So I think potter at 10k is a genius time for Jersey Jack to release that game at that price.

[01:11:25] I'm happy to do a show with Gino anytime.

[01:11:29] GnR don't argue amongst yourselves like it's thank you for taking some Saturday time out to hang out with canada this has been a fun show.

[01:11:39] It's been a fun show I like I hope you guys understand too that I'm I'm very I'm very much like all of you.

[01:11:48] I'm a human with faults with who has fears and optimism colliding every week.

[01:11:55] I have two young boys a beautiful wife a house I love in a town I love and I you know I struggle with what the next 10 years might look like.

[01:12:07] The thing I'm confident in is in my own abilities and I do feel confident in my abilities that I will make it work because in the end.

[01:12:20] I'm sure you are your greatest asset and you should invest in yourself and making sure you realize that like I think what is difficult about the modern world for a lot of people myself included is so much of our value is is is affirmed by others.

[01:12:41] If they see the value in you they'll give you that salary and if they feel like they're getting there you know what they need from you then you have a job and and what's lost a lot in the modern world is stuff like loyalty and trust and human relationships and.

[01:13:01] I that's the part that keeps me up at night is it doesn't matter because in the end like these big companies are just consolidating all the time and everyone's just a name on an excel sheet.

[01:13:14] So it doesn't matter if that woman over there just gave birth to a beautiful baby they will cut you lose the next day.

[01:13:23] And that's that's that's sad like I think we've we've we've put corporate profits and greed you think about it like how can one man have 300 billion dollars and lay off 60,000 people my wife was one of them.

[01:13:41] Mark Zuckerberg not only did he fire my wife he then because of a mistake he made around the metaverse and then he fires my wife and 60,000 other people who needed an income.

[01:13:54] And then the companies stock sky rockets and becomes the highest it's ever been.

[01:14:01] Well so like and so what you go from having 250 billion to 350 billion while you disrupted the lives of 60,000 people who believed in you I mean that sucks.

[01:14:16] Why why why imagine if he had just 200 billion and everybody could still be a part of the organization and feel like they're on the team.

[01:14:28] No, I know but I'm just saying this is the problem with modern capitalism these days is the few at the top of taking everything and then some.

[01:14:38] And the rest of us are just like waiting for the scraps and that the thing is about the modern world is you know now it's like a billionaires world right it is a billionaires world not a millionaires world.

[01:14:51] And so it's like you think you're like you finally get to where you think is the top of some mountain and you realize like that's just the new mole hill and it's 2025.

[01:15:03] And you still got to keep working and retirement is like never happening for most they said said so most people can't.

[01:15:12] Feel good and the American you know middle class American dream has been like just destroyed and some dude can just buy like doge coin like four years ago and now have millions and added nothing to society just all stood by and watch that happen right.

[01:15:30] Oh my god.

[01:15:35] One million is not poverty you guys are like at a control like you guys understand like the the median income in the world is is like $7500 annually.

[01:15:52] Anyway, but you know i'm happy i get to hang with all you mostly successful dudes and do that's.

[01:16:01] Everybody look have a good Saturday frank give me a call brother let's go do some let's get into some trouble.

[01:16:08] Everybody if you're not a member of can you just been all podcasts you know you should be again I didn't raise prices if you join the show though join on the internet not on your iPhone because apple will charge you more.

[01:16:24] i'm going to give you a little and I can't control it because that's what apple does is they they think they deserve everything that happens on their phones.

[01:16:37] Frank come on like let's go golf today I would have at we should have hit the links today can we go later today.

[01:16:45] Can we do a late t time i'll go shirtless i need to get ripped.

[01:16:53] Alright everybody have a great day and we'll chat soon don't buy any of these new games i mean don't buy me yet wait trust me in six months you listen to canada you will get any game you want right now from much less money and the games will be finally coded like that is it so much to just wait for a game to be complete.

[01:17:16] I don't that's it that simple piece out.
