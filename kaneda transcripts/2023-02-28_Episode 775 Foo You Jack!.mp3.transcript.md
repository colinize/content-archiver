[00:00] Wow, wow.

[00:19] I'm absolutely shocked how wrong I was about Foo Fighters, about this game's ability to

[00:27] excite people, this game's ability to win people over in the pinball world.

[00:32] I thought Foo Fighters was going to be like a B theme.

[00:35] I thought it was going to come and go, and I thought we were going to look at pinball

[00:40] in 2023 as another underwhelming year of pinball.

[00:45] And now all of a sudden, you can hear it in my voice because I've been screaming about

[00:49] how awesome I think they crushed this game.

[00:53] And I mean, Jack Danger, Zombie Eddie, this game, when you look at it, it makes me feel

[01:00] like a little kid inside and I'm like, this is what pinball is supposed to be about.

[01:05] It's supposed to be something that you look down and you see a world under glass, you

[01:10] see all this fun stuff, you can't wait to shoot, the colors are very bright and vibrant

[01:16] and inviting, you hear this energetic music, and that's what pinball is all about.

[01:22] And I've always said it, a game needs to check two major boxes first and foremost.

[01:27] It needs to check the box.

[01:29] If you're a fan of the theme, are you loving what you see with the pinball machine?

[01:33] And if you're a fan of pinball, are you loving what you see from a pinball design standpoint?

[01:39] And I think this game freaking hits it out of the park.

[01:42] And I haven't seen a game that got us this excited since Godzilla.

[01:46] And all of a sudden, Stern comes out of left field with arguably a rookie designer, I know

[01:51] he did the home edition of Jurassic Park, but arguably this is Jack Danger's most important

[01:57] moment.

[01:59] Stern has given him the reins to do a cornerstone game and he has come out with something that

[02:04] is super awesome.

[02:05] And I love so much about this game.

[02:08] I love the upper play field.

[02:10] I love the alien mechanism to the right.

[02:13] I love the captive ball that loops around another ball.

[02:16] I love the death save post that I think that's the name of it.

[02:20] The death save post that pops up and knocks the ball back into play.

[02:25] And we know Jack was working on that with his homebrew game.

[02:28] The zombie yeti art package in this game is absolutely one of his best.

[02:32] I'm looking at it right now.

[02:34] And my gosh, if this game is not an FU to Raza, I don't know what is.

[02:41] I mean, when I saw this game for the first time, like this whole game is basically like

[02:46] in 80s cartoon featuring the freaking FU fighters in a modern day version of Attack from Mars.

[02:55] And we've got a van and we've got aliens and we've got one of the grooviest looking play

[03:00] fields I've ever seen from an artistic standpoint.

[03:04] And I think this thing just looks amazing.

[03:07] And I'm looking at it right now and I'm just smiling ear to ear on every aspect of this

[03:14] game.

[03:15] And it's got four flippers.

[03:17] It's got a unique layout.

[03:18] It doesn't look like the ramps are that hard to hit.

[03:21] It's got major mechs in the game that are just inviting you to shoot here.

[03:25] Right?

[03:26] Isn't that what a pinball machine is supposed to do?

[03:28] You're supposed to look down and want to figure out what happens when I shoot the ball

[03:32] there.

[03:33] It's got two awesome ramps.

[03:35] It's got drop targets.

[03:36] It's got no pop bumpers for you pop bumper fanatics out there.

[03:40] It just looks so freaking good.

[03:44] And normally when I look at a game I start to see some complaints and I'll find something

[03:48] to complain about.

[03:49] You know, Canada always has to find something to complain about and I really only have one

[03:54] complaint with this game.

[03:56] And it is a pure aesthetic complaint.

[04:00] My only complaint about FU fighters right now is that I would have liked the LE to have

[04:07] been the game that has the completely unique art package.

[04:11] The premium and the LE have the same art package but it's different colors.

[04:16] Like they change some of the colors around.

[04:18] But it's the same visual on the cabinet of like the FU fighters in the van.

[04:22] I actually like the Pro Translight the best out of all of them.

[04:27] It's the most unique because the premium and the LE guys, they're going to look somewhat

[04:31] similar, albeit the premium has like a lot of reds in it and the LE has a lot of greens

[04:36] in it.

[04:37] But I do like the fact that they gave it like the bright green armor.

[04:41] The LE pops.

[04:43] It comes with the expression lighting.

[04:45] But what I love about this game the most, it just feels like this is Zombie Yeti and

[04:50] Jack Danger's FU a little bit to John Papadook's retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[04:56] I mean that's what we're seeing in this game.

[04:58] I mean the alien creature looks just like Ned from Deep Roots Raza but it looks so damn

[05:05] good.

[05:06] And this is just a first impression.

[05:08] This is just me seeing the game for the first time.

[05:11] I think the creative direction that Jack Danger and Zombie Yeti did.

[05:15] I think turning FU fighter pinball not into just another like concert going experience

[05:22] in a box.

[05:23] You know it's not like you're going to see the FU fighters in concert the way Led Zeppelin

[05:27] was trying to do that.

[05:28] The way Rush was trying to do that.

[05:30] The way Guns N' Roses did it.

[05:32] This is like an adventure game starring the FU fighters.

[05:36] And I think that decision, the creative decision to do that made this game so much fun.

[05:43] And it just feels original.

[05:45] You know looking down on this game it just feels so damn original.

[05:49] And I love everything I see.

[05:51] I love the color palette.

[05:53] I love the unique shots.

[05:54] I can't wait to play this game.

[05:57] And this is just my first impression.

[05:58] I'm super giddy.

[05:59] I'm super happy.

[06:01] And I think this game is going to be a great success for a stern pinball.

[06:05] Now the other question is this.

[06:07] Do I think they're going to sell a thousand of these at $13,000 a pop?

[06:12] I actually do think they're going to sell all of the L.E.s.

[06:15] But I just don't think they're going to sell them all out this week.

[06:19] We will see.

[06:20] Jack Danger is doing his stream tomorrow.

[06:22] I got the dates wrong.

[06:24] There's only 28 days in February.

[06:26] And so when I was seeing like March 1st I thought it was Friday but it's actually tomorrow.

[06:31] I think the more we see of this game when we see the code and the animations, you know

[06:35] it's the same coder from Deadpool.

[06:37] I think it's Tanya.

[06:38] He's going to crush it with this code.

[06:41] And I think when we see all of this game come together.

[06:44] I think a lot of people out there whether you love the Foo Fighters or not, you're going

[06:49] to be super excited about this package.

[06:52] But the painful thing in all of Pinball is this.

[06:54] As much as I love this game right now and I would love to get one, it's still hard to

[07:00] wake up and spend $13,000 on a stern LE.

[07:04] I mean I remember the days when games like Ghostbusters were $7,500 or $8,000 for an

[07:10] LE and it's just a lot more cheddar to spend on a single pinball machine.

[07:16] Now that being said, I'm happy that they're going back to like the foiled artwork on the

[07:21] LE, real mirrored back glass.

[07:24] I think this game does absolutely embarrass that joke of a game known as James Bond 60th.

[07:31] And I think everyone who ordered a James Bond 60th right now is looking down at this game

[07:35] and I know you've got more money than all of us, you people who ordered that game.

[07:40] But what a joke of a cash grab that game was when you look at this game.

[07:44] And here's the other thing and this is the important part is Stern Pinball got this

[07:48] game to market before Godfather, before Galactic Tank Force.

[07:54] And now the real interesting thing is this, with Stern Pinball having this game on the

[07:59] line right now, what is this going to do to people who are waiting for Scooby-Doo?

[08:04] What is this going to do to Jersey Jack Pinball's plans to launch Godfather?

[08:08] How do you launch Godfather?

[08:10] A very slow and dark mob drama.

[08:14] How are you going to follow up this game with that game?

[08:17] I'm really worried about Jersey Jack Pinball, ladies and gentlemen.

[08:21] And I also think Galactic Tank Force, same thing.

[08:24] Like I don't think anyone, I don't think David Fix realized this is what Foo Fighters was

[08:29] going to be.

[08:30] And even though Galactic Tank Force is pretty packed and I'm going to share with you the

[08:34] image that all these other pinball media outlets have been looking at because I only think it's

[08:39] fair that you get to see it too.

[08:42] I'm going to share it with you, but you've got to renew your Canada Club membership tomorrow.

[08:46] That's when I'm going to share it after we process everybody's payments for Canada's

[08:50] Pinball podcast and then I will share it.

[08:53] You're going to have to renew your Canada Club membership for March and then you'll

[08:57] get to see Galactic Tank Force.

[08:59] But what a good day for Pinball.

[09:01] And I think a lot of people are feeling that right now.

[09:03] The vibes of today have been amazing.

[09:06] I think everyone is so happy for Jack Danger because now we've got a new young designer

[09:12] that shows us he's very capable.

[09:15] He's very creative and he's approaching pinball differently.

[09:19] And this is what we want, right?

[09:20] We don't want like Pat Lawler like washed up with the same recycled ideas, basically

[09:26] nerfing Toy Story with his game.

[09:28] We want youth in pinball.

[09:30] Like I would rather have Jack Danger than Steve Ritchie.

[09:34] I want young people with new ideas, young people like Eric Minier, young people like Scott

[09:40] Denise.

[09:41] I think what we're witnessing right now is the birth of a whole new generation of younger

[09:46] designers who didn't grow up during the 90s and they're not trying to relive their glory

[09:50] days.

[09:51] And look, we'll see if Dennis Nordman can do it.

[09:53] He's a great designer.

[09:55] But all of these guys from the 90s, I mean, it's questionable how hungry they still are.

[10:01] How hungry do you think George Gomez really is to make a name for himself?

[10:05] I mean, he's George freaking Gomez.

[10:07] And I knew it.

[10:08] And I'm looking at this game.

[10:09] It's just so much more interesting to me than James Bond.

[10:13] And again, Canada's been telling everybody, wait and see, wait and see.

[10:17] And this is why you should wait and see.

[10:19] And also like, this is why you might not want to buy the game today.

[10:23] Because if you wait a couple of weeks, you'll be able to see Foo Fighters.

[10:26] You'll be able to see Godfather.

[10:28] You'll be able to see Galactic Tank Force.

[10:31] You'll be able to play Scooby Doo.

[10:33] I mean, there are so many options right now.

[10:35] I mean, distributors must be really happy.

[10:37] They finally have all of these games coming out.

[10:40] But again, this is why Stern's going to benefit because they're going to be able to make the

[10:43] games so quickly.

[10:45] People are probably going to start to see Foo Fighters on location before we even see

[10:50] Godfather Pimbal from Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:52] My voice is gone.

[10:54] I've been chatting with many of you offline today about this game and how exciting this

[10:59] game is.

[11:00] I just think this game was the most brilliant direction to go in with a band like Foo Fighters.

[11:06] And I don't think anyone saw this coming.

[11:07] I think this has blindsided the rest of the Pimbal industry.

[11:11] And I think Jack Danger is now a force to be reckoned with in the Pimbal world.

[11:16] And it's going to get real exciting from here because there's a lot at stake now.

[11:20] I mean, Stern Pimbal is already the most successful Pimbal company of all time.

[11:25] And now we've got this and now they've got Jack Danger.

[11:28] And I put out a little thing, people.

[11:30] Imagine if Stern Pimbal goes and gets Eric Minier to join their crew over there.

[11:34] I mean, they're just like a couple designers away from just taking over all of Pimbal.

[11:39] I mean it.

[11:40] What a great day for Stern Pimbal.

[11:42] And also what a great day for Stern's marketing.

[11:44] I mean, the marketing around this game was genius.

[11:48] The teaser videos they put out were the best they've ever done.

[11:51] And all the teaser imagery that Zambietti made, this might be the best launch Stern has ever

[11:57] done.

[11:58] I mean it.

[11:59] And they deserve a round of applause.

[12:00] And they also really needed it because James Bond was the worst launch they've ever done.

[12:05] And I mean it when I say it.

[12:06] Jersey Jack, you got to wake up.

[12:08] It was kind of embarrassing that all you thought you could do this week was put out your like

[12:12] acknowledgement that it's Godfather and get ready to have a seat at the table.

[12:16] What are you doing?

[12:17] What are you doing, Jersey Jack?

[12:18] You got to get back into the ring.

[12:20] You got to get your swagger back.

[12:22] You're not going to win this battle with the same playbook you've been using with games

[12:26] like Guns N' Roses.

[12:28] Times have changed.

[12:29] You don't have Guns N' Roses.

[12:31] You don't have Slash.

[12:32] And so you've got to figure out how to get people excited about Godfather.

[12:36] And it sure as heck is not going to happen if Jack Winnari is taking photos in front

[12:41] of a Harry Potter mural outside of Warner Brothers.

[12:44] Like what were you thinking?

[12:46] There are more people and more pages on Pinside where people are discussing Harry Potter than

[12:52] they are discussing Godfather.

[12:54] I hope there's an emergency meeting over at Jersey Jack Pinball this week because they

[12:58] got to get their ducks in a row and figure out how do they do this now because the game

[13:02] has changed and Mr. Jack Danger and Zombie Eddie, they changed the game this week and

[13:07] I think they're going to crush it and I think the sales are going to be amazing and I think

[13:11] this game is going to make people so happy.

[13:14] And this is all we want.

[13:15] I want to see games that come out that make me smile like this.

[13:18] I have no more energy left because I'm that excited about this game and no, I'm not buying

[13:24] one yet.

[13:25] I can't wait to play it and I'm just happy for all of you.

[13:29] I'm happy for Pinball.

[13:30] I'm happy for the Pinball content creators.

[13:32] I'm happy for everybody because this is what Pinball needs.

[13:36] More games like this that just make us go, wow, and less jokes like James Bond 60th, less

[13:44] jokes like Led Zeppelin, less jokes like Toy Story 4.

[13:48] We don't need those games.

[13:50] Keep your mediocre games out of Pinball.

[13:52] We need more of this.

[13:54] Good job, Jack.

[13:55] Good job, Zombie Eddie.

[13:57] Great job, Stern Pinball and the entire team that worked on Foo Fighters.

[14:00] I can't wait to play it later.
