[00:00] I said I'll sit right there, gonna find you, I'll find you, I'll find you, I'll have you with me.

[00:07] Did you find my life, my love of my lady, I guess I said it.

[00:14] Say it again.

[00:20] Good Monday morning people. It's a beautiful day in New York City.

[00:24] It's a beautiful day for a podcast. It's Monday following a weekend at Allentown with Ted following Guardians of the Galaxy volume two.

[00:34] I saw it twice. It's that good.

[00:37] Before I air the interview with Ted in our recap of Allentown, I want to do a little sort of feedback from you guys out there.

[00:45] I haven't read some of your comments and I also want to do a few shout outs.

[00:49] I want to do a shout out to Ryan, my boy over there in Australia. Ryan and I, we chat up pinball all the time on Facebook.

[00:57] Really awesome guy. I got a great collection.

[01:00] He feeds me some information every once in a while from when he hears in the rumor mill in Australia and I get to compare it with what I hear in the rumor mill in the States.

[01:07] And we're usually all over the place. We're all over the place of what's gonna happen next.

[01:12] Want to give a shout out to Gil Veles. I hope you're pronounced that right Gil.

[01:18] Gil's helping me find a technician to fix. Yes, I said fix my magic girl.

[01:24] My magic girl had the RGB LED light boards go out on Friday night, bummed me out beyond belief.

[01:32] But as you'll hear on this podcast, we've got a good plan of attack to get the game fixed and up and running.

[01:39] You know, and look, magic girl, it's gonna have issues.

[01:42] It's not gonna be like this pinball machine that has no issues whatsoever.

[01:46] And I'm probably the only dude in America that has played magic girl pretty consistently since it came out.

[01:52] So I think whatever problems I have other people will encounter.

[01:55] So I don't mind being the guinea pig. I also, I've got him better at being completely OCD when a pinball machine goes down.

[02:03] You always want that immediate fix, but we'll get it fixed. It's just light boards.

[02:08] You know, it's everything, everything can be repaired.

[02:11] And I have to say, I have to say, the guy who's over to American pinball, Dovel, they are awesome.

[02:17] They are gonna help me get this thing fixed as well. And you'll hear that as we hear the interview about Alan Town.

[02:22] Want to give a shout out to my local new Jersey homeboy, Robert, who he's the guy who's gonna help me store my arcade machines.

[02:33] He's got a great, great arcade. He's got a Batman 66. And now adding to his collection will be magic girl number seven.

[02:43] That is right. Robert is the individual who sniped in and won the magic girl on Saturday night for I think a great buy at around $20,000.

[02:55] A little bit over 20 grand. And I've been talking to Robert about my magic girl. I've even been telling him he's been looking for one.

[03:02] And I knew the price would sort of go down since the game is not working. But as a collectible, as a rare pinball item, I think Robert got a really good buy at this game.

[03:14] I really do. Once these things dry up, there's not gonna be that many more available.

[03:19] And I look forward to seeing Robert unbox it. And I hope fully I can be there when that happens. I've got some good sort of feedback on what to do when you set it up.

[03:31] But most importantly, I was telling him you got to manage your expectations when you play magic girl. You have to see it as a beautiful work of art as a rare thing that has this incredible story.

[03:43] And don't expect to get the wizard mode anytime soon because it ain't happening, Robert. It ain't happening. But congratulations. I think it was well bought.

[03:52] And just saying you know too, I know I put in a drunken bid and I just want it. But the thing is the person I outbid wasn't Robert and that guy put in 20 grand as his max bid.

[04:03] So if Robert wanted to win it, which he was going to, I think I cost you an additional like 50 bucks, Robert. So my bad, I'll buy you some beers when I come play your magic girl.

[04:15] All right, let's do some listener feedback. It's been a while. So let's pull up. Let's do this one. So Franco, Franco wrote me. Hi, canada.

[04:26] I'm heading, I'm heating sorry, heating your call for listener feedback. I only discovered the world of canada when you sought refuge in the Aussie arcade forums.

[04:34] While I love Pimbal and podcast, I assume Pimbal podcast would be dry and boring so I never bothered with them. However, after reading your asylum thread, lamenting your persecution on Pinside, I thought I would see what all the canada hate is all about for entertainment value.

[04:50] Suffice to say I have binge listened to about half of your episodes and they are fantastic. The passion to which you speak about Pimbal is invigorating to the point where I want to call my local Pimbal distributor and start dropping money on new pins. Well, Franco, thank you so much. I'm happy to hear that canada's Pimbal podcast is actually encouraging people to buy more Pimbal machines. I think that is great. All right, let's see who else we have feedback from here.

[05:19] I got asked if I was going to Southern Fried Gaming Expo by Bill Dodd. Bill, you know, I don't know if I'm going to go down to Atlanta. We'll see. I have to really sort of balance how many Pimbal shows I go to simply because I need to do other things. I need to go other places with Brenda. We've got weddings to go do. But mainly we're doing a kitchen renovation right now.

[05:46] And it's going to be pretty expensive to the point where I could get many, many a few super LEDs for the price of this kitchen Renault. And I need to be sort of judicious in how I spend my money this year. So that being said, I don't think I'll be doing a lot of traveling for Pimbal. Bill also wrote a great story about the differences between different distributors and my last podcast. I really implored people to use distributors.

[06:13] But I also should have caveat that not every distributor experience is the same. And if you're looking for a distributor, really find someone that is reputable that has good feedback from other buyers.

[06:27] But also works for you, right? Works for you. There's a lot of different personalities out there in the Pimbal distributor marketplace. So find someone that you really connect with before you start handing over your money.

[06:40] All right, let's air the interview with Ted. I took Brenda to Allentown. We met up with Ted there. We had a great time. I want to say that, you know, all these shows, all the shows are about the people that you meet there.

[06:53] Had a bunch of people come up and say, Hey, Knaid, I love the podcast to all those people that I met at the show. It was great hanging with you guys. You know who you are. I'm super happy that you listen to the podcast.

[07:05] It was great seeing Chris from Coin Takeer there and his wife Melissa and the Sun Scott. They're really great people. It was great seeing the Mezzel mod family there. Tim and wife were there. It was great seeing them and hanging out with them for a while.

[07:21] It's just all the people there. It's such a great scene to hang out with Pimbal people and to be able to just geek out on Pimbal in person.

[07:29] I saw the tournament going on and again, it reminds me these tournament guys the same like 20 do and I get they love it about Pimbal. It's just I never understand why you want to keep driving hours and hours and hours to win a few bucks here and there.

[07:43] When you could be just talking to people and enjoying enjoying the hobby, I think the better way, which is talking to people instead of just like,

[07:53] like, Slaven away at the tournaments. It's like chopping wood when I watch these guys. But again, that's just not my thing. I respect that they like that. But again, it's not for me.

[08:03] All right, I give you ladies and gentlemen, after a long wait, Ted has rejoined the show. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[08:14] Our first guest of the show, Ted, Ted, welcome back. It's been too long. We talk a lot on the phone, but we haven't been in podcast in a while.

[08:23] Well, thank you. Thank you. And that's true. We haven't done all these in a while. It's because we haven't done much in a while. At least I haven't.

[08:35] But now we're talking about Alan Town, which was a fun show. We actually met up down there because I was hoping to bring home a machine.

[08:47] I was looking to get that black rose, but by the time I got there on Saturday, of course, it was sold.

[08:53] All right. Well, we're going to talk about let's we're going to do our little recap of Alan Town and Ted knows I almost didn't make it to Alan Town because the night before the show, I was playing magic girl and all of a sudden my RGB LED lights just go out.

[09:13] And I get like super depressed and then Ted and I are trying to figure out if we're going to the show the next day. And I literally was like, I don't even know if I want to go now. It was like one of those things is like when your magic girl goes out, the first thing that goes to your head is, man, I don't there's no customer service number.

[09:34] I don't if I mean, what you said customer service is just craft me up. Well, there's no customer service number. There's the Zidware warranty, which is pretty much a non-existent promise.

[09:48] John, John hasn't responded to me in like two months since I got the machine. And so the first thing that went through my head is like, this thing's broken for life. I'm just never going to get it fixed.

[10:00] But then Ted, I heard that Houdini was going to be at Alan Town. And also I read on Pinside that the Dovel and the American pinball people were there. So I said, you know, I might as well just go and talk to Dovel at the show and we'll talk about that as we go through the recap.

[10:16] So Brendan and not Brenda and myself decided to make it to Alan Town and we met up with Ted there. And Ted, you drove yourself. When did you leave for the show around like 10 am?

[10:26] That's something like they took longer to get there because on 78 there was there was traffic backed up for there was construction. But on the way back, it took me a long time because there was an accident or something. So I hit horrible traffic both ways because while everyone was saying there was no traffic. Yes, that's because they got there at

[10:44] on Thursday and then left at like 9 o'clock at night on Sunday. So I heard from a lot of people Ted that Friday the show is just like jam packed. Like Saturday was actually a quieter day to be there. So let's talk about the show. Now Alan Town for you people that are not familiar with geography and where it is.

[11:07] It sounds about two hours from New York City. It's near like the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. And it's this show where there's like it's like a convention center sort of like a big warehouse and then next to it's a food market. So it's fun there because you can have like a good lunch and then you can play a bunch of pinball. Now this is the second year Ted and I have gone. Now Ted, let's let's just run down what we saw.

[11:31] But I've been going here as even before that. Well, you're you're veteran. Let's. So where were your overall thoughts of of the show this year? Let's let's go down by the titles we saw.

[11:41] Let's when you when you were going in Ted, like what was the one game you were most excited to see?

[11:49] Um, well, first of all, I want to say for anyone that is listening, I and most of you know me. I am not pro or con any company. I wish all the pinball companies do well. I wish they'd all make great games. I wish there'd be a lot of competition.

[12:07] So I have no vested interest in any company or anything. It's just how I feel about a company in general.

[12:15] The number one game I want to see there was Houdini. I wanted to play a tag from Mars Rebne because that that maybe that's on my short list to get.

[12:27] I want to play alien because that was also on like a top five list. So there was a number of machines and I want to play black rose, which I was hoping to buy. But because I never played it before.

[12:40] I know I want to play a few games that I never played before. So so really Houdini. I just I just want to see that damn ball jump through the air. Right.

[12:48] Ted is talking about the catapult. The catapult. So the guy in the runs that company. Okay. So so dovel runs American pinball. Um and that is the gentleman we were talking to you. So when we when I first got there, we'll start.

[13:04] We'll start with like when I walked through the door, I just be lined it for American pinball because I wanted to talk to dovel about my magic board going out and he was really nice. I caught him there.

[13:16] He was leaving in like a half hour. So I was lucky I got there when I did and I'll say this and we won't believe at this point.

[13:23] I really respect dovel and the guys at American pinball and he he let me know that they made the boards for magic.

[13:30] And he's going to help me fix it. But I'm waiting for a tech to lift the hood on this machine because every time I try to fix my own pinball machines, Ted, I end up breaking them even more.

[13:41] You know, you or I should not touch no with the workings of a pinball machine, especially when it's electrical work. I literally I tried to mess with the connectors on the RGB RGB LED boards. The problem is they're like daisy chained like was were like if one board goes out every board after that board will go out.

[14:01] And because every board is out, I think it's the first board. But anyway, I'm not we're going to talk about Alan time. So we get there who deenies like one of the games that you really wanted to play now.

[14:12] There was a long line for who deenie at the door in the entire show. Did you get a chance to jump on who deenie?

[14:18] No, I just I watched we were talking to him when there was some people there and then the line got you know down to about 30 and I said you know what I'm not going to I'm not waiting on the I'll just watch it be played and so I just stood there and watch it and it looked like it was well made.

[14:33] There were plenty of toys plenty of things on the other screen was was cool and this is like what he said the code was like 20 or 30% or something.

[14:42] Some low number and it was it was cool. It was a look like a really cool machine.

[14:48] Yes, it's just from watching other people play and looked it looked really nice.

[14:52] Right and and it's really impressive to see how far along this game is considering it they started this game in November of 2016.

[15:02] And what we heard from our friends at American pinball was that they expect this game to be out by the end of the year.

[15:09] So they which you know when you look at the game now it's like wow they've got a lot of time to tweak this thing.

[15:17] Yeah, but yeah, yes, but the game the game looked good.

[15:20] Yeah, it played very well. I think my concern and I asked him I said well how often does that ball really jump into the you know really make it.

[15:28] And he said it's up. It's this beginning stage had 94% which is I think it's phenomenal.

[15:35] Right. So I thought it's like 50% I thought this thing would never but it was 94% so that was great.

[15:41] So so that's the big guy. Well, I would have said this is next to nothing.

[15:47] So I mean I didn't think this thing would have been working so well.

[15:51] So it's good like fun to play to those to those of you listening who haven't seen this function yet.

[15:57] There's a really cool mechanism on who Dini that fires the ball for it's a catapult on the left side.

[16:03] It's sort of like in the exact location of where the medieval madness catapult is.

[16:07] But there's no rail it fires the ball through the mid air into this magic box super super cool.

[16:14] That one toy on that machine Ted is cooler than anything on magic girl.

[16:21] You know and we talked to dovel to about who Dini and we talked to Josh Kugler who's doing the coding and nothing on this machine is carried over from the jump op of Duke who Dini that people saw at expo of 2016.

[16:36] And do you remember what what Josh was telling us Teddy was saying they really wanted this game to be in honor of the actual Harry who Dini's that's why they didn't like the other artwork.

[16:49] And they really wanted this game to pay you know it's like in homage to Harry who Dini the man himself so what they didn't want to act as picture on it they didn't want any of this so they wanted the real who Dini and the real look.

[17:04] You know they did the right thing this game is is very very cool looking I mean who Dini's glowing eyes I mean it really I mean everywhere I was listening to people online that were playing and everybody had a blast.

[17:16] Finally got a chance to play dialed in.

[17:19] Okay so let's jump the dialed in now dialed in there were two of them there that that Joe from pinball star brought to the show and Ted you had not played it before before you played dialed in you started playing Wizard of Oz or not no hobbit you kept talking about the hobbit and I was like just wait.

[17:36] What did you think about that?

[17:38] I went to Jersey Jackson and I only played it when I went to see him at the factory and I only played it but it just began so so it was there was no code there was no nothing and I thought the game was was okay it was pretty good even then you know I played it now I don't know I think I was a great game I mean was it a boss and hobbit it just old great games I mean I don't know I like them so you know I don't I don't know it's very tough to figure out something to get but I don't know I don't know it's very tough to figure out something to get but I'm not sure if I can do it.

[18:05] Something to get but dialed in is you know because again it's not you know a lot of people said it wasn't there kind of game or whatever they don't like the artwork or whatever but the game is just a blast to play it it's it's it's like a tank the graphics are phenomenal there's a million toys on the play feel

[18:22] you know we took pictures of ourselves it took pictures of us while we were playing I'll tell you it was just a fun machine right yeah so Ted Brenda and myself we played a three player game of dialed in and

[18:34] you know to just mirror what Ted saying here I mean when you when you play a bunch of machines that a show like this and what's great to about

[18:41] Allentown is all the big games that people went to Texas for were there every single game pretty much that like the new releases was there

[18:50] minus big Lebowski but we wouldn't even talk about that but dialed in it's it's it's a pat luller game and it's pat luller mixed with the quality

[18:59] when I say quality I mean like the quality feel of a Jersey Jack machine which I again think is levels above anything else out there

[19:06] what I loved about dialed in is like there's just so much right in that standard body game but it doesn't feel like there's no brick shots

[19:16] like everything is smooth and the flow is amazing and I think that's the genius of pat luller is he gives you incredible flow he jammed so much into the game

[19:25] but it doesn't feel crowded you know it's like it's like it was it was it was fun I mean looking back and forth you know from that game to you know

[19:33] Hobbit or words or was just amazing how much stuff is in that game it's not a white body game it was okay but the one thing you said was was really correct

[19:41] and I played a bunch of games at the show and and I'll tell you the one thing is the quality of the Jersey Jack games is just above all the other all the other games

[19:51] I mean they really look like and feel like they're they're put together you know very well very solid so that was that was that was really I got to play a bunch of games on the

[20:03] type from Mars remake which was really cool I mean that you know the improved graphics on that color thing that's you know that big screen

[20:10] that goes across the bottom is really really nice I mean the game plays you know fantastic it's tough and I was going to actually order one right there

[20:19] at the show but then I played another game I never played before which was walking dead I know you're gonna I was talking about the whole damn show I was so impressed looking dead

[20:33] it was just a lot of fun I really really enjoyed it so I said you know what this is a great game I was playing Marcos game that that company

[20:43] and I looked at it and I told the guy says how much is the game and he gave me a price he says I said can I buy this one right here on the floor you just show

[20:53] special you can buy this one off the floor I said that's great with saying that his partner the other guy was with comes over and says some football guy from the Pittsburgh Steelers or whoever the hell this came over

[21:05] and just bought all the whole row of machines he bought like a Batman it goes busters a game of thrones the walking dead everything that was there he bought

[21:12] the whole row so I was like you gotta be kidding me right so but but that was a really really fun game I had a real good time playing

[21:22] all right so we're there and Ted's got some money he wants to you know he's entertaining bringing a game home and all of a sudden he just won't stop talking about the walking dead as if it's some new game that he discovered it

[21:40] it's new to Ted is new to Ted so every time he started playing a game Ted would just be like yeah but what do you think about the walking dead I'm like Jesus Ted

[21:48] here's what I know about the walk I'm a crossbow to work and everything was fantastic I mean like here's what I know about the walking dead it is it is considered to be one of Stern's greatest

[21:56] Pimball machines of all time it is probably considered to be one of lineman's greatest coded games ever people swear by it it was a game

[22:06] that when it first came out people were down about how brutal it was and some of the shot layout like the pop bumpers the ball would go straight down the middle

[22:14] there was some annoying sort of you know sort of basically like the game is considered to be a little bit unfair and frustrating but people figured out how to tweak it and dial it in better

[22:28] but then the code when the code got finished people just fell in love with the game it was one of those games where when the code is totally finished on that game

[22:38] yeah the code is totally done and it's one of those games where you know all this stuff was there but you know when the code wasn't finished it was sort of a little mediocre but now it's considered to be one of Stern's best

[22:52] and I know you I told you the rumor that they might make a walking dead with a comic book art and you were like I've never even read a single comic of the walking dead

[23:00] I've never read the comic I've seen all the shows but I've never read the comic

[23:04] so what price did they give you for walking dead premium premium at like to buy the one that's being played at Allentown

[23:10] I really can't say 6300

[23:14] all right I gotta go back and look because I think he also bald me for 6300 he shipped to me and I said okay what's the extra cost because that's with it

[23:26] now again don't forget this is a show machine it's not a brand new in the box machine this is a show machine so you know so that's it

[23:34] so you know I can get it there I can get it your coin taker is great I mean I know them I just happen to be there talk with guy

[23:40] I guess coin taker didn't have one a premium on the floor but they're they're they're up in Sunburn they're by my relatives

[23:46] they're literally 10 minutes from from my my relatives up in Pennsylvania which and where they're all the time so anytime I want

[23:52] they said they're gonna be getting them in a couple weeks so I'll see if we can work out so you know again I'm still gonna see what happens

[23:58] you never know what's gonna happen Star Wars they might be some announcement in the next you know a few weeks

[24:02] you know who knows you know what's what's going on I have to talk about it I feel out for a scared stiff I wanted to have a better version of it

[24:12] and then the guy said he just doesn't want to sell it now I hate no scared stiff is the best game you're you are broken record on that game

[24:20] just go get it let's talk about aros because because I play right and I didn't like it and then I came around and I do like it

[24:28] right well we're yeah we're gonna have to finish it with Alan town we'll talk about some of the news like Star Wars so okay so arosmith is a game where so we played that we played dialed in we really loved it

[24:38] one final mention I wanted to say about dialed in is there's a magnet I didn't realize this there's the magnet on the right side of that game that's where the drones are

[24:48] but there's also like another hidden magnet on the left side of the playfield which is absolutely wicked what it does with the ball

[24:55] I don't it's to me like dialed in again I just I can't say enough about all the different surprises that game has I think by the time the code is done in that game

[25:06] it could be one of Waller's best pins ever but I will also say Ted and I don't know if you felt this it does suffer a little bit because you know it's an original theme

[25:16] I don't really know what I'm doing but you know I'm saying like you oh absolutely yeah I you know you just smack the ball around

[25:24] see what's going on I mean I'm talking about just the pure fun of playing it without even what the hell is happening I don't know I'm shooting for the light comes on I shoot for that thing

[25:31] and if I get it I get it you know but the screen would come it was just stuff happening all the time right I did like how easy it was to explain

[25:39] how to start a mode which is you shoot the guy holding the lightning bolts he charges the cell phone you then shoot the cell phone scoop to start the mode

[25:49] and then when you pick up the phone call it tells you what to do on the phone so it's like you know shoot the quantum theater shoot the the left ramp

[25:59] so it's I like that that you can explain to people like a sequence of what to do to get stuff going I love the way the multi balls lock and that sort of subway station really really cool stuff in that game

[26:12] so I can't wait to play one in a home environment someday you know everyone knows I've got money down I'm not sure if I'm going to take my collector's edition when it becomes available

[26:23] but dialed in is on the line in May so we should see them soon so we then go to Erasmith now Erasmith is a game where we've heard a lot of stuff

[26:33] Ted what were your feelings when we jumped on Erasmith well it first I just it's it's a seem like some other games so so it wasn't the you know I saw the ball being shot in a couple of different things

[26:46] like who do you mean so it wasn't you know the ball going into the first couple times the ball tried to make it into the toy box yeah it just would bounce off of it so I said oh okay I guess it's not working of course I think we found it later on right that you have to wait for it open then you push the

[27:01] flipper and shoots the ball there was there was something again we didn't know about the game so after playing you know a few games on it it sort of grew on me and it was good I think Erasmith is real is a fun game I like it.

[27:13] I think you mentioned when you were playing Erasmith immediately was it just felt lighter and a little cheaper than walking dead games playing all the different games that were there out of out of all of them that game felt the the lightest not necessarily cheaper like being cheap I mean just

[27:31] lighter and not as solid and bulky right as the other machines and then what when I was saying that the guy behind me said oh that well the expert oh that's because that's a so and so machine not

[27:43] or whatever the hell it is and it's like 50 pounds lighter right it's it's running spike which is Stern's new basically there's like nothing in the back box anymore and there's it's it's it's got less components so it's it actually is a much lighter game well yeah but I can't tell

[28:00] I mean again it just to me it just seemed that again I could be totally off base but it just seemed that way to me that it was that was the case but either way you know it was a fun game and you know we I'll say this about Erasmith I had a really good game on it I was going for a while I think I got like for me 80 million was pretty decent for a first play at the game I hadn't really played it was an Erasmith premium we were playing

[28:28] and I'll say this I mean obviously the artwork is killer the I think the LCD animations on Erasmith are phenomenal right it's like just the right amount of stuff going on the screen you know and you're when you look up it gives you the pinball information

[28:45] you know quickly where you know I love like Steven Tyler getting in the elevator and the hot chick gets in you know and he's like love an in elevator multi ball starting like it's it's really really well integrated I think it's the best LCD animation integration of any of the new pens right it's it doesn't look is good is like dialed in does or hobbit but you remember when we were standing by hobbit Ted and like look at that screen right now there's like eight things going on at once like you know I mean I got a lot of things going on at once

[29:15] you don't know what to look at it's too much information on the screen but I thought Erasmith has like the perfect amount and it looks much better than Batman 66 like the display looks much better than just clips of like Erasmith music videos like I like that they animated everything I was not crazy about Batman

[29:32] and surprisingly at all I didn't get a chance to play it but I watched a few people play it and the reaction to the play was really mixed I mean you know some people thought it was cool but some people just didn't like like me I didn't find it to be really needed at all I mean again everybody has their little things but it was okay but I think what he did was better right so I think everybody would agree with that statement and I think Ted you bring up a good point about it

[30:02] about pimbal right so there's playing pimbal but you can also stand over a machine and get a good sense of what's in that machine like what are what are the shots what's the layout does the machine pull you in by looking at it and anything certain games have that magnetic appeal to it when I look at Batman 66 I just I just don't get that feeling like I want to jump on this thing and play this thing and I've played it before and I didn't play it before

[30:32] and you know it plays decent but I think Batman 66 will go down as a bit of a rushed effort by Stern it'll also go down is probably the most overpriced game ever by Stern because remember Ted like the Ellie Batman was $10,000 like more than more than a dialed in Ellie and if you compare dialed in the Batman right it's like it's not it's apples to oranges in terms of where the value is

[31:02] yeah well you know hey look to to each their own some people saying they love it and that's good good for them I'm glad they like it but let's move on to Alien yes so we I we Alien was there I was just to play it with what's the guy's yeah so whatever thing was Zena right yeah I think so yeah he's a very nice guy and so we waited there I think you're already left so we waited or we would just you know

[31:28] you know both shelling while we were waiting and I said look you know what I can't wait to play this game anymore for first of all the what's that thing called what shoots out of the hole that the the whole next to the Zeno head with the ball shoots out the scoop I don't know it's just there's a hole there the ball flies out of it right but but but the ball couldn't make it out of it so it's like you're waiting and you're waiting and the ball is trying is trying a five times 10 times 15 times and it was just after while it just got it

[31:58] annoying that you know that it kept that it kept doing that but you know I went but when it did work was fine so we just decided to stick it out he said look we've been waiting this long let's let's hang out I said fine so we waited we finally got a chance you know to play it and you know it was okay but it wasn't you know I mean again for me it wasn't as good as a tack for Mars it wasn't as good as as walking dead or who Dean or or dialed in so I mean I've I've put it back a little and then and of course

[32:28] everybody wanted to see the Zeno head work everyone was saying oh well wait to see the the tongue come out and grab the ball and everyone's waiting and it's never happened so one guy says I was here for an hour and

[32:37] they never happened finally some guy chimed in and says it's disconnected and it was all made that's like I said why would they put this game on display you know for this when there's two things not working on it and the main toy you know didn't work

[32:51] which is to noise people so so that was a little a little bit of an annoying thing but you know overall the game you know look pretty cool I mean the back

[33:00] back box is a little you know that's strange shape so little getting used to because it's thinner than than the regular you know box but you know we had a good game on it I mean it

[33:10] when it played finally kept on the ball wouldn't come out but but otherwise you know it was it was okay but like I said there's nothing wrong with it but

[33:17] I am but there's nothing like nothing nothing nothing blew you away nothing blew me away I would get one of the other games first before and don't and again this is not saying this for any

[33:28] reason other alien is it would be a dream theme for me alien would be I would love to get an alien way more than I'd like to get you know a walking

[33:36] dead or a game of thrones or anything else but just with the game play alone I just had much more fun playing walking dead than I did with with

[33:46] the alien so that's that's I got to go by you know on the machine but you know again it is what it is and there were people there again it was mixed you know some people

[33:54] disappointed this or that I did hear a few people say I'm glad I got to play this because I was about to order it and and now they're not going to

[34:03] order it so so there were some people there that had changed the playing that playing the game had actually changed their mind well it's

[34:09] still has a lot it still has a long ways to go you know so we'll see if it gets well yeah I think what's I think what's

[34:18] difficult is you know it's May of 2017 and alien is at a show and it doesn't really function properly and I think

[34:29] having a game at a show where other games are working properly is is difficult right because if you see

[34:38] things that aren't working and like the Xeno head not working in the game is like I would not want it to be at a show on the

[34:45] split without the major toy working right I think that's yeah if you take it to a show call them up and say hey look ship me out a working

[34:53] head or do something with the code do you want to make sales there for them I mean you want people to buy it and you know when

[35:00] people are there in the main toy on the on the machine does not work is disconnected you know it just annoys people so

[35:07] I would have you know waited until they they had a game with the Xeno head working I saw on Pennside that they shipped out a few

[35:14] games also this week with and they didn't even put the Xeno heads on the games they're not even in the game the whole

[35:23] head the whole head's not in the game and they're just sending out what you know they're sending out the game with the head

[35:29] disengaged well you know what that means that that means that's not a code problem that that's an actual mechanical problem with the head

[35:37] I guess if they're not sending the head at all to be to be you know make the code better that means the head they're doing some update on the head

[35:45] which you know again fine all right let them do it but all right we'll talk about highway in a little bit when we get to news

[35:52] and what's going on in the industry so you can play alien you play it done well you know I think we're we're coming

[35:58] like let's do this let's talk about give me your pick for favorite pen of the show and then and then I'll give my

[36:05] pick and then we'll go on to some news items that's going on just of the pins that we've talked about are ones that in general

[36:11] just at the show like what was your favorite pen give me give me your top two and then we but remove walking dead

[36:17] from it because it's two holes it's out of the new pins um um that's time I would I'd say dialed in was

[36:27] is a game I would definitely like to play again and um and who didn't I I would like to play so I mean

[36:35] but I'm not again I watched them you know play it and it just seemed like it was really cool the the look of the game

[36:41] it was nice so those two games I think were you know we're probably the two the two hits I mean alien was

[36:47] definitely a hit I mean you know just because it didn't work because like I had a little bit of a problem with it

[36:53] that doesn't mean people weren't enjoying it and it was certainly people they're waiting online for it

[36:57] uh um you know all the time so I mean that was uh I'm sure that was a hit of the show as well

[37:02] but for me I like the I like the Houdini and the uh and the dialed in right well look the new pins will

[37:09] always have lines now what people's experiences are after they play the game it's you know it's

[37:16] it's it's it's hard to say if something is like is hitting with consumers in terms of

[37:21] they're gonna want to buy it after playing it now I've always said you can't

[37:26] you can't really get a feel for a game at a show and I still don't know why these companies

[37:31] don't give you headphones yeah yeah that shows the gear stuff especially I was but I didn't hear one

[37:37] thing all right well man the other thing too is like with games like alien displaying alien to get

[37:43] people to buy it in a crowded show with with full lights on is the worst way to display that game

[37:51] if I were Andrew he it's too late now because they don't have money to market this thing

[37:55] I would only show it to consumers um in pitch black rooms I would blindfold people coming in

[38:02] and I'd have like the the alien theme song going in the background and I would let them play it

[38:06] in the environment it's meant to be played um because I think that's the best first impression

[38:11] you're never gonna get that first impression again at these shows with these games now I'll say this

[38:16] my I would agree with you I think dialed in and Houdini we're by far um the two most impressive

[38:24] pins I saw at the show I also I I think Aerosmith is a heck of a fun game I think people I think

[38:31] it's gonna be the sleeper hit of the year first turn I really do um I if I loved Aerosmith as a band

[38:38] I definitely would consider that game because um I don't know how the longevity of owning an

[38:45] Aerosmith you know like you put it in your house and then two months later are you gonna be sick of it

[38:50] um if you don't love the band probably um but and I know them they did the soundtrack for one of my

[38:56] films so I mean I know these guys you know and they're they're very very nice guys I would love to

[39:01] find out what their thoughts are on the machine um I'm sure they're pretty happy I mean it I like

[39:06] like I think it I think the kiss guys are probably pretty pissed off that they got sort of the

[39:11] short end of the stick when it comes to the machine being great and I think uh Aerosmith is

[39:16] everything kiss was supposed to be and it's a similar layout but it's all the all the little

[39:21] differences make Aerosmith that much better than kiss but um dialed in continues to impress I think

[39:28] Jersey jacks got a hit on his hand um will the theme resonate with people is still a question mark

[39:34] for me and for others out there um Houdini will be great it will be end of year who knows how many

[39:42] new games are going to be announced by the end of the year though when they when they finally start

[39:46] manufacturing it but I really give these guys credit for bringing a game that's it's more stuff

[39:54] was functioning on Houdini than on alien now think about that for a minute Ted Houdini had more

[40:00] functionality and they've got eight months to go before they ship that's well secret happens

[40:09] I mean what what what that state find out that's eight months in real time or eight months in pinball

[40:14] talk but but even even so if you look at those two manufacturers right now alien is like shipping

[40:21] the customers and it's really not functioning properly I mean and Houdini is still in beta mode

[40:28] right so they're doing it the right way we'll see how well right now I mean look I'm

[40:34] all in favor of alien coming out and being a great game and and I wish Andrew all luck in the

[40:40] world and getting this thing you know moving and getting it out there uh you know my questions are

[40:45] like like everyone's I mean again I've heard the stories you know in the background too about

[40:50] about the money they they may be needing some money and um if that's the case they they should

[40:55] come right out and say it I mean I guess one of their loans is going to be coming due uh they need

[41:00] money for this stuff they're tweaking the game so um you know I wish that they would just I wrote

[41:06] on on Pinside I said if these companies would just tell us the truth we forgive so much if they

[41:13] would just come out and say hey look you know we screwed up there's there's something wrong with

[41:18] this board or the the Zeno head does the mechanism we found that it doesn't work you know whatever

[41:23] we need another two months to to to work it out and make it better uh we're running low on money so

[41:28] if you're thinking of sending in Do you know do it now we need the money to buy some parts if they

[41:32] would just be honest you know people would say okay you know we get it you know we're behind you

[41:37] you know we'll we'll do whatever it takes because you know most of the people are like that but

[41:41] when they find out when you keep making predictions and these companies are you know just not telling

[41:47] you the truth and then you find out later on whether it's uh you know dutch or whoever you know it comes

[41:53] back and it just bites you in the ass and because you're gonna find out and then it's just gonna

[41:56] piss people off and and now you know especially you know and I and I said this to Andrew you got to

[42:03] be real careful with with getting when people want uh you know refunds you know you telling someone

[42:08] 30 or 60 days I mean I know some people's like oh you know why they need the money now this is

[42:13] but you know people have gone through this this stuff before and if they feel they're not being

[42:17] told the whole truth I you know they want their money this is not a small amount of money for

[42:23] people and there's there's a lot of people out there and including myself we're not multi multi

[42:27] millionaires and and you know eight grand or seven grand it's a lot of money you know to some people

[42:32] and some people are just tired of the weight and what do you um well two things I want to address so

[42:39] and Ted and I have this conversation like almost every other night when I'm walking home from work

[42:44] Ted is always telling me if they just tell the truth everything you'll be all right but

[42:47] Ted do you honestly believe if if they came out and said we need money or we you know we need

[42:55] people to send in money to keep this ship afloat that money would go in to highway or

[43:00] everyone would want to pull their money out depends on how you said it I mean if they if they said

[43:04] hey we're on the last legs we might be going out of business send us your money no the people want

[43:08] what they're saying hey look we have our factory we have everything here these games are gonna be

[43:12] ready we put together now we're we're ready to go we need you know 200 grand to buy you know to

[43:19] get everything and with the point we can get a much better deal buying the parts if we get them

[43:23] buy them all and pay for them at once then do whatever and you know but we're ready to go on this

[43:28] thing yeah I think people would we keep their money in and and and do that but when they start

[43:32] hearing you know they can't get their refunds back where it's gonna be 60 days or they get no

[43:36] communication except when they want to it just it puts people a little bit at it ill it ease and

[43:42] when that happens you know people will start back and I it's it's there's a sweet spot in there

[43:48] to do all of this and all of a sudden people will be saying you know what I want to move my money

[43:53] and get something else or or you know hey I went to the game and I played the the uh

[43:58] tag from Mars remake or I played who deemed I really liked that game so I'm gonna move my money

[44:02] and that's their right you know to do that or Star Wars is gonna come out and say you don't want

[44:05] the hell would I could probably get Star Wars before I'm gonna get this game or what we know

[44:09] whatever the game is so you got to hit that sweet spot with people to you know to have them stay

[44:13] in because there's a lot there's a lot of stuff coming out now and you know when people are started

[44:18] to say they want the new thing they've been sitting on you're waiting for an alien are waiting for a big

[44:22] Lebowski for years and then all of a sudden now well you could have Star Wars in in two months

[44:28] I you know some people may want to jump what what did you what when when you saw that they

[44:34] changed their refund policy from 30 days to 60 days what kind of sign do you think that sends

[44:41] to people who have their money down well that's that's telling me they either they don't want to

[44:47] give the money back or they they need the money I mean why else would you do that there's only

[44:51] there's only a very few reasons why you would not want to give someone their refund uh you know

[44:56] within a couple of weeks right because either you don't want to or you can't uh I mean it's you

[45:02] don't just say off the top of your head oh I you know let's just wait two months to send

[45:07] it someone's money back right you know so I you know I hope it's you know not the case I hope

[45:12] everything is fine and you know again they have a factory they got uh you know they're they're

[45:16] building machines it just may be slower than you know then people think I mean I think it

[45:21] worse than that their biggest concern should be if all of a sudden star wars looks phenomenal and

[45:28] it's gonna be ready to go or the new Elvira game that they're saying is gonna look phenomenal and

[45:32] it's ready to go and or the next you know whatever if let's say that what's that game the spooky is

[45:36] doing next the house trooper in total annihilation toll annihilation if that comes out and every game

[45:42] spooky does they get better you know every game they add more they do more so they're they're ramping

[45:48] up just at the right pace for themselves they're selling out of wallet machines so every game will

[45:52] get better so if that game gets announced or gets shown something so there's a lot of there's a lot

[45:58] of stuff there too yeah I mean you you've just sort of rattled off the next eight months of games

[46:04] but the real clear and present danger for alien pre-order dollars is definitely star wars and

[46:11] that is because you know you're wearing the same sort of like sci-fi genre when the same sort of

[46:16] you know anniversary years for these franchises aliens got new movie coming out in May you know

[46:25] alien covenant star wars got a new movie coming out this year both both franchises yeah

[46:31] yeah watching watching Guardians of the Galaxy volume two both well that's another rumor title

[46:38] that's stern might make his guardians which honestly after watching that movie tonight has one of

[46:43] my favorite movies ever like I would buy a guardian's pin in a heartbeat yeah it's incredible I

[46:49] saw it i max 3d and if you guys haven't seen guardians to just go see it I think it's one of the

[46:55] best Marvel movies ever and it's fun I mean they really ramped up the comedy in it and and and

[47:02] kept it moving you know they did a nice job it was it was a good you know a good soft film and if

[47:08] you're gonna go watch it you stay till the very end because they have about three before time yeah

[47:13] like five different the stuff endings um but anyway so look to close the loop on alien then we'll

[47:20] go on to the rest stuff how long because Andrew said recently that Ellie's are gonna go out in

[47:26] significant numbers in June and July and I know they what do you what do you think you is this

[47:31] it like does he have to hit these dates or if he doesn't do you think he's gonna get another

[47:36] lifeline from people the well the first though you gotta realize yeah he will because

[47:42] alien is still alien and it's it's a it's a he will get he'll get a lifeline or a

[47:47] pick the like star wars there are people that would take alien over star wars any day I know I

[47:53] know though are you saying that he'll hit these dates or he'll get another lifeline if he goes past

[47:57] those dates uh well we're gonna find out because I I don't think there's any way those dates are

[48:03] there's too much to make your stuff going on what do you think is gonna happen Ted which one

[48:09] he's gonna hit him or he's gonna ask for more time uh I if he's talking about the next month or so

[48:16] you know and what are we in now made June I can't see this happening in 30 or 60 days right

[48:23] uh it just there's there's there's setting games that you just said there's setting games out

[48:27] without the Xeno head which is telling me that there's some kind of mechanical problem which

[48:30] means that they got to first they got to find them a mechanical problem then fix them a

[48:33] mechanical problem and then test the mechanical problem and you know put the games and send them out

[48:37] so I mean this is this is nothing that's gonna be happening in days or weeks I mean I think this is

[48:43] you know I mean when I read the the the the node on pin side to that said that they were significant

[48:48] changes you know or fixes or whatever the hell it was in there that didn't just say these were

[48:53] a couple little minor tweaks there was some major stuff going on which means you have to implement

[48:57] that and then you have to test it again I mean you have to test these machines I mean the first

[49:01] thing that happens is someone come out there and whack a ball that tongue comes out and it's tongue

[49:04] snaps off that's it they'll be someone who get linds right so they they got to work out all these

[49:10] problems so you know if people are in I think they just have to realize this is not gonna be like the

[49:15] one guy was very realistic he said hey I'd be thrilled if I got my game for Christmas yeah but when

[49:20] people say like yeah guys like that though gluttonies for punishment okay so highway like I

[49:27] don't think they hit those days I think we're gonna this this ship is gonna keep on taking water until

[49:34] he there gets a financial bailout like jack got or I don't see the ending very well for for

[49:40] people involved but so let's talk about and then just one last one last thing nobody should be

[49:45] unhappy I see that people get a little antsy when people start asking questions you know about

[49:50] these companies nobody should be annoyed that someone asked the questions I mean what's happened

[49:55] to us before when nobody asked any questions and and people were you know led through the ship and

[50:00] lied to I mean like you know the predator thing I mean I called up this guy myself and he just

[50:05] both face lied right to my face and told me yes put that on those things saying I've got the

[50:09] licensing just lied to me on it so I mean people are used to this kind of crazy shit so I don't think

[50:15] there's anything wrong with anybody questioning you know any of this stuff you know if they got

[50:20] nothing to hide then it should all be laid down the table but asking the questions I don't think

[50:24] there's anything anything wrong with that yeah anyway that's all I got totally great totally great

[50:30] okay so Star Wars was never announced on May 4th so here's the rumor that I'm hearing and this is

[50:36] what I was hearing at the show that AC DC Volt Edition is actually going to be announced before Star Wars

[50:44] it's going to have all new art package and the drummer from ACDCs not going to be anywhere on

[50:51] the game because he was arrested for I think like did he like murder somebody I don't know I think

[51:01] so do you think what do you want another ACDC type like what do you like do you think it's going to

[51:06] beat out come before Star Wars and that means we might not see a Star Wars announcement for maybe

[51:12] another month or two I didn't want to see the first ACDC so you're asking the wrong guy I mean I

[51:19] like metallic more than I like ACDC I don't mean the band I mean the games right I think what's

[51:25] happening with Star Wars is Stern just knows they're going to sell like a Zillian of them no

[51:30] matter when they announce it no matter when they ship it so they're they're probably playing a

[51:37] little bit of like bean counting over there in Chicago where are you if we let can we let

[51:44] Erasmith breathe a little longer if we absolutely absolutely I mean they'd be stupid to announce

[51:52] the games too soon before they're really selling you know the other ones sells as many as you can

[51:57] the Irish may they end a thing as Irish but this is a good game I mean the the games they have out

[52:03] now I mean you know minus if I mean I guess most of the problems you know whether it's the ghost

[52:08] thing or the play feels splitting or what the hell's going on you know most of these problems I

[52:13] guess they're going to be taken care of you know slowly but surely if they're not taken care of

[52:17] already so I mean these are all these are all fun games I mean so right well I think they've

[52:23] got the play field issues under control I think Star Wars we will see it within the next 30 to 60

[52:31] days so I'm I'm I'm done like speculating on it like I've been wrong so many times I don't

[52:38] even think to be honest I don't even think Stern knows exactly when they're going to announce it

[52:43] I I think there's a lot of back and forth between the accounting people and the marketing people so

[52:49] we'll see what happens now let's talk about Dutch Pimball because big Lebowski these guys

[52:57] bury in the op they seem to keep meeting with a Ra but they can never just get people their damn

[53:03] games like what do you think's going to happen there next and how fast do you think it's going to

[53:07] happen man if I if I had any kind of even an idea of what's going on there because you know I mean

[53:15] you have a company now that has lied to people so you know you have to really take it you know

[53:22] you you don't know what's going on I mean they say they're having the meetings I hope they go good

[53:26] I'm Lebowski is a fun game you know people are really enjoying the game people paid for their games

[53:32] people want their games their games are sitting there held hostage in a in a in a factory so I get it

[53:36] I would be incredibly pissed so I'm hoping that these that these talks go ahead um

[53:44] that it's the the reason that that guy the general manager whatever the hell it was got fired was

[53:49] because he was screwing around with something not just that he was trying to help them and and

[53:54] too much and got fired you know again somebody put that theory forward and it's you you never know

[53:59] but you know hey look there's no benefit to either side by having these games sit there you know

[54:05] because nobody's getting paid you got to start you know you got to keep a pinball company you know

[54:08] float by making money in there the company that they're building the stuff you know the money

[54:13] has got to change hands so so hopefully they'll they'll work it out and I think they will I mean

[54:18] because again it's to no one's best interest to have these games sit or for them both to throw a

[54:22] hissy fit so I think they're gonna I think they're gonna work something out yeah um I think that's

[54:29] his broke I do I think the money's dried up I can't imagine it being anything other than a money

[54:36] issue no maybe they're not and I know these guys listen to this podcast and they get mad at me but

[54:40] at the end of the day whatever the money whatever that bill is to get those 40 games released they

[54:46] just need to pay it even if it means you know they can't even know that then they can think

[54:52] it as for whatever the hell they want well you know why you can't really come out and say hey give me

[54:56] a figure I'm gonna pay it or okay or the alternative is you could just let your company go go

[55:01] out of business because everyone's lost faith in you and this shit show continues to drag on

[55:08] for almost a year like it's I think it's gonna be almost a year this summer since Lebowski's

[55:14] shipped I mean who who the hell is gonna buy Bob 3.0 from these guys after this shit show and

[55:22] also tangentially I like being able to use that word late at night on a Sunday why isn't

[55:29] why isn't Lebowski code being worked on in the meantime I don't think like what what is going on

[55:37] with these guys you know we really don't know enough to let me tell you what's going on Ted

[55:43] nothing is going on there's there's I just think the like look it takes money to do everything in

[55:50] pinball right it takes money to pay your manufacturer it takes money to pay your coder it takes money

[55:55] to pay artists it takes money money money money I've never seen anyone anyone be like you know what

[56:04] like we had we have we have plenty of money in the bank but we failed for other reasons when it comes

[56:09] to pinball it's always money yeah yeah I you know again you know we we don't know and I guess

[56:18] we're gonna we're gonna find out I'm surprised I'm surprised that rare hero hasn't like

[56:24] storm the a or a factory you know sort of like Navy SEAL style like I'm crashing through like the glass

[56:30] ceiling with repellent and snatches game and and get it out of there these some of these guys like

[56:37] it's so painful knowing that the game is done it's just sitting in a box in the Netherlands

[56:44] yeah yeah well you know what how you look it is what it is let's just hope let's just hope the game

[56:49] you know gets out there and and and that's it and and my big thing is I just want to

[56:54] find out what's happening with the with the elevator game that's the big news for me

[56:58] all right so you want to find out what's happening with that but we're not gonna that that game

[57:02] sounds like it's a few it's like a year at least the two years away maybe yeah maybe next year

[57:09] maybe next year um seeing it I'm hoping that they have somewhat an idea of what's going in there

[57:15] by now so I'm hoping that there'll be some kind of announcement so knowing that it's the crew that

[57:20] did scared stiff and and was it Elvira and the party monsters am I making that game operas that's

[57:25] the first game no no that's just that's right okay you you this game Ted it's like they're making

[57:30] this game for you like why don't you just put like eight grand aside and just I it's there it's

[57:37] there already I mean I taught well you know I interviewed Dennis on on from my website my pinball

[57:44] website thing so I had to I had a chance to chat with him for a while and very very nice guy but

[57:50] yeah no I those games are great like I said for me scared stiff is is gonna be one of the one of

[57:56] the top five and you know don't forget you know years ago when you looked at the the pinball

[58:02] database scared stiff wasn't even on the top 10 now it's like number five and it's well and we

[58:08] joke is Ted Ted pretty much sabotaged his his own ability to get one at a good price because he

[58:15] shielded this game all the way up until like a seven thousand dollar range now good job and now I

[58:20] can't get a better game because to get the good one that you know that comes from HEPR new in box

[58:25] like I just spent 10 or 15 grand yeah no well look we're we're we're not going to hear about that

[58:32] game for while what about what about Thunderbirds have you seen they they released some of the cabin

[58:38] artwork have you seen any that I just saw that stuff the cat artwork looks really really cool but

[58:43] I don't know anything about the game I haven't you know so I don't really I've never seen like a

[58:48] single I want for a planet to be done damn it oh with is that that's John Trudeau's for a good

[58:53] impion it yeah yeah so the game is looking really cool I'm hoping someone picks that game up I

[58:59] mean it'd be cool for Stern to do like a quirky game like that but I doubt we'll ever see that

[59:05] what what else is on your radar right now like what what what sort of threads are you jumping in and

[59:10] out of and sharing pictures of you eating oysters is there any is there anything yeah nothing I

[59:15] I just I just post a little bit on the yallentown thing because we were there and um

[59:21] you know some some of the other just you know a few of the other threads I mean alien I'm asking

[59:26] questions because like I said up until this show you know alien was on my short list you know of

[59:31] of pinballs to get that's why I really wanted to go see it down in the lintown so you know

[59:37] yep we didn't even talk about magic girl sold on eBay last night the eBay auction ended

[59:44] and the magic girl that Dave King was selling sold for little over $20,000 I think it was like

[59:53] $20,000 maybe wow 63 so here's here's a little funny thing that so I may or may not I did I

[01:00:05] we went out drinking Brendan and I came home and I may have put a few bids on that magic girl

[01:00:10] oh god and I go to bed being like well I might just have another magical I I I tell people I

[01:00:17] bid what I thought it was worth and I think I put in a bid of like a little over 20 but someone

[01:00:23] out bid me at the last minute for it um and I'll say this I think getting a magic girl 20k I think

[01:00:30] it's a goodbye I do and the reason yeah goodbye yeah the reason I do and it's and and I saw like

[01:00:37] Hilton was trying to be like Chris is an idiot he's he feels like he's an idiot because he

[01:00:42] he spent more than that look yeah when I bought magic girl for 23k I didn't know the game wouldn't

[01:00:49] be functioning okay so would I have liked to have had an absolutely no hassle no way no stress

[01:00:58] you know stressed out months trying to you know see if the game was even going to be made

[01:01:04] and and save $3,000 hell yes I would rather have gotten my magic girl under those conditions

[01:01:12] but I think it's a goodbye because like I don't think you're going to see magic girls ever go south

[01:01:16] of 20 I don't know if they're ever going to be fixed or not you know even lifting up the game

[01:01:21] when my light boards went out that might even make people nervous like knowing that my light

[01:01:27] boards went out that probably will happen to other people's games if there's a problem with the game

[01:01:34] and I think a lot of people are not going to play it I think a lot of people are going to either

[01:01:37] keep them in box or never play them for fear that stuff will go wrong with it but they'll end

[01:01:43] up in collector hands and then the supply will dry up I think this you're not going to see magic

[01:01:49] girls pop up very often I do think that um Justin Kelly's magic girl which is also an eBay

[01:01:56] head for a $40,000 buy it now price looks ridiculous for that price um knowing what one just went for

[01:02:05] is half the price so I think if Justin really wants to move his machine I think he needs to sort of

[01:02:12] cut that number in half um if he wants to move it um but he could just hold out you know we

[01:02:17] we still see like people trying to sell big bang bars new in box for 25,000 and if he doesn't need

[01:02:22] the money one day someone will will want it and look there's only one magic girl in new

[01:02:29] in box for sale right now and that's his like if you want one you got to pay the piper so we'll see

[01:02:36] what happens I'm not I don't think this game's going to be fixed anytime soon and here's an update

[01:02:42] um for people to the guy who code at the game uh Jim over in the UK he goes by what's his name on

[01:02:49] pinside it's like um I don't know isn't it like apple juice or something yeah yes I like that apple

[01:02:56] fruit juice fruit punch never with something like that so I posted it with some kind of average yeah

[01:03:01] it's apple juice I posted on the pinside for on the pin saw and that's not pinside the magic

[01:03:06] girl owners group on Facebook I was posting about my lightboard issue and he gave me some nice things

[01:03:12] to sort of check out um to sort of diagnose the problem none of which I'm gonna do because I'm

[01:03:18] gonna let the tech handle all that but after that he writes this is the last post you're ever

[01:03:23] gonna get from me in this thread I'm done with it have a good life everyone so yeah there goes

[01:03:30] our chances of ever having it finish the code um so you know there's that update um so yeah you

[01:03:39] know look high and well same to you as like shorts and anger said do not drink and bid oh my god

[01:03:47] well you know look it's out the combination of alcohol and pimple uh it's never good it's never

[01:03:56] good thing alcohol as some of my friends tell me Chris whenever you're drunk you just should not

[01:04:01] be near any any device you know like you shouldn't be near a device you definitely should be on

[01:04:08] eBay if an auction is ending um because you know how we are we men like when we get drunk with our

[01:04:15] egos and our money like we they those things can be easily parted um if we're not careful it's like

[01:04:21] it's like when I go to a casino I I've lost thousands of dollars I've lost almost the price of

[01:04:28] like a new inbox Pima machine in blackjack in five minutes you know it's like it's I wasn't sober

[01:04:37] when those things happened um that should happen so so we'll have to pick a time next to we'll do

[01:04:43] one of these podcasts from the porterhouse while having some cigars and steaks or something right

[01:04:48] so Ted it was great going to show you any any final thoughts on like what's been going on the hobby

[01:04:54] anything you want to cover that we haven't talked about on this podcast uh no I think uh I think

[01:04:59] that's it I think right now you know we're in a holding holding pattern to see what the uh the new

[01:05:04] machines are and to see what happens with these machines that are trying to get to trying to get

[01:05:09] uh you know so there's a lot of stuff going on it's going to be a very interesting you know

[01:05:13] next month or two because I have a feeling the big liposki thing will be settled the yelling

[01:05:18] thing will be settled the will will know by then what the new games are so there's a lot of real

[01:05:23] interesting information going to happen the next few months Ted I love you you the eternal

[01:05:28] optimist I I take a more contrarian standpoint I think it's going to be a really exciting year but

[01:05:35] I think Dutch and highway are going to really struggle to come out of this I I do um and I think

[01:05:43] I think that's going to hurt the hobby um but I also think there's a lot of exciting things coming

[01:05:49] out from companies that do have their shit together like I think American pinball is going to be

[01:05:54] successful with Houdini I think dialed in is going to be a big hit I think uh attack from our

[01:06:00] remake is going to be a big hit I think anything Stern puts out with the kinds of themes they're

[01:06:06] talking about are going to be big hits um you know so it's going to be you either got your shit

[01:06:13] together as a company or you don't and if you don't you're going to fail and I think they're

[01:06:17] going to fail faster than people realize in 2017 because to your point Ted there's a lot out there

[01:06:23] yeah there's a lot out there so let's let's let's yeah like I said I'm I'm keeping my finger

[01:06:27] scores that everybody gets what they want so now my closing sort of advice for everybody and

[01:06:32] and when Brendan and Brendan and I were leaving we were leaving Allentown and I took a zip card

[01:06:37] you know I took a Subaru wagon zip card to the show and I I felt like Hilton must feel when he

[01:06:42] drives around in his Subaru wagon you know it's like you know when you're driving a car that's got

[01:06:47] no balls you know you kind of all you can do is reflect because the driving experience doesn't

[01:06:52] doesn't do anything for you right so I'm driving this thing and we're talking about the show

[01:06:56] and we basically said wow there's a lot of really good pinball out there like how do you make up

[01:07:02] your mind on a game like it's hard you know because we didn't want to love Aerosmith and we like

[01:07:08] loved Aerosmith right it almost like was a more enjoyable experience than anything else we played

[01:07:14] at the show um and it's like eight thousand dollars seven thousand dollars ten thousand dollars

[01:07:19] like the price of these games it's really hard to say you know what like that's the one I

[01:07:26] really want to own right and I think our advice that we gave ourselves in the car which I

[01:07:33] gift everybody out there is I think this is the year to just wait just wait to see what comes out

[01:07:40] play everything and get yourself a pinball machine around Christmas time because there's just so much

[01:07:47] to play and it's all gonna be available that's the thing that always kills me is this fear of missing

[01:07:54] that drives people to like get every le get this get Batman sold out Ghostbusters sold out Star Wars sold

[01:08:01] out you'll be able to get one you'll be able to get one brand new by the end of the year and then

[01:08:10] you'll be able to choose from so many titles and the and you'll and look you'll you'll never lose

[01:08:15] your money because the game you go to get will be real it won't be some pre-ordered shenanigans

[01:08:22] it won't be some like delayed getting the Ellie because of fiber optic cable crap it the game

[01:08:29] will be out there in front of your face right oh hey there's wait that's always like I I would

[01:08:36] never be interested in pre-ordering a game that that that's just me I'm just I've learned my lesson

[01:08:42] and there's no game out there and again that I would you know put myself out for that where

[01:08:48] there would you be the chance I mean hey I did it with predator and I got lucky I got my money back

[01:08:54] but but that was it I learned my lesson and and I think everyone should games are ready they're ready

[01:09:01] I mean certain companies you know I mean spooky you you could try but anyway we've gone through

[01:09:05] this a million times the main thing is I will not buy a game until it is ready to go and that's

[01:09:10] that's just and that's that except forbidden planet he do forbidden planet I'm okay I'm you know

[01:09:17] honestly I forgot I forgot to mention this to you I've got the forbidden planet prototype in

[01:09:23] my apartment send your money now I swear I swear you'll get it in two weeks I'll ship it to you

[01:09:28] you probably would it's too we have a great night everyone Ted thank you for joining the show we'll

[01:09:35] do this again soon and again always a fun time hanging out with Ted have fun all right sure have fun

[01:09:42] everybody I know you're probably listening while you're driving that's the best time

[01:09:47] all right everyone don't swerve off the road see you later

[01:10:12] all right
