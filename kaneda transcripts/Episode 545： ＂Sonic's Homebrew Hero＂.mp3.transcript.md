[00:00] What's the one thing that's most important in Pimball?

[00:19] When you think about the one thing that's the genesis of creating a Pimball machine that's

[00:25] magical, that's special, that's meaningful, that will move you in some way.

[00:30] If I had to pick one word, I think the most important thing in this industry, the thing

[00:35] that this industry needs the most, it's passion.

[00:40] Passion is something that you can't just create out of thin air.

[00:43] Passion is something that doesn't come just because you throw money at a Pimball project.

[00:48] Passion doesn't develop because you want to take down every single Pimball company in

[00:52] Pimball.

[00:53] That's where passion comes from.

[00:55] Passion comes from the heart.

[00:56] It comes from the soul.

[00:58] I'm so happy that I got a chance to talk to someone about their passion in Pimball.

[01:04] Someone who wanted to make a Pimball machine around Sonic the Hedgehog and one did not

[01:09] exist.

[01:10] What did this man do?

[01:11] He just created it.

[01:13] He built it.

[01:14] In less than a year, he was able to go from a dream to a Sonic the Hedgehog Pimball machine

[01:19] that is super freaking awesome.

[01:22] When I look at this Pimball industry and you look at the games, you look at the designers

[01:26] that have built things because they were so passionate about the theme.

[01:30] That's what leads to games like the Big Lebowski.

[01:33] That's what leads to games like Guns and Roses with Jersey Jack.

[01:36] You don't think Slash and Eric have passion for that project?

[01:39] That's what led to Keith L. when breaking into Pimball.

[01:42] That's what led to Scott Denise breaking into Pimball.

[01:44] And the other thing that's just amazing about Ryan McQuade who made this Sonic Pimball machine

[01:49] is this.

[01:50] He didn't have millions of dollars.

[01:52] He didn't have years and years and years to tinker with the thing.

[01:54] He didn't have a contract.

[01:56] He didn't have a pedigree.

[01:57] He wasn't resting on his laurels because he made games in the 90s that were good and

[02:01] now he's taking years to make one decent game in the future.

[02:05] No, he simply built this game in his garage.

[02:09] And I'm telling you right now, how is it that a man can build a game in a garage that's

[02:13] got more fun stuff in it versus other designers who have taken so many years and so many millions

[02:19] of dollars and they still can't deliver stuff as cool as Sonic Pimball.

[02:23] Okay.

[02:24] So I'm really happy for you to hear this interview with Ryan McQuade and his Sonic machine.

[02:29] And I want every single manufacturer out there to listen to me right now.

[02:33] This is where the future of Pimball lies with talented men and women who are passionate

[02:39] about Pimball.

[02:40] And that's where the next great designers will come from.

[02:43] It's not going to come from these people that keep rehashing recycled ideas over and

[02:49] over and over again.

[02:51] Do I have to cough cough Led Zeppelin?

[02:52] It's okay.

[02:53] It's okay.

[02:54] I don't think anyone's looking at Led Zeppelin saying, wow, how did they do that?

[02:57] They must have been so passionate about Led Zeppelin to create that.

[03:01] Pim, no, it's not the same.

[03:02] And we need more games that are driven by passion and not just profit.

[03:07] We need dreamers and not accountants telling these designers what the bomb is.

[03:12] And I get it.

[03:13] We'll figure out how to make these games profitable.

[03:15] The games that are built with the most passion will bring the most profit.

[03:19] I firmly believe that.

[03:21] So let's air this interview with Ryan and I do think the home brew market, if you were

[03:25] to ask me, the home brew market is where the most exciting Pimball design is happening in

[03:30] the world.

[03:31] It is.

[03:32] And most of the companies that we know about a lot of them are just recycling ideas.

[03:36] The real innovation, the real dreamers.

[03:39] It's taking place in people's garages and in their basements.

[03:43] That's where the future of Pimball lies, everybody.

[03:46] Happy holidays.

[03:47] And I'm probably going to talk to you before Christmas, but if I don't, happy holidays

[03:51] and we'll talk to you soon.

[03:53] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to the show.

[03:55] We've never had someone out there who has a dream theme.

[03:58] Doesn't take no for an answer and goes off on a mission to make their dream theme a

[04:04] Pimball game.

[04:05] Ryan McQuade, who is making Sonic Spinball Pimball.

[04:08] Ryan, welcome to the show.

[04:10] Hey there.

[04:11] Now Ryan, you're some kind of crazy if you want to make your own home brew Pimball machine.

[04:15] What led you to create Sonic Pimball?

[04:18] I kind of always knew that I wanted it to exist.

[04:22] I was always mad that it didn't exist.

[04:24] I actually used to sit there on Facebook and tag Sega emusements and Stern at the same

[04:29] time and be like, all right, now kiss.

[04:31] I only recently seriously considered starting to build it myself when I attended a conference

[04:37] at the Fantastic Pimball show done by Mark Seaton, a good friend of mine who worked on his

[04:43] excellent Metroid Pimball game.

[04:46] And I just saw I saw all the awesome things he was doing and that like he had a bunch of

[04:51] incredible original ideas and he was just building it and nobody could tell him no and

[04:56] he just came so far and it was really awesome.

[04:58] And then he showed up into one of my parties with a piece of plywood and said, here you

[05:03] go get building because soon as we find out someone else is on the edge, we tend to push

[05:08] them over.

[05:09] Now he hands you plywood.

[05:11] What's your background that he would actually even think you'd be capable of this?

[05:15] So I'm going to steal a line from Adam Savage.

[05:19] I consider myself to be more of a generalist.

[05:22] I have a lot of dabbling and a lot of different areas of making and I'm not really an expert

[05:28] in any of them.

[05:29] I do 3D printing.

[05:30] I've done electronics hobbies my whole life.

[05:32] I've done a little bit of woodworking but nothing too serious.

[05:36] But I found this excellent community of people that are willing to help you fill in all

[05:40] of your gaps in any of specific skill you have.

[05:44] I feel like I gained the confidence to give it a shot after doing that.

[05:48] And where does one start?

[05:50] You get a piece of wood.

[05:51] You're looking at it.

[05:52] You want to make Sonic.

[05:53] What's the next step?

[05:54] All right.

[05:55] So actually in my journey, the piece of wood was like step 36.

[06:00] I started actually about a year before I started anything to do with Sonic.

[06:05] I grabbed the Visual Pinball 10 program.

[06:09] That is a free open source pinball simulator that's been around since the 90s.

[06:13] And I said, you know what?

[06:14] I'm going to teach myself to make to use this thing.

[06:16] I'm going to teach myself to make pinball on this platform.

[06:20] And so I made this little treat level simple style.

[06:23] Like what I would have done if I were a designer in the 80s and ramps weren't even popular

[06:27] yet.

[06:28] Just to keep it simple and teach myself how to use the tools.

[06:31] And so I ended up obsessing over it for entire weekend.

[06:34] And by the time I was done, I was like, this is actually kind of good.

[06:36] So I decided to learn how to code the rules and do a little bit of MS Paint art for it.

[06:42] And I ended up releasing it on the Visual Pinball forum just because I was like, this is

[06:46] kind of fun.

[06:47] It might not be a waste of somebody's time to play this for 20 minutes.

[06:50] But the entire goal of that project was to teach myself to use the tools so that maybe

[06:54] further on down the line, I could use that software to design Sonic and like then have

[07:01] a plan because I can't really, I'm not one of the guys that can just grab a piece of wood

[07:05] and start cutting.

[07:06] There's a lot of them out there though.

[07:07] That seems inefficient to do it that way, right?

[07:10] I thought so, but it works.

[07:12] It works for them.

[07:13] Some people, I keep saying guys, but like there are a lot of women doing this too.

[07:17] Wait, are there really a lot of women making maybe not a lot of them, but there are at

[07:22] least a few.

[07:23] Okay.

[07:24] And there should be more.

[07:25] So I don't want to discourage anybody.

[07:27] Absolutely.

[07:28] Especially in Pinball where gender means nothing.

[07:30] Yeah, a lot of people are very hands on and like maybe they've been doing woodworking and

[07:34] they have a shop.

[07:35] So like their first instinct is, all right, I'm going to grab a piece of wood, start

[07:38] cutting and see what happens.

[07:40] And like they get a bunch of parts and just start bolting things on and it sort of works

[07:44] or it doesn't.

[07:45] I have always been a very planned first or measure three times cut once kind of guy.

[07:50] So I figured if I could play with it enough in a simulator that'll either even be like

[07:55] 75% accurate, then I can be relatively sure that what I've come up with is worth building

[08:02] because I didn't want to have a design think, oh yeah, that'll be cool.

[08:06] Bend hundreds of hours building it and then go, oh, actually, this isn't fun at all.

[08:10] You and I both know there's tons of beautiful games out there that as soon as you're so

[08:15] excited to get to play them and then as soon as you touch the flipper buttons, you're

[08:17] like this is not nearly as good as it looks.

[08:20] Right.

[08:21] I got a question about that.

[08:22] So are you able to determine how fun a game is to shoot digitally?

[08:27] Because it feels like something that you'd want to feel.

[08:30] You absolutely do want to feel it, but you can get a start.

[08:32] You can definitely get a preview.

[08:34] Like it's better than just a flip of a coin.

[08:36] Like you'll end up playing digitally and you'll either be like, this is dumb or boring.

[08:41] Or sometimes you're like, actually, this is like I'm enjoying myself.

[08:44] So like I said in my video, when I finished my digital prototype, I was just, you know,

[08:50] just making it make a change, play it for a second, make a change, play it for a second.

[08:54] And then that last change without noticing it, I played it for like three hours, just

[08:58] flipping it around like, watch the ball go, hey, this feels good.

[09:03] And it didn't even have any rules.

[09:04] So I feel like once you have an idea that is fun without any rules, like, okay, now there's

[09:12] a better chance of me liking this in real life.

[09:14] Right.

[09:15] Because ultimately every pinball machine can be reduced down to the shots.

[09:19] Yeah, absolutely.

[09:21] I mean, rules can make or break a game.

[09:23] Like you can have a either boring or not even good layout with excellent rules and you can

[09:28] have a great game.

[09:29] Likewise, you can have an incredible layout with bad rules and ruin the game.

[09:34] But it is a tug of war.

[09:35] It is a tug of war, right?

[09:36] I've seen games like Tails, the Arabian Knights, which shoots so beautifully well.

[09:41] And why do people sell it, right?

[09:43] Because they run out of code quickly in it.

[09:45] And then you've got games like Walking Dead, which might be a clunker, but the rules are

[09:50] so amazing.

[09:51] It keeps people engaged.

[09:53] Yeah.

[09:54] Honestly, I'd never found Walking Dead to be particularly clunky, but I can totally see

[09:57] where other people would.

[09:58] My biggest problem with that game is I don't like any game that makes you plunge in a pop

[10:02] bumpers, but that's not the point.

[10:04] So getting back to Sonic, so you played it for three hours, you were enjoying it.

[10:08] And at what moment did you say, okay, computer off, I'm ready to start building this thing

[10:14] physically.

[10:15] So actually, it was last Christmas.

[10:16] I am typically a person who has a lot of difficulty filling out a Christmas list because

[10:22] I just, I have the tools I need and I don't need a lot of stuff.

[10:26] So people are always like, put something on your Christmas list.

[10:28] I don't want anything.

[10:29] I don't need anything.

[10:30] I don't know, I'm a sock.

[10:32] I'm like, I'm that guy.

[10:33] I'm boring to shop for.

[10:36] So it just happened to be around October, November when I finally completed the digital

[10:41] prototype.

[10:42] And I was like, you know what, the average like pinball mechanism in the home brew section

[10:46] on pinball life is like 20 to 80 bucks.

[10:49] So like, I'll just put all of these things on it individually, like kind of build material

[10:53] out my stuff on a Christmas list.

[10:55] First of all, I will have no excuse to put it off because it won't even be my money if

[10:58] I get the stuff for Christmas.

[11:00] And secondly, once I have all that stuff, I can't not build it.

[11:04] Was your family like Ryan's got on his wish list a three bank drop target and you're

[11:10] like, what's going on in his family?

[11:13] That is exactly what happened.

[11:15] And I didn't get a single pinball mechanism for Christmas.

[11:18] I got gift cards.

[11:19] Yeah.

[11:20] Which worked just fine.

[11:21] I spent them on Christmas morning, $600 order went into pinball life and another couple

[11:27] hundred into Marco.

[11:29] Then it all shook up and I was in.

[11:31] And you bring up a good point because with people going on the home brew journey, there's

[11:34] so many mechanisms that have already been engineered, right?

[11:38] So it's not out of the realm of possibility to make a game with a lot of mex and toys that

[11:43] have just already been developed.

[11:45] That's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

[11:47] There's actually a lot that I keep seeing people do new things with old, old pieces.

[11:52] There's infinite ways you can put these puzzle pieces together.

[11:56] And as long as you have the mindfulness to like test what you're doing, you can't really

[12:00] screw it up.

[12:01] For example, in my old solid state game, I put a drop target in the out lane.

[12:06] And like I've never seen that done before, but it worked for me.

[12:09] And like it's still all, it's parts everybody's used before.

[12:12] It's just a single drop target.

[12:13] It's a one way gate and it's an out lane.

[12:15] Like people have done things like it, but never just like that.

[12:17] And I was like, will this work?

[12:19] You can do all kinds of stuff that no one's ever done before.

[12:21] I agree.

[12:22] I'm still shocked.

[12:23] There's not more creativity like that.

[12:25] And then when I look at the shooting star out lanes and toad in, you know, Denise is

[12:28] using drop targets as ball locks.

[12:30] There's just seems to be more ability to use some of these parts in unique ways that

[12:35] sort of reimagines them all over again.

[12:37] Do you think we should see more of that in modern pinball?

[12:40] Well, I'm that that's one of my main goals is I mean, yeah, for Sonic, I have a few custom

[12:45] mechanisms, which you can again, you can make a game with entirely off the shelf parts.

[12:50] But like if you if you want something specific, you can always make it yourself or have someone

[12:55] make it for you.

[12:56] So what are the custom parts in Sonic that you fabricated?

[13:00] So the custom parts I've fabricated for Sonic would be, you know, obviously the, they're

[13:04] still normal parts, but like you need to make your own ramps.

[13:07] Most likely no ramp from an existing game is going to fit your game perfectly.

[13:11] So you need to be able to like make the wire returns, make the ramps.

[13:14] I use a 3D printer for that.

[13:16] And then we have obviously the loop, which everybody's familiar with if you're familiar with

[13:21] Sonic at all.

[13:22] And then most recently, the spinning sign post I made myself.

[13:25] I love all three of these.

[13:26] I want to talk about each one of them.

[13:28] So the ramp, these 3D printed ramps are really cool.

[13:31] It looks a lot like the fat ramp in Avengers.

[13:34] Did yours come before that?

[13:36] Yes.

[13:37] Well, mine let me let me back up a little bit.

[13:40] Mine came before the Avengers one was revealed.

[13:43] Okay.

[13:44] I actually I actually like got a little, I got a little bit when when the Avengers one was

[13:51] dropped and we had both that pseudo loop and a fat ramp in the same game.

[13:55] I was like, hmm, maybe somebody should put me in the credits for this game, but no,

[13:59] I actually talked to Elwyn and he does his games a year in advance.

[14:05] Like they're designed a year before they even start working on him.

[14:08] So he designed that thing ages ago.

[14:09] And while we were talking about the fat ramp, another gentleman, I can't remember his

[14:13] name off the top of my head right now, popped into the thread and was like, yeah, we built

[14:16] one of those 20 years ago.

[14:18] We called it the pregnant ramp.

[14:20] And then it just devolved into a conversation of what we all called our fat ramps in development.

[14:25] Mine was the thick ramp being thicker like that.

[14:27] Does it help the ball maintain velocity as it's going around?

[14:31] So the fat ramp does a few things in my game.

[14:33] Number one, yes.

[14:34] If you're hitting it from the upper flipper, the curve of the left wall is like almost,

[14:40] it's almost just like a sideways loop and it keeps the ball going really fast and it never

[14:44] slows down.

[14:45] It's really delightful.

[14:46] But the fat portion of it is also the ramp can actually be hit by any flipper on the game.

[14:51] Like even it could even be backhanded.

[14:53] It doesn't look like it could be backhanded, but it can.

[14:56] And that's intentional.

[14:57] It's really hard from the left flipper.

[15:00] It's average from the right flipper and it's easier from the top right.

[15:03] That was the goal.

[15:04] I wanted you to be able to hit it from anywhere, but the difficulty is different.

[15:07] Gotcha.

[15:08] Now I'm watching this game and we're going to get to the other two elements because I think

[15:11] they're both awesome.

[15:12] But this game is all about speed and I'm watching this upper right flipper hit both in orbit

[15:18] up there and the ramp with such speed and velocity and it makes sense because it's Sonic.

[15:23] Ryan, I had a Rick and Morty and the upper flipper shot was really tight and it was really

[15:27] hard to nail it.

[15:28] Do you believe that games should have wider openings to make them more fun and fast

[15:34] and some of these games are getting way too difficult for people to enjoy?

[15:38] That's fun of seeing the ball loop around and around and around.

[15:41] I think it's a balance.

[15:42] I actually did get a chance to play Rick and Morty before the lockdown.

[15:46] I played it out bow and carons and I took an hour long trip out to a place in Colorado

[15:52] while we were out there for nationals.

[15:54] And I really liked the game and we actually went back the next day, like just drove another

[15:59] hour just to play it some more.

[16:01] I did like that shot a lot because it was really satisfying when you hit it because

[16:05] you know, difficult shots are rewarding when you nail one.

[16:09] Like you know it's tight and yet you somehow managed to get that ball to sail right through

[16:13] it without even touching a wall.

[16:14] You feel good about yourself.

[16:15] However, I think a game can't have all difficult shots.

[16:20] So I take a game like Houdini.

[16:22] They were very ambitious with the game Houdini and they ended up cramming a lot onto that

[16:27] play field.

[16:28] But I think they actually went to do a little too much.

[16:31] Every shot on that game is really tight, every single one of them.

[16:34] So someone who either isn't familiar with pinball or is a pinball player, but their strong

[16:40] suit isn't accuracy is not going to like that game as much because they're going to try

[16:45] and try and try and just hit posts and more posts and waddle and rattle.

[16:50] So like those players need something to shoot to.

[16:53] So you need to have a balance of some shot should be wide open and easy to hit and you

[16:59] know average reward.

[17:00] And then you have a couple shots on the game that are harder and that will be rewarding

[17:04] you for shooting accurately.

[17:07] I tried to do that a little bit with Sonic.

[17:09] So I wanted very deliberately.

[17:12] I wanted the shots you were just talking about, the repeating orbit and the ramp shot.

[17:16] I wanted those to be at least the orbit.

[17:18] I wanted to be as easy as possible.

[17:21] I am struggling.

[17:23] I'm cutting my play field up.

[17:25] I'm spending entire weekends moving things just a quarter an inch just to try to get that

[17:30] shots to be more open and easy for two reasons.

[17:33] Number one, it's really important.

[17:34] And I want new players and like less accurate players to be able to do it too.

[17:39] But also I like the phenomenon of a good player being able to obliterate easy things.

[17:46] Right.

[17:47] I want to see good players like like Bowen and Escher and everything.

[17:50] I want to see 10, 12, 15 combos from them.

[17:55] But I want the average person to be able to get a two or three as well.

[17:58] So that was the only problem I ever had with the inspirations for those shots, which

[18:03] is obviously a lot of Steve Richie stuff.

[18:06] We have the getaway and Black Knight 2000s upper loop were my favorites.

[18:11] They're both excellent looping shots, but they're just a little too hard for someone who's

[18:14] not like really accurate to get combos on.

[18:18] You end up with a four or five combo if you're good, but I wanted to take that and make

[18:22] that easier so we can have higher scores and more accessibility.

[18:26] And then I always wished that the ramp on Black Knight 2000 was a chainable thing or

[18:31] like that was a combo.

[18:32] Like I wanted to go around the loop three times and then nail the ramp for like a finishing

[18:37] combo kind of thing.

[18:38] And that just ended up working really well as soon as I did it on purpose.

[18:43] It's so rewarding to have these upper loop shots.

[18:46] And when we watch these streams, I mean Bowen's amazing, Elwin's amazing.

[18:50] And I think that's the trick is sometimes these guys who are so good, they're the ones

[18:54] giving the feedback or designing these games and it's almost like they're designed for

[18:59] players of that caliber.

[19:00] But I always say like make the game more approachable, make it harder with the code because

[19:05] you could easily say like look, you have to hit 10 combos to like unlock this.

[19:09] That's still going to be hard, right?

[19:11] But you make the shot too tight.

[19:13] Then it gets frustrating for players and especially if it's a pivotal shot in the game

[19:17] you need to make.

[19:18] Ryan, let's talk about the loop deloop because when we were covering hot wheels, I was like,

[19:21] this game has to have a loop deloop.

[19:23] How can you make hot wheels without a loop deloop?

[19:25] And I even think we heard from the AP people being like, you can't do it in a game because

[19:29] it's the space under the glass.

[19:32] And here you are proving them wrong.

[19:35] It looks super cool.

[19:36] Talk to us about the loop deloop.

[19:37] So that timing was actually a really weird coincidence.

[19:42] I had just released the video of my loop and like not a week later, the American pinball

[19:49] guys released all of their play field shots and their streams and everything like that.

[19:53] And so I had no idea that they were going to be catching flak for not having a loop

[19:57] and then here I was in my basement doing it.

[19:59] Bad timing for them.

[20:00] Great timing for them.

[20:01] Great timing for me.

[20:03] But I did listen to an interview from one of their designers and they did do a lot of

[20:08] R&D on the loop.

[20:09] They didn't just dismiss the idea as not being able to do it.

[20:13] One of their designers actually spent quite a bit of time trying to do it.

[20:16] And what they did was they decided that if you couldn't shoot it directly like a normal

[20:21] ramp like that Avengers premium ramp, then they didn't feel it was worth doing.

[20:26] Do you buy that?

[20:27] Do you buy that?

[20:28] No, not at all.

[20:29] That's why my play field has is the way it is.

[20:31] I think that pinball originally and always has been about physics and about how amazing

[20:38] physics and science can be.

[20:40] So a person seeing a ball go around a thing like that.

[20:45] Like sure it feels good to shoot it as a player.

[20:47] But like I'm picturing myself as a little five year old kid who's approached this game.

[20:52] And when I was a kid, I was always like amazed by like the ball, the big ball sculptures

[20:57] at the museum of science and just pinball machines and stuff and all the cool things that

[21:01] they could just make a ball do.

[21:03] And my least favorite games when I was a kid were the ones where the toy, the like the

[21:09] thing that I could watch the ball do was hard to do.

[21:13] So if I want to, if I drop my quarter in, all I would want to do is see that sweet crane

[21:18] on like demo man or whatever do something.

[21:21] I just want to see it happen because it's awesome.

[21:23] So I don't care if you can shoot it directly.

[21:27] If your answer is if we can't shoot it directly, we shouldn't have it because that's just

[21:30] not true.

[21:31] It's worth doing.

[21:33] So I mean, I mean, everybody hates the catapult from medieval madness, which was like

[21:38] my ticket to getting this thing to work.

[21:40] And you can't even really see the catapult arm.

[21:43] I had to like really look at that mechanism to see, oh my God, it really is a catapult.

[21:48] It's not just a kicker, but like it's still fun.

[21:51] That's how I feel about the hyper drive in Star Wars, right?

[21:54] It's like this cool thing.

[21:55] You walk up to this game and you see this amazing like big structure going around the whole

[22:00] machine and you can't load it.

[22:02] It's too hard to get the ball in there for most people.

[22:04] The majority of people, especially a casual player.

[22:07] We'll never see that ever work.

[22:10] And that's not fair.

[22:11] It's just not fair.

[22:12] I'm a six, like I'm a little kid and I'm amazed with the world.

[22:16] I'm amazed with physics and amazed with science.

[22:19] And I can't just watch the thing happen.

[22:22] And that's all I want to do.

[22:23] I don't care what my score is.

[22:24] Right.

[22:25] Like look what that cool ball is doing.

[22:27] So when I saw the hyper loop, I actually owned a Star Wars pro for a little while.

[22:31] And I was really sad I didn't have the hyper loop, but I thought it was super drive.

[22:35] Hyper drive.

[22:36] Hyper drive.

[22:37] I was always a start track guy.

[22:39] Don't kill me for that.

[22:41] But I thought it was amazing because I've always been a fan of the getaway supercharger

[22:45] too.

[22:46] A lot of people are like, oh, it's pointless.

[22:47] It just throws the ball around and you don't do anything.

[22:49] Yeah, but it's awesome.

[22:50] Just watch it.

[22:51] Make sweet sounds.

[22:52] It goes around a thousand miles an hour.

[22:55] Get three balls into a supercharger on the getaway and tell me it's not amazing.

[22:59] Usually like the majority of pinball players want to see the ball do fun stuff.

[23:02] I really do think it's the tournament players and the people who want skill to activate

[23:07] everything that have driven too much of this decision making in the pinball world.

[23:11] I really do because then it's not skill based.

[23:14] It's more about entertainment based and I always err on the side of these are toys.

[23:20] Like don't forget that people.

[23:21] These are totally called it's boy.

[23:23] Exactly.

[23:24] So, okay.

[23:25] So we got the cool loop deloop.

[23:26] We've got the cool ramp and then you added this really neat ramp spinner on the right

[23:31] side that spins between Dr. Robotnik and Sonic.

[23:35] I love the way it spins.

[23:36] It feels just like the way it looked inside the old 90s games.

[23:39] Talk to us about that spinner.

[23:41] So that spinner was always in the plan.

[23:43] Like I always knew it was going to be there.

[23:45] I always knew what it was going to be.

[23:47] It's actually in the digital prototype just as a regular spinner because you can't make

[23:51] horizontal spinners in that game.

[23:53] Not without a lot of work that I didn't need to do.

[23:56] Placeholders are your friend if you're designing by the way.

[23:58] I was having a conversation with someone who's enthusiastic about the project.

[24:03] They were just talking about the spinner and it got me kind of energized to give it a

[24:07] shot.

[24:08] And I kind of just got everything to work on the first try.

[24:11] What really I'm excited about and I really wish the freaking shipping companies would get

[24:16] me my Marco parts so I could finish this thing off.

[24:20] This is going to be what I think is my first like truly I'm the first one who ever did

[24:24] this.

[24:26] A lot of people think my loop to loop is totally unique and no one's ever done it in pin

[24:30] ball before but that's just not true because we have gold wings has a loop to loop that

[24:34] you actually shoot.

[24:36] It's small far away from your eyes and they did not design the ramp particularly well so

[24:40] you can't really see the ball go around it but it's there.

[24:43] It's been done.

[24:44] And of course people have done ramp spinners and they've done horizontal spinners but

[24:50] my spinner is going to be mounted on a solenoid post.

[24:54] So picture like a lot of posts and games that will just disappear and like go flush

[24:58] with the play field.

[25:00] My spinner is going to sit too high for the ball to interact with until the sign post

[25:05] is lit and then it will pull down and therefore be engageable.

[25:09] So I to my knowledge and I really hope I'm not wrong about this.

[25:12] No one has ever put a spinner on a solenoid before no one's ever had a moving spinner.

[25:17] So I'm really excited for that.

[25:19] It's not there yet because I'm waiting for parts from Marco.

[25:21] You got a trademark at Ryan and then sue everybody who does it afterwards.

[25:24] No, I thought about that.

[25:26] I'm like, all right, I'm going to patent this and then you're not going to have, you're

[25:30] not going to get sued if you use it.

[25:31] You're going to have to hire me.

[25:32] Right.

[25:33] You some royalties.

[25:34] How close are you to finishing the game?

[25:36] I'm seeing the cabinet artwork go up like, what's your ETA on this thing's done?

[25:40] All right.

[25:41] So I always tend to overestimate how long it's going to take me to do these things because

[25:45] I'm a hyperfocusser.

[25:47] I would say I'm where I thought I would be after like two and a half years and it's

[25:50] only been one year.

[25:51] I've been working on this game for a single year.

[25:53] I'm not going to be one of those people who was like, all right, whitewood's done, game's

[25:57] done.

[25:58] There's going to be art.

[25:59] There's going to be like, there's a lot more work to be done.

[26:02] Everything needs to be finalized.

[26:04] We need to do a whole CAD drawing, a whole new play field has to get cut.

[26:07] The whole thing needs to be rebuilt and then I'll probably have to do it again, you know,

[26:12] because as soon as you start moving things, it's not final and you can't really start

[26:16] your art or at least it's rude to start your art and then change the canvas on your

[26:20] artist.

[26:21] That's not nice.

[26:22] Don't tell that to John Papaduke.

[26:23] He starts with the art.

[26:25] Oh, man, I can't only imagine what that's like.

[26:28] The whitewood is getting there.

[26:30] The whitewood I'd say is around, you know, 80% done.

[26:33] All the shots are getting dialed in and I'm starting to add toys.

[26:36] So once you're starting to add toys, you're like, your base, your base is there.

[26:41] My code is a lot further along than I thought it would be because I started my code well

[26:44] before I started actually building it.

[26:47] So my code is around 75% feature complete.

[26:51] Like I have most of my stuff already in there, including like a bunch of the graphics.

[26:56] It's really cool code and I was watching some of the animations.

[26:59] How are you coding this and where are you pulling your animations from?

[27:04] So the whole, most of the game is coded in the mission pinball framework and the config

[27:11] files that they have invented there.

[27:13] So mission pinball runs on Python, but you don't have to know Python to program.

[27:17] It they have their own config file, their own YAML language or whatever.

[27:21] And once you get a little familiar with it, it's got most of the like underlying stuff

[27:25] for pinball specifically already done.

[27:28] So you don't have to program what an extra ball is and how it works.

[27:32] They have that done in the engine for you.

[27:34] So you just have to say, all right, extra ball.

[27:36] This is the conditions.

[27:37] This is how many times you can get it.

[27:39] Like a lot of the underlying works already done for you.

[27:41] So it's very, the whole point of it was to be approachable.

[27:44] Right.

[27:45] And they did a really good job.

[27:46] You can get a game flipping with mission pinball in like a day.

[27:49] Wow.

[27:50] Awesome.

[27:51] It I mean, to get a full game fleshed out with rules, it's going to take you months, but you

[27:56] can get it working easy.

[27:58] The animations are almost actually they are.

[28:01] They are entirely first party.

[28:03] They're all made by Sega.

[28:04] They're all in official games.

[28:06] I have not used any fan art that I do not have permission to do so because I don't think

[28:10] that's fair to the artists.

[28:12] But I'm lucky in that I'm doing a video game title.

[28:15] So a lot of the assets and the animations are already done for me.

[28:19] I just need to convert them to like formats that I that I want.

[28:22] And for anything that is more complicated that doesn't already exist, I'm using Adobe

[28:27] After Effects.

[28:28] Okay.

[28:29] It's super cool.

[28:30] I have to say Ryan, when I'm watching these animations, it just brings back such a nostalgic

[28:34] feeling to watching old school.

[28:36] Like is it 16 bits Sonic you're using or eight bit?

[28:39] It is 16.

[28:40] Although mostly I'm using a lot of Sonic Mania sprites which are upscaled 16 bit.

[28:45] Looks amazing.

[28:46] I mean, it really is and it's perfect for the size of a pinball screen.

[28:49] You know, Sonic, the world's fastest blue hedgehog moving from left to right with super speed.

[28:54] So Ryan, let me ask you a question.

[28:56] When this thing is done, where does it go?

[28:58] Does it you toured around at the different shows?

[29:01] It lives in your house permanently.

[29:02] Would you ever make another one for a diehard fan?

[29:04] I know you probably can't say that legally, but would you?

[29:07] So yeah, it lives in my collection permanently because I did this project because I wanted

[29:12] this game and it didn't exist.

[29:13] I'm a diehard Sonic fan.

[29:15] I have been since I was a little kid.

[29:17] I wanted a Sonic pinball machine.

[29:19] It didn't exist.

[29:20] So this is my way to get one.

[29:21] I'm going to be touring it to any show I can because I want to share it with everybody.

[29:25] I want everyone to see what it is.

[29:27] And it's at this point kind of become my physical resume.

[29:31] A lot of that's been talked about in the past.

[29:33] You want to get people interested, show them what you can do.

[29:36] So would you like to design pinball for a manufacturer one day?

[29:40] I would love to.

[29:41] Okay.

[29:42] I want to try doing it as part of a team.

[29:45] I think it would be incredible because I love having full creative control and doing whatever

[29:50] I want, but I would also love to have like an expert coder instead of just me who's a

[29:54] dabbler.

[29:55] Like what could my games be like if I had experts on a team on my side instead of just

[29:59] doing everything myself?

[30:01] Well, Ryan, I got to tell you this.

[30:03] One year in and year this far along.

[30:06] It's incredible because we've seen some of the world's most famous designers from yesterday's

[30:10] take five, seven, eight years and they can't get this far.

[30:15] So this is incredible.

[30:16] Well, we should probably not tell them that I already have my next game designed, huh?

[30:20] We won't.

[30:21] Now, let me ask you a question because in the world of homebrew, there are manufacturers

[30:25] out there.

[30:26] American pinball comes to mind, deep root comes to mind who have said, bring us your

[30:30] homebrew game and we will explore bringing this game to market.

[30:34] Have you ever thought about showing this to a company like American pinball and saying,

[30:38] hey, guys, let's go get the license.

[30:40] The rest is done.

[30:41] So I've actually been subtly poking American pinball on that for a while.

[30:47] Their marketing guy Mike is a friend of mine and I like to poke him on Facebook and

[30:50] every time someone says, American pinball grab this guy.

[30:53] It's tag him as a joke.

[30:54] I actually didn't know that American had any kind of program for homebrew.

[30:57] I'm familiar with the more recent deep root post.

[31:00] I have opinions on that, but not anything really strong.

[31:03] I think it's very interesting what deep root has proposed with their homebrew program.

[31:09] Let's talk about what AP's response has been and then let's talk about the deep root

[31:13] model because I am curious to see what your thoughts are on deep roots model.

[31:16] But what is AP said to you as you poke them?

[31:19] They haven't said a lot about Sonic specifically.

[31:21] I feel like they really kind of can't unless they were going to commit to something.

[31:26] They have been interested in working with me on a different project that I am trying

[31:30] to work on for them.

[31:31] It has to do with hot wheels, but nothing about Sonic so far other than we'll see who's

[31:37] eyes we can get on it.

[31:38] So I'm still in, you know, get everyone's eyes on the project mode and then someone will

[31:42] have to notice me.

[31:43] Look, I'm just going to say it for people who listen to this show that I think Sonic

[31:47] is a great theme for pinball.

[31:49] AP, listen to me and I know you listen to the show.

[31:53] Grab this.

[31:54] It's better than October Fest.

[31:55] It's better than Houdini.

[31:57] And I think you could easily find at least 500 buyers if not more to buy Sonic the Hedgehog

[32:02] pinball.

[32:03] Well, if you want to market to them, maybe don't say it's better than their existing

[32:06] games.

[32:07] No, but all I do is rag on October Fest.

[32:09] If I stopped ragging on October Fest, people would be like, who kidnapped Canada?

[32:13] Let's talk about deep root because they're talking about how they also want to help the

[32:18] homebrew community get their games to market.

[32:21] Let me read you the steps, Ryan, that they are saying is how they can bring homebrew to

[32:25] market.

[32:26] I'm going to get your thoughts on each of these.

[32:28] So step one, if you have a completed whitewood or your homebrew game and a minimum of 25

[32:34] buyers willing to commit to purchasing, you can apply for the reserve program.

[32:40] What do you think about that?

[32:42] I think having a minimum of 25 buyers willing to commit is a, I think that's an important

[32:48] step.

[32:49] I don't think it really belongs in step one.

[32:51] Step one should be, if you have a mostly completed whitewood because a whitewood is never

[32:56] done by definition and at least a few people interested, they're saying they'll consider

[33:02] it.

[33:03] 25 buyers should be part of step two or step three of whether or not they decide to make

[33:07] it.

[33:08] Also, how would you show that to them?

[33:10] I've got 25 deposits.

[33:12] If those go away, they could go away.

[33:14] So what are you going to do?

[33:15] Collect letters of recommendation.

[33:16] I would buy this.

[33:17] They want me to screenshot all the people on Facebook that keep saying, shut up and

[33:22] take my money because I have a lot of those.

[33:24] Right.

[33:25] No, absolutely.

[33:26] Well, they do say complete whitewood.

[33:28] So that should probably just be step one, like make a game for us.

[33:31] So step two, submit a pitch deck to us, which must feature at a minimum images, videos,

[33:40] narratives, proposed rule sets, sound and graphics, highlighting the home brew concept,

[33:46] and game design, and be in substantially complete form.

[33:50] We will work with you to assess development, difficulty, and cost.

[33:53] That's a lot of step two there.

[33:55] What do you think of that?

[33:56] I like it, actually.

[33:58] Like because again, there's a lot of home brew projects out there that are like not very

[34:02] far along.

[34:03] They like they have people working on them in their spare time, but it's not their job.

[34:06] And some alum people don't have the luxury of a lot of time.

[34:09] So what they're saying is you need to be serious.

[34:12] Like you need to be far enough along that you have something to pitch.

[34:16] You can't just come to them and say, hey, wouldn't a sonic pin be cool?

[34:20] Like you have to have ideas.

[34:22] You have to be able to show that you can execute those ideas.

[34:25] I think it's perfectly reasonable to have all those requirements and say, like you need

[34:31] to be able to work with us, you need to be capable.

[34:35] The last bit is a little confusing.

[34:37] We'll be able to assess development, difficulty, and cost.

[34:41] Does that mean they're going to charge me?

[34:43] Yeah.

[34:44] I'm a little confused by that.

[34:45] And I would like to see that sentence a little more fleshed out.

[34:49] As I read these steps, part of me when I saw the deep root PowerPoint of all the titles

[34:53] they're thinking of making, I'm like, man, they should have put themselves through their

[34:57] own requirements because I'm not sure some of those would get 25 buyers immediately lined

[35:02] up just on theme alone, but I digress.

[35:05] So step three, if we approve the Homebrew project, we will announce the run of the reserve

[35:12] homebrew game, including the purchase price, time to delivery, and how many units are

[35:17] available.

[35:18] Now, this is where it gets interesting that they start to get into some of the pricing.

[35:23] Purchasers will commit with a 5% refundable deposit in order to be successful.

[35:30] Deposits must total at least 60% of the reserve run.

[35:34] If the run max is out, then the run will be increased.

[35:38] If the run fails to meet the threshold, then all deposits will be refunded and the project

[35:42] will be shelved.

[35:43] All right.

[35:44] I'm somewhat confused.

[35:45] I just read a lot of stuff.

[35:46] Basically saying you have to get enough money in deposit form, which must equal 60% of

[35:51] the cost of the game.

[35:53] Is that what they're saying?

[35:54] So right here is we're seeing the actual application of that thing we were questioning

[35:59] in step one.

[36:00] They're like, you need to have people actually put up with a little bit of money to prove

[36:05] that they'd buy this game.

[36:06] I think the deposit is ridiculously reasonable.

[36:10] 5% refundable.

[36:11] That's the smallest deposit I've ever heard of any kind of project like this.

[36:15] You got a lot of other manufacturers will be like, we need 50% payment ahead of time

[36:22] and before we even start building it.

[36:23] That's how you have people running it, ending up paying money and not getting their games.

[36:28] The 60% is the number of people who have committed.

[36:31] Yeah.

[36:32] So if they set the reserve, meaning the minimum number of games they're willing to make,

[36:39] they're saying they need names with 5% deposits for 60% of that number.

[36:44] If they're going to make 100 games minimum, they need 60 pre-orders with a 5% deposit

[36:50] for the whole thing is getting shut down.

[36:51] But here's what makes no sense, right?

[36:52] They're not even going by this with Raza, which are non-refundable deposits.

[36:56] If all those are refundable, everyone can just bail once the project is going.

[37:01] Well, it seems like they decide when it's refundable.

[37:04] Like they say, it sounds like they're saying if it's kind of like a Kickstarter model,

[37:08] if they don't make the numbers they need to make the game, they're just going to give

[37:12] everyone their money back.

[37:13] They're not going to start making that make sense.

[37:15] So it seems like a protection against accidentally creating a project that bombs so no one

[37:20] gets their game.

[37:21] So let's say hypothetically, let's just say hypothetically we've got 100 sonics we want

[37:26] to make.

[37:27] We need 60%.

[37:28] We need 60 people to do a 5% refundable deposit.

[37:31] Let's just say hypothetically, Ryan, sonics, 10 grand.

[37:33] I'm trying to make it easy to figure these numbers out.

[37:36] 5% of 10 grand is what?

[37:39] 500 bucks?

[37:40] Yep.

[37:41] So that would be enough to make three games.

[37:47] That doesn't feel like enough.

[37:48] Well, again, that's their bare minimum.

[37:50] Right, but they'll start going into production at that point.

[37:54] That is interesting.

[37:55] I don't know.

[37:56] Doesn't that seem really low?

[37:58] It does seem a bit low, but we don't even know that the reserves will be that high.

[38:03] That reserves might be like 25 games like they said before.

[38:06] Here's it's crazy.

[38:07] If you bring that 60 buyers down, it brings the money even down.

[38:11] We're talking a $10,000 game.

[38:13] If we lower that, you start to see it.

[38:15] I don't know how this is even enough money.

[38:18] Let's go to step four, because this is the other part that's really interesting when

[38:21] you think about bomb and profit and making it worthwhile for people to spend the time

[38:26] and effort.

[38:27] As the homebrew designer, you will receive royalties in the form of a percentage of the sales price

[38:34] of each.

[38:35] Reserve homebrew game sold between 10 and 20% of the sales price of the game.

[38:40] Is that enough of an incentive?

[38:42] 10 to 20%?

[38:43] Then is there enough money for Deeproot to actually make this feasible on their end?

[38:47] I got a couple of opinions about those numbers.

[38:50] Number one, we need more details there.

[38:52] Are you talking 10 to 20% of the profit of that game?

[38:56] That's completely unreasonable.

[38:58] Are you talking 10 to 20% of the sales price, as they say, like a game cost $10,000.

[39:04] I'm making $1,000 to $2,000 per game sold.

[39:07] That's excellent.

[39:08] It says sales price of each.

[39:10] Yeah, it says that, but it seems a little too good to be true.

[39:14] I would want to read the fine print there, but I like the idea that you're going to get

[39:19] paid for your work.

[39:20] They're not just going to take all the money and run with it.

[39:24] You're the designer.

[39:25] You're the one who made the game and you should indeed profit from it.

[39:29] I do want to know how they're going to deal with licensing, though, because almost every

[39:33] homebrew, so few homebrews have original non-licensed themes.

[39:40] So many people who are making homebrew are like, I want this theme to exist and it doesn't,

[39:45] so I'm doing it.

[39:46] Absolutely.

[39:47] If you're going to be able to play without having to ask permission, why wouldn't you

[39:51] just go make the game that you really want?

[39:53] Yeah, exactly.

[39:55] If I have to ask permission and we have to get the game licensed and that costs money,

[39:59] I could see them saying the price of the license is coming out of your 20%.

[40:04] That's what American Pimball's homebrew model was.

[40:07] Thinking back, but I think their model was more along the lines of, I think it was $250,000

[40:13] is the price by which will help you get your game to market with the licensing.

[40:19] They were aiming higher because it's going to take more money than 30 grand to start

[40:25] getting a Pimball game off the ground.

[40:27] Okay, because if you sell Sonic, let's just do the math here.

[40:30] Let's say we sell 100 at 10,000 each.

[40:33] Not out of the realm of possibility, your game is packed with toys.

[40:36] That's a million bucks, right?

[40:38] Now, remove the licensing fee with Sega, factor in the bomb, factor in all the stuff.

[40:43] There might still be a few hundred thousand dollars for you, Ryan, at the end of this

[40:47] journey if AP could make that.

[40:49] And I think that's what they're going for is, is it worth it to go pay for this license

[40:54] and pay per game made and see what the bomb is.

[40:57] It's big numbers, but there's big numbers to make if you can sell the game.

[41:02] The question becomes this because I think what Deeproot is saying here, and this is not

[41:06] just Deeproot, but anyone who's going to make a limited run, is it even feasible only to

[41:10] make 25 and ever make any money unless you're charging a ton because to order only 25

[41:17] parts makes everything super expensive to do.

[41:21] And that's the reason that Stern has been able to keep their prices down up until recently

[41:25] is they've been buying in bulk.

[41:28] Whereas you have spooky and they have to put out, I think total nuclear annihilation cost

[41:33] almost $6,000 when it came out.

[41:35] And it's an excellent game and I love mine and it's never going anywhere.

[41:40] But the BOM is not very impressive.

[41:43] It's a street level game.

[41:45] It doesn't have a lot going on as far as toys.

[41:47] But I feel like if Stern made that game, they could have made it for a lot cheaper.

[41:51] Yeah, absolutely.

[41:52] So Ryan, let me ask you a question.

[41:53] So I could snap my fingers and place you at any pinball company.

[41:57] Who would you want to work for?

[42:00] Who would I want to work for?

[42:02] So, based on fit, I would probably my first choices would be spooky or American.

[42:11] I like the people.

[42:12] I like what they're doing and I think I could bring a lot to those tables.

[42:19] For obviously for stability, you got Stern.

[42:21] They're never going anywhere.

[42:23] But I don't know if what I'm trying to do and what I'm trying to bring to the table

[42:28] would work with them.

[42:30] I would still try it.

[42:31] I'd be curious to see because I don't know their inside process.

[42:36] I feel like it would be like working for a large company versus a small one.

[42:40] And I recently did that in my professional career where I moved from a huge company to

[42:44] a much smaller one and my quality of life has dramatically increased.

[42:48] American pinball could use another designer.

[42:50] I mean, it's just Joe Balser and it would be nice to have someone new with some fresh

[42:55] ideas in the mix there.

[42:57] Just as a guy who loves toys and designing things, I'm really curious why you didn't say

[43:01] Jersey Jack pinball as a designer.

[43:05] That's a really good question.

[43:07] I think you got me there.

[43:08] I think Jersey Jack would be awesome.

[43:10] Because you're right.

[43:11] They're huge on toys.

[43:12] They love like they don't skimp on anything like that.

[43:15] My other problem going into this is I'm also a competitive pinball player, which at some

[43:19] point is an advantage, but it's also a disadvantage in others.

[43:23] Like I am the New Hampshire State Champion two times.

[43:25] I'm the New England pinball league two times champion right now.

[43:29] But I still am able to maintain the amazement that a basic toy can bring regardless of the

[43:35] score and victories it can bring me.

[43:37] So yeah, I guess you're right.

[43:38] Jersey Jack would be an excellent fit.

[43:40] I don't really think of them because in competitive space, I just can't wrap my head around

[43:44] their scoring.

[43:46] So I guess if I were to work on a Jersey Jack game, I would have to insist that their scoring

[43:49] makes sense to me before I put my name on it.

[43:52] But you know, I look at Jersey Jack as the company that gives their designers the highest

[43:56] bomb and the designers probably hear no fewer amount of times.

[44:02] I think at Stern, the designers are held back a little bit by the bomb and Stern's got

[44:07] their approach.

[44:08] I am not one to tell them it doesn't work because it does work and they keep the company

[44:12] profitable and going.

[44:13] I think American pinball definitely needs somebody new.

[44:17] I think they need new talent.

[44:19] I think they need new ideas.

[44:20] I think they need creative leadership and your ability to take this sonic theme and create

[44:25] this in one year's time.

[44:27] If I'm American pinball and it's Mike, right, the new, what is he, the chief marketing

[44:31] officer now?

[44:32] I think so.

[44:33] Mike, come on.

[44:34] And this is my thing with AP.

[44:35] It's like there are amazing games in the home brew space.

[44:38] We got sonic.

[44:39] You've got the nightmare before Christmas.

[44:41] When are these companies going to wake up and realize some of the greatest games that

[44:45] they could bring the market are sitting right in front of their faces?

[44:50] Do you feel that way, Ryan?

[44:51] They're already done.

[44:52] They're done.

[44:53] Like it's not even like you're just grabbing a license and running with it.

[44:56] Like the whole thing's done because someone with passion already did it.

[45:00] Like and imagine what they could do if it was not just something they did in their garage.

[45:04] Imagine with these people who are creating entire games on their own time, on their own

[45:08] bill and with nothing but their own expertise.

[45:12] Imagine what we could do if you gave one of us or all of us a team, a budget and the time

[45:19] to do it.

[45:20] Like I made sonic in my own time on my own money.

[45:23] What could I have done if I had experts and all the time in the world to do it?

[45:28] What do you feel like when you see a story like J. Pop and years and years and years and

[45:33] millions of dollars?

[45:34] Does it frustrate you as in the homebrew community as you watch this guy, continue to spend

[45:40] money and just can't get stuff to market and you guys are doing it like in your garages

[45:44] with no team, no millions.

[45:46] What do you feel about that?

[45:47] Don't understand it.

[45:50] Like I'm more familiar with this phenomenon in a lot of video game space because before

[45:57] I was in the pinball was a big video game player.

[45:59] You have games like Star Citizen that have taken in hundreds of millions of dollars and

[46:06] 10 years of development and they only have like a clunky beta to show for it and I just

[46:12] don't get it.

[46:14] Like I can't wrap my head around what must be going on behind those closed doors to create

[46:18] such a situation.

[46:20] Like even if you're putting in like say you're lazy right because like and then that's

[46:24] not a bad thing.

[46:25] Like say you're a human and like you just don't have the drive that somebody else might

[46:30] have.

[46:31] Like you're still going to get your thing out the door.

[46:33] You're still going to get it done eventually because it's your job.

[46:36] But like there's only a number of situations like I can't speak to their situation but

[46:41] I just don't I can't come up with a hypothetical scenario where you can't get a game out the

[46:45] door.

[46:46] Right.

[46:47] And it's one thing when your ambitions might be so lofty and we see this in the gaming

[46:51] world sometime right?

[46:52] Build these open worlds and then it's just like they can't get it to work right and that's

[46:56] where they stall like 90% done.

[46:59] But when I look at some of these pinball games that have taken so many years I don't even

[47:03] see the lofty ambition in the games.

[47:07] Well, I think that's kind of what happens when you aim too high like you end up so at

[47:11] the very beginning you have all these like you said lofty ambitions and you have all

[47:15] this stuff to do.

[47:16] Then you start developing it and you next thing you know you spent a year and you only have

[47:20] 20% of it done.

[47:22] And so then you have to scale back your vision.

[47:25] So now like say scale it back and I have 40% done.

[47:28] You take another year and now you're only 50% done.

[47:31] So you need to scale it back again.

[47:32] So I feel like what ends up happening is you end up scaling it back and the original

[47:36] vision was so big that it needed all those parts to be worth to make sense.

[47:42] Right.

[47:43] And by the time you're done you've cut out so much that it doesn't make sense anymore.

[47:46] And then the expectations every year as the community waits get higher and higher and

[47:52] higher and higher and the patience of everybody gets lower and lower.

[47:56] So my approach is the opposite.

[47:58] I say aim to make something simple aim to make something simple that works.

[48:05] And then once you have your foundation and you're like all right.

[48:09] If I really needed to and this is actually what I did in my development.

[48:13] If I needed to I could have this game playable and showable in six months because I want

[48:18] to bring it to fantastic New England.

[48:20] That's what I did.

[48:21] I started the game and I said all right I have six months to make something flippable.

[48:24] And I know it sounds crazy but I think I can do it.

[48:27] So I've set my goals really low.

[48:30] Just get a game make it flip out a few modes make it make sense.

[48:34] You know get people excited for what it'll eventually become and then go from there.

[48:39] And so as I'm doing this I have my solid base and then I keep having ideas.

[48:44] And now because I have like modest goals that I can really achieve at any time because

[48:48] they're so modest I can just start stacking on features and stacking on features and like

[48:53] it and if any of them don't work they don't detract from the entirety of the project because

[49:00] the project would have worked in bare bones.

[49:03] Yeah.

[49:04] And I always say this creatives need deadlines and I'm sort of of the creative mindset in

[49:08] my industry and I do get lazier times I lose momentum.

[49:11] But when I know there's a deadline you best believe it.

[49:14] I'm going to have that ready for that client meeting whenever it is.

[49:18] And I think that's the problem too is when these companies and these people and I always

[49:23] say this it's the bigger egos that fly by the deadlines and you know Pat Lawler had

[49:28] a year to make dialed in he took three.

[49:30] John Papadou had how many years to make these games he's taken seven.

[49:34] So I think it's great that in six months you set a deadline you achieved your goal

[49:38] and you built it to meet that deadline which is so important in any creative project right?

[49:44] Mm hmm.

[49:45] And what's the problem with under promising and over performing?

[49:48] Absolutely.

[49:49] Absolutely.

[49:50] No one's ever going to be mad if your game comes in early.

[49:53] Yeah.

[49:54] Early or with more features or with more toys than plan like hey I finished early.

[49:59] All right.

[50:00] I'm going to make a signpost or I finished early the loop to loops going to be metal.

[50:04] I'm still shocked that no one's used this marketing tactic and I'm going to give it

[50:07] to everybody right now.

[50:08] I would totally wheel out a game at a show that had half of what was actually going to

[50:14] be in it.

[50:15] I would sandbag it just so when it came out I'd be like you really thought this was going

[50:20] to be Raza.

[50:21] Come on.

[50:22] It's this.

[50:23] If I were dovel over at American Pimble here's what I would do because the other part

[50:28] is getting the license and I work in marketing and I deal with marketing meetings in which

[50:32] we're talking about getting the license and ultimately someone's got to pitch this

[50:36] to Sega right and the best person to talk to Sega about this and show them this game

[50:42] is you because you have the passion you love this franchise and they are going to see

[50:47] that and I think part of the problem with some of these companies is the people at the

[50:51] top I just I can't imagine them in a meeting with some of these license or holders or license

[50:57] holders and you could see it like they're not in love with these themes or these franchises

[51:02] they kind of sell them on Pimble but man you got to sell them on I'm going to do your

[51:08] property justice and I'm going to make the sonic the hedgehog game that the world is

[51:12] going to love and I think you'd be perfect for doing that so I hope they give you that

[51:15] opportunity Ryan.

[51:16] That would be nice and Sega has previously been very liberal with their licensing especially

[51:21] on Sonic and they've also been very supportive of fan projects so that was one of the other

[51:27] reasons that I've never been afraid to put out everything I'm doing put out what I'm

[51:30] there they're not Nintendo who is famous for DMCA anybody who uses any of their characters

[51:36] and any kind of project Sega often on their official social media accounts jokes and says

[51:42] all right BRB DMCA time right just kidding right doing what you're doing it's awesome right

[51:47] so I think it would be very possible to get them the license it.

[51:52] So American Pimble I hope you're listening I know they listen to this show guys Josh

[51:56] Joe dovel guys wake up we got a guy right here game is done I tell you right now if you

[52:02] guys release Valkyrie or Sherlock Holmes in front of Sonic the hedgehog I will find you

[52:08] and I will hurt you guys Ryan closing out the hour I want to ask you one question and this

[52:12] is like as you talk about playing playing these machines is often what people need to

[52:17] do to vote for them in the twippies now is Sonic up for a twippy this year I hope so I think

[52:24] I got enough support to get on the list now I will say I think this might be a good

[52:29] year for you to take it I don't know what you're up against I haven't seen a ton of

[52:34] home brew new titles Jack dangerous was last year airplane was last year nightmare before

[52:39] Christmas was a few years ago so I think you have a really good chance you have a really

[52:43] good chance here so ladies and gentlemen hope so if you see Sonic the hedgehog on home

[52:47] brew and you're looking for something to fill in in that category show Ryan some love

[52:52] and let's get Ryan at one of these manufacturers making some games because I think if you

[52:56] check out this machine Ryan where's the best place for someone to check out your sonic

[53:00] game so I have a pin side thread under the home brew section it's just on the hedgehog

[53:05] spin ball should be really easy to find I did an expo video for the virtual pinball expo

[53:11] in a couple months ago maybe a month ago and it is on the very first post it's right there

[53:16] that's a great place to like catch up to where the project is at and then every time I do

[53:21] something or anytime I build something or code something it all goes up on that thread so you can

[53:26] see cutting edge and I'm answering questions taking suggestions I've actually got a lot of great

[53:31] input there air so the probably the best place to follow the project would be the pin side thread

[53:36] great Ryan can I borrow your pin side log in and password every once in a while

[53:42] don't know why you'd want it I won't cause any problems I promise

[53:46] now Ryan this has been great I really appreciate it and I think for all of you out there this is

[53:51] an amazing thing you know this guy has a dream theme he doesn't doesn't like take no for an answer

[53:56] that it doesn't exist in the universe he goes and creates it in his own house in his own garage

[54:02] with his own money this is how pinball should be developed and Ryan you are much like Keith

[54:08] Owin who did it on his own Scott Denise who did it on his own and I hope that a year from now

[54:13] we are talking about the next person who show they could do it on their own landed a job at a

[54:19] manufacturer because I think that is the greatest resume for anyone who wants to get into pinball so

[54:25] Ryan congratulations on sonic pinball I can't wait to play it one of these days oh I can't wait

[54:29] until you guys can play it seriously that's the biggest thing I'm missing is play testing all right

[54:34] and thank you so much happy holidays and we will hopefully see you at a show in 2021 oh I hope so

[54:39] but thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you for having me on awesome
