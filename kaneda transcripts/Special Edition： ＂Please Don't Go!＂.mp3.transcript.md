[00:00] Please don't go.

[00:02] Don't go.

[00:04] I beg you to stay.

[00:07] Please don't go.

[00:10] Is the theme of this special edition of Canada's Pinball Podcast?

[00:21] And I say please don't go because that's what it seems.

[00:25] The Highway Pinball Investor Group is asking individuals who have refund requests with them.

[00:33] So people who are fed up who just want to get their money back have been sent an email

[00:38] by the new investment group at Highway Pinball.

[00:41] And I'm not going to go into the whole thing.

[00:44] I'm not going to read the entire email.

[00:48] Here's the main points about it.

[00:49] They basically say we got your request for an email.

[00:54] There's exciting things going on at Highway Pinball.

[00:58] We have a whole new team in place.

[01:00] And let's introduce the new Highway Pinball Dream Team to you.

[01:05] After that they are asking people to hop on the phone and discuss whether or not they

[01:10] still want to get a refund.

[01:13] And then there's a very important sales tactic at the end of the email where they say we're

[01:20] going to raise the price on alien pinball.

[01:25] If you ask for a refund and what they're saying is we will honor the price that you paid

[01:32] for alien.

[01:34] But if you ask for a refund and go to buy back in you're going to pay more.

[01:39] That's what that tactic is meant to do.

[01:41] It's meant to make people afraid that they might have to pay more money.

[01:44] Now, the whole time I was reading this email or these gentlemen are introducing themselves,

[01:51] I got this weird sort of thought in my head.

[01:55] It sort of reminded me the way of like an entrance of these like super amazing business men

[02:03] that are here to save Andrew Highways failing company.

[02:08] And I just had this, this was playing in my head and I want to play it for you.

[02:13] But I was sort of thinking as I was reading the email these gentlemen sent out to the

[02:19] refund requesters.

[02:20] Here's what was going on in my head.

[03:13] Now, you're in best of line up for the few case first and only pinball manufacturer

[03:22] highway pinball.

[03:26] From Norway, brothers from different mothers to guys who will now apply their fire protection

[03:36] skills to the pinball world.

[03:39] They built businesses from the ground up and they love pinball, Roger and Kato.

[03:51] Hilling from Sweden, they call him the snack bar kid.

[03:57] He's made more money than you since 2001.

[04:02] The computer genius that opened Sweden's first pinball shop.

[04:07] Daniel Johnson.

[04:11] Also from Sweden, known as the humble cragger.

[04:16] He's got 100 pinball machines in his house and has been crushing it in the world of business

[04:24] since 1988.

[04:27] He is going to start highway production line.

[04:31] This is your Huckleberry Patrick Dan.

[04:37] And finally from Germany, the man with the silver spoon.

[04:43] He got his first pinball machine at age 11.

[04:48] Since then, he's succeeded in the world of business.

[04:53] He is, he knows that pinball is hard, but his determination is harder.

[04:58] He will not fail.

[05:00] Alexander Spor.

[05:04] And your head coach for highway pinball.

[05:09] The man who gets a royal teeth on every game sold.

[05:14] No other than, all right, Lawson.

[05:19] Let's hear it.

[05:20] Are you sure you still want to revon?

[05:24] This is your highway pinball dream team.

[05:30] All right, well, I had to do that.

[05:41] That's sort of like how my mind works.

[05:43] I'm sorry.

[05:44] I read these things and I go to these crazy places.

[05:47] But here's the thing.

[05:50] The decision now is up to people out there.

[05:53] And the way I look at it is real simple.

[05:56] Why would you not ask for a refund?

[05:59] And I said this in the previous podcast.

[06:01] If these gentlemen are so good at business and they're going to turn highway around, then

[06:06] let them do it with their money.

[06:09] You got to play the scenario of best case worst case scenario.

[06:12] Okay, so let's think about it like this.

[06:15] Worst case scenario, you keep your money invested in highway pinball and it doesn't work out

[06:20] and you lose all your money.

[06:22] Okay, that's worst case scenario.

[06:25] Best case scenario.

[06:26] To keep your money in highway pinball, they're successful.

[06:30] You get your game for what you paid for it and everything's good.

[06:35] Okay.

[06:36] But why not eliminate the worst case scenario and do this?

[06:41] Why not ask for a refund if you get your money back and highway pinball is successful

[06:48] and the games do come out.

[06:50] Then you go and you buy one for a little bit more money than you originally were going

[06:54] to buy it for.

[06:55] Let's say it's $500 more per game.

[06:58] Wouldn't you rather eliminate the risk of losing all your money, get your money back and

[07:04] simply go back in and buy it for a higher price.

[07:08] But when you go buy it for a higher price, you are 100% guaranteed a game because the

[07:12] games are real.

[07:14] And that's the way I look at it.

[07:15] I mean, that's how I would approach it.

[07:17] Again, not my money.

[07:19] I'm not in on it.

[07:21] But I am nervous when I start to see a chance for people to maybe just get out and play

[07:27] it safe.

[07:29] The amount of people that still are just trying to convince you to stay in, stay in, stay

[07:33] in.

[07:34] It's this sort of piling on mentality where you either have to think the way people want

[07:40] you to think on the thread and inside of pinside or you can think for yourself and do

[07:47] what I think is the wiser thing to do, which is get your money back and hope these guys can

[07:52] fix highway pinball.

[07:54] And that is not, I hope they fix highway pinball.

[07:57] But I want them to fix it with their own money.

[08:00] And I don't like it when I read.

[08:03] You know, a lot of people flip and flop in on the thread now.

[08:08] And I got a call out, my friend Iceman, who all of a sudden now is back on board cheer

[08:13] leading this thing to get done if it's the cycle.

[08:19] And it's a cycle of contempt within pinball.

[08:22] You know, it's the way you can cheerly pentege when they try to fix it where you can cheerly

[08:26] the new investment group.

[08:28] But I look, the whole thing is this.

[08:31] And I see this in the thread too, where people try to compare Jersey Jack to this situation

[08:37] with Jack's bell out.

[08:38] And I see, I don't see those as the same thing.

[08:41] How can you say that what Jersey Jack needed is the same as what highway pinball needs?

[08:46] Jersey Jack had a successful production line going, yes, Jack did a lot of sleazy sales

[08:53] tactic stuff to try and save his company.

[08:57] Andrew highway did a lot of lying and sleazy stuff to try and save his company.

[09:02] John Papaduke did a lot of sleazy things.

[09:04] But here's the thing.

[09:06] I think it's time where we stop trying to salvage or sort of feel better about being

[09:16] lied to.

[09:17] When you're lied to by a company, you know, these guys all lie, Kevin lied, John lied,

[09:23] at times Jack lied, at times, many times Andrew lied.

[09:28] This constant desire to see the silver lining in a pinball operation doesn't it get old?

[09:35] Did you guys get tired of trying to just root for these things to succeed when there are

[09:42] plenty of companies out there that will get you a game?

[09:46] Well not plenty, right?

[09:48] Stern will get you a game.

[09:49] Spooky will get you a game.

[09:51] Jersey Jack will now get you a game.

[09:53] Chicago gaming will get you a game.

[09:55] And this summer, there's a lot of new games coming out that a lot of people are excited

[09:59] about.

[10:01] Look, this special edition, I want to wrap it up by saying one thing.

[10:05] I hope these guys can figure it out.

[10:08] I want them to do it with their own money.

[10:10] But here's the problem that I see happening.

[10:13] I don't think their timeline will move fast enough to appease the mob over on pinside.

[10:22] Because these owners are anxious and they want to see immediate results.

[10:25] And I'm not sure that you can fix all of Andrew's issues so quickly that individuals will

[10:37] be patient enough to go on the journey with you.

[10:40] And again, if there's money to go back into your pocket, why not put it there and at least

[10:48] sleep at night and feel good that when alien pinball does come out, then you can go get it

[10:54] without any risk involved.

[10:57] Something I also want to see.

[10:59] I want to see it.

[11:00] And I don't think we've really seen it.

[11:02] I want to see an apology from Andrew highway to the people that are out there.

[11:07] I've seen a lot of people on the different forms have a lot of sympathy and compassion

[11:12] for Andrew.

[11:13] I don't feel that way.

[11:15] I really don't.

[11:16] There were so many times where I think he could have got compassion and could have had forgiveness.

[11:22] That he had been more honest and transparent with people, but he didn't.

[11:27] And he lied constantly about the status of the machines and those lies led new buyers

[11:34] to put money into the company and those people are now suffering.

[11:39] So I don't see the business leader who is disingenuous as a victim in any way.

[11:46] We all have dreams.

[11:48] We all have things that we would love to do.

[11:52] And if we tell people we're going to start doing our dream and create a company to make

[11:55] a dream product and then we realize we hit bumps in the road, we should not go and have

[12:03] consumers bail us out and get money from them because we told a bunch of lies.

[12:08] And I just love how there's a lot of short-term memory loss.

[12:12] A lot of short-term memory loss by a lot of people on these threads.

[12:17] It's that cycle and it's dangerous.

[12:19] If you want to go back and look at podcasts, if you want to go back and look at the information

[12:25] that individuals like myself, individuals like Mitchell, I'm going to say this.

[12:31] I shared a lot of that information with PINSIDE members, with moderators, with people who

[12:38] ran the forums.

[12:40] They all decided not to share the information with you because they said it couldn't be

[12:44] verified from an anonymous source.

[12:46] I was put up by a duplicate account.

[12:49] Of course I had to put up information in a duplicate account because you banned my account.

[12:54] So it's like, I tried.

[12:58] But look, we'll give these guys a chance to write the wrongs of Andrew, but again,

[13:06] make them do it.

[13:07] Don't play with your money again.

[13:10] Why gamble again?

[13:12] When you have a chance to play it safe and then go get the machine you want if it's actually

[13:17] made, if they can actually figure it out.

[13:20] The final point I'll make is this.

[13:23] All of these gentlemen, all of them, none of them live in the UK.

[13:28] I think it's hard enough making PINBALL machine.

[13:30] It would be hard enough to make a PINBALL machine work in the city of Chicago where you could

[13:35] get PINBALL talent under one roof and to figure out how to mass produce PINBALL machines

[13:42] is difficult enough in areas of the world where there is a superfluous amount of people

[13:47] who at least have a background in PINBALL.

[13:50] Now having a background in manufacturing, having a background in computer programming,

[13:56] having a background in all these other things that these gentlemen had backgrounds in,

[14:00] will that translate over to PINBALL?

[14:03] And they transfer that knowledge of successful business practices into the world of PINBALL.

[14:09] That's just a question mark because as we've all seen, PINBALL is a tricky, tricky industry

[14:16] and it is a very, very complex device with lots of moving parts, 3,000 parts that all

[14:25] have to be in one place at one time and screwed together in a way that doesn't break down.

[14:32] Good luck trying to make a PINBALL company when you're starting brand new and nobody

[14:38] has experienced manufacturing PINBALL machines.

[14:41] It takes a really long time to ramp up and get that institutional knowledge that you need

[14:49] to make a high quality mass produced PINBALL machine.

[14:52] Remember, highway PINBALL is not trying to be spooky.

[14:55] Highway PINBALL is not zidware, right?

[14:57] When American PINBALL said we're going to build magic girls, there's 25 of them.

[15:00] That's nothing.

[15:01] That's like 25 home-brewed machines.

[15:04] These guys need to build hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of alien PINBALL machines with

[15:10] what experience building even any PINBALL machines.

[15:13] So those are just the questions that I hope people keep asking themselves and it's all up

[15:17] to you guys.

[15:18] Look, I wish these guys luck.

[15:20] I wish you consumers and you buyers out there.

[15:23] I wish you luck.

[15:24] I think everyone's got to make tough decisions right now on what they want to do.

[15:30] I also think that everyone should just back away from the damn threads.

[15:34] There's so many threads about this and everyone's just going to argue back and forth.

[15:38] And I'll say this, it's not going to be a quick fix.

[15:40] You're not going to get your alien PINBALL machine in two weeks.

[15:44] If you want to go into the thread and constantly argue, I think you're going to be frustrated.

[15:51] I also think people like Orrick and Hilton and the people that are constantly like

[15:56] shilling for the company probably need to take a step back too.

[16:00] I think everyone involved with this new Highway PINBALL organization needs to realize that

[16:07] there's a lot of anger and there's a lot of anxiety.

[16:11] And they need to not just do this one thing at a time, every day communicating something

[16:17] differently.

[16:18] I think they need a professional issues in crisis person.

[16:22] I think they need a professional communicator to help join the team.

[16:26] And that person isn't Orrick.

[16:28] And I know Orrick's very outspoken, but he did this with Andrew.

[16:32] He should not be the person speaking on behalf of the company.

[16:36] If they've asked him to do that, I think they don't understand the past.

[16:41] And he is not probably the best person to be that official spokesperson for the company.

[16:48] And again, it's hard.

[16:50] I know they're trying, they have to move quickly.

[16:51] I don't think these guys would have announced anything.

[16:55] They deal not even signed.

[16:57] They have to move quickly because PINBALL is forcing them to say something.

[17:04] Every day that goes by, the panic grows larger.

[17:06] It's an unfortunate situation.

[17:08] I don't envy them.

[17:10] But they're all very successful men.

[17:12] They probably look at their checking accounts and they're all very happy.

[17:15] So we'll see what happens.

[17:16] That's it.

[17:17] I want the attention now to go to Star Wars, go to Dial then.

[17:21] We're going to see Star Wars being played today.

[17:23] We're going to get gameplay footage from IGN.

[17:25] That's really exciting.

[17:26] I'm going to interview another podcaster out there tonight and we're going to talk about

[17:30] it.

[17:31] We'll also talk about Alien.

[17:32] But I just had to get up this little special edition.

[17:34] So you guys could have a little laugh in the morning.

[17:37] And you guys could make up your mind on what you want to do with Alien PINBALL.

[17:41] I also want to say this.

[17:42] I invite these new investors onto the show.

[17:45] They've probably been told that Canadian's toxic and that Andrew avoided me and Andrew

[17:50] accused me of sabotaging his company.

[17:51] I got called all those things by Andrew, by the way.

[17:54] I was threatened.

[17:55] Andrew was threatening to sue me a bunch of times.

[17:58] He didn't say it to my face, but he had people come to me and say he was contacting a lawyer.

[18:04] All this stuff, right?

[18:05] Coming after, like I ruined his company.

[18:07] But I'll say this.

[18:08] I will let bygones be bygones.

[18:10] I invite any of these investors onto the show to talk about what their plan is moving

[18:16] forward.

[18:17] I'm happy to have them on.

[18:18] I actually think hearing their voices is much better than email.

[18:22] I think a lot is lost in tone.

[18:24] So I happily invite them on the show.

[18:26] If you're friends with them, if you know them, if you're an employee at Highway PINBALL,

[18:29] I know you guys listen to this podcast.

[18:31] How could you not listen to a podcast that discusses your company so frequently?

[18:36] Simply email me at canadapimbalatgmail.com and I will happily give anyone over at Highway

[18:42] PINBALL the floor to discuss the future of Highway PINBALL.

[18:46] So people can hear the tone in your voice and the passion and the commitment that you

[18:49] have to make in this company right again and to make buyers hold again.

[18:55] Okay, so that's all we're going to say.

[18:57] Have a great Tuesday, everyone.

[18:58] More to come.

[18:59] More Star Wars.

[19:01] This is Canada PINBALL.

[19:02] Sign it off.
