[00:00] When I got that phone, you feel the one that got that phone.

[00:06] Your body's so so full of gold, I'm from power and innovation.

[00:14] Welcome to episode 269 of Canadian Pimball Podcasts.

[00:26] The only pinball podcast that Andrew Highway threatened to sue on your host, Canada.

[00:32] We actually have a guest on the show. I'm really excited.

[00:36] The majority of this podcast is going to be me airing my discussion with Blake Dumas-Nill.

[00:42] You know Blake, if you listen to the show, incredible guy, huge pinball fanatic.

[00:47] And we are going to discuss everything going on on the hobby.

[00:51] So I'm not going to waste a lot of time on this introduction.

[00:54] A few updates that I want to talk about before I jump to that interview.

[00:58] Number one, the sad news was reported to the pinball world that Yop of Dutch pinball is apparently battling throat cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy.

[01:13] And those around him say he's focusing on what's important in life and that puts the pinball stresses into perspective.

[01:23] So a bit of bad news on both the personal front of what he's going through, but also another sort of, you know, just bit of bad news for big Lebowski owners.

[01:37] What does this mean for the future of getting that game into production?

[01:42] We have not heard an update on how the lawyers have been trying to figure this out.

[01:49] So still a lot of just no movement.

[01:54] And it seems like this is just bad movement with the personal health of Yop where it's at.

[02:01] So obviously we want to put pinball aside and hope he is able to battle what he's going through.

[02:11] Everyone realizes that yes, there is the pinball stuff that sucks, but real life and important issues like health will always come before what it goes on in the pinball world.

[02:24] All right.

[02:26] What else is going on?

[02:28] So we talked a little bit about the artwork for a clean pinball on this interview with Blake and there's an update that I read about.

[02:36] So apparently Brian Allen says that he worked on that artwork and with Andrew Highway and they submitted it to Queen.

[02:46] And guess what?

[02:48] Queen rejected it and didn't want that kind of illustration to represent the band.

[02:53] Is anybody surprised?

[02:55] I mean, he made those two guys look pretty weird.

[02:59] So I'm not surprised that Queen want to go with a more romantic and stylized version of the band.

[03:06] All right.

[03:07] All right. What else is going on?

[03:08] So our poor friend, Zach over at straight down the middle.

[03:12] Zach does something that is selfless.

[03:15] He buys new pinball machines to review them.

[03:19] And if he likes them, he keeps them and if he does, and he sells them for a good price for the next person to get it.

[03:25] And so normally he's pretty efficient in getting the game sales off the ground, but nobody seems to want Deadpool.

[03:33] Which is kind of funny because everyone keeps raving about Deadpool on Pinside and here is one for $5,100.

[03:42] And it comes with Pins stadium lights and it comes with some mod, couple mods that like speaker grow mods and some other mods like Shooter Lane mods and some other stuff or Shooter rods.

[03:54] And yet nobody is buying it and he has to keep lowering the price.

[04:00] And I think this is pretty indicative of where we're at.

[04:03] The market is oversaturated.

[04:05] People want, you know, they want to see what's next.

[04:09] There's a lot on the horizon.

[04:11] You know, $5,000 is still $5,000.

[04:14] You know, there's only so much room that, you know, people have and there's only so much money people have before they, you know,

[04:23] they pull the trigger.

[04:24] I think we're seeing a lot more hesitation on things getting gobbled up immediately unless people know they want to have it.

[04:31] I think it's also really hard to sell a Stern Pro that is on the line that you could get brand new.

[04:38] You know, I don't even think like a $4,500 savings is worth it to most people.

[04:43] I think they'd rather have it brand new than someone's used game.

[04:49] You know, you're basically getting a 10% discount, but you also then have to deal with like paying for shipping unless you're going to go pick it up.

[04:57] And so then you limit your buyer pool to people who can drive and go pick up the game.

[05:04] So I also think it's testament that Deadpool, you know, as much as people are saying this is like the greatest game ever and it's not.

[05:12] And I know people have a little bit of a honeymoon period with brand new Stern games and we always hear that they're the greatest game ever, but I'm not so sure about that.

[05:21] All right, speaking of greatest game ever, there is new Batman code out again code 0.96, which adds another wizard mode to the game.

[05:32] And it's at the point now where we're at 0.96 and Batman 66 is almost pretty much just about done.

[05:42] And I think the consensus on the game two years after it came out is it's now one of Stern's best games.

[05:51] And by that, I mean, it is probably one of the best themes Stern has ever done for a pinball game.

[05:59] It's definitely not the best shooter. I will never in a million years lie to you and tell you that Batman 66 is like the greatest layout or design and it's not clunky and it's it's it's all of those things.

[06:13] It's clunky. It's got design issues here and there, but it's fun because of the sum of the parts. And by that, I mean the theme, the music, the callouts, everything is so integrated into the pinball machine.

[06:27] That you're willing to be a little bit more forgiving on some of the clunkiness of the game. Now it's not like a dog by any means. I think why people like Batman.

[06:36] The reason I think a lot of people like it is it's a pretty wide open play field. So it's not an intimidating game to step up to. It's actually pretty easy to step up to a Batman and know what to do.

[06:46] But the real gem of this game, the real diamond in the otherwise rough parts of it is the code and Lyman sheets.

[06:57] You know, I've always heard people brag about him and how he can make a game so much more than what is like what lies before your eyes with the play field.

[07:05] And I understand why people say that now. I think the genius of Lyman and Batman is the mixture of things that the casual player can jump in and go do.

[07:17] Like you literally only have to hit two shots. You hit two shots in any of the villain shots and the phone starts to ring and you pick up the phone and you're in a mode.

[07:25] Okay, that is super super simple. It gets deeper and a little bit more complex from there. I think where people are starting to sort of complain a little bit.

[07:36] And I want to talk about this for a second is to get to the wizard modes. Okay, to get to the like this, the fun stuff at the end of the journey is in the game.

[07:46] It's not super simple. It's not super easy. Okay, you either have to jail all four villains and then start villain escape or you have to like defeat a minor villain from season one, a minor villain from season two and a minor villain from season three.

[08:05] And you have to do all three of those and the hard part about the minor villains is when you drain you lose the mode. Okay, but when you drain when you have a major villain like the Joker penguin catwoman or ridler, you stay in that mode even when you drain.

[08:21] So it's a lot harder to go the minor villain route. Now here's the thing. I am not a good pinball player. I am not by any means a good pinball player.

[08:33] But I when I hear people on Pinside complain that Lyman should have made those wizard modes easier to get to that those multi balls should be easier to unlock.

[08:46] I literally get annoyed by that and I'll tell you why because come on come on dudes learn how to play pinball a little bit. It is not hard to do. It's not impossible to learn how to beat.

[08:59] Madhatter, which is just about like maybe eight shots and then you have to do egghead, which is super simple egghead season two, which is just you hit the gadget button and you only have to then hit one shot.

[09:12] It's like a shortcut season that he put in there for everyone. And then you do like egghead season three, which is also pretty simple.

[09:21] Look, my point is there's no point in making everything in a pinball machine immediately gratifying in the sense of like you get to see, you know, the multi balls and the wizard modes pretty easily because in what's the point of playing the game.

[09:39] You know, if you want a pinball machine to be like Mario brothers where you can like take the elevator up to the top of the ceiling and then warp zone to the final level like that kind of spoils the fun.

[09:51] I think what Batman does need is probably a simpler way to start a multi ball for the novice player, which is not in there yet. But anyway, I want to say I think the game right now is pretty much done.

[10:05] I mean, there's going to be a couple more wizard, there's one more wizard mode. I think that got added. I think there's going to be a few other things. But ultimately we are getting to the finish line of this game.

[10:16] And I know it's been a two year wait, but I think it was worth it for those people who went in on the journey. But we'll see. We'll see what's left. I think there's some polish. I would love to see more crane action from the penguin.

[10:31] But Batman 66 is coming to the finish line. There's also new code on aero smith. There's new code on Deadpool coming. What else is going on in the pinball world? So this made me laugh. So tonight I was down looking at my wedding venue. I'm getting married in a couple months.

[10:47] And on the same block of my wedding venue, it's down in Wall Street. There's a street called stone street and stone street is famous for having a lot of Irish pubs, a lot of character on that street. All these people are out and about on these beautiful park benches having beers and food and you know tons of people on stone street tonight.

[11:11] And I said to Brenda said he Brenda came here. Let me see if something is where I think it is. And I walk down the block to the end of the block to a restaurant called Smokehouse barbecue. We walk in there. We walk upstairs. There's nobody upstairs. Absolutely nobody. There's chairs on top of tables. It's not set up. And there to my right is a game that so many of you are waiting for. So many of you have paid for already. So many of you have been clamoring to play and so many of you have been playing.

[11:40] And it's just there sitting to the right. Machines turned off. Nobody's even upstairs. Is a pirates of the Caribbean by Jersey Jack Pimble. So I walk over with Brenda and I say hey, do you have a buck. Turn the game on. Game boots up. Takes a little while to boot up that game. It started saying something like open coin door something on the screen. It didn't matter. I was able to start a game. And I was able to jump on pirate.

[12:09] I was able to jump on pirate to the Caribbean and play it. And I just couldn't help but laugh is why is this game. Just stuck upstairs in a restaurant where nobody is at.

[12:22] Getting played by nobody. Introducing Pimball to nobody. Expanding Pimball to no one. It's just crazy. It's like it's like it's just there to be out of the way.

[12:34] But what I love about it is instead of spending $9,000 $10,000. It's a limited edition machine. So instead of spending like $9,500.

[12:44] I could go down there every night and play Pirates of the Caribbean with nobody there with perfect sound able to hear all the call outs and have my own sort of like it's like a home use only experience with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:01] And then I could keep $9,495 in the bank and not have to worry about fixing it. Not have to worry about getting old or stale.

[13:13] And that's why I do love New York City. I mean I just literally when I was you know just down there I'm like just the whole notion of like clamoring to buy and own these games every time a new game is out. It just seems foolish to me.

[13:26] My opinions about the game they still haven't changed. I jump on it. There's so many lights. There's so many inserts. There's so much going on.

[13:36] The trunk lock on that game isn't working right. The ball goes up when it says lock and it goes up and it falls off the left side of the trunk.

[13:47] So I don't know if that's an early sort of distributor model but it's not functioning properly.

[13:54] But you know look the game is the game is what it is. You know I hope you guys who buy it enjoyed and have fun with it.

[14:00] But I'm still I don't see the magic there like I like I want to see with Jersey Jack games. I still think dialed in is the greatest game they've made to date.

[14:11] But that theme just puts me to sleep dialed in. Anyway let me air this interview with Blake. I think you're really going to enjoy it.

[14:19] I also got a message from my master which I haven't I haven't received anything from this gentleman in a very long time.

[15:44] All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome back to Canadian's pinball podcast we finally have another guest.

[15:51] And this is a guest who's been on the show I think you're one of my first guest Blake Blake do miss no artist extraordinary man is from Texas big big friend of mine.

[16:02] I always crash in his room at T.P.F. Blake welcome back to the show.

[16:05] Hey thanks for having me back Chris. And Blake we need another voice on this show it's been just me rambling and ranting for months.

[16:13] I'm happy to get someone else's opinion about what's going on in the pinball world how does that sound.

[16:19] Sounds great.

[16:20] Now the first question I have for you Blake have you donated to the Canadian pinball podcast Patreon account.

[16:28] I have not yet I feel so ashamed.

[16:32] For those of you out there and I know I talk about expensive cars and clothes and whatnot but let me tell you something I got to put food on the table.

[16:41] Go to Patreon, Canadian pinball if you are a fan of the show and any support would be greatly appreciated.

[16:47] Now Blake we're not going to talk about that we're going to talk about all the stuff that's been going on in the pinball world how does that sound.

[16:53] Sounds good.

[16:54] All right and feel free at any time Blake if there's anything else you want to discuss like I have a little list of things we're going to go down the manufacturers and just talk about.

[17:01] The news and pinball so we'll start with Stern all right have you played Deadpool yet.

[17:07] Yeah I've actually played all three models what are your thoughts.

[17:11] You know what I really like the game a lot it actually surprised me you know given the leaks that came out of while back the game just didn't really

[17:21] really excite me that much with the white wood that was shown and I've got to admit after I played the pro you know probably about a month ago.

[17:30] It was a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be in fact I think I've been having more fun playing Deadpool recently than I then I have on Iron Maiden.

[17:40] You know Iron Maiden's a great layout and there's I think there's more to the shots on the game but Deadpool's just kind of got a fun factor to it that.

[17:51] I feel like Iron Maiden doesn't have quite as much and a lot of that has to do with the animations and the sounds and the call outs and stuff and I I think that's going to be a game that that shapes up really nicely over time.

[18:02] You know and I just pretty much pan Deadpool on my last podcast but here's and I played both of them yesterday so I'm glad you brought up Iron Maiden because you know I think you're on to something in the sense that like Deadpool as a theme and with call outs it's it's got more fun built into the theme than Iron Maiden right because Maiden's kind of like it's kind of serious.

[18:26] You know you got the music going but there's not a lot that makes you like laugh out loud or is trying to make you have like a fun experience.

[18:33] It's almost like I wish I could combine the layout of Iron Maiden with the fun factor of Deadpool.

[18:41] Yeah I mean I think that the animations and Iron Maiden are nice I mean I think that a lot of them were taken from the game that they had to use as part of the license.

[18:52] And I feel like some of it feels rather repetitious and Deadpool is kind of that way right now but I see so much more artistry that went into you know building the LCD package and everything that's in Deadpool that I was not expecting when they announced that game or you know the rumors had leaked that that game was being made.

[19:15] I was a huge fan of like the Konami you know X-Men game as a kid and the fact that they took the animation style from that and incorporated into a pinball machine was just I thought that was brilliant I thought that was a great way to work around not having movie assets and all that stuff to work with and it really gave him more freedom honestly so Deadpool really has surprised me it's it's a fun layout it's it's more fun than it looked like on the white wood.

[19:44] It's got some cool some cool shots the way that orbit goes around is a little different than expected and I think my biggest not really complaint but just observation is that the game doesn't have anything truly magical to it in terms of mechanisms.

[20:03] I kind of feel that way about iron maiden as well though but I will say where there might not be anything truly unique that captures the ball or you know does something really amazing that'll surprise people on the game they do make up for it with once again beautiful artwork and a fantastic sound and music package and a great light show they they really have done a great way of creating energy in the game.

[20:32] When there isn't really anything that that makes the ball do something unique and that's been my great and I think when I look at both of those games and I that was the takeaway I had yesterday was I feel like Stern is basically their new approach to pinball is let's do it with the LCD and the artwork and like the lights and the sound but they're they've removed the physical mechanical stuff from the game.

[21:02] And that creates the wow because it's cheaper because it doesn't break because it's easier to like service these machines and you know so that's their new approach and I had the same feelings to Blake is like I just don't feel like there's any toy or meck in either game that justifies I think the price of the premium and the L. E.

[21:21] See that's my issue with Stern is I feel like everything now is just like a glorified Stern pro like we're not getting anything that to me feels like anywhere near a nine thousand dollar game.

[21:33] Right. Yeah it's it's very hard for me to look at these games and justify why would I buy the premium or the L. E. when really the experience that's making the game fun like I said all those things like the art and the music and whatnot.

[21:49] You're getting that with the pro model as it is so I would feel very content buying the pro model on those types of games I do think that you know there have been games in the past that's turns made where they really they really justified that additional cost on the premium and the L. E.

[22:08] really went all out even beyond just you know nice trim packages and stuff like that and there were features that made the game a whole completely different experience than what you're getting with the pro model and why you know why can't you get and this is what I don't understand.

[22:26] For almost double the price like an L. E. is almost double the price of a pro why don't you get unique coding in the game like that to me that when everyone always talks about Tron L. E. and the daft punk multi ball is the main reason why the L. E. is special and yet Stern can see that's why I think everyone's playing a pro because everyone is running on the same engine you know it's like it not to use a car you meant but everyone's gaming experience.

[22:56] For the most part is identical when it comes to the code of the game right right and you know I appreciate that I guess it's kind of a double head sword that they you know they they want to offer a pretty close experience for people that do want to buy a pro to those that buy an L. E. in terms of you know you feel like you're not getting screwed out of some major features that you feel like the game should have but on the same note people are pretty good.

[23:26] Paying premium prices for these higher end games and I agree that they should expect to get something that is unique to those games and that you know you can't just walk up to a pro and get that same experience so absolutely and speaking of premium prices have you heard the rumor.

[23:45] We'll go into the next title so beetles there is a rumor floating around inside which we all know is like you know nothing is ever validated but that there will be a beetles super limited edition that will cost fifty thousand dollars.

[24:06] Yeah I heard that rumor I I sort of have a hard time believing that there's some truth to it but there are a lot of us that can believe that they were selling Batman 66 for 15 thousand dollars when they announced that so this is thirty five thousand dollars more than that.

[24:26] Right this is this is an automobile more than that in that game was you could get a Honda Civic Type R and a Batman super early for the price of a fifty thousand are beetles.

[24:38] Right I mean all I could say is that like man you know if they seriously are I think that even if they're going to charge more than twenty thousand dollars for a super early on that title that you're going to have to have like custom call outs or signatures from Paul McConaughey.

[24:56] So you're going to have to have some very unique things that the diehard beetles fan would want to have you know you need John Lennon to do custom call outs or this machine to cause fifty thousand dollars.

[25:09] Right so we know that it's a re-theme of see which and that has been like a rumor but now I look I can confirm that that's what it's going to be.

[25:19] What are your thoughts on that because that's the other thing that people are sort of like wait a minute like I'm not going to pay a premium for what is essentially a risk in of an old game that's a single level game.

[25:32] Well I mean I think it's a perfect example of you are not paying for a game to play with that machine you're paying for the theme the exclusivity of owning that theme especially if they truly make it very limited like it sounds like they're going to you know I think that they saw there was a huge success and a lot of money to be made with that supreme machine for a pretty minimal amount of effort you know in terms of.

[26:01] Just re-skimming a home additions by our man so.

[26:06] I think they know that there are a lot of diehard beetles fans out there that will buy this machine side unseen and they're banking on that so it doesn't it doesn't matter that the gameplay may be simple.

[26:20] Yeah I think they might have a misstep here and here's here's why because I think supreme is different than beetle fanbase and supreme mania is actually a real thing Stern was smart to do what they did supreme fans are young people who have more money than brains who will buy a $500 brick because it says supreme on it and they just they just want anything that's supreme they're not fans of pinball at all right so I think it works there.

[26:49] I don't know if beetle mania collectors we saw this with Star Wars where we just expected all Star Wars collectors to buy it just because it was Star Wars and that didn't actually turn out to be the case but I'm curious to see if beetles fans will plunk down this kind of cash on a on a thing that actually has no real connection to the band whatsoever you know it's not like it's a piece of memorabilia.

[27:18] It's a pinball machine and I don't know I'm curious do you okay so do we do we think yes or no I don't think there's going to be a $50,000 super limited edition I think that sounds idiotic.

[27:34] I think they're I think they're there probably will be a super limited edition but I definitely don't think it'll be at that price point I mean 20 grand maybe I mean if it really is a moment of the game

[27:47] it's a much more simplistic layout you know as they're talking about I mean that man and how many of this super at least you think they're going to make a 20 grand of pop because that supplies an interesting thing to think about with price.

[28:01] Yeah so let's see what they made 150 SLE's or no another made 80 SLE's for Batman.

[28:08] I could see them bumping that number up because I think that the beetles fan base is much bigger than it is for Batman 66.

[28:19] I could see them going with maybe a hundred to 150 of them at that price point but and they probably would sell.

[28:26] You know you do make a good point though that they that that clocker base is not the same as the supreme clocker base I mean they like you said they they would buy you know a bag of garbage for

[28:37] five hundred dollars if it had the supreme brand on it but I think so.

[28:42] I think so.

[28:43] The turn is realized is and I've been saying this and this is why I think a lot of the boutique manufacturers out there just aiming for the wrong dollars because that's three million dollars like Stern could potentially make by selling just 150 beetles machines at 20 grand of pop.

[29:00] There are so many multi millionaires and you know this Blake in this hobby it's it's almost laughable that nobody even tries to push the envelope and test to see what the ceiling is of what these millionaires will spend on a pinball machine and I think Batman 66 I think you're absolutely right showed them that that wasn't even the ceiling I bet they could

[29:24] be all 80 for 20 grand.

[29:27] Yeah I mean the demand is there on certain titles I think it just has to be the right package overall I'm not sure that people are going to be willing to cough up that much money for an even more simplistic game even if it's got the beetles brand on it you know because

[29:48] the beetles fans are are kind of segregated in a way based off of the albums and the eras that that band went through and you know the rumor is that this game and you and I have seen this first hand actually it's really not a rumor but this game is based off of the early beetle mania era you know part of their career it's yeah it's a hard days night it's the the Ed Sullivan show appearance you know that era it's not going to be sergeant peppers and

[30:17] Abby Road and all that stuff so you know that may turn off some die hard beetle fans a little bit as well because they may only want to have some of that later era stuff and so I think it's just going to depend on on what people are really looking for if the game plays really simplistic and there's nothing

[30:39] truly unique to any mechanisms on it that might not make the game quite as exciting other than a beautiful art package and a you know world renowned theme and we'll see I think we're going to have to wait until probably February to actually get a reveal of beetles so we're not going to see anything

[30:50] in the next bow on it's turned does not even want any of this info out there but you know we we have we've built a podcast on not giving stern the ability to reveal what they would like to so we we keep spoiling them so speaking of spoilers monsters is definitely next we have seen the artwork we've talked about

[31:00] people have talked about it it looks cool do you think we're going to see monsters at expo Blake or do you think it's going to be later than expo I mean I would I would

[31:11] hope that it's going to be an expo I would hope that this is the absolute perfect timing for them to release that game but you know all of us thought that iron maiden was a shoe and for being unveiled a team of

[31:31] them and they decided to wait about a month so I would hope that for the people that are going to go to expo this year I hope that it's a good experience and I really hope that

[31:42] stern shows monsters because I think there's a huge expectation and I think that's really the most by far the game that everybody's looking forward to seeing the most unveiled at expo so but you never know you know you you you've discussed this before that it really doesn't matter when any of these

[32:10] new games are unveiled and that's a pretty good point stern's got such a grasp on the market that they can announce a game at any time of via any medium you know they've been going to a lot of news outlets lately and stuff and it will still generate a lot of interest it will still generate the height and they will still sell the certain titles out immediately regardless of it being on the floor to show exactly here's my I don't think they go to expo I think that's what I think it's going to be a bit of a

[32:39] bit of an expo I think stern has a new approach where they almost like let the other manufacturers have the shows have that you know their time in the limelight because here's what happens these other manufacturers go to these

[32:54] shows we're going to see it with October fest will talk a little bit about that they're going to reveal things and then they're not going to be able to ship those games to consumers for months if not an entire year let's not forget

[33:07] jack showed pirates of the Caribbean a year ago and people are still not getting the game so I think stern weights I think they my hunch is they're going to reveal it on Halloween something around then and then they're going to start shipping to consumers in mid to late November and you're right what it doesn't matter because once they reveal it it's like we're taking orders now and the game is the game is always already on the line when they reveal yes which is like

[33:37] how do you compete with that yeah now the only the only thing that I could see them unveiling at expo is if they're going to tie it into the storm tour you know if they if the game really is basically on the line at this point or let's say it's about to be on the line then they may do what they did with Batman 66 and unveil the game on their own terms on their own turf you know and not not worry about actually unveiling it at the show I mean the show

[34:07] I didn't like that though did you like I mean Batman was weird it was like it was like the Wednesday before the show there was like three games lined up nobody could play I mean it was kind of like a piss poor I mean the game was visually beautiful like everyone was like whoa right but I think they already said the stern tours going to be a tortoise you know see that how the their current game is built I think it's going to be like a Deadpool you go through each station of making a Deadpool I don't I doubt it's going to be monsters well that that's the way the tour was set up

[34:37] last year basically was they have everything broken down into stations you see the whole process but yeah I mean the Batman 66 reveal would have been fine the way they did it if they allow people to play the game you know but because right because they did it

[34:53] couldn't you know they that was why that that unveiling kind of got so much flack but crazy two years two years to the date in in a couple weeks the game is still not done in Batman 66

[35:07] well you know it's almost done it's almost done it's it's a little surprising but at the same time I think that you know you'll have been getting some much more frequent updates after that drought of them for the first year

[35:22] and the updates are really counting at this point you know so I think the game that over the long term has been fleshed out so much more than many of the other titles that they've done recently

[35:35] and I think most other game owners could only wish that they would get the kind of updates like the Batman owners are getting yeah I mean Lyman is the best everyone knows it it's no one's even close to him when it comes to making a pinball experience come to life

[35:52] all right so we'll see we only got a couple weeks to expo a question I had what's next for stern right I feel like the rumor mill goes really dry after beetles yes there's like stuff like pulp fiction there's stuff like Godzilla may you know but that just feels like a ways off but what what do you think is going to be next I mean any

[36:14] vault additions of Lord the Rings or tron like we know I've heard nothing no whispers of anything after beetles yeah and I mean you know usually you're pretty pretty good about getting inside information on on what's next or kind of allusions to what's next and I'm with you I haven't heard anything either beyond January with beetles I don't really think the pulp fiction rumors have any merit to them

[36:44] and if there is any truth to it I don't know that that's actually going to be a stern game so I think that there there could be a different route taken with that that nobody's talking about what do you mean but I think you could see another manufacturer do it possibly not not deep fruit but I I'll say I'll say this I wouldn't be surprised if there could still be some other new pinball

[37:14] manufacturers come into the industry with this kind of renaissance that's going on you sound like you know something you know I don't I don't I don't actually know anything but I think that there are other gaming manufacturers that might dip their toes in and I think that you know the the stars kind of align when you when you think about other companies that are out there making a lot of these games that you see in David Busters and like you know

[37:41] bills would make a pinball machine you think I think that there could be a possibility of that and I would be surprised I mean think about they you know companies like raw thrills or ice they've got the manufacturing capabilities in house to do to do games now granted they're not building pinball machines but they've still got assembly lines putting all their machines together they've already got teams in place to you know design games so yeah but I would say that you know making an arcade game

[38:11] is so much different than a pinball machine and also the the David Busters the the people who buy the raw thrills machines you know they're not really the home collector so I don't know we'll see that's an interesting thing to think about now any vault additions Blake you think are going to happen I mean I feel like we've run the last one was what Lucy well I mean I guess technically Star Trek is being I don't know if it's really being run as a vault edition but it's ranked being rerun again you know so because on

[38:40] Stern's website and I meant to mention this on a few shows ago it says Star Trek Vault Edition yeah but then you click over vault and it just goes to like I think pro and premium but but it's not it doesn't carry the name vault

[38:58] yeah that's it's a weird situation with that one and I really I have a hard time considering that a vault edition because they're not making any improvements to the game you know normally a vault edition is a means for making an improvement to the game we're making it different than the original games were in some capacity and I think Star Trek's just really more of a rerun but with that said I do think that we'll see another vault edition next year I think they've kind of made it

[39:26] I think they've made it a habit to release at least one a year you know I think that it's kind of shifted gears a little bit from games that had been you know out of production for a while and there was a new found demand for them being rerun again to now it's kind of like let's just re up a recent license we had and let's rerun it and not really do anything to it but I do I think it's like let's get rid of the parts yeah and that that's probably

[39:54] was demanding a Star Trek now like who doesn't have right wants that yeah that that announced but really really surprised me like I don't understand why Star Trek needed to be rerun there's there's the next movie that may come out from that series is not even being filmed anytime soon so I don't really see the demand for it but it's it's a cut bait on inventory let's move on speaking of production let's move on a Jersey Jack Pimball let's talk about pirates the Caribbean

[40:24] you know we talked about how it's been a year like what are your thoughts on a year from a year ago to today how you think the hype and the demand for this game has been affected by Jack once again making people wait 12 months and people are still not getting the game.

[40:44] Yeah I think it's it's really unfortunate for Jersey Jack that as hard as they're trying to build a really amazing quality game with a lot of unique mechanisms and features that we're wanting to see and like some of the new Sterns.

[41:02] Not being able to produce these games in a time timely manner is it's just it's a killer you know it's the hype's gone on that game and when people see more and more titles come out from Stern that they could buy at a pro level they could buy two machines almost for the price of one parts of the Caribbean it doesn't make the weight worth it at this point and you know it doesn't matter how many how many live streamers.

[41:32] Streams are done weekly of this game with new code and stuff if it's not in the hands of the people that really want to buy it then it feels like it's just kind of falling on deaf ears and you know what I think is a huge mistake that these manufacturers do and then I think of Pimball machine part of the fun is seeing stuff happen for the first time when you do it in your machine right when what I mean by that is all these streams all they do.

[42:02] Is reveal the magic of the game right for you and then you've already seen it like I don't understand like I didn't turn didn't show me holy robin multi ball I got to it on my own and I loved getting there and being for the first time like you know like blown away by like my achievement and and and my curiosity as to what the mode was and I think it's absolutely so stupid.

[42:31] To show people like bits and pieces of the movie throughout an entire year and then by the time the movies released you've seen every scene right yeah no that's that's a really good analogy and and I mean like I really I kind of kind of feel bad for Jersey Jack because there you can tell they're putting so much creativity and effort into these games and they want to make a really great game but not being able to get it out the door is just it sucks because the interest of the game is just so much fun.

[43:01] It does die down and you know like I got a man I was I was in Chicago for expo last year when parts was unveiled and it blew me away it was such a cool game it was it was a really incredible experience playing it they had a lot in the game already that worked you know it wasn't just this really early beta code there was stuff to it and you know everybody was excited the the excitement level at that show was incredible and now that we've got to do it.

[43:31] I mean I've just been waiting and waiting waiting for this game to come out and it and they're finally starting to trickle out at this point you know people don't really care I mean I've my distributor that's in downtown Houston he gets all of the new games as soon as they come out and he got a Deadpool and that pirates machine on the same week and he opened up that Friday night and both games were were there for everybody to check out and I kind of felt bad for people.

[44:01] I mean I was really excited about it either because they didn't really know about it and they didn't really care because it's a title that you know it's face at the license doesn't carry as much weight is it used to about 10 years ago and then also you know there's just a more energy to games like Deadpool and so it's kind of about what's relevant and you know what things visually look like to people so I mean it's done releases

[44:31] pirates of the Caribbean or they reveal it at expo 2017 right three weeks later stern's got hundreds of machines going out to the world right and and by six months every single Ellie and collectors edition order is fulfilled and you know I remember I mean I went in on a collector's edition immediately after expo last year I was like I need this game everyone was like I need to have this game like

[45:01] memory was like a dark day for stern and all right like we all we all got on board with Jack and they jack sank his own ship by he knew they were nowhere near production yeah he knew the game was still in beta form and it was like I the rumor I heard and this is what I heard was at his financial investor was was upset that dialed in sales weren't where they were supposed to be

[45:30] and that hobbit sales were also not where they were supposed to be and Jack had to show him that there was excitement for the next title but in doing so he completely cut off the legs of hobbit and dialed in sales and then couldn't even send people any of these games makes no sense yeah I mean and it's it's a shame in a way because I feel like Jersey Jack is getting so much better with their games with every release dialed in as a fantastic game it shoots incredibly well and you see why I'm not going to do it again.

[46:00] The I amalı is heralded is such a great designer in this industry unfortunately the theme just did not resonate with anybody and it doesn't really have a krizma and energy to it that you want to see and in a lot of these new games

[46:16] pirates is the best shooting Y body that they've built you know it's it's an incredible layout Eric just really built a great game in he shows a ton of promise as a as a young designer

[46:30] It's just the manufacturing.

[46:31] The manufacturing part of it is just so tough.

[46:33] And if you can't get your product out there to people

[46:36] and get it out there, really to the masses,

[46:39] then you're gonna sink, unfortunately.

[46:43] And when speaking of manufacturing,

[46:45] it is interesting and people have been

[46:48] sort of calling this out.

[46:50] When you look at a lot of the pictures

[46:54] and even when Joe from Pinball Star goes there,

[46:58] the assembly line never seems to be as crowded

[47:01] or there never seems to be as many workers at JJP

[47:04] as you think there would be

[47:07] if they're really like full-fledged into production.

[47:10] And I think the question then becomes is,

[47:12] I just don't think Jersey Jack can make many games

[47:14] that quickly and maybe Jack needs to adjust

[47:18] his strategy a bit.

[47:20] Yeah, I mean, I look at what goes into their games

[47:24] and as critical as I wanna be of like the stern machines

[47:29] not having any incredible unique mechanisms in them,

[47:34] I see why they don't do that

[47:36] because at the rate they're cranking games out

[47:39] and keeping an assembly line moving,

[47:41] the more elaborate the game is,

[47:43] the slower it's going to be to try to make that game

[47:45] and try to get all of those parts.

[47:47] You also run into more problems and stuff.

[47:49] And so it's really,

[47:52] it's kind of a catch 22.

[47:54] I mean, the stern wanna keep their line moving

[47:57] and crank out as many games as they can

[47:59] and let's say sacrifice some truly unique,

[48:04] more complicated aspects of it.

[48:07] Or do you go to the Jersey Jack route

[48:08] and you throw everything in there

[48:11] but then it just makes it so much more difficult

[48:13] to try to make it.

[48:14] So it's making millions in Jersey Jack is losing millions.

[48:17] I mean, everyone knows what it is.

[48:19] No one wants to like say it, but that's what's happening.

[48:22] Here's where Jack is,

[48:23] I think this is where he doesn't,

[48:25] their marketing strategy is all wrong.

[48:27] He makes games for the home collector.

[48:30] These are bespoke,

[48:31] like highly detailed,

[48:33] highly complex machines far more than stern is making.

[48:37] He should make less of each model

[48:39] and charge much more for them.

[48:41] And he would still sell them all

[48:44] and he would have less people complaining.

[48:46] He'd also have less pressure to make like 2000 of something

[48:51] make only make 1000 of each title,

[48:54] but Jack the price up and he would still sell everyone.

[48:57] And I don't know why he wants to compete on a volume play

[49:02] when we all know that Jersey Jack games are not good

[49:04] in tournaments and they're not good in our Cades.

[49:08] Yeah, I mean,

[49:09] I feel like that they really would like to get their games,

[49:12] you know, more heavily routed and stuff like that.

[49:14] And the problem is that the games are just too expensive

[49:19] to want to put on a route and have them get torn up

[49:21] and try to keep fixing them over and over again.

[49:25] And yet he really still wants to market them to the collectors.

[49:28] Well, you can't really get word out about your company

[49:32] to the masses if people aren't seeing this game on location.

[49:38] But, you know, they're not gonna want to dump that much money

[49:41] into putting one of those games on location.

[49:43] So it really is, I think the games really just need

[49:47] to be marketed to the collectors, like you said.

[49:49] And you just really try to do that

[49:51] to the best of your ability.

[49:53] So I have an exclusive bit of news

[49:56] that I wanna release about Jersey Jack Pimball

[49:58] that you're gonna hear first.

[50:00] Not on this weekend Pimball,

[50:02] not on head to head Pimball with a big Marty laugh after it.

[50:06] You're gonna hear it here first.

[50:07] So here is what I'm hearing the changes are.

[50:11] And this kind of makes sense.

[50:12] And it's a good segue from what we've been talking about

[50:14] for making something for the masses.

[50:17] The yellow brick road edition of Wizard of Oz

[50:21] that is coming out is going to be a more simplified version

[50:26] of Wizard of Oz.

[50:28] And here's what I'm hearing is gonna happen.

[50:29] They are gonna move the PC to the back box.

[50:33] I think it's underneath the play field now.

[50:36] The boards are gonna be moved to the back box

[50:38] and they're gonna remove, I think some mechanisms

[50:41] from the Wizard of Oz to make a simpler version of it.

[50:45] You know that actually that's very interesting

[50:47] and it makes a lot of sense ironically

[50:50] because I think that would make it a more affordable game

[50:53] and a much more routable game.

[50:56] That would be smart honestly.

[50:58] And it's almost like, man,

[51:00] maybe that should have been done a lot sooner.

[51:02] Given they've seen this game be of really big success

[51:06] for them over many years.

[51:07] So all I can say is it's kind of about time.

[51:11] And then I also heard that they're going to remove a lot

[51:17] of stuff from the Hobbit and re-release it.

[51:19] And it's also gonna,

[51:20] but it's just gonna be the same exact game

[51:22] because the Hobbit has nothing in it to begin with.

[51:25] That talking, the talking,

[51:27] the smog was the biggest issue with the Hobbit.

[51:30] I mean remember like everyone was like the dragon toy

[51:32] is gonna be the thing that wow is everyone

[51:34] and it was a talking puppet.

[51:35] But anyway, let's move on to spooky.

[51:38] So here we are as well.

[51:40] And we're given Jack shit about revealing a game

[51:42] and taking 12 months.

[51:44] Charlie also, colossally I think,

[51:48] fucked up by showing Alice Cooper at TPS eight months ago.

[51:54] Why?

[51:57] Well, I don't know that it was quite as big of a screw up

[52:02] to reveal at the time.

[52:05] We're talking about basically going from March to TPS

[52:09] to the games have started to trickle out around August,

[52:12] I guess.

[52:15] That's not as bad as being revealed at Expo,

[52:17] the previous year, but I do think that the game has certainly,

[52:22] they've put the most into this game of any other machines.

[52:25] And I think that they're trying to still make sure

[52:27] that they can regularly manufacture something

[52:30] that's more elaborate than some of the other games they've built.

[52:33] So I will say that.

[52:35] TNA selling well, right?

[52:37] TNA is the best selling game ever.

[52:38] So he's got that on the line.

[52:40] The one caveat, yeah, is that why do you need the deposit

[52:44] on Alice Cooper like way back in March?

[52:46] That I don't, I don't really know.

[52:49] I really, I don't know, like you said,

[52:52] they could have just kept production on TNA going

[52:54] until they were really ready to get the line going

[52:57] on Alice Cooper.

[52:58] I'm sure they have a reason for it.

[53:00] I don't know what it is.

[53:02] I think that maybe it was just to, once again,

[53:05] I think that there's just kind of a burning desire

[53:07] to generate hype and generate excitement

[53:10] for your company and your product at these big shows.

[53:14] And it works, but it works.

[53:17] But it gets Chuck.

[53:18] And this is Chuck, this is my advice to Chuck,

[53:21] to Robert Mueller, to Dovel.

[53:24] I don't understand how Stern shows you how to do it.

[53:30] They show people, you reveal when you're ready.

[53:34] If you have a game ready to ship close to your reveal,

[53:37] you'll sell everyone, everyone, within a certain number, right?

[53:41] Well, I think anything south of 700,

[53:44] you would probably have orders flooding you

[53:47] and you can get them out the door quickly.

[53:50] I think Charlie wanted to be on the big stage a little bit.

[53:53] I think there's some of that, like I want to,

[53:54] you know, I want to have our moment.

[53:56] T.P.F. is a big show.

[53:58] I definitely think he was anxious and nervous.

[54:01] We saw that at the show.

[54:02] I think he knew the game was like very, very early on.

[54:06] I also think that, to your point,

[54:09] Blake, it doesn't really matter

[54:10] because he's probably sold all 500 spots.

[54:14] But what I'm going to be curious about,

[54:16] and I talk about this a lot, how can you keep people

[54:20] excited over 18 months of production on a game like that?

[54:25] Year and a half from now, before the final one ships out.

[54:30] I think that for starters,

[54:33] the people that are buying spooky games,

[54:35] they're aware of the smaller nature of their company

[54:40] and the assembly line, and they know that there's going

[54:43] to be a way.

[54:44] When they are buying a game from them,

[54:46] they know that there's going to be a way

[54:47] based on the spot they've got.

[54:49] Unlike Jersey Jack, where they've got this big assembly line,

[54:51] and you would expect that they could be cranking these games

[54:54] out at a greater frequency.

[54:56] But with the spooky games,

[54:58] I think when people buy a game from them,

[55:00] they obviously want their game as quickly as they can get it,

[55:04] but they're willing to wait.

[55:07] And they know there's going to be a way.

[55:08] So I think that that's kind of a level of acceptance

[55:13] that people have reconciled with,

[55:17] and they're okay with it.

[55:18] I think the other thing that helps is that

[55:20] spooky is showing that they are cranking games out

[55:24] at a regular frequency.

[55:25] It's obviously not the large numbers that Stern and even

[55:29] Jersey Jack could be cranking out,

[55:31] but they're continuously cranking games out.

[55:34] Unlike just we're not seeing anything come off the line at all.

[55:37] So I think people know they're going to get their game.

[55:41] They just know it may be a little while.

[55:42] Chuck said a hard crossroad for his company

[55:45] because they're growing.

[55:47] And with that, he has to hire more people to make the games,

[55:52] to increase the lines.

[55:53] But when you hire more people, it eats away

[55:56] at your profit per game.

[55:58] And I think he's trying to find that balance.

[56:01] And we'll see what happens.

[56:02] I mean, I think the other interesting thing

[56:05] is going to be no one else in the entire Pimble world

[56:08] has a non-refundable deposit agreement with consumers.

[56:13] And we haven't seen this before.

[56:16] And I'm curious because I think eight months ago,

[56:19] people's desire to lock in was one thing.

[56:23] But once we get the monsters and monster bash remake

[56:28] alongside Alice Cooper, I think people being locked in

[56:32] is a little bit different than being patient.

[56:34] And I don't know how it's going to play out,

[56:36] but I think there are going to be some people

[56:39] that want to bail because they don't want to wait.

[56:41] We'll see what happens there.

[56:42] But they willingly, as I say, they willingly

[56:45] signed the deal with spooky that it was non-refundable.

[56:48] So they can't bitch and mone because they are grown adults

[56:53] who made that deal.

[56:54] Now speaking of competitors, let's talk about the monster bash,

[57:00] monsterly botched reveal that Chicago gaming company.

[57:04] I mean, can they just like fuck this thing up any while?

[57:09] You know, monster bash has been an exhausting process,

[57:16] leading up to the reveal of this game.

[57:18] I think they have a strategy.

[57:20] Or is it just like, I don't know.

[57:22] Well, just NDA.

[57:25] I think they've had some shakeups that maybe they weren't

[57:28] counting on between TPS and now.

[57:32] And that's not even, you know, they've had personal shakeups.

[57:35] They've obviously the game has been a much more elaborate

[57:39] to build than Attack from Mars was.

[57:44] I don't really know why they set an expectation so early on

[57:49] around TPS that, well, one, it was going to be TPS

[57:52] when it was unveiled and then it wasn't.

[57:54] And then they said, oh, no, it's actually just going

[57:56] to be about a month later and then it wasn't.

[58:00] And remember, they didn't even confirm it was monster bash.

[58:04] Then there was just some lame ass thing in like August.

[58:08] I was like, hey, you guys guessed it like monster bat.

[58:10] Like what?

[58:12] Well, they found like the UL certifications online.

[58:16] And then they basically were like, OK, OK, you got us guys.

[58:19] Yeah, it's monster bash.

[58:21] You know, poor, right?

[58:23] Right, it's so easy.

[58:25] Like all you have to do is, you've already established your list

[58:30] of the games that are going to be made.

[58:31] It's just a matter of what order do you go in?

[58:34] And so just a mistake too.

[58:36] That was, I just think that was a, that was just like a move

[58:39] by them to freeze the prices of those games

[58:44] in the used market.

[58:46] Yeah.

[58:47] But I mean, it's like they've already basically said,

[58:51] we're not going to be making these hugely dramatic changes

[58:55] to these games.

[58:57] It's going to be more cosmetic things

[58:59] that just add to the experience, you know,

[59:01] like the toppers and maybe a better light show and stuff.

[59:05] And so I don't understand why there hasn't been these,

[59:09] trickling of teasers that could be building the hype

[59:15] to your company over what's getting out there.

[59:19] And there's not just this radio silence where you're just

[59:22] in a vacuum.

[59:23] And it makes people antsy and it makes people want to see

[59:26] what's going on, especially when you've told them,

[59:28] hey, we're going to show you what's going on soon

[59:30] and never comes.

[59:31] So I also think there's strategies flawed and I'll explain why.

[59:36] These games are classics, right?

[59:38] They're making the games that, if you were to buy,

[59:41] let's say, like a hep restored version of these games,

[59:44] they easily all sell for north of $10,000.

[59:49] 1,000 limited editions of these titles, I think,

[59:53] is a mistake.

[59:54] I also think they should look at stuff

[59:55] like metallic foil decals, you know, for the cabinets.

[59:59] Like they could take it further and make smaller numbers

[01:00:04] of these games for the collector, like whether it's

[01:00:07] a limited edition or collector's edition,

[01:00:09] charge a lot more and they would get it.

[01:00:13] I know again, and I think by saying 1,000

[01:00:16] alleys of Montsew Bash, it's not an alleys.

[01:00:20] And I think they're, I think they're

[01:00:21] going to start to struggle to sell a thousand of these

[01:00:25] when the supply is so high.

[01:00:27] I do.

[01:00:29] Well, I mean, I sell out of the tech from Mars.

[01:00:32] I don't think so.

[01:00:33] I don't know.

[01:00:35] I actually do not know.

[01:00:36] I think that if you just absolutely wanted to get an

[01:00:41] attack from Mars, Ellie, right now, you know,

[01:00:44] two years, almost two years later, or a year and a half later,

[01:00:48] then I think you can still get one, you know.

[01:00:49] It's not like they're just unobtainium.

[01:00:53] Right.

[01:00:54] So yeah, I mean, 1,000 does seem high.

[01:00:57] I think that they're banking on the popularity

[01:01:00] from Montsew Bash is even higher than it was for attack from Mars.

[01:01:06] So I think that they're really hoping to appeal to the horror

[01:01:10] fan base and people that maybe were not aware of this game

[01:01:13] when it was brand new, you know, 25 years ago.

[01:01:17] So we'll see.

[01:01:18] The timing is so interesting too, you know, you got to figure

[01:01:22] if they did start manufacturing this game at TPS,

[01:01:25] they've got no competition in this genre.

[01:01:29] Now they're coming out against monsters.

[01:01:32] At the same exact time as how this Cooper will be going into

[01:01:35] production.

[01:01:35] I mean, it's fun.

[01:01:36] I love watching these three spooky theme titles,

[01:01:39] like battle it out for monsters of primacy.

[01:01:43] I still think that people will always gravitate

[01:01:45] towards a new experience.

[01:01:47] So if Borg and Dwight and Franchie deliver a stunning new

[01:01:54] version of monsters, I think there's going to be more

[01:01:57] excitement for that.

[01:01:58] And again, and again, I say it too, because as cool as

[01:02:02] Montsew Bash is, I think people have realized

[01:02:05] that all of the code from those games back in the day

[01:02:09] is very, very shallow.

[01:02:10] And there's only so much you can enjoy long term with those

[01:02:16] games, because they were never meant to be in home

[01:02:18] collections.

[01:02:19] They need modernized code, I think, to make them fun for

[01:02:25] years and years and years.

[01:02:26] And that's just my take on those classics.

[01:02:29] Yeah, yeah, it's, I agree with you.

[01:02:32] I mean, I think that's the biggest aspect of this whole

[01:02:36] release of this game that I just shake my head at.

[01:02:39] They had, they had an, no pun intended, they had an open

[01:02:43] play field from March until now to be selling monster

[01:02:48] bashes, just selling tons of them, because it's honestly

[01:02:52] been a fairly quiet summer in terms of games.

[01:02:54] You know, we've had, we've had two storm releases, and

[01:02:58] that's really about it.

[01:02:59] And so it really, it was a huge missed opportunity

[01:03:05] to not have monster bash go out around TpF time frame.

[01:03:10] And going ahead to head with the monsters, while monster

[01:03:14] bash is still a very strong game, and there will be, you

[01:03:17] know, people that prefer the traditional games over the

[01:03:21] new stuff, there's going to be more excitement for the

[01:03:25] monsters.

[01:03:26] And I think that that is definitely going to cut into

[01:03:30] monster bash sales.

[01:03:31] Absolutely.

[01:03:32] And I'm also just disappointed that

[01:03:35] with all the time they've had, they couldn't add in a new

[01:03:38] motor to just to, just to put a little cherry on top of it.

[01:03:42] But that's a lineman sheets game, right?

[01:03:46] I want to say it is, yeah.

[01:03:48] Okay.

[01:03:49] Old lineman sheets, different than new lineman sheets.

[01:03:52] He's got a different approach now.

[01:03:54] Still, still gets good with age though, you know?

[01:03:56] Oh, yeah, still, still classic.

[01:03:58] Look, I still think that monster bash is going to make, it's

[01:04:00] going to be hard for monsters in terms of like a

[01:04:03] mechanism in toys and things to hit and bash and movement and

[01:04:07] magic.

[01:04:08] I think it's going to be really hard for monsters to even

[01:04:11] compete on that level.

[01:04:12] So we'll see, I heard monsters has a lower play field, but

[01:04:16] we'll see what they put into that game.

[01:04:17] I've not seen anything on in terms of monsters play field, lay

[01:04:22] out or toys.

[01:04:23] I do know this though.

[01:04:25] I do know this.

[01:04:27] And this is the stuff that Stern hates me to talk about.

[01:04:29] But I do know that Borg wanted more in the game and they wanted

[01:04:33] to make an SLE version of the monsters to put more stuff in it.

[01:04:37] And he was overruled because again, Stern is driven by the bomb

[01:04:43] and not by allowing their designers to do everything they want.

[01:04:46] And I keep saying this, these guys are very creative.

[01:04:48] It's not that they don't want stuff in these games.

[01:04:50] They're told they can't put the stuff in.

[01:04:53] So speaking of a company that's taking the opposite approach, which is

[01:04:58] let's put as much as we can.

[01:05:01] Let's let creativity flow.

[01:05:04] Let's let innovation run free.

[01:05:06] Let's blow up the Bally Williams sort of error where like each game was

[01:05:12] designed and private and let's collaborate and make the best

[01:05:15] pinball ever deep route.

[01:05:18] That is the promise.

[01:05:20] That is what Robert Mueller is on a mission to do.

[01:05:22] And we know that there's been a citizen of the pinball community,

[01:05:28] Jeff over at this, we can pinball visit it deep route.

[01:05:31] Lots of hype here, Blake.

[01:05:33] Lots of like, you know, multiple games being worked on 80s themes.

[01:05:39] Like is it back to the future?

[01:05:40] Is it die hard?

[01:05:42] What do you?

[01:05:43] What are your thoughts?

[01:05:45] Like all of this is just like curiosity needs like my imagination.

[01:05:51] There's no, we don't have anything really hard to go on.

[01:05:54] Yeah.

[01:05:55] It's, um, well, I mean, I'm kind of like in the same boat.

[01:05:59] You are my curiosity is absolutely peaked with what these guys are doing.

[01:06:04] I think that we have, we've now gotten past the point where it was just this

[01:06:09] mysterious logo and bare bones website that popped up, you know, one day and

[01:06:15] everybody's thinking this can't be real.

[01:06:17] This is, you know, this has just got to be some, some fake, you know, venture.

[01:06:23] I think that, you know, Robert has, um, he certainly set the, the bar.

[01:06:29] Hi.

[01:06:29] In terms of the way he's talked about what they're trying to do.

[01:06:33] I, I'm really interested to see what these guys are working on.

[01:06:37] And, and I, I will say that I think that, you know, he's, uh, I, I appreciate him

[01:06:44] trying to do some different things.

[01:06:46] And I'm curious to see how are they going to try to do mechanisms and manufacturing

[01:06:51] different?

[01:06:51] How are they, uh, how are they going to integrate LCD technology differently?

[01:06:55] Because it sounds like that's something that's, um, that's going to be taken

[01:06:59] a different approach with.

[01:07:01] And, um, uh, I think that, you know, he's spoken very highly of what they're

[01:07:07] working on and the expectations are going to be very high.

[01:07:10] He knows the criticism is going to be very high when they unveil their

[01:07:14] stuff given, you know, you know, John Papaducson involvement and some of the

[01:07:20] other drama surrounding the company.

[01:07:23] But I'll say this, he's, he's obviously gotten, you know, a really good team of

[01:07:28] people together.

[01:07:29] It sounds like it's a good mixture of, you know, veteran designers and artists

[01:07:34] as well as a lot of fresh blood in there.

[01:07:37] And, um, you know, I don't think the guys full of shit.

[01:07:40] I think that they really are working on something pretty interesting.

[01:07:44] Um, and I, I would, uh, I would be very curious to see what, what

[01:07:50] approach they're taking.

[01:07:51] Uh, I'm the, the theme that they say that they've gotten, the 80s theme.

[01:07:57] Um, I, I'd love to think that it's back to the future because I think that's

[01:08:02] a theme that, uh, personally, I would like to see made again.

[01:08:05] A lot of people would, but at the same time, I really want to make sure that

[01:08:09] these guys can produce an amazing game and do a theme like that justice,

[01:08:14] you know, so I hope, uh, I hope they can follow through.

[01:08:18] Uh, I, I would love to, you know, I'd love to see their facility.

[01:08:21] They're right down the road from me.

[01:08:22] You know, they're over in San Antonio and, um, you know, from an artistic

[01:08:27] standpoint, I'd love to see how they're going to incorporate modern technology

[01:08:31] with, uh, you know, beautiful classic artwork.

[01:08:35] So yeah, and Robert, I mean, he, when we talk, he, he loves the value

[01:08:41] Williams era and then he's, he's inspired by that to bring that back to

[01:08:46] Pimble and there was, we, we don't have much to go on.

[01:08:50] I mean, T P F is really going to be the moment where we see the five days of

[01:08:54] deep route. Um, I, you know, curious to see what they talk about at Expo,

[01:08:59] because they're going to be there and they're, you know, are they going to

[01:09:02] show stuff? Are they going to tease stuff?

[01:09:04] Are, I mean, it's, it's, it's going to be Robert moderating, uh, a panel

[01:09:09] discussion of his employees, going to be someone interesting to see how that

[01:09:13] unfolds. Um, I, I think the thing is this, and this is my, this is what I'm

[01:09:18] curious about. Uh, they're making,

[01:09:20] a lot of titles at once. And, you know, you know, we know how hard it is to

[01:09:25] just get one Pimble machine to market, let alone like three, four, five,

[01:09:30] um, you know, octo manufacturing aside, um, they've never manufactured a game

[01:09:35] before ever. Uh, and there's a lot that goes into that. A lot of, a lot of,

[01:09:39] there's a lot more that, that is required from prototype to manufacturing.

[01:09:44] And I think that chasm is the piece of the puzzle that I think always trips

[01:09:51] up all these new companies. You know, like, look at Dutch, they made a big

[01:09:56] lebalski machine that was freaking incredible that everybody wanted to buy.

[01:10:01] And they, but really what they brought to, uh, TPS for Expo that first year

[01:10:07] was a prototype of a fully built game. And I think, you know, it's one thing

[01:10:13] for deep route to make the prototype version of a game. But what happens

[01:10:18] when 500 people order it or 1000 people order it? How do you overnight turn

[01:10:25] into a mass producer of Pimble machines? And that's the part that I think

[01:10:30] trips people up. I hope they're successful at it. I don't know how you go

[01:10:34] about setting up a modern day, innovative new way of creating an assembly line

[01:10:42] for Pimble that can satiate the demand that will come to your door.

[01:10:47] If you do make it back to the future Pimble machine, because if he does,

[01:10:51] we know there'll be a thousand orders in one day. Oh, absolutely. You know,

[01:10:55] or more. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, I'm curious. I'm also curious to see Mr.

[01:11:00] John Papaduke in person again. And to just hear him speak,

[01:11:05] it's always entertaining because John, once again, I guarantee you,

[01:11:10] he will not take responsibility for what he did. He will, he will say that this

[01:11:15] is what he always needed. He will. He's a mad scientist. I don't even,

[01:11:19] I would never, I would never even bring J pop into the public. I think J pop

[01:11:24] to me is like the Wizard of Oz. He always needs to be behind the curtain.

[01:11:29] This second you let him out. You know, he's like, you know, like in Walt Disney

[01:11:34] World, there, you know, there's like the area underneath Walt Disney World.

[01:11:36] We're all the costume characters change. So you never see them take off.

[01:11:39] They're masked. John needs to just be like in a, I just want to know that

[01:11:43] John Papaduke is locked in a basement at deep root,

[01:11:47] cooking up crazy, pimple ideas. If you just pull me that, I'd be happy.

[01:11:52] Once you put him out in public, I don't think it does any good.

[01:11:57] I think he's also going to, you know, like do we think the angry mob of people

[01:12:02] who lost money on Raza is going to like be there? Cause in his,

[01:12:06] if history shows us anything, people talk so tough.

[01:12:09] But at the shows, they let these people off the hook left and right.

[01:12:12] Right. Yeah. No, I don't, I don't think there's going to be an angry mob.

[01:12:15] And I think that part of, you know, Robert's motivation for wanting to,

[01:12:20] to moderate this panel is so he can kind of control, you know,

[01:12:24] what gets directed to John or those types of comments.

[01:12:28] I think it also will allow them to spin any negative criticism they might

[01:12:33] get into something more positive about what they're doing now.

[01:12:37] So, you know, at this point, it will never change the fact that,

[01:12:44] a lot of people got screwed out of their money and, and what John did was incredibly

[01:12:48] wrong, especially in how it was all handled.

[01:12:51] I feel like now it's just a matter of let's see what they can do.

[01:12:55] And I don't know that he necessarily deserves to be praised for whatever they

[01:13:02] end up cranking out on these games, especially after, you know,

[01:13:06] everybody getting screwed over.

[01:13:08] I think that Robert and some of the rest of the team probably would deserve that

[01:13:12] praise at that point.

[01:13:13] Looking back on it all to, it's hard not to feel like people were also incredibly

[01:13:19] stupid for giving John Papaduke like the blank checks they gave him.

[01:13:25] Without seeing anything. I mean, imagine, let's think about it like this.

[01:13:29] Imagine if tomorrow, let's say Steve Richie just leaves stern and says,

[01:13:37] I'm making a new game.

[01:13:40] Give me $16,000.

[01:13:41] Like, I don't have a company.

[01:13:43] I don't have like, you know, that's all John did.

[01:13:47] Like he didn't.

[01:13:48] Yeah.

[01:13:48] He was just a designer without a team, without a company, without a manufacturing

[01:13:54] facility and people gave him money.

[01:13:57] Like on some level, like lesson learned, it sucks.

[01:14:02] But I also think there's going to be a point where and we're seeing it now.

[01:14:07] We're, you know, you were also to blame for putting your faith in this dude.

[01:14:12] And he just bit off way more than he can chew.

[01:14:14] And when you look at it now, at some point, we just need to like move past it.

[01:14:20] I mean, I don't know.

[01:14:21] You can't just keep crucifying this dude because he, yeah, he did a stupid move.

[01:14:27] But it was also equally stupid to put faith in a guy who had never manufactured a damn thing in his life.

[01:14:33] And I think everyone in the hobby has, has learned a lot of lessons,

[01:14:37] whether it's from John or Dutch or Andrew Highway, about the reality of Pimble.

[01:14:44] Speaking of that, let's talk about, we got a couple more minutes.

[01:14:47] Then I got to go see a movie.

[01:14:48] I'm going to go see that new Nicholas Cage movie, Mandy.

[01:14:51] Oh, I've heard it's crazy.

[01:14:53] Yeah, I can't wait.

[01:14:54] Let's talk about the artwork that we saw from Brian Allen on Facebook this week about the queen artwork he was working on.

[01:15:03] And I just showed it with you, Blake.

[01:15:05] My thought is when I look at it, it looks like Renin Stimpy.

[01:15:11] Yeah, it's, it's very interesting.

[01:15:14] I think that, I don't really know and, and when this artwork was generated,

[01:15:21] but it just, it really looks a lot like Aros Smith.

[01:15:24] It looks like what Dirty Donnie's done in the past and that they were kind of trying to tap into that sort of edgy,

[01:15:31] but cartoonish style.

[01:15:35] I think I don't really know that this style works with the type of music that Queen's made, though.

[01:15:42] I just, I don't know that, that this is the right vibe that I get when I listen to, to their music.

[01:15:48] I think it's a really cool piece of artwork.

[01:15:50] It's very technically well done, a great line working everything, but I think Queen is more stylized,

[01:15:58] almost a little bit more like sophisticated and, and jellic in a way like it's not.

[01:16:04] Yes, this is, this, this feels like, and also like that comic-y style of rock band,

[01:16:13] that works well for t-shirts, but it's not really what should be in the pinball game if I want to,

[01:16:19] like, remember Queen.

[01:16:21] I feel like, I feel like one thing that like Dirty Donnie did with Metallica and, and Aros Smith is that he,

[01:16:28] he made the band's look cool in a pop culture, a very pop art edgy kind of way.

[01:16:36] This image, I don't feel like really makes, you know, Brian May and Freddie Mercury look

[01:16:42] at flattering, honestly.

[01:16:44] Like you said, it's, they were a little bit more of a sophisticated band in a way.

[01:16:51] They were very symphonic in how they composed their music, and I mean, you're talking about a

[01:16:56] band full of guys that had PhDs and stuff, and, and so I, I feel like that the style of this kind

[01:17:04] of misses the mark in terms of the theme itself, and the, you know, who the band is.

[01:17:10] When I, when I hear Queen music, I don't think of skulls and all that kind of stuff, you know.

[01:17:14] Right. No, definitely not.

[01:17:18] How many months before Home Pin goes out of business?

[01:17:23] Oh, man, are you telling me that, you know, people aren't just chomping at the bit to get their

[01:17:28] Thunderbirds machine? I mean, come on, it looks like a fantastic game. Oh my god.

[01:17:34] It's crazy too, because it's only $5,000, but it's to release a game like that at 5,000,

[01:17:39] and people are like, it still doesn't feel worth it, is, is like a nail in the coffin, and,

[01:17:45] and watching Mike and Wayne battle each other on Pinside is, is, is, is the greatest spectacle on

[01:17:51] Pinside these days. Yeah, you know, I'll say this. I mean, I actually don't think that Thunderbirds

[01:17:58] looks like that bad of a game, and I feel like there was a lot of thought that was put into the game,

[01:18:04] and, uh, five years in the make-game, of course.

[01:18:06] Well, right, right, exactly. Exactly. So I don't, I don't want to, you know, as a creative person,

[01:18:11] I don't ever want to sell somebody short on the creativity they've put into things, because it's,

[01:18:16] you know, it's hard to, to be creative and come up with fresh things all the time. And so,

[01:18:22] it's, it's easy to sit back and criticize other people's, you know, artwork and stuff like that,

[01:18:26] and I don't think that that's always a great thing to do, but, but I'll say this. I mean,

[01:18:33] you know, if the game doesn't really shoot that well, then I think there absolutely

[01:18:37] bit should have been more thought put into the whitewood, and, you know, if there ever, you've

[01:18:41] been, was a whitewood for that game. And, you know, the actual things that make a game function

[01:18:47] properly. So it's, it's been an interesting experiment. I'll say that. Um, you know, I'm,

[01:18:53] I'm actually kind of surprised that considering Mike was so adamant about these games not making

[01:18:59] their way over to the US, that, you know, one of them's going to be at the Chicago show, it sounds

[01:19:03] like, and that they, they are trickling over here. And, you know, he needs sales over here to be good.

[01:19:10] It sounds like he's, he's kind of burned the Australian market. And that was the primary target

[01:19:15] audience for that machine. So, um, he's burned every market and he's burning every good will with

[01:19:21] the company he can possibly burn. And I mean, look, we predicted it. Let's, let's just for the record

[01:19:27] state that every single company that can a dispimble podcast has predicted will go out of Pimble

[01:19:32] Business has gone out of Pimble Business. You know, I'm, I'm, I'm batting 100% a thousand

[01:19:39] percent for this. They, they will go out of business. It is just a matter of how many months.

[01:19:43] I would say they get a couple hundred hundred, hundred, hundred birds out the door and they,

[01:19:47] they're done. They're done. There's no, we don't need these guys. We, a stir can give you an

[01:19:53] incredible machine for just a few hundred dollars more that they'll stand behind. That will be a

[01:19:58] better theme that will like last the test of time. I mean, one thing that I want to say and I,

[01:20:04] and I know I've been rough on Stern because I want to see them have more in the game. And I know

[01:20:09] they listen to this podcast. I'll say this. I've had Batman 66 now for over a year. I've enjoyed it.

[01:20:15] I play it all the time. Looks brand new with a play field protector. I have not had a single thing

[01:20:22] in this game break or go down or be a headache. I had one node board that had to be replaced.

[01:20:28] But I'll say this. They build games that last. I mean, I, I'm not like Roto Dave throwing my

[01:20:35] cabinet around the apartment. So I'm cracking the cabinet. I don't have cabinet protectors. My

[01:20:40] cabinet's fine. The games are, they, they, they don't break down. The first time I played

[01:20:47] Pirates of the Caribbean on location, I step up to the game and three things are broken.

[01:20:52] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I'm with you. I've been a little critical of wanting to maybe

[01:20:58] see a little bit more put into Stern machines. But I will say that they have a system that

[01:21:03] absolutely works well. And, and they know that. And sometimes you don't really want to screw

[01:21:08] you with something that works well. And for as simplistic as some of their games might be

[01:21:14] sometimes and as much as we, we want to see these mechanisms, I understand why they build their

[01:21:19] games the way they do, why they try to make them as efficient as possible, but yet reliable. And

[01:21:25] they, they certainly have developed an overall experience that's really great with their machines

[01:21:32] in the last few years between the art packages, the music, the call outs. It's, it's all been very,

[01:21:38] very well done. And I still find myself having the most fun playing their machines of all of the

[01:21:44] new games that are out there. Yeah. I mean, that's what it's, it gives me to say yes, but it's true.

[01:21:50] Like as much as like, I want there to be more, it's hard to, there's not a single Jersey Jack

[01:21:57] machine that is as much fun as like the modern Sterns. There's not anyone else that means Boogie

[01:22:02] doesn't add up to that. And it's, it's, it's just the way it is, you know, and I think if we can get

[01:22:09] some competitors to get them to put a little bit more in, it's almost like, it sucks because if a

[01:22:14] competitor does push Stern into putting a little bit more in, they will put that competitor out of

[01:22:19] business immediately Stern. Right. So it's like, it's like, that's why I think the only white space

[01:22:24] in Pimball is not to compete with Stern on a volume level. It's, it's small run, boutique games that

[01:22:30] are high end that are really doing magical stuff. Like if you're going to put smoke and sparks and

[01:22:36] flames into games like deep root is like people are saying, you can't sell 2,000 of them and compete

[01:22:42] with Stern because you'll never be able to manufacture a complex Pimball machine. I don't think so.

[01:22:46] Maybe I'll be proven wrong. Yeah. The way Stern does it. So like anything else, I know there's

[01:22:52] a show going on that you want to plug down in Texas, but what's, what's the, what's on your mind

[01:22:58] otherwise? Oh man. Well, yeah, we've, we've got the Houston Arcade Expo coming up October 19th and

[01:23:04] 20th, which is the exact same time as the Chicago Expo. But this is, yeah, it's a great show. I've

[01:23:13] been involved with it for the last couple of years and we, we're really growing the show tremendously

[01:23:19] this year. We're moving into a new hotel. We're doubling the size of the show that it's been. So

[01:23:25] we're going to be filling about 24,000 square feet this year and it's just a, it's a no drama,

[01:23:33] absolutely just party arcade atmosphere for an entire weekend and it's a, it's a hell of a fun show.

[01:23:40] It's, we do a lot of music and it sounds like deep root should send John Papadu to that show.

[01:23:47] And then the rest of the teams should go to Expo. Well, yeah, we actually asked deep root to come

[01:23:53] to our show. We, we did ask to see if they would like to have a presence and they opted to just go

[01:24:00] to Chicago. So we, we do hope that they'll come give our show a chance another year maybe, but

[01:24:08] I'll say this, you know, our show, it's not an industry show. It doesn't pretend to be an industry

[01:24:12] show. It's just basically a fun pinball on arcade show. And sometimes I think that's what really

[01:24:19] counts the most with these shows. It's not about, oh well, you know, we're going to have this many

[01:24:24] vendors and we're going to, you know, we've got all the big title, you know, companies and games

[01:24:28] there. It's about sometimes just trying to, to turn a weekend into an old arcade 80s experience

[01:24:36] again, you know, kind of like the good old days. And that's really what we aim to do with this show.

[01:24:40] We've got over 300 games and live music and a lot of seminars and other, you know, artists and

[01:24:47] vendors. So, you know, it's a great, affordable show that, you know, won't break the bank. You

[01:24:54] can bring your family and not have to spend that much money. So I hope that one year people

[01:25:00] will give our show a chance. We, we actually had our date set before all of the drama with the

[01:25:06] Chicago show this year and it just turned out that, you know, they kept their date and they're still

[01:25:12] trying to get this show put together. But, you know, our show has no drama associated with it.

[01:25:17] We've been doing it for a long time and so hopefully we'll get some more people to come down

[01:25:23] another year. The room rates are $89 a night there. You know, over half the price of what the rooms

[01:25:28] in Chicago cost. And so it's, it's overall, it's just a great experience. And I think people

[01:25:34] would be very surprised if they come down and give Houston a chance one year. Definitely.

[01:25:38] That never materialized the whole like fracturing expo into two shows. Remember there was like,

[01:25:44] what I'm going to do a show like on my own. Remember they were supposed to like split it into two

[01:25:48] shows. The other one never happened. Did it? No, no, I don't know. I've been following the pinball

[01:25:53] expo thread on, on Pinside, but they've, there's some legal matters going on. It sounds like between

[01:26:00] Rob and Mike and they were the two guys who were co-owning and running that show for many years.

[01:26:07] And now Rob is basically taken over and you know, they're still going to make it happen.

[01:26:13] And I guess the major manufacturers are still going to support them. I wish him the best. I don't,

[01:26:19] I don't want to see any show fail, but I mean, they've obviously got some things to work out.

[01:26:23] And I think that they definitely are trying, you know, a fresh approach a little bit.

[01:26:29] You know, so I wish them all the best of luck. And I hope that our shows can coincide, you know,

[01:26:36] in the future. And people will give both of them a chance. But anyways, it's a final question, Blake,

[01:26:43] then I got to run. Do you think they will sell more than 10 founders editions of the mafia pinball?

[01:26:56] Have they sold one yet? I guess it would be my question.

[01:27:00] I think, I think Hilton McDingo put in an order for a while, but we're still trying to confirm his

[01:27:05] identity. Hey, I'm I am all about supporting new manufacturers. Anybody that wants to try to make a

[01:27:11] pinball machine and actually can manufacture it and not take anybody's money before they can

[01:27:16] ship a game. I'm all for it. But you know, you've got to be realistic about what you're offering

[01:27:21] people for the price point. And you know, not to knock their game. But if it's that simplistic of

[01:27:27] a game and it's still that expensive, it's going to be a hard sell. So it's like trying to sell

[01:27:32] someone a $5 bill for 20 bucks. Yeah. Come on guys. Like they they they saw the market. I mean,

[01:27:40] I I give them credit for using their own dime to make this sure happen. But sure. I mean, on some level,

[01:27:47] my mom always says common sense is the most important skill you can have in life. And common

[01:27:53] sense tells me there is nothing that they could have seen that would indicate people would spend

[01:28:00] $7,500 on a single level mafia game where the mafia boss is wearing a 10 gallon cowboy hat.

[01:28:11] Okay. You know what? I think I think that really a big takeaway from this right now is that we're

[01:28:17] at a point in this hobby in the industry where every machine that every manufacturer makes has to

[01:28:23] count. You have got to be you've got to make something that people absolutely have to have. Because

[01:28:30] if you you can't just make a game that is decent and hey, please give our game a chance. It's got

[01:28:37] to be something that people want to drop money on. You know, as as big of a problem as that has been

[01:28:43] with the J pop games and Dutch pinball and all this stuff, you know, they were making games that

[01:28:48] people really, really wanted, but obviously they couldn't make them. You've got over 20 new

[01:28:54] inbox options. If I want to buy a game today, there are over 20 new inbox games I can go choose from.

[01:29:02] And you're going to so you're so if you're coming out new, you've got to convince people to not

[01:29:07] buy one of those games available now in a box and buy your game. That's right. I mean, when I was

[01:29:14] designing the artwork for Cosmic Chaos for TPL last year or for this year, you know, that that game,

[01:29:21] we never were sure if that game would ever possibly be made, but I designed every aspect of what we

[01:29:29] were doing for marketing and for the cabinet that was there as if that could be a real game. And I

[01:29:34] tried to design it in a way that people would really want to have that game. Is it even though it

[01:29:40] may never exist? I have no news on that. Basically, there's been no discussion of Cosmic Chaos

[01:29:47] and if that game will ever be made, unfortunately, I think it could be a really cool game. I think

[01:29:52] that we came up with a great art package for it and it's got a neat story behind it. But so far,

[01:29:59] yeah, I haven't been contacted about it. I'd love to see it if somebody wants to make it.

[01:30:04] It reminds me a little bit and well, it's not the same thing, but it's like those dudes who showed

[01:30:08] us their kingpin that they're remaking and then they like, they just go silent for like

[01:30:14] years, like on these intentions. I just don't think that kind of stuff will work. You know,

[01:30:20] you sold people's translates, now you owe them a game and it's like you didn't even finish

[01:30:24] Pimbal Circus and you're on to the second one and it's like, you know, this whole error of like,

[01:30:33] don't show your game until you can make the game. Like, and I mean, like make the game like in a

[01:30:40] couple months, not like in a couple years. Like, it's so stupid. Imagine if I walked in a work

[01:30:45] in any job, hey boss, here's an idea for three years from now. Pay me today. Maybe like,

[01:30:52] get the fuck out of here, Chris. Right. Right. You know, we need to make our clients happy like,

[01:30:57] today. And that's what a lot of these Pimbal people do is like, they want, they want to get

[01:31:02] padded on the back for future intentions. And I just, I don't think they deserve it. Like,

[01:31:08] show me it when it's done. And that's why, you know, we never, ever like, cosmic, what we did with

[01:31:14] cosmic chaos was even though we put an art package together for a cabinet, there was never any

[01:31:19] intention to necessarily make a game. I just designed everything as an artist as if there could be

[01:31:25] a game for it. You know, so we never, we never sold trans lights. We never showed off a cabinet,

[01:31:31] you know, with the, you know, commitment that that was going to be turned into a game at some point.

[01:31:36] It would be cool if it ever happened. But yeah, we were never going to over promise anything.

[01:31:41] Right. Well, I think we covered them all. We didn't talk about October fest now that I think

[01:31:46] about it. But do you want to just tell me real quick, Blake, like your thoughts are and how well

[01:31:50] you think October fest will do in the market? It better be one hell of a spectacular game is all I

[01:31:57] can say because, you know, if, if they're going after the, the brewery crowds to try to put these

[01:32:04] games in those kind of venues, then they're going to really have to count on the distributors and

[01:32:10] themselves to get the word out to these breweries about that game. Because otherwise, I think it's

[01:32:15] going to be a tough sell. And I don't, I don't want to say that it can't be a great game. I think

[01:32:20] that any theme when done right can be a great game. But it's definitely not a game that everybody

[01:32:27] was asking for, you know? So I'm excited to see it because I'm excited about any new game that

[01:32:33] gets put out there. But I hope it's really something special. Yeah, I hope to talk to their sales

[01:32:42] and marketing guys soon. And yeah, I look forward to seeing it. We only have a couple weeks and

[01:32:46] we're going to see it. I think until then, I think everyone agrees that this is not a take my

[01:32:52] money now theme by any means. But, but if it, you know, if it shoots well, and I think that's

[01:33:00] the thing too is like, Houdini just doesn't shoot well. And everyone knows that they rush, they had

[01:33:04] a rush that game out. There was no whitewood. The shots are too tight. It's a great theme. But again,

[01:33:10] I think it, you know, people don't want to be frustrated. They want Pimbal to be fun. And I think

[01:33:15] Houdini just overly frustrates people. So I think they, they're going to learn that lesson. This is a

[01:33:20] new company. But this is the key game, though. The soft mark title on a new company is everything.

[01:33:28] It, you know, because people forget that the hobbit bank rubbed like bank rubbed it, Jersey

[01:33:33] Jack Pimbal. The orders didn't come in. The game wasn't good. They couldn't afford to make it.

[01:33:40] They struggled to get the second game off the ground. Same thing with Alan saying, you know,

[01:33:45] it's like, if you can't get your second title down right, it's going to make it really hard to

[01:33:51] have a future. So I hope they figure it out. And we'll see in a couple weeks. But Blake, thank

[01:33:55] you so much for taking the time to talk to us. We will get this up early this week. And we'll talk soon.

[01:34:02] Absolutely, man. It's always fun. Glad to talk to you. All right. Later Blake. All right. See you.
