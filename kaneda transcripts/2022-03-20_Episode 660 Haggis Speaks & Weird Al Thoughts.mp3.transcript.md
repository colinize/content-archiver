[00:00] Oh wow, there must be something in the water this weekend because we finally got an update

[00:17] from Haggis Pinball, we got to see Weird Owl from Multimorphic, we're gonna talk about

[00:22] both of those things right now, but you know me, this is a great time to be in Pinball

[00:26] because you've got these games, you've got the New Jersey Jack Pinball Machine just around

[00:32] the corner somewhere in May or June, then you've got TPF this weekend, we've got the

[00:37] Twippy's coming up, but let's jump right to it, so we got to see an update from Haggis

[00:42] Pinball, and this is all I've ever wanted, I want them to communicate, I want them to

[00:47] tell us what is going on over at Haggis, how close are owners of Fathom to getting their

[00:53] games, now we still don't know that answer, we're gonna talk about that, but let's talk

[00:57] about what we did see, we got Damien and we got Marty to show us the new Fathom code they

[01:04] have been working on, and I want to say this about this game because I think people think

[01:08] I'm incapable of saying something nice about Haggis Pinball and that's not true, I'm just

[01:13] keeping this company accountable, this game is gorgeous by the way, it is gorgeous, this

[01:18] is one of the most beautiful pinball machines of all time, and now it looks even better,

[01:24] the play field looks like glass, the back glass is actually glass, it's like mirrored

[01:31] chrome glass, and Damien talks about how hard it is to source these parts and to make these

[01:38] things up to their standard of quality, and I mean it when I say this, people who have

[01:43] seen Kelts in person, it is probably one of the best screwed together games in all of

[01:49] pinball, so the quality is there, the beauty is there, the music is super cool, it's like

[01:56] this 80s sort of vibe sort of feel going on with the game and I really like it, I think

[02:01] the new code set is gonna give people more depth to this game, I like the two screens

[02:06] on the aprons, everything about this package is super super sexy, but the main question

[02:13] still remains, when are people going to get their fathoms, we did not see any people inside

[02:21] the factory, we did not see any parts, we did not see any manufacturing, he did tell

[02:27] us that Kelts production has ceased and now they will move on to fathom manufacturing,

[02:33] but it is mid-March people, and that's the only thing, it's not about whether or not

[02:38] this game is sexy, it's not about whether or not the code is any good, it's about one

[02:44] simple fact, do you think they can survive this long with this many delays and get 4-5

[02:52] games manufactured, they're in it now, like they're in it for the long run and I hope

[02:57] they get it done, I've always said this, I hope Haggis gets it done, I just don't know

[03:02] how you recover from so many months of inactivity and so many months of no money coming in,

[03:10] how do you not rob Peter to pay Paul when you have that many months and no games are

[03:16] on the line, it's gotta be super difficult, but we will see what happens, but from what

[03:21] I saw yesterday in the Haggis update, I think the game is sexy, I think people who are in

[03:26] on it are gonna be very happy, and look, this is not everybody's cup of tea, if you like

[03:32] modern games with deep rulesets, this is not the game for you, this is more pinball in

[03:38] its classic form, now the reason I do like games like Fathom when you have a deep lineup

[03:43] of games, these are the kinds of games that casual people can walk up to and understand,

[03:51] like you could explain to people how to play a game like Fathom, try to explain to someone

[03:57] how to play Pirates of the Caribbean or Avengers, and immediately watch them fall backwards and

[04:04] play dead, so beautiful game, beautiful play field, beautiful music, beautiful everything,

[04:12] now Damien and company just need to make these games, and someone said to me, Canada, you

[04:19] need to be the first person to congratulate them when they ship their first Fathom after

[04:25] everything you put them through, and I just want to say for the record, do you get a congratulations

[04:31] when you're a year late on what you promised? No, what I'm gonna say is finally Fathom games

[04:39] are shipping to customers, that's what I'm gonna say, look I have empathy and I understand

[04:45] that delays happen, but you gotta also keep companies accountable, when we stop keeping

[04:50] companies and people accountable for the stuff they promise us as consumers, because here's

[04:55] the thing I don't like about the modern pinball world, everything that's happening right now

[04:59] in pinball, and it's gonna happen the same with the weird Al Bayer as well, it happened

[05:03] with the cactus canyon Bayer, the new practice in pinball is you lock up people's money

[05:08] with the promise of an ETA ship date, then you make them wait way more months than you

[05:13] said they would have to wait, and then they have no choice but to be utterly patient,

[05:18] like incredibly patient waiting for their product, and I'm sorry but I don't like this

[05:23] practice, I just don't like it, I don't like having to fund a pinball company's operation

[05:28] for 8 months, 9 months, 10 months before I get my toy, I want to buy a toy that's ready

[05:33] to go into my home within a month or two, that's how I want pinball companies to operate,

[05:39] and if they need money to get their operations in order, then go get a loan from a bank or

[05:45] go find investors for your company, don't make your customers be investors in getting

[05:50] your operations up, because we've seen this before and this is where the danger lies,

[05:55] how do you know your fathom money is held in escrow, how do you know that, where did

[05:59] all the money come from to build the Celts, where did all the money come from to change

[06:03] the factory, to pave the driveways, to keep the lights on every month, where's all that

[06:08] money coming from if not from the pre-order dollars, and that's the part that just makes

[06:12] me a little bit nervous, I hope they figure it out, I hope you get your fathoms by June,

[06:17] I mean it, I hope by June there will be fathoms being unboxed, okay.

[06:22] Alright, let's talk about the other thing that happened this weekend and that is we

[06:27] got to see Multi-Morphix Weird Owl game, and it came to us via the Buffalo Pinball stream,

[06:32] now I did not watch it on Saturday night, Saturday night is date night with me and Brenda, we

[06:38] have our two bottles of sake and we order our Szechuan noodles and I wasn't going to

[06:42] stop date night to watch a two hour stream, but I did watch about a half hour of it today

[06:49] and I want to give you my first impressions of this game, now first and foremost, this

[06:54] is the nicest multi-morphic P3 game we've seen, now I would argue that the heist is a

[07:01] little bit more impressive and I like the shots in heist better than Weird Owl, I just

[07:07] think that crane and heist is a very impressive toy, I know there's a hamster wheel in Weird

[07:13] Owl but you don't really like interact with it, so I do think that the upper playfield

[07:18] of Weird Owl, it's okay, it's not blowing me away, but what I did like about this game

[07:24] is the overall integration of Weird Owl and just overall, I think this game does a great

[07:32] job of showcasing the potential of this platform and what this platform can do, what I liked

[07:38] about it is when you go into each new mode, the entire playfield becomes the mode, right,

[07:44] you've got the My Baloney, you're in a diner, you've got the, like a surgeon and you're

[07:48] playing the game of operation and you have like the entire playfield throws you into

[07:54] that song and that mini game and I really like that about this, I did think that that

[07:59] was really cool, really well done and I think that this shows what this platform is capable

[08:04] of, it's also really cool what they can do with the graphics on the screen and how it

[08:09] tracks your ball and how where you shoot determines what happens on the screen, I think it's really

[08:14] neat because for so many of us, when you think about the pinball experience we have with

[08:18] traditional pinball, so much of this kind of stuff happens on the LCD screen and you

[08:23] never really see it, so what I like about this, it's right there, it's right in front

[08:27] of you, in fact I don't even think you really have to look up at the other screen in Weird

[08:31] Albat often because you can just stare down at the game and everything you need is usually

[08:36] right there, I think the game sounded amazing, like the sounds in this game, the music, the

[08:42] callouts, all A plus on that front, I just keep coming back to the animations as the

[08:47] most impressive thing and look, these aren't the greatest animations, some people need to

[08:51] go see what real animation looks like, but for pinball which is always the caveat, I

[08:57] think the animations in this game are really surprising people, I think people thought

[09:01] they wouldn't have that much on the screen, on the play field, but man they really went

[09:06] all in on this game, whoever worked on this game, I think you should take a bow because

[09:11] I think you put so much effort into this game and this does not look like a Halloween situation

[09:18] or an Ultraman where you're going to have to wait 8 months to get code, this game looks

[09:22] like it's pretty much done, that's what I really like about this game too, when you

[09:26] get your weird out and you unbox your weird out, you're going to have a lot of pinball

[09:31] to play on day one, it's not going to be this embarrassingly empty game and then you have

[09:36] to go on this arduous journey to see if the game is any good a year after you bought it,

[09:40] so congrats to Jerry and team for doing that, now a couple things on the stream that I was

[09:45] a little bit like, I don't know, you know, the one thing that is really the big question

[09:49] mark for me is how does this game shoot, because the shots looked really really tight, like

[09:55] people were not making the ramp very often, that corkscrew ramp wasn't really effective,

[10:01] the ball was only making it through it like 50% of the time, so I am curious as a pinball

[10:06] shooter how this game does play, so I will hop on it at TPF and find out, but I was a

[10:12] little worried there, I was like, you know, I mean, I get all the assets are there, I

[10:16] get if you're a weird out fan, you're absolutely going to love this, but is this going to be

[10:20] a rewarding pinball experience?

[10:23] The other thing that made me laugh was the topper, I know, I know, for some reason,

[10:29] the topper just looked really really really cheap, you know, when they showed you the

[10:34] sales materials, it looked a lot more sculpted, but when you see it in real life, I feel like

[10:39] they had to pull the camera away from it, it was moving back and forth and it just looked

[10:42] really really cheap and fine, you know, whatever, I guess they throw it in with the LE package,

[10:47] so it's not like they're charging you $1,000 for the topper, but man, I just think Jerry

[10:52] should just make this topper available to everybody because A, it looks pretty cheap

[10:55] and B, I don't think anyone who has it is going to feel like they've got some amazing

[10:59] thing that only the LE has, and that's what I thought when I saw the topper of the game.

[11:03] So now we have a weird out game, which I think is exciting weird out fans, we finally have

[11:08] a multi-morphic licensed theme game, but the question mark with this game is the same question

[11:15] mark I have with Fathom, and the question is this, when are you going to get your game?

[11:20] Here's what I'm going to do, I am going to send $100, and I mean to whoever can get their

[11:27] game out first, if it's weird out, I will send Jerry $100 saying congratulations, you did it.

[11:34] If Damien can ship Fathom first, I will send Damien $100, that is cash, it is cold, it is hard,

[11:43] I know that money is not worth as much in Australia, so maybe I'll adjust it for the Australian exchange rate,

[11:49] but that's it, my money is on the table, I'm going to put it down right now with cool $100

[11:54] for whoever can actually get a consumer a game, and I think that's the vibe I have going into this spring in Pimball.

[12:01] It doesn't matter what you say, it's what you do, and manufacturing is the hardest thing to do in all of Pimball.

[12:09] One thing I noticed in both the Haggis video and in the Multimorphic stream was this, all of the owners of these Pimball companies,

[12:16] do you ever notice the way they look? They look exhausted, they look tired, they look like Pimball manufacturing is absolutely no fun at all.

[12:26] Like no fun at all, and you can tell it, like first of all Jerry in the stream, Jerry should never be on the streams of his games,

[12:33] he just looks angry, like he's ready to battle somebody who says something or gets something wrong with this game.

[12:39] Jerry, you need a PR person, you need a face of this company, you can't do it, you're not selling products man, you're making me sad,

[12:47] you just make me feel bad, I don't even know what it is I did, like when I look at Jerry on the stream,

[12:51] I'm like I don't know what any of us did, but he just seems like he's in a foul mood.

[12:55] Jerry, you're the lead of this company, this is a product you've been slaving away on, you need to put on a happy face,

[13:02] you need to be smiles, maybe have a drink or two, just have a more pleasant disposition when you're selling your company and your products and your brands.

[13:12] And I know Pimball marketing is some of the worst marketing on planet earth, but smile.

[13:17] And then we went over to Haggis and you know Damien just looks tired, Marty looks tired, the whole thing, you can tell,

[13:24] you can tell that they know the work that needs to be done to get these games on the line, and it's an incredible amount of work.

[13:32] It's thankless work and every day that goes by, the margin of profit gets smaller and smaller and smaller and it's not fun, right?

[13:42] This is the hard work, this is the logistics, this is like the roll up the sleeves, it's no longer fun, we're no longer designing,

[13:49] we're no longer slapping high fives at Pimball shows, we now have to be a manufacturer.

[13:55] I still to this day, if I had a few million dollars, the last thing I would do with it is start a Pimball company.

[14:03] These guys are crazy, I mean it, they are absolutely crazy, you have to be nuts to want to make a Pimball machine.

[14:09] I mean it's probably easier to make a house than a Pimball machine, but look, more power to them,

[14:14] I just hope that every one of them succeeds and gets people their games in a timely manner.

[14:20] Alright, what else is going on in Pimball? Look, you can do a Pimball podcast and it doesn't have to be like an hour long or half hour long,

[14:27] like I'm just going off of what's the new stuff.

[14:29] You know, I have to say, we hit today 420 Knate Club members, so I want to give a shout out to our latest members, Nick,

[14:37] we got Serge, we got Mike, we got Skyler, we got Jeff, we got Jared, we got Christian, we got Keith, we got Robert, we got David, we got Nate,

[14:45] we got Jeff, we got Joe, we got Johnny and Peter.

[14:48] Guys, thank you so much, it's just crazy, right? 420 and we keep going up and up and up.

[14:54] It's so awesome that all of you listening right now are part of the Knate Club.

[14:59] I hope on Saturday night that we do win the Twippy for fifth year in a row for favorite Pimball podcast

[15:05] because I'm going to dedicate it to all of you because you're the reason why.

[15:09] Like, you guys are the real reason why Knate's Pimball podcast has such a loyal following and people turn to this show for entertainment in the Pimball world.

[15:17] That's what it's all about.

[15:19] It's supposed to be entertaining and you're supposed to speak your mind without pulling punches.

[15:24] And I still, to this day, do not understand why more people can't get on the mic and talk about Pimball and Pimball companies without being afraid of what the companies are going to think about what they say.

[15:36] Like, it's unbelievable to me.

[15:38] The other thing to look out for this week will be the end of the Deeproot Auction, which is happening on Friday.

[15:45] So it's going to be fun.

[15:46] We're going to be at Texas Pimball Festival.

[15:48] We're going to be getting some Pimball news there.

[15:50] I'm going to be going live from the show as frequently as I can.

[15:52] And we're also going to see what stupid price someone pays for these Raza machines.

[15:57] I'm going to make a bet.

[15:59] I think the workout equipment is going to sell for almost as much money as the Pimball machine.

[16:04] I also am not confident that these machines will be able to be made working again.

[16:10] I just don't.

[16:11] I don't think anyone cares.

[16:13] I don't think anyone wants to put the effort in.

[16:15] I think everyone is so tired of J-pop and so tired of these dumb machines and everyone just wants to see Deeproot and all of this Zidware garbage go away once and for all.

[16:26] Sure, there were some really interesting concepts and ideas in some of the whitewoods we saw.

[16:32] We saw Food Truck.

[16:33] We saw like the Space Cadet game.

[16:35] We saw what else?

[16:36] There was a Goonies whitewood.

[16:37] I don't care about any of it.

[16:39] The reason why I don't care about any of it is like who cares about just thought starters and all these little ideas scattered throughout that design studio.

[16:47] That company was a joke.

[16:49] There was no manufacturing that was ever going to take place.

[16:52] They had no idea what they were doing and they were just pretending to be like a big successful Pimball company before they were a big successful Pimball company and in life and the lessons we need to start telling people more and more is this.

[17:06] Nobody cares about your ideas.

[17:09] It's how well you execute your ideas that makes all of the difference.

[17:13] The world's turned into this like everybody gets a trophy.

[17:17] Everybody gets an award.

[17:18] Everyone gets padded on the back before they execute.

[17:22] I'm sorry.

[17:22] That's not the way it works.

[17:24] There are winners and losers in life.

[17:26] The majority of Pimball Boutique companies have been losers.

[17:30] They've gone out of business.

[17:33] It doesn't matter how big their dreams were, how big their ambitions were.

[17:37] They don't get a passing grade.

[17:39] They failed.

[17:40] Even Jersey Jack Pimball needed a bailout.

[17:43] It is really, really hard to win in the Pimball manufacturing business and it doesn't matter if there's a blow hard Podcaster in New York City.

[17:52] It doesn't matter if there are Podcasters that are shilling for these companies.

[17:56] What matters is their ability to execute.

[18:00] I want to do this show and talk about games being unboxed.

[18:05] I want to talk about my experiences playing games.

[18:08] I don't want to have to wait eight months after I buy a game.

[18:11] I can't wait for the supply chain issues to get better so we can get more Pimball machines.

[18:17] And my final thoughts on DeepRoot are this.

[18:19] There were too many people in this community that knew that knew nothing was ever going to get made there and they didn't say anything.

[18:28] And we welcome those people back into the Pimball community with open arms.

[18:33] What does that say about the Pimball community?

[18:35] Maybe it says we have a big heart and we quickly forgive and that's fine.

[18:39] But I also think that some of those individuals that got let back into the Pimball community who have still not apologized for leading everybody on.

[18:49] And they did.

[18:49] They went on shows.

[18:51] They did all this stuff.

[18:52] They said just wait till you see what we have and it's going to blow everybody away.

[18:55] We're going to make more games than Stern.

[18:57] They still haven't apologized.

[18:59] They still get up there on social media and smile.

[19:02] It's amazing to me.

[19:03] It absolutely is amazing to me.

[19:04] I'm willing to forgive people.

[19:06] But man, some people need to ask for forgiveness anyway.

[19:08] But I don't think anyone cares.

[19:09] I mean, we are now at the point.

[19:11] You can tell it.

[19:12] We're at the point now where we need a new Jersey Jack game.

[19:15] Jersey Jack, please get us a new game.

[19:17] Please say something.

[19:19] Give us something to chew on at TPF.

[19:21] I really hope that there is at least one surprise at TPF.

[19:25] And maybe the biggest surprise of all is like maybe Canada gets dethroned for favorite Pimball podcaster this year.

[19:31] And it could happen.

[19:32] There's a lot of angry people that we took it behind the paywall, but we shall see.

[19:36] I love that each and every one of you are supporting this show.

[19:39] It means the world to me, everybody.

[19:41] We will have more shows this week.

[19:43] Obviously a lot more shows coming out of TPF and make sure if you're not on my Facebook page,

[19:48] join it because I'm going to be going live from TPF.

[19:52] I mean, who else is going to ask Mirko?

[19:54] Hey, bro, what happened?

[19:56] What happened with your JJP quality?

[19:58] I am absolutely going to ask him that question.

[20:01] Nobody cares about this toad in kid.

[20:03] No, we want to know why your playfields were falling apart and you didn't respond to any of us.

[20:10] I will ask that question.

[20:12] $100 to Damien or Jerry, whoever can get it done first.

[20:17] Can he get a cash?

[20:18] Will it be enough incentive to get these guys to actually ship product?

[20:21] Later, everybody.
