[00:00] ost

[01:05] We got to block some people.

[01:07] We're going to talk all about it, baby.

[01:10] Been telling people, been telling people for months.

[01:15] We've got Cheetos mad.

[01:18] We've got a good show today.

[01:20] We're talking pinball.

[01:22] We're talking.

[01:24] What's going on, everybody?

[01:25] How's everybody doing?

[01:26] Are we doing this?

[01:27] Are we doing this?

[01:28] Are we going live?

[01:29] I think we're going live.

[01:30] I think we are live.

[01:31] We are live.

[01:32] Talking about pinball.

[01:33] Everybody.

[01:34] How's everybody doing here?

[01:36] How's everybody in the house?

[01:38] Everyone's got their pinball orders.

[01:41] It's, you know, look, it's a good life.

[01:44] It's a good life.

[01:45] You know, I look out into this, into this universe,

[01:50] thrust it out into the galaxy to be able to talk about pinball

[01:55] on a weekly basis to a captive audience where we understand

[02:00] everything happening in the pinball world.

[02:02] We understand how many companies there are.

[02:05] We understand what the new games are.

[02:08] We have like this, this, this frame of reference.

[02:11] To something that you're, and nights is human beings,

[02:14] we're not lonely.

[02:16] We're not sad.

[02:17] And we're getting some of the best pinball the world has ever seen.

[02:20] I mean, pinball is about to take a turn for the better in 2026.

[02:24] We're going to see so many good games next year.

[02:26] The pressure is on.

[02:28] The manufacturers know it.

[02:30] The community knows it.

[02:32] And nothing but positive vibes happening in Canada.

[02:35] Land, you know, who knows is going on in these charity worlds.

[02:38] We talk a little bit about project pinball.

[02:40] I don't know, man.

[02:41] Like I took all, I took down all that stuff.

[02:43] People sending me the numbers.

[02:44] I'm not going to die on that hill.

[02:46] I'm not going after children's charities.

[02:48] It's not, it's not what we come to pinball.

[02:51] To talk about really.

[02:53] But we're going to talk about all the new games.

[02:56] We're going to talk about what's going on around the pinball horn.

[02:59] And we're going to, you know, do what we always do best.

[03:02] We give a, we give a place, a safe place to come and just share your opinions.

[03:07] Nobody's nasty.

[03:08] Nobody's mean.

[03:09] Nobody's threatening people.

[03:10] Nobody's calling people, you know, you know, jerked.

[03:13] I had to, I had to block someone for the first time in a long time.

[03:17] I'm just got real bitter.

[03:18] We'll talk about that a little bit on this show.

[03:20] Look, I'm all for discourse.

[03:22] I'm all for people coming into Casa de Canada.

[03:25] And speaking your mind, but if you keep insulting me, you're gone.

[03:28] You're gone, Chico.

[03:29] It's like, it's that simple.

[03:30] It's that simple.

[03:31] The Canadian Spinball podcast on Patreon is one of the most fun groups in all the pinball.

[03:37] We're now.

[03:38] We've done amazingly well in terms of getting more people back into the Canada fold.

[03:45] We're now at over 700, I think, an eight or nine subscribers, which is really great.

[03:50] We tipped all the way down to like 650 when there was just a law.

[03:53] It's like, who wants to pay to hear a guy talk about dungeons and dragons?

[03:58] Who wants to pay to hear a guy talk about King Kong in the market or dune, right?

[04:04] The second a game started to get more exciting.

[04:06] People started to come back and back and back.

[04:10] No, it wasn't dark.

[04:12] You're a jerk, Canada.

[04:14] I love it.

[04:15] I love it.

[04:16] Fizzy.

[04:17] How's it going, brother?

[04:18] Fizzy, you know, he just hit me up earlier this morning.

[04:20] He's like, I want to get on the list for the next spooky calm down people.

[04:24] Calm down.

[04:25] Nobody should be trying to get on the list for the next spooky game.

[04:29] We need to simmer down here.

[04:32] It's just, it's stupid.

[04:34] It's a stupid thing to try to go do.

[04:37] And it's, you know, what's crazy for me in my world is it's ten o'clock in the morning.

[04:43] I've been up since like 435.

[04:45] I mean, I just the way I roll.

[04:47] I go, I mean, I'm kind of like a morning person to begin with, but I go to bed around like nine.

[04:51] I feel like the moment I go horizontal, I'll call.

[04:54] You know, because I could sleep like a baby, you know, and I, that I've got fetal juice number nine, nine, nine, nine.

[04:59] And I also got fetal juice is one through five, Canadian additions.

[05:03] Everybody's wondering what's he going to do with these additions?

[05:06] Well, I'm not going to auction it off.

[05:08] Like that's, that's for sure.

[05:10] You spoke very loud and clear everybody here.

[05:12] Like, you're auctioning off these machines is not what you want me to do.

[05:16] So I won't do it.

[05:17] I won't do it.

[05:19] You're wrong on that one.

[05:20] Brows in.

[05:21] What, what's wrong?

[05:22] What's up, Hector?

[05:25] Look, you know, I'm watching, I'm watching the pinball market and I'm watching the games.

[05:30] I'm watching the threads.

[05:32] I'm reading people's feedback.

[05:33] And it's a, you know, look, it's a great time to be in pinball.

[05:38] And I think a lot of us are really excited about two games really.

[05:42] I mean, it's really Winchester.

[05:44] And Beetlejuice has all the real excitement going.

[05:48] I don't think I've seen two communities of people that have ordered a game really looking forward to getting those two games.

[05:57] And a lot of people maybe got both.

[05:59] I think I would, if I were to guess, I would say the overlap is maybe something like 25% of Winchester owner.

[06:07] Maybe more like 30% of Winchester buyers also got a Beetlejuice.

[06:11] I think it was a game.

[06:13] It might even be higher folk.

[06:15] It might even be more like 50% and it's just exciting to see that I think both games are absolutely phenomenal in their own respect.

[06:26] I do.

[06:27] I think what they both bring to the table is what everybody has been wanting and waiting for for a long time.

[06:35] I think they just both put passion in a box.

[06:39] They're both original that we haven't had a Beetlejuice game before.

[06:42] We haven't had a Winchester game before.

[06:44] It's beautiful.

[06:45] I think what's boring about Stern is just going back making the same game over again.

[06:49] It's boring.

[06:50] It's getting boring.

[06:51] It's been boring.

[06:52] Making Star Wars again, boring, transformers again, kind of boring, right?

[06:56] We just keep making the same stuff over and over again.

[06:58] And here comes something fresh, something new, something that has not been done before.

[07:03] Nothing is unobtainable with enough money, says Kaz.

[07:07] Yeah, well, you know, look, it's just I've been saying it for a while.

[07:12] Say it again, Beetlejuice is will start going for 20k.

[07:17] I'm sorry, there's a little pop it on.

[07:21] They will start going for 20k.

[07:24] And you know, I'll tell you why they're going to go for 20k.

[07:27] Because people will simply look down and say, I would rather have this than two Stern premiums.

[07:32] That's it.

[07:33] That's it.

[07:34] A world in which people used to buy you would rather have one special machine than two games that are just.

[07:43] Now look, you could argue that those Stern premiums for 10 are really just $6,000 games waiting to become $6,000 games, which they are, by the way.

[07:54] Both are killer games, Winchester even way more rare and no show games says Derek, Derek, you're funny.

[08:01] Derek's one of my good buddies.

[08:03] Derek and I speak weekly, sometimes daily.

[08:07] Derek has a Winchester.

[08:08] So I love the him hyping his own game that he has one.

[08:12] Derek, you're funny.

[08:13] We know you have a Winchester way more rare.

[08:16] Yeah, it's twice as rare.

[08:17] But the but Derek, the problem you keep forgetting is Derek, the demand for Beetlejuice is 10 times higher than Winchester.

[08:23] It still took Winchester a couple days to sell out.

[08:27] Beetlejuice sold out in like nine seconds.

[08:30] I'm just reading your comments as best as I can without glasses on.

[08:33] So we cause I'll take the 4,000 Stern pros.

[08:39] Okay, yeah, they're going to be worth $4,000.

[08:41] Don't raffle the project pin.

[08:43] Don't ruffle the project pinball feathers.

[08:45] Oh, okay.

[08:46] Did I ruffle them?

[08:47] I mean, like publicly, it's public information.

[08:50] I don't know.

[08:51] I mean, I'll tell you this.

[08:53] Kicking the project pinball can down the road just a little bit has people sending me emails and personal stories.

[09:02] And I just it just feels like a messy thing to even go down.

[09:07] Like I don't it just feels like a messy road.

[09:09] I don't I don't know.

[09:11] It seems like a lot of money's being generated with these raffles.

[09:15] Obviously, the expenses are the machines.

[09:19] But I think there's just a little bit of like a,

[09:22] yeah, but where's the rest of the money going?

[09:25] Because if you think about the amount of raffles they've done and on average,

[09:30] if the games were like $7,000, there's like a big gap between what the games call I get servicing.

[09:38] I get it.

[09:39] Like I'm not I don't even care.

[09:41] I'm not here.

[09:43] To go down this road.

[09:45] I don't I don't buy project pinball raffle tickets.

[09:49] I don't.

[09:51] I don't just something about the, I think,

[09:54] like I think everything they do is like legit.

[09:57] But I think the raffles are where it gets a little shady where all that money's going.

[10:02] That's just that's just my take on all of it is when you start generating all that money with like six beetle juice games,

[10:10] making almost a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in revenue, you know,

[10:15] minus the cost of the games.

[10:18] It's a lot of money.

[10:20] It's a lot of money.

[10:22] We've got sad boy.

[10:24] What's good brother spooky has nightmare on Elm Street.

[10:28] If spooky has nightmare on Elm Street, hell razor and goonies.

[10:32] I'm going to have to quit in Uber to generate in the poker room.

[10:38] And so my kidney also I heard JJP as Ghostbusters.

[10:42] If so, let's f and go.

[10:44] Well, look, the the JJP Ghostbusters room.

[10:48] I think Don was the first one to start that.

[10:52] I don't know me.

[10:53] I hope they do.

[10:55] What's up?

[10:56] Is that?

[10:59] Gene Gonzalez with the ten bucks.

[11:01] Gene, thank you so much brother.

[11:03] Gene, are you new here brother?

[11:05] Well, sad boy, we'll talk about all your stuff in a second.

[11:08] Gene, are you new?

[11:09] Welcome to the party pal.

[11:10] I really appreciate it for you guys like with your super chats.

[11:13] I think it's great.

[11:14] Thank you so much for supporting the show.

[11:18] Look, I think whatever spooky has next is going to just move as fast as Beetlejuice did.

[11:27] And I think it's amazing.

[11:28] I think there's a lot of excitement.

[11:31] Now look, Ghostbusters with Jersey Jack would be phenomenal.

[11:35] I would love that if that were the case.

[11:38] I don't I don't know though.

[11:40] I don't think so.

[11:41] I don't think Stern would like lose that license to JJP but maybe so.

[11:46] I don't think there's really like pinball exclusivity.

[11:48] Like if someone else wanted to make a Star Wars game, I bet you could.

[11:52] Stern lost the Ghostbusters license.

[11:55] Wow.

[11:56] Well, you know.

[11:59] Jersey Jack Ghostbusters, you know, I haven't really asked bread.

[12:02] I try not to ask for stuff that I know he shouldn't tell me.

[12:09] Winchester looked like a brick fest when Joel was playing.

[12:13] Look, lots of weird shots didn't look like a good shooter.

[12:18] Damn.

[12:20] Well, look, I've had people say that.

[12:23] You know, people are starting to call it Winchester brick house.

[12:26] And then I've had people say it plays as good as an L win, which I can tell you right now.

[12:31] It doesn't play as good as an L win.

[12:34] I don't know.

[12:35] You know, look, I think.

[12:37] I think this is going to be I keep saying it.

[12:40] I think it's going to be a polarizing gameplay experience Winchester.

[12:45] I do.

[12:46] It's a unique layout.

[12:48] It's it's got I think four flippers.

[12:54] No upper plate field lots of stuff to shoot at in unique locations.

[13:01] Whether or not the game is going to be to people's liking when it comes to flow when it comes to.

[13:07] You know, it's kind of like because it's not like a flowy game.

[13:10] It is a little bit more trapping go.

[13:12] I feel like.

[13:13] But from from my I only played it once.

[13:16] I played three balls once.

[13:17] I put about five minutes on it from what I could tell.

[13:21] It's going to be a challenging game for a lot of casual players.

[13:25] Somebody needs to do SpongeBob square pants.

[13:28] I don't know about that.

[13:30] K-pop team at hundreds first.

[13:33] I'm reading your comments.

[13:35] Goonies seems odd.

[13:36] I don't consider that in the.

[13:39] Okay, first of all, guys.

[13:41] What do you mean?

[13:42] Goonies literally is as spooky as spooky can be.

[13:46] For whoever just said that that doesn't fit into spookies.

[13:50] Goonies has got more spookiness and scaryness than Scooby-Doo does.

[13:56] Spooky pinball made Rick and Morty.

[13:59] Where's the you know, where's the spookiness and that?

[14:03] Spooky pinball is going to make goonies.

[14:05] I think they're going to make Remlins.

[14:07] I think they're going to make everything you want.

[14:09] I think nightmare and I'm straight one day.

[14:11] I don't know.

[14:13] I think they've got the model down and it's going to be just great.

[14:16] I don't think they're worried.

[14:19] Canada's never worried about getting a spot.

[14:22] I still love that.

[14:24] You know, everyone keeps asking me, what are you doing with these five games?

[14:26] I do not know yet.

[14:28] Are you worried?

[14:30] It is only November 22nd next week is Thanksgiving.

[14:34] Are you worried?

[14:35] These games are not going on the line until January.

[14:39] I I've purposely not reached out to Luke and sort of asked them about the details on these five games yet.

[14:47] What order are they?

[14:48] Like when will customers be getting them?

[14:50] I just didn't want to bother them yet because I know they're so elated and busy with everything happening around them.

[14:56] So I'll figure it out.

[14:58] Luke hangs out here every week.

[15:00] All I know is this is that five of you who are Canadian club members are going to get a chance to buy a Beetlejuice for MSRP.

[15:09] No markup, no scalping, no auction.

[15:14] I thought it would be fun to see like if we did auction one, how high the price might go.

[15:20] Apparently just just suggesting that made made everybody go crazy.

[15:26] I you know, like not allowed to allow people to get access because of their money.

[15:31] That's apparently that's a terrible world.

[15:33] You know, because when Brennan and I saw this house and we fell in love with it and we had a one kid and another on the way.

[15:40] Do you think we went to the owner and said, hey, we love your house so much.

[15:45] We're willing to pay what you're asking for the house.

[15:48] Do you think you think that would have worked?

[15:50] Do you think we'd be in this home right now?

[15:52] If that's how the world works.

[15:55] No, she wanted $300,000 over the listing price.

[16:02] $300,000 over the listing price.

[16:07] And that was the take it down number she wanted.

[16:12] When we offered that, she got four other offers on top of that cash.

[16:20] So even if people want to pay over only one person got it, we got it.

[16:24] Never selling this house.

[16:25] I told I love this house so much.

[16:26] It's worth every penny.

[16:28] Project, canada.

[16:30] Oh man.

[16:33] You know, well, that's the thing.

[16:34] But you guys, you guys forget when spooky pinball has an MSRP of 999, that's a manufacturer suggested retail price.

[16:45] You guys forget what the word suggest it means.

[16:50] Suggest it.

[16:52] They're suggesting people pay $10,000 for Beto juice.

[16:56] But I can guarantee you right now there was about 50 guys out there that would happily pay 15 to get one today.

[17:02] And there's a few guys who would probably even pay 18 if four people wanted that one game and had a lot of money.

[17:09] So I don't understand why there's so much anger and there's so much vitriol.

[17:14] But it is what it is.

[17:15] I don't even, you know, you guys want to live in, you want to live in fantasy world and get these games fine.

[17:20] I'll apply you for a moment of suspended normality, if you will.

[17:26] What are you wearing?

[17:28] What am I wearing?

[17:30] Pokemon.

[17:31] No, do I, mon?

[17:36] It's my 4K.

[17:38] If you don't know what do I mon is, do I mon?

[17:43] He's a robotic cat from the 31st century.

[17:47] Comes back to help a little boy.

[17:49] It's amazing.

[17:54] What's going on, gang?

[17:55] Let's read your comments.

[17:56] All right.

[17:57] So we got walking dead waiting on license or approval.

[18:00] Is it just me or like every day that goes by, I could care less about the walking dead remastered.

[18:06] I literally could care less about it.

[18:09] Like you get one chance to make a first impression.

[18:11] I feel like Stern has had like five chances now.

[18:15] Like launch this game and still not, it's still not launched properly.

[18:18] So when exactly is the, when exactly is Stern Pimbo going to have all the assets.

[18:24] So we can finally see the game in the right way.

[18:26] I just don't even care.

[18:29] I don't even care.

[18:31] I, we've seen the game.

[18:34] And from what we can see in the new game, it's just the old game with newer animations.

[18:40] I don't find it, you know, watching the spooky stream this week.

[18:44] I was like laughing how much better spooky covers the majority of the time.

[18:49] Spooky is covering their full scene.

[18:51] They're full screen with the clips and Stern still can't figure out how to do that.

[18:58] I mean, the fact that they're going back to AC DC next year, gang.

[19:02] Can you talk about who wants more AC DCs?

[19:07] I really don't get it.

[19:09] I really don't get it.

[19:13] I'm still happy with my original walk.

[19:15] I, if I had an original walking dead, I would not be upgrading.

[19:19] I would not be upgrading.

[19:22] I just don't think the experience on this machine is going to make you like need to upgrade.

[19:30] Can I win one of your apples if I already secured a beetle juice says Daniel.

[19:36] Well, now you can't.

[19:37] You should have kept that a secret, Daniel.

[19:39] Now, everybody knows that Daniel Donald has a beetle juice already.

[19:43] So if we get his name, he's not, he doesn't get to buy it.

[19:46] Thank you for letting us know anyone else want to be honest.

[19:49] Feeling that's like the latest thing is like everyone just trying to get, you know,

[19:54] kind of judge everybody on some like moral level about whether or not scalping is a good thing or not.

[20:00] I think a lot of butter cabinets are going to sell.

[20:03] Like butter really does show off the art unlike anything else.

[20:06] It the butter is the way to go people that this, this game is a masterpiece.

[20:10] You're really going to want to load it up with everything butter, top or everything.

[20:13] I would not, I would not go cheap.

[20:16] Even if your games are in between other games, go with the butter. Trust me.

[20:23] Plastic ramps in a remastered wall.

[20:25] I don't, well, I don't.

[20:27] The, weren't the original ramps plastic.

[20:29] So it's where they not where they, they didn't change the material of the ramps in the walking dead, right?

[20:35] They always were plastic.

[20:38] You should give one spot to a person who can document the most losses realized from new and box purchases.

[20:47] I can't even read new inbox purchases.

[20:51] So you want me to hand value to someone who's lost a lot of money.

[20:55] I mean, it's Neil McRae is lost the most money.

[20:58] He's, he buys every stern alley.

[21:03] You should give, okay.

[21:06] No, I'm not going to do it that way.

[21:11] Look, I, I really want to say, you know, we'll go back to all the games in a second, but I've had a, I've had a really good week.

[21:19] We won the home depot.

[21:22] Super excited.

[21:23] I went down to it, went down to Atlanta to pitch the home depot a few weeks ago.

[21:28] And, you know, right on the eve of my organization being acquired on Monday to win a big piece of new business like that is great.

[21:39] I was fun being in the room with the individuals over at the home depot.

[21:42] They're great, they're great people.

[21:44] I really look forward to working on their business.

[21:47] And it's a great brand.

[21:48] I mean, I go to the home depot all the time.

[21:51] It's my go to, I mean, you know what the funny thing about the home depot is like, you end up going back like five times in one day when you are trying to do a project.

[21:57] So that was a lot of fun.

[21:59] And then I'm also working on star wars and M&Ms for the 50th anniversary of star wars.

[22:07] So I've had a lot of fun this week coming up with ideas and getting back into stuff that is is my wheelhouse.

[22:16] Sometimes I have to work on stuff that's not exactly my specialty.

[22:20] So it's great.

[22:21] It's been a good week.

[22:22] And you know, who knows what's going to happen?

[22:24] And the world's changing so rapidly.

[22:26] All these companies are reducing their work forces and turning on AI.

[22:33] But in the end, in the end.

[22:36] How are you going to AI generate something like this, like this monstrosity of creative man child like it's it's brilliant.

[22:45] This week was also like a, you know, I never like blocking or banning people, but you know, when you keep calling me names and insulting me personally, you're gone.

[22:55] You're gone.

[22:57] So a moment of silence for for Miss Emily gross or I think Anderson, whichever once you go by and hey, look.

[23:07] I've tried man. I've tried like when people just keep every time they talk, they're like.

[23:13] They're just insulting me and calling me names and I that's where I draw the line.

[23:18] You don't get to come into Costa de Canada and constantly be negative.

[23:22] And I think certain people are, you know, just get really nasty.

[23:26] And when that happens, you're gone.

[23:28] Like and that's a funny thing about the Canadian community.

[23:30] You'll see it here.

[23:31] You'll see it on my Patreon chat.

[23:33] It's everybody treats everybody with respect.

[23:36] And if there's ever a moment, you guys would be so surprised.

[23:40] There's way more respect happening between people that follow me on Facebook, on Patreon, here on YouTube.

[23:50] You see in the chat here, this is not a place where people come and start insulting each other.

[23:57] And so like not only do I not allow that amongst the people that follow, but I don't definitely don't allow it if you're just going to keep being negative about me.

[24:06] Then let me help you out.

[24:08] Let me set you free.

[24:10] And I love it too.

[24:11] She's like, I want to cancel my subscription.

[24:13] You don't get to cancel your subscription.

[24:15] You've been blocked from Canadian Spinball podcast on Patreon.

[24:19] So don't worry.

[24:21] You're not going to be charged anymore money.

[24:23] Don't worry.

[24:24] You're going to be fine.

[24:25] And you know, go on your mission to talk how much you hate me.

[24:29] It's good.

[24:30] I don't have any ill will.

[24:31] You know, what's, you know, what makes me sad is if you remember like a few years ago, we did a Facebook live, which is when we,

[24:38] I think the community really first got introduced to Emily.

[24:42] Remember that we did a Facebook live.

[24:45] I think we talked to her about how she's got into pinball.

[24:49] She was overcoming a serious health issue, medical issue.

[24:55] And you know, she got, it was getting married to a gentleman who had all these amazing games.

[25:00] And it was amazing.

[25:01] And we raised, we tried to see how much money we could raise, you know, to give to Emily, you know, to do something great with,

[25:08] to go out and have a great meal with her then.

[25:10] I think it's crazy to me.

[25:13] I don't know what I did between that encounter.

[25:18] And then just the level of like anger and nastiness she's been throwing my way for a long time.

[25:25] So that's it.

[25:26] You just get sometimes, you know, sometimes you just got to let people go, man.

[25:32] I clearly something I do triggers her.

[25:35] I can't imagine what that would be, but it's just the way it is.

[25:39] And so we move on.

[25:41] And the Canadian club will be as strong as ever.

[25:45] And you just won't be missed if you treat me like that seriously, like damn.

[25:50] And the thing is, I work with mostly all women.

[25:52] I could absorb the, you know, the, the, the, the gamma rays of estrogen better than anybody.

[25:59] And I do, I absolutely do.

[26:01] I work with almost all women.

[26:03] I think I think my entire creative team in New York is like, there's, I don't, there's not a single guy.

[26:07] Maybe one on the entire creative team.

[26:10] So it's like, I ain't walking in there, growing out with my, my, my crew.

[26:14] It's, it's not like that.

[26:15] Like they, it's, you guys are more of my crew.

[26:19] So you dismissed her opinion a long time ago.

[26:23] A woman never forgets.

[26:25] Well, man, with that's the case, man.

[26:28] I think everybody has to be, has to be that.

[26:34] Emily, look, she's here on Facebook. Emily, welcome.

[26:36] You know what you did. Emily, no, I didn't.

[26:39] I said, I, I, I, I posed it the picture of the project pinball numbers.

[26:43] And you came at me in such a nasty way.

[26:45] So, look, I'm not going to block you here.

[26:47] You can, you can hang out on Facebook.

[26:49] But, you know, but, you know, I don't, you know, the podcast, you know, there's plenty of other pinball podcasts.

[26:54] They'd love to have you.

[26:55] I don't need your five bucks.

[26:57] So, um, welcome, welcome to this Facebook live.

[27:01] But, um, yeah, I didn't do anything to you, but it is fine as is.

[27:06] I gave all the money back to your Patreon.

[27:09] You tried to dog on project pinball charity, and I wasn't having it.

[27:14] Who are you?

[27:15] Try to dog on them.

[27:17] All I did was post a picture of their, of their publicly facing numbers.

[27:22] And do you know, Emily, you know all the inner workings of project pinball and we're all, you know where all the money goes, Emily?

[27:31] And I, okay, Emily, let's put our big, big adult pants on right now, Emily.

[27:37] I emailed them for a comment just to ask like, hey, like, can you clarify what, where all the expenses, where the expense money goes?

[27:47] That was two days ago.

[27:48] They never responded.

[27:49] So, I don't know what, you know, I don't know what to tell you.

[27:51] Like, I gave them a chance to just like say something.

[27:59] Well, you know, but Emily, Emily, stop acting like it's just the project pinball thing.

[28:04] You act like that's the only time you've been, you've been mean and nasty to me for, for like a long time on Facebook.

[28:10] And every time I say something, you know what it is, Emily, let me, let me break it down for you.

[28:14] You think, I'm gonna do this right now.

[28:16] You think, because I don't buy pinball machines and you think I don't play enough pinball and you think like everything I talk about in this hobby is the wrong way to talk about the hobby.

[28:27] That's what you think, right?

[28:28] It's because, because I talk about the pinball like market, I talk about the community, I talk about speculating on the prices, I talk about, you know, is stern pinball ripping us off.

[28:38] You don't want to hear any of that.

[28:39] You know why you don't want to hear any of that?

[28:41] You know why that doesn't interest you?

[28:44] Because you're not taking your hard earned money to buy these games.

[28:50] So boom, it's a lot different when you have to take $13,000 that you worked for and buy externally and lose $5,000 on it.

[29:03] And you don't want to talk about that.

[29:06] And guess what? That's what I talk about.

[29:09] And there are 30 or 40 other pinball personalities, podcasters and entertainers out there that would much rather have the tournament talk that you want to talk about and that this and that you want to talk about.

[29:23] So it's that.

[29:29] So you're sick of me knocking on hard working companies.

[29:33] Gang, look at this.

[29:35] She's sick of me knocking on hard working companies.

[29:40] Emily, again, let me, let me repeat something.

[29:43] These are, these are pinball companies that charge an exorbitant amount of money for a toy.

[29:51] And so I should, if I don't like a move a company makes, I should not say how I feel because those are hard working companies and the rest of us out here.

[30:04] The rest of us out here that are working really hard to be able to afford said product should not, we should not share if we don't, if we don't take a liking to what those hard working companies do.

[30:21] You know how hard it is to keep 55 machines right you have 55 machines. Wow.

[30:31] Well, you know what Emily, I'm going to be honest with you. It's a lot harder to to work your ass off to buy those 55 machines and it is to maintain them.

[30:40] Okay.

[30:41] And that's that.

[30:46] You're a scalper. You're a scalper.

[30:53] No, it's fun. It's fun.

[30:57] Well, look, Emily, it's clear you don't want to hang out here. Let's do this. Should we do this again? Emily, you want to do this again?

[31:03] See, you know, again, very, you already went to Don's page and called me a douche. Did you not?

[31:10] I love it. I love the drama. You ran to Don's pinball podcast to insult me. Now Don and I are getting along fine now. And even he's just like, I don't know, just listen to whoever you want to listen to.

[31:20] No, I love this stuff because it's like, you know, you didn't get your way. You got kicked out of the Patreon. And now you're here. Like again, you're a scalper.

[31:33] You're this. You're, yeah, I'm in your eyes. I'm a terrible human being. Again.

[31:40] I got all these people here who kind of disagree.

[31:46] You haven't replaced boards in a while. Yeah, I've been changing diapers, Emily. Dippers.

[31:54] I haven't changed a pinball board in a while because no board is broken on my guns and roses.

[32:01] So yeah, no, I haven't changed a board in a while. I've changed a bunch of dirty diapers. Emily really, you know, we're going to, we're going to let Emily go.

[32:13] We're going to, we're going to, we're going to free Emily from her. Emily, your Saturday is about to be yours again.

[32:20] All right, let's do this. All right.

[32:25] There we go. We're back. It's so simple. It's so simple. All right. That was fun for five minutes.

[32:33] You see, you let them back in the door. You let them back in the door. They come through just as nasty. Gone. Gone.

[32:41] The beauty of social media, the beauty of all of it is yet, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, gone. Gone.

[32:49] Blah, yeah, like no one wants to know what this is not what you guys come to hear for.

[32:54] And like, this is not even debates. Yeah, you haven't changed a board. I love it, people.

[33:01] No, it's not fun at all. Dude, it's like these people like, it's funny to me. It's like saying, well, you haven't changed the oil on your Dodge demon. You're not a car enthusiast.

[33:09] You haven't you haven't changed. You haven't rotated your Dodge demon tires. Canada, you don't deserve that Dodge demon.

[33:16] She's changing boards on games. She didn't even buy. Wow. Yeah, if you want to, if I would, if I inherited 55 Dodge demons and a huge garage.

[33:28] Yeah, I might learn how to change the tires on the damn car.

[33:33] Let's talk about pinball Christopher. You guys, all right. So we got right now going on this weekend is the Dutch pinball open.

[33:42] It's happening over there in the Netherlands.

[33:45] We don't we we don't talk about Dutch right now. We don't talk about Dutch right now.

[33:52] But the thing is this, the thing is this. Dutch has got the biggest banger comment. You know, Dutch has got back to the future with all of the assets.

[34:06] I know some stuff about the game can't tell you yet.

[34:11] The SLEs are going to be, you know, if you think Frank Mack here, you know, one of my good friends Frank here.

[34:23] He's, I'm just going to tell you right now getting a getting an SLE.

[34:29] Getting an SLE of back to the future is going to be the hardest thing.

[34:34] It's going to be one of the hardest things ever. And I'll just say that everybody knows that.

[34:42] So I think it's going to be an amazing game. I think look.

[34:48] All of your concerns about all of your concerns about how fast Dutch can make these games are going to be valid.

[34:57] Right. They're all going to be valid. There's going to be a real difficult time getting these games.

[35:05] And I just think Dutch is going to do what Dutch does.

[35:10] And the, the model is not great. The demand is through the roof.

[35:16] The thing I'm going to be curious about with this game is it very sets a limit of how many he's going to make in total when he announces it.

[35:24] I don't know. But they, I mean, look, it's been more than 10 years.

[35:28] It's been about 12 years of the big Lebowski basically. I mean, you got to remember, though, for those of us who have been in this hobby for a long time, about.

[35:36] I want to say like about five or six of those years, I want to say maybe six of those years, the game was not even in production.

[35:46] The game was frozen with their whole ARA scandal. Remember that like the vendor was in paid.

[35:54] Dutch wasn't honest about it. Everybody waited forever. Then they were going to try to like remake, fry to pinball. That didn't work.

[36:03] You know, the whole thing was a, was a boondoggle. It was like, and that lasted for a long time. I'm not sure how much of the 12 years was that.

[36:12] But that lasted a long time. Now, the other crazy part of this Dutch deal is that the first 500 back to the futures go to Alice's adventures and wonderland owners.

[36:27] How do you guys feel about that? I mean, like, it's a smart move for Dutch. It's a smart move for Melvin. But how do you feel about that?

[36:37] That'd be like spooky saying. I just let me, let me look and I love Melvin and I, I understand why he did it.

[36:46] But that would be the equivalent of saying. Whoever keeps their ultra man order gets first dibs at beetle juice.

[36:57] Like, like literally, I mean, that is like, I think I've made a lot of comparisons or a lot of use a lot of metaphors in my 12 years of this.

[37:07] That is probably the most accurate connection I've ever made. It's like asking people to keep their ultra man deposits to get beetle juice.

[37:17] If they flip the game, they don't get it. No, they need to have the game.

[37:24] Whoever owns it, I think at the time of back to the future, I think, no, I actually, you know, wait, I think I don't know, man, I don't know how they're going to like police at all to be honest.

[37:40] Well, look, it's a great idea says, John, because they're supporting those who supported them. Yeah, that's even that's the, that's the, that's the overall sentiment, right?

[37:50] Is they want to reward their loyal customers? The truth is this game without without owl is Dutch pinballs out of business without rasa Dutch pinballs out of business like very needed those bridges or as whole thing collapses.

[38:03] So no, venous save this company multiple times.

[38:08] And then we got Christopher men, Manachi, that's a S H I T. I don't like the curse couldn't hold up their end of the deal. So now they're pulling no Christopher.

[38:19] Christopher, I disagree. I Christopher, I want to stay on what you just said, you just said they couldn't hold up their end of the deal. That's not true. That's not true at all.

[38:29] Their end of the deal, because I, we did it, being factual is important here. Their end of the deal was that if your game doesn't arrive by January 1st of 2026, we will refund your deposit.

[38:44] That was the deal. I can tell you with 100% certainty that Dutch pinball will still refund you on January 1st if your game has not been built yet. So you know, you just got to be careful when you say stuff like they didn't hold up their end of the deal.

[39:02] Now they said they were hoping to get all games built by the end of the year, but the deal was always it wasn't a guarantee of that the guarantee was your deposit is refundable jam first.

[39:15] How long do I need to keep beetle juice before I sell it not to piss people off. Okay, so Daniel, that's a great question. Let's talk about this.

[39:23] All right, so because this was the main, this was the main subject of my last podcast. It's been probably one of the most frequently discussed things happening on pin sight right now, and that is all about scalping, you know, and is scalping bad and is scalping ruining the hobby.

[39:45] And at what point are people okay to sell their spots. Look, the thing is this. I'm not, I'm going to be completely honest with each and every one of you.

[39:58] And I want you to, I want you to sort of go with me on this and I want to hear what your thoughts are. Should we ask Emily, it's buddy, it's buddy.

[40:11] You know, look, I'll say this as much as as much as I just want to say this if your friends with Emily and this and I've gone down this room before I need a break. She needs a break from me right now and I need a break from her.

[40:24] What tends to happen when I block people who are just this way a month will go by and I unblock everybody and I do that and I just see like because I like giving people a second chance to come back with maybe a different attitude.

[40:40] And, and, and, you know, and also like both parties reflect on whether or not they actually this is healthy for them to be here. That's it. That's it.

[40:49] You know, and that's it. So like, I don't, I don't ban anybody for life. That is not, that is not how I roll. All right. So back to the, so here's what I want to, here's what I want to say.

[41:04] It's, it's fun. It's fun to scout pinball machines.

[41:10] Can I, can I repeat that? It's fun. It's fun.

[41:17] Now, I want to just stop there. Do you think it's annoying that I just said that that it is actually really fun to scout a pinball machine that I actually get tremendous pleasure in scouting a pinball machine.

[41:30] I want to understand from those of you out there. Why does that annoy you so much?

[41:39] More fun than playing them. No, no.

[41:43] But, but John, what's fun about scouting a machine is like oftentimes you can scout a machine and then the machine you end up playing cost half as much money.

[41:52] Who would want to do that? Who would not want to do that?

[41:57] Okay. Has anyone, like, so scouting something is fun.

[42:02] Because you know, you know who's always smiling the most distros.

[42:05] Like, I get the whole argument. Oh, distros are, yeah, distros are, distros are making, they're making a decent margin for, you know, how much work are they doing on, on the majority of their sales.

[42:16] How much work are they doing? Exactly. That's why they're in a good mood. Have you ever met a distro that's really like in a bad mood?

[42:23] Have you ever, have you ever met like a bummed out distro or dealer? They all are smiling here to ear.

[42:30] I want, I want to feel those smiles. I want to feel what it's like to know that pleasure in life.

[42:37] To simply put it in order into Chicago and have a game go from a warehouse to a customer and make a fuck.

[42:43] I want, I want to know with that feeling.

[42:46] I want to feel that more than just a few times a year.

[42:52] Scalpers can get them new clients for the long term.

[42:57] Obviously most pinball players haven't bought collectible items, cars, toys.

[43:02] So John, what you're saying is like this hobby's not, it's been going on since I, I did not bring scalping to pinball.

[43:07] It's been going on since I've been in pinball.

[43:10] So here's the dirty little secret. Here's the dirty little secret.

[43:13] When I got into pinball, when I got into pinball circa 2022, no, no, 2012.

[43:24] Yeah, it's been 13 years, like 2012 basically.

[43:28] Here's what was going on. Here's what the scalp was.

[43:32] A lot of like the frequent buyers, a lot of those guys were in good with dealers and distros.

[43:39] And there weren't nearly as many dealers and distros.

[43:42] There weren't nearly as many people in the hobby and there weren't nearly as many alleys of everything.

[43:47] A lot, a lot of people had like these, you know, these deals with different dealers and distros who were drop shipping games.

[43:55] And they were literally some of the collectors were actually getting pretty much the at cost price for the game.

[44:02] Everything was moving. It was easier to like move all the allotments in and out.

[44:07] It's maybe some games are moving good today, but not like it used to be.

[44:12] Like it used to be much easier to move all your inventory.

[44:17] And then so these guys would buy these alleys.

[44:20] They would be paying less than MSRP.

[44:23] And then they would be scalping them.

[44:26] They would play them, but then they would always make money on everyone to make room for the next one.

[44:31] It was like this cycle of contempt, if you will, of constantly like trading over, but always making money, never losing anything on anything.

[44:40] And you know, times have changed a lot.

[44:43] All of this changed in COVID.

[44:46] All of it changed when alleys prices went through the roof and then the amount of alleys went through the roof.

[44:51] All right. So my thing is this.

[44:55] I think scalping is fun. I think those who have scalped really don't care what anyone else thinks.

[45:00] I think the buyer and the seller, when they're happy, they look at all the noise on pin side and the people complaining as like, I don't know, just like silly.

[45:10] Because in the end, like it is what it is.

[45:13] Like I was, I was reading on spooky's face of spooky did a great live about Beetlejuice and I was reading the comments from one of their, you know, one of their

[45:23] fan club members and I did feel for the guys like, look, I wish in the future you would have made it easier for fan club members to get a Beetlejuice.

[45:34] I am a fan club member and I tried getting through on launch day and I didn't get one and you know, and like he's like, maybe next time and it's just like,

[45:43] you know, if that's all you're going to do, you're never going to get a game. You need, you know, you need to be more proactive now.

[45:50] You need to be going on people's lists. I would even go further. I would go a step further. I don't think it's enough to just be on people's list.

[46:00] I think gang gang can we all like, I know I'm dressed like like this and I do it on purpose because I love being colorful in a very gray and boring world.

[46:11] I've gone very dull. It's gone very, what is it? Millennial gray. I love standing out because I just feel I just feel like the world needs more color.

[46:20] So if you ever wondering why I wear all this colorful stuff, I'd rather have a bright red car. It's because I think the world needs more color.

[46:27] And so, you know, the thing is the thing is I lost, what was I saying right before that? I lost my train a little bit.

[46:39] Ah, where were we? Someone like roll back the tape.

[46:44] They're trying, there are too many beages, scalpers. Okay, I was talking about the guy he got locked out. He got locked out of the fang club.

[46:52] Okay, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I remember what I was going to say. Ready for this? Why do you think?

[46:59] Okay, let's, let's, we're big boys again, right? Okay, scalping is fun. It is, it is fun. If you've ever scalped something and made more than you paid, it's fun.

[47:07] The second big boy thing I'm going to tell everybody right now is this. There's a reason why they're called dealers.

[47:19] Let's make a deal. They are individuals that want to make a deal.

[47:26] Okay, okay, big, all the big boy cargo shorts on right now. Okay. So you know a dealer.

[47:34] And if all you're going to do to seal the deal. Okay, let's, let's, like, can we be adults here to seal the deal. All you're going to do is email them and say,

[47:42] can you please put me on your list? Okay, now imagine if I'm a dealer.

[47:48] And I've got 10 guys being like, can you please put me on your list?

[47:53] And I don't know why I'm giving them those voices. But then some guy calls me up to say, Chris, how you doing?

[48:00] Look, man, I live in you canine. I'm down the street from you. I know how expensive this area the country is.

[48:07] You know, you get such a beautiful family, you know, killing and casting are gorgeous. Your wife, friend is gorgeous. I get it, bro.

[48:14] You're going to get a lot of a few of these games. Look, man, like, I'm, I'm well to do.

[48:19] And I just want to give you 500 bucks, not towards my deposit, but just can you just put me near the top of the list for beetle juice.

[48:27] Okay.

[48:29] Can you put me near the top of the list? Like all these free. Okay, who's going to get the deal?

[48:35] Who deserves the deal?

[48:37] And you know, for the people out there, they're like, it's not fair. Like what world do you live in?

[48:44] What world do you live in?

[48:47] That doesn't work on the bigger spooky dealers. They have too many big long term clients and locations.

[48:54] Well, but, but okay, JC 3737.

[48:58] Okay. So JC, if now there's the list is too long because you have too many long term customers.

[49:06] And those long term customers might have to adjust what they do to seal the deal.

[49:14] My way of sealing the deal was the longest way possible. I've worked harder to seal every deal I get now harder than anybody out here.

[49:23] Harder than any distro, harder than any rich multi-millionaire cargo short collector.

[49:30] I've got 1,100 podcasts about Pimble.

[49:33] All right, I've had over like a few million downloads of my show.

[49:39] I've spent countless hours, thousands of hours, right, making content for each and every one of you.

[49:45] That's what I did to seal the deal.

[49:48] And then you get those people, it's not fair.

[49:51] It's not fair, Canadian, it got those five. It's not fair.

[49:56] It's not fair.

[49:59] Oh, man, here comes.

[50:04] In title list.

[50:07] No, I never said I was entitled to these games.

[50:12] I didn't see, see, Joe, I was offered.

[50:19] And people like doing things for people they like.

[50:23] This is always the hardest, you know, my dear friend Angela, she passed away at age 36.

[50:29] She was my old boss, Angela.

[50:32] She was so beautiful, so amazing, so smart.

[50:35] She was like, honestly, I miss her every day.

[50:38] Every day I go to work, there's a hole in my heart for who she was and how amazing she was.

[50:46] And you know what she always said, the hardest part of the job was when you're managing people.

[50:51] You know, she's like, Chris, the hardest part of this job is like, you have to now act in a way where you're supposed to on the surface, not show that you have favorites.

[51:04] Like you have your favorite people, like you've got to treat everybody, like you like them equally.

[51:11] And you trust them equally and you want to do things for them equally.

[51:16] But that's not how the world works, right? We all have our favorites.

[51:19] You have your favorite pinball podcasters, you have your favorite relatives, your favorite friends, you have your favorite, whatever breed of dog.

[51:27] So people do nice things for people they like.

[51:29] And I think that's the part that people forget when people are like, why did he get some beer juice games?

[51:33] Like did people miss the, I would say, you know, there's a reason why they sent me a spooky shell shirt.

[51:41] And I've been touting what a, what a success beetle juice is going to be for six months telling everybody to get on the list telling how I thought this game was going to be like all like the people miss all that.

[51:53] Now they didn't need me to sell them any games. They did all the hard work on the product itself.

[51:59] But it's simply between myself and bug and Luke.

[52:04] A friendship is there.

[52:07] And that's beautiful. Like, like, I have a friendship with Brett Abyss. I don't talk about it a lot here.

[52:13] Because I don't, I don't really care to discuss it. But I have, I love what Brett's doing with JJP.

[52:21] I have a friendship with Melvin. I have a friendship.

[52:24] You know, I look, I would say like I have a, a, a, a, a, I have a respectful relationship with George Gomez. Absolutely.

[52:33] I have a respectful relationship with David Van S. I'm trying to think of like there's any pinball manufacturer that won't talk to me.

[52:40] It's just other than David fix, but he's not in the game anymore.

[52:44] So that's the thing is like when, you know, when people say, oh, you crap on the car. You know, there's nothing I really say about these companies has pretty much not true.

[52:52] Now, there is some.

[52:54] That's the wrong word because it is very subjective. What we discuss on a weekly basis about pinball is a lot of it is subjective.

[53:01] But if I were to come out here and say that, see, this is the thing. If I say like a sternalee is not worth $13,000, there's, that's true.

[53:11] The reason I know that's true is that the second hand market tanks on the game. If it was worth $13,000, then there would be demand to pay $13,000 for it.

[53:24] That would last longer than like a week.

[53:28] So they don't make a product that people perceive to be worth that.

[53:32] People have to pay that. It's like, it's like you're already paying a, Stern's charging you a scalpers price for its games.

[53:42] Regardless of the demand.

[53:44] So if you want to come out, canada as the problem and I'm nasty and I mean the real problem is whoever's setting the price is over at Stern, they are charging you a scalpers price.

[53:55] Before the demand is even in place.

[53:58] And if the game is great or not, it doesn't matter. You're paying the premium. You're paying what the game should have scalped for.

[54:05] These games all should have been 10, 5, L.E.s and the good one should have gone up to 13, 14,000.

[54:10] You know, gang, nowadays to get a topper on a stern machine that is mass produced.

[54:16] With all the accessories, you're looking at a $15,000 sternalee. It's stupid.

[54:25] The walking dead did sell out at Stern. That's all they care about now to destroy issue.

[54:32] I don't think they sold them all. Well, you know what, Joe, I think they sold through all the L.E.s. Yes.

[54:39] Because look, they've got, they've got this like, you know, Mopios tactic to the way you have to buy these games.

[54:49] Like, I'm not saying I have the answer for Stern in this distro dealer sort of, you know, the way they do business.

[54:58] It is. It's it's it's got to be hard being a distro and dealer with the way Stern, Pim, all shoves the product down your throat.

[55:08] It's got to be hard. Well, Raman, Raman, Joseph. I think that's one of Stern's biggest issues.

[55:21] I think what's really what's really appealing about barrels of fun and spooky right now is that no more will ever be made of Winchester or Beetlejuice, right?

[55:32] I mean, if I were to like pinpoint the thing I love about both of these new games, it's the long term security that they've baked into both titles.

[55:43] Look at what CGC is doing with medieval madness, right? Remember they got everybody to buy those final run of what was it?

[55:52] What do they call it when they made the 150 with the black armor? I forget the name now of a sudden the something with it is like the King's edition or like, what was the name of it?

[56:03] You guys will know this better than me.

[56:08] The medieval man is black like what was it? Come on. Someone knows the answer to this. Black armor, hundred and fifty the royal. Thank you so much.

[56:17] The royal edition of medieval mass. So they do that. They get 150 people to bite. And then they come back out with a Merlin's edition and they sell like 1200 units.

[56:30] They sell all of those and now they're I hear they're making the game again.

[56:34] Like to the point where like all of these medieval madness is no one's going to want any of them.

[56:41] I don't like that. I don't like that. I would have much rather that was the last run of that and then you move on the tri-light zone.

[56:50] By the way, we haven't talked about this much, but guess what game I keep hearing is coming back is Indiana Jones.

[56:57] So if you go look at all of a sudden now there's all these spare parts being sold for Indiana Jones because the company making the spare parts has been commissioned by Rick at Planetary to ramp up production of Indiana Jones parts.

[57:13] Because they are going to do a run of Indiana here. That's what I'm hearing.

[57:18] So there's going to be a remit. I don't know man. Like Rick at Planetary really just like I just takes forever. I don't I don't know what's going on over there.

[57:31] I don't know. Pedretti's doing it. I don't know who's doing it. But it's just.

[57:37] All like I don't know you know to throw in like remaking all of the old stuff with all of the new stuff. It's just too much. It's too much.

[57:52] I just don't think I don't know unless C.G.C. is making it. I just think the remakes are just not as good as the originals.

[57:59] I'm looking at all these issues that these guys are having with the cactus Canyon kit. Have you guys been following this thread?

[58:05] Apparently when you when you plug the kit in. It's like causing issues with people's games. Some dudes game takes five minutes to boot up now.

[58:14] Five minutes to boot up after the kits installed. How do you make a product? Like a kit. We're like one guy over here is like my games work and fine. And the next guy's game is like all messed up.

[58:26] That is the epitome of not properly testing what you're selling customers.

[58:36] So that's I think mark Richie is involved with Halo with a play mechanics and C.G.C.

[58:47] That's I mean that that's been the like the forever rumors mark Richie's Halo. I don't know. I think what is a good guess is to look at what licenses Rothrails has and go from there because it's probably one of those.

[59:05] Mark Richie did the original all manufacturers have that issue. I know a district that has a couple venom Ellie and under contract can't sell it under MSRP. Yeah well like here's what you gotta do means that does it right.

[59:23] You know you do. You unbox it you give it to Joel to play and then you sell it the next day. That's how you do it.

[59:34] Also like come on. Are you let me ask you guys a question. Are you telling me that a distro can't just have a buddy.

[59:44] But let's let's be honest here. Are you telling me it's hard for a distro to have a buddy.

[59:50] Just go on inside and list the game for sale. How or on eBay or Facebook.

[59:59] You don't think distros are having their friends list their games that they can't publicly list under map pricing for sale. Like come on like it again put on your big boy cargo pants and your cargo shorts and make the deal happen.

[01:00:14] You know sometimes I think the whole world is gun soft. You know I was watching clips of like macho man and like the way we grew up with this sort of.

[01:00:24] You know self overly self confident machismo to the world we're at now people crying like babies because someone scalped the pinball machine that they didn't get.

[01:00:33] Like either man up and get one or or or or or you know standing in the corner and cry about it. That's the kind of way I look at life. I mean life is very short.

[01:00:41] Be resourceful and look if you missed out just pay more and get it. I've got to pay if I want to replace the tires on my Dodge demon.

[01:00:50] You know a lot of these guys bought like multiple tires six years ago. The tires back then were like 500 pop so you're talking like 2000 dollars.

[01:01:00] Now this guy wants me to buy his tires for five thousand dollars. Am I crying like a baby.

[01:01:07] I don't know if I'm going to buy him there's a comparable tire that needo makes but my point is this is like yeah he didn't buy him to put on the car.

[01:01:14] He bought him just to like scalp him one day and now he's getting his scalp price.

[01:01:22] I offered a case of socket to get beetle juice to a distro and he left.

[01:01:27] I mean Joe that's.

[01:01:31] You know what I will say this whatever I do do with with the five beetle juice games the number one thing.

[01:01:40] I know Keith that's the issue right is tires only last even if you keep them in the right environment they only last for like six to ten years so.

[01:01:48] My anxiety around buying those tires is imagine paying five thousand dollars putting them on and they're like dry and they crack and then.

[01:01:58] Then yeah imagine that like and I should just buy the new needos Chris who cares if it doesn't have the demon logo on the side wall just buy the brand new needos that work just as well and are like 1600 bucks.

[01:02:11] You know of course of course to sell you know he's gonna be like oh yeah these have been kept in a climate control room yeah but it doesn't matter like.

[01:02:20] They basically will wear out.

[01:02:25] I've been real lazy like I stopped even like putting the car cover on my demon it just got rained on I don't even care you get older gang like.

[01:02:33] I mean I love the demon and it's so much fun but it's you know it's still just a car like it is what it is.

[01:02:44] Yeah I know I'm gonna get the new tires you're right.

[01:02:56] Mickey Thompson's I just don't like the way the the drag radios look on a street car they look funky like they put the Mickey Thompson's on the demon 170 and it just it just looks stupid I actually don't like the way the demon 170 looks it looks like.

[01:03:11] It looks to like like a Guido prep the car for like a car is in coffee show like show obsession it just doesn't look street it looks track too much track.

[01:03:26] Well yeah I don't I also in my six years of owning the Dodge demon I've never taken off the fully taken off the traction control in the car.

[01:03:40] It's too much power.

[01:03:42] And you know this car let's you spin the tires but if it starts to step out too much it it it it'll like it'll save you from crashing your car.

[01:03:57] Are you going to touch pinball to do a midnight man is for back to the future I think so I might try to work that in.

[01:04:05] You know what I should do is I should try to go there on my way to Japan because I'm I'm turning the big five out next September and I am Brendan I are going to go back to Japan.

[01:04:15] So I'm just sort of yeah I was my plan the scout these five Beetlejuice games to pay for my trip to Japan.

[01:04:25] You ruined my dreams kids.

[01:04:28] You're ruined my dreams.

[01:04:31] What else you guys want to talk about and hey look sorry for the drama earlier you know me like I just I always like having fun you know certain I haven't had to do this much I've only blocked in the history of doing Patreon for five years I've only blocked like four people.

[01:04:51] And and I mean is when I say this it's been after multiple multiple times I've asked people to just be more respectful like you can you can disagree with what I say but to go after me.

[01:05:06] Like I just it's just not it's like the one power I have is to is to decide who actually gets to hang out in my house and you see how this is we we are not we are not a community that shuts down discourse or shuts down contrary and ways to think about pinball absolutely not.

[01:05:28] It's funny to I do think the Canadian pinball podcast has been the most positive I will say that you know I again like I just don't know the whole project pinball thing I don't I hear so many different things from so many different people that one site once it's like that I don't even want anything to do with it because I just I don't I think it's I think it's a can of worms to try to open up.

[01:05:54] And I'd rather just stick to making fun of the walking dead Ali price.

[01:05:59] Every time I see those heads on the slingshots I'm just like this is so embarrassing I'm embarrassed for them it's like they don't they don't know what to do it's turn.

[01:06:08] They just really don't know what to do they don't know how to like elevate because you know I can I just say this I don't really like.

[01:06:16] I don't like the way the back box looks with the narrower speakers does anyone else feel this way with me I actually don't like the way it looks I don't think it looks better than I like this circular speakers better I just think it like I look at the beetle juice with the smaller screen and the circular speaker grill I just it looks so much better than just these.

[01:06:39] Tarot these these tiny narrow I don't like the way it looks I think Jersey jacks look great with the speakers up top.

[01:06:46] But I just don't like the way the new storm platform looks.

[01:06:49] Yeah they look they look really rectangular they look like candy bar size opening I just don't like the way it looks.

[01:06:57] I think you can do so much more with a circle I think there's like harmony in the circle I just think when you when you put cutouts and lights in the circle everything just you know when the lights go around and it just looks better.

[01:07:18] Looks like everybody likes the circle to.

[01:07:25] How you guys doing otherwise I guess I'm going to turn the floor over to you guys right now.

[01:07:30] Ask me anything basically I'll answer any question you ask me like it can be pin more related or not.

[01:07:39] Yeah I think the white rectangle looks terrible doesn't blend into the art it doesn't blend into the back box it just doesn't look good.

[01:07:48] Yeah they don't I don't think they don't use any of the bigger screen.

[01:07:53] Goonies is a pass for me goonies is an instant buy for me.

[01:08:02] Everything is a letter box walking dead was a big mist for stern I like the circle way more.

[01:08:14] They just jammed in as a big monitor without changing the translate size.

[01:08:21] Yeah well I think they could add it a bigger screen.

[01:08:27] I think they could have gone more J. J. P. I think they should have I really do.

[01:08:31] Yeah sorry if you if you're I look I think stern needed to take a bigger leap forward I do I think they played it safe.

[01:08:39] And it just doesn't look like it doesn't have a wow like they need they need a I don't know it's stern never going to evolve into a new or platform that's wow I don't know.

[01:08:55] Yeah I agree the translate looks off now it all looks off it looks it looks like wonky.

[01:09:04] Where you're going to fit Beetlejuice back to the future and goonies.

[01:09:09] That's a good question.

[01:09:12] Well I think I'm going to move GnR out and maybe store it and then I think I can get two games upstairs maybe and then one in the garage.

[01:09:21] Although the the smartest thing for me to do.

[01:09:25] Would just be to turn the garage into my game room.

[01:09:30] I keep like avoiding it.

[01:09:34] I because what I might do is this.

[01:09:37] At this age with my kids being the age they are.

[01:09:41] Driving around in the demon like I might just put the demon in more long torn like long torn long term storage which there is right here in bridge port Connecticut they trickle charge it they it's like three hundred bucks a month.

[01:09:56] But then I can turn the insurance off so it's basically the same as having the car with insurance.

[01:10:01] Connecticut does that you don't have to trade the plates in.

[01:10:04] Now I'm not selling the demon the demons demon is going to kill me in one day it's got my name on it's got a name on the damn car.

[01:10:10] It's got it's got his dad his name on the car like.

[01:10:13] Some things in life you just hold on there it's not I don't need the money I'm keeping the demon I pay I have nothing but bond memories of the demon.

[01:10:20] And it's it's a car that when I when my children.

[01:10:23] Drive it they'll always be remembered of me.

[01:10:27] So I just want to keep it in the family.

[01:10:30] So I might turn the garage into my game room.

[01:10:36] And take out there's like a dog bath like I can.

[01:10:43] I can renovate my garage to be a super cool like podcasting studio or what about another idea gang.

[01:10:52] What about if canada.

[01:10:55] Maybe I don't know maybe looks into having a pinball showroom somewhere locally here.

[01:11:05] Why would you do that canada.

[01:11:09] Are you a man that knows about closing deals.

[01:11:13] What if that's where I'll play my pins.

[01:11:19] Michael delete that message and let's talk brother I'm serious.

[01:11:25] What if canada is tired of watching everybody else.

[01:11:32] Do the things that he could do to.

[01:11:37] I don't know I think people I think I think some people might buy some games from canada.

[01:11:41] What do you think Michael.

[01:11:46] All interesting stuff.

[01:11:56] Wait you'd actually try to.

[01:11:59] Take what you have 12 years of experience.

[01:12:03] And then do the next logical thing.

[01:12:06] Why would you do that.

[01:12:08] I only live once maybe take a few risks every once in a while and see what happens.

[01:12:12] I'm not going to bankrupt you.

[01:12:15] Everything you have that you really need in life you have now it's time to have even more fun.

[01:12:24] Wait pinball out in public where you can make money and sell games to all these very wealthy people.

[01:12:36] I'm a guy with an outgoing charismatic personality where everywhere I go.

[01:12:42] I make friends and meet people and then spark conversation and all these people have nothing but disposable income.

[01:12:50] And yet nobody's trying to sell them anything that they could snap their fingers and afford.

[01:12:56] Let's just hang out on the inside and let everybody moan and groan all day long.

[01:13:00] Maybe that's not the smartest way.

[01:13:02] Maybe there's a benefit to being located here.

[01:13:05] Michael you get this.

[01:13:08] Yes you can franchi.

[01:13:11] Watch me.

[01:13:13] Watch me.

[01:13:14] You know you never know until you try right.

[01:13:17] You never know until you try.

[01:13:20] I think it's absolutely doable to not become a shell and let and order people games if you want to order their games.

[01:13:26] The one question I have if you think about it like it is the one thing I'm really like loving is this whole.

[01:13:31] How do some dealers offer free shipping and others don't what is is the free shipping how they get the the customers is that is at the move.

[01:13:42] Is that the move like if if I offer you free shipping.

[01:13:46] Then you'll go with me so that's basically a way to undercut the map deal by 500 bucks.

[01:13:54] You know Michael you get it though Michael the thing too is like people just don't people just underestimate.

[01:14:09] The power of still the door to door.

[01:14:15] In real life sales of stuff.

[01:14:19] Like it's just you know everyone thinks that you need to have this like pinball show to do it but it sure.

[01:14:29] But I bet the majority of people selling games are selling them outside of like their geographical area to because there's not even there's not enough people there.

[01:14:37] But we got a lot of people here it's very dense.

[01:14:43] So free shipping no text alright let's do that.

[01:14:48] Let's do that.

[01:14:51] So I guess the other question I have and maybe some of you notice like so is the rumor true.

[01:14:57] And I'll just ask this because I'm a you know me I'm always going to be about transparency I think I think it's absolutely comical that there's like hidden secrets of the dealers and distros.

[01:15:10] Michael Michael what you don't think I have access to text the pinball text.

[01:15:24] Do you think Michael do you think a card a guy that owns a car dealership is like.

[01:15:32] Knows how to do all the mechanical stuff to the car that's interesting I don't I know guy who owns like 20 car dealerships he's not he's not a mechanic.

[01:15:39] He's a businessman.

[01:15:44] So here's the thing.

[01:15:47] Is there a wear is there anyone know this.

[01:15:51] Is there a warehouse.

[01:15:54] Is there a warehouse.

[01:15:58] Somewhere in Chicago that drop ships the games for dealers and distros.

[01:16:06] Like are you telling me that when a dealer orders Harry Potter games that all of those Harry potters are sent basically to the distro and then on to the customer.

[01:16:23] Does anyone know the answer to this like so all these turn you you really think like.

[01:16:29] And then the bad pinball is taking.

[01:16:32] We pay orders.

[01:16:35] Five walking dead alise 10 premiums and six pro like he's got he's taking delivery of all those games.

[01:16:42] I think he has to buy all those games.

[01:16:46] But I don't think he's shipping them until he has a buyer I don't think they're all being shipped to him and then he's got to ship him again out so I this is just something I'm just curious like.

[01:16:57] This the warehouse exists but they charge a pretty penny from what I heard.

[01:17:03] Yeah.

[01:17:06] But like okay.

[01:17:13] How many games were in that warehouse and flip it on to warehouse I'm just curious I really I'm just right now I'm just information gathering.

[01:17:26] I know this shed.

[01:17:41] Okay well I look I'm I'm just curious what what everybody does.

[01:17:49] I think it's going to be funny to like to see how this all pans out because it's just going to be super you know look.

[01:17:59] I already know that if I do anything in this hobby I'm going to have a decent amount of people that love canators pinball podcasts you know give it a try.

[01:18:09] I don't mind telling you let's see this I don't mind telling you all this just.

[01:18:14] DM me and yeah.

[01:18:17] Marco.

[01:18:22] Who owns this warehouse Marco that has to be the wealthiest man in all the pinball talk about the smartest middleman ever so there is a there's someone who owns a warehouse in Chicago.

[01:18:34] That charges dealers and distros a monthly fee for every game they hold for you while you try to find the customer.

[01:18:46] So talk about like total like financial losses on games that have no demand because you're not only did you have to absorb those games because you don't want to lose your inventory or a lot of values.

[01:19:02] Please but now you're paying a monthly fee to have those like venom premiums just sit there forever.

[01:19:16] Michael stop stop giving away our ideas on the Facebook live can I can I make that can I make that request if you brother let's talk.

[01:19:30] That's basically getting paid for every stern machine people don't want every month.

[01:19:35] Simply because he's like got aware now look this this mystery warehouse does anyone has anyone seen it with the own eyes.

[01:19:43] You know I because I keep hearing like just thousands of games piling up now like it feels like that scene in Indiana Jones and the you know the military base with the architect covenant has anyone seen this said warehouse fill to fill to the brim with unsolved pinball machines that could absolutely.

[01:19:59] collapse the market if all that got released into the wild.

[01:20:08] Winchester mystery warehouse no I literally I you know what I love gang is like so much of this.

[01:20:15] I know that like coin taker has the inventory in house I know that automated has the inventory in house so Josh you've been there.

[01:20:23] Did you take a picture.

[01:20:28] Do you have a do you have a picture of it.

[01:20:33] It's surrounded by trucking companies.

[01:20:37] Does anyone have a photo of this like said mythological pinball drop ship warehouse anybody.

[01:20:51] There was a distro in Atlanta with like 300 games in his own personal warehouse. Yes you that sounds like that sounds like automated he's got like a few hundred games.

[01:21:01] I mean millions of dollars in inventory this is this is that's that's not the business I'm getting into just so you know.

[01:21:12] That is not the business I'm getting into I'm not taking millions of dollars and locking it up.

[01:21:19] I love that you can give stars and put stuff on me this amazing keep it going guys.

[01:21:24] I love that you can like.

[01:21:26] Why would you lock up millions of dollars and unsolved pins the margins aren't good enough.

[01:21:33] You know because if you think about like okay what is the margin.

[01:21:37] What is the margin on a ten thousand dollars during premium.

[01:21:45] What is the margin.

[01:21:51] Happy birthday to carry hardy I totally forgot I emailed him or texted him this morning happy birthday carry can everybody say happy birthday carry hardy.

[01:22:01] What's the margin on a stern print you think it two thousand dollars on a premium.

[01:22:08] That's a lot no.

[01:22:12] I love it this is why it's like this is why it's so funny to me like everybody's all over the place and yet.

[01:22:25] I think I think the Ellie is I heard the Ellie is like twenty three hundred or twenty five hundred.

[01:22:42] You know you know let me ask you guys a question do you do you like me sort of knocking on this door and.

[01:22:50] Sort of trying to like I don't know expose some of this I mark I'm going to give you a call.

[01:23:05] Marco I I want to give you a call this week brother I because you know what Marco Marco knows is better than anybody like Marco special he's like.

[01:23:19] I want to learn from someone who knows what they're talking about versus asking the public to guess because it so Marco I appreciate Marco can you can you can you.

[01:23:32] Can you DM me your your cell phone number brother you can either DM Chris.

[01:23:39] Or can a day but I would love to like I'll text you and then we can get a call going I this is great like.

[01:23:47] No I'm not becoming a distro but I you know I may want to sell some stuff I may want to sell some stuff I may want to set up a little showroom I may want to have a little spot.

[01:23:56] In Connecticut.

[01:23:58] My little spot doesn't have to be big but it's going to be fun.

[01:24:03] And it's going to do great because we need more stuff that's analog out in the world we need more fun times in the world we need more color in the world maybe turns maybe turns on this up they right making these games so damn colorful like maybe we should be less critical of them because the world does need more color.

[01:24:21] My dealer only makes 500 dollars on a spooky says Kelly well Kelly you know why because your dealer is probably getting his games from a distro not from spooky.

[01:24:43] But I have heard that the spooky margins are I think the smallest you know where stern gives a much better margin.

[01:24:52] Problem is nobody wants to damn stern game like not like they used to like the challenge with stern is like you know when you're sitting on the the Venoms and the John wicks.

[01:25:04] I can imagine and you know correct me from wrong people but I have to imagine that you can make a hundred thousand dollars in one day selling a lease on a hot game like jaws.

[01:25:16] And then be stuck with over a hundred thousand dollars in unsolved John wick inventory so easily I think that's to me I would say that's the trick of the business and the problem the problem for stern now is.

[01:25:33] This is why I would rather be like Joe new heart right now because Joe is like doesn't have to deal with the stern shenanigans and Joe is always in good with the other companies and I feel like Joe being now Joe's missed out on all of those big stern windfall games you know like jordan sell hundreds of godzilla's.

[01:25:54] But you know his ship might come in now with the spooky stuff because he gets the most spooky games.

[01:25:59] But the margins aren't the best but his risk is lower you know I'm saying he doesn't have to.

[01:26:05] I'm sorry.

[01:26:07] Absorb 40 John wicks or 30 Venoms or like you know I feel like King Kong's in the same boat who's buying a King Kong premium at ten thousand dollars when the Ellie is already slid down to that.

[01:26:19] And that's the danger you know for I would look at like the modern.

[01:26:24] The modern thing is like well.

[01:26:28] You know you get like.

[01:26:30] Stern's model only works at the games or bangers and like you can move those Ellie's instantly and that money's money's realized.

[01:26:38] But even if you make 20 even if you make 20 let's say you sell 10 at $2,500 profit.

[01:26:46] Right.

[01:26:49] Let's say let's say 10 all these at $2,500 each right.

[01:26:56] Was that $2,500 dollars.

[01:27:03] Right.

[01:27:05] Am I doing the math right.

[01:27:10] And then you take that money and you got to buy like all those premiums of John Wick.

[01:27:23] Well look gang I want to say happy Saturday this is this has been a fun show for me I hope it was a fun show for you.

[01:27:30] You know every week we get together and I always know I never have notes.

[01:27:35] I never I never have show notes I don't even sometimes even know what I want to show topic to be this morning I woke up I've been up early I'm a little tired from a very early wake up.

[01:27:46] But what I like to do is I kind of peruse pin side.

[01:27:51] And I like to sort of just kind of dabble in what's happening around all these games.

[01:27:57] And then I like to just do this just conversation like if we were at a bar right now for 90 minutes we could we could keep going you guys see it right.

[01:28:06] This is what I love I love just hanging out with you guys chat and pinball.

[01:28:12] And I really am excited about what's to come in this hobby both for me personally I think you're going to I think you're going to get excited by some of the fun stuff and we're going to we're going to try some things if it works out it works out if it doesn't it doesn't the podcast is never going away I'm never becoming a bye bye bye chill I think you will see you will see me do something different and get and gang remember this look look at my face right now looking to these eyes.

[01:28:38] I know when people say like you can't sell a game and not be a shale you can't sell a game and still do a part do I look like a guy that can't do something differently than everybody else do I look like a guy that is not going to shake up the system a little bit maybe in a way that's going to be fun for everybody do I not look like a guy that looks at a model that's been around for 30 40 years and says hey maybe we just break this a little bit.

[01:29:06] Why is everybody doing it that way got the internet now why yeah I'll pay a little a little drop ship fee from a guy cool.

[01:29:16] But again deals deals I know you can see my eyes.

[01:29:24] People who don't want a use game or don't know about pencider don't want to give a stranger 10k cash.

[01:29:32] Well you know the good news is man you know the good news is I'm not a stranger to thousands of people that buy Pima machines every year.

[01:29:42] I'm not a stranger to any of them they know exactly where to find me they know they're going to get me and they know like I won't stop until people are satisfied you know that I mean there's if there's one thing you can say about me is I won't stop until people are satisfied.

[01:29:59] And customer service and communicates what I do for a living nobody has more experience and customer service and communication than me and you know I've watched this hobby have terrible of both terrible.

[01:30:18] Terrible.

[01:30:21] And it's crazy to me when I hear stories like I emailed C.G.C. and having her back for a month what what who do you even email over there I don't even know who is even the person to talk to at C.G.C.

[01:30:33] When you deal with canada you deal with canada.

[01:30:38] We've always been shaken up this system you can't handle this business come on Daniel.

[01:30:45] Daniel honestly you have no idea the kinds of pressure I'm under at work the clients I deal with you have no idea what Daniel trust me it's the other way around brother.

[01:30:55] A pinball dealer or a distro can never walk into my job for a week and survive what they would get they wouldn't know how to answer the assignments they wouldn't be able to walk into a room with like C.S.E. people that don't want to buy from you and get them to sell something okay come on bro like let's let's stick to our last year.

[01:31:13] You don't think I can sell a damn pinball machine.

[01:31:16] Oh you can't do this.

[01:31:21] Yeah okay it's not too hard.

[01:31:28] Are you going to walk around Rueid and dress like that hell yeah you can't do both.
