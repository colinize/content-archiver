[00:00] There's a guy with a guy, the guy, the guy, the guy.

[00:05] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[00:07] Perhaps I was a ticket to the dark side.

[00:09] Somewhere inside my chair, who would get my heart down.

[00:11] And even though we both came from the same place,

[00:14] it's the money in the fame, made us all change placements.

[00:16] It's not.

[00:23] Isn't it crazy that we put out more podcasts

[00:26] than total number of alien and big Lebowski pinball machines

[00:31] that have shipped to date?

[00:32] We're on episode 208 of Canadian's pinball podcast.

[00:36] I'm your host, Canadian Happy Friday, everybody.

[00:38] Got a great episode for all you guys out there.

[00:41] I interviewed a pinball fanatic over in the Chicago area

[00:45] about an hour outside of Chicago.

[00:47] His name is Dave Falgren.

[00:49] Dave is going to join the show in a little bit

[00:51] and talk to us about pinball.

[00:52] Now, the reason I wanted to talk to Dave is he's played

[00:55] a lot of the new games.

[00:57] Houdini, Pirates of the Caribbean, Guardians of the Galaxy,

[01:01] Star Wars.

[01:02] He lives near this really great arcade level 257.

[01:05] I think it's called something like that.

[01:07] So we're going to get his opinions about those new titles.

[01:10] Before we do that, we're going to do what we always do.

[01:12] We're going to go down some news items.

[01:14] Then I'm going to read some of your emails

[01:16] and then we're going to get into the interview.

[01:18] All right. How's that sound for Friday podcasts?

[01:20] We get right to it.

[01:21] Oh, my.

[01:22] All right.

[01:23] So here's the first bit of news.

[01:25] And this is probably the biggest news of the year in pinball.

[01:28] I hope you're sitting down.

[01:30] Get ready.

[01:31] A lot of you are going to be emailing me to see pictures of this

[01:34] because it's done.

[01:35] It's completed after many months of hard work,

[01:39] of dedication, of passion.

[01:42] I finally have completed the Hilton hoodie

[01:46] that will be making its world debut

[01:49] at the Texas Pinball Festival down in Dallas, Texas,

[01:54] March, like 15th and 16th and 17th and 18th,

[01:57] whatever the dates are.

[01:58] But the Hilton hoodie that we promised we would make

[02:01] and hand deliver to Hilton himself is completed.

[02:05] Now here's the thing.

[02:06] I want to share it with you guys

[02:08] and so you can see how amazing it turned out.

[02:11] Now here's what you need to do.

[02:13] You need to email me at canadapinballatgmail.com

[02:17] with the subject Hilton hoodie

[02:19] and I will email you back the images of the Hilton hoodie.

[02:23] Now I'm also debating.

[02:25] And you guys let me know.

[02:27] I might actually sell you guys the Hilton hoodie

[02:30] and we can make a small run of them.

[02:32] Maybe we'll do some sort of like super limited addition

[02:36] of the Hilton hoodie where you guys have to submit videos

[02:39] of why you deserve to wear the Hilton hoodie.

[02:41] But when you see this thing, trust me.

[02:43] Trust me.

[02:44] I think we captured the spirit and the story of Mr. Hilton

[02:49] so perfectly in a hooded sweatshirt.

[02:52] And what's great about it is when we give it to him,

[02:54] he can now wear more than one hoodie during a show.

[02:57] So I'm excited.

[02:58] I know you're excited to see it.

[03:00] And I wish we could put it up on Pinside.

[03:02] You know what's funny about Pinside is

[03:04] for as much back and forth as that site does in terms of members

[03:07] battling it out.

[03:09] If someone were to upload,

[03:10] here is the Hilton hoodie reveal on Pinside.

[03:13] How many seconds before the moderation team there

[03:16] would get their panties in a wad and delete that thread?

[03:20] Right? Maybe like five seconds?

[03:22] But I'll say this.

[03:23] If anyone uploads the Hilton hoodie reveal on Pinside

[03:29] as a thread with images,

[03:31] if you do that for this podcast,

[03:33] I will send you a very special addition

[03:36] t-shirt of Canadian pinball podcast.

[03:38] That's going to be a one-of-one

[03:40] that'll probably be worth millions one day.

[03:42] All right?

[03:43] So that's news item number one.

[03:45] News item number two,

[03:46] let's go down our list.

[03:47] American pinball,

[03:49] they have announced that the inner art decals for Houdini are now ready.

[03:54] They're $99 and you can either buy them

[03:57] if you already have a Houdini

[03:59] or you can order them from your distributor

[04:02] and you can also order them to be installed at the factory.

[04:05] Now, I don't know if you've seen these things

[04:07] but they look really great.

[04:08] I love the inner art decals on Houdini.

[04:11] I think Houdini would look great both of those inner art decals

[04:14] but also with mirror blades,

[04:16] which I still think are some of the best things you can put in a pinball machine.

[04:19] But look, $99, not too bad to make that game look even better.

[04:23] And for $7,000,

[04:25] I think it's hard to deny that you get a lot,

[04:28] you get a lot in Houdini, right?

[04:29] There's no pro,

[04:30] there's no premium,

[04:31] there's no different variations.

[04:33] Everything is jammed into that game for $7,000.

[04:36] The Magic Glass, which is their version of the PDI Glass,

[04:40] it's a little delayed and it's coming in at a little bit of a higher cost

[04:44] because they are adding a sort of a coating to it

[04:47] that should make it easier to clean and less prone to scratching.

[04:51] So we look forward to seeing that.

[04:53] I think PDI Glass is one of the greatest things you can put in a game.

[04:56] I think inner art decals are great mods.

[04:59] I also think pin stadium lighting.

[05:01] These are the things that these are the first things I do.

[05:04] I hate seeing the black inside of the cabinet there on a play field.

[05:08] I think that real estate always needs some art.

[05:11] I want to say a final point about Houdini.

[05:13] And you're going to hear more about it when we talk to Dave

[05:15] because he's played the game and I haven't.

[05:17] I want to say that I'm really appreciative of Josh Kugler

[05:21] and all he's doing in the thread to talk to customers

[05:25] and to walk people through issues and to explain things.

[05:29] And if someone has an issue with the code,

[05:31] he's in there immediately helping.

[05:34] And it's such great customer service.

[05:36] And it's great transparency between the company and pinball enthusiasts

[05:41] because they know that the only people buying Houdini right now

[05:45] are the people that have been following the story of American pinball

[05:48] and a lot of those people are on pinside.

[05:50] And Josh is doing a great job in being both the coder

[05:55] and the customer service rep for the company.

[05:58] And I think that's great.

[06:00] I don't think we can say the same thing when we look at some of the other companies out there

[06:04] in terms of how engaged they are with the hobby.

[06:07] Right? I mean, on the last podcast I talked about how you've got Chicago gaming

[06:12] asking people not even to post on pinside.

[06:14] Like they're avoiding going into the threads to talk about potential issues with the game

[06:19] where Josh is jumping headfirst and handling any issues people have.

[06:24] And I want to commend him on that.

[06:26] I've also been going back and forth with Josh via email on October Fest.

[06:32] This has been like, look, I get it.

[06:35] I get it. Everyone keeps telling me, Chris, you don't get it like sexy women

[06:39] and beer and music, the pinball machine could be fun.

[06:43] And my response to that is, of course, it could be fun.

[06:47] But why take the risk to make something that could be fun when you could go get a theme

[06:53] that is immediately fun and also has an immediate audience built into it.

[06:58] And look, I'm not even saying like it has to be a movie or a TV show.

[07:02] But there are far greater storylines out there and themes out there that have much larger following than October Fest.

[07:11] That's all I'm saying.

[07:12] And I kind of feel like they were exploring the potential of making October Fest.

[07:17] But I heard if they do make it Ryan C over head to head pinball who also thinks it could be a fun theme.

[07:24] He's going to buy the first 10 people.

[07:27] He's going to buy their pins for them.

[07:29] So I hope Ryan holds true to that.

[07:31] You know, let's see what happens with October Fest.

[07:34] I wouldn't build the damn thing.

[07:36] All right. What else is going on in pinball?

[07:38] So Stern, there is new Batman code that is out.

[07:41] It is code 0.88.

[07:43] And nobody was really expecting it so soon.

[07:46] It's great. This game continues.

[07:48] Each code update to make the game better and better and better.

[07:52] In this code update, the following major things have been implemented.

[07:56] You no longer can stack major villains in the game, which is a good thing.

[08:00] The game originally came with major villains stacking off.

[08:04] And I love that they just removed it.

[08:06] Now you can't do it.

[08:08] The reason why is there's so much other stuff.

[08:10] The stack in the game, you can stack a villain with a minor villain,

[08:14] with the bat turn going on.

[08:17] There's like four to five things you can stack at one time in that game.

[08:22] That it's so silly to also have the major villains stack.

[08:26] So you don't need to.

[08:28] And I want to say this about Batman because I heard people over at another podcast,

[08:34] Slam tilt, or sort of like making fun of me that I flipped flopped on Batman 66.

[08:40] And I've been the first person to admit that of course I ragged on Batman 66 as did everybody else.

[08:47] And I thought the game was a cash grab piece of shit when it first came out.

[08:52] And it was.

[08:53] There was nothing in it.

[08:55] The game wasn't there.

[08:56] They launched a game with with not even like beta code.

[09:00] And it's saddened people's homes for almost a year.

[09:03] And I want to read another thing I got because I get a lot of flack for owning a Batman.

[09:08] And saying that I love the game on my soundcloud.

[09:13] Someone wrote in.

[09:14] This is from Cameron Van.

[09:16] He wrote, you have to stop selling Batman 66.

[09:19] It still sucks regardless of what you say.

[09:22] Every time I hear you say Batman 66 will be one of the most sought after games.

[09:27] I chuckle.

[09:28] You also lose credibility after dogging it for a long time.

[09:33] And then you buy one and start praising it.

[09:36] There are a dozen of games with actor singer callouts.

[09:39] None of them are unique or collectible because of it.

[09:42] T2 has Arnold's voice.

[09:44] Dirty Harry has Eastwood, Elvira, a scared stiff, Metallica, Ghostbusters, etc. etc.

[09:51] Well Cameron, like look, the point I want to make here is this.

[09:55] I don't care if people get mad that I am enjoying Batman 66.

[10:02] I don't think Pimball needs to be a hobby where the people who own the games are personally slammed for their decisions.

[10:10] Now the reason why I think Batman is going to be one of the most sought after stirrns for a long time to come is because unlike all those other games you mentioned,

[10:21] the one thing Batman has going for it is Lyman Sheets.

[10:25] Now I used to be one of those people on the sidelines who would say whatever.

[10:30] Lyman and the Walking Dead, Lyman and Metallica, it shouldn't come down to the coder to make a game great.

[10:37] It should come down to the world under glass.

[10:40] And you know, I've done a little bit of a 180 in the sense that like, you know, the Batman world under glass that is there.

[10:46] While it's not everything I would have loved it to have been, right?

[10:50] I think there are still elements in that game that the crane doesn't make sense in the Batman universe.

[10:55] It's still an amazing mech and it's implemented nicely into the game.

[10:59] But the game is colorful, the game is fun, the game is some of the best music and the best coding.

[11:05] And it's one of the most fun Pimball experiences I've had and I think a lot of that comes down to the combination of Christopher Franchise artwork

[11:15] of Lyman Sheets' amazing coding of the music, the callouts.

[11:20] I mean the game has so much personality and like maybe you haven't played a new version of the code.

[11:25] Maybe you just think the game is clunky and shoots like shit.

[11:28] There are a lot of shot issues with Batman 66.

[11:31] But I still think if you say what are some of the best Stern Pimball experiences out there, I really do think Batman 66 is going to be near the top of that list.

[11:41] And when you add up like the fact that it's a theme that universally people love and it's Adam West, like last project that he worked on before he died.

[11:51] And the callouts and the integration with the game are so seamless in Batman.

[11:57] Look, and it's not just me saying this man, go tell me how many Metallica Ellie's, how many Ghostbusters Ellie's, how many dirty Harry's, how many scared stiffs can you find for sale on eBay, on Pimball?

[12:10] How many of them are in the same place?

[12:13] How many Batman Ellie's and SL's do you see for sale?

[12:17] How many?

[12:18] Absolutely zero.

[12:20] Alright, there's a reason for that.

[12:22] These things will be sought after simply because people will not part with the game.

[12:27] Alright, moving on from Batman, I think it's a great game.

[12:30] But if you don't like it, I respect your decision.

[12:33] And I definitely flipped flopped on it.

[12:35] I don't know why people have to make fun of me.

[12:37] I think the world flipped flopped on it.

[12:39] You can't avoid it.

[12:41] Dutch Pimball.

[12:42] So there's a discussion in the Dutch Pimball thread about what will be better quality, the Chinese version of the game or the Dutch version made by ARA.

[12:52] I don't know.

[12:53] Alright, I don't know.

[12:54] It is kind of sad to see that this thread now is people arguing about the quality of an unbuilt machine by China versus a machine built in the Netherlands.

[13:05] But I'll say this.

[13:07] Dutch Pimball's quality hasn't really been stellar.

[13:11] Like the machine at Sunshine Laundromat in Brooklyn has been broken forever.

[13:17] The game has had many issues.

[13:19] While some of you out there might have a game without issues, here's probably why.

[13:23] Because they've only shipped 40 to 50 of these things.

[13:27] Those 40 to 50 big Lebowski's are in the hands of high-end collectors.

[13:32] High-end collectors for the most part.

[13:34] Who know they have a rare game that doesn't have any support right now.

[13:38] That they couldn't get replacement parts.

[13:41] So I highly doubt that the big Lebowski's that are out there are getting played hundreds of times.

[13:47] Okay, so the issues that might pop up might not pop up because the games aren't being played much.

[13:53] People are babying these games.

[13:55] The ones that I've seen on location, they've got issues.

[13:58] They're turned off constantly.

[14:00] So, you know, and then you get to the point of like, will the game being made in China?

[14:05] Will it have the solid feel of the ARA game?

[14:08] I know someone played the new Chinese version and said no, it felt cheap like a stern.

[14:13] I don't know about that.

[14:14] I don't know.

[14:15] You'd have to play both games back to back.

[14:17] The problem with the big Lebowski thread is you get guys like this too.

[14:20] This guy, K-Clank, I'm Pinside.

[14:22] He was basically saying like, I've got the ARA version and it's going to be the best built ever.

[14:27] And he wrote, he could tell you right now, I wouldn't sell mine.

[14:31] If you offered me, he does what he says, if you offered him $100,000, he wouldn't sell his big Lebowski Pimbal machine.

[14:38] Are you kidding me, man?

[14:39] Really?

[14:40] $100,000 and you wouldn't sell the big Lebowski.

[14:44] I can't tell if that's a testament to how great the game is or how stupid Pimbal collectors are.

[14:51] You get out when you make a $90,000 profit on a Pimbal machine.

[14:56] That's the time you get out.

[14:58] Look, I don't know how this story is going to end.

[15:02] We know that Dutch keep saying that we're not expected to start building games until April, May.

[15:08] I would assume that's going to be more May.

[15:11] You really think big Lebowski's are going to be rolling off the line or the production line in like six weeks.

[15:16] I don't.

[15:17] I really feel bad for all of you in on this journey because you have nothing you can do but wait.

[15:22] And you know it's about to come.

[15:24] The new buyers are going to cut the line and you're going to wait and you might never get your game.

[15:30] I'm just saying like that there's a good possibility of that because if they don't get new orders,

[15:35] there's no way they can order the parts to get the production line going.

[15:40] I hope you get your games.

[15:42] I just think the whole thing is a travesty.

[15:45] Someone said something like Dutch Pimbals had minor issues over the years.

[15:49] Minor issues.

[15:50] Minor issues.

[15:51] They are three years delayed.

[15:53] They have taken people's money for four years and they've only shipped 40 games in almost like a four and a half year period.

[16:01] They lied to consumers.

[16:03] They tried to release a Bob 3.0 package to hoodwing people to go in to salvage the big Lebowski.

[16:10] The whole thing has been a disaster.

[16:13] This is as bad as it gets in business.

[16:16] You're lied to.

[16:17] You didn't get what you paid for and the company's got to now run to China to try and pull a rabbit out of a hat.

[16:23] How can it get any worse?

[16:25] These eternal optimists in Pimbal.

[16:28] There's another name for those people.

[16:30] You're suckers.

[16:31] You're going to lose your money if you're an internal Pimbal optimist.

[16:34] The smart man buys a box that has a game inside it that's sitting at a distributor's warehouse.

[16:40] All right.

[16:42] In the alien thread, there's a new Pimbal topic and it's called Flingate 2018.

[16:47] What do I mean by Flingate?

[16:49] Well, there's a whole conversation around the magnet in front of the Xenomorph.

[16:53] Is your magnet flinging in the ball?

[16:56] Because my magnet just captures the ball.

[16:58] It doesn't fling it.

[17:00] People are like, oh my god, my magnet's not flinging.

[17:04] Look, I guess there's some adjustment that can be made and then the magnet moves the ball slowly or a little bit.

[17:11] The big question mark for alien right now, when are the Ellie owners going to get their games?

[17:16] I mean, I can't believe it, guys.

[17:18] We are in March of 2018 in like next week and they are still not shipping.

[17:25] Remember, Andrew said originally the game was coming out like March 2015 or 2015?

[17:30] I think it was 2015.

[17:31] That was the original ship date of alien.

[17:33] So you guys have had your money in there for three years.

[17:36] You know what must suck for you guys who gave Andrew highway like $8,000?

[17:40] I think Amazon stock back then was like two to three hundred dollars a share.

[17:46] Amazon stock just hit $1500 a share.

[17:51] So all you fools who had your money frozen with these pinball companies,

[17:55] you could have made tens of thousands of dollars in the time frame.

[18:00] You locked your money in with this company.

[18:03] And the reason why I call people who did that foolish is because you can go on eBay today

[18:09] and someone selling like an alien for like $10 or $11,000.

[18:12] So here's why I think everyone who locks money and early is dumb.

[18:16] Because imagine if you made $60, $70, $80,000 in the stock market during the same time period,

[18:24] then you could go buy that $10,000 alien and have like an extra $60,000, $70,000 in the bank

[18:30] off of the same principal investment that you handed Andrew highway.

[18:35] So that's Canada, your financial advisor.

[18:38] Never ever ever again.

[18:41] Pay in full for a game until it is in a box at a distributor.

[18:46] Have we all learned that lesson? I hope so.

[18:48] All right. Any other rumors or things I'm hearing?

[18:51] Here's the thing though. And this is like just something that I think everyone needs to be prepared for.

[18:55] We're on the verge of T.P.F. It's going to be exciting.

[18:58] There are a lot of pinball players out there.

[19:00] And there are a lot more pinball players out in the world that people are not even aware of.

[19:05] Now I know about three to four other pinball ventures out there that have games that they are looking to bring to market.

[19:12] And I have to say like, man, when is enough enough?

[19:17] And that is just a question I want all of you to think about.

[19:20] I think what is good about what's happening in the marketplace is people are no longer saying I just have to own the next.

[19:26] I just have to own the next. I think people are going to get a chance to play everything they want before they pay for it.

[19:32] And I think they're going to get a chance to only really own stuff that they fall in love with.

[19:38] And there's not going to be this just chasing after every new announcement.

[19:43] Right. We've come so far from the days when like Charlie's like on making Rob Zombie and it sells out the next day to actually maybe I should play Rob Zombie.

[19:52] Make sure I like it before I go in on it.

[19:55] All right. So that's where we're at.

[19:58] We're in a very inundated pinball marketplace.

[20:01] And you know, the prices are high.

[20:04] The new inbox market is very competitive.

[20:07] I think stuff like Houdini is what people are going to be looking for, which is you just have to give me a lot for my money.

[20:13] And you can't expect me to just like buy every new version of your game, Stern.

[20:20] You can't do that. You can't ship me a game that's incomplete.

[20:24] And you can't ask me to get excited about something that you haven't even taken the time to finish.

[20:29] And that's the reality.

[20:31] You know, Stern's thing is we need 50 games a day on the line or else we're out of business.

[20:35] Well, you're going to that means you're going to cut corners.

[20:37] Means you're going to you're going to rush stuff out the door.

[20:39] I think what we're starting to see with Stern and this year is really being defined by what John Trudeau did to them.

[20:46] This Stern was not well equipped to deal with the John Trudeau issue.

[20:50] And that caused a lot of things to be rushed.

[20:53] It caused a lot of delays.

[20:55] And you know, and we're feeling the effects of that.

[20:58] The reason why Guardians was bumped ahead of everything was because of Trudeau.

[21:02] So you can blame him for what happened with Guardians release.

[21:07] All right. Well, let's talk to Dave because we cover a lot of this stuff.

[21:10] I think you guys are going to enjoy this interview.

[21:12] Have a happy Friday. Have a great week in everybody.

[21:15] And if you have any feedback for the show, wait, I didn't read some of the people's emails.

[21:21] Let me do that real quick.

[21:23] So I got an email from, let's see from Don Es.

[21:27] Don Es, the subject is podcast still rocking and rolling.

[21:31] He said, Hey, Chris, long time listener here.

[21:33] I've emailed you in the past around episode 40 issues.

[21:37] So just wanted to say I still enjoy your podcast.

[21:40] It's still going strong. I've been saving up for the last year or so to buy a newer machine

[21:45] and finally scored a walking dead pro for 4,800 ship from a pin cider in Las Vegas.

[21:51] And it has $500 in mods.

[21:53] The game is fantastic.

[21:55] And the best part is it only had 400 plays when I got it.

[21:59] The hard part was convincing the wife that we needed it.

[22:02] But now that we've got it, she's playing it as much as me.

[22:05] Keep up the good show. Don, well, thank you so much for that note.

[22:08] I'm happy you scored a walking dead. It is a great machine.

[22:12] Only 400 plays.

[22:14] Only 400 plays probably after the latest code update.

[22:18] But if the game is giving you enjoyment and it's in great shape and you enjoy it, that's all that matters.

[22:23] I think, look, my Batman has hundreds of plays on it by now.

[22:27] You wouldn't know it. Games perfectly meant.

[22:29] If you take care of your games, if you wax them, if you put mylar and protectors down,

[22:34] these games will last and look new for a long time.

[22:37] I got an email from Warren.

[22:40] He said, hey, Chris, sorry you didn't invent the phrase loose lips syncs ships.

[22:44] Here's the opening song for your next podcast, ACDC.

[22:48] Let's get it up.

[22:50] First line of the song is loose lips syncs ships.

[22:53] Keep up the great work.

[22:55] As I always enjoy your podcast, my daughter asked me how much time I've spent listening to you.

[23:00] And I've figured out about six days of my life.

[23:04] I've listened to almost all your 207 shows.

[23:08] At like 45 minutes of show, she just laughed and rolled her eyes.

[23:13] Warren, I am sorry that I've taken a week of your life.

[23:17] But I hope that the entertainment that this show has provided has lowered any stress levels you may have

[23:25] and will probably add six years to your life.

[23:29] I should make that guarantee, can you just pinball podcast, the only pinball podcast that will add a year to your life

[23:36] because you will enjoy it so much.

[23:38] Warren, I really appreciate it.

[23:40] I think it's hard to explain to family members and other people out there why we listen to pinball podcasts and the enjoyment we get from it.

[23:48] But that's just the way it is.

[23:50] It's something we like.

[23:52] I got an email from Tim went and he said no need to read this on the air.

[23:57] But he wanted to follow up on our October fest discussion.

[24:01] All right, so look, I'm going to read it Tim.

[24:04] I've never read it before. He said so glad you're having fun with the big trouble versus October fest pole.

[24:08] But you miss my point.

[24:10] Here's my point.

[24:11] You can't write off a theme without thinking about the market segments that the theme appeals to.

[24:17] Companies that are not getting their ass kicked in the marketplace will present a mock up or MVP of the product to the representative sample of the product.

[24:26] If you're going to be a representative sample of the target market segment, then they valid pivot and throw out the idea.

[24:33] I wait, hold on.

[24:34] I'm going to stop there because you think Stern Tim does any of that?

[24:41] Do you think Stern shows a mock up of the product to like its distributors or its sales force or its customer base and does like focus group testing?

[24:50] They absolutely do not.

[24:51] They didn't do any of that with Mustang with WWE, ELE.

[24:55] Stern does none of that market sort of sampling to see if it's worth making.

[24:59] He said, I did enjoy the pole, but I hope that you would agree that posting a pole like, do you like vanilla or chocolate on pin-side is not market research?

[25:07] In my email, I felt that you sometimes rely too much on your gut instinct when talking themes.

[25:14] All right, let me stop there.

[25:16] So Tim, how is that not a valid pole of would you rather buy one or the other?

[25:22] Explain to me how we need it to change that up or word it differently.

[25:29] Because vanilla and chocolate is also a valid thing.

[25:34] If I'm only going to serve one flavor ice cream at my movie theater, which one has more customer base?

[25:42] So I don't get how that is like, you know, off and gut.

[25:47] Let me talk about gut for a minute a bit, for a little bit.

[25:50] Because I'll tell you this, I've built my career on data analytics, but overriding all of that are gut instincts.

[26:00] All right, my biggest campaigns in my life, Guns and Roses, Bonnie Tyler, you know, the whole like, everything we pushed for,

[26:10] free beer for all the Philadelphia, my team, you know, everything that we do is, it's all the numbers in the world wouldn't tell you that Dr. Pepper should align with Guns and Roses or that, you know, how do you, how do you get data research to show that people want to hear Bonnie Tyler sing that song during the total solar eclipse?

[26:26] You don't, you don't. I just knew people would love that. That it would make a great story.

[26:31] I know people would love big trouble in little China as a pinball experience far more than October fest.

[26:37] The only way to prove a gut and even data and analytics is to make both and see which sells more.

[26:44] I tell you this, big trouble in little China would wipe the floor with a October fest. It would destroy it.

[26:50] Nistalgia and the heritage movement is so much bigger in culture now than almost anything else.

[26:56] And you want to come out with October fest, just a generic game about the beer festival? Absolutely not.

[27:04] All right, he went on the set. All right, validate learning over opinions and conversations, the process of customer discovery in this part.

[27:13] All right, look, look, I want you to come on the show. All right, let's do that. Tim, I'm not going to read the rest of this email.

[27:19] I know you listen to the show. Tim, come on the show and let's talk about pinball marketing and have a good conversation.

[27:25] All right, I appreciate the note though. Tim's like a scholar in marketing. I'm sort of like an overachiever in marketing where I sort of I am for the fences and whenever brands execute my stuff.

[27:36] It usually pops because I think I go for the emotional versus like the data and the analytical stuff when it comes to marketing.

[27:44] Because what market research that George Lucas have to say that people want to see lightsabers, right? Exactly.

[27:50] All right, people, let me air this interview with Dave. I think you're going to enjoy it. Have a great weekend. Enjoy your pinball machines. Be nice to each other.

[27:58] And remember to email me, canada pinball at gmail.com to see the world reveal of the Hilton hoodie. I think you're going to love it. Have a great weekend.

[28:07] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome to canada's pinball podcast, a new guest to the show, a listener of the podcast.

[28:16] Mr. Dave Dave pronounced your last name for us. It's Fulgren Dave Fulgren from Plainfield Illinois.

[28:27] Plainfield Illinois, which is just just south of the capital. All right, Chicago. And Dave, Dave reached out to me Dave's a Dave's a big pinball fan.

[28:35] And what I really am so interested to hear from Dave is he's played a lot of the new machines that all I can do is speculate about.

[28:45] So Dave, you've played what a Houdini?

[28:48] Yeah, level 257, which is in Schomburg.

[28:52] They've got a Houdini there. They've had that that was the first prototype there. And there's also a Jersey Jack pirates is there as well.

[29:02] So yeah, it's it's it's kind of the testing ground. I'm very fortunate where Stern, American pinball and then Jersey Jack's design office are all about 15 minutes from there.

[29:18] And so this it's kind of their proving ground where they get to test stuff out. I was at 257 on a Friday and Josh was fixing the the Houdini.

[29:28] You know, it was like a Friday night at five o'clock after work and there's Josh. I was like, all right, hey, what's up? You know, so it's it's cool. All right, so you're lucky these brand new games, which most of us all we can do is speculate and yell at each other on forums.

[29:41] You actually get to play them before most people. So let's go down the list of what you've played. And I really would just love to get your impressions of these titles and how you think these titles will do in the pinball marketplace in 2018. How does that sound?

[29:56] Fire away. All right, let's start with American pinball Houdini. Like what are your thoughts on that game?

[30:03] That game is what they've done for that price point is it's a great game.

[30:13] I've been I got to play the prototype that was right after right after the Star Wars. The last debacle, the movie got to play played then that weekend.

[30:27] And we are the only ones there. I probably paid about played about 50 games. It was fantastic. I've I've the build quality on it is solid. It's kind of like a.

[30:38] I don't want to call it a Jersey Jack Jr. It's just it's it's solid build quality. It really it played nicely had a lot of fun with it.

[30:47] Had a lot of nice little Easter eggs that popped up. You know, there was an alien that pops up on it. A bunch of different little it's just it's a fun game to play.

[30:59] And I'll just kind of what we should do is just kind of go through each one and I can tell you that I was playing Houdini out of that lineup until Pirates showed up.

[31:12] Okay. So and yeah, so you've logged a bunch of games and so let me go down some of the stuff that people speculate on because you've spent time on the machine.

[31:22] So we've heard a lot of reports at the shots are tight. So what were your opinions about like finding the shots in the game?

[31:29] It shots are always tight when you've got to make them. It's kind of like you know, I've got this black night 2000 and that shot is you know it.

[31:42] It always seems like the shots are always tight when you've got to make them. I was making shots. I had fun playing it and it's driving me nuts that a couple guys that have played five games on it or saying the shots are tight. Well, no kidding.

[31:57] How I mean, you've got to play it for a while before you're really getting the feel for the flippers and who knows how that games even set up. I know the one at 257 set up right because Josh set it up.

[32:08] So I can tell you that game is set up correctly. So there was a little while there when they actually moved the game because I actually go there for happy hour on like Thursday nights will go and play.

[32:19] And there was a little while there where I was like, it wasn't shooting right it was missing the.

[32:26] It was missing the the trunk shot. You know that that that cannonball shot into the trunk. Right.

[32:32] Then they came back and then I saw Josh there again and then they had fixed it. So.

[32:37] But yeah, I booked probably 50 games on that on that pen and it's yeah, there's some tight stuff. But like I said, they're always tight when you try to make them. And I think people need to play it a little more before they can start talking about it.

[32:52] Fortunately with Houdini, it's out there a little bit more. So people are starting to get a little more time on it. Right.

[32:58] It is interesting how quickly right people formulating opinion about a pinball machine. I mean people will jump on a game once walk away after two balls and go on the internet and slam the machine.

[33:12] Yeah, I've got a standing rule and actually I came up with this and again, it's my being fortunate of having 257.

[33:22] We had dialed in last year after Rogue One Star Wars Rogue One came out. So that was like before Christmas.

[33:30] We had the prototype dialed in and people were just shedding all over that game. It's a it's a it's a it's a cell phone game and I actually bought into it.

[33:39] And I was I was with my buddies and they're kind of they're looser. You know they they just we just go and play.

[33:44] And they're like let's play this game. I'm like I didn't want I didn't want to play it. I was just so upset. I was just like oh it's it's it's it's a it's beneath me. It's a cell phone game.

[33:51] I played the after played that game. I played it for the rest of the night and we went back the next day and I played it again.

[33:56] Yeah.

[33:57] So it's just I don't declare anything about a game until you played it at least five times.

[34:03] Right.

[34:04] You know at least five times if not 25 times and then you can talk about it. I mean it's and it's so damaging the way that people are just talking about these games and they.

[34:13] Some people have only seen a video on there and they're making judgments. It's it's great.

[34:17] Right. Okay. So who Dini is the game and we've been saying on the show that I mean for the money when you look at everything that's in that game.

[34:25] You'd be hard pressed to find something because it's it's what seven thousand dollars.

[34:29] Yeah.

[34:30] Jam packed with stuff in it.

[34:32] Hold it.

[34:33] And I think more and more people are going to start playing and I know that the production is is still ramping up.

[34:38] So we're not seeing tons of them go out yet.

[34:41] But from what I've heard and when I've read the early customers are very satisfied with the machine.

[34:48] So let's go down the next list because I want to ask you after we go through them all the new ones like you know what what's what's at the top of your list.

[34:55] So you've played Pirates of the Caribbean another game that Jersey Jack questionably might have shown it pretty early showing it at expo.

[35:04] But now it's all location for testing and what are your thoughts on pirates.

[35:09] And just yeah.

[35:11] I played Houdini and pirates at expo.

[35:15] And compared to those were just I think they were just showing off the toys mainly pirates.

[35:22] I've had again about 50 games on it's what's crazy about two fifty seven is there's nobody there.

[35:30] I've got video I put up on Facebook I've literally my friend Bob and I we walked in and we play and like somebody will come up and I'll be like do you want to play this game and there's a Batman 66 that a lot of normal people want you know the people

[35:44] that don't really know want to play because it's cool and then 60 you know Batman 66 and there's goes there's a whole lineup is there.

[35:50] And people like oh no that's cool.

[35:52] You know they'll just watch or whatever but yeah I will play I can play for three hours straight on that pin and literally out of Thursday night at five.

[35:59] And there's nobody there I mean they have tournaments and things there but anyhow putting the time in on that game.

[36:06] I am a loose player I'm not a tournament player I'm not a I don't memorize rules I have the memory of a guppy basically I I I

[36:15] I laughed when Brenda was interviewing you because she said something that kind of stuck with me with my whole goal is to keep the ball from getting into the drain.

[36:22] I mean that's really what I try to do it first and then I get into the rule sets and everything.

[36:27] With a game like Star Wars where it was you know the rules that gets really if you don't understand you really got to read up on that game to really enjoy it I'm starting to join that one but.

[36:37] With pirates I had fun with it from the first poll.

[36:41] Explain it so it's really intuitive when you when you when you get up there it kind of just pulls you in and it's not like doing complicated math or chess like star wars there's plenty to do there's plenty to do without knowing what you're doing okay.

[36:55] You know you do the shot it goes up there's that upper flipper it took me a couple games to figure out okay if I hit that upper flipper there's a nice loop shot that you can really get going up there kind of a.

[37:09] Richie style loop shot that'll really you know you can kind of get going with that upper flipper.

[37:14] But I just I had fun in my friend Bob who is a loose Larry collects he's got a couple games he had fun and then I had my other friend who literally I think you may have played 20 games of pinball his entire life.

[37:27] He had so basically everybody's having fun playing this game it's not overly complicated but then you start learning more about it I've been watching the videos and learning more about.

[37:35] You know the gameplay of it and okay now I'm starting to get more so now I can.

[37:39] I'm stepping it up a little bit more and getting the scores and finding things out but before I even knew what the heck I was doing I was having fun with it and I think that's.

[37:47] Something you know I know when I first saw it at at expo we're kind of like pirates game right great what a waste and then you know everybody is is kind of poo poo in it and that I really.

[38:02] I wouldn't look at is just a pirates of the Caribbean game it's a pirate game that happens to be based around pirates of Caribbean.

[38:09] I kind of needs to be because I can use it.

[38:12] Well yeah but there you know what it's it's it's it's got the one you know it's got the one guy the narrator is cool I like the narrator games like walking dead I can't stand that narrator he drives me nuts.

[38:25] Guardians of the galaxy the voices call out on that make me crazy at least this narrator he's a real you know he's he was one of the actors from the movie so at least he.

[38:35] Thits right and he doesn't sound like somebody who's trying to be a pirate he sounds like a pirate right which is it's it's just I had fun and if you I've got videos me playing you cannot say not say R while you're playing it I mean it just pulls you in and you have a blast and if you get up into that upper playfield and you're playing on the boat.

[38:52] It's a fun game that I would I would consider um you know and I don't I don't want to jump ahead too far as far as if you want to talk about ratings later on but.

[39:04] So okay so well these are the two new ones now because I think out of I mean we can talk about.

[39:11] Guardian got you there's really the three I mean the three you've got your stern games and you know we can everybody's everybody's played them and everybody's talked about and we can talk about as well if you want let's go basically that TNA you've got.

[39:24] Let's go to TNA first because I think before we go to stern I think the three new games that I'm hearing the most buzz about amongst players you got pirates you got Houdini you got total nuclear annihilation now have you had some time on TNA as well.

[39:41] Not as much as I got on the other two because it's not at 257 I got to play it at the pinball life open house during expo and I got a few rounds in at expo but what I did I probably played about 10 fifth I played more than five I probably played 10 to 15 games at pinball life they had the original white wood then he had the prototype then he had the production game so I played a few on each one but I played a few more on the production than on any other ones and.

[40:09] That game is it's special I mean it's it's not it's it's it's it's it's it's not for the faint of heart you go to play that game and it's it's one of those games that you don't ever take your hand you don't get to take a breath it'll catch you looking you're playing it's just it's fast and I can only really describe it as bouncing it's just always moving my buddy Bob is he's a bigger guy and he was just like he was literally sweating.

[40:39] I mean we kind of kids sometimes Bob will sweat when he gets a haircut but he was I mean it's it's intense it's not a game you just kind of walk up to when you're hanging out you get on that thing it's like you're you're in and you better pay attention because it will it'll bite you if you don't it'll catch you looking and it's it's compared to like a pirate because we know that 10 a is like fast and furious does does it make some of those other games feel a little bit like things are happening in slow motion.

[41:09] Um it's yeah well that that game is just the TNA makes everything seem like it's going it makes you feel like you're going in slow motion when you walk away from it it is just so it's fast it is off it's bouncy I mean I can't even just it that ball just never stops moving I mean there's no there's just no relaxing when you're playing that game with pirates and what it was he's what I wanted to mention I don't like wide body games I really don't like what I'm going to do is I'm going to do it.

[41:39] The only the only Jersey Jack game I really like it was dialed in and you know I'm playing pirates and I finally I realize oh my god this is a wide body game it doesn't feel like a wide body.

[41:51] So out of the three wide body jacks it's the fastest one from I think that has what do you think why do you think that is or the shots just closer to the flippers all Indiana Jones.

[42:04] It's just got so much going on I think it's just I think air must have done a lot of work with the whitewood on it and he you know he plays a lot of competitive stuff I've heard some of his interviews and you know he's he's got pinball in his blood he's been doing it for a long time and say with Denise I mean Scott I go to pinball life a lot and talk to Scott and really I mean him and I would geek out about different pinball machines all the time I mean I just go there and ask him questions about some lights and stuff before he was ever going to do it.

[42:33] Before he was ever doing TNA and it's just he's got it in his blood I mean those two just love pinball and they've got their thoughts but compared to Hobbit and in and Wizard of Oz right it doesn't it just does not feel you don't realize it's a wide body until there's a far left shot you've got to make.

[42:53] And you don't realize it's a wide body to you got to make that shot because it that also like holy cow but you don't have that slow lumbering wide body feel like you do with Hobbit where it's like pop okay right okay all right so Dave do you think do you think pirates is going to be more successful get more appraise and dial then dialed in is sort of it's like a fan favorite but I you know I can't imagine it's like flying out the door.

[43:22] Just because of the theme I'm curious if you think like is do you think this is the best Jersey Jack or you think dialed in is still a better pinball experience I don't think you can compare the two.

[43:33] I think they're both they compliment each other I think they do I think I think that I mean look at look at dialed in dialed in is a is in a wide body it doesn't have that button in the middle that that lock down button that I'm not a big fan of but dialed in is dialed in is not a big fan of the

[43:52] Williams game that's what dialed in is and when I played dialed in the first time I looked at looked at Bob and I said this is the first that was the first pinball new pinball machine I had played that I was like holy cow I love this is this feels like a Williams

[44:09] Stern to me before that I'd always said Stern was like sex with a condom it just felt like you're wearing mittens it didn't have feel you just didn't feel right and then I got on that dialed in and I was like holy cow welcome back it was like

[44:21] that was the first dialed in was the first pinball machine I played that I said I would I might I might buy this you know I would think about buying this this excites me when I see that game I go for at expo I played I played pirates for a little bit and literally walked away and just started playing dialed in because I just I wanted to get as much free time as I could on dialed in because it's dialed in is a totally different game then then then pirates but I think if you're a pinball enthusiast in and you would get

[44:51] dialed in I think if you're a guy like me with three kids and you're gonna have Christmas and you got your friends coming over pirates is just it's just such a fun game it's a lot of fun where dialed in is it's that theme it's that cell phone theme and people still don't get it

[45:11] and it's not sounds with the boom boom boom it's not as it's not as exciting as pirates because pirates has I mean I know people are begging on the on the theme music

[45:21] but the theme music is still awesome it may not be from the movie it doesn't need to be it's good I mean you got Dave Field did that I mean that guy's I've got I've got

[45:30] a time machine over here that's one of his first ones that he did on data east and that game is spectacular and that's from you know

[45:36] that's one of the original data east his music is fantastic so you know people are begging on that whole soundtrack thing it doesn't

[45:43] need it to sound the music if the music is good you don't need the soundtrack music if it's good then I mean that's

[45:49] yeah I mean look I mean the pirates the Caribbean movies right I mean they they they've sort of they

[45:55] were they started out really popular the first few installments but I don't I mean that theme song

[46:01] I've heard David's music and it's close right but like if you if you altered the Star Wars theme song people

[46:08] would burn stern pinball to the ground I'm totally different worlds totally different worlds there

[46:14] there's like iconic people know note for note the theme song I don't think the pirates movies has the

[46:20] same level like emotional draw that some of the other films scores have and like you were saying

[46:27] I mean if people are coming over people already understand the world of pirates just just as a general

[46:34] thing versus dialed in in quantum city which does take explaining and even when you do it's not

[46:42] going to have the same level of immediate attraction as a pirate theme game so so Jersey jacks on a

[46:49] little bit of a role now right I think they've sort of found their groove I definitely think dialed in

[46:55] as Jack says is the game you always want to make and I think people are excited to see what comes

[47:00] down the road now we've heard rumors of toy story we've heard rumors of Willie Wonka do any of

[47:08] those two themes excite you would they give you pause David if if you knew those were coming

[47:15] after pirates I'm not a Jersey I mean I don't buy I'm not a new new unboxed buyer to for the most

[47:24] part I just at this point I've got three children it would be irresponsible for me to start

[47:29] buying $12,000 from the game responsible pinball I could do that believe me I own my own business

[47:35] I'm doing well but I I mean I just it just wouldn't honestly I've spent two pinball machines so I

[47:48] you know I bought them I fixed them I've sold them it's fun for me I just so I'm just going to get

[47:53] that out of the way I would I would buy I would my pirates though and I've actually had long talks

[48:02] with Bob who's my kind of my pinball buddy here and I work with him and I've thought about I mean I

[48:10] can't get the $257 enough to play and I really do enjoy that game and I really did enjoy

[48:15] dialed in in fact if pirates were down right now I would probably either play Houdini or dialed in

[48:20] but I would say I would buy pirates I would sell my wizard of Oz on my hobbit if I had it right now

[48:27] right I mean I wouldn't even I wouldn't pass go I I think if they are doing I mean that toy story if

[48:34] if if if if if wallers doing whatever wallers doing that is gonna be awesome um it's probably not

[48:39] gonna be wide body but with the pirates the pirates just didn't it doesn't feel like I hate wide

[48:46] bodies I had a judge dread here in a fish tails and uh I judge shows my first DMD game I had and I

[48:51] loved it I loved it I loved it then I got a fish tails and I was like it was this you know it was

[48:56] that lumbering wide body oh so slow that pirates you could I will jump back and forth from Houdini to

[49:02] pirates to dialed in and it doesn't feel slow it's just so busy he's got I think it might be

[49:08] those wheel the the spinners he's got up in front of the flippers too you don't get to rest as much

[49:14] you're not waiting right you're watching that ball that ball is that ball is always doing things

[49:19] where you're not watching it's it's it's it's it's moving and flying yeah it's not

[49:24] lumbering down from the top like hobbit or you know where's your vowswards doing this thing

[49:28] oh yeah hobbit you can go like order drink at the bar but you know by the time the ball comes

[49:34] back from that center ramp I mean it's it's yes it's forever a day all right so okay so Jersey

[49:41] Jack it sounds like pirates and I keep hearing good things I mean I I am I have speculated on whether

[49:47] or not the theme will be one that people are attracted to you're telling me you know Chris doesn't

[49:52] matter game is really good it's an amazing pirate game that just happens to be inspired and based

[49:58] on pirates of the Caribbean it's totally wrapped around it though I mean you listen to Eric's

[50:02] interviews and he's you know I mean the different skulls and all the different stuff so I don't

[50:06] want to discredit that but I saw the first pirates and I think I saw the second pirates in a

[50:11] drive and I think I fell asleep watching it so I can tell you Jack's barrel is I know there's you

[50:16] know the squid head guy I don't really know who anybody else is but Jack's so I mean and that's

[50:20] because it's Johnny Daphne walks around you know acting like you know Keith Richards so that's great

[50:27] it's it's it's it's just a fun game and for it and I'm not a big fan of of licensed games either

[50:36] and really it's it's the license didn't seem to get too far in the way on that game I think I

[50:41] guess I could say like you would on on a Star Wars or on half the other basically all the license

[50:48] pins I've I know we've come across lately and and we can get into that if you've got three hours

[50:53] to talk about how much I dislike licensed pins but um well I think what yeah what it will help them

[50:59] what will help them is that pirates isn't a sort of you know five-part movie franchise that

[51:08] people are overly obsessed with what where they would complain because the integration isn't exactly

[51:15] what they imagine I think that is actually going to work in Jersey Jack's favor that the the pirate

[51:21] theme is something people like but they're not going to be super pissed off that like that scene

[51:26] from movie four isn't in there because right who the hell remembers any of that stuff um so have

[51:33] you played any of the new stern machines and we've got guardians we've got Batman 66 we've got

[51:38] um what do we got Error Smith we've got all they're all there what do you all there man what do

[51:47] your thoughts on Star Wars what are your thoughts and stuff you know I I I I was planning I was

[51:56] looking at selling a few of my system 11 games to get a Star Wars kind of bought in on the reviews

[52:04] I played it at Expo um I'm starting to let the more I play it over there the more the thing the

[52:10] thing about Star Wars is it's in the 257 has like a lineup where it's it's like Houdini um

[52:20] Error Smith Star Wars Guardians and uh uh pirates so sometimes I'll let somebody else play you

[52:28] know somebody else comes up I'll let him because I'll be playing pirates for like an hour and

[52:31] somebody also come up and I'll be like if you want to play go ahead so then I'll jump on

[52:35] Star Wars usually and uh it's starting to grow on me they've got a pro there and I the problem I

[52:41] have with Star Wars I've got a friend that's got an LE at his house and I won't play it because I

[52:46] throw that game around um it's light and it's it's it's definitely enough you know it's it's

[52:51] more than a nudge I I tilt that game a lot and it's it's really light it's fun to play um it's

[52:57] starting to grow on me a lot and um I'm a huge Steve Richie fan I black nights what got me in and

[53:03] black night two thousand what got me back and I've got a lot of Steve Richie games in my collection

[53:08] and um those are the ones I really don't let go of so I like his I'm a big fantasy I've got a

[53:13] signed picture of Steve Richie back there uh dressed up as a king from uh from uh Expo um so

[53:20] I'm a big fan of his I like that game the more I play it the more I like it

[53:25] okay so it's grown on you of of the stern um of the affordable of the pro

[53:31] sterns I would buy Star Wars because also and I know you've made this point with uh with Batman

[53:39] it's the real it's the real voices it's the real people it's it's Star Wars I mean right you turn

[53:45] it on and it's it's the theme song comes on and it's Yoda's voice and it's so I've got a lot of

[53:51] Star Wars stuff in this basement um that I'm sitting in right now and uh I was actually married on

[53:57] on May the 4th and uh you know that was my wife's idea but we are big Star Wars fans at this house

[54:03] so Star Wars was one of those that I was ready to jump all over then I pulled back a little bit

[54:08] and it's something that I'd still think about of the new sterns of the new pro sterns it's

[54:13] probably the one I would buy but on some level I still do consider Star Wars to be a bit

[54:20] of a failure and I'll explain why Dave because like you're a huge Star Wars fan dude I mean I don't

[54:26] know if you can see over my shoulder that is a thousand that is a that is one of 1000 general giant

[54:32] one to one Yoda um that's like you go to like that's yeah I'm a I'm a fairly you mean you're married

[54:40] on May 4th yeah they might step to the stuff stop a stormtroopers so you're married on May 4th

[54:45] you've got this amazing Yoda statue you yeah you have a framed picture of Steve Richie or a

[54:52] signed picture he made Star Wars and you didn't get one yeah that just to me that says like

[55:00] something it's like you have to grow to love the machine and I'll say that is why I think Star Wars

[55:05] as a pinball machine sort of failed because we shouldn't have to grow to love it it should have been

[55:12] immediately take my money now kind of machine and it wasn't the okay but you've got to keep in

[55:18] mind too that that had more to do with Lucas and just the whole light and you've got and you're

[55:25] in marketing so you know um Star Wars is the Tiffany Star Wars is like the most protected brand

[55:34] on the planet um I had a marketing my my my my marketing guy that I used to have he was the

[55:39] president of planners peanuts marketing the the planners peanut is like the most one of the most

[55:44] you know that he couldn't be walking you couldn't be talking and in fact when the new commercials

[55:48] came out he was going crazy that's how I know about all this but that Star Wars franchise

[55:53] they were so I don't think Steve Richie had as much design to do with it as Lucas did

[55:58] and it comes through I mean it's it's if you look at what Steve's done in the last few games

[56:04] he hasn't had it just doesn't seem like he's had much control um over you know I mean he's got his

[56:11] touches here and there but you can just tell and you've even said it before where's the fricking top

[56:15] her man well I don't know what happened there I mean you know I don't know what Stern submitted I

[56:21] don't know what's going on with that it's become a kind of like a running joke it's supposed to be

[56:26] R2D2 with his um oh I know it's supposed to be like R2D2 with some hologram and all it's supposed to

[56:32] be like the bat it's supposed to be awesome but they haven't released but there's also no way that

[56:37] that like a tie fighter on a spring is something that Lucas like design and it's also just I think

[56:44] what happened is this I think the license was so expensive yes it was also very restrictive in terms

[56:50] of you know the needing to get approval on every little thing they did so I think they like you know

[56:58] they played some areas really safe like a tie fighter on a spring and that LCD screen with the

[57:04] targets like to me that stuff just didn't seem very inventive for the franchise and you know we

[57:10] we beat this into the ground like a dead horse I think sure since then I think people have learned

[57:16] to enjoy the pin but I I don't think Star Wars will ever go down as as one of the you know best

[57:24] Stern pinball machines but what's there's this is the third Star Wars pin now yeah they're

[57:29] fourth through four the Joker they suck because Lucas won't let him you know what I mean it's just

[57:34] like you've always got the overlings I it's just I and then you're always paying a ton for that

[57:40] that license I mean I was listening to uh uh the Australian guys and and and Charlie was on there

[57:47] you know he was talking about how he couldn't do that one machine because all the sudden they wanted

[57:50] all this money for this one thing imagine what Stern paid for Yoda and video but why but why

[57:57] when you go look at the Zen pinball which is I know it's digital but when you look at the Zen pinball

[58:04] Star Wars games they're freaking amazing just who had to pay for that Zen pinball what did they pay

[58:11] who they they paid Lucas but yeah okay so Zen paid pinball did that but Zen pinball it's that's

[58:17] like building away well I guess there's no expense there's no be out there's there's no

[58:21] bill material in that but even just on an artistic standpoint you look at the art on the Zen pinball

[58:25] games like they blow away the art on the Stern game and it's like but did Lucas have their hands

[58:31] you know where they were they were they elbow deep into into that into that game

[58:36] did they have little we'll never know right because I I don't know I know they did I know they did

[58:41] I know they did on on the Stern game yeah of course but the you know the hard part about dealing

[58:47] with the license is you never know what the pinball manufacturer takes to the license and you never

[58:53] know exactly what the license gave them to work with like we just have to kind of accept what we're

[58:58] told from the pinball company which when things go well there's never any questions about how that

[59:05] partnership work when things don't go well it's always the the license was to blame you know the

[59:11] IP holder was to blame anyway so Star Wars that's it almost feels like that was like years ago

[59:16] doesn't it it's like yeah that was like this game Guardians of the Galaxy has come out recently

[59:22] that there's not much there's not much conversation about it do you do you feel like this game is sort

[59:29] of it just feels like this game just came out and just immediately got sort of it was like

[59:34] grotel yeah it's it's it's you were and I remember you were talking it up and uh you know it's kind

[59:41] of like uh you know Star Wars we're not liking Star Wars and yeah the Star Wars on the original

[59:45] on the on the looking at it that's was really the downside of it but Guardians is is going to be

[59:52] incredible and we're gonna see how it looks and you know wait wait wait wait and then yeah I've

[59:57] played it a few times and really it's I can't stand the callouts and I I I really read my

[01:00:05] thing on it's not even the it would be different if it was him if it was the actor doing the

[01:00:10] boobley boo it's a bad actor doing the that Stern if I wouldn't mind if they didn't use the actual

[01:00:16] actors but I don't and I'm sure I'm gonna be in Texas and I'm if the voice actor from Guardians

[01:00:22] comes up and slugs me god bless him I hate what he's doing I don't like any of the voices and for

[01:00:28] me callouts are key um it makes or breaks the game and that's why like walking dead I can't stand

[01:00:35] that fake southern accent that that guy has um it makes me nuts you know he's it's like he's he's

[01:00:42] not Rick he just sounds kind of like Rick but it's not him it's like why couldn't they have found

[01:00:47] actually the same guy that does the boobley boo and that guy's I can't believe they couldn't get him

[01:00:52] to narrate right uh uh uh uh uh uh uh Darrell's brother whoever that guy and could Merle because Merle

[01:00:58] was he that's the boobley boo guy and Guardians of Galaxie too and he's not like he's he's like a

[01:01:04] bee list actor I mean he's talented don't get me wrong but the guy you'll I mean he'd do a commercial

[01:01:09] for you know whatever right now so I'm sure his voice over work wouldn't be that expensive they

[01:01:15] could have used him right so narrate the whole damn game it really feels like on some level

[01:01:22] guardians got rushed and I was reading on this week in Pimball they said there's a rumor that

[01:01:28] the design cycle over at Stern was Iron Maiden Deadpool and then Guardians in terms of when these

[01:01:36] games design cycles began and and and Iron Maiden uh got delayed and and there's uh people are not

[01:01:44] sure which titles Trito worked on it whether it was Deadpool or Iron Maiden but it definitely feels

[01:01:49] like Guardians was a bit rushed I mean we when it came out the code was another one of these

[01:01:54] hardly existent codes um what do you think it was like an expo code it was just like like why does Stern

[01:02:05] think they can get away with with with this sort of let's launch a game that's not done and let's let

[01:02:12] the early adopters be the guinea pigs do you think like we're getting to the point where

[01:02:17] people are finally gonna say enough enough or are there just enough casual buyers who just don't

[01:02:22] even understand what code is I think in the past two years um buyers have gotten a lot smarter

[01:02:31] everybody wants to test drive now and it's showing I think in the delivery numbers um but you got

[01:02:37] to realize I mean think about okay you're Gary Stern you've got I don't know how big that

[01:02:42] facility is but he's in Cook County Illinois which is the highest tax uh county in the United

[01:02:50] States I know because I I my businesses there as well um so you've got an army of people I don't

[01:02:58] know how many people he's that he employs it's got a hundred I think four hundred people okay and I

[01:03:04] say this whenever I send you the notes 50 pinballs a day or the lights go off 50 games a day or

[01:03:12] the lights go off period he's got to do that and they've got to be profitable so you've got the

[01:03:17] whole true dough thing which was a friggin night I mean could you imagine I mean you're you're you're

[01:03:22] you know you're this business owner you've got four hundred people whose families are depending on

[01:03:25] you um plus you know you've got your ego you've got to keep that going so you've got to put something

[01:03:31] out it's done the artworks done the mechanicals are done the codes kind of done let's get it out

[01:03:39] and of course I think and it's changing drastically now um and you're seeing it more with the

[01:03:46] with the uh smaller boutique guys like spooky in American where people aren't they want it they

[01:03:51] want to smell the cork before they you know before they're buying it um but people will buy I mean

[01:03:56] a year ago it goes busters good good lord that thing was sold out before it was even announced

[01:04:03] as was Batman you know as was Batman as was guard game of thrones I mean it was it was a different

[01:04:09] time where because there were so few pinballs out there so now all the sudden guys looking at his

[01:04:14] his row in his basement and it's like well I've got sixteen pins and I don't like three of them

[01:04:20] but I bought them right away because I wanted to impress my pinball friends that only come by once

[01:04:24] every three months that my wife doesn't like um so you know maybe I should make sure I like this one

[01:04:30] and maybe my wife and my kids enjoy it as well um so they're gonna hang on a little bit but he's

[01:04:35] got to put out 50 a day he has to I mean that's it's so he had to do it and it's a terrible it's

[01:04:42] too bad that it happened but uh you know hey guess what guys you bought them um I wouldn't I

[01:04:48] I still I cannot believe that people are buying anything without testing I mean that I'm sorry

[01:04:55] I mean that lamp that you had in your house for a year god bless you I don't know how you could have

[01:04:59] done that that was insane dropping that kind of money on magic yeah magic lamp yeah you know I

[01:05:06] mean hey man it's a cool looking game and everything but I got all sorts of cool looking stuff

[01:05:11] all like I mean yeah well well it's like this it's like with magic girl same thing happened with

[01:05:17] like Batman it's like you have the fear missing out is the only thing driving people to be idiotic

[01:05:24] with their money when it comes to the scenarios and the thing is Batman is the one that I would say

[01:05:30] because because guardians you could say okay you know the Trudeau thing they got screwed and

[01:05:35] and they basically was like hit the red button shit what are we gonna do we can't put this thing out

[01:05:40] with this frickin you know we gotta do something quick okay but Batman was pre like a pre-meditated

[01:05:47] you know that was pre-meditated he knew he was putting that out for the anniversary that was his

[01:05:52] big deal and he I mean you couldn't he knew he knew he also knew like Lyman barely started to code

[01:06:01] yeah you know it was he knew Adam West was gonna be at expose you know it was it was a cake with no

[01:06:09] no inside it was a cake with no cake it wasn't even frosting it was like there's a bag of flower

[01:06:15] in some eggs and and you got your own you better have your own water now it was a nice one because

[01:06:21] it was a beautiful looking box though Batman's interesting because I people you know some other

[01:06:26] podcasts out there make fun of me for my flip flop on Batman and I did flip flop on Batman I don't

[01:06:32] I don't deny it I thought Batman was the biggest pile of shit for a year and now I think it's

[01:06:39] one of Stern's best pens because of Lyman sheets and if you play it I played the heck out of it

[01:06:46] it's got I mean Lyman is just he knows how to make a game sing better than anybody out there in the

[01:06:54] coding world and it's funny that that's that's that's how far it's really it's it's gotten to the

[01:07:02] code I mean it's really so code based it's not you know which which yeah it's it's I I gotta tell

[01:07:12] you I'm not a huge fan of it man 66 I know I want to hear because I do agree on the other two I

[01:07:18] do agree that Batman 66 code makes up for a lack of sort of magic in terms of what's happening on

[01:07:29] the playfield I but the playfields beautiful and to look at that like my time I can look at that

[01:07:34] and it makes me happy and I look at Batman and it makes you happy and like you said it pulls you

[01:07:39] back to when you're a kid and your mom called in sick and you got to sit on the couch and you got

[01:07:43] to watch Batman you're about you're you're you're in your you're roughly in your 40s about so

[01:07:47] you're I think we're about the same age group I think um but you know basically I was like mom

[01:07:52] called in sick you get to watch that courtship of Eddie's father well price is right you know you

[01:07:57] got to sit and watch TV and that Batman was like part of the cool or in the summer you'd watch it

[01:08:01] but it brings you back to that and it is true Batman there's no bullshit like you said it's Adam

[01:08:05] West doing call outs it's Kapau and and Caesar Romero and it's it is beautiful the play on it I

[01:08:12] is not you know when you get into the play it's it's you know for me it's it's okay it's clunky I

[01:08:19] mean I like I think I've been very you know I've been very honest I know where if you go back

[01:08:25] across all of my podcasts have I ever said that Batman has great flow it doesn't it's clunky

[01:08:33] it's got some the that rotating mechanism is a ticking time bomb if you if you ask me I think

[01:08:40] there's a lot of things like just I would hate for one little thing to go wrong on that and good

[01:08:44] luck like trying to to to keep the game functioning right now everything is working great and I

[01:08:51] agree like the artwork that Franchie put on that game is phenomenal the SLE way overpriced

[01:08:57] but I have one pin it's pretty the metallic shiny foiley decals are amazing if I'm going to put

[01:09:05] one pinball machine in my apartment that casual people can jump on and enjoy but also has depth

[01:09:13] that keeps you wanting to go back and play it and play it and play it I don't think there's many

[01:09:19] other pins that would be in that would fill that criteria right now in in the pinball world I had

[01:09:27] the other one Lord the rings was a great pinball machine that did that I had tails of the

[01:09:33] Arabian nights which looked beautiful you finally sold that didn't you I sold it it just didn't

[01:09:39] have the depth if you only have one pen right yeah yeah yeah but you did you did finally get rid of

[01:09:43] that one because I know you're selling I did I sold it for um 95 hundred which I think there's

[01:09:50] a fair price I had a lot of money in that game yeah and it's it was tight and then that's the thing

[01:09:55] I mean that's it's it's to get a game like that that's tight yeah and people don't they forget Dave

[01:10:01] like that the brass coin doors five hundred bucks alone everybody forget everybody when they

[01:10:06] want to buy a game forgets what things are worth until they want to sell it I mean I have a

[01:10:10] thousand dollars in mods and Batman alone easily I know I watched I I saw your I've seen your posts it's

[01:10:19] you it adds up you know real quick two hundred dollars here you know and you're not doing that's

[01:10:24] and plus I mean did you have to pay for did you did you have to pay for that helper or did was he

[01:10:28] doing that stuff for free when he was putting them in so luckily when I was doing for Batman I

[01:10:35] I did the play field protector which was the biggest sort of time yeah assuming thing I really

[01:10:41] wish Stern would offer that from the factory you know knowing that their play fields are prone to

[01:10:46] dimpling they would save themselves a lot of headache by just making it in option and but Chris

[01:10:54] from coin taker and I we spent an entire day like maybe six hours or more with Chris from coin

[01:11:00] taker who knows what he knows what he's doing and he has I don't have so I'll say this I'll say this

[01:11:06] putting a play field protector in is not for the meek it is not easy it is not something I would

[01:11:14] ever want to do on my own without a pinball tech next to me yeah pinball tech yeah yeah because

[01:11:21] you're gonna fuck something up you're gonna fuck oh you're gonna yeah and you're not just gonna

[01:11:24] fuck something you're gonna fuck it would be like you trying to put in like a new hood scoop on

[01:11:30] your on your demon I mean it's like there was a point I remember there's a point specifically

[01:11:38] when when we had to raise the ramps up you know there's that metal flap in front of each of the

[01:11:44] catwoman ramps and we had to raise up the ramp to get the play field protector to be just

[01:11:49] underneath that and man one of the ramps just wouldn't wouldn't freaking budge I mean he's got to

[01:11:55] get a hammer out there and like mallet it up and it's just like it's plastic I'm like great

[01:12:02] you know and also like when you when you tear down a play field this is the other thing that

[01:12:07] the reason why it takes so long is you have to take pictures you have the label stuff you have to

[01:12:12] put stuff together and even when you do all that you finish the job and there's like a few screws

[01:12:20] on the table and you're like shit yeah where do those go pictures videos and and that's the thing

[01:12:28] and that that game it's not like you can just find somebody across town that has that you know it's

[01:12:32] you know it saved us multiple times throughout the day so we're putting we're putting the play field

[01:12:37] back together and we reached points were like which way did that he had another Batman 66 because

[01:12:45] he's Chris from coin taker and he has a whole lineup of every new star and so we were able to walk

[01:12:49] 10 feet over and look at how it should be all right so you were doing it at his place you were

[01:12:55] doing it at your place yeah so so I wisely decided when I bought that man 66 to drive to him

[01:13:02] with all the parts and all the mods and do it there and then have fast Eddie my delivery guy

[01:13:10] pick up the game from coin taker a few weeks later and bring it to me and I didn't even I didn't

[01:13:14] even drive home with the game yeah I left it yeah because I don't even I don't know how many things

[01:13:21] to drive home and anyhow exactly what what do you mean to like like tie rope around it and like

[01:13:27] yeah what do you get a are you gonna rent a you got to rent one of those pickups from I don't

[01:13:29] know if you guys have like home depots are up there but you can like rent a pickup for 25 bucks for

[01:13:33] like an hour I'd love to see that Batman you know I sell it on the back and I've seen I've seen

[01:13:38] some pretty actually I've sold some pinballs to guys that show up and like you're putting I had a

[01:13:44] guy by a Frankenstein from me it was like three grand and he pulled up in this truck and I was like

[01:13:48] this is in bomb machines work more than your truck what are you doing what are you doing with

[01:13:51] your life my cuz this list I'm like you're just using this pickup no it's my daily I'm like dude

[01:13:58] you see a lot Dave on on Pinside I mean when guys have to go have a surgery to save their life

[01:14:04] and they need to sell a pinball machine to pay for it do you think a lot of people in this hobby

[01:14:09] just go too far and it becomes too much of a priority for them to own these machines when other

[01:14:15] areas of their life are not appropriately invested in or they don't have the right savings and yet

[01:14:24] pinball becomes all they care about there's definitely an addiction side of it um I think some guys

[01:14:32] go a little overboard but the other nice the comforting thing about pinball and you shouldn't

[01:14:39] look at it this way but for me you know I I don't have any you know I don't have a Dodge demon I

[01:14:46] don't have you know my cars are I drive a Volvo I've got a Chevy Avalanche truck my wife drives a

[01:14:51] Honda Odyssey um you know these are kind of my these are my fun for me I'm I've got a much

[01:14:58] healthier attitude some guys yeah but I think a lot of guys have these pins and they have in the

[01:15:02] back their head hey I could sell this pin now how long did it take you to sell that that that

[01:15:07] that totem it took um it took a while then you thought yeah well longer than I thought partly

[01:15:14] because I was banned from I'm banned so I really couldn't list it on Pinside I'll say this though

[01:15:22] for totem from I mean magic old is the one I was most concerned about selling I'm like who the

[01:15:28] who's gonna want to buy magic girl I don't know um luckily for me and I I thank my my lucky

[01:15:35] stars my guardian angel I was able to sell it before deep root surface and Seth are going to make

[01:15:41] more magic girls my poor friend Robert who's trying to sell his magic girl right now if you go on

[01:15:47] Pinside on on eBay he's got his list of for 225 and it's like I don't know how you even like

[01:15:55] attract a single buyer now with deep root and and their efforts hanging over a magic girl because

[01:16:04] if you buy it second hand you don't get any of the deep root sort of a claim to get one of theirs

[01:16:10] so you're gonna get stuck so all right and I so deep root I do are you ready shift gears

[01:16:20] into this hole okay so deeper deep root they're they're they're they're they're gonna do a magic girl

[01:16:26] and it's gonna be something similar to what they've got um they've got the art is gonna be the same

[01:16:33] art or is it gonna be different what what exact where are they at now because I've I don't

[01:16:37] they've reached a recent agreement with with Jeremy Packer a zombie Eddie so it will most likely be

[01:16:45] his art package there may have to be some changes to the artwork if they do play field changes

[01:16:52] because the stuff has to sync up but that all can be done that has to be a functioning pinball machine

[01:16:59] yeah I think I think they're probably tackling it from the engineering standpoint first the art

[01:17:06] should be the last thing that gets dropped down on the game sure yeah so I look I mean deep root I

[01:17:13] mean I've I've gone back and forth and I've sort of settled in the middle now of I'm curious to

[01:17:20] see what comes of the effort I've always said I think out of all the new pinball ventures from a

[01:17:28] marketing standpoint John Papaduke is the only one who really understood the the real white space

[01:17:34] in the hobby is small boutique games that cater to the rich will sell if you execute properly

[01:17:46] nobody's executed it properly here's here's what you got day without even a game

[01:17:53] he's let list I I worked for a company that went bankrupt and left companies hanging with like

[01:18:01] tens of millions of dollars and I have no idea how my old boss even sleeps at night so I don't

[01:18:06] know how he sleeps at night there however he does it that's yeah I just I don't understand how people

[01:18:13] can do just how you can if I'm laid on my on my on my you know I'll get a call from like my

[01:18:19] from from direct TV because my credit card had changed over and I freak out you know like hey

[01:18:25] you your payment didn't go through what you know so I don't even understand how somebody can walk

[01:18:28] around knowing people thousands hundreds of whatever he owes but what what what what what I don't

[01:18:38] what I'm what what I don't get is is how they're gonna do it how are they gonna pull it off

[01:18:44] well like I mean that's the big question mark right and and you know sort of instead of

[01:18:50] I've again I've like sort of taken a new approach instead of just saying they're not gonna do it

[01:18:55] I'm like well I hope they do it you know I hope they pull it off because I do want to see

[01:19:01] John's customers made whole I think out of all the chances he's had right of of making

[01:19:09] J. Pops Zidware customers whole and writing the ship this is the best shot John's ever gonna have

[01:19:15] because people forget like Zidware was literally just John in a room like tinkering with no help

[01:19:24] and that's why nothing ever happened in six years then you bring on Pintasia which was like a

[01:19:29] really just like blip on the radar sort of let's try to see if John was telling the truth

[01:19:38] like and then they realized he wasn't and the game wasn't anywhere near being done and they were

[01:19:43] like we're out of here then you had American pinball but now were they taking more people's money

[01:19:48] really at that point no at that point at that point all the money that had been taken had been

[01:19:55] took people foolishly gave money on retro atomic zombie adventure land and even gave money on

[01:20:04] Alice in Wonderland on nothing more than art packages alone okay so he was just like here I

[01:20:10] present you Alice in Wonderland and another and people and people said here take my money

[01:20:16] yep people gave deposits on them now we all know what happened that all that the games two and

[01:20:24] three were simply meant to buy him time to finish game number one the real tragedy in this is

[01:20:30] American pinball when when we think about like who really you know because individuals got burned

[01:20:37] some of them lost maybe 30 grand at most but dovel at American pinball lost like probably a few

[01:20:46] hundred thousand dollars because he believed that John could finish this on his own and dovel and

[01:20:53] the guys over at American pinball because I don't even know who was there like with dovel at that

[01:20:57] point it wasn't it wasn't Josh Kugler then there was no Joe ball so remember this was John

[01:21:02] Swindle dovel into like spending over a year at American pinball delivering what ultimately became

[01:21:10] the thing that was in my living room which was a broken blinking box of lights now oh land Robert

[01:21:18] Mueller has at least assembled a team of engineers of software people of old pinball designers

[01:21:26] I to sit and figure it out so I think it up all the ventures you've got to look at them all and say look at

[01:21:34] it you know this is the best shot now I still think unraveling the mystery of magic girl

[01:21:41] is gonna be interesting because the magic you got to do jazz hands when you say that the

[01:21:46] matter you're like the magic there's target this gave there's a target this to me this is this is

[01:21:53] like the one thing that just shows that John kind of just was in living in like upside down world

[01:22:00] there's a target by the left orbit that's right underneath the ramp and there's no way for a

[01:22:09] ball to physically even hit that target but it's there you can hit it with your finger and it

[01:22:14] registers it makes but it doesn't it's an impossible shot right and so look I I know they're working

[01:22:23] on it I know Robert has has come out and made some some bold statements about you know they're

[01:22:31] their ambitions and now it's a a wait and see I've gone on the record to say if they figured out

[01:22:37] I want magic girl number one that works because I've always wanted a working magic girl

[01:22:42] yeah but so so let me show though you don't do you think that there is there are there

[01:22:48] there are there are a lot of very wealthy people in this hobby as there should be I know you

[01:22:54] shouldn't be buying non-essential toys for like eight to ten grand unless you're rich I mean

[01:22:58] that's you shouldn't be for a fifth I mean 15 think about it like that black nights two grand

[01:23:05] a blah blah I'm sorry my regular my black night two thousand two grand regular black night

[01:23:09] goes any that runs around to I mean it's yeah you're buying a toy for fifteen hundred dollars I

[01:23:14] mean and it's not it's it's it's a toy that's sitting in your basement buying a sternly today is like

[01:23:22] walking into best buy picking up in a PlayStation or an Xbox and buying every single game that goes

[01:23:29] with that council and stacking it up on the register and being like ring me up I mean that's what

[01:23:36] yeah thousand dollars well I mean you got to look at it like the I and I this was the point two

[01:23:42] pinball right now and I I know there was a guy that it sent a letter to you before that you

[01:23:49] had read that pinball right now is very similar to how Harley was like right after terminator two

[01:23:56] you know with the fat boys and and like you couldn't get a Harley like if you

[01:24:00] soos the Harley's opened up boom you I mean you were on a waiting list and the guy would buy a Harley

[01:24:05] and flip it make five grand and you know if you could get a fat if you get your hand on like a you

[01:24:10] know a 95 fat boy back in the day that was like the shit and then all of a sudden all these custom

[01:24:16] bike guys came out and started making these you know so they were kind of your boutique motorcycle

[01:24:21] guys I actually had when I had a California motorcycle company it was a it was a soft tail it was

[01:24:25] basically an exact copy of a Harley with a you know an aftermarket motor and it was fast and it was

[01:24:31] awesome but you could because you couldn't get a Harley and that's kind of where these boutique

[01:24:35] guys came in because it was like the the take my money thing now is kind of run out because before

[01:24:42] Stern just kind of got going and then they put out some stuff and people were piling up and you

[01:24:47] still really couldn't get it any decent Williams and now I think people are looking in their basement

[01:24:52] and it's like I got ten pinball machines right you know it's I think it's getting back to that but

[01:24:57] here's the thing that's still again this is the marketer me looking at this this hobby and I'm

[01:25:02] a I'm a salesman with the marketing hobby right what's missing right now is I don't care like

[01:25:10] rich guys who collect anything they want to have something that not everybody else has and they

[01:25:18] want that badly in the world of pinball and nobody is satiating that collector and that

[01:25:25] mentality because let's look at Batman SLE cool I've got Batman SLE there's only 80 of them there's

[01:25:32] really what I'm saying to the world is literally you got one you you you're like I think I want

[01:25:38] to get one and you got one well here and well it's not like there's that part to get at the moment

[01:25:42] it's also like but hey I have one of 80 sticker sets I don't have an 80 one of 80 experiences

[01:25:52] because you can get the same exact experience for $7,000 less and there and there's no limit on the

[01:25:58] premiums of Batman now what I'm saying is is needed in this hobby and just for the collectors this

[01:26:04] is not for everybody so so Hilton cover your ears there's rich people out there I think that

[01:26:11] someone who makes imagine this imagine if Stern said we're only going to make 100 jaz pinball

[01:26:17] machines and they're $20,000 each they sell out like that like that yeah but okay but jaz pinball

[01:26:28] you could because okay so they're going to sell them for 20,000 they're going to sell 100 for 20,000

[01:26:32] each that's two million bucks okay but how many jaz pros do you think they'd be able to sell

[01:26:39] do you think they'd be able to make more than that with just jaz pros because jaz I wouldn't do it

[01:26:45] yeah I get they would I get they would and plus keep in mind you got to put out 50 a day

[01:26:51] in sure 20,000 a pop but that's why it has to come from the movie fields got to do but that's

[01:26:56] but that's why it has to come from a boutique day because like Ferrari doesn't look at how many

[01:27:00] Honda Civics and Toyota Corolla sell and say well maybe we should really enter that market because

[01:27:06] it's 4GT 4GT yeah but what I'm saying is like Stern I mean there's only like 100 I mean those are

[01:27:14] that's that you know I think Stern was really on to something with SLE is what they failed to do though

[01:27:23] is that as a 4GT is not built like a Ford Mustang it's not it's built like a specialty car

[01:27:32] now Stern Stern put lipstick on a pig if you will with Batman SLE I mean it's what you know

[01:27:41] look the build qualities gone down the materials have gone down the quality's gone down

[01:27:45] and yet the stickers are better you know better that's it they it looked better but it wasn't any

[01:27:52] better in fact in fact Stern's from a few years ago were built better than these modern Stern's

[01:27:57] and so like I think that's what's missing from this hobby is if I pay 15 grand you know if you if

[01:28:03] that was the one thing about magic girl when you stood over it I mean it looked like a $16,000

[01:28:09] special freaking thing and the materials in it were phenomenal and it's built like a tank

[01:28:16] it's just you know the tank didn't work so right wasn't much to do so

[01:28:22] where do you see David I know we're coming up a little bit on the hour so a few more minutes

[01:28:27] how do you think 2008's gonna be do you think there's too many games in the marketplace you think

[01:28:31] all these companies can survive and we we haven't even touched on some of the other ones like

[01:28:34] Dutch and highway but do you think there's just gonna be a thinning of the field or is there

[01:28:40] enough out there in terms of demand to keep all these companies going the demand seems to be there

[01:28:48] just from reading and talking to people and seeing you know on the forums and on Facebook and on

[01:28:58] Pinside and just looking at what people want to do and what's my next new inbox gonna be that

[01:29:03] question still comes up so I think it's gonna narrow out for Stern and you know it's funny you

[01:29:13] talked about your your your magic girl and how solid that was and that was built by American

[01:29:18] that Houdini man you grabbed that thing you know and that's the whole thing it's kind of like when

[01:29:22] you slam the door on the Mercedes you know it's got that crisp slam you slam the door on the

[01:29:26] Ford and it sounds like the door you know the one of the handles is gonna fall off right um you know

[01:29:31] I went when I'm playing Star Wars at 257 I'm throwing that thing all over the place I mean it's so

[01:29:36] light um Houdini is it's heavy and it's you know I think it's it's really it's it's it's it's it's a

[01:29:45] great time to be a pinball um to be into pinball I mean right now I think we're gonna have a good

[01:29:51] five years of some really cool stuff and then I think um somebody I mean there's gonna be a few

[01:29:58] guys that are gonna die off I don't think Dutch is you know let's see what Dutch does and then you

[01:30:03] got you got pinball circus they're like in and somebody's garage it looked like I mean I hope

[01:30:09] they pulled off. I mean I could take a picture of me like I mean hey I hope they make it and I

[01:30:17] hope they do well and and honestly I've never played the the pinball circus game and it looks

[01:30:23] really cool but I don't really give a shit I mean and that might be one of those those high-end

[01:30:28] pins that's that boutique that you were talking about that some of these will in pay $20,000 for

[01:30:32] awesome there's only two on the planet but now you know they want to do big bang bar how good really

[01:30:38] was big bang have you ever played big bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang good it's just

[01:30:41] it's just I've never played it it's famous because it's well it's it's because there's five of them

[01:30:45] or ten of them or whatever it is because it was rare it's also famous because the I mean the

[01:30:50] artwork is beautiful and it's an adult theme which was rare for pinball machines um but like I've

[01:30:56] said like I'm always torn about remakes because I think if you if you remake too many of the older

[01:31:03] games that are famous for being rare and sought after you ruin some of the specialness of a collector

[01:31:10] hobby because then everything is just readily available to everybody. Everything is just it's the same

[01:31:16] Harley weather it was from here to there and you know I mean I think that I think that competition

[01:31:24] is a really good thing because I think if anything if Gary Stern needs to make 50 games a day

[01:31:30] and other people are taking away their sales because the quality and the innovation is happening elsewhere

[01:31:37] it will for for us stern pinball to up its game right now nobody's really making them feel any

[01:31:45] dent in their market share I think with Chicago gaming and monster bash and Jersey Jack I mean they're

[01:31:53] going to feel it they're going to feel it there's no way the collectors are going to keep running to

[01:31:57] Stern every time but if you look at Chicago game and Chicago gaming I've got friends that have those

[01:32:04] you know they've got the medieval madness they've got the attack from Mars they're going to buy the

[01:32:08] monster bash I'm got to throw this out I hate monster bash I don't like the game I don't like

[01:32:15] I don't like it I just it's I have a problem with the that whole that whole time in our lives that

[01:32:21] was like the mid 90s when everybody retroed back to the 50s right that corny it's just really

[01:32:27] corny and creature really corny but American or Chicago pinball Chicago the remake guys they uh

[01:32:38] what were their business models remaking pins well what what's the next pin that's going to be

[01:32:42] worth what what is one of those going for eight grand yeah they're they're the L's are around

[01:32:47] $8,000 for tech from Mars remake and and why would you buy okay and and why would you buy anything but

[01:32:52] the attack from Mars remake because that topper is frickin beautiful well if you're you know the threads

[01:32:58] though man I mean I know I know and plastic are the wrong colors are bright and the coils are

[01:33:05] going to burst into flame hey man it's called growing pains and everybody and you did it as well

[01:33:10] said oh this remake oh the remakes can be way better you know what that attack from Mars it's been

[01:33:14] sitting around since the 90s never you know it's solid and it hasn't burst into flames and I would

[01:33:20] still I hope to God someday they make a scared stiff remake so that scared stiff gets down a

[01:33:25] little lower so I can buy one I want to buy an original scared stiff um I know I can't remember who

[01:33:30] else was on there that's big scared stiff fan here I think there's so I'm I'm so much more excited

[01:33:37] for what's to come then remaking what has that's the thing yeah it's just like that business model

[01:33:44] as well we're gonna remake old stuff well what is your new like what's gonna be their new title are

[01:33:49] they gonna are they just gonna remake stuff I mean because they are they're doing they said

[01:33:55] Deeter of magic they said um Big Bang bar they said cactus Canyon but they also said they're

[01:34:01] gonna make an original title where is it that's what I want to see because you're gonna they're gonna

[01:34:06] run out of remakes yeah it's like I don't think this marketplace can survive like past five years

[01:34:14] I mean the economies the like it'll pinball's not gonna go away but you're not gonna have 10

[01:34:20] pinball manufacturers five years and it's gonna turn back into Harley and right now Harley's

[01:34:25] Harley's coming out with an electric motorcycle that try to keep up with some kind of market that's

[01:34:28] not there so yeah five more years and it's yeah yeah there's a Harley electric motorcycle who

[01:34:35] and God's name it's just nuts but yeah I mean the Harley market it was like that everybody I

[01:34:41] mean there's those big things like they're looking they're looking at the world and saying

[01:34:46] you know every little millennial fucker is in love with Tesla you be said I am always surprised

[01:34:53] when I put up like if you could have any sports car which would you have if you put that up on

[01:34:58] social media now there are there are more half the people would want a Tesla over a Dodge demon

[01:35:06] and it's not just because of the speed I mean it's like you know they love and I get it like Elon Musk

[01:35:12] is it is a future man I'll tell you what that guy he needs to get in a pinball well I mean he'd he'd make

[01:35:22] he would be awesome well I mean if anyone is like the musk of pinball it's like it's like

[01:35:27] deep root I mean the guys are like you know talk like talking about the boldest things imaginable I mean

[01:35:34] but the thing about musk is like he's never made any money like right well you know what though he's

[01:35:39] got that government deal for 1.5 did you see those two booster rockets land yeah it was amazing I

[01:35:45] mean the end although but it was also but they cut away when the third one crashed come on yeah

[01:35:51] yeah and they were in it was the waves were splashing over the things like oh well you don't

[01:35:58] want to talk about the bad stuff so let's just over it those two it was happening live I was watching it

[01:36:03] we were at my office you got to realize man I saw manufacturing equipment space is a big part of

[01:36:08] my business so yeah we were we were literally watching that launch on the big screen at my office

[01:36:16] so it was a big deal as that was happening there were probably like a thousand people on
