[00:00] Wasting Away Again in Margarita, Searching for My Law, Shaker or Saw.

[00:12] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast, happy Monday, we are going to drop some heat

[00:22] on this episode.

[00:23] I told you I was going to make you wait a few weeks for the Jersey Jack news, I'm not

[00:28] going to do that.

[00:30] Everybody should be looking at right now the images of Alice's adventures in Wonderland,

[00:36] the Jabber Walk from the Jabber Walkie poem.

[00:40] I don't even know what this stuff is but it looks really, really neat and the response

[00:45] to that right now is very positive because people just want to see toys that work, characters

[00:52] who like do stuff and like sculpts that look really neat like little lampposts that twinkle

[00:58] at night.

[00:59] I think everyone's tired of all the flat plastic in the world.

[01:04] Take your flat plastic stern and go get some sculpts.

[01:10] So here's what's going to happen is Melvin's going to give us some exclusive images throughout

[01:15] the next couple of months and then this stuff is going to go up for everybody to see but

[01:20] you're going to be able to see it a few days before everybody else so that is exciting

[01:25] and look he's just got to sell 500 of these things.

[01:29] We've got 700 people right here listening to this right now which means if everyone

[01:37] who's a member of the Canada Club wants an Alice in Wonderland or Alice's adventures

[01:42] in Wonderland, 200 of you can't even have it.

[01:46] So that is why I think it's smart to get the Canadians and the Canada Club members images

[01:51] of this game and get them excited and so we saw a first look looks really cool.

[01:57] I've seen the whole game.

[01:59] I'm going to let them trickle this thing out so you're going to see this in bits and pieces

[02:03] but super exciting that that game is coming this fall but that's not where the real battleground

[02:10] is going to happen.

[02:11] The real battleground that's going to happen this fall into winter is going to happen and

[02:18] it's going to happen around one letter and that is the letter M. Yes, M like in Mary,

[02:26] M like in marriage, M like in momentum and we are going to see what I think our three

[02:34] M's come out in the pinball world starting in August and ending sometime in October,

[02:41] November.

[02:42] Now, you know me.

[02:44] I don't like to fill dead air with a bunch of nonsense and talk about my weekend for

[02:48] 30 minutes before we get to the show so let's just get right to it.

[02:53] The M's happening over at Stern Pinball.

[02:56] You know what they are.

[02:57] The first M is Marvel and there is going to be a new Marvel game that comes out this month

[03:06] in the month of Marvel which Stern is billing it as and it's going to happen in the next

[03:11] couple of weeks and you're going to see a new Marvel game from Jack Danger.

[03:16] It's going to have most likely zombie Eddie on art and it's going to be a really important

[03:23] game for Stern because John Wick was a sales colossal nightmare for them.

[03:29] It didn't sell very well and now this needs to be a hit.

[03:32] Now look, we've had other Marvel games from Stern and I think for this game to hit and

[03:38] for this game to get people excited, this game needs to be loaded with toys.

[03:43] It just does.

[03:44] It needs to be based on a Marvel theme that really is going to excite people.

[03:51] Now here's my thing people.

[03:52] I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is but I will tell you.

[03:57] It's starting to feel a little bit like Stern is out of a little bit of originality with

[04:03] the kinds of games we're going to get.

[04:06] I spent an hour on Friday talking to George Gomez and I'm not going to go into the details

[04:11] of our conversation.

[04:12] We had a really great conversation and it was nice just talking about the market, talking

[04:18] about marketing, talking about his company and I gave him a lot of really candid advice.

[04:24] I wasn't Stern with him, no pun intended, but I was very serious about the advice I

[04:29] gave him and my main advice to George was this.

[04:32] You're making moves that are basically turning off the collector to your company and to your

[04:39] brand and stuff like more Jurassic parks, more Elvira's, more this, more that and he confirmed

[04:46] for me that Godzilla Black and White was supposed to be a limited edition game.

[04:51] He said they have the mirrored trans light inside Stern's walls.

[04:56] He's like Chris, if you could have seen it in all of its elite glory with that, he also

[05:02] had like the cabinet decals that were like Batman SLE, you know those graphite ones that

[05:07] have depth to them and so yeah, we're not going to get it as good as it could have been

[05:13] but man, they really were going to release another thousand Godzilla LEs and they don't

[05:20] really seem to care what that does to the old buyers of the original Godzilla LE.

[05:28] That was my main takeaway when I was thinking about this company over the weekend, where

[05:33] they're going strategically and I understand where they're coming from.

[05:38] But the approach wants to grow pinball.

[05:41] He wants to establish Stern to be successful over the next 10 or 20 years but their approach

[05:47] is interesting because they almost have this attitude of the market I want and the people

[05:53] I want to attract to Stern pinball aren't the people that I have currently and it got

[06:00] me thinking is there a broad enough audience to get into Stern pinball outside of you and

[06:06] me and all the people that have been supporting this company all these years, are they ready

[06:12] to turn their backs on us and there's going to be like all these new people that get into

[06:18] pinball and apparently Stern's hired some marketing company that has basically showed

[06:24] them the possibility of how big this company can grow and the possibility of what they're

[06:30] leaving on the table and when you think about it, I mean it's really a tricky situation for

[06:35] them because think about it on a global scale.

[06:38] There's millions and millions and millions of gamers out there in the world.

[06:44] There's millions and millions of millionaires in the world and on paper it might seem like

[06:49] an easy thing to attract another thousand or two people to buy a $13,000 item because

[06:58] in that millionaire set where they're buying $100,000 cars like it's nothing, multimillion

[07:05] dollar homes like it's nothing, why can't we broaden who wants pinball and serve them up

[07:12] something that they would want to put in their home and here's the issue and I see this with

[07:18] every single category I work in right now, whether it's whiskey or toys or watches or cars.

[07:26] The problem is this, everyone thinks the only way to grow is to grow outside of your core fanbase

[07:35] and you start making moves that alienate the very people that keep you successful.

[07:43] I mean we saw what happened with a brand like Bud Light, you know when you go too far it's really

[07:48] hard to go back and rally your base if you push too far and the thing is this with pinball and

[07:54] just excuse this tangent we're going to get back to the titles that start with them but the thing

[07:58] is this and this is the thing that George and Seth and everyone over there needs to realize if you

[08:04] want to expand who's into pinball and who's into stern pinball you got to do it through the themes.

[08:12] That is going to be the only way you expand your audience and if you keep going Marvel and Dadrock

[08:19] you're not going to bring new people into pinball and I said this to George the ultimate opportunity

[08:25] you had was to make a Barbie themed pinball machine when Barbie was blowing up in the world like

[08:33] Barbie was the thing and think about it if you want to get more women and more parents in the

[08:39] pinball then put a damn Barbie pinball machine inside Ken's dream house and be a part of that

[08:46] cultural movie and then all of a sudden you've introduced a new set of people to pinball and

[08:52] think about this hobby have we ever had a hip hop or rap pinball machine have we ever had a pop

[08:59] music pinball machine have we ever had a pinball machine based on a Broadway musical that millions

[09:07] of people love I mean think about it I've always said this the Phantom of the Opera has made

[09:12] billions of dollars right hundreds of millions of people have probably seen this musical over the

[09:18] last like 30 40 years and I know they've made an old Phantom machine but nobody's ever made a

[09:25] pinball machine based on an Andrew Lloyd Weber musical and so that's how you bring in new people

[09:33] to pinball without alienating the old people because if you made a world under glass of the

[09:39] Paris Opera House and had that Andrew Lloyd Weber rock opera music going I mean imagine that in

[09:46] Jersey Jack format you're gonna bring in new people you know you're not gonna bring in anybody new

[09:52] with John Wick with woe nilly big juicy melons you're not gonna bring in new people with Led Zeppelin

[09:59] you're not gonna bring in new people with Foo Fighters and so I came out of that conversation

[10:04] with George I really did have a little bit of a shoulder shrug moment that these companies

[10:10] really don't have a strategy they really don't have a plan on how to expand in fact the plan they

[10:16] currently have on the table I think is gonna alienate all the old buyers that believed in this

[10:24] company that made these companies successful because they invested in their products believing

[10:31] that the companies wouldn't turn their back on them and when you make another Godzilla LE or you

[10:37] wanted to it telegraphs to everybody that you're turning your back on people that thought they

[10:43] were buying the final creme de la creme version of the game you were going to make we're not stupid

[10:50] like we know there's nowhere near 13 thousand dollars worth of value in any of these boxes of

[10:58] lights there's nowhere near 15 thousand dollars in value inside a jersey jack c e the only value in

[11:08] it is that you're not gonna make more of these creme de la creme versions and I don't think they

[11:15] care I think if it were up to them they would have made more ellies of Godzilla more ellies of

[11:22] ghostbusters more more more and it's like okay you're not broadening who's into pinball you're

[11:30] simply turning off and sending people towards the exit who kept your company successful all of these

[11:37] years and I'm seeing it happen across a lot of different categories and it saddens me to see

[11:43] that that's Stern's strategy again if they want to broaden I said this to George you got this Disney

[11:50] partnership make the freaking Lion King I mean my kid loves Lion King so much if they made Lion King

[11:58] I'd buy one the same thing I was like go make Toy Story one right you've got a Disney partnership

[12:04] everybody wants the original Toy Story and Jersey Jack flubbed it with Toy Story 4 your Stern go get

[12:12] the license for the first one but man it's not gonna happen with more Marvel and more Dad Rock

[12:18] so here the game after Marvel game is gonna be John Borg's Metallica I've been saying this for a

[12:24] while I'm here to tell you right now that's 100 confirmed it's happening and if you own an original

[12:29] Metallica they're about to make a version of the game that blows yours away now look it's been 12

[12:37] years so the statue of limitations on remaking Metallica is up but they're going to do it so

[12:45] we're gonna get a Spike 3 Metallica that is most likely gonna have all new artwork it's the same

[12:52] layout by John Borg he might have added some goodies to it it's a game filled with toys because

[12:57] Stern actually put toys and games back then I mean look at a Metallica from 12 years ago and now

[13:03] look at a John Wick and you tell me Metallica LE which was like $6,500 you look at a $13,000

[13:14] John Wick and you tell me we're not going in the wrong direction so they're gonna remake Metallica

[13:20] Spike 3 it's gonna have concert footage I'm hearing it's gonna have all new animations

[13:27] it's gonna have that incredible maybe the best code ever from Lyman sheets in the game and in

[13:33] all new art package so that's coming out and that's gonna be the big bet Stern makes this holiday

[13:40] season so if you own a Metallica and you think you've got a Metallica LE right there was all those

[13:47] like special versions and you put all this money and I get it you probably bought your game for a

[13:52] really good price and you're happy with it but trust me your game's gonna be lapped by this new

[13:58] version of Metallica that's gonna be your game just so much better with sound and lighting and art

[14:05] and animations and screens and internet connectivity everything about it is gonna blow your game away

[14:11] now look I wouldn't mind Stern going back to the well like this if they hadn't been going back to

[14:17] the well so much recently but again it just looks like a company that's running out of ideas a company

[14:25] that's built this big factory and they've got to keep all these people going and I would love to see

[14:32] more originality in theme selection I think they missed opportunities with like Superman and Beetle

[14:40] Juice there's like all these things I think they could have done and the thing is if they do something

[14:46] like a triple A theme but just do it better right it's like Star Wars should have been better

[14:52] stranger things should have been better Game of Thrones should have been better

[14:58] Led Zeppelin should have been better you know it's like come on Stern we know you got it in you

[15:04] I can go back 20 years now and look at a Lord of the Rings which came out in 2004 and that game

[15:13] is way more impressive than John Wick all right so that's what's next from Stern we've got another

[15:21] Marvel and then we've got Metallica coming out again now what's happening at Jersey Jack how's

[15:29] Jersey Jack gonna respond to this so here's the crazy part right and I know I said the letter M

[15:35] and you're like all right Chris it's Matrix like it's gonna be the Matrix and yes that is what I heard

[15:42] is going to be next from Jersey Jack but there's a real caveat coming so I heard from one of my most

[15:50] trusted sources that all the talk of Avatar all the talk of Muppets right that's another one with M

[15:57] all that talk is just a smoke screen this company has the Matrix and that is going to be Mark

[16:04] Sidon's game and everything else has just been a smoke screen to get you deflected away from what

[16:11] it's really going to be Jack is really happy about the next two titles which if you think about it

[16:17] would be Matrix and then Harry Potter okay now look if that happens and Jersey Jack comes out with

[16:25] the Matrix with its modern lighting system with a lot of toys in it with bullet time magnet action

[16:33] with clips from the first movie hopefully it's only the first movie hopefully it has nothing to do

[16:38] with Matrix 4 and 3 was also atrocious I hope it's just the first movie it's all you need now what

[16:46] makes me a little bit nervous about it being the Matrix is I know just like a year or two ago

[16:53] that property was available and I know Dutch pinball was thinking about picking it up but

[16:59] they picked up the better theme back to the future so is Mark Sidon's game the Matrix now here's a

[17:07] crazy thing I heard over the weekend and this came from somebody very very internal in the industry

[17:17] who knows everybody in the industry and he said Chris look I'm just gonna say this and this is more

[17:24] aligned with what you heard about if you can warm up to the theme you're gonna enjoy this game and

[17:32] he's like Chris this is also coming from my guy who was the only one who was saying that Jersey

[17:39] Jack was making Elton John and so I also trust this other individuals so here's the game that he

[17:48] said could be an out of left field theme for Jersey Jack you know and when he told me this theme

[17:55] I started laughing out loud I was like there's no way and then I had a pause moment and I was like

[18:02] well if there's anybody out there who would pick this theme and think it would work it would be

[18:09] Jack Guinari a man who thought that the godfather would work a man who thought that Toy Story 4

[18:14] would work now here's the crazy thing I heard he said Chris the game that Mark Sidon I heard is

[18:24] working on that if you warm up to it you're gonna enjoy it and it's another music pin he said it

[18:32] is no other than Margaritaville a Jimmy Buffett pinball machine now let that just sink in for a

[18:40] moment do you think Jersey Jack pinball after the last three titles is gonna hit us in the winter time

[18:50] with a Margaritaville pinball machine that is honoring the music of Jimmy Buffett I don't even

[18:58] know how to like discuss this further like I think there couldn't be anything further from the truth

[19:05] and you could say hey canada someone's just pulling your leg on this but they're not like they actually

[19:11] are serious so this is something that I haven't heard anybody say and I don't know I could see

[19:18] Jack Guinari thinking that if he makes a margaritaville pinball machine it would be the perfect

[19:25] addition to all the basement bars out there that all these grown dudes have he probably thinks you'll

[19:34] have one in every single Margaritaville restaurant around the world and that will attract people to

[19:39] pinball who knows maybe Jimmy Buffett is the answer to expanding pinball into the future no he's not

[19:46] I'm joking but you heard it here first on canada's pinball podcast that I am thinking that Jersey

[19:53] Jack's next games are either going to be the Matrix or Margaritaville don't go canceling your

[20:00] subscription I mean you have to be chuckling wherever you are right now in the world that I would even

[20:05] say such a thing you had no clue and I have that intro music on this show that that would even be

[20:11] in the consideration set of a Jersey Jack game but I know they were considering Bob Marley Marley

[20:19] Margaritaville Matrix Metallica Marvel are we stuck on M as the only themes we can make in

[20:27] pinball here's my overall take on all of it I still think this hobby is grossly overpriced

[20:36] I'm seeing all these second hand games what's gonna happen now when thousands of metallicas are now

[20:43] obsolete what's gonna happen if we keep going back to the well what's gonna happen to new and box

[20:50] sales if everyone just feels like you're gonna remake this game one day even better what's gonna

[20:56] happen to all of it also what's gonna happen when a dude looks down his lineup of stern machines and

[21:02] says hey I've already got a metallica I've got all these marvel pins I've got so many zombie

[21:08] games what's gonna happen when everybody just realizes I don't need any more of any of this

[21:15] I've got a plethora of the same type of stuff over and over and over again I know I've spoken to

[21:23] people who are like I'm not gonna buy the new metallica because I have it I bought it for around

[21:27] five thousand dollars I've enjoyed it for over a decade and I'm good with it like I'm just gonna

[21:32] keep it so I just think like all of this is gonna get to a point now where like the new and box

[21:39] prices are stupid the old people that support these companies all these years are gonna get burned

[21:44] they're gonna turn their back on you they've showed us they don't care right and that's not a good

[21:50] thing it really isn't I mean at least Jersey Jack like never went back and remade more pirate to the

[21:56] Caribbean in hindsight that's probably a good idea remember when Jack was making like different

[22:02] editions of the Hobbit black arrow edition all these different Wizard of Oz editions it didn't go

[22:07] over well and I kind of like that Jersey Jack has just made the games now now look the reason why

[22:13] they haven't made new editions of any of the newer games is they can't even sell the initial

[22:17] editions of the games that well I mean they made so many guns and roses pinball machines they could

[22:22] have made another slash version of that game maybe at the end of the run to commemorate it but you

[22:28] know they didn't so that's good but my overall feeling is that all this stuff is gonna come out

[22:34] right all these games stern with spike three the prices are stupid we're all not getting 40 50

[22:42] percent raises you know when I was talking to George he said that what's going on the market now

[22:47] reminds him of how pinball was before COVID and I told George I'm like George there's one big

[22:53] difference the prices you know the prices now are crazy the prices were not this much before COVID

[23:01] and so you had like a feeding frenzy when games were much easier to justify now you've spent three

[23:08] years handing every single one of your buyers who bought new in box whether it was an LA or a premium

[23:15] you've handed them all significant losses for three years in a row how many years do you think

[23:20] they're gonna keep buying and if you don't care about them because you think you're gonna attract

[23:25] new people to pinball you're not gonna do it people are not gonna wake up with all the things going

[23:31] on in the world and all the bills people have and all the responsibilities you can't just get bit by

[23:37] the pinball bug and then all of a sudden decide to invest tens of thousands of dollars in this new

[23:44] hobby as if nothing else in your world matters like it's just not gonna happen it's just never

[23:49] gonna happen everybody thank you for being a member of the canada club it's gonna be really

[23:54] interesting month of marvel then metallica matrix or margaritaville and then we're gonna get harry
