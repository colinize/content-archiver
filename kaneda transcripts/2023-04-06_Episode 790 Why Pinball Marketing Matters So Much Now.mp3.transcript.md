[00:00] Welcome everybody to the Canada Club, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:20] We are only 10 people away from 600 club members.

[00:24] Amazing, amazing everybody.

[00:26] So look, I'm looking at this home pin spinal tap video and it's horrendous.

[00:30] If you haven't seen it, go Google or go to Napsarcade and see the worst trailer ever for

[00:36] a pinball machine.

[00:37] And it got me thinking about the importance of marketing and pinball.

[00:41] And as you know, if you don't know this, I talk about it all the time.

[00:44] I do marketing for a living.

[00:46] And the job of marketing is to get people excited and engaged in a brand.

[00:51] It is ultimately meant to get people to buy more of your product.

[00:56] Now look, sometimes people think marketing is at the end of the funnel.

[00:59] The product is developed and then you go to the marketing folks and you say, hey, now

[01:03] you got to sell this thing.

[01:05] But really good marketing and the best marketing approach, it happens way before the product

[01:11] is even conceived.

[01:13] And when I think about pinball and I think about why pinball marketing is so bad and

[01:17] why so many pinball decisions make you scratch your head, the answer is simple.

[01:22] Most of these companies don't do any market research whatsoever.

[01:26] They don't do surveys about what themes people want.

[01:29] They don't do surveys about whether or not people want modular pinball platforms like

[01:34] multi-morphic or highway pinball.

[01:37] And what I've noticed is this, the biggest gamble when it comes to pinball marketing is

[01:41] people think if they build it, people will come that they will somehow have customers

[01:47] if they build what's in their head.

[01:49] And there were years people where people would buy anything and there were like years where

[01:53] if you just put the damn game in a box, there was a good chance you were going to find some

[01:58] sales of that pinball machine.

[02:00] But now that we've got like eight or nine companies trying to sell pinball machines,

[02:05] the importance of marketing and pinball and getting that marketing correct is more important

[02:10] now than ever.

[02:11] And I want to talk about a few companies and talk about their marketing strategies or lack

[02:16] thereof.

[02:17] And I want to talk about how if marketing was really in place in the right way, if they

[02:22] really had marketing people and strategist on board, how a lot of these companies could

[02:28] have avoided the current pitfalls they find themselves in.

[02:33] So let's start with Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:35] Now Jersey Jack Pinball is a company where I don't really feel like they have much of

[02:39] a marketing department.

[02:41] We know Ken Cromwell does communications for Jersey Jack Pinball, but I don't think Ken

[02:45] Cromwell is selecting the themes that are going to go into each new game coming forward.

[02:50] In fact, we know who selects the themes for Jersey Jack Pinball.

[02:54] It is Jersey Jack himself.

[02:56] And he has gotten up on stage and talked all about how he was the one who when Pat Lawler

[03:01] said he had five ideas for a pinball machine, he stopped Pat Lawler at idea number one,

[03:07] which was dialed in.

[03:08] You know, and a lot of Jack's decision making, I think was based on the fact of what he saw

[03:13] was successful when he was a salesman for Stern Pinball.

[03:17] You gotta remember, this guy sold a ton of Sopranos pinball machines.

[03:21] He sold a ton of Lord of the Rings pinball machines.

[03:25] He remembers how successful Guns N' Roses was for Data East.

[03:29] The guy grew up in the amusement industry, so I think a lot of what drove Jack to make

[03:33] the decisions he's made came from Jack's own experiences.

[03:37] And that's fine.

[03:38] You know, you can absolutely use what you've learned on the job to sort of guide you in

[03:43] the decisions you will make.

[03:44] But if we think about a company like Jersey Jack Pinball, let's imagine you're in their

[03:48] marketing boardroom and before you even start designing a game, you have to come up with

[03:53] what theme should we make to sell pinball machines to a target audience that is predominantly

[03:59] Caucasian men 40 to 60 years old.

[04:03] And you have to pick a theme that's gonna resonate with that audience.

[04:07] Okay, so let's go game by game with Jersey Jack real quick.

[04:11] Wizard of Oz.

[04:12] That does not seem like a game that would work very well at all.

[04:15] And I think the reason why Wizard of Oz was a sales success for Jersey Jack Pinball isn't

[04:20] because they nailed the theme.

[04:22] It's because when that game came out, what they did win people over with, it was just

[04:27] a game that was such an incredible spectacle.

[04:29] It had so much in it.

[04:31] It had an LCD screen.

[04:32] It had these full RGB lights.

[04:34] It had two upper playfields.

[04:35] It had all these mechs.

[04:36] It had a witch that came up from underneath the playfield, a flying monkey that magnetically

[04:40] grabbed the ball.

[04:41] And you look at all of the stuff that is in the Wizard of Oz.

[04:44] It absolutely embarrasses what's inside Godfather today, but also remember that Wizard of Oz

[04:50] when Jersey Jack showed it to the world, it was $6,500.

[04:54] So I think from a marketing standpoint, it was actually a good game to market for Jersey

[04:58] Jack because it was an iconic theme.

[05:01] He loaded it up with tons of magic.

[05:03] And he also got, which he hasn't had in a long time, all of the assets from the movie

[05:09] itself.

[05:10] And the next decision was the Hobbit, which we know how that went because the Hobbit movies

[05:14] flopped and then the game itself didn't really impress.

[05:18] So that didn't do so well.

[05:19] We had dialed in and from a marketing standpoint, that game made absolutely no sense.

[05:25] And something I want to talk about on this podcast is dialed in and Galactic Tank Force

[05:30] are very similar to me.

[05:31] It is what happens when you allow a designer to make a game for himself with hopes that

[05:38] fans of that designer will gravitate towards the theme itself.

[05:42] We saw it with dialed in.

[05:44] It didn't work.

[05:45] We saw it with Magic Girl and Raza.

[05:47] That also did not work.

[05:49] We're seeing it with Galactic Tank Force and we don't know yet if it's going to work or

[05:52] not.

[05:53] But when you look at all of these original themes that have come out in the last 10 years,

[05:58] the only successful one out of all of them has been total nuclear annihilation.

[06:04] And again, I would argue that the reason why TNA works so well, much like Wizard of Oz,

[06:11] when it came out, the game was an incredible spectacle to stand over.

[06:15] No one had heard music like that in a modern pinball machine.

[06:19] No one had seen a full RGB light show the way Scott Denisi put it into a game.

[06:24] And he really wowed people with the white wood of that game.

[06:27] I remember being at shows.

[06:29] That was brilliant marketing.

[06:32] Scott Denisi took the white wood around to all the different pinball shows.

[06:36] He was a very personal person.

[06:38] When you talk to Scott, he's such a nice guy.

[06:40] And what he was ostensibly doing was his own market research, his own marketing tour

[06:46] of his white wood stage game.

[06:49] And he was lining up his customers with every conversation he had with people at a show.

[06:54] So that by the time Spooky Pinball acquired the rights to make that game, Scott had already

[07:01] impressed at least 500 people on that game at all the different shows, with all the different

[07:07] conferences he went to.

[07:09] And think about it too, right?

[07:10] Scott Denisi did what pinball companies used to do.

[07:13] They put their game out in the world for people to test it.

[07:18] And he was also able to get valuable feedback from people as they were playing the game.

[07:24] Most of these companies don't do that anymore.

[07:26] And the reason why is the only sales tactic they have is now FOMO.

[07:31] And that's the thing that all of them are relying on, right?

[07:33] I'm going to show the game.

[07:35] I'm going to reveal it.

[07:36] And within 48 hours, I'm going to get enough sales of this machine to keep my manufacturing

[07:42] line going for the next six to eight months.

[07:44] We're going to talk about that and how I think some of these modern games are really going

[07:48] to screw over these companies because there is no way they're going to get enough orders

[07:53] after these reveals to keep their lines going.

[07:56] And they're going to really struggle not to stockpile inventory.

[07:59] But that's it, right?

[08:01] That's it.

[08:02] The only successful game, the only successful original IP game has been TNA.

[08:08] We've seen original IP games from Multi-Morphic.

[08:10] They have not been successful.

[08:12] So going back to Jersey Jacks, so then you go from Hobbit to Dialed In.

[08:16] You then go to Pirates of the Caribbean, a game in which they didn't get many assets

[08:21] from the movie itself.

[08:22] And then we all know how that launch went.

[08:25] Horrible marketing launch of that game.

[08:27] Remember, they showed the game.

[08:28] And they yanked out the mechs everybody wanted.

[08:31] Then we went to Willy Wonka.

[08:32] It was a really good shooting game from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:35] It didn't have all of the assets people would have liked, but it was still a good shooting

[08:39] game and I think over time people grew to appreciate Willy Wonka.

[08:43] But again, I would argue Willy Wonka.

[08:46] Men, 40 to 60.

[08:47] Are they clamoring for Willy Wonka?

[08:50] Are they clamoring for Dialed In?

[08:52] No, the answer was no.

[08:53] And look what happened when Jersey Jack Pinball finally, finally brought a theme out.

[08:58] Now, that hit the bullseye of the target audience 40 to 60 dead center.

[09:04] Look what happened when they launched Guns N' Roses.

[09:06] Look at the feeding frenzy to get a GNR machine.

[09:09] Now, look, if you're going to do marketing strategy on will Guns N' Roses be popular

[09:14] with white Caucasian men in the ages of 40 to 60, you could come up with a ton of data

[09:20] and research to prove that if you make Guns N' Roses, you will attract this target audience.

[09:26] And the sales speak volumes.

[09:28] And again, just imagine that game with no play field issues and no multi balls happening

[09:34] every 30 seconds.

[09:35] And you'd still have people clamoring to get a GNR.

[09:38] But even with the momentum fading after the play field issues and the gameplay issues,

[09:43] Guns N' Roses still is probably Jersey Jack Pinball's fastest selling game to date.

[09:48] And it might even be their best selling game to date.

[09:51] Okay, so after Guns N' Roses, how does Jersey Jack Pinball follow up with its next two

[09:57] themes?

[09:58] They make two humongous marketing mistakes.

[10:01] And again, this all happens before you design the game.

[10:04] So when you go to Disney and they tell you the only toy story you can make is Toy Story

[10:09] 4, somewhere in that boardroom, there was a marketing decision to go ahead with that

[10:15] license.

[10:16] And the moment that deal was inked, how did they not know they weren't going to make the

[10:21] Toy Story that people wanted?

[10:23] I don't think we've ever seen this before in the history of pinball theme selection,

[10:29] where someone picks the fourth installment of a movie that is by far the least popular,

[10:36] remember the demographic people, 40 to 60 year old men grew up at a formidable age loving

[10:43] the original Toy Story, not number four, not the one that was about Bonnie and Forky, but

[10:49] the one that was about Buzz, Woody and Andy's room.

[10:53] And again, that marketing mistake is why Toy Story 4, I would also argue the game is pretty

[10:58] empty and then they raise the price.

[11:01] But all of these things are marketing decisions.

[11:03] All of these are marketing decisions.

[11:05] And this is why the marketing at the very early stages is more important than the marketing

[11:11] at the later stages, right?

[11:12] If you make those early decisions right, like if you say Guns N' Roses, yes.

[11:17] If you say Pulp Fiction, yes.

[11:19] If you say Ghostbusters, yes.

[11:21] If you nail that early decision and the most important early decision is what is the theme

[11:28] gonna be?

[11:29] And if you can't get the right theme with the right assets, it's not worth making the

[11:34] game.

[11:35] So I'm hearing right now that Dutch Pinball might be making Batman 1989.

[11:40] And I'm here to tell you if they were able to get that license in the right way, because

[11:45] Mr. Sharp is working with Dutch Pinball, I will tell you right now.

[11:49] I don't even need to see the game.

[11:51] If they make Batman 89, anywhere close to what they did with the Big Lebowski, they

[11:56] are going to sell thousands of that game.

[12:00] Because in this demographic, that is a perfect theme for Pinball.

[12:04] And even though it's been done before, it doesn't matter, right?

[12:07] Jersey Jack made Guns N' Roses a better Guns N' Roses experience.

[12:12] So if Dutch Pinball makes Batman 89 better than the old Batman 89, guess what?

[12:18] The games will sell day one.

[12:20] And then you can start to have fun with the marketing, right?

[12:23] Because when you nail the theme and you know you have a theme people want, then you can

[12:27] easily charge whatever you want for your super limited version of the game.

[12:32] I mean it.

[12:33] If they have Batman 89, they can make a super limited 100 collector Joker edition and simply

[12:41] charge whatever they want it for it.

[12:43] And you would watch these rich multi-millionaires who live in 10 million dollar homes.

[12:48] They would march to go get one of those 100 for whatever Dutch Pinball wanted to charge.

[12:54] And the reason they can do that is people have an emotional connection to the theme,

[12:59] to the movies, and that is why people will separate their money instantly.

[13:03] But if you try to do that with a freaking Galactic Tank Force signature edition for

[13:07] 17.5, you are now insulting everybody, including yourself.

[13:12] And it makes no marketing sense.

[13:14] Let's talk about Galactic Tank Force.

[13:16] This is another game in which what marketing research did they do to determine that people

[13:22] would like to have a pinball machine where the cabinet looks like a tank.

[13:28] But before that, the other decision is this.

[13:31] McKess is giving David Fix Money to make me a game that's going to make me money.

[13:35] Isn't that the whole reason you would be in business for pinball?

[13:38] I want you to make me a game that is going to make me money.

[13:42] And the best way to make money is to make a game people want.

[13:46] The best way to make money is to make a magical pinball experience.

[13:51] Value begets value.

[13:53] And when you get the marketing decision right, the money will come.

[13:56] But if you get the marketing wrong, the money will never show up no matter how much Christopher

[13:59] Franchi marketing you do.

[14:01] And so they did zero market research to determine if people wanted a new type of pinball cabinet

[14:06] that looked like a tank.

[14:08] So zero there.

[14:09] Then you get into the actual theme itself.

[14:11] So what is it about tanks battling tanks in outer space to save the galaxy's ice cream?

[14:18] What about this theme is going to appeal to our target audience of men 40 to 60 years

[14:25] old?

[14:26] Absolutely nothing.

[14:28] If you were to do market research, how often are men in this age group talking about tanks?

[14:33] How often are they having conversations about ice cream?

[14:37] How often are they doing this, this and this?

[14:39] Absolutely nothing happening in this game really connects on any level whatsoever to

[14:45] what the target audience wants.

[14:48] The only one who wants to make Galactic Tank Force a real game is Dennis Nornman.

[14:54] And this is one of the biggest problems with all marketing.

[14:57] And I go through this every day personally.

[14:59] The hardest part in all of marketing is separating yourself from the equation.

[15:05] It is not your job to personally pick what you want.

[15:09] It is your job to pick what the consumer wants.

[15:13] It is your job to study the data and analyze the data and give the company a marketing

[15:18] strategy that will be successful because the consumers will want it.

[15:23] And we all know that Jersey Jack is making the godfather not because he did market research

[15:29] that people wanted a godfather pinball machine.

[15:32] He's making the godfather because he wants the godfather.

[15:35] Multimorphic only exists because Jerry wants that platform.

[15:39] It's Jerry's dream.

[15:41] It's nobody else's.

[15:43] If he did any market research about modular pinball systems where the playfield is a screen,

[15:49] he would get research back that would tell him this is not the right direction to go in.

[15:55] And even after 11 years of the sales not being there, he's still stubbornly moving in that

[16:01] direction.

[16:02] And meanwhile, Stern pinball will make more games in one week than Jerry Stelenberg has

[16:08] made in over 10 years.

[16:11] So then what is the point?

[16:14] What is the point?

[16:15] If multimorphic was a magical great pinball experience, we wouldn't even be saying any

[16:20] of this.

[16:21] But something's not working.

[16:23] And look, I want everybody to be successful in pinball and everyone can have successful

[16:28] pinball machines.

[16:30] But if you don't do the marketing and you don't do the research and you don't even try

[16:34] to test your ideas out until the game is in the marketplace, you run the risk of what's

[16:40] going to happen right now to Jersey Jack Pinball and to American Pinball.

[16:45] And here's what's going to happen right now to both companies.

[16:47] They have released two games into the marketplace that the market is not going to really gobble

[16:54] up.

[16:55] And what will happen now is this, because they did not make the correct early decisions

[17:00] on what game should we make, they are not going to have great sales.

[17:04] And the problem for both companies is this.

[17:07] If you don't get crazy good sales in the first month of a game being revealed, which

[17:13] is the strongest month, right, for FOMO and hype and getting all those orders.

[17:18] If you don't lock orders in in that first month when people see the game, if every day

[17:24] you don't have the line running at your factory, you're losing money.

[17:29] You're paying employees to stand around and do nothing.

[17:32] So that line has to be moving every day.

[17:34] I mean, that is Stern Pinball's model, people.

[17:37] The line is always moving.

[17:39] And that is why they're always running multiple games throughout the year.

[17:43] They lose money every day.

[17:45] The line is not operating at full capacity.

[17:47] They're losing money.

[17:48] And the same is true of Jersey Jack and American Pinball.

[17:52] So what happens when your Godfather Ellie orders aren't there, but you have to make like 100

[17:57] or 200 Ellie's a week, the line has to move.

[18:00] So what happens is this, they're going to have to make those Godfather Ellie's.

[18:04] And it was another marketing decision to tell the world, we're going to make 5000 of these

[18:10] Ellie's at $12,000.

[18:12] That is a marketing decision.

[18:14] And that was a boneheaded move because now there's no urgency to buy that Godfather Ellie.

[18:20] So let's picture this scenario.

[18:21] Let's just say hypothetically Jersey Jack makes a hundred Godfather Ellie's this month.

[18:26] That's 400 games they're going to make.

[18:29] Meanwhile, as of today, Godfather Ellie's are sitting at distributors unsold.

[18:35] So who's going to absorb those 400 games they make in the month of April?

[18:41] If you're a distributor, are you going to order more knowing you don't have customers lined up?

[18:45] Are you going to order more knowing you're reading the vibe on Pinside and other forums

[18:50] where people are saying, hey, I'm going to wait and see.

[18:52] How can you order more when you saw what happened with the toy story Ellie's you ordered?

[18:56] People saw that the game started to lose a lot of value right away.

[19:00] What's going to happen is this, both parties, both Jersey Jack and its sales force, its distributors,

[19:06] both parties are going to lose because what happens when Jersey Jack has those 400 games in a box

[19:13] and distributors don't want them?

[19:15] Okay, so let's say this, they then have to start stockpiling them at the factory.

[19:19] And then they're going to say, hey, look, we can't make more Ellie's, nobody's buying them.

[19:23] Let's go on and make the collector's editions.

[19:26] Okay, so then they have a thousand collector's editions to make.

[19:29] Do you think they sold all thousand CEs?

[19:32] I don't.

[19:33] I think they probably only took an order on like 500 of them.

[19:37] And the reason why I don't think they sold all thousand at $15,000 of pop,

[19:42] I think people looked at what happened with Toy Story.

[19:46] There are still distributors today that have Toy Story CEs.

[19:50] Now, do you think they made 1000 Toy Story CEs?

[19:54] I don't.

[19:54] I would love for them to come out and say they officially did, but I don't think they did.

[19:59] And all of this galactic tank force, Godfather, final resistance,

[20:04] almost all of it was destined to fail from day one when they made the marketing decision to go in that direction.

[20:12] You know, I'm going to tell you a true story.

[20:14] Sturm Pinball did not want to make Black Knight.

[20:16] Sturm Pinball does not want to go and make original IP games or IP that's just Pinball IP.

[20:22] The only reason they made Black Knight, and this is a true story.

[20:26] It wasn't even because Steve Ritchie wanted to make the game.

[20:30] Someone in the Stern marketing department, I'm not going to name his name, but you know him.

[20:34] He's a very outspoken personality.

[20:36] He convinced them to make it.

[20:38] He said, if you make another Black Knight, you're going to get sales.

[20:42] People love Steve Ritchie.

[20:43] It's going to fly off the shelves.

[20:44] And it just goes to show you this.

[20:46] Look, all of these Baldy Williams engineers, Dennis Nordman, John Poppadook, Steve Ritchie.

[20:51] Look, everyone's only as good as the team around them.

[20:55] And I mean that like same thing with Keith Elwin.

[20:57] Everybody needs a team around them to make the games great.

[21:02] Look at how good Dennis Nordman's Elvira was when he was surrounded by the talent at Stern Pinball.

[21:10] Look at Galactic Tank Force when he doesn't have access to that talent anymore.

[21:14] Night and day difference in the games.

[21:17] So what's going to be interesting now is this.

[21:20] Is what do these companies do now from a marketing standpoint

[21:24] after their games have not had great sales windows after reveal?

[21:28] Let's take Godfather again.

[21:30] If you make Godfather, right, and it's not selling great,

[21:33] the only way to get people to buy the game now is to get the game on location, right?

[21:38] You need more people to play the game, have a great experience,

[21:42] and then want to go order it for their home.

[21:45] Here's the problem with the Godfather.

[21:47] It's $12,000.

[21:50] Why would an operator put a $12,000 machine on location

[21:54] when they can go get a Foo Fighters for $6,500,

[21:58] spend half as much money, and get just as many plays?

[22:02] And also have a game that's not going to break down as often as a JJP game breaks down.

[22:07] It's a real marketing problem now.

[22:09] They're not used to this.

[22:11] Jersey Jack is not used to this.

[22:13] A lot of these decisions were made in years in which everything sold no matter what you did.

[22:19] And so this is going to be a very interesting next four to five months for companies like Jersey Jack,

[22:26] companies like American Pinball.

[22:27] But here's the other part.

[22:28] And this is why I think they make some of these cavalier marketing decisions.

[22:32] And then I'm going to end this show.

[22:33] It's almost like they can make cavalier marketing decisions.

[22:37] That won't pan out because both of these companies are not self-sufficient.

[22:42] They're not accountable for the decisions they make.

[22:45] They are being bankrolled by other people's investments.

[22:49] Like this game doesn't have to be successful and profitable enough

[22:52] for us to get to the next game.

[22:54] So we better make sure we get it right.

[22:56] You've got the Abbas family money backing Jersey Jack Pinball.

[22:59] They can't be happy at the sales of Toy Story 4 and Godfather.

[23:02] But it doesn't matter.

[23:03] This whole thing could be a tax write off for them.

[23:06] And then you've got Aimtron, which is bankrolling American Pinball.

[23:09] Because if American Pinball really needed to make a profit,

[23:13] there is no way you land on a game like Legends of Vahala.

[23:17] There is no way.

[23:18] People didn't want that game when they could have had it from Riot Pinball.

[23:21] They couldn't even get like a few hundred people to sign up to buy it when Riot wanted to make it.

[23:27] If you really wanted to make a profit,

[23:29] you wouldn't just make Dennis Norman's wacky garage build game Galactic Tank Force.

[23:35] If you really wanted to make a profit,

[23:37] you would have secured the Sonic the Hedgehog license and just made that game.

[23:42] If all of these companies really wanted to make the greatest profit right now,

[23:46] somebody would have grabbed the Super Mario Brothers license

[23:49] and had that pinball machine ready to be in the market when the new movie came out.

[23:54] Look, and I know it's hard to secure some of these licenses.

[23:58] I know it.

[23:58] I know it's not easy.

[24:00] But still, American Pinball, I guarantee you,

[24:03] they could have made The Last Starfighter,

[24:05] even though it's a weird movie.

[24:07] Look at everything that 40 to 60 year old men grew up with.

[24:10] And there are still a ton of untapped licenses

[24:15] that you could have made ahead of Galactic Tank Force.

[24:19] I think it's time in Pinball that all of these companies realize

[24:23] nobody cares about who your designer is from back in the day.

[24:27] Do you know American Pinball's next marketing decision is this?

[24:30] They're going to make Barry Osler's last game that he designed.

[24:34] Why?

[24:35] Why would you make Barry O's final game when you need to make money?

[24:41] You need to make a profit.

[24:43] Nobody cares about Barry O that much.

[24:45] In the 40 to 60 year old buying demographic with games costing this much money,

[24:50] that means nothing.

[24:52] Stop making decisions based on the past.

[24:54] Stop making decisions on people's legacies in pinball that don't really matter.

[24:59] Start doing some market research.

[25:01] And what's funny to me in all of my years,

[25:03] in all of my years of being in marketing,

[25:06] and my bill rate is a lot of money an hour,

[25:09] none of these pinball companies have ever asked me to sign an NDA

[25:13] and run some thoughts by me.

[25:15] Look, the professional side of me, I'm very respectful.

[25:18] I never break NDA, but only when there's a contract in place people.

[25:22] If you just want to send me stuff and say, hey, don't share it up,

[25:25] and I'll just end this show by saying this,

[25:27] I wish more of these companies had to survive based on their game's performances

[25:33] and weren't staying in business because they were bankrolled by another company.

[25:38] I mean, CGC is the same way.

[25:40] Churchill Cabinets is what bankrolls CGC.

[25:43] It's why their line cannot be moving for like a year and a half,

[25:46] and it doesn't matter.

[25:48] And it's ultimately why when all the dust settles,

[25:52] stern pinball clobbers everybody because they're the only company

[25:56] that keeps the line going constantly.

[25:59] And the other one that also does it is spooky pinball.

[26:02] Say what you will about spooky.

[26:04] They understand that principle.

[26:06] Everybody else has got like ancillary money or just making wacky marketing decisions

[26:12] and their sales aren't there.

[26:14] And that's why they won't tell you transparently how many games do you make a month?

[26:18] How many games have you sold to date?

[26:20] All of it is a mystery.

[26:22] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[26:24] This is just a little like off the cuff episode.

[26:26] We'll get back to pinball news and what's happening in the pinball marketplace.

[26:30] But I just wanted to say this.

[26:31] The most important decision that is made in pinball happens before a game is ever designed.

[26:37] You've got to give your designer the right theme, the right assets,

[26:42] and you've got to know that the target consumer will absorb it.

[26:47] It's not 1995 anymore.

[26:49] If medieval madness came out today, I'm not sure it would have the same success as it did

[26:55] when it came out in the mid 90s.

[26:57] It's just a different world now.

[27:00] Later.

[27:19] Hey!
