[00:00] He's a rabble, he'll never, never be any good.

[00:04] He's a rabble, cause he never, never, never, nobody shows.

[00:08] I love hearing that intro music because it means we're about to embark on another

[00:19] episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast and this is episode number 300 and I think that's

[00:26] an incredible milestone for us to achieve.

[00:29] For those of you who have listened from day one, you know one thing.

[00:34] There's been more than 300 episodes because we've deleted a few of them here and there.

[00:38] Hopefully on this episode you're hearing an improved audio quality email me if you think

[00:43] it sounds better at canadapimballadgmail.com.

[00:47] I just want to say this.

[00:48] I was going to do some like milestone episode this and that, this and that, but I decided

[00:52] you know what makes this podcast special is that we don't do it like that.

[00:57] We just keep going, right?

[00:59] We go, we do three episodes a week, you tune in, you catch up.

[01:04] I think I'm always ahead of you guys.

[01:05] I mean, it's, it's crazy.

[01:06] I think I'm putting up shows faster than many of you can actually keep up, but that's why

[01:11] I enjoy doing it because I know when you want a pinball podcast, there probably will be

[01:18] a few canada pinball podcasts that you haven't even listened to yet.

[01:22] It's an exciting time to be in the hobby.

[01:24] I love doing this show and I thank all of you who tune in on a weekly basis.

[01:30] You know, sometimes we get interviews, sometimes we don't.

[01:32] Sometimes we put up funny skits, sometimes we don't.

[01:35] Sometimes we hear from my master, sometimes we don't.

[01:38] It's always different.

[01:39] I hope it's refreshing.

[01:41] I know it's entertaining.

[01:42] I know it's entertaining and I'm glad you guys find it entertaining.

[01:46] I have a great guest on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast and I did something that

[01:51] I think a lot of you wanted me to do.

[01:53] I did another prediction show because we love Ted.

[01:56] We think Ted is a great guy, but I do agree that those were not predictions.

[02:01] They were wishful hopes that Ted has.

[02:03] You think everything's going to succeed in pinball and I do love the optimism, right?

[02:06] Don't get me wrong.

[02:07] I love the optimism.

[02:08] I saw on Pinside something I said on the last episode is starting to, it's starting

[02:13] to rub some of the Ellie buyers of monsters in unique way, right?

[02:17] If Stern adds another 100 monsters at least to the mix, is that fair?

[02:23] Should they do that?

[02:24] The debate is raging on.

[02:26] They probably will.

[02:28] But then they probably will listen to this podcast and be like, we can't do it because

[02:32] then that will confirm that Canada was right and his rumor was authentic.

[02:37] I'm here to tell you, Stern has actually adjusted its marketing moves based upon stuff

[02:43] that we've said on this podcast.

[02:45] And I'll say specifically the one that I know for sure they did when we said Iron Maiden

[02:49] was going to come out that morning, they held it to the end of the day just to prove

[02:53] that I was wrong.

[02:55] I'm never wrong, Stern.

[02:56] No, I'm wrong all the time.

[02:58] Look, this is going to be a fun episode.

[03:01] Anything else going on?

[03:02] We didn't talk about the pinball tax and I don't really want to go too deep into it because

[03:05] that thread turned into a bunch of class warfare statements, but the pinball tax will not

[03:12] help people buying pinball machines in 2019 to kind of sucks.

[03:16] Pack on another six to seven hundred dollars onto every pinball purchase and it's going

[03:22] to have people thinking twice.

[03:24] All right.

[03:25] There's a lot of stuff coming out this year.

[03:27] You guys, you know, there's only a finite amount of room and money that everyone has.

[03:31] I know sometimes it seems like everyone's got limitless pockets, but we know that's

[03:35] not the case.

[03:37] If you were to ask me the thing that I'm looking forward to the most in 2019, two things,

[03:43] the next JJP game and what deep root is working on.

[03:47] Speaking of deep root, we're going to get someone from deep root pinball on the show real

[03:50] soon.

[03:51] Robert has put me in touch with one of his teammates.

[03:54] I really, really, really look forward to this interview because you know, you guys are

[03:59] all wondering as I am, what is going on over there?

[04:02] So hopefully we can learn a little bit more about what's going on behind the curtain at

[04:06] deep root.

[04:07] All right.

[04:08] Everyone, I hope you enjoy this interview.

[04:09] It's a great one.

[04:10] We are going to be back more this week with more episodes of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[04:15] And again, 300 episodes all because you, the listener, have decided that this is a pinball

[04:23] podcast for you.

[04:24] So thank you very much.

[04:26] I swear from the bottom of my heart for tuning in every week and letting me see that

[04:31] listen number climbing, climbing climb.

[04:34] I really appreciate it and everyone enjoy this episode 300 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[04:40] Ladies and gentlemen, in a world in which nobody will join Canadian pinball podcasts, I'd

[04:45] like to welcome Greg bone from straight down the middle to the show.

[04:48] Greg, welcome.

[04:49] Anything you've ever had me, man.

[04:52] So Greg, I literally got so much feedback that Ted's predictions were not predictions

[04:58] and that we should do a new prediction show in which someone actually knows something

[05:01] about pinball.

[05:02] I don't know if I'm the right person.

[05:06] Well, you are, I mean, it was supposed to be Zach, but he's spending all weekend polishing

[05:10] his pin stadium lights.

[05:12] So you're the second.

[05:16] He's a busy man, man.

[05:17] Like he keeps it going.

[05:18] He's always editing something between this week and pinball podcast and our show.

[05:23] The dude is always on a computer doing something.

[05:26] Always.

[05:27] I keep asking him like, do you need Jeff's permission to do the show?

[05:30] And then that's usually when I just see he signs off a Facebook and he doesn't talk to

[05:34] me for like a few days.

[05:35] So he plays by the book.

[05:36] I don't always play by the book.

[05:38] Right, right.

[05:39] Like rogue pinballer.

[05:41] That's why you're here.

[05:42] So let's do it.

[05:43] Because I know you know a lot.

[05:44] I mean, there's not, there's probably like just a few hundred people that know everything

[05:47] going on and I think you're in that group.

[05:49] So let's start with our predictions for the year with American pinball October fest.

[05:55] What do you think?

[05:58] You know what?

[05:59] I know that you amazingly hate this game.

[06:03] But I for one, I don't mind it.

[06:08] I thought it shot fairly well.

[06:11] Some of the shots were a little tough, which I think Joe went back and this tweaking some

[06:14] stuff, especially off that third flipper.

[06:17] Astatically, I did not mind it.

[06:20] I do agree that the play field needed some work for sure.

[06:26] Some things on the back glass.

[06:28] I would have changed to I'm not.

[06:33] There's just some things that were cohesive.

[06:35] I'd like to see the game be a little.

[06:39] Overall, man, like I was actually, I was kind of blown away at the bottom because I think

[06:43] that it could have went in a worse direction.

[06:46] It could have been really bad.

[06:48] But I actually think it turned out good.

[06:49] Again, I know you freaking hate it, man.

[06:52] But like I was kind of, I liked it.

[06:54] I thought it captured that carnival-esque feel to it, you know, with the colors and the

[06:59] brightness and the way it was lit and the design with the roller coaster and everything.

[07:03] Well, you've played it.

[07:06] You've played it.

[07:07] And most people haven't played it.

[07:08] And I think it's easy to hate a game from afar.

[07:10] Now, they've made some changes to the pin.

[07:13] We see the new artwork.

[07:14] They've taken away some of the issues people had.

[07:17] Do you, are you happy with the final version that we've seen?

[07:22] Yeah.

[07:23] And I like that they went, you know, that they did that, that they listened.

[07:28] You know, I do feel that they're good about that as a company, that they do listen to

[07:31] people's complaints and things that need to be fixed.

[07:35] You know, I don't know.

[07:37] I like it.

[07:38] I don't know how much it will find its way in the people's homes.

[07:41] That's my only concern.

[07:42] I think that that Barcaids and Arcades are excited about, especially the Barcaids, obviously.

[07:47] But I'm still confused about whether it's a big home seller, you know, for that home

[07:55] market.

[07:56] Right.

[07:57] Yeah, I mean, that begs the question, right?

[07:59] So it is 2019 now.

[08:01] Where do you think and when they're going to be able to sort of drum up new hype?

[08:05] Is TPF going to be really the moment for them?

[08:10] I think it could be, I think, you know, like it's like any of these manufacturers, man.

[08:13] I think it's going to come down to their shipping and when they get it out.

[08:16] And I think that they obviously wanted to ship the games a lot sooner than what had

[08:21] happened.

[08:22] But then they come up with, you know, the complaints and the public and what was going

[08:26] on.

[08:27] And they address those issues, which obviously would set you behind.

[08:30] So I think TPF could, you know, if they start rolling out those games here, you know,

[08:34] real soon or right before TPF or TPF, I think it could be really good for them for sure.

[08:41] You know, I'm totally with getting one.

[08:42] I mean, it's a fun.

[08:43] I get I know that you just despised the theme so badly.

[08:48] But I think it's kind of a fun theme, you know, I could see it being in my house.

[08:54] You know, if I could afford one, I could see it being there.

[08:58] You could say, okay.

[08:59] Yeah, look, I mean, maybe.

[09:01] Yeah.

[09:02] So be honest.

[09:03] No, I mean, like, look, you know how I feel.

[09:05] I mean, my whole thing is just again, we're thinking about being a prediction.

[09:09] Do you say I think what you're saying is you like the game, but everyone's a little

[09:14] like uncertain whether or not it will succeed in the marketplace.

[09:18] And I think we all feel that way, right?

[09:20] And my whole thing is you've got to give yourself the greatest chance to be successful.

[09:26] And when you put a theme like that out, you're already sort of got two strikes

[09:31] when you walk into the batter's box.

[09:34] Yeah, I can agree.

[09:35] I think it can be tough.

[09:37] I think that that theme, you know, obviously was a hard thing for people to wrap their minds

[09:42] around, but I think that that what Joe did with it and what Josh did with it.

[09:46] I do think that it helped ease a lot of people's concerns.

[09:50] And I, but I just think it comes down to that dialed in syndrome thing.

[09:54] You know, dialed in, obviously got all the critique and it was terrible.

[09:58] You know, when the theme was released, but then when people shot it, played it,

[10:01] they actually enjoyed it, but did that still equate to home sales?

[10:07] They weren't real great.

[10:09] So a mix, I just don't know, you know, a prediction wise, I don't know, man,

[10:16] it's just that's such a tough one to predict of whether it's going to go well or not.

[10:20] Right.

[10:21] I mean, I don't, I don't, I think with so much coming out right now,

[10:24] we're going to talk about more of these manufacturers.

[10:26] There's just so many options that I think it's going to be hard when you look at

[10:30] Munster's Alice Cooper, who knows what deep roots got.

[10:34] You've got Monster Bash remake.

[10:36] You line up all the games that you could get brand new in box, right?

[10:41] And I have someone 7500 bucks.

[10:44] It's going to be hard to walk to October fest and be like, this is the one.

[10:49] Yeah, I can agree with that.

[10:52] It can, it could be tough.

[10:54] But you know what, they're good quality games.

[10:58] And I think it's just going to come down to whether shoes.

[11:00] I think theme, obviously people are going to pick other themes,

[11:04] but I think as long as they're having problems with that game and it's solid,

[11:08] it's well built.

[11:09] You get a lot for the freaking money.

[11:11] I still think they're one of the best bang for your book manufacturers out there.

[11:14] So I think that that goes a long way.

[11:20] So I wouldn't toss them out yet.

[11:22] Right.

[11:22] All right.

[11:23] So next on our list, Chicago gaming company and Monster Bash remake seems to be a

[11:28] game that is still just trickling out.

[11:31] Do you think in 2019, we will see another title or is it going to be all about

[11:36] fulfilling the orders for Monster Bash?

[11:40] Hmm.

[11:42] Man, I think I think we'll see a note title.

[11:44] I think it'll probably be towards the end of the year.

[11:46] I think they're going to want to start cranking them out.

[11:49] I think Monster Bash will start to lose its appeal by the time that they start,

[11:53] you know, they start to fulfill those orders.

[11:55] So I think it'll be ready for another game.

[11:57] I definitely think we'll see something by the end of the year.

[12:00] Which one do you hope it is or think it will be?

[12:03] I'm, I don't necessarily say that I hope that it is, but I would think possibly

[12:10] cactus canyon.

[12:11] That's just from thought no inside information or anything, just literally just what,

[12:15] what I kind of think it is.

[12:17] Just kind of here and stuff floating around.

[12:19] Right.

[12:19] Kind of strange that they dropped all those games.

[12:23] They confirmed all the games they're going to make years in advance, right?

[12:27] I mean, that was sort of an interesting strategic move by these guys.

[12:31] And it literally cut the legs off of the second hand market on all those titles, right?

[12:36] Whenever you see someone trying to sell a big bang bar, they're like, well,

[12:40] I don't know if I can get 15 or 20,000 for one now because it's going to be

[12:45] remade. So I should wait.

[12:47] Yeah.

[12:47] Yeah.

[12:48] Kind of crippled.

[12:49] It crippled that secondary market.

[12:51] Yeah.

[12:51] I'm kind of annoyed by that because it's like, I know people who are waiting for big

[12:55] bang bar and they're and they don't know if they're going to wait a year or four years.

[12:58] But it's going to happen.

[13:00] It seems, but I don't, my prediction is I just think it's all going to be about monster

[13:06] bash.

[13:06] I think if we do see another title, I don't think it's going to be to Texas pinball festival

[13:12] 2020.

[13:12] That's my prediction.

[13:13] I think these guys, the, these games are getting more complex, right?

[13:18] If you look at monster bash remake, a lot more complexity in that game than attack

[13:22] from Mars and cactus Canyon is a very complex game to remake.

[13:27] So I think it's going to take a little while to get it right.

[13:30] And I also think they're going to want to revisit the software on cactus can and,

[13:34] and make it more of that continued version that everyone likes better.

[13:39] Yeah.

[13:39] And that's kind of what I'm hoping for.

[13:40] I'd like to see that that cactus can continue or kind of a switch between the,

[13:47] you know, the original code, which there wasn't, you know, a whole lot going on there.

[13:51] But to that, that cactus can't continue.

[13:53] But see, I don't, I don't get in licensing stuff.

[13:55] I don't know what, Krifke, I don't know, you know, what all is involved with that sort

[13:59] of stuff around him and everything to, to be able to, to gain that and be able to use that.

[14:04] So you're, you're thinking that we won't see anything even a thing.

[14:07] You don't think we'll see a reveal or anything.

[14:08] No, no, because I think they've also learned to, you know, they kind of dropped the ball

[14:14] and getting people their monster bash is quickly.

[14:17] And we keep saying this, you've got to reveal your game and ship it within two months of reveal.

[14:24] And get it.

[14:25] And by that, I mean, there needs to be a decent volume of games going out to people.

[14:28] And we'll talk about this with spooky.

[14:31] When you make people wait because there's so many different options, I think people are going

[14:35] to start bailing more and more and go after what's available and get tired of waiting.

[14:40] So that's, that's just my take is if you're going to do it, do it right.

[14:43] But there's also no need to rush right because these guys are playing with a winning hand.

[14:49] Everything they do is pocket aces.

[14:51] Yeah.

[14:52] And I don't, I felt that they got them.

[14:53] I felt the initial ship, shipping of them was fairly quick after, you know, the release.

[15:02] Don't you or what was the time to an Ellie buyer?

[15:04] Remember asking Ellie buyer where their game is.

[15:07] Well, yeah, the Ellie's.

[15:08] Yeah.

[15:08] Yeah.

[15:09] But your classics and stuff got out pretty good.

[15:11] You know, that's, I mean, Stern takes what a couple months to get their LEs out.

[15:16] And stuff.

[15:16] I know it's a little different story at Chicago.

[15:19] But I don't know.

[15:20] I thought they did decent with it.

[15:22] Right.

[15:23] Well, the game's great.

[15:24] I mean, the game looks great.

[15:24] So they did hit out the park with the game itself.

[15:28] Oh, agreed.

[15:28] It's Chicago.

[15:29] That was that was kind of one of my number one games that I was wild by with it with even

[15:34] everything else there.

[15:35] I was just mesmerized by that light show and that display.

[15:39] Right.

[15:39] So speaking of will it come out or not?

[15:42] So circus Maximus is next and their two titles are pinball circus and kingpin,

[15:47] which we've seen a pretty far along prototype at last year's Texas pinball festival.

[15:54] What do you think Greg is going to happen with these two games in 2019?

[16:00] I have not got to really mess with circus, but kingpin kingpin is actually a pretty good

[16:05] shooting game.

[16:06] That game's actually, it's fairly well built.

[16:10] I enjoyed it.

[16:11] The code, you know, you can't learn the code when you're at a show really or you get

[16:15] a little bit of a grasp of it, but that doesn't tell you what you need to know.

[16:19] But it shot well and I enjoyed it.

[16:22] Aesthetically, it's not my kind of pin, but I, I think it's going to have a market

[16:28] if they do a small run.

[16:29] If they do something like spooky and they do a fairly small run of something and

[16:33] they just commit to a certain number of games, I think it could be successful.

[16:36] Now, why it's an interesting question when you talk about aesthetically, because I

[16:40] agree that the game, the gameplay is phenomenal.

[16:43] The mechanisms are really cool.

[16:44] It's a very fun, fun like game.

[16:46] And it feels like it would have fit in perfectly if it had come out into

[16:50] wide distribution back in the 90s.

[16:52] The artwork is atrocious.

[16:54] Yeah.

[16:55] And I'm like, why, why didn't they sing where the current pinball landscape is with

[17:00] how beautiful pins are looking nowadays?

[17:02] Why didn't they just redo the art?

[17:05] Because all of the hard mechanical engineering was done, I would have,

[17:10] I would have hired an artist to make it look as good as the current games.

[17:16] And, but we, here's crazy.

[17:18] We know they did hire an artist to make that terrible looking new translate.

[17:21] And they went backwards.

[17:23] They made the art even shittier.

[17:27] I hate the dog out of everybody that bad, but I can agree with the statement of

[17:33] just bringing it more, more contemporary and more current.

[17:37] I don't know the price of what somebody like zombie Eddie or

[17:41] Francie or anybody cost.

[17:44] So I don't know if it's a budget thing or not being able to find that.

[17:47] That's not as much as people think.

[17:48] And art is a one time cost, right?

[17:50] So and the other thing too, Greg, is they, and I think that again, this is

[17:53] where like they need to listen to the show more.

[17:55] They've also said they're just going to make like an unlimited amount,

[17:59] which is the dumbest marketing strategy when you're handling, right?

[18:03] A rare game that's very collectible.

[18:06] Like the only people who know Kingpin are collectors.

[18:09] Right?

[18:10] So why would you when you're bring, and that game right now, if you have like,

[18:15] what, there's like eight of them or 12 of them in the world,

[18:17] they sell for like 35 to 50,000 dollars, right?

[18:21] Why would you announce that you're just going to flood the market with an

[18:26] unlimited supply of something like that?

[18:29] What, what, what's the strategy there?

[18:32] I, I, I don't know.

[18:33] Like it scares me because it seems like when companies come out and do that,

[18:37] especially new companies, and I can't pinpoint it, you're the marketing guy.

[18:41] So you might be able to pinpoint a little more like I don't understand why,

[18:43] but it seems like failure in an aspect.

[18:48] I don't know if they're just too big, but that's why go back to like the spooky

[18:52] model for whatever reason that has worked for them, saying we're going to produce

[18:54] 250 games.

[18:55] And I think that they know the, they know the number of games they need to make.

[18:59] They know the cost of what it's going to be.

[19:00] I get everything's a little more set in stone.

[19:02] And you know, whereas when you just set this unlimited, the trickle,

[19:06] I think you may be wait for your second game.

[19:08] I don't know.

[19:09] It did for whatever reason.

[19:11] And I don't know why it does not seem to work in the pinball marketplace to do,

[19:16] to do that.

[19:17] I think that let's to set that limit.

[19:20] Okay.

[19:20] So, yeah.

[19:21] So what we're getting back to the numbers, right?

[19:24] So spooky's done it right is they've, if you look at what drove people

[19:28] to buy spooky, it was always when they started to limit the number, right?

[19:31] We're only going to make a finite number.

[19:33] And I think whenever you're dealing in a, in a, in a collectors market,

[19:38] and this isn't just pinball.

[19:39] This is watches, it's cars, it's anything I've ever seen artwork.

[19:44] There's, there's always a set number we're going to make.

[19:47] And then we're not going to make anymore.

[19:50] And what that does for you, it allows you to set the price based upon the supply.

[19:55] Because I think even Greg, if they said we're going to make 250 kingpins, and that's it.

[20:01] And we own the rights and their $20,000 each, they sell everyone.

[20:06] And I don't know if these guys even do, you know, because they all have these

[20:10] grandiose ideas that they're going to be stern, but let's be honest.

[20:13] No one can, it's just, and spooky's running into this.

[20:15] It's really hard to manufacture a thousand pinball machines.

[20:20] You'll be making the game for you.

[20:21] Yeah.

[20:22] You need us.

[20:23] And I think possibly a marketing strategy behind setting a limited number two is it,

[20:28] I think it forces people to purchase quicker and to buy them.

[20:33] Because if you feel like that you've got, you know, a year, two years to buy this machine,

[20:38] then you're just like, ah, whatever.

[20:39] But if you know, okay, it's at 250 pins, then I need to buy this damn thing in case it sells out.

[20:45] Because I'm kind of wanted.

[20:46] I'm on the fence, but the fact that it's going to be limited, I'm going to buy it.

[20:50] Whereas if I feel like that I've got, you know, time to wait and procrastinate,

[20:54] I've got time for more games to come out, then I might not be that buyer now.

[20:58] Right.

[20:59] So I think that that's one thing that limiting the number does is it kind of,

[21:03] it pushes people to purchase quicker.

[21:06] Absolutely.

[21:07] And if you're, if you're American pinball and you haven't, and you've said,

[21:11] we're going to make an unlimited number of October fest, right?

[21:13] There's no limited edition versions.

[21:16] People are just going to wait.

[21:18] I would wait to the code is done.

[21:20] Wait to the animations are complete.

[21:22] Wait to see.

[21:23] And also what people wait to see is, is the game going to sell used for like a thousand

[21:29] or two thousand dollars cheaper than MSRP.

[21:32] And I'll just go grab one of those.

[21:34] And then American pinball doesn't see a dime.

[21:36] And that happens a lot.

[21:38] Well, and especially, and I know we'll get in the spooky later, but, you know,

[21:41] that that, that I think is what kills a lot of things is you have got.

[21:48] You've got to sell as many as you can in that first couple of months,

[21:51] because once they start to hit the user market, if they start to, to devalue,

[21:54] then so many people who would have bought new in box is now going to wait and

[21:59] scoop one up because they don't want to take that thousand dollar hit right off

[22:02] the top or more.

[22:04] If they can, they can scoop it up for cheaper just by waiting, you know, two months.

[22:09] And absolutely.

[22:11] It's, it's, it's a, it's a very tough thing.

[22:13] Welcome to the world where now you can go get a beautiful, meant dialed in,

[22:16] and I'll leave for 7,500 bucks.

[22:20] Yeah.

[22:20] That's great.

[22:21] Two thousand.

[22:21] That's crazy.

[22:22] And I think certain, yeah, certain manufacturers fall into that worse than, than

[22:27] others.

[22:28] Right.

[22:28] Absolutely.

[22:29] So let's go on to probably the company that has peaked the most curiosity in

[22:35] 2019 because we also know the least about them, but they've made the boldest

[22:41] claims, I think in the history of pinball claims.

[22:45] And that is deep root pinball out of Texas.

[22:49] What do you, I mean, this is like an enigma, right?

[22:51] And in a lot of ways, we, it has to be real, but we haven't seen anything real.

[22:56] Yeah.

[22:57] And that's what's scary, man, to cancel TPS, that's, I think that that, that worried

[23:03] everybody.

[23:03] And I think it made a lot of naysayers feel a little more solidified in their

[23:08] comments and their statements.

[23:09] So I still think that that Robert's going to do whatever he can to, to keep the

[23:17] releases on track or early shipment dates that he's promised.

[23:21] But it's, it is still worrisome because it's pinball.

[23:26] I, I, I think the TPS skip is, is a, is a farce.

[23:32] I think they're going to be there.

[23:34] I, I think it, it is a, I can't imagine in their backyard,

[23:39] knowing everything they know that they're not going to rock up to the biggest

[23:43] show of 2019 with nothing.

[23:46] But dude, that's, that's a fucking statement.

[23:48] Like if they did, if they literally, they pulled the wool over your eyes and

[23:52] they did that, like I think that would help blow people's minds.

[23:56] And I think actually it's kind of marketing wise.

[23:58] It, and again, you could tell me whether I'm right or not.

[24:02] It, that's pretty damn bad ass.

[24:04] Like if you say, oh, we're not showing up.

[24:06] We're not writing them.

[24:07] Bam, you show up and you've got your five games.

[24:09] They're all working and you're just destroying it and it shocks people

[24:12] because now it's shocking all.

[24:13] It's not, oh, what's he, you know, we're excited about what Deepers doing.

[24:16] And we know we can see him at TPS if they just bam show up.

[24:19] I think that it's a, there's a certain statement in that and you get a lot

[24:22] more talking publicity going on because of that.

[24:26] Absolutely.

[24:27] Absolutely.

[24:27] You know, it, it, it, it happens all the time.

[24:30] It reminds me of like when I used to watch wrestling when I was a kid, right?

[24:34] And it just like the surprise wrestler runs into the ring and just knocks

[24:37] everybody out.

[24:38] I mean, I think it, I think they're going to go for a little bit of that.

[24:41] You know, that's my prediction is that we will see deep root at TPS with something

[24:47] that is going to blow people away.

[24:49] And the reason I say that and I can't have seen anything.

[24:52] I just can't imagine all these people working on this stuff.

[24:58] They know what they need to be, right?

[25:00] They know what Stern's doing.

[25:01] They know what JJP is doing.

[25:03] If they were to come out and not have something amazing,

[25:07] they literally would be dead on arrival.

[25:10] Yeah, I agree.

[25:11] I agree.

[25:11] I think that they're really going to have to knock people's socks off with what they,

[25:15] what they come with, which, you know, in the reverse, if they don't show up and

[25:21] it, it's true that, you know, they're trying to work on stuff.

[25:24] I do feel a little, I do feel decent about that as well because at least they're

[25:29] not prematurely showing a game.

[25:30] So I respect that in a sense.

[25:33] Absolutely.

[25:33] They've listened to the realities of how you communicate, you know, your game.

[25:40] Here, the thing is this, I'm a little torn though because I do think some of

[25:43] the stuff Robert said, I would never have said, right?

[25:47] I would never start to say that we're going to make more games than Stern.

[25:51] We're going to make more games in one year than all manufacturers combined.

[25:54] There's no point in all that, right?

[25:56] I mean, it's just a lot of hyperbole.

[25:59] If you look at the Pimbal landscape and then you think about it,

[26:04] just two good games a year is more than anyone else has ever been able to do

[26:09] other than Stern.

[26:10] Yeah.

[26:11] Yeah.

[26:11] I just, I'm not one, I've just never been the kind of person and I've just

[26:17] to go in and, and, and tout something bigger and better.

[26:21] I like to, to be fairly hesitant about it, but then overwhelm and the final

[26:28] thing, you know, kind of downplay it.

[26:31] Like I, I don't like to tell somebody what I'm working with.

[26:34] I like to wild them.

[26:35] I like for them to think that it's going to be okay and then to really show them,

[26:38] you know, so, so that we did the Twippy's last year.

[26:40] Like I don't think anybody thought the Twippy's were going to be really anything

[26:44] and, and Zach and I, you know, Zach put together a beautiful video package.

[26:47] You know, we had the tuxes and we did just all this fun stuff.

[26:50] And I, I think that if we would have touted like, oh my god, this,

[26:53] this twig broadcast is going to be amazing.

[26:55] We're going to do all this.

[26:56] Then people have an expectation.

[26:59] And if you go in with a low expectation, but then wow, I think it's a lot bigger

[27:03] impact than even being where you said you were going to be.

[27:08] You know, if I say this is going to be so great and you are great, it's less of an

[27:12] impact that if you just kind of downplay it and come in really high.

[27:15] Right.

[27:16] It's sort of like the origins of this podcast.

[27:18] Everyone thought it was going to be the worst pinball podcast on planet

[27:21] earth.

[27:22] And look, who won the Twippy last year, Greg?

[27:25] Knai just pinball podcast.

[27:27] Yeah.

[27:27] And who I love Christopher French, but what did they call their pinball podcast?

[27:31] The super duper amazing.

[27:33] It's all right.

[27:34] It's talking about expectation setting.

[27:36] But anyway, we may never see it.

[27:38] But I think it's coming out next year that podcast.

[27:40] But look, I agree.

[27:42] I agree.

[27:42] If I were Robert, I would have literally just said nothing ever and just rocked

[27:46] up and just pulled the curtain off of like John Papadouk's working version of

[27:51] Alice in Wonderland and just been like, drop the mic.

[27:55] We're here, you know, completely agree.

[27:57] So we'll see what happens.

[27:58] I mean, really interesting to see what comes up deep root.

[28:01] I think that is the monkey wrench that can be thrown into the entire hobby.

[28:05] So Dutch pinball is on my list.

[28:08] I might have to get to the point where we just stop talking about these guys.

[28:12] But what do you think will be the final outcome of the Big Lebowski buyers and

[28:17] Dutch?

[28:18] I don't know.

[28:18] I think it's almost done.

[28:21] I don't know because what do they have?

[28:22] I haven't followed Dutch.

[28:23] I followed it there for a minute.

[28:25] Is there still a bunch of games locked up or those you can't get those at all?

[28:30] Was there any made over there at the Chinese facility?

[28:33] There was there was none made at the Chinese, but the rumor that there's like 40

[28:37] games sitting at a array.

[28:39] Those games have now been there for two years.

[28:42] Plus.

[28:43] And I thought by now we would have seen them on the auction block or a array would

[28:48] do something to get rid of that from their inventory.

[28:50] But who knows?

[28:52] Yeah, because it does no good.

[28:53] There's still a lot of that money.

[28:54] It's still setting there in a warehouse.

[28:56] They haven't gained anything from that.

[28:58] Um, so I'm like, you know, I think that it should have been released.

[29:01] But man, like that, that is a game that I have heard.

[29:04] Nothing but good about.

[29:06] I've got to flip one once and, but most people who have had them in their hands

[29:10] or got to play them regularly, they love that game.

[29:12] It's, it's a great game.

[29:14] I, I will give these guys credit when they came on to the scene.

[29:18] And they did what I think, you know, deep root should have done is remember,

[29:22] they just showed up with the game and it was done.

[29:24] It was like, this wasn't like, give us your money on just theme alone.

[29:28] They had a flipping pinball machine.

[29:31] Uh, but then you know, the wheels came off.

[29:33] And I remember I still remember to this day.

[29:36] And this is when Stern people still talk to me before drinks were thrown.

[29:39] Uh, I was in a, I was in a, I shared a taxi with George Gomez to the airport

[29:46] from Texas pinball festival.

[29:47] And we were talking about obviously pinball.

[29:50] And he said Chris, because we're in a first name base.

[29:54] As he said, Chris, Dutch pinball will fail because they are contract manufacturing

[29:59] the games. You cannot contract manufacture and be successful in pinball.

[30:04] Yeah. I can see that.

[30:06] Unless you're, you know, unless you're contract manufacturers, a company like Stern

[30:10] that has like 30 plus years of building pinball machines.

[30:13] But to go to a brand new company and think they're going to learn the art of making

[30:17] pinball and an assembly line, not going to happen.

[30:19] All right. So Dutch is dead. I agree that there's nothing's going to happen.

[30:23] So the next is probably the company with the greatest public relation image

[30:27] right now. And that is home pin pinball.

[30:32] Thunderbirds. Have you played it?

[30:33] I did play Thunderbirds. Talk to me.

[30:36] Talk to me. I didn't like it. I didn't like it at all.

[30:39] Like I, I, you know, man, anybody that's ever listening to me, I'm, I like, I like most

[30:46] pins. Man, that's why I like, I'm, I'm that person that you hate and you specifically hate

[30:51] with those, those B ratings.

[30:52] That's our saying because you don't like it Greg.

[30:54] Is it going to get a beer of B minus on your rating scale?

[30:57] Oh, man, it's an easy B minus on that.

[31:01] No, honestly, if I had to review it, man, it would probably be my first D ease.

[31:07] It again, man, it had to have to, it actually have to probably fall a D like I hate to shit

[31:12] on that game so bad.

[31:13] But like my wife played it.

[31:16] We, we tried to play it a couple times and like, even ball two, I just didn't want to

[31:21] give it a chance. It just did not feel good.

[31:24] And it was one of those things that you could feel like, you know, some games you step up

[31:28] to give it a chance. It's just not my game.

[31:31] But you, you put 15, 20 games on there and you start to enjoy it.

[31:36] You start to learn a little more.

[31:37] You get your shots down, but this pin just did, just did not feel good at all the shots.

[31:43] Stuff felt cheap in it.

[31:45] But you know, it looked amazing.

[31:47] Like that's what blew me away as I walked it up to Chicago and it was there.

[31:51] And I saw this pinball machine and I thought, man, they're thunderbirds.

[31:55] I got to play that and I looked at it and I was like, dude, this isn't as bad as

[31:58] what everybody said. Like this, this, this, this damn thing looks pretty good.

[32:01] I, it's not bad looking.

[32:03] The layout looks pretty good.

[32:05] But you touch it and it's just a different story.

[32:08] Right.

[32:09] And I could have the plastic ramp because I've had some thunderbird owners reach out to me

[32:15] and be like, the ramp changes everything.

[32:17] I can't imagine that that would be the case.

[32:19] But was it the cheap flimsy plastic when you played it?

[32:23] It was a plastic ramp and it felt, it didn't feel real good when the one that I played.

[32:28] And the flipper buttons are a little different too, which I'm not going to,

[32:33] obviously it's something you get over.

[32:34] It's just taste, but it doesn't feel like our normal flipper buttons.

[32:39] There was, it was a difference to them that was a little off to the actual physical button itself.

[32:44] And I know that that's just a small thing, but that felt off to, I mean, it's just so much about it.

[32:50] It just did not shoot right.

[32:52] It's just having the shoot.

[32:54] What is it?

[32:54] You got a spell.

[32:55] There's some shit on there.

[32:56] You got to spell hitting all these targets.

[32:57] And it just forever long.

[32:59] You know, it's like a damn paragraph you're spelling.

[33:01] Instead of, you know, like lily on the monsters or something, you're spelling like a whole entire thing.

[33:04] You have to spell thunderbirds go and you're like, that's just too many letters, man.

[33:08] Yeah, it's just like, you're just being go.

[33:11] Exactly.

[33:12] Right, right.

[33:12] Well, look, I, it's okay.

[33:14] So you're not a fan.

[33:15] I've, I've never played the game.

[33:17] I've just, I've just never been a fan of the company and Mike and I think that I've never seen

[33:24] a company owner take the approach he's taken on trying to get people excited about his company and his

[33:29] pinball machine.

[33:30] My prediction is they will, they will not survive into 2020.

[33:35] I think this year, Mike is going to fail at getting sales.

[33:40] And I don't think we're going to see a game too.

[33:42] And if we do, from what I hear the rumor is, it's like a, it's like a bill of bond or like a surfing game.

[33:48] I'm like, this, this, just, just stop.

[33:51] Just go away.

[33:53] That's sort of how I feel.

[33:55] I mean, if, if, if he survives the, the lack of sale from, from Thunderbirds and he,

[34:01] he does go into a new pen and it does get released and he does not manufacture in quality,

[34:08] then I definitely think you'll fail him being bigoted and, and the problems of him and being

[34:13] confrontational and everything.

[34:16] You know, as well as I do that, people easily forget that if a good shooting game comes out,

[34:20] they end up not caring.

[34:21] So I don't think, yeah, people will forgive John

[34:24] Papaduke for stealing like $1.8 million if they make a working magic girl.

[34:28] The line will be around the block.

[34:30] Yeah, it's absolutely insanity in this, in this community.

[34:33] But, and I fall into it too.

[34:35] So I'm, I'm not razzling it because I fall into that shit too.

[34:38] There's certain things that I don't like about certain companies and people,

[34:41] but I still end up focused on their damn games and will buy it.

[34:46] Yeah.

[34:46] But I don't think that's necessarily, is downfall.

[34:48] It's going to be a quality of that product that I think is going to be the biggest downfall.

[34:53] It's going to be fun to witness the J-pop hypocrisy where everyone's like,

[34:56] I will never buy from this man again.

[34:58] And it's like, well, here's magic girl in the ball.

[34:59] Levitate.

[34:59] Well, where do I preorder?

[35:02] In Americans.

[35:05] And I don't know if it's just America.

[35:06] I guess it's society, but because we live in America,

[35:09] that's what I have to base it on.

[35:10] But we easily, or we forget everything politically,

[35:16] in our everyday world things that the hypocrisy of the world,

[35:19] we easily forgive and forget when something new comes around.

[35:24] That's whatever it's used to.

[35:24] Absolutely.

[35:25] It's the reason why Woody Allen is still making movies.

[35:29] So let's go on to a company that is probably, I think, the one that we all want to see

[35:36] knock it out of the park in 2019.

[35:37] And that's Jersey Jack, Pimball.

[35:39] And I want to talk a little bit about what do you think about pirates?

[35:41] And I know you guys have played it.

[35:43] And then what do you think 2019 holds for Jersey Jack?

[35:48] Dude, I love, I'm starting with pirates.

[35:49] I love pirates.

[35:50] I've loved it from the start.

[35:52] I think that they improved it.

[35:53] I don't know how that they improved it or what they did.

[35:56] But I've played two now that Zach's got his.

[36:01] And then I've played the collectors edition.

[36:03] And both of them shot phenomenally better than what the prototypes we were playing at it shows.

[36:10] Now, I don't know if it's just because of the, you know, the power drain that made

[36:13] glippers a little weaker and a little walkier.

[36:15] What kind of touchups they did.

[36:16] But I still think the game plays Marvis Marb.

[36:19] I'm going to say.

[36:20] Marvis Lee.

[36:21] Yes.

[36:23] And I love everything about it, man.

[36:26] Like I like the depth.

[36:27] I like the multiple wizard modes.

[36:29] Again, I know that you hate that depth.

[36:31] But I think there is a place for that.

[36:33] I don't want every game to be that Keith Johnson get like.

[36:38] But I do respect it in this because it gives you a lot to do.

[36:42] And I do have to kind of go against you a little bit.

[36:44] And I do think.

[36:45] Yeah, this is, I look, Greg, just for the record,

[36:48] I've been begging Zach to come on this show for months.

[36:52] And I've been saying him, look, I know you love pirates.

[36:55] I know you love Jack.

[36:56] Please come on and tell my listeners why they should love this game.

[37:00] And he hasn't.

[37:01] So I'm glad that someone is in defense of pirates.

[37:04] I'm just one voice.

[37:05] I want to hear why I should love it.

[37:07] And my mind can change.

[37:09] Well, and you know, my mind is just it's magical.

[37:13] You know, it's one of those things hard to put on.

[37:14] You know, Eric created something really neat with that rocking pirate ship.

[37:19] The chest works good now.

[37:21] It's not the way everything was intended.

[37:22] I know the spinning wheels.

[37:23] But even the one spinning disc is pretty cool.

[37:26] The plundering.

[37:28] It's it's just a magical game.

[37:30] That's fun.

[37:31] It kind of pulls you into world.

[37:32] And all the little hidden shots and all the different shots.

[37:35] That's a nice.

[37:37] It's nice to get away from that fan pattern and to have all these wonky shots.

[37:40] Like Twilight Zone or something again,

[37:42] where there's just under the flipper.

[37:43] And there's a gobble hole here.

[37:45] And there's all this.

[37:46] And I do think that there is,

[37:49] I think it's approachable to people that are not pinball people as well.

[37:53] Not necessarily code wise, obviously.

[37:56] But I think just because there's fun things to shoot at on there

[37:59] that make it approachable to non pinball people too,

[38:01] that come up to it in arcade.

[38:03] And it's so beautiful that it attracts people to that.

[38:06] The sounds are great.

[38:07] So I think there's a little bit for everybody.

[38:10] Like my question.

[38:12] My question.

[38:12] So I walk up to it.

[38:13] Right.

[38:14] Yes.

[38:15] And I'm just like a casual guy in an arcade.

[38:17] What do you think is the first thing that

[38:20] just I would want to shoot at from a visual standpoint that says,

[38:24] oh, I want to hit that.

[38:26] Oh, the ship.

[38:27] I think you're going to want to shoot that ship.

[38:28] Yeah.

[38:29] Easily shoot that rocket ship.

[38:30] And that's what I don't,

[38:33] like most people that I come across that are not pinball people,

[38:36] they don't even realize that there's rules.

[38:39] They don't care.

[38:39] And I know that that's when you're big.

[38:41] Like, you know, that you want to be able to walk up and you need to know exactly

[38:44] what to shoot to start a mode and do all this other stuff.

[38:47] Almost everybody that's not in a pinball has no idea that there's even modes

[38:51] or anything you should start.

[38:52] They're just wanting to shoot for toys and fun things.

[38:56] And I think that that's why that this can succeed there as well.

[39:00] And as a location pin and everything else is because there is plenty of fun

[39:03] things to shoot at and goofy things that happen firing the cannonball

[39:08] and everything that you can have fun with without having to know the rules.

[39:11] Do you think they should have just made it a pirate's game

[39:14] or does it benefit from the Disney movies?

[39:21] I don't think the Disney movie per se hurts it.

[39:25] But because I just like film, I like movies.

[39:28] So I know that that was like kind of a dead franchise.

[39:32] I hated kind of the later movies that came along.

[39:36] But I still enjoy that franchise and I still like that it's a movie theme.

[39:40] So you know, it's hard to predict of whether that it would have been better

[39:44] as just a pure pirate theme.

[39:46] I think that it would have maybe been kind of refreshing and there would have

[39:49] maybe been less limitations on their end.

[39:52] But you know, if they were forced into and had to take this franchise on,

[39:56] then I think that they worked very well with it and

[40:00] to not be able to really use Johnny Depp and the scenes and everything.

[40:03] I think that they overcame a lot of obstacles with this pin.

[40:07] And I'd say it was a lot more of a pain in the ass to deal with than what we kind of think it was.

[40:12] Right. Well, I mean, look, I love hearing a positive assessment of a pinball machine

[40:18] and I love hearing someone's excitement and enthusiasm on why I should check the game out.

[40:23] So Greg, I appreciate that.

[40:24] And I think, you know, for the friends over at JJP,

[40:27] you know, this is why I try to get them on because I think when you talk about the game

[40:30] and you explain why it's so special, I think it helps.

[40:33] I think it helps open people's minds.

[40:35] Now, the real question though is the year delay on the game,

[40:38] I do think is going to significantly make sales difficult going in the 2019.

[40:43] And how do you think that's going to impact the fact that, you know,

[40:47] this game was revealed so early, right?

[40:50] And then it took over a year really to get it into people's homes.

[40:55] Do you think we're going to see a new Jersey Jack game at Texas?

[40:59] Because if he shows Toy Story or Wanka, Texas,

[41:02] Pirate sales are just going to sink.

[41:06] I don't know if we'll see when at Texas do I think that if we were to see when at Texas,

[41:11] would it hurt pirate sales?

[41:14] I think anytime you release a new game, yeah, but I think that do you take Wonka or something?

[41:18] I think that it's such a different theme.

[41:23] Which one do you think it's going to be? Toy Story or Wanka?

[41:25] Ooh, man.

[41:28] I don't know because like I heard both back and forth for so long.

[41:33] When's Toy Story movie come out?

[41:34] This summer, this June.

[41:36] Oh, I think that it could be, I think it could be, well.

[41:39] But everyone's saying they need to wait for the movie to be out so they can get the assets.

[41:42] But that's also BS.

[41:43] Like when you're making a game based on a movie, the studio gives you the assets to incorporate.

[41:49] Yeah, they give you that.

[41:50] Yeah, I don't think it's coming up with that.

[41:52] It's whether they can reveal any of those assets.

[41:55] Because I think was it you that I heard talking about how well you don't necessarily have to incorporate new characters?

[41:59] Well, that's actually a really good point.

[42:01] So if T.P.F is in March,

[42:03] it probably would make more sense to do a Wanka in March and a Toy Story in October.

[42:12] Right? Because then you've got, I mean, Jack said we're going to see two new reveals this year.

[42:18] Maybe one is Guns and Roses, we don't know, right?

[42:20] But I think you're going to have to have the Toy Story movie come out first.

[42:26] Before.

[42:27] Yeah.

[42:27] Yeah, because I think I agree.

[42:29] I think that if you're going to reveal something at T.P.F, it would be Wanka for that fight.

[42:34] Because like I said, I just because I think that there's going to be some of the new characters.

[42:39] I would say that Disney would want some of the new characters in the game.

[42:43] So you would have to have like some kind of limited reveal on which I think would be a disaster to do that.

[42:49] Because you couldn't release these new characters before there's trailers being shown and everything else for the film.

[42:55] And I do think that even if the movie came out in June or July,

[43:00] and then you release the pin in October as long as they're going to ship and get them out by the first of the year,

[43:06] I don't think that's too long of a span from the time the movie come out because that's about the time

[43:09] you're going to have blue-ray DVD sales and everything coming out as around that Christmas time.

[43:15] So I still think that the hype is there. It's freshening kids' minds.

[43:18] So you start to see it on route in January.

[43:20] So it's still going to do very well and be very fresh.

[43:23] But I'm just a big fan of the simultaneous releases back in the 90s of when you had a pin that came out

[43:31] literally when the film came out. So you were playing that pinball machine while that movie was in theaters.

[43:37] Right.

[43:38] Still running.

[43:38] So yeah, I'm curious when we talk about Stern.

[43:42] It's almost like Stern's abandoned that approach and is going all towards nostalgia.

[43:48] We're not seeing any of that synchronization between new movie and pin coming out at the same time

[43:55] or they've stopped doing that.

[43:57] Well, but it's safer.

[43:59] Look at Johnny New Monink and stuff that came out.

[44:01] That movie flopped with the hobby.

[44:06] I actually like the hobby.

[44:07] Wait, the movies are the pin.

[44:09] I like both of them.

[44:11] Yeah, the hobbits.

[44:12] We found one person who likes both.

[44:15] Yeah, like I don't.

[44:17] I know I'm a unique individual.

[44:19] Like I've struggled with buying.

[44:26] Oh, hold on.

[44:26] Hobbit.

[44:28] I just cut out there for a little bit.

[44:29] But what were you saying about the hobbit?

[44:31] I just, I remember.

[44:33] Got a big peak.

[44:34] Yeah, just.

[44:37] I think it might be my

[44:40] with for a long time just because I don't know.

[44:45] Hold on.

[44:46] Yeah, hold on.

[44:46] Let me just just keep talking and I'll let you know it's I think it's my head said.

[44:53] Testing.

[44:54] Hey, Chris.

[44:55] Hey, there we go.

[44:55] I'm here.

[44:55] Chris.

[44:56] Okay.

[44:56] Yeah, so you like the Hobbit movies and the pin?

[45:00] Yeah, I'll do it.

[45:01] And I always get a Hobbit pin.

[45:02] I'm afraid that I get tired really quick because of that that's such a long journey and such a long

[45:07] ball time.

[45:07] And I'm not wild about lugging the heaviest machine in the entire world into my basement

[45:12] and getting rid of it in a month and having to pull it back out.

[45:15] So that's my only hesitation that I've had all the hobbit.

[45:18] It's just a different style of game.

[45:20] Right.

[45:21] I've heard good things.

[45:21] It's what it is.

[45:22] My prediction for JJP 2019, it's going to be, you know, I don't think it's like a maker break

[45:28] because he's got a billionaire financing the company.

[45:30] I think, but I think Jack needs to I think he needs to hit a home run.

[45:34] And I think we've been hoping he would do it.

[45:38] I've we've never seen any of his games.

[45:40] Fire on all cylinders.

[45:42] And we know that the themes of Wonka, Toy Story and Guns and Roses are huge themes

[45:47] that if they can do it right, I think Jack is going to see his best selling pin come from

[45:55] all three of those could be phenomenal sales for him.

[45:57] So I think then the question becomes, you know, he needs to get his manufacturing

[46:02] to be able to be as productive as it needs to be and as efficient as it needs to be to meet the

[46:07] demand those titles are going to bring to him because that's the other thing.

[46:11] It's like it's always like they have to relearning how to make games every game.

[46:15] And I think we need to see that be more efficient moving forward.

[46:20] And I agree. I think that that that is a key to their success.

[46:25] But also, you know, I would not prediction wise, I would not count pirates out yet.

[46:31] I just would not.

[46:34] I kind of got off track earlier, but you you alluded to this about

[46:38] them. Did it hurt the game coming out too early?

[46:41] And I think that it did in the production stuff.

[46:44] I do think they heard it, but I think

[46:47] game is on a rebound because of

[46:52] people enjoying it.

[46:53] Everyone that I've known has gotten one or I've talked to, they don't they don't want to let the game go.

[46:58] They love it.

[46:59] People are loving it.

[47:00] And it's like they're only game that they're playing in their collection.

[47:03] And that's a lot of games when you get it new.

[47:05] But I mean, there's nothing being bad set about it when people are getting into their home.

[47:10] You right.

[47:10] I think that that slow word of mouth, I think, is going to is going to equate to sales.

[47:14] Now, will they rebound 100% to where they could have been if they would have released it in two months?

[47:18] No, I don't think so.

[47:19] But I think that projected sales are going to be better than what they imagined after that hurt.

[47:24] Yeah. And look, I mean, Jersey Jack games stand above stern in terms of sound quality.

[47:31] And in terms of, you know, light shows everything about the game just feels more premium.

[47:37] And that's why I think when people get them into into their collections, they gravitate towards

[47:42] the Jersey Jack games.

[47:44] But we just haven't seen one that's really sort of I think hit it out of the park on all cylinders.

[47:50] And I think 2019 is going to be the year where we get the themes and the gameplay and the art,

[47:56] you know, and the sound.

[47:57] All of it is going to is going to come together in one beautiful package.

[48:01] And I think Wonka is going to be the one because we know that they have the rights to use

[48:07] the video clips from the movie and the actor clips.

[48:10] They have it all.

[48:11] So it's going to be I think a perfect theme integration.

[48:13] And I think that's going to be important.

[48:15] I think Toy Story is going to be the one where we're not going to get like Tim Allen and Tom Hanks.

[48:19] And I think they're going to struggle a little bit, right?

[48:21] With making that game feel as connected.

[48:25] But we'll see.

[48:25] We'll see.

[48:27] The next on our list is P3 Multimorphic.

[48:29] Greg and what do you think 2019 is going to hold for this platform?

[48:37] That's another one of those tough ones.

[48:38] It's actually technologically, it's kind of marvelous.

[48:42] And it actually shoots a lot better than what I thought that it would.

[48:45] The flippers are strong and it does.

[48:48] I thought those flipper mechs would be something weird and feel off, but they actually feel

[48:53] pretty good.

[48:54] And I like it.

[48:55] I would just my only critique about that company is I would like to see better visuals.

[49:00] I would like to see.

[49:02] And I don't know processing wise.

[49:04] I don't know coding or whatever else.

[49:06] I would like to see stronger visuals on that that play field.

[49:10] And maybe them start to gravitate more

[49:17] towards like not an adult theme.

[49:19] I wouldn't say that.

[49:20] But more just visually stunning.

[49:25] I don't know.

[49:26] I don't know how to see what I'm saying.

[49:27] Like, it's not like this.

[49:29] I look at it like this.

[49:30] You know when you walk up to a 4K TV, right?

[49:33] And you're seeing like a landscape or like outer space.

[49:38] And it's just like it looks crystal clear.

[49:41] Perfect.

[49:42] They've got a TV inside a pinball machine.

[49:45] And yet the visuals look like graphics from

[49:48] 1999.

[49:51] Yeah, like an early computer.

[49:52] Yeah.

[49:52] So it's like, wait, what's the point?

[49:55] Like why wouldn't you even imagine if you just had like a space game.

[49:59] And just the play field was just this beautiful like 4K visuals from space while you're

[50:05] you know flipping the.

[50:07] Maybe that's why they're incorporating.

[50:10] I think they're incorporating an LCD screen in the back box that can give you information.

[50:15] I think they might be doing that now that might free up some of the information that has

[50:20] to go on that screen so they can maybe incorporate some of that.

[50:22] But I agree.

[50:24] This platform is really interesting.

[50:27] It's been around for a long time.

[50:30] And I think it just needs this year, right?

[50:33] I think 2019.

[50:34] It's like Jerry's.

[50:37] He's just got to figure it out.

[50:38] I mean, how many years can you keep going?

[50:40] I mean, it's at what point?

[50:43] You know, he sold 50.

[50:45] They sold 550 TNAs.

[50:49] Yeah.

[50:50] Yeah, I think once he does, I mean, as long as he's not hurting and he could say in business

[50:54] financially, I think they're always improving and heading in the right direction.

[50:59] And I think that they've got some of the biggest balls in the freaking community because of taking

[51:03] this leap and trying something so so new and so different.

[51:07] I think that that's a risk that I would never feel comfortable with.

[51:11] So I always congratulate them and command them on doing something like that.

[51:16] But I do just want to see certain things polished it because I think they got a great flipping

[51:19] game. I think it's a well built game.

[51:21] Again, it's just to me.

[51:22] It's visually I want to see more.

[51:24] The concept is amazing.

[51:25] It's just in 2019.

[51:27] I want to see some things released for it that would maybe visually blow me away.

[51:32] And again, maybe it's just something with computing power and processing power.

[51:35] I don't know the limitations.

[51:37] We're always so quick to judge and we can always critique on things like that that we don't

[51:42] know what limitations that they're working there.

[51:44] There are no limitations in the world that people are looking for.

[51:47] Well, look, I mean, at the end of the day, let's say like you make a thousand dollars

[51:50] a game profit.

[51:52] That's $50,000 for P3 and $550,000 for TNA, which is not trying to be nearly as ambitious.

[52:01] And I think the lesson learned and, you know,

[52:04] nature is just to say this about P3.

[52:06] I just don't know if it's pinball enough.

[52:07] You know, it's trying to do so much.

[52:09] And it's instead of taking one step forward, it's trying to take 10 steps forward.

[52:14] I think if they can get internet connectivity and have the games play against each other,

[52:19] it starts to open up a whole new world of fun.

[52:21] Because I do think the simple games on that platform,

[52:24] when you know like that, that game where you connect two machines together and you're battling

[52:29] each other, I love that.

[52:31] I think that is really addictive.

[52:33] But you can't do it when you buy the game at home unless you buy two machines,

[52:36] which no one's going to do.

[52:38] All right, so we'll see.

[52:39] Again, in this landscape though, right,

[52:41] you see there's so many manufacturers,

[52:43] and we still have some big dogs to cover.

[52:45] It's going to be hard to succeed unless you're selling games every month.

[52:52] So pinball brothers, these are the guys that left highway pinball.

[52:55] And they say they might make queen or they might remake alien.

[53:01] I don't know.

[53:01] This is like kind of like in my Dutch category of like,

[53:04] I don't think we'll ever see these guys come back out with anything.

[53:07] I think their wives probably yelled at them for losing hundreds of thousands of dollars when

[53:12] they bought out at Andrew Highway.

[53:13] Do you think these guys will ever resurface?

[53:16] No, I don't think so.

[53:17] I think there's too much to overcome.

[53:19] Okay.

[53:20] I think queen, no, I'd love to see Alien Remade.

[53:23] I just shot on one yesterday again.

[53:25] I like that game.

[53:27] I'd love somebody to pick it up,

[53:28] but I don't think it's going to happen.

[53:30] No, and we saw that like,

[53:31] Ren and Stimpy queen artwork that they revealed that we know that queen,

[53:37] the band rejected it.

[53:38] So whatever they were planning was going to look freaking terrible.

[53:42] So, okay.

[53:42] Well, that band seems really hard to appease to with their image.

[53:48] So I think that they're fighting a massive uphill battle

[53:52] with getting them to sign off on everything.

[53:55] I think that's going to be a nightmare.

[53:57] And talk about if you were going to release a queen,

[53:59] Pimbal machine, you probably would have wanted to time it with the

[54:03] the Bohemian Rhapsody movie that just came out.

[54:05] So they missed that as well.

[54:06] So silver castle Pimbal, that's not a name we hear every day.

[54:11] Is it a name you're familiar with, Greg?

[54:13] I have honestly never heard it.

[54:15] So they're making time shock.

[54:17] Which apparently the story is that time shock was a digital or virtual Pimbal machine

[54:26] that they are making into a real one.

[54:29] This was announced four years ago.

[54:30] So I think collectively we'll both just say,

[54:33] no, we don't think it'll ever happen.

[54:36] Even though like every like six months they'll upload a picture of them holding up

[54:40] like an LED light being like it's happening.

[54:42] And it's like, okay, thanks for announcing it four years ago.

[54:47] Spooky Pimbal, because this is a real company, 2019.

[54:51] It looks like it will be the year of Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle production.

[54:55] And do you think we'll see Scott Denise's game number two?

[54:58] And I want to get your thoughts on how you think Alice Cooper will be received in the community.

[55:03] Okay, Scott Denise's game number two.

[55:05] Yes, I think it'll be towards the end of the year.

[55:07] But I think so.

[55:09] I think he wants that.

[55:11] I think Spooky.

[55:13] I'm not, I don't speak with Scott.

[55:15] So that's not anything I've heard from him.

[55:16] It's just what I generally a feel that he would want.

[55:19] But I think Spooky's going to need that next title.

[55:24] I think they'll be closing, wrapping up on the Alice Cooper's.

[55:29] As of for Alice Cooper, man, like I'm mixed on what how sales are going to be because

[55:35] I've actually kind of fallen in love with that game.

[55:38] It shoots tough.

[55:39] I won't say it shoots as tough and as tight as what Houdini does.

[55:43] But it shoots tough.

[55:44] But the new code is pretty good on it.

[55:48] I like it.

[55:49] I like the light show.

[55:50] I like the sculpt.

[55:51] I like the way it looks.

[55:52] It flips better than any Spooky so far.

[55:56] I actually like it.

[55:57] And I'm intrigued by the game.

[55:59] And I would purchase one.

[56:01] But my fear is that that used market declining sales problem of how far is it going to fall

[56:09] before it levels off.

[56:13] So that's my hesitation.

[56:14] But I actually think it's a pretty good game, man.

[56:16] I think that they did a good job with it.

[56:18] And I mean, they're already sold them all.

[56:20] So it's no sweat off there back on this game.

[56:25] Right now, it's just a how confident people are going to feel about them going into the next game.

[56:29] With this one.

[56:30] And no one's done it like this, right?

[56:32] With the non-refundable $1,000 deposit.

[56:35] So it's going to be interesting because I agree.

[56:37] I think what's going to happen is if people start playing them and then trading them,

[56:42] and for less money, if you're at the end of that line, you're probably going to kick yourself

[56:47] a little bit, unless you definitely have to have a brand new version of the game.

[56:52] I think 500's a lot.

[56:54] Well, there's still people that buy those new games for whatever reason.

[56:57] I mean, you look at the Star Trek Vault.

[56:58] I mean, you can find Star Trek's all over the place.

[57:01] And people were still going out and buying the Vault, which is absolutely no different.

[57:05] They were still just to have that new inbox that they were automatically going to lose.

[57:10] $1,600 on, you know, you could at least a good 1,200 to 1,300.

[57:17] You were going to lose automatically because that game had been out so long.

[57:20] And that's just what the market dictated on it.

[57:23] Right.

[57:23] And people were still buying those new inbox.

[57:25] So I still think there's going to be some people that still prefer that new inbox, no matter

[57:29] how low the game has went because they're going to keep it and they got the money to do so.

[57:34] I just don't have the money to do so.

[57:35] So I can't take that risk.

[57:36] I have to be very frugal and make my Pimp Bowl purchases wisely.

[57:41] Right.

[57:41] Right.

[57:42] Greg, my computer might die in like a five minutes.

[57:46] So if it does, and then we just go dark, that's why.

[57:50] And we might just have to like record the end at a later date.

[57:54] Is that is that cool?

[57:55] I might just have to charge it if you're free around today.

[57:57] We can just close out.

[57:59] So my prediction on spooky is 2019 will be a year in which they will make every single

[58:04] hour of Cooper.

[58:05] I think they've shown that they can make 500 games in a year.

[58:08] I think they've staffed up.

[58:09] Charlie will hold true to his word.

[58:12] I think you're right.

[58:13] I think we'll see Denise's game at Expo.

[58:16] I don't think it's going to be haunted house party.

[58:18] I think that's a total trolling of the hobby and the industry.

[58:23] I hope not.

[58:23] I hope it's not that theme.

[58:25] I'm just curious to see what's next from Charlie on a licensing standpoint.

[58:30] It's interesting.

[58:31] They've been sort of in the spooky realm.

[58:32] They haven't really had.

[58:34] To make any sort of corporate games like Domino's again.

[58:38] They've been able to make the games I think they want to make.

[58:42] But we'll see.

[58:43] It's going to be very competitive.

[58:45] I think Charlie,

[58:49] I think he needs to hand over the design reins to someone else.

[58:51] That's just always been my point of view on it.

[58:53] I think the games just need to shoot a little bit better if he wants to continue

[58:57] to remain viable with all the competition coming out.

[59:02] Greg, if Deeproot is a real thing and JJPs are real thing and Chicago gaming is a real thing,

[59:08] and you know what I'm saying?

[59:08] You get this list of nine, eight, nine manufacturers trying to sell games every year.

[59:14] There's no way the market can sustain all of those.

[59:17] No, no.

[59:18] I don't think so either.

[59:19] I think we're going to hit a point.

[59:20] Even though the hobby is grown,

[59:23] there's limited money in people's pockets.

[59:28] I think the majority of them are like me.

[59:30] There's obviously a lot of deep pockets,

[59:32] but I think a lot of them are like me where you have to pick and choose wisely.

[59:36] It's going to really come down to the theme and pricing on stuff.

[59:40] Deeproot can come in with that price,

[59:42] and I think it's really going to shake the market up a lot.

[59:45] Speaking of theme and pricing,

[59:46] let's go to Stern.

[59:47] The juggernaut in this hobby,

[59:49] with what 90% of the market probably,

[59:51] maybe a little bit less.

[59:53] We just saw monsters this week.

[59:55] I think they did a great job revealing it.

[59:57] What are your thoughts on monsters and on Stern's 2019?

[01:00:03] I think they're going to succeed, like always.

[01:00:05] I don't think there's going to be a hiccup with Stern.

[01:00:08] There never is.

[01:00:09] They seem to overcome everything.

[01:00:12] I think monsters is going to sell amazingly.

[01:00:17] The theme doesn't matter so much with that.

[01:00:20] I'm not a monster's fan,

[01:00:21] but it's a beautiful pin,

[01:00:23] and I'm probably getting one.

[01:00:25] It looks like it shoots phenomenally.

[01:00:28] I'm really glad that Stern kind of up that I don't know

[01:00:32] who was in charge of it or why that out of nowhere they did it,

[01:00:35] but I love the metal ramps.

[01:00:37] I love the light show.

[01:00:38] They didn't strip it down between the pro.

[01:00:40] I think this is going to be one of the best pros

[01:00:42] that you can buy for your money.

[01:00:45] I think that I don't know.

[01:00:46] Maybe they're seeing that deep root around the corner and stuff,

[01:00:50] and they're feeling they're going to have to up stuff.

[01:00:52] The little kickback over there to the left.

[01:00:55] It goes around the orbit from that dragula.

[01:00:58] I think this game is loaded for a pro.

[01:01:01] It's not very stripped down other than that lower play field.

[01:01:05] I don't know, man.

[01:01:06] I think it's going to be a hit.

[01:01:07] It seems like more people are on board with that premium and that LE

[01:01:12] than what they are the pro.

[01:01:14] It seems like they're going to have a lot of those high-dollar sales this year

[01:01:18] out of that game.

[01:01:20] All right.

[01:01:20] Between the black and white premium and the full-colored LE,

[01:01:24] what's your favorite monster's package?

[01:01:27] I prefer the full color.

[01:01:30] The black and white's grown on me.

[01:01:32] I thought it was pretty, but I think that it would lose its appeal

[01:01:35] setting in a collection.

[01:01:37] I like everything to be a little more uniform

[01:01:39] in that black and white.

[01:01:40] It would just stand out.

[01:01:41] I just think visually it would get tiresome looking at that damn thing too much.

[01:01:45] But it is beautiful.

[01:01:46] I say it's beautiful.

[01:01:47] Yeah.

[01:01:49] I know they pulled a little bit of a fast one.

[01:01:51] The black and white was supposed to be the LE,

[01:01:53] which does make more sense, but I kind of like what they did.

[01:01:57] They kind of made it a tough decision,

[01:02:00] but everyone kind of wins on these selections.

[01:02:05] I do think that everyone's going to walk away happy with the monsters.

[01:02:08] Curious to see how the game sells deep into 2019.

[01:02:11] It is a very niche name.

[01:02:13] I don't really hear people talking about monsters very much socially.

[01:02:18] But it looks to be fun.

[01:02:19] And I think the kooky campiness of it will do well for a stern.

[01:02:23] Now after the monster's Greg, we pretty much don't know much about stern.

[01:02:28] You know, in 2019, the rumors are this.

[01:02:31] We've got James Bond.

[01:02:34] I've heard Superman 78.

[01:02:37] Black Knight 3000.

[01:02:41] Jaws is just a stupid rumor that's always there.

[01:02:44] Yeah.

[01:02:45] And then there may be a vault edition,

[01:02:47] but we always hear the same vault rumors every year of Tron and Lord,

[01:02:51] the rings, which never happened.

[01:02:52] But they've done a good job of complete secrecy about what's next.

[01:02:57] Yeah, that's a little tough, man.

[01:02:58] Me and Zach were talking about that the other day about what the rumor mills

[01:03:01] kind of generated.

[01:03:02] Because like you said, you know, you're there's a small handful of people in the

[01:03:06] community that are privy to certain information that gets around.

[01:03:10] And it's kind of tossed around in a very small group.

[01:03:13] And we've got three to I forgot that.

[01:03:15] Yeah, and we've heard we've heard nothing.

[01:03:19] Like it's the same stuff, you know, just a little bit of chatter here and there.

[01:03:23] And I have no idea because the next title coming out was going to kind of maybe,

[01:03:28] this is why Stern wants to keep a lid on stuff.

[01:03:31] But it was going to kind of dictate whether I bought the monsters,

[01:03:34] because it's not the strongest theme for me.

[01:03:35] I thought it looked fun.

[01:03:37] I thought it looked like a shot well.

[01:03:38] I thought it was beautiful.

[01:03:39] But you know, if there was a theme coming out,

[01:03:43] up next in the next couple of months, then you know, I'd probably hold off on that.

[01:03:47] But I don't know anything, man.

[01:03:49] I don't.

[01:03:50] I don't know.

[01:03:51] Bond, what are they going to do with Bond?

[01:03:53] Is it going to be the Daniel Craig bond?

[01:03:55] I don't know.

[01:03:56] I don't know, right?

[01:03:56] Because James Bond has so many movies that span decades and actors.

[01:04:00] And I don't know how you quite do James Bond.

[01:04:04] I curious, but I keep hearing that.

[01:04:06] And I keep and I heard from people over in the UK where they're like confirming

[01:04:10] that James Bond is happening.

[01:04:11] I heard recently that Steve Richie is doing Superman 78.

[01:04:16] None of them are new franchises, like new movies.

[01:04:20] You know, everything seems to be looking back.

[01:04:22] Do you think we're going to see like,

[01:04:24] you know, here's the summer blockbuster.

[01:04:25] And there's a pinball machine to go with it.

[01:04:27] Or they've just realized that the money to be made with these like 40 to 60-year-old white dudes

[01:04:32] is by looking back.

[01:04:34] Yeah, I think it's looking back.

[01:04:35] And I think that they can get people our age on board too.

[01:04:38] It's a lot of it.

[01:04:39] I mean, look at Batman 66.

[01:04:40] Like as long as they make it pretty enough and fun.

[01:04:42] And there's something a little bit relevant to it for us.

[01:04:46] Then I think that that's the safest bet.

[01:04:49] I think to go with anything new,

[01:04:51] I think that they feel like they're creating too much of a risk.

[01:04:55] I think it's like anything in our society now.

[01:04:57] Play off that nostalgia.

[01:04:58] It's where the money is and it's where their safest bet is on there.

[01:05:02] Because I'd still love to see a Jurassic Park pin come out.

[01:05:05] I mean, you can go to the original throwback,

[01:05:07] but I'd be happy with a Jurassic World if they threw it out there.

[01:05:12] So I don't know.

[01:05:13] I don't know.

[01:05:14] I think so.

[01:05:15] I think that that's where their safest bet is.

[01:05:17] So I don't think we're going to see anything super current come from them for quite a while.

[01:05:22] I agree.

[01:05:23] I agree.

[01:05:23] So Greg, we'll just skip over Team Mafia, the pinball,

[01:05:27] that they're not going to sell anymore than the 8th they made.

[01:05:29] We all know that.

[01:05:30] Hopefully Joe from Joe Newhart from pinball started order anymore of the founders additions.

[01:05:36] Those guys they found it turned.

[01:05:38] So what are your final thoughts just in terms of 2019?

[01:05:41] What kind of year do you think it's going to be for pinball?

[01:05:43] Are we going to see too many games?

[01:05:44] Are we going to see some companies fail?

[01:05:46] Is it just going to be enough for everybody?

[01:05:47] Like what do you think?

[01:05:48] I don't know if we're going to see anybody fail this year.

[01:05:51] Maybe something like home pin, like we talked about something like that.

[01:05:54] I think JJP is going to be in there for through 2019 easily.

[01:05:58] I think the same thing with spooky,

[01:05:59] Stern's obviously there.

[01:06:01] Chicago gaming is going to be in there strong.

[01:06:06] I think that if anything,

[01:06:08] this year could be the year if Deeproot does come out with something.

[01:06:11] I think this could be the year of where that it sets up 2020 for those failures

[01:06:16] because of the over saturation of the market with pins.

[01:06:21] Because they said there's this market.

[01:06:22] It's market's only so small, man.

[01:06:25] And when you've got Houdini and I mean,

[01:06:26] not Houdini, but you've got American pinball and you've got all this going on

[01:06:29] and all these games created, there's it's not a very large market.

[01:06:34] Right.

[01:06:34] I think we're so self-consumed inside the pinball community in the world

[01:06:38] that I think some people feel that it's a lot larger community than what it is.

[01:06:43] And that the sales potential,

[01:06:46] there's always sales potential, but I don't think it's as big as what

[01:06:49] will achieve anytime soon.

[01:06:51] So I think 2019 could be the setup for a little bit of downfall for some companies in 2020.

[01:06:59] Absolutely.

[01:07:00] And I think what's going to happen too is there are so many good new games coming out,

[01:07:04] but people run out of room, they run out of money to buy new stuff.

[01:07:08] And no one's going to be comfortable losing like one to $2,000 with a, you know,

[01:07:13] with a resale value.

[01:07:14] And the new pinball tax, which is now on top of everything,

[01:07:18] people are going to just get content having a good lineup of games that has a lot of variety.

[01:07:24] But I think it's going to be harder and harder to get people to move games out, to move new

[01:07:28] games in. And to your point, there aren't that.

[01:07:31] I just don't believe that the hobby is growing that much where it can support all these companies.

[01:07:36] So I think we will see, I think every year, you will see like two boutiques fail

[01:07:42] who are trying to compete at the same price point of companies like Stern.

[01:07:45] I just think it's just inevitable.

[01:07:47] I think the white space is when you go up market and you make smaller,

[01:07:50] run-dude teaks for the high-end collector. No one's doing that.

[01:07:53] I think that will happen.

[01:07:55] But I think it's going to be another exciting year.

[01:07:56] And Greg, we can see you in Zack at TPL for the Twippy Awards show.

[01:08:00] What night is that in March?

[01:08:02] Saturday night. What is that?

[01:08:04] 23rd.

[01:08:06] 23rd.

[01:08:06] Is that right?

[01:08:07] Does it sound right? I think the 23rd.

[01:08:09] Yeah.

[01:08:09] Live. Twippy's live on stage.

[01:08:12] You know, and it's one of those things that, you know, it's like starting all over from last year.

[01:08:16] It's a whole new set of things to overcome with it being live and we're going to have presenters.

[01:08:23] And, you know, we're working diligently behind the scenes to, you know,

[01:08:27] try to light the thing right and try to have a nice backdrop and try to make it

[01:08:32] as nice as we can and as cool of an environment as we can so that people have fun.

[01:08:38] Like, that's what we want as people to come in, drink, have a good time, have fun,

[01:08:42] get an award, and be positive, you know?

[01:08:45] Like, this is the one thing that I think that Jeff at this weekend, Pimbal,

[01:08:50] and that we are striving for is to bring that positivity no matter what,

[01:08:55] no matter what you feel about a certain company, you feel about anything to get in there and just

[01:08:59] have fun and celebrate everybody and to let all that bullshit go and just have a good freaking

[01:09:06] night in there and award people that deserve it.

[01:09:08] Right. And is there going to be a red carpet so I can wear if I'm there some a tuxedo and then

[01:09:13] I can have a moment to dress up? We are honestly trying to set up like a, we want to do a little

[01:09:17] backdrop so that you can have a Twippy photo and stuff done. That's something that we're kind

[01:09:23] of trying to work on and see if we can't set up the logistics behind that. But yeah,

[01:09:26] do there's going to be people dress casually, there's going to be people dressed up.

[01:09:30] Like, it's going to be that kind of that mixed bag of just whatever the fuck you feel.

[01:09:34] Do it. Awesome. Awesome. And and and you're going to it's sort of similar to last year.

[01:09:38] You're going to announce like the top three finalists and then open the envelope and reveal who won.

[01:09:42] Yeah, yeah. We'll showcase. We're planning on showcasing all the pins,

[01:09:47] all the the drop down lists. So all the pins. And then when we get into the specific categories,

[01:09:54] then there will will just show the top three in that category and announce the winner.

[01:09:58] And same thing with right ends. We've won an announce all the right ends for a best podcast or

[01:10:02] all that. It'll just be the top three and then the winner. Great. Well, Greg, thank you so much for

[01:10:08] taking some time out of your Sunday morning to join Canada's pinball podcast. We really enjoyed

[01:10:14] this. We hope to get you back on soon. And and I hope to see you possibly in March as I hold up

[01:10:20] the Twippy right for best pinball podcast. Yeah, for sure, man. And on a side note before we leave,

[01:10:25] you guys check out straight down the middle and be sure to vote for straight down the middle for

[01:10:30] best YouTube show. We'd like to repeat a second win here for 2018. I'm going to announce that I

[01:10:36] did vote for you guys, even though Zach refuses to join the show. He's he's got his his things.

[01:10:43] He's got some he's playing the long he's playing the long tail on this. I got to figure it out.

[01:10:49] He's like he's like, I can't I kind of tarnished whatever he's planning. He's an enigma. He's

[01:10:54] an enigma. But like I said, you know, I go against the this stereotypical stuff, man. Like

[01:11:01] I like your show, dude. I enjoy it. So it's one of those things I'm going to go on. I don't

[01:11:06] always approve of everything with you, but I still listen to you. And I'm not going to hide that I do.

[01:11:12] So, you know, that's why I came on, man. I enjoy talking to you. Thank you, Greg. And we

[01:11:15] enjoyed having you everyone. We did a prediction show that actually has predictions. So I hope you

[01:11:20] enjoyed it. We'll be back real soon with more Canadian Spinball Podcast Greg. Have an awesome

[01:11:24] week and we'll see you in March. YouTube, brother. Thanks. All right. Later.
