[00:00] You can give it, I can take it, cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it.

[00:08] Cause I know, tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:30] I hope you had some time with the family and I hope you had some nice food.

[00:33] But we're back, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:35] I have a treat for you.

[00:36] I have someone else who worked at Deeproot Pinball, an animator in the Utah studio.

[00:42] You're gonna hear from Steven, it was a great hour long interview.

[00:45] I won't even tell you the hours it took me to edit it cause I wanna make everybody sound amazing.

[00:51] Before I do that, the Canada Club needs some thank yous because we're growing exponentially.

[00:56] We now have 477 club members.

[00:59] Thank you Michael, thank you Aaron, thank you the Pinball Room, thank you Jonathan, Bernard, and Matt, our latest members.

[01:07] If I've missed you, let me know and I will give you a shout out.

[01:11] Now as I said before, I wanna give an extra special shout out to those club members that increase their pledge amount.

[01:19] These are men that have looked at their checking account and said, you know what?

[01:24] I can actually give more than five bucks because I am that incredible in life.

[01:29] I wanna thank Tony V and I wanna thank Royal Jack for upping their pledge amounts last week.

[01:35] Thank you guys so much.

[01:36] Alright, so without further ado, you don't wanna hear me talk.

[01:39] There's no news in the Pinball world.

[01:41] You know things are really rough when we're talking about toppers and we're talking about like scoop protectors.

[01:46] I mean that's it.

[01:47] There are no new games to talk about.

[01:49] So without further ado, I wanna give you Steven from Deeproot.

[01:54] Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna welcome to the show Steven Candell, who used to work at Deeproot Studios in Utah.

[02:02] Steven, welcome to the show.

[02:03] Hey, thank you so much, Canada.

[02:05] Now Steven, let me just ask right away.

[02:07] When you hear the word Deeproot, what comes to mind?

[02:12] Just a pit in my stomach.

[02:13] It's not really anything that comes to my mind.

[02:15] More of a shiver down my back and a pit in my stomach.

[02:18] And so we talked to Jennifer, who was over in the Texas office, but you're from the Utah office.

[02:24] The animation studios, is that correct?

[02:27] That's correct.

[02:27] Now, how did you hear about Deeproot?

[02:30] How did you make your way over there?

[02:31] I was super commuting back and forth to my job at Google, technical art director at Google.

[02:36] And I was getting on the bus, one of the shuttles from one campus to the other at Google.

[02:40] And I get a phone call and I get completely cold called by an individual that works at Deeproot.

[02:45] And they're like, hey, we're looking at LinkedIn.

[02:47] We saw that you have Utah connections.

[02:48] We saw that you're in the animation industry, that you've worked at Sony and DreamWorks.

[02:52] I'd love to talk to you about a job in Utah.

[02:54] Are you available?

[02:55] I'm like, well, actually I'm working for Google, but I'm always interested in finding out more about

[03:00] jobs that are local to my home, because that'd be better.

[03:02] But that's how it all started, is just a random cold call.

[03:05] By not like a headhunter or anything, but by someone, an actual employee at Deeproot that was

[03:09] asked to make cold calls to people from the animation industry.

[03:13] Okay, so you're at Google, probably one of the most successful well-known companies.

[03:19] This local company, Deeproot, hits you up.

[03:21] How did they entice you to join them?

[03:24] Well, they were offering pretty competitive salaries, at least for the animation industry.

[03:28] Now, to be fair, Google was compensating me almost double from what I was making at DreamWorks,

[03:34] to be honest.

[03:35] So I was kind of not that interested, but honestly, I'd been at Google for almost three

[03:39] years now, and we had done pretty well.

[03:41] To be honest, we paid off our house.

[03:42] There was a lot more incentive for me to be home with my wife and my four kids.

[03:45] So I was like, that's kind of the enticement.

[03:47] So it's a local company, they hit you up.

[03:50] You were at DreamWorks, Google, and then Deeproot.

[03:53] And so, Stephen, for listener of the show, what's your skill set?

[03:57] Is it animations?

[03:59] Yeah, animation, especially with computer animation, there's a lot of disciplines within that.

[04:04] I myself, I'm called the character rigor.

[04:07] So I create the animation puppets.

[04:09] So I design and create character motion systems.

[04:12] So animators animate, and I make the puppets in which they animate in the computer, if

[04:16] that makes sense.

[04:17] In layman's terms, you create the characters?

[04:20] Yes, I create the characters, and I design all of their facial expressions and all of their

[04:24] anatomical poses and things, and allow them to be moved and manipulated by an animator.

[04:29] Now, when you met with Deeproot, did they say this was for pinball, or did they say this

[04:34] was for something else?

[04:36] On the phone call, the guy was like, okay, this is going to sound really crazy, but how

[04:40] do you feel about pinball?

[04:41] And I was like, pinball?

[04:42] I haven't played pinball in like 20 years since like 1996.

[04:47] And he's like, well, this is honestly, this is going to sound weird, but there's this,

[04:50] there's this really rich guy, he's loaded, he's got endless amounts of income, and he's

[04:55] hiring, and he wants to build an animation empire in Salt Lake City.

[04:59] I'm like, yeah, that does sound crazy.

[05:01] And that was like the pitch is there's a crazy guy with a lot of money, and he's paying

[05:05] pretty well.

[05:06] And so you said yes.

[05:07] Now, what year was this in which Deeproot hit you up?

[05:10] COVID really messed up with my year tracking.

[05:13] It's like, I think it was 2019.

[05:16] Okay.

[05:16] And how long were you a Deeproot employee?

[05:19] The phone call was in June.

[05:21] I didn't start until October of 2019.

[05:24] Okay.

[05:25] And I was there until late January of 2020.

[05:29] Okay.

[05:29] So not too long.

[05:30] Right before COVID.

[05:31] I bailed right before COVID.

[05:33] Yeah.

[05:33] And we're going to talk about all of this because I'm so curious because the Utah studio

[05:38] of Deeproot has been somewhat of an enigma.

[05:41] Like what were you guys working on in Texas?

[05:44] They were supposed to be building the physical machines.

[05:46] So what was it like you come into Deeproot?

[05:49] What was like your first month there like?

[05:51] Like what was the assignment?

[05:53] What were you working on?

[05:54] What did they give to you?

[05:56] Well, we can talk about like the interview process and stuff too if you want, but uh.

[05:59] Absolutely.

[05:59] Let's rewind.

[06:00] Let's keep rewinding, right?

[06:01] Yeah. Nobody knows anything.

[06:03] So let's talk about the interview process.

[06:05] Yeah. So um.

[06:07] Because again, I was super commuting back and forth.

[06:09] So every I'd fly home from San Francisco every Thursday afternoon.

[06:13] I went in for an interview on a Friday that I was working from home because at Google,

[06:17] I was working over there for four days and then I'd come home for Fridays and through the weekend.

[06:21] And they took me over to this building, which is about two miles from my home,

[06:25] which again, that's pretty awesome for me since I'm used to having pretty long commutes.

[06:28] It was in this kind of, you know, six floor office building.

[06:32] It's kind of a dark, dark space.

[06:34] There was about eight people, nine people working there.

[06:37] And I got interviewed by one of the many managers at the small company, many, many managers.

[06:45] They kind of just walked me through what they were working on.

[06:47] They wanted to, you know, hear about my skill set and what I'm good at.

[06:50] And they, a few of them I had actually known before.

[06:52] Actually, in fact, there was a few friends of mine that I had known in the industry

[06:55] because the animation industry, as you can imagine, is pretty small.

[06:58] And we know each other.

[06:59] So I was eager to, you know, high five a few people that I'd worked with before

[07:02] and people that in LA that I had known.

[07:04] They asked me a lot of questions and mostly they just wanted to find out how I would fit in.

[07:08] I had a lot more questions than they did, which is, you know, basically like how

[07:11] how many projects do you have going on?

[07:13] How ambitious are the projects?

[07:15] Like how well budgeted are they?

[07:17] And like how, how do they keep away from like scope creep?

[07:20] Because scope creep is kind of one of the biggest things that goes wrong in animation

[07:24] is when things are over designed, you can easily spend endless hours on any component

[07:29] of an animation film or TV show.

[07:31] And you have to know when to call it quits and when to say it's good enough.

[07:34] And also you have to more importantly design around it.

[07:36] So I had a lot of questions more about how are they going to keep these things in scope?

[07:40] And I knew nothing back then.

[07:41] Now I know a ton.

[07:42] I own eight pinball machines myself and I love pinball now and I've been kind of bitten by the bug.

[07:47] But back then I was, I had a lot of questions like, you know, how many people play these games

[07:51] and how big's the screen and do people even look at the screen?

[07:54] You know, like that kind of stuff and like what kind of animations,

[07:57] how do they differ from like film or television?

[07:59] Like are they a little bit more pizzazzi?

[08:01] You know, I kind of likened it to, I asked them, I'm like, is it like slot machine animation?

[08:05] Kind of that kind of stuff where you're kind of just glancing and it's just kind of fun.

[08:08] What did they say?

[08:09] They didn't seem to have a lot of understanding of what my questions were, to be honest.

[08:13] They didn't seem to understand their whole approach was we're making Pixar quality animations.

[08:18] And that's what they wanted me for as well.

[08:20] You know, again, I had 20 years between Sony and DreamWork and they wanted me for

[08:25] not to worry about the scope, but to worry about my facet, which is just making those characters move.

[08:29] And so you took the job though, so there must have been something that enticed you.

[08:34] Well, without getting too much into it.

[08:36] So a Google, you know, I could have stayed at Google for another 10 or 20 years, to be honest.

[08:39] There's countless people at Google still there that don't really have active projects going on.

[08:44] But it's just kind of like a retirement home for talented people.

[08:47] Right.

[08:48] At that point, my team, actually my team that I was working with at Google,

[08:50] they had recently got shifted to some other team.

[08:53] Long story short, I asked them, I'm like, you know, so am I required to join this new team?

[08:57] Or can I also look at the severance package options, which I did.

[09:00] And the second that I saw the severance package options from Google, I was like,

[09:03] yeah, I'm going to go with that.

[09:04] Okay.

[09:05] So it was mostly just like, look, I was ready to fold it at Google anyway.

[09:08] And, you know, like a career solution, 10 blocks from my home seemed like, you know,

[09:13] something worth considering.

[09:15] And honestly, they were paying really well.

[09:16] They paid almost exactly what I had was making it dreamworks, which is pretty intense.

[09:20] I mean, I don't mind mentioning this.

[09:22] Like it's about $150,000 a year.

[09:24] So 150 a year, you're close to your family and you accept the offer.

[09:29] And so what was it like?

[09:30] What was like week one at Deeproot?

[09:32] What did they ask you to work on?

[09:34] So this is what's weird.

[09:36] So I went back to work on the first day and they said, hey, we're in a different building now.

[09:40] And then like really, they're like, yeah, we're across the street.

[09:42] We're at the new mountain America building.

[09:44] And that's a, that's a pretty well known credit union, pretty established credit union here in

[09:49] Utah and probably the most expensive.

[09:51] My brother-in-law, who's actually a commercial real estate guy, he was telling me it's probably

[09:54] the most expensive real estate in the whole valley at the moment when it was first built.

[09:58] Brand new building.

[09:59] So I show up this fancy new building and they give me the quick tour and they're like, well,

[10:04] yeah, we have two floors of this building.

[10:06] I'm like, two floors.

[10:07] They're like, yeah, we're hoping to hire about 200 people.

[10:10] I'm like 200 people.

[10:12] And this is like in the first 20 minutes of when I walked in.

[10:14] I'm signing like my HR docs and all that, you know, heading over my two forms of identification,

[10:19] you know, new, new employee stuff, you know, and I'm just kind of like, what the heck, 200

[10:24] employees, like that's, that's intense.

[10:26] I'm like, over how much time they're like, well, we're going to probably be by the end of the year.

[10:30] We want to be at about 100.

[10:31] And then by this next summer, about almost 200.

[10:33] I'm like, you know, that's insane.

[10:35] Like right away, I'm like alarm bells.

[10:36] Right.

[10:37] You cannot go from a team of 40 people to 200 in a year and a half.

[10:42] And I said, well, what are we all going to be working on?

[10:44] That's a lot of work.

[10:45] They're like, well, pinballs, just the beginning.

[10:47] We're going to, you know, we're going to move into VFX.

[10:49] Robert wants us to move into animation.

[10:51] He wants us to move into video games, board games.

[10:55] I'm like, board games.

[10:56] They're like, yeah, we have a group over there in the corner that are designing board games.

[10:58] I'm like, board games.

[11:00] Yeah.

[11:01] And so, and I'm literally like, I'm literally like, kind of like, okay, like I'm text like,

[11:05] practically texting my wife on the side saying like, this is crazy.

[11:08] This is not going to work out.

[11:09] Now, who was running the Utah office?

[11:11] How many people are who?

[11:13] Who is facilitating this whole thing?

[11:15] Who is like in charge of Utah?

[11:16] Oh my gosh.

[11:17] So this is, this is again, warning, warning bells.

[11:20] No one's in charge.

[11:21] Nobody.

[11:22] Nobody.

[11:23] Not one person is in charge, but there's a board, a board of people.

[11:28] Like a board of trustees.

[11:30] No, these are a board of artists and people that they had hired.

[11:33] My coming on at Deep Root Studios was kind of like the second wave of evolution.

[11:38] There was an experiment that started at first where they, Robert came in and hired a bunch

[11:43] of the avalanche guys, right?

[11:44] We all know the story, the Disney avalanche, Disney interactive guys at avalanche studios.

[11:48] He hired a bunch of them and they were kind of, you know, mismanaged.

[11:53] I'm going to say these are really great guys, super talented artists, by the way, you know,

[11:56] without like a production manager.

[11:58] I run my own art team now at my studio and artists are not the easy, most easy to manage

[12:04] people in the world.

[12:05] So my point is back to it is that there was not one person, Robert formed a board of people,

[12:10] like a board of trustees, a board of a think tank board, right?

[12:13] A management board, everything had to get approved by the board and every little decision.

[12:18] Sure, you know, I don't know if you know this about business, but small businesses don't run

[12:22] well when there's a committee at the top of the company.

[12:26] I don't think any business runs well by committee.

[12:28] Oh my gosh.

[12:30] That's exactly right.

[12:31] So they had this committee and sure enough, I'm talking, I start talking into,

[12:35] to employees my first week and they're like, oh, the board sucks.

[12:38] It's like the board, they're always arguing.

[12:40] They're never on the same page and we never get any clear direction and they're always

[12:45] just asking Robert, you know, what they should do and Robert doesn't give any clear direction

[12:49] because Robert, you know, doesn't obviously, as you've covered many times, does not know

[12:53] how to run a business.

[12:54] He's not a business owner in the classical sense.

[12:57] Steven, not to cut you off.

[12:58] He's an insurance lawyer.

[13:01] What does he know about managing creatives?

[13:04] No, not exactly nothing.

[13:06] And that honestly was one question that I immediately had wished I had asked in my

[13:09] interview like, oh, who's running the production organization side?

[13:12] You know, we all have great ideas and we're all going to pitch them all the time because

[13:16] we're creative nuts.

[13:17] Who's the one that's kind of curating the vision for Robert?

[13:21] And there was no answer.

[13:22] There's no, there's no one.

[13:23] And there was a huge power struggles at the studio.

[13:26] So much turmoil, so much stress that I sensed it right in my first week.

[13:31] And there's people, you know, like, hey, wow, Steven, how did, you know, they got you,

[13:34] huh?

[13:34] I'm like, yeah, they're like, didn't you work at like DreamWorks and Google and Sony?

[13:38] They're like, why are you here?

[13:39] That's what a few people said the first few days.

[13:42] It's a good feeling, right?

[13:43] That's a great feeling in the belly.

[13:45] Why are you here?

[13:47] I know.

[13:48] And I said, honestly, I was pretty curious about what you guys are doing.

[13:51] And, you know, there's definitely a convenience factor.

[13:55] And I do like the idea of an animation studio starting in Utah.

[13:59] So I was hoping for the best.

[14:01] Who was on the board?

[14:02] The board was mostly just creative people.

[14:05] They had, I'm not going to name any names.

[14:07] There was a technical artist.

[14:09] There was a concept artist.

[14:11] There was an audio specialist on the board.

[14:14] There was, was that David?

[14:18] It was a David the ill.

[14:19] Come on.

[14:20] It wasn't David.

[14:21] Okay.

[14:21] It wasn't David.

[14:22] Okay.

[14:22] David's like, thank you.

[14:23] Thank you for not being me.

[14:25] So Steven, let me ask you a question.

[14:27] So you get in though.

[14:28] You these are like red flags right away.

[14:31] People are asking you like, what are you doing here?

[14:34] Which is not a good sign.

[14:35] But what are you actually working on?

[14:37] Like what's your first assignment?

[14:38] When I got in, they were wrapping up on the food truck animations, right?

[14:43] And they were all super excited about them and proud of them.

[14:46] And I thought they looked really great.

[14:47] I also saw a lot of areas for improvement.

[14:50] And they seemed a little overly cinematic.

[14:53] I'm going to say that in that they felt a little more like shots from a show or from a film

[14:58] and not so much like a, like, you know, utilizing this small screen for a pinball machine.

[15:03] Then it seemed like to fit the medium from what I understood it to be.

[15:05] And granted again, back then I was not used to pinball.

[15:08] So my first project was Merlin's arcade.

[15:10] Okay.

[15:10] So you're working on Merlin's arcade, which is a John Norris title, correct?

[15:14] Yes.

[15:15] Let me go back to food truck.

[15:16] Then we'll get to Merlin's arcade.

[15:17] So just curious.

[15:18] So are there animations to fill an entire code of food truck like out there somewhere in the world?

[15:25] Yes.

[15:25] So the game was coded, they animated it.

[15:28] And did they ever actually put the animations into the physical pinball machine that Berio designed?

[15:34] From what I understand, there was never a physical pinball machine that was designed.

[15:38] That was actually intact.

[15:40] And that actually ran the animations.

[15:42] So in Utah, you guys did not have a physical machine to then drop in the stuff you were

[15:48] animating?

[15:49] No.

[15:49] So we know, no.

[15:50] And that's obviously one of the immediate, that's one thing I learned at Google, which is,

[15:54] you know, when you're designing for a product, you really need that product and the hardware

[15:57] in right next to you.

[15:58] So you can really, you know, iteration is key to design, right?

[16:02] Right.

[16:02] And without that ability to iterate and make things improved upon your project suffers,

[16:07] because you're not able to get all the microchanges in this, because there's thousands of microchanges

[16:11] that have to happen on any project, you know?

[16:13] So how does that work?

[16:14] So like if you're designing animations for a pinball machine, you don't have the pinball

[16:19] machine, what are they giving you to animate?

[16:22] Like, is there some storyline or some color?

[16:24] So that's a great question.

[16:26] So I forgot to mention also, also the Raza animations were in the can as well, so to speak,

[16:32] meaning that they were done.

[16:33] And these were 2D animations.

[16:34] So then Food Truck was the first 3D animation, you know, pinball machine.

[16:38] Merlin's arcade was going to be the second 3D animation focus thing.

[16:42] And I got to say that the 2D animations on Raza, from what I saw, looked really fantastic.

[16:46] And they looked really clean and sharp and vibrant and bright.

[16:50] They were designed very well.

[16:51] But from what I understood is that they were extremely over budget, as far as like the amount

[16:55] of the amount of money that went into making the animations for Raza.

[16:59] Could 2D be more expensive than 3D?

[17:01] From what I've been told multiple times, in that instance, for the first animated project that

[17:05] they did at Deeproot, that Food Truck and Raza were very similar in cost.

[17:12] And that mostly is representative of the lack of organization at the studio during the creation

[17:17] of the Raza animations.

[17:19] And it's just lack of deadlines, like lack of management overall, you know, just,

[17:24] and also a leadership, you know, between Robert and I don't know how much involvement J-Pop had,

[17:28] but I'm going to speculate that between those two, without them giving like, you know,

[17:32] without them finaling shots or saying things are good enough, things just tend to creep for a long time.

[17:37] Steven, let me ask you, in your expertise, knowing this industry,

[17:41] how much money did the animations on something like Raza cost?

[17:45] Oh gosh, should cost or did cost?

[17:48] Did cost.

[17:49] And should, yeah, give us both.

[17:51] Right.

[17:53] Should cost for a 2D, like, after effects animation.

[17:57] That's what Raza was, which is basically, you know, you design concept panels and nice paintings and

[18:02] stenciled out artwork and Photoshop, and then you bring them into after effects and then animate them,

[18:07] right? That's kind of the process for that style of 2D animation.

[18:10] For a project like that, I'd probably budget it well under a million dollars,

[18:16] but from what I understood, it costs quite a bit more than that, but I can't,

[18:20] I can't remember any numbers.

[18:21] It's been two years since Deeper at this point.

[18:22] So, I mean, I don't want to just throw out BS numbers.

[18:25] Now, when you were working on something like Merlin's arcade,

[18:29] did they give you a budget or they just like go with it?

[18:32] No, so there was already like a director, an art director that was on the board,

[18:36] and I was working under him.

[18:38] He had worked at a large number of VFX studios for film over the last 15 years, I think,

[18:44] before that, and VFX to me is not a great fit for what they wanted to do at Deeproot,

[18:49] but whatever.

[18:50] And I kind of was brought on to be part of his team.

[18:53] And soon on the project, like after me working on it for two weeks,

[18:56] he promoted me to be not just in the head of the character motion rigs or like the puppets,

[19:01] but also in charge of the character design modeling,

[19:04] because I am a 3D modeler as well.

[19:05] So, I can take 2D concept designs and turn them into really great looking 3D models.

[19:09] Did you know how much the budget was?

[19:11] Like, were you just sort of making stuff?

[19:14] No, in fact, there was no budget, no deadlines.

[19:16] No, like, hey, we want this done by this and then.

[19:19] And in fact, when the budgets and deadlines did come in, they were impossible.

[19:23] So, there was no budgets or deadlines coming from Robert,

[19:27] but my director on that project had a lot of goals where he wanted to move at a fast pace,

[19:33] and he was kind of throwing out impossible goals, because there was just not a lot of scope

[19:36] direction, like a project like, again, making a 3D animated production like that and having like

[19:42] tons of props and castles and catapults and arcades, machines and knights and all these props and

[19:48] characters, it can easily just get out of hand.

[19:51] And he was just commissioning so much over modeling, like over over production,

[19:55] like too much detail in the wrong areas that would be appreciated by people playing the game.

[19:59] You know what I mean?

[20:00] So, it's just a lack of direction.

[20:02] I'm just curious for you guys, because you're animating the screen of this pinball machine.

[20:08] You've never seen the pinball machine.

[20:10] You don't even really know how much time people are going to be glancing up at the screen,

[20:15] because you don't have the game in front of you.

[20:18] Yeah.

[20:18] Was it just one big guessing game of what are we making?

[20:21] Yes, it was.

[20:22] And in fact, so they did have a few stern pinball machines and, you know,

[20:26] they had a Jersey Jack Hobbit and they had a creature from the Black Lagoon,

[20:30] Williams or Bally's and they had Batman 66.

[20:34] So, they had those there that we could play and then, you know, I kind of quickly started

[20:37] playing those during my break and after work.

[20:40] And the more I played, the more I realized I'm like, I never look at that dang screen.

[20:43] And right, especially me being a new player who's like, I, you know, laser focused on that ball.

[20:48] So, I quickly was trying to bring a lot of the limited experience that I had with those animations

[20:54] just on those games to my director saying, look, I think we're over over designing this.

[20:59] Like, we don't need to have a long, he was actually commissioned like a 35 second,

[21:05] like Robert Zemeckis long shot through like the wilderness and over the hills of grassy

[21:10] knolls and you see peasants and, you know, like a long zoom over the valleys that are coming

[21:15] up to like Merlin's arcade.

[21:17] This shot like in a VFX, this would be a very expensive shot.

[21:20] And I literally just started challenging them.

[21:22] And I didn't mean it from a negative area.

[21:24] I was just trying to be helpful.

[21:25] Like, look, this is over engineering.

[21:27] This is over creation.

[21:28] We don't need this.

[21:29] It's a pinball machine.

[21:30] You're not starting a TV show or a movie.

[21:33] Exactly. Exactly.

[21:34] And that's where he started to show his lack of understanding of the medium.

[21:39] And that's where I think my, you know, my problems began.

[21:42] There was a lot of loyalty issues.

[21:44] Robert having been Robert's a loyalty guy.

[21:46] You know this.

[21:46] Talk to me about this.

[21:47] So he had his people who were loyal to him.

[21:49] What was that like?

[21:50] I'm pretty good at kind of picking up personality tropes and like figuring out how people,

[21:55] I've met a lot of people.

[21:56] I'm 43 years old and I know a lot of people and I know what makes them tick.

[21:59] And Robert to me came across immediately as being a loyalty guy.

[22:03] Like, hey, you're, you know, you're my employee.

[22:06] I've bought you.

[22:06] You're my loyal.

[22:07] You are to be loyal to me.

[22:09] Look at his contracts and the verbiage and his work contracts and his, and it reflects that.

[22:13] So he has like these lieutenants working for him that he's kind of instilled the sphere of God in them.

[22:18] And that, that, you know, they all need to be loyal.

[22:20] They need to get on board.

[22:21] He's the leader.

[22:22] You know, this is.

[22:23] Isn't that called a Napoleon complex?

[22:25] Well, yes.

[22:26] And ironically, you know, he's not the tallest guy in the world either, either.

[22:28] So yes, very much felt like he was kind of just needed people to like, I love him and appreciate him.

[22:37] And like, not directly, but kind of like the idea of like reminding you that he is the source of your income.

[22:43] That kind of, that kind of power play.

[22:45] He has these lieutenants working for him that are just all kind of polluted by that.

[22:49] So he had his like, his inner circle, if you will.

[22:52] Did Robert ever come visit Utah and meet with your team?

[22:56] Like, what was that like?

[22:57] First time I met Robert, he apologized to me for not getting me my sign on bonus on time.

[23:03] And he was in the elevator and he's like, you're Steven.

[23:05] I'm like, yeah, he's like, you're new at deeper.

[23:07] I'm like, yeah.

[23:07] And he's like, I'm Robert.

[23:08] I'm like, oh, and I didn't recognize him from his photo because I think he was a little bit shorter than I thought he would be, to be honest.

[23:13] And, and I just didn't recognize him.

[23:15] And I'm like, oh, you're Robert, right.

[23:16] Hi, how are you doing?

[23:17] And he's like, hey, you got to tell you, I'm late on your, your sign on bonus.

[23:20] I'm so sorry.

[23:20] Doesn't that, that won't happen again.

[23:22] And I had, I had even forgotten about it.

[23:24] I was like, oh, shoot, no, I'm not a worries.

[23:26] And then so that was one time he came.

[23:27] And then he didn't really talk to anybody except the board.

[23:30] He kind of came in, talked to the board.

[23:32] Sometimes you could hear a little bit of negative things being said from the room and, you know, people being frustrated,

[23:39] grown men brought to tears, that kind of thing.

[23:40] Mostly like he'd also come.

[23:43] This is, there was this other weird thing going on, Deeproot days.

[23:46] Have you heard about the Deeproot days yet?

[23:47] Tell us about them.

[23:48] Deeproot days are like, they modeled them after what Google said.

[23:51] Google used to do this where that every Friday you could work on whatever you want.

[23:55] And that's what, that's what was happening.

[23:57] So Robert would actually come in and talk to people about their Deeproot day project.

[24:01] So, you know, Robert's like, and I think this comes through a lot on, on what we hear and what you see on the patent.

[24:07] He gets kind of patent happy.

[24:08] He's like, he loves his patents, right?

[24:11] And it's the same thing for like the Utah group wasn't giving him technology.

[24:15] They were giving him IP.

[24:17] He had a bunch of, you know, younger college guys, art guys,

[24:21] creating things for him that he could then say own because they made it during Deeproot days.

[24:26] So just because they made it at work, they don't have, you know, they don't have rights to the IP.

[24:30] And he's being, you know, he being a, an IP, you know, lawyer guy, he's super intrigued and happy to have

[24:36] all of these ideas owned by him.

[24:39] So people are pitching him on like board games, card games, toy lines, children's books.

[24:46] He schedules 20 minute meetings with all these people that want to meet with him every Friday.

[24:51] And he's meeting with them about their projects.

[24:53] And again, there's only 30 or 40 people in the building.

[24:56] And again, this, we're at the seventh floor of a building that should, should house like 150 people.

[25:02] Like we have the whole floor and it's all empty cubicles, except for one little corner where our team is.

[25:06] And I'm walking past them as they're talking about, you know, these guys designing board games and things.

[25:11] And I'm like, okay, there's 40 of us.

[25:13] And there's only like six of us working on Merlin's arcade.

[25:17] So, and on the 3D stuff, what are these other guys doing?

[25:20] And I just never found out.

[25:22] And actually shortly after I joined, there was a big layoff where a lot of the guys that were just kind of

[25:26] making things that they liked got fired.

[25:29] And there was people doing stop motion animation in a room.

[25:33] I'm not joking.

[25:33] Stop motion animation.

[25:34] Like Wallace and Gromit.

[25:36] Yeah. Like Wallace and Gromit.

[25:37] Yes. They were making Wallace and Gromit animations in a room for, for days on end.

[25:41] And I'm like, what is going on here?

[25:43] This is like some kind of like circus.

[25:44] Steven, now that it's all collapsed and we're going to go back to Merlin's arcade and more stuff,

[25:49] but do you have any access to some of this stop motion deep root stuff and stuff that was in the works?

[25:54] No, I do not.

[25:54] And in fact, I actually am very respectful of IP ownership.

[25:58] And, you know, like I don't, I'm not like a company leak when it comes to like content or anything like that.

[26:03] And well, let me ask you a question because we saw that the someone leaked all the or some of the food truck animations.

[26:10] It was one of the studios or vendors that worked on it.

[26:13] How did that happen?

[26:14] Like how did that get out?

[26:16] That's a total rewriting of that's like a gaslighting situation.

[26:19] Talk to us about it.

[26:20] There was no outsourced animation from deep root to other groups.

[26:24] It was all done in-house as deep root started to collapse certain individuals.

[26:28] Some of these lieutenants on the board wanted to distance themselves from deep root.

[26:33] So I'm going to speculate a little bit, but there's an individual that had, I think in his contract

[26:39] that he signed with Robert that it was like a project based contract.

[26:43] Because Robert doesn't have much to offer a lot of these, you know, big names coming from different industries,

[26:47] except for the fact that he doesn't have a lot of, you know, doesn't have a lot of ground to stand on.

[26:51] And he has to, he has to allure a lot of big talent.

[26:54] The way he did that was to make really unflattering contracts with individual artists

[27:00] that were actually to the detriment of deep root and a Robert in that he,

[27:03] these artists had him over a barrel when it came to the terms of their contracts,

[27:07] because their involvement was guaranteed in the project.

[27:10] As long as the project exists, these guys were guaranteed to have jobs working on it.

[27:14] So what happened was after the writing started getting written on the wall,

[27:17] this is kind of like during COVID, during, you know, we missed the Texas Pinball Festival,

[27:22] T.P.F. got canceled for us and Robert kind of dodged a bullet there.

[27:25] What happened there was the fact that Future House Studios, I think that's the name of the company,

[27:29] that was made by one of the people on the board.

[27:33] And after deep root kind of went under, this guy made his own company and he started broadcasting

[27:41] that the work that me and my team had done at deep root was under the banner of his company.

[27:46] And I kind of called them out on it, like, what is this?

[27:48] Like, we didn't work for you.

[27:49] You can't just claim that you, you know, you produced and created this,

[27:52] this stuff under a different company name.

[27:54] And I still don't quite understand how that works, but.

[27:57] So he showed Food Truck Animations as like a resume item that your team worked on.

[28:03] Yes.

[28:04] Okay. Now, Steven, let me ask you, were there animations made for Merlin's Arcade?

[28:09] Very few. In fact, they had a hard time getting that production started up until I had joined.

[28:14] There was just a lot of bottlenecks in, and my discipline is one where I, you know,

[28:18] I take the three dimensional sculpted models of the characters.

[28:21] And again, I'm the one that provides them the ability to be moved and, you know,

[28:25] to actually have joints and facial expressions.

[28:27] So I have a work ethic issue and my wife will tell you that I work long hours and I'm very,

[28:31] very dedicated to my employers.

[28:32] I was working 10 hour days making a whole pipeline character technology pipeline for deep root,

[28:38] not just to be used for Merlin's Arcade, but to be used for all of the productions,

[28:41] 3D productions for deep root.

[28:43] And that's kind of what my, that's what my talent is.

[28:45] That's what my specialty is, is making systems.

[28:47] So it's not just like you're making bespoke little characters here and there.

[28:51] You're actually, you have a system to generate many characters.

[28:54] So I'm working 10 hours a day killing myself doing this.

[28:57] And for Merlin's Arcade, I probably, you know, once I joined, I started just kind of kicking

[29:01] butt and getting a lot of those characters to the point where they could be moved and animated.

[29:05] And we got some shots out, but very few shots got out.

[29:07] So Stephen, let me ask you for listener of the show.

[29:10] Now that it's all collapsed and the SEC is about to nail this guy to the cross,

[29:14] and it is also Good Friday, ironically, that we're chatting.

[29:18] Could we see some of that?

[29:19] Could you share some of that with a listener through Canada?

[29:22] I don't know.

[29:22] I don't know if I have access to it.

[29:25] On your computer, you have nothing Merlin.

[29:27] Come on.

[29:27] No, I don't.

[29:28] In fact, that's what I was saying.

[29:29] I don't bring things home.

[29:30] Illustration sketches.

[29:32] There's got to be something.

[29:33] We'll talk after we record.

[29:34] Yeah, we can talk after.

[29:35] Maybe I can give you some leads on some stuff, but I myself don't have any on my computer.

[29:39] So Stephen, you're working on Merlin's Arcade.

[29:41] This whole thing sounds like a cluster.

[29:43] It sounds like week one.

[29:45] You saw the red flags.

[29:46] At what point were you like, I got to get out?

[29:48] No, dude, the Friday after I joined, someone says,

[29:51] well, you know, this whole thing's financed by dead people.

[29:54] I'm like, that's a quote from an employee.

[29:57] I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?

[29:59] They're like, no, this whole thing, deep root.

[30:01] Robert's legal business.

[30:02] They make money when people die.

[30:04] They short people on their life insurance.

[30:06] And I was like, this was early, early.

[30:07] I'm like, get out of here.

[30:09] No.

[30:09] They're like, yeah, that's the money pipeline he's talking about all the time.

[30:12] To get back onto the other thing about how often Robert would come down,

[30:16] he'd come down every other week, probably.

[30:19] And he would definitely be somewhat off limits to most people,

[30:22] except for when he was doing his deep root day evaluation of people's IPs that he wanted to own.

[30:27] When we did have meetings with everybody,

[30:29] it was really weird kind of like culty meetings where like,

[30:32] he's just like, are we going to make the best animations in the world?

[30:34] And he expects us to all say, yes.

[30:36] Are they going to be better than Pixar's animations?

[30:38] And everybody's just chanting, yes.

[30:40] And I'm looking around like, no.

[30:41] He wanted to be like the Steve Ballmer of this organization, you know, the Steve Jobs.

[30:46] He thought he was the next Pixar.

[30:48] Yeah, yeah, John Lasseter.

[30:49] Yeah, he won.

[30:50] Yeah.

[30:50] He's an insurance lawyer.

[30:52] Like, didn't anyone be like, dude, what do you know about any of this?

[30:56] No, yeah.

[30:56] I mean, I think a lot of people were thinking that.

[30:58] The paycheck was good.

[31:00] Paycheck was good.

[31:01] And there was also perks.

[31:02] Like, yeah, what were the perks?

[31:03] He would offer us tickets to Utah Jazz Games and his box suite.

[31:07] He'd offer us tickets to fancy plays and Broadway plays as they came in, things like that.

[31:11] There was like, I'm going to say cafeteria, but it's more like a restaurant,

[31:14] like a fancy restaurant.

[31:15] It's not a restaurant.

[31:16] It's more like a buffet commissary.

[31:18] Anyway, all of the food there was subsidized to all employees.

[31:21] So we all got 50% off.

[31:22] So we only had to pay like two or three bucks every day for lunch.

[31:26] And it was really good food.

[31:27] To his credit, like he did seem like he wanted to take care of the people that his team,

[31:32] like he seemed like he had good intentions.

[31:34] I don't like it when people start kind of branching out on his motives.

[31:39] To me, it's mostly just like you said, Napoleon Complex, a little bit egotistical,

[31:43] a little bit like overly confident in his own abilities.

[31:46] You know, delusions of grandeur, right?

[31:47] Yeah. But knowing what we know now, I get that he was pampering everybody there

[31:52] and taking care of everybody, but there's a nefarious other side of the coin in which

[31:56] he was robbing that money to give all of you guys those perks and the expensive real estate

[32:02] from people who thought they were investing in something that was not animations or pinball

[32:08] or any of that.

[32:09] Exactly. That's true. That is true.

[32:11] And I just, we just didn't know that.

[32:12] Steven, I want to talk about Raza because this was the one game that actually physically

[32:17] made its way into the world.

[32:19] What was the vibe around that game?

[32:21] Did people think it was going to get made?

[32:23] What were the expectations around how many they were going to make?

[32:26] What was it like with that title?

[32:28] So I've kind of touted many times on many pin side threads that, you know,

[32:31] I've played Raza for about five hours, you know, a lot of, I played a lot of Raza because we had

[32:35] a game there. We had a Raza machine there that did work and it did start up.

[32:38] It did keep score.

[32:39] The pin bar up front worked as well.

[32:41] You sound surprised by all this. It's funny. It's like millions of dollars and you're like,

[32:46] you're like, the game actually turned on and kept score.

[32:48] Like this is like, we're taking credit for this, but it's kind of funny.

[32:51] But you've played Raza more than most people on planet earth will ever play it.

[32:55] So what was it like?

[32:56] It had potential. It felt fun.

[32:59] Like I said earlier, the animations were one of the best parts about it.

[33:02] Like they seemed really vibrant and colorful.

[33:04] They just looked really rich and the screens looked really nice as well.

[33:07] Like Raza displays really well.

[33:09] The art on it was, I thought was nice and the game itself, you know, had a lot of brutal shots

[33:14] and it had a lot of like clunky, like, you know, it's kind of like Ninja Turtles in a way.

[33:17] Like, and I own Ninja Turtles and I love it, but it had a lot of kind of just like brick

[33:21] shots, you know, like just a lot of like the ends of, of lanes pointed at you and, you know,

[33:26] you hit them and you're just the ball just kind of drains right away.

[33:29] And so it didn't really feel like it was that great for like a family, you know,

[33:33] which I also say Ninja Turtles isn't great for a family either, you know, even though it should be.

[33:37] And we're going to talk a little bit about turtles because you did some great animations for that.

[33:40] But before we go there, so Raza makes its way to the Houston show.

[33:45] Were you there when they finally brought it out to the world and sort of let people go at it?

[33:51] No, I actually, I left Deeproot because of something that had to do with the Houston show.

[33:57] So why'd you leave?

[33:58] Is the Houston show the same as TPF?

[33:59] No.

[34:01] Stephen, I should edit that out, but I'm not.

[34:04] No, that's fine. I just can't remember.

[34:06] I think Houston was right before Expo.

[34:08] Right. Houston was in like the fall.

[34:10] Yeah. It was like September it was or something.

[34:13] Yeah. I was at the company during that time and that was exciting.

[34:17] There was a lot of people there that were happy that the game was getting out there and that people

[34:20] were getting a small preview of it.

[34:22] But the promises that were made for the upcoming TPF were just not coming to fruition.

[34:27] That was the big launch promise.

[34:29] The big launch promise and because Robert came and he kind of talked to us about what his goals

[34:32] were for the company.

[34:33] I felt like I had a pretty good grasp of what he was trying to achieve.

[34:36] And I'm seeing all of this art and design being designed for his machines.

[34:40] And I'm thinking, man, I hope this stuff sees the light of day because this artwork is really great.

[34:43] Again, the Utah team is talented.

[34:45] So during one of my lunch breaks, and I don't really want to get into this that much,

[34:49] but it's kind of more specific to me than the company.

[34:51] But you guys might find this interesting.

[34:53] I take a break. I'm writing code all day on these procedural character building systems.

[34:57] And I take a break and I'm like, I'm going to design like a booth on what a booth should look

[35:01] like for Merlin's because Robert was saying that we were just going to show for TPF.

[35:05] We were just going to show the Graza again.

[35:07] And I wanted to say, dude, just get some banners printed up of the artwork for these machines

[35:11] that you have coming up because artwork can really hit people on an emotional level.

[35:16] Like it's like, wow, that stuff looks great.

[35:17] You know, even if it's just a bunch of banners or posters, it can be pretty convincing that

[35:21] there's cool things to wait for at Deep Group Pimble.

[35:24] So I quickly just, I literally downloaded like a template for like a,

[35:27] like a booth template for like design.

[35:29] And I'm good at Photoshop.

[35:30] So I just kind of took in a lot of our, our arts for Merlin's.

[35:34] And I started just kind of fitting it into there.

[35:36] And I sent it to Robert and Slack and he's pretty available.

[35:38] Like on Slack, I sent it to him.

[35:40] I also kind of printed out like 3D grayscale muckets of the characters that we had sculpted.

[35:44] Because, you know, we're doing 3D animation.

[35:46] One of the best things about 3D animation is that it's tangible.

[35:49] You can actually print it, you know, you can actually turn table it and put on a turn table,

[35:54] see all the sides of it.

[35:55] And I thought, hey, if I was a fan for Pimble, I would love to see some of the art in a different

[35:59] manner than other companies provide.

[36:00] So anyway, I made this whole pitch on what our booth could look like.

[36:04] I sent it to Robert.

[36:05] He loves it.

[36:06] He's just like, this is great.

[36:07] This is fantastic.

[36:08] When did you do this?

[36:08] I'm like, I just took an hour doing this.

[36:10] It took like five seconds.

[36:11] It's just a mockup.

[36:12] So next thing I know, I get these two guys at the deeper studios, these two guys are on the board.

[36:17] They come over to my cubicle and they're like, hey, we need to talk.

[36:20] I'm like, what?

[36:21] They're like coming to my office.

[36:22] So I get pulled into their office and they just start kind of saying how disappointed they are

[36:27] that I would go behind their backs on showing Robert something that he would like.

[36:32] They just want me to apologize.

[36:33] They want me to, they're like, why are you wasting your time on this stuff?

[36:36] You should be, shouldn't you be working on our character systems?

[36:39] I just lose it.

[36:40] I'm like, dude, I've been here like for two months, I put in 50 to 60 hours a week

[36:45] and everybody else at this company is leaving by two o'clock every day.

[36:48] And I just, I'm like, I quit.

[36:50] I quit there on the spot and I walked out.

[36:51] Wow.

[36:52] That was it.

[36:53] That was it.

[36:53] You clowns are sharing board games with him leaving at two.

[36:56] Yes.

[36:57] And here I am trying to help.

[36:58] Yes, exactly.

[36:59] I was just trying to help and you know, you can, you can challenge a lot of things about me,

[37:03] but don't challenge like my work ethic or what I'm working on.

[37:06] And I just found that really disrespectful.

[37:08] And so what actually what I did is I went to back to my desk and I printed an hour by hour

[37:14] estimate what I had spent every single hour that I had done since I walked in the door at

[37:18] Deeproot and what I had built and here the codes and the files that I had created for them

[37:22] and the assets, the 3d assets, the 3d characters.

[37:24] And I printed it up, stapled it.

[37:26] It was more than one page and I slammed it on their desk and I said, I quit and I walked out.

[37:30] That's what happened.

[37:31] Wow.

[37:32] And Steven, do you have an image of this booth?

[37:35] I would love to see this thing.

[37:36] This is great.

[37:37] That I might, I might have that.

[37:39] I might have that on the phone.

[37:40] I can look.

[37:41] Yeah.

[37:41] We're going to get that because at the next TPF,

[37:43] Kanada is going to podcast live from what would have been Deeproot's Merlin Arcade booth.

[37:51] So Steven, I will finance the creation of this thing.

[37:54] So you quit on the spot.

[37:56] Let me ask you a question because one of the things that always comes up is that who knew

[38:01] that manufacturing wasn't even close?

[38:04] Like you guys were designing stuff.

[38:06] That wasn't your purview.

[38:07] Was there any like inclinations for you guys in Utah that like, you know what,

[38:11] they can't even make these games.

[38:13] Like what was the reporting back to Utah?

[38:16] Like the games aren't made.

[38:18] We're making these animations.

[38:20] Obviously you can't sync the two together if the physical product's not ready.

[38:24] It was mostly blamed on part issues.

[38:26] I remember early on there was a lot of talk about part supplies, chains being issued.

[38:30] Robert had a conspiracy theory that CERN was intentionally buying up a lot of parts to prevent

[38:34] him from making machines.

[38:36] Did he really have that?

[38:37] He's like George Gomez is trying to sabotage this.

[38:39] No, that was, yeah.

[38:40] He, there's again, he's the center of his own universe.

[38:42] So there's a lot of like, like this has happened because of this and that.

[38:46] We've seen people like Steve Bowden and Quinn go on all these podcasts, right?

[38:50] Telling people, get ready, get ready.

[38:53] Were they lying to us or they were just sort of selling the sizzle?

[38:57] What do you think about that behavior?

[38:59] It doesn't, it doesn't add up.

[39:02] And I think that's what kind of brings people like you and other podcasters or YouTube personalities

[39:08] to, you know, they keep bringing it up.

[39:09] And I think it's because there's something about it that just doesn't add up.

[39:12] Like you would think that J-pop and Steve Bowden and what's his name who does, you know,

[39:18] who left early on.

[39:18] Dennis Norman.

[39:20] Dennis Norman.

[39:21] You would think that they've seen how this stuff works and they see what like all of the

[39:25] disciplines that are required to create the machines.

[39:28] You would think that the lack of production effort or progress would have been a big red flag to them.

[39:35] And I don't, I don't know them and I haven't really talked to them, but I don't understand.

[39:38] That's what doesn't add up to all of us.

[39:40] It's like, well, okay, you guys are designing games and you're working on flow and you're

[39:43] working on contraptions and mechanics and just having fun with that whole side.

[39:47] But there's not anybody there to like head up the production and manufacturing of the actual,

[39:53] like how you do it at scale.

[39:55] Right.

[39:55] Who's the scale guy?

[39:57] I don't know.

[39:57] I don't think they ever had a scale guy.

[39:59] Who's the line manager?

[40:00] Who's the line manager?

[40:01] Yeah.

[40:02] There was no line.

[40:02] When Kiri Hardy went into their room where they were supposed to be manufacturing,

[40:06] he said it was empty, empty.

[40:08] The Deeper Studios board had gone down to Utah and we're showing a lot of the Whitewood games.

[40:14] And they came back and reported that the Whitewoods look fun and they look good.

[40:18] And it was going to be exciting to see the animations paired to them,

[40:21] but none of them ever talked about any kind of production solution in place.

[40:25] It's so weird.

[40:25] There was such a disconnect.

[40:27] So let's talk about Goonies.

[40:28] This was his big theme, right?

[40:30] In a world of unlicensed themes like food truck, the Goonies, like,

[40:34] did he have the full license for Goonies?

[40:36] Yeah, he had the full license for Goonies.

[40:38] I think there was one of the cast of actors that wasn't,

[40:41] whether likeness wasn't approved.

[40:43] Wasn't it Chunk?

[40:44] It was either Mouth or Chunk.

[40:45] I can't remember.

[40:45] Okay.

[40:46] It was one or the other.

[40:47] And I think it was Chunk, but I might be wrong.

[40:50] When I was there, they were working on the Whitewood,

[40:52] but the artwork was not, had not even commenced by the time I left.

[40:55] But I do know that they put a mad sprint on it.

[40:57] I think Robert put all of his chips on Goonies when it came to wanting to show progress of other games

[41:02] to help entice further investment.

[41:04] But who's investing in this?

[41:05] Like, what was he showing people?

[41:07] Raza?

[41:07] I don't know.

[41:08] I don't know.

[41:09] When I say investment, I don't, that's a great question.

[41:12] Well, it's clear now, because like Steven, like now it's clear that I think he was telling the

[41:16] employees one thing, but we all know now where the money was coming from.

[41:19] And it wasn't like he was showing them these five Whitewoods.

[41:22] He was selling them on the 575 Deeproot fund.

[41:26] Yes, exactly.

[41:27] And it was not meant to go to this.

[41:29] On that note, so there was a time in November of 2019 that Robert called us all in.

[41:35] He was there, you know, in Utah at the studio and he says,

[41:38] so my loser partners have backed out of what we're doing here.

[41:43] Even though they told me that they were committed to seeing this through, they no longer are.

[41:47] They're pulling out.

[41:48] So I need to find a different way to finance these games.

[41:51] And this was in 2019, November.

[41:53] So he tells us right away that he says that we've been cut off from the money pipeline.

[41:57] So I need to find a different way to swing all of this, but don't worry guys, it'll be fine.

[42:01] You know, that kind of stuff.

[42:02] That was the beginning of the end.

[42:04] That's when after that there was forced furloughs and late paychecks and stuff.

[42:09] And I have patients for one late paycheck.

[42:11] And then after that was when I left.

[42:12] You now have been bitten by the pinball bug.

[42:15] You've worked on a Ninja Turtle animations.

[42:17] We're going to talk about that.

[42:19] When you see the collapse of Deeproot and you see the pinball community,

[42:24] do you fear that this community is susceptible to this happening over and over again?

[42:30] Before I hopped on this podcast, I looked back at all of my pinside comments

[42:34] in the Deeproot thread because I was the first one that started saying stuff on the pinside thread.

[42:37] People were being very, very gracious with the excuses on what could possibly be the hold up

[42:44] for Robert Mueller and Deeproot to the point where people are just completely fantasizing

[42:49] scenarios that are just complete BS.

[42:52] This is not based on anything that Robert was saying.

[42:54] This is just the average person on pinside's ability to kind of fill in the gaps with positivity.

[43:00] And I got in trouble.

[43:01] I started kind of coming out saying like, look, you guys are talking about Robert and his endless

[43:05] amounts of money. This is the post that I actually had to, I got a cease and desist by Robert from.

[43:11] I said, look, you guys are talking about his endless amounts of cash, but that doesn't line up

[43:15] with the force furloughs and mispay checks that me and my team have been experiencing.

[43:19] That's what I said on pinside.

[43:20] And then I got a cease and desist the next day.

[43:23] From Robert.

[43:24] From Robert, from his lawyer.

[43:26] That was the first of three cease and desists that I've gotten from Robert.

[43:28] And Robert's lawyer is invested in Deeproot, by the way.

[43:31] I'm sure I'm not surprised.

[43:33] I mean, well, they're not sending cease and desist now because they've all lost.

[43:37] It's over.

[43:38] So yeah, I said, uh, the last, the cease and desist he sent me, I said,

[43:42] just Robert, write these up and you just pass them along or do you,

[43:44] are you writing each one individually?

[43:46] You know, and I want to stay on this because this blind optimism, right?

[43:51] This desire to sort of fantasize that every single pinball venture has to work out because

[43:56] it's pinball.

[43:57] And we're seeing it again in Haggis pinball where they're a year late.

[44:01] Every day you go by where you're not making games, you're burning capital.

[44:05] And yet it's the same story again.

[44:07] It's like nobody wants to just admit that these pinball ventures can fail.

[44:11] The thing is, like there's people out there that are providing information and then you get labeled

[44:15] as some kind of like naysayer or hater and you're actually just providing facts to the situation.

[44:22] When she started providing those facts, people start getting really defensive

[44:26] and start defending these losers.

[44:27] And why do you think that is?

[44:29] I don't know.

[44:30] I think because they think, you know, because there's so many trolls online,

[44:32] I think they just think everybody's a troll.

[44:35] And I kept trying to clarify my position on pin side is like, look guys, I don't need this job.

[44:39] There was somebody that sent me all this hate mail on pin side, you know, in the private messages

[44:43] saying, even if you look at my Ninja Turtle animation mod thread, there's someone that jumps

[44:48] in there saying, Hey, I remember you from the deep root situation.

[44:51] Would you one of those like burned people that was just bitter at your employer and was,

[44:55] I'm like, I literally lost way less money than than many of the people at deep root.

[44:59] And honestly, like again, I've had a very successful career.

[45:03] I own my own home.

[45:04] I'm totally financially independent at this point.

[45:07] I'm not just out there commenting on this guy's business because I felt burned or wronged.

[45:12] I was literally doing it to try to be helpful to people that were seemingly,

[45:16] seemingly looking like they were going to throw bad money at a bad idea.

[45:19] First, congratulations on being debt free.

[45:22] It sounds like in a good place.

[45:24] I feel like Dave Ramsey right now being like, you did it.

[45:27] You did it.

[45:27] You did it.

[45:28] No, congratulations on all of that.

[45:29] And I want to say like, I saw you in the pin side thread.

[45:32] What's your pin side handle by the way?

[45:34] It's Scandal, Steven Candell, Scandal.

[45:37] Okay, Scandal.

[45:38] And I just want to say like, we need more people like you and less people who work at a company

[45:44] like deep root.

[45:46] And I'm just going to say it like Steve Bowden and the guys that just said nothing,

[45:50] wanted to even all end it, never apologize for, for bringing people into the mix and getting

[45:56] people to invest in the company.

[45:57] We need more, I hate to say it, like whistleblowers at times who can help us make better decisions.

[46:04] This is pinball people.

[46:06] We're not whistleblowing on like nuclear bombs being launched into the world.

[46:11] We're just trying to save you from making mistakes.

[46:13] Exactly.

[46:14] Even after the writing was on the wall, there's still like these fantasy minded people.

[46:18] Like what's that one guy in the family?

[46:20] Great witch John who's trying to like make the game.

[46:22] Oh my gosh, you can see my arguments with him in there.

[46:25] He's just talking about, hey, I have a lead and he's talking to all these really like half

[46:29] truths like and kind of like a, hey, I can't say too much, but trust me guys, there's a team of

[46:34] people that are in place going to pick up the pieces from deep root.

[46:38] We're there and we got this thumbs up.

[46:40] And everybody's like, yeah.

[46:42] And I'm like, what the hell is that?

[46:44] Steven, let me ask you a question.

[46:45] I know you left pretty abruptly.

[46:47] If you could say something to Robert Mueller today, what would you say knowing what you know now?

[46:57] I would say that there, I hope he knows that he probably could have pulled this off

[47:03] if he had hired a competent team, even as illegal and as bad a practice as all of this was.

[47:08] I think he actually probably could have pulled it off had he spent his money in a wise way

[47:15] and didn't try to do everything so ambitiously.

[47:19] And it's hard for me to say that because I know all of the ethical issues with all of the money

[47:22] he was stealing.

[47:23] I'm not talking about that.

[47:24] That's obviously wrong, but I just want him to know that I think there was actually a way

[47:28] forward where he could have actually hit his goals as unethically as that was.

[47:33] It's, I think it's due to his lack of experience and his lack of trust of others that prevented

[47:39] him from actually progressing on the titles that he wanted to progress.

[47:43] Raza should have been a slam dunk out the door in a year.

[47:47] It's only himself that is to blame for that.

[47:50] And I hope he knows that.

[47:51] The people that bought these Raza prototypes at the auction,

[47:56] do you think there's any way to get those working?

[47:58] Is that possible for those people?

[48:00] That's a great question.

[48:03] Who's got the code?

[48:04] Yeah, I was just going to mention that.

[48:06] So, you know, we did have working code up here and there are, there might be people that you

[48:10] could reach out to.

[48:11] There was a whole unity team of developers up here as well as the, you know, our art team

[48:16] and production animation team.

[48:18] And they were designing the actual UX and the actual interface for the pin bar itself,

[48:23] you know, actually getting that pin bar functioning and working on all the menus that the pin bar

[48:27] had in itself as well was all handled up here at Salt Lake City.

[48:31] As far as like the code, I don't know.

[48:33] I imagine that was all done in Texas, so I can't speak to it.

[48:36] It still blows my mind when you talk about this.

[48:39] You guys are doing the pin bar animations and all the stuff around that, and you didn't even

[48:44] have a physical game there.

[48:45] Well, we had one Raza, but it wasn't, we had one Raza.

[48:48] Who took that?

[48:49] Where is that Raza now?

[48:51] That's a great question.

[48:52] In fact, there's a lot of equipment from the Utah studios that didn't show up at auction

[48:56] that should have, in my opinion.

[48:57] There was a whole render farm of computers of, you know, $10,000 machines, and I'm talking

[49:01] probably about 20 or 30 of them that just didn't end up anywhere.

[49:05] Well, none of the Utah stuff was in the auction.

[49:07] Yeah, what's up with that?

[49:08] Yeah, now the plot thickens.

[49:10] Canada bought it all for $50.

[49:12] I imagine that Raza machine is still in the state of Utah.

[49:15] Okay, let's find it together.

[49:16] Can we do that?

[49:17] I think we should.

[49:18] All right, offline, even though I just told all of you what we're going to do.

[49:21] Yeah, we log in some vacation days from our employers, and I am my own employer, but we go

[49:27] on an actual video scavenger hunt of this kind of thing.

[49:30] Let's call them deep root days.

[49:31] How's that sound?

[49:33] Steven, let me ask you a question.

[49:34] You've worked after deep root.

[49:36] You worked on animations for Ninja Turtles for Stern, correct?

[49:39] It was for a Stern machine, but I made the first of its kind animation mod for a pinball machine.

[49:47] That's my own claim, I think.

[49:48] All right, talk to me about that.

[49:50] Right, so I bought Ninja Turtles because I love the theme, even though I know you hate it and you

[49:53] think it's childish, which I think is ironic.

[49:55] I don't hate it.

[49:56] It's just like I'm 45, man.

[49:58] I saw photos of your bedroom from 10 years ago, and it looked pretty childish myself.

[50:02] The bedsheets.

[50:03] The bedsheets.

[50:04] They were Ninja Turtle bedsheets.

[50:06] I know, that's what I'm saying.

[50:07] And then you're calling Ninja Turtles a childish theme.

[50:11] It's fun.

[50:11] Well, that tastes changed, is the bottom line.

[50:13] And I always speculated that it was your wife that thought it might be more childish than you,

[50:17] but maybe I'm wrong.

[50:18] I mean, I didn't have a wife at the time, but yes.

[50:21] I did it for the shock factor.

[50:23] That's why I did it.

[50:26] Well, yeah, Ninja Turtles, the game, the art, man, I think it's probably one of the best

[50:31] looking pinball machines at location.

[50:34] And, you know, it's just gorgeous.

[50:35] Like the colors are vibrant.

[50:37] The back glasses are awesome.

[50:38] The playfield art is fantastic.

[50:40] And the animations were ambitious, but I thought I felt like they felt flat.

[50:44] And I'm a child of the 80s, and I had a hard crush on April O'Neill because she was awesome.

[50:48] And when I saw the game, April just looked like some kind of withered old grayed out hag in the

[50:53] in the stern version.

[50:54] No offense.

[50:54] I'm sorry, but it's just true.

[50:56] She looked awful.

[50:57] And her call outs in the game are so awesome and vibrant and exciting.

[51:00] And she has this really crisp, upbeat voice and the fact that she's like a news anchor,

[51:05] like an on the scene journalist.

[51:06] I thought she should have been the main host to the game.

[51:10] Like she should have been like the on on the scene correspondent that's like telling you your

[51:15] score, telling you what you're doing.

[51:16] And then, you know, you can have cool cutscenes to the turtles, but have her be there as the

[51:21] welcome to the game kind of commentator, you know, like in a sporting event, you know,

[51:25] you have like, you know, newscaster.

[51:27] Yeah, that was my take on it.

[51:28] So I started.

[51:29] Wait, so how does this work?

[51:30] So like, are you rewriting the code with animation?

[51:33] Well, no, I'm not rewriting the code.

[51:35] So it's very similar to like, you know, the Jurassic Park film, you know, mod,

[51:38] instead of doing the game animations that Stern made, you can upload shots from Jurassic Park.

[51:42] When she appears, you, you appear with your better animations.

[51:45] I started making remaking footage of my own to replace the stern footage with.

[51:50] I found a lot of opportunities that didn't feature April.

[51:53] I got rid of that footage and then put her April again.

[51:55] I mean, as much April focus as I could, like the ball lock shots were just stupid.

[51:59] It was like the turtles walking into the restaurant.

[52:01] Like they were like bored out of their mind, just these weird stuff.

[52:03] So I started replacing all these animations with April looking really cute and kind of

[52:08] just happy perky person, putting her really large on the screen too.

[52:11] So they were, you know, because I felt like the compositions were really odd in the,

[52:15] in those animations too.

[52:16] But anyway, just, just tried to make it April focused.

[52:18] I had someone on Pinside Caleb.

[52:21] His name is he started helping me with the actual code integration.

[52:25] So I just sent him updates to my shots.

[52:28] He'd integrate them in.

[52:29] He'd send the code back to me and he kind of handled that whole side of it,

[52:32] which was fantastic of him.

[52:33] And it's been really well received.

[52:35] And the fact I still get, I get pinged about five times a week with people that want the code.

[52:39] Cause I don't just release it.

[52:40] I kind of ask people to reach out to me and I'll give it to you, you know, right for free.

[52:44] It's for free.

[52:44] Yes, it's free, but I also ask, I ask for donations because I probably,

[52:48] I probably spent about three grand on making it because I don't animate.

[52:51] I don't make things move.

[52:52] I just make the characters and I know it's a weird distinction and people have a hard time

[52:55] wrapping their head around that with 3D animation, but

[52:57] I don't believe in asking for donations.

[53:00] I've never asked for people to pay for this podcast or pay for me to do Facebook live.

[53:05] Now, absolutely you should be paid for your hard work and making this game more interesting.

[53:10] Yeah.

[53:10] And I, and I, I don't, I know, I don't own the IP.

[53:12] I don't have a license or anything like that.

[53:14] And I, I do try to obey that kind of stuff as much as I can,

[53:17] but basically we're just asking for coffee money.

[53:19] Yeah.

[53:19] You know, I've had over 350 downloads, which is pretty fantastic for the, for the mod.

[53:24] And I think it's on a large percentage of starting games at this point because people,

[53:28] they like it.

[53:29] So Steven, if someone listening to this would like to get in touch with you, what's the best way?

[53:34] For the mod?

[53:35] Yeah.

[53:35] For the mod or for anything, you know, but for the mod.

[53:37] I'm pin side through, I'm Scandal.

[53:40] Yeah.

[53:40] But like not everybody's on pin side, me included.

[53:42] I'm banned.

[53:43] What's the other way to get in touch with you?

[53:45] Well, you can reach out to me at my animation studio.

[53:47] So I own a company called studiosubio.com and you can go and you can write to me,

[53:52] Scandal at studio, studio, STU, DIO, ZU, BIO.com.

[53:57] Studio Zubio.

[53:58] Mm-hmm.

[53:59] What's the Zubio?

[54:00] It's just a fun word.

[54:01] I'm kind of, I'm a phonetic guy.

[54:02] I think I thought it sounded fun.

[54:04] We're working on our own television series and we're also doing a lot of client based

[54:08] work for the tech industry.

[54:10] I have a lot of contacts at Facebook, Google and Snapchat and stuff.

[54:12] So we do a lot of custom animations for.

[54:15] Awesome.

[54:15] For them.

[54:16] Yeah.

[54:16] Steven, I want to thank you so much.

[54:18] We're on the hour and this has been a really fun.

[54:22] And you and I have been talking for I think like two, three years now.

[54:25] Like we've been connecting over deep root for a while.

[54:28] So it's been such a pleasure to get you on the show and talk in a way in which we're

[54:32] both not afraid of getting sued by Robert Mueller.

[54:35] So thank you.

[54:38] Yeah.

[54:38] I'm not afraid of Robert and there's a lot of young college students that, you know,

[54:42] artists here in Utah that are very afraid of him and he definitely kind of took advantage

[54:46] of that.

[54:46] But I thank you so much.

[54:47] I really appreciate your podcast.

[54:49] I appreciate what you do for the community.

[54:52] And I think, you know, your subscriber numbers have just been soaring.

[54:56] And I think that's because of the fact that you're undeniably entertaining and

[55:00] informative on what's happening in Pinball and you're, I think, essential.

[55:03] So thank you.

[55:04] Well, I thank you for that.

[55:05] I did not put them up to that.

[55:07] And we've sold more Canada subscriptions than Raza.

[55:10] So I.

[55:11] Yeah, exactly.

[55:12] I've made more money on my April or Neil animations than Robert did on his Pinball adventure.

[55:16] Yeah, it's amazing.

[55:18] Well, Steven, thank you so much.

[55:20] And I do hope to share some of what you have from the Deeproot days with the club members

[55:24] so we can talk offline about getting some of that fun stuff out the door and always a pleasure.

[55:29] And I want to thank you for being someone who hasn't been shy.

[55:33] You've been someone who has, you know, when you see something, you say something.

[55:37] And I really do appreciate that because I think way too many people are sort of not looking out

[55:41] for the community.

[55:42] And you've been one of the few who was behind the doors over at Deeproot and you've been saying,

[55:48] hey, maybe all is not well in Rome and you should watch out.

[55:53] So thank you for that.

[55:54] I wouldn't say it's like Rome.

[55:55] I'd say it's more like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

[55:57] But yeah, that's.

[55:57] Oh, yeah.

[55:58] No, good, good call.

[56:00] Well, Steven, thank you so much, man, and have a great day.

[56:03] Thanks.

[56:03] See you.
