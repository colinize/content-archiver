[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Happy Friday!

[00:19] I'm staring at people on Facebook right now.

[00:21] Hopefully they're all club members because they're going to get a chance to hear this

[00:25] incredible episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast on this podcast.

[00:29] We're going to talk about Metallica LE.

[00:32] We're going to talk about how I'm going to give one person out there a chance to get

[00:36] one at MSRP.

[00:38] And I'm going to tell you the money I've been offered for that spot and it's going to blow

[00:45] people away.

[00:46] We're going to talk about Spooky Pinball.

[00:48] The quality of these games.

[00:51] Is it going to get better as we head to their next title?

[00:54] We're going to talk about X-Men LE and X-Men in general.

[00:59] Is this game starting to lose some of its momentum?

[01:02] Are people getting a little bit tired of the auto plunger?

[01:06] We're going to talk about Back to the Future.

[01:09] Who's making this game, right?

[01:11] Dutch Pinball at 10 games a week?

[01:14] They can't possibly be making this game.

[01:17] The demand would be through the roof.

[01:19] I'm going to tell you who I want to make the game with them and I think it's the smart

[01:23] move to make and stuff's been happening.

[01:26] We'll just say that.

[01:27] I also have a new Stern machine rumor.

[01:31] I have a theme nobody's been talking about and I'm going to let my Kaneda Club members

[01:37] hear it first.

[01:38] All right.

[01:39] What else is going on in Pinball?

[01:40] And let's just cover off on the end of the year.

[01:44] What we think is going to happen, right?

[01:45] A lot is around the corner.

[01:47] We've got Spike 3 coming.

[01:49] Our Metallica LE owner is going to be a little bit disappointed that that game is not on

[01:54] the new platform.

[01:56] We're going to talk about what else?

[01:58] Harry Potter?

[02:00] Is Jersey Jack finally going to put toys back into the game?

[02:04] I want to talk about Avatar people because I've been calling around different distros

[02:09] and they say it's selling worse than Elton John.

[02:13] And who's buying the LEs for 12?

[02:16] I mean, if you buy an LE for 12, you really do need to have your head examined.

[02:20] And that's an unintelligent move if there ever was one.

[02:24] What is not unintelligent is if we think Marty Robbins knew all too well.

[02:30] When he was shilling those centaurs and I know Jeff Teolis were all left heads because

[02:35] we saw the forest for the trees and insult us all you want.

[02:40] But now everybody knows where you stand.

[02:43] We know where Neil McCrae stands.

[02:47] Marty's best pen pal for some reason.

[02:49] If Neil put as much effort into taking care of other things in life and stop arguing and

[02:56] fighting everybody who is actually seeing things for how they are, I think he'd be in

[03:01] a better place.

[03:02] And I don't care how much money these guys have.

[03:04] It doesn't matter.

[03:05] It's all about the principle.

[03:06] It's about values.

[03:07] It doesn't matter how rich you are.

[03:09] It doesn't make your words any more correct.

[03:12] And we're not even going to talk about Haggis because they're done and no one's going to

[03:15] see a penny.

[03:16] And we all know that Marty Robbins is never, I mean is he is never going to be welcomed

[03:22] back into this hobby.

[03:24] It doesn't matter what he says or what he does unless he gets people their money back.

[03:29] That's the only way he's ever going to be welcomed back into pinball.

[03:33] All right.

[03:34] So we're going to cover off on all of that right now.

[03:37] If you're on Facebook, sign up for the Canada Club.

[03:41] It's only $5 a month, right?

[03:44] Other shows are at $10.

[03:46] $100.

[03:47] People are giving other shows for polo shirts.

[03:49] I know Zach, has anyone got the polo shirt yet?

[03:52] I don't know.

[03:53] We have some $100 subscribers, but not most.

[03:56] Most of my subscribers are at $5 a month.

[03:59] So I'm going to let Facebook go and we're going to get this show going right now.

[04:03] Bye guys.

[04:04] All right.

[04:05] So let's talk about all this stuff.

[04:06] Let's start with Metallica Ellie giveaway.

[04:09] There are like 47 people on that list and everyone who's on that list, you followed

[04:16] the rules.

[04:17] You got me what I asked for.

[04:19] I asked for your name.

[04:20] I asked if you liked Metallica.

[04:22] Everybody seems to like Metallica and I asked for your phone number.

[04:26] And so all of you provided that and that is how you're on the list.

[04:30] If you did not do that, you are not on the list.

[04:33] I'm sorry.

[04:34] We had to do it this way.

[04:36] And it took me a long time to respond to everybody and write your names out and I got to print

[04:41] it with your phone numbers.

[04:43] And so we are going to draw a winner at 11am Eastern Standard Time tomorrow during the

[04:48] Saturday morning spectacular.

[04:50] And I want to see more, more of these distributors and these companies do stuff like this when

[04:56] they have a hot product.

[04:58] And I think it's a really fair thing to do.

[05:01] The other thing I've been telling George and Seth over at Stern, they should have done

[05:05] something where original Metallica, Ellie owners who still own the game after 12 years,

[05:13] it means that you had to have bought the game when it came out.

[05:17] You love Metallica and you've held on to the game for 12 years.

[05:22] Those gentlemen should have been given first dibs at the new game.

[05:27] Nobody would have said that was unfair.

[05:30] Nobody would have complained and it would have just been the right thing to do.

[05:33] And here's the thing.

[05:34] I want to start turning this channel and I heard a lot of your feedback.

[05:38] I want to start being a voice for doing what's right.

[05:41] I think I'm normally there, but yeah, every once in a while it would be nice to scalp

[05:47] a game for some money.

[05:49] It's funny to me because distributors are basically scalpers for the most part.

[05:54] I mean, think about it.

[05:55] A distributor gets $2,000 on every LE.

[05:59] How many of those LEs actually require like maintenance and upkeep?

[06:03] And is it a lot of hard work?

[06:06] You sell 10 LEs and that's $20,000 you make in one day and I get it.

[06:12] They get stuck with the inventory they don't want, but man, Canada does like a thousand

[06:17] pinball podcasts.

[06:18] I try to make a buck and everybody comes at me with the pitchforks.

[06:22] Okay, so I'm going to do the right thing.

[06:24] I'm excited to see who wins.

[06:25] It's going to be great.

[06:26] All right, so that's Metallica, Ellie, and I'll tell you right now, I'll tell you right

[06:30] now, people are offering like $17,000, $18,000 for this game.

[06:34] I actually think this game might sell for around $20,000 this year.

[06:41] Will the hype last forever on the game?

[06:45] Probably not, right?

[06:46] It's still Metallica, right?

[06:47] I think sometimes people are looking at this game like it's the second coming of pinball.

[06:52] It's still Metallica.

[06:53] It's a fan layout.

[06:54] A lot has happened in pinball since Metallica.

[06:59] Two words, Keith Elwin, right?

[07:01] Another two words, Jack Danger.

[07:03] I think a lot of pinball design and creativity has gone up since Metallica came out.

[07:10] Now Metallica was a trailblazing game.

[07:12] It showed everybody how artwork could be on a game.

[07:16] Before Metallica, there was none of this like illustrated beautiful art.

[07:20] It also had a lot of toys, a lot of fun, great music, great code by Lyman.

[07:25] It did so much right and this game is taking it up a notch.

[07:29] I actually have some exclusive info on the topper.

[07:32] I've spoke to someone who saw the topper.

[07:35] The topper is going to be the big Metallica name spelled out like the way it is behind

[07:40] the guy in the electric chair.

[07:42] So the Metallica letters, I think there's some like crystals by the letters that also

[07:47] light up and then each individual Metallica letter lights up on the topper.

[07:53] Now the weird part and maybe this was just a proto, my friend told me that the letters

[07:58] light up in the color of a rainbow and it's like, I don't know, Metallica's colors are

[08:03] not rainbow and maybe that was just to showcase that it's full RGB LEDs up there and they can

[08:10] do a lot of different coloring effects.

[08:12] So I think that's probably why they were lit up like a rainbow, but that's going to be the

[08:16] Metallica topper and it's going to be released any day now.

[08:20] All right, so that's Metallica, 18 to $20,000 I hear people are offering for this game and

[08:27] they're probably going to get it.

[08:29] I haven't seen a stern frenzy like this in so long.

[08:33] All right, so what else is going on in pinball?

[08:36] Let's go to back to the future.

[08:38] A lot of rumors are swirling around the pinball space since expo about Dutch pinball possibly

[08:45] looking to partner up with someone to help with back to the future.

[08:49] And this makes total sense.

[08:51] I think everybody realizes that Dutch pinball is a company that's a boutique.

[08:57] They make 10 games a week and if you think about it, they're probably only making games

[09:03] like 45 weeks out of the year.

[09:06] And I think that's like a generous amount of weeks considering it's the Netherlands and

[09:11] they take like all of August off and then they have all these bank holidays.

[09:15] And so that's roughly 450 to 500 at most big Lebowski games they can make a year.

[09:24] Now if they make back to the future, what's going to happen when they get like 8,000 orders

[09:30] for the game or 5,000 orders?

[09:32] It would take them 10 years to make that.

[09:35] It doesn't make any sense.

[09:37] Look, stern regrets passing on the license.

[09:40] They do.

[09:41] If they go back in time, they would have got it the moment it was available.

[09:46] And look, we all know this.

[09:47] There are most likely just two companies.

[09:49] There is of course interest in this license from Jersey Jack Pinball and there's interest

[09:55] from Stern Pinball.

[09:56] It makes total sense, right?

[09:58] They're the two companies, the only two companies out there that could actually get it done.

[10:03] Now between those two, and I mean this when I say this, like six years ago, I would have

[10:09] wanted Jersey Jack to make this game.

[10:12] Remember six years ago Jersey Jack was putting a lot into their games.

[10:17] Their games were loaded.

[10:18] They were like the company that didn't leave stuff out and they went the extra mile.

[10:24] Since then, they've done the opposite.

[10:26] They've started to strip their games down.

[10:28] I don't think they're making the best, most fun pinball machines on planet earth right

[10:32] now.

[10:33] And also when it comes to manufacturing, how many they make a week seems a lot less than

[10:39] Stern.

[10:40] I mean, I think Jersey Jack maybe in a good week, what do you think it is?

[10:44] Like 100, 150 games at most.

[10:47] So I think they would also need like three years because think about it like this.

[10:50] It took them like three years to make all the guns and roses machines and back to the future

[10:55] would have even more demand.

[10:58] Okay.

[10:59] So that leaves Stern Pinball.

[11:00] And look, I think Stern Pinball is the right choice to make this game.

[11:05] Not only could they make the volume that the demand would require, but I also just think

[11:10] they've got the best talent in pinball right now.

[11:13] And can you imagine if someone like Jack Danger or Keith Elwin had back to the future and made

[11:21] it the right way?

[11:22] I just think it would be incredible.

[11:24] And Stern's got the resources to do it right.

[11:27] They've got the relationships with the studios to do it right.

[11:31] So as of today, I can 100% confirm for all of you.

[11:35] There's no deal done with anybody.

[11:37] This is going to be something that they're all going to have to figure out.

[11:40] I think it's an interesting time to see where this lands.

[11:44] But I think someone stepping in to help make this game and make it right is the right thing

[11:49] to do.

[11:50] I think the one thing to watch out for, I think the one thing that could derail all of this

[11:55] is what's in Barry's head right now, right?

[11:58] Does he want to be pinball famous or does he want to make a famous move that people will

[12:03] remember forever?

[12:04] I really think it comes down to that.

[12:06] Because I think sometimes you kind of have to put your ego aside and just face reality.

[12:12] And there's just something about the pinball space where everyone wants to be like famous,

[12:17] like a famous designer.

[12:18] But the truth is this, the truth is that some people have it and some people don't.

[12:24] And we know who they are.

[12:25] And I think Dutch is better off at making boutique games like Alice and maybe going

[12:30] to get other cult classic movies like the big Lebowski.

[12:35] Dutch is not the company that can do like Star Wars.

[12:38] You know, they just can't handle that kind of demand.

[12:41] So we'll see what happens.

[12:42] We will obviously be following this as things unfold.

[12:46] It's also so far away.

[12:48] We're like at least a year away from any back to the future pinball machine.

[12:52] And a lot's going to happen in pinball between now and then.

[12:55] Speaking about between now and then.

[12:58] The pinball quality.

[13:00] It is the number one thing that I think is going to make people have a fear of commitment

[13:06] on their games moving forward.

[13:08] I'm just seeing more quality issues with Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

[13:14] And again, it's over time.

[13:16] The game might work well when you open it up out of the box, but over time, right after

[13:20] like a year of owning it and putting a few thousand plays, I think people want to see

[13:25] how these games hold up.

[13:27] I think quality has always followed spooky around a little bit like a dark cloud.

[13:32] They've obviously gotten better, but as they get more ambitious with more mechs and more

[13:39] toys, that's why a lot of these companies are yanking stuff out.

[13:43] Because the more you put in, the more that can go wrong.

[13:46] The more servos you put in, the more servos that can fail.

[13:50] That's the truth about pinball.

[13:51] And I think a lot of companies out there have found ways to simplify the games, not add

[13:57] more complex engineering to them.

[14:00] So I give spooky credit for being ambitious, but I just hope the quality and the ambition

[14:06] can go together.

[14:07] Because if they don't, and we start to see people getting fed up with issues, remember

[14:12] it only takes one issue with a pinball machine to not want to play it, to not want to own

[14:18] it.

[14:19] And I know that if your game is down or something's wrong, it's a headache.

[14:23] You don't even want to look at it.

[14:24] You don't even want to see it in your game room when it's inoperable.

[14:28] So more to come on that.

[14:29] We should see the next spooky game sometime in December.

[14:33] I'm hearing it is evil dead.

[14:35] I'm hearing there's going to be a big house that spins like a cabin in the woods.

[14:39] I think it's going to be a sick, huge toy they put into the game.

[14:44] Yes, I use the word sick.

[14:45] All right.

[14:46] So that's spooky pinball.

[14:47] Let's talk about Avatar.

[14:49] Avatar sales are not good.

[14:50] All right.

[14:51] I keep checking in with distro friends.

[14:52] It's not selling that well.

[14:54] And I don't think coming out of expo, you didn't hear like a lot of people being like,

[14:59] I jumped on Avatar and I ordered one.

[15:02] I mean, heck, Stern marches out a 12 year old game and just pluses it up a little bit

[15:07] and they're going to sell more metallica's than they'll ever sell of avatar.

[15:11] And they already sold more metallica's than they ever did of avatar.

[15:15] Actually, the original metallica has sold more games than toy story, then Godfather

[15:21] and Elton John combined.

[15:23] I bet you also avatar.

[15:25] I bet that one metallica game has sold more units than the last four Jersey Jack machines.

[15:31] I just want to say this Jersey Jack is a company that needs to start listening to feedback.

[15:37] Like they need to listen to this show.

[15:39] And I think the reason avatar is not selling.

[15:41] I'm just going to say it.

[15:42] It's just not an exciting game.

[15:46] When you play it, you just don't feel the excitement of those movies.

[15:51] I think Keith Johnson has coded a game to fit a rule set and a template that he wanted

[15:58] to make.

[15:59] But I don't think he coded this game in a way that makes you feel anything like amazing.

[16:06] And when you play a pinball machine, you need more of those moments.

[16:10] You need to get your blood going.

[16:11] You need to get your energy going.

[16:13] And when you play avatar, it's just a little sterile.

[16:17] Like it's a little boring.

[16:18] And I think they can wake this game up with better code.

[16:21] I don't really care about the UV lighting.

[16:23] It is what it is, right?

[16:24] They might add more lights.

[16:26] I think Penn Stadium is going to come in and fix the issues with their additional kit.

[16:31] But it's not about the lighting.

[16:33] It's about does this game excite you?

[16:36] And for some of us out there, maybe it never will because the movies maybe never did.

[16:40] And that's the issue is on paper.

[16:44] Jack is inking these deals for properties that we don't really want.

[16:49] So then Harry Potter becomes the moment.

[16:52] I'm a little worried that they are not going to have the assets from the movie.

[16:57] If we see movie clips, I think they're going to be muted.

[17:01] I'm just worried about that.

[17:03] Every time they do a launch video, they get up there and say, everything you want is going

[17:08] to be in this game.

[17:09] Well, Eric Minier and Jersey Jack and everybody over there, we want synced up voices with

[17:16] the clips from the movie.

[17:18] How are you going to translate those movie moments the right way with muted clips?

[17:24] And again, I did not see in the recent avatar code a lot more of that put back into the

[17:31] game.

[17:32] It's a coding decision.

[17:34] And when I talk to them over there, I actually think they do have all the rights to use all

[17:40] the voices and the sound effects from those scenes.

[17:43] They decided not to do it because it's a lot more work and they want to have like their

[17:48] orchestration and their pinball callouts be the focus of the audio and not the audio from

[17:55] the movies.

[17:56] It's a huge mistake.

[17:58] When you play JAWS during every scene from the JAWS films, you hear exactly what is happening

[18:05] in those moments in the films.

[18:07] And that's how you do it, Jack.

[18:09] There's no other way to do it.

[18:11] All right.

[18:12] So Harry Potter is going to be everything, people.

[18:14] And it's going to be out in less than six months.

[18:17] So it's going to be coming soon.

[18:19] I don't know about you, but we sort of slide into the end of the year with all the holidays.

[18:23] And then before we know it, we're going to get another cornerstone game from Stern, which

[18:28] is most likely going to be Dungeons and Dragons.

[18:31] I think that is the game that Keith Elwin said he saw a mech that's going to blow people

[18:37] away.

[18:38] I think it's going to be D&D.

[18:40] Will D&D be the first Spike 3 game?

[18:43] If so, that feels weird to me that you would launch the new platform on a theme that's not

[18:49] a juggernaut.

[18:50] I think saving the bigger platform for King Kong and Keith Elwin is the right thing to

[18:56] do.

[18:57] That's what I would tell them how to launch Spike 3.

[19:00] And then I think we're going to go D&D and then into King Kong.

[19:03] I think we might see D&D because remember, the last cornerstone from Stern was X-Men

[19:09] and that was August.

[19:11] And so are we going to see D&D in December because Metallica is not a cornerstone game.

[19:18] And so Stern is just going to keep going people.

[19:21] That big factory, once it's on, it ain't going to stop.

[19:25] So I'm going to give you guys a rumor I heard.

[19:27] And I always love doing this.

[19:29] I haven't heard anyone say this before, but I heard Stern Pinball has the license to make

[19:35] fallout.

[19:37] The video game that's now an Amazon TV show, that's what I heard is Stern has option that

[19:43] property.

[19:44] It's going to be based on the TV show.

[19:46] And so there you go.

[19:48] And the TV show is popular.

[19:50] It's always a risk though, right?

[19:52] It's always a risk because how many of you really are clamoring for a fallout pinball

[19:57] machine?

[19:58] I don't know, right?

[19:59] It's kind of like in that John Wick territory where it's contemporary, it's popular, but

[20:05] is it popular enough?

[20:07] Does it have staying power?

[20:08] Has it impacted culture the way a show like Stranger Things has?

[20:13] I don't think so.

[20:14] To me, the smarter move would not be fallout.

[20:19] It would be Wednesday.

[20:21] And I would make Wednesday the Adams Family show on Netflix.

[20:24] I think that's a much smarter thing to do.

[20:27] A dark gothic Tim Burton show into a pinball machine.

[20:31] I think Wednesday Adams would be the smarter play if you were asking me.

[20:36] And then after that, the Great British Bake Off.

[20:38] I think if you make a Great British Bake Off pinball machine, everybody's in.

[20:42] Everybody.

[20:43] Every single one.

[20:44] All right, so what else is going on in pinball?

[20:47] You know what I'm noticing?

[20:48] I'm noticing a lot more patience by the community.

[20:51] I think people are watching these X-Men LEs and now we're starting to see some people

[20:56] put them up for sale.

[20:57] I think you really do get one chance to make a positive first impression.

[21:02] And even though people do have patience, I also think people don't want to wait six

[21:06] months anymore for a game to be great.

[21:08] I think if you're paying $13,000, you want to open it up and it should be great on day

[21:14] one.

[21:15] I will always feel that way.

[21:17] Rushing a game out and having mechanical issues and the code's not there.

[21:22] All that does over time is erode people's enthusiasm for the game.

[21:27] And then, you know, if you make the premiums look good enough, people are just kind of

[21:31] over it, right?

[21:32] The hype is gone.

[21:34] And Metallica has created so much hype that everything else is like in its shadow right

[21:40] now.

[21:41] And they could have easily sold 1,500 Metallica LEs and they're still struggling to sell

[21:46] out of 811 X-Men's.

[21:49] Everybody have a great Friday.

[21:52] Let's go Yankees.

[21:53] Canada's Pinball podcast is where it's at.

[21:56] Tune in tomorrow for the Saturday morning spectacular, which will be here on the Canada

[22:02] Club.

[22:03] You can also air on Facebook the 11 o'clock moment so everyone can see who wins.

[22:08] It's just a lot of good vibes.

[22:10] And the more I put some stuff out there for everybody, the more we attract people to the

[22:15] Canada Club.

[22:16] And I think we can get to 800.

[22:18] We're almost at 750.

[22:20] And for everybody out there, just give the gift of Canada this Christmas.

[22:24] I mean, seriously, it's like, do you have a good pinball friend who you want to give

[22:28] a gift to?

[22:29] It's $60 for an entire year of Canada's pinball podcast.

[22:33] I think it's a good gift.

[22:35] It's better than these t-shirts that don't really fit.

[22:37] It's better than these $2,000 toppers.

[22:40] So give the gift of Canada.

[22:41] Let's get to 800 by Christmas.

[22:43] I think that's a great goal.

[22:45] Everybody have a great weekend.

[22:47] Let's go Yankees.

[22:48] Canada out.

[22:49] Yeah, I'm just a playin' my song.

[22:51] The butterflies fly away.

[22:53] You know what I mean?

[22:55] I ain't like Canada.

[22:57] It's like Canada.

[22:59] I'm just a playin' my song.

[23:01] And no one's gonna be okay.

[23:03] You can't.

[23:05] Yeah.

[23:07] I'm already in the USA.

[23:09] You can't.

[23:11] I'm already in the USA.
