[00:00] We're back.

[00:30] Thank you for your baby.

[00:52] Alright, we're back. We're back. You guys back in? You guys back in?

[00:56] 35 people, let's do this. Alright, let me one of those moments.

[01:08] Pat Lawler never made anything this good. Just saying.

[01:13] Alright, here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal.

[01:18] I got, Canada's got his Reservoir de la Familia, Jose Cuevo, $200 bottle, fuck toppers, I bought bottles with tequila.

[01:27] What we're going to talk about right now, what's up Nigel? What we're going to talk about right now is my show today.

[01:37] And you heard, finally, you got confirmation, and I want to know what you think.

[01:44] You got confirmation today that Pat Lawler buried Eric's game.

[01:51] So I wanted to hear from you guys right now. What do you think about that fact?

[01:57] That Pat Lawler buried Eric's Pirates of the Caribbean game.

[02:02] He did not want to help Eric. He did not want to have the game made, and he was jealous. Talk to me people.

[02:15] The sweet nectar.

[02:23] This is a $200 bottle, asshole. I fucking, go find me Reservoir de la Familia for less than $200.

[02:32] Fuck that. $200? Hold on, hold on.

[02:44] How much? How much? How much we got? How much people? Come on. Come on. I got to buy a fucking Rick and Morty.

[02:53] Hey Pat Lawler, let's see what Pat Lawler is driving these days, okay? What are we talking here?

[03:00] Hold on.

[03:04] Super childish of Pat. Pat's an asshole. It's an asshole move.

[03:11] Oh come on, Frenchie. Frenchie, get the fuck out of here. There's two sides to everything.

[03:18] Like dude, where you live in Frenchie? I'm sorry that like, Canada broke the news about this, but you think Pat Lawler is not a dick who's jealous of Eric's game?

[03:29] Come on. Okay, so Frenchie, here's my challenge to Christopher Frenchie. Go get Pat fucking Lawler on your fucking show and interview him about how there's two sides to the fucking story.

[03:41] Get the fuck out of here, man. Like why is Christopher Frenchie sticking up for Pat Lawler? That's unfucking believable to me.

[03:50] And Chris, you know I fucking love you, but the fact that you're sticking up for Lawler is such bullshit. Bullshit.

[03:57] Let me count it out. Count it out. Count it out. Count it out. Count it out. Count it out. Count it out.

[04:03] Give me Frenchie Dollars. Give me Frenchie Dollars. I don't need some Frenchie Dollars.

[04:06] Frenchie, Frenchie fan. The Frenchie fan.

[04:14] Pat Lawler is a dick.

[04:20] Brenda is like, what are you saying? What are you saying?

[04:25] Why am I showing money? Joshua Contos. Show money because that's it. Man, Canada's Pimba podcast. Money.

[04:38] I don't even care. Whatever. Whatever. You guys like...

[04:46] The fact that... whatever. You know what? You know what? Enjoy your hobby, people. Enjoy your hobby.

[04:55] Enjoy your hobby where like your old guard designer is a dick who buries a new guy's design that's the future of Pimba.

[05:04] And enjoy your hobby. Like I've never been in another hobby in which people are fucking supportive over a guy that's a complete asshole.

[05:13] It's not drunk Canada. You guys understand this that like I'm giving you the...

[05:32] Okay, let me ask you another question. What other Pimba podcast is giving you any of this information? What other Pimba podcast?

[05:41] How do you guys even listen to other Pimba podcasts? They're like the same shit every week.

[05:51] Pire to the Caribbean rules are still complex shit, but what's in the game is much better than what's in fucking Willy Wonka.

[06:11] Lorenzo, nobody says Canada's an asshole. Nobody.

[06:20] Franchi, Franchi, you gotta... Franchi, you're out of your fucking mind, objective? Franchi, I'm gonna be honest with you right now.

[06:28] The reason why your show is like a neutered version of you. Franchi, you gotta get it. You're like...

[06:35] Chris, do you want me to like tell people the truth of your show? Is that your show can't say how you really feel because Ed Van der Veen doesn't want to burn people in the industry.

[06:46] That's it. There's the show. So like Christopher Franchi is one of the most amazing personalities in Pimba and all I want is a Christopher Franchi show.

[06:58] And he has to bring people along for the ride that he doesn't even need. Where did my comments go? Where did my comments go?

[07:08] Comments are gone. I can't see anything. Oh, here we go. Where's the comments? How do I get the comments back?

[07:30] Does anyone know how to get comments back? I can't see any comments. This is pointless now. I can't read anything.

[07:37] I see no comments. 58... How do I get comments back on this?

[07:47] There's no comments. I can't do the show anymore.

[07:58] Huh.

[08:00] You're figuring out?

[08:02] No, I can't get the comments. Brenny, you work for Facebook.

[08:07] I don't actually work for Facebook.

[08:10] Why would they disappear?

[08:13] Oh, wow. It's nice and bright. But they just disappeared. Is it something? I swiped something.

[08:27] I can't see comments, guys.
