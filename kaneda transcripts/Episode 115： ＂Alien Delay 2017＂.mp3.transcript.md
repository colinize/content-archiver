[00:00] I felt I needed, as Ripley in activity, to keep myself kind of being brave instead of

[00:09] just running, trying to run away.

[00:11] And so I thought that she might, because I think Ripley doesn't get afraid the way most

[00:18] of us do.

[00:19] She's one of those people that goes, all right, let's try A. All right?

[00:22] That didn't work.

[00:23] Let's try B. But I think she, in this particular instance, because she was really

[00:29] at the end of her chance to survive, I thought she needed something to keep her concentration.

[00:36] Did you know that it took Ridley Scott 34 weeks to make Alien the movie back in 1979?

[00:56] It took 14 weeks to shoot the film, and then it took 20 weeks in post-production to create

[01:03] the Alien movie that we all love.

[01:08] Do you know that it has been 128 weeks since Alien Pimball was announced by Highway Pimball

[01:19] back in October of 2014 at Expo.

[01:24] And here we are, Alien Day 2017, and Alien Pimball is still not into full production.

[01:33] And I know a lot of people are probably wondering what I'm going to do on Alien Day, and I'm

[01:38] not going to do what people think I'm going to do.

[01:40] I'm not going to go off and give all of my opinions on why I think Alien is not in production.

[01:45] I think this is not a time for my opinion.

[01:48] What I want to do is help people form their own opinions.

[01:53] And I want you guys to hear some stuff and then make up your own minds.

[01:59] Sort of like a Canadian connect the dots on why I think Alien Pimball is not in production.

[02:06] And I think the reason why, and this is not an opinion, I think the reason why we don't

[02:12] see Alien Pimball on a production line, the answer to that question comes when we look

[02:19] at the past.

[02:20] And what I want to do on this edition of Canadian Pimball podcast is I simply want to share

[02:27] with you highway Pimball in its own words.

[02:31] I want to take clips of how Andrew Highway positioned highway Pimball from the very beginning,

[02:38] from way back in 2013.

[02:41] And I want you to listen to these clips.

[02:43] And after each one, I'll simply just recap what was said.

[02:47] And then I want you, after you add up all of the things that were said and all the promises

[02:53] that were made.

[02:54] I want you then to ask yourself why we don't have Alien Pimball in production on Alien

[03:02] Day 2017.

[03:03] All right.

[03:04] A little bit of a journey, a little chronological journey.

[03:07] And let's start from the very beginning.

[03:09] The year is 2013.

[03:12] And at this stage, Pimball has had somewhat of a resurgence.

[03:16] It's gone through the linearies, stern weathered those storms.

[03:20] They've got hit titles out there.

[03:22] Lord the Rings, Ellie, Metallica, ACDC.

[03:27] So the Pimball Pendulum has swung back in the favor of the Silver Ball Gods.

[03:32] And when this happens, a lot of companies start to see the success and the resurgence.

[03:37] And they jump back into the Pimball world.

[03:40] And one of those new companies that is formed and spoken about is highway Pimball.

[03:46] And I want to play a clip that sort of does a great job in introducing what highway Pimball

[03:50] is all about.

[03:51] Now, a new Pimball manufacturing company from Mertre Tidville is about to officially launch

[03:57] its first Pimball game and bring Pimball back to the masses.

[04:01] For the last two and a half years, Hayway in Mertre Tidville has redesigned nearly every

[04:07] aspect of Pimball machines to make them the most exciting and technologically advanced

[04:12] Pimball games in 25 years.

[04:14] Seeing Thomas has been funny at more.

[04:18] There were once machines in nearly every bar and amusement.

[04:21] And the bander who also sang of a Pimball wizard.

[04:24] For in recent years, the game has been in decline.

[04:28] Although a company in Mertre Tidville, the only UK manufacturer of coin-operated Pimball

[04:33] machines, hopes to change that.

[04:36] Highway Pimball have redesigned nearly every aspect of the machines to try and revive

[04:41] the game.

[04:42] Over time, Pimball has become a business of mine and I got to understand all the reasons

[04:46] why Pimball was no longer a mainstream activity again.

[04:49] And so I felt that I could create a new company and we spent the last three years with an

[04:54] intensive research and development programme to basically redesign Pimball from the ground

[04:58] up and make it a 21st century product.

[05:01] One that could really make Pimball the mainstream activity again.

[05:03] OK, so we have a highway Pimball spending three years of research and development to design

[05:10] a new Pimball machine to make Pimball part of the masses again.

[05:15] And I think that's always sort of been a theme of highway Pimball from the very beginning

[05:20] was it was going to look at Pimball differently.

[05:22] That it was going to design a game that would be friendly or for operators, friendly or

[05:26] for collectors.

[05:28] And it would be a new way of ushering Pimball into the 21st century.

[05:35] And more than just sort of these promises, we also were introduced to some of the greatest

[05:42] Pimball designers of all time joining the ranks of highway Pimball to add sort of like

[05:47] that credibility and excitement to the company like the following announcement.

[05:51] It gives me great pleasure to announce that we have an absolute Pimball design legend

[05:56] who's now gone and joined highway Pimball and it's none other than Dennis Nordman.

[06:00] So what's Dennis going to be doing for highway Pimball?

[06:03] Well Dennis is already now in the early stages of design for one of our next games.

[06:08] It leads me on to say that we have two games at quite a good stage of development already

[06:13] which will be games number two and three and both of those will be licensed themes.

[06:17] And Dennis is designing one of those two licensed games.

[06:20] Okay so the year is 2013 highway Pimball's brand new and we hear that all star designer

[06:26] Dennis Nordman has joined the team is working on game two.

[06:32] These two and three are far along into development and they're both licensed themes.

[06:37] Okay this is what we're hearing right away at the beginning of this company in 2013.

[06:41] But that's not all.

[06:42] There are even more sort of Pimball greats who are joining the highway team and making

[06:48] games.

[06:49] Let's see who else joined the team back then or was making a game for them.

[06:53] We had the news a while ago that John Trudeau had joined Stern Pimball and yet he was

[06:58] his only game for you too.

[07:00] So what's happening with that?

[07:01] Well John was bought on board to design one game for us.

[07:05] So we had a contract to design one game and that's exactly what John has done.

[07:08] So John has prepared the game up to the point where we're ready to develop that as a

[07:13] white wood as well.

[07:14] And that's not one of our first three games.

[07:17] John's first game or John's game with us is scheduled for a late 2014 release date.

[07:23] So we are developing that at the moment but we're concentrating on games two and three

[07:27] but we're expecting John's game to be at the white wood stage sometime around Christmas

[07:31] time.

[07:32] Okay, so John Trudeau's game is highway game number four.

[07:36] It's being promised for release sometime in late 2014.

[07:42] So that means there would be three titles released prior to that game sometime in 2014.

[07:51] And as we all know, 2014 goes by and we don't see license game number two.

[07:58] We don't see license game number three.

[08:00] We don't see John Trudeau's game number four.

[08:04] But what we do get is we do get alien Pimball announced at expo of 2014 and that is in

[08:13] October.

[08:15] And when Andrew announces alien at expo, he announces that the game will actually be out in

[08:22] April of 2015.

[08:24] And when he announces such an aggressive time on people ask him how he can deliver a game

[08:31] so quickly.

[08:32] And I want to play what his response is to highway Pimball's ability to manufacture a

[08:38] game so quickly.

[08:39] One of the things people just sort of link in what you've just said there.

[08:42] One of the things people are surprised about sometimes is the timeframes that we give

[08:46] that will take us to actually develop a game.

[08:47] But from the very start of this whole process, we wanted to develop a game which will be

[08:53] very easy to build from our side.

[08:55] It will be very easy to service in long term from operators and from collectors too.

[09:01] But this whole how we could speed up the whole process expanded into other areas as well.

[09:06] For example, as you said, virtual game side of things.

[09:09] It means that what we can do is at the same time that we are developing a whitewood as

[09:13] we are here, for example, making sure the shots work and do adjustments there.

[09:17] At the same time as that, we can work on a digital platform and already be working on rules,

[09:22] lighting, sound effects, integration, or video graphics such as interactive dashboards

[09:28] and so on.

[09:29] So you can actually develop a number of different items of the game at the same time,

[09:32] which can really save you a lot of time further down the road.

[09:36] So from outside of things, we're looking to try to have this game into production at

[09:40] some stage in April.

[09:42] That might sound very short, but we actually have a fully playable version of a game on

[09:45] the digital platform at the moment.

[09:47] And although currently that focuses more on the aliens, the second film, we are building

[09:52] in the alien wall setting to that as well because of course our game focuses on the two

[09:56] films and how you participate in that universe.

[09:59] So we are still very confident.

[10:01] As I said, we're ready to start testing our whitewood within the first couple of weeks

[10:04] of January and development is happening very quickly.

[10:07] Okay, so this is October of 2014 and we hear really for the first time highway pinball

[10:14] talking about the digital platform that they use to make their games and how utilizing

[10:19] this digital platform will make developing their games quicker than what other companies

[10:25] do.

[10:26] And so they're also very confident that they are moving towards that sort of April 2015

[10:33] release of alien and January being a date where the whitewood would be complete.

[10:38] But that's not all the exciting news that we get from highway pinball during this time

[10:42] period.

[10:43] We also learn that another sort of pinball all star is joining the ranks of highway pinball

[10:51] and let me introduce who that was.

[10:53] So that's not the only change.

[10:55] You've also now got a new member of the highway pinball team, a well-known designer.

[11:01] Can you tell us a little bit about him?

[11:03] Yeah, and he gives me great pleasure to say that we have a new addition to our team now.

[11:07] This man has been, I've been a huge fan of his and his work over the years.

[11:11] I have a number of his games in my collection.

[11:14] And ever since he was a guest at my show, the UK pinball party, we discussed the possibility

[11:19] of him joining our team and making games for us.

[11:22] So it gives me great pleasure to announce that Barry Owls, the world famous pinball designer,

[11:27] has joined our ranks and is one of our official game designers.

[11:30] And he tells us a little bit about what Barry is going to be doing.

[11:33] Is he going to be designing games?

[11:34] Is he going to be working on other designs?

[11:36] Is he going to be helping out?

[11:37] He's not physically going to be in the factory, working in the factory.

[11:39] So how's his contribution going to help highway pinball?

[11:44] Well, Barry is going to be, sorry, Barry is going to be first and foremost designing one

[11:48] particular game in our schedule, which is due for release towards the end of next year.

[11:52] So that's one aspect of the work Barry will be doing.

[11:54] Okay, so this is still 2014 and we're hearing that Barry's joined the team and that Barry's

[12:01] also working on a game that is going to be released sometime at the end of the following

[12:07] year.

[12:08] So that Barry's game should be out in 2015.

[12:12] Now just to recap, that means we had in 2013 we heard license games two and three were

[12:20] really far along into development.

[12:23] In 2013 we heard that John Trudeau would have a game that would be out by the end of

[12:28] 2014 and then we're hearing that Barry here, his game would be out by the end of 2015.

[12:36] Okay, but all this is happening amidst the excitement over alien and let's just say that

[12:42] when alien did get announced there was a lot of excitement.

[12:45] A lot of people consider alien to be a dream theme.

[12:49] So when they heard this news, this was really exciting.

[12:53] And remember this was a time where Pimball had a lot of exciting news going on.

[12:59] This was still before there was any predator problems that were at the surface.

[13:05] This was sort of right when Jaypop started to unravel around this point but because

[13:14] Highway Pimball was able to start to bring full throttle games to shows for people at

[13:20] the play.

[13:21] Not less concern that things with alien woulding go smoothly.

[13:26] But what happens next is we start to get up towards April of 2015 which is that date that

[13:33] Andrew said alien would be out.

[13:36] And when it looked like it wasn't going to ship that quickly, he got interviewed by

[13:41] Nate Schivers and there's a lot of good information that Andrew says about his company and

[13:48] the kind of company and his expectations for Highway Pimball that he shares with Nate

[13:52] that I want to share with you guys right now.

[13:55] We just didn't have enough space and now we actually have a 42,000 square factory.

[13:58] We're using half of it at the moment but we know that by the time we're going to get

[14:05] to sort of alien production, we're going to need the other half as well.

[14:08] How are you staffing this factory?

[14:10] Are these contract workers or do you have actual full time employees?

[14:14] Yeah, full time employees.

[14:17] Up to recently we were up to 12 full time employees were up to I think 14 now.

[14:22] We should be up to 16 now within the next couple of weeks.

[14:25] You know, you've got to be very careful Nate from a staffing point of view because you

[14:29] know, we're aiming by towards by the end of this year.

[14:33] We're aiming to be up to production levels of four to 500 games a month.

[14:36] That's what we're going to be geared up to do.

[14:38] Okay, so this interview takes place around April of 2015 and Andrew Highway says that Highway

[14:45] Pimball will be able to make four to 500 games a month.

[14:50] They have a staff of around 15 to 16 people and they're going to make four to 500 games

[14:57] a month.

[14:58] Now to put that in context, that's around 6,000 games a year.

[15:03] Remember, we just heard from Roger Sharp that the total number of Pimball machines that's

[15:10] probably sold annually globally is around 10,000.

[15:16] So after Nate, here's that really big number.

[15:19] I think it does a good job and asks a very great follow up question.

[15:23] I guess I'm just wondering, is there a market for four to 500 Pimball machines in addition

[15:29] to what's out there right now to be sold?

[15:31] I mean, what are your thoughts on selling that many games a month?

[15:35] Well, what I can tell you is that first game is a non-licensed game.

[15:38] As you know, full throttle, but our next three games of which you know, Alien is the first

[15:41] one.

[15:42] And our second two licenses are both very, very strong licenses as well.

[15:46] And the way that we've geared up our whole process is that we are going to have three games

[15:52] released a year.

[15:53] That's what we're geared up to do.

[15:55] So it's April 2015 and Andrew Highway is saying they are geared up to make three games

[16:01] a year.

[16:02] We've heard this three games a year since the very inception of Highway Pimball.

[16:08] And it all sounds very good, right?

[16:10] Again, at this point, I think a lot of people were still on board and believe a lot of this

[16:15] stuff.

[16:16] In fact, you know, after saying that they were going to make 500 games a month and they

[16:20] were going to have this many titles, it all sounded good too because remember the highway

[16:26] proposition was the swappable play field.

[16:29] But you're going to be able to take one game out and put another game in for much cheaper

[16:34] than buying a whole another game.

[16:36] And that was a really appealing sort of model for people.

[16:40] And the whole company was being built around that model.

[16:44] And when he gave these aggressive timelines, it wasn't met with skepticism.

[16:48] In fact, a lot of it was met with people saying how impressed they were and how they couldn't

[16:53] wait to see it all unfold.

[16:55] And there's a lot of congratulatory messages going out there like this one.

[17:00] I still think that's an impressive timeline from announcing a game that we didn't really

[17:04] know was coming in October to possibly shipping games by the end of the summer.

[17:09] That to me is very impressive.

[17:11] And I wish you guys a lot of luck on that.

[17:13] I think you're going to have a big hit on your hands with that.

[17:18] Okay, so the year is still 2015 and April 2015 comes and goes and Alien Pimbal does not

[17:26] develop.

[17:27] It's not launched.

[17:28] It's not released.

[17:30] And so what starts to happen is people start to just ask questions about when does Andrew

[17:35] think Alien Pimbal will be out?

[17:37] And he starts to give a new answer about when he feels Alien Pimbal will be released.

[17:44] And that date is the following.

[17:45] Yeah, that's for the development process.

[17:48] What I can tell you is timeline wise is we're all now and the goal post has shifted a little

[17:52] bit.

[17:53] We're looking to have this released in time for my show, which is the UK Pimbal party in August.

[17:58] So we're looking to have games fully built there and even have started production by that

[18:02] stage as well.

[18:03] We don't want to be leaving any later than that.

[18:05] Okay, so they don't want Alien Productions to start any later than August of 2015.

[18:11] Now we all know what happens.

[18:13] Alien is not shown by August of 2015 in terms of being a fully playable game.

[18:20] Instead this is the point in the story where we start to hear a lot about Fox approval and

[18:27] Fox approving the artwork and because Fox has an approved it, there's nothing that Andrew

[18:32] can show.

[18:34] And so this is the point in our story now where I'm simply going to communicate the rest

[18:40] of this story for you guys out there that haven't followed it.

[18:44] So we get the Alien artwork in in in later half of 2015, the summer of 2015.

[18:52] It's announced that that orc is doing the artwork for the game.

[18:56] And we hear we hear a lot about needing approval before they can show it.

[19:01] The first thing that's shown is the play field artwork to the game with the with the

[19:06] Translate and then the side artwork.

[19:10] And they're you know, and we all know about all the not controversy, but the back and

[19:14] forth and the opinions about the artwork.

[19:17] And I don't want to go into that.

[19:19] So that takes us into 2016 and people start to get really excited when we get into 2016

[19:25] about whether or not we're going to see Alien in 2016, right?

[19:29] So in the beginning of the year, there was a lot of excitement around and you'll recall

[19:34] this Alien Day, right?

[19:37] That Alien was planning this huge celebration and they created this moment.

[19:43] It sort of became like the back to the future day for the Alien franchise and it became

[19:47] of April 26, right?

[19:50] 426.

[19:51] I think it has to do with the the the consolation or the planet name that they they visit.

[19:57] So this becomes this moment that if Alien Pimbal is going to show us the game, they can't

[20:05] miss this date.

[20:06] The date comes and goes and we don't really get anything.

[20:09] In fact, we get communication that they weren't really aware of the day itself.

[20:15] What made the date more painful for people waiting for Alien Pimbal on that day was the

[20:20] fact that Zen Pimbal, the digital Pimbal platform put out three versions of Alien Pimbal

[20:27] all digitally for people to play and in those games themselves, we saw Sigourney Weaver.

[20:33] Now there was their whole issue around Ripley Gate and we talked a lot about that on how

[20:39] Sigourney Weaver was not secured as part of the Alien package.

[20:43] And again, we're not going to rehash a lot of this stuff.

[20:46] But what I want to do is read some of the communication at this point that was made by

[20:51] Highway Pimbal to its customers.

[20:54] So if we go back and we look at 2016, a lot of it was just like a dead year.

[21:00] We started to see some various versions of the game.

[21:05] But these are just sort of like prototype versions of the machine.

[21:09] But what we heard, this was way back in August of 2016.

[21:15] We heard the following.

[21:17] We have had a working prototype for quite a while now and many things already bolted

[21:23] onto the game.

[21:24] These pre-production units will have everything on them that should be there.

[21:29] We are making three of these games now.

[21:32] Following this, we will probably build another 10 games in September and these will include

[21:38] the mapped circuit boards.

[21:40] These games will be used for testing and promotional purposes.

[21:44] As soon as we receive approval from Fox, we will begin production immediately.

[21:51] Parts will be waiting for that green light.

[21:54] Parts orders will be waiting for that green light.

[21:57] The plan is to begin production in September and to begin shipping games by the end of October.

[22:04] Okay, so this Andrew communicated this in August of people and this became the new sort of

[22:11] finish line that we heard that production would begin in September.

[22:16] September was right before Expo and what happens next is an email goes out.

[22:25] An email goes out to people who have put deposits down on alien roughly around this sort of

[22:32] like late September, early October time period.

[22:36] And I want to read what that email says that was communicated.

[22:41] Further to our email at the beginning of September, we are pleased to inform you that we have received

[22:46] approval from 20th Century Fox and it is full steam ahead for the commencement of alien

[22:53] pinball production exclamation point.

[22:56] As promised, please find attached the official game flyer.

[23:01] Here you will be able to see our brand new promo video for alien pinball plus many high

[23:06] resolution photos of every angle of the game.

[23:10] Payment.

[23:11] But previously advised and as per our payment terms, we now request you make your next payment.

[23:18] This can be as per the installment agreement if you wish you can pay in full.

[23:23] To pay the next installment, which is 50% of the order, the amount is $3,925.

[23:30] However if you wish to pay in full, this would be $6,225.

[23:36] Neither of these above payments includes shipping costs or optional extras.

[23:43] The reason this email went out is that per the contract between highway pinball and the

[23:49] people who gave pre-orders, they were told that they would not be asked for that additional

[23:56] money until alien pinball went into production.

[24:00] This email went out to customers in September of 2016 asking for more money from pre-order

[24:08] people because they were told their games were in production.

[24:15] And I remember hearing once that Andrew said he would never even take pre-orders unless

[24:20] games were being produced.

[24:22] Well the thing is, I made the decision that I wasn't going to take any pre-order money

[24:28] for any of my games until we had a product which was virtually ready.

[24:32] Okay so at this point we're sort of coming into the holidays of 2016 and people's patience

[24:39] is starting to wear a little bit thin.

[24:41] But people are excited because there is a physical game and the game does come to Expo 2016.

[24:50] There is sort of like a launch party for it that it's called a launch party not a reveal

[24:54] party.

[24:56] There's actually flyers that say now shipping 2016 and so there's a physical game, right?

[25:02] This isn't vaporware.

[25:04] There's not nothing to show.

[25:06] But the big question mark that just remains on everyone's mind is when will production

[25:11] begin.

[25:12] So Andrew sends out another correspondence via pinside that's sort of like one of his

[25:17] updates and this was six months ago and this was sort of around the November time period.

[25:24] He writes, part of the challenge is ramping up the production process over the coming

[25:29] weeks to meet our target of producing 100 games a month by the end of this year.

[25:34] We have hired the necessary people with the knowledge and experience to make this happen.

[25:39] We are significantly strengthening all areas of our company to meet the needs over the

[25:44] coming months.

[25:45] This includes extra personnel in all areas of the company.

[25:49] We know that there have been some delays in replying to customers over the last few weeks

[25:53] and for us this is unacceptable.

[25:55] We will endeavor to deal with existing customers and new increase in a much faster manner in

[26:00] the coming days and weeks.

[26:03] So this whole notion that people are being hired to meet the demand of highway pinball.

[26:11] And that's sort of where we are today.

[26:14] So no games came out in December.

[26:18] No games came out in January.

[26:20] There was more correspondence between highway that 100 LEs would be out in January that

[26:30] has stopped.

[26:31] The communication that games would be shipping in two weeks stopped happening.

[26:36] So that brings us to today.

[26:39] It is April 26, 2017.

[26:43] And I want all of you out there to just make up your own minds.

[26:47] I want all of you to hear what you've heard, the kinds of things that have been communicated

[26:52] to you over the years and draw your own conclusions on whether or not you think you're going to

[26:58] get your game, whether or not you think you should invest in certain companies.

[27:03] I can't make up your mind for you.

[27:06] But I do think there is power in looking back.

[27:10] And I think there is an important lesson for all of us here.

[27:14] Is that sometimes we forget.

[27:16] Sometimes we forget what people have promised us because time elapses.

[27:26] It's not easy for us to go into a pin-side thread when there's 300 pages on a topic and

[27:33] go back and read what people said.

[27:36] You can go into the alien pinball thread.

[27:38] I did this.

[27:40] You can find where Iceman said two years ago that if the game didn't come out by the end

[27:46] of 2015, he was out.

[27:50] But that's what happens to a lot of us.

[27:53] We fall in love with a particular pinball theme and we don't want to go back.

[27:59] We don't want to listen to what we heard.

[28:02] We just want to believe what we want to believe because we want to dream about how exciting

[28:08] alien would be.

[28:09] We want to dream about how exciting a predator machine would be.

[28:12] We want to dream about how exciting magic girl would end up being.

[28:19] I'm not saying that Andrew is the only one who has said stuff that hasn't come true.

[28:25] This entire hobby seems to be filled with leadership that just can never deliver on what

[28:32] they say.

[28:34] Skip B did it with Kevin.

[28:36] J-pop did it.

[28:38] Andrew did it with alien.

[28:40] How many times have we heard we're going to get new Batman code in two weeks?

[28:45] I think what's important here is that people need to stop pretending that a delay equals

[28:53] something good is happening.

[28:55] I see that a lot.

[28:56] This apologist mindset that the longer it takes for a game to come out, the better the

[29:02] game is being made.

[29:04] I don't know if that's the case.

[29:06] I think the longer it takes for a game to come out, the more money a company is burning

[29:14] with no revenue coming in.

[29:16] I think the longer it takes for a game to come out, the more problems that companies encounter

[29:23] and getting to production.

[29:25] I've never seen an example where a company took an extra two years and got it right.

[29:32] If you just look at history, look at what's happened to Dutch pinball.

[29:38] What does that mean?

[29:39] What does that mean for alien and highway pinball and 2017 and where things go?

[29:46] I'll say this quite honestly.

[29:48] I don't know what the future holds.

[29:50] I really don't.

[29:51] I'm not over there.

[29:53] I don't know their financials.

[29:55] All I know is what's been promised to us in the past has rarely come true.

[30:02] The promise of three to five games.

[30:04] The promise of four to five hundred games a month.

[30:07] The promise of Barry's game.

[30:11] The promise of John Trudeau's game.

[30:13] The promise of all these things, two to three more licenses that are juggernauts.

[30:18] All these things were promised to us.

[30:22] It's up to you to make up your mind.

[30:25] If you have money in and you love alien, you're probably at the point now where you're

[30:29] just going to stick it out because you've weighed it long enough.

[30:32] I understand that.

[30:33] I understand that.

[30:35] But all I want to do is say everybody out there, everybody out there, don't stop seeking

[30:43] the truth.

[30:44] Don't stop asking questions and all you got to do, all you got to do is go back and read

[30:50] and go back and listen.

[30:52] All of these things are public information.

[30:55] These are not my opinions.

[30:57] Nothing that I presented to you today is my personal opinion.

[31:01] These are simply me sharing with you what you've been told.

[31:07] It's up to you to make up your own mind.

[31:09] I want you to have a happy alien day.

[31:11] I want you to go watch the movies.

[31:14] I hope you guys get your pinball machines.

[31:16] I hope you guys get your alien pinball machines.

[31:19] I hope everybody gets their big Lebowski pinball machines.

[31:23] The day is going to come when you're going to have to start making people accountable for

[31:30] what they say and you're going to have to make sure that people's actions back up their

[31:37] words and their words back up their actions and vice versa.

[31:43] I'm not the bad guy.

[31:44] I love pinball just as much as you and I think everyone who spends money on a product should

[31:50] get that product.

[31:52] They should get it when it was promised to them and their money should not be held hostage

[31:57] for years.

[31:58] I will fight for you.

[32:02] I am the only pinball podcast that even attempts to do this stuff, that attempts to keep people

[32:08] honest for what they say.

[32:10] I will take the arrows in my back and I know that these kinds of podcasts might upset

[32:15] some people.

[32:16] But that's okay.

[32:18] I'm willing to take some of that heat just so you guys can make a better decision in

[32:24] the future.

[32:25] Alright, that's it.

[32:27] Episode, I think this is like 115 of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[32:31] We'll talk to you guys real soon.
