[00:00] X and Light, and tonight, take my hand, I'm to never, never land.

[00:13] Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

[00:30] And sold your old LEs for like 14 grand, you're very, very welcome.

[00:36] For those that didn't and held out, I feel your pain today.

[00:40] I feel your pain because Stern Pimbal released a very nice remastered edition of Metallica.

[00:47] I want to go over the stuff I love, the stuff I'm like indifferent about, and the stuff I don't like.

[00:53] Now, I also asked each and every one of you for your feedback on this machine,

[00:58] and I'm going to read your feedback on the air.

[01:01] I will have to summarize some of your feedback simply because some of you write a lot,

[01:06] and I'm not just going to read out a paragraph of commentary.

[01:10] But before I talk about this new machine, right, coming back after 12 years,

[01:16] I want to start out by saying one simple thing.

[01:20] How is this not remaking an LE of a game that already had an LE?

[01:29] I've been thinking about this all day.

[01:31] As much as I am excited about this game, it is hard to erase the fact that this does feel like

[01:40] Stern is going against its own word again.

[01:45] And how many times are we going to hear them say something and do something else?

[01:52] This feels like a flat out lie if we were to take them at their word,

[01:59] that they were never going to make more LEs of a game that already had an LE.

[02:06] There's no loopholes.

[02:08] There's no context by which this now makes sense.

[02:12] It is a remake of Metallica, all right?

[02:16] New artwork, sure.

[02:17] New sculpts, sure.

[02:19] Better engineered mechs, fine.

[02:21] A couple more modes, more illustrations, LCD screen, all that's fine and all.

[02:27] But it's still in LE of a game that had another LE.

[02:33] And if you own one of those 500 original Metallica LEs, how do you feel today?

[02:40] Not only did you lose exclusivity, you also lost a lot of money.

[02:45] And now there is a thousand Metallica LEs in the world.

[02:50] And I'm not a fan of that.

[02:52] Stern might as well have just made Godzilla 70th in LE,

[02:57] because I don't know what they consider to be not the same game.

[03:01] Because this is the same game.

[03:03] It is the same game.

[03:04] Adding some features, adding some new modes does not change the fact

[03:09] that there was zero.

[03:11] I mean this zero R&D that had to really go into the design and layout of this game.

[03:18] It's already been designed.

[03:20] They're using the same code Lyman sheets worked on 12 years ago.

[03:25] I just want to start this show by saying, shame on you, Stern.

[03:29] You still have yet to figure out how you want to treat the collector

[03:34] new and box buyer base.

[03:36] And you can't just make new buyers happy by sacrificing the happiness of your old buyers.

[03:42] And the old buyers are the loyal customers that are the reason why you're still in business 12 years later.

[03:50] I don't like this.

[03:51] We need to have some principles.

[03:54] We need to hold people accountable for the things they're going to say,

[03:58] especially when there's this much money.

[04:01] So on that level, on that front, this entire game sort of disgusts me

[04:08] because they went against their word.

[04:10] If they wanted to remaster Metallica and just make premiums and there's no limit like Godzilla 70th,

[04:17] then it's a different story.

[04:19] Then they're not lying about never making an Ellie again, but they didn't.

[04:24] I just wanted to start this show by saying, I'm not happy about that.

[04:28] Now moving on to the game.

[04:30] What do I think about this remake?

[04:32] Well, look, when I first saw the video, I watched the four minute video of John Borg and Ray Day

[04:39] explaining this game to us.

[04:42] And I want to say that John Borg and Ray Day should be nowhere near a video

[04:49] that is designed to get you excited about the game.

[04:53] It's like they were battling it out in who can be more monochromatic,

[04:57] who can be more boring and uninterested in the very product they're trying to hype and trying to sell.

[05:03] I mean, I could look at this game and in 30 seconds,

[05:07] I could deliver more enthusiasm, more excitement and more passion about this game than they were.

[05:14] And I don't even understand it.

[05:16] I mean, Ray Day looks like he just came out of the movie The Burbs.

[05:19] Like he's one of the clopech nephews or something.

[05:22] I mean, it's just not what you put in front of people to get excited.

[05:27] And even Borgie, even John Borg, he was just like so monochromatic.

[05:32] Oh man, they just need to figure out a way, Stern, to just use Jack Danger to sell everything.

[05:38] He's like the only dude that when you put him on camera, he's charismatic, he's got swagger.

[05:44] I think Gomez does a good job and maybe it's weird having Jack sell other people's games,

[05:50] but that is why Stern needs someone like Kaneda.

[05:54] That's why Stern needs someone like Kaneda over there.

[05:56] I mean it.

[05:57] It's like, where's your marketing department?

[05:59] Where's Zach Sharp?

[06:00] Where's Jared?

[06:01] Didn't they hire like an agency?

[06:03] Where's Seth Davis?

[06:05] I mean, Seth is signing the game.

[06:07] You know, I know people would rather have the artist sign it or other people, the band members,

[06:13] but man, they just need to figure out a better way.

[06:15] All right, so marketing aside, what did I think of this game?

[06:19] I'm going to tell you right now, I think the game looks really good.

[06:23] I think the cabinet artwork, when you see it right away, it jumps out at you.

[06:28] And I'm just going to say this, the Ellie looks so much better than the premium.

[06:34] It is crazy to me, the amount of people that are trying to justify the fact that because

[06:40] the Ellie is sold out and you can't get one that you're going to be like, the premium

[06:46] is better.

[06:47] The premium is the way to go.

[06:48] Are you out of your freaking minds?

[06:51] Look at the premium translate.

[06:53] It looks like Mount Rushmore with Metallica.

[06:56] It looks so bad compared to the kick-ass translate that's on the Ellie.

[07:01] The Ellie red with that Kraken and all the cool stuff happening.

[07:06] The premium has the same art on like both sides.

[07:09] It's not really that interesting.

[07:11] It's not nearly as dynamic.

[07:13] I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but the Ellie looks so damn good.

[07:19] And I think the premium doesn't look bad, but it's nowhere near as nice as the Ellie.

[07:25] But here's the thing, I think both cabinets look really, really good.

[07:29] I do.

[07:30] I think they both look better than any of the original Metallica cabinets that were out

[07:35] there.

[07:36] All of them pale in comparison to the artwork on these cabinets.

[07:40] Now here's where I think the game takes a step backwards.

[07:44] I don't think the new game's play field looks nearly as good as dirty Donnie's.

[07:50] I don't.

[07:51] I don't think it pops.

[07:52] I don't think the artwork is as cohesive.

[07:55] If you look at Donnie's and you go and you look at his artwork, it like jumps out at

[08:00] you with these bold, bright, vibrant colors.

[08:05] You've got the flames.

[08:07] You've got the Metallica characters.

[08:09] The way he illustrated Metallica, I like that more than what's on the new one.

[08:13] I like the way he had each character with their instrument above them and they're making

[08:18] all these like zany faces.

[08:21] It brought a lot of personality to the game.

[08:24] Now you look at the middle there where Metallica appears.

[08:28] And again, it's that Mount Rushmore look.

[08:30] And I know what they're going for with this like UV ink is like the new toy in Pinball

[08:35] where like when UV ink hits it, it turns their faces into skeletons.

[08:41] That's really neat.

[08:42] But there's just something about their faces there that just doesn't look great.

[08:47] And then as I go north of there, it's just really busy.

[08:51] What's going on with Rice Cooper's art package.

[08:54] He's the artist for this game.

[08:56] And I just don't think he nailed the play field.

[08:59] I really don't.

[09:00] I actually prefer the dirty Donnie play field over the new one.

[09:05] And then just in general, right, as I see both of them side by side, I kind of feel

[09:11] like Rice didn't really know what he wanted to do.

[09:16] And you can see it.

[09:17] You've got like Metallica over the inserts in the middle.

[09:21] Then you've got the faces.

[09:22] And then he's got these like weird red hands that just appear on the play field.

[09:28] I don't know what they're attached to.

[09:30] Is there a demon somewhere?

[09:33] And then you've got like just a lot of random stuff just floating around.

[09:37] But it's not nearly as consistent and cohesive as dirty Donnie's art package was.

[09:44] And I like the way Donnie's when you look at it, all the shots sort of flowed into the

[09:50] artwork, like leading you up to those shots.

[09:52] And I think Rice tried to do something similar, but I don't really think he has an understanding

[09:58] yet of how artwork lays out differently on a pinball machine.

[10:04] But man, it's still really nice.

[10:05] I mean, I don't want to take everything away from it.

[10:08] It's still really nice.

[10:10] And there's a lot of nice details in the new game that add a nice touch to it, like the

[10:15] skeleton skulls over the slingshots.

[10:18] I like that.

[10:19] I like the new Sparky, not as much as the old Sparky.

[10:22] I think the mod community is going to have their way with him.

[10:26] But the old one was a lot more zany with the big tongue sticking out.

[10:30] I love the fact that they added sculpts over the ramps.

[10:34] You can see those on the game.

[10:36] And they maintained all the toys of the original game.

[10:39] The one thing too that I just was like, ah, the original one was better is the hammer.

[10:45] Like for some reason, the hammer in this game, the way it's colored so gray and dull, it

[10:52] just doesn't pop.

[10:54] It doesn't stick out.

[10:55] And I always loved that hammer in the original Metallica.

[10:59] It really felt like it extended from the world dirty Donnie created and sort of like the

[11:04] humor and the personality of his game extended into the mechanisms.

[11:09] And I think in this one, it's a little bit more sterile to me.

[11:13] So that was something I just noticed when I looked at the game for the first time.

[11:16] We definitely see improved stuff in the game though, improved magnets.

[11:21] If you look at the magnets on the old one, then the new one, Stern's using its updated

[11:26] hardware to make this game better.

[11:28] We've got the expression lighting.

[11:30] We've got the inner art blades.

[11:32] You got 22 songs in the new game.

[11:35] You've got two new modes or mini wizard modes in the game.

[11:38] So there's a lot to like about this remastered Metallica and it's Metallica.

[11:44] You know, at the end of the day, it is kind of crazy.

[11:47] 12 years has gone by.

[11:49] And they made a lot of Metallica games back in the day.

[11:52] You know, some people love it.

[11:53] Some people are indifferent to it.

[11:55] I don't really hear people hate it.

[11:57] The most negative thing you'll hear about Metallica is that it feels like it's chopping wood,

[12:02] but it's a Lyman sheets masterpiece.

[12:04] It's a great game by John Borg.

[12:06] And with so many new people in the pinball hobby now, it is a no brainer that this thing

[12:12] was going to sell.

[12:13] And the L.E.s are, I think, sold out.

[12:16] You could try to go find one.

[12:17] They put some on the Metallica website.

[12:20] Those sold out within just a few minutes.

[12:23] Stern sold out right away.

[12:24] So if you got one, I think you might have something that for the first time in a long

[12:30] time is going to hold value.

[12:32] I do believe that this is not going to be a game that sells for 13 and then goes all the

[12:39] way down to 10.

[12:40] And the simple reason is it really is one of the few modern Stern games where there's

[12:46] only 500 L.E.s like of that version of the game.

[12:51] You know, there's twice as many John Wick L.E.s as Metallica L.E.s.

[12:55] And there's probably 20 times more demand for Metallica L.E. than John Wick L.E.

[13:01] I like the art package.

[13:03] Not crazy about the play field.

[13:05] I haven't seen enough of the new code, enough of the new animations to have an opinion there

[13:11] yet.

[13:12] But from what we have seen and the band's involvement in this game and the animations,

[13:18] they look to be pretty damn good.

[13:20] I think this is a really, really solid effort from Stern.

[13:23] I think they're going to have a lot of success with this game.

[13:27] So my overall thoughts on Metallica.

[13:30] I'm glad they went back to 500 L.E.s.

[13:33] I still think Stern lied to everybody when they said they were never making more L.E.s

[13:37] of a game that already has an L.E.

[13:40] I'm curious what loophole they found in their own heads.

[13:43] I think the cabinet is much nicer on this version of the game.

[13:47] I think the L.E. is far superior than the premium.

[13:51] But I do think the play field art is a let down.

[13:54] I do.

[13:55] I think Dirty Don is better.

[13:56] I think Dirty Don is kind of more fun and inviting.

[14:00] And I know they went for a little bit of a darker, edgier Metallica.

[14:04] They definitely achieved that.

[14:06] It's just not jumping out at me and inviting me in nearly as much as the Donny play field

[14:13] did.

[14:14] That being said, I think when we hear this game and see this game with modern sound,

[14:20] it's going to sound so much better than the original.

[14:23] I think when we see all the lights going with the expression kit, I think what we loved

[14:28] about the original is just going to be turned up a notch.

[14:32] And I think this is going to be one of those games that really is a keeper in people's

[14:37] collections.

[14:38] Because remember, the original Metallica L.E. never really came up for sale that often.

[14:44] And it was one of those games that was like bolted to people's floors.

[14:49] I fully expect this new one to be bolted to people's floors when the L.E.s start being

[14:55] made, I believe, in November.

[14:57] I don't know where the accessories are.

[14:59] I heard they were going to be available day one.

[15:01] I think they said they were going to be available after the first run of the game.

[15:05] So I think they will be available sometime November, December.

[15:08] All right, so let's read what you guys think of Metallica and see if we're on the same

[15:14] page here.

[15:15] So I heard from Speed Racer, he said, fantastic package and Metallica remastered.

[15:20] Now let's talk about this Lord of the Rings remastered.

[15:23] Come on, Kaneda, give George a call and make it happen.

[15:27] Why does John Wick get a thousand and hit like Metallica only 500?

[15:31] Well, look, look, here's the deal.

[15:33] I think Lord of the Rings is a licensing nightmare.

[15:36] I do know for a fact that John Borg is working on a Tron remake game.

[15:43] Now whether or not Stern goes down that road to allow Borg to do remakes while other designers

[15:49] are making new games, we shall see.

[15:52] But Tron is in the works.

[15:54] So if you have a Tron and you want 22,000 for your LE, you've been warned.

[16:01] Ryan Williams said, I think the LE looks great.

[16:04] Art side armor color palette, cool UV accents in the sculpts and play field we haven't seen

[16:10] before, just a stunner.

[16:13] Only three types of people can't see this as a banger, all of which I can agree with.

[16:19] From the machine currently and are sour about how much better this is, no intention to buy

[16:25] or enjoy playing hate the band and pissed off they missed out and they can't afford one.

[16:31] Ryan, thank you for your feedback.

[16:33] I think there's a lot of sour grapes by the people that are just trying to pump up the

[16:38] premium and here's the thing.

[16:40] Why pump up the premium?

[16:41] They're going to make it forever.

[16:43] Stern's going to make this game for years and that will chip away at the value of these

[16:48] LEs.

[16:49] Are we going to get sick of Metallica again?

[16:52] Ed Mara says, just talk to Mike and his crew from Automated.

[16:56] He has one or two Metallica LEs that are not spoken for.

[17:00] So if you're in the market, hit up Automated.

[17:02] All right, there you go.

[17:04] Automated might be your last chance to get an LE.

[17:08] Scotties says, nothing special, just a rebrand on an old machine.

[17:14] Plus it is on Spike 2.

[17:16] Then Spike 3 is around the corner.

[17:18] Also an LE of a remastered game.

[17:21] Skip the LE by the premium if you must.

[17:24] An LE of a remastered machine is not an LE.

[17:29] Also why spend your money on this when there are many great machines coming up?

[17:33] All right, first of all, Scotties, let's just stop there.

[17:35] I don't agree with you.

[17:36] It is an LE.

[17:37] They're only making 500.

[17:39] How can you say an LE of an old game is no longer an LE?

[17:44] An LE just means limited edition.

[17:47] They're making 500.

[17:48] And also Scotties, to say like, why buy this when there's so many great games coming?

[17:53] I'll tell you why, Scotties, because we know this is a great game.

[17:58] We don't know anything down the road is going to be great.

[18:02] There might be some great themes, but we know that Metallica is a masterpiece.

[18:07] There's a reason why in the top 100, Metallica is number 15.

[18:12] All right, Kirby's Beer Store says, don't give them a free pass on going against their word.

[18:17] This is the same game.

[18:19] Well, Kirby, I hope you enjoyed the beginning of this show because I did not give them a free pass.

[18:25] Paul said, spell Metallica to light injustice for all.

[18:29] That's a really cool added feature without taking away from anything.

[18:33] Yeah, I really like that Metallica sign behind the guy in the electric chair

[18:38] and the letters light up one at a time.

[18:41] Really, really cool.

[18:43] I think this thing's going to look neat gang when you guys stand over it in person.

[18:47] Robert Cicchini, I think I said that right.

[18:50] The features video would have been better if it stepped through the whole game, not just the changes.

[18:56] Most people today were not into pinball when the original Metallica came out.

[19:01] So may not be familiar with it.

[19:03] Well, that's a good point, Robert.

[19:05] There is this assumption that you know what's being remastered.

[19:08] But I would also argue that most people are not new.

[19:13] While there's been an influx of new people over the last few years,

[19:16] the majority of people have been in this for a while.

[19:19] Adam has said it's 13 K.

[19:22] It's a 12 year old game and it's $13,000.

[19:26] Did I mention it's $13,000?

[19:29] I'm concerned the precedents this sets for redoing more old games,

[19:35] not because of the sinking prices of pissed off customers,

[19:39] but because I want new, innovative games.

[19:42] It's like going to the movies these days and being stuck with remakes.

[19:46] Adam makes a really good point here.

[19:49] There's zero R&D costs for the majority of this game.

[19:53] I know they had to do animations and other things,

[19:56] but the lion's share of the work was done on this game 12 years ago.

[20:01] All of the code, right?

[20:03] 98% of this code was done 12 years ago.

[20:08] And 12 years ago, Metallica LE was like $6,500.

[20:14] So fast forward, the games twice as much money

[20:19] and required a third of the work to get there.

[20:23] Now, Adam, what I would say to that though is this.

[20:27] A classic game, an amazing game, will remain an amazing game 12 years later.

[20:34] You know, Lord of the Rings keeps getting brought up.

[20:36] If they made Lord of the Rings now with new artwork, new lighting,

[20:41] new sound, new animations, right?

[20:44] If they brought that exact game back but made everything better,

[20:49] people would fight to get one of those LEs.

[20:52] Those LEs would sell for $15,000 to $20,000

[20:56] if they only made 500 more Lord of the Rings LEs.

[21:01] So you're not wrong with everything being so expensive now.

[21:06] Think about it, like an Avatar CE,

[21:09] which I believe is a beautiful game but kind of a boring game.

[21:13] Avatar is never going to be a better pinball machine than Metallica

[21:17] and they want $15,000 for it.

[21:20] I get it's got new stuff.

[21:22] I get it's got more innovation.

[21:24] It's got better lighting.

[21:25] It's a better platform, all this stuff.

[21:27] It's got better stuff on the screen.

[21:28] It's got a billion dollar movie in muted clips.

[21:31] It's got all that stuff but Metallica might just be more fun.

[21:35] The game might just be better even though Jersey Jack

[21:38] throws more money at the product.

[21:40] All right, Wolfgang Hager says,

[21:42] game looks amazing, especially the LE.

[21:45] The UV stuff is a dream for me.

[21:47] I'm slightly worried that the callouts don't sound

[21:50] as good as the original.

[21:52] Only heard a couple so far, not a deal breaker.

[21:55] Original callouts were perfect.

[21:58] Hoping a few more songs get added via code update.

[22:01] I'm getting an LE, a huge Metallica fan.

[22:05] PS, shame there's no wires on top of Sparky.

[22:09] Wolfgang, I'm happy you're getting an LE

[22:11] and I think what I noticed with all the feedback

[22:14] is if you get an LE, you are gonna be excited

[22:18] and you're gonna be happy and you're gonna say stuff

[22:20] that's positive.

[22:21] If you're not and you're mad at Stern for lying

[22:24] about making more LEs, you're gonna be negative

[22:27] and you're gonna be angry.

[22:28] Friend of the show, Joe Abadi, I like Joe a lot

[22:31] but he sent me this message on Facebook today.

[22:33] He's like, you're an idiot for supporting

[22:36] this Metallica game.

[22:37] He called me an idiot and I wrote back to him.

[22:40] I'm said, Joe, that's a really nasty word

[22:42] and you shouldn't talk to me like that.

[22:44] Like I did nothing to you, Joe.

[22:47] And Joe is one of these guys who just hates Stern Pinball now.

[22:51] He like hates everything Stern Pinball does now.

[22:54] It doesn't matter what they do.

[22:56] And I don't wanna be in this hobby

[22:58] where I just broadly hate a company

[23:00] and everything they do.

[23:02] It takes a lot for me to feel that way about a company

[23:05] and you know which company I'm talking about

[23:07] and they had a little issue with Dennis Nordman today.

[23:10] You gotta go read that story.

[23:12] I think Dennis Nordman is realizing

[23:14] what other people have realized a long time ago

[23:17] and there's good people and there's bad people.

[23:21] And in the end, people are not gonna be able

[23:23] to hide their true colors, okay?

[23:25] Whenever Stern does these remakes

[23:26] or brings more LEDs into the world,

[23:29] it's gonna be a very polarizing response to it.

[23:32] Errol said, still several OG premiums for sale on Pinside

[23:36] for more than the remastered.

[23:38] Yeah, gang, if you're trying to sell

[23:40] an old Metallica premium for like 10 grand,

[23:45] that ship has sailed.

[23:47] Your game is now worth like 7,500.

[23:50] Just realize that and accept it.

[23:53] There's no going back to those old prices for the OG machine.

[23:57] 904 Pimball Zine said, smart move by Stern and Metallica.

[24:02] There are new collectors of Pimball machines yearly.

[24:05] In 10 plus years, there are many new prospective buyers

[24:09] that haven't had the previous iteration.

[24:11] I agree with him.

[24:12] I think there's a lot of people that just didn't have it.

[24:15] And now they have a chance to get one.

[24:17] The irony is they're gonna end up paying

[24:20] what they would have had to pay to get the original LE

[24:23] because they were selling right now for around $13,000.

[24:27] Rakeem Sanders says, I sold my Metallica Pro five years ago

[24:31] and have been regretting it since.

[24:34] I am no longer regretting that decision.

[24:36] Take my money, Stern.

[24:38] Curtis Robbins says, I only wish Stern would put this much

[24:42] time and effort into their new titles.

[24:44] And what's the deal with releasing it so close to X-Men?

[24:48] Geez, the pros are not even on location yet.

[24:51] Well, Curtis, here's the thing.

[24:53] I do think Stern is putting this much attention

[24:56] into their new titles.

[24:57] Their new titles have been pretty damn good.

[25:00] X-Men, Jaws, yeah, there's some misses theme-wise,

[25:04] but man, look at X-Men.

[25:06] That game really is much better than people realize.

[25:10] And now that Stern is sort of pushing Wison to the side

[25:13] and bringing in more people to help on the code,

[25:16] I think you're gonna see a really good game in the end.

[25:20] Keith Collin says, I ordered the LE as my first LE

[25:24] I have bought, mostly to get the only acceptable art package.

[25:28] Well, Keith, I agree it is the best artwork.

[25:31] Lone Ranger says, you told us this was going to happen

[25:34] over a year ago.

[25:35] Glad I sold my premium when I did.

[25:38] Well, I'm glad you sold it

[25:40] and I'm glad you listened to Canada.

[25:42] 60% of the time, I'm right all of the time.

[25:45] ElectricWizzie says, the one time I love an LE,

[25:49] he says the art package looks amazing

[25:51] and Stern limits the run to 500.

[25:54] Hans Milberger says, love it,

[25:56] this layout is one of the best.

[25:58] There was no need to start from scratch.

[26:00] Happy to be getting an LCD,

[26:03] more songs and insider connected on Metallica,

[26:06] ordering a premium.

[26:08] We didn't even talk about the fact

[26:10] that now the Metallica's got insider connected,

[26:13] it's definitely gonna add to the replay value of the game

[26:17] and that's just something the OG game

[26:19] will never really have.

[26:20] You just can't put the OG game onto insider connected

[26:24] and that is a huge, huge, huge reason why.

[26:27] I think this new game is gonna be popular.

[26:29] Kyle said, at 13K, doesn't hold up to modern games.

[26:35] Compared to two other band pins,

[26:37] Foo and Iron Maiden both have better theme,

[26:41] both have more interesting layout,

[26:43] both have modern code.

[26:45] You can get a Foo LE for 9,000.

[26:49] I don't think anyone can say Metallica is better game,

[26:52] a more iconic band, but not a better pin.

[26:56] Now Kyle has a point here.

[26:58] I would add guns and roses into the mix,

[27:00] the forever declining in value guns and roses,

[27:03] but does Metallica feel dated?

[27:06] It's a fan layout, it's Lyman Sheets code.

[27:09] Now I don't think code wise, Metallica is dated.

[27:14] It does have maybe some chopping wood elements to it,

[27:18] but what Metallica has that maybe Foo Fighters doesn't have

[27:22] is Metallica really gets you going.

[27:25] It has pinball moments that are amazing.

[27:28] When you start the multi-balls in Metallica,

[27:31] it really energizes you.

[27:34] And I think that's what pinball is all about.

[27:37] Just because you've got a new layout

[27:39] doesn't mean your game is exciting.

[27:42] And I think that's why people love Metallica.

[27:45] It's how it makes them feel when they play it.

[27:48] And I've played Foo Fighters a bunch,

[27:50] but I'm not sure Foo Fighters has those same moments

[27:54] that get you going as much as Metallica does.

[27:58] Here's the thing, I almost hate selling one against the other.

[28:01] I just think they're both great games.

[28:03] And I think stern pinball with Iron Maiden,

[28:06] Metallica and Foo Fighters,

[28:07] I think if you're fans of all three of those bands,

[28:11] you are super happy.

[28:13] You're not upset about anything.

[28:15] And maybe we all need to get a little bit more positive

[28:18] and not say that Metallica sucks because Foo's better.

[28:23] I mean, it's weird.

[28:24] It's like, I think fans of Guns N' Roses,

[28:27] Metallica, ACDC, Iron Maiden, Foo Fighters,

[28:32] I think all of them, Elton John even,

[28:35] if you're fans of those musical acts,

[28:38] you are so happy that you got an amazing pinball game

[28:42] that is based on the band you love.

[28:45] I don't think Aerosmith is great.

[28:47] I don't think Kiss is a great game.

[28:49] You know, I don't think Led Zeppelin is incredible,

[28:51] but the latter of machines I mentioned,

[28:54] all of those fan bases should be super happy.

[28:57] Anthony Fresalone said, art looks amazing on the LE.

[29:01] Kind of wish it was a redesigned machine though.

[29:04] Wonder how much of a hit the old LE's

[29:07] are gonna take on the used market now.

[29:09] They're gonna take a lot.

[29:11] I think an LE, OG, before this game came out,

[29:15] you're looking at $13,000 all day long,

[29:19] maybe 15 depending on how good of condition it's in,

[29:22] or if there's any mods.

[29:24] I think now the original LE's

[29:26] are gonna settle somewhere around 10 to 11,

[29:30] and I think these things

[29:31] are gonna hold pretty damn strong around 13.

[29:35] I think if you wanna get one now,

[29:36] if it is really sold out,

[29:39] I do think people might be able to get a grander

[29:42] to over sticker if the demand is really there.

[29:46] I don't know, the market will do what the market does, people.

[29:48] Kirby's Beer Store said,

[29:51] not enough there for me to convince.

[29:53] You know what's getting out, you gotta say this.

[29:55] I'm trying to read your comments word for word,

[29:58] and the problem is there's so many grammatical mistakes

[30:01] when you guys write,

[30:03] and I'm just trying to speak out loud what I'm reading,

[30:06] and I have to go back and do it again and again

[30:08] and again and make up for your grammatical mistakes,

[30:11] which is why editing this show

[30:12] is gonna be a nightmare for me,

[30:14] and it's all because of you.

[30:15] Learn to write better.

[30:16] Read what you wrote before you hit send.

[30:19] So Kirby said, not enough there to convince him

[30:21] to spend 10 or 13,000.

[30:23] No one looks at the LCD while playing,

[30:26] and different sculpts are cool,

[30:28] but Nunes will wear off.

[30:30] I'm most excited about getting a deal on the old version.

[30:34] Well, Kirby, you're gonna get a deal,

[30:36] and people do look at the LCD screen.

[30:39] I don't know what you're talking about.

[30:40] You know, it's like, did you never look at the metallic

[30:43] at DMD screen while you were playing?

[30:45] Of course you did, because Lyman sheets,

[30:48] people, don't forget this.

[30:50] Lyman always coded his games in ways

[30:53] in which you did get to enjoy what was on the screen.

[30:57] He knew how to insert stuff

[30:59] and create little moments of pause in gameplay

[31:03] so you could really celebrate what's going on on the screen,

[31:08] and that's what happens, right,

[31:10] when balls are stuck on magnets

[31:11] and you get to watch something,

[31:13] a guy in an electric chair building up to a multi-ball.

[31:16] You're watching that on the screen,

[31:18] so do not say that nobody looks at the screen.

[31:22] So Dan Keller said, I want one, wow.

[31:25] Will Ware said, the Ellie is already harder

[31:27] to get than Alice on day one.

[31:29] I like it, but I don't $13,000 like it.

[31:33] Looking forward to picking up an OG premium.

[31:36] Well, here's the thing, nobody likes $13,000, right?

[31:38] None of these games are worth $13,000.

[31:41] None of them are worth $15,000, none of them.

[31:44] We just have to spend that now.

[31:46] If you knew a way to get one cheaper, please let me know.

[31:50] Ken Chilada said, I hate that there are more

[31:52] metallic Ellie's in the world, even if it's remastered.

[31:56] It's a bad move he used to curse word,

[31:58] I'm not gonna say it, when customers paid you

[32:01] for exclusivity, buying direct is for suckers these days.

[32:06] Yeah, I mean, Ken, I kind of agree.

[32:07] I think they screwed over all the original Ellie owners.

[32:10] They just did.

[32:11] RJ said, looks pretty good, not sure on the Sparky replacement

[32:15] reminds me of Jeff Dunham's Puppet a little.

[32:18] You know what it reminds me of?

[32:20] Coco, the Disney movie, like the day of the dead characters.

[32:24] It reminds me of someone from that movie.

[32:26] I absolutely agree with you RJ.

[32:28] I think the old Sparky looks better.

[32:30] Here's what's crazy, Shane told the next comment,

[32:33] new Sparky is way better and actually looks like

[32:36] this skeleton on the back of the original ride,

[32:39] the lightning shirt.

[32:41] New modes and call outs are going to put this over the top.

[32:44] Original artwork was a big miss, we just got used to it.

[32:48] New art, especially foil is killer and stoked

[32:52] for only 500 Ellie's, bring back FOMO.

[32:55] Yeah, we didn't mention that this artwork is gonna be

[32:58] on foiled decals, which is gonna really pop.

[33:02] I get this sense that Shane is in on an Ellie.

[33:04] Does anyone else get that sense?

[33:05] He absolutely over the top loves everything about the game

[33:10] and he wants FOMO to be back.

[33:11] That sounds like someone in on an Ellie.

[33:14] E-rock, you, Ikea, who are these people?

[33:18] I mean, I'm reading the names of my club members.

[33:20] I'm convinced half of them are bots.

[33:23] It looks great and with Ray Day on code,

[33:25] it could be as deep as Rush.

[33:28] Well, look, Ray Day's not really doing that much.

[33:31] He's adding just these new things.

[33:32] I'm not into the music, but that will be okay.

[33:36] If it shoots good, it's not something I would buy

[33:39] without playing it first.

[33:40] So this guy sounds pretty new to pinball, right?

[33:42] It's like, it's a fan layout.

[33:44] Metallica shoots great.

[33:46] It's a really inviting, easy game to play

[33:49] and you know exactly where the shots are

[33:51] and you know exactly what you need to do and what to hit.

[33:54] Adam says, looks like an awesome game.

[33:57] I just don't love Metallica enough to drop the money.

[34:00] Dan says, I thought Stern wasn't making

[34:03] any more new limited edition games.

[34:06] Kind of feel bad for the OGLE owners.

[34:09] Mike Peterson says, art is awesome.

[34:11] LCD is awesome.

[34:13] Overall, awesome.

[34:14] However, Sparky Big Miss.

[34:16] There was something special about the original Sparky,

[34:19] just an amazing character.

[34:21] The skull looks a little goofy, almost like it's smiling.

[34:24] It looks like something you would buy from the dollar store.

[34:28] Well, Mike, the good news is the mod community,

[34:30] that thing is gonna be fixed

[34:32] and they're gonna make him even cooler.

[34:34] Mark Thornton says, everything about this game

[34:36] looks better than the original.

[34:38] UV lighting is a nice touch.

[34:40] New Sparky looks way better.

[34:42] Ordered an LE yesterday after you gave me FOMO.

[34:46] Happy Mark, I'm glad I get zero commission

[34:48] on driving all these sales for Stern Pinball.

[34:51] Miles Cameron said, glad I sold my old premium.

[34:55] This one is really gonna hurt resell price of the old game.

[34:58] Miles, I couldn't agree more.

[35:01] Fubier said, I always wanted to own a Metallica,

[35:04] but never wanted to pay such a high price

[35:06] for an older game.

[35:07] This version has all the updates to make the price worth it,

[35:11] because it's a new game with all the modern bells

[35:14] and whistles.

[35:15] Well, Fubier, are you telling me

[35:19] that you'd rather spend $13,000 on this Metallica LE

[35:23] instead of $6,500 on the old LE?

[35:26] I don't think there's any way

[35:28] to really justify these high prices.

[35:30] There just isn't.

[35:31] We just have to accept it

[35:32] because there's no other option.

[35:34] Bob N said, you ruined it for me

[35:37] with the Mount Rushmore comment.

[35:39] That's all I can see now.

[35:41] Well, Bob, it's true.

[35:42] They look like they're on Mount Rushmore,

[35:45] and it's horrible.

[35:46] And I just don't love the translate in that premium.

[35:49] Frank Max said, Stern did a fantastic job

[35:52] remastering a true pinball gem all in on an LE.

[35:56] Brian Millard said, I love the new Metallica LE so much so,

[36:00] I should probably get one.

[36:02] With that said, anyone want to buy my Wizard of Oz

[36:05] or Star Trek LE?

[36:07] You know, Brian, you bring up an interesting point.

[36:09] I think most people are out of space.

[36:12] So to get this game into game rooms, think about it.

[36:15] That means like there's probably gonna be

[36:17] a few hundred collector games hitting the market,

[36:22] you know, over the next few weeks.

[36:23] And it's just gonna keep getting worse and worse

[36:26] with the oversaturation as more old collectible games

[36:29] are put up for sale.

[36:31] And then you've got all these new games that need buyers.

[36:34] I don't know how it sustains itself.

[36:37] All right, two more.

[36:37] Dave Sanders says, does the job.

[36:41] A man a few words.

[36:42] Not my cup of tea, but it looks like a definitive addition.

[36:47] Nate Scorupa says, I like the original's cartoon art

[36:51] and sparky better.

[36:53] This looks flat with the black and white and zombies.

[36:57] Nate, I don't disagree.

[36:59] I actually agree 100%.

[37:01] I don't think this new play field and the scopes

[37:04] are colorful, are inviting and jump out at you.

[37:08] They do look more sterile,

[37:10] a little bit more boring and docile.

[37:13] I think the mod community is gonna have a field day

[37:17] enhancing that part of the game.

[37:20] Everybody, I know this show went a little long.

[37:22] I just wanted to read some of your feedback.

[37:24] I don't always do that.

[37:26] I wanna thank each and every one of you for the support.

[37:29] It means the world to me.

[37:30] It is the week of expo, right?

[37:32] It's gonna be a very exciting week in pinball.

[37:35] I wanna say what I love the most about this hobby

[37:37] is how it brings people together.

[37:39] And we're gonna see that this week in spades.

[37:43] A lot of people are gonna be hanging out

[37:45] that haven't seen each other in a long time.

[37:47] We take all the stupidity from the message boards,

[37:50] from the Facebook pages, from pin side,

[37:52] and you get to hang out with people in real life.

[37:55] In real life, everybody is super cool, super chill.

[37:59] It's a lot of fun to get together.

[38:01] The number one problem in the world today,

[38:03] do you know what it is with young kids?

[38:05] It's loneliness.

[38:06] It's an epidemic in America.

[38:09] And the one thing that cures all loneliness are hobbies.

[38:13] They bring people together.

[38:14] As long as this thing exists,

[38:16] as long as these companies make these games,

[38:19] we are gonna have a reason to connect on a daily basis.

[38:22] I don't know about you, but I don't feel lonely.

[38:24] I've got friends all over the world because of this show.

[38:28] And I consider each and every one of you

[38:31] to be a friend of the show.

[38:32] And I love it.

[38:33] I love the conversations I have.

[38:35] I love that we get to critique these games.

[38:37] And I just want these companies to deliver games

[38:40] that are worthy of this much money

[38:42] and also stop lying to us.

[38:44] I still think they never should have made

[38:46] more Metallica at least.

[38:47] And yet here we are.

[38:49] Everybody have a great week at Expo.

[38:51] More shows are coming this week.

[38:52] You know it, Canada Out.

[38:53] For us to live in the land.

[38:56] To lead my way.

[39:01] To both the people who live in the land.

[39:09] For us to live in the land.

[39:17] For us to live in the land.

[39:23] For us to live in the land.
