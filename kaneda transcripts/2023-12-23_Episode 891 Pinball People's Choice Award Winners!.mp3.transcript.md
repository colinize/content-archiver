[00:00] I'll take your hat, your hair, looks wild.

[00:04] Mind if I move in canada.

[00:08] What's the sense of hurt in my pride?

[00:11] Well, baby don't hold out.

[00:13] Baby it's cold outside.

[00:17] Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

[00:22] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:24] I'm your host, Kanada.

[00:25] Happy Holidays, everybody.

[00:27] I hope you're spending it with your families.

[00:29] I hope you're staying off of the online drama that can never escape Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:35] And look, we haven't done as many shows this week again because I'm enjoying so much time

[00:39] with Brenda, her sisters, Kaleon.

[00:41] It's that time of year and we all have to learn how to turn off all the negativity and

[00:46] just enjoy what we love about this hobby.

[00:49] And there's a lot about to happen in pinball.

[00:51] Who amongst you just can't wait for Jaws to come out and blow up every old conversation

[00:56] we've been having about 2023?

[00:59] Now we did do our People's Choice Awards and I'm going to announce for you on this episode

[01:05] all the winners of the People's Choice Awards.

[01:08] It's the only pinball show at the end of the year where the pinball people got to decide.

[01:14] We will see like how close we are to selecting the winners when, I don't know, when the Twippies

[01:20] one day announces who's going to win their awards, which used to be in March, but we

[01:24] don't know now.

[01:25] We don't know now.

[01:26] We don't know how many people are even going to contribute, but this is how it always should

[01:29] be at the end of the year.

[01:32] Let's just look back and celebrate what came out the year prior.

[01:35] Alright, before we do that though, we've got some news items I want to discuss and I have

[01:40] some news for each and every one of you.

[01:43] I'm reading on Naps Arcade what I told you was going to happen.

[01:47] Two things I'm reading on Naps that we talked about for a while.

[01:50] One of them is that PadreDi Gaming is that Rick over at Planetary signed a deal with

[01:55] PadreDi Gaming and they're going to make remakes of Bally Williams games.

[02:01] Now I've been saying this now for a really long time.

[02:04] I'm happy that it's up on Naps Arcade because now it's like official.

[02:08] They are forming the Euro pinball corporation.

[02:11] Sounds so formal.

[02:13] And here's what I am hearing.

[02:15] Not only are these games going to be made using Fast Pinball board, so congratulations

[02:20] Aaron at Fast Pinball.

[02:22] He's going to be making more money a year now than Keith Elwin.

[02:25] I love it.

[02:26] I love that Robin on pinside makes more money than every single pinball designer.

[02:31] It's incredible.

[02:32] You know, sometimes the best way to make money is be on the peripheral of the thing people

[02:37] love.

[02:38] You know, you want to make that Intel chip.

[02:39] Don't make the computer make the chip that runs every computer.

[02:44] That's where the money lies people.

[02:46] Don't make a pinball podcast.

[02:48] Make the software that people need to podcast.

[02:50] Alright, so let's talk about this for a minute.

[02:53] So now in a world in which we already have so many games coming out.

[02:58] We have so many people running out of room.

[03:02] We're going to throw more remakes into the mix.

[03:05] Now you kind of have to look at this and say it makes sense because Chicago Gaming Company,

[03:09] the delays are just abysmal.

[03:12] You got to wonder like how long are these guys going to hang on always making people

[03:17] wait over a year more than a year.

[03:19] Usually by the time you put your deposit down you are not getting your game for more than

[03:24] a year.

[03:25] It is probably one of the biggest delayed companies in the history of pinball.

[03:30] Sure they make a great product, but what does this mean now for the future of these

[03:34] Bally Williams remakes?

[03:36] Because here's the other part.

[03:38] If you've collected medieval madness and you have Attack for Mars and you have Monster

[03:42] Bash and you have Cactus Canyon made by CGC, do you think you're going to get as good,

[03:48] if not better, a quality of product from the European team over there?

[03:54] Is Padready Gaming of the same caliber and the same quality as Chicago Gaming Company?

[04:00] Do not forget something people.

[04:01] Chicago Gaming Company was Churchill and Churchill made all the cabinets and all the playfields

[04:07] for a stern pinball and Churchill quality is amazing.

[04:11] So is the quality over at Padready Gaming as good as it is at CGC?

[04:17] The other thing is this, it says Chicago Gaming Company on all those games and Chicago Gaming

[04:23] Company would go and still make those games look like throwback games with DMD dots and

[04:29] there was a lot of work done by Chicago Gaming Company to make the remakes not only look

[04:34] like the throwback games but make them a little bit better.

[04:37] The screens were bigger but they still were DMD dots and they did a lot of work redoing

[04:43] all of those DMDs from those classic games and putting them into the modern versions

[04:48] of the remakes.

[04:50] Now what's going to happen over at European Pinball Corp?

[04:53] Are they going to do that?

[04:54] Are they going to go widescreen with the DMD?

[04:56] Are they going to go more traditional LCD screen that we're seeing in games today?

[05:00] A lot of questions to be answered.

[05:03] Now here's what I'm going to tell you right now in Canada's Pinball Podcast that nobody

[05:06] knows yet.

[05:07] The rumor is they're making one Valley Williams remake game next year.

[05:13] People are saying it's Twilight Zone.

[05:15] Remember how many times I told you Twilight Zone?

[05:17] I'm not here to tell you what the themes are but I think it's going to be a very popular

[05:22] theme.

[05:23] Is it going to be Medieval Madness?

[05:25] I know that Planetary had the parts for Medieval Madness and I think that's going to be the

[05:30] first game we see is Medieval Madness remade again because the parts were already ordered

[05:37] by Planetary and I think we're going to see this new company come out of the gate with

[05:42] Medieval Madness.

[05:43] But here's the other part I'm about to tell you.

[05:45] They're not just making one Valley Williams remake next year.

[05:49] They are making two.

[05:51] Alright so here we go.

[05:52] What's it going to be?

[05:53] I know people would love to get a Theater of Magic or a Toten.

[05:57] I know people would love maybe to get a brand new Adams family.

[06:00] I don't think it's going to be Adams family because of the licensing.

[06:03] I think it's going to be more of an original IP Valley Williams game.

[06:07] This is all happening right?

[06:09] This is all happening and at the same time we know that the Pinball Brothers are going

[06:14] to be coming out with another music pin.

[06:16] I'm hearing the music pin they're coming out with is going to be Scorpions, you know Wind

[06:21] of Change.

[06:23] And so just think about this for a moment.

[06:26] European Pinball Corporation, Pinball Brothers, just that entity alone might have two to three

[06:31] games coming out in one year.

[06:34] We're going to see another game from Dutch Pinball.

[06:37] We're going to see how many games from Stern.

[06:39] We're going to have to see a new game from Jersey Jack because Elton John is not selling.

[06:43] We've got two new games from Spooky Pinball.

[06:46] We're going to get another game from Multimorphic.

[06:49] We're obviously going to have to get another game from American Pinball or American Pinball

[06:53] will close its doors.

[06:54] Like that has to happen.

[06:56] And you start to add up all these games.

[06:58] And I'm probably missing a company or two as I list all these games.

[07:03] And then you have to head scratch and be like, how can this hobby absorb all of these games?

[07:10] How can this hobby make like eight to 12 games a year?

[07:14] The truth is, and we all know this at most, this hobby only needs about three to four

[07:20] new titles a year.

[07:22] That's all it can really absorb when you think about the fact that people have to free up

[07:27] room and free up money to buy these games.

[07:31] And if you're a distro, just think about it.

[07:33] Like where do you even invest?

[07:35] I didn't even mention Haggis and Centaurs are coming out.

[07:38] Add that into the mix.

[07:39] And then all of a sudden you realize there's just like way too much.

[07:44] There's too many offerings and the cream will rise to the top.

[07:49] And we know the other rumor Jason Knapp said, which I've been saying here at

[07:53] Kinect is pinball podcast for a while is Jaws pinball will be at CES on January 9th.

[08:00] And so if the year kicks off with Keith Elwin and his game is as good as everybody's saying

[08:06] it's going to be, and he sells like five to 7000 versions of Jaws pinball, that's going

[08:12] to eat up five to 7000 pieces of real estate that people have in their homes and on location

[08:20] and also is going to take tens of millions of dollars out of the potential pinball buying

[08:25] monetary market.

[08:27] And so then what's going to happen there, right?

[08:29] I mean, Stern is going to be the one who gets all of the money right away when 2024 starts.

[08:35] And how many of you have forgotten that you also are going to owe fairly soon a check for

[08:42] around $10,000 to buy your pulp fiction?

[08:46] And how many of you through the holiday seasons?

[08:49] I don't know about you.

[08:50] I know about me.

[08:50] Every time you go out, every time you do anything, every time you cross the street in this damn

[08:55] city, you're spending a ton of money.

[08:58] And so a lot more money is going out than ever before.

[09:02] And I don't know about you, but how many of us have increased what we earn since 2019?

[09:09] 40% on top of what we were earning.

[09:11] And so it's a very expensive world.

[09:14] We each have to start making very selective choices on what we're going to invest in.

[09:20] And as excited as I am for the pinball market landscape of 2024, I'm very excited.

[09:26] I'm just wondering to myself, who is going to buy all of these games?

[09:31] And I'm going to throw another news item into the mix.

[09:34] Another game is coming out.

[09:36] It is a mystery game I've been talking about.

[09:38] I said it's going to be beautiful.

[09:40] I said it's going to be aimed towards collectors.

[09:42] I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is, but I'll tell you this.

[09:45] I'll give you a little bit of a hint because I'm starting to hear from some of my friends

[09:49] overseas and they're sort of catching wind about this title.

[09:52] This is going to be a game that is by a designer from the Valley Williams Air.

[09:57] And this is going to be a game that you probably thought would never see the light of day.

[10:01] And it's coming out.

[10:03] This one's going to be very limited.

[10:05] It's going to be targeting collectors.

[10:07] And I think the way they're going about it is smart.

[10:10] And I think it's going to work because again, very limited in a world in which all of these

[10:15] games are over saturating the market and there's too many le's everywhere.

[10:20] I think if you go this approach and you make only this many a small number and the game

[10:25] has to deliver, I mean, it didn't work with James Bond 60th, which is kind of crazy when

[10:29] you think about it.

[10:30] James Bond, Keith Elwyn, all the James Bond IP into that game.

[10:36] You know, I think the reason James Bond 60th just didn't work is there's no denying the

[10:40] fact that when you stand over the game, it just feels cheap.

[10:43] Like there's nothing about it that feels like it's worth 20,000 or $15,000.

[10:49] And that's really what happened with James Bond 60th.

[10:52] If James Bond 60th came out and it was priced where it should have been, which is like 8,500

[10:58] and only 500 of you can get one, each one would have been worth like 13 to $14,000 on

[11:04] the second hand market.

[11:06] And look what happened now.

[11:07] That's where the price is at.

[11:09] Like it's so stupid.

[11:10] Stern should have passed that value onto the customer.

[11:13] Instead they burned everybody that bought one.

[11:16] All right, so that's what's happening.

[11:17] You know, we've got more games coming from Europe.

[11:20] We've got Jaws right around the corner.

[11:22] I can't wait for Jaws as somebody that's been taking so many personal attacks this holiday

[11:28] season.

[11:29] I just can't wait for Jaws to come out.

[11:32] I want to thank everybody on Pinside for 10 more pages of telling me how I'm an attention

[11:39] seeking narcissist.

[11:41] Thank you everybody for working hard to inflate my ego.

[11:45] Every page they put up about me on Pinside is another layer of my narcissistic castle

[11:50] that they keep building for me rent free.

[11:54] They act on my behalf and they just send more people to Canadian Pinball podcast.

[11:59] We are now over 700 paid subscribers.

[12:02] Thank you so much everybody.

[12:03] And then we're at the end of the year.

[12:04] So let's talk about the winners of the 2023 first ever pinball people's choice awards.

[12:11] We did this on Facebook.

[12:13] Polling was opened up for a few days.

[12:15] I did a fun show with Jengas yesterday.

[12:18] Check it out.

[12:19] And once we talk about all of these in length, be warned it is in length.

[12:23] It was over an hour and a half.

[12:25] And you know me, I like short digestible content, but I wanted to join Jengas on his show and

[12:31] we had a good time going back and forth.

[12:33] But don't worry, Canadian fans, I'm never going to turn into a 90 minute back and forth

[12:38] content creator when it comes to pinball.

[12:40] I will always get right to it.

[12:42] So let's get right to it.

[12:43] And I'm only going to tell you who won in each category.

[12:46] And we will see how closely this aligns to the Twippies, but at least we can deliver

[12:51] these results as they were voted by each and every one of you.

[12:55] I also recused myself from the categories because I did not want there to be any controversy

[13:01] that there was bias or I was starting an award show to give myself an award.

[13:06] The Twippies are dead.

[13:07] I remain on the iron throne of pinball podcasters for all eternity.

[13:14] Nobody can ever beat me now, which is more amazing than having a show every year in which

[13:18] I have to keep working hard to maintain my title.

[13:20] All right.

[13:21] Best homebrew machine with 38% goes to 8 ball beyond.

[13:27] Congratulations to 8 ball beyond.

[13:29] That game is stunning.

[13:31] If you haven't seen it, Google 8 ball beyond and look at that homebrew machine.

[13:36] Very, very stunning machine.

[13:38] The best rule set in a game with 37% of the votes goes to Tanya and Ray Day for Foo Fighters.

[13:47] You know, it's always hard to beat stern pinball in these people's choice awards because so

[13:51] many people own stern machines, but we will see some upsets that I was not expecting in

[13:57] this people's choice awards in which Stern did not take it.

[14:00] Favorite pinball streamer.

[14:02] There are many streamers out there with 32% a new person to the pinball streaming world,

[14:08] Jamie over at Wormhole Pinball.

[14:12] Now Jamie, congratulations.

[14:14] You clearly mobilized the Wormhole fan base to get those votes in and that's the way that

[14:20] people vote it.

[14:21] I know there's always a little bit of controversy with the content creators because it's like,

[14:25] yeah, we're all lobbying for votes, but that's just the way it works.

[14:29] It's like the all star game in Major League Baseball.

[14:32] The fans vote and if you play in New York, you're just going to have more fans than a

[14:36] team that plays in Pittsburgh.

[14:39] It's just the people's choice.

[14:40] This is what the people consider to be the best based on the people's populace.

[14:44] All right.

[14:45] So next best callouts in a game.

[14:48] This one is not surprising because the callouts are coming from famous Hollywood actors in

[14:53] one of the most iconic movies of all time and a movie with some of the most iconic lines

[14:58] ever.

[14:59] It's no other than 44% for Pulp Fiction.

[15:03] This game is not shipped to a single person and it is going to win a few categories in

[15:08] 2023.

[15:09] But again, I think it's well deserved.

[15:11] Remember Pulp Fiction came out.

[15:13] It sold out instantly.

[15:15] We didn't see any other game have that level of hype all year round.

[15:19] The best sound package in a game with 34% goes to the Foo Fighters.

[15:25] If you've played this game, the sound is phenomenal.

[15:29] The moment you hit start, that game pulls you in in such an awesome way.

[15:34] We're going to hear the Foo Fighters be called out a few more times as you can guess, but

[15:38] Jack Danger and the team over there, Tanya, Rayday, the inaugural effort, Zombie Yeti

[15:43] made the art package on this game.

[15:45] Jack Danger's inaugural game is going to win a lot and I think it's well deserved and

[15:51] this game just sort of blew everybody away because when we heard the name Foo Fighters,

[15:56] we were not expecting much and I think Stern did such a great job letting this team be

[16:01] extra creative in making a wow game.

[16:04] We had a new category, Best News Site.

[16:06] The reason why I wanted to do Best News Site is that Pinside wins every single year and

[16:12] it's a form, it's not a news site.

[16:14] I wanted to give this man a chance to be in a category with other news pinball websites

[16:20] like Pinball News, we had Kinetisys, we had Nudge Magazine, but with 93% of the votes.

[16:27] This is the largest margin of victory out of all of the categories of this year's People's

[16:33] Choice Award.

[16:34] 93% of you said Naps Arcade is the number one pinball news site.

[16:40] I don't know what the other 7% of you were thinking, but Naps Arcade is the de facto,

[16:47] the go-to, the greatest place for pinball news, rumors and speculations and I love Jason

[16:53] and I love what he does because he allows us to stay off of Pinside.

[16:58] You can know what's going on in pinball simply by listening to Kinetisys, listening to Kari

[17:03] Hardy and reading Naps Arcade.

[17:05] I'm telling you, he's always spot on and ever since Jason decided to go into more rumors

[17:10] and speculation, this site is 10 times more interesting.

[17:14] Alright, so congratulations Jason, favorite YouTube channel with 48% of the votes.

[17:20] A little shocking here because there's a lot of competition in YouTube.

[17:23] You got Todd Tucky, you got Straight Down the Middle, you got Flippin' Out, you got

[17:27] a lot of content creators on YouTube and with 48%, Mr. Hold No Punches, unless I'm being

[17:34] sponsored by PinStadium.

[17:37] Mr. Kari Hardy.

[17:39] Kari, congratulations, I love your content, I think everybody does and I love the way

[17:44] you look at different cameras and it's just you, it's my favorite part of your show and

[17:50] I'm sure most of us have watched Kari Hardy.

[17:52] I love that he's provocative, I love that he's balanced and I love that he also has

[17:57] a sense of humor.

[17:58] Some of his funniest videos have upset manufacturers to the point where they don't want Kari to

[18:04] go to shows much like Kinecta but he doesn't take the stuff down.

[18:08] He has a sense of humor.

[18:10] I think all of us, if I could give all of us one bit of advice for 2024, it's just

[18:17] pinball everybody, everybody needs to lighten up a little bit.

[18:22] I think we've all been a little bit cranky, the games weren't the best last year, we weren't

[18:28] super excited about the prices, you know we're all like middle aged men just struggling a

[18:33] little bit and we're easily triggered, we all need to lighten up.

[18:37] We got best theme in pinball with 46%, it is no other than pulp freaking fiction.

[18:43] Of course, pulp fiction was going to win best theme.

[18:46] Did you think it was going to be Looney Tunes?

[18:48] Did you think it was going to be like Elton John?

[18:50] I think Elton John got like 1% of the vote or maybe even 0% of the vote and I think the

[18:55] best theme category is really a very interesting category for manufacturers to study because

[19:03] if you're ending up at the bottom of that list, then your marketing department set up

[19:08] your design team to fail.

[19:10] And I mean that, you want to be in the race when it comes to best theme.

[19:15] Best animations and displays, 63% for Foo Fighters.

[19:20] Can we just say for a minute, I think Foo Fighters has the best animations Stern has

[19:24] ever done.

[19:25] The issue I have with Foo Fighters is not that the animations aren't world class because

[19:28] they are.

[19:29] The gameplay is so fast when you're playing Foo Fighters, you don't really get to look

[19:34] up and enjoy everything that's going on on that screen and I think it's perfectly done,

[19:40] it's perfectly balanced and the way they made the Foo Fighters all animate it like an episode

[19:45] of Scooby Doo, it is just genius.

[19:47] You know, imagine that game if it was like concert footage of Foo Fighters, it would

[19:51] be terrible.

[19:52] I mean it, nothing against their on stage personas, their on stage look but it would

[19:56] just have been terrible if this game was just a basic music pin.

[20:01] And you see like when you go down a more unique creative road, how it opens the door for every

[20:06] aspect of your game to be better.

[20:08] The animations are better, the music's better, the call outs are better, everything becomes

[20:12] better when you decide to make a game that's the Foo Fighters trying to protect planet earth

[20:18] and all these different cities in which they're playing their gigs from an alien invasion.

[20:23] I mean that was such a smart move by Stern and Jack Danger.

[20:27] Alright, what else we got next?

[20:29] The best mod in a pinball machine and there's a lot of mods and I'm telling you this, this

[20:34] is why we made this a write in section, people could add their mods but the runaway winner

[20:40] with 28% of votes is Atomic Godzilla.

[20:45] Godzilla mods, this game has been out for two years now, it has some of the coolest mods

[20:51] in all of pinball, I don't think there's any other game in which you can mod it more

[20:56] than Godzilla, it's also funny that when Stern made Godzilla, Godzilla figure did absolutely

[21:02] nothing.

[21:03] This is always so funny to me, it's like Stern always stops putting money in before they should.

[21:08] Like how can you make a Godzilla pinball machine in which Godzilla does nothing, he doesn't

[21:13] breathe fire, he doesn't stomp his feet, he doesn't eat train cars or step on tanks,

[21:18] he does nothing in the game.

[21:20] So this Atomic Godzilla mod is super cool.

[21:23] Alright, best topper in a pinball machine running away with it with 56% is Pulp Fiction,

[21:28] the topper is amazing and it was easily going to win in that category.

[21:32] The best bang for the buck, 33%, Pulp Fiction Pinball.

[21:36] We keep seeing Pulp Fiction and not a single person owns it.

[21:40] The best art package in a pinball machine in 2023.

[21:45] Did you find it funny that the Twippy said to be eligible, you have to ship your game

[21:49] to customers before December 1st.

[21:51] Now I was one of the first people to come out and say that makes no sense because if

[21:55] a game is revealed in December and your voting opens up December 18th, things like the art

[22:01] package and the theme and the topper are not going to change so why not just let people

[22:06] vote on it and I'm glad they changed their mind and included this because the winner,

[22:11] he beat out Zambietti's Foo Fighters, he beat out Zambietti's Venom, the winner for

[22:17] the favorite art package and this guy was on like four games last year with 27% Christopher

[22:23] Franci, Elton John, Platinum Edition, easily the most stunning game of 2023 and the game

[22:31] that nobody's buying.

[22:33] I mean just think about that for a minute.

[22:34] It's one of the most beautiful pinball machines of all time and nobody's buying it.

[22:39] Same thing with Galactic Tank Force, looks stunning, nobody's buying it.

[22:43] Godfather didn't sell very well.

[22:45] Eventually, Mr. Franci is going to get his art package on a game.

[22:49] That's also a hit game and we know it's not going to be the anniversary edition of the

[22:53] Big Lebowski which he shared the artwork for.

[22:56] I'm debating whether or not I should release that.

[22:59] He took it down but I have the images.

[23:01] It's not like Canadian to hold back and be a nice guy.

[23:04] Maybe let's not create any more drama this holiday season.

[23:07] We've all had way too much.

[23:09] So congratulations Mr. Franci.

[23:12] This is the best new pinball content creator with 57%.

[23:16] This man is put in the hard work and Don over at Don's Pinball Podcast.

[23:21] He is the only guy after all these years when Canada's been winning.

[23:26] He's the only guy that came out and followed the same playbook.

[23:30] The same playbook Canada has.

[23:32] You do like two to three shows a week and they're like 20 minutes long.

[23:36] That's what Don does.

[23:37] Go on Facebook Live.

[23:39] That's what Don does.

[23:41] Let people into your home.

[23:42] That's what Don does.

[23:44] Wear fake Versace sunglasses.

[23:46] Well, Canada's got the real ones but everything I've done, Don has followed it and guess what

[23:51] people?

[23:52] I'm not mad about that.

[23:53] It works.

[23:54] It's smart and he's enjoying himself and that's the way you should do it.

[23:58] And it's exciting to see Don with 57%.

[24:01] The only thing that makes me sad is Don will not win a Twippy now because when the Twippies

[24:05] first reintroduced the media categories, they started with best new content creator

[24:11] and then they adjusted it and now it's like every single content creator competing with

[24:15] themselves and then they removed the previous winners.

[24:18] So it's like Don's now going up against the pinball show, against Naps Arcade.

[24:23] They threw into one blender and it doesn't make any sense.

[24:26] So Don, I think you should have been up on stage.

[24:29] I think you should have been at Texas and I'm sad that you're not going to get that

[24:32] moment.

[24:33] Best toys and mechs in a game.

[24:35] I will say this.

[24:36] When I looked at 2023's games, none of the toys and mechs were that impressive.

[24:40] This was not a year in which you looked down at games and said, wow, how did they engineer

[24:46] that?

[24:47] Wow, look at the multiple layers of engineering going in there.

[24:51] Look at what the ball does when you shoot that.

[24:53] Did you see the ball disappear?

[24:55] Did you see the ball fly across the game?

[24:56] Did you see the ball like get grabbed by a magnet and do this?

[25:00] There was not much mechanical.

[25:02] Wow.

[25:03] And winning in this category is no other than a game that probably had one of the most

[25:08] simple mechs, but actually one of the most wow mechs in pinball, proving that sometimes

[25:14] simplicity can create magic.

[25:16] And that is with 34%, Foo Fighters Pinball wins best mechs in a game and that Dead Save

[25:23] post is absolutely amazing.

[25:26] And I think that's the one that people love the most.

[25:28] The alien is really cool as well, but again, nothing in it that's nearly the level of the

[25:33] kinds of stuff we've seen in games like Godzilla and Jurassic Park and so on and so on.

[25:39] All right, so what else we got?

[25:40] We got a few more favorite pinball podcast.

[25:44] Who's the favorite pinball podcaster out there without Canada in the mix?

[25:48] Now this one makes total sense.

[25:50] All the years I've been doing this, whenever you want to make something and you want to

[25:54] become better at what you do, it is important that you have competition.

[25:58] Imagine if there's no competition in the world of manufacturing pinball machines.

[26:02] There's only one company.

[26:04] Remember when there was just stern pinball?

[26:06] They were not going to get better.

[26:08] They were not going to innovate.

[26:09] Jersey Jack is the reason why Stern finally put LCD screens into its games.

[26:15] So some competition is good.

[26:17] And I understand that competition does get nasty at times.

[26:21] And when you've got a lot of like alpha male personalities making content, it's really

[26:26] hard for everybody to get along.

[26:28] So when I saw these results, I absolutely agreed with them and 26%.

[26:34] Your favorite pinball podcaster is the Pinball Show with Zach and Dennis Creasel.

[26:39] And again, they put in the work.

[26:41] They do the work.

[26:43] They've got the audience.

[26:44] We know the numbers are there.

[26:45] The only thing I could ask of Zach and Dennis, we know you guys get good numbers.

[26:50] We know you say the numbers don't lie.

[26:53] All we ask is just share the numbers.

[26:56] You've got them.

[26:57] Of course, you've got more listeners than Canada behind a paywall.

[27:01] So congratulations.

[27:02] You've always finished right at the top of pinball podcasting.

[27:06] And I can say this, they've made me make my show better.

[27:08] And I bet they would say I have done nothing to make their show better.

[27:11] But anyway, everybody, it's good to see the pinball show recognized by the people.

[27:16] And that's what matters.

[27:17] All right, best game design with 56% Jack Danger, Foo Fighters.

[27:23] His first game.

[27:24] He comes out of the gate and he makes a game that everybody loves to shoot.

[27:28] I would even argue that I sometimes enjoy shooting Foo Fighters more than Godzilla.

[27:33] Godzilla is a lot more difficult.

[27:35] Foo Fighters is fast.

[27:37] It's fun.

[27:38] There's unique shots.

[27:39] And there's just something about flipping that game that is a lot of fun.

[27:43] And if this is Jack's first entry into pinball design, well, it's kind of like his second.

[27:47] He was doing a lot with the homebrew space.

[27:50] This is his first production game.

[27:51] And it is phenomenal.

[27:53] I know who amongst you is not really excited to see what Jack does next.

[27:57] Is it going to be Pokemon?

[27:58] Hey, man, what's it going to be?

[27:59] I don't know, but whatever it is, I can tell you I'm excited because it's not just Jack

[28:05] designing these games.

[28:06] He's got the best team behind him over at Stern.

[28:10] I think sometimes we forget this.

[28:12] It's not like Keith Elwin's going to refuse to look over what Jack is thinking about.

[28:16] It's not like John Borg's not going to walk in and lend some ideas or George Gomez.

[28:21] And you've got this much talent under a roof.

[28:24] Everybody at Stern Pinball's products are going to benefit.

[28:27] And I don't feel that way.

[28:28] When I look at other companies, I mean, think about it, if you're Ryan McQuade and you're

[28:33] designing a game at American Pinball, who's walking over to your game to give you some

[28:37] pointers?

[28:38] Who?

[28:39] Steve Bowden?

[28:40] David Fix?

[28:41] You know, Dennis Nordman's not even over there.

[28:43] Like who's actually helping them out?

[28:45] You know, and I think what's exciting about Steve Ritchie being over at Jersey Jack, at

[28:49] least he's going to help those other designers think about layout a little bit.

[28:53] I mean, I hope so.

[28:54] All right.

[28:55] What else we got?

[28:56] Jack Danger, you know, best designer.

[28:58] And look, it would be criminal if you win best game design and don't win best game of

[29:04] the year.

[29:05] It's like when someone wins like best director at the Academy Awards and then they don't

[29:09] win best movie.

[29:10] It doesn't make any sense.

[29:11] How can you be the best designer or director if the thing you direct it or designed is

[29:16] not the best in itself?

[29:18] And so the game of the year with 48% of the votes is no other than Foo Fighters, ladies

[29:24] and gentlemen, not a surprise, not a mystery.

[29:27] And when this game came out, it just felt like it beat Godfather, it beat Tank Force,

[29:33] it beat everything else.

[29:34] The only thing that was going to potentially beat this game, the only thing that could

[29:39] have beat this game for game of the year was Keith Elwin.

[29:42] There was no way it was going to be Venom.

[29:44] Venom landed with a thud.

[29:45] Venom was dead on arrival.

[29:47] Elton John's been dead on arrival.

[29:49] Galactic Tank Force was dead on arrival.

[29:51] Godfather's sales are plummeting.

[29:53] There's not a lot of hype around that game.

[29:55] There was just nothing else.

[29:57] Nothing else came out.

[29:59] The two most celebrated games of the year, Foo Fighters and a game that no one can even

[30:04] play Pulp Fiction.

[30:06] That's really what's defined 2023.

[30:09] When you zoom out a little bit, I know we got the two new spooky games and that's exciting.

[30:14] He's now got four games on the line at Spooky Pinball.

[30:18] Can you think about how amazing that is?

[30:20] They're making four separate games right now.

[30:23] Looney Tunes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TNA and also Scooby-Doo's.

[30:28] Four games.

[30:29] Jersey Jack Pinball.

[30:31] You have like 10,000 times the resources as Spooky Pinball and you can't make more than

[30:37] one theme at a time.

[30:39] Everybody, come on.

[30:40] Happy holidays.

[30:42] Welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[30:44] Thank you for the support and we're going to have so many great shows coming up.

[30:48] So much is about to happen.

[30:49] Everybody have a great Christmas on Monday.

[30:52] Obviously, I'm not going to do a show on Christmas Day, but we will get some more podcasts out

[30:57] next week.

[30:58] I've got nothing but time.

[30:59] There's something dangerous, right?

[31:01] When Canada's got nothing but time, he's got a whole week off surrounded by espresso martinis.

[31:06] I think everyone's just hoping I don't drink too much and do something stupid.

[31:11] So once again, invite the haters to say what a miserable person I am.

[31:15] I don't know.

[31:16] None of us are that bad.

[31:17] Everybody lighten up and I hope you get everything you wanted for Christmas and at these prices,

[31:21] there probably will not be a pinball machine under the tree for any of us later.
