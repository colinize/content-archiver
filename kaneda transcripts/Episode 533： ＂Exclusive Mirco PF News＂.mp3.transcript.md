[00:00] No more to flee, keep on me, my baby, my baby, my baby

[00:06] No more to go, save me, my darling, my baby, my baby, now

[00:18] Ah, there's all these babies in the Pimball Podcasting world

[00:22] and there's about to be the most important baby in all of Pimball Podcasting

[00:27] exposed to the world and that is no other than Canada and Brenda, yours truly

[00:33] we are expecting our first child. Now I put up a post on Facebook about it this weekend

[00:38] and I'm just here to tell you right now I am so excited to be a father

[00:42] and to usher in a new era of Pimball Podcasting as I pass the torch to my baby boy

[00:49] who is expected knock on wood sometime, sometime in February so

[00:54] I just want to say this through this entire process of watching how a woman's body transforms into a vessel for a human life

[01:03] I have nothing but a newfound love and respect for Brenda and it's amazing to me

[01:09] it really is amazing and we are super excited and I just wanted all of you out there to know this

[01:14] because for so many of you out there I know that we have a relationship, we have a bond, you tune in on a weekly basis

[01:20] and you want to know what's going on in Canada's world, well this is really the big news that's been going on in my world

[01:26] and now you'll know why that I might not be putting a new Pimball machine in this bedroom

[01:31] because there might be a crib there instead of a Guns and Roses collector's edition

[01:37] but I am super excited that this child will be born into a world in which there will be a Guns and Roses Pimball machine

[01:45] like no other, okay so everyone I want to say thank you to everyone you said congratulations

[01:50] I take any and all of your parenting tips that you can give me as we head towards this monumental moment in our lives

[01:57] and I just don't know how I'm going to continue to do the show if there's a crying baby in the background

[02:02] but we'll figure it out, we'll figure it out, the show's not going away

[02:05] alright so I have a really big exclusive news item that I want to break on this show

[02:10] and I've been here and other shows been like you know he steals his news from us

[02:13] I don't steal news from anybody right I don't need to interview people

[02:16] everyone else can go do their thing but what I've always been about is giving you the most important information you need

[02:23] as a Pimball customer and this means more than just talking to people about their key messages

[02:28] alright so here is a Canadian Pimball exclusive if you want to push Canadian into a corner

[02:34] he's going to come out fighting with exclusives so this will be the first time anyone hears about this

[02:39] and this has to do with Miracle Playfields and Guns & Roses Collector's editions

[02:45] and also Miracle Playfields moving forward

[02:48] now we all know the story Miracle Playfield has been under pressure to figure out why these playfields have been pooling

[02:54] and chipping on Guns & Roses at least and this has been happening for many many years now with Miracle

[03:01] we've seen it on pirates, we've seen it on Wanka and now we've seen it on Guns & Roses

[03:06] now here is what is happening at Miracle Playfields

[03:09] so I'm hearing two things have happened first and foremost

[03:12] they have looked at the formula for how they're doing these clear codes and they've made changes to ensure that this does not happen again

[03:19] now I know a lot of you out there are like we've heard this before but here is the other big news that you're hearing first on Canadian Pimball podcast

[03:27] they are putting on to every playfield moving forward

[03:30] an indicator by which they can test the strength of the clear code before any of those games are put in a box and ship to Jersey Jack Pimball or other manufacturers

[03:41] and here is what the indicator is underneath the apron on all Miracle Playfields moving forward

[03:48] there will be an indicator by which they can test the strength of the clear and what I mean by that is this

[03:54] is going to be a place for them to screw in a screw into the clear code and they can screw in a screw or a post

[04:01] where they can test to see if that clear code is pooling, if it's sinking in, if it's chipping

[04:07] they can test the strength of that clear code so they are going to test every single playfield by screwing stuff into it

[04:14] underneath the apron before that gets approved and sent to the manufacturer

[04:19] so what do you think about that exclusive news? I think one word comes to mind when I think about this move finally

[04:26] finally they are doing something that has some quality control over there before these things are going to the manufacturer

[04:33] because it's too late right? It's too late to test the quality of these playfields by the time they go into a box

[04:39] you have to do the quality control test over at Miracle and so this is going to happen on every single guns and roses playfield moving forward

[04:47] you're going to see the build date on the right side of the playfield but underneath the apron will be the new Miracle indicator

[04:54] to make sure your playfield has been tested before it's been sent to Jersey Jack Pimball for assembly

[05:00] so this is really big news and I think for those of you out there who are in on a collector's edition

[05:05] I think this is music to your ears because this is all we want we don't want to have to unbox a game and swap out the playfield ever

[05:14] so really really good news for all of us moving forward but here's the thing we are going to hold this company to this new accountability

[05:22] if these games pool after this then all bets are off I think people are I've had enough I think people will be done with Miracle forever

[05:29] this is their last chance to instill in all of us confidence that they know what they're doing so let's see how these games roll out

[05:37] now speaking of collector's editions another exclusive that I'm going to give you right now on Canadian's Pimball podcast

[05:43] the world's favorite Pimball podcast because we're all so negative here right this shows so negative what he's just in this hobby to tear it down

[05:51] no come on there's a reason why we're number one because we are the biggest fans of Pimball and we are the biggest advocates for consumers getting what they pay for

[06:00] okay so here is something really awesome that I just saw so I got to see pictures of what the collector's edition final playfield will look like from Jersey Jack Pimball

[06:11] and let me tell you something the way they're implementing the sparkle onto this playfield is absolutely incredible

[06:18] it's so awesome and let me explain what I mean by that I'm looking at a picture right now that's the Axel Rose image in between the flippers of the game

[06:26] you know Axel with the skeleton he's got his hand on the mic he's got his cross on so here is how awesome this sparkle is

[06:33] you see where it says shoot again the guns and roses logo all of that yellow is sparkly like a sparkle yellow

[06:39] but here's where it gets totally awesome Axel Rose is diamond ring you know he's got that black stone in the middle and then there's diamonds around it

[06:47] it's a Jake of the jeweler ring that he always wears that ring has the sparkle right where the diamonds would be on the ring

[06:54] how incredible is that and then this is even cooler his diamond cross that Axel wears the diamonds on the cross itself are all sparkles as if they were diamonds

[07:06] this is super super awesome the fact that they can get the sparkle to hit exactly where you would want the sparkle to be is so cool

[07:15] and it works perfectly with this kind of theme and then I'm looking at a picture of the map so the entire map where it's got the purple sort of globe

[07:23] all that is sparkly the gold is sparkly there and then this is super cool you know the Gibson guitar so the Gibson that's written in gold that is sparkle and here's the awesome part

[07:34] the less Paul signature is sparkle but that this is my favorite part the strings the actual strings that are on the neck of the guitar all those are sparkly silver

[07:44] you're going to get a combination of gold sparkle and silver sparkle on this game and I think when you see this game all lit up with all of this sparkle happening

[07:54] this game is going to pop like no other game in the history of pinball it's already got the best light show ever so combine that light show with this sparkling artwork

[08:03] and this is why people want the playfields not to pull and not to crack because we just want this game to maintain its pristine beauty for as long as we own it

[08:13] so fingers crossed this new clear coat indicator test works because when you guys see this game with all of its glory sparkling and lit up

[08:23] there is a reason why I continue to say that guns and roses collectors additions are going to be the most sought after game for a very long time

[08:31] and I was hearing from a distributor overseas that people are offering $25,000 for a spot at getting a CE and nobody is selling it so I mean if you have one you better pat yourself on the back for being lucky enough to grab one because these games are going to be worth a fortune

[08:49] now that being said like thinking about a pinball machine being worth $25,000 is just ludicrous and I will say this I'm going to be completely honest with all of you right now

[08:58] I just got the new Xbox Series X I think it was a little over 500 bucks I just got a new LG OLED TV 4K 120 refresh rate I think I paid around 1500 bucks

[09:10] so for $2,000 you can get the greatest gaming system with the best TVs on the market what are we doing spending $6,000, $13,000 on a single pinball machine

[09:24] I really do think that a lot of us are living in this pinball vacuum and the prices have just gone so through the roof that we need to step out of it and realize what other things in the entertainment space are costing

[09:38] and then you look at pinball and you realize that this is the most insane hobby I think there is because again it's an entertainment device it's a game and the fact that we're spending so much money

[09:50] the fact that a stern topper costs as much as a 4K TV that is incredible or twice the price of an Xbox or PS5 a stern topper that is made for probably $50

[10:01] when are we gonna all hit pause on these prices and I will say like I'm probably at the center of the problem saying that they can keep charging more because people will spend the money

[10:11] and there's more than enough multi-millionaires and billionaires in the pinball hobby that you know they can support these prices

[10:18] but when you look at the reality of what's happening in this hobby and where the prices are going it is insane it is ludicrous

[10:27] and there will be an economic reset that happens one day in which people will look over at all these non-essential pinball machines and realize that their values are gonna continue to go south

[10:39] and look I get it if you buy a TV it's not gonna hold it to value but still a TV is only like a grand so what you lose a few hundred bucks

[10:46] but nobody really buys to use TVs anymore because of how cheap TVs are to begin with but these pinball machines I swear like I look at my checking account

[10:54] let's just say to get two of the hottest new pinball machines on the market you get a Guns and Roses CE and an Avengers LE and you're looking at your bank statement

[11:04] and you just spent 21 or 22 thousand dollars on two games I mean think about that 22 thousand dollars to have two pinball games in your home

[11:16] and then you look at how much is it cost for you to have two incredible games on Xbox and you're looking at 120 bucks, 150 bucks for the two games plus the system like 600 bucks at most

[11:28] I mean it's absolutely bonkers that we are spending these prices and they're only going up I mean literally they sold out of a 12-5 game in one hour

[11:38] so I'm not here to tell you that the prices are gonna go down I'm just here to tell you that all of us are part of this insanity and it's crazy

[11:45] it is crazy when you start to look at what you can get for the money now speaking of crazy let's talk about deep route because since my last show

[11:53] someone hacked into the deep route website and uncovered all of this information about their plans to roll out downloadable content

[12:01] their plans to charge around five thousand dollars for the base level machine but then they want to charge people 50 dollars a month with a one year minimum subscription to actually get more content into the game

[12:15] now I want to remind everybody that deep route has not officially put any of this out there this is all somebody hacking their website

[12:22] so none of this is official none of this is actually happening but that doesn't really matter right because that is what their plan is like they wouldn't have made this website with all of this information if they were not planning to turn it on

[12:35] so I think I speak for the entire community when I say that DLC content right downloadable content will not work in Pimball you are not going to spend these kinds of prices for an unfinished product

[12:46] and I don't care if it's five thousand I don't care if it's four thousand or nine thousand you buy a Pimball machine and you want it to be complete and the thing you'll you'll wait for is new code updates but you shouldn't have to pay for it because ultimately what is the point of buying an incomplete Pimball machine if all of what the designer and the coder want in that game has been purposely removed from the launch of the title right so you're going to send me a raza in which you've actually held back the game itself

[13:14] but you've held back modes and storylines and all these different things from the game itself and I have to pay extra now to get what you feel is the final version of the game no I'm not going to do that like this this is not going to work people the only company out there that will I think be able to turn on a monthly subscription is stern because they have so many games out there their spike system is set up for network play it is and they're just waiting and if that's the case I don't mind spending more money for net play

[13:43] like an Xbox live subscription I don't mind doing that but you are not going to get people to spend money to get the new raza storyline and they're definitely not going to pay 50 bucks out of the gate for a company that has improved and they can do any of this this is the part about deep root Pimball that I think everyone is forgetting right the main thing about deep root Pimball the only thing that you need to know about deep root Pimball is they have not proven they can make one single game

[14:12] I want to see the production line over at deep root Pimball now this is the part that the deep six right those VIPs that went over to deep root Pimball this is the part that none of them will tell you anything about this is the part that they are remaining quiet on you wonder why they signed an NDA this is why they signed an NDA because I heard from some of those deep six who went over to deep root when they open the door that was the production room they did not see any production going on

[14:41] there was nobody in the room there weren't boxes of parts ordered there wasn't an assembly line already to go with all the different stations on on on how to build raza there wasn't anything that even resemble a Pimball manufacturing line

[14:56] so why is it that two months later when they finally wheel out a game that just functions everyone is is thinking that this thing is close that we're about to get this game in three months I mean do you really understand that if you don't have manufacturing in place all of this all this is pointless and so as I see people debating DLC and debating raza gameplay and the gameplay physics and the mix in the game and all this stuff light up cabinet artwork none of it matters if they can't make the game

[15:25] and so why isn't deep root studios or deep root pinball why aren't they showing us the assembly line by which they're going to make the game and then the most troubling thing within all of their hacked information the most troubling thing is they want to have a 20% non refundable deposit non refundable a company that has never proven they can make a game a non refundable deposit which means that's a pre order people it means if you give your money to the company

[15:55] your money is locked in and you can't get it back your deposit is theirs and you can't get it back ever it's non refundable the other part that's really frustrating to me about all of this is people are looking at this with rose colored glasses and they're not looking at the history of this company and the history of people involved with this game and I don't think you can do that like this is why I get annoyed when people are like

[16:19] canada you're so negative and the streaming of the game and this one that like are did all of you forget do all of you have revisionist history this isn't just like a new company that's been humble that you just can wheel a game out and then we're all supposed to just like enjoy the gameplay people you need to ask the tough questions you need to remember what this company said to us all these years they were going to ship more games than anyone ever but here's the big thing Robert has said this on my show when people order the game he promised people they were

[16:49] would have their game within two weeks do I need to go back on you tubing and grab that sound clip in which he said that do I need to go back on my show and and pull the clip in which he said if you order a deep

[16:59] route machine you're going to have it in two weeks so here we are here we are right on the eve of this game coming out we haven't seen any production nothing that we've seen leads us to believe they're ready to ship these games in three months

[17:11] and everyone just wants to like forget about all that stuff so I'm here to tell you right now look if you pre order this game and something goes wrong and you lose your money or you don't get your game in two weeks and you have to wait forever to get it you have nobody to blame but yourself right now as customers in the pinball hobby there is only one company that consistently gets people their games on a timely schedule and that is stern and everyone else everyone else just fumbles getting people

[17:41] their products in any timely manner right and so for Robert to say everyone who orders is going to get it within two weeks you have to understand the ludicrousness of that statement what if he gets a thousand orders so then everyone's not getting their pin in two weeks but this is the stuff that's been said I didn't say this stuff I'm not making this stuff up I'm not trying to be dramatic I am simply reporting on what these people said is possible by their company and that's my point is that manufacturing is so hard

[18:11] manufacturing is so difficult and I think some of these companies act cavalier about it and they make these bold statements and then we're just supposed to forget they said that and you can't you can't forget it and I implore all of you you have to hold these companies accountable for what they say they're going to do when it comes to manufacturing okay now speaking of that let's change gears to Jersey Jack pinball because this is the other big news story to me happening in pinball we don't need more high res images of the game

[18:41] G and R like every day we get it you can take a million different angled shots and HD photography of this game and it is a beautiful sexy game but you don't have to sell us on it we've already bought into this game what people now want to know is when they're going to get their game because you haven't told these customers anything like they are in the dark everyone you spend 12 5 on a game is in the dark people who ordered their at least with non-refundable deposits from you they're also in the dark about when they're going to get their games and and

[19:11] so you can't do it like this you can't and I just think that Jersey Jack pinball right now is is learning a hard lesson and the lesson is this they know that they can't make games nearly at the level of

[19:23] Stern pinball Stern pinball just cranked out 400 and eight games in one week one week for hundred and eight now I don't know Jersey Jack's numbers right now but I bet they are only

[19:36] running at 10% of that maybe a little bit more maybe 50 games a week right so think about that for a minute at the pace Jersey Jack is going they will need all of next year like all of 2021 to fulfill all of the

[19:50] early orders of G and R and then you throw in 500 CE's and then it becomes clear maybe they should stop trying to sell more games with non-refundable deposits and just start

[20:02] communicating with the buyer base they have now because they either need to crank up production they need to hire more people they need to fill that larger space with more

[20:12] workers and lines and get more games going because they can't do it like this you can't get two to three thousand orders and then take forever to have them made

[20:22] because Stern pinball can make two thousand games in just a couple months you know because if you order a guns and roses early today you have no idea when you're

[20:32] getting a game and the truth is you're probably not getting your game until summer of 2021 if not later but you've got to let people know

[20:40] that am I the only one who finds this to be problematic the whole like I'll take your money and then I won't tell you anything else I won't inform you on when you can

[20:49] expect to have your game the other part that I think is also annoying about this whole thing is people don't know when they're going to need the

[20:55] money they don't know when they're going to need that extra 8500 or the extra 11 5 when are people going to have to actually go into their checking

[21:04] accounts and pay for this product because the rest of us in the real world we like to plan around when payments are going to hit us I just

[21:14] think it's a mistake that Jersey Jack pinball is not giving people an indicator a time frame by which you might have to pay for your game you

[21:21] basically are in the dark on all of this and I think they need to huddle together this week and next week and I think they need to

[21:28] figure out a new communication strategy because this is not how you do it I think the hard part for them is this they know how many

[21:35] games a week they can make they know that it's not that many they know the demand for this game is through the roof so they

[21:42] really there's nothing they can do I think the reason we're not hearing from them is they know that what they can tell us isn't what we want to

[21:51] hear because imagine if they said hey we're making 50 games a week that's our capacity they know that if they say that that is going to cause

[22:01] people to not order it's going to cause people to ask for their money back because they don't want to wait that long and it's going to do

[22:07] nothing but hurt their chances of locking in those deposits so I think they are purposely saying nothing because they just know the volume isn't that great

[22:17] and it's a strategy you can play I do think it's playing with fire a little bit but you know ultimately this game is a masterpiece and I wish they would just say it like this

[22:25] game is going to be worth waiting for you need to have a little patience but they do need to be more transparent it's too small of a hobby to

[22:33] continue to ask your consumers to be in the dark like this all right what else is going on in pinball so we're almost at December and we still don't have

[22:41] cactus Canyon remake so we look forward to hearing if that information is correct we heard from from Christopher

[22:45] Franci that this is going to happen by the end of the year so we'll see what happens I mean they've got four weeks to go

[22:50] on the title is it a good time to come out with a new pinball title I don't know man I think people's money spent I

[22:56] actually think people are just at a room at this point but we'll see what happens so I don't think we're going to get

[23:00] Led Zeppelin by the end of the year but you know what it's turned to got so many machines to make I think we'll get Zeppelin in

[23:06] January February but they've got no rush to get this game out they've already got thousands of games that they need to

[23:12] make so why throw another one into the mix right now so we'll see what happens in January February Led Zeppelin is the next

[23:19] title if it were something else I would be shocked maybe it's queen I don't know but I think it's going to be Led Zeppelin

[23:26] anything else going on I think American pinball probably is like we need to get another title out hot wheels is not selling

[23:33] that well you don't see the unboxings of the machine and so at what point does American pinball look at

[23:39] you know what's in development and say hey when's the next game when are we gonna turn the next game on

[23:44] when are we gonna start to get an excitement going back at American pinball so I think that is something

[23:49] they're probably thinking about as they go into the end of the year

[23:52] Dutch pinball continues to slowly make their big Lebowski's they are increasing their factory they

[23:58] are slowly getting the EA's their games I am surprised they are figuring it out it is taking a very

[24:04] long time but I am glad to see them doing the right thing and I hope all of the EA's get made

[24:10] whole because I do want to see Dutch pinball move on to another game but there's still a long

[24:15] ways to go and for them it's fortunate that the economy has stayed strong because I think if the

[24:21] economy dipped people running to buy 12 5 games from them right now would not be the first thing people

[24:27] would spend their money on but it is good news that the coder is coming back I still think the big

[24:32] Lebowski is one of the coolest pins I've seen so we'll see what happens there but that is a slow

[24:37] sort of convalescence they're going through but we're happy to see that working out for people

[24:43] and lastly like we're the twippies like you know Jeff's got to be working on something but it's

[24:49] almost December we're at the end of the year and now the attention gets into the award season of

[24:54] the pinball industry and it's going to be really fun to see Avengers versus Guns and Roses there's

[24:59] a lot more in the mix this year than there normally is like Rick and Morty I think there's you know

[25:04] the three juggernaut titles are going to be Rick and Morty Avengers and Guns and Roses it's going

[25:08] to be fun watching those three battle it out for some of these categories of theme integration

[25:13] and light show and whatnot because you know like Avengers is out there like everyone who bought one

[25:18] has one so once again I think what's gonna hurt Jersey Jack is like nobody has their guns and

[25:22] roses yet so like just from a pure ownership standpoint there's a lot more people who have been

[25:28] playing Avengers than GNR so while we might think GNR is going to sweep a lot of these categories

[25:33] their inability to get people to game might lean in Avengers is favor because they have such a

[25:39] larger user base right now I mean you've got the pros the LEDs and the premiums flying out the

[25:44] door at Stern and GNR like we're only sending 50 out and they're going to Europe so it's I

[25:50] I think it's going to be a lot closer than people think on some of these categories just because

[25:55] of the ownership base that's going to be who votes for these games like it's hard to vote for

[26:00] GNR if you haven't played it right it's weird to vote for something you've never played so we'll

[26:04] see what happens I just want to end this show it was Thanksgiving week you know since it was thanks

[26:09] giving I just want to say that I'm extremely thankful for everybody out there who enjoys

[26:13] Canada's pinball podcast I hope you and your families all had a happy and a healthy Thanksgiving

[26:19] it was a difficult one for so many of us we didn't get to connect with our families the way we usually

[26:24] and we didn't get to see our friends the way we usually get to right that Wednesday before Thanksgiving

[26:28] when you're in your hometown and everyone's at the bar none of that happened so I'm extremely

[26:32] thankful for each and every one of you I'm so happy to have you as a listener to this show whether

[26:37] you like me or not whether you think I just exist to create drama or not I really am thankful for

[26:43] everyone who listens to this show all the feedback I get I'm Brenda and Bubba we are very thankful all

[26:48] of us together that you guys enjoy this show and so I also want to thank all the manufacturers out

[26:54] there I mean like I'm not going to get sappy on you guys right now but I am thankful that we have

[26:58] so many pinball options in 2020 it still is incredible to me that this hobby even exists in the new

[27:04] inbox form right that you can buy brand new pinball machines at these prices in 2020 especially with

[27:10] the how how expensive they are but it's alive and well and it's thriving like when I talk to

[27:15] distributors sales are through the roof like people are hunkering down and buying things for their

[27:20] homes more than ever and the industry is doing better this year than it did last year like during a

[27:26] global pandemic so I am thankful for all the companies out there who are making stuff I'm thankful for

[27:32] all the pinball content creators that are out there in the world I am there's a lot of you out there

[27:37] who put on a microphone and do a show looking everybody does their show the way they want to do their

[27:42] show and I want to again implore people to just leave the drama out the door all right everyone is

[27:48] listening to my show since I've been back I'm not personally attacking anyone I'm not saying bad

[27:52] stuff about anybody you know and I do hear people continue to say bad things about me and negative

[27:58] things about me and I really don't get it I really don't get it I'm happy to go on anyone's show

[28:03] and defend myself but let's all be thankful that we live in a country where there's free speech and

[28:08] we can just put up our feelings about pinball and no one's gonna knock on our door and shut us down no

[28:13] one's gonna delete our Facebook comments okay so I am thankful for all the other personalities out

[28:19] in the pinball world some of you might love me some of you might hate me but I got nothing but

[28:23] love for all you guys and you know that and you know that and we're all in this together we are

[28:27] all part of a tiny little group of content creators and we should stick together instead of trying

[28:33] to tear each other down all right and that being said that being said though you know you know

[28:37] canada wants to win the twippy you know we do this to make the best pinball podcasts in the world

[28:41] and I think you agree that this show is just unique and no one does it like this no one can go solo

[28:47] and talk about pinball three times a week and get the audience we do we must be doing something

[28:52] right and it's not because we're negative it's not because we're tearing down the industry it's

[28:56] because we're capturing what is going on in the industry in real time giving you great exclusives

[29:02] about like Miracle Playfields new way to test their clear code and that's why you tune in on a

[29:07] weekly basis and I am super thankful you do everybody have a great weekend I did this show before

[29:17] love to have another canada's pinball podcast so mark Nellis this is for you Mark because you are

[29:23] on a long drive right now and now you get to listen to my annoying voice on that trip I couldn't
