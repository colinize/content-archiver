[00:00] Oh, Kaneda is back the only pinball podcaster with a Gucci Xbox right here.

[00:27] I'm getting offers for $20,000 for a Gucci Xbox.

[00:31] The world is crazy.

[00:33] Ghostbusters, Ellie's are selling for $22,000.

[00:38] What we're going to do on this episode 629 of Kaneda's pinball podcast because it's been

[00:42] a couple weeks for you cheap bastards that didn't give anything to the Canadian club.

[00:46] We're going to go down a list of everything happening in the pinball world.

[00:50] I think I can do it in like 30 minutes or less.

[00:53] Did you miss me?

[00:54] Someone just called me boring.

[00:57] He got banned.

[00:58] He got the ban hammer.

[00:59] You're going to call Kaneda boring because I'm not giving you free episodes.

[01:04] Pick up a mic and do your own pinball podcast Charlie and see what happens.

[01:08] No, he wasn't Charlie.

[01:09] He was Brian Albert.

[01:10] You're gone bro.

[01:11] You're gone.

[01:12] You're going to have to really apologize if you want back onto the Kaneda page because

[01:15] if there's one thing I know this show is not, it's boring.

[01:18] Okay, so let's talk about what is going on in pinball.

[01:21] Now as you all know, there's not a lot of games shipping.

[01:25] All right, let's go down the list of manufacturers and just talk about what's happening before

[01:28] we get to the end of the year.

[01:30] So first and foremost, stern pinball.

[01:32] We thought that we might see Rush pinball sometime in December.

[01:36] They still might reveal it.

[01:38] The game might not be on the line until January, but they might give us a little holiday

[01:44] rush surprise.

[01:45] Now, I'm still hearing that it's going to be January.

[01:49] To expect Rush pinball in January 1000 LEs of this game, how will Rush do is the big

[01:58] question.

[01:59] You've got the Rush fanboys who say this game is going to do great.

[02:03] You got everyone else and everyone in Australia who could care less about Rush.

[02:08] My personal opinion is this.

[02:11] While I don't love Rush music, I also don't hate it.

[02:14] I'm just apathetic about it.

[02:16] I think Rush has sold millions of albums and I think there are more than a thousand Canadians

[02:24] who will want a Rush LEs.

[02:26] So look out for Rush pinball from stern and John Borg.

[02:30] Who is on the code?

[02:31] We don't know yet.

[02:32] We will see what this game looks like.

[02:34] Okay.

[02:35] Now, after Rush pinball is a new game from stern, is it going to be a re-skin?

[02:41] Is it going to be a brand new game?

[02:43] It is a Marvel themed game.

[02:45] I'm getting nervous.

[02:46] Canadian is getting nervous because I told everybody if I got the 300 club members, I would

[02:51] reveal the new game after Rush and I told my source I wouldn't do it until January

[02:59] 1st.

[03:00] But I'm getting nervous because we are at 288 club members, which means 12 people can

[03:06] tip the scale.

[03:08] And I'm going to keep my word to the fans and give you guys the next title after Rush

[03:13] if we get 12 more.

[03:14] Oh my god, Canadian is begging for club members.

[03:16] That bastard.

[03:17] Okay.

[03:18] So stern pinball.

[03:19] And then next year, we are definitely going to see James Bond.

[03:23] We might even see a game that I'm hearing bubble up again, which is jaws.

[03:29] And now I talk to Craig Bobby over at the pinball show at the pinball network because he said

[03:34] that his sources are saying back to the future, Keith L. Win, back to the future, Joe

[03:39] Kamikaw title.

[03:40] It's a Keith L. Win dream theme.

[03:42] And we had a great conversation last night.

[03:43] Craig Bobby is a great guy.

[03:45] And the truth is this, nobody really knows.

[03:47] Nobody knows.

[03:48] Nobody is passing around images of back to the future.

[03:52] Nobody knows for sure what is going on.

[03:54] And there are so many people when you're doing a show like this and Craig gets us all

[03:58] the time.

[03:59] People come up to you and they confirm for you stuff that never happens.

[04:04] It's even like when I confirm that Halloween was going to be the next title from spooky,

[04:08] Joe Abati, my good friend.

[04:10] He's like, I can guarantee you it's not going to be Halloween.

[04:13] It's going to be like Freddy Krueger.

[04:14] And it's like, see, it's really hard.

[04:17] It's really hard because we all have a lot of friends that we trust in this hobby and

[04:20] so many of them, so many of them will come to us with what they believe is confirmation

[04:26] of what's down the line.

[04:28] And truthfully, unless you see something like I remember seeing the Ghostbusters translate,

[04:33] I remember seeing the Deadpool whitewood.

[04:36] I had the Guns and Roses whitewood.

[04:38] Nobody knows for sure.

[04:40] Nobody knows for sure what's next.

[04:42] But if back to the future comes out from Stern Pimball, you best believe it will be their

[04:47] biggest title ever.

[04:49] Keith Alwyn back to the future would be the biggest title ever.

[04:53] Do I think it's coming out?

[04:55] I still think there's a 50-50 chance on this.

[04:57] I don't think it's 100% but I hope it comes out but I'm not waiting for it.

[05:02] I'll just put that out.

[05:03] I'm not waiting for this game.

[05:06] Also over at Stern Pimball, Godzilla, Ellie's and premiums are going out the door.

[05:11] How is Godzilla being received by the community?

[05:14] Well, the game is ranked number one of all time.

[05:16] We all know it's way too early to say that Godzilla is the greatest game of all time.

[05:21] I keep seeing people debate whether or not Jurassic Park is better than Godzilla.

[05:25] Real coin toss there.

[05:26] A lot of people swear by Jurassic Park over Godzilla.

[05:30] My one question on Godzilla is not whether or not the game is great.

[05:34] I'm just looking at the threads in terms of long-term reliability because I'm starting to

[05:40] see some mechanical issues with the game and with so many games going out the door so quickly,

[05:46] I hope these games hold up over time.

[05:49] We know there's a reason why Stern doesn't put a lot of mechs in their games.

[05:53] It's because artwork doesn't break and code doesn't break.

[05:57] So while we love these toys, will they hold up over time?

[06:01] We shall see.

[06:02] The other news with Stern is obviously the supply shortage.

[06:05] If you order a game today, a Godzilla premium today, you're not getting it to August or

[06:11] November of next year.

[06:13] It is crazy.

[06:14] It is not going to stop.

[06:16] We're also going to see new games while you wait.

[06:19] The reason why is Stern is contractually obligated to get future titles out.

[06:25] We're going to see Rush because they're contractually obligated.

[06:28] We're going to see James Bond because they're contractually obligated to get these games

[06:32] out in a timely manner.

[06:34] The wait is going to be horrible.

[06:36] The prices are going to go through the roof.

[06:40] We are going to see price increases on premiums and pros.

[06:43] We're already seeing it.

[06:45] People are listing games like Avengers Premium in box for like $10,000.

[06:51] And then we're just going to see the old Stern LEDs go through the roof.

[06:54] I mean, a Ghostbusters just sold for $22,000.

[06:58] Another Ghostbusters, Ellie, $20,000.

[07:00] So it's going to be crazy people.

[07:02] It's going to be crazy.

[07:03] I would recommend everybody out there who's followed this hobby for a while.

[07:09] Just close your wallet for six months and see how it shakes out.

[07:14] It's going to shake out.

[07:16] These prices are not going to stay this high.

[07:19] This is the peak of pinball pricing.

[07:22] If you buy a Ghostbusters for $22,000, there's no room to go up market.

[07:28] It's going to pay $25,000, $30,000 to take it off your hands.

[07:32] A game that's sat for two years.

[07:34] You can get a Ghostbusters Ellie for $7,000 to $8,000.

[07:38] And nobody really wanted them.

[07:39] They sat.

[07:40] And I'm talking about the Ellie's people.

[07:42] This stuff wasn't like sale pending immediately when they were those prices.

[07:46] So just be patient.

[07:48] We're going through a moment.

[07:50] Maybe it's the crypto money.

[07:52] It's Canada's pinball podcast has been saying this for years that they haven't tapped into

[07:56] the real wealth of this hobby.

[07:58] I don't know what it is, but it's bonkers.

[08:01] It's fun to watch.

[08:02] I'm not jumping in at these prices, but it's fun to watch.

[08:05] All right.

[08:06] Next up on the list is Spooky Pinball, a company that went from 150 games to 1,750 games.

[08:14] That's over $14 million in revenue they're going to bring in on Halloween and Ultraman.

[08:21] And the big question remains, can Spooky Pinball make these games great?

[08:27] If you ask Spooky Pinball, they're absolutely going to make these games great.

[08:31] I mean, almost every day I see Spooky Luke on the forums keeping people at bay, telling

[08:36] people what's coming in the games, all the stuff they have planned for these games.

[08:41] And I'm almost at the point now where I don't even care.

[08:44] I don't care if Luke comes on the pin side.

[08:46] I don't care what anyone at Spooky Pinball says.

[08:49] My only thing is this, Spooky Pinball, you are selling 1,750 games.

[08:55] You have built up years of goodwill.

[08:58] Don't mess it up.

[08:59] The ball is in your court.

[09:01] I'm not going to beat a dead horse on a daily basis over this, but you have a ways to

[09:06] go to make these games great and you know that.

[09:09] And now the proof is going to be in the pudding.

[09:11] You will erode the goodwill if these games turn out just to be mediocre.

[09:17] 1,750 customers now.

[09:19] This isn't 500 customers.

[09:21] This isn't 300.

[09:23] This isn't 150.

[09:25] And everyone came to your door because of the goodwill you've built up.

[09:29] It's because of stuff like Rick and Morty and stuff like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[09:34] But the game has changed, guys.

[09:35] You're in the big leagues now.

[09:37] You're making a lot of games.

[09:38] You're charging a lot of money.

[09:40] And I don't care what companies say on pin side or on Facebook.

[09:44] I want their actions to speak louder than their words.

[09:48] OK?

[09:49] And that's all it is now.

[09:50] That's all it is now.

[09:51] These games are out.

[09:52] These games have been put into the world.

[09:54] They need work.

[09:55] They need to hire more talent.

[09:57] And everyone knows the big dark dirty little secret that only Canada will say and nobody

[10:02] else will back me on this is spooky pinball needs to hire designers.

[10:08] They need designers.

[10:09] They should borrow some designers from Jersey Jack Pinball who doesn't need four designers.

[10:14] I just Jersey Jack have four designers and they can't get more than one game made every

[10:18] two years.

[10:19] And spooky pinball has only in house design teams and they're making two games in 18 months.

[10:25] What's the deal?

[10:26] I think spooky pinball should call up Jersey Jack and borrow one of their designers.

[10:30] And they also need a senior designer who knows how to make amazing pinball machines.

[10:35] And that's the other thing everyone says in the shadows but they won't say it out loud.

[10:39] Is that spooky games have never been designed masterpieces.

[10:42] And at these price points.

[10:43] And at these many customers willing to go in with you spooky.

[10:47] It's time to hire a great designer and get a great programming team on board.

[10:52] You're there.

[10:53] This is the company now Chuck.

[10:54] This is no longer a little home brew company.

[10:57] You're now bringing in multi millions of dollars.

[10:59] It's time to act like it.

[11:01] Okay.

[11:02] We'll see what happens with spooky pinball.

[11:04] All right Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:06] Everyone is still waiting for toy story.

[11:09] Guns in roses has been out for an entire year.

[11:12] It's been a mixed bag year for guns and roses.

[11:14] I still think it's one of the greatest pinball machines we've seen.

[11:18] It's a concert in a box.

[11:19] People keep hating me when I say that.

[11:21] It is what it is.

[11:22] So Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:24] Are we going to see toy story anytime soon?

[11:27] That's the major question mark.

[11:28] We now want to turn a page and get to the future of JJP which is toy story, which is Eric

[11:34] Minier's next game, which is Steve Rich's next game.

[11:37] I think everyone is like we are not going to see Steve Rich's next game until sometime

[11:41] maybe in 2023.

[11:43] Why did they also bring on a fourth designer?

[11:46] Doesn't make much sense.

[11:48] We'll see what happens with Jersey Jack pinball.

[11:50] Everybody.

[11:51] Everyone wants to see.

[11:53] Will toy story be the swan song of Pat Lawler?

[11:57] Will he finally hit a homerun?

[11:59] You know, I was talking to someone about this that the Bally Williams gods, like the icons

[12:04] of the Bally Williams era, they have all I believe sort of swung and missed over the

[12:09] last few years.

[12:10] Think about it.

[12:11] Pat Lawler hasn't had a unanimous hit.

[12:14] Pat Lawler hasn't had unanimous hits since being at JJP.

[12:17] Steve Richie hasn't made a successful game in a really long time despite having the best

[12:22] themes over at Stern.

[12:24] Brian Eddie has also swung and missed at the plate now two times at Stern pinball.

[12:29] John Papaduke total failure, right?

[12:31] It's like all these icons from back in the day and they're getting best at by Keith

[12:36] Elwin, by Eric Minier, by Scott Dinesi.

[12:39] I mean, it's just the way it is people and I'm wondering, does he have one more in the

[12:43] tank?

[12:44] Does Pat Lawler have one more in the tank?

[12:47] And will he retire after toy story?

[12:49] So we shall see.

[12:51] We shall see.

[12:52] I do know that he probably had to start over because everybody can see it.

[12:57] Willy Wanko was toy story.

[12:58] Oh, canada keeps saying it.

[13:00] Stop saying it, canada.

[13:01] All right, let's go over to Chicago Gaming Company, revealed cactus canyon remake in

[13:05] one of the sloppiest reveals ever.

[13:08] And they keep saying we want to give people value.

[13:11] We want to give people the most for their money.

[13:13] So we're only going to charge 9200 for the Ellie.

[13:17] Then we're going to screw over the Ellie buyers by announcing the SE Plus.

[13:22] Then we're going to offer a mirrored backlash to everybody.

[13:26] Then we're going to charge you additional for Lyman Sheets code.

[13:29] Are you confused?

[13:30] I'm confused.

[13:32] They should be confused because as much as I love CGC, the launch of cactus canyon

[13:38] is all over the place.

[13:40] It is like they had no idea what they were doing as they were doing it.

[13:44] It's not an indictment of the game.

[13:46] I think the game is going to be built amazingly well.

[13:50] I think people out there who like cactus canyon are going to love this game.

[13:54] But man, they had one chance to really launch this game in a tight way that got people

[13:59] excited.

[14:00] And when I go on the forum, it's just.

[14:02] A bunch of people confused about when is the game shipping?

[14:06] How do I get this?

[14:07] Is the back glass a PPS exclusive?

[14:09] No, it's not.

[14:10] Is Lyman Sheets code going to be all new code or just polished?

[14:14] Everyone is somewhat confused about what's going on with this game.

[14:18] And unfortunately, confusion does not equal excitement.

[14:23] And I think they had a chance to get everyone excited about this game.

[14:27] And I think they should have waited and just launched it at T.P.F.

[14:31] I mean that.

[14:32] Why did they even launch it now?

[14:33] The games are not on the line.

[14:35] They could have launched it at T.P.F. with like a few hundred of them already built going

[14:41] out to customers.

[14:43] So they revealed it in a sloppy way.

[14:45] They don't have any games on the line.

[14:47] Nobody's getting them before the holidays.

[14:49] What was the point of launching cactus canyon when they did?

[14:54] You know, Kaneda's making a lot of sense.

[14:56] You know this is why your Twippy votes are going in this direction.

[14:59] But no, you might even vote for Kaneda for Best Pimball Streamer.

[15:02] Alright, let's go on to American Pimball.

[15:06] Another company that seemingly revealed the game and I'm not sure if Legends of Vahala

[15:12] is on the line or not.

[15:14] It's confusing as well.

[15:16] Our games being built right now, yes or no.

[15:20] So I saw that Rebel guitars has a game.

[15:23] Now I talked to Wes over there.

[15:25] And interesting, their games are not numbered out of 500.

[15:30] Can we do a hard stop there?

[15:32] If you know that when people buy your 1 of 500 Deluxe Edition, why aren't they numbering

[15:38] them out of 500?

[15:41] No where on the game does it say number this out of 500.

[15:46] There's no plaque.

[15:47] You have to go by the serial number, I guess, on the back of the game.

[15:51] David Fix, American Pimball, guys.

[15:54] We were willing to go along when you went from 300 to 500, but at least don't fumble

[16:00] this.

[16:01] It's not hard to label your limited edition games properly.

[16:06] Don't pull a Jersey Jack yellow brick road here and say like, well, we're going to make

[16:10] 500 Deluxe's this year and maybe we'll make some more.

[16:14] Why is there no plaque on this game that tells you what number you are out of 500?

[16:20] Now here's my overall take on this thing.

[16:22] This game launched at the best time possible.

[16:25] There is no inventory with distributors, so they bumped up the number to 500.

[16:29] Here's what I think is going to happen because these games are refundable, right?

[16:34] Spooky games are not refundable.

[16:35] Can you imagine if Halloween and Ultraman was refundable?

[16:40] How many people would get refunds right now?

[16:43] It would be scary the amount of people running to the bank to just get their deposits back

[16:46] because people are losing 50% of their deposits on Halloween and Ultraman right now.

[16:52] Now this title is not non-refundable, so while they sold 500 through, do you think they

[16:58] sold 500 to customers?

[17:00] I don't.

[17:01] There's no way 500 are sold.

[17:03] But here's what's interesting with this company and these orders.

[17:06] Let's say 50 of these games go out and people start to play them and the reviews are not

[17:11] amazing.

[17:12] You've got 450 more people waiting for their game.

[17:16] Are they going to get a refund?

[17:18] Are they going to try to resell it?

[17:19] What happens when people see which we know is going to happen that this game is not going

[17:23] to increase in value?

[17:25] So if you really want a Legends of Vahala, why would you pay $8400?

[17:30] You're going to be able to get this pin for $7400 or $7000 in like six months.

[17:35] We know that history has shown us that.

[17:39] Original IP games do not hold value at all.

[17:43] Look at dialed in.

[17:45] You can get a dialed in, Ellie, cheaper than a Legends of Vahala.

[17:50] There's nothing in Legends of Vahala next to dialed in, but that's the way these original

[17:55] IP games go.

[17:57] They head south.

[17:58] There's a reason Ghostbusters is $20,000.

[18:02] It's not because it plays like crap because it does play like crap.

[18:05] It's because it's Ghostbusters.

[18:08] That is why.

[18:09] That is the only reason why.

[18:11] And so we shall see the way this goes.

[18:13] But I do think the key learning they're going to have is that if you asked for non-refundable

[18:19] deposits on Legends of Vahala, how many actual orders would they have got?

[18:26] And then when are we going to see Dennis Norman's next title?

[18:29] That is going to be another original IP game.

[18:33] I don't believe in this original IP strategy.

[18:37] I don't think it's going to work out.

[18:39] I've told David Fix this.

[18:40] You got to mix it up.

[18:42] You can't go back to back on original IP games.

[18:45] It's not going to work.

[18:47] It's just not going to work.

[18:48] Alright, next on our list is P3 Multimorphic.

[18:51] What's happening over at P3 Multimorphic?

[18:54] Not much.

[18:55] Not much.

[18:56] The next thing that happened with this company will be Scott Denise working on a new title

[19:01] with them.

[19:02] Now where is the license theme that Jerry has been promising us?

[19:07] No, not sure where it is.

[19:09] I can guarantee you this.

[19:11] It is not going to be a license theme that's going to probably blow you away.

[19:17] Because after all these years, he has yet to put a hot license in his game.

[19:22] So we shall see if I were Jerry, I would look at something in the world of like anime or

[19:27] cartoon to really utilize that screen.

[19:30] The problem with the big screen is simply this.

[19:33] You need to program for it.

[19:35] It is a nightmare having to program that and the screen and also animate it in a way that

[19:41] looks good.

[19:42] So we'll see what happens.

[19:43] I hope something comes out on this platform that makes all of us say now we see the true

[19:49] potential of the P3 Multimorphic.

[19:51] Alright, let's talk about Dutch Pimball real quick.

[19:54] So not much to talk about with Dutch Pimball other than the fact that EA's are still

[19:58] patiently waiting for their games.

[20:02] My dream of seeing Barry design another game I don't think is ever going to happen.

[20:06] This company has been around for seven or eight years and we're still trickling out the

[20:11] same game.

[20:12] It's a sad story.

[20:14] The game is really amazing to look at.

[20:16] The code needs some work and the ultimate issue with the big Lebowski is quality.

[20:21] When I go into the threads, it's a nightmare keeping these games working properly.

[20:26] And that's a problem, you know.

[20:28] And so if you own one, you probably don't want to play it too much.

[20:32] You're probably buying backups of everything because you know this company is not going

[20:36] to be around forever.

[20:37] It's still a sad tale.

[20:39] It's still the greatest world on their glass since I've been covering Pimball and that

[20:44] is the Dutch Pimball story.

[20:46] Alright, Home Pin is next on my list.

[20:48] Where is Spinal Tap?

[20:50] So this is another one where they were contractually obligated to reveal Spinal Tap.

[20:55] But they announced it, but then they didn't show anything.

[20:58] Now I am telling you right now, I think when we see Spinal Tap, much like the movie itself,

[21:04] it's going to make all of us laugh out loud.

[21:07] It is.

[21:08] It's going to be, I think, a day late and a dollar short.

[21:11] I don't have confidence that Mike knows how to put a machine into the modern world that

[21:17] can be competitive with what's out there.

[21:20] And we shall see, but if those photos of the teaser are any indication of how the artwork

[21:25] is going to be, and it's just Photoshop dragged and dropped stuff, we're in for big trouble

[21:32] if we see this game and not big trouble and a little chine of a big trouble over at Home

[21:35] Pin.

[21:36] Alright, the Pimball Brothers.

[21:38] I have them next on my list with the alien remake.

[21:41] Are we going to see Queen Pimball from the Pimball Brothers?

[21:44] Here is my take on the Pimball Brothers and I'm just going to go through them quickly.

[21:48] This is another game where they tried to remake all of Andrew Highway's mistakes and

[21:53] they had some success doing it.

[21:55] The games are making their way out there, but it's another one.

[21:58] When you open up the thread, it's nothing but maintenance issues and quality issues.

[22:04] And I would be nervous going in on these machines.

[22:07] I would be nervous of long-term customer support.

[22:10] And it's just another one of these games, right?

[22:13] There's like this era of games.

[22:15] It's alien.

[22:16] It's big Lebowski.

[22:17] It's Predator.

[22:18] It's Cosmic Carnival.

[22:20] All these games came out around the same time and there's just no enthusiasm.

[22:25] There's no excitement.

[22:27] Especially the companies that burns people.

[22:29] You can't forget this people.

[22:30] That there are people that paid in full for alien that never got it.

[22:34] Same with Big Lebowski.

[22:36] And seven years later, five years later, they're still waiting on their product.

[22:41] These companies will never really turn it around.

[22:45] They won't.

[22:46] They'll always be a dark cloud that hangs over these products.

[22:49] And if you want one, fine, but you've got to be willing to lift the hood and do constant

[22:55] maintenance on these games.

[22:56] Now one game you can't lift the hood on is Fathom.

[23:00] Where is Fathom?

[23:01] Haggis Pimbal.

[23:02] The friendliest Pimbal company in the world who told people way back in the middle of

[23:08] the summer, we were going to get Fathoms on the line in July.

[23:12] Let's count the months again.

[23:13] I love doing this.

[23:15] Hi, August, September, October, November, we're almost at December.

[23:21] So five months of no Fathoms.

[23:24] By the end of the year, nobody will have a Fathom.

[23:27] And the question remains is this, why did Haggis take people's money?

[23:33] Why did they take people's money when they knew they didn't have any games on the line?

[23:37] So if you bought a Fathom, how do you not worry a little bit about what's happened in

[23:43] the past, that your money has gone to funding them building the factory?

[23:49] It didn't go to buying the parts for your Fathom.

[23:52] Now I don't know what Damian's spreadsheet looks like, but I do know history and I do know

[23:58] that when a company takes pre-order money and the games aren't being built, that that

[24:03] money evaporates into other areas and doesn't go towards the games themselves.

[24:09] And then what happens is this, to make those games, they're going to be in the red.

[24:14] There is no way around it.

[24:15] There is no way around it.

[24:17] And when you look at the factory and when you look at the statements, how they scaled up,

[24:21] they have to be losing money.

[24:23] They have to be losing money.

[24:24] Now do I think he's going to get you your Fathoms?

[24:27] Yes.

[24:28] Do I think the long-term viability of Haggis looks good right now?

[24:31] No I don't.

[24:33] Because they started a pinball company during the worst period ever.

[24:36] And before they had games on the line, they took consumer money.

[24:40] And that's a no-no.

[24:41] And that's a no-no.

[24:42] And all the years of seeing how this has happened, there's never been a single company

[24:46] that's done this.

[24:47] Think about it.

[24:48] Who has done this successfully?

[24:50] Taken this pre-order money and not run out of money.

[24:54] Every time someone does it, it ends in disaster.

[24:57] So why is it going to be different this time?

[25:00] Because they're nice people?

[25:01] I mean, it's amazing to me.

[25:03] Andrew Highway was the biggest sweetheart.

[25:06] And those of you who know, know this.

[25:08] Whenever you got Andrew on the phone, when it came to taking money, he was the nicest

[25:13] man on the planet.

[25:14] He was the biggest sweetheart.

[25:15] Once he had your money, he wanted nothing to do with you.

[25:19] Okay, let's move on.

[25:20] We'll see what happens.

[25:21] Haggis knows that they need to get games on the line.

[25:24] And we're not talking about Celts.

[25:26] We're talking about Fathoms.

[25:27] I think that covers off on everybody.

[25:30] I mean, pinball adventures is here, but who knows what's happening over there.

[25:34] We're never going to see circus maximises like pinball circus or whatever.

[25:39] Kingpin, that's never happening.

[25:40] I mean, seriously.

[25:41] Talk about bringing a game out too early.

[25:43] All right, everybody.

[25:44] This has been episode 629 of Canada's pinball podcast.

[25:48] It's good to be back on the big airwaves.

[25:50] There is going to be something I'm going to ask.

[25:53] All of you coming up very soon.

[25:55] And no, it's not to join the Canadian club.

[25:58] The twippies are happening.

[26:00] They are back.

[26:01] And so in December, I know we're going to make our way into the right end for pinball podcast.

[26:07] But if you've enjoyed all of my Facebook lives and all of my streaming efforts, I would

[26:13] love it if we could write in Canada's Saturday Mornings spectacular as favorite pinball

[26:19] streamer.

[26:20] Now, I think this would be the most amazing occurrence in the history of pinball content

[26:24] creation.

[26:25] The greatest pinball streamer of the year didn't actually play a single game of pinball.

[26:32] Can we at least get in the top three with this?

[26:34] This would be amazing.

[26:35] This would burn the Canadian haters so badly.

[26:39] But you have to admit, those shows are good.

[26:42] The Facebook lives are fun.

[26:44] I mean, actually enjoy doing Facebook lives more than this because it's raw.

[26:48] It's real.

[26:49] It's in person.

[26:50] And we get to talk back and forth in real time.

[26:52] It's so much fun.

[26:53] And we get at least 1,000 people watching every single one.

[26:57] So that's all I ask in December.

[26:58] When the right ends happen, let's put in Canada's Saturday Mornings spectacular or Canada

[27:02] Facebook live.

[27:03] Wherever you guys want to do it.

[27:05] And let's try to get on that ballot for favorite pinball streamer.

[27:09] Everybody, 629, happy to be back, happy to be here.

[27:13] Hopefully all of you had a great Thanksgiving.

[27:16] It's not going to be a very eventful December in pinball.

[27:19] The prices are going to go through the roof.

[27:22] Hold on to your wallet.

[27:23] Be patient.

[27:24] Use that money to spoil your kids, your wife.

[27:28] You're not going to be any cooler if you own a Ghostbusters Ellie for $22,000.

[27:32] In fact, most people will think you're a sucker if you buy a Ghostbusters Ellie for $22.5.

[27:38] And I get the guys who buy it or super rich, but they're not cool.

[27:42] It's not cool.

[27:43] You know, it's cool.

[27:44] I was in the pinball before all these rich guys marched in and I was in the pinball

[27:47] and I got my collection for peanuts or I paid what Stern thought the game was worth.

[27:53] That's when it's cool is when you actually have the relationships and get the games for

[27:57] the right prices.

[27:58] But you know what, the sky's the limit.

[28:00] We haven't seen anything yet.

[28:02] These prices are going to go through the roof.

[28:04] Be patient.

[28:05] And just listen to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[28:07] It's free.

[28:08] This is free.

[28:09] All right.

[28:10] You don't have to spend any money or $22.5.

[28:11] You get to enjoy this.

[28:13] And then you go about your day.

[28:14] Later everybody.

[28:15] I'm going to be here.

[28:16] You're doing great.

[28:17] I'll do it without you.

[28:18] We made like a dip.

[28:19] Sozi on par.

[28:20] I bought those on my dust.

[28:22] And I cried.

[28:23] Oh, the floor of my bedroom.

[28:25] Did you saw what I baked it?

[28:27] I really don't get it.

[28:29] I just got for you.

[28:31] Oh.

[28:32] I'm going to be here.

[28:34] I'm going to be here.

[28:37] For you, I guess you moved on really easily.
