[00:00] Gotta play me on something.

[00:02] Gotta play me on something.

[00:06] Play me on the rain.

[00:08] This was a ball.

[00:10] It's falling.

[00:12] Set up, set up, set up, set up, set up, set up.

[00:30] I'm in. He was gonna be like, uncuffed.

[00:32] We are gonna see American Pinball.

[00:34] Put all this pinball magic into a game.

[00:36] And it was gonna be campy.

[00:38] It was gonna be cheesy. It was gonna be funny.

[00:40] It was gonna be this 1950s sci-fi throwback pinball machine about ice cream and Galactic Tank Battles.

[00:46] And then you drop this video.

[00:48] And look, the only thing I can go on is the video they've shown all of us.

[00:52] And I just want to say this right now.

[00:54] And I've never seen this move before with any pinball launch since I've been watching pinball launches.

[00:58] American Pinball had to turn off the ability to leave comments on its YouTube channel where they premiered this video.

[01:07] I want to tell you right now, in my marketing profession, whenever you have to turn off comments on a social media platform like YouTube,

[01:15] it means you do not want to hear how people really feel about your thing.

[01:21] And I've never seen any pinball company do this.

[01:23] And it's fine if they want to try to control the narrative and live in a vacuum, but they made this video.

[01:29] They decided this was good enough to show the game to all of us for the first time.

[01:34] Even though all of us have been staring at this cabinet and this play field now for two weeks.

[01:39] And they had a moment, people. They had a moment.

[01:41] They had a captive audience in which everyone was tuning in at one o'clock today to see this game.

[01:47] What I don't like about this trailer, I'm not even gonna talk about the video clips that much.

[01:52] I don't like that this video showed us so little pinball.

[01:57] It is a pinball machine you are selling. You are not selling us on video assets.

[02:02] You're not selling us on live action.

[02:04] You are supposed to sell us on pinball magic and pinball moments.

[02:09] And I didn't see any pinball magic in this game.

[02:12] I didn't see anything mechanically happening in this game that was like, wow, did you see that happen?

[02:17] And after all of the hype, how this was the new American pinball, Dennis Norman, and he was bringing over Zofia,

[02:23] and she was gonna bring all of this engineering genius to this company.

[02:27] Where is the magic on a mechanical level in this game?

[02:30] Let me ask you a question, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:32] Did you see anything in Galactic Tank Force that was as cool as the milk can shot in Houdini?

[02:40] Did you see anything mechanical in this game that really made you say, wow,

[02:45] did the diverter that pops up and changes the direction of the ball?

[02:48] I don't know. That doesn't seem that great.

[02:50] The tank itself up the middle doesn't really do much.

[02:53] It just pops up as you hit the targets.

[02:55] There's a post between the flippers that lifts up.

[02:57] They didn't show anything about those lanes underneath the flippers themselves.

[03:01] They showed how we locked the balls in the game.

[03:04] But that's it. That's it.

[03:06] And then we get these video assets.

[03:09] And I'm just here to tell you, I felt they looked really cheesy.

[03:12] I felt they looked corny.

[03:14] And I know that's what they're going for.

[03:16] But what they did not achieve with these video clips is they did not achieve that can't be weird vibe of a 1950s sci-fi game.

[03:24] It doesn't look anything like that.

[03:26] These clips look like they're from a bad porno movie from the 1990s.

[03:31] And if the goal was to make a 1950s sci-fi throwback kind of game,

[03:36] they should have watched those movies and studied how they achieved that element.

[03:41] And when I'm looking at these clips, it leads me to believe they did not work with a video asset director

[03:47] who really had a vision on how to achieve that 1950s campiness.

[03:52] And it's bad. It's bad.

[03:54] And I can see the people on pin side are like, oh, it looks great. It looks funny.

[03:57] I was laughing the whole way through. How were you laughing all the way through?

[04:01] The only thing I was laughing at today is when I called the distributor

[04:05] to ask how much is the signature edition of this game,

[04:09] they're going to make 200 of them in which the only real difference is the 3D Translight.

[04:14] You get like a banner and a poster and some thermos and a lunchbox.

[04:18] The freaking signature edition is $17,500.

[04:23] I've never laughed so hard in my pinball life as I did at that price.

[04:28] Are you freaking kidding me? $17,500 for an original IP American pinball game

[04:36] that doesn't really have anything more than the $11,000 LE, which also comes in tank format.

[04:42] And then it makes total sense why they're making this signature edition.

[04:46] The only reason they're making it is to get people to buy the 500 LEs of the game.

[04:51] They want to make you feel like that $11,000 tank version is a bargain.

[04:57] And you almost have to be out of your mind to order that $17,500 version of the game.

[05:01] But again, I think it's a Trojan horse.

[05:03] I don't think they expect anyone to buy that top tier model.

[05:06] I think that is meant to sell those 500.

[05:08] I think they need to sell those 500.

[05:10] But I don't think anyone saw enough today to pull the trigger on this game.

[05:15] And maybe we're going to get more videos.

[05:17] We know that some arcades have the game on location, but this was not a good introduction to this game.

[05:23] I don't think I've had FOMO leave my body so quickly as I did after watching that two minute video.

[05:30] And it is what it is, ladies and gentlemen.

[05:32] We're going to see this game in Texas.

[05:34] We're going to see this game on location.

[05:36] But from what we're seeing right now, I think they did a piss poor job of getting people excited about this game.

[05:43] And I'm going to call it, it's all tank and mirrors right now.

[05:46] You know, they use that tank package to really get everybody excited about the campiness of this game.

[05:51] But I'm not seeing the magic of that cabinet pull through in the actual gameplay.

[05:56] I'm not seeing it pull through in the clips.

[05:58] And when I start to see stuff like Steve Bowden's in the game, I mean, what is happening right now?

[06:03] What are these companies doing?

[06:05] At this much money, you need to release a very highly polished, highly detailed product.

[06:12] It just feels like American Pinball made this like inside joke kind of game where they all had fun making it.

[06:17] But is that fun going to translate into a campy pinball machine that is worth like over $10,000?

[06:24] And I really am disappointed that with a straight face after taxes and everything,

[06:29] American Pinball thinks they can sell us a game for $18,000, almost $19,000.

[06:35] Think about that for a minute.

[06:36] And this greed is really going to kill Pinball.

[06:39] In original IP game for $18,500, Pinball is over.

[06:43] New Inbox Pinball will be dead if this is what people think an original IP game will go for.

[06:49] Look, and I understand why they're testing the market like this.

[06:52] They saw the James Bond's for $20,000.

[06:54] They see all these like Godfather just sold $1,000 for $15,000.

[06:59] I understand what they're looking at.

[07:01] But what American Pinball needs to look at is a mirror people because you don't have the Godfather.

[07:08] You don't have Pulp Fiction.

[07:09] You don't have that stuff.

[07:11] And I worry that if people run to a game like this, you know, I worry that people just don't know enough.

[07:16] And I'm just getting to the point now where I'm absolutely tired of not getting enough information,

[07:21] not seeing enough of the game.

[07:23] At the same time this game is launching, every single distributor is hitting up everybody saying,

[07:29] buy it now, send in your deposit, and your deposit is non-refundable.

[07:33] Do you know how much the non-refundable deposit is on this signature edition of the game?

[07:38] A $5,000 non-refundable deposit on that version of the game.

[07:43] We are not this stupid.

[07:45] We are not.

[07:46] I understand FOMO, but how can you have FOMO for an original IP game?

[07:51] It's not like you grew up with Galactic Tank Force.

[07:53] This was the easiest game for me ever to say no to at these prices.

[07:58] Now, obviously the Ellie is a much better buy.

[08:01] It's the only thing I would even consider.

[08:03] We didn't see anything about the tank, how it folds down.

[08:06] Is it implemented in any way in gameplay?

[08:09] We didn't see how the topper works with gameplay.

[08:12] We didn't even get like 30 seconds of unedited pinball action in this trailer.

[08:17] They didn't do a good job of showing you how any of this stuff works together.

[08:21] And that is why I am reacting this way.

[08:23] I think there's a reason why this is what they launched with.

[08:27] I think they might be a little bit nervous that these assets and the acting in this video

[08:33] is going to be very polarizing.

[08:35] I've never seen a pinball company launch a game and turn off comments on YouTube.

[08:41] The moment you turn off the comments, that means you do not want to face the music.

[08:46] Now look, I feel good I get to play this game soon at Jack Bar.

[08:50] I'm going to play it soon at Texas Pinball Festival.

[08:53] But I have not seen any reason why.

[08:55] I would separate 11 or 13 or 8 or 9 or 15 or 18 or $19,000 on this game

[09:03] until they show us more of this game.

[09:06] I'm hoping straight down the middle has a video associated with this game.

[09:10] I'm not sure.

[09:11] This is one of the worst launch videos I've ever seen in pinball.

[09:14] They have nobody to blame but themselves.

[09:16] And I think the flame is going to go out real fast on this game

[09:19] if they don't start to show people a lot more reasons why they should buy this game.

[09:23] And that's just it everybody.

[09:25] Galactic tank force.

[09:26] Everybody was excited and they launched with a total whimper.

[09:30] The tank has misfired and blown itself up.

[09:33] They need to get something more exciting out into the marketplace.

[09:37] I don't see how you can expect people to part with this much money

[09:40] if this is what you're going to show them.

[09:42] It's 2023 and I think we need to keep our wallets in our pockets

[09:47] and wait and see a lot more before we commit to a game like this.

[09:51] And I'm sorry to my distro friends but that's how Canada feels later.
