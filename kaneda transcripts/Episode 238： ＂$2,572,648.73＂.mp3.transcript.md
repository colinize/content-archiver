[00:00] And the rear view never is the motherfucking log I got two choices y'all pull over the car on bounce on the devil put the pedal to the floor

[00:07] And I try to know how to change the game, but I got a few dollars like a fight

[00:11] Hey, pull over to the side of the road I heard

[00:15] I want to say one number and I want this number to sink in real deep

[00:27] 2,572,648 what is that number signify?

[00:36] Well it might signify the amount of times the pin-side moderation team has dropped the fucking ball

[00:42] That's a close number to that. It's also probably the same number of times that Hilton has shielded

[00:49] Alien and predator pinball machines to the community but remains a member of pin-side

[00:54] We're going to talk about that got some interesting inside information on Hilton and pin-side

[01:00] I'm going to share with you guys in this episode

[01:02] Maybe it's the number of times Andrew highway said he would have your game in two weeks

[01:07] Or maybe it's another number of times that iceman has flip flop on his positioning of companies

[01:14] Like highway pinball of zidware of deep route now right?

[01:19] We could keep applying this number to different things in the pinball community

[01:22] Maybe it's the number of times a new-stern play field dimples or the number of times cabinets will crack

[01:29] But no

[01:31] This number is actually and I want to repeat it 2,572,648 dollars and 73 cents

[01:44] That is the amount of money that highway pinball is in debt or in the red

[01:51] And finally after all these years of saying stuff about this company

[01:56] We're finally starting to pull back the curtain and get the truth

[02:01] About the actual financials of highway pinball and how bad it was

[02:08] Up until this year before the the new investors called it quits

[02:12] And here's what we're going to talk about on this episode of pin-canada pinball podcast

[02:16] I want to talk a little bit about this all right. I want to talk a little bit about

[02:21] um

[02:22] Christopher francey's tips on how to make a good pinball podcast because my god until he told us how to do it

[02:29] We were all clueless about how to make a pinball podcast work

[02:32] So thank Chris we're gonna we're gonna talk about your tips and see if we can apply them to the show

[02:38] We're gonna read some of your mail

[02:40] And then I'm also gonna talk about

[02:43] Something else that I've been holding back and and it has to do with pin-side

[02:48] Because I just saw a thread about

[02:51] Pin-side's interview with or there's a this week in pinball interview with robin

[02:56] And and then I saw that people were just commenting on it and actually getting

[03:01] ejected from the thread for commenting on an interview

[03:06] About robin and pin-side and I'm gonna talk about that later and what I'm gonna also do later on is I'm gonna do something that

[03:13] I wasn't going to do and I and I've held off on doing this

[03:17] But a pin-side moderator shared with me

[03:22] Something that moderator force flow had ridden to

[03:26] To sort of rally the moderators and try to convince you on pin-side that canators is really bad guy that deserves to be banned for life

[03:34] And I want to I want to read to you the agenda of the pin-side moderation staff and how biased they are

[03:40] And I do hold a grudge against these clowns because they

[03:44] They sat on

[03:46] Information that could have helped people

[03:49] refund their money for alien and they knew they knew the situation at highway was dire and grim

[03:57] Early on in 2016 and they did not let me share that information with you

[04:02] They willingly held it back and I love that robin and the moderators

[04:06] Just want to walk away and act like it's no big deal now and that they did the best they could bullshit

[04:12] They dropped the fucking ball and they deserve to be called out on it

[04:16] And you know what no one else think about it nobody else can call them out on their bullshit because

[04:23] Every other podcast out there every other personality and pin-ball out there

[04:28] They hold on to their pin-side handle like it's some precious little thing that they don't want to lose

[04:34] And I feel bad for them all because you cannot be outspoken about the moderators about robin about people like Hilton

[04:42] Because they will simply

[04:44] BAN you and then you have no outlet

[04:47] To communicate the truth

[04:49] And so I think that's why they fear and

[04:52] Load this podcast so very much wasn't it hysterical when we won best

[04:59] Twippy podcast and Hilton went on a rampage about how the votes were rigged and I love how he's like only

[05:06] Pinside registered users should be allowed to vote in the twippies

[05:11] What a what a dirtbag he really thinks that people that like I that I was the one who voted for myself and like scammed

[05:20] The system when he himself admitted to creating alias accounts in the twippy voting

[05:26] You know pool so whatever but we're gonna get there. We're gonna get there

[05:29] But let's talk about that two

[05:31] Million dollar plus number of highway pinball and what happened was this

[05:38] They are liquidating the company and there is an amazing story on pinball news that goes over

[05:44] The entire 30 page documentation of what happens when a pinball company is liquidated

[05:51] And I really think it's important for people to read that story and understand

[05:56] That when a pinball company fails it isn't just a few people that go down with that ship

[06:03] There are a lot of people that have been burned that when a company of highway pinball size collapses

[06:10] It's not just the workers there and the guys who ordered pinball machines that get fucked

[06:15] It is

[06:16] Everyone from suppliers

[06:19] You know to even like the the governments that gave

[06:23] Highway pinball loans to operate get fucked and it is important

[06:29] It is very important that people understand this story and that they actually don't shy away from it

[06:36] And I have to call I have to call friend of the show iceman out on this

[06:40] I don't know why he keeps going on pinside and saying hey everybody like you lost your money

[06:45] Just forget about it move on like he doesn't want to even have a discussion

[06:50] About what happened and I'm sorry ice, but you're wrong when a pinball company fails and drags all these people down

[06:58] It's not just like well. I just lost 1500 bucks. Let's forget about it and move on

[07:04] That's not how adults learn that's not how people learn a lesson

[07:09] When something happens

[07:11] It's usually after the fact that we're able to study and learn

[07:15] The the magnitude of what actually occurred with highway pinball

[07:19] And I think it's an important lesson for everyone to read and understand that when you do

[07:25] Try to just blindly support pinball and give your money to a pinball company

[07:30] A lot more is that stake than just your precious little alien pinball machine

[07:36] And I think that is the thing that I have the biggest issue with is a lot of these guys on pinside

[07:41] All they cared about was their fucking alien pinball machine

[07:45] And they didn't realize that by supporting someone like Andrew who was a liar who was a fraud who was a charlatan

[07:52] They were actually aiding and abetting

[07:55] Much bigger problem than just not getting your precious little pinball machine

[08:00] And a lot of the people in the pinball hobby on the forums

[08:03] They just get stars in their eyes about their precious machines

[08:07] And they could care less that the employees are being abused

[08:11] That people's money is being you know used in in like disingenuous ways

[08:16] That all these things are at risk

[08:18] I don't care if he shows up with a flipping machine all is good

[08:21] Right we heard that over and over again

[08:24] We heard people like Hilton just point at full throttle and just say look

[08:28] Everything is good in in highway pinball land

[08:31] And now Hilton what do you have to say that the company that you kept telling people was in great shape

[08:36] Is two and a half million dollars in the whole right

[08:40] So the other thing is this

[08:43] Let's when you look at who's owed money and who is part of this liquidation

[08:48] It's really sad that some of our friends in the pinball hobby are losing a lot of money

[08:55] So let's take for example on when they itemize out who the money is owed to

[09:00] 80,000 pounds

[09:03] All right 80,000 pounds

[09:05] Was paid to Andrew highway by coin taker and in us dollars that is

[09:12] 108,000 dollars

[09:14] Chris and Melissa gave to Andrew highway

[09:18] To get alien machines that they never received and I just want to say

[09:24] How much of a piece of shit? I think Andrew highway is for

[09:30] For putting people like Chris and Melissa who are hard working in a position now where they're out that much money

[09:38] Right a pinball distributor

[09:40] They they're this is not the most profitable business on the planet

[09:45] It's hard to swallow a six figure loss like that all right and then RS pinball, which is another distributor

[09:53] They're owed a

[09:55] 148,500

[09:57] $100

[09:59] Um in items that they never got from highway pinball

[10:03] Nitro pinball

[10:04] smartly is only on the hook for 6400 all right

[10:08] That this is just incredible right. It's incredible

[10:12] So that's 262,900 dollars that are owed to the three main distributors at the time when Andrew left the company

[10:23] All right

[10:24] That is that is just just think about that number for a second all right

[10:28] So at the time of the takeover when the new investors took over

[10:34] There was more than 630,000 650 dollars was owing in games or potential refunds

[10:41] You know so

[10:43] I here's the thing that I can't understand I can't understand and and I'm sorry like I just we need to deconstruct this story

[10:49] I don't understand

[10:51] How Andrew highway is claiming that the investors did a three-month audit of the company

[10:59] And then he kept saying how these are smart men who took who did their due diligence

[11:04] And they did all this work to determine that highway pinball was worth salvaging

[11:11] And they took three months to audit the company and then they agreed that it was worth taking over

[11:17] And yet when we look at these numbers at the time in which Andrew departed the company

[11:23] These numbers indicate that everything was

[11:26] Anything but in a good place that that they were

[11:30] Hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that they owed so much money when you look at the balance sheets

[11:37] You know, there was like a year where I you know, I think they like they made like 30,000 dollars in 2016 and their operating costs like

[11:45] 250,000 dollars so think about that for a minute you spend like over 200,000 dollars in operating costs

[11:51] To not even get 50,000 dollars back in profit and that is just insane

[11:57] Insane and it speaks to the complete mismanagement of the company all right

[12:03] So what I can't understand is what did those investors see like why did they go in on this deal

[12:10] and does that give

[12:13] Some credibility to the rumor that they were just trying to liquidate the thing from the get go

[12:19] And they didn't plan on actually trying to make it work. I don't know

[12:22] I don't really know who to believe in in that part of the deal

[12:26] What we do know is this they inherited a sinking ship that there was nothing they were going to be able to do

[12:33] To fix the problems with highway pinball that the game was not

[12:38] Engineered properly that the amount of work it would take to get alien pinball to be a viable product that was reliable

[12:47] was just

[12:48] Too much money required to do that and so they're they're called it quits all right. There's some other stuff here that I want to talk about

[12:58] The Welsh government is apparently owed 75,000 pounds so this was probably given to them

[13:07] um

[13:08] You know as as a business benefit that or grant from the government to highway pinball

[13:13] Um that they're that's they're now in eligible for all right

[13:18] So that's really interesting. I mean just interesting seeing like the Welsh government

[13:22] On the list of people owed money by highway pinball. It was also really funny seeing

[13:28] The investors and the employees of highway pinball who have shares in the company and all those shares

[13:36] Are now absolutely worthless worthless

[13:40] I feel bad for them. I feel bad because these these individuals they went into this venture thinking

[13:47] that they were going to get

[13:49] A stake in a successful pinball company and we all know that was one of the things Andrew was promising these people

[13:55] So two and a half million dollars in debt company being liquidated

[14:00] We know that there is merchandise and machinery

[14:03] That was highly expensive that is now either missing or transferred over to pinball brothers

[14:10] It's also very interesting to me

[14:12] Like how this whole deal is happening like how how are they taking

[14:17] Highway pinball items that Andrew highway bought and transferring those items to pinball brothers and starting a new pinball venture

[14:27] And and just erasing the debts and the obligations of highway pinball

[14:33] Does are they going to be able to do that are they going to be able to just start a new

[14:38] Without obligating all those people whose money is now lost on highway pinball

[14:45] So I don't know how you do that

[14:47] I don't know how you even pull that off and I don't know how you expect people to forget

[14:53] That you're the same people that that was you know that that bought highway pinball and these aren't that and let's just remind people

[15:01] These aren't the people that bought highway pinball these these these people were highway pinball from day one

[15:08] These aren't new investors these were the original

[15:11] Investors of highway pinball. I feel bad for these guys. They have they have been involved with Andrew highway since

[15:18] 2012

[15:21] Six years they've had to put up with this shit to just lose two and a half million dollars and probably a lot more than that

[15:29] I can't imagine I would love to ask there's like four or five of these investors. I would love to ask all of their wives

[15:37] How do you feel that your husband got involved and just lost millions of pounds

[15:45] chasing a pinball venture

[15:47] How stupid how stupid right if these gentlemen if they took that two and a half million pounds and

[15:54] And invested six years ago in

[15:57] Amazon or the smp 500 or any blue chip company

[16:03] They would have quadrupled that money by now instead they invested in Andrew highway's pinball venture

[16:10] I know when people hate when I do that like hindsight with money, but seriously how

[16:15] F. N. dumb was it to back that horse and and go down in flames with with with Andrew so

[16:23] We now see the numbers and I think this now also

[16:27] Painstory reality for people in pinball. We all say making pinball is hard

[16:31] But I think a lot of people have no idea the amount of money it takes and the amount of people involved in a pinball venture

[16:40] Because there other rumors I used to hear was how many millions of dollars Jersey jack pinball was in debt

[16:47] When he was making the hobbit and wizard of Oz and things weren't going well

[16:52] And I think this number of two and a half million dollars at highway pinball in operation

[16:58] That was always a Mickey Mouse operation. I mean if you look at the production video of Andrew highway

[17:04] You know the one where he holds up the hex post and he's like we just bought this machine

[17:08] And he does the factory tour and he's just kind of like randomly picking stuff out of boxes and be like here

[17:13] We have some motors here. We have some dildos. You know that that video

[17:17] I think if you go watch that video you'll understand like where the two and a half million dollars went down the toilet

[17:23] But it also it also should be a

[17:27] Word of caution that people out there that when pinball companies aren't run efficiently and effectively

[17:35] The amount of money the that you will go into the red in will be in the millions millions not not a few hundred thousand dollars

[17:43] And so I do think it gives even more sort of credibility to the rumors

[17:48] That Jersey Jack was probably millions in red when when the investor came in and I'm also still hearing that that company is still pretty much operating in the red

[17:59] I mean I I would love for to get an email from anyone over there

[18:03] But do you think Jersey Jack pinball is is making a profit in in 2018 and 2017 like like profit like

[18:11] The the amount of money they're making is has them in the green versus their operating cost

[18:19] I remember when I got the tour from jack and he's saying look at all these parts the five million dollars in parts

[18:24] He said five million dollars in parts

[18:27] When you have five million dollars in parts in your warehouse

[18:32] That's not good you want five million dollars in machines out in customer homes or out on location

[18:40] You don't want to be stockpiling five million dollars in parts

[18:44] And one of the reasons I heard that they um that they fired the CEO

[18:49] Was that he completely mismanaged Jersey Jack pinball and he

[18:53] He he was responsible for like over ordering parts

[18:57] That there weren't orders for those games

[19:00] So there's like just tons of hobbit pot parts lying around and there's not that many hobbit orders

[19:06] And that put the company into a financial like hole

[19:10] And so that's why he's gone that's why he's gone

[19:13] Um, you know if I'm wrong, I would love someone to correct me, but that's what I'm hearing that's what I'm hearing

[19:19] Um, so two and a half million dollars plus

[19:23] That is the end result of of highway pinballs

[19:26] financial state

[19:28] And I just want to say

[19:31] I'm sorry to all of you who lost money. I really am from the bottom of my heart

[19:36] I tried as hard as I could

[19:38] To get you guys the information you need it

[19:42] You need it to make a smart decision with your money and it was a parent

[19:48] From early on in 2016 that things were not going well people were trying to share the information

[19:55] They were putting up information on pinsoy that showed the financials of the company

[20:00] And I still think there's this pipe dream

[20:03] That they could have pulled it out and here's why

[20:07] You can't pull it out

[20:09] because

[20:11] You can't go millions of dollars into the red in a pinball company

[20:17] And you can't make up those losses ever

[20:21] With the profit margins on a pinball machine because the volume is not there

[20:26] See pinball is not like Microsoft releasing Xbox

[20:30] And the first Xbox they're willing to take a loss on just to get the user base up

[20:36] To then eventually break even and then eventually make money the reason why you can't do that in pinball

[20:43] Is because microsoft they make their money with windows and their other programs and so they could absorb a loss

[20:53] In their gaming division because their other

[20:56] Departments were highly profitable in the in the billions of dollars

[21:01] But when you're highway pinball and you come out the gate with full throttle and nobody buys it

[21:07] And you're immediately in debt and then you're trying to build alien and so you're in debt

[21:12] So you you have no money your first game is a failure

[21:16] You can't afford to pay suppliers you can't afford to pay employees

[21:20] You can't afford to design the game and do all the quality control needed to make sure it's a good game

[21:25] So you've got no money to work with all right, and then so then you end up where you're at you can't go into production

[21:32] You you stall you have to buy time you need new money to come in to bail you out, but the new money coming in

[21:39] um for games is actually going to the r&d of the games that are already sold

[21:46] So you're fucked you are fucked you are under a mountain of debt and there is no way out

[21:52] There's absolutely no way out and we saw we we predicted that on this show

[21:57] We tried to tell you guys if you just look at it from a macro standpoint

[22:01] You're never gonna get your money back

[22:03] You're never gonna get your refund. You're never gonna get your game. There's no way they can make it work

[22:08] And it didn't work

[22:09] And then we have Dutch pinball who's probably going through a very similar thing like I get there trying to get production up again

[22:17] But how can they actually climb out of the financial hole they're in?

[22:21] The only way they could do it

[22:23] Is if they charge much more per each labowski because there's no way they can go two years of

[22:32] Rear you know re-r&d in the game with a whole new manufacturing company build it in China train the Chinese pay for the airline

[22:39] Take it's pay pay to go to different shows

[22:41] How do you do that like where does the money come from?

[22:44] Where does the money come from and I think Jersey jack because they got their billionaire angel investor

[22:49] You know they got lucky like very very lucky and look if you have a billionaire backer

[22:55] You could probably go

[22:57] 50 years losing money in the pinball industry because the guy doesn't care

[23:01] He's just the hobbyist who's okay with losing a few million dollars each year because it's something he loves and look

[23:08] That when you become that wealthy and you have that deep of a pocket

[23:13] It doesn't matter like all bets are off because then you're just in odd world economics and

[23:18] And and they can they can survive forever

[23:21] You know money changes everything as Cindy lawper said like you have you have enough money

[23:26] You can do whatever you want like Robert Mueller

[23:29] He's financing deep route. He's the sole investor in it. He might have other investors as well. I'm not sure

[23:36] But you know what he's he's got a fighter's chance because it's all his money

[23:42] You know, I'd feel better. I feel better when a wealthy guy

[23:47] Says he's gonna make a pinball machine than a than a guy who's got nothing going on right now

[23:53] You know, we're not got no money in the bank

[23:55] Especially these companies are trying to make it at scale now. You don't need millions of dollars to make a pinball machine

[24:01] That's the other

[24:02] fallacy

[24:04] You need millions of dollars to make a big pinball company

[24:08] But if you want to make a small boutique number of games

[24:12] It doesn't require millions of dollars, right?

[24:14] It didn't take millions of dollars to make the matrix game those guys made

[24:17] They could have done a run of 25 and sold a meach for like 15 grand and they would have sold everyone

[24:22] And the movie studio never would have known and they would have been that they should have done that

[24:27] I think they left money on the table

[24:28] What was the point of doing all that work for that game and making just five they could have sold 20

[24:33] They did all the work

[24:34] All right, same is true like boutique small boutique runs we see it all the time with the homebrew guys

[24:39] It you can do it you can do it

[24:41] What you can't do is started large scale pinball company with no no capital all right all right

[24:48] So I don't know how much more of the story is gonna go on

[24:52] But when it does happen we will cover it and sorry iceman

[24:55] We're not gonna just move on because that's not the way the world should work

[25:01] People shouldn't just get away with stuff and then we shouldn't just apply silence

[25:06] When we're analyzing what actually happened with the company all right

[25:10] So I think it's important especially for you ice

[25:13] To read what this guy did and to discuss it

[25:17] All right

[25:18] Let's move on to like you know a more jovial topic and then we'll end with with pin sides agenda against canada

[25:25] That is really funny, but let's let's talk about this podcast and Christopher fransche has a

[25:32] Facebook post

[25:34] about

[25:35] His tips on

[25:36] Pinball podcasting and you all know Christopher fransche he's he's one of our

[25:41] Our favorite

[25:43] Guest of the show. I love his artwork

[25:46] He is I think

[25:49] Probably he's my favorite

[25:53] It's hard to say my favorite artist in all of pinball right now, but I do think his artwork just applies so well to pinball machines

[26:00] And he's also coming out with his own

[26:04] His own pinball podcast it is it is coming soon

[26:09] It is called something like silver ball pinball podcast where he it's gonna be a monthly show

[26:14] Where he interviews a pinball designers now. I think that's great

[26:19] I I'm assuming he's gonna get just the stern design team on which is great

[26:25] For some reason stern designers they always say they're gonna come on my show and then they always don't

[26:30] It's like they have to like go in and beg Zach and and and the stern management team to come on the show

[26:36] I still think it was really lame that I interviewed Jared and and he didn't say anything bad and then he

[26:43] He brought the interview to stern management and they wouldn't even let me air it. I mean come on

[26:48] I mean seriously. I think I've done enough

[26:51] Supporting of stern pinball on this show then as much as anyone else has and I think I've you know

[26:57] I've held them accountable at times. I own a stern machine

[27:02] I've owned in my life. I've owned four pinball machines

[27:06] I've and two of them have been sterns. I owned a lord of the rings which I still consider to be

[27:12] The greatest stern pinball machine of all time. I think without a doubt

[27:16] The lord of the rings pinball I think is as good as pinball can ever get

[27:21] I know there are long ball times. You know, you know who hates the long ball times

[27:25] They're really good tournament players who don't understand like

[27:30] World under glass and fun like they just want like scoring scoring scoring like go those guys can go play total nuclear annihilation all day long to the cows come home

[27:39] but lord of the rings

[27:41] Best theme integration best modes. It's just it's like it was Keith that is finest before Keith just

[27:48] Became too much Keith like new Keith is ridiculous. It's over the top. It's over produced. It's overly complex

[27:55] The fact that Keith put 22 characters to select from empires of the Caribbean in my book is a fireable offense

[28:03] Like Jersey Jack cannot rain his guys in Keith needs to get back to understanding the simplicity of what makes pinball really fun

[28:11] You can you can make pinball simple to understand but also have the right kind of depth and the games that have that are like every lime and sheets games

[28:21] Keith old games have it

[28:24] um

[28:25] And you know maiden's got it. I keep hearing from people maiden's got that and then pirates the Caribbean

[28:30] Oh, you can select from 22 different characters that you know 18 of which you you don't give a fuck about and then you have to like

[28:36] You have to like understand how each character like makes the game different and then I watch the video of the game in every mode

[28:42] Seems to seem to seem the same anyway. Anyway, I'm gonna stop. I'm gonna stop

[28:45] But let's talk about Christopher franchise tips

[28:49] For a pinball podcast on it. Let's see if canadus pinball podcasts actually accomplishes these tips

[28:54] He writes before I begin

[28:56] Please understand that these tips are intended to help you achieve success with your show

[29:01] Not to insult you if you feel any of these tips hit close to home

[29:05] These are just the things your friends are afraid to tell you well first question I have Chris is um

[29:10] How many pinball podcasts have you done bro to be able to sit in this position

[29:15] To give us these tips. I think Chris did some radio before

[29:20] But let me tell you something man when you start doing pinball shows

[29:24] It's a lot different so I look forward to your show. I look forward to see how you do it

[29:29] But it's kind of funny to me that a guy who's never done a single pinball show is giving people tips for success

[29:37] All right, so he writes number one

[29:39] If you're a host or co-host of a show and talk slow and stumble over and repeat words when drunk

[29:46] Avoid drinking before your show

[29:48] Unless you're martin robins

[29:50] Seriously, it's embarrassing and awful to try and listen to avoid alcohol unless you're third fourth or fifth in the pecking order on a show

[29:59] That will allow non-drunk people to keep the show moving

[30:02] Ignoring this ignore this post if you're if the name of your show is sloppy boring shit show

[30:08] All right, so what he's saying is don't get drunk and do a podcast

[30:11] now look

[30:12] I have to agree that when you drink too much and you do a podcast

[30:17] It's not always the right thing to do it you will come across and I've done it before

[30:23] I mean you start to slur your words and your thoughts aren't as cohesive

[30:27] I've even interviewed people when I was like too drunk and I'm like oh and I feel that's and I and I really really really

[30:35] Don't ever want to do that again because I also think it's disrespectful to the people you're interviewing

[30:40] To be talking to them and you're not all there and and you're not you know you're slur in your words and you're making it like painful

[30:47] To to listen to so I agree with Chris on that point all right his second point

[30:53] Don't spend half of your show going over how is your week no one really cares take three to five minutes at best

[31:00] Just to warm up but spending 30 45 60 minutes discussing what you did

[31:06] Especially if it's the the topic of the show is pinball is of no interest to anyone stories that are funny to you and your friends are rarely funny to people who don't know you

[31:16] Um, yeah, man. I agree, but I think I mean there we all know which pinball podcast do that and that's why I can't make it pass like

[31:25] 10 minutes of most shows because I don't understand why people do a pinball pod

[31:30] podcast and and talk about the most random shit so I agree with that

[31:34] I think we don't do that at all we get right to it right

[31:37] All right number three don't alienate people from your show what I mean by this is if you are

[31:43] Female never say something like we'd love to have you on our show if you're a woman

[31:49] We prefer women. This is a show for women

[31:52] Show should not be for a certain group you limit your possibility for wider appeal and success

[32:00] When you alienate half of your potential audience. I just want to stop there Chris

[32:05] If you think half of the potential audience of a pinball podcast are women

[32:11] You are you are taking a drug that we have not identified yet on planet earth

[32:18] Uh, have you been to a pinball show man? I would love to see

[32:24] Uh, Stern's uh, you know buyer base. I bet it's I bet it's 99

[32:29] percent of pinball buyers on the planet 99 percent are men

[32:34] Uh, at pinball shows the majority of people there are men the women who are there half of them are dragged there by their husbands

[32:43] You know there are very few women very few women out there

[32:48] Who are actually interested in a pinball podcast. I'll tell you this

[32:52] I'm not saying women don't enjoy playing pinball because they do

[32:56] I know a lot of women who are in league nights who love pinball to death

[33:00] Um, here's the thing that I think is great about women. I think women love playing pinball

[33:05] I don't think women want to get involved nor do they care about

[33:09] um, pinball forums

[33:11] Pinball drama pinball podcast. I don't think they want to talk about it that much because I don't think women are as

[33:18] Obsessed about pinball as men are and I'll tell you why they're not because women aren't that

[33:25] stupid

[33:26] only stupid bored men like all of us

[33:30] Dedicate an inordinate amount of time to talking about

[33:35] Writing about reading about pinball. Let's let's be honest guys

[33:40] You are obsessed with pinball on some level that you can't get enough of

[33:46] Playing the machines in your house. You can't get enough of being on pinside talking about it

[33:51] That you also want to hear about it when you're out in the lawn when you're at work when you're driving to work

[33:57] you're obsessed

[33:59] Just admit it like it's and you kind of have a problem and I will be the first to admit

[34:05] I have a problem that I do a pinball podcast for no money three times a week

[34:11] talking about pinball and I should probably seek medical help

[34:17] because of this level of

[34:20] Focus and attention to pinball, but we love it so we don't really care

[34:24] All right, but I'm just saying Chris you're dead wrong if you think you're gonna make a pinball podcast that has appealed the both men and women

[34:29] All right, he then goes on to say

[34:32] um no podcast run by men has ever said we prefer male guests only all right

[34:38] He must be referring to a female podcast. Maybe it's the miss pinball podcast. I don't really know

[34:43] I'm not sure why he's writing so much about that

[34:45] He says in fact many male podcasts show support and cheerlead would women getting into the act

[34:51] You don't need to point out that you're a woman for women by women

[34:55] We can tell by your voice that you're a woman

[34:57] But I'm listening to hear wait, but I'm listening to hear about pinball not to be told sit down shut up because I'm male

[35:04] All right, so he's clearly like singling out a female pinball podcaster here who probably goes on and on about the fact that she's a woman

[35:12] covering pinball

[35:13] But I think that's her stick Chris. Yeah, I think that's what you don't get

[35:17] I think miss pinball fills a void of

[35:20] There's like 20 pinball podcasts out there already filled with a bunch of men rambling on about pinball

[35:27] So she her stick and her angle is that she's a woman and she's a wife of a someone who's obsessed with pinball

[35:35] So she's gonna come at it from that angle

[35:37] I don't actually as a marketer. I think it's smart to do that like this is

[35:42] This is a female's take on the pinball hobby. This is a woman's take on this hobby

[35:46] I don't think she's I bet most of her listeners are men

[35:49] And you know why because no women listen to pinball podcasts. All right, let me go on next number four

[35:53] He says

[35:54] Remember your topic it's pinball if I'm 45 minutes into your podcast and only heard the word pinball twice

[36:02] You're not doing your job right

[36:04] Well, Chris why would you listen for 45 minutes to pinball podcasts that ramble on that don't talk about pinball for 45 minutes

[36:12] See I never understood like why even bother

[36:17] Do I think there are too many pinball podcasts out there?

[36:21] I don't really care you know, can there be too many of anything that that's non

[36:25] Essential anyway

[36:27] I look I do my show the way I do it

[36:29] But I also think I think we check that box. We never go 45 minutes without talking about pinball

[36:34] In fact, our opening every time this show what I love about this show too is I would my I we never do long-winded openings

[36:42] 15 seconds and we're often running all right. He says number five

[36:45] Learn how to edit this is key

[36:49] You can remove all embarrassing comments awkward silences and things like I hope this is recording right all right

[36:56] Well, look, I don't edit the show ever. I don't I never I don't go back. I don't take stuff out

[37:03] I don't

[37:05] Remove awkward silences. In fact, I'll give you an awkward silence right now, mr. Francie

[37:14] Okay, you see you're still here. You still here. We still got a show

[37:18] Um, the thing is is I learned long ago that I could do a lot of work

[37:23] I could go grab movie clips sound clips. I could do all this editing of my shows and I could I could put so many hours in the each show

[37:30] You know, we used to hurt Nate shivers talk all about his show notes and doing all this stuff and all the work

[37:36] And you know at first I was like Nate and I did so much like homework and notes and and preparation for each show

[37:44] And then I just said fuck it. I'm just gonna talk

[37:47] I know what I want to say

[37:49] I can remember what I've read during the week on pinside and other places

[37:54] And I want to just have this be a dialogue and a natural conversation

[37:58] And I think that's why this show is is much better than some edited planned out kind of show

[38:05] It and it's just free-flowing and it feels more like a conversation

[38:09] So I don't agree that you need to edit

[38:11] I think if you have a pinball podcast and you need to edit and you have and you have awkward silences

[38:17] And you're talking about your microphone for five minutes

[38:21] Then you probably should hang it up you probably should hang it up if you just can't hit recording go

[38:26] You don't have the kind of personality to you know to keep a podcast interesting

[38:30] All right

[38:31] Number six don't overstay your welcome if you run out of things to say regarding the topic bail out and sign off

[38:39] Don't milk it with boring filler just to stretch out the running time

[38:43] Well look Chris. I don't know what really mean by that because

[38:46] um

[38:48] You know like I don't I do you I haven't listened to like a pinball podcast where people are like just keep on

[38:54] Droning on about a topic. I mean look

[38:57] We're very repetitive on this show about the things we talk about people people will say to me all the time like

[39:01] Well, here he is talking about Andrew highway again, and he's talking about stern toughness and he's talking about this and world on your class

[39:07] Canator keeps repeating himself, and it's like here's the thing about pinball man, and you're gonna learn this when you actually have a pinball podcast

[39:15] There's not enough new news to not get someone repetitive on topics

[39:20] But as I've learned it doesn't matter if you're if you're repetitive on the kinds of things you cover

[39:27] As long as you inject some new point of view or insight or even just entertainment around the topic

[39:34] But yeah, I think what he's saying here is when you get boring and stale as fuck on a topic move on and I agree with that

[39:42] And I I think we kind of achieve that as well on this show

[39:46] He says number seven don't rip on other podcasters on your show

[39:50] It's unprofessional and makes you look petty and sometimes even a bit envious

[39:56] Yes, really keep it cool do your thing and let others do theirs

[40:00] Well, we've never made fun of other pinball podcasts on this show ever ever ever

[40:12] I

[40:37] Stop it. I sound like I'm going to the toilet

[40:40] Really is the just the epitome of

[40:43] That's pinball and you just have to shrug it off and get your

[40:47] Cryphe for second

[40:49] Okay, so what else is Christopher French? He's say here. He said last but not least if your names are Greg bone and Zachary many

[40:58] Don't call a guy during dinner asking a few questions then after five minutes say it was being recorded for a show

[41:05] I kid you my brothers

[41:08] Seriously do not take offense to this it is only posted to help you have a more successful podcast and entertain the people who listen

[41:16] I try to listen to them all

[41:18] But for the above reason some have fallen off my radar trust me. I'd rather listen

[41:23] All I do is sit in my studio and draw all day

[41:26] All right, he said there aren't enough pinball podcasts to fill my week

[41:31] Dude you're out of your mind franchi. There are way too many pinball podcasts to begin with

[41:35] But look here's the thing

[41:37] It's like what you can't

[41:40] What you can't

[41:41] Give people and this is not me bragging you just can't give people personality you can't give people

[41:49] um

[41:51] What it takes to carry a hour-long pinball show you either have it or you don't and some people have it and are great at it

[42:00] And they know who they are. I think Marty and Ryan

[42:03] I would put them as my favorite pinball podcast out there

[42:08] I think the slam tilt guys are great. I think the bro. Do you even talk pinball guy is good. I think

[42:15] Is that can Greg are awesome? You know, I think Nate is amazing. You know, I

[42:20] You know, then it's like there's just so many out there and they're all they look

[42:24] They all have different listener bases because of the styles of shows. They are like no two pinball podcasts are really the same

[42:32] But I do think they're you know, there are a lot out there and I'm glad that I have my listener base book

[42:38] Some people can't stand me some people absolutely cannot stand me and to those people I say I think you're missing out

[42:46] I do I think we create a very entertaining weekly commentary on pinball

[42:51] That is not found elsewhere. All right. I hope this doesn't mean that Christopher franchi won't come back on the show

[42:58] Do I have to be a guest on his show now? I don't know how it's going to work out. All right

[43:02] So let me go back to my final point today

[43:05] Which was pin sight and the moderator staff and and and the reality and the irony and the hypocrisy that continues to be

[43:15] Pinside now I want to because we're at this stage now

[43:19] Where we're starting to reveal more of the truth of what's gone on and pinball over the last couple years

[43:24] I also want to tell you guys what I know

[43:27] About why I was banned from pin sight and I want to just reveal to you the actual

[43:34] Happenings, okay now I'll say this and I am not a innocent sort of bystander in this whole matter

[43:42] That I have at times

[43:45] Sent Robin in the pin sight staff some IRA emails that were

[43:50] Explited filled that were ridiculous

[43:53] Totally ridiculous and and and uncalled for but I'll say this too

[43:58] I sent those to those people well after I was banned by pin sight

[44:04] And so I was simply annoyed and irritated that I was banned now

[44:09] Let me tell you the main reason I was banned from pin sight and they can they can chalk it up as like I was a trolled in this and that but it's such bullshit

[44:17] I mean the reality is this there was one individual

[44:22] um

[44:23] There was a few individuals that are the reason why I was kicked off for good

[44:27] One of them is a female moderator at pin sight

[44:31] So I heard that the pin sight moderators had a vote on whether or not they should let canate it back on the site

[44:38] This was like maybe six months ago. Maybe a little bit longer than that

[44:42] And there was a lot of support to letting me back on the site

[44:46] But I think it's Blontale is her name

[44:48] But there was a female moderator that refused

[44:52] Under any circumstance which she want me to be back on the site and so she was the main moderator that kept me off the site

[44:58] Another moderator force flow is also a highly highly highly

[45:06] agitated moderator

[45:08] Who does not like me at all and I'm actually going to read you something that force flow wrote

[45:13] In his case against canada which is really funny to actually so you guys can hear

[45:17] The way that that dingleberry like thinks about me all right

[45:22] But here's the thing the the real reason why the real reason why they were just fed up with me is this

[45:28] the moderators were tired of getting

[45:32] Private messages complaining about me on pin sight now there was one user

[45:38] Who complained the most about me who actually wrote because I have it in front of me

[45:45] And I was given this by a pin sight moderator here's the thing that robin doesn't understand

[45:50] I have many I have many moles in the pin sight moderator group

[45:55] I'm not going to name names

[45:57] But I was shown in an email or a private message by no other than Hilton

[46:04] Complaining profusely

[46:07] About them lifting the ban on me right remember when they like banned me for like a couple months

[46:12] They let me back on he went on a crusade a crusade

[46:17] To inundate the moderators with complaints about me being allowed back on the site

[46:23] And the stuff he was saying was just ridiculous and and I even heard recently that

[46:29] Robin and Hilton have been in kahoot's and they basically

[46:33] Robin feels that Hilton is a positive member of the community

[46:37] And he likes having hilton on there because of all the clickbait that Hilton provides the site

[46:43] So like look robin and hilton and the moderators they're all one big kumbaya family

[46:48] And it's kind of funny now I want to read you something. I wasn't going to do this

[46:53] But I'm going to share with you

[46:55] What force flow the moderator on pin sight

[46:59] And the reason why I'm doing this is simple because I saw that robin was interviewed on

[47:05] This week in pinball and when someone and when people went on the pin sight thread to discuss that interview

[47:12] People were like threat ejected like kicked out of the thread for two months

[47:16] Because they were simply discussing the interview this whole notion that you can't say anything about pin sight moderation or else

[47:24] You're like ejected or banned how bullshit is that like what kind of like not see error

[47:32] You know socialistic like crap is that like they literally it's a pinball form robin

[47:39] And you act like it's this precious thing where people can't question the way you moderate

[47:43] But I want to read this because this shows

[47:45] This this just shows how one side it

[47:49] Pin sight is and how there's always been an agenda to keep me off the site that's bullshit

[47:55] And you guys should just know the truth. So here it is. How long I'm going to read this. This is great

[47:59] Okay, so this was from

[48:02] October of 2016 all right, and it's from

[48:07] Force flow he wrote this this is from pin sight moderator force flow

[48:11] And it is titled proposal and this he so he sent this to the pin sight moderation staff now one of the moderators

[48:19] Sent this to me. Okay, so just so you know the backstory

[48:23] It's called the title is the story behind

[48:26] Canada and let me read it for you word for word all right

[48:31] So he writes there's a note before the the full thing he writes proposed form announcement very rough draft needs lots of editing

[48:40] Feel free to edit and offer suggestions try to stick to facts and avoid opinions slander all right, so he writes

[48:49] Many moons ago a user named canada was an active user on the forums as time went on he eventually posted more and more

[48:58] controversial and inflammatory things which seemed intended to cause fireworks and arguments

[49:05] Eventually his podcast came out it came about which started reasonably well and featured some good interview segments

[49:14] However

[49:16] Eventually he started targeting individual users on pin side which was not acceptable

[49:23] For all that and more he was ultimately banned even after a few second chances to redeem himself

[49:31] After he was banned there was still underground support from various users who attempted to promote his podcast and

[49:39] Acted as a mouthpiece for him when he wanted to post something on the forums

[49:45] Additionally on occasion he would create duplicate accounts to get around the band and trolling the forums

[49:53] These accounts were also subsequently banned

[49:57] Finally more recently certain members have been giving access to their pin side to canada first

[50:04] Well, I just want to stop right there. That is a fucking lie

[50:07] Like I I didn't want to stop midway through this nobody ever gave me access to their pin side account

[50:13] Anyway, let me go on

[50:14] accounts are only intended to be used by a single user and since it is against the rules for multiple people to use a single account

[50:23] Those accounts were also frozen

[50:26] Canada is a public relations professional by trade as such

[50:31] He uses these skills to spin and promote all sorts of rumors

[50:36] Here say and a mixed bag of information without proper fact checking

[50:41] All right, so I just want to stop there again force flow do me a favor

[50:45] Take a step back and go fuck your face you idiot the information

[50:49] I was sharing that you are saying

[50:52] Well, it was mixed bag of information without proper fact checking everything I was sharing was about highway pinball

[50:59] You debag and you have the gall to tell me that everything I was trying to share was inaccurate

[51:05] And what was it also inaccurate when I took that photo of the jersey jack hobbit machine with a broken ramp

[51:11] And that's what led to me being banned that was the post that they had enough that I was sharing a fact that a game was broken on location

[51:17] Okay, I'm gonna keep going though

[51:19] He goes on to say

[51:21] All this can be damaging to the pinball hobby as a whole as well as manufacturers

[51:27] He obviously is not a positive ambassador for pinball. All right, I want to stop there

[51:33] I want to stop there for a minute because there's more that I'm gonna read you

[51:36] So let's think about what force flow just said to you

[51:39] He banned me from pinside is accusing me of not being an ambassador for pinball

[51:45] He's accusing me of sharing information that would be damaging to manufacturers

[51:51] This was in October of 2016 when I was sharing with force flow and robin and other moderators

[51:59] Information about highway pinball that they refused to allow onto the site

[52:05] So I set up duplicate accounts to share that information and they removed that information and banned those accounts

[52:13] They knew those those accounts were mine. They knew all I was trying to do was to get you guys

[52:19] The information and the facts you needed not to get burned by highway pinball

[52:24] And here he is accusing me of not being a positive ambassador for pinball

[52:29] And I'm doing this because I want you guys to see the true colors of

[52:33] Pinside the true colors of the moderators that all they care about is trying to have idiots like like Kevin Kulik

[52:42] And people like Andrew highway contribute to their site that they would rather allow those

[52:49] frauds

[52:50] In audience and a megaphone then let someone like me who's actually trying to look out for your well-being

[52:56] Okay, let me continue what he says here because this is just amazing and I love that it's this is it like I have this

[53:02] It's from force flow. It's it's right here. This is 100% the pinside moderators agenda against me

[53:11] All right, he then goes on to say

[53:13] most of these incidents have been handled fairly quickly and quietly by the moderator's staff

[53:18] However, it can sometimes take a little time to establish enough certainty and proof

[53:25] We like to have some proof before acting as a matter of fairness to any new users who join

[53:32] Unfortunately, this has led to various members greeting new users with the phrase hi canada

[53:38] This is unwelcoming and confusing for new members

[53:42] We ask that you simply stick to using the post reporting feature if you suspect a duplicate account

[53:49] There are still a small number of you who will support canada a small number. I love that. Hey force flow

[53:56] Hey dingleberry a small number of people that will support me sure

[54:00] I bet you and robin thought that this podcast would just dissipate that I would have no listeners

[54:07] You know hilton still he still admits to not even having a smartphone. I bet hilton

[54:12] listens to every show we do he curls up with a bag of marshmallows

[54:18] He looks at his checking account. He looks at the window sees the piece of shit Subaru

[54:22] And he listens to every episode and he says honey honey he's making fun of me again

[54:27] He's making fun of me again, you know the hilton hoodie. I'm gonna I'm gonna mass produce those things

[54:32] Anyway, I love the fact see do you see the agenda there?

[54:34] Do you see the agenda and the one-sided bias of of the moderator team that

[54:40] He might still have a small number of supporters. All right. I'm gonna finish out what he says here

[54:44] There are still a small number of you who will still support canada

[54:48] But have really only seen one side of him

[54:51] Here is some of the correspondence that we have received from him

[54:55] This should help illustrate the kind of individuals some people have chosen to support as an ambassador to the hobby

[55:02] And then he's gonna insert the emails I sent to robin

[55:05] Any support for canada or his podcast will not be tolerated

[55:09] This is not the kind of person we want on pin-side nor the kind of person

[55:13] We want as the public face of our hobby

[55:16] Comments for this thread will be open for a limited period of time. You know what I want to do

[55:21] I want to read you. I want to read you what I sent robin. Let me see if I can pull this up

[55:25] All right, so this was around the same time period as force flows great

[55:30] pros that he wrote so I wrote to robin and said hey robin

[55:34] Not happy at all. I have a podcast ready to go that you won't be happy about in it

[55:39] I call out your moderation team and you for being a bunch of p uss wise

[55:45] You let people attack me non-stop when I punch back you spring into action and ban me over and over again

[55:52] I'm gonna give you a few hours to think about your actions. I've played this game on your terms long enough

[55:58] Trust me when I say you don't want this podcast to go up

[56:01] It's the kind of brutal truth about pin-side that is best left unsaid the kind of truth you are able to control on the site

[56:09] With threadagex and moderation

[56:11] Here's the part that kills me we were friends man you and I met personally hung out, but this is it guys saying

[56:18] Um, they f my mother and you just stood by and said nothing stood by and didn't moderate any of it

[56:23] My f and mother man now you want to close it down. That's fine

[56:27] I really don't care, but it's your best interest not to you really don't want this podcast to go live

[56:32] I'm giving you one shot to rethink this because we used to be friends

[56:36] I'm going to bed now when I wake up if I hear nothing it's going live and trust me you know I can put

[56:42] Thoughts out there that will stick in people's minds forever

[56:45] I never give people a chance to change my mind, but I'm doing that you that solid in eight hours this goes live

[56:52] all right

[56:53] I was accused by a moderator of blackmail and threats all bullshit until now you want to say those things about me now

[56:59] See what it's really like to be blackmailed by a man with a mic and a thousand listeners all right

[57:04] So that's why I wrote to him

[57:06] Because I just I really I could not for the life of me understand

[57:10] um how they would allow people to attack me so much and did nothing and yet

[57:15] um, if you because if you go back and look at the history

[57:19] You know, I never really um

[57:21] I never really personally attacked people. I really didn't

[57:25] And if you think like me making fun of the alien art package and this and that was a personal attack so be it

[57:30] I think I also sent Rob in a couple drunk emails

[57:33] That was like hey, how would you like to be after robin like slow or fast because that's a thing

[57:38] It's like you have to understand you have to understand when they were not allowing me to share with you the information

[57:45] I wanted to share and and I would read people like personally

[57:50] Like make fun of me make fun of my mother make fun of my career calling me a

[57:55] Associate path calling me all sorts of names and they allowed all that to stay up there

[58:00] That is why that is why I have no respect for robin in the pin-side moderation step and you read first hand

[58:08] From force flow um the one-sided bias that exists on that site now. Here's a thing. Here's a thing

[58:14] Now you guys know now you know like more of the truth and the reality of the one-sided

[58:19] bias nature of pin-side and I'm just gonna end this podcast by saying this

[58:23] They are 100% they are 100% to blame

[58:28] For what happened with highway pinball and allowing Andrew highway to sucker more people because think about it

[58:35] Where was Andrew highway able to sucker more buyers into his plan? It was with pin-side, right?

[58:42] They let Hilton and Andrew go into kahoot's and

[58:46] Shill the game and try to convince people that aliens were actually shipping a production was was right around the corner

[58:53] And they let all that take place now

[58:56] I love how robin and force flow are like he's not a positive member of the community

[59:01] And he presented information without facts. You know what?

[59:04] I've got one fact for you two dingle berries to remember all right one fact force flow one fact robin

[59:11] That you guys need to sit down and remember here's the fact

[59:15] I was trying to give you guys

[59:17] 2,572,648

[59:22] Dollars of people's money that Andrew highway lost all right that Hilton helped people lose in the hobby

[59:31] So you know what you guys should take a long look in the mirror and stop colluding with Hilton and I literally guys

[59:39] Robin has basically said to Hilton you're okay

[59:42] You're not going to be banned. I think you're one of our best members on the site like literally that is what is happening

[59:47] And it is unbelievable

[59:49] I think everyone should call

[59:51] Robin out on this BS and the the sign that

[59:56] He is listening and understands the gravity of this one-sided bullshit

[01:00:02] Is he should kick that motherfucker off the site once and for all and at least let Hilton and canada share a lifetime ban because you know what

[01:00:11] Let's hold hands and jump off a cliff like someone will leave Hilton

[01:00:15] You know it's time have a good day everyone

[01:00:26] Right
