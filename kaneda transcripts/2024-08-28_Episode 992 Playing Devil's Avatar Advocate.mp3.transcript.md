[00:00] I want everybody to close your eyes.

[00:08] Join me in Pandora.

[00:13] Remember the magic of the Hallelujah Mountains, soaring through the sky on your whatever the

[00:25] creature is called, battling the Marines who are trying to get their hands on the precious

[00:33] unobtainium, what an original name of a mineral.

[00:40] But no, everybody look, I've woken up and I've said all the reasons why I don't think

[00:47] Avatar is a good theme for pinball and I woke up this morning and I just wanted to play

[00:54] Devil's Advocate, Devil's Avatar Advocate for this game.

[01:00] Cause I was thinking about it and I'm like alright look, it isn't a theme any of us want,

[01:04] when I've done a poll, 90% of people said they did not want Avatar and I'm here to tell you

[01:10] right now, there's only one way this pin is gonna work, there's only one way it's gonna

[01:15] make all of us eat Pandora Crow, there's only one way it's gonna make money, there's only

[01:22] one way it's gonna wow us and that is if this pinball machine delivers the same kind

[01:31] of never seen before spectacle that the movie delivered when we first saw it.

[01:39] And that means this pinball machine has to do stuff that's never been done before, it

[01:44] means it has to look and come at us like a pinball machine has never done before, it

[01:50] has to play like a pinball machine has never played before and I was thinking about it and

[01:55] I'm like well you know all we're seeing is the flipper gap area, yes and I've seen the

[02:00] jokes about what it looks like between the flippers but here's the thing, if we travel

[02:06] up that play field and there is a massive tree of life with bioluminescent leaves hanging

[02:13] down and there are floating mountains of Pandora that act as upper play fields that

[02:20] the ball somehow like magically gets to and I mean it like imagine if there's mechs in

[02:26] this game where the ball is flying and soaring through the air the same way the characters

[02:33] do in the movie right when they're jumping on those vines and going from the mountain

[02:38] tops they're gonna have to find a way to bring all of that magic right if you've ever been

[02:44] to the Disney World experience of Pandora there is something right even though the theme

[02:51] isn't as memorable as Star Wars even though the characters aren't even though it doesn't

[02:57] have like the lines other than I see you it just doesn't have the same pole there is something

[03:04] that it did have like there's a reason why these movies have made billions at the box

[03:10] office and so to me that is the thing we all know that when this thing lights up and we

[03:17] see it with its like black lit UV lit spectacular lighting I mean this is going to be probably

[03:25] the most insane pinball machine you ever turn on and light up when you put it in a dark game

[03:33] room if you think G&R light show is good if you think Elton John was good I think Avatar is gonna

[03:39] glow and come to life like no other pinball machine in a lineup and all of a sudden I'm thinking

[03:46] about this stuff and I'm starting to get somewhat excited right I mean Avatar it's not like it's

[03:54] something we don't know about it's much better than some of the other pinball themes that have

[03:59] been out there the stern game was absolutely atrocious and looks terrible does not bring that

[04:06] avatar world to life in any way shape or form and hey you know are they gonna do anything with 3D

[04:14] as well I mean it kind of sucks that Jaws came out with 3D before Avatar and did it so well and so

[04:20] fun because now it won't be the first ever pinball machine to come with 3D glasses but I'm actually

[04:28] starting to feel like we're all gonna have to just be patient now here's the thing the game is out

[04:36] now like we know this is the next JJP game they might as well just hit now because think about it

[04:43] stern's about to launch X-Men and show us everything and now we've seen like 10% of the

[04:49] avatar play field you might as well just show us the whole damn thing JJP and drop it the same exact

[04:57] moment that X-Men comic book comes out now look here's what I'm hoping I'm hoping there's an all new

[05:03] artist in the game I think there's an opportunity here for stunning art stunning lights stunning

[05:10] mechanisms yes I said it stunning mechanisms avatar is a world of three dimensions you could think

[05:18] about if it's the first two movies you might have the big tree of life you can have those floating

[05:24] upper play field mountains you can have a lower play field where you go under the water like that

[05:30] could be really cool and that imagine just imagine that really lighting up in a unique way and all

[05:36] the creatures I don't know the more I think about it as it could translate into pinball the more I

[05:43] can see the potential in the game now here is the thing though it is a very high hill to climb

[05:52] this isn't the sort of take my money now theme that I think everybody want it right now and I

[05:58] think the other thing that's unfortunate for Jersey Jack and all these pinball companies and hey

[06:03] it's not really unfortunate because they all did it to themselves Jersey Jack did it with three

[06:08] lukewarm themes in a row Stern's been doing it with overpriced games and themes we don't really

[06:13] want and the rest of the industry let's face it hasn't really delivered what grown men 40 to 61

[06:20] it's not labyrinth it's not loony tunes it's not Texas chainsaw the entire industry has turned

[06:26] its back on what we really want and all these companies have been making games for themselves

[06:31] and that is why so many of us are just like I don't really care these are not the themes that we

[06:36] really really want so I think what's unfortunate now is we're coming out of this period where so

[06:42] many games have been so underwhelming where we're looking at everything a lot more cynically

[06:49] and now that the entry level to get into a jersey jack game is $12,000 it's going to be difficult you

[06:57] know like this isn't like something that's going to be 7000 that like people will just like throw

[07:02] money at and throw in their game room so for 12 to 15 thousand dollars this thing absolutely needs

[07:09] to bring some never seen before magic to pinball it needs to integrate the movies into the machine

[07:16] as well so like we're going to need to see amazing 4k clips of avatar on that screen we need to see

[07:23] the characters synced up with their voices so gory weaver right here's another opportunity

[07:29] where they have to have so gory weaver in the pinball machine itself so look here's the thing

[07:33] we're all grown adults and nobody should be offended by this none of us need to own another

[07:39] pinball machine and I just want to encourage each and every one of us to sort of keep somewhat of

[07:44] an open mind as we go into this game I woke up it's a beautiful sunny day I'm looking at my

[07:50] beautiful family I live in a beautiful part of the world there's so many people out there in the

[07:55] world was so much less there's so many people out there in the world waking up in war torn parts of

[08:02] the world there are hostages there are fatalities there's so many people struggling with health

[08:07] issues and you know we shouldn't lose it because we get a pinball theme that is not to our liking

[08:15] now if history has shown me anything in pinball we all me included me especially not just included me

[08:22] especially we all have a tendency to lose it before we see enough to make an opinion about a game

[08:30] so I think this thing is going to be stranger things on crack with much better mechanisms

[08:37] than stranger things and again I keep thinking about this jersey jack platform is so beautiful to

[08:43] begin with and this just might be the most beautiful and the most arresting pinball machine ever when

[08:50] I mean by that it's going to glow in a way that's just going to attract everybody to it right and

[08:57] it's going to have a storyline and that's the other thing that's sort of getting me excited

[09:02] because if I think about it right now the two jersey jack machines that pull you in and attract you

[09:08] to the game elton john and guns and roses yes I love both of those machines but there's no storyline

[09:15] they're kind of repetitive to play and you're not really progressing through a narrative

[09:19] at least with avatar there is a storyline albeit it's just a rip off of pocahontas but there's

[09:26] going to be stuff to do and you're going to be going through scenes of the movies and you're

[09:31] going to feel like you're progressing and I think that's going to be a really important part of this

[09:36] game but again it's got to have everything it's got to wow us it's got to have everything and this is

[09:41] mark siden's first game and so like look I'm curious to see how it drops and I think it's good that

[09:46] we got all of the anger out I've said this every time you've got a theme like elton john or avatar

[09:53] you know you got to get it out early rip the band-aid off let everybody scream about how much

[09:59] they don't want it and then by the time the game is revealed you're going to have everyone's expectations

[10:06] really low and that's actually a good place to be with pinball because then the only place you can

[10:12] go is up and exceed people's expectations and they will approach it with a little bit more of an

[10:19] open mind because everyone's gonna be like well I'm not buying it but let me just check it out let me

[10:23] see what you got here huh that's somewhat interesting and I think what's gonna happen is this and I mean

[10:29] this as much as we don't love the theme trust me when I say this when you put JJP's avatar next to

[10:38] all the stuff from stern for 13,000 and 10,000 next to everyone else's games now as I think about it

[10:45] it's gonna be a competition for Alice in Wonderland if I'm melvin I might want to think about getting

[10:50] that game out and showing people it before avatar is shown because these are going to be two sexy

[10:56] games competing for our dollars when you put this jersey jack avatar next to everything else in the

[11:02] pinball market I do think it's going to embarrass everything else that's out there and they've got

[11:07] the resources and again like I just think this game is gonna glow and come to life like no other

[11:13] pinball machine ever and walking up to it is gonna create a moment like never before the same way

[11:20] the movies did and that's me just playing devil's advocate I'm excited to see more I'm excited to

[11:26] cover new pinball and hey it's kind of interesting right all of a sudden now jersey jacks got everyone

[11:33] talking not stern stern's month of marvel what happened to it and now we're most likely gonna

[11:39] get x-men probably on Friday or I don't know maybe today or tomorrow but whatever it is now this

[11:45] gets really interesting because stern was not expecting jersey jacks next theme to be announced

[11:52] the same week of its x-men and not just the theme people I mean is we've got an image like that rarely

[12:01] happens and when we have one image we know there's more where that came from so whoever leaked that

[12:06] image to Jason nap if you know who it is I would happily take all of your other images and heck

[12:13] maybe jersey jack leaked it I'm serious when I say this maybe jersey jack leaked that image just to

[12:20] stay on the radar as stern's about to gobble up so much money and so much game room space in our

[12:28] homes which we all know is very limited everybody I love this hobby I love talking about this stuff

[12:34] and no Robert who's listening right now over in Europe it is not a fake image this is not AI

[12:40] generated we're not all being played for fools it's not really going to be margaritaville or

[12:45] matrix so everybody look this is going to be a crazy few weeks in pinball a crazy month as we

[12:52] head to expo so I look forward to covering all of it but yeah as grown adults let's try to keep a

[12:59] little bit of an open mind until we see everything it's not the theme I would have chosen but as I

[13:06] woke up this morning I do see the potential so let's see what we get thank you so much for

[13:13] being a member of canada's pinball podcast close your eyes everybody I see you I see you crazy levy
