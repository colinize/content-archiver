[00:00] So I said this song for the event and I said what I meant and I never put in it

[00:05] And so many others do it and then they got to please if I can report it view good you turn the other

[00:15] Welcome everybody to canad is bimbal podcast. It is day two with the godfather bimbal in the world

[00:22] I'm your host canada. I'm pulling the arrows out of my back once again

[00:27] I want to talk about what it's like you know now that we've absorbed what the game is now that the weight is over

[00:33] Now that we see the design direction we see the artwork we see the top or we see all of the ball paths my gosh

[00:42] You would think that a world under glass by many of you is defined by how many ball paths are in a game

[00:48] I'm gonna talk about that and I just want to say this for everybody right now like I'm glad the game is out

[00:54] We knew it was godfather for like a year and a half and now the game is available and I want to talk about my feelings as I woke up today

[01:02] About the game because I've been reading pin side. I've been hearing people say this is an instant classic

[01:08] I've been hearing distributors say the game is sold out by now and then I go to Jersey Jack's website and it's still available

[01:14] I think they're shooting themselves in the foot between the collectors edition and the LE and I want to talk about that

[01:20] Let me just start out right now by saying this right now. I have no problem being the bad guy right now

[01:26] And here's what I want to say if you think that this game is loaded and packed do me a favor

[01:34] Turn off this podcast right now because I want you to live in your own selective world

[01:39] I want you to live in your delusional world in which this game is packed and loaded

[01:45] Okay, so do me a favor. I'm gonna give you a few minutes turn it off enjoy the game by the game enjoy your

[01:51] 29 ball paths enjoy your game with hardly any major mechs in it

[01:56] Enjoy your

[01:58] Diverters, okay, this is the new mechanism in pinball if you put diverters into a game

[02:03] You have created a world on their glass. Okay, so let's give those guys a few minutes to sort of exit

[02:09] We're gonna give them 10 seconds and then I'll tell you how I really feel about the game again. All right

[02:14] Here we go 109876. Okay, you ready? Here's a deal put this game next to pirates of the Caribbean

[02:20] Put this game next to Wizard of Oz put this game next to the Hobbit are we allowed to do that

[02:26] We live in a pinball world now where these games are $15,000 for a Jersey Jack Collective's edition

[02:33] $13,000 for a Stern Ellie moving forward every single game is the same price

[02:39] Regardless of what's in it regardless of what the theme is regardless of anything and so do you want to live in a world

[02:47] In which regardless of all those things we are paying the most money pinball has ever been okay

[02:52] So just like looking at Godfather and I asked people what's the major mechanism in the game?

[02:56] Okay, so there's like a spinning disc up the middle with this sort of like mobster figure looking at us and by the way

[03:03] Have you noticed that the sculpts in this game look exactly like the scopes from the medieval madness topper now Christopher

[03:10] Franchi did that topper so I'm thinking maybe the same people made the sculpts in this game and the more I look at these

[03:16] Scopes and I'm just gonna say it and don't kill canada don't kill the messenger

[03:19] It looks like the design direction for this game was not Godfather the movie it was mouse and around go Google image

[03:27] Mouse and around the pinball machine and look at the gangster the wise guy you know the big wise guy

[03:32] Butting on the cigar and that's what the sculpts in Godfather look like and it's very jarring and it doesn't fit the theme

[03:39] And it doesn't really work and as someone said to me it looks like shampoo bottle tops that kids have in the bathroom

[03:46] And I'm sorry, but this is not the dark world of Godfather and they look they brightened it up

[03:50] They made it more campy. They made it more comical. I get it. They did it. That's the way it looks now

[03:55] Is it Godfather does it scream Godfather? I don't know I don't know that's up for you to decide but okay

[04:00] So let's just get back to the game itself. So someone said to me Chris you've been begging for a world under glass for all of these years

[04:07] And how are you not praising this game on launch day? Well look here's the deal what I see in this game isn't really a world

[04:15] Perse I see a mobster themed game. I see a lot of shots

[04:20] I see a lot of pathways. I see a lot of like scopes of like cartoonish-looking mobsters

[04:27] But I don't really see a world under glass and I definitely don't see an interactive world under glass now

[04:34] Look, I know you've got the New York City skyline. You've got the statue of Liberty

[04:39] You've got the horse head fountain pop bumper put exactly where Keith L. When put his pop bumper in Godzilla

[04:45] You got it all right you got it all but I don't feel when I look at this game like there is a 3d world

[04:53] Under glass coming up off the wood of the game the way I feel when I look at Eric Minier's Pirates of the Caribbean

[05:01] The way I feel when I look at Eric Minier's Guns and Roses

[05:05] So out of Eric Minier's three games and I look at this game next to those two

[05:10] This game looks much more empty than his first two efforts

[05:15] Maybe Guns and Roses and Pirates of the Caribbean don't have as many diverters

[05:19] But what they do have is more of a three-dimensional world under glass coming at me and both of those games were much cheaper

[05:28] Than this game and so here we are now in pinball

[05:33] I'm not allowed to evaluate the only game you would buy is the 15,000 dollar collective's addition

[05:38] There is no reason to buy the Ellie in this game. Let's talk about that real quick

[05:42] Jersey jacks marketing and business model now is absolutely weird because look at these two games

[05:48] Why would you ever buy an Ellie of this game?

[05:52] Everything you're really going to want right the real package is in the collector's edition

[05:56] It's got the top or it's got the armor. It's got the shin guards going on

[06:00] It's got everything you really want in the game in the inner art plates. It's got everything you want right and if you have

[06:05] $12,000 to buy a non-essential pinball machine you definitely have 15,000 dollars

[06:11] You know, it's like when you get the top of the line Mercedes are you really gonna not get the heated headrest like you're gonna get them

[06:18] And that's what pinball is like if you have 12 you have 15 and the only way to save any value in these games is to go with the

[06:26] Collector's Edition and by Jersey jacks saying to everybody we are gonna make five

[06:31] Thousand limited edition games what that is signaling to everybody is there is no reason to buy one right now

[06:38] We're gonna make way more than the market even wants and if you buy one your game is gonna tank and value overnight

[06:45] And I didn't say it they did there's a reason why Stern does not put a cap on its premiums

[06:51] They don't tell you how many premiums they're gonna make and there's a little bit of ignorance is bliss right?

[06:57] Everyone's always guessing how many premiums of Godzilla are there or Elvira and Stern is smart

[07:03] Because if Stern said we're gonna make a thousand LEs and five thousand premiums of food fighters

[07:10] All of a sudden you don't really want one it feels like there's instantly too many out in the world

[07:15] And let's be honest ladies and gentlemen hardly any pinball machine is selling

[07:20] Six thousand units at these prices almost no game would ever sell

[07:25] Six thousand units at these prices so you're instantly just destroying any notion that this thing is limited

[07:34] That it is exclusive that it is rare and that it is desirable

[07:38] So it's a weird like one of them creates FOMO

[07:41] But that FOMO on the CE destroys the FOMO on the Ellie

[07:45] So I think you're gonna see Ellie's of this game tank and price right away

[07:50] And the CE is the only package really to get now will they sell all one thousand CE's of Godfather at

[07:58] $15,000 a pop this is the other thing I love about this community because this community look we love Pimble

[08:03] Whenever a new pinball machine comes out we're excited

[08:05] And I love seeing people excited about this game

[08:08] I love people making hyperbolic claims about a game they've never played

[08:12] I love people getting super excited on a level look

[08:15] I should not be saying this game is in great and I have not said how this game is right

[08:19] I'm just making observations about what's in it right

[08:23] I am simply addressing what I see is in the game. I haven't played it

[08:27] I am not here to tell you the game isn't any good

[08:30] I am not here to tell you the game isn't any fun

[08:33] I am not here to tell you any of that because I have not played it and guess what neither have you

[08:38] And nobody who's ordered this game has played it the only materials everyone is going off of are two bits of material

[08:47] Designed by people who want to sell you the game. That's all they want to do straight down the middle when they sell a game

[08:54] They're gonna make two to three thousand dollars for every CE they sell you ladies and gentlemen

[08:58] So of course they want to sell the game in the highest possible light

[09:01] Same thing with Jersey check and they're doing their jobs

[09:04] That's what a marketer is supposed to do that's what a salesperson is supposed to do

[09:07] But I'm here to tell you right now. I don't think anything we saw yesterday was enough yet

[09:13] To cut a check for 15 grand. I don't think anything we saw yesterday was enough to put a deposit down

[09:20] Which is still non-refundable and I've been telling everybody for the last year and a half

[09:26] Why are we as a community supporting this practice? You're gonna take two bits of content

[09:33] Designed to create FOMO and then go in non-refundable

[09:38] Especially after we saw what happened with toy story

[09:41] Especially after we saw that they made so many guns and roses at least to the point where nobody even wants one anymore

[09:48] So I wouldn't you just wait do you need it right now and the other funny part is this so many of you are so

[09:56] Hippocritical you hated on the godfather theme and because your expectations are so damn low

[10:02] You're looking at this game and nothing could ever disappoint you

[10:06] You know what I'm saying the only way you can be disappointed is if you actually cared about the theme

[10:12] It's why we're also disappointed about toy story because we love toy story

[10:18] And we see what's missing from the game and because nobody really want it godfather

[10:24] There's nothing missing in Eric's design because there's nothing you even want it in the design of the game

[10:31] And so look it's probably a good move that they put out a game with zero expectations

[10:36] So it's absolutely elevated everyone's reception of the game

[10:40] But when I hear people saying that this is an instant classic and you haven't even seen yet

[10:45] What the freaking game is like you have not seen someone flip a ball for like five minutes

[10:51] To see what the music is like how fast are the shots?

[10:55] How are they integrating the movie with the game itself?

[10:58] Like don't forget people

[11:00] This is not a pinball machine that is gonna take you through the godfather movie the way you've experienced the godfather movie

[11:07] This is like game of thrones meets cactus Canyon. It's like choose your mafia house. Okay, so right there

[11:14] That's not what the godfather movie is about and I get it

[11:17] They're going on a different pathway and in the video itself

[11:20] They said they had to like rethink the godfather storyline to fit in pinball format

[11:26] And that's fine. I really don't have a problem with that

[11:29] But I need to see how that's gonna work

[11:32] I need to see how the clips are gonna integrate into the game

[11:35] I need to see what that's gonna be like in a pinball experience

[11:39] And none of you clowns who are saying this is the greatest game ever or jjps best game ever have even played it

[11:45] And I'm just gonna say it right now and look if you have kids in the car

[11:48] Close their ears because I'm going to create a new phrase in pinball right now

[11:54] And it is going to use a word that's not that bad. It's the b-word b-i-t-c-h-e-s and kids

[12:00] I try to keep this show clean

[12:02] But I've got to say this phrase they have launched this game and reading pinside

[12:07] I've never seen more pinball people in my life turn into ball path bitches

[12:14] And I mean it. I've never seen so many ball path bitches you guys are so weird

[12:19] It's like you act like creating 29 ball paths is all of a sudden a world under glass that's so packed

[12:26] Oh my gosh, how did they do this? Oh, and when you play the game you're never gonna know where the ball is coming from

[12:31] Are you freaking kidding me? I'm looking at this game. I'm looking at the diverters like none of these

[12:36] Diverters are operating the way the diverter works in the toad and ramp that's got the whirlpool

[12:41] And then you've got the genie that fires the fireball at you where the mechanisms people

[12:45] Where are the mechanisms that are gonna say wow like oh

[12:48] 29 ball paths twenty-na I kept hearing it over and over and over again

[12:52] And then I thought to myself this is it now we're evaluating a world under glass based on ball paths

[12:58] And the analogy I'm gonna use right now is imagine going into an amusement park right?

[13:02] I think a pinball machine is kind of like a world under glass amusement park right in which each interesting mechanism is like a different ride in the amusement park

[13:10] And imagine going to an amusement park in which there's not many rides at all

[13:14] But you're all excited because there's a lot of pathways

[13:17] There's a lot of walkways to go around the amusement park, but what the freak are you walking to?

[13:21] Like I see the ball can go yeah, I can go left right left right left right, but what's it going to?

[13:26] What's the things that's interacting with all right? I get it every made a game with flow

[13:30] So I can't wait to see how well it flows. We know Jersey jack games don't flow the best so hopefully this is their best flowing game

[13:36] But people are also saying like it's got way more in it than toy story and I'm like, I don't know guys

[13:41] I don't know if that's true like does it does it really like I saw the video and look

[13:46] I'm not defending toy story

[13:48] But even though there's a lot of diverters and ball pass

[13:51] I'm just gonna say right now

[13:52] What's more fun in life walking down a bunch of different pathways?

[13:56] We're going over a jump and at least toy stories got a jump and when I saw all the gameplay from freaking godfather

[14:03] I didn't see the ball do anything like that or jump or disappear or do anything even like crazy

[14:08] Didn't load into a locking mechanism that was crazy nothing nothing what have we become people go watch the stream of fires

[14:16] Or the Caribbean go see what the ball does in that game go see the upper play field go see the cannon shot

[14:22] Go see the world pool go see all of that stuff happening in that game and then go watch this

[14:27] And this is what pinballs become is the distributors have won the manufacturers have won

[14:33] It's not cranky canada

[14:34] They want you to buy these games at these prices they want you to turn off your history

[14:39] They want you to forget what used to be in pinball

[14:41] They want you to forget what this designer used to make in pinball machines

[14:44] You think the bomb in this game is even close to what it was in pirates of the Caribbean people

[14:49] You're absolutely out of your minds. How much do you think a diverter costs?

[14:53] How much do you think knockers cost? I mean I keep saying oh they put two knockers up in the top room people are losing their minds people

[14:59] A knocker a physical knocker is probably a five dollar part maybe ten dollars at most

[15:08] And this is fifteen thousand dollars and we are now celebrating that there's a knocker in a pinball machine everybody

[15:17] I love this hobby. I love you guys. I love how animated everybody gets. I love it

[15:23] This is great. We have more options than we have ever before and the real story of pinball right now

[15:29] Is simply this the greatest thing to happen in pinball. It's not Christopher Francis return to art on a game

[15:36] It's not Eric Minier's Jersey Jack number eight. It's not any of that the greatest news that's happening in pinball right now is simply this

[15:45] The entire hobby is now a buyer's market and we should be celebrating that a buyer's market is now here

[15:54] You now have all of the control these games are not selling out in day one

[15:59] When people buy these games they're going to have to sell their older games to make room for all these new games

[16:05] And when that happens you're going to start to get deals again

[16:08] I love the fact that we have these options

[16:11] I love the fact that all these pinball companies are releasing all these products all at the same time

[16:16] It is going to make it even more so of a buyer's market the prices are too high

[16:22] Everybody knows that if you don't run to these high prices right away trust me

[16:27] You're going to be able if you really want a godfather in just a few months

[16:31] Ellie's will go for 10

[16:33] CE's will go for 11 5 12 it's gonna happen the same thing will happen with food fighter

[16:39] It's a buyer's market and it's great and every single pinball machine that comes off the lot is going to depreciate in value

[16:46] The distributors are going to get richer than ever before it's going to happen because they have so many more cars to sell

[16:51] And that's fine. I don't begrudge them. That's what they do the manufacturers some of them are going to fail

[16:56] There's just too much out there. I don't see games like queen succeeding

[17:01] I don't see games like galactic tank for succeeding now

[17:04] I don't see these like games on the fringes of pinball like scottanese's game

[17:08] You're not going to be able to do it because the other thing is this the reason why it's a buyer's market is people are just going to be out of money

[17:13] Like how much money is in this hobby where you can have six games all 10 to 15 thousand dollars

[17:19] There's no way there's going to be buyers for all of these games

[17:22] And so that's really good news and I know that I get strident

[17:26] I know that I get very like wound up about this stuff

[17:30] But I'm not offended by godfather. I think it's a little bit of a weird game. I get it

[17:35] I think they did the best with what they had. I don't think it's a good theme for pinball

[17:40] I still don't think it's a good theme for pinball

[17:43] And I still think those sculpts are just so weird and awkwardly jarring

[17:47] They just take me out of the godfather world when you look at the sculpts and pirates of the Caribbean

[17:53] They don't take you out of the world when you look at the guns and roses sculpts

[17:57] They don't take you out of the G&R world

[17:59] And when I look at those sculpts, it's just not godfather. It is just not godfather

[18:04] And look I'm happy for you guys you get it

[18:06] So don't be mad at me. Don't punch me at Texas pinball festival

[18:10] And that's that everybody. It's just pinball remember that it is just pinball

[18:15] I am not here to ruin your fun of the hobby. I'm not trying to be overly toxic

[18:20] I'm just trying to encourage everybody at these prices

[18:23] Stop saying stupid stuff. It doesn't cost a lot of money to make ball paths

[18:29] Okay, it doesn't what cost money is actually engineering complex mechanisms

[18:36] What cost money is actually engineering upper play fields lower play fields making it all work

[18:41] You know, that's what cost money and pinball and the ultimate thing is this look almost every single pinball machine is fun

[18:48] Almost every single person who's in this community is a cool person

[18:52] And almost every single pinball company has the talent required to make a decent game now not everybody

[18:58] But almost all of them okay and look that's where I'm at with this game

[19:02] I can't wait to see the stream of it

[19:03] I can't wait to see how it all comes together because people you're forgetting

[19:08] Are you forgetting that sometimes Jersey Jack can be overly complex sometimes they can have like slot machine music

[19:14] So I just want to see how it all comes together. I think it's way too early to slam the door on the game

[19:20] It's also way too early to praise it as an instant classic and I think that's a fair assessment of this machine

[19:27] What else do I want to say this week?

[19:29] So stern pinball has sent people the $20,000 James Bond 60th the most expensive pinball machine of all time

[19:37] Was supposed to come with amazing powder code at armor. It's not. It's just the matte black

[19:42] Every game was supposed to come with a shaker motor installed and the first owners that unboxed their James Bond 60th

[19:50] They found out that they did not have a shaker motor installed in the game

[19:55] The holes were drilled for the shaker motor

[19:57] But no shaker motor to be found in a James Bond game where when he orders his martini

[20:03] It is shaken not stirred and this is why stern pinball every once in a while

[20:08] Poles an embarrassing move and I think this is just the karma of this dumb machine

[20:14] And I think for everyone who bought this $20,000 game

[20:17] I am laughing at you from New York City. Trust me. I am laughing at you

[20:21] It doesn't mean we're not friends Neil McCray. I know how much money you got

[20:24] I know some of you guys bought it don't cancel your subscription

[20:28] But just trust me at 53rd street and third avenue

[20:32] Canada is laughing at you right now because you never should have bought this game for this much money

[20:37] And stern doesn't even care enough to go over each of these the most expensive game they've ever sold

[20:43] They don't even care to go over it with the fine tooth comb and make sure everything is installed properly

[20:50] What a joke and you sent them a message that this was enough to charge $20,000 dollars for

[20:55] Everybody thank you for being a subscriber more to come

[20:58] I mean galactic tank for his batting clean up in this entire crazy month

[21:02] I don't know what David fixes thinking he waited so long. There's no money left

[21:06] There is no money left in this hobby to go to anything else like you've got godfather money gobbled up

[21:11] You've got freaking food fighter money gobbled up scooby-doo money gobbled up all of these companies selling product right now

[21:19] And David fixes sitting on his hands

[21:21] Thinking he's got the cleanup pinball machine that's gonna knock it out of the park trust me

[21:26] I've seen it

[21:27] It is loaded in a way in a weird original IP way

[21:31] But he has waited too long

[21:34] He's gonna learn a hard lesson in marketing. You can't do it like this

[21:38] He should just delay launching this game for a couple months

[21:41] Let these games be made

[21:43] Let some people fall out of love with scooby-doo and maybe fall out of love with food fighters and fall out of love with godfather

[21:49] Because that also happens in his hobby people right every new game is the best game ever and canate is a loser

[21:55] And why does anyone listen to that troll and then all of a sudden what happens most of the games we get them

[22:00] We realize it's just another pinball machine

[22:03] Everything is overpriced and we're on to the next well. Let's get on to the next show this shows over

[22:20] oh

[22:27] l

[22:35] Sad

[22:39] You
