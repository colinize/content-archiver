[00:00] better everybody went chunk to night. Canate is pinball podcast the nipple baby. The narcissist,

[00:09] the sociopath, the one pinball podcaster beating by a woke weighted voting system. How are we ever

[00:18] gonna do it? How are we gonna stop this man calling it kill the trippies? He's gonna take a year off

[00:27] from doing what? What else is he doing? He's the biggest woke bro in pinball. These guys easily

[00:35] offend it. You know, if you're gonna buy the trippy award show, don't kill it. Execute. You get

[00:43] judged in life by executions people. All right, we on YouTube now. We're gonna share the link on

[00:50] Facebook. I see myself. I look good today, by the way. I got some color. I look good. I look good.

[00:56] I got to say it looked good. Um, August 9th. Love. We're live in both places. I love it. I love it.

[01:06] We're making money. We're having fun. You know what I'm saying? All those guys that canate is

[01:12] bad for my mental health. I can't accept canators of apology. We don't even know what we did.

[01:23] We don't even know what we said. Oh my god, get to the chopper. So I heard from distributors. Two

[01:33] games not selling very well right now are doomed. And predator's gonna be tough. Who's buying these

[01:41] games? I'm like, I'm in a good mood. It was a good week at work. Beautiful weather out. I got the

[01:48] most beautiful family, the most beautiful friends. I got amazing extended family in pinball. I got a

[01:54] bunch of cranky pinball content creators who won't accept the canada apology. Seriously, seriously.

[02:03] I think I sit Ralph like a picture of my kids. I'm like, dude, I just bury it.

[02:08] Burry the hatchet. He won't do it. He won't do it. It's unbelievable.

[02:13] Grown man in his forties. It's too much. He's too much. We can't trust him. We can't, we don't

[02:24] know what he's gonna say next. He looks like he's having a lot of fun though. Like we're supposed to

[02:30] be the guys having fun. He looks like he's having all the fun. He's making all the mula and the

[02:37] content space, which isn't a lot by the way. And he doesn't shield every game, which we're all doing.

[02:43] You know you're doing it guys. You know you're doing it. Oh yeah, this game's not bad. They would

[02:48] give galactic tank force. It's game's not bad. It's fun. It's fun. It's just fun. Everything's fun. It's fun.

[02:53] Yeah, I just got this game's fun. It's fun. You know, Venom at least fun. It's fun. John Winkley. It's

[02:58] fun. It's fun. I'm having fun. We're having fun. D&D Ellie. It's fun. It's fun. I like saving my

[03:02] progress. What's in the coffee, bro? What's in the coffee is a little retro Ralph, a little Donald

[03:10] Garrison mixed up. A little carry hearty little Zach and Greg everybody. Guys are all doing great work.

[03:18] I mean it when I say it, the pinball content space is the best it's ever been.

[03:27] Bar none. The amount of great pinball content you get to listen to now. When I started, it was like

[03:38] John's arcade, Todd Tucky, Nate Chivers and that was it. There was like a spooky podcast but you

[03:47] know, whatever. Back then and we didn't really care what they had to say that much. Now Spooky's

[03:53] amazing and you can't even get one of their new games. But nowadays you've got like so many good

[04:00] podcasts, so many good YouTube channels. Jack Freak and Danger was not around when I started.

[04:07] Maybe he was. I don't know. Freak and kale and Rachel at Electric Bat. Bro, like for those of you

[04:16] for those of you out there who still think like, you know, like I didn't deserve the lose by 0.01%

[04:23] where Colin didn't share the second and third place votes. And you know, even though I got almost

[04:28] 100 more first place votes, I lost. You know what? That that loss and I know I acted like a little

[04:35] baby and I complained about it and everyone's like he's doing it again. He's acting like a little

[04:42] spoiled entitled brat. He's acting like a guy whose first car was bought for him by his dad.

[04:50] And damn it. He's like being honest about it. Damn it. He would tell people he got a Harry Potter

[04:56] CES payment without having to be threatened to be revealed by Canadian baby. That's why they don't

[05:02] want to talk to me because Canadian's just like he hates himself more than they could ever hate me.

[05:08] But I hate and love myself at the same time baby boys. This is how life is supposed to be the

[05:15] yearn and the yane. You don't get it yet. Yeah guys take it all too seriously. You actually think

[05:23] people care. You actually think people care that you went on vacation and you had to go find

[05:30] Bimbal all at I'm I'm trapped. I gotta go find some Bimbal. Like you guys act like if you don't

[05:37] play Pimbal for a day, your day is incomplete. And as I told Brenda a few years ago, a little secret

[05:44] you guys don't know. I said watch. I'm not going to play any Pimbal for an entire year and win

[05:50] favorite Pimbal podcaster. I didn't. Guess what happened. I won by a landslide baby. Who's

[05:59] having a good time here? So there's a like turn on those shows now like well you know let's talk

[06:02] about the uh the second wizard mode that you get to after the third multiplier and you don't

[06:07] really have a little bit of problem with my vertical up kick and my jaws ball be sticking behind

[06:13] my boat and just someone have a fix for the shark fin because sometimes it gets caught on the

[06:18] low gives a shit and I normally don't curse but who gives a shit guys nobody cares. Nobody cares.

[06:28] We are here to be entertained and you honestly you think this is like an act you think it's no no no

[06:35] it's just called being alive. If you can't appreciate being alive on planet earth August 9th

[06:44] 2025 after all the crap going on in the world after all the places you could have been born in

[06:49] this world you guys are cranky about a Pimball content creator a few gonna hold on to this

[06:56] gonna gonna gonna trap this anger and I'm gonna hold on to it and when he texts me I'm gonna

[07:02] ignore him and when he goes to shake my hand I'm gonna I don't I don't do that I don't do that

[07:08] I'm a man of God I'm a man of Jesus a man who preached about forgiveness of turning the other

[07:15] cheek maybe you guys need to go back to the church of canada and realize what empathy looks like

[07:22] and that yeah I'll be sorry in life for serious serious things that you should be sorry for

[07:30] but hurting your precious little pinball feelings oh sorry I'm so dead

[07:38] I'm sorry you know what we got in this hobby ladies and gentlemen we've got players and jumps and 99% of players are cool dudes I mean it

[07:48] the zone most of this hobby is cool mofo dudes and you know who you are you've got beautiful families beautiful kids beautiful

[07:56] pin collection a beautiful house and even if you don't have a lot of money you've got a beautiful mindset

[08:02] you've got the right vibes the right energy the right attitude money doesn't matter man

[08:07] it matters a little bit short it does I won't lie about that but it's not everything man I meet people

[08:12] every day at the restaurant at the bar I'm on my third marriage I'm in a blended family my kids are

[08:18] with the wife and the new husband get out of town man no one's ever gonna be my boys is father but me

[08:26] why am I talking like this great cult is like what do you do and are you culturally appropriating

[08:30] yourself as someone else I don't even think that's the appropriate usage I'm not even on anything but a

[08:37] half a cup of ice coffee and this is why I know it's hard let me be sincere for a moment I am sincerely sorry

[08:45] to Donald Garrison I was wrong I was wrong I hit him up I like was talking smack with him and it was

[08:54] inappropriate and I think I made a joke about his student loans and the fact that he had

[09:00] medical student loans and he was buying all these pins and that was that was a low blow and it

[09:05] wasn't because of insecurity it was just I was just getting a little bit annoyed you know that he

[09:10] was drafting off of me a lot and and sort of like I would do something then his show would be

[09:14] exactly the same and then his wife said something to me about your jealous of my husband's show and

[09:19] that just rub me the wrong way because I know that he really looked up to me and he really loved

[09:24] the show and it just rub me the wrong way that she would say that that I am envious of his show now

[09:31] implying and that and that she shouldn't have said that I shouldn't have said keep your wife

[09:36] on a leash which was wrong but what annoyed me the most is we had a phone call the day after that

[09:43] and we we were like all right fine I he's like I don't want to get into the drama that's what he said

[09:48] to me so you got to imagine this but let's just like let's just put it all out there on this

[09:51] episode because there's not a lot of pimple news he said I don't want to get into the drama

[09:56] and and I was like cool so imagine this you hang up the phone with someone who's like look okay cool

[10:00] like we both we both threw jabs at each other both of us were wrong both of us were acting like jack

[10:07] asses that is the truth okay who fired first does it matter we had a phone call

[10:13] then he does a show with jang is my man over here and just throws me under the bus like throws me

[10:22] under the bus like he used that moment to stir up attention and drama for his own benefit fine

[10:30] don't I get it nobody gets how drama can lead to attention and and like you know putting you on

[10:36] the map fine but that was like two years ago jang is three years ago and still to this day one

[10:45] no no no so all I'm saying is Don sorry you know we have different content styles we have different

[10:54] approaches but man it is what it is right okay and then with Ralph I don't even know man I don't

[11:00] even know what the straw was that broke the camels back with Ralph I don't we used to talk we were

[11:06] fine I think what happened with Ralph is he just keeps everyone calls him a shell like it is like

[11:12] not everybody but like he gets called a shell all the time and he like and it hurts him and I don't

[11:17] think he is a shell I think he's just an innately positive dude I do I just don't think he like

[11:27] I don't think he has like the negative gene I don't think he like gets upset by things I don't

[11:32] think he plays pimbal and gets pissed off about like this or that or like you know I also don't

[11:38] look I also think he doesn't quite get the full context of the hobby the pricing and so that's what

[11:42] leads people to be like well he thinks this is loaded and this is packed and it's okay but I think

[11:49] what happened with Ralph is it was the potter pin payment timing was like that's all I'm going to

[11:56] say I don't he wasn't disclosing that right away and it's fine and then he did and then I think I

[12:02] might have I might have I'm going to be honest I was like dude you gotta let people know this I might

[12:06] have like said I'm gonna let people know you got payment for that game before he said it and I

[12:11] and it was a little bit of a threat it was it was a little bit of a threat because I don't think

[12:16] as a pinball content creator you have to disclose this stuff you can't be taking kickbacks from

[12:22] distros you can't be taking payment from manufacturers and then reviewing the games and and then

[12:28] convincing people to buy the games like that is not ethical content creation I forget the term

[12:35] pinball media none of us are media none of us are making money but that's the thing and I look and

[12:41] the reason I do that because I've been doing this for 12 years I've worked my ass off I've done

[12:46] more shows than everybody you know that I even just mentioned 1121 shows I don't get any

[12:52] payment I don't get any sponsors I don't get any kickbacks I don't pay a special price and I

[12:57] disclose everything and so like again like oh canator the negative can they don't do that they don't

[13:06] they sometimes do it but they don't always do it

[13:14] all right do you think do you talk to Ralph or not no dude he won't talk to me he won't even

[13:19] he won't even like he won't he won't he won't engage so if you don't engage then it's going to be

[13:23] a one-way conversation like this and then they have to go watch this this is a sad part about when

[13:28] you continue to like be this way these like I don't even watch any of their stuff like because

[13:35] I don't care to engage with people that are so sensitive and and but then they have to go watch

[13:41] all of this stuff because you know I would watch it if someone's like you know if like if someone

[13:46] was like talking smack about me like I'm just gonna turn the cards like if someone was like I'm

[13:51] not even talking smack if someone were talking about me openly on a public forum and say hey I'm

[13:56] trying to like let's bury the hatchet because everybody in the pinball community would just like

[13:59] to see that happen and it's like let's just do it you think do you think I would be like no I'm

[14:05] not doing it nobody's had a more contentious I mean there's nobody's had a more contentious

[14:11] period than me and Zach many okay like it was bad man like it was it was 10 times worse than what

[14:19] Don and Ralph those guys couldn't hack getting into it with Greg and Zach because Greg and Zach

[14:26] like their alpha males and they get it and like when they hit they hit right and and and they don't

[14:32] they don't but but but here's the thing and here's why I respect Greg and Zach so much because

[14:38] they give it they dished it and they have a heart and they don't want to stay angry they don't

[14:45] want to stay mad and neither did I and we for years now are 100% fine it doesn't mean we're gonna be

[14:51] best friends but we're cordial we'll talk we'll just like you know what I'm saying there's no like

[14:56] there's no like I'm I'm not gonna respond to a Texas is happy Saturday but it's picked at you

[15:02] lah extravaganza anyway um yeah not doing the David fix drama next

[15:13] because out of all the low blows that I've ever had happened to me in life and I've had a few

[15:17] his was the lowest and he um yeah he's just not worth even talking about do you talk okay like

[15:26] you don't care about relations with man's being scotty pinball you don't care about relationships

[15:34] I do care about relationships with manufacturers I have more relationships with manufacturers

[15:39] than you guys realize spooky Lucas here isn't he not George Gomez and I speak

[15:46] frequently enough George Gomez and I went when I went to stern uh George Gomez picked me up in

[15:53] his Porsche and the rest of the content creators were on a separate tour he gave me a separate VIP

[15:58] tour I mean is that not a relationship Jack Danger and I were talking yesterday um I'm very good

[16:07] with the management over at JJP um very uh let's see I like I know it has a better relationship with

[16:16] deep- Dutch pinball than me so you understand my point is I have stronger relationships

[16:22] than people realize I have more relationships with manufacturers because they effing respect me

[16:29] or they or they have to listen to me it might be one or the other the the the ego in me might be

[16:35] like they respect I think they do respect me I think when they listen to my show and I'll tell you

[16:40] who told me this years ago Lyman Sheets used to say to me I'm not even making this up gang

[16:45] Chris I love your show you say stuff that all of us are feeling back at the home front and

[16:52] everybody listens who like because you're saying what's really going on in our hobby

[16:58] you know what I'm saying it's like so I don't know I take that as a keep keep going look and if

[17:04] you've listened to the shows this week by the way they've been nothing but positive nothing but

[17:10] a great entertaining discussion about what's coming down the road in pinball and there's no

[17:15] negative there's no mud slaying and nothing nothing so it's like all right I'm going to expo

[17:29] all right should we talk about pinball now that might might coffee it might like is it too much

[17:34] was that too much you guys like that hey hey gang we have no super chats

[17:38] you after I'm gonna do that you guys are gonna hit me up with zero bucks zero on Facebook zero

[17:43] on YouTube this is what it is you know what makes my haters hate the most you guys know this

[17:48] they hate seeing the success of the show so why don't we do this why don't we try I'm gonna put

[17:55] a target out there we might hit it we might not I think amongst this crew on YouTube

[18:01] I think we can get to five hundred bucks I do I do now look I'm on Facebook maybe 200 like

[18:11] 5,000 5,000 stars Pete Rosen's gonna hit it he always hits it sad boy he's not here he's the he

[18:17] sad boy was my boy sad boy was the patron you know retro Django today I feel like retro Django

[18:23] might might might want to move that cursor down to the dollar sign

[18:28] Dan Dan I will absolutely let you buy me a drink at expo and people forget okay

[18:34] canada you know five hundred bucks okay when when I was at um when I used to go to tpf I'd always

[18:40] do a whole canada happy hour at parries picked up the bill cost few thousand dollars as a thank you

[18:47] to my fans I always you guys know when I go to expo I'm very very generous I'm overly generous I'm

[18:53] overly giving back right now is always telling me there we go Matt Matt starting the charge with

[18:59] the ten bucks okay so we only have four hundred and ninety dollars to go and by the way we can

[19:04] hit that with this crew with this think about the thousands of dollars I've saved you over the

[19:11] years because you simply followed my advice now um we'll see if we get there it's always fun to

[19:17] have a goal in life um let's talk about what's going on in pinball shall we all right so we are

[19:23] August 9th we are about four weeks or less away from Star Wars now I keep going back and forth

[19:29] on Star Wars I actually think the rumor of episode one through three makes more sense to me

[19:36] you know we're all in this oh it's going to be four or five and I just don't think it is

[19:42] why would they remake dude sad boy bro shout out to big gomis for dropping that spike three

[19:50] knowledge on our butts the other day while looking like an Italian coot dealer oh my god um

[19:59] what was the gomis spike three news sad boy can someone I don't where was that um

[20:05] I heard people talking about it I mean when I talk to George I know that the screen's going to be

[20:11] bigger what was the news though I can someone write in the chat what the spike three news is

[20:20] sad boy you're the best by the way you say you're gonna I'm gonna do it a private episode for

[20:25] sad boy like that's I'm gonna make pinside babies where I actually drink and go off the handle

[20:31] and exclusive for Saturday morning spectacular donators I think that's a really good idea so anyone

[20:40] that donates you want you want you want the you want you want the full heat you want the whiskey

[20:46] canadas pin inside babies where I just go off on all the act like what where I really get to the

[20:52] root of how I feel about it all that will be the ultimate way to reward people who donate on these

[20:59] shows um okay so here is the deal better processor all right we knew that what else better expression

[21:08] lights different cab where where did gomis say this add members to youtube better sound system

[21:22] the sound system is shit I'm sorry to curse the sound system sucked you know it's just

[21:29] funny like okay on loser kid okay so the sound system let's see I think okay so nothing but

[21:39] is that anything new like so where is it

[21:45] okay next game is spike three but the following game will first have the spike three cabinet

[22:00] all right yeah you know what I heard now gang that the price increase price increase

[22:07] new cabinet will be metal did he say that he said the new cabinet is metal

[22:18] can someone confirm or deny that he didn't say that

[22:30] see this is the problem so the next game's cabinet is still going to be

[22:34] the next game's cabinet is still going to be the old cabinet

[22:43] man I like I feel like they've been slowly rolling it out

[22:53] no they're not going to make they're not going to make a metal cabinet um that just feels weird

[23:00] uh I I gotta be very careful with the way a pinball machine looks and feels and don't mess it up too much

[23:12] yeah I mean I kind of like I feel like the evolution of the cabinet will be somehow to work in

[23:20] the expression lightings lighting system into the cabinet um wow okay um

[23:30] all right so you guys I'm assuming you guys are all hoping for Star Wars episode

[23:36] four five and six right

[23:43] we've seen the new cabinet already with Jack Danger accidentally showing it where where is it David

[23:48] is that picture anywhere I mean I don't expect like I mean first of all there's only so much

[23:55] you can do with the cabinet I mean I'm assuming the changes are probably inside the cabinet not

[23:59] even outside so it's in David then David if it's an easy picture to find share it here I've not

[24:11] seen where this new cabinet picture is I don't know man I I'm just assuming that the lighting

[24:22] system is going to be built into the cabinet more than like sticking out like like you know

[24:26] pes dispense candy it's jacks um do this David David can you email me can you email me a canada

[24:41] canada pinball at gmail.com email me the picture David canada pinball at gmail.com and I will throw

[24:49] it up for everybody in a link okay didn't go miss a cabinet is staying the same size so it didn't

[24:54] yeah it's gonna be the same size I'm assuming the inside of the cabinet it's gonna be different

[25:03] I'm waiting I'm gonna let me get my Gmail open hold on let's get it open I'm waiting for this

[25:07] guys picture uh I got my inbox refresh canada pinball at gmail.com we're having people work for us I

[25:16] love it we're working on the show together well I'll just share a screen when you when you yeah

[25:21] why don't just do that I'll share a screen on YouTube all right he just sent it all right let's do

[25:26] this all right hold on canada pinball at gmail.com here we go David sent it okay yeah franchise right

[25:41] all right here we go all right let's do this hold on sorry YouTube you're gonna have to go to

[25:49] sorry phase but get to go to YouTube. Let's go here I think it's all right there we go

[26:04] all right so here's here's the new Stern cabinet there it is

[26:10] franchise

[26:15] franchise up brother um yeah let me zoom in a little bit hold on

[26:25] there's nothing different up front it's all

[26:33] sorry I'm like I can't why is it

[26:36] oh come on

[26:42] here we go all right here's this is the main difference

[26:50] bigger else yeah this is exactly what I thought it would be

[26:55] so what I think is going to be interesting is will they offer this because it's you know like

[27:04] I've played the godzilla that has it this size will they offer this as a um you know as an

[27:13] upgrade if you will to older games well gang smaller speakers don't mean that you can't get more sound

[27:20] they just get look guys go to youtube canada pinball right now if you're on facebook I'm not

[27:27] out like here I'll turn the camera around for you you you guys this is what it looks like

[27:35] it's got narrower speakers and it's got same size translate and that's it like it's I think

[27:44] what's gonna be annoying though I think what's gonna be annoying is the um I think what's gonna be

[27:53] annoying is like okay so you're gonna buy star wars and it's not gonna have the new cabinet

[27:59] it's not gonna have the bigger screen yet that's what I worry about is like I don't want I don't want like

[28:06] I don't want to buy at these prices some in-between version of the next platform

[28:13] I you know what I'm saying like it's that to me would suck because star wars is a dream theme and

[28:19] like star wars should have the full kit and caboodle so at least I like with jersey jack that I

[28:26] like is you know they they all they don't mess around they they started at the right place

[28:33] and even when jersey jack has made some changes the kids are home by the way

[28:40] yeah what what hurts killian

[28:50] you know what I think is the dumbest mod and the dumbest thing that I don't even I don't even like it

[28:56] I think speaker lights are just stupid they they like I don't know like I think Batman might

[29:01] have him just read but I think this whole like rainbow lighting up the speakers is so

[29:06] Guido for lack of a better word it's so

[29:10] ghetto in a way like it just you know it just feels like LED lights in your car going around the

[29:14] interior like it's just I think speaker lighting is like over oh unnecessary now look there's times

[29:22] when I think it looks good because it works and I think the way spooky does their back box where

[29:26] that it's like it's it's blended in with artwork I think it looks better but when when you're like

[29:32] calling attention though to this black area with this rainbow RGB LEDs you know like why

[29:40] why might why are you highlighting like a speaker why they add to the game I don't I don't know

[29:52] I don't have them on guns and roses do I I don't maybe I don't know I don't I don't you know

[30:02] there's a fine line between dressing a game up and then making it tacky that that's my I

[30:09] I really believe that Stern I've always felt Stern's expression lighting system is pretty garbage

[30:19] and looks really pedestrian and with the how cheap it is to do like a pin stadium kind of

[30:24] lighting system like it's just it's kind of pathetic all games should have like a pin stadium

[30:30] sort of system built into the cabinet and it's insane that they don't it's the pin stadium

[30:37] guys probably mean millions by selling everybody the most overpriced highest margin thing imaginable

[30:44] like literally those strips probably cause nothing the money was in the software to make but that

[30:49] even adds not that expensive do you think there will ever do online co-op gameplay I mean I hope I

[31:02] don't I don't think so I think the thing that problem with pinball unlike video games is every single

[31:08] video game is the same right it's not hardware software the problem with co-op and pinball is you're

[31:16] you got you know you're trying to connect two machines to kind of work together but like

[31:23] there can be physical differences on on machines I think you could do it I just don't think they will

[31:31] I just don't I don't think they think they I don't think they want to gang and I've been saying this

[31:37] a few times let's say the reason why they don't want you to buy a expensive pinball machine be able

[31:43] to hook it up to the internet and have endless replay value fun with your friends connected to your

[31:48] game is they want you to buy the next game you know when you get a game you love and the online

[31:55] plays is so satisfying you you know I was playing like UFC 2 on Xbox for like 10 years until they

[32:00] finally took down the servers for it because once you get something you love and it's online like I

[32:04] could play Starcraft 2 brood war forever like I I don't think there's ever been a better PC game

[32:11] than Starcraft 2 so I don't think they want to give you that kind of

[32:18] satisfaction because I think they want you to keep buying the next product

[32:23] because the only way it works is if if there was so much scale that they could make money on

[32:30] the subscriptions but also like feel confident you're gonna buy the next installment of the game

[32:36] sad boy 50 bucks leading we've got 100 stars on Facebook this is this guy's you guys are

[32:46] I mean I know the summer is expensive but man man I mean I think I have one of my greatest

[32:52] intros ever it was it was a good show it was a good intro all right so storm pit mall we've got

[32:59] so here's the other thing we I think we know now that Jack danger is finishing his next game

[33:04] it is rumored to be Pokemon and I think it's gonna be a huge hit I still think it's gonna be a huge

[33:13] hit I think Pokemon is gonna sell tremendously well I think it'll actually be more fun and colorful

[33:20] and awesome than like you know it'll have more power than Poo Fighters or even X-Men

[33:27] ride ride riddle me this why light up flipper buttons when you can't yet

[33:32] Frenchy 100% I don't understand like lighting up the flipper buttons I I don't think it looks good

[33:40] you can't see it when your fingers are on the button I just don't get it why why grant

[33:47] a lot of hope with the me well grant that thought is though they sell tens of millions of copies

[33:55] of the game it's economy is a scale people let me get let me show you guys a question how many of you

[34:01] know a company named supercell just raise a hand how many of you guys have ever heard of a company

[34:08] called supercell anybody supercell they make video games ever heard of them are they a household

[34:20] name like Barbie household name like I don't know X-Men household right probably never heard of them

[34:30] so supercell let me see let me see which there okay they make a they make a mobile game

[34:45] called clash of clans right okay supercell made 20 billion dollars off of that game

[34:58] 20 let me let me let me let me read 20 billion dollars the star the Barbie movie made

[35:08] $2 billion and supercells a company with just like 60 people or something like that

[35:15] so it's absolutely when we were pitching them as a client I was like this is insane

[35:21] it's because it's economies of scale because they have 200 million users of their games

[35:28] globally 200 million users so and their games are free until you add on stuff right so if you have

[35:38] 200 million user base and you just get a percentage of them to give you 10 bucks do the math

[35:49] barrels of fun is having a trouble selling a thousand games predator can't sell a thousand units

[35:58] you know I'm saying like that's the difference

[36:07] I think that I think that the next couple months are going to be pretty brutal on a few companies

[36:15] I think it's going to be brutal I think barrels is going to struggle the problem with Dune is this

[36:20] the they they needed to get more orders in the window they had the first the first six months

[36:27] of your gaming out you need to sell almost like 75% of your inventory I don't think they have

[36:34] the problem is games start to become old news then the next problem becomes is people start to see

[36:40] the games pop up on the used market for less than MSRP or at new inbox prices so like when that

[36:46] happens who's ordering it new no and like the game's just not in enough places right so it's like if

[36:54] they're they're just making a hundred where where you getting time on the game now look it's going

[37:01] to be a very important expo for these guys you can oh look you can always have a second life if

[37:09] if the game becomes amazing and the code really wakes up and grabs people exposed going to be really

[37:16] important for them the problem is is now you know it's next to Potter and the problem is is if it's

[37:24] Star Wars like I you know it's just on theme alone if I'm playing Star Wars and I hear that Star Wars

[37:31] theme song it's gonna be really hard to have a more fun experience on a Dune machine

[37:37] and so that's the problem with a theme where like it's I get why they made it but you know it's

[37:45] it's it's kind of difficult to win people over if Star Wars hits Star Wars is really bad for

[37:52] someone trying to compete with it you know watching King Kong has actually been a lot of fun watching

[37:58] the collapse of the King Kong value is absolutely amazing I think it also shows Stern was a little

[38:06] bit arrogant and thinking that you know L. N. being the king of the monsters L. N. would be able to

[38:11] like you know make it all work it didn't work the fact that there's new inbox King Kong L.

[38:19] E's now moving closer to $10,000 right and they made all thousand of them which means those premiums

[38:27] are worth crap which means the L. E. you bought for 13 has lost so much money and you know what it's

[38:35] funny to me is like these con guys don't get it they're like games really fun games like people don't

[38:39] get it like no one cares guys nobody cares that game clearly should have been it should have started

[38:48] at 10 5 for Nellie there's no assets what did they have to spend money on you and then they made

[38:55] everyone look the same you know and so King Kong is just gonna it's I said I called it from the

[39:01] beginning King Kong is the next Avengers I said it from the very beginning it is the next

[39:06] Avengers audio and slave you and I brother I called it it's the next Avengers it's gonna be

[39:13] game no one really cares about was the Steve Richie Star Wars that bad Steve Richie Star Wars is

[39:18] is it it first of all it was it wasn't designed to be Star Wars from the ground up he that was

[39:25] supposed to be Jurassic Park it's got a tie fighter on a spring it's got an almost nearly

[39:30] impossible way to get into the hyper drive you you you could play 15 games on that game and

[39:36] never get it into the hyper drive and the artwork is bad the coding is bad the game is bad it has

[39:45] no moment of mechanical wow in it because again it's just a bad game it's a bad game when you

[39:54] consider what Star Wars could be right it's a it's a great whatever something else maybe but it's

[40:00] a bad Star Wars. Dune is a great game when it's working too many issues out of the gate I'm still

[40:06] interested in one but went need a conversation with David well what are the issues so Brad like

[40:12] what where did you play a dune that wasn't working right

[40:21] yeah so Anthony just said this on Facebook I'm psyched and then I want to read your comment here

[40:26] I've psyched all L. Wynn machines in my home at one point and Kong doesn't draw me in for some reason

[40:34] and I'm a fan of the IP so location is fine enough Anthony what's been your favorite L. Wynn game

[40:41] if you've psyched them all spooky is the king of mechanical wow right now the game freezes up

[40:50] wow see yeah I mean that's not good again I just think the game was released too early

[40:56] and you know you you only get a first chance you only get one chance to make a first impression

[41:04] spooky Luke baby spooky Luke I need you to call me later today let's let's iron out the details

[41:09] about your next game launch and what we're gonna do that's gonna be fun and trigger the

[41:14] Canadian the Canadian content haters and don't do the same thing for someone else spooky Luke don't

[41:21] let's let's do something special you know it you know it you know it you know it um you know

[41:29] you want to do it too it's deep down in your soul you want to do it oh godzilla and then jaws

[41:34] yeah I mean those are two those are the two um what's up kill pukyly Luke oh he just said

[42:26] few questions about pinball yeah spooky Luke okay okay okay okay don't wait don't touch it don't

[42:33] touch it because it's gonna mess up the mic all right can I ask you would you rather have a pinball

[42:40] machine or a ring pop would you how much would you spend on a ring pop a dollar or 13,000 dollars

[42:53] is 13,000 dollars 13 on a ring pop oh wait wait we've identified a new market here um what would

[43:03] you rather have star wars or lion king pinball lion king yeah all right how do you say spooky Luke's

[43:13] name again spooky Duke spooky Duke spooky Duke okay okay get out here you're making you're making a fool

[43:20] yeah all right spooky Duke is gonna be a new nickname for spooky Luke um and I think it's uh it's

[43:29] about time spooky Duke was the alter ego what are you touching Killian no no don't play

[43:36] no no it's too loud go go see mommy

[43:39] spooky Duke I love Killian 13,000 dollar ring pops you know it's like

[43:55] someone needs to tell like Gomez like I think we're in the wrong business like

[43:59] what about 13,000 dollar ring pops it actually makes me feel like a company like Tiffany's if

[44:05] they really want to get pressed like Cartier they should make like a 13,000 dollar like diamond

[44:11] the dazzle ring that you could attach a popsicle to can you I think that would crush it on like

[44:19] breaking the internet spooky Duke spooky Duke I hear him saying it does there he's like spooky

[44:28] Duke spooky Duke yeah you know look I I feel like it does it does roll off the tongue spooky

[44:42] Duke I do feel that I've said it a few times the last couple weeks that the next three years

[44:48] of pinball are gonna be the best three years over the last 10 years of pinball I don't think we're

[44:52] gonna get back to ever the 1990s magic of value Williams I don't I I and I'm not just saying this

[45:00] because spooky Duke is here I absolutely I think we all owe a round of applause that the company

[45:10] and the game now that we're looking to for the most mechanical wow and magic in a game

[45:18] is the company that made America's most haunted what happened you have to think about this people

[45:27] when America's most haunted put it next to Wizard of Oz right okay so those were two companies

[45:32] making one was making this and one was making this and now you put evil dead

[45:39] next to Godfather right next to Elton John next to even Harry Potter the company put

[45:44] in the most mechanical wow in their games albeit some are some of the stuff is servo driven

[45:50] doesn't matter it's like they're actually putting that world under glass mechanical wow

[45:55] let's give a round of applause to spooky Duke and the family over at spooky pinball

[46:01] you know spooky Duke he's yelling it downstairs spooky Duke I mean sir yeah yeah we're gonna

[46:14] spooky Duke in the house yeah we're gonna get we're we're look I'm on the list for the next game

[46:22] I'm getting the next game we're bend over and I'll show you baby oh I shouldn't say that right

[46:29] right Brad is it where you put it it uh spooky Duke okay um baby hook I don't know what that means okay so

[46:42] here's the thing I keep saying this they've got the only FOMO going right now how did this happen

[46:50] how did spooky pinball get the only FOMO going right now like there's no FOMO to get a Harry Potter

[46:57] everywhere anyone wants an even hammer what trim do you want you can have it there's no FOMO to get

[47:01] jaws 50th and you want it you can have it there's no FOMO anywhere right now no the dude like heck

[47:07] like anyone go get a dude like nothing the only game with FOMO is spooky's next game

[47:15] I it's absolutely insane to me that they did it they flipped the script on everybody

[47:20] and they did it

[47:22] by getting better every game they did it by listening to feedback they did it by acquiring

[47:35] talented people with passion like the fact that spooky pinball has

[47:40] all right are we back are we back I don't know all right yeah I feel like I feel like

[47:58] stern pinball just like pull the plug on our on our internet now but like I think about this all

[48:06] the time the unbelievable transformation of that company I love it all the face I don't know

[48:17] how they did it I don't know how they did it

[48:30] hold on let me just I got her charges phone let me see if I can flip it

[48:34] oh no I got to charge you guys a little bit on Facebook

[48:47] okay just a little I gotta get you guys a little juice you guys can be off to the side for a

[48:51] little bit why juice you my setup is terrible everyone else has like really good setups like

[49:02] professional setups mine is um if you could see how I'm doing this right now and this is not

[49:10] gonna work as a block and chat home on it is so low five yeah that's also another reason why

[49:18] people don't like me because they put so much effort into everything they do and I'm like oh yeah

[49:21] well I mean the real the real tech working the the only tech I need is my personality

[49:30] why is it oh it's typing it's funny yeah take me the longest

[49:37] um you got you guys I have to look off to the side a little bit so how's everybody doing

[49:48] well I look I I think that I was saying that stern yeah look branch is a lot to deal with

[49:55] he he reminds me of myself but he's worth it like he's worth it it's like worth putting up with

[50:03] his passion it's worth putting up with his podcast it's worth putting up with his you know putting

[50:08] his foot in his mouth like it's like it's worth it because in the end you're gonna want you're

[50:12] gonna want him on the package you know I know he's felt that way about franche he's like you know

[50:17] us Italians like we just don't we don't hold back it's like I think it's in our DNA

[50:36] Facebook puts everything reverse I don't like it I got to figure out a way to fix that it's

[50:40] it's it's it's it's not the best way to watch any of this stuff um I think the price hike is

[50:49] gonna be problematic but I also think if it's Star Wars you're gonna pay if it's Pokemon it'll

[50:56] it'll it'll be fine where where it's gonna get dicey is like fallout who's gonna pay 13.7

[51:02] for a fallout I heard the price hike is $700 now on the LEDs moving forward 700 bucks more

[51:10] I don't know man like the world's crazy now every time I check my credit card bill it's like

[51:14] two grand like I'm like what did I buy I'm like well you went out to dinner that night it was

[51:17] 200 you wanted to dinner that night it was 250 you bought around a drinks for people it was

[51:21] $180 like it's just yeah I think it a little bit of a pay raise which was nice would have been

[51:29] nice if they told me about it too you put it I'll take it but you know I'm not making money like

[51:36] like if I was working at meta or Netflix like all these tech bros I mean anyone working these

[51:40] tech companies is is is is so happy right now they're making a fortune like even like Nvidia's of 80

[51:47] 90 88% in just a year again after we already went through the roof

[51:55] ah what's up spooky doesn't need to compete with Stern no spooky doesn't need to compete with

[52:01] anybody they they they own the boutique space

[52:10] yeah franches art on guardians was very beautiful I think the one mistake franche made on art

[52:16] on some of the cabinets he made and he'll be the first to admit it he like would put the

[52:21] nicest art on the pro because he's like more people are gonna see the pro like that bro it's not how

[52:26] works bro you don't put the nicer cabinet on the pro it's not about the nicest always goes on the

[52:36] le I know you're right here for it you can you can punish for spending too much on credit you

[52:53] get punished for no credit yeah I mean I'm I do miss the beauty of Batman SLE it was absolutely gorgeous

[53:07] I it's not you know nothing's worth 35,000 dollars what I wish franche would have done

[53:14] on the catwoman edition was really had the catwoman lying across the entire cabinet

[53:22] a la alvira I always felt like the catwoman edition needed a new cabinet artwork the needed you know

[53:29] it all should have been like seductive and I knowing Chris I bet he wanted to do something like that

[53:38] and I bet they just kind of didn't want to you know go all in

[53:52] yeah see I knew it would be stern translate only I knew it I just I they're so annoying right I get that

[54:02] feeling about stern it's like they they make these decisions that are short-sighted I think that's

[54:09] like the best way to you know think about like some of the decisions stern's been making I think

[54:14] they make short-sighted decisions and because I don't think they really get no one wants a short-sighted

[54:21] decision because these games we want these games to live in our houses forever I'm gonna I'm gonna

[54:27] do this so

[54:34] all of us where's um I've been it's been pressing

[54:41] yeah and that's it that's it it's like everyone would have wanted like catwoman to have

[54:47] purple armor yellow piping her sexy curvaceous body all over the thing you know what I'm saying

[55:02] instead no

[55:08] carry hearty don't you're in the house what's up brother don't don't I'm happy you're here man

[55:13] I'm happy you're here done not that you're here can we can you can we cross the aisle together right now

[55:22] in front of 126 people which you know in in our tiny little nano in our nano influencer world can we

[55:32] right now just say you know what I am sorry for all that stupid shit I said and it was inappropriate

[55:40] and I shouldn't have said it and I really I'm sorry and I was a jerk and you looked up to me you

[55:48] looked up to the show I was inspiring your show and and it was wrong so I just I want you to know

[55:56] that and it's been a long time and I think I think we'll have more fun at shows when we're breaking

[56:03] beers I think this community has more fun when we're all breaking beers and we're just like

[56:09] like just shooting the shit so if you are I know like at Jjp it was awkward and and I don't blame you

[56:18] and that that sincerely mean it that none of none of like all that negative energy like makes

[56:29] either of our lives better so if you do accept my apology I would love to move on there will be no

[56:35] shhhh as you know shit talking and trust me like it it I I think we would both feel better so

[56:41] that's just just throwing it out there I see you're here just want to throw it out there

[56:51] I mean look it's it's um and I apologize to your wife and and I would do that personally too

[56:56] I mean I'll be like I I think our wives actually want us not to be

[57:09] want us to be in any of these views I think I think our wives look at all of our

[57:13] pinball behavior like what what are you doing now because they and they've seen us be put in bad moods

[57:18] yeah

[57:22] I I don't know did I don't know I I don't know if he's responding to Kelly Daniel

[57:29] I think he's just having pinball conversation yeah I don't I don't think he's even listening

[57:36] all right I mean it is what it is gang I mean I mean I um it's all I can do

[57:43] you

[57:45] all right I don't I don't need to watch this show well

[57:53] you know a lot of like there's a lot of crossover with who watches what

[58:07] well it is what it is you know

[58:09] now like I don't I don't go hang out in other people's spaces and ignore you know I just I don't

[58:19] know I just think it would be beneficial

[58:20] he's using the chat to promote his show and his clothing like this okay that's fine

[58:42] you know I guess I guess I guess it's just the way it is now it is man I mean the world is

[58:49] weird now it's it's a strange place like people are just um you know like they're triggered

[58:57] by a gene's ad now they're triggered by it's it there's like we're like everyone gets triggered

[59:08] and everyone gets canceled and then and no one no one ever like you can't even have a discord

[59:14] anywhere

[59:21] all right well bugs stream and scream is watching right now

[59:31] well look I'm happy don't hang it out here can't even get Ralph back here man anymore

[59:37] so I think we're gonna see Star Wars I think Expo I don't mean sure like manufacturers

[59:42] like look at Expo now like they need it um with in Schomburg Illinois I don't you know I

[59:54] is it sold out if you guys booked your hotel oh it's not even done it's a fake account

[01:00:05] now that's why is it I guess I guess you can just like I guess you can just uh can you put in any name

[01:00:14] no I don't know oh did I just get like trolled by a fake dawn um I uh is the hotel booked

[01:00:34] oh man the real where's the real dawn so like the the um the the show is like for those of you

[01:00:54] have for first I really want to go to this pinball at the beach if that's in what like early March

[01:01:04] I think I think that pinball at the beach is gonna become the new tpf

[01:01:15] I really do I think pinball at the beach is gonna be the new tpf I think tpf is the is the show you

[01:01:26] know without ed there it just does I don't it just doesn't have the same there's no trippies there

[01:01:34] there's no like I don't know it just I'd rather go to the beach and hang with everybody in a in a

[01:01:42] poolside setting and drink pinia coladas and play pinball well I got that sense you know I just got

[01:01:50] the sense that pinball the beach seem more fun than tpf and I don't know you know look some guys

[01:01:56] like we'll go to every show I I it's a shorter flight to go to pinball on the beach for me

[01:02:02] it's a more enticing location and and the fact that they got all the manufacturers to go

[01:02:09] because you know I I think that was the big get that was the big get

[01:02:21] and when you get the when you get the personalities there you're gonna get the the the the community

[01:02:26] there I think that um I think richi's game is not going to be to like

[01:02:38] expoish fall 2026

[01:02:50] all right so it is not a real don's pinball podcast account

[01:02:56] like because or is this franches account I don't get it

[01:03:06] oh it's not it's not really don't all right let's do this let's just make it fun

[01:03:15] let's just time them out

[01:03:17] all right I timed out dawn for 10 minutes to stop the the trolling on the chat

[01:03:33] yeah no I'd like I would say that same apology to dawn dude space I don't I don't you know it's no

[01:03:40] it's it's weird to me it's always weird to me that people I guess it's fun I mean it's what the

[01:03:45] internet all is it's like the internet is just built around trolling and being anonymous and

[01:03:53] and not not really being yourself it it wasn't really dawn guys someone create a route a retro

[01:04:04] Ralph arcade that will just keep having fake accounts

[01:04:09] yeah I should keep practicing my apologies um I just can't wait for today by the way again it is so

[01:04:19] nice out my goal today is to like scrub the house Pete rose in is on face but Pete like I literally

[01:04:30] I put out a goal today um

[01:04:38] jang jang is here's a deal if that was dawn and it wasn't a fake account and he's watching this show

[01:04:46] but he's not responding to anything that's weird though too no

[01:04:52] yeah but if it was the real dawn he's just I don't I don't I'm not gonna just let him come in here take

[01:05:02] over the entire chat for 10 minutes and not engage with so I will just you know that's how that works

[01:05:11] again this is my show this is my house this is my this is how I write I always say to people

[01:05:17] I always say to people I was if you want to come into my show he's not blocked it's timed out

[01:05:26] yeah well on time amount

[01:05:33] um there

[01:05:37] he's now he's he's on a 10 second but but jang is if that is really dawn you know

[01:05:43] you know what I'm saying if you like walking into someone's house party as a you know you

[01:05:48] you you you're you're joining and then refuse to talk to the host of the house but the host of the

[01:05:54] house is like hey man what's up that is don't do you not see that strangeness of that well he's not

[01:06:02] timed out now

[01:06:03] yeah

[01:06:09] all I asked for is normal behavior on this podcast you know me like I like I I've only had a block

[01:06:16] I don't know like a few people we we we had some real characters Pete Rosen with the 5,000 stars

[01:06:22] we got it I've only had a block a few people um on the patreon or you had to think about

[01:06:32] like this and how he says to be able to be Rosen thank you so much by the way like you are the

[01:06:36] number one fan sad boy hit with a little bit today but didn't get we didn't get the normal sad boy

[01:06:41] today we didn't get the the uh let's see sad boy with the 50 bucks all right

[01:06:50] franck the angelo not in the house today he's usually a

[01:06:54] um let's do a live chat okay

[01:06:57] all right all right

[01:07:09] jeng is jeng is jeng is you think it's normal for someone to join a live show as the live host

[01:07:16] is asking you questions to absolutely ignore them and just keep chatting on the side so jeng is

[01:07:23] you actually think that's like that's on me so that'd be like me going to don's live as he's

[01:07:31] talking to me directly small steps what does that mean jeng is no I don't believe in that I I believe

[01:07:40] in making progress is not that because that's just like to come into my show and just be promoting

[01:07:49] your stuff that that's not even kind like it's just so jeng is like you have to understand that

[01:07:55] like I did I work in this is like okay it's fine it is absolutely fine it's fine I unboxed I

[01:08:03] untimed him he's he's he's fine to go now he should be good to go let's see um

[01:08:20] I did not delete any messages

[01:08:38] it is what it is I don't know we'll see we'll all wait and see we'll all wait um

[01:08:46] but anyway we lose invaluable time all we got is time so I think that um I think the next three

[01:08:56] years are going to be bangers I think the prices are going to be through the roof and I think it is

[01:09:00] what it is and I think um you know I was talking to a friend who's got an ACDC and he's like dude do

[01:09:08] I sell my ACDC I was like dude yeah because that's one of the rumored games like ACDC coming back and

[01:09:15] I think all these Sam games that were hits and even like spike ones

[01:09:22] that I just think like stern is not going to hold back re-releasing stuff so like if you have a

[01:09:29] walking dead you're screwed if you have a tron you're going to be screwed if you have an ACDC you're

[01:09:32] going to be screwed that's an issue that's it I don't think you're going to be screwed if you

[01:09:38] have a lord of the rings I don't think that game's coming back but more aero smith more kiss

[01:09:43] I think I think I saw Zach many I don't know what the exact price I think it was a kiss topper

[01:09:50] I want to say a kiss topper was $3700 and just like yeah you could you could think about that

[01:10:01] I mean stupid like absolutely stupid but it it's like I also think kiss might be one that they bring

[01:10:08] back yeah I just think they're gonna remake all of the stuff I think they're gonna I think

[01:10:15] they're gonna remake all of the stuff and I think that's gonna be I don't think they care I think

[01:10:23] they they look at it as like the statue of limitations is up we made all these games many many

[01:10:29] years ago there's a lot of new people in the hobby and we're doing it you know we're we're

[01:10:35] set like me we're gonna do it anyway you know that's what set the things when they're like should we

[01:10:41] really make it yeah like Star Trek I'm really curious about Transformers and Brian Eddie

[01:10:57] uh I I I worry about Transformers because again I think the movie is the way to go I think the

[01:11:04] TV show is is it it's just there's too many episodes there's too many um they're not all like good you

[01:11:15] know and I think the movie has everything you loved about the show and so much more

[01:11:21] and I think the movies got the soundtrack the music it's got the moments like it's got the every

[01:11:27] main character you want and then some and and it's like it bridges the gap of the Optimus Prime

[01:11:34] the Rod and his Prime the Galvatron the Megatron it's it's still the greatest I think animated movie

[01:11:43] that holds my interest I mean I love Akira so much but like Akira's like Akira's hard to watch

[01:11:50] from beginning to end like as much as Transformers it's so much more of a serious

[01:11:55] movie the first 20 minutes of Akira are really the special the first 20 in the last 20 minutes

[01:12:02] are you done you're back like we we uh we you know I was getting inundated with the comments that

[01:12:09] it was a troll account and you weren't responding to any direct so that's it you're well if you were

[01:12:17] banned you wouldn't be your brother but is this you is this done is this you so done here's the thing

[01:12:23] here's the thing if if you I would love to have you hang out here we have Francia here I would love

[01:12:30] that Brett your Ralph I just if you want to hang out here which we want you to hang out here

[01:12:37] can you just acknowledge anything that we're saying here because I'm not I'm not gonna I'm not

[01:12:45] keen on just having you here to just talk to my community and then just absolutely

[01:12:52] ignore me because to me that is a passive aggressive move and I don't want that because it's

[01:12:58] distracting to me in my own community because I don't come over to anything that anybody else does

[01:13:03] and distract their community so that's just it and I think that's a fair ask

[01:13:10] and that's it and this is it I mean it's like it's 11 24 and the next five minutes we can either

[01:13:15] bury this hatchet move on or that's it he's at work now maybe that's why okay well that makes

[01:13:26] sense we'll just say that just say that brother like if that's the case if you can only see the chat

[01:13:37] I don't know but he this is pinballed as finest

[01:13:46] there you guys funny it's like you know it's funny it's like there's not there's only so much

[01:13:53] pinball content you can do before you end up in the ultimate area of diminishing return I mean

[01:14:00] franchise you notice it's better than anybody the most the best produced show ever

[01:14:04] I mean I don't get it see what you know I don't get though is like and then you know I'm gonna

[01:14:18] end the show and go enjoy my Saturday is like you know jeng is jeng is and you can hear me and

[01:14:22] you're responding jeng is like jeng is has has jeng is his witness this last 20 minutes of interaction

[01:14:32] and yet for some reason he thinks that I'm incorrectly behaving when I'm like if you're gonna come

[01:14:45] into you know into my show and hang out like interact normally and it's like I don't I don't do

[01:14:56] that to other people I don't I wouldn't want other people to do that I just just be cool

[01:15:02] but to ignore someone which is like is happening I think is rude because I don't

[01:15:10] understand so he's not least just watching the chat it's just making sense to me nothing any sense

[01:15:23] so it was fake us out that last week Ralph and you made up um yeah you know

[01:15:32] it's unfortunate to report that all efforts to to make amends with retro Ralph have have failed

[01:15:40] all of kale hernandez's efforts to reach out to him have failed

[01:15:50] oh yeah no kelly I agree I agree I'm not um I'm not I'm not doing this again because

[01:15:59] it is it's like it's an effort to disrupt my show and my my content to then promote

[01:16:08] their content and you know of course I let it happen you know because it's happening live because I

[01:16:13] can't I don't know what's about to happen and I actually think I actually think Don would like be a

[01:16:18] better man and actually like nope he doesn't care he's just here he doesn't he he doesn't care he

[01:16:24] hates my guts and that's gonna be that and he's gonna he loves doing this and he loves you know

[01:16:31] so I'm just not gonna let this happen again so that's that's that so it happened today it was live

[01:16:37] if you want to look very easy if you want to come on the kineas live be be a participant be a member

[01:16:45] of this community hundred percent but if you come in here and you don't want to do that and then

[01:16:52] you want to make you know that's not gonna happen so that's it it's cool look I don't gang I actually

[01:16:58] I actually don't care because in the end you know we're having fun at everybody that wants to like

[01:17:05] do this just loses access to it I mean that's how it goes that's how it goes

[01:17:12] retro Ralph made it clear he's not making up yeah oh I know I know I know I know I know I know I know

[01:17:18] I mean it is what it is gang it's like you know life is very short I just lost my sister in law to

[01:17:23] cancer I um I've lost too many friends at two early of ages to put up with pinball drama I don't

[01:17:32] care I have a beautiful family beautiful life it's fine it's fine I I think like the inability though

[01:17:40] to move on from things in pinball like that's the thing to it's like I get it if it's like

[01:17:48] you know if if like if you were in the Middle East and someone or a family if you had someone who

[01:17:57] died in a war because that another country like killed them I understand how you could probably

[01:18:06] never move on from that and you never probably would nor should you maybe right

[01:18:11] right but when feelings get hurt in the world of pinball content feel like you do men men's feelings right

[01:18:20] the inability to move on is absolutely crazy it's absolutely crazy and my feelings have been hurt

[01:18:26] and I've heard feelings you know but it is it's freaking pinball machines gang

[01:18:31] hmm look the the masses of the universe artwork look really good I guess that was the American

[01:18:43] pinball treatment that never got green lit message retracted all right everybody here's the deal

[01:18:54] we're out on 90 minute more this has been a fun show this show has been gone all over the place

[01:18:59] you know and you know in the end well look I think masses of universe yeah like to me masses of

[01:19:09] universe is a 800 to a thousand unit but peak masterpiece it's stern can't do it stern

[01:19:17] the volume stern needs I mean look I mean even as I say it I'd rather have masses of the universe

[01:19:23] than John Wick or masses the universe than um venom so that's the hard part

[01:19:31] Ian's in the house and what's up brother in you know I heard you're like aren't you like

[01:19:38] now working with like Colin now is that true Ian the bad boy nudge magazine is that it might

[01:19:44] make that up that like you're now with Colin and the canadases is that is that rumor true

[01:19:50] because I heard that from somebody I was like no way no way Ian the bad boy down with the underground

[01:19:59] okay good no that okay I I I was like who told me that I was like there's no way

[01:20:10] are you working with retro Ralph are you working with anyone new Ian because I someone tried to

[01:20:14] tell me like I'm like there's no way Ian you know it is

[01:20:23] stern he sells so many yeah I look I don't know what stern does

[01:20:29] yeah just hot models and cool rays that's what I thought all right that's funny um

[01:20:35] all right look Ryan Ryan

[01:20:38] it's okay Don is not blocked from here Don is not banned from here um so that is he knows that

[01:20:48] the only reason I put the 10s 10 minute on is people told me it was a troll account and then

[01:20:53] that's the only reason so like I don't I don't know I don't know who's who it's just a bunch of names

[01:21:00] and you can make up names you know when I went to sign up for the first time for insider connected

[01:21:05] someone took canator right away I got like whatever like cool like block me from my own

[01:21:13] ability to identify myself I think a stern Wednesday would crush no I don't I'll tell you why it

[01:21:22] wouldn't because even like Wednesday coming back like it just it was like when sweet game came back

[01:21:28] it came back this week I just don't I don't know like people don't

[01:21:31] don't these things I don't I don't know if they have long lasting power like they're exciting

[01:21:38] to get this stuff when it first hits but does it have long lasting I don't know

[01:21:47] yeah Kelly down you know it's nice so right he's not listening but he's texting but he's slammed

[01:21:55] oh it is what it is it is what it is no it's fine we look we're all talking to the same people

[01:22:07] that you know what I'm saying like no one's like ah you know like we have a very small

[01:22:12] community and and it is it is a community that I love it is a community that is not going to

[01:22:18] grow further and I think too like when people try to like expand their reach and do more like to

[01:22:24] get more audience it like we've all like just kind of we've all sort of flatlined a little bit at our

[01:22:30] subscriber bases at our viewership numbers and you know there's no where left to go I was in a

[01:22:38] room yesterday with a supreme magic girl and mafia really put my life into perspective oh geez

[01:22:46] that's a terrible room to be in um everybody look have a happy Saturday Don you have a happy

[01:22:52] Saturday can't listen at work thank you for doing the medical practice and helping people

[01:23:00] jeng is baby steps short whatever no one's blocked um enjoy the weather enjoy your families we're

[01:23:22] I don't know what that means or look slight for next week's show okay so like I I think Brenda's

[01:23:30] cousin might come over and give me some air cover to do this show but it might not happen okay

[01:23:37] that's that's the only thing I want everybody know um I don't know how I'm gonna handle two kids

[01:23:42] for seven days straight I was like what are they eating like what what's happening here

[01:23:46] the house party um I also want to say that I might be getting a jaws 50th anniversary

[01:23:55] on loan from someone who has one and I'm gonna try to see if I can move the neogeos up into the

[01:24:03] second bedroom and use the garage as a place to put the machine I just the one question I have for

[01:24:11] people here is it okay to put a pinball machine in a non-temperature controlled garage is that

[01:24:17] something I should worry about is the summer heat gonna mess it up is the winter cold gonna just

[01:24:22] like what is that is that a thing like that's okay like what anyone do that like let me know because

[01:24:29] I don't know and I don't want to like get a machine on loan and then it like the dust

[01:24:37] get humidifiers it's I love it there's like dust get humidifiers it's fine it's a bad idea
