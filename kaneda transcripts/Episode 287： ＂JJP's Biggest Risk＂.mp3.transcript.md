[00:00] Ever now and then I fall apart

[00:02] Turn around, run

[00:04] You're fucking every now and then I fall apart

[00:08] And I need you now tonight

[00:10] I fucking need you more than it looks

[00:20] Welcome to the first episode in which

[00:24] Canadian Your Host is a married man

[00:26] This past weekend I had the incredible pleasure

[00:28] of marrying my wife Brenda

[00:32] who is incredible

[00:34] She planned the most amazing wedding

[00:36] And it was so much fun

[00:38] It was so much fun

[00:40] I am so happy to be on this journey of life with her

[00:44] Alright?

[00:46] Now during the wedding you make vows

[00:48] You say to the person across from you

[00:52] What you promise them moving forward in life

[00:56] And I thought it only fitting

[00:58] In episode 287 of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[01:02] That I give you the listener some vows between me and you

[01:06] Alright?

[01:08] So those of you out there, I vow

[01:10] To never do a podcast that is two hours long ever again

[01:16] If I have ever done one, I'm sorry

[01:18] Alright? I vow to never be a shield for any Pimball company

[01:22] I vow to never buy an October Fest

[01:26] Unless it's the month of October

[01:30] Alright? I vow

[01:32] Alright? I vow to never ever ever

[01:36] Buy a Beatles Diamond Edition Machine

[01:38] And I ultimately vow to all of you out there

[01:42] That it will always be the one Pimball Podcast

[01:46] That tries to get to the truth of this entire hobby

[01:48] Right?

[01:50] This is a blessing gameplay and tournaments and manufacturers

[01:54] But the truth of what it means to be a Pimball hobbyist

[01:58] And I have to say, whenever you sort of turn off

[02:02] Pinside for a week

[02:04] And you start to reengage the real world

[02:06] It puts everything in a really interesting perspective

[02:10] We'll talk a little bit about that on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast

[02:14] But of course, in just being gone a week

[02:16] Stuff happened in the Pimball world that we have to cover

[02:18] Is we're going to do the news, we're going to go over what's developed

[02:22] And a lot has developed in just a week

[02:24] I'm going to go over some of your feedback

[02:26] And then I'm going to leave you with some final thoughts on the Pimball hobby

[02:30] How does that sound? Alright? Let's jump right into it

[02:34] So the two biggest news stories

[02:36] Were the Monsters leak

[02:38] And of course, deep root Pimball

[02:42] Not coming to T-PF this year

[02:44] Let me go in that order

[02:46] Because I think it's

[02:48] I want to talk more about deep root than I do about the Monsters leak

[02:52] So by now

[02:54] You either have been living under a rock

[02:58] Or you've seen the Monsters Pimball Machine leak that happened last week

[03:04] And look, I think at this point

[03:06] We're sort of used to just

[03:08] It's a question of when

[03:10] Will a Pimball Machine

[03:12] That has either

[03:14] Franchi or Zambietti on it

[03:16] It's a question of when will their stuff leak

[03:20] And not a question of if it will leak

[03:24] Alright? And so if you ask yourself

[03:26] Why don't the other Stern Pimball Games leak before they're ready?

[03:32] It's pretty clear where this stuff is coming from

[03:36] They've got some very enthusiastic artist out there

[03:40] That I've probably shared stuff

[03:42] And I'm here to tell you I did not leak

[03:44] Any of these Monsters images that you just saw last week

[03:48] And we didn't see it a ton

[03:50] But we did, right?

[03:52] We saw the Playfield artwork

[03:54] We did not see a fully populated playfield

[03:58] It is the Pro Machine

[04:00] It is not the earlier premium that will have the lower playfield

[04:04] And I have to say look

[04:06] When you look at the game

[04:08] It's got

[04:10] Sort of a somewhat similar layout to Monster Bash people are saying

[04:14] I have to say this though

[04:16] I have to say this and this is just me speaking candidly

[04:20] I'm no longer just blown away anymore

[04:22] I don't know what it is

[04:24] These games come out

[04:26] And especially Stern Games

[04:28] I think Stern has really built an empire on hype

[04:34] And everyone is always expecting so much in these games

[04:38] But I'm at the point now where

[04:40] It's always sort of the same kind of art style

[04:44] It's always the sort of you know

[04:46] A Stern's a Stern is a Stern

[04:48] I always say that people

[04:50] And I'm not saying it like it's a terrible thing

[04:52] I'm just saying I get the same sort of excitement

[04:56] When I see a new Stern Pimball Machine

[04:58] As I do when I see like the next version

[05:02] Of a 9-11 Porsche

[05:04] Right? It's just like

[05:06] You know what it's going to be

[05:08] You kind of know what it's going to look like

[05:10] And there's never

[05:12] Anything that completely blows you away

[05:14] There's never anything that's completely unexpected

[05:18] Or disruptive

[05:20] Or really feels like it's pushing the envelope

[05:22] It feels just more like a slight evolution

[05:26] Of what came before

[05:28] Nothing feels like a revolution

[05:30] A revolutionary new thing

[05:32] Right? And so that being said

[05:34] I'm curious to see when we actually get more of the monsters

[05:38] But this is it

[05:40] I mean other than a lower play field

[05:42] And some bash toys

[05:44] And some stuff like that

[05:46] I think we now know

[05:48] What the monster's Pimball is going to be

[05:50] And you know it's going to be hard for Stern to completely

[05:54] Sort of reveal it now

[05:56] That this leak occurred

[05:58] But you know it's going to be what it is

[06:00] I mean I'm just again

[06:02] I'm just having a hard time

[06:04] With each new Stern machine

[06:06] Falling victim to the hype

[06:08] And I feel good

[06:10] Like I feel really good

[06:12] To not feel like I have to have every new Stern machine

[06:16] Regardless of what they show

[06:18] And it's very liberating

[06:20] To sort of adopt a mindset of

[06:24] It's interesting look

[06:26] You know, Franchie

[06:28] Crushed it on the artwork

[06:30] I'm not sure what's going to happen with the art package

[06:34] If there's a lower play field

[06:36] Because that seems like it's going to eat up most of where the characters are in the middle of the play field

[06:40] And I don't like stickers on ramps

[06:42] I don't know if that's going to change

[06:44] But you know I just

[06:46] I'm not seeing anything here

[06:48] That is just like

[06:50] Oh my god take my money now

[06:52] And that's just

[06:54] You know that's where I'm at with it

[06:56] But again I haven't seen so much of it

[06:58] So we'll see but I'm just saying a little bit

[07:00] Of the magic

[07:02] Will be gone when the reveal happens

[07:04] Because we have seen this much of it so far

[07:06] Alright

[07:08] But that's not the big news

[07:10] You know whether we see monsters in a couple weeks or in January

[07:12] I definitely think we're going to see this game before tpf

[07:16] But the big news that happened

[07:18] Was deep root pinball

[07:20] Announced that they will not

[07:22] Be going to Texas pinball festival

[07:24] I want to talk about this for a while

[07:26] Because

[07:28] Deep root pinball has

[07:30] Become

[07:32] A sort of mysterious player in the pinball hobby

[07:34] And again unless you've been living under a rock

[07:38] You are fully aware of what deep root pinball is trying to do

[07:42] And we heard from Robert Mueller at Expo

[07:46] Very ambitious plans

[07:48] On what he wanted to do with the company

[07:50] Right everything from innovation

[07:52] Things you've never seen before in pinball

[07:54] Wants to manufacture more games in one year

[07:58] Than all manufacturers combined

[08:00] They've secured an 80s license

[08:02] Right maybe more than one

[08:04] They've got all these historic designers on board

[08:08] They've got Steve Boud

[08:10] And they've got animators

[08:12] They've got story tellers

[08:14] You know they've got everything going

[08:16] Except for one thing

[08:18] They don't have a game

[08:20] We haven't seen anything

[08:22] You know all we know

[08:24] Is what we've been told

[08:26] But we haven't seen anything

[08:28] And I want to go into this development

[08:30] About them postponing their launch

[08:32] And so

[08:34] Here's the statement from deep root

[08:36] It goes

[08:38] Like this

[08:40] During a leadership meeting on December 3rd

[08:42] It became clear that all necessary deliverables

[08:44] Would not be ready in time for our reveal at Texas Pimball festival

[08:48] Rather than rush

[08:50] With little tested innovations

[08:52] Fail to deliver what was

[08:54] Promise or lower the level of expectation we have for ourselves

[08:58] We decided to postpone their reveal

[09:00] While we are not going to reveal at T-P-F

[09:04] We chose to support the T-P-F experience

[09:06] By keeping our sizable monetary investment in tact

[09:10] We thank Ed and team for rolling out the red carpet for us

[09:14] We are grateful for their support

[09:16] And we would urge everyone to attend

[09:18] What will be another amazing Pimball experience next March

[09:22] Alright

[09:24] What I want to do is go through each of these statements from deep root

[09:28] So right there

[09:30] Deep root polling out of T-P-F is a bummer

[09:32] I mean there's no way around it

[09:34] I've been saying

[09:36] This is going to be the best T-P-F ever

[09:38] It's all about the things that will happen at the show

[09:42] And I think most of us were really looking forward to seeing what deep root was all about

[09:48] All the hyperbole, all the adjectives, all the expectations

[09:52] The five days of deep root coming at T-P-F 2019

[09:56] I mean there were ads for it at T-P-F 2018

[10:00] There were ads for it at Expo

[10:04] And now nothing

[10:06] Alright, so what does that mean?

[10:08] We'll talk about it as we go deeper into why they're not going to be there

[10:12] So let's go on to more from deep root here

[10:16] They go on to interview Robert Mueller

[10:18] Alright

[10:20] So this week in Pimball they asked for the reason for the delay

[10:24] And Robert said we aren't worried about spin or marketing anything positive or negative

[10:28] It is very simple

[10:30] I owe it to my staff

[10:32] That the blood, sweat and tears

[10:34] In parentheses, innovations

[10:36] We have expended

[10:38] We'll be showcased and delivered to the public in the best possible way

[10:42] That includes extra stress and cycle testing of new innovations

[10:46] Using additional time making sure launch titles are code

[10:50] And AV complete

[10:52] Increasing the durability of the play field

[10:54] And improving play field assembly process efficiencies

[10:58] Lastly, I promise future customers that we will ship in two weeks of a sale being made

[11:04] We will simply not reveal anything before being able to keep the promise by promptly shipping games after a reveal

[11:10] Alright, so let's stop there

[11:14] Because we've said it before

[11:16] There's just no way two weeks is going to work

[11:20] On everyone's going to get their game in two weeks after a reveal

[11:24] Alright, because what that means is that you're going to have to have a lot of games

[11:30] In boxes, in a warehouse, ready to go into a truck on the day you reveal

[11:38] Alright, that's really difficult to do for a few reasons

[11:42] Right, so one is

[11:44] How are they selling these games?

[11:48] Are they selling them through distributors?

[11:50] Are they selling them directly to customers?

[11:52] How do they know how many of these games to build in order to get all those people their games in two weeks?

[12:00] So let's say they showcase back to the future

[12:04] How many orders are they going to get for that one game?

[12:08] Right, and everyone's going to get their game within two weeks

[12:10] So it's stuff like this that I, again, I don't think it's necessary to make a promise like that

[12:16] I don't even think anyone you buy is pinball machines expects to get them that way

[12:20] Expect to get them that quickly

[12:24] If I were to give Robert some advice on this one, it's I think anyone who buys a pinball machine in 2019

[12:30] Really just expects to get it within two months of buying it

[12:35] Right, they don't need it in two weeks, there's no rush

[12:38] In fact, as we see with some other manufacturers, I think people want to wait to some of the kinks get figured out before they even get their game

[12:46] So there's no real desire to have a game that quickly out the door

[12:52] It's just that simple

[12:54] The durability of the play field wasn't just the play field that you could take a sledgehammer to

[13:00] So have they been sledgehammering the play field and they're not holding up to what they expect?

[13:06] I don't know, all right, so then the interview goes on to say this

[13:10] In your goodwill terms, this is the question, you had a deadline of June 30th, 2019, for Zidware customers to get their deeproot games

[13:20] Will deeproot meet that deadline?

[13:22] And Robert said, our legal commitments to the small percentage of Zidware customers that both filed and perfected a claim will remain unchanged

[13:34] And this week in Pimbal says that does that mean that Zidware customers may get a deeproot Pimbal machine before your official launch

[13:42] And Robert said, it is possible but hard to predict exactly what will happen in six months' time

[13:50] All right, there's a little bit more I'll go into but I want to stop there, so look, this is another deadline

[13:55] This is another deadline that deeproot has to hit legally

[14:00] And this is so weird to me too because again, the only reason they have to meet this June 30th deadline to make the Zidware customers whole is because deeproot set the deadline

[14:14] Nobody else did, they did and they didn't have to work with John Papaduke, they didn't have to take him on board

[14:20] So they're the ones who need to fulfill this date now

[14:23] Let's count on our hand the amount of time between now and then

[14:27] Like it's pretty much beginning of December, December, January, February, March, April, May, June

[14:35] So they've got what? Around seven, end of June, so they got like seven full months to figure this out

[14:44] That's a long time, right? I mean, here we were fully expecting to be blown away by deeproot

[14:51] You know, in like three months and now all of a sudden it's seven months is really the earliest that they have to really give someone something

[15:04] All right, and then they go on to say, you know, what, this is the question, what are the biggest hurdles you have to get passed before launch

[15:12] Robert said staffing, it has been very difficult getting qualified candidates in Texas and Utah that will fill our pipeline

[15:21] This question is interesting, do you still plan to launch in 2019?

[15:25] He says, we will launch when we are ready, I certainly hope it's in 2019

[15:30] Is there any concern that deeproot that the launch may never happen?

[15:35] Robin said zero concern, this is interesting, we are spending over 750,000 a month on this project and that will increase through launch

[15:46] That is unsustainable without a launch in the short term

[15:50] All right, so here's the thing, I don't think any of these other questions really matter

[15:56] I think that's the main takeaway from this whole interview is that they are not coming to TPS, they are spending 750,000 a month

[16:05] And that, you know, they are going to get your zidware customers by June 30th and they are hopeful that 2019 is the year

[16:14] Now, I want to give you my opinion about this whole thing

[16:19] And I mean this when I say this, is I am kind of just sick and tired of these games, like what's the point of all of this?

[16:31] I think the only thing deeproot needs to do is make one or two good games a year to really break into the pinball industry

[16:41] Now, they might be further ahead on a lot more titles and that's great, that's great, but those should be 2020 titles

[16:49] There is no need for them to try and do so much at once

[16:54] And now, they are not even going to deliver anything at TPS, so then the question becomes when?

[17:03] And now the new date seems to be June 30th

[17:08] And you know, look, I think Robert understands that it doesn't really matter if they reveal that a show or not

[17:16] And again, I think there's a lot of emphasis that you have to like go to a show to get in front of the pinball collector and be at TPS or be at expo or be at pinburg

[17:28] Or you know, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter

[17:31] Almost everyone who really buys these pinball machines and collects them, you know, most of those people have access to the internet

[17:41] The challenge for Robert is going to be a combination of two things

[17:44] He needs to get his games out at some point, right?

[17:48] He also needs to market these games in a way that gets people excited and gets people on board to buy them

[17:56] And ultimately he's going to have to figure out a distributor model in which people can go and play these games

[18:02] Because most likely people are not going to buy something with only seeing a video of it

[18:08] You know, unless he's got themes like back to the future and whatnot

[18:12] Do I think that he's spending $750,000 a month on deep-rooted pinball? Absolutely not

[18:19] I think that number is made up, I think it makes them look good, you know, it makes it look like there's so much money going into it at this stage

[18:29] But that's a bullshit number, right? It's bullshit. There's no way they're spending that much this early on to get this stuff off the ground

[18:39] I think it's a very impressive number, it makes people even more curious, it makes people feel like there's a lot going on

[18:47] And that the end product is going to justify everything that went into it

[18:53] But I think the number is really kind of silly, I wouldn't believe it, I just wouldn't believe that at all

[18:59] And my final takeaways, I think Robert is playing a game, I think he's playing a game with me, with podcasts, with this week in pinball, I do

[19:11] I think he's playing a game and I think he wants, I think this is my metaphor for what I think he's doing

[19:17] I think Robert's like the kid who's got the answers to the test and he tells all of his friends that he's not going to study

[19:27] And this friends think that person's going to fail and then they do great

[19:31] I think that's where he's at

[19:34] I think Robert knows that he's got a lot of fun stuff in the factory

[19:38] I think he knows he's got a lot of innovations coming that are going to blow people away

[19:43] I think he's going to run into manufacturing hurdles, so I do

[19:48] I think he's going to run into distribution hurdles and vendor and part hurdles

[19:52] But I think he is probably further along than he wants you to think maybe, I don't know

[19:59] And then it's going to be like boom out of nowhere like DeepRoo just arrives like an alien invasion and takes over the pinball world

[20:06] And it didn't make sense to come to TPS for him because that's just what's expected

[20:11] So if you look at a company that's trying to disrupt and be unlike every other company

[20:17] then I think he's trying to play and or figure out how to play the game that way

[20:22] But I also don't know if that's the smartest way to market in pinball

[20:27] I don't think pinball needs a lot of that sort of like trying too hard to be clever

[20:32] I think you really just need to make a great pinball machine and make it available

[20:36] And people will buy it

[20:38] I don't think it requires a lot of this like overly strategizing or overhyping

[20:44] Or over promising and I think that's where he's going to get himself into trouble

[20:51] Just one game and if I had some advice just come to TPS with something innovative

[20:56] Show us the goddamn ball levitator that you did for Magic Girl

[21:02] And just at least satiate some of people's curiosity around your company

[21:07] But again, he now it's like I don't really know what to do in terms of deep roof coverage between now and June

[21:15] We might not hear anything, we might hear something

[21:18] But now we're just probably going to put them into like the pending column of

[21:24] We'll just have to wait and see which is kind of where they've always been

[21:29] Alright?

[21:30] Well, you know a company you don't have to wait and see and that's Stern pinball and they're starting to ship

[21:36] Beatles diamond additions I just saw an image of Sunshine laundromat in Brooklyn

[21:42] Has a diamond addition Beatles pinball here's what's fucking crazy

[21:45] Peter over there the owner of Sunshine he's going to put the diamond addition probably out to play at Sunshine

[21:54] And you know what he also doesn't do he doesn't like mylar the play field

[21:58] He doesn't put a shooter lane protector on there so he's a stencil be going to put a pinball machine that's selling or you know

[22:06] Asking for $25,000 on the show floor

[22:11] Now here's what I love about living in New York City is now I will not have to spend a single dollar buying a Beatles pinball machine

[22:21] I can take a $2.75 subway ride and go play Beatles all night long see if I like it or not and then go home

[22:32] And and and that's probably what I will do in the next week or so

[22:37] Well, there's nothing about the diamond addition experience that will be different than the gold addition experience

[22:42] But the games are shipping so we have to give Stern kudos for getting the games out

[22:48] All right, I'm glad to see their inboxes speaking of games like where are they where is Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle like where is it?

[22:56] Is it is it like this is gotta be one of the longest delays ever for a spooky game

[23:04] Now what's helping chuck out is that Stern doesn't have monsters available yet

[23:11] Monster Bash remake is shipping and getting to people up

[23:14] I don't think the Elise have shipped yet, but I'll say this there's not gonna be people wanting to wait a year plus to get their game

[23:24] And I don't know I literally don't know

[23:27] What the hold up is and maybe it's still just finishing up TNA that's the hold up

[23:33] But I also think you know when we talk about showing a game and shipping it in a short window

[23:39] I think we can all pretty much say that that Chuck kind of fumbled this one in the sense of he showed it over eight months ago

[23:47] And people still don't have their games and I think that's just like you know it's a mistake

[23:51] It's a mistake that a lot of people are making in Pimball for some reason

[23:54] Speaking of shipping late pirates the Caribbean is finally arriving for customers

[24:02] Finally it is getting into homes and you know I'm following the thread I go in it like every other day

[24:11] And I see images of broken wires and switches not working and so I you know like I don't know if this game has more issues than other games when they're new in box

[24:23] But I do feel like the pirates of the Caribbean owners club looks more like a troubleshooting club

[24:30] And I don't know I hope they iron out all the issues that that's that's the thing

[24:37] You people just should not have to like solder anything all right if there's one thing I hate having to do on any game

[24:45] It's pull out the soldering iron to get a wire working again or reattach it

[24:52] All right because I'll tell you this most collectors and this is the truth they don't know how to solder

[24:59] They don't want to solder their games that are brand new

[25:02] And I think a lot of people are probably just watching this one on the sideline like hoping they get some of these issues ironed out

[25:09] It's a little bit frustrating you know you wish they would have had it figured out by now but they haven't

[25:15] All right they haven't now the question now becomes with deep root leaving tpf will they be able to get a marquee title revealed at the show will it be something from Jersey Jack Pimbal

[25:29] I don't know I can't imagine it will be I think Jack has to sell more pirates the Caribbean's before he shows his next title

[25:37] Because if it's wonka or toy story pirates the Caribbean's sales will just plummet immediately

[25:44] It that's Jack's problem you know it's Jack's problem it's not like stern where the game just remains in the line for years

[25:52] And there's you know really the only pins that stern really needs to sell out immediately of are the LEDs and stern does a really good job of selling the majority

[26:02] If not all of their LEDs right away and then they don't have to worry about the premium and the pros because they can make them for years

[26:11] And they have an assembly line in which those games can remain in production for years to buy right we're still seeing games from years ago

[26:21] Metallica star trek still for sale still for sale today brand new games made off the line a few weeks ago

[26:30] Alright incredible right alright what else is going on in the pinball world before I get to some of your user feedback

[26:36] The team pinball team pinball have announced that they're only going to make 20 additions of the mafia pinball machine 20

[26:49] Right going to be one of the rarest games of all time and yet there are roughly 9 billion people on planet earth

[26:58] And there aren't there are not even 20 people who want that machine out of the 9 billion so I think it's time that these guys just sort of pack the bags

[27:11] Close the boxes it's over all right it's over I mean yeah I don't you know I can't imagine they're going to get a return on their investment

[27:21] But they should have done their market research before they made this game alright it's just it's just a game that nobody really wants

[27:29] And nothing could could be more indicative of that that you can't even sell 20 of something like if you make a pinball company

[27:38] And you reveal your game to the world and you can't sell 20 it's over it's completely over all right all right October fest

[27:48] Alright so we we we saw that there was some like new back glass that had like two characters covering up the monkey

[27:56] That was just sort of like a prototype back glass they they haven't fixed the artwork yet

[28:05] They're still selling this game while they're making changes

[28:11] What do you think about that I mean I talked about that a little bit but personally I do have a problem with that

[28:18] Of actually making like changes to the artwork changes possibly to some of the design of the game without letting the customer know what those final changes will be

[28:31] They are taking your money on it now look I know you're saying to me like Chris don't be a hypocrite because Stern sells people a game

[28:39] And there's absolutely no code in it and they're still putting new stuff into the game after you buy it but that's different than like swapping the artwork or you know making some gameplay changes that people haven't seen yet

[28:55] I think for October fest it's very much like Houdini it's it's it's down to the point of like you have to play one you have to decide for yourself if you want one

[29:04] There are not a limited number of October fest being made so there absolutely is no rush to buy one

[29:12] If you ask me I think that is a marketing mistake for these guys if if I could give Dovel or normal any advice it would be this

[29:21] If I were them I would say we are only going to make 500 of our titles ever

[29:31] I think these guys need to create some sort of demand and urgency to buy these titles because without that I just can't see these games being very successful

[29:45] And I was even seeing them tease the fact that they might hint at what game number three is and I'm just going to say this bluntly

[29:54] I just don't think American Pimball is going to survive very long if the only thing we get from this company consists of Joe Balls are on design Scott Kugler or Josh Kugler on you know animations and code

[30:12] And whatever artists are using who put this monstrosity together I just don't see this company like it's like why is it just this little funky bunch is the only thing we're ever going to get from American Pimball

[30:26] And I think they've shown us that they can make a solid game like they can actually manufacture a game that's screwed together well

[30:35] But what this company lacks right now is a creative direction they lack a creative visionary and I just think it looks home brew

[30:46] I think they've got they're almost there but the pieces that are falling behind are really important pieces to get right and we said it before

[30:58] I think they need to hire someone who does animations and this is not you know this is not me you know blasting Josh Kugler Kugler is the coder

[31:08] He should not be responsible for animations he shouldn't be and I think he's doing the animations and that's why I think they're so pissed poor

[31:17] And I don't know whoever was the person who directed the artist but they need to get a creative director because that game looks terrible

[31:26] With three different kinds of art slapped together in that format it just looks like shit I'm just going to say it looks like shit

[31:34] And there's no reason why it should so fix those things fix fix it right and now once you've got new teammates don't don't hit game three

[31:47] Is there going to be a game three of October Fest is a total flop how can there be how can there be like I said these guys need to go get the big Lebowski tomorrow

[31:57] All right what else is going on in Pimble you know that's kind of it there hasn't been too much new news there was a Beatles for sale on Facebook for 30 thousand dollars

[32:10] And I wrote in the post and I'm not one to price police but when you ask 30 thousand dollars for the Beatles diamond edition

[32:19] All right then you know I think I should troll a post like that and I basically said in the comment section for 30 thousand dollars john lenin should do the callouts for this game

[32:34] And for 30 thousand dollars if you buy it john lenin will demagnetize your balls and not the ones that go into the pinball machine

[32:44] All right insanity people insanity it's just a fucking cheap plaque all right so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read some of your emails that I received I'm also going to play someone sent me in an audio file I love the audio feedback that people send me in my you know canada pinball at gmail.com

[33:06] I think I might have to set up a 1-800 number where people can call in and leave voicemails for me and I can air those but let me play you something that someone sent me no I haven't listened to this let's see if it's not too long and I'm going to give my opinion of it after the fact

[33:21] Canada is planned to end of your most recent pod for the family just because I was I was touched I got a little emotional via where you were expressing your love for the hobby into every one of your listeners and even the ones that hate you you were sending out love and my son upon you wrapping it up just simply said

[33:43] pinball Jesus and I think that kind of sums that for all of us in the hobby you would become our pinball Jesus thank you for that God bless well God bless us all if canada is the pinball podcast of the pinball world but look Nelson thank you for sending that note and I don't consider myself any sort of day it in this hobby I think what I just try to do is I try to just remind people

[34:13] you know that you got to find some truth in this hobby don't don't place too much ambitious on this hobby in your lives and yes you should show love and respect other people in the hobby that's just the way it should be all right all right I got another I got two more listeners who sent me audio files let's air another one you've been releasing podcasts so fast I can't keep up with them and leave any comments by the time I record something get ready to send it in you're on to the next pod

[34:42] podcast and I'm in throught and then I forget what I was going to say so I'm going to try to do a quick little recap here the last couple podcast episodes just some thoughts that I had on them. First of all you and Blake doing the awards is pretty nice nice you guys have a great banter back and forth these sounds like a great guy has a nice voice for this kind of medium I like how you guys dissected things pulled supreme out of some of the categories they really need to tighten them down and actually just nominate people are at least have nominees if you will then actually make sense rather than just putting in every part of the game.

[35:12] Pinball machine released every year but it was fun listening to you guys you guys made some great points here at some people let me tell you when I was listening to the podcast we

[35:21] with gentleman's name was Nick who was talking about the pinball machines that he was making and trying to contract with Stern as soon as he started breaking down the price my ears perked up a little bit and I was like oh this is interesting

[35:33] the phone podcast when you are like oh I broke out this we talked for two hours and I broke out this 12 second segment and here it is I'm going to talk about it for a while

[35:42] as I go man Nick's going to get a call from somebody about this I mean it's it's good and it's bad I mean you can definitely see how celebrities get misquoted and stuff I have stuff pulled out

[35:52] the due talk to you for two hours it's like this 10 second blurb is what gets all the attention and he was almost thinking out loud kind of explaining the mechanisms and

[36:01] probably didn't realize what he was saying until you heard the podcast and then you ripped it out I knew that was going to get pulled back with good on you for pulling it down at his

[36:08] request I mean a tough situation all around the newest one breaking down the costs and everything fantastic I mean you go into a dollar shop

[36:17] you know those things cost 14 cents they sell for a dollar I mean the markups huge pinball machines though

[36:24] and it's kind of a novelty thing but Stern has to balance that they really have to they have to make a profit but they got to feel like they're given

[36:30] a customer has to feel like he's getting value and that's a tough thing the judge especially when they do the contract work because again it's still stern

[36:36] and the names are on it and the layouts are sterns and you know the mechanisms are sterns so even though it's contract it's still representative of the company

[36:44] I mean if they contracted out with some horrible thing machine with a horrible eight year old graphics and it didn't work right

[36:52] that that nobody cares if they contract it out through you know some national ampune this was a gag thing or what's it cards against humanity

[37:00] if they contracted out 10 pinball machines that absolutely played like shit and refused to work at the end of the day it's still going to be stern

[37:06] taking the heat for that so you know it is contract work you know there is stern involved and they are the face of the manufacturer

[37:13] but having said that I mean I love the absolute comment when your viewers wrote in with the pin side circle jerk

[37:22] love it I don't know if you're old enough to remember the circle jerks the band punk band back in the early 80s

[37:28] I would love to see a nice custom pinball t-shirt with the circle jerks logo but the guy's kind of has a pinball machine

[37:36] uh... he's playing it at the time because i you feel that way sometimes going on to forms

[37:40] that's how it is on every form you know the fans comic books uh... movies they're all insane they get passionate about it

[37:47] but i love how you're breaking it down i love how uh... like you said you're not here for pinball tips you're not talking about how to

[37:53] score you know ten billion points on ghost busters on the plunge you're talking about the collectability the business aspect and that's what keeps you fresh and unique so keep it up but thanks

[38:03] alright well thank you math you for writing in no not writing in for sending me an audio file of your feedback on the last few shows and so

[38:11] look it was fun going back and forth with Blake uh... you know talking about the torpes the worst in pinball

[38:17] uh... like a lot of you out there who heard the interview with nick park so think we were all a little shocked but not

[38:24] totally shocked by learning

[38:27] what these sort of wholesale prices for stern games

[38:31] and and look i've said it before

[38:34] you know stern pro

[38:37] a stern pro is the only good value you get

[38:40] and i think everyone agrees with this you buy a stern pro you get your money's worth

[38:45] you buy a premium or an alley you starting to get fleas you buy an alley you really are getting ripped off you just are

[38:52] they don't want you to feel this way

[38:54] they don't want you to like you know have that emotion they don't want you to deconstruct what you're getting for your nine thousand

[39:00] dollars but if you really do want to deconstruct is the value there it's not

[39:06] and that's their dirty little secret is they create this tiny little window of alley hype

[39:12] and if you simply avoid it you'll be much happier in the hobby right you will be trust me

[39:19] alright

[39:20] alright but you know we respect nick parks as a person and as a business man and so we yanked down and that's all right

[39:27] this podcast is not gone soft i mean even the last things i said the last half hour are they soft

[39:32] um but math you thank you again for listening to the show

[39:35] um i'm glad you appreciate it and i have another audio

[39:41] uh... feedback from another listener let me air that for you now

[39:44] it's it's Dave long time listener of your show i want to

[39:48] call in uh... with two points

[39:51] the first is

[39:52] i bought

[39:53] a batman

[39:54] sixty six

[39:55] le as a result of your show

[39:59] like that's just a fact

[40:00] uh... i was on the fence

[40:02] thinking about for a while

[40:03] but listen to your show

[40:05] uh... for quite some time

[40:07] and i bought one

[40:08] and so you directly influenced me to buy a stern machine

[40:13] like that is a true statement so

[40:16] your point about

[40:17] uh... manufacturers

[40:20] downplaying the influence of the media

[40:23] i do agree that that is a foolish move on their part

[40:26] uh... and i do think

[40:28] the media of which your part

[40:29] uh... have an impact on buying

[40:32] uh... that's just a fact so

[40:34] agree with you on that

[40:36] second

[40:38] my day job is a cio of a midsize company

[40:43] like over thirty million in revenue

[40:46] uh...

[40:47] and as i look at jersey jack

[40:49] and i'm a huge fan jersey jack i i don't know what's like it

[40:55] i am deeply concerned

[40:57] about their viability

[40:59] as a business

[41:01] uh... and i'll tell you why

[41:03] it's related to labor but it's it's slightly different than what people have

[41:07] been talking about recently

[41:11] i don't think it's a problem that jack uses contract labor

[41:16] in fact i think the opposite is true i think

[41:19] as a responsible cio

[41:22] uh... jack has a business where his labor needs

[41:26] will fluctuate

[41:27] right if he has a hit game

[41:29] he's gonna need more machines built then if he has a flop right and so

[41:36] if you're a cio of that type of company

[41:39] the responsible thing for you to do is to say

[41:43] what is my bare minimum

[41:45] of full-time employees that i need

[41:49] to run the business and that is what i'm going to staff for

[41:53] and then

[41:55] i'm going to bring in contract labor

[41:59] for when

[42:00] i need it right and so if there's like a high degree of demand and machine is

[42:04] really successful

[42:05] i'm going to bring in a bunch of contract labor

[42:08] or things have cooled off or i'm in between

[42:11] games

[42:12] uh... i'm going to ramp that labor down

[42:14] and

[42:15] that is actually what he should be doing

[42:17] like we want jack to be doing that as a cio

[42:21] because it means that the company

[42:23] can be viable

[42:25] and stick around and make more games right and so

[42:29] i think that is what he's doing

[42:31] i don't know but i believe that that is what he's doing

[42:35] uh... and i think it's

[42:36] absolutely the right thing and the responsible thing for him to be doing as a

[42:40] cio like that is not a bad thing

[42:43] but here's the trick

[42:48] i bet

[42:49] he's having a hard time

[42:52] with that contract labor

[42:56] you know if you look at linkedin like you can actually see the full time hires at

[42:59] churchy jack

[43:01] and there's not a lot of labor folks

[43:04] on linkedin and so

[43:06] my hunch and i'm totally making this up i don't know anything this is pure

[43:11] speculation

[43:13] but my hunch is that jack said alright

[43:16] i'm in a staff for the bare minimum i need

[43:18] i'm gonna ramp up and down with contract labor

[43:21] but i bet where he went wrong

[43:24] is that

[43:25] he's probably having a very hard time

[43:28] finding that labor

[43:31] it's probably costing him more money

[43:33] and taking more time

[43:35] to ramp up and train that labor

[43:38] and i bet once he's even got them ramped up in train that's very difficult to

[43:43] keep them

[43:45] i mean think about it

[43:46] he's in the state of new jersey

[43:49] one of the most expensive places to live

[43:51] in the nation

[43:53] and he's kind of in a weird town in new jersey which is sort of you know

[43:58] near the seashore

[44:01] and so

[44:03] very expensive state

[44:05] very tight labor market very high labor rates

[44:08] and he's trying to find contract labor

[44:12] skilled contract labor it's not like it's a receptionist right like he need

[44:16] skilled contract labor

[44:18] to kind of come and go

[44:20] when demand rises and falls

[44:23] like that's gonna be a hard thing to staff for

[44:27] then he's got all that time to train people up

[44:31] per machine

[44:33] uh...

[44:34] on how to assemble these things correctly

[44:37] and then he's got a hope that he can keep those folks around

[44:40] at whatever he's paying them like fifteen bucks an hour

[44:44] eighteen bucks to twelve bucks and whatever he's paying them

[44:48] he's got a hope he's can retain those people and they're not going to find a

[44:51] better easier

[44:53] uh...

[44:54] paying job

[44:56] then building labor intensive pinball machine

[44:59] so my hunch

[45:01] and again i'm totally making this up

[45:03] my hunch is that

[45:05] jacks plan was

[45:07] staff for the bare minimum

[45:09] contract labor

[45:11] to sort of go up and down with demand

[45:14] and

[45:16] the problem he's probably having is he can't staff that assembly work

[45:21] it even kind of

[45:23] put a finer point on this uh... i actually drove over

[45:26] to i was in the neighborhood drove over

[45:29] to the jersey jack facility on a Wednesday at like

[45:32] ten in the morning

[45:34] and drove around the building

[45:36] and there were not many cars in that parking lot

[45:39] went to the lobby and i knocked on the door

[45:42] doing came

[45:44] uh... i couldn't really hear much noise coming out of

[45:47] you know the workshop

[45:50] and so my hunch is that

[45:52] labor is jacks

[45:54] greatest risk

[45:55] as a business

[45:57] and it's going to be very interesting to see how this place out with toy story

[46:00] because you're right

[46:02] that i bet is a maker break title

[46:04] for jack

[46:06] and he's got everything lined up

[46:08] to be a success from the theme

[46:10] presumably it's a pat lawler game

[46:12] uh... he's got plenty of time to kind of hit

[46:15] the window for when the movie comes out

[46:18] uh...

[46:19] but if he's building pirate elies

[46:22] when toy story

[46:24] four hits the movie theaters and that hype machine is rolling

[46:29] he will have failed

[46:31] and you know if there's any advice i get jack is the c a fellow cio

[46:36] is i would be in serious talks with american pinball

[46:40] and chicago gaming right now

[46:42] to see if they'd be willing to do some contract assembly

[46:46] on toy story

[46:48] so he nails that window

[46:50] and sure it'll like ruin his profit margin and you know

[46:54] they'll barely break even or maybe even lose a couple of bucks

[46:58] in that scenario

[46:59] and so it's not it's far from ideal

[47:02] but there's a far greater risk

[47:04] of him missing the toy story window

[47:07] then if he said takes a hit on profit

[47:11] for when that movie comes out

[47:13] so

[47:14] you watch like toys are is going to be the point where

[47:17] if those machines are ready

[47:20] then he's got a shot

[47:21] at you know get in a wonka

[47:25] but if he misses that window

[47:26] i honestly think

[47:28] like he will have underestimated his labor risks

[47:33] and ultimately will not have a viable long-term business

[47:37] so

[47:38] just a hunch i hope that's not the case i really want to wonka

[47:41] but anyway

[47:43] great show thanks for letting me ramble congrats on the wedding

[47:48] wow

[47:49] i mean that was probably

[47:52] the most articulate

[47:53] and insightful

[47:55] feedback i've ever received

[47:57] in in the history of the show and i've been doing the show for two hundred and eighty

[48:02] episodes

[48:03] um... so davi thank you

[48:05] for sharing that

[48:07] uh... with not just me with but with the listeners because i think everyone

[48:10] who just listen to all that

[48:12] um... from a from a CEO of a company

[48:15] uh... learned a lot

[48:17] learned a lot about what

[48:18] could be the the big risk happening over at jersey jack pinball

[48:23] and i never really thought about it on on all those different levels

[48:27] and it's interesting because you know as i was listening

[48:31] date you articulate

[48:34] his challenges

[48:37] seeing the same sort of problems already creeping to the door of deep route

[48:42] how do i get people

[48:43] who are highly skilled

[48:45] staffers

[48:47] to come to know to how to hire them to help me make my games

[48:51] right and

[48:52] and i think that has been jacks problem

[48:54] is is

[48:56] is he misses the windows

[48:58] of when people like really should be getting the games that are based upon

[49:02] properties

[49:03] that are hot right now that people want right now

[49:07] uh... the hobbit miss

[49:09] i think we're gonna see him miss toy story when with the summer release of the new movie

[49:14] uh... and i think it does come down to labor like and it's not just

[49:18] you know the movie launch right

[49:19] right david it's like he he just can't

[49:22] keep a constant cadence of new titles coming out

[49:26] like why was pirate to the care being shown in october

[49:30] of twenty seventeen

[49:33] and here we are

[49:35] in december of twenty eighteen

[49:37] and it's still barely trickling out

[49:40] it was almost like a nine to ten month delay on even getting the game on the line

[49:45] something's wrong

[49:47] something's wrong and i think

[49:49] davier a lot like everyone else

[49:51] we want to see jack figure this out and i think it's a really interesting

[49:55] scenario

[49:57] for him to actually hit up

[49:59] uh... whether it's american pinball or chicago gaming company

[50:03] and actually get some help

[50:05] uh... when it comes to contract manufacturing

[50:08] and and and you know because clear that jersey jack can't figure that part out

[50:13] it's always been his achilles heel

[50:16] and i i you know

[50:17] i i i fully expected to continue to be his achilles heel

[50:21] as we move forward

[50:23] i'm davi hope you continue to

[50:26] to send in your insights on stuff we talk about on the show because i do i i

[50:30] think it was incredible and i think we all learned a lot

[50:33] just listening to it so i really appreciate that

[50:36] alright anything else you know what i'm just gonna end the show there

[50:40] because i think we all should end this show

[50:42] uh... with with with a little bit of learning

[50:45] i want to thank all of you

[50:47] who sent me messages congratulating me

[50:51] on my wedding
