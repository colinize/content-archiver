[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada Spinball Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:22] We're back a few days earlier than I thought I'd be back, and it's been a week now since

[00:27] my beautiful wife, Brenda, woke up to an email that Metta was laying her off along with 11,000

[00:35] people, 10,000 people laid off at Amazon, layoffs are happening all across the tech

[00:41] sector, and I've been doing a lot of reflecting on life in general, and I want to talk about

[00:46] that on this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast, and I want to talk about how there's a parallel

[00:52] to what happened to my wife at Metta and what I think is going on in Pinball, because when

[00:57] my wife got let go, I was like, you know, how did this happen, right?

[01:00] How did Facebook and Metta, right?

[01:02] They renamed the company Metta, and they invested all of this money in the Metaverse, $15 billion.

[01:09] How did it get to a point where Mark Zuckerberg had a layoff of 11,000 people in one single

[01:15] day?

[01:16] And I did a lot of research because I'm like, what was the reason behind a lot of this?

[01:19] And it came down to one failed business decision, and the failed business decision, the origins

[01:26] of it was this.

[01:27] They thought that consumer behavior that developed during COVID would last far longer than it

[01:35] actually did.

[01:37] When everyone started working remotely, right, people didn't want to go into the offices,

[01:42] everyone's like, we're just going to use our computers and our terminals as a way to plug

[01:46] in and connect with coworkers.

[01:49] They thought that the Metaverse would be the solution and the answer for all of these people

[01:55] that now no longer wanted to commute to work and go into all these expensive office spaces

[02:01] and suffer through the slings and arrows of subways and transportation.

[02:05] And they got it fully wrong because the vaccine came and then people are going back to the

[02:11] way life used to be.

[02:13] And if you look at Pimball and what has happened in the Pimball hobby over the last couple

[02:18] of years, think about the consumer behavior.

[02:22] Everyone has been spending way more money on these machines during COVID.

[02:26] People felt isolated, they felt claustrophobic, the price of machines was going up like 30%,

[02:34] sometimes a 100%.

[02:36] People were spending $20,000 on medieval madness royal editions.

[02:41] People were buying pyrto the Caribbean CE for $40,000 new in box.

[02:47] And so what happened in Pimball is these companies saw the consumer behavior that developed during

[02:54] COVID.

[02:55] They saw how people were throwing money at these games like there was no tomorrow.

[03:00] But the problem is there is a tomorrow and we've all woken up from that hangover and

[03:06] now everyone is living in a post sort of COVID world in which we're getting back out

[03:11] there.

[03:12] We want money for more things.

[03:14] And not only that, right?

[03:15] When COVID first hit, remember what we all thought?

[03:18] We thought that we were going to slide into a recession, but the complete opposite happened.

[03:24] The stock market went through the roof.

[03:26] People were making money with crypto and then everyone had all this excess money and they

[03:31] were feeling so bullish about life.

[03:34] And so you didn't feel bad about spending a gazillion more dollars on a Pimball machine

[03:38] that used to sell for half that price just a couple years ago.

[03:43] And so that behavior was going on.

[03:45] And then what happened?

[03:46] There was a supply shortage.

[03:48] So there was far more demand than supply of Pimball machines.

[03:52] Now look at 2022.

[03:54] Look what's going to start happening in Pimball.

[03:56] There is going to be a supply surplus.

[04:00] There are going to be distributors sitting with tons and tons of Toy Story games, tons

[04:06] and tons of James Bond machines, tons and tons of premiums of like Mandalorian and Rush

[04:11] premium, right?

[04:12] All of these $9,700 premiums are going to be sitting at distributors without buyers.

[04:18] And if you look at these Pimball companies now, they have absolutely adjusted their business

[04:24] models to reflect the prices and the demand that was happening during COVID.

[04:31] Now mark my words right now.

[04:34] This is the single biggest mistake that is going to really cripple Pimball sales as we

[04:39] head into 2023.

[04:41] It's not about inflations or recessions.

[04:44] It's about this simple move that both Jersey Jack and Stern Pimball have done.

[04:50] And they are the two biggest culprits.

[04:53] Really by doing what they're doing and charging this much for these brand new and box games,

[04:59] they have turned every single distributor and every single dealer into a scalper.

[05:06] These are the scalper prices.

[05:08] $14,500 for a new and box James Bond LE if you include tax and shipping.

[05:17] That is the scalper price.

[05:19] The price of a Toy Story Collector's Edition with tax and shipping is $16,500.

[05:26] That is the scalper price.

[05:28] The other thing they've done now that they've made these distros into scalpers, they've

[05:33] increased the volume of the machines.

[05:36] So if you just step back a little bit and think about it commonsensically, you've increased

[05:41] the volume and you've super increased the price.

[05:45] What is that due to demand?

[05:47] It shrinks the demand for it because none of these games are that rare anymore and yet

[05:52] they're so expensive as if these games are already being predetermined as great masterpiece

[06:00] games that are worth this much money.

[06:03] And this is not going to work.

[06:05] And this is going to create the greatest slowdown in Pimball demand since I've been covering

[06:12] this hobby.

[06:13] And this is the same mistake that Mark Zuckerberg made thinking that the behavior we showcased

[06:18] during COVID was going to last far into the future.

[06:21] Look, he bet big on it.

[06:23] But these Pimball companies are betting big that there are going to be consumers at these

[06:29] price points.

[06:30] And what is the data?

[06:32] What is the early data show us?

[06:34] It's absolutely the wrong bet.

[06:37] It was the wrong bet with Toy Story.

[06:39] But let me tell you, it doesn't matter what's in Godfather at these prices, the sales are

[06:44] going to be weak.

[06:45] We see the James Bond hype.

[06:47] It's gone.

[06:48] It's gone.

[06:49] It's not just because the code is not there.

[06:50] There are so many people out there, they don't want to spend this much money.

[06:56] And so here we are all of a sudden, this hobby in which we used to be able to buy these games

[07:02] and just lose a few hundred bucks or maybe gain a couple thousand, you're no longer going

[07:06] to gain any money.

[07:07] They have absolutely turned the distros into the scalpers.

[07:11] But here's the thing is the distros don't even get to enjoy the scalper profits that

[07:16] the secondhand market used to enjoy.

[07:19] Nobody is going to win now.

[07:20] I mean this.

[07:21] Nobody is going to win if Pimball prices stay where they're at.

[07:25] Who's going to win?

[07:26] Stern Pimball is going to dry up their buyer base.

[07:29] So is Jersey Jack.

[07:30] Good luck trying to sell spooky machines for $10,000, $11,000 with their quality issues.

[07:35] I mean, did you see that TNA?

[07:37] They're shipping these games out and the shooter rod, like come on, spooky.

[07:42] There's a huge gap on that shooter rod plate, right?

[07:44] That sits over the shooter rod.

[07:46] How come nobody over there looks down at a game and says that doesn't look right?

[07:51] You know, for $5,000, people would like forgive spooky for all of these detail mistakes.

[07:57] But the fact that they're making mistakes on games that are now costing $10,000 and it's

[08:02] a remake of a game they've already made, it just makes you shoulder shrug and be like

[08:06] they are never really going to figure quality out over there.

[08:10] They've got to figure it out.

[08:12] But who's going to run towards the next spooky game if it's $11,000?

[08:16] James Bond, Ellie is not even hard to get.

[08:19] And once we get to titles that are not dream themes, I mean this.

[08:23] Like once you get to a game like Venom and Godfather and Foo Fighters, how the heck are

[08:29] they going to move this inventory?

[08:31] And so what's going to happen next is these distributors are going to be sitting on a

[08:36] ton of expensive inventory.

[08:39] And once they're sitting on a ton of expensive inventory with no buyers, they're not going

[08:44] to be able to order the next game's inventory because it's not the L.E.s that are going

[08:49] to crush them.

[08:50] It's not because there's always going to be a thousand suckers out there that just absolutely

[08:55] have to have like the nicest perceived version of a pinball machine, even though I would

[09:00] argue that collecting pinball machines is absolutely now jump the shark.

[09:04] And I'm going to explain why with James Bond, Ellie and this Elwin game.

[09:08] Have you seen what Stern's doing?

[09:10] The reason why is it's no longer special for it to be truly special.

[09:14] There needs to be perception.

[09:15] There needs to be demand that you got something special and that a lot more collectors out

[09:21] there want it.

[09:22] Like there needs to be a lot of collectors seeking this stuff out.

[09:26] But when you look at James Bond, Ellie, it doesn't feel that way.

[09:29] They didn't go the extra mile with the game at all.

[09:33] And yet they charged you $2,500 more for James Bond than Godzilla.

[09:40] It doesn't come with the foil decal cabinet artwork.

[09:44] It doesn't have laser edged armor.

[09:46] They didn't do anything special.

[09:47] Now Godzilla doesn't have laser edged armor either.

[09:51] But you go back and people remember when I bought Star Trek, Ellie, it had laser edged

[09:57] armor.

[09:58] They didn't feel mirrored back glass.

[09:59] They were able to do this stuff for half the price.

[10:02] Come on, nobody has forgotten what it cost to make these games.

[10:08] And then you look at what Stern is doing right now with the collector community.

[10:11] Think about this for a minute.

[10:13] They want everyone who ordered a James Bond, Ellie, which is for the collectors.

[10:19] They want all of those people to pay in full for their games before they show you the Keith

[10:25] Elwin version of the game.

[10:28] Think about what that means.

[10:30] Just think about the message that sends to people out there in the pinball collecting

[10:35] community, which is the community that has kept all these companies going.

[10:41] It's not location play.

[10:43] The three tiered model, which has kept all of these companies successful, has been lifted

[10:48] up every new game by the collectors who order these Ellie's like sight unseen.

[10:55] And now you're going to sell this expensive $13,000 machine and not even give that James

[11:02] Bond fanatic a chance to see the Elwin pin before they make up their mind on which one

[11:09] they want to buy.

[11:11] Why is that an acceptable business approach?

[11:14] I understand why Stern is doing it, but it's benefiting nobody but Stern pinball.

[11:21] Nobody.

[11:22] Not me.

[11:23] Not you.

[11:24] Our investors in pinball companies.

[11:27] When I hear these pinball apologists like make excuse for these companies and the high

[11:32] prices, I don't understand why people in the community are actually making excuses for

[11:39] these high prices as if those individuals are shareholders in these companies.

[11:46] Why do you want to see these prices go through the roof?

[11:50] Who would actually justify any of it?

[11:53] And then you look at people saying that Toy Story has toys in it and they consider a kickback

[11:59] to be a toy and an LCD screen to be a toy.

[12:03] If you write something as a name as that, you deserve to be banned from pinside just

[12:09] like Canada.

[12:11] And I'm just here to tell you this people, we're all living through some difficult times

[12:15] ahead.

[12:16] It's going to be difficult for a lot of people.

[12:18] Now look, I can afford to go buy any pinball machine on planet earth.

[12:22] We are okay with our finances.

[12:24] I've always planned for the future.

[12:26] I'm not someone who sinks most of my money into pinball machines.

[12:31] I didn't chase a lot of crypto, but the crypto I did chase I lost money on.

[12:36] And I've always been a person who puts one paycheck aside for my future, for my retirement,

[12:43] for Killian's college, for other things that are much more important in life than pinball.

[12:48] If this week has taught me anything and I've reflected on pinball, I'll tell you what I

[12:53] come away thinking.

[12:54] I think these pinball companies don't want you to reflect more on what these machines

[13:00] mean to you.

[13:02] They don't want you to really think about what you could get for this much money.

[13:07] They don't want you to think about the fact that these companies are now scalping you.

[13:12] The Mandalorian topper priced at $2,000 is the scalper price of the game.

[13:21] Stern pinball is scalping each and every one of you who just bought one.

[13:26] And no, I don't want to interview George Gomez.

[13:29] I don't care to interview any of these pinball personalities over at these companies because

[13:34] I don't care what they have to say.

[13:38] My eyes and ears and my mind works.

[13:42] I can look down at Toy Story 4 and see almost nothing in it.

[13:47] I don't need to interview Jack Guinari or Pat Lawler to come to the conclusion that

[13:54] they are greedily scalping us with the price of those machines.

[13:59] And guess what?

[14:00] Most of this community is smart enough to realize that.

[14:04] And that's why most of this community has said no to buying these games.

[14:10] I want to end this podcast by saying this.

[14:12] I do feel bad for the dealers and distributors.

[14:16] I feel bad when I get an email from Joe Newhart at PimballStar and he's selling me on the

[14:23] full price of these Jersey Jack games with some line that's like, hey, we just got a

[14:28] few in.

[14:29] Get them why they still last.

[14:31] While they still last, Joe.

[14:33] I could save $3,000 if I go buy one with 10 plays on Pinside.

[14:39] And I feel bad for these dealers and distributors because they've really been the people that

[14:45] have built the community and created the large demand for these machines.

[14:50] It's been the dealers and the distributors.

[14:53] They've been finding the customers for all of these years.

[14:57] Now look, I'm going to play a little bit of devil's advocate.

[15:00] These distributors have had it really easy for the most part over the last few years because

[15:05] the demand has been through the roof and they had and had to go convince people to buy $9700

[15:11] premiums or $2,000 toppers.

[15:14] Now they're going to have their work cut out for them because if they overbuy on a mediocre

[15:19] game, they're going to be sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars of inventory that

[15:25] they can't move.

[15:27] And I don't know how much they make, but I have a hard time believing that some of these

[15:30] middle-sized distributors are making millions of year.

[15:34] I don't think that's the case.

[15:36] And so I know that they don't want these prices to keep going up because if these prices keep

[15:41] going up, their buyer base is going to shrink.

[15:44] And all of this is happening at the same time when you look at 2022 and how little interest

[15:51] there is in the Twippies and the awards show because all of these games for the most part

[15:57] were underwhelming.

[15:59] And so it's a perfect storm for this entire pinball new and box market to really slow

[16:06] down underwhelming machines, super high prices.

[16:11] The dealers and the companies are now the scalpers and we're the people who have to pay scalper

[16:16] prices for every single new thing that comes out.

[16:19] People are going to say no.

[16:21] People are going to start to look at their collections and be happy with what they have.

[16:25] People are going to realize that Canadian Pinball Podcast is the only pinball podcast

[16:29] talking about this.

[16:31] I mean, look at what's going on.

[16:32] I turn on all the other shows and it's like nobody wants to talk about this stuff.

[16:37] Nobody wants to bring up how painful it is that we are now at a point where it's like

[16:41] 20,000 by Christmas, not 10,000.

[16:45] I remember what this hobby used to be.

[16:47] I remember why it was so fun and exciting.

[16:51] And I understand now why it's starting to turn a lot of people off.

[16:55] We're going to see the way 2023 transpires, but I'll tell you this right now, the best

[17:00] bang for the buck in this entire hobby is Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[17:02] Thank you guys for the support, the five bucks.

[17:04] And for you two out there, Kim Mitchell and Donald Howard, you guys gave the most generous

[17:10] gifts when Brenda lost her job and I'm never going to forget it.

[17:13] Everybody have a great day.

[17:14] We'll talk to you soon.

[17:15] Bye.

[17:45] Bye.
