[00:00] They asked me how I knew my true love was true.

[00:10] Ah!

[00:14] Ah!

[00:15] Ah!

[00:16] Ah!

[00:17] Ah!

[00:18] Ah!

[00:19] Alright, welcome to episode 7 of the Canadian Club.

[00:22] This is going to be a good one because I'm going to give you information that nobody else

[00:26] has had.

[00:27] And I'm going to confirm some stuff that has been floating around the rumor mill.

[00:32] And you know me, this is Canada.

[00:33] I love to share information that other people don't want out there.

[00:38] There is no other pinball podcast on planet earth that does what I'm about to do.

[00:44] And that is confirmed for you, stuff that is happening in the pinball world that companies

[00:49] don't want you to know about.

[00:51] And I know that this week we talked about Lyman Sheets leaving Stern Pinball.

[00:55] We talked about Steve Richie going over to Jersey Jack.

[00:58] I'm going to talk a little bit about that on this episode.

[01:01] But you know my thoughts on all of that.

[01:02] I put up my public show yesterday and so that's pretty much how we feel about those two things.

[01:07] But I'm going to tell you a new Stern game coming out and I have confirmation what it

[01:11] is.

[01:12] I'm going to tell you what Lyman Sheets is working on and I have confirmation what that is

[01:16] as well.

[01:17] And you're going to hear it first on this Canadian Club episode.

[01:20] And I don't care if people who are not contributors are upset.

[01:24] I don't care if people who don't support this show are upset.

[01:27] This is what you get for being a special contributor to Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:33] And please I do ask that you don't share this link.

[01:35] I make these episodes for all of you and each and every one of you listening right now.

[01:40] The reason you are listening is because you have shown more support than other people

[01:45] out there and you understand all the hard work that goes into making 600 plus pinball podcast,

[01:50] especially in this industry in which there's not much news ever.

[01:54] So I'm glad I was able to entertain and entice you enough to contribute to the show.

[01:59] But before I share that information I want to talk about some criticisms I've received

[02:03] this week and I hear people calling me stuff like I'm nasty for sharing information that

[02:08] should be held secret that I shouldn't spoil the news and the moments that these companies

[02:14] have that I should simply wait on the sidelines like everybody else and let a pinball company

[02:20] have its moment in the spotlight.

[02:23] But here is my counter point to that.

[02:26] There is a little circle of good old boys and they know who they are who have all the

[02:31] information about what's coming out next with all of these companies.

[02:35] And you know who some of these people are, you know the personalities, you know who they

[02:39] are and they know what's next.

[02:41] And even if they've signed NDAs they share it amongst each other.

[02:46] And my whole feeling is this.

[02:48] I think it is BS that there is this good old boy little circle of trust in which all

[02:53] these people get to know what's next down the pipeline and you don't.

[02:58] Why do they get to know what the next future titles are and you don't?

[03:03] You know when you're more informed about what's coming up it helps you make wiser purchasing

[03:07] decisions.

[03:08] See I don't think it's fair that this little circle gets to have all this information

[03:12] and make more educated decisions when it comes to new pinball machines right because

[03:16] they might wait on a game because they know what the next few titles are.

[03:20] I don't think that's fair.

[03:22] Why doesn't everybody get to know what the release schedule is for these companies?

[03:25] Oh they get to know and because they're in with these companies and their friends with

[03:29] these companies they get to know they get to be excited.

[03:33] They get to hold on to their wallets and their checkbook because they know what's coming

[03:37] down the pipeline.

[03:38] That's BS.

[03:39] I don't care if it spoils the plant because it's not really spoiling anything with these

[03:43] companies.

[03:45] Sales are through the roof.

[03:46] All of these new games.

[03:47] It doesn't matter if we talk about it on Canadian pinball podcast.

[03:50] It doesn't matter if pinside is speculating about this stuff.

[03:54] The majority of pinball buyers are not listening to this show.

[03:58] The majority of pinball buyers are not on pinside.

[04:02] This is where people go who are the die hards and the die hards want to buy everything.

[04:07] But I do believe the die hard enthusiasts also deserves to have more information than just

[04:12] the average amusement device purchaser.

[04:15] And that is why when I hear information and I get some credible sources on what's happening

[04:20] in the pinball world, I will share it with you.

[04:24] And even if that means I won't be friends with certain individuals in the pinball media.

[04:28] Even if it means I won't be friends with people at these companies, I don't care.

[04:33] That's not why I'm doing this show.

[04:35] For me, I've always been about democratizing the information that is out there in the pinball

[04:40] world.

[04:41] And it is that little circle that gets so annoyed by a canada because they want to protect

[04:46] their friends in the industry.

[04:48] They want to protect the people that are feeding them the information that they get to act

[04:53] on.

[04:54] And I don't think that's right.

[04:55] I really don't.

[04:57] I really don't.

[04:58] If you're going to tell these 10 people what the next titles are, I don't even care if

[05:01] they're keeping it secret.

[05:03] Why do they get to know?

[05:05] Why do they get access to that information?

[05:07] Okay?

[05:08] If these companies are publicly traded and if information gets out into the world, it's

[05:12] going to hurt the stock price or it's going to have some bottom line effect, there is

[05:17] absolutely no consequence to any of this information getting out.

[05:23] Everybody knows that the only consequence to this information getting out is it somewhat

[05:28] spoils their reveal moment.

[05:31] It's somewhat spoils the moment in which they pull back the curtain and say it's this

[05:36] theme.

[05:37] If you just know what a theme is or what's in the pipeline, so what?

[05:40] It's not like I'm sharing photos of these games.

[05:42] I could tell you that Jersey Jack Pimball is making the Matrix and then what?

[05:47] What's going to be in the game?

[05:48] You're still going to be just as excited.

[05:50] You're still going to be so hyped for the game and there's still going to have their

[05:54] moment of reveal.

[05:56] What I won't do, if I get pictures of a game, I don't want to spoil what that game is.

[06:02] I didn't do it with Guns and Roses and I wouldn't do it with anything else.

[06:05] Now the only time I would sort of leak some photos here and there is if the company

[06:10] themselves put those photos out and gave those photos out to the media because they never

[06:15] give them to me.

[06:17] Canada is always on the outside looking in and that's always the position I want to

[06:20] have.

[06:21] What yesterday showed once again is that the Canadian haters that are always doubting what

[06:26] I'm saying.

[06:27] They're always trying to make it seem like I'm wrong most of the time.

[06:30] They're always trying to make it seem like I'm bad for Pimball that I'm a nasty human

[06:35] being that I'm a narcissist.

[06:37] I get called all these names.

[06:39] I get called all these names and everyone says how horrible I am and I always respond.

[06:44] If I was that bad and I was so horrible for Pimball, why am I the number one show?

[06:50] Why do most people listen to Canadian Pimball podcasts?

[06:54] Why is it on Pinside a place I've been banned on for five years?

[06:59] Why are there thousands of mentions of my name throughout that page well after I was

[07:04] banned?

[07:05] It's not Canadian that's bad for Pimball.

[07:07] Canadian is bad for that good old boy little circle that loves to have all the information

[07:13] because I'm the one.

[07:14] See I'm the one at the gates of the castle of those good old boys who want to hold on

[07:18] to all this information.

[07:20] I sneak in at night and then I'm the Robin Hood and I give it to the rest of you.

[07:24] Now all of you out there can have a more informed purchasing decision and I believe that's

[07:29] the way it should be because even just knowing what the themes are you still have no clue

[07:33] what the mechs are and what's in these games.

[07:36] And you see how it is when I knew that it was Mandalorian I get you all excited we get

[07:40] all hyped for the game.

[07:42] It's fun.

[07:43] It's fun to have like two months of hyping up or a month of hyping up I can't wait to

[07:47] see what's in Mandalorian.

[07:48] What's not fun is endlessly just trying to guess over and over and over what these themes

[07:53] are.

[07:54] You might as well tell people what it is and then start the hype train you still haven't

[07:57] revealed the game you haven't shown them the specs people don't know what's in it and

[08:01] that is what I will always doing the pinball hobby.

[08:04] So enough about me let's talk about a few things and I'm going to end this podcast with

[08:09] the two big news items that I want to confirm for you but first let's talk about this Steve

[08:13] Richie joining Jersey Jack pinball first and foremost it is a head scratcher.

[08:18] I don't think Pat and Steve Richie are really going to work out together.

[08:22] I don't their type a personalities who's in charge now right because clearly it's

[08:28] Pat Lawler ship.

[08:29] I just don't think it's going to work out I mean you can see in the body language of

[08:33] Steve walking through the door with Jack and Pat off to the side.

[08:36] I mean the whole thing is these are two type a personalities they both want to run the

[08:41] ship and they both want to be the captain of the operation and now you've got both of

[08:45] them together and that's going to be beneficial.

[08:48] I think they're both going to be tugging at the wheel.

[08:50] It's funny because I was thinking about it so what's today like when Steve Richie walks

[08:54] into Jersey Jack pinball what does he actually do?

[08:57] My big fear is this I know Eric Minier has already had it rough with Pat Lawler meddling

[09:02] with his designs.

[09:04] Now Eric Minier has to have Steve Richie also meddling with his designs and you could

[09:09] argue that maybe they're making it better and helping Eric out but that's not the stories

[09:14] I've heard from what Pat Lawler did with guns and roses.

[09:17] He yanked stuff out of Eric's game and if you could hear episode 500 I know I always

[09:23] hype it but you would hear stories about how Pat Lawler was an exactly helpful for Eric

[09:29] Minier and you'd also know the truth about how Pat Lawler is the reason why there are

[09:35] not triple spinning discs in pirates of the Caribbean they never want you to hear this

[09:40] stuff but that's the truth.

[09:42] It's not beneficial to Eric to have the older guard looking over his shoulder and picking

[09:48] his stuff apart I think Eric Minier knows exactly what he's doing and I think Eric Minier

[09:54] needs to do stuff that impresses Eric Minier not to senior pinball designers from yesterday

[10:00] years.

[10:01] And so what does Steve Richie do when he walks in on day two right as he start designing

[10:05] a new game do they even have a third theme lined up for him.

[10:09] Guns and roses is done.

[10:11] Boy Story is done.

[10:13] I have to assume that Eric Minier's next theme has already been secured.

[10:17] I have to assume that Pat Lawler knows what he's working on after Toy Story so then what

[10:22] do you give Steve Richie to do.

[10:25] It's a really weird move it was a really weird video and the entire thing just makes Jersey

[10:30] Jack pinball look a little bit fatigued it makes them look a little bit out.

[10:36] Here's something else that they did and this whole thing was a little bit of a Trojan

[10:39] horse as well because this whole announcement came at the exact same time Jersey Jack pinball

[10:44] announced its play field policy moving forward that it is going to allow guns and roses owners

[10:51] who have issues to buy replacement play fields for $500.

[10:56] Okay.

[10:57] Isn't that kind of sketchy the way they dropped both of these announcements on top of

[11:01] each other clearly they wanted to sort of deflect away from that play field correspondence

[11:07] because if you look at it very literally this company is giving people a chance who basically

[11:13] bought a defective play field to pay money and get a new one it's not going to be populated

[11:20] they're going to sell it to you at cost but it still sucks right you bought a game for

[11:25] this much money and something in it is defective and instead of giving you a replacement for

[11:31] free they are charging you money for it on just a very surface level that's not a

[11:37] great move but I did say in an earlier show maybe they should at least do that and they're

[11:42] doing at least that now here's the big question how are we to believe that these play fields

[11:48] are going to be any better that's my issue with this whole thing it makes no sense they're

[11:52] announcing in the summer of 2021 that the earliest you'll be able to get these replacement

[11:58] play fields for guns and roses they said it will be the end of the production of G and

[12:03] R which they are anticipating to be the summer of 2022 so let's break down this communication

[12:10] at the same time you're announcing Steve Richie is joining your company you're telling

[12:15] people that replacement play fields can be had a year from now not now not six months

[12:21] from now an entire year from now why would they announce this now why would they put this

[12:27] out there now because they're trying to put out this fire and they're trying to do it

[12:32] a little bit subversively underneath the Steve Richie announcement but I don't really

[12:38] know who they're fooling with any of this because the big question mark still remains

[12:42] is are these play fields any better none of the communication about this is saying we've

[12:47] fixed the problem and this is the part that I just don't understand so we're still just

[12:52] supposed to now buy new play fields and have absolutely no clue whether or not these new

[12:58] play fields are any better because you best believe it it's still going to be miracle

[13:03] making these play fields the greatest news Jersey Jack Pimball could have released yesterday

[13:08] was that they've switched play field manufacturers that is not what we got they got a new designer

[13:14] which we didn't need and they're going to let us buy additional play fields which we don't

[13:19] know if they're any better or not how are we supposed to get excited about either one of

[13:24] those news items for Jersey Jack Pimball I think this company needs to take a step back and think

[13:30] about this communication and think about how they're showcasing this company and think about how

[13:36] they're going to move forward with customer credibility and confidence because I don't think

[13:40] this is the way you go about it because they still haven't said one thing we know there's a problem

[13:47] they still haven't said we're sorry we're going to do something to fix it and look everybody

[13:52] would forgive them and move on and buy a new play field if they could somehow prove to us that

[13:57] these play fields were better so that's really going to be the interesting part how are you going

[14:02] to prove to me that it's actually better I don't know this whole thing just sucks because if you

[14:06] have really bad chip play field you have to swap them into the game and so like I just think

[14:11] that's not really a solution anyway so okay so let me give you guys some new information and

[14:18] let's end this show with confirmation of something that has been in the rumor mill but I'm here

[14:23] to confirm for you that it is happening and it is going to happen after Godzilla let me start

[14:29] with Stern Pimball so I am happy to report on Canatus Pimball podcast and give you confirmation

[14:35] that Keith Owens Godzilla is the next Pimball machine coming from Stern Pimball so I'm hearing

[14:41] that there will be two more Stern releases this year there will be Godzilla and then another

[14:46] title most likely by December and I'm here to confirm for you from my sources now yes this is

[14:52] still a rumor but canada is going to go on the record and I am going to confirm for you that the

[14:59] game coming out after Godzilla will be John Borg's Rush machine that is right he will be making

[15:07] rush I know this has been in the rumor mill but I'm here to confirm it rush is happening with

[15:13] John Borg I am also hearing that the band has recorded all of their call outs for the game so if

[15:21] you are a rush fan which John Borg is a huge rush fan it is happening it is no longer a mystery it

[15:29] is not going to be journey it is not going to be Motley crew it is going to be rush now we know

[15:35] John Borg and lineman sheets are huge rush fans so did lineman sheets help out with the code of

[15:42] rush I don't know there might still be a possibility that they allowed him to work on this game

[15:48] people forget that lineman sheets can just code a game in his basement so he could easily have this

[15:53] game in his house and he could have been coding it all these months and even though he's left

[15:58] Stern maybe this is something that he's also working on with his buddy John Borg but you heard it

[16:03] here confirmation it is going to be rush pinball personally I'm not a big rush fan but this will

[16:10] probably play well within the pinball demographic I'm not going to be ignorant and say rush has no

[16:16] fans and if you look at the pinball demographic and rush demographic there is amazing overlap so

[16:23] rush pinball coming from Stern pinball most likely this December all right now here's the real big

[16:30] news and this is the game that I keep hearing is going to be the show stopper most likely of 2022

[16:39] probably early 2022 I'm here to tell you that the big game that I keep hearing is going to be the

[16:45] one that is going to come out of nowhere and blow people away I keep saying Chicago gaming company

[16:53] has three humongous things they are going to announce now cactus canyon remake is coming and I

[16:59] wouldn't be surprised if lineman sheets gave some coding help on that game right he also coded

[17:04] games called monster bash minival madness and attack from Mars so if you think about it it makes

[17:09] perfect sense that lineman sheets would be the first phone call they would make to help out with

[17:13] cactus canyon but that's not what I'm here to tell you right now the game that lineman sheets is

[17:18] working on the game that lineman sheets has been helping with the big one it's not cactus canyon

[17:25] the big thing that's going to come out is that lineman sheets has partnered up with fame and

[17:32] historic pinball designer mark richie mark richie and lineman sheets are working on a juggernaut

[17:40] themed game that is coming out sometime soon probably 2022 and as far as what it is your guess

[17:49] is not as good as mine so my guess seems to be pretty damn good I'm going to go out on a limb

[17:54] and I think it's going to be this I think mark richie and lineman sheets will be coming out with

[18:01] pulp fiction pinball I think that is going to be the title now there's also a science fiction title

[18:08] that he is working on as well so I think there are two major games in development and if it's a

[18:14] sci-fi theme that would be awesome as well I wonder what it could be so if mark richie and lineman

[18:20] sheets come out with pulp fiction and a sci-fi theme you heard it here on canada's pinball podcast

[18:27] those are going to be my only two guesses is a science fiction theme and pulp fiction I'm not

[18:32] going to throw anything else into the ring I know I got criticized a lot with the spooky guesses

[18:36] that I made like too many guesses but you heard it here that lineman sheets and mark richie are

[18:41] working together and here's the thing if they're not working together then go ask them and see what

[18:47] they say I bet you don't get any of them to say it's not true and I don't know why Ryan White is

[18:53] telling me that lineman sheets is not working at cgc because every single source that I reach out to

[19:00] is like that is who lineman is applying his talents to I think rines just trying to save this news and

[19:06] have that big moment of glory in which they announced that lineman's efforts are on these games but

[19:11] I'm here to tell you I almost a hundred percent believe we're going to see lineman sheets work

[19:16] on a mark richie pin and on cgc stuff moving forward everybody this has been episode seven of the

[19:22] canada club I just want to thank you once again for all of your support I take a lot of arrows in

[19:27] the back I've been called a lot of nasty things this week by people and I don't really care right I

[19:33] know the people who are doing it and they are the ones who think they're entitled to being the voice

[19:38] of pinball they're the ones who think they're entitled to being the personalities and the face of

[19:43] this hobby and they claim to love it more than anything and they also lob on the me that I don't

[19:49] love pinball that I'm not excited about pinball that I'm not entertained by pinball and it's just

[19:54] funny to me because if my show was so negative and I was such a bad person why is this show the

[20:00] most listened to show why am I the one is not hiding what my numbers are I'm the one who's transparent

[20:07] I'm the one who's telling you the stuff you should know about and I don't care if this spoils

[20:14] some of these companies plans because guess what they're making so much money they've taken so

[20:20] much of all of our money and we don't always get what we pay for and this is our chance to take back

[20:26] something of value information in the pinball world is valuable if you know what the next three

[20:33] titles are that's valuable information to you and you deserve to have that I'm sorry but protecting

[20:39] this stuff and keeping it secret just so a handful of people can make why is her decisions than you

[20:45] is not the way it should be so unfortunately for all of these people canada does exist and unfortunately

[20:52] for all these people canada is the robin hood of pinball information I will steal from the rich

[20:58] and give to all of us poor people who have to beg and plead for this information because we're

[21:03] not part of that good old boy's little circle club and we're just pinball enthusiasts and fans

[21:08] who spend way too much time thinking and talking about pinball and so thank you so much for

[21:13] contributing and supporting me and saying nice things about me because someone has to be like in

[21:18] the show if there's this many people listening and look you can you can talk about this information

[21:22] I'm gonna reveal it on my main show later this week but you now know that mark richy and lineman

[21:28] sheets are working on a game and that rush pinball by john borg is coming out and that is canada

[21:34] club episode seven peace out people
