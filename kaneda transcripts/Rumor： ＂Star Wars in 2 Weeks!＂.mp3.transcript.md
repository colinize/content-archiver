[00:00] Good Monday morning everyone, Canadian Spinball Podcasts here with a little breaking sort

[00:59] what does that mean does that mean that we're going to finally bring aro smith pinball to a star wars convention no it can't mean that it must mean that we're going to get some bit of news surrounding the title here's what my guess is this is canators pure speculation i think we're going to get a teaser video of the pinball game okay i think it's going to be like an amalgamation of like it's coming in

[01:29] you know just a little teaser it's not going to be the full reveal i don't think they're going to bring the game out then i think we're going to get a teaser i think fans are going to get a little bit of just like a sneak peak and then i think we're going to get the full reveal on May 4th i think it's the perfect one to punch let's get people excited and then let's wait two weeks and give them the full reveal yes i did say that i think two weeks from now we're going to see star wars

[01:59] at the fan convention tease and then two weeks from then i think we're going to see the full game revealed now how many days am i saying it's going to be until we see stuff on star wars this many days follows our ethos that we want to be able to man a manufacturer as much as possible in a two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks

[02:30] so that's it ladies and gentlemen we had to use that clip i've been saved that one for something funny but that's it so will we see star wars in two weeks and then will we get a full reveal of the game and i'm excited i don't know about you guys when that with that theme song comes on this is the game this is the game we're all waiting for this is the game that we all got a bunch of money saved up for

[02:49] and i think stern's trying to like throw me off the path a little bit of time saying oh we're not going to do it we're delaying it we're delaying it delaying it

[02:56] bullshit there is no way stern is going to miss may 4th and i think it makes perfect sense to do a teaser at the fan celebration because as i've said more people are going to buy this game outside of the pinball die hearts and any other machine because star wars collectors are a different breed they are different breed

[03:13] and i get that their old star wars games but this is something completely new so take this information run with it i could be wrong i could be getting like a season to system my friends it's done today being like what the hell you doing take it down but we'll see what happens it doesn't matter it's the worst kept secret in a galaxy far far away have a great day canada out
