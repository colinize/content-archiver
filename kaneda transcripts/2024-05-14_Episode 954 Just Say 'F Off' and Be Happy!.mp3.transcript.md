[00:00] Ah, welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] Canada is Daddy 2.0.

[00:26] What a day yesterday.

[00:28] Oh my gosh, for those of you out there that have witnessed the birth of a child, there

[00:32] is nothing like it.

[00:34] Mama is doing great.

[00:37] Little baby Cassian is doing great.

[00:39] Yes, Cassian.

[00:40] I named him after Cassian Andor, the leader of the rebellion.

[00:45] I always wanted kids that had my initials.

[00:48] So Killian and Cassian, the start of the Peaky Blinder family that is our little blended

[00:56] Irish Italian Greek family.

[00:59] It's going to be amazing.

[01:01] I am still like on a high.

[01:03] You know, when you see that little baby take that first breath, it's so incredible.

[01:09] And they're little fingers wrapped around your finger.

[01:11] It's everything.

[01:13] We have given birth to a life form, a little baby that will not be buying John Wick L. Lee.

[01:22] It doesn't seem like anybody's really buying this game.

[01:25] I put a poll up.

[01:26] I put it in a knock you was poll up that was like how many people are buying this game

[01:31] and over a thousand people contributed to the poll.

[01:35] And man, oh man, oh man, if those results are accurate, it is going to be pretty tough for

[01:41] a stern bimbal to move these games.

[01:43] We're going to talk a little bit about that, but I want to just talk about after my last

[01:48] show and after giving birth and after all of this stuff, all the commentary, all of your

[01:54] feedback, Rod and joining the Canadian club at $30 a month in Australia.

[02:00] Welcome brother to the Omokasi club and all the great feedback I got on that our rated

[02:06] canada show where I basically summarized how we all feel about stern pinballs pricing

[02:14] in 2024.

[02:16] The same way we all feel about Jersey Jack pricing in 2024.

[02:20] Two words.

[02:21] F off.

[02:22] That's it.

[02:23] I'm not mad at you.

[02:25] I don't want to fight you.

[02:26] I'm not going to fly to Chicago and you know, start a fight or try to burn down a factory.

[02:31] I just want to tell you when you try to sell me James Bond, 60th for $20,000 and you think

[02:37] an Elton John and a Toy Story CE are worth $15,000 when the bombs 4500 and then you want

[02:44] to triple the price of a Black Knight topper and then you want to charge us like $2,000

[02:49] for a Foo Fighter topper and then you want to remake more anniversary editions and then

[02:53] you want to send George Gomez on a damage control tour.

[02:56] Did you see George Gomez having to do like an entire media tour when Jaws pinball came

[03:01] out?

[03:01] Nope.

[03:02] He didn't go anywhere.

[03:03] He didn't have to go anywhere because the game was fine.

[03:06] Like people saw the value in it and that's why when you add it all up ladies and gentlemen,

[03:11] when you add up how everyone's feeling right now, it's just F off and it's with a shoulder

[03:16] shrug.

[03:17] I'm not that mad.

[03:18] I just don't care anymore.

[03:19] I don't care anymore at these prices.

[03:21] These games are not hitting.

[03:23] They're not landing and with the whole world going bonkers, I was just reading a story.

[03:28] This girl goes to Shake Shack just to get a Shake Shack dinner with her friend.

[03:33] I'm talking two burgers, two fries and two drinks and she leaves Shake Shack with a $58

[03:41] bill.

[03:42] The world is crazy right now and it's happening everywhere and the easiest place to say no

[03:50] is pinball and here's why I think people are saying no right now and I mean this when I

[03:54] say this.

[03:55] I don't think you've fallen out of love with pinball at all.

[03:59] I don't think you're tired of pinball content creators.

[04:02] It was really fun last week seeing all these content creators bicker back and forth about

[04:06] Gun Gate making videos slamming each other, apologizing, say hey if I just thought differently,

[04:12] look I'm never going to apologize ever for the video I put up on Saturday morning spectacular.

[04:18] I'm never going to take back anything I said there because I don't disagree with anything

[04:22] I said there.

[04:24] Make it political.

[04:25] I didn't get into some silly debate.

[04:27] I didn't sort of lob insults at other people and how they feel about guns and this and

[04:31] that.

[04:32] I don't care about that.

[04:33] What I care about is that we're all getting ripped off and I will never rescind that podcast.

[04:38] I will never take it back.

[04:40] I will never apologize for what I said because I think I articulated in such a dramatic and

[04:46] entertaining fashion how mostly everybody feels, almost everybody who out there wants

[04:52] pinball prices to be this stupid other than Seth Davis, Gary Stern, George Gomez.

[04:58] Who else didn't step in and stop this?

[05:00] Did Jack Winari stop it?

[05:01] Did Keith Elwin stop it?

[05:03] Did anyone stop it?

[05:04] So all of your beloved pinball gods and luminaries, they've all been colluding behind the scenes

[05:11] to make pinball this damn expensive and I think the rest of us actually have all the

[05:16] power because we have all the money.

[05:18] If we stop buying, I think everything's going to be better.

[05:21] When we stop buying, prices are going to come down.

[05:24] It's just that simple.

[05:26] These companies are not going to go out of business.

[05:27] It's almost like impossible for a pinball company to go out of business.

[05:31] Zidware is still around in some way.

[05:33] People are buying the IP of Zidware still in 2024.

[05:37] Haggis Pinball has been losing money for 18,000 years and they're still around.

[05:41] Heck, the way pinball is going, I wouldn't be surprised if Kevin Kulik comes out of nowhere

[05:46] and says he's going to make total recall pinball and people would probably still invest in it

[05:51] because that's pinball.

[05:52] As long as that word exists, attached to any business planner idea, it's going to stay

[05:57] alive for a really long time.

[05:59] Ninja Eclipse, look at pinball adventures.

[06:02] As Andrew McBain's company gone out of business, no, they're still around.

[06:06] They're still kicking and that's why Canadian Pinball Podcast, even with the brand new

[06:10] baby, will still be kicking.

[06:13] But here's the thing, I think all of us are just telling them to f off.

[06:16] We think you're ripping us off.

[06:17] And here's the other part and this is the real part about all of it.

[06:20] When I realized this yesterday when I was holding Cassian and I was overwhelmed with

[06:24] the amount of happiness and joy as I looked and I brought Killian to see Cassian for the

[06:30] first time and there it was.

[06:31] Like the three most important things in my world were Brenda and my two boys and there

[06:38] we were, the four of us together and this is it.

[06:41] This is everything we ever need to truly be happy.

[06:45] Everything else is just ancillary to this.

[06:48] Everything else, as long as all of us can maintain our health and happiness and be together

[06:53] as much as possible, we will have one at life and we should all be aiming towards longevity

[07:00] and moments together that matter, right?

[07:03] And pinball is not the center of that.

[07:06] Pinball will never be the center of that.

[07:08] Now what pinball can do really well is create a community in which you can find people that

[07:14] become your extended family and I mean that.

[07:17] While my family is small, my nucleus family is small, my extended pinball family is big

[07:22] and I love my pinball family and I don't want to wake up without my pinball family but my

[07:28] family and pinball means way more.

[07:31] You mean way more to me than any machine ever.

[07:34] My conversations with each and every one of you that I talk to mean more to me than any

[07:39] pinball machine would ever mean to me.

[07:41] The things we do together are more valuable than any damn wizard mode.

[07:45] I just saw a guy got to the end of James Bond and someone's like, how long did it take you

[07:51] to get there?

[07:52] And he's like 45 to 50 minutes and I just thought about that for a minute.

[07:56] What that would mean to play a 50 minute game of pinball and I'm telling you right now,

[08:02] instead of doing that, I would much rather hang out with you guys for 50 minutes, drink

[08:08] and sake, have an omokase in Tokyo a moment we would never forget versus playing James

[08:15] Bond for 50 minutes and I don't care what he gets to with this 14 billion points or

[08:18] whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

[08:21] Life is very short, it's very precious and here's the thing.

[08:24] I think for most of us we're all coming to this realization and it's two things that

[08:29] are colliding.

[08:30] One thing is all of these companies are ripping us off.

[08:34] The other thing is that you have amazing games you're happy with and that is the thing.

[08:39] That is the big issue happening in pinball and that's why John Wick is an utter failure

[08:45] and that's why John Wick will always be a failure and that's why John Wick will never

[08:50] succeed and it's going to be a learning lesson for Stern and I'm happy so many of us are

[08:54] going to teach them this lesson.

[08:56] Here's the lesson of John Wick.

[08:58] It's not that the game is terrible.

[09:00] It's not that it doesn't have guns on the artwork.

[09:04] The game does not deliver what the price of the game is.

[09:08] No modern Stern does or will ever or can ever.

[09:13] Even Jaws LEs now are sliding down to 12.

[09:16] They're going to slide back down to 11 after 12 and this is what happens.

[09:21] No modern Stern is worth what these rip off prices are and then you're looking at your

[09:26] lineup and you've got games much better than John Wick.

[09:29] If you think about that, okay, so they're ripping me off.

[09:32] I've already got great games.

[09:33] A lot of them are from Stern that I got for much less money.

[09:37] I'm happy.

[09:38] I'm happy.

[09:40] I don't need to go on on this new thing.

[09:42] F off.

[09:43] F off.

[09:44] Now maybe you don't need to say off.

[09:45] Off you could say I'm not interested, whatever it is.

[09:47] But that poll is not lying and Stern is going to hear us and Jersey Jack is going to hear

[09:52] us.

[09:53] Elton John is a great game.

[09:54] It's not selling.

[09:55] There's only one reason it's not selling.

[09:56] It's not because it's Elton John.

[09:58] So many of you guys bought Iron Maiden and you don't even like the music.

[10:03] So many of you guys bought other machines where you didn't love the themes but you love

[10:06] the game and the reason you went in is it wasn't priced that astronomical.

[10:11] That's the only reason why.

[10:13] Jersey Jack has just released the greatest game it's ever made and it's not selling and

[10:18] it's because it's overpriced and that's that ladies and gentlemen.

[10:22] And so I think everybody's just going to end up being, get ready for it.

[10:25] I think all of you are going to be happier when you stop buying these expensive ripoff

[10:31] new and box games.

[10:33] I think you're going to really wait for the thing that really speaks to you.

[10:37] And I think as you get happier and as you wait and as you force these companies to do

[10:42] one simple thing, everyone's going to get happier.

[10:46] We're going to force them to lower their prices and when they do that, they're going to be

[10:51] happier because they're going to know they did the right thing.

[10:54] I mean that Seth Davis is not going to destroy this hobby.

[10:58] Jack Guinari's arbitrary pricing is not going to destroy this hobby.

[11:03] They're going to be happier because they're going to know they did the right thing.

[11:06] Dealers and distros are going to be happier because they're finally going to be able to

[11:11] give you a product that's not a tanking asset.

[11:14] And we're going to be able to be happier because we're going to get prices back to where they

[11:19] were in 2019, 2020.

[11:22] That's it.

[11:23] This is the ceiling people.

[11:24] 10 K is the ceiling.

[11:26] And if you don't think 10 K is the ceiling, just look at what happened with Funhouse.

[11:30] Now look, Funhouse is coming out today.

[11:32] We're going to see it.

[11:33] I think at 10 a.m. here's my prediction about Funhouse.

[11:36] There's going to be 750.

[11:39] Now I broke for the world yesterday for you exclusively on Canada's pinball podcast.

[11:43] I broke for you the details of Funhouse by Prodretti Gaming.

[11:47] They are now making two versions of the game, a classic edition and a limited edition.

[11:53] Now I reached out to Andrea Prodretti and I said, look, man, I'm going to give you some

[11:57] free marketing advice.

[11:59] My going rate at Weber is like 400.

[12:02] No, it's $530 an hour.

[12:05] I'm going to give you some free advice.

[12:07] Do not call the base level of Funhouse the classic edition.

[12:12] I said the reason why is that CE now stands for collector's edition.

[12:18] And if you call it the CE, but you mean classic, it's just annoying.

[12:23] Just call it the OG edition, right?

[12:26] It's Funhouse OG edition.

[12:29] It's got the original artwork, the original code, the original everything.

[12:34] So just call it the OG and people will be thankful.

[12:37] That edition is $7,500.

[12:41] It has the same art package as the Baldy Williams game.

[12:44] You can upgrade this with a 2.0 code, which is Rudy's nightmare.

[12:49] And the reason why that's only $400 and not like $2,000, when you upgrade it in original

[12:54] Funhouse to this 2.0 kit, you had to change the boards in it.

[12:59] You had to add those fast boards.

[13:01] And because this game comes with the fast boards, you don't have to spend all that money.

[13:06] It's just a software upgrade.

[13:08] Now look, the LE is really the one that's going to get all the attention.

[13:12] I heard Brian Allen's art package on this game is absolutely stunning.

[13:16] So that is going to be on the new play field, on the translate, on the cabinet, on the back

[13:22] box, on the speaker panel area, everywhere.

[13:25] Like this thing is all new looking.

[13:27] And they're only going to make $750.

[13:30] Now look, I say only with the caveat, is that too many?

[13:33] I'll talk about that in a second.

[13:35] So $750 of them.

[13:37] The game is going to come with both the original code and Rudy's nightmare.

[13:41] It has a shaker motor.

[13:42] It has a Leor topper that they're going to make available at a later date.

[13:47] That's annoying.

[13:48] Everything should be ready on day one.

[13:50] Where's Leor's GNR topper?

[13:52] I'm so tired of this gang.

[13:54] Your topper needs to be ready on day one.

[13:58] It's too far along where people don't get this.

[14:00] The apron LED RGB light show is exclusive to the LE.

[14:05] There's a premium sound system.

[14:07] There's magic glass.

[14:08] There's Rudy eye light show.

[14:10] Not sure what that is, but I know they updated Rudy on the outside.

[14:14] So now he's going to have some light show going on.

[14:17] There's back glass title lights that are exclusive to the LE.

[14:21] A numbered plaque, an engraved watch.

[14:23] You're going to be able to get an engraved watch.

[14:26] Nick Parks is getting 400 of these to distribute in the US.

[14:30] There's a two year warranty on the game, one year on all the parts, which is actually not

[14:34] bad in pinball.

[14:35] I also asked Andrea Padretti.

[14:37] I was like, look, man, if this game sells well, you better not come out with another

[14:43] version that has Brian Allen's artwork that's not the LE.

[14:47] He's like, nope, this is it.

[14:50] If you buy one, just feel good that they're not going to hoodwink you a few months from

[14:55] now.

[14:56] Now here's the thing with all of this.

[14:58] I think this is going to be an interesting test of the market.

[15:02] Funhouse has a lot of games out there.

[15:04] I think there's something like 11,000 original Funhouse machines.

[15:08] I don't think people were really clamoring for more Funhouse games, but they did something

[15:14] smart.

[15:15] They've upgraded the way the game looks.

[15:17] For those of you who are like, oh, it should have been the original and they're going to

[15:21] sell you the original, but let's face it, modern artwork on these games is way better

[15:27] than it was in the Balli Williams period.

[15:30] It just is.

[15:31] If Zombie Yeti did the artwork on Adam's family, you don't think it would be better.

[15:35] If Franchi did the artwork on these games, it wouldn't be better.

[15:39] Of course it would be better.

[15:40] Now look, this is Brian Allen's shot here.

[15:43] I mean him.

[15:44] Brian Allen's been on the sidelines, making additional things, but he's never had an official

[15:49] OEM release game like this, albeit it's a remake.

[15:54] But what I've heard about this game is nothing short of it's stunning.

[15:59] It's awesome.

[16:00] There's lots of Easter eggs.

[16:02] It looks incredible.

[16:04] I think this game, even though there's going to be 750, I think it's going to be the Funhouse.

[16:10] If you want a Funhouse, everybody's going to want.

[16:13] That's the big question.

[16:14] Do you want a Funhouse for around $10,000?

[16:17] Then the Leor Topper you know is going to be another $1,000.

[16:21] That's where we're at.

[16:23] Everything is a huge test of the market.

[16:26] I'm just going to say this.

[16:27] I'm shopping for cars right now and I got a really fun little two-seater sports car

[16:31] I'm going to get for my little zip zip around town.

[16:34] It's just crazy to me that this car is basically like just the price of two and a half pinball

[16:40] machines and I'm like, how did it get to this?

[16:44] My money's going there.

[16:45] My money's going to furniture for the new house.

[16:48] I am not buying any pinball machines anytime soon.

[16:51] I'm happy about that.

[16:53] I'm going to wait to see what back to the future has.

[16:55] I've also been knocking on Barry's door.

[16:58] Knock, knock, knocking on Barry's door.

[17:00] Ha, ha, ha, yeah.

[17:02] And I've been saying, Barry, you know, what's up with this Alice in Wonderland?

[17:06] Like you guys are doing nothing to keep the excitement going and I keep telling them you

[17:10] guys are making a mistake.

[17:12] Like you're just going to watch all this money go in other directions and come July, I don't

[17:18] think you're going to be able to just like pull the curtain off in Alice in Wonderland

[17:22] game.

[17:23] And all of a sudden there's going to be 500 people that want to spend like $14,000 on

[17:29] an untested sort of new brand, an old J-pop IP with like zombie Eddie artwork and zombie

[17:37] Eddie wants nothing to do with it.

[17:39] I think they need to get out more with some weekly teases and at least have like a launch

[17:44] date.

[17:45] I don't know.

[17:46] Everything just feels like, yeah, we did this.

[17:48] Why'd you even do it?

[17:49] Like why'd you even announce DPX when you announced it?

[17:52] Like it didn't seem like it made any sense whatsoever.

[17:56] You weren't done making the Lebowski's and this is the thing.

[17:59] I love Barry.

[18:00] I know what he's doing over there.

[18:01] I'm really happy of Dutch pinball successes over the last few years.

[18:06] But man, it's just another example of marketing done wrong.

[18:10] You didn't really have a strategy.

[18:12] Why did you have to announce DPX?

[18:14] There was no point doing it the way you did it and you've done nothing since then.

[18:19] I listened to other pinball podcasters and now they're just making fun of the name.

[18:23] They're calling it like double penetration X and like, come on, you got to get out there

[18:27] and control the narrative.

[18:29] And I think Stern learned that the hard way last week.

[18:32] I think all these companies are starting to learn this as I look over across the pinball

[18:37] world and none of the new spooky games sold out.

[18:41] Labyrinth didn't sell out.

[18:42] We got to look at that factory, right?

[18:44] And it's not easy, right?

[18:46] It's not easy.

[18:47] A lot of these companies have a lot of overhead and they've got to move new and box games.

[18:53] And if people like you and me start to turn off our new and box purchases and new and

[18:58] box FOMO is dead, like it is dead.

[19:01] Yeah, it'll come back if there's a back to the future.

[19:04] Sure.

[19:05] It'll come back if there's a die hard.

[19:07] Sure.

[19:08] But not enough of these games are bangers.

[19:11] And when it's not a banger, there's no FOMO and then you're in real trouble because

[19:16] everybody is looking down at the games they own and they love what they've got.

[19:23] And I love what I've got in my life.

[19:25] I love my wife.

[19:26] I love my children.

[19:27] I love my family.

[19:29] I love my parents who gave me so much in life.

[19:32] They gave me the most valuable thing, a really good education.

[19:36] I decided to squander it doing a pinball podcast.

[19:40] No, I'm just joking.

[19:41] I love each and every one of you for being a member of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[19:45] The show's only going to get better.

[19:47] And I'm going to find the time to do it.

[19:49] I know this is going to be challenging, but I'm up for this challenge when I look down

[19:53] at baby Cassian.

[19:55] It makes me want to be a better person in every area of life.

[20:00] And I can't wait to move this family into a house.

[20:03] I can't wait to be able to walk and see my demon in a bathrobe.

[20:08] And I can't wait to see this fun house at 10 a.m.

[20:12] And I absolutely can't wait to see what Stern Pinball is going to do, people, because they're

[20:17] screwed here.

[20:18] They're not used to this.

[20:19] Remember, the next game is not coming out for four months.

[20:23] Nobody's buying John Wick.

[20:25] What are they going to do?

[20:27] How are they going to keep that huge line going?

[20:29] They're not going to be able to throw an anniversary edition on the line.

[20:32] They're not going to be able to remake another LE.

[20:35] They're screwed.

[20:36] There's no backlog on older titles.

[20:39] Dealers are sitting on a ton of unsold premiums.

[20:41] Trust me, hold the line.

[20:44] We need to hold the line.

[20:45] Don't go in.

[20:46] Don't bail them out of their greedy mistakes.

[20:49] And we're going to do it because you know what, Stern?

[20:52] You did it to yourself.

[20:53] F off.

[20:54] We're all happy with ourselves.

[20:56] We're happy with our lineup.

[20:58] This is not worth it.

[20:59] You ripped us off too many times.

[21:01] And we're going to just hold on to our money and you're either going to have to lower prices,

[21:07] lower the number of LEs, or you're in big trouble because you got four months to a new

[21:11] Metallica.

[21:12] It's not going to work.

[21:13] Canada out.

[21:14] I just heard Killian cry.

[21:15] I got to go get him.

[21:16] Later, everybody.
