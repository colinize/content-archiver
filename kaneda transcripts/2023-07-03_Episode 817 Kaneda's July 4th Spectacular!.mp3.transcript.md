[00:00] Come on, Barbie, let's go party.

[00:03] Come on, Barbie, let's go party.

[00:09] Oh, welcome everybody back to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] I am back from the Bahamas.

[00:14] There is so much to talk about in the pinball world, and we're going to get right to it,

[00:19] and it ain't going to take two hours.

[00:20] All right, so there's a lot of stuff going on in the pinball world.

[00:24] Everyone's wondering, is it going to be Venom that's turned on Vales at Comic-Con?

[00:29] There's a rumor that it might be like another version of Jurassic Park.

[00:33] Do we like this?

[00:34] Do we need more Jurassic Park games?

[00:36] There's also tons of rumors about potential vaults at the end of the year for a stern pinball.

[00:42] Jersey Jack is updating the code on the Godfather.

[00:45] Is that going to help that game finally get some sales of the Ellie editions?

[00:50] We've got American Pinball trying to get Galactic Tank Forces into people's homes.

[00:56] We've got Pulp Fiction updates on when the game is going to be made.

[00:59] It's going to be a long wait.

[01:01] We've got Haggis Pinball is going to try to pull a fast one again.

[01:04] Are we going to fall for it?

[01:05] I don't think anyone is.

[01:07] And what else is going on in pinball?

[01:09] OK, here's what we're going to do on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:12] We're going to go around the pinball horn.

[01:14] There's been a lot of new stuff on Naps Arcade, by the way, I just want for the record,

[01:18] everybody to know this.

[01:19] I love Naps Arcade.

[01:21] I mean, if you're not reading Naps Arcade, I don't know where you're going to see what's

[01:25] going on in the pinball world because they have taken over the top spot from this week

[01:29] in pinball. No one really goes to TWIP anymore for weekly pinball news.

[01:33] They might as well shut it down.

[01:35] I don't know how Jason Knapp gets so much information so quickly, but whatever the source,

[01:40] I'm loving it because he's doing all of the work for all of us content creators.

[01:44] And I think Jason Knapp is about to start his own podcast.

[01:48] Now, look, if there's one thing we need, it's another pinball podcast.

[01:51] My only advice to Jason, if he's listening,

[01:54] keep it short, get right to the point.

[01:56] You don't need two hours to talk about pinball.

[01:59] I also would recommend that Jason changes his microphone.

[02:02] That was the first mic I had, that Rhodes mic, but the shore mic I use now is twice as good.

[02:08] It's twice as expensive, but it's twice as good.

[02:10] OK, so let's start out this episode of Knapp's Pinball Podcast, talking about

[02:14] Haggis Pinball and what they're about to do.

[02:17] So they have teased the pinball world that they are coming out with their third title,

[02:22] their follow up to Fathom.

[02:24] Now, look, they did Celts, they did Fathom, and now they're going to do.

[02:27] Wait for it.

[02:28] It's going to be Centaur people.

[02:30] I've heard Centaur from like a million different sources.

[02:33] I fully believe it to be that.

[02:35] I know they had a teaser video that sounded like someone was playing pool.

[02:39] So maybe it's eight ball deluxe.

[02:41] Maybe they're going to do eight ball deluxe and then Centaur or Centaur, then eight ball deluxe.

[02:45] But I think it's Centaur, but that's not really the big story here.

[02:49] The big story is this.

[02:51] They have not finished making the Fathoms.

[02:53] And they need to make 250 mermaid editions of Fathom.

[02:58] And then they need to make the regular versions of the game.

[03:00] They also sold to customers.

[03:03] And I'm hearing that they have only been able to make a hundred Fathoms to date.

[03:08] So if you think about it, they've been making this game now for well over a year

[03:12] and their milestone is now 100 games.

[03:15] So if it's taking them over a year to get to a hundred Fathom mermaid editions built,

[03:21] why would they be announcing a new game right now?

[03:24] Does this make any sense whatsoever?

[03:27] If you order a game from them, you're looking at an eight to 12 month wait to get a game.

[03:33] So why would a company need to announce a new game when they still have a ton of Fathoms to make?

[03:41] Now, look, we've seen this story before.

[03:43] Everyone knows the answer as to the why, because they're clearly in need of cash.

[03:49] And they need to get in new deposits to finish building the existing Fathom orders.

[03:54] That is the only reason why you would announce another game so early like this.

[03:59] Think about it.

[04:00] This is not like a licensed property where they have to get it out contractually

[04:04] because there's going to be a movie in the theater the way Stern had to get James Bond out

[04:09] to coincide with the anniversary stuff.

[04:11] There is no reason why they would need to do this right now.

[04:14] And look, I'm just going to say this, full me once, full me twice.

[04:17] But do you really think there is anyone out there who's going to give Haggis Pimbal

[04:22] a nonrefundable deposit on game number three?

[04:26] And I went on the pin side marketplace and you can go buy a Fathom mermaid edition right now.

[04:32] So ladies and gentlemen, listen to me, even if you want game number three from Haggis,

[04:37] don't give it a positive.

[04:38] Don't even bother ordering it.

[04:40] Let someone else take the risk.

[04:42] Don't let it be you.

[04:44] And here's the good news.

[04:45] If they eventually get around to making game number three, I don't even want to

[04:49] speculate when sometime well into 2024.

[04:53] Guess what?

[04:54] You'll be able to march in, cut the line and get the game without taking any risk.

[05:00] And I think the biggest risk would be to give it a positive to this company

[05:04] after what we've seen them do over the last like two years.

[05:07] And they're still not transparent.

[05:08] They're still not showing you a factory tour.

[05:10] You have no idea how many games a week they can make.

[05:13] You have no idea how many people work there.

[05:15] And we know the answer.

[05:16] It's barely any games and barely any people.

[05:19] And so when Damien says we're on track to finish all the Fathom builds by the end

[05:24] of the year, people go back.

[05:26] He said that last year he was telling people they were going to finish all the

[05:30] mermaid editions by the end of last year.

[05:32] They didn't even come close to reaching that goal.

[05:35] So I'm just going to say buy or beware.

[05:37] And if you go in on this game, I think you need to have your head examined because

[05:41] we've seen this story unfold many times with these boutiques.

[05:44] And I can just hear Kim Mitchell texting me that I need to give Damien a chance.

[05:49] Oh, Kim, come on.

[05:50] We've seen how this works.

[05:52] They're robbing Peter to pay Paul with this kind of cash influx.

[05:55] And it's not going to work out in the end.

[05:57] They're just never going to get around the corner because for this company to get

[06:01] around the corner, they're going to have to charge way more money for their games.

[06:05] But as we can see on the secondhand market, the mermaid editions have not gone up in value.

[06:10] These things have not skyrocketed.

[06:12] These games are just not that appealing in the modern pinball world where there's

[06:17] so much other exciting stuff coming out.

[06:19] All right. So that's a heck of a pinball trying to get more money from people

[06:22] without finishing the second game.

[06:24] I don't like it and I'll never endorse this behavior.

[06:27] All right. What else is going on?

[06:29] Let's talk about Stern pinball.

[06:30] Let's talk about their next game.

[06:32] So look, it's going to be at Comic Con in less than like 20 days.

[06:36] We are going to see Stern's next title.

[06:39] Now, is it going to be a cornerstone game at Comic Con, which would be Venom?

[06:44] Now, look, there is a rumor that maybe they might have changed the theme

[06:49] from Venom to something else. It's going to be Brian Eddy.

[06:52] It's going to be Zombie Eddy.

[06:54] It's going to be a comic book themed game.

[06:57] Now, they've had some time.

[06:59] Did they change it from Venom to maybe the amazing Spiderman?

[07:03] Did they change it into the spider verse?

[07:06] I still think it's going to be Venom.

[07:08] I think whenever we get really strong Stern rumors,

[07:12] they usually end up being correct.

[07:14] Because think about it, like if they were working on Venom,

[07:17] it means they were coding Venom.

[07:18] It means they made mechs for Venom.

[07:20] It means they did artwork for Venom.

[07:22] And so I have a really hard time believing that Stern scrapped all of that

[07:26] and is going to come out with something that's not Venom.

[07:29] But here's the other rumor that if it's not Venom,

[07:32] Stern is going to unveil an anniversary edition of Jurassic Park at Comic Con.

[07:39] Now, look, Jurassic Park is arguably one of Stern's most successful properties.

[07:43] It's got Keith Elwyn.

[07:45] It had Johnny Crap on artwork.

[07:48] Now, imagine this.

[07:49] Imagine if Stern Pimbal redid Jurassic Park with Zombie Eddy on artwork

[07:54] and made it look gorgeous and put like green sparkly armor on it and gave you a

[08:00] new topper or better yet, follow their new formula, create a $2,000 topper

[08:06] that they charge you for it.

[08:07] But imagine if they bring out a Jurassic Park anniversary edition.

[08:11] And I know Jason Knapp was talking about this.

[08:13] I've been saying this for a long time, way before Jason did.

[08:17] I've been saying this.

[08:18] Stern Pimbal is going to basically SLE everything.

[08:21] They're going to do what they did with Elvira.

[08:23] And they're going to bring out anniversary editions of all of their hot games.

[08:28] And they're going to charge like $20,000 for them.

[08:31] So if they remake Jurassic Park as an anniversary game with new artwork,

[08:37] how much do you think they're going to charge for that fully featured limited game?

[08:41] Look at what they charge for James Bond 60th.

[08:44] It's funny how everyone's gotten real quiet.

[08:47] All those content creators, they know who they are, who said that Stern perfectly

[08:51] priced James Bond 60th at $20,000.

[08:55] I mean, do I need to go grab those sound clips where you know who?

[08:58] Who was saying that?

[08:59] And now all of a sudden he's selling it for 15 five as a distributor.

[09:03] What happened to 20,000 being the right price for the game?

[09:06] So look, everybody knows this.

[09:08] And I think everyone's come around to this.

[09:10] Like $20,000 is a heck of a lot of money for a Pimbal machine,

[09:14] especially if there are thousands of premiums out in the world.

[09:19] That's the same exact game.

[09:20] But if Stern changes the artwork, they're not going to change the code.

[09:24] They're not going to change the gameplay.

[09:25] But if they make Jurassic Park look super sexy and only make like 250 or 500 of them,

[09:32] I think you're going to see them charge well above $13,000 for a game like that.

[09:37] Here's the tightrope that Stern needs to walk.

[09:40] Of course, they can make money if they SLE'd everything, right?

[09:44] If they made a better version of everything, they could find new buyers to go in on these games.

[09:50] But they've got to be careful because if they burn all of the existing people

[09:55] who invested heavily in their LEs and in their signature editions or their SLEs,

[10:00] if they bring back these games again, right?

[10:04] Think about it.

[10:05] If you own a Ghostbusters LE, you don't want them to vault it.

[10:09] You don't want them to make an anniversary edition.

[10:12] You don't. Who out there wants to see their game lose value?

[10:16] Nobody. And when you're a collector, you want to collect something that is scarce,

[10:21] is rare and somewhat exclusive.

[10:23] And look, I don't think any thousand LEs are exclusive.

[10:26] I think anyone who's getting these modern LEs, where there are a thousand of them out

[10:31] in the world, I get you've got the highest version, but nothing feels exclusive.

[10:36] It's like everybody owns a Godzilla LE.

[10:38] It's like everybody owns a Foo Fighters LE.

[10:41] Anyone who wants one can have one now.

[10:43] There's no longer this like impossible to get.

[10:46] I've got to be in good with my distributor.

[10:48] No, if you want anything, you can easily get it on launch week.

[10:53] It's not nearly as hard.

[10:54] The only time it's going to be impossible is if Stern comes out with something

[10:59] like the Matrix or freaking back to the future or big trouble on Little China.

[11:03] I'll just throw it out there.

[11:05] If they come out with something that's gangbusters and dare I say,

[11:08] I'm just going to say right now, people, Barbie pinball would be amazing.

[11:12] Have you seen all of the Barbie collaborations?

[11:15] Have you seen the Xbox Barbie?

[11:18] I mean, it is unreal.

[11:20] The amount of excitement and hype this movie has and everybody loves a Barbie

[11:25] addition of something.

[11:26] I went to go to the Barbie cafe yesterday in New York City.

[11:29] Couldn't even get in. You need reservations.

[11:31] They're like sold out for like a week.

[11:33] And you're telling me that if someone made Barbie pinball,

[11:37] it would be all over the news everywhere.

[11:39] They would sell so many more Barbies than the Godfather, then Galactic Tank Force.

[11:45] They would sell more Barbies than Rush.

[11:47] They would then Led Zeppelin.

[11:49] They absolutely would.

[11:50] This theme crosses over globally on a level like almost nothing else.

[11:56] And right now would have been the perfect time to do it.

[11:59] But now that there's a Barbie movie,

[12:00] I really do think someone should option it out and make the Barbie movie pinball game.

[12:05] I mean, it would be perfect.

[12:07] All right, but you don't listen to

[12:08] Canadian to hear me gush about Barbie, even though I love the color pink.

[12:12] All right, so what else is going on?

[12:13] So we're going to see in 20 days, whether it's an anniversary edition of Jurassic

[12:18] Park or Venom, Canada is guessing that it will be Venom.

[12:22] All right, so that's what's happening over at Stern.

[12:24] And then we will most likely see another cornerstone by the end of the year,

[12:28] or they will vault something else.

[12:30] And I've been saying this on my Facebook.

[12:32] I don't think they're ever going to vault Ghostbusters.

[12:35] I don't think it's a smart vault.

[12:37] Remember, when they made Ghostbusters,

[12:39] John Trudeau was not convicted of child pornography.

[12:43] OK, now they know that.

[12:44] I don't think they're going to go within a country mile of ever vaulting this game

[12:49] again, and now that everybody knows who made the game, there's no escaping this

[12:54] people. Do you think Stern wants the headlines that they're going to remake a

[12:57] game that they know was designed by someone convicted of child pornography?

[13:02] I wouldn't go anywhere near it.

[13:04] Just give us Lord of the Rings, give us Tron, give us Metallica, give us Back to

[13:10] the Future, give us Indiana Jones.

[13:12] Oh, wait, Indiana Jones.

[13:14] We've been talking a lot about this.

[13:16] And now that I've seen the movie, I'm not going to spoil it for you,

[13:19] but I will say this, it's entertaining.

[13:22] It's not great.

[13:23] It has its flaws, but I do not want a pinball machine based on Indiana Jones

[13:29] and the Dial of Destiny.

[13:31] And I hope that Stern Pinball does not make this version of Indie.

[13:35] I hope they go back and make the original three films.

[13:38] Those are the only ones people want.

[13:40] And I know there was a rumor that maybe Jersey Jack has the Indiana Jones license

[13:45] and oh my gosh, like if Jersey Jack pinball goes from making Toy Story 4

[13:50] to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, they might as well just close the doors.

[13:56] Nobody wants this version of Indiana Jones.

[14:00] So if somebody is making Indie, I really hope they're making the original version.

[14:05] Now look, I've known about this Indie rumor for a while.

[14:08] So I think there's a good chance it's going to be based on the old Indie properties

[14:12] because the game is already in development.

[14:15] I don't think it's going to be based on this movie.

[14:17] I hope it's not based on this movie.

[14:19] Come on, Stern, give us what we want.

[14:21] Oh, all right.

[14:22] So Indiana Jones coming sometime in 2024.

[14:26] Is it another anniversary?

[14:27] I mean, almost every year is the anniversary of some big property.

[14:31] So we will see this will be a never ending speculation train.

[14:35] So talking about speculation,

[14:36] our boy Don got covered on Naps Arcade for the first time with his rumor

[14:41] that Ben Heck is making Monty Python as a collaboration between Spooky Pinball

[14:47] and Chicago Gaming Company.

[14:49] Now look, we've known about Ben Heck's collaboration with CGC and Spooky for like two years now.

[14:55] And here's the thing, as much as it might be Monty Python,

[14:58] I don't think you're ever going to see this game anytime soon.

[15:01] You might see it like in 2025, but I can guarantee you

[15:06] this game is not coming out this year.

[15:08] It is not coming out next year, because if you talk to Ben Heck, he will tell you

[15:13] the game is basically in whitewood form in his basement, but Chicago Gaming

[15:18] Company is so backlogged, there is no way this thing is coming up.

[15:22] They've got to finish making all of these cactus canyons.

[15:25] Then they've got to make all of these freaking pulp fictions.

[15:28] And we know that there are way more pulp fictions on order than there are of cactus

[15:33] canyon. And so if Ben Heck's game is going to come out, I don't think we see it until

[15:38] 2025. And here's the thing with pulp fiction.

[15:40] We now have an update on when they're going to make the games.

[15:43] They're going to start making the regular version of the game sometime this year.

[15:47] They're going to put some on location with dollar bill accepting coin doors.

[15:51] Let's get more people excited to buy one and then not make them for customers.

[15:55] What a great marketing strategy.

[15:56] I don't even know why they launched this game in March, because the L.

[15:59] Lees of this game are not going to go on the line.

[16:02] Wait for it until February of 2024.

[16:06] That is almost one year between taking people's money and making the damn product.

[16:12] Why did they announce it? It wasn't like it was an anniversary.

[16:15] It didn't have to be at TPF.

[16:18] I mean, they might as well have brought it to TPF 2024.

[16:22] I mean, it's in March.

[16:23] Like why even do it in 2023?

[16:25] I have absolutely no clue why this company ushered this thing out when they did.

[16:31] Now, that being said, I think everyone who ordered one is happy to wait.

[16:35] And, you know, CGC is eventually going to get you your game.

[16:40] We all hope we get our games before we pass away or get hit by a bus.

[16:44] But Chicago gaming company needs to figure something out.

[16:46] I just don't get it.

[16:47] Like the demand is there.

[16:49] They know they have orders.

[16:50] Why can't they just hire more people or expand their line?

[16:54] I don't understand what they're doing over there.

[16:56] And we never hear anything from Ryan White or Doug over there or anybody.

[17:00] They just keep you in the dark more than any other pinball company out there.

[17:04] You know, why don't these guys like partner up with someone else?

[17:06] I mean, seriously, it's like nobody's ordering the Godfather and they've got a

[17:10] huge line at Jersey Jack and everybody wants Pulp Fiction.

[17:14] Why don't they just get the damn workers over at JJP to make the Pulp Fiction games?

[17:18] I mean, let's just get together.

[17:19] Kumbaya, this whole pinball thing under one roof and build all the games in one

[17:24] mega factory. It just makes total sense.

[17:27] No one cares.

[17:28] Nobody cares.

[17:28] They just want qualified people on the line putting a game together.

[17:32] All pinball is just plastic parts and metal parts being screwed into a wood

[17:37] play field, going into a wooden cabinet.

[17:39] It's all the same.

[17:40] It's all the same.

[17:41] Once you teach someone how to build a pinball machine, they can build anybody's

[17:45] pinball machine.

[17:46] So all these boutique companies trying to do separate manufacturing is absolutely

[17:50] ridiculous. They should all just get together and build it under one roof and

[17:53] save money on it because then they would have the line always going and they'd

[17:57] have the best trained employees making the products.

[17:59] No, let's not do that.

[18:01] Let's rent a big factory in freaking Australia and with four people try to

[18:06] build pinball machines. Hello, Haggis.

[18:08] American Pinball is another company.

[18:10] They're just trickling out games like where are the games?

[18:13] Where are the galactic tank forces?

[18:14] They're really not flying off the shelves.

[18:16] Look, more and more people are starting to play the game.

[18:18] Again, galactic tank force to me is just a fun game.

[18:21] Don't want to own it.

[18:22] And that's that.

[18:23] I don't know how they're going to get people reignited into this game or get

[18:26] people excited about it.

[18:28] I did see that Christopher Franci is doing the artwork for Fantastic up there

[18:32] in Massachusetts and the artwork for the show is just the galactic tank force art.

[18:37] I'm like, what's going on here?

[18:38] There's not even any pinball really on the flyer itself.

[18:42] I mean, what? Like, where's the work?

[18:43] You're just dragging and dropping galactic tank force art to this show.

[18:47] That's yesterday's news.

[18:49] This game came out in March of 2023.

[18:51] Why are we still promoting it in the fall of 2023?

[18:54] Look, American Pinball knows the only answer now is they need to get to Ryan

[18:59] McQuade's game, which is based on a licensed theme.

[19:02] They're going to sell more of that game than they will ever sell of galactic

[19:06] tank force, and they never should have made galactic tank force.

[19:09] I'm sorry, people.

[19:10] I know I don't mean to be a Debbie Downer about it,

[19:12] but you got to give the people what they want.

[19:15] And clearly the people don't really want this stuff.

[19:18] So speaking of giving people what they want, Twilight Zone remake.

[19:22] I mean, I've been saying that the Twilight Zone is coming back.

[19:25] Rick at Planetary Pinball has the parts for all of these games,

[19:29] and they are going to remake the Twilight Zone.

[19:32] The question is, who's making it?

[19:33] Is it going to be a pre-gaming?

[19:35] Is it going to be somebody else?

[19:36] I don't know, but it's coming back.

[19:38] We're going to get Twilight Zone again.

[19:40] We're going to get more Big Bang bars.

[19:42] We're going to get more Theater of Magics.

[19:43] We're going to get more Totens.

[19:45] It's all happening, people.

[19:46] Now, the crazy part is this.

[19:48] All of these remakes are coming out on top of everything coming out from all

[19:54] the other companies.

[19:55] And when you step back and you look at the pinball landscape,

[19:58] how is it going to absorb all of this at these prices?

[20:02] That's the thing that keeps me up at night when I think about pinball.

[20:05] It's not that we're not in this new golden era of pinball.

[20:08] We are.

[20:08] There's more companies than ever before.

[20:10] And then we're bringing back the old stuff that's classic and our masterpieces.

[20:14] But then you think about it.

[20:16] Who's buying all of these?

[20:18] Who has the room for all of these machines?

[20:20] When you start to think about a world in which three stern premiums are now going

[20:26] to cost you $30,000, it starts to seem kind of crazy.

[20:31] Three stern LEs with a topper is going to cost you anywhere from 45 to $50,000.

[20:39] These are the numbers that distros don't want you to think about,

[20:42] that my content creator friends don't want you to think about.

[20:45] You want to spend 45 to $50,000 to fully accessorize three stern LE

[20:53] machines that are not even that rare.

[20:56] And you're telling me that prices are not going to start to really go soft in this

[21:00] hobby pretty quickly once the hangover happens.

[21:04] And it's going to happen.

[21:05] We are still just at the beginning of spending the most money we've ever spent

[21:11] on mass produced games.

[21:13] These aren't like rare, hip restored games.

[21:16] Stern is laughing all the way to the bank.

[21:19] I got a really great email from Peter G.

[21:22] And he basically was like, Chris, I can't believe you gave Stern an A when you

[21:26] candidly ranked all the pinball companies.

[21:29] And he went on to say all the reasons why they don't deserve an A.

[21:32] And I kind of agree a little bit.

[21:34] Right. Like the stern deserve an A.

[21:35] I mean, these games are so expensive.

[21:37] When you think about the biggest themes they've been making recently,

[21:40] like they haven't really knocked the big themes out of the park,

[21:43] stuff like Mandalorian and Star Wars.

[21:46] Right. I mean, they really fumbled a lot of major properties.

[21:50] And when you look at a game like Foo Fighters, sure, it shoots amazingly well.

[21:54] But do you see 10 to $13,000 under the hood of that game?

[21:59] And that's where we're at, people.

[22:00] I mean, look, they're going to win on artwork.

[22:02] They're going to win on gameplay.

[22:04] They're going to win on coding and animations.

[22:06] I mean, look, they're doing a lot right.

[22:08] But like for these prices, right, are we just looking for a lot right?

[22:12] Or are we looking for real value, right?

[22:15] In bill of materials and engineering and stuff we've never seen before in pinball.

[22:20] And wow, moments in a pinball machine.

[22:22] And look, it's up to each and every one of us.

[22:24] For me personally, at these prices, I am just waiting now for dream themes.

[22:30] If it's not a dream theme,

[22:32] I will happily go to a bar and play it.

[22:34] I will happily go to a pinball show and play it.

[22:37] I will happily find a friend who owns it and play it.

[22:40] But for this much money, how can you plunk down like 10 grand on a premium?

[22:44] I mean, when you think about premiums, I'm really worried about premium buyers

[22:48] because I think every single storm premium, now that they are absolutely going

[22:53] to make thousands of them, if you pay 10 grand for a storm premium,

[22:57] congratulations, you're going to lose $2,000 in a year.

[22:59] And I think you're going to lose $3,000 like past a year.

[23:02] So is everyone going to be comfortable losing two to $3,000 on every single

[23:07] premium purchase? I don't think people are.

[23:09] I really don't think people are.

[23:11] I think it's going to create more of a two tier model where you're either going

[23:15] to want to get the L.E. because your money is at least safer because there's not as

[23:19] many or you're just going to pass on the game altogether.

[23:22] And I think for most people out there, you're like me, you're just going to wait

[23:25] for something that really speaks to you on a theme level.

[23:28] And of course, we want Stern to get great themes and knock it out of the park

[23:32] like Godzilla. We want that because Stern has the best gameplay.

[23:36] We would love it if Jersey Jack Pinball can now combine the better gameplay.

[23:41] Right. The flippers feel better.

[23:43] Godfather shoots better than any other Jersey Jack game.

[23:46] They just built it on a theme nobody wants.

[23:48] So Jersey Jack, the ball's in your court.

[23:50] Like we're all waiting to see what you do with Steve Ritchie.

[23:53] We hope it's not Elton John.

[23:54] We hope it's the Matrix, but we all saw what you did with Toy Story.

[23:58] You killed our Toy Story dreams.

[24:00] Nobody wanted Godfather.

[24:01] We're glad it took you 10 years to learn how to get the flipper feel right.

[24:05] But now that you've got the flipper feel right.

[24:07] You've got the billionaire backer.

[24:09] You've got the guy who's the king of pinball designing games for you.

[24:13] You've got a young buck in this guy, Mark, who made Metroid pinball and seemingly

[24:17] nothing else that we still think is going to crush it.

[24:19] OK, we hear you might have the license for Harry Potter for Top Gun for all these

[24:24] things, the Matrix, all we're waiting for Jersey Jack.

[24:27] We really do want to give you our money, but you got to do this.

[24:30] You got to make a great theme.

[24:32] You got to have great gameplay.

[24:34] You got to turn off the freaking multi-balls every single freaking two minutes.

[24:38] And then you got to finish your code and you got to make the games look sexy.

[24:41] And guess what? You're not really overpriced.

[24:44] You've just overpriced games that aren't worth it.

[24:47] Your games should be going for $15,000.

[24:50] If you actually made all of those things happen in a single title,

[24:54] you've been doing it for a decade.

[24:56] There's no longer any excuses.

[24:58] And you idiotically jacked the prices up on two games.

[25:03] Nobody really wanted who thought that was a good marketing move.

[25:07] Damn, Canada dropping bombs on J.J.P. again.

[25:10] And look, I've watched my guns and roses collectors edition just plummet, plummet

[25:15] in like value. I mean, look, it's still not worth less than 12.5.

[25:19] But these things were going for 20 grand, 18 grand easily when that game came out.

[25:24] Now you can start to get CEs for 13, 5, 13 on the table.

[25:29] I bet takes one.

[25:30] And it's just going to keep sinking further and further because over time,

[25:35] guns and roses is a game that's not aging well, people.

[25:38] It's not like the word of mouth on it is like they're not addressing the code.

[25:42] They're not even thinking about how they could address the code a little bit.

[25:46] They're not even thinking about mitigating the amount of multi-balls and balancing

[25:50] the score and trying different things to breathe new life into the game.

[25:53] And then maybe give a flipper kit so people who own guns and roses can get the

[25:58] good flipper feel that's in the Godfather.

[26:00] They don't even talk about this stuff.

[26:02] That's the problem with J.J.P.

[26:03] is most people own a guns and roses who own a Jersey Jack machine.

[26:08] You need to treat those customers the best.

[26:11] Stop sending out spam emails from your distributors that they've got one

[26:16] Godfather LE left. We all know that's a lie.

[26:20] Every single distributor is sitting on Godfather LE's in a box for $12,000

[26:26] that nobody wants.

[26:27] So congratulations.

[26:29] You immediately evaporated like $1,500 in value from your customers who

[26:33] trusted you on day one.

[26:35] And now the distros are selling opened up Godfathers for 10.5 and we know

[26:40] it's going to go to 10.

[26:41] Then it's going to go to 9,500.

[26:43] Then nine.

[26:43] I mean, trust me, it's a falling knife game, people.

[26:47] I mean, just think about it like this.

[26:48] You could summarize the Godfather and I know you can turn this mode off,

[26:51] but you can summarize their strategy on the Godfather with one simple sentence.

[26:58] Nobody who loves the Godfather wants to battle a mob boss based after Christopher

[27:05] Franchi.

[27:05] The moment you thought that was a good creative idea, you have basically

[27:10] telegraphed, you don't know what you're doing with this kind of theme and that

[27:13] your team didn't really want to make it.

[27:15] And they had to come up with silly things.

[27:16] Like if you make Top Gun and like Ken Cromwell is your wingman or Jack

[27:21] Winari is down on the deck of the aircraft carrier, you know, waving at you to land.

[27:25] I mean, come on, you can't do it.

[27:26] You're not allowed to do it.

[27:27] You're not allowed to put your employees into an iconic franchise's game.

[27:32] I'm sorry.

[27:32] I don't want to see Maverick talking to Lieutenant Barlow because Franchi did

[27:36] the artwork in the game.

[27:37] It's not what you do.

[27:38] You can't Easter egg yourself into these games like this.

[27:41] What else is going on?

[27:42] There's a rumor that we might be getting a fast and the furious pinball machine.

[27:46] Look, I love these movies.

[27:48] I think for it to be done right, I think you're going to have to get the

[27:51] assets from the film.

[27:53] The only issue with this franchise is there's now what, like 10 movies?

[27:57] Like how are you going to cram 10 movies worth of content into a pinball machine?

[28:02] If I was going to do fast and furious, I think you could just do the first one

[28:05] and do it right and make it a celebration of the first film's release.

[28:09] I mean, that's the one that had most of the iconic lines and everybody who loves

[28:14] the fast and furious sort of loves it because of what that film did.

[28:18] But if you try to do all of them, I think it becomes too much content to deal with.

[28:22] I'm also okay with there not being a fast and furious pinball machine as much

[28:27] as I love the films.

[28:28] It's not a dream theme for me to own a fast and furious pinball machine.

[28:32] I just don't like automotive pinball machines or something about it.

[28:36] I would much rather have an Akira transformers, even like he man, just stuff

[28:40] where there's more of a physical world under glass.

[28:42] Because if you think about fast and furious, how are you going to make

[28:45] a physical world under glass that really brings that franchise to life?

[28:50] Like, I don't know how you do it.

[28:51] There's nothing from like an environment standpoint that just jumps out at you.

[28:55] And I think the best pinball themes, there's something about the world

[28:59] under glass that you could just see it.

[29:01] Like if you made Akira and you did Neo Tokyo under glass, trust me, people,

[29:05] it'd be crazy.

[29:06] If you did Barbie and you had Barbie's pink world under glass, it would be amazing.

[29:10] If you did he man and had Castle Grace Skull.

[29:12] It would be amazing.

[29:13] Right.

[29:14] But if you think about fast and furious, I don't really know what's under that

[29:17] glass.

[29:17] The same is true with like John Wick.

[29:19] Right.

[29:19] It's like, I don't really know what you put in John Wick.

[29:22] And then it becomes all on the LCD screen.

[29:25] And I just don't like that.

[29:26] I don't like the way pinball lately is just flat artwork.

[29:30] And then everything is on the screen in terms of environmental stuff.

[29:34] I want to see more environments and more worlds underneath that glass.

[29:38] And I don't think we're seeing as much as we should for this much money.

[29:42] I mean, look at Godfather, right?

[29:44] But again, bad theme.

[29:45] There's nothing in the Godfather that would jump out at you.

[29:48] But if you did top gun and you had a freaking aircraft carrier underneath the

[29:52] glass and that's how you fired the ball.

[29:54] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[29:56] If the whole right side of that game, a wide body game and the right side was a

[30:00] huge aircraft carrier and that's how you launched Maverick into battle.

[30:05] You could take $30,000 from me tomorrow, Jersey Jack.

[30:10] If that's what you made.

[30:11] I'd rather have one $30,000 freaking Maverick aircraft carrier game than a

[30:18] Godfather CE and a Toy Story CE, which would cost me $30,000.

[30:24] And I think Jersey Jack pinball should just do what I've been saying for years.

[30:28] They should make just 1000 of every game they make.

[30:32] Think about it.

[30:33] And they have the greatest market research ever to show that if they did that,

[30:37] they could easily charge $20,000 or more per game because the market research is

[30:43] called Pirates of the Caribbean.

[30:45] So imagine if Jersey Jack pinball said, we're making top gun.

[30:48] We're only making a thousand, 250 CEs and 750 LEs.

[30:54] The CEs are $25,000 and the LEs are $20,000 and it's top gun.

[31:00] Think about what would happen.

[31:02] They would sell out instantly.

[31:04] They would put more than enough money in their pocket, more than they're going to

[31:07] put in their pocket for games like Godfather and games like Toy Story.

[31:11] That's over $20 million in their pocket on a game that's not going to cost them

[31:16] nearly that much to R&D and create.

[31:19] And then also they're not stuck making the same game for 18 months.

[31:23] And here's the crazy part.

[31:24] And they could sell every single one of those games directly, sell them directly,

[31:28] just sell them directly and put all the money in your pocket.

[31:31] They're not going to do any of this.

[31:32] I could just see my friend Joe Newhart at pinball star being like, Chris,

[31:35] what are you doing?

[31:36] Why are you recommending they sell their games directly?

[31:39] Joe, don't worry.

[31:40] Jersey Jack Pinball will never take any of my valuable advice.

[31:45] They are always going to do it their way.

[31:47] Chris, stop the Jersey Jack Bash.

[31:49] What are you doing?

[31:50] It's a holiday weekend.

[31:51] We're all excited for pinball.

[31:53] I'm excited to.

[31:54] All right.

[31:54] What else is going on in pinball?

[31:55] Anything we're missing?

[31:57] There's more Godzilla premiums on the lines.

[32:00] There's some Halloween code updates.

[32:01] So if you have a Halloween update your code, I still don't know

[32:05] how that game is going to shoot any better, but it is what it is.

[32:08] At least spooky pinball continues to improve its code.

[32:11] Well, after the game is out, I think all pinball companies should do that.

[32:16] Everybody, it's going to be a crazy July in pinball

[32:19] because we're going to see a new machine from Stern.

[32:21] And whenever Stern does this, it creates seismic shifts in the pinball marketplace.

[32:26] It gets everybody excited.

[32:27] Are we going to see people put food fighters up for sale?

[32:30] Are people loving food fighters?

[32:31] Is food fighters a keeper?

[32:32] It's a great shooting game.

[32:34] But if you don't love the band, are you going to keep it?

[32:36] Are you going to try to move it on?

[32:38] I think with so much happening in pinball, all of these stern games coming out,

[32:42] the next game from JJP will also be this year.

[32:45] We're going to start to see pulp fictions.

[32:47] There's like 12 companies trying to make pinball machines.

[32:49] And then we're going to remake all these classic games.

[32:52] You're going to have to free up room and free up money.

[32:55] I love not buying anything pinball now because I love watching my checking

[33:00] account just go up and up and up.

[33:02] And then I feel better when I have more money and I'm going to jump in again.

[33:06] When it's a dream theme that checks all the boxes for me.

[33:10] Until then, I'll keep doing this show.

[33:12] I'll keep covering the hobby.

[33:13] I'll keep telling you how I feel about these games and these companies, but no

[33:18] way would I buy something unless it checks all of the boxes, especially at these prices.

[33:23] Everybody have a great 4th of July holiday.

[33:26] Have a great time tomorrow with your families.

[33:28] Canada's pinball podcast back on the airwaves more shows this week.

[33:32] And thank you so much for the support.

[33:34] I love having each and every one of you here.

[33:36] So thank you and have a great day.
