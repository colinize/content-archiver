[00:00] Canada! Hey!

[00:02] You again!

[00:04] Okay! Wait!

[00:15] Alright ladies and gentlemen, here we are, down in New Orleans.

[00:20] Canadian Pimball Podcast, I have my second guest who was awesome enough to invite

[00:27] Brenda and myself down to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras.

[00:31] Talking about no other than Tiger Law, one of the coolest moderators on Pinside.

[00:37] I think having Canada hanging out with the moderators, a little bit like Kyle O'Ren and Finn having a picnic together,

[00:42] but we're having a good time down here. I want to welcome to the show Tiger Law.

[00:47] Thank you very much. Glad you made it down to New Orleans with a great night last night,

[00:51] looking forward to catching a parade later today.

[00:54] I must say I think I ate more fried food and sugary drinks last night than I have in the last year,

[00:59] so I might be a little bit diabetic during this conversation, but it was a great night for sure.

[01:05] Can I call you Tiger? Is that okay?

[01:08] Yeah, absolutely.

[01:09] Alright, and we won't mistake you for Tiger Woods.

[01:11] I was told not to bring up any Tiger Wood Quotes, so we're going to keep it.

[01:15] You're the new Tiger in town.

[01:17] Give us a little bit about your background. I know you're a lawyer, what are you from,

[01:22] and give the listeners out there just a quick synopsis of who you are.

[01:28] Sure, sure. From Louisiana, born and raised, I went to Tulane,

[01:34] and also went to undergrad out in Washington State, beautiful Pacific Northwest.

[01:39] Love it out there. I head back up there about four times a year and I go over to Portland, Oregon,

[01:44] and occasionally up to Seattle, great place.

[01:48] But home is home, Louisiana is home, and I divide time between two beautiful cities in Louisiana, New Orleans, and Lake Charles.

[01:56] I have to say, New Orleans is just...

[02:00] If you haven't been to New Orleans people and listeners, it's an amazing city.

[02:05] We're here right now during the heart of Mardi Gras, which is absolutely insanity,

[02:10] but there's great restaurants, there's great foods. I think it's your blessed man Tiger to be able to live in such a cool city for half a year.

[02:17] And you're most well known on Pinside for being a Pinside moderator.

[02:24] So I want to sort of break up our conversation into two parts.

[02:27] I want to talk to you about what it's like being a moderator, and then I want to talk to you about Pimball in general,

[02:33] and collecting Pimball machines and how you got into Pimball.

[02:36] Let's start out with being a moderator.

[02:39] How does one become a Pinside moderator?

[02:42] I feel like it's like asking someone, how does one become a Jedi?

[02:45] How did you acquire the skills to become a moderator? Talk us through it.

[02:51] So I guess the process is somewhat changed over the years, and I've been a moderator since June of 2013.

[02:59] And at that point, I'd been on Pinside since I guess 2009 or so.

[03:04] And so I've been on there for a few years, been posting quite a bit.

[03:08] And at that time, I just, in my PM box, got a message from Robin that just said, Tiger Law moderator question mark.

[03:16] And I clicked on that, opened it up, and I had a very nice message from Robin saying that he'd been following my posting for some time,

[03:25] and that he wanted to know if I had any interest in being a moderator.

[03:29] If I had any questions about what that would entail, and I responded that I was interested in being a moderator.

[03:35] And that was pretty much that at the time, and I became a moderator within just a couple days after that.

[03:42] The process is a bit more in depth now. We have a very good moderator slash detective, PM Wolf, who goes through applications and whatnot.

[03:53] And he just added two moderators last week, Jim and Forceflow.

[03:58] And PM Wolfs started a thread to have people who were interested in being a moderator.

[04:04] It's an application, and then he went through the application, and he did a very thorough background check on everybody in there.

[04:11] And they're posting history and what not PM Wolfs are really good at this.

[04:15] And he ideally just wanted a moderator for the European time zone that way we would have someone to help Chris B with what we call the night shift of PINSIDE when there's not a whole lot of posting, but occasionally you still need moderation done.

[04:30] And Chris B is our Australian representative on the PINSIDE staff. And so many times he is the only moderator online during the period while the Western Hemisphere is asleep.

[04:42] So we wanted a European out there as well. And so we added Jim from France and then also during the application process, we came across Forceflow and his resume and his in his posting history were too good to pass up.

[04:57] So we added him as a moderator as well.

[04:59] Okay. So how many how many moderators are there currently on PINSIDE?

[05:04] I believe there are 12 at this moment with the addition of Forceflow and Jim.

[05:08] And how many how many users does the site currently have?

[05:12] That's a good question. And at any point in time you can check out PINSIDE's forum posting page and see how many members are online and how many guests are online.

[05:22] And usually during the peak hours there's somewhere between 500 and 625 members. And I never really look at the guest number, but maybe 300 more guests.

[05:32] Okay. So it's a very very elite club, the moderation club. I feel like what do you think the chances are one day that canator will get that that email.

[05:42] Canator want to be a moderator question mark on a scale of one to 10. How much hope should I have that all that canator could one day be a moderator?

[05:50] Negative three.

[05:53] Okay. So there's still hope that I was thinking negative five. So would someone becomes a moderator? Is there is an initiation process?

[06:03] Do they have sort of like are you on probation and robin sort of looking over to make sure that everything's going well?

[06:08] Do you get a stake dinner? Is there a badge that gets pinned on you? What is it like when you when you finally get that privilege?

[06:15] And is it hard when you become a moderator because you have to sort of change your behavior as a poster? Now you can no longer maybe jump in and be as sarcastic as before. What's that initiation like?

[06:27] Well, there were a few questions there. Let me try to approach them separately. I'll start with changing your posting habits and you absolutely do.

[06:37] And so being a moderator is it's very rewarding in its own way, but you can't come down quite as hard as you as you may want to on certain subjects.

[06:47] You have to stay more neutral and you have to you can't be as funny or as risque or as controversial as you may have liked to have done before.

[06:57] And by the way, back on P and Woltz background checks, I'm very lucky I was a moderator before P and Woltz because I would have never passed his background checks.

[07:07] He does. They're very thorough. You know, he likes to say what he's doing. These these background checks on people that he doesn't like to wear pants for the weekend.

[07:17] So he stays at home and reuse your posting history. But yeah, yeah, you have to post more neutral and you're no longer just one of the boys, you know, you have to put on the badge and really one of the worst things is when you have to moderate people that you may agree with what they're saying in some way, shape or farm.

[07:35] And you know, you still have to send them a warning or boot them from a thread or whatever, even if you agree with what they're saying.

[07:41] And that's a tough thing to get used to, but you eventually adapt to it.

[07:45] Right. Is there a is there an award at the end of the year for the moderator issues the most threatagex? Do you guys think they're like sort of like an SPs for the moderator staff?

[07:55] No, we don't like threat ejecting people. We don't like moderating people. You know, we wish everybody would get long and played by the rules.

[08:04] And you know, there's always an any sort of message board form, whether it's a sports form or what not. There's always a sense of a power hungry mod that enjoys moderating people and issuing threatagex and showing their power and whatnot.

[08:21] That really couldn't be further from the case. None of the moderators enjoy having to do that. It's just part of the job. And you know, you get used to it.

[08:29] Right. And actually I had the pleasure of talking to Robin recently when I was frozen for a couple weeks for creating a duplicate account.

[08:39] And I was I was I was amazed at how nice and down to earth and just an incredible person. He is what what's it like working for Robin knowing that he's sort of the boss of the moderation staff and sort of as, you know, what's your experience been like working with Robin?

[08:54] Robin is a really neat guy. He's actually one of the most interesting people I've encountered on the internet over the years and he's very intelligent and he is very nice and thoughtful.

[09:07] And he's a good guy to work for. And he sets out the parameters for the moderators to follow. But he's not hard and fast on them. He will change his approach with how he deals with things based upon the feedback he received.

[09:23] From the users and from some of the moderators and whatnot. And so what will have periods of time where where Robin feels that the site has gotten to to unfriendly.

[09:35] And so he'll he'll send a mandate for the moderators to be a bit stricter and how they enforce things and whatnot. And then occasionally he'll get feedback that we we may be over moderating the site to some extent.

[09:47] And then he'll he'll he'll give us a message to maybe take the pedal off the gas or your foot off the pedal so to speak and have a bit looser moderation.

[09:57] And he's pretty insightful with how he how he views the site. Robin spends a lot of time with Pennside. It dominates his his work day.

[10:07] And he does a good job with the site is always introducing new features and truly a pleasure to work with Robin.

[10:13] Right. And I think I think you just brought up an interesting point because as as someone who's definitely a hyper user of the site finding that right balance between being overmoderated where you take away.

[10:27] You take away you know someone to the sarcasm and some of just the child is juvenile behavior that we all sort of resort to that makes the site fun and entertaining.

[10:37] If you overmoderate that I think if people lose some of that entertainment value, but if you let too much of it go, we have a site that is just full of half naked women, right. So I know there was an initiative.

[10:50] So I think it was sometime last year where it was there was sort of a desire by Robin and the staff to make the site more family friendly, more gender friendly.

[11:00] And do you think that has worked? Have you noticed I know that definitely there's a lot less boop picks on Pennside.

[11:08] But how are you guys sort of do you measure that at all? Do you sort of you know gauge the success of that initiative and what are your thoughts on that.

[11:18] So Robin may have a metric that he uses to gauge whether or not we're adding more female participants to the page. I'm not certain if he does or not.

[11:30] But I think really we weren't what while we certainly would like to have more female participants on on Pennside, we think that'd be great.

[11:38] You know what women are an important part of the pinball hobby. I think generally with regards to the boob pictures, we wanted to more of a family friendly site where people who are at work could open a thread without the fear of seeing anachronicava in a brawl.

[11:54] Right. Right. And and and also you know people use Pennside at home and they have wives and you know they don't want their they don't want their wife walking by as they're shuffling through three pages of half naked ladies.

[12:07] It's less than ideal for those users at home who may have children or wives walking by looking right in the internet. You know so.

[12:16] I wonder if any if Pennside has led to any relationship breakups because of of the boob pictures. There was a time when any thread that had reached sort of its fatigue level that it would the boob pic would just be the default right that.

[12:34] Okay bring on the boob pics there's nothing left to say you know we were talking earlier today about the ghostbusters thread and how that thread is now 69 pages long completely derailed into a relevant stage now because there's nothing left to talk about.

[12:50] So it turns into either it would have turned into a boob pic page but now it seems to have turned into just people battling each other. Do you guys sometimes you know how do you deal with threads when they just seem to start spiraling at it.

[13:03] I just saw this morning there was a Hitler video on the ghostbusters thread and then it turns into people questioning if that's appropriate. Do you guys really monitor closely some of these threads that are on fire and are no longer being talked about in a relevant way.

[13:23] Sure and it's really a case by case basis that there are 12 moderators and in all 12 of us have a different approach to how we moderate the page and it's impossible to have uniformity between 12 people particularly when most of us have not met each other in person.

[13:38] I guess there was a big meeting of a lot of the moderators last year at the expo but it's tough to decide how you're going to moderate a thread like ghostbusters and you definitely want to come in and stop the personal attacks on other pen ciders when someone comes in and says someone is stupid or whatever it's one thing to say a situation is silly or ridiculous.

[14:00] It's another thing to come in and call somebody a name and we're trying to be tougher on that we want to end the name calling because the name calling is really what leads to personal vendetta's and you know people stalking each other down voting everything they post and it gets out of hand pretty quickly and you know some threads are really tough to moderate.

[14:20] Great I've been one of the one of the moderators it's more involved in the predator thread and the J pop the red and let me tell you those threads are not fun to to read every single post that comes up on them but I have and you know it just it just depends on which threads you're going into and what you're seeing and again sometimes people say things that you may agree with but you got to moderate them anyway

[14:49] because they broke the broker rule and you know you're implementing the rules as they are set forth to us.

[14:54] Right and some of those threads that you just mentioned are just toxic wastelands at this point J pop and predator you know you go into those threads and you've got nothing but bad news to find right now I don't think I've seen a positive update on any of the legal proceedings that are supposedly occurring as a lawyer I mean what are your thoughts on is

[15:18] is just knowing that you have a legal background do you feel just in your personal opinion that people ever see any refund from those two situations and how long might that take.

[15:31] It's so hard to say I really have an analyzed either case or looked at what the attorneys who are handling those two cases respectively are analyzing and what their approach is and you know I've of course heard a lot of rumors about how Kevin

[15:47] might have spent the money on predator and what not and I don't know if any of them are true and you know I don't know if there's anything to receive that's it's it's there's a lot of saying it's hard to squeeze blood from a turnover or water from a rock and you know it's it's one thing to have liability it's another thing to be able to collect and so I I think the liability looks pretty clear the damages are pretty clear in both of those two situations but whether or not there'll be something to collect.

[16:16] It's going to be a question of the laws of those specific states and you know it's right I wouldn't want to take a guess on that and that we are everyone hopes that people see something in return but it it hopefully you know there'll be a resolution in the near future but it doesn't look too good.

[16:37] So let me ask you a question I just do you what do you think would happen if if Pinside moderation went away completely what would the site look like if it was modern moderation free so on for a month.

[16:48] RGP 100% now I think that I think it would to create pretty quickly moderation is important for a highly drafted site because otherwise the trolls will just take over and you would see a lot more name calling people could really look at it.

[17:06] I think I think that the same calling people could really tough behind a keyboard when they're they're talking to others that they think they'll never meet in person and it's it's not a good thing moderation does help and it's the only way a large site can survive long term.

[17:20] For for someone who wasn't around during the RGP era and I hear that sort of site brought up at times what what so that was what a Google was it a Google hangout site as a Google forum and it just

[17:35] borrowed that to control became a place where just tons of vitriol and anger and abusive behavior occurred like what how would you define that what that community was like or and it's still around today right.

[17:48] Oh yeah and you can still search the old threads there and by the way there's a lot of great tech help out there that's on the RGP site and I don't want to say anything too bad about it but it was a non moderated page and so you would have a

[18:04] couple people that were very vocal and some of which were pretty good debaters and you'd go in there and they might cut you down but you know site still around you can go and log on over there and start posting.

[18:19] Okay. If definitely not as user friendly as pins that I will give Robin credit out of all the forms I go on and I'm on the Guns of Rose's forum on the Hellcat forum on I kind of want to say I'm on clav as a secret agent.

[18:33] I have as a secret as a secret user know go try and find me guys but I will say pin slides layout is great and I think it it lends to people's almost like a diction and going on it because of how easy it is to navigate the threads and see the recent activity as a user I think I always go on and just see like where's where's the green.

[18:56] Where's the green number appearing in terms of recent activity on a thread I'm on so I definitely think pin slides is incredibly user friendly what I'm one one thing that I did sort of notice that shift it was the off topic posting and we've been talking a little bit about that this weekend on how off topic posting is now sort of moved to the basement it's harder to find I'm under the personal belief that I like the off topic posting because it gives you a little bit more of a wider.

[19:25] It allows you to see more of the community and what they're into and creates conversation that allows things to sort of take place that aren't always about pinball I know we were talking a lot about cars for one point but now it seems like off topic posting is is buried buried buried deep in the basement what are your thoughts on off topic posting and the topic in general.

[19:52] Well you know that's an interesting subject and there's a lot of different ways to view it I think I'm I'm of the perception that off topic posting is usually pretty good on any form because it does help you bond with other people in the community pinballs a very spread out hobby you know there are not a lot of collectors are not a lot of hobbyists in the country and so a lot of times the only way you can interact with the community that I think is going to be a lot more of a problem than the public community.

[20:16] And so a lot of times the only way you can interact with another person in your hobby if they're 2000 miles away is is through the forum or maybe Facebook or some other media of online communication but generally speaking pinside is a great way for people to get to know each other become friends even if they may never see each other and to put that in comparison if you look at say a sports forum like if you look at say one of the LSU forms I'm on the top of the list.

[20:46] And so you can get to know the other event and so you know you can get to know them personally.

[20:52] Most of the people over 90% or in Louisiana and you can meet them pretty easily at a tailgate party or at a game or at any other event and so you know you can get to know them personally.

[21:06] Pinside and the pinball community is so spread out there are a lot of collectors in California and in New York and I may never talk to them unless I talk to them on pinside and so the only way to get to know these people is to see some of their discussion.

[21:21] That is non pinball related and to that end the off topic discussion allows you to do that and so you're able to see what other hobbies people are in you're into watches great they got to watch the red you're into guns great they got a gun threat you into cars did you just buy a hell cat.

[21:38] I know somebody who started to thread on a hell cat and so you're able to get to see more about someone's personality and someone's interests and the only way you're going to do that is through off topic posting I mean how much can you talk about Ghostbusters mechanisms and and get to know what someone's real real personality is like and.

[21:57] Apparently you can you can never stop talking about the Ghostbusters speculation of the threat just it's on page 69 I think there's like 3 300 posts right now but I agree I hope to see off topic posting return a little bit more and and and I think we were talking about this weekend just make it so you could click on whether or not you want to see it and give people that option and I think that's I think it's the fairest way to deal with it versus just putting it in the basement so we'll see what what happens with that.

[22:26] In terms of threads that blow up a lot and we've been talking a lot about what are the most active threads on Pinside and there's stuff that's definitely geared towards the player in terms of tips on how to play games I think we're going to talk in a little bit today about your new game of Thrones Ellie and how we were both sort of whacking away at it last night with no real clue of what to do right now so those kinds of threads are definitely helpful and then a lot of the threads are geared towards the player.

[22:56] And when that is usually very creates a very passionate dialogue is the four sale threads and the price police that goes on in those threads what are your thoughts on four sale threads and what they do to people and how people treat each other.

[23:12] Well, that's also an interesting topic.

[23:16] And it's one that is discussed pretty regularly among the moderators.

[23:21] And of course, it's discussed quite a bit among the pin-side population in general.

[23:26] And there are a couple different trains of thoughts.

[23:28] A lot of people feel that the force-elf-reads are the source of negativity and that eliminating

[23:33] the price police would go a long way to creating a much more nice approachable site.

[23:39] And I certainly respect those views.

[23:42] Those views are held by a lot of people that I hold in an extremely high regard.

[23:46] And I think are great guys.

[23:48] I'm really in the other camp.

[23:50] And the other camp is generally that I like to see debate.

[23:55] I think the force-elf-reads and some of the banter that goes on in them.

[23:59] And I'm not talking about the personal attacks.

[24:01] Those are never okay.

[24:03] But I think that a lot of the banter that goes on, oh, you've got this game price too high.

[24:08] Let me link you to two other force-elf-reads that have gone on recently that were at a lower

[24:13] price and some of the debate.

[24:15] It adds a lot of color to the page.

[24:17] And there's really in a metric I could use to prove this.

[24:22] But I'm pretty sure there are plenty of users that wake up in the morning, pour their coffee,

[24:27] come and sit and they go look at any force-elf-read for a game that they're interested in or a game

[24:35] they already own.

[24:37] And they're curious about what the value of it might be.

[24:39] And the debate that's had on-pinside and the force-elf-reads helps them to understand

[24:44] what the value of the current games might be.

[24:46] If they do want to sell them, if they do want to trade them on or off the site, it just

[24:50] helps set what the value is.

[24:52] And if there was no debate, if there was no color, if there was no commentary, the site

[24:57] would be a lot less interesting.

[24:59] And I do know for sure because I have a couple of buddies that are members on-pinside and

[25:04] they only come in on-pinside and they only read the force-elf-reads.

[25:08] And so eliminating the discussion in the force-elf-reads would result in those people no longer

[25:14] having any reason to come on and read-pinside because they like the debate.

[25:17] They like seeing the drama and whatnot unfold, especially of Center Respectful Manor.

[25:23] But that's that tough balance.

[25:26] How do you keep it respectful?

[25:27] I think for the collector, I mean, force-elf-reads are probably the most interesting thing to

[25:36] constantly be looking at because they're searching for their next pen.

[25:40] And we all know how slow new and box stuff trickles out, so they're really interested.

[25:44] I think the one thing that I would recommend for everyone who joins force-elf-reads is

[25:48] this.

[25:49] Don't criminalize the seller for asking a lot of money.

[25:53] I always think that if you're going to sell something, you have to start the price high.

[25:57] And I see these pens selling in hour and maybe someone wants to sell quickly.

[26:01] That's fine.

[26:02] But no one's an idiot for asking $10,000 for a American's most honoured new and box.

[26:09] Why not start high and come down to a price?

[26:12] And I know there was someone who, I keep forgetting his name, but he's a new jersey.

[26:16] He had a new and boxed tronle and he kept it on there for a long time.

[26:21] And then getting $15,000 for it.

[26:23] I mean, it took him maybe a year, but he got the price he wanted.

[26:27] Yeah, I think there are a few different ways you can view the pricing.

[26:32] There's certainly a sell now price where you can have it sold almost instantly on pen

[26:38] side.

[26:39] And then there's a price where it's going to sell in a few days.

[26:42] And then there's a price where, okay, there is a right buyer for this game.

[26:49] I'm going to wait to find that buyer and it could sit on there for a month or so before

[26:54] it sells.

[26:55] And that's of course things like that America's most honoured game that was listed for $10,000.

[27:00] I really believe that if that seller wanted to hang out at that price point for the next

[27:05] month or so, he will sell that game at $10,000.

[27:08] Definitely, definitely.

[27:10] All right, so let's switch into how you got into Pimball and hear about your relationship

[27:18] with the hobby.

[27:20] So talk me through it.

[27:22] What age did you get into Pimball?

[27:23] What was your early Pimball machines do you remember playing and do you have a fondness

[27:28] for?

[27:29] What year was it that you caught the bug?

[27:31] Well, it's hard to say.

[27:33] I of course was like many kids grew up in putt-putt miniature golf places and skating rinks and

[27:41] what not.

[27:42] When I was, I guess around 9 to 11 years old.

[27:46] And back in that day, which was in the 80s, they would have pinball machines at the skating

[27:51] rinks and at the miniature golf clubs and what not.

[27:54] Those are things that you just don't see now.

[27:55] Perhaps they would have a redemption arcade there, but they no longer support the pinball

[28:00] hobby.

[28:03] But I remember playing Jack's open in a couple other card games that were at the local

[28:08] skating rink.

[28:09] I really enjoyed them.

[28:11] And that was I guess when the pinball bug bit me.

[28:15] And my father also is an attorney and has his own law firm and what not.

[28:20] In 1992, Louisiana passed gaming regulations.

[28:26] They promulgated new gaming regulations.

[28:29] Gaming is the word Louisiana uses for gambling because gambling is unconstitutional in Louisiana.

[28:34] So we had to come up with the new word for it in our state.

[28:38] And when gaming law was promulgated, a lot of my father's clients that were in the

[28:46] vending in arcade sectors left the vending in arcade sectors and went into the gaming sectors.

[28:53] And one of my father's clients had an arcade that was at the mall.

[28:58] And he did a bit of an offset on one of his legal bills and shipped my father a new

[29:05] inbox doctor who, which my father then gave to me.

[29:09] And that was in 1992.

[29:10] It was one of the ones with a moving dollocad.

[29:13] And so I remember unboxing that doctor who in 1992, what a great birthday present, right?

[29:20] I think I got like an action figure that year.

[29:25] I was a monster fan of Doctor who at the time I had actually seen every Doctor who

[29:32] episode that was not destroyed by the BBC.

[29:36] They had a lot of the second Doctor episodes were destroyed and no longer exist.

[29:41] And so I was a big Doctor who fan versus a pinball fan and getting that Doctor who a

[29:46] machine, of course, turned me into an even bigger pinball fan.

[29:50] And took about 15 years before my next pinball machine purchased.

[29:55] It goes either in 2007 or maybe it was 2008.

[29:59] I purchased a family guy new inbox from Jersey Jack.

[30:03] Oh, wow.

[30:04] Back when he was a stern distributor.

[30:06] Back when he acted back when Jack.

[30:08] Back when Jack actually shipped games.

[30:11] And I had a few good conversations.

[30:17] I had a few good conversations with Jack back then.

[30:21] So that was my first purchase, my second game.

[30:24] I still had that Doctor who all those years later.

[30:27] And so family guy was my first purchase game, but my second game.

[30:31] And opened up new inbox, love that game.

[30:34] It was a tank.

[30:35] It had it for a few years and then sold it to fund the acquisition of X-Men only.

[30:41] So you sort of got into buying new inbox.

[30:46] We're talking late 90s.

[30:49] What year was family guy?

[30:52] 2007.

[30:53] Oh, I'm way off.

[30:56] Family guy was a Pat Lawyer game and was his law.

[31:00] I think it was his last game by Stern.

[31:01] I could be corrected.

[31:02] I know he worked on CSI, which was after that.

[31:05] But I think John Borg might have finished that game.

[31:08] And right now, how many pinball machines do you have in your collection?

[31:14] I have.

[31:15] And that's another complicated question to answer.

[31:17] I have a total of 14 games, but two of them are up with Christopher Hutchins.

[31:22] And one is at my office and one is at my home here in New Orleans.

[31:27] So at my primary collection, I have 10 in leg trials.

[31:33] And out of your...

[31:35] So you've got two games with Hep restorations, right?

[31:39] For you guys who are not familiar, Hep does high-end pinball restorations.

[31:44] And which games do you have with him right now that are getting restored?

[31:48] So I've got a Medusa and a Catecom with him.

[31:51] And he's done one Medusa before.

[31:53] You can check out Hep's work on his webpage.

[31:55] It truly is phenomenal.

[31:57] And he's never done a Catecom.

[32:00] It's going to be the first hep Catecom.

[32:04] Well, I know you're anxiously awaiting to see those.

[32:07] And when you send a game to Hep, does he give you a time frame in terms of when you can expect it?

[32:13] Or are you sort of just...

[32:15] It's done when it's done?

[32:18] Well, I think it is...

[32:22] Well, wait.

[32:23] This is about a year.

[32:25] I'm not exactly certain.

[32:26] Hep is very professional.

[32:28] He does have a system and he's got an escrow and he's got a payment plan of when the money comes.

[32:35] It's going to be sent to him and whatnot.

[32:37] And it just depends.

[32:39] A lot also depends on the parts that you're needed.

[32:41] And in my case, we've been waiting for the Medusa CPR Playfield because I think he wanted

[32:49] to put in the new Playfield.

[32:51] And those were just completed as my understanding.

[32:54] Okay.

[32:55] Well, can you list out all the games you have right now?

[32:57] And so you've got...

[33:00] You've definitely got a game of Thrones, Ellie, because I saw it here in New Orleans

[33:03] when we'll talk a little bit about that.

[33:05] But what are all the games you have right now in your collection?

[33:10] So Dr. Who Star Trek Ellie...

[33:13] Well, I actually have a Star Trek premium.

[33:17] X-Men, Varkon, Salsa, revenge from Mars, Big Buck Hunter.

[33:24] Hmm.

[33:25] A safe cracker.

[33:26] Oh, and an Adam's family.

[33:31] My beautiful wife, Pavel, on Pinside whispered that one to me on the side.

[33:35] So I think that's all of them.

[33:37] And what's your favorite right now to play?

[33:44] It's hard to say.

[33:45] And I like different games for different reasons.

[33:47] I'm a big fan of revenge from Mars.

[33:49] I think that's one of the most underappreciated games in pinball history.

[33:53] I think it's one of the most advanced games in pinball history.

[33:56] And I think George Gomez did a wonderful job with revenge from Mars.

[34:00] I view George Gomez as having three masterpieces, one of which is your game revenge...

[34:04] I'm sorry, Lord of the Rings, but I think Lord of the Rings revenge from Mars and monster

[34:09] bashes really the epitome of George Gomez's work.

[34:15] It's really good stuff.

[34:19] It's too early for me to say how I feel about Game of Thrones as a player.

[34:23] So I guess probably my favorite game right now to play is either Tron or maybe X-Men.

[34:29] Okay.

[34:30] So you have a Tron or a pro or an Ellie?

[34:34] So I used to have a Tron Ellie.

[34:36] I traded it for Star Trek Premium in some cash and then a buddy of mine who actually my

[34:43] CPA went out and bought it back from the guy I sold it to.

[34:48] So it lives right down the street from me.

[34:50] So I get to go visit my old Tron Ellie periodically now.

[34:52] Do you regret letting go of the Ellie or...

[34:55] Oh yeah, absolutely.

[34:59] I love Star Trek Premium.

[35:01] It's a wonderful game and I play it quite a bit.

[35:03] It's a beautiful game.

[35:04] It's got great shots and there are some people that are offended by the rules of the Star

[35:09] Trek Premium for whatever reason.

[35:11] I'm not one of those.

[35:12] I think it's a deep game.

[35:13] It's a lot of fun.

[35:15] But it's not Tron.

[35:16] And Tron is a fantastic game.

[35:19] It just has that it factor when you take the music into it and the call outs and it's

[35:27] a wonderful board game.

[35:29] What's that?

[35:30] Speaking of Tron Ellie because I know that it seems like...

[35:33] You know, you used to see a few of them pop up for sale.

[35:36] I haven't seen one for sale in a long time.

[35:38] It seems like they've all sort of made their way into the hands of collectors and we've

[35:42] been talking a lot about when a collector gets their hands on a grail-like pin.

[35:48] They usually don't let it go.

[35:50] What's the most you would ever spend on a pin and second question?

[35:54] Do you have a grail pin that's out there that you just always on the lookout for?

[35:59] Well, it's hard to say.

[36:02] And it really just depends on the pin.

[36:06] I guess as far as grail pins go, my collection is really up to speed on pin side.

[36:13] It's very current.

[36:15] So I keep my wanted list out there and it's pretty long.

[36:19] Currently I'd really like to find a dragonfist or a quick silver, which are early 80's stern.

[36:26] I'm a big fan of stern from that era because they're great games for competitive

[36:31] pinball when you have people come over because they're super fast.

[36:36] They're faster even than Iron Man and many are arts.

[36:43] As far as what's the top you'd pay for a pin, it really depends on which pin you're

[36:47] talking about.

[36:48] I would like a big bang bar, but I will not pay $15,000 for one.

[36:53] So that means I won't have one because that's what they're going for.

[36:56] I just wait until they remake it again, probably in the current climate of remakes.

[37:03] Talk about the top 100 on pin side.

[37:06] What are your thoughts on how pins are ranked?

[37:09] Do you think that's an accurate assessment of how good a game is?

[37:13] What are your thoughts on that?

[37:15] That's another very good topic.

[37:17] I tell you what, I've been preaching for years about how I view the top 100 as being somewhat

[37:27] flawed with how it's currently calculated.

[37:30] The reason for this is what I refer to as legacy voting and what is legacy voting.

[37:37] Legacy voting is a vote that was rendered some time in the past, maybe in 2007, 2008,

[37:44] 2009, before some of the modern games were released.

[37:48] The legacy vote is won by a pin citer who's no longer part of the community.

[37:53] Maybe they have left the collection, the hobby, maybe they've just left, and they've passed

[38:04] away.

[38:05] Who knows what has happened to some of these people who were members years ago, but aren't

[38:08] members now.

[38:09] I think that it's a difficult thing to do to include their votes from 2007 and 2008

[38:17] and have it reflective of a top 100 today.

[38:20] I think that the top 100 should probably be more reflective of what the current community

[38:26] of pin side is made up of, which is the current member of this.

[38:32] I've long since suggested that they perhaps redo how they calculate the top 100.

[38:39] And by the way, by no means in any way inferring that the legacy votes should not be recorded

[38:47] or maintained somewhere, I think you could have a top 100 voting all time section, but

[38:52] having the default top 100 be made up primarily of people that are still active on pin side.

[38:58] And by active on pin side, I would put in some parameter that they've logged into their

[39:03] account at least once in the last six months or 12 months or something.

[39:07] And then have only those votes go to making up the top 100.

[39:11] And by the way, I have no way of seeing how many votes for a game like Medieval Madness

[39:17] were rendered back in 2008, 2009 before some of these amazing modern Stern games like

[39:24] Tron Ellie and Star Trek and Metallica and HVDC came out.

[39:31] But there's a reason why there are more ratings for the games from the 90s.

[39:37] And that is because all throughout the 2008, 2009, 2010, the pin sideers who were part of

[39:45] the community at that time only had those games to go off of.

[39:50] And they're rating them against games like sopranos, for example, or CSI or 24, instead

[39:57] of ranking them and comparing them in their minds eye to Tron Ellie, ACDC, Metallica,

[40:05] now pin ball is evolving.

[40:08] Sterns are evolving.

[40:09] And we were talking last night about Game of Thrones as far as I know is the third game

[40:16] that's reached mass production levels that has 100% color changing LEDs in the inserts.

[40:23] The other two being Star Trek and Wisvaz.

[40:26] And that's a cool thing.

[40:27] It looks beautiful.

[40:29] You can't compare a light show for Medieval Madness or attack from Mars or scared stiff.

[40:35] All of which are great games, by the way.

[40:37] I love those games.

[40:39] But you can't compare the light show of those games to Game of Thrones or Star Trek or

[40:43] Wisvaz because they don't compare.

[40:45] They lack the colors.

[40:47] Right.

[40:48] Yeah.

[40:49] And I think that's a very fair point about the top 100.

[40:52] And I think too, we always see people refer to the top 100 in terms of value for a game

[40:59] and how good the game is.

[41:01] But at the end of the day, every pinball machine is, it's all about, do you personally enjoy

[41:08] it?

[41:09] And we see that all the time.

[41:10] Some people love Medieval Madness.

[41:12] Some people hate it.

[41:13] It's not the pin for them.

[41:14] I personally love Lord of the Rings.

[41:15] Some people think it's got long ball times and it's not that great.

[41:19] And that's what's great about pinball is there really is a flavor for everyone.

[41:22] So I sort of view the rankings too as just being a little sometimes pointless and the way

[41:28] people utilize it to determine the value of a pin.

[41:31] I think if you enjoy the pin and it's fun for you, then that's all that really matters

[41:35] at the end of the day.

[41:38] In terms of the new pins coming out because you're talking about innovation and stuff that's

[41:42] coming down the road, what are you most excited about in terms of what 2016 holds for pinball?

[41:48] We're looking at Ghostbusters.

[41:49] We're looking at Alien, Rob Zombie, the Bowskis probably going to ship finally the Hobbit

[41:54] is hopefully going to ship.

[41:57] Are you pre-ordering any of these?

[41:59] Are you in and out any of these pins?

[42:00] Do you want any of these pins in your collection?

[42:03] Well, as a collector, you kind of want everything in your collection.

[42:07] I'm probably most interested in P3 out of all the new games that are coming.

[42:12] I like Lexi like speed.

[42:13] I got to put a couple games on it at Hagg, which is the Houston Arcade Expo that when

[42:18] I went on back in, I guess it was November of last year.

[42:23] There's a speak for Lexi light speed.

[42:28] You just kind of sign up for it and when your game is ready, you then pay for it.

[42:33] I don't view that as pre-order in the sense of some of the other pre-order models, which

[42:37] is paying advance and then we will eventually build your game and ship it to you.

[42:43] So you're going to get a P3 when it's available, finally?

[42:48] Most likely.

[42:49] I'm very interested in P3.

[42:51] I'm very interested in what they're doing over there.

[42:53] I think they've got a great team.

[42:55] They have a lot of true innovation.

[42:57] I love the way the ball interacts with the screen.

[43:00] Also there are Texas companies.

[43:03] My neighbors to the West being here in Louisiana.

[43:07] I want to support my neighbors to the West.

[43:09] I want to support their ventures.

[43:11] I think that they're doing something that is really innovative.

[43:13] I think P3 is going to blow some people's socks off.

[43:17] Do they have a timeline or when are people expecting that to finally go out the door?

[43:26] Is it sometime in the next six months?

[43:29] I think certainly within the next six months, but I wouldn't encourage anybody who is interested

[43:34] in learning more to contact Gary directly and chat with them.

[43:39] I don't have any room for more than one pin.

[43:43] I'm in a situation where I definitely love Lord of the Rings.

[43:47] I don't see myself selling it, but I do want to get a new pin this year and either put

[43:52] Lord of the Rings in storage or find a friend to hold it for me.

[44:00] I think Ghostbusters might be the one that I might give a chance if it turns out to

[44:04] be as fun as the leaked images indicate.

[44:07] We'll see.

[44:08] I think if any theme that has been rumored, I think Star Wars is the one I might wait

[44:12] to the end of the year to see if Stern finally brings that one out.

[44:16] Did you see the new Star Wars movies?

[44:18] Tiger, are you fan?

[44:20] Oh, yeah.

[44:21] Absolutely.

[44:22] I saw them three times and it was pretty good.

[44:25] I like many people.

[44:27] I'm not a Kyla Renapologist.

[44:29] I think he looked bad losing to the garbage man of the new death story.

[44:37] Star and a new Jedi and Ray.

[44:40] But I like the Star Wars movie.

[44:43] It was cool.

[44:44] It was very nostalgic and I'm a big fan of the series.

[44:46] I think it's just really exciting when we look at the themes coming out that are Ghostbusters,

[44:52] Aliens, Rob Zombie, Hobbit.

[44:54] It looks like Star Wars, Jurassic World.

[44:57] It's a great time to be a collector in the hobby and just a pinball enthusiast.

[45:01] This resurgence is really going to deliver, I think, some incredible innovation.

[45:05] These themes that people are going to love to own and play with.

[45:08] How did you, Game of Thrones?

[45:11] Did you know you wanted one because you played it or did you just hear so much great word

[45:15] of mouth?

[45:16] What made you sort of pull the trigger on that one?

[45:19] Well, one, I'm a huge fan of the theme.

[45:22] I've read all of the books and of course watched the show very religiously, never missed

[45:27] an episode.

[45:29] And theme is very important to me in pinball.

[45:31] I like good theme integration and whatnot.

[45:34] I actually was going to Order Game of Thrones right off the bat.

[45:39] And then I saw it did not have the LCD display and I wanted to game with an LCD display.

[45:45] So I backed out of ordering it and I canceled my order.

[45:50] And then I played the pro at Hague, the Houston arcade expo that was back in November.

[45:56] And I really liked it and thought it was a great layout.

[46:01] So I decided to get back in on the Ellie and so it's now my only game in New Orleans.

[46:08] So I set it up two nights ago.

[46:10] I don't have a lot of time on the machine yet, but I like Steve Richie's games.

[46:15] His games have a great flow.

[46:16] This game absolutely has fantastic flow.

[46:19] It's got a great light show.

[46:21] It's got a great theme.

[46:23] So I'm hoping I'll be happy with it as my only game in New Orleans for the foreseeable

[46:27] future.

[46:28] And we had some fun playing it last night.

[46:29] I know we're going to play it a lot more over the next few days.

[46:32] And I look forward to giving my more of a review of the machine over the next couple of

[46:38] days.

[46:39] And I'm glad that I got to play Hobbit just a few days ago and so I can compare it on

[46:44] how it shoots with Game of Thrones.

[46:46] But we had a lot of fun last night.

[46:47] That game, the light show is incredible.

[46:49] The flow is amazing.

[46:50] And when you're so in the flow of that game, you don't even notice the artwork issues and

[46:55] all that stuff people have been harping about.

[46:57] So I think we're going to have a lot of fun playing that pin.

[47:00] So I want to end this conversation with one last topic so we can get out there and enjoy

[47:05] New Orleans and Marty Grox.

[47:06] I know Brenda is probably going to strangle me if we don't get out there and try and find

[47:09] some non-deria binnier soon.

[47:12] So there's five guests here this weekend.

[47:16] There's me, there's Paave, there's Brenda, there's you.

[47:19] But there's a fifth guest in the house that is probably the MVP of the moment.

[47:25] And that is the apron of destiny that is in the house.

[47:32] For those who don't know about the apron of destiny, just give us a quick sort of background

[47:35] on what it is and why it's so special and it's become almost like an iconic grail within

[47:43] the pinball community.

[47:45] Oh, that's what a funny subject.

[47:48] So the apron of destiny was just a gag that started a few years back and Pinsider Center

[47:54] flank, who is really a hysterical poster on Pinsider, replaced his tron pro apron.

[48:00] I guess he got one of the chrome or metal aprons.

[48:02] I'm not certain.

[48:03] And he autographed it and put it up for sale and that he he shipped it over to the dude

[48:08] of Bides and who's another moderator with me in California and the dude signed it.

[48:14] And each one started to thread when they autograph the tron apron for an ever escalating

[48:19] price.

[48:20] Then they shipped it to me or the dude shipped it to me.

[48:22] And I signed it and started to thread and offered it this trade bait for a big buck

[48:27] hunter.

[48:28] I did not get a big buck hunter.

[48:29] I did get offered a lot of shasta for the apron of destiny and I ended up shipping it

[48:34] back over to Jetsie and everybody who's had the apron of destiny has gotten to sign

[48:40] the apron of destiny and I'm looking at it right now and it has center flank signature,

[48:44] the dude signature mine.

[48:46] Jetsie, a Stucka 600 and Tom G. W.I.

[48:52] And the apron of destiny will be making an appearance at the pin side booth at the Texas

[48:56] pinball festival and we'll have it behind a museum case or something along those lines.

[49:02] So if you want to see the apron of destiny, you can come to the Texas pinball festival

[49:06] and check it out at the pin side booth.

[49:08] I think the plan with the apron is going to be to move it around more like the Stanley

[49:13] Cup and have people get to take more photographs with it.

[49:17] Great.

[49:18] It's a lot lighter than I expected it to be.

[49:21] So let me ask the question that's probably on every pin side of his mind right now.

[49:26] Can Canada sign the apron of destiny?

[49:28] Is that allowed?

[49:29] I hate to tell you but center flank said he'd punch us both in the nuts if I let you

[49:36] sign it.

[49:37] So I think center flank used to be an M&A fighter so I'm not going to risk it you can't

[49:41] sign it.

[49:42] So I think we were talking about what I might do is tape a canada signature to the back

[49:50] of the apron of destiny and there was going to be a little note and here's what the

[49:53] note will be that every day that that canada signature that's it's on a post of notes.

[49:59] So it's removable.

[50:00] It's not permanent.

[50:01] Every day that that remains on the apron, I will donate a dollar to pin side.

[50:06] So let's see if we could maybe get attached to that too and see if if someone wants to

[50:10] remove it, they'll stop the donation chide because I do plan on donating at least $30

[50:17] a month to pin side.

[50:19] I encourage everyone because I was thinking about it.

[50:21] I spent about 30 bucks in New York City on an iMacs movie every time I go see one and

[50:26] I think that for the amount of entertainment and amount of hours, us hyper users get

[50:32] from pin side that 30 bucks a month, I think I should pay for the amount of entertainment

[50:36] it gives me.

[50:37] It actually provides more than a movie.

[50:39] So that's going to make it way on to the apron and we'll see if someone wants to remove

[50:43] it.

[50:45] I could see, you know, attackers like what?

[50:47] I don't know if that's actually going to happen.

[50:48] So we'll see what happens with it.

[50:50] But I know we're going to take it out to Marty Grown and have some fun with it and maybe

[50:54] get some girls to flash us and we'll toss them the apron for a little bit.

[50:58] Trade it for some needs for a few minutes.

[51:02] But Tiger, I really want to thank you for taking the time to sit down and talk.

[51:06] I think this is the first moderator interview I've seen on any of the podcasts and one

[51:11] of personally thank you for inviting Brennan myself down to New Orleans to have an awesome

[51:16] weekend with you and Pava.

[51:17] I know we're having a great time and we just look forward to more good times around

[51:22] pinball and just personally good times with you and Pava.

[51:26] So thank you so much.

[51:28] Absolutely, our pleasure.

[51:30] All right, well let's go get drunk.

[51:32] All right, Tiger, have a good one.

[51:36] Thank you.

[51:37] All right, well that was Canadian pinball podcast.

[51:40] So 10, we actually tried to go get drunk tonight and we watched the Super Bowl and I was rooting

[51:46] for the Panthers and Tigers rooting for the Broncos and what a lame game but it was a

[51:52] good time regardless and we'll talk to you guys real soon.

[51:56] I think we're going to do another podcast the next couple of days.

[51:59] I'll probably be drunk because we're going to go out and throw some beads and drink some

[52:03] booze and sit on a balcony on Bourbon Street.

[52:06] That's it, episode 10 you heard it here.

[52:09] Tiger Law and Canadian talking pinball.

[52:11] Have a good night guys.
