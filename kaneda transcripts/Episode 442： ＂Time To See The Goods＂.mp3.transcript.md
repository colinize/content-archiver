[00:00] Happy Monday morning everybody! Welcome to episode 442 of Canadian Pimball Podcast,

[00:26] I'm coming down with a little bit of a cold, but that's not going to stop me from doing a little pinball podcast for all of you today.

[00:34] I hope you enjoyed the NFL football playoff weekend. I don't know about you, but pinball is fun, but watching a team like the Tennessee Titans run train on the Baltimore Ravens was awesome.

[00:47] A lot of good games, a lot of good upsets, amazing comeback by the Chiefs by the way, but you don't listen to this podcast for football, you listen because of pinball.

[00:54] So right now, we are in a little bit of a holding period with pinball. And by that, I mean we're waiting for two big things to happen.

[01:02] I think everyone is waiting to see the projector in stranger things, and I think we're going to see it this week from Mr. Jack Danger.

[01:11] We could see it as early as tonight, so that's coming. And we're waiting to see Rick and Morty Pimball being played.

[01:18] So those two things are the biggest question marks, sort of overriding the entire hobby right now, and it's exciting to wait to see what these two things are going to be.

[01:28] And I just want to say for the record, I think a lot of people sometimes think that I'm not against any game until I see it.

[01:36] I'm not against calling a conclusion on a game until I am given all of the necessary information and assets I need to make up my mind on a machine.

[01:45] So for a lot of you out there, stranger things, a lot of your decision making hinges on if you see this projector work effectively or not.

[01:56] Right, I know Zach Sharp did a little give a comment to someone and said we're still working on the content of the projector. And then he said, comma, just wait.

[02:06] Like, really is it is it a little late for that kind of hyperbole and just wait, well, why do we have to wait when you come out of the gates beating the chest of how awesome this thing is going to be, how innovative. Just show it to us.

[02:20] I've been in a big debate all weekend back and forth with my good friend Ed Robertson about this stuff and he's like, Chris, you're missing the boat on pinball.

[02:29] The big thing on pinball is code is what makes games great. And he's right, but he's also wrong.

[02:37] Code is half of the piece of the puzzle. Absolutely. But it's also the mechanical magic in these games and the best games do both the best games deliver a game that is very satisfying shots.

[02:49] Has very satisfying things to shoot, but also has code that brings that theme to life that makes the game immersive that makes the game enjoyable. I mean, code controls everything physically controls all the lights controls everything controls the journey.

[03:04] And so I think we look for a mixture of both of those things. I don't think it's one or the other. I really don't. And so, you know, when we look at stranger things, I think the big question mark it's the code is still a question mark.

[03:16] The technology is still a question mark. The shot layout is not a question mark. We know what it is. And like when you hear people play the game, I think the game shoots fine. I think it's fun to shoot.

[03:27] But we're going to see this week. And there's going to be a lot more to talk about it. I mean, I heard, you know, from my friend that this would be a game in which I was going to have a field day with.

[03:39] And I think we've had a field day of conversation with stranger things. So I just hope to see more of this game this week. And we can make up our mind and whether or not we think this game is living up to the hype of stranger things and Brian Eddie's come back.

[03:53] So Rick and Morty, when are we going to see it? When are we going to see it played? I am going to talk to Scott. And you see hopefully this week. But I told Scott this. I said, Scott, look, I only want to have you come on after we see some gameplay footage. And the reason why is Scott has done a good job talking to a lot of other shows about this game.

[04:14] There's nothing new that we're going to get out of Scott, Denise right now. He's been on, I want to say slap save pinball podcast. He's done spooky's podcast. He did the super awesome pinball show with Christopher, Francie. So, you know, there's, I don't need to talk again to Scott, Denise. I want to talk to him when we see this game in action. And I think that's a good time to have him on the show.

[04:39] I look forward to Scott joining the show when that does occur. All right. Now, if you haven't, if you're in on Rick and Morty or you're just curious to see what's going to be going on in this game, I would definitely go listen to the last slap save pinball podcast. They interview Bowen Karen's about Rick and Morty. Now I'll summarize for you.

[04:59] The main parts of that interview, but I just want to say this is again another terrific interview with a pinball personality. Another shameful moment that slap save is not on the top 10 twippy voting ballot for best pinball podcast. They definitely deserve to be on there. And so Bowen Karen's is doing the rules of this game. Now Bowen is a very, very smart man. He's from Stanford. He's a mathematician.

[05:25] But what I love about Bowen is I love the fact that he's not only the seventh best pinball player best best best. I have the cold. Remember, he's the seventh best pinball player in the world, but he also understands how to make a game enjoyable and fun. And I've always said this.

[05:44] One of the biggest issues I have sometimes with a lot of the feedback from tournament players and this and that on modern pinball is that they don't really care about the enjoyment factor. What they really care about is understanding the rules to get to high score.

[06:00] And if that's your agenda and you just want to know how to beat a game and be successful in a tournament, that's not necessarily what the majority of people who buy pinball machines are looking for when they want to put them in their home. And I think Bowen, I think he understands both.

[06:16] And I think I think when you look at the best people in pinball, the Lyman sheets, the Bowen Karen's, I think they understand how to make an experience that serves both the diehard tournament guys, but also the home buyers and collectors and even, and even most importantly, and we always forget this.

[06:35] The most important audience to make a pinball machine enjoyable to it's the casual player, right, you need to make a pinball machine fun for anyone who walks up to it.

[06:48] And as we look at some of these modern games, right, you can easily, you can easily start to see how some of these games are just so complex that there's nothing enjoyable for the casual player to just walk up to because they they're so confused about what to do with the machine. All right.

[07:04] So here the key takeaways from Rick and Morty pinball, if you listen to that great interview, so Bowen likes a game that tells a story and where you play as somebody. Now I, I agree. I've always said this. So he gave the example of spider man, where when you play spider man, you are spider man. So you know that as the player, you're spiting.

[07:25] Same way in Batman and Robin, you're Batman and Robin, you got to jail the villains. Now in other games, games like stranger things, for example, who are you and stranger things, right, who are you playing as like who are you on the journey as same thing with Willy Wonka, who are you in Willy Wonka?

[07:42] You're nobody, right, you're sort of like observing the story from a distance, but you're not a specific person from that universe. And I think that's an important point because I do think it makes it sort of confusing what you're on a mission to do if you don't really know who you are as the player, right.

[08:03] Imagine video games, imagine video games, which you're unclear of who your character is in this world. I don't think there's ever been a video game in which you don't know who you are as the player.

[08:16] But yet there are many pinball machines that don't really clearly identify who you are. And I think as you look at pinball, to me, I agree with Bowen. It's always more fun when you're aware of who you are in the pinball universe.

[08:30] But there are exceptions to that rule. I will say that there are exceptions like Lord the Rings, one of the greatest pinball machines ever. I don't you're not anyone really in Lord the Rings. You're like an additional fellowship member that's on the journey with them, but you're not like Frodo, right. You're not arrogant. You're just you're on the journey with them, but you're not any of those characters. Okay. So let's let's let's keep going here. So in Rick and Morty in the world, I think that's the most important thing to do.

[09:00] In this game where you're on a journey, you play as Morty. So you are Morty the character. And it's your job to fill out your adventure card. So if you know the series, if you don't know the series, the way it works is Rick takes Morty on all these adventures.

[09:15] And Morty always wants to go on his own adventures and Rick is like, look, no, we're not doing it. And Morty is like, well, what if we go through three or five adventures is like, you know, what about ten is like, all right, fine. So after ten adventures.

[09:27] Then Morty gets to choose their next adventure. And so there's a Morty adventure card on the game in which you can see ten Morty adventures. And your goal is to fill out all of those adventures. And once you do, then you get to select your adventure.

[09:41] Now, if the other thing and I'll start with this is at the end of the interview, Bowen says the game is really hard. It's going to kick your ass like TNA, which is music to some people's ears.

[09:53] Some people, if you don't like short ball time games, you might get frustrated with Rick and Morty. But I was thinking like, if this game is really hard and kicks your ass and you have to go on ten adventures to then choose, that's going to be really hard to finish ten adventures if the game is brutal, right.

[10:11] So I think they're going to code the game and he said this in which when you start each game, your adventure card will already have some adventures already filled out. So you don't have to go through all ten to get to the point where you can select them in the game yourself.

[10:26] Something else that I just love it when I hear Bowen talk about this, we talked about understandable complexity and pinball and a game can't be too hard, but it also can't be too easy.

[10:37] But he talks a lot about how in new games, he considers them to be too complex and he gives Star Wars as an example of a game in which there's a lot to do in Star Wars.

[10:49] But the more you pull back the layers and try to understand the way the game is coded, the more you realize it's confusing and it gets overly complex. Now there's an irony in that complexity where you then learn throughout all that complexity.

[11:05] Here's the actual path you need to take to get the highest score and then even though there's a lot in the game, you end up playing the game just the same way over and over again because that within the complex code is the shortcut to getting a high score.

[11:23] And he's like, that's not the way it should be. Like stuff shouldn't be so complex. Stuff should be better balanced and scoring so that you can enjoy the entire game in the order that you want and still get to a good score and a competitive score without without having to do the same thing over and over again.

[11:40] And I agree with that. I love that he approaches pinball this way and the one thing and I've said this before the one thing that he hates and wants to get rid of him pinball are play field multipliers and we talk about that a lot in the show is when we start talking about multipliers and this and that.

[11:57] I think you've lost it right a game like Rick and Morty it should all be about trying to get through as many adventures as you can and trying to accomplish things from the show itself and you know and and and getting through the game we love the storyline we love it shouldn't be about oh yeah you might have done all that but that guy got a 40 time play field multiplier because he knew how to do that and activated and even though he did like he got through the journey.

[12:27] Like a third as much as you did he scored like 20 times more than you did because of one stupid multiplier for play field scoring right and I'm glad because imagine if you just get rid of all that it just becomes about what you actually did in the game and your actual progress in the game not your ability to understand.

[12:46] You know how to unlock some stupid multiplying in the in the game coding right so I love all that stuff so something else that you talked about that's really interesting is how the game has different dimensions now

[12:57] dimensions are different than adventures so adventures are like the journeys they go on the dimensions if you've seen the show there's like infinite numbers of dimensions in which there's like infinite numbers of Rick and Morty's imagine it's think about it like this just parallel universes there's parallel universe in which

[13:15] the native pinball podcast isn't booed at the twippies right in this universe we were booed last year so in a parallel universe everyone's a fan of the show in a in a in a different dimension everyone loves black night Ellie in a different dimension Jack

[13:31] and it doesn't stop making pirates of the Caribbean at the height of its popularity okay so you see what I'm saying like it's like imagine today's world but a different dimension of it so what's really cool about this game is when they go into different dimensions or the game changes dimensions things will happen in the game that are indicative of the new dimension so for example you might have a dimension in which the flippers change they change from left to right so they reverse order the flippers you might have he said he was joking but he said you know there might be a lot of things that you can do that

[14:00] you know there might be a dimension in which you're in the TNA dimension and in that dimension there's no ramps so the ramps have no scoring there's going to be a dimension maybe where the pop bumper just turns off on the left sling so this is you know so it's really cool and you start to think about adding up these different dimensions with adding in the adventures and adding in the humor

[14:21] and I think this game I don't know when I hear him talk about it I hear him talk about this game I don't know how you don't get more and more excited when you hear the people involved with this game discuss what's happening with Rick and Morty Pimble.

[14:34] You know someone used the greatest analogy on Pimple and about the two threads about stranger things in Rick and Morty they said when you go into the Rick and Morty thread it feels like you're in the locker room of the team that won the championship and when you go into the stranger things thread it feels like you're in the locker room

[14:50] It feels like you're in the locker room of the team that lost the championship.

[14:53] And it definitely feels like when it comes to the vibe and the energy and the enthusiasm surrounding these two titles,

[15:02] it's pretty clear that you've got one camp of people that are super excited and the other camp of people.

[15:10] I think they're just more like anxious, they're making some excuses and they're not really...

[15:17] I think if they're being honest, they're not really as satisfied as they want it to be.

[15:23] Considering this is like Brian Eddie's 20 year return to Pimble and it's stranger things and it's...

[15:29] You know, I just don't see it.

[15:31] I don't think they see the creativity level in the machine.

[15:34] I don't think they see anything that original in it.

[15:38] You know, as I say that, like yes, the project is original but we haven't seen it work.

[15:41] But in terms of layout, right?

[15:43] There's just not that original layout and I think what's hard for stranger things is just people saw such an original layout with Jurassic Park.

[15:51] And Jurassic Park, if you're a Stern buyer, a lot of people got that game.

[15:55] And I think a lot of people love that game and Jurassic Park is a kind of Pimble masterpiece.

[16:00] And so it's like, it just feels like Jurassic Park took people maybe one or two steps forward with what they could get from Stern Pimble.

[16:08] And I think Stranger Things does feel like a little bit of a step back.

[16:12] Now, look, the jury is still out.

[16:14] We have to see the way this projector works because I think everything hinges on how they can implement this projector and if it's going to work well for most people.

[16:23] But it's not even about that. It's just about the mood of the two fan bases couldn't be radically different.

[16:29] And so let me answer the question because people have been like saying this, like,

[16:33] you're the biggest hypocrite you bought a game without without playing it.

[16:38] And that is my rule number one is like you should play a Pimble machine before you bought it.

[16:43] And I know I know I broke my own advice on Rick and Morty, but but just put yourself in my shoes.

[16:50] I wanted to get a Rick and Morty Pimble machine when they announced it.

[16:54] I didn't know the show, but I started binge watching it and I loved it.

[16:58] Now I also knew one thing.

[17:01] And again, don't don't forget, you know, the fact that like you can, if you get a game and you get a decent number of a Rick and Morty game,

[17:10] are you really ever going to lose out?

[17:12] Are you really ever going to lose any money?

[17:15] And are you going to lose any enjoyment?

[17:17] Because I definitely, I've heard, I've heard nothing but good things from people on TNA and people swear by Scott Dinesi.

[17:26] I mean, they swear by the guy.

[17:28] And so my thought process was this, they're only making 750.

[17:32] Okay, so Kaneda always loves rare games that are not like, you know, mask produced.

[17:38] Kaneda loves an experience in a journey and a world under glass and a storyline driven game and a mode based game.

[17:44] Scott Dinesi is making that with this with bone carons and the coder.

[17:48] All right.

[17:49] Now I love great artwork and Pimble.

[17:51] I would argue that this isn't the best artwork and Pimble.

[17:55] I'm not going to lie.

[17:56] I don't think this art package blows anybody away, but it fits the style of the show if that makes sense.

[18:02] But look, I've got no Pimble machine.

[18:06] And if I'm looking and just ask yourself this, if I'm looking at the landscape of Pimble right now,

[18:12] and I want to put a machine in my apartment in the next couple months,

[18:16] and I have the ability to put a Rick and Morty machine in my apartment in the next few months,

[18:22] or I have the ability to buy what Stern has available right now,

[18:26] and the games that are available right now.

[18:28] For me, it was a no-brainer.

[18:29] I wasn't going to be Willy Wonka, and I just want to give Rick and Morty a run.

[18:34] And look, I don't think that's hypocritical.

[18:37] And I think if you were in my shoes and you were able to get an early number Rick and Morty,

[18:41] like I was able to get, that I think you would have done the same thing.

[18:45] And I'll clarify too how I got it.

[18:47] I simply called up Charlie a few weeks prior, a week prior.

[18:52] Whenever I heard the announcements, I loved to get one of these.

[18:54] I called me when they go on sale.

[18:56] I called them when they went on sale, and they gave me a great number.

[18:59] I called them right when they went on sale, and I saw some people were complaining about that.

[19:02] Like, I didn't know you could call.

[19:03] Well, no one said you couldn't call.

[19:05] Nobody said you couldn't call.

[19:07] And so I'm happy that they gave me the number I got.

[19:10] I'll reveal to you when I get it.

[19:11] I don't want to get everyone.

[19:12] Everyone's going to get, you know, these numbers.

[19:14] They make people so upset.

[19:16] You know, they get so mad.

[19:18] And like, I don't want to, I don't want to fan those flames.

[19:21] I want people to be excited that they got a game.

[19:23] I want everyone to be excited who's on that list.

[19:25] You're getting, I think you're going to get a very special game.

[19:28] And look, we'll see.

[19:30] The verdict's still out.

[19:31] Like, you know me, you know my podcast.

[19:32] If this game flips and it's so freaking brutal and it's too hard and it's not fun.

[19:36] Like, what I will call it like it is, even if I have one on order.

[19:40] I will.

[19:41] I'm not going to show the game just because I'm in on one right now.

[19:46] And you know me, I mean, I've been out on games before.

[19:48] I have wrote a check for Willie Wonka and I will, I will change my tune if I think it's

[19:54] not living up to what we expected in the game.

[19:57] All right.

[19:58] All right.

[19:58] So let's, let's move on.

[20:00] Again, I'm feeling a little sick.

[20:02] People shouldn't be doing a podcast.

[20:03] I should be in bed sleeping right now.

[20:05] But anyway, a few more news items that I want to give you guys because we were talking

[20:09] too much about Rick and Morty and Stranger Things.

[20:12] One news item I'm hearing is that Chicago Gaming Company will not be bringing cactus

[20:18] canyon to TPF.

[20:20] In fact, I'm hearing cactus canyon might even be delayed until end of the year if not

[20:27] next year.

[20:29] And there's an issue with making cactus canyon remake.

[20:31] And that means that Chicago Gaming Company might be bringing their original new game to

[20:40] this year in front of cactus canyon.

[20:42] But I still think nothing new from CGC will happen at Texas Pimball Festival.

[20:48] So that is what I'm hearing from CGC.

[20:52] Another new item that's pretty interesting that again gets me thinking about this title.

[20:57] There is a humongous code update for alien Pimball.

[21:02] So all like 120 of you, whoever, how many there are, alien Pimball code update has been

[21:07] done by a fan who owns the machine.

[21:11] Now but here's the interesting part about this.

[21:13] So this guy did a humongous code update and it's on Pinside.

[21:17] I'm not going to read what the code updates are.

[21:19] But the curious part about this is he doesn't just release the code update.

[21:24] Now he does something that I think, again, speaks to what I've been saying.

[21:30] He gets permission from Pimball brothers who he said were going back on fourth on whether

[21:35] or not they wanted to allow him to release it.

[21:38] They finally gave him permission.

[21:41] He asked permission from Pimball brothers to release a code update of a highway Pimball

[21:46] game that he bought.

[21:48] Why did he do that?

[21:50] Why does Pimball brothers need to give permission to release a code update on alien?

[21:55] Unless Pimball brothers are still planning to do something with alien Pimball.

[22:03] Now this did not come true in 2019.

[22:06] And there was a lot of people saying it was definitely coming out.

[22:09] I'm also hearing, you know, it's going to be at TPS.

[22:12] But I don't know.

[22:13] You know, I heard at the beginning of December that these games were in route, 20 games were

[22:18] in route to the United States and they were going to be on location by the end of the

[22:22] year that didn't happen.

[22:25] There's no pictures of these games being made.

[22:27] There's no manufacturing facility that we know about.

[22:31] We have no idea what Pimball brothers is doing with alien.

[22:34] But the rumors continue to be strong that this game will not be dead forever.

[22:40] And so if I were you and you want to get an alien machine, I would not buy one of these

[22:46] for sale right now.

[22:47] There's one for like 16,600 bucks with spare parts.

[22:51] I just want to go near it.

[22:52] I would just wait and see because you know that games will always come up for sale.

[22:58] But if a re-imagine version of this game happens, a remake of it with better parts and

[23:05] better cabinets, no one's going to want the older ones.

[23:09] So I would just wait and then if it doesn't happen then fine.

[23:12] Now look, it's a speculative game.

[23:15] It's like Pirates of the Caribbean right now.

[23:16] I mean, now that Jersey Jack has come out and said they're basically not making anymore

[23:20] pirates, look at the prices of pirates now.

[23:23] I mean, I'm kind of kicking myself.

[23:25] I didn't keep that CE I bought for like 16,000 because I think like the LEs now are going

[23:31] to start going for like 12, 13, 14 and the CEs are even going for more.

[23:37] But that's just the reality right because I think what's happening is exactly what I said

[23:41] Jersey Jacks should do.

[23:43] I mean, only make a limited number of games in your Jersey Jack machines are worth of

[23:47] fortune.

[23:48] And I know like I said that on my last show is I just think Jersey Jacks playing his

[23:52] game all wrong and I definitely agree with that.

[23:55] I just don't think Jack should be making games at scale.

[24:00] I think Jack should be making games to be high end Pimball machines.

[24:04] It's too late.

[24:05] They've built a big factory.

[24:07] I get he has huge themes coming out that he expects to sell at volume at $9,000.

[24:13] But every time I put a Jersey Jack machine next to a Stern machine and they're both $9,000,

[24:18] it's just it's just comical to me that Jack is pricing these games so low and his games

[24:24] are exactly what you know, it's like it's like why when you see what people are doing

[24:30] on the second hand market like make that the first hand market.

[24:33] I mean, that's what Stern's done very successfully is they've they've factored in almost like

[24:38] what these games would flip for into the regular price now like a $9,000 Stern L.E.

[24:45] You know remember Stern L.E. is used to be like what like 60 like 7,500 like 7,000 like

[24:52] what was Tron L.E. like 6,500 you know they're pretty smart what they've done.

[24:58] They've done it over the years and they've done it subtly but when you add it all up,

[25:03] you guys are all now paying a lot more for these games and it is what it is.

[25:07] I mean, we beat a dead horse on this topic but you know, I just think when you put a

[25:11] Jersey Jack machine next to a Stern machine, doesn't not look twice as expensive it does.

[25:18] But yet it's not price twice as much anyway.

[25:21] This debate will never be settled.

[25:23] It's a subjective thing value, you know, unless you put all the parts and what they cost

[25:29] and on a piece of paper and we can actually see the physical bomb that goes into each game.

[25:34] You know, how do we know?

[25:36] But it is what it is.

[25:37] It is what it is.

[25:38] Never going to change.

[25:39] All right.

[25:41] New alien code.

[25:42] Oh, something I forgot to mention in Rick and Morty was they've got something that's

[25:47] really awesome there.

[25:48] They're going to be able to do time released code updates which basically means this.

[25:53] If a new season of Rick and Morty comes out, season five, let's say, the spooky pinball

[25:59] has permission to then put elements of new seasons into the game itself.

[26:05] Now we constantly hear this that you know, why didn't game of Thrones ever add in

[26:10] new content like stranger things is only season one and two like what about season three

[26:15] Guardians of the galaxy didn't have the second movie this is like the first time ever

[26:20] I've seen a pinball machine come out in which they've told us that they're gonna put future

[26:25] content into the game that's another reason why I want the game I just I just we've always

[26:30] been told it's not happening well it's happening and I think it's something that everyone

[26:34] would want in a game like this alright what else is going on in pinball anything anything

[26:40] so I got my credentials to go down to deeproot pinball got a very very nice email very

[26:48] nice email I mean they called Brenda lovely when you call Brenda lovely you it's it's that

[26:54] email is gonna go very well on this household and I forwarded it to her and she was like oh

[26:58] shucks you know that's what's happening I also saw that deeproot for some of the zidware

[27:02] customers who got burned deeproot is paying for airfare and accommodations for someone

[27:08] you know so look this this march is going to be tough for me I got I got to just be

[27:13] transparent because I'm going to Ireland for a wedding about a week or so before the tpf

[27:21] and then I've got this deeproot thing in the middle of the week and I have to be honest

[27:25] with you I have to be honest with you if there's one thing and deeproot is like five hours

[27:32] from tpf like the five hours is just it's not just around the block right I have to be completely

[27:39] transparent if I'm looking at tpf right what's going to happen there what's going to be new what

[27:44] are we going to see do I think we're going to see guns and roses from jersey jacket tpf I don't

[27:51] right I think we're going to see hot wheels from American pinball stern pinball I think we're

[27:57] going to see ninja turtles but in typical stern pinball fashion I bet we see ninja turtles

[28:02] after tpf they always do this they they never bring it to the show so I think we're going to see

[28:07] ninja turtles after and then I'm just like I don't think we're going to see anything from Chicago

[28:11] gaming company and if I just have to pick my days the thing that I'm most curious to go see is

[28:20] deeproot pinball and I want to spend the day there seeing everything seeing what they're going

[28:25] to show us the games talk to the engine engineers do interviews that's the most enticing thing to

[28:33] me and I don't know if I can do everything people are like well you can't miss the twippy's I

[28:37] I don't know I don't know I mean last year's boot at the twippy's it's great seeing everybody

[28:42] but I just have no idea you know I have no idea like and it's a lot of days because the deeper

[28:47] thing starts Wednesday morning which means I'd have to fly out Tuesday but I don't want to be in

[28:53] Texas like Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday you know six days in Texas

[29:02] for pinball and I'm just an Ireland for like 10-11 days so that's what I'm struggling with right now

[29:08] I somehow wish they could have like combined all these things and what not but it is what it is

[29:14] but you know I'm going to be totally transparent like I'm more excited to to see what deeproot has

[29:19] cooking uh then to you know go to a show which I'm not sure how much we're really going to see

[29:25] and that's why I wish these shows would confirm if there's going to be new titles like let us know

[29:30] because for a lot of us you know you pay airfare you have to make tough decisions on whether or not you

[29:35] go to these things I also heard my boys Ken and Bill from Special One Lit they won't be going to

[29:40] TPF this year so as bummed out about that man I've also been hearing like man some other podcast

[29:46] been talking about like Special One Lit I I saw people like complaining about Ken saying that

[29:53] stranger things was his dream thing and like I mean really like are we really complaining that

[29:59] that Ken considers stranger things to be a dream theme like and then you know also in the same

[30:05] show they're they're talking about me and all this stuff and how I need to shut up about stranger

[30:10] things and what not you know it's funny to me it's like you know when we talk on this show we you

[30:15] know you listen to the show and I think sometimes people are like they like to imagine that I

[30:19] personally attack people on Canadian pinball podcasts maybe we did that years ago when we were a

[30:24] little bit more direct but I'm not going after other podcasts I'm not going after other podcasters

[30:30] but you know I when I listen to other shows I definitely hear my name coming up time and time

[30:35] again and I get it like it gives people content you know they listen to the show and then they

[30:41] have stuff to talk about on on their shows or we give them a target of stuff to say but you know

[30:47] look Ken is the nicest guy I mean I come on really some people get on the drop down menu and all

[30:53] of a sudden they start to think they're one of the big pinball podcasts out there but you know I

[30:58] just think people need to stick to their last and do what they do best but man you don't need to

[31:02] like attack other podcasters and what we're saying you know and and especially like around

[31:09] something like stranger things because it's like dude nobody's seen it work well nobody nobody nobody

[31:15] has seen anything in action nobody knows how great it is so you know it's it's I think this

[31:21] podcast has taken a stance that we're just skeptical that stern would come out of the gates

[31:26] hyping something so much and then not show it like it's and then asking for people's money right

[31:32] I don't I don't have faith that it's just going to work amazingly well now give me your 9,000

[31:38] dollars like I don't because when Brian Eddie rocks into a special one let's streaming why

[31:44] wouldn't he rock in with like the best the best version that's that's I'm just skeptical

[31:49] and then if the content's not ready as Zach Sharp says then why did you release it when you did

[31:54] if the content wasn't ready why did you do that and this is the argument I have all the time with

[32:00] people about Stern it's not that they don't make great games it's that they make games they release

[32:06] them before they're even finished and then it's like as a pinball person who wants to review stuff

[32:13] I don't know when I'm allowed to review a Stern product you know it's like someone's like

[32:18] garden's the galaxy is great now this game is great now and it's like well when is now like when

[32:25] when is the period in which I'm allowed to say okay now I can review stranger things now it has

[32:31] enough code in it now it's got the technology figured out now they've got enough content from you

[32:37] know the the the the shows creators you know it's it's it's it's like again it's like releasing a movie

[32:44] and it's not finished but then you invite people to go see it and then you're like well you're

[32:49] not allowed to say how you feel about it because you know it's it's not done but then why did you

[32:53] let me see it and the answer is like I said in my last show they just want to keep the line moving

[32:58] so they care more about the line moving than they do about releasing a game when it's ready because

[33:03] when you release a game like this when it's not ready when you bring technology like this to CES

[33:07] when it's not working right you just look you look stupid you look stupid it looks like amateur hour

[33:13] it looks it look at this point Stern pinball smart enough to know that you don't bring

[33:19] Gary Stern asking people to shut off their phones at CES one of the dumbest marketing moves

[33:26] in the history of pimple it without a doubt how embarrassing were all those videos of of him asking

[33:32] people not to stream it it's like it's like do you not know what CES is now look again this doesn't

[33:39] mean that the game's not going to work well in the right environment but again like it was just so

[33:44] stupid to bring these games to CES and they don't work well in that environment like why did you

[33:51] do it Zach Sharp like what benefit did you get from that and then the people that are watching

[33:57] this video are all like what the hell right that's it just make common sense right I have my

[34:06] common sense show common sense like that is so dumb again it be like bringing uh you know it's like

[34:14] you it's like bringing a rally car to a quarter mile strip to show people what it can do it's

[34:22] all I have is car analogies is I don't know there's not really any other analogies in the world

[34:26] all right everybody look this is going to be a week in which we see the projector answers

[34:32] our questions will be answered my big question is how how are they going to project onto those ramps

[34:38] see the ramps to me are the big issue like if you look at the angle of the ramps how is a projector

[34:44] going to look good at like that 30 degree angle and and again like those big white strips on those

[34:50] ramps just they do they look bad so if if all you're going to do is project like arrows on them

[34:58] I don't know I need to see this thing I'm going to stop talking about it we're going to see it

[35:02] this week I what sucks is we're going to have to do more shows about stranger things how many

[35:07] shows about a game do we need to do before we're given enough information to make up our minds on

[35:13] the game the sad part is is so many of you have already made up your minds and went in on at least

[35:17] and you don't even know you don't even know see there if I look at Rick and Morty there's

[35:23] nothing in that game that's a mystery to me right now right it's all there there's no projector

[35:29] that's going to have projection mapping that's a big part of the game that I that I'm not sure if

[35:33] it's going to work or not I'm pretty sure everything that's in that Rick and Morty game I see it

[35:38] I can see how it's going to work and it looks like a lot of fun stranger things complete office

[35:44] we know it's going in there we don't know how it works and we're not sure if it's going to be

[35:49] fun or not that's that's the tale of these two launches and it's the reason why the Rick and Morty

[35:54] locker room and the thread they sound like they won the championship and the stranger things locker

[36:00] room and that thread that everyone in there just like seems deflated and it's just has no

[36:06] enthusiasm everyone have a great day this has been episode let's see 442 of Canada's

[36:14] Bimbal Podcast now before I go if you haven't voted in the Twippies there's two more weeks left

[36:19] to do your voting in the Twippies so hopefully we have your vote if not you've got two more weeks

[36:25] we haven't really asked for your votes we're not campaigning but I just want to remind you

[36:29] because I told Jeff you don't even tell people when the voting ends it's like really weird that

[36:33] this committee just can't do the obvious stuff come on guys just tell people when voting ends have

[36:39] a countdown clock at least deep root has a countdown clock until when we get to see what's

[36:46] happening at deep root everyone have a great day we'll talk to you soon

[37:03] Bye
