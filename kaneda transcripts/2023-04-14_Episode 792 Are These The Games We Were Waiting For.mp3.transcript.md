[00:00] It's Friday, Friday, Gotta get down on Friday, Everybody's in the forward to the weekend, weekend.

[00:12] Oh, welcome everybody to the world's most popular Patreon podcast.

[00:18] We now have almost 600 subscribers, and everyone else who was hating on Canada for joining Patreon is now doing it themselves, and I'm happy.

[00:28] I'm happy to see this stuff. I always thought it was really weird that people would spend so much time and energy making pinball content for free, and then they got no thanks in return.

[00:40] And look, this show has not only been the most popular on Patreon, it's been the most popular out in the real world.

[00:46] Every time they do the popularity contest known as the Twippies, yours truly has held up the trophy, and that is to much chagrin of another content creator who has called it quits for good.

[00:58] Mr. Christopher Franci has done his last pinball podcast.

[01:02] Now look, I want to wish him well. I think he's a great artist in pinball, and that's it. There's no hate. There's just love. I respect his work.

[01:10] And I just don't think we need to get to these like fatalistic approaches about anything with pinball.

[01:15] The whole reason I do this show, and you know this, the whole reason I do this show is to entertain each and every one of you on a weekly basis about pinball.

[01:25] And he said something that is making me laugh. He said, what's going to happen to Canada's show over the next six months when no new games come out?

[01:32] And I just want to say, look, the same thing that happened to Canada in 2022 when absolutely no games came out.

[01:37] I still put out the most entertaining weekly pinball podcast the world has ever seen, and that's why people are here.

[01:43] And that's why you're here. And let's get right to it. So what do I think is going to happen right now?

[01:47] So here's the mindset I think everyone is in right now. I think if you're listening to this right now, you love pinball.

[01:52] And I think if you love pinball, you want a new pinball machine.

[01:55] And I think now that we've seen like six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 15,000 new games came out in the month of March,

[02:01] I think everyone is getting that new pinball itch.

[02:04] And I think everybody wants a new game to arrive in their home in the next couple of months.

[02:10] Now here's the thing. The big question is now, which one of these companies can get you that new game you really want?

[02:17] And I've been speaking to more and more people that are saying to me right now, Chris, I'm going to go get a godfather.

[02:22] And the reason they're going to go get a godfather is a godfather is available.

[02:26] And so look, you have to give Jersey Jack credit. They're making the games.

[02:30] There are Scooby-Doo machines available.

[02:33] There are Foo Fighter machines that are going out the door left and right.

[02:37] So these three companies, if you think about it, Spooky Pinball, Stern Pinball, and Jersey Jack Pinball,

[02:43] are really the only pinball companies that are consistently making brand new games that you can go own and buy.

[02:51] And that's the way it should be.

[02:52] And that's why these three companies are going to get the majority of the sales because they actually have something you can buy.

[02:59] Does anyone really know when Galactic Tank Force is going on the line?

[03:03] I hope it's in May and I hope they get games out quickly.

[03:06] There's a rumor out there that Canada is rooting against this game.

[03:10] I'm not rooting against this game.

[03:12] I'm being very candid about this game is a total weird game.

[03:17] And if you want something different and you want something weird, by all means go buy a Galactic Tank Force.

[03:24] Boy, did they make the game for someone who wants something that's completely weird and crazy.

[03:28] And there's absolutely no focus group they used.

[03:32] There's absolutely no market research.

[03:34] There's absolutely nothing they did to say, hey, if you want to make money in pinball, someone else's money, Mukesh's money.

[03:40] If you want to make money off of Mukesh's money,

[03:43] the thing we should make is a tank machine about ice cream and like something else happening with 80s full motion video

[03:50] and something else about Sundays and sprinkles.

[03:52] I get it. I get it.

[03:53] And like ultimately it doesn't matter what Canada says.

[03:56] It doesn't matter what anybody says.

[03:58] Ultimately, enough people are going to get time on this game and have to make up their mind if they want to buy one or not.

[04:04] And I think they need to get the games on the line.

[04:06] If they start shipping these games sometime in the next few weeks, people will order it.

[04:11] This is the thing about pinball.

[04:13] There is a large enough community of men who have disposable income, who are bored and they want to buy something new.

[04:21] Now the thing is this.

[04:23] Do you have the skill set and the manufacturing ability to give people the product?

[04:28] Because what I think people are not going to do, and this is why we're still seeing Galactic Tank Force LEs all over Pinside for sale.

[04:35] What people are not going to do if the theme is not amazing, they're just not going to pre-order a game anymore.

[04:40] Especially if these pre-ordered games are non-refundable deposits.

[04:45] Why would you pre-order a Galactic Tank Force right now?

[04:48] There's no need to.

[04:49] The only time I think people would even think about giving money to a distributor for the game is if we see games on the line.

[04:57] But we have not seen that yet.

[04:59] And the same is true with Haggis Pinball, right?

[05:01] That's the other thing.

[05:02] We're supposed to get Haggis Pinball announcing their next game.

[05:06] Why?

[05:06] Have they built all the mermaid additions of Fathom?

[05:09] No.

[05:10] They also have to build the non-mermaid additions of Fathom.

[05:14] Now you've got to be crazy if Haggis Pinball announces Centaur.

[05:19] You have to be crazy to send them money on their next game until they finished all of the Fathom builds.

[05:27] Because I would be nervous, and we've seen this before, that these little boutique companies have a tendency to rob Peter to pay Paul.

[05:34] Right?

[05:35] They got to get that money in on the next game to finish the builds of the first game.

[05:39] And there's no way.

[05:40] And you know this.

[05:41] And this is just commonsensical.

[05:43] There's no way Haggis Pinball is making a profit with all of the delays they've had with that big factory and just barely getting games out.

[05:54] I haven't seen a lot of new unboxings.

[05:56] And here's the thing.

[05:57] You know, if you listen to Canada and you wait and see, how much was Fathom Pinball?

[06:01] I think it was like $9,000 to $10,000 for a mermaid addition.

[06:05] Okay.

[06:05] So if you go on the pin side right now, you can go get one new inbox for I think $11,000.

[06:12] And you could have the game in like a couple days and you had no risk.

[06:16] You didn't have to lock your money up with Haggis for like freaking a year and a half.

[06:20] And that's the thing.

[06:22] I think everyone is learning this lesson right now.

[06:25] If you do wait and see, unless the title is something like Back to the Future or freaking the Matrix or Top Gun or Ghostbusters.

[06:34] Unless the title is a triple A title, you will be able to still get one.

[06:41] You can still get a Godfather Collectors edition.

[06:45] When some of these distributors who do have podcasts, when they say it's sold out, what they mean is their allotment is sold out.

[06:52] But do you really think that 1,000 people are going to send in $15,000 plus on this game when it hits the line?

[07:02] Of course they'll be available for sale.

[07:04] Of course you'll be able to find one because it's the same exact game as the LE.

[07:09] That's the other thing too.

[07:10] It's like it's the same exact game as the LE.

[07:12] And when people start to see LE's trading for below what they are right now, you're going to see it's softened a little bit on needing to own the collector's edition.

[07:22] You know, look, there's very few games that are truly collectible.

[07:25] You guys know this.

[07:26] You know what they are.

[07:27] You know their names.

[07:28] I'm not going to list them right now.

[07:30] But this modern approach to making a thousand LE's, a thousand CEs, charging all of this money for them at MSRP, I think it severely diminishes the collectibility of a lot of these games.

[07:46] And at the end of the day, the things that will always be the most collectible will be themes that people absolutely love and gameplay that people absolutely love.

[07:58] That is the way you become a pinball machine.

[08:02] People want people don't love the gameplay of Ghostbusters, but guess what?

[08:07] They love Ghostbusters.

[08:08] People don't love the gameplay of Batman 66, but they love Batman.

[08:14] A lot of people don't love Iron Maiden music, but they love the gameplay of Iron Maiden.

[08:20] And that's the thing, right?

[08:21] How many of you grown men are like Godzilla fanatics?

[08:25] You're not, but you love the Godzilla gameplay.

[08:28] You love the call-outs.

[08:30] You love the assets.

[08:31] You love the way that whole game comes at you with so much personality.

[08:36] And that's the thing.

[08:37] That's all we really want.

[08:38] That's all we want.

[08:39] We want a game that just connects with us, has personality, and is a ton of fun.

[08:45] We don't love the gameplay of Rick and Morty, but damn, what a good theme it is.

[08:49] And so as I look at the games in 2023, I'm looking at a lot of games where like the themes aren't really there.

[08:56] So what's really going to make these 2023 games stand out?

[09:00] It's going to be the gameplay.

[09:02] And look, what are people talking about with Foo Fighters?

[09:04] They're talking about the gameplay.

[09:06] What are they talking about with Godfather?

[09:08] They're talking about the gameplay.

[09:10] And this is why I think Galactic Tang 4 is, and I mean it when I say it, I'm trying.

[09:15] I'm trying real hard to kind of change my point of view on this game.

[09:19] But I don't think this game is going to win on theme.

[09:22] And I don't think it's going to win on gameplay.

[09:24] And that weird campiness and sense of humor, I think it's going to wear thin.

[09:28] And that's that.

[09:29] And then the question is, well, what's next?

[09:31] Now I heard a rumor, this is not going to happen, but one of my fans said, hey, what if they make Barrio's food truck?

[09:37] Because food truck was completed at Deep Root Pimbal.

[09:40] And they spent so much money.

[09:42] I heard Robert Mueller spent $2 million on the assets for games like Foo Fighters and Raza.

[09:49] So if all that is done and Barrio made food truck, do you think American Pimbal would actually bring food truck out into the world?

[09:58] I don't know.

[09:59] I don't know.

[10:00] Like, I don't think people are going to line up to buy that game.

[10:03] I don't think they're going to line up to buy Galactic Tang 4.

[10:06] I think a sequel to Whitewater is also dicey.

[10:10] If Ryan McQuade has a video game or arcade license game that he's working on, I would probably get that game out next.

[10:19] The big issue for Jersey Jack and for American Pimbal and for all of these companies that are not Stern Pimbal, the big issue is this.

[10:27] Do you have a game that people will like enough where you could keep the line going for six months?

[10:34] That's really the biggest challenge for all of these companies and probably more than six months, right?

[10:39] Because a lot of these companies only get out one game a year.

[10:43] So you need a game that's popular enough to keep your line moving for 12 months.

[10:49] And if that game's not popular enough, you need other popular games in your portfolio where you could also run some of your other titles.

[10:57] Now, here's an interesting thing.

[10:59] I was thinking about this.

[11:00] What if American Pimbal puts Houdini in a normal cabinet?

[11:05] What if American Pimbal does what Stern did?

[11:08] Why don't they actually fix some of the geometry issues on Houdini and release a new Houdini in a new cabinet?

[11:17] And how about this?

[11:18] Go one step further.

[11:19] How about they put the amazing Matt Andrews artwork, which they own and re-skin it with that beautiful artwork that John Papadou, he creative directed that artwork.

[11:31] It looks so much better than the freaking artwork that's on the existing Houdini machine.

[11:36] What if they did that?

[11:38] What if they rerun Oktoberfest in the new cabinet?

[11:41] Right, that game is loaded with mechs.

[11:43] It's a lot of fun, but it's just got the worst art package ever.

[11:48] So what if they redid that, put it in a new cabinet and give these two games a second life?

[11:54] When you look at Oktoberfest and Houdini, both of those games are some of the most loaded games when it comes to mechanisms and mechanical magic.

[12:03] They just either had shots that were way too tight that you could probably open up, or they just had artwork that was just so hideous, nobody wanted to own it.

[12:12] And let's face it, nobody wants that frumpy back box.

[12:15] It looks so bad in a lineup.

[12:18] And now that they have a normal cabinet, I think that would make total business sense because you don't have to spend all the money on R&D.

[12:25] You've got a few games that you could rerelease, just re-skin them.

[12:29] You might piss off the old owners, but here's the good news.

[12:32] There aren't a lot of old owners of American pinball games.

[12:35] Alright, Canada, what are you going to talk about, Canada, for the next six months?

[12:39] Alright, this is show number one on proven Christopher Franche wrong.

[12:43] Canada can actually talk on a weekly basis about pinball even when there's no pinball news.

[12:48] This is what I've been doing for 790 episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[12:53] Why would we stop now?

[12:55] The real question is, am I going to upload seven free shows to be eligible for Twippy Victory number seven?

[13:02] I don't know.

[13:03] I think we open it up next year.

[13:04] I really do.

[13:05] Alright, so look, Foo Fighters Ellie is on the line.

[13:09] People should be getting them.

[13:10] Probably next week, we're going to start to see unboxings of that game.

[13:15] I think this is going to be the game that wins the early half of 2023.

[13:20] You know, when I think about who's going to win best game of the year so far,

[13:24] if you were to look at just these games, I think Foo Fighter would take it.

[13:27] Now look, Brian Eddy's Venom might be coming out.

[13:30] There might be another Stern game coming out.

[13:33] We might get Steve Richie's Elton John sometime this year.

[13:37] So I think it's way too early to say this is going to be it.

[13:41] Pulp Fiction is going to be on the line by the end of the year.

[13:43] So it's going to be an interesting year.

[13:45] We are going to get more titles in 2023 than we did in 2022.

[13:50] I think in 2021 combined.

[13:53] But it's not about quantity.

[13:55] And that's the thing that I think everyone's feeling right now.

[13:58] Even though we got a surplus of new games, are we feeling like we got quality?

[14:04] Like these are the games we've been waiting for.

[14:06] That's a good question right now.

[14:07] Let me ask that of you right now.

[14:08] I'm going to name this podcast that.

[14:10] Are these the games that we've been waiting for?

[14:14] And I think if we ask that question and we stare in that pinball mirror,

[14:19] the answer is no, like these aren't the games we've been waiting for.

[14:23] These aren't the themes people are super excited about.

[14:26] These are like the B level themes and some of them executed very well.

[14:31] I think Foo Fighters blew us all away.

[14:33] I think nobody was expecting a single level Pulp Fiction game to do it.

[14:36] It did.

[14:37] And I think those are the two real winners.

[14:40] I think Godfather as a theme is a head scratcher.

[14:43] It is Jersey Jack pinball's best shooting game today,

[14:46] but it is kind of mechanically empty when you look down at the game and like

[14:51] hearing Jersey Jack employees do call outs in a Godfather pinball machine

[14:56] based on this iconic movie by Martin Scorsese.

[14:59] It is really somewhat cringe worthy when you see that happening.

[15:04] I don't want to see Jersey Jack employees in a Godfather game.

[15:08] I don't want to see them as mobsters on the art package of the game.

[15:13] Think about it.

[15:14] If they made Top Gun Pinball and Eric Minier designed it,

[15:17] I don't want to see Eric Minier in a cockpit of an airplane on the cabinet of the machine.

[15:23] You don't get to do that.

[15:24] It's just so weird like seeing American Pinball put all of their employees into the game.

[15:28] It's just weird.

[15:30] Now look, you can do it on an original game like Galactic Tank Force.

[15:34] There's no source material that they're taking liberty with,

[15:37] but with a movie like Godfather, you can't do it.

[15:39] I mean, imagine if Gundon Roses had a skeleton of Eric Minier on it on the back glass.

[15:45] It just doesn't make sense.

[15:47] Here's the thing.

[15:47] The year is only half over.

[15:48] I think we got a lot more pinball coming.

[15:51] There's a lot of weird stuff coming like is Turner Pinball going to do something?

[15:55] New games from Pinball Adventures.

[15:56] There's going to be even more stuff from these boutique companies throwing their hat into the ring.

[16:02] There's also going to be another game from Dutch Pinball.

[16:04] Now look, Christopher Franci did in his podcast with Orbe.

[16:08] He did say that Canada's rumor about Batman 89 was incorrect.

[16:14] Now here's the thing.

[16:15] It was a rumor and this is why I release rumors because they bring out the truth.

[16:20] So if Christopher Franci is saying it is not Batman 89, I tend to believe him.

[16:26] I will take his word that it is not Batman 89.

[16:29] The other thing I'm hearing that it's a sci-fi game.

[16:32] I'm really hoping it's the Matrix and the reason why I'm hoping it's the Matrix.

[16:37] I was talking a while ago to someone affiliated with Dutch and I think they said something to me like

[16:44] Jack Guinari does not have the license for the Matrix.

[16:48] And if you were to ask me looking at the direction Jersey Jack is going in right now,

[16:52] like stripping everything out of its games and the direction Dutch Pinball has done with Big Lebowski,

[16:59] I would much rather have Dutch Pinball and Barry design the Matrix right now than Jersey Jack Pinball.

[17:06] The next game from Jersey Jack Pinball is going to be the one where we know or not

[17:11] if they're going to go back to making loaded games.

[17:14] It's not about Eric spinning the fact that there's twice as many parts in Godfather as Pirates.

[17:19] Come on, come on, a screw's a part, right?

[17:22] A little diverter's a part.

[17:23] Like you don't get to count those things.

[17:25] It's not the number of parts that matters.

[17:27] It's again, it's not the quantity.

[17:30] It's the quality of what you're creating with those parts.

[17:33] And I think anyone that stands over Pirates of the Caribbean and Wizard of Oz

[17:38] doesn't care that Godfather has more parts in it.

[17:42] What they care about is those other games have more toys.

[17:46] They have more things that interact with the ball.

[17:48] There's more movement happening in the game.

[17:51] The freaking flying monkey, which was the first game Jersey Jack ever made.

[17:57] The flying monkey that magnetizes the ball and brings it to the upper play field

[18:03] is more impressive than anything that's in Godfather.

[18:08] The pirate ship in Pirates is way more impressive than anything that's in Godfather.

[18:15] And when I think about pinball companies and I think about their evolutions,

[18:19] every game they make should be an improvement on what they've done before.

[18:26] And that's my big issue is the only thing that really got improved is the flipper feel,

[18:32] which there never should have been an issue on.

[18:34] Everything else feels like it's now not there.

[18:38] Oh, but you got to play it, Canada.

[18:40] It's fun, Canada.

[18:42] It shoots well, Canada.

[18:44] Canada, how are you going to do shows for the next six months, Canada?

[18:47] Everybody look, we all want a new game.

[18:49] I want a new game.

[18:50] You want a new game.

[18:51] We all want a new game.

[18:52] I've got one more payment on my Batman SLE and then it is mine.

[18:56] And then I have to figure out where to put it as I try to find a house.

[18:59] It's been a very stressful year for myself and Brenda.

[19:02] I'm going to end this show on a little bit of a sad note.

[19:04] We had an issue trying to expand our family and it really did suck.

[19:08] And I haven't gone into details, but it's been very painful for us to go through this.

[19:14] And I've always put on a smile.

[19:16] I always did my shows.

[19:17] I did my Saturday morning spectacular is all why we were going through this.

[19:22] I had some of the most devastating meetings with doctors and it was really heartbreaking

[19:27] to learn everything we were learning.

[19:29] It was heartbreaking to go through everything we went through and my gosh, to see the power

[19:34] of a woman like Brenda and her ability to not just go through all of it, but then also

[19:39] be the most amazing mother to Killian and the most incredible wife to myself.

[19:45] It's absolutely been incredible.

[19:47] The strength that one woman brings into my world and I love Brenda more than anything.

[19:53] And just a couple months later, I lost one of my best friends and coworkers that I loved

[19:58] dearly at the age of 35.

[20:00] So all of this happened in this year while all these pinball machines were coming out

[20:06] a week after the Twippy's I lost my friend.

[20:08] And so that's sort of like what's defined this year for me is the struggle between the

[20:13] personal life and the pinball excitement.

[20:16] And what I've learned from all of this is that we really need each other more than ever

[20:21] and that this community is an amazing community filled with amazing people.

[20:26] And what I love about pinball and all of you and the products themselves is we give such

[20:32] meaning to it.

[20:33] We give such meaning to pinball more meaning than it deserves.

[20:38] Like we give these games way more meaning than they ever deserved.

[20:42] They were never meant to do what they're doing right now for our lives.

[20:46] You got to remember that, right?

[20:47] These were meant to go into arcades and compete with stuff like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter

[20:53] and just get quarters for operators.

[20:56] That is what these things were designed to do for decades.

[21:00] And now they've taken on a whole new meaning because what these machines are building isn't

[21:06] just money for an operator, which it's still doing on some level.

[21:11] But the majority of pinball machines that are made today are building a community of

[21:16] people.

[21:17] They're building memories for home owners.

[21:19] You know, they're building clubs.

[21:21] They're building league nights.

[21:22] All these things are new and part of the modern pinball experience.

[21:27] And it's absolutely a beautiful thing to see a product like a pinball machine take on a

[21:33] whole new meaning.

[21:35] And I've really needed this podcast over the last few months to get through everything

[21:39] I've been getting through because this outlet to me means so much.

[21:44] And you being a part of it means the world to me.

[21:46] You'll never know how much it means to me every month when I look at the club members,

[21:52] how many people subscribe to this show.

[21:54] It means the world.

[21:55] And yes, that's me asking you not only to stick around, but I would love it if you could invite

[22:00] some of your other friends who love pinball to check out this show.

[22:04] Because I think they're going to get the most entertaining take on pinball.

[22:08] They're going to get a take with no agenda.

[22:10] And they're just going to have a good time.

[22:13] And I think each and every one of you has a friend who could definitely join.

[22:17] And I'm not going to raise prices.

[22:18] $5 is the entry level.

[22:21] Some of you pay a lot more than that.

[22:22] And I thank you so much for that.

[22:24] And this show is not going anywhere.

[22:26] And I don't do this show to win the Twippies.

[22:28] I win the Twippies because I have fun making the show.

[22:31] And when I was listening to Franchi talk about why he's leaving, he's leaving basically

[22:34] because of me.

[22:35] He's like, well, people don't want this.

[22:37] They want that.

[22:38] And he's like, that is terrible.

[22:40] That is negative.

[22:41] That is toxic.

[22:42] And my thing is this.

[22:43] He doesn't even listen to the show.

[22:45] He hasn't been a club member since I've had a Canadian club.

[22:48] And so for two years, he's never heard me say what I always say, which is I think he's

[22:53] an incredible artist.

[22:54] I think he's extremely talented.

[22:57] And I think if you're talented at something, don't worry what other people say about you.

[23:02] You know how many people don't like me?

[23:04] I mean, the list is very long.

[23:06] But if I were to quit this podcast because other people didn't like me or like how I

[23:11] do my show, I wouldn't be able to make it through a week if I listened to the Canadian

[23:16] haters.

[23:17] You know, you got to just tune it out.

[23:18] And look, life doesn't have to be all or nothing either.

[23:21] Like you don't have to quit doing your podcast because you didn't win a Twippy.

[23:25] I mean, it's just the popularity contest.

[23:27] It means nothing.

[23:28] You know what matters more to me?

[23:29] The subscribers here are what matter the most.

[23:31] So thank each and every one of you for being a part of the show.

[23:34] And I think we can get to 600.

[23:35] I do.

[23:36] And I think it's going to happen real soon.

[23:38] And again, Kim Mitchell keeps hitting me up.

[23:40] He wants to give you his $400.

[23:43] $5.98 and $5.99 each get $100.

[23:47] And number 600 gets $200.

[23:50] I'm telling you right now, you could easily, you could do this.

[23:53] You could set up eight fake Gmail accounts and get those freaking final eight slots and

[23:59] win $400.

[24:00] I mean, it's the easiest way to make $400 on planet Earth.

[24:03] Everybody, I love you guys.

[24:05] Have a great Friday with your families.

[24:07] I'll be on the Maro for the Saturday morning spectacular.

[24:10] And we ain't never going to run out of stuff to talk about it.

[24:13] Give me no news.

[24:14] That's when I thrive.

[24:15] When there's no news, guess who's going to make the news?

[24:17] Canada out.

[24:18] Tomorrow is Saturday and Sunday comes afterwards.

[24:23] I don't want this week to end.

[24:26] I'll be Rebecca Black.

[24:28] So chillin' in the front side.

[24:30] In the front side.

[24:31] In the back seat.

[24:32] I'm driving cruising.

[24:33] You get a hassle lane.

[24:34] Switching lanes with a car on my side.

[24:36] Woo!

[24:37] Passing by is a scuba sin in front of me.

[24:40] Next Tic Tac, Tic Tac, one of the strength.
