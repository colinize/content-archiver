[00:00] Love, heart, love, smile, love, who's in the box.

[00:16] Do you think it's karma that a book that's supposed to celebrate 30 years of Stern Pimball

[00:21] is now ripping everyone off in the Pimball community that supported this book?

[00:26] We're going to talk about this.

[00:27] We're going to talk about some news items.

[00:29] Happy Monday morning everybody.

[00:31] It feels like an huge weight has been lifted off the shoulders of Americans right now.

[00:38] And look, it doesn't matter which way you went with this election.

[00:40] I think everyone can agree that now we can all just get back to hating Pimball games

[00:46] and machines and debating Pimball machines left and right.

[00:48] So here's the thing.

[00:49] There was a book that was announced four years ago by Kickstarter and was called Keeping

[00:55] the Ball Alive 30 years of Stern Pimball.

[00:59] And it was made by this company called Paperfloc.

[01:01] And obviously this was time to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Stern Pimball.

[01:07] Now if you remember, Batman 66 Pimball came out also commemorating 30 years of Stern Pimball.

[01:13] But here's what's really funny about this project.

[01:15] When you go back and look at it right now is who was involved with contributing to this book.

[01:22] It was a coffee table book that was supposed to go all into Stern Pimball in this great company.

[01:27] Now here's the funniest part.

[01:28] Guess who wrote the forward for a book that is designed to celebrate Stern Pimball?

[01:34] Guess who wrote the forward?

[01:35] No other than Guns and Roses guitarist slash.

[01:39] So this is so funny because four years ago,

[01:42] four years ago there was no Jersey Jack Pimball Guns and Roses machine and slash never in a million years

[01:48] when he did this, thought his book would come out at the exact same time as his Jersey Jack Pimball machine.

[01:54] I don't even think they were designing Guns and Roses with Jersey Jack Pimball four years ago.

[01:59] And so you also were going to get a jacket incentive, a beautiful ugly look.

[02:05] The art's not ugly, but the jacket itself is pretty hideous, but the art is really cool.

[02:10] It's a jacket with zombie yeti's artwork on the back of it.

[02:14] So let's read how they talk about this book, Hey Kickstarter Community.

[02:18] If you're like me, you grew up seeing Pimball machines at ice cream shops and pizza parlors when you were young.

[02:25] You probably played a few games and admired the art,

[02:28] but didn't really start to enjoy playing until five years ago when the Pimball resurgence began.

[02:34] First of all, let me stop there.

[02:35] This guy is like totally wrong, totally wrong.

[02:38] So he saw Pimball machines didn't play them was enamored by the artwork.

[02:45] Okay, so this should have been the first red flag that this guy is a total newbie and has no idea what he's talking about.

[02:52] Okay, he goes on to say Pimball is huge today record numbers of people going to Pimball tournaments.

[02:59] The collector market has been heating up.

[03:01] Barcaids are popping up all over the place.

[03:04] And there are even new documentaries just coming out now in 1999.

[03:10] Valley Williams Midway stopped producing Pimball machines and Gary Stern purchased Sega Pimball to form Stern Pimball,

[03:18] which was the last major manufacturer still producing Pimball machines.

[03:22] This story of Stern is also the story of Pimball for the last couple decades.

[03:27] And then the book, there's a mock up this beautiful white book with the Stern 30 years logo.

[03:33] And it says presenting keeping the ball alive, 30 years of Stern Pimball, a collectible coffee table book that takes a deep look at the Stern company,

[03:41] the artist, the technical side and the games.

[03:43] Okay, I'm not going to read all this.

[03:45] And then it goes into how they're going to have interviews with all these personalities.

[03:49] So they talk to Gary Stern, they talk to John Churdo, they talk to Steve Richie, George Gomez, John Borg,

[03:56] they talk to all these people over at Stern.

[03:59] Now I want to call out the two gentlemen making this book.

[04:02] So it's a company called PaperFlock.

[04:04] Now it says PaperFlock uses crowdfunding and crowdsourcing techniques to create unique books, not available any other place in the world.

[04:13] PaperFlock is great books for the people by the people.

[04:17] All right, great.

[04:18] Yeah, books for the people by the people as opposed to books for the people by robots or books for the people by dogs.

[04:27] I love that sort of hyperbole to get you guys feeling confident about this venture.

[04:32] His name is Joseph Rubenstein and I have found it startups in the past, including polite in public and digital bull likes ink.

[04:42] All right, let's just stop there for a minute.

[04:43] Have any of you ever heard that?

[04:45] Is that a testament to someone who's successful?

[04:47] Did he start a successful company you've ever heard of?

[04:50] This is what the fascination I have with kick starters and people throwing money to complete strangers is when they're trying to sell you and convince you on, you know,

[04:59] their accolades and you buy into stuff.

[05:01] You have no idea what it is.

[05:02] Okay, he goes on to say, I've also created two successful projects on this great platform and backed many more.

[05:10] I am coming to Kickstarter this time to bring you a book about a subject I care deeply about.

[05:16] I have a pinball machine at home that my girlfriend and I play every day and many of my trips are to places that have pinball museums or an active pinball culture.

[05:26] Okay, there you go.

[05:27] Joseph's got a machine at home, people.

[05:29] He plays pinball on vacation.

[05:31] What could possibly go wrong?

[05:34] Let me give him my money right now and then also his partner, a Damien guess.

[05:39] My name is Damien guess and I have been working and printing and publishing for many years.

[05:44] I'm a long time pinball fan and I'm excited to be working to tell the story of Stern pinball.

[05:49] Please help us create this book celebrating the art and stories of Stern pinball.

[05:55] Okay, so this was four years ago.

[05:57] Okay, four years ago to make a book to make a book.

[06:00] How could making a book about pinball take longer than making a pinball machine?

[06:05] So just stop right there.

[06:07] Now they manage to raise and this is just an ironic number.

[06:10] I'm not making this up after four years.

[06:13] These gentlemen manage to get four hundred and forty four backers to this project.

[06:18] And that's the number I'm seeing as of this Monday morning.

[06:21] And they manage to raise fifty five thousand three hundred and thirteen dollars was given to these gentlemen

[06:28] who had startups that no one's ever heard of who only owns one pinball machine

[06:33] who's been a part of unknown successful ventures now taking it to Kickstarter.

[06:39] But he managed to get all these Stern people on board for this project.

[06:42] Okay, so let's fast forward.

[06:44] I want to fast forward right now and read you something from Pinsides founder Robin.

[06:49] I want to read you how much this book is going to cost Robin to get to him in the Netherlands right now.

[06:56] So Robin wrote yesterday.

[06:59] I am not one to publicly complain very quickly, but I agree with all of you that this is quite ridiculous.

[07:06] The original shipping estimate on their site was seventeen dollars and now paperfloc expect me to pay

[07:12] a hundred and twenty five dollars for shipping for a book, a shirt and a poster that sure feels like a rip off.

[07:20] And after a four year wait for a book, wow.

[07:23] Considering the additional import duties that I will be charged here in the Netherlands,

[07:28] my total will come to roughly wait for people four hundred and fifty five dollars.

[07:35] Again, that's just a book, a shirt and a poster.

[07:39] I'm seriously considering writing this thing off.

[07:42] It's just not worth that kind of money.

[07:45] I feel awful for all the folks involved in this Kickstarter through my sticky on Pinside.

[07:50] Had I known what a cluster this would be.

[07:53] So Robin takes some responsibility because remember when this whole thing hit,

[07:58] when these guys were announcing they were going to make this book,

[08:00] Robin put this thing front and center.

[08:03] He put it in front of everyone.

[08:04] Robin really is the person who got these guys the audience to raise that fifty five thousand dollars.

[08:11] So he feels some responsibility.

[08:13] Now look, I don't blame Robin for this.

[08:15] It's not his fault.

[08:16] He had no idea four years ago these guys were going to scam the community.

[08:19] But it always reminds me of something my good friend said to me.

[08:22] He said, Chris, if you ever want to go into a business to scam people and steal people's money,

[08:28] all you ever have to do is announce you're doing something around Pimball

[08:32] because Pimball people are suckers and they will throw money at something before they see any proof

[08:38] that you know what you're doing.

[08:39] I mean, we've seen John Papadu do it.

[08:41] We've seen manufacturers do it.

[08:43] And now we're seeing a book, just a book, paper, paper and interviews and art and ink and binding.

[08:50] Four years later, they still don't have this thing figured out.

[08:54] And so just so you guys know, back when they announced this thing,

[08:58] they told everyone shipping would be somewhere between 12 and $18.

[09:03] 12 and $18.

[09:05] And now they are telling most people in the United States that shipping is around $80.

[09:10] And that international is over $120, $150 plus import fees.

[09:15] And so my question around this whole thing is this, you have to be out of your mind,

[09:20] knowing this company is ripping you off to go in and give them more money.

[09:25] But here's my favorite post in this whole entire thing.

[09:28] So after everyone realizes that these guys are crooks, they've ripped everyone off.

[09:33] This is the one post that just reminds me why Pimball people will continue to get ripped off.

[09:39] You'll continue to not get what you pay for.

[09:42] And it's no other than our boy, Fralik, who writes,

[09:46] I did pay because I'm sick of this thing being a thing in my life.

[09:50] Wow.

[09:51] What a way to stand up for what's right, Fralik.

[09:54] You just caved and paid this exuberant shipping cost just because you just wanted the headache to be over.

[10:00] And so those criminals and those crooks are now going to get validated by behavior like this.

[10:06] No, here's what I think everybody should do.

[10:08] Guess whose name is all over this thing.

[10:10] Guess whose whose company is being dragged through the mud with this book, Stern Pimball.

[10:15] What y'all need to do is you need to wake up and stop thinking that this guy,

[10:20] this Rubenstein guy, this Joe Rubenstein who lives in a,

[10:23] basically this guy, they showed where the company is.

[10:26] This is the funniest part.

[10:27] Someone did a Google search of where this paper company is.

[10:30] It's actually the guy's one bedroom apartment.

[10:33] So imagine if Kate has said, hey, guys, I got a publishing company that's out of my one bedroom apartment.

[10:38] No wonder this guy is a joke.

[10:40] Like the whole thing is a joke.

[10:41] He's got a, he's got outsource everything to be made after seeing all this stuff.

[10:45] I would go after Stern Pimball and say Stern, like what's up with this?

[10:48] Like you guys should be just as mad as we are.

[10:51] We're all getting ripped off by these frauds and it's this how you want to celebrate 30 years of your company.

[10:57] Like seeing everyone who went in on this book is about to get ripped off and your company is, is, is all over it.

[11:02] Right. So this whole thing is just kind of like a funny fiasco.

[11:05] I think it's a little bit of like a little bit of karma, a little bit of bad juju.

[11:09] If it were me personally, if it were me personally, I would not give these guys one more penny.

[11:14] I, I would actually get together all 444 of you.

[11:17] I guess what I would do, I would get together and I would sue these clowns.

[11:21] I mean that's the whole point of suing fraudulent people like this.

[11:24] Who lied to you?

[11:25] Who mislead you?

[11:26] Who put you on a 4 year roller coaster ride you didn't want to be on?

[11:29] Like I, I also never understood that part of the Pimball community where you get ripped off.

[11:34] It's clear you're getting ripped off.

[11:36] Most of you guys have some means.

[11:38] You have financial power and when you get ripped off and when you're staring that crook straight in the eye,

[11:43] instead of saying I'm gonna sue your ass and bury your ass, you're so, you're so keen to forgiving and going down the rabbit hole again with the criminals.

[11:53] You really are.

[11:54] Did it with J-pop, did it with Andrew Highway, did it, it happens all the time.

[11:57] When you know you're being lied to for some reason, if Pimball is part of the lie,

[12:02] you're willing to accept it because you might get something that's fun in the Pimball world at the end of that journey.

[12:09] And I'm just here to say, I think all 4 and 40 of you should go get your $55,000 back and sue this clown name.

[12:14] Believe me, this guy has that money in the bank.

[12:16] Believe me, this guy probably has 10 other stupid books he's making, and 10 other hobbies, and you're just one of them.

[12:22] So I really would not, I really would not bend over here on this topic.

[12:26] Alright, so a book about Pimball is harder to make than Pimball itself.

[12:30] So speaking of making Pimball, I keep hearing and my sources are telling me that Led Zeppelin is right around the corner.

[12:36] In fact, I was told that it could be on the line as early as this week, that Led Zeppelin pros are going on the line any day now.

[12:45] And that this game is going to ship to Europe by the first week in December, and that it will be revealed, announced, and shipping before the end of the year.

[12:53] So Stern has their Led Zeppelin cornerstone game will be out this year.

[12:58] Now we've been saying this for a while, so it's sort of not a brand new rumor.

[13:02] This title has been out there in the ether for a very long time.

[13:06] It is not a re-skin game. It is a Steve Richie, fully original title that will be a three tiered system game, so pro premium NLE.

[13:14] And it's coming soon. Now this is fun because we're going to get to see what Jersey Jack has done with a music pin, and we're going to get to see what Stern Pimball has done.

[13:22] Now we all know that there is no way they're going to get the integration level to where guns and roses is, but here's where Zeppelin can win.

[13:29] Here is the sort of the angle Zeppelin can take. I think Zeppelin can be a better shooter than GNR.

[13:36] I'm not saying GNR is a bad shooter, but I think Richie, the king of flow, and speed, if there's... Guns and roses is not like the fastest game.

[13:43] I'm not going to lie and say that. Guns and roses doesn't have the level of speed and intensity that Richie games can have when he really gets that flow going with his machines.

[13:53] I really have a hard time thinking Stern Pimball can put into their machine what Jersey Jack has put into this guns and roses.

[14:00] I mean, guns and roses is just special. It does feel like you're going to a GNR concert and the energy level and the experience of GNR is where it wins.

[14:08] Again, it transcends Pimball shots. It's just the experience. The great thing is this. There's going to be options.

[14:14] Now, timing couldn't be better if you asked me. Look, I know Stern is backlogged, but Stern doesn't care.

[14:19] You guys have to understand something. They don't care that they have three or four or five thousand orders of games to make.

[14:25] They're going to keep making them. They make games every day, 50 plus games a day, because Stern gets paid when distributors place orders.

[14:32] You understand that? Stern gets paid when distributors place orders. And so if customers have to wait, if distributors have to wait, they don't care. They're on their schedule.

[14:41] They have a release schedule of games and unlike every other Pimball company in the world, Stern Pimball is the only company that actually has scheduled releases that are ready to go every year.

[14:52] They have three cornerstone titles a year and they're not going to miss that. They're going to be ready to come out with these games.

[14:58] Look, this is what has history shown us. A game usually comes out like three cornerstones a year. So, wasn't it Ninja Turtles?

[15:04] Isn't that one? Is it Avengers 2 and won't this be the third? Am I missing a game? Stranger Things was last year, came out in December.

[15:13] And so the last few years, Stern has released a game in December. So I tend to believe that we will also get a Stern cornerstone game in December.

[15:23] And it's going to be Led Zeppelin. So it's good. It's also good that we have options. It's also good that Stern is going to ship these games right away.

[15:29] So you want to talk about timing and if Stern can get 500 or so Led Zeppelin Ellie's out the door, you best believe that it's going to be kind of embarrassing if Jersey Jack Pimball revealed Guns & Roses in October.

[15:42] And no collector's editions will go out the door. And meanwhile, Stern Pimball has been able to get every single Avengers Ellie owner their game and will get every single Led Zeppelin Ellie owner their game most likely by the end of January.

[15:57] And I bet that not a single collector's edition makes its way out the door before every single Led Zeppelin Ellie is out the door.

[16:07] Now I don't know if that's going to be the case. I hope they get the collector's editions out the door sooner than later.

[16:12] But it's not looking good for this year for CE owners, alright. Now who's coding Led Zeppelin? We haven't really talked about that.

[16:19] Now I think it's probably if I were to guess I think Tim Sexton will probably do this game with Steve Richie. He did Black Knight with Steve Richie.

[16:27] And it seemed like they had a really good partnership when they made the Black Knight game. So I'm not sure it's not going to be Lyman Sheets, not going to be Dwight.

[16:34] It's not going to be the team that does LWIN's game. So it most likely will be Tim Sexton's sophomore title will be Led Zeppelin.

[16:42] So I look forward to hearing it. The final point I'll make on Zeppelin is this because I hear people saying Zeppelin's bigger than GNR.

[16:47] Yet yes, Zeppelin has sold more albums than Guns and Roses. But the Zeppelin fanbase is older. There's no way around it.

[16:54] If you grew up in the 80s and 90s, chances are you were listening to Guns and Roses far more than Led Zeppelin.

[17:00] So the sweet spot for Pimbal Buying Audience is not Led Zeppelin. We've seen Stern go down this road, Elvis Presley, the Beatles, Zeppelin.

[17:08] When they go to older musical acts, they just don't sell as well. Look at how well ACDC's sold Metallica, Aerosmith.

[17:16] I mean those bands were big. They were huge, huge in the 80s and 90s. You know, not. They weren't just older bands.

[17:22] Even if they were around a longer period of time. I bet you right now that Guns and Roses has more demand within the sweet spot of the Pimbal Buying Audience than Led Zeppelin does. They just do.

[17:32] And also the other part is this. The music of G&R. Just the music itself is so much more well-suited for Pimbal than the music of Led Zeppelin.

[17:42] I don't care if your act is huge. You might not have the musical style that brings the energy for Pimbal.

[17:48] There's a lot of great artists out there that have a lot of Kenny Rogers Pimbal. Would you want to play Kenny Rogers Pimbal?

[17:56] I bet you guys are like, yeah, absolutely. But you know what I'm saying? It's like the music is just a little bit too low energy.

[18:02] It doesn't mean it's not great music. It's just not something that you want to play while you're trying to keep a ball alive and a Pimbal experience.

[18:08] And G&R is just perfect. Like, welcome to the jungle. I mean, it doesn't get any better than that.

[18:13] So speaking of G&R and the experience of G&R, have you seen this thread? There is a gentleman. There is a company trying to sell Guns and Roses toppers.

[18:22] And it's stadium lighting. It's not stadium lighting. It's like stage lighting. It's like these two stage lighting cubes kind of that have rotating lights that you put on top of the game.

[18:32] And it's TNT. It's not TNT. It's not TOTUCKY's TNT. It's another TNT guy on Pinside.

[18:38] And he's selling these lights and they've got the Guns and Roses logo and stickers all over them.

[18:44] And he's also showing video of how they work on top of the machine. How you can even make your machine look more like going to a G&R concert.

[18:52] So there's been a debate on whether or not this guy is just repurposing stuff he's found on Amazon and selling it for a lot more money.

[19:00] I think he's charging $400 for this top or these two light systems that go on top of the machine.

[19:06] Now a few things. Yolo Bird. Yolo Bird is one of the most stand up modders in the community. He called them out a little bit. He's like, look are these, are these just these things I'm finding on Amazon.

[19:16] And there's a back and forth debate between the two where the guys like, no, these are more professional and yadda yadda yadda. Here's all I know is this.

[19:22] I don't want to debate whether or not these are worth it because personally I don't think they're worth $400.

[19:27] The part that I do want to call out is this. This company has no permission on planet earth to sell what they're selling. I hit up Eric and I said, Eric, are these like, are you guys like giving this guy permission to put the guns and roses logo and the guns and roses artwork all over these lights to sell them for $400 because they look like officially license products when you do that.

[19:50] You need to have IP permission to do that and Eric's like, this is the first I'm hearing about this. So you best believe there's going to be a cease and desist letter coming from Jersey Jack Pimball to protect the IP of their Pimball machine and their game guns and roses and they should do that.

[20:05] They should like this is you just can't stick the guns and roses name and IP onto your mod and then try to sell it for all this money. If you look at the mods Lee or makes he has to be very careful not to do something that infringes on the IP of guns and roses.

[20:20] And so I'm just a pure a can this guy sell this mod this way the answer is no and this things are going to get shut down the moment people over at JJP listen to canators pinball podcasts and the moment this guy hears canators pinball podcasts he's going to realize you can't do this.

[20:35] You can't capitalize and make money off of someone else's IP without paying them any money. I'm sorry like that that really is you can't do it especially guns and roses and this game itself like JJP will be making another top for the LE.

[20:49] They will be making stuff and they deserve to get the money from the mods that they create for this game not other people especially if you're going to put the guns and roses name on it like that's Jersey Jack Pimball's right to make that money that slashes right to determine who gets to use his IP not yours because you found some lighting system somewhere and you slapped a name on it. No that's not how it works.

[21:11] Now speaking of copyright infringement in this and that so for some of you out there this week and you got a little treat I was just you know isn't it good mood we're finally getting past all the election BS and I decided to upload something that you know I probably shouldn't have just because you know it's not material that's mine to share it's stuff that leaked out in the world and it's all the unheard songs of guns and roses that surfaced about a year ago it was all the material

[21:35] that the New Yorker Rose had been working on with the new members of guns and roses circa 1999 2001 and it was just an interesting sort of show where I went down memory lane with this band and showed the kind of music axle was working on when he was working on Chinese democracy some of the tracks made it on some didn't some are just instrumental and so for those of you out there you got a real treat you got to hear these songs of guns and roses that the world has never heard it's no longer up I'm sorry it was a little like short term like flip the switch gives some of the music and it's not going to be a lot of the same way.

[22:05] I'm going to do something to the Canadian pinball fan base who follow me who listen to me this is a treat for those who listen to my show the moment it goes up for those of you out there there was a 24 hour period where you got to hear brand new guns and roses music that no one's ever heard and you know what the early bird gets the worm it's no longer up it's no longer going up I mean it was just something I'm going to do every once in a while let you guys hear stuff now I keep getting people emailing me about you know can you air episode 500 this is the one everybody is going to be

[22:35] on the way to the world and I just don't think it paints Jersey Jack Pimball in a light that they deserve to be painted right now and well and I said it like this company's got its hottest title out right now they're dealing with quality control issues on the game which I know there's a lot of people

[23:05] who are working on and I just I just don't want to come back to pinball podcasting and just sour sour like our feelings around these companies that are designed to bring us joy and entertainment and just for me personally and the gentleman who I interviewed around this company we just felt like we've moved on so I think for many of you out there who are still waiting for that you're going to be waiting a very long time okay let me make this deal if if deep root pinball can ship a game by the end of the year I will release a little segment of that

[23:35] episode 500 that I think you will find interesting that I think you will enjoy if they can get retro atomic zombie adventure land off the ground by the end of the year how's that for for a for a bet you know it's funny you could pretty much offer anything up if deep root ships a game and you're probably going to be safe on your bet now deep

[23:52] root pinball they've promised some of their people behind closed doors now that they will be getting razors by the end of the year and I don't know if they mean this year or which year but man it's it's closing fast the window of 2020 releases is closing very quickly now

[24:08] speaking of windows closing quickly I want to talk about the twippies I've been meaning to bring this up I don't think in a COVID year in which we all know that there is most likely not

[24:19] going to be pinball shows come March I'm just saying this isn't a personal attack against shows I love T.P.F. I want to go to T.P.F. but I can't see in a million years Texas pinball festival going as planned you know maybe they open it up and maybe people locally will go but there is no way

[24:38] people are going to be flying in from all over the country and all over the world to go to T.P.F.

[24:42] and so that doesn't happen if you don't have a lot of people traveling to T.P.F.

[24:47] then it makes absolutely no sense to have the twippy awards at T.P.F. because you are not going to have anybody who's supposed to get up there and give speeches and accept their trophies at T.P.F.

[24:58] and also I've always felt this way you celebrate the best games of the year three months after the year is over like the wait is too long I can hear Jeff being like Chris you don't know what goes into making the twippy's Jeff I understand

[25:12] and I don't know everything that goes into making the twippy's but surely surely we could have voting and at the end of December and have the show some time at the end of January early February I mean why not why not why can't we do it and I am pushing right now for the T.P.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F

[25:42] so I'm here right now in Canada's Pimbal Podcast to push to have the twippy sometime in January early February if the Academy Award can do it you can do it Jeff I believe in you brother but I think it would be great and look if it's virtual if this whole thing is going to be virtual again and it's going to be online you don't have to do the whole green screen crazy production like that either like it wasn't live they recorded that show and then just aired it live now if you remember the first twippy's were live like they were live and I think

[26:12] there's a middle ground where you can do the show live the hard part with live and I loved how they did it last year with the acceptance videos obviously I made the best acceptance video in the history of Pimbal acceptance videos I mean you know I know some people didn't like it but if you didn't like that you don't have a sense of humor but obviously if you're going to do it live it's probably hard to go live for people to accept their awards I get it I get there's challenges but here's the thing it's November we can figure it out we can figure it out it's too early to start talking about twippy voting I don't know it never is it never is anyway all right so that's my feelings around

[26:42] the twippy's that we should move it earlier on all right should we see what's for sale on Pinside real quickly just this Monday morning you know is it a good price or is it a crack pipe price let's see let's see for sale Tron Legacy Pro Tron Pro check out this price 7200 bucks for a Tron Pro that's a really nice crack pipe you know when you smoke crack it makes you wake up and charge 7200 bucks for a Tron Legacy Pro not worth it people all right let's see

[27:12] start trek the next generation 5500 bucks 5500 for start trek next generation that's not too bad that's not too bad if the conditions good I would definitely think about a start trek next generation that that game to me if you ever play the game

[27:26] where you want toys and you want fun stuff and you want to see the ball do wow stuff to me start trek next generation probably is one of the coolest world

[27:33] under glasses ever in pinball ever in pinball and it's got deep code I mean the game is really really awesome now it also feels like a mechanical

[27:41] nightmare to keep it going I still love that game that game always makes me smile when I play this was an interesting

[27:48] sale item there's an iron maiden legacy it was a premium but this guy had done so much work to it I mean he had the Egyptian

[27:56] theme premium had the top her but then all of the armor was like beautifully custom airbrushed and gold and it just

[28:03] looked stellar I mean it basically does look better than any Ellie now he was able to sell this iron made in premium

[28:10] for 8,999 dollars and it says sale pending so this just goes to show if you take a premium and you you put so much

[28:21] into it that you might find someone who considers it to be worth that much more because remember the premium was 7,500 so that's

[28:29] a lot of extra money for this game now people have to see the value in the mods you've done and clearly when he listed out

[28:36] everything done to this game the value was there now for some of you out there I know people are like you're never

[28:42] going to get your money back if you if you paint the coin door you're never going to get your money back if you

[28:46] brass plate everything and I think you're wrong I think you're wrong if you do a lot of really nice stuff and if people

[28:52] out there know the amount of time energy that goes into you know getting your game painted and getting stuff

[28:59] modded or sort of upgraded you know when I had my toad in the other part that people don't get you have to

[29:04] sometimes like take your game apart and wait for months to get the powder coded stuff back so your game is

[29:11] out of commission for months it's also a headache to tear some of these games apart to make stuff brass played it so if

[29:18] someone's gone through all of that effort there are people out there that will recognize the amount of time that went into

[29:25] that as well not just the material costs but the time it takes to put all that stuff back together that's why that

[29:31] hep a theater of magic was such a great buy because you will never be able to do that level of work yourself and you

[29:39] know that guy clearly spent twenty thousand dollars all in on getting that hep game so to get it for like eight grand

[29:46] less was such a good buy all right monster bash Ellie for eight thousand forty dollars now is that a good price

[29:54] or a crack pipe price now look monster bash Ellie is pretty brand new game right so you're not going to find one

[30:00] that's destroyed this is a home use game you know that's what like roughly a thousand dollars less than it is new

[30:08] but they did make a lot of monster bash Ellie's I would say you know that's a good price I do think that's a good

[30:14] price for monster bash sometimes when I look at a monster bash Ellie which comes with that phenomenal

[30:18] topper and the game itself is packed the sculpts are beautiful the game is a ton of fun for eight grand I

[30:25] absolutely would be in on this title because you got to remember now to when you look at these CGC games and

[30:30] you look at them they come with the topper they come with the beautiful armor they come with all this amazing

[30:35] stuff stern pinball wouldn't give you that topper for free I mean stern pinball would sell you that monster bash topper

[30:41] for a thousand dollars and so now all of a sudden these CGC games loaded with toppers are starting to feel like really

[30:49] good buys next to stern pinball because every stern Ali with a topper now for the most part is a ten thousand

[30:54] two hundred dollar game so I do think that is a good price all right let's read a few emails and then

[31:00] we're gonna let you guys go on your Monday you know first I don't hear from you guys as much as I used to

[31:05] so if you want to email canada it's canada pinball at gmail.com I think it's a little bit cyclical like the

[31:11] more I read your emails out the more likely you are to share your thoughts with me so let's do that I got

[31:17] an email from Eddie and he said GNR special hey Chris just wanted to give you a shout out from crazy

[31:23] down under thoroughly enjoyed your GNR music special podcast among all your regular pinball ones was a

[31:30] refreshing change while catching up on paperwork I like to use the regular podcast to motivate me when

[31:36] working on pins all night this one was perfectly time for me keep up the good work don't let the

[31:42] haters rile you up the only way they can beat you for twippy is vote rigging thanks for coming back and

[31:49] keeping us entertained you're the only podcast in my book unless Ryan came back let alone the number

[31:55] one podcast cheers from australia Eddie well Eddie thank you so much thank you so much I am not

[32:01] gonna claim that it was rigged if if I lose the twippy voting this year and Ryan is back on his

[32:07] Jesse J show on the pinball network so if you haven't you should definitely catch a final round to

[32:13] Eddie because Ryan and Marty were back together see that Ryan and Marty back together is like

[32:18] slash an axle like well those two are together that is just epic now I love Jeff T. Olis too so

[32:24] I think the three of them they have such good chemistry together hopefully they can make it all work

[32:28] but I also you know I love the Jesse J show too I want to say thank you to David Denholz who is a new

[32:34] patreon subscriber to canadus pinball podcast thank you David and thank you to mark Nellis as well

[32:39] thank you guys or Nellis thank you so much for donating to canadus pinball podcast I really

[32:45] really do appreciate it I got an email from Steve Paradisi says that you are into arcade machines

[32:51] as well as pinball is there any site like pinside for our Cades somewhere people buy and sell

[32:57] machines Steve well Steve yes there is now I'm gonna break it to you right now Steve that place

[33:03] hates me more than pinside it's called clav I think it's like killer list of something of video

[33:09] games it's such a weird it's so weird that clav is like the abbreviation of it because I think

[33:13] there's more stuff in it but clav is definitely the place you want to go if you want to start collecting

[33:18] arcade games if you want to start talking to people about old arcade games and if you want to buy

[33:23] and sell old arcade machines now look I've never really had a problem with clav they always had a

[33:28] problem with me and my problems in these communities always come from one place no first first off

[33:34] I never ripped off some kid for fix it field exterior it's all well documented I have all the emails

[33:39] from him being like we're cool everything's fine we settled our dispute and that was seven years

[33:43] ago okay but people will still bring it up today they'll still bring it up today since then I

[33:47] think I've probably spent over a hundred thousand dollars or more on pinball machines and arcade

[33:53] machines easily now you know I bought stuff I've sold stuff right now I only own two arcade

[33:57] machines but over a hundred thousand dollars in in games and stuff have come through this apartment

[34:03] right have I ripped off anybody else is there this story of canada who's always like ripping people

[34:08] off you go ask people how quickly I paid them for stuff and they will tell you this guy is nothing but

[34:14] a legit buyer of this stuff but here's the thing the problem with this community in the arcade world

[34:20] and same thing with pinball if you want something that's really nice and you want it immediately

[34:25] these gentlemen get really upset when people come in and offer top dollar on something so let

[34:30] me give you a really quick example in the neo geo world right now everyone looks at my neo geo

[34:35] sc19 a little candy cap from Japan okay now if you ask people what is this thing worth everyone says

[34:40] that it's worth three thousand dollars okay three thousand dollars will most likely find you one

[34:45] in Japan that's not in good condition that needs to be shipped overseas for all those people in

[34:50] America who have them they rarely ever get sold and if they do get sold that they rarely are sold

[34:56] on a public forum like a Facebook or a group they're sold privately amongst the collectors so if

[35:01] you are like me and you're not like in bed with these people and don't want to spend so many hours

[35:06] like building these were relationships over a period of years before they'll even let you into

[35:11] the marketplace let me tell you that on the neo geo forum they won't even let you into the marketplace

[35:15] unless they they validate you unless you give enough time and energy to them that's such BS like

[35:21] I grew up with neo geo why do I have to like simply kiss the ass of a community before they allow me

[35:26] to buy some games like hey guys I want to buy your products nope you can't buy until we feel like

[35:31] you're allowed to own these things like what world do you need permission to own these things anyway

[35:37] so everyone will say it's only worth three thousand dollars now me being me I don't want to have to

[35:41] search Japanese auction sites all day long I don't want to spend like so many hours like getting

[35:47] to know the people before they'll even allow me to see what's available so I'll go in and say okay

[35:52] you said it's worth three I see that none are available all offer four thousand dollars for one

[35:56] and guess what happens when you offer four thousand dollars for one nobody will sell it and then

[36:01] everyone who says it's only worth three thousand dollars I'll come back and say okay I'll give

[36:04] someone five thousand dollars for one and guess what happens when you offer five thousand dollars

[36:09] for a game that everyone says it's worth three guess what happens nobody offers to sell it

[36:13] so how is it worth three thousand dollars I'm offering five and yet nobody will sell

[36:18] the game. We're seeing the same thing right now, GNRC, right? If you offered $12.5 for

[36:22] a GNRC, which is what people think it's worth, you're not going to get anyone to sell it.

[36:27] If you offered $13,000, you're not going to get it. $14,000, you're not going to get it. There's

[36:31] a price you need to offer where someone says, you know, now I will let it go. And so when I offered

[36:37] $6,000 for a mint restored Neo Geo SC19, it was only when I offered that much money. Did someone

[36:45] say, yes, I will make you one. I will restore one for you. I will find one. And his name was

[36:51] Grant Stevens. And he sold me one. And it's beautiful. It's mint. I love it. I'm happy. He's happy.

[36:56] Now you guess what? Guess what, Steve? Guess who's not happy about that deal? Everyone else in the

[37:01] community is upset because they say, look at Canada. He's ruining this hobby by him spending that much

[37:07] money on this game. Guess what happens? All of a sudden, a mint version of an SC19, people are

[37:12] going to now think is worth $6,000. And guess what? When Grant was restoring it for me, many people

[37:18] tried to buy the game out from underneath me for $6,000. Okay. So that's the nature of this hobby.

[37:24] And I'm ruining it now because what they'll say is this, he's jacking prices up. By him doing that,

[37:30] now everyone's going to like hold on to their games more or sell them for really high prices.

[37:35] Because what these people really want is they want to go back to a time in which getting all of

[37:39] these old arcade machines was cheap. I mean, we see the same thing in Pimbaugh. I mean, I was talking

[37:43] in my boy Greg Colton about how much money he spent to get his games. He was saying he bought like

[37:47] his Lord of the Rings for 500 bucks. 500 bucks? He went down a list of what he spent on his machines.

[37:52] I mean, you could get all of these hot games from, you know, like the late 90s, like early 2000s,

[37:58] for just a few hundred bucks, $1,000 here, $2,000 there. Now all of a sudden, everyone thinks like

[38:03] an Adam's family is worth $9,000. Like it's crazy. It's crazy. And so look, but right now,

[38:09] arcade in Pimbaugh is hot. Right now, if you want something nice and in good condition,

[38:14] you're going to have to pay a lot for it. And if you're like me, I don't want to own something

[38:18] that's beat up. Like if I'm going to put something in my home and I'm going to have it as like a

[38:22] museum piece and it's going to be like the grail of my collection, I want it to be in good condition.

[38:27] And this is also why we're seeing like the play field issues be such a big issue.

[38:31] Is collectors want stuff that's nice? Look, if two people have the same game, but ones in

[38:36] mint condition, and ones beat up, which one do you think? Which one do you think a collector's

[38:40] going to want to own? And it's like this in every category. Like if the Rolex is all scratched up,

[38:44] or if the transformer box is all dented up, you want the one that's mint if you're a collector.

[38:50] It's just something about collectors in OCD nature. All right, but go to clav.

[38:53] Steve, you should go there and tell him, can he to send you? See it all happen. See the kind of

[38:57] reception you get if you tell him that. All right, and I know I pronounced his name wrong and I'm

[39:01] sorry. It was Huda. Chris, good of you to honor the memories of Huda and Cos from Pinside.

[39:07] Thought you should know that Huda is pronounced Huda not Huda. Terry Richie Huda selected this

[39:13] username because he was a Cincinnati Bangle fan. For what it's worth, the origin of this term is

[39:20] Huda. Is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals in use for over 30

[39:26] years. Their chant is Huda, Huda, Huda. The chant is Huda, Huda, Huda, Huda think going to

[39:31] beat them Bengals. The answer screamed in unison. Nobody. Sometimes fans will instead shout Huda to

[39:38] represent the entire cheer. It's funny that this is the chant because everybody seems to be beating

[39:43] the Bengals these days. But also he goes on to say also as someone who has a GnR Ellie on order,

[39:49] I agree with you 100% regarding the latest play field BS going on with Mirko, Jersey Jack, and Stern.

[39:56] Thanks for speaking out against this Tim Leonard Tim. Thank you for the email. It is Huda.

[40:01] You know, it really was sad to see the loss of Terry and John in the community. And to see the

[40:07] outpouring of support for both of those gentlemen was really nice to read and I know their families

[40:12] are probably reading that being like, man, this is what happens when you spend so much time on Pinside.

[40:17] But this is all it is people. We're all sort of a pseudo family whether we like it or not,

[40:23] like whether we like it or not, when all of us get together at Pimball shows, let me tell you

[40:27] what everyone else in the hotel is doing. They are texting their friends saying the biggest

[40:31] losers on planet earth are at this hotel right now. They are. They you understand like as much as

[40:37] we bicker back and forth, everyone else in the world looks at us like losers. Like it's just that

[40:43] simple. It is not cool to anyone else out there what we spend so much of our time on. But to us,

[40:50] we don't care. I don't care if people think it's lame. I don't care like if I tell people I've

[40:54] the words number one Pimball podcast and they're like, what? What? What? You know, I don't care because

[40:59] it's enjoyable. And this is something that makes us smile and the product itself, there's the reason

[41:04] why billionaires like Leonard go into Pimball because it's just fun that at the end of this

[41:08] journey is a new Pimball machine. It can be a lot like it's so many, you know, think about like all

[41:12] the people, the millions of people that spend their time listening to political podcasts and all it

[41:17] does is make them unhappy. All it does is enrage them. You know what's funny, those I think about it.

[41:21] Like isn't that all Pimball does to all of us? Isn't rage us and make us unhappy when we listen

[41:25] to shows about Pimball? Anyway, I got an email from James Fogg and he said, hey, Chris, I must admit,

[41:30] I have never really given Wonka a chance. I hate the artwork. Like really hate it. But having watched

[41:35] the show slow mo Pimball video, I think that the shot layout and haptrails look amazing. Do you

[41:43] think that Pimball's that flop should be re-themed? Cash save for the company. Also, why can Pimball

[41:48] companies just do one version of the game? One game, $8,000, silk screened to be honest, the golden

[41:56] figure for a pin is 6850 euros. So I think that's like 8 grand. He says, I consider myself lucky,

[42:02] I could buy a few nice pins, but with the current issues, why would you? I'm happy with the mid 90s

[42:08] pins at the moment. Like I said, Wonka has all the makings of a great game, but man, that theme

[42:14] is a hard sell. To be honest, I would actually consider Wonka if it had a comic book style art,

[42:19] but I really don't like Photoshop art. Anyway, hope the legs okay. Many thanks and still love the show.

[42:25] That's from James. So James, thank you so much. Let me address this real quickly. So James,

[42:29] we've talked about whether or not a three tiered model or one tiered model works for Pimball games.

[42:34] Obviously, the three tiered model is the best for a Pimball company to make money. You give

[42:38] something to the collectors that's limited. You give the other people who want the features, the same

[42:43] things without the bells and whistles on the vanity play and you make the premium and then you

[42:48] give something for operators who don't need any of that fancy stuff. They just need a good theme

[42:52] to get people to play the games and that's the pro. And I think that is the best model. Now, if you

[42:57] want to make only one version of the game, a la Rick and Morty, a la the big Lebowski, that's

[43:02] also fine, but what's what's a common theme with the companies that only make one version?

[43:07] The ones that have been successful have had hot themes and have limited the number of games they're

[43:11] going to make. Like you could say you're only going to make 200 Celts and it's all the same trim,

[43:16] but you're not going to sell 200 Celts because of the theme and because of the game and because of

[43:20] you know, other variables. So it's not just rarity that will make people buy your game. It needs to have

[43:25] good theme needs to be a great game. But the three tiered model is what you need to do if you want

[43:30] to sell at volume. Okay. Now, do I think they should reskin Willy Wonka? No, I think Wonka had

[43:35] its chance. Pat Lawler takes almost three years to make his pinball machines. You get one shot.

[43:39] I mean, that's always my feeling in pinball. You get one shot. There's too many games out there

[43:44] where a flop needs to be reskinned. It's like, look at dialed in. All the effort that went into

[43:49] dialed in. You can't go reskinning now. You can't go make dialed in toy story. It's also because

[43:54] the pinball buying community, it's too small. Like it's way too small. We all remember what it

[44:00] used to be. If you're going to reskin something, it's just not going to work. Now, look, Batman did it

[44:05] with Batman 66, but it was at least it was Batman before, right? You can make that argument. And

[44:10] also so much time had passed between that Batman and the 66 Batman. But you know, I think with all

[44:16] the new games out there, you get one shot to make your game work if it doesn't work too bad. Like,

[44:22] you're going to have to go back to the drawing board with a new design. But thank you for the

[44:25] note, James. And the the the foot is feeling better. It doesn't hurt. I just can't put much weight on

[44:30] it, which sucks because I'm still on crutches. And I got this stupid knee scooter that I just look

[44:34] like an idiot on. All right. I'll read some more emails at a later date. But everyone, if you want to

[44:39] email me, you can a to pinball at gmail.com. This has been episode 528. It's the start of a new

[44:44] America people. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. Well, we'll happen first. Well,

[44:48] Trump can see it or we'll raza get out the door. Who knows? Who knows? But here, I just

[44:52] implore all of you be safe. Be safe. If you're watching the news, besides the election, the numbers of

[44:57] cases of COVID continue to go up and up. And I don't want to lose any of you guys to this. I think it's

[45:02] silly to go out that way. There's things we can do. But do your part. Do your part. Wear mask.

[45:07] Be out there. Be safe. And you know, we'll see hopefully we'll get some shows again. But I just

[45:11] don't think it's going to happen unless we all do our part. The more we all are responsible here,

[45:16] the faster we'll get back to some of the things we enjoy. And May 2021 be a better year than 2020.

[45:22] I don't know though. I don't know. I think it's going to be a lot of the same. They just told us

[45:26] at work that the office is pretty much closed probably until halfway through next year. I don't

[45:31] know what I'm doing in New York City. I really got to find a new place. We have to find a spot with

[45:36] more room for us. If we're just going to be stuck here and we're not even walking to work, it's

[45:40] crazy. There's nothing to go do. We're just sitting here trying to be safe. We go through walks

[45:45] around the block, but there's just nowhere to go. There's no point in living in a city if you're

[45:49] not close to where you work. There's just no point. I could be in the Bahamas right now and

[45:53] signing into these calls. Everybody have a great Monday. We'll talk to you soon.
