[00:00] Hey everybody, it's George Gomez at Stern Pinball.

[00:07] What you see right here is the beginning of Stern Pinball Shark Week.

[00:13] This is the Jaws game you've always wanted.

[00:17] It's got absolutely everything you can imagine.

[00:21] It's got film clips from all of the Jaws films.

[00:24] It's got an award-winning soundtrack with John Williams' music.

[00:27] It's got custom speech from Richard Dreyfus.

[00:30] Shoot again!

[00:31] And of course, it's got what is going to be the most famous shark in pinball.

[00:38] You all know that I'm very proud of the development studio here at Stern Pinball.

[00:43] This comes from the Monster Makers.

[00:46] You're going to want to play this.

[00:49] The game features Stern's best in class technology, both physical and digital.

[00:57] Like all of our games, Jaws Pinball has lots of secret features.

[01:02] And now who better than the designer himself, Keith Elwin?

[01:05] I'm Keith Elwin, lead game designer of our newest pinball machine, Jaws.

[01:16] We wanted to bring you the Jaws game you've always dreamed of.

[01:20] Loaded with assets from the film, custom speech by Richard Dreyfus.

[01:24] Shoot again!

[01:26] It's a sunny day in New England.

[01:29] This shark, swallow you home.

[01:33] Experienced Jaws, like never before.

[01:35] And it's a kinetically satisfying, fast-paced, thrilling pinball adventure from Stern Pinball.

[01:42] You're going to need a bigger game.

[01:55] Oh, welcome everybody.

[02:07] Happy Monday morning.

[02:08] I'm super excited to do this show.

[02:10] We're going to talk about Jaws gameplay.

[02:12] Keith Elwin did a pre-recorded gameplay video.

[02:16] So it was kind of strange that they live streamed it on YouTube.

[02:19] Like we're all there chatting live.

[02:21] The video is pre-recorded.

[02:23] We did an amazing Irish exit after playing one game.

[02:27] I will say this.

[02:28] Keith Elwin is one of the greatest designers in the history of pinball.

[02:32] Maybe the greatest designer, but he doesn't really have the charisma to be a salesperson

[02:39] of his own games.

[02:40] I think everybody was hoping we'd get more of the design team, but hey, we're going

[02:44] to get that this Friday.

[02:46] That's always a deeper dive and a lot more fun.

[02:48] You know, you grab a whiskey.

[02:50] You've got the software engineers.

[02:52] You've got the design.

[02:53] You've got the mechanical people.

[02:54] You've got everybody in the house having a good time playing Jaws pinball.

[02:59] We're going to get that a week after you have to pay in full for your limited edition version

[03:03] of Jaws.

[03:04] So we're going to talk about my feelings on the game now that we've seen a lot more

[03:08] about this game.

[03:10] My first thought was Jack Guinari wasn't telling the truth when he said the only thing you

[03:15] could get in Jaws was the shark.

[03:17] You couldn't get any assets from the movie.

[03:20] This thing is filled to the chum bucket with assets.

[03:23] I mean, it's got almost every asset you could want from the movie itself.

[03:27] So we're going to talk about that.

[03:29] I'm going to read some feedback from Pinside because whenever a new game comes out, it's

[03:33] interesting to see like the polarization it creates within the pinball community.

[03:38] I want to read some people's feedback.

[03:40] I'm going to give you my opinions, of course, and then I'm going to give you that mystery

[03:44] game I've been talking about.

[03:46] I mean, this is something when I tell you what it's going to be, it's going to trigger

[03:50] a response from people and I can't wait to do that.

[03:53] We will do that at the end of this show.

[03:55] So let's talk about this Jaws gameplay stream.

[03:58] I've watched it three times now.

[04:00] I watched it last night.

[04:02] I was on like YouTube with a lot of you and Stern was there.

[04:06] Some of the design team was there and it was kind of weird, right?

[04:09] Because it was pre-recorded and it just starts and it was basically Keith Elwin just playing

[04:14] one game of Jaws.

[04:16] Playing one game of Jaws.

[04:17] He's an incredible player.

[04:19] He makes a game look really easy.

[04:21] So it's hard to tell if the game is going to be difficult or not when you watch Keith

[04:24] Elwin play because he's one of the best players in the world.

[04:27] So what are my overall thoughts on Jaws pinball?

[04:30] It's kind of hard, right?

[04:31] I will say this.

[04:32] The first time I started watching the stream, I was just enamored by the amount of assets

[04:38] they have in this game because that was the big question mark.

[04:42] Are we going to see Brody's face?

[04:44] Are we going to hear from Brody?

[04:46] Are we going to see clips from the movie?

[04:48] And it's all in there.

[04:49] I mean, you don't just see Brody.

[04:51] You hear his callouts.

[04:52] Roy Scheiders' callouts are all throughout this game.

[04:55] It almost doesn't even matter that he's not on the artwork on the play field.

[04:59] He is throughout this entire game.

[05:02] And it's interesting that you play as Quint because if you follow the Jaws movies, it

[05:07] doesn't end well for Quint.

[05:09] And it's interesting too because Richard Dreyfus did all the callouts and we saw that video

[05:14] clip from Stern Pinball of them in the recording studio and Dreyfus is just laying down some

[05:20] monotone callouts.

[05:22] He's like, Jackpot, triple jackpot.

[05:25] It's almost like he's asking a question of Elwyn in the studio.

[05:27] He's like, do you really want me to say super triple jackpot?

[05:30] Like, come on, Richard, you're an actor.

[05:33] When is Stern going to direct these people to do more animated callouts?

[05:36] We saw the same thing with Stranger Things.

[05:38] They were horrible.

[05:39] And I don't know why they keep doing this.

[05:42] It's not that Richard Dreyfus is too old to be more animated because we got the same sort

[05:46] of monotone callouts from the sheriff from Stranger Things.

[05:50] And he's a young dude.

[05:51] It's just weird to me that Stern just allows these actors to mail it in and that's it.

[05:56] Like you're not going to get another chance.

[05:58] So next time, I hope they get someone to like guide these people.

[06:02] It's almost like Stern doesn't even know how to make the callout sound exciting.

[06:06] So I was just enamored by the assets and I love the way the game starts.

[06:10] You know, Chief Brody, the music gets into that Jaws kind of music, Amity Island kind

[06:15] of music vibe.

[06:16] You see his truck and all of a sudden you're transported to the movie.

[06:21] It reminded me so much.

[06:22] This game reminds me from an asset standpoint of Batman 66, which is a really good thing.

[06:28] Like it starts off and it instantly transports you into the world of Jaws in the perfect

[06:34] way possible.

[06:35] Right?

[06:36] So if you're a fan of this franchise and you hit the start button on this game, you

[06:39] are teleported right into the movie that you love.

[06:43] And what I loved to when I was watching the assets, I loved the fact that Stern is giving

[06:48] us full screen LCD images of the movie throughout the game.

[06:54] It's not overly complicated.

[06:55] There's never too much stuff on the screen.

[06:58] I think Jersey Jack pinball needs to take a page here.

[07:01] Don't fill a screen with way too much stuff.

[07:03] If you bought all the assets and you have this iconic movie with characters and the video

[07:09] and the audio is synced up in this game, right?

[07:12] This isn't some Jersey Jack.

[07:14] This isn't like Willy Wonka where like none of the clips are synced up with the voices.

[07:18] Everything is pulled right from the movie and they let the movie do the talking.

[07:22] They don't overdo it.

[07:24] Like you don't have 15 things flying across the screen while you're trying to watch the

[07:28] movie scene.

[07:29] And I also like the way the game stages the ball in the in lanes.

[07:33] When those posts pop up, there's a reason why.

[07:35] It gives you some time to watch some of those clips, absorb what you're doing, get into

[07:40] the mode and then you get going, right?

[07:43] And there's a lot of get going in this game with hurry up modes and countdowns and timers.

[07:48] I like that.

[07:49] It adds a sense of urgency and energy to a theme that I think we all were a little bit

[07:53] worried about would be a little bit stale and boring.

[07:56] Okay, so the assets are there.

[07:58] Okay, so that's really, really good.

[08:01] Now I want to say something I didn't like as I was watching the game.

[08:06] It seems like the assets are jumping all over the place.

[08:10] Like there's so much going on.

[08:12] And I was just watching about a two minute mode that Keith Elwin was playing and it's

[08:17] jumping around from Quint tying a knot to a dog running on the beach to them chasing

[08:23] the shark on the orca to being in the classroom where Quint is explaining to the city officials

[08:29] something like it was just jumping all over the place, all over the movies.

[08:35] And that was a little bit worrisome to me because I don't like when it starts to do

[08:39] that.

[08:40] And I get there's a lot of objectives and there's a lot of stuff to do.

[08:43] But I also think you need to be able to intimately stay in the moment that you're in with the

[08:48] game.

[08:49] And if you keep jumping all over the place, I think it gets really confusing.

[08:53] It just breaks up your connection to the thing you're trying to do.

[08:57] And this is one of the problems with games that give you a lot of things to do at once.

[09:02] Like when you can stack like four or five things at once, sure, that's great for a tournament

[09:07] player that's trying to get to a high score.

[09:10] So we know Elwin's mindset is in that mindset.

[09:13] But the problem is when you have all that stuff going at once, it really starts to be

[09:18] like way too many ingredients going into the pot at once.

[09:22] And it's all over the place on the LCD screen.

[09:25] So I didn't like that.

[09:26] I found that to be very distracting.

[09:28] And I don't know if there's any solution to that.

[09:30] But the good news is this is when you're playing pinball, you're really not staring at the

[09:34] screen that much.

[09:36] Like you're seeing that stuff with just quick glances up.

[09:40] And so it's probably not nearly as distracting when you're playing the game as it is when

[09:44] you're watching a stream of somebody play the game.

[09:47] All right, so there was that.

[09:49] Then we get to the 3D video mode.

[09:51] I know some people are like divided on this thing, but I got to just encourage each and

[09:55] every one of us.

[09:56] Don't let the child inside you die.

[09:59] You're still all man children.

[10:01] If you're buying these things, you need to still look at the world through the eyes of

[10:05] a child.

[10:07] And if I brought Killian over to Jaws Pinball and put those 3D glasses on him and allowed

[10:13] him to play that video mode, he would be super excited.

[10:16] I think this is super cool that this is the first pinball machine ever where you can put

[10:22] on 3D glasses and play a video mode.

[10:25] And the fact that they made the video mode based on the shark arcade game from the movie

[10:30] is super freaking awesome.

[10:33] And anyone who's moaning about this, come on guys, like you don't even have to do the

[10:37] 3D mode.

[10:38] I saw people being like, what are operators going to do with 3D glasses?

[10:42] Well, then you just disable the 3D feature.

[10:44] Who cares?

[10:45] Like seriously, seriously, some of these people just want to pee in the corn flakes of people

[10:49] that want to get excited about pinball.

[10:51] So I thought that was super awesome.

[10:53] But did you notice what Keith Elwin said?

[10:56] He puts on these really cool hard plastic 3D glasses and he says, your game's going to

[11:01] come with 3D glasses, not as nice as these.

[11:05] Those glasses he had on have to be no more than like $10 or so.

[11:10] And you're telling me, Sturm, for this much money, you're not going to send people really

[11:15] nice 3D glasses.

[11:17] Come on.

[11:18] Anyone who buys an LE should have their 3D glasses say Jaws LE Limited Edition glasses.

[11:25] Like how cool would they be?

[11:26] Like white 3D glasses with the blue and red lenses and just add a little something special

[11:32] that becomes a memento to go with the game.

[11:35] And now I'm worried Sturm's going to mail out those cheap paper 3D glasses when you

[11:41] just dropped over $10,000 on a pinball machine.

[11:44] Come on, Sturm.

[11:46] You always find a way to do the cheap way out.

[11:48] All right, so we got that.

[11:50] Okay, so now the next part of this game is this.

[11:53] How does the game shoot?

[11:54] What was the gameplay like?

[11:57] And I'll say this, the game looks like it's got a lot of flow.

[12:00] The game looks really fast.

[12:02] You know, we don't really see the shark very often.

[12:04] And here's my overall take on the gameplay because I watched this video three times and

[12:08] I mean it when I say this.

[12:10] I did find the gameplay in Jaws to be underwhelming.

[12:15] It just didn't feel like there was anything that was like, wow, like a magic moment in

[12:21] the gameplay itself.

[12:22] It felt like the upper playfield wasn't even necessary.

[12:26] It just felt like that upper playfield, it doesn't really have a point.

[12:30] There's not like a mode where the upper playfield comes to life and it just feels like you're

[12:35] using that upper playfield to divert the ball into a different direction.

[12:39] But other than that, you don't really need it.

[12:41] So you strip away the upper playfield, which seems unnecessary.

[12:45] And then what do you got in the game?

[12:47] You've got the boat up the middle that you bash, the shark pops up and you hit him only

[12:51] once.

[12:52] Like it's really not like a wow moment.

[12:54] It's not a dramatic moment.

[12:55] And when you think about this movie, the whole thing, right, the whole drama of Jaws, the

[13:01] moment that you'll never forget is when the shark appears.

[13:05] And so that's what people love about Jaws.

[13:09] And then in the mechanical form and in the toys of this game, that does not create a

[13:14] wow moment.

[13:15] And to me, that might be one of the biggest misses and disconnects this entire game suffers

[13:20] from because you kind of wanted it to be the moment, right?

[13:24] You want the moment when you see Jaws for the first time and he pops out and you want

[13:28] it every time he pops out to be a dramatic wow moment in pinball.

[13:32] And it's just not there.

[13:34] I think the biggest wow thing happening in this game, the unique lights being used to

[13:38] simulate blood in the water.

[13:40] I think that's the most wow thing happening in the game.

[13:44] Bashing the boat up the middle is not a wow shot.

[13:47] Hitting the chum bucket is not a wow shot.

[13:49] The fin going back and forth is not really a wow shot.

[13:53] It doesn't have any of like Elwyn's like crazy loops going on in his other games.

[13:58] It doesn't have dramatic wire forms happening in this game like Avengers or like Godzilla

[14:03] or Jurassic Park.

[14:04] And that's my thing is like as exciting as it is to see all the assets in Jaws.

[14:10] My fear is the gameplay is pretty pedestrian and because there's no magical wow moments

[14:17] happening in the gameplay of the game itself, where does this game now fall?

[14:22] And I think the other part is this like following up Godzilla with Jaws.

[14:26] It's really difficult, right?

[14:28] Because we're so used to seeing how amazing Godzilla is.

[14:32] Godzilla is filled with wow moments both on a software front and on a mechanical front.

[14:38] And I don't think Jaws delivers the same.

[14:41] I think it delivers the assets and creates wow there.

[14:45] But I just don't feel the wow happening on the actual physical play field.

[14:49] Obviously we need to play the game.

[14:51] We need to play the game in a dark room.

[14:53] We need to get a sense of what the atmosphere is like when you play Jaws.

[14:57] But from the video last night and what we've seen to date,

[15:01] it's just not giving me goosebumps the way some other stern machines have when we've

[15:06] seen them played for the first time.

[15:08] Let me read some of the commentary from Pinside and this is what other people felt about the stream.

[15:13] This is from Foo Fighter on Pinside.

[15:16] He said, watch the video for the third time.

[15:18] A lot going on the first times around and takes a couple of views to digest.

[15:23] Really love the gameplay and the build up to catch the bounties.

[15:26] Save the beachgoers, quint challenges, harpoon multipliers, so much to do.

[15:32] Keith makes it look easy, but I guarantee this is going to be a tough shooter as the pacing

[15:37] and hurry ups can force you to miss shots.

[15:40] Really like the quick 180 ramp to put the ball safely on your left flipper when you're trying

[15:45] to hit the fishing reel.

[15:47] That return is wicked fast.

[15:48] I'm definitely getting walking dead vibes with the modes and drop targets which is a great thing.

[15:54] The game is going to look amazing with the lights off and not a streaming light rig hovering

[15:59] over it.

[16:00] The assets and music are really well done, pulls you right into the world.

[16:04] Born in 72 and this movie has scared the crap out of me since I first saw it when I was

[16:08] 6 or 7 and has been in my repeated viewings hundreds of times over the years.

[16:13] So iconic, can't wait, premium on order.

[16:17] So look, I agree with a lot of what Foo Fighter is saying here.

[16:20] Let's go to another comment.

[16:22] This is from Chico Man.

[16:23] He says, if that stream did anything it removes all sales of LEs by flippers and distros who

[16:29] were going to sell it sideways into the secondary market for $15,000 plus.

[16:34] I think it's a nice looking game, but you already have people pulling their orders for

[16:38] Jaws LE.

[16:39] FOMO is officially dead.

[16:41] It's an average L-WIN pin at best.

[16:43] Well, we'll see what happens there.

[16:45] But after seeing this stream I did feel like this isn't going to be like this impossible

[16:51] to get pin or bolt it to the floor pin.

[16:54] If you own a Godzilla, if you own an Iron Maiden, if you own a Jurassic Park, I think

[17:00] you're going to be good.

[17:01] I think you're going to dabble at Jaws and unless Jaws is a dream theme for you, I don't

[17:05] feel like you're going to be like, oh, I got to get rid of this and replace it with the

[17:09] new L-WIN because it seems like it's the best L-WIN.

[17:12] GCS 2000 said, for me it's missing that wow moments.

[17:16] Godzilla has tons of them, so does Jurassic Park and many other games.

[17:21] This unfortunately is missing that for me.

[17:24] I am not saying it's a bad game at all.

[17:26] I will happily play the heck out of it on location and hope I grow to love it.

[17:31] And Poblito 350 followed up and said, this is how I feel about it too.

[17:36] We're not buyers for new pins.

[17:38] They're just not worth it to us.

[17:40] That is until Godzilla came along.

[17:42] That's the first pin that really wowed us and still does.

[17:45] From what little we saw, Jaws looks great, but nothing that rocked my boat.

[17:50] Just okay, I guess.

[17:52] When Jaws sprang up from the playfield, it wasn't exciting at all.

[17:56] The music was flat and just uneventful.

[17:59] Starting Godzilla Multiball has the red GI, blue oyster cult blasting, the clip of Godzilla

[18:05] tearing down the pagoda.

[18:07] It's exhilarating.

[18:09] That's a moment in the game that's awesome.

[18:12] Maybe in future code updates, it may be jazzed up a bit, but who knows?

[18:17] I love the red lighting effect under the playfield and how you can trap the ball with the upper

[18:21] flipper.

[18:22] I can't wait to play it on location, but I can't see us saving up to actually buy this.

[18:27] And again, what I love about opinions around pinball, it's so divided.

[18:30] Like pinchamp wrote from Calgary, Alberta, I love my Godzilla, but have to play it for

[18:36] 30 plus minutes to really progress.

[18:38] And to have a satisfying game, it's like 45 minutes.

[18:41] I'm so glad this feels nothing like Godzilla.

[18:44] I'd play Jurassic Park more and can have great progression in 15 to 20 minutes max.

[18:50] Someone said on Jaws, it feels like there are things happening all over at once and

[18:54] they would prefer a sequence.

[18:56] I am opposite of that.

[18:57] And the game progression feels a lot more in control of the player, which I love.

[19:01] Here's another one from Creelay 1 from Elizabeth Town, Kentucky.

[19:05] As a massive Jaws fan, I am disappointed.

[19:09] Wish it was more linear.

[19:10] Progress all over the place from different films and scenes.

[19:14] Music cues do not align with clips, modes, and the rescue thing was not even a theme

[19:18] from the films.

[19:20] Just feels disjointed and out of place.

[19:23] They really went for a game with lots of different things to do at once, but that style really

[19:28] doesn't match the theme source material.

[19:30] Non-Jaws movie folks will enjoy it because they don't care, but I would rather progress

[19:35] through the films, not bounce back and forth all over the place.

[19:39] APG from California with 14 upvotes and no downvotes writes the following.

[19:45] After watching the stream, I've decided to back out of my LE order.

[19:49] Looks like a fun game, but something about it is not sitting well with me at this price

[19:54] point.

[19:55] It just seems to be missing the extra features a pin at this price point, including the premium

[20:00] price point that should be there.

[20:02] The lack of mechs and magnets, etc.

[20:05] That could have made this theme really awesome, seemed to be left out to save on the cost

[20:10] to build it.

[20:11] I don't even care that the shark doesn't eat the ball, but the upper playfield looks

[20:14] like a waste of space.

[20:16] The shark popping up for a second to get hit is just okay.

[20:20] A spinning fishing reel.

[20:22] I'm not trying to crap on it, I swear.

[20:26] It does look fun, but man, if this doesn't feel like a pro model at LE prices, kind of

[20:31] a bummer.

[20:32] I hope you all enjoy this one, but if anything, I'll get a premium after playing or just

[20:36] wait for the LEs to come down in price.

[20:39] A real quick comment from Paul8788, I get having a pre-recorded gameplay video to get

[20:44] it out there so people can see.

[20:47] Weird decision to livestream the pre-recorded video though, would have preferred if they

[20:51] just released it as a standard YouTube video, made the time to watch it live, but there

[20:56] really was no point.

[20:57] Alright, so as you can see, as you can see, a bit of a divided camp on Jaws.

[21:02] Pinball, which is to be expected.

[21:04] With every new game released, here's what happens.

[21:06] Anybody who's ordered this game to date is going to see the good in Jaws.

[21:11] Anyone who doesn't want to buy it is going to see the bad in Jaws.

[21:14] I think most of us are pretty moderate, we're not that extreme.

[21:17] I do think most people would agree.

[21:19] The game is loaded with assets, it doesn't have anything mechanically wow in the game,

[21:25] it doesn't feel like a $13,000 game when you look at what's in the physical parts of Jaws

[21:30] Pinball.

[21:31] Keith Elwin has made some of the best machines in Pinball.

[21:34] It doesn't feel like this is going to end up being Keith Elwin's greatest game.

[21:38] I think we all agree that Keith Elwin is a great designer, he's not a good salesman.

[21:43] I think this game is going to come out, I think it's going to do just fine, but I don't

[21:47] think it's going to light the Pinball world on fire the way some people were thinking it

[21:51] would.

[21:52] And I think some of that has to do with the theme itself.

[21:54] You know, Jaws is a slow movie.

[21:56] It's not an exciting thing like Godzilla tearing down buildings and firing like gamma ray beams

[22:03] from his mouth.

[22:04] Godzilla is so fun and energetic and campy and Jaws is not that.

[22:10] But what's interesting about both of them is they're both kind of monster movies and

[22:14] they're both about that energy and excitement when the monster appears.

[22:18] And I think Godzilla does a much better job of creating dramatic moments from what we've

[22:23] seen so far, a much better job of creating those dramatic moments when Godzilla is approaching

[22:29] the city than this game does when you find a shark.

[22:33] It just doesn't have that same level that gives you goosebumps.

[22:36] Alright, so we shall see what happens with Jaws.

[22:39] More to come on this game.

[22:40] It's going to be at CES all week.

[22:42] We're going to get more live gameplay impressions from people who play it.

[22:46] It's going to be fun what happens now when people who are not good at Pinball play Jaws.

[22:51] Then we will get the real reviews from normal human beings, not gods like Keith Elwin.

[22:57] Alright everybody, the time has come for me to give to you some exclusive information

[23:03] the world has never heard around a pinball machine that is coming out.

[23:06] Now look, this is not a rumor.

[23:08] I can't reiterate that enough.

[23:10] This is not a rumor.

[23:11] This is 100% happening.

[23:14] I have seen this game with my own eyes.

[23:16] I might even have a picture or two of this game on my phone.

[23:20] I am under what they would call an NDA.

[23:22] It was more of like a word of mouth NDA.

[23:24] I didn't sign a piece of paper, but I'm not going to break my word on this.

[23:28] Now what I can tell you is this.

[23:29] I've been alluding to this game as being what I think will be one of the most beautiful

[23:32] games to look at in 2024.

[23:35] And I still think that's going to be the case.

[23:37] So it's going to be gorgeous.

[23:39] The other thing about this game that's going to be interesting is they're only going to

[23:42] make, I think they're only making 500 of these games and that is it.

[23:48] These games are being made for the collectors that are out there.

[23:52] So if you're tired of a thousand LEs and unlimited premiums and all these people on

[23:57] planet earth are having the experience, like thousands of people have the same game you

[24:01] do.

[24:02] The only thing you got that's different is the armor and the translate.

[24:05] This is not going to be one of those games.

[24:07] And I think for the pinball collector community that's out there, when you want to have something

[24:12] different, you want to have something that not everybody has, there really isn't much

[24:17] out there that's very limited.

[24:18] Like right now, the new spooky games are sort of limited, only 888 of each model.

[24:24] There's only 750 Rick and Mortys in the world, which is nuts.

[24:28] But when it comes to stern games, like yeah, like nothing's really collectible anymore.

[24:32] It feels like everybody owns everything.

[24:34] It feels like everybody's got every single game and maybe that's fine for some of you.

[24:38] But the truth is there are pinball collectors who want something that not everybody has.

[24:44] And nobody's really targeting those people, so I think this game is aimed to target those

[24:49] people.

[24:50] So what is the game, Chris?

[24:51] You're like, shut up, what is the game?

[24:53] I can't tell you the theme of the game, but I can tell you who created the game.

[24:57] And that's going to be the thing that shocks each and every one of you when I tell you

[25:01] this.

[25:02] I'll tell you first and foremost the timing of when this game is supposed to come out.

[25:06] We are looking at April May.

[25:08] April May as when this game will be released.

[25:11] There will only be 500.

[25:13] And here's the shocking part.

[25:15] This game is going to be a game that was designed by no other than John Papadook Jr.

[25:22] You heard it here first.

[25:23] A J-pop game is actually going to be made and made in a way where it works right, made

[25:30] in a way where it's coded, made in a way where all the shots go to stuff, made in a way where

[25:34] the magnets turn on.

[25:36] You're going to get a J-pop designed game made by a company that knows how to make games.

[25:42] It's going to be coming out with just 500 units sometime in April or May.

[25:47] The other hint I will tell you is this, that this is not a Bali Williams J-pop game.

[25:53] But I think this is the most beautiful game J-pop has ever designed.

[25:57] But here's the great part about this.

[25:59] He's not behind this now.

[26:00] Like he's not over there.

[26:02] I don't think he's over there with the company like working on this at all.

[26:06] I think they acquired it all from J-pop, but they're going to take it to a real level now.

[26:11] And right now you're sort of racking through all the different titles J-pop has worked

[26:14] on.

[26:15] Maybe it's J-pop's version of Houdini, which is absolutely beautiful.

[26:19] And I'm just going to tell you this right now.

[26:21] I've got one on order.

[26:22] From a work of art standpoint, it's just going to be one of those games you're going

[26:25] to drool over when you stand over this game.

[26:29] So that's where we're at.

[26:30] Just to throw another game into the mix, right?

[26:33] As if 2024 does not have enough companies and enough games and enough things to try to

[26:38] save up to buy, we're getting more.

[26:41] And that is my big concern about 2024.

[26:44] There's just so much.

[26:45] We all know there's too much and prices are so high.

[26:49] And I don't know what this game is going to be priced at, but it's not going to be cheap.

[26:52] And you know, so now I think everything we buy has to matter.

[26:56] Like it has to matter to us.

[26:58] And I just want to say to all those people out there that say we're not allowed to talk

[27:02] about resale value.

[27:03] Come on.

[27:04] Of course we're allowed to talk about resale value.

[27:06] At these prices, we have to think about resale value.

[27:10] You know, I saw a rumor, maybe this is true, that Jersey Jack is making distributors who

[27:14] ordered Elton John Collector's Edition.

[27:17] They're making them buy like five platinum editions for every Collector's Edition they

[27:20] get.

[27:21] I mean, Stern does the same thing.

[27:23] It's just not going to be very sustainable people.

[27:25] I mean, Jaws hype is the highest it's ever going to be right now.

[27:29] What happens like three, four months from now, when Stern's trying to unload their next

[27:33] LE to all these distros, a thousand of them and think about it for every thousand LE's,

[27:38] they're trying to unload like 4,000 premiums on all of these distros.

[27:43] I just don't see this ending well.

[27:45] I really don't.

[27:46] I think there's a lot to be excited about in pinball.

[27:49] I think it's going to get crazy over saturated in 2024.

[27:53] And at these prices, I don't know if all of you are getting 40% raises at work, but when

[27:58] I go around the world now, inflation is everywhere.

[28:02] Brenda and I have had a lot of conversations about this.

[28:04] We are stopping our spending on stuff we don't need.

[28:07] We're going to stop going out as much.

[28:09] It's just too expensive.

[28:11] And we're actually a lot happier when we have less, when we spend less money, when we buy

[28:16] less stuff we don't need, we wake up in a better mood.

[28:20] And it's crazy to me that pinball is off in the corner trying to sell thousands of games

[28:25] a year.

[28:26] And at these prices, I just wish all these companies good luck because I'm not sure it's

[28:32] sustainable at these prices.

[28:35] That being said, now you've got a new mystery game to talk about.

[28:38] And when you take it to the pin side, make sure you give me credit.

[28:41] Canada said it.

[28:42] Canada said it.

[28:43] This is 100% confirmed.

[28:44] A J-pop game is coming out in working form sometime in April and May.

[28:50] And it is not being made by J-pop or Deeproot or Zidware.

[28:53] It is being made by a company that knows how to make games.

[28:56] And it's happening, people.

[28:57] Canada out.
