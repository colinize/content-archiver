[00:00] I went to the hang of dawn

[00:05] I went to the hang of dawn

[00:12] I was so nervous

[00:14] I was so nervous

[00:18] Welcome to episode 224 of Canada's Pinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada. Thanks for joining me this Wednesday morning to talk about Pinball. Now I have to say

[00:29] I got a ton of responses from you guys out there. Thank you so much. When I asked the question, what would be your top three?

[00:39] Buy it now, site unseen, pinball themes that you would love to see manufactured. And I'm going to just open up that email chain I have

[00:48] I haven't read it yet because I want to be surprised and give you my real time feedback on what your suggestions are for the pinball machines that you really want.

[01:01] So we're going to do that. That's going to take up the majority of the show. Now we're also going hopefully going to get Zombielli on the show real soon.

[01:10] Because I know you guys have been talking all about the Iron Maiden artwork and what's going to be on the Ellie and what's going to be on the premium. And I think it kind of might make sense to have him come on when those images are revealed.

[01:23] Because I want to talk to him about creating those packages. And I think without them out there, he won't be able to say too much because he's still waiting for approval on him.

[01:33] But I have to say, man, you guys who are getting an Iron Maiden Ellie, I know you feel really special right now because it is unobtainium. They are sold out everywhere everywhere. You can't get one.

[01:45] I'm really curious to see when the first ones go up and to see how much over MSRP they're going to go for because this thing is not going to go for $9,000. I can tell you that right now.

[01:56] Now, before I read your top three themes that you would love to see in Pimball, I have to sort of just cover this. This is probably the most ridiculous item.

[02:08] I thought it was an April Fool's joke when someone sent it to me, but it's actually real. On April 1st, 2018, the Sydney Morning Herald wrote a story about a British businessman who came to the show.

[02:25] Who came to Australia recently to resurrect this hydrofoil boat that he remembers fondly as a child. Now, you normally would not care about a story like this.

[02:38] But the reason why you probably do care about a story like this is that British businessman who is now in Australia trying to resurrect some hydrofoil boat goes by the name of Andrew Highway.

[02:51] Now, there are two parts of this story that are really interesting because I don't want to read the whole thing. But there's two paragraphs that should peak everybody's attention in the Pimball world.

[03:03] And I want to read for you what those two lines are.

[03:08] Okay, all right. So here we go because this one, the first one is a doozy. All right. So this paragraph says now 30 years since he left Sydney, the British businessman who sold his successful company Highway Pimball last year is embarking on a new enterprise to bring the last remaining Sydney hydrofoil around the world on its foils back to Sydney Harbor.

[03:36] All right, let's stop there for a minute. He sold his successful Pimball company Highway Pimball.

[03:43] I mean, what the hell when I read that I think when everybody read that it was like, are you kidding me a successful Pimball company?

[04:01] And then he found it ironic that he created a Pimball company that turned into a sinking ship and he then is now going to buy a ship and try to keep it afloat.

[04:12] I can't. The irony is too much. But that's not the only thing that's in this story that should really raise some eyebrows.

[04:19] This is the line that really, really, really kind of should have people concerned about where their money went when they gave Andrew money for alien Pimball. So in this paragraph, it says he swiftly track down the shipyard called them offered to buy it.

[04:35] And by March 2016 after paying an undisclosed sum became the owner of the last remaining sea worthy Sydney hydrofoil.

[04:47] All right, let's talk about that for a minute and then timing and why that's important. In March of 2016, when Andrew Highway was buying this hydrofoil for an undisclosed amount of money, he was supposed to be building your alien Pimball machines.

[05:02] By that point, he was, you know, alien was now shipping 2016 and what happened the game never shipped you didn't get your game in 2016 and Highway Pimball was on the brink of collapse.

[05:14] So how did a man who had no money to buy the parts people needed to make the games he promised people how did a man who was in financial ruin on the Pimball side?

[05:26] How did he afford to buy this large hydrofoil ship? So that's the question that is on my mind and it should be on your mind.

[05:36] And I think it just goes to show that these charlatan businessmen will always find a new environment in which to hoodwing people, in which to mislead people, in which to be dishonest.

[05:49] And I'm not saying that, you know, he definitely took your money from Highway Pimball and bought this hydrofoil. But man, it looks pretty damn suspicious that this guy just sets up a business and it goes into the ground and then he takes money and buys something else.

[06:07] I mean, does this sound like an individual who knows how to manage companies and it reminds me of when Kim Mitchell found that information about how all of Andrew Highway's previous companies collapsed or declared bankruptcy or were declared and solvent.

[06:25] And you guys all yelled at Kim Mitchell being like, well, that's normal, that's natural. Really, really. So when you read this story and someone who doesn't know about Pimball

[06:35] would think that this guy is a successful businessman and you look at the photos of Andrew Highway in this in this news story. He's got his arms folded, he's all confident, he's all cocky.

[06:47] He sold a successful Pimball company. I can't even. It kind of makes me mad. It kind of makes me mad that people who keep failing are allowed another chance and another chance and another chance.

[07:00] Meanwhile, there's really hard working people out there, hard working people that are working their asses off to deliver what they promise and they're not quitting until they get you what they promised.

[07:13] And meanwhile, this guy sells the company back to the investors in a complete disaster estate and now he's all cocky and australia with his arms folded. Look at me, look how great I am. I'm going to do this next.

[07:26] It's just incredible. It's just incredible. And I guess the ultimate learning for all of us out there is buyer beware. Make sure you invest your money in businessmen who know what they're doing.

[07:39] And I think Pimball has had its sort of mixture of complete buffoons like J-pop and Andrew and Barry and Yop and then it's had real businessmen like Gary Stern, like Chuck, like who know how to run a business.

[07:56] So that's the ridiculous item of the day. Let's change gears to a more fun topic and let's talk about your picks for top three Pimball machines that you would buy site unseen if you heard it was being made.

[08:14] And that was the filter. It was real simple. It's like what game would you buy if someone said it's being made and we might have some overlap here. I'm just going to start opening up the emails that I got from the from March 31st on. All right.

[08:29] So three franchises. So I from Jared job. Jared. Thank you for writing and Jared said his top three are the wizard Fred Savage Christian Slater, the Sandlot and honey I shrunk the kids. All right. Jared. Thank you for those three. I think if they made those three, I think you would probably be the only one in on the Ellie site unseen.

[08:57] Again, I'm going to I'm going to judge all of these as to whether or not I think they would sell out site unseen and let's let's just say for hypothetical sake that all of these are going to have a limited run of 500 machines. Okay. Would they sell out the wizard, the Sandlot and honey I shrunk the kids. I don't think they would sell out at all. All right. I got an email from all castle games. He said, Hey, Chris. Here's my top three weird.

[09:25] Weird Al music pin. Goonies and army of darkness. All right. Army of darkness. Goonies and weird out. All right. So thank you for that email. I again, Army of darkness. We've heard that one a lot. We've heard that rumored as a spooky title happening sometime in the future. I still think out of those three weird Al music pin. Are you really really?

[09:51] I mean, look weird. All is is can be in funny. But again, I would ask these are the these are the titles that you would you just you and your money would part ways with without seeing it. And again, maybe my criticisms of people's picks needs to have a caveat that this is what means the most to you. So that you're letting me in on a little bit of your quirky sides of your personalities. People and I appreciate that. But I think out of those three only goonies would sell out site unseen. I got an email from Chris.

[10:19] Pestone. Chris. Thank you for writing in. He said, love the podcast. Here's my list of top three. Pimbal. I think would be big sellers. Number one, Willie Wonka. Everybody knows Willie Wonka and loves the movie. I think you could make an amazing machine with the characters from the movie. The slot machine is a huge hit. All right. Let me stop there because Willie Wonka will be made. Willie Wonka is going to be Jersey Jack's machine after toy story. If Guns and Rose is doesn't sneak in there somewhere, right?

[10:48] So I do think that Jack will sell out site unseen of the Willie Wonka collectors editions, especially if Jack only makes like 200 collectors editions of that machine. So I agree with you there. He goes on to number two, the Blues Brothers.

[11:03] Another huge movie that everyone has seen probably multiple times. If you put clips from the movie in the game, it would be huge, great soundtrack. Blues Brothers is an interesting one. I think that is a theme that a lot of people love.

[11:14] It's Dan Acroid and Jim Belushi. I've seen that movie a lot. Part of me is just like, I just don't think the Blues Brothers would sell out 500 site unseen.

[11:31] I just don't think that movie has as much of a fanbase and a pole as some of the other movies in the 80s. He then goes on to say, Jaws, unless they really screwed up, how could this not be a sellout? I completely agree, Chris. I think Jaws is an absolute home run. All right. I got Hector. Thank you so much. Hector Villalobos.

[11:57] Hector and Adrian, so they wrote in, hey, Chris, love your show. Keep up the good work. Here's our list of 80s. Take my money now. Site unseen games. All right. He's got a long list here. Hector and Adrian, so maybe they both put in. I asked for three, but he broke him down by category, which is interesting. So let me read the music. Michael Jackson, Bon Jovi, and Pink Floyd. All right. Wow. Waco Jacko. As popular as Michael Jackson is, and the music is amazing.

[12:26] Would Michael Jackson sell out site unseen? Now, here's the real interesting variable with Michael is his fanbase is ginormous and people who collect his stuff are in the millions. So if, but do do those people do they would they buy a pinball machine? And we saw this with Star Wars. Like there's so many Star Wars collectors. Of course, they're all going to buy the Star Wars pinball and that didn't actually pan out.

[12:52] So Michael Jackson, Bon Jovi, and Pink Floyd, would those sell out site unseen? I definitely I look, I think Bon Jovi is another one. They're kind of like Erasmus. I do love Bon Jovi music, but it is kind of corny. It is kind of corny. I mean, the guy was an alley make deal for for Christ sake. And Pink Floyd, I definitely huge following. I think with the music pins site unseen is the interesting part because I don't think iron made in sells out site unseen. I think it sold out like.

[13:22] Once people actually saw how amazing the Keith L. Wynn, a zombie Yeti package was. So 500 I don't I don't know I don't know if any of those sell out. So then TV shows he writes he man the masters of the universe.

[13:35] Mash a bit older, but still in the 80s and a good Ninja Turtle game. Alright. So out of those three and these are my these first of all I appreciate all your guys opinions like this is not right or wrong. I think he man masters the universe.

[13:50] If based on the old 80s cartoon would sell out site unseen that's just I'm pretty confident in that. I also think Ninja Turtles. We've had Ninja Turtle games before.

[14:02] So and Ninja Turtles has just has constantly been around in culture. So I think it's a little bit of an exhausted franchise and and and yeah I just I just do and mash popular show.

[14:14] But I could I just don't see people site unseen being that in the mash to buy 500 Ellie pinball machines. I don't so then for movies he writes back to the future Halloween child's play polter guys lab rent.

[14:31] Look that's more than three I'm going to give you that I think back the future is the only one on that list that is site unseen selling out and then pop culture he wrote cuba Zelda skate or die so the 720 again like I just don't think I think Zelda and a super Mario brothers pinball machine would sell out site unseen I think sometimes people forget the power of the Nintendo properties and how many fans

[15:00] they have and I think a new super marios can you can you imagine a super marios were like the you get the the sewage pipe you get the green pipe and there's a magnet on top and it grabs the ball and makes it sound like

[15:14] like it would be amazing it would be absolutely amazing a new super Mario brothers pinball machine incredible imagine like a vertical up kick in which it hits the brick that collects coins and just keeps doing it and then it sends them all out.

[15:29] Anyway I think super Mario brothers in Zelda but thank you Hector for those themes okay so Ben Crane wrote in Chris enjoyed the show is always this time my wife was listening to and she thought this was the best of the pinball podcast that she has ever heard thought I'd weigh in on some themes I'd love to see all right well thank you and I'm glad you're you're you're wife also enjoyed the podcast so he wrote back to the futures

[15:58] goonies and jaws would be huge sellers as you mention I love to see a star trek vault edition with an LCD screen based on the 1960s television series with William Shatner and Leonard Neymor alright first of all that's that's a theme and I think star trek the original

[16:19] start trek with with Spock and Captain Kirk with an LCD that was like throwback nostalgia game sold out site unseen you I wouldn't re-skin this deep-ritchy game I would make it all new and original but I think you're right he then wrote predator would be great if someone actually got the license and actually made it a modern pin based on Jurassic Park Jurassic World would be a huge hit pulp fiction would be great also Guardians of the Galaxy was a dream theme for us we

[16:48] bought the Ellie with the new code and it has potential to be a great game as well all right so here's a thing Ben you said a lot here I want to say this predator let's talk about that theme I do think that the Arnold Schwarzenegger hits like predator and total recall I think we might be getting into a little bit of like early 90s with some of these things I do think there's a huge fan base for some of these games like I would love a predator machine and I think look Kevin he sold what

[17:18] 250 of them pretty much immediately I think of a modern manufacturer said we're going to be making predator the right way I do think the LEDs would sell out site unseen I do I think it's like the I think guys love that theme I think start track as well

[17:36] Jurassic Park Jurassic World I think there's there's nuances there I think of Jurassic Park the original movie with you know the clever girls and all the lines we love and remember if that got a modern take the original film is still the classic I think that sells outside unseen if it's Jurassic world like based on the new movies I don't think there's as much sort of appeal as the original

[18:03] now if you made a game that had all the films in it but you wouldn't want that because there was so many shitty Jurassic Park movies I came out in the middle

[18:12] so I think the original throwback would be the way to go all right okay so he said he has don't read this on the air so I would not so I'm not going to do that so thank you Ben for those suggestions and then

[18:25] Pulp Fiction was his last one and I think Pulp Fiction to me is going to be like a really interesting pinball machine because I'm just not quite sure I want a Pulp Fiction pinball machine I love the movie like I love all the

[18:40] Tarrantinos movies I it's just such a weird kind of movie to make into a pinball machine it's just I just weird to see how you would progress through that like which character would you play

[18:54] how would it work you know with the movie like the big Lebowski like you can be the dude and then you can you know you can absorb the the role of being the dude and play through the movie as the dude

[19:04] but who would you play through the movie as you know you've got all these different characters on different storylines that ultimately converge in the end of Pulp Fiction which is amazing

[19:15] but I'm not quite sure like how you turn that into a pinball experience really curious but what it sell out site unseen

[19:24] Pulp Fiction I don't think so I don't think so all right so then I got an email from someone who said all right Chris so real quick this is my order number one this is from Moses

[19:37] Over Street Moses thank you for listening to the show he said number one escape from New York number two Mad Max road warrior based on the original two movies and number three

[19:47] Smokey in the bandit those have tons and tons of potential and also had an idea if you're interested about an interview

[19:56] podcast with another person to the hobby I got into this pinball thing just a few months ago after you did from the arcade scene and also

[20:03] Okay, so yes we can we can definitely talk on the show my man let's see escape from New York

[20:09] Okay again sell out site unseen would escape from New York do that no I don't think so Mad Max

[20:15] much higher potential to sell out site unseen I do

[20:21] I'm just like I'm just a little bit like those Mad Max is that 80s are like late 70s it's those movies are like they're really old and gritty you know they they've aged okay

[20:34] I'm not sure again

[20:36] This is all like if they said if Stern said we're making Mad Max limited edition it sells out without even saying it

[20:42] I don't think so and I think the same is true for smoking the bandit

[20:45] I think these are popular things for sure I just don't think they have the large enough

[20:53] Sort of following an emotional like appeal to sell out all 500 now most I know if they announced them

[21:01] You you would be in on it and that's the whole thing is you guys would all be in on all these so

[21:08] I

[21:10] You're not wrong. You're not wrong. It's just this is just from this is like almost like a marketing exercise all right

[21:15] So here is a list from Mario Mario Neocleus

[21:21] I'm sorry guys if I butcher your names is not my fault. He's Mario from he's from Cyprus

[21:25] All right all the way over in like the Mediterranean

[21:28] Mario thank you for listening to the show marios

[21:31] So Mario he says John Wayne's War of the Worlds

[21:36] Number two Rocky and number three James Bond and he said a few more good measures the matrix the godfather

[21:44] Total recall in highlander all right Mario. Thank you for these

[21:48] So John oh sorry John Wayne's

[21:51] Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds excuse me I've been like it was like was John Wayne in War of the Worlds

[21:58] War of the Worlds is that in 80s movies that the old one is like the orson wells. I'm not sure

[22:06] I don't I think War of the Worlds is a really cool theme. I think it could be really amazing

[22:10] I just don't think that sells outside unseen

[22:13] Rockies interesting because

[22:15] um, I do think Rocky is huge and I do think Rocky would sell outside unseen

[22:22] I do I think that's just a jug or not

[22:24] If there's only five minute Rockies and then James Bond

[22:27] Um James Bond always comes up time and time again as being you know this really sought after theme for pinball

[22:35] And I have to like say that I don't know how you do James Bond with so many James Bond movies out there

[22:42] And I you know do you do the original the Sean Conneries do you

[22:47] uh, you know there's like so many James bonds out there Daniel Craig you do the you know the I don't know the Roger Moore's like

[22:55] How do you do James Bond and there's just too many films um, so I think James Bond to me

[23:04] Unless it was based on like one or two of like the most famous James Bond films

[23:09] I don't think James Bond sells outside unseen um, the matrix is one that is from the 90s

[23:17] But I do think the matrix would sell outside unseen. I just think the matrix is also

[23:21] To me the matrix what makes it like so awesome is not just the storyline not just the film the visual identity of that film

[23:28] But the music in it and I think it's one of these perfect pinball's narratives

[23:34] Like you're neo and you have to like you know

[23:36] Get into the matrix and like just you know destroyed like the sentinels and then all that stuff and save Zion like it's it's got

[23:44] The kind of narrative that makes pinball exciting and the music to go with it

[23:49] It's kind of like the way daft punk made trance so awesome the music and the matrix is so freaking cool

[23:55] And imagine like the stop motion like the ball does like you can do stop motion things with the ball

[23:59] And you're like neo if to freeze them you know when he like freezes the bullets and they all drop

[24:04] How cool would that be if like neo there's a part in the pinball machine

[24:09] Where neo freezes all the balls and they all stay over like mags and then just drop down kind of like

[24:15] A few like four or five disappearing magnets like in totten. Yeah

[24:20] godfather

[24:22] site unseen

[24:24] I don't think so total recall I also you know what total recall

[24:30] Maybe in highlander. I don't think so the very awesome movies, but just the appeal is a little bit smaller

[24:37] Then I think people think

[24:40] Godfather obviously very popular

[24:42] But again is it just godfather one and two or is it three and we you know, I don't know

[24:46] I don't know mafia movies are the best for pinball

[24:50] All right, let's see

[24:52] Dan donald dan hey dude this was simple number one the beetle juice

[24:57] By spooky pinball who framed Roger rabbit by jersey jack pinball and spinal tap by stern

[25:05] Number four peewee's big adventure american pinball

[25:08] I love that he associated who he would like to make each of these machines so

[25:13] Beetle juice

[25:15] I don't want to talk about the weather or not. I think each of these companies would do it justice

[25:19] I do think beetle juice pinball would sell outside unseen. I just I do I also think like

[25:26] You know Edward Cesar hands would as well like I would buy an Edward Cesar hands pinball machine without even

[25:31] Hearing you finish the word Cesar hands like that music and the timburt in world in Edward Cesar hands

[25:39] Is the most amazing

[25:42] In that movie is magic on a whole nother level

[25:46] Edward Cesar hands like can you imagine

[25:49] Just like the ice dance music going and like you could actually make the pinball is like

[25:54] Just dance around and like do like like like they're carving the the the the the the the the the the the the ice sculpture

[26:02] I mean it just be amazing you have to like hit the shots the car of the ice sculpture as it's snowing the music's playing anyway

[26:08] Who frame Roger rabbit from jjp

[26:12] Who frame Roger rabbit limited edition is now available does it sell out? Do you say oh my god? I need this movie

[26:18] um, I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think it's that spinal tap stern

[26:23] Spinal tap would it sell out site unseen. It's a comedy. It's a funny movie

[26:28] um

[26:29] Like again like I just I don't I think the again. I'm always saying it's like big trouble low China too. I don't think they sell out

[26:36] I think they'd be popular

[26:38] But I do think these are a little bit more niche than the mainstream stuff

[26:43] And again, I'm just going off of like do these themes have enough power the way um

[26:49] Batman ghost busters

[26:51] You know

[26:52] Do they have the same kind of power of that of iron made in Ellie and it was hard

[26:58] It this is a really hard exercise because we again

[27:00] I don't think iron made in cells out the way it did if it wasn't Keith L. Wins game

[27:05] I do I think seeing it made people go in

[27:08] Peewee's big adventure. I use another one for me. I mean that movie is just so classic again Tim burden

[27:14] Why why Tim burden hasn't had

[27:17] Pinball machines is beyond me. I know someone's making a nightmare before Christmas homebrew game

[27:22] But I think the whole Tim burden series are are are magical

[27:27] aesthetically incredible and would be site unseen sellouts

[27:32] All right, he also said 90s games. He has total recall Wayne's world and Dick Tracy

[27:37] Um, I think out of all those I would read I would have re-skinned when I saw Kingpin

[27:41] I was like they should have re-skinned this dick Tracy the artworks similar

[27:45] And I think it would they should have got the license and made it Dick Tracy pinball

[27:49] And I think it would have been bonkers

[27:51] And at least be different than re-making Kingpin all right. There's a lot more to go here guys. Are you on for the ride?

[27:58] Someone sent me an email about highway pinball floats again

[28:03] So uh, let's see so themes I got an email from

[28:08] Jay his emails blade something Jay said Chris I say 18 pinball machine

[28:15] TV show not the bad movie incorporate the van as the cabinet plus there's a lot of

[28:22] Mode possibilities to be had

[28:24] break Murdoch out of the mental hospital assemble the team escape the authorities beat the bad guys all right

[28:31] Okay, so I just want to the topper could be the van spoiler with a red stripe

[28:35] I think the classic 18 movie as a pinball machine with the Ellie being again

[28:43] We're supposed to be sighted and seen but the Ellie could be made to look like the van

[28:47] I think you're easily gonna see that sold out easily and I do I that show

[28:53] It's like Magnum P.I. It's like so fucking good. Sorry to curse all right

[28:58] So I got an email from edc the top three in no particular order Motley crew smoking the bandit

[29:05] Friday the 13th or Halloween

[29:08] um

[29:09] Look the crew another one of these like great bands great songs kickstart my heart, you know

[29:14] Same old situation home sweet home. I love Motley crew. I love driving Motley crew in my car

[29:20] I think Motley crews

[29:22] Energy and their music is perfect for pinball does Motley crew pinball sell out sight unseen

[29:30] 500 crew fans out there

[29:34] Uh, I think so I think it would I think there's enough crew fans out there that it would do it and and Motley crew to me is

[29:40] They're like they're like cooler than bond jovy. They're not corny like they are

[29:46] They are really like, you know

[29:49] Awesome band from the 80s and the only thing with Molly and they like the good artwork from the 80s

[29:52] I think the machine can look gorgeous. All right, so smoking the bandit. We've heard this before again

[29:57] I don't think it sells out. I think it would be popular Friday the 13th or Halloween

[30:02] Um, you know what sight unseen sold out. I don't think so. I don't again

[30:08] I think these horror movies are I think they're fun

[30:11] I just don't think people have the same like I need to have a Friday the 13th pinball machine

[30:16] I just don't think there is that level of excitement

[30:19] As if it was like you're gonna have an 18 pinball machine with you know, we're the 18

[30:24] um van is the cabinet all right, so I got an email from Blake do miss nail Blake. Thank you so much

[30:30] All right

[30:31] I'm just gonna read his top three because I got a lot to go through and I want to cover all to you guys

[30:36] So he said his top there are back to the future beetle juice and

[30:40] Bill and Ted's excellent adventure the characters the callouts the musical loan will make this a great theme

[30:46] But when you add in the time traveling phone booth and historical figures visiting the 80s

[30:52] Well, then it just brings it to a whole new level of fun

[30:55] So Blake I completely agree with back to the future and beetle juice

[30:59] Bill and Ted's excellent adventure pinball

[31:02] Again, it's like site unseen

[31:05] Site unseen means without seeing anything

[31:09] I'm all in on it and I

[31:12] I just bill and Ted's me. It's like it's close

[31:15] But I just don't think it would sell out site unseen

[31:18] He has runner-ups being blues brothers gremlins and jaws

[31:23] All right, then honorable mentions

[31:26] He said these might not sell out, but they would translate very well

[31:29] Who frame Roger rabbit dick Tracy in the rocket tier

[31:33] All right

[31:35] You know, I love you guys because you guys you get your top three in and you get your honorable mentions

[31:38] And then you get your like other things to consider before you know, and I'm reading out like 12 different movie themes

[31:43] I'm gonna keep it to the top three. I can't comment on all of these, but those are all those all would be amazing

[31:49] I got an email from Michael Shaulis. He said the top three

[31:53] And he gives a lot of rationale for these

[31:56] Spinal this is spinal tap a few good men

[32:00] And then he has the whole quote about you can't handle the truth and then here's an interesting one

[32:05] When Harry met Sally all right

[32:09] And then he goes into like imagine a wizard mode similar to the Lord of the Rings as you start to hear Meg Ryan moaning as she begins her fake

[32:16] Orc as I mean all right

[32:18] Michael Mike I appreciate these are all kind of funny and I love your rationale for these things

[32:25] I don't think when Harry met Sally would sell it all

[32:28] Neither would a few good men and

[32:30] Spinal tap I think would would be a decent seller, but definitely not a sight unseen sold out film

[32:35] Cody keel

[32:38] Cody thank you for listening to the show you said can it love the recent commentary on top gun

[32:42] The depiction of the nut hugger high five crack me up his top three are transformers the movie

[32:49] Big trouble and little china and blade runner

[32:52] All right, you hit on all these except for transformers, which I have to admit is isn't a very mainstream film

[32:59] But is one that I hold most dear all right, so here's

[33:03] Here's the thing

[33:05] Cody you I feel like we have like we're like brothers from from you know different mothers here

[33:11] Transformers the movie to me is the greatest

[33:15] animated movie of all time

[33:16] It is one of the most underrated and under appreciated animated films

[33:21] But it's not really because every single transformers fan every real transformer fan holds that movie with such high regard

[33:31] And esteem and accolades and praise it is beyond

[33:35] believable

[33:37] How well that movie continues to hold up even today when you watch it in 2018 the soundtrack in it is still the greatest soundtrack from any animated

[33:46] Film ever

[33:48] It was so progressive for its time. I mean they killed off to miss prime in the first 10 minutes of the movie

[33:54] Kids were crying. They had to leave the theater the amount of risks that Hasbro took with that film

[34:01] Is incredible and I think they you know, it's the last movie that Orson Wells ever did as the voice of unicron

[34:08] And the storyline is so great of the Autobots and the Decepticons having to unite to beat a common foe

[34:16] In unicron and the matrix of leadership and what that means and all the the story that is developed in that film

[34:23] Hot rod becoming Rod him is prime

[34:26] You know arise now Rod him is prime the lines are so good

[34:30] Site unseen that to me that would be the last pinball machine. I would ever buy if you told me that I could buy transformers the movie

[34:37] G1 limited edition

[34:39] But if we made it we would never sell you another pinball machine for the rest of your life

[34:44] I'm okay with that. I'm okay

[34:46] Like that is that is my favorite favorite favorite film from from being a kid

[34:52] Um big trouble a little China. We've talked a lot about that

[34:55] I think it would do it would be an interesting one

[34:57] I wouldn't be surprised if it sold out, but I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't sell out

[35:01] Um blade runner. I think would sell out. I think it has a large enough fan base

[35:05] And I think it's just that cool it's just that cool kind of theme that would be perfect for pinball

[35:11] All right, I got an email from Greg

[35:14] Greg over like let's see hey canada here is my wish list from the 70s 80s and 90s themes

[35:21] I didn't list jaws or back to the future since you listed them on your podcast

[35:25] number three the warriors

[35:28] 1979 great movie warriors come out and play hey

[35:32] um the warriors predator and wanes world

[35:37] all right

[35:38] All right, so we talked a lot about these other ones here

[35:41] So we didn't talk about warriors. So let's just that one. I um warriors again

[35:47] so

[35:48] We're making the warriors pinball machine based on the warriors movie limited edition without even seeing anything does it sell out

[35:55] Love the movie. It doesn't sell out. He has some honorable mentions here road out with Patrick Swaisy

[36:02] um scar face ace ventura the sandlot all right look at of all those and of all those

[36:09] I think scar face would have the best chance of selling out

[36:12] I think I score sage's scar face movie and again because scar face is just easier to

[36:18] It's one film. It's one film with so many iconic scenes and lines in it

[36:22] All right, I got an email from Joe Zankus Joe writes. We're number one back to the future number two goonies and number three

[36:29] die hard

[36:31] All right, Joe we agree. I think all of those all of those would sell out site unseen my god Scott Coleman wrote in

[36:38] Scott you list it like 15 things here. He said hey, canada

[36:43] I really enjoy the show and I like that you have a new episode up fairly often

[36:48] It gives me something to listen to at work fairly often

[36:52] Scott we're up like three times a week

[36:54] There's no other pinball podcast that even comes close to this cadence. They might beat me on

[36:59] quality, but I've got them on quantity

[37:02] so

[37:07] So for pinball machines theme based on the eighties I will list movies

[37:11] But I think you are missing out on themes that could be based off tv shows

[37:16] Animation and toys well look I I agree I didn't did I say only movies. I thought I said

[37:23] eighties maybe I did maybe I did he said top three that would sell out without seeing it number one big trouble in little China

[37:31] Number two blade runner number three mad and max

[37:35] For pinball themes based on the eighties. I think

[37:38] um stuff like he goes GI Joe he man Akira ghost in the show

[37:44] Quantum leap McGyver mash transformers

[37:49] garbage pale kids and Barbie

[37:52] All right

[37:53] Well Scott thank you for that amazing ones. I think out of those GI Joe he man again men by these machines GI Joe he man

[38:00] I love it here to death, but man. It's it's kind of niche

[38:03] Um, I'd be curious if there's enough anime fans to go in for that and ghost in the shell

[38:08] Quantum leap no way bro

[38:10] McGyver no way mash no way transformers. Yes garbage pale kids no way Barbie no way all right

[38:16] All right, look I'm like I'm like I got to shut shut down some of these quicker than others. All right. Let's see. Let's go here

[38:23] Sorry guys. I got popped out of my email

[38:26] Got another email from

[38:29] Brad laundry um

[38:31] He said Chris have having been listening for about a year now. I really enjoy your show and appreciate your stream of consciousness

[38:38] content

[38:39] Sure, this may get you into trouble now and again, but that's what makes it enjoyable

[38:44] As a suggestion for a future show it would be interesting to hear an interview with a distributor such as coin taker and pinball star

[38:52] As opposed to pinheads and collectors

[38:54] Um Brad from Rochester Brad. Thank you. I actually talked to pinball star before and I also I think I had coin taker on

[39:02] Once christmas coin taker. I'll get them back on the show. I talked to these guys all the time offline

[39:07] But you're right. I think we're long overdue to have a distributor join the show

[39:12] All right getting back into our themes. I got an email from Eric Higgins Eric

[39:17] Thank you for listening to the show you said canada after listening to your latest podcast where you went through 80s movies titles

[39:22] That would make a good pin. I couldn't help but wonder why 80s toy lines are never mentioned

[39:27] What five to ten toy lines do you think would make great pym from the 80s

[39:33] um how bad afs would it be to have stern or jjp produced g1 transformers masters of the universe g i joh

[39:42] um a r a h oh

[39:45] A real american hero

[39:48] Sorry guys. Let's actually go deep into the the universes here

[39:51] shouldn't one of those companies go after these licenses um

[39:56] Or have something like an original theme using company specifics

[40:00] Um, let's say hasbro mash up toy lines like g i joh transformers with

[40:05] Uh, okay, so he's saying combining like hasbro toy lines. There's no way they'll do that

[40:10] I mean, I've worked with hasbro directly

[40:13] They hold these properties sacred. It won't they'll never have like a transformers meets g i joh pym ball

[40:18] machine. It's no this isn't hannar bar bearer where it's like scubi do and and the jetsons are in the same episode

[40:25] For your here enjoyment

[40:27] He said if I had to choose one toy line

[40:29] I'd have to say masters of the universe would be an instant pre-order sellout

[40:34] After seeing spooky pimples owls Cooper. I strongly feel that castle gray skull was the design inspiration curious to hear your thoughts

[40:42] If you're ever in Kensington, California

[40:46] Um, I'd love to show you around all right eric. Thank you so much. Look, I I agree. I agree that

[40:52] um

[40:53] The movies are not the only things that we are in emotionally connected to from this time period the toy lines are also

[41:02] Just as powerful and could make just as great of a pym ball experience and I think all the ones you mentioned

[41:09] You got the big ones man g i joh transformers he man all of those sellout site unseen

[41:15] Now I'm curious is why no one said voltron which I also think voltron the the five lions forming voltron would be

[41:25] In incredible incredible pym ball machine experience and voltrons got like they got mumbera

[41:31] You know they've got all like the villain they've got all the cool like

[41:36] The the visual identity of voltron. I think would make for an amazing site unseen sold out pym ball experience

[41:43] But I think you guys are right and it is an interesting question why these manufacturers are not

[41:48] Going after these toy lines now here's my guess and again because I've worked with hasbro on many many projects

[41:55] Here's the issue with these companies and it's annoying and I know it's annoying

[41:59] They only want to focus on the present day

[42:03] Variations of these popular lines so even though you don't know it there are new versions of transformers and g i joh

[42:13] And like ninja turtles there's all these new toy lines that have constantly been coming out. There's actually even new

[42:19] You know tv shows based around transformers and whatnot and

[42:24] It's really hard to get them excited about letting someone license and promote in

[42:31] 2018 what came before and I really really really wish

[42:37] There was more

[42:39] Throwback stuff that was coming out from those lines from the 80s

[42:43] And I just think the licensors and the ip holders might make it difficult

[42:49] If say stern pym ball said we want to do transformers the movie the original and look at look at we got a transformers pin

[42:56] And it was based on the crappy Michael bay movies and nobody really really wants those

[43:03] Films to be the pym ball experience of transformers. They'd rather be the 80s movie in the 80s cartoon

[43:09] But that's the problem if you want to do a team

[43:12] They're gonna want you to do like the new a team movie if you want to do

[43:15] You know, I'm trying to think about something new that's coming out

[43:18] If you want to do the original Jurassic Park pym ball machine

[43:20] I bet they're gonna make you do the new movie and it's just because the studios will force them in that direction

[43:26] all right

[43:28] All right, let's see

[43:31] Let's see top five from Peter Gerstin

[43:34] Peter wrote hey Chris my top five sorry more than three number one jaws

[43:39] Awesome with the sound the callouts. We need a bigger boat. I agree back to the future godfather

[43:45] predator and kill bill all right

[43:48] So what do I think of these?

[43:50] Well jaws yes back to the future yes godfather. I don't think so predator maybe yes

[43:57] Kill bill is another one a Tarantino movie super freaking cool

[44:01] um, but it's new. I mean kill bill is like a much newer film and I'm just

[44:08] I'm just not sure like kill bill pym ball like sold outside unseen

[44:12] I just again like I just don't think it would be that way. I think people would have to see it

[44:17] Before handing over their money. I don't think people love kill bill that much

[44:21] Like if you were to ask the buyer base

[44:24] The 40 to 60 year old

[44:26] What would you rather see a he-man

[44:30] Masters of the universe pinball machine or kill bill it's like no

[44:34] It's not even like close he-man baby he-man

[44:39] He said but with all these themes it is how it's executed look at Star Wars aliens

[44:45] Game of Thrones all great themes with huge fan bases, but the pin doesn't work

[44:50] um, and I think he's right like

[44:53] But the thing is this is Star Wars sold outside unseen like all the Ellie slots were taken

[44:59] Star Wars was an interesting one because it's like when we saw it

[45:02] We didn't want it and I and I I don't think I've ever seen that happen before in pinball

[45:07] We're like the theme was something that sold out before people ever saw it

[45:11] And then when they actually revealed it people bailed and I think it just goes to show to you like what a miss

[45:17] What a miss Star Wars really was it's gonna go down as just like

[45:22] What could it been it always will go down as that all right

[45:26] All right, I think I'm pretty much done with emails. I got one more

[45:30] But the title is spooky. So let me read this spooky pinball

[45:34] Um from Joseph

[45:36] Love from Joe from Joe playing field. He's Joe playing field on pinstead. He said hi Chris

[45:41] Hope you're enjoying your time in Ireland one of the few places. I've never been it sounds amazing

[45:47] Don't forget to take your time for yourself travel is never about where you go

[45:52] It's the people you're with like I agree completely man

[45:55] Said anyway in your last podcast you were talking about spooky sales of Alice Cooper

[46:00] If you listen to Charlie's podcast you'll hear they may sell out at the time of the midwest show

[46:07] Obviously he's trying to create hype, but he is also aware of his brand

[46:13] Um

[46:14] Brian you mentioned in your previous podcast that you weren't sure why Charlie congratulates oh

[46:20] I don't know he says this is Brian here. I'm not Brian. I'm Chris

[46:25] um, he said you mentioned in your last

[46:27] Podcast that you weren't sure why Charlie congratulated stern on their release

[46:32] Chris since you work in marketing you know that brand can be more powerful than the products

[46:37] I'm pretty sure that Charlie is trying to create a warm fuzzy brand to go against stern

[46:41] That's how he wins

[46:43] He also openly projects himself as vulnerable which is what strong leaders do

[46:49] He's created a company culture that is brought on such a great team that it's going to be hard to beat spooky is here to stay

[46:57] Enjoy the rest of your trip look forward to your next podcast. Sorry for the typos

[47:01] I'm dictating this to series. So it's series fault. He called me Brian. So joy forgive you. We're still buddies

[47:07] um, look I

[47:08] The reason why I thought it was a little strange for competitors to be congratulating

[47:13] Other companies on their products is you just don't see that and I do agree that I think Charlie did it because

[47:19] Spooky is not trying to be like a traditional company. They're not trying to be a traditional competitor

[47:24] And they are just trying to make

[47:26] Pinball machines at a capacity in which they can make it and at a quality level. They are capable of

[47:34] And we see with each game they're making their games better and better and I do agree that spooky is here to stay because spooky ran their business

[47:40] Like a real business and they understand how to stay in business

[47:46] Which is something that a lot of the other you know new to the game boutique companies fail to do

[47:53] And you know, I I think there's still a lot of

[47:56] Question marks on the long-term viability of like a highway pinball or a Dutch pinball

[48:03] You know how many who deenies do they have to sell?

[48:05] To make money and they might not make a profit on game number one, but is that okay like can they

[48:14] Can American pinball whether that storm if they're not making money and get to game two now if game two is

[48:21] October fest you might as well put the you know, we're closed for business sign on the door

[48:26] I think if anyone is listening to this podcast right now

[48:30] Mr. Josh Kugler and Joe Balser and Davy and and you know, Jersey Jack and all our friends you heard it here

[48:40] These are the themes people want these are the themes people would pay for without even seeing it

[48:47] And we saw a lot of overlap you know if you're gerry at p3 and multi-morphic

[48:51] I don't care how much money it takes if your Robert Mueller over at deep route. I don't care

[48:57] What the licensing cost is these themes

[49:00] These themes that we keep hearing over and over again people would spend whatever it takes to get that pinball machine in their home

[49:08] And because there is nothing quite like the power the emotional power of an nostalgic theme that we've been dreaming about

[49:17] And this hobby is really interesting to me because

[49:21] There are like there are every once in a while

[49:23] There's like that special title that is just the the theme that you

[49:28] Have been waiting years and years and years for and when it happens and the game itself delivers on that theme

[49:36] It's like it's never leaving your home and you know which games those are

[49:40] You're staring at those games in your game room every night

[49:43] You just will never want to live in a world in which you don't own that game because that game means that much to you

[49:50] And you have that much fun playing it and one of the reasons you have that much fun playing it is not just because of the pinball experience

[49:57] It's because it's a theme that means so much to you

[50:01] You know, I I remember when I was a little kid

[50:05] Watching the transformer movie. I remember crying when Optimus Prime died

[50:09] I remember playing with transformer toys with my brother. I just I remember these moments

[50:16] Like they were here yesterday and they they almost mean more to me

[50:20] Than all the social stuff I do as an adult you know when you're an adult. It's weird

[50:25] You know stuff doesn't have the same magic. It doesn't have the same innocence

[50:29] And when we were kids when we were kids and when I was a kid in the 80s

[50:34] You know, I think we even became more

[50:36] Obsessed with these things because they were our only outlet like we didn't run to the internet

[50:43] We didn't run to devices. I didn't know what release date the new toy line was coming out

[50:49] I didn't have people reviewing the toys on YouTube and

[50:53] spoiling everything for me

[50:55] You know when we were kids

[50:57] Going into the toy store was like a magical moment where you saw something for the first time

[51:03] The same way when we used to go into the arcade even in going to the movies

[51:08] I mean it was this serendipitous age where things really

[51:13] Connected with us more because we connected with those things more because those things

[51:19] Had more of our attention and and and I say this is someone who works in marketing and understands

[51:25] The 80d world we live in today where I look at kids man. I look at kids

[51:30] Staring at phones staring at tablets and and and just it makes me so sad to think that an entire generation of people

[51:40] Are growing up without

[51:42] imaginations without

[51:45] The ability to like wait for something without the ability to dream about what something will be like without the ability to formulate their own opinion about something because

[51:55] By the time it's happened in the world

[51:57] I'm a thousand like

[52:00] Jerkoffs. I've already either like shit on it or spoiled it on social media

[52:05] I mean the world is just it's just a schizophrenic 80d

[52:10] Jumping from one thing to the next and and no one's ever satisfied with what they have and they don't save or anything anymore

[52:17] It's just on to the next on to the next on to the next and we even see that behavior a little bit in pinball right

[52:24] It's like iron maiden is the hot thing right now

[52:26] It is everything to so many people and then it's like well, what's next?

[52:30] You know, it's like we literally we we we can't just enjoy what we have for a long time

[52:35] We always need to replace that feeling with something new

[52:39] And it's just the way you know media works. It's the way the internet works

[52:44] It's the way our our brains are now being hard wired

[52:48] To not just be happy with the thing we got and enjoy it

[52:53] You know when we were kids we got toys and even if it wasn't the best toy

[52:57] Like we used our imaginations to make the playtime fun

[53:02] You know if you go back now and you go play some of those old video games we used to have or even some of the old toys

[53:08] We used to have you you might like look at them be like oh man

[53:11] I can't believe like this meant so much to me

[53:13] But there's a reason why there's a reason why like garbage pale kids were like so awesome to collect and find and

[53:20] You know you had a friend who had the complete first set you know like oh my god

[53:23] How did he get all them and there were so much and I remember like buying the first set of garbage pale kids for like

[53:31] 50 bucks and when I was a kid like 50 bucks was like so much money

[53:36] But I had him and it was like amazing and I like was so how every day would look at them. I would play with them

[53:42] And it was just like man like that $50 purchase

[53:46] Actually was like

[53:48] More magical to me than like some of these like

[53:50] Thousand eight thousand ten thousand more pinball machines that you know

[53:54] We're just trying to convince ourselves that there's meaning there

[53:58] You know, it's like the same way I feel about gardens of the galaxy. It's like I like the movies

[54:02] But like the pinball machine it's just it's just not there. It's just I want

[54:06] I want an eight to nine thousand dollar toy to have a level of magic to it

[54:12] That really really really makes me feel like that kid inside again

[54:16] And I know for some of you out there, you know

[54:18] You all have your pinball machine that does that and that's sort of what we're chasing after

[54:22] We're just these grown adults who who all really refuse to grow up like anyone who's in the pinball or cade machines

[54:29] Like we refuse to grow up and and that's that's awesome because there is no more magical time

[54:36] Then when you're a kid and life is more innocent and and and you make your friendships based on people you really like

[54:43] You know and you get older you have to become friends with people because

[54:47] There you might there might be an agenda attached or I need to get this person to like me because we're my boss

[54:52] When you're a kid you don't you don't have to live like that

[54:55] Right and that's why man. It's like I'm happy you guys listen to this podcast. I'm happy you guys are buying pinball machines

[55:01] I'm happy. They're still in army of people out there that just refuse to grow up

[55:06] You know that that that want to drive muscle cars that that puts you to into the environment that pop wheelies

[55:13] That's still playing Nintendo

[55:15] You know that's still like flip pinball machines on a weekly basis

[55:19] You know you could be reading sophisticated magazines and books all day long

[55:24] But you choose to play and I think play in the art of be of playing and being playful

[55:30] Is what the world needs right now? I mean the news is always so goddamn negative

[55:35] I think people need to learn you know to respect each other and have more fun and play around again with life
