[00:00] Shhh.

[00:02] It's oh so quiet.

[00:06] Shhh.

[00:09] It's oh so still.

[00:13] Shhh.

[00:15] Shhh.

[00:17] Shhh.

[00:20] Shhh.

[00:24] Why is it so hard for pinball companies to communicate?

[00:28] To just tell us as the customers of their products, what the status is of the games that we ordered.

[00:35] On this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast, I want to talk about Gundin Roses, Collector's

[00:40] Editions, and the communication around this game to the people who bought this game.

[00:45] I am one of them.

[00:47] I want to talk about how Haggis Pinball is selling Keltz Pinball right now.

[00:51] I want to talk about Ninja Turtles and how one little design choice in that game seems to be

[00:57] the Achilles heel of that game for most of the owners out there.

[01:02] And I also want to talk about Deep Brew Pinball for just a little bit.

[01:05] They started to communicate to their customers and sent them a notification that I want to just touch on briefly.

[01:12] Okay.

[01:13] Now, first and foremost, before we go into this, I saw a lot of conversation happening around play field issues this week.

[01:20] And this is a topic that just never goes away.

[01:23] And the reason why it doesn't go away is because the problem has never been solved.

[01:28] And there's only one company out there who has solved the play field clear coat issues and that is Spooky Pinball.

[01:35] They are the only company that has ever given me confidence going into a game that I was not going to have play field issues.

[01:42] And I have to say, my Rick and Morty was spectacular.

[01:46] The clear coat was amazing.

[01:48] And I see people now sharing photos of guns and roses, people sharing photos of their avengers.

[01:55] And whenever we see these photos, it's hard for me to say I didn't tell you so, right?

[02:00] Because we told you so years ago that these companies have not solved this problem.

[02:05] And it continues to be a problem.

[02:07] And at this point, I really don't know what we're supposed to do, right?

[02:12] I don't know what we're supposed to do.

[02:14] Everyone's going to open up a box and everyone is going to cross their fingers and hope that when they pull that game out, they're not going to see pooling.

[02:22] Right? They're not going to see chipping. They're not going to see other issues with the game.

[02:26] Now look, we've been harping on this topic for almost two years now on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[02:31] And we were the ones who told everybody not to buy Willy Wonka until the problem was solved.

[02:36] I really hope that this does not become a major issue with guns and roses, okay?

[02:42] We are going to monitor this very closely.

[02:45] Again, the only thing we can do at this stage is we can collect the data.

[02:50] And we can look at the playfields that are going to customers, not just Jersey Jack games, but avenger games and stern games moving forward.

[02:57] I still don't understand why we're having such inconsistencies when it comes to playfield quality, right?

[03:04] Like, isn't Miracle using the same process over and over again on every single playfield?

[03:09] So there shouldn't be like a bad batch. So we will see what happens. But again, every time I see this thread pop up, I'm like, we told you so.

[03:17] Okay. Now here's what I don't understand around the most amazing pinball launch of all time, which was the guns and roses launch.

[03:24] The easiest way to understand how to make your customers happy when it comes to revealing a game and shipping a game is so super simple.

[03:35] And stern pinball has been showing everyone how it's done. And I still for the life of me do not understand why Jersey Jack pinball cannot seem incapable of just following the easiest system in place for shipping games to customers.

[03:55] And by that, I mean this, you make a few pro versions of the game first. You put those pro versions of the game out on location to give people to give people a sample of what the game is to come.

[04:10] And you just get the game out there, right? You get the line moving. The next game that stern pinball builds after the pro version of the game, they build every single L.E. next.

[04:22] They let the highest paying customers get on the plane first. Okay. Other than those few pros, to me the few pros they build before the L.E.s are just like letting the pilot and the staff on the plane.

[04:34] But then they build every single L.E. before they even build a single premium game. So all 500 Avengers L.E.s are on the line before the premium people get their games.

[04:47] And that's how it should be for a few very obvious reasons. First and foremost, you paid the most money. You should get the experience before the people who paid less money.

[04:58] And basically the premium and the L.E. are the exact same game. So give the people that paid more access to that experience first. Okay. Now what is Jersey Jack pinball doing right now with Guns and Roses? It is really, it is really strange what they're doing.

[05:13] So they built the L.E.s first. Okay. So that is like building the premiums first. They built a hundred L.E.s first. And then they went and built s's of the game. And then they're going to build more I think L.E.s again before they get to the C.E.s.

[05:31] So that is the equivalent. If we were to put that in stern sort of verbiage, that would be like stern building a few premiums first of Avengers. Then the pro version of Avengers. Then who knows what's next? Maybe it's the L.E.s or maybe it's more premiums.

[05:49] Okay. Are you confused? Because I'm confused. But it shouldn't be confusing. And people who bought these 12,500 dollars collect those additions. Why are they still? Why are they still? What is it October 23rd or 24th? Why are they still confused about when they're getting their game?

[06:08] And it doesn't have to be an exact date. But they're confused about when the collector's additions are even going on the line. And the other people that are confused. Not just the customers, but none of the distributors have any idea. Have any clue when these games are going on the line. And it's not just when how many are they going to build all 500 at once? Are we going to get 100 in a batch? And then they're going to stop and build more L.E.s. And then they're going to build another 100 s's. And then they're going to build another 100 C's.

[06:37] Are we going to get them all in one sort of big swoop? I don't know. Nobody knows. Absolutely nobody knows. And here's the thing. I'm not personally in a rush. I'm going to wait to see where I put this game, depending on where I end up living because I really don't want to live in New York City anymore. And Brenda and I are starting to think about where we go next. And I'd rather wait to where I land next than get the machine, have to pack it up all that jazz.

[07:06] I won't lie. I also want to see how the play field quality nets out because if the play field quality turns out to be really wonka all over again. I might have to tell my distributor, I'll just wait to the end of the run to see if they fix the problem.

[07:20] Because right now I'm really like I'm torn part of me is like first I hope there's no issue. But if there seems to be issues on certain games.

[07:28] Part of me is like do I just send this game out to like high end pinball to have them go over it and reclear coat the game. Do I buy another play field and have cruise men do something with it.

[07:38] You know it's like I don't want to have to even go down this option list. And again I think it's too early to say that I have to because I haven't heard any issues with Willy Wonka's collector's additions. I think they fixed the problem then.

[07:53] So I'm just going to have to wait and see but this is beyond that this is beyond that I think Jersey Jack pinball had the greatest launch ever with guns and roses. But now I think now I think they're starting to like be a little bit confused about what's next and they're sort of taking the approach of silence until we know.

[08:13] But how did they not have this figured out and how did they not have something to say at least give us something right at least give your best customers and I mean that like your highest paying customers should be the ones you over communicate to any can be any communication they'll take it send them 500 t shirts tell them this is our ballpark time frame you don't the promise a date.

[08:39] But I think some communication is important and none of it which is where we're at right now just isn't good it just isn't good I mean I was talking to Eric all the time during this games amazing launch and then I hit him up the other day I'm like hey any ballpark on the C.E. nothing no response nothing so I don't know what's going on I don't know if the if the play field issues have them a little bit anxious about what to say I'm not sure but I do know this no communication.

[09:08] To your biggest customers is not good and that's just something that I hope this company improves as they continue you know to make games and continue to like release titles because it's not just about a big pop at release you now have to like follow up and continue that journey with your customers because we're all on the customer journey right now with Jersey Jack pinball and this title is so hot and it's so popular that this is the first time ever they've had.

[09:38] This many customers on the journey with them at the very beginning and I just want to see them handle it a little bit better I just don't think you can do this and sell people 12,000 five hundred dollar products and then go radio silent on them for two weeks as they watch all these other people unbox their games and I think the silliest thing to I got to say this I think it's just absolutely silly that people who spend the least amount of money got to go in front of all the first class passengers no no no it's so.

[10:08] Easy when you pay the most you get the experience first the VIPs get into the club first they get on the plane first all right so let's see what happens I hope everyone finally get some word on their C.E.s next week all right all right so what else is going on in pinball so I did a little digging on pin side the other night because I'm like let me just read on some of these titles that we haven't really talked about very much you know I haven't had a chance to play Avengers L.E. yet.

[10:36] My good friend Adam down in Tribeca he got his L.E. I've been so busy at work I haven't been able to make it down there but I'm really hoping to hop on his machine he's got the most amazing pinball set up and the game just looks really beautiful there and so I've been seeing some of the streams not many the feedback I've seen on Avengers has been very very positive so I'm very confident I'm going to jump on this machine and have a really good time and I think Stern has a home run with this title for sure okay so I started digging around.

[11:06] I went into the sewer and I started reading what is going on with Ninja Turtles because it just feels like a title I haven't really heard that much about since it's been out right covid hit Ninja Turtles hit it was the title everyone ran to Stern was really smart they got all those Ninja Turtles on the line pretty quickly and once the order banks opened people like fled to Ninja Turtles because

[11:32] fled to or fled you can you fled to something or you fled fled from something people people move towards Ninja Turtles and the sales I heard were pretty good but then I didn't hear much and then I start to read all about all the issues with the L.E.

[11:49] But last night as I was reading through the thread it seemed like there was one common denominator that was really impacting most people's fun on the game well maybe two things the first is one that I just don't have enough experience like saying

[12:01] yes or no on it is basically people are starting to realize that the code in Ninja Turtles is again a weak point in the game how many chances do you get to make the code in these games and it's just it is what it is it is what it is but but that's not really that's not really the main issue I keep hearing about Ninja Turtles okay the main issue that I keep hearing about Ninja Turtles is the left out lane now apparently this left out lane in this game is just brutal the question I want to

[12:31] raise for everyone on this podcast is this when you have a very casual theme like Ninja Turtles like Ghostbusters you know a theme that appeals to a broad audience

[12:42] Scott nostalgic value the last thing you want to do with a theme like Ninja Turtles that both kids and adults love the last thing you'd want to do right is design a game that has a really frustrating like unfair sort of drain designed into it

[12:57] and so the left out lane here's the problem with it and this to me this is like such a bone head move you can't adjust the left out lane post at all it's permanent it's not a post that's movable so it's set at a certain position and that gap in the left out lane is pretty wide open and there's nothing you can do that to me is the weirdest thing that you could ever do on a game like a Ninja Turtles like and just in general

[13:24] a pinball machine should never have the inability to make it a little bit easier when it comes to those out lane drains right how easy is it to design it so that you can either open them up wide right you could open them up for

[13:39] tournament players and for really high skilled players or if you want to put it in your home and you have kids and they're not that good at

[13:46] pinball or you want to learn the game a little bit and have longer ball times you can adjust it and make it easier by my point being to design a pinball machine in modern times in which so many of them are going into

[13:57] people's homes and to take away the ability to make that game any easier for people I think is idiotic it is idiotic I also have always thought that a game should come from the factory not too hard it just you can always make it harder but I always

[14:15] didn't frustrate it too because there is a moment when people want to play the game the way the designer thinks it's best set up for the majority of players you hear me a game should be set up to be enjoyable for the majority of players when it leaves the factory and I always I always find it annoying when games are designed for players of skills that's for way too high like out of the box the game is brutally hard I just think that is such a bonehead move if you let a game go out into

[14:45] the wild that way okay and I can already hear the tournament players be like play better play better but no no there's just there's no reason why this game should be frustrating so many the owners right now and there's nothing they can do I mean maybe you can add a little bit of a

[15:00] thicker rubber this or that and it just takes one design flaw like that I mean it it takes one design flaw to sink a games enjoyment so in out lane like that you know willy walk I heard a lot of people don't like the left

[15:14] out lane either don't like the way the pops just put the ball right down the middle I mean do we forget the flipper gap in ghost busters right so when a game as a design flaw that makes it unfairly challenging that could be all it takes to make that game undesirable

[15:32] alright so I think Ninja Turtles it's it just seems like a game that's starting to sink more and more into that black hole of I just want to say it like a little bit of relevant it's just going to be one of those games that

[15:45] doesn't last the test of time maybe for design reasons maybe for code reasons but I'll say this if you're Ninja Turtle fan I would just wait because these games are going to be going for cheaper and cheaper and cheaper every month it goes by

[15:57] Ninja Turtles are going to become less and less expensive and that's good for the second hand market for a lot of you guys who ran into a Ninja Turtles

[16:05] is it the dream theme you thought is it providing you hours of fun is the game problem free is that left out lane killing the fun for you

[16:14] that's what I'm reading that's what I'm reading I haven't had enough time on it myself to say that's the case but it's more about the design thing I think that's the important thing for me I think people need to start designing these white woods

[16:27] in a way that has more mass appeal and I think that's why so many people are really enjoying guns and roses because even if you're not an amazing pinball player you can jump on a guns and roses and have a really really good time and do a lot of stuff in the game can you do that with Rick and Morty maybe

[16:46] probably not a very casual player is not going to walk up to Rick and Morty and start an adventure even they probably can't even hit a ramp and I know you're saying like well that's not you know you should be able to at least do that but you know there's just some of these games where even Rick and Morty lately I've been hearing people like all the tweaks owners have to do to make the game smooth and shoot right like that just shouldn't be the case we shouldn't have to like take our new games apart and tweak them so they just shoot shoot

[17:15] right imagine this imagine if you pulled out of a car dealership with your brand new car and the alignment was all off and the cars going all over the road like what would you do what would you do would you align it yourself or would you take it right back to the dealership and say fix this thing and that's what I think we should start expecting you know more than just clear

[17:35] coat I think we should expect these games to be smooth out of the box you should not have to make the game shoot right this not a switch adjustment right it's not a light bulb that fell out it's not a connector that got unplugged when it was

[17:50] shipping some of these games like they just don't shoot the right way unless you do a bunch of tweaks and I don't think we should have to do that all right okay but man it is a good time to be in

[17:59] pinball I'm excited I really am I mean there's a lot there's a lot to be excited about in pinball that I think a lot of us are enjoying right now

[18:07] all right so what else is going on so Haggis pinball they're releasing counts and it is out the fact that there's a pinball machine made in Australia

[18:17] I think right away they're probably going to sell most of these games to people in Australia because they're going to be so much cheaper to buy this game

[18:26] then the import fees these guys have to pay on on us games that are brought in and it's just nuts it is nuts how much more Australians pay for pinball machines so I'm assuming it's a lot cheaper to buy this game because there's no import tax on it and it's the Australian dollar to the Australian dollar when you buy this game now that being said I did

[18:48] chuckle when I saw that when they announced this game they announced that they're only making 200 we're only going to make 200 counts games

[18:57] you know and I know and we all know that there's no market demand for counts there's like zero like it it is up there it is

[19:07] but to me counts is even below October fest I mean in terms of theme selection there's nobody out there who woke up ever and said you know what theme

[19:16] I want in pinball counts right there's just there's nobody not even the kelt's want this game okay not even the kelt's want this game but that being said there are

[19:25] people out there that want a unique pinball experience and the fact that this game is unique it's different it's got a an

[19:34] indestructible play field which is great they these guys finally figured out when you do the reverse printing on the

[19:40] plexia I don't know the whole terminology but it doesn't dimple it doesn't dent it's the way they're doing it is awesome I

[19:47] really think that the the biggest innovation to come out of pinball in the last few years is haggis is play field

[19:53] innovation and I'm so surprised that more companies aren't looking at what they're doing and I told them when I

[19:59] interview Damien these guys should just make play fields for people like screw Mirko like make these play fields

[20:04] for all the companies and make them dent and dimple and pooling free and that might be a better business model

[20:10] than making kelt's but anyway so there's only 200 available looks the notion of manufactured scarcity it can work

[20:18] but is it going to work are they going to sell 200 it just reminded me of when cosmic carnival sold you know only 150 or

[20:26] only 200 games it doesn't matter that you put that there I don't think a single level game like this can

[20:33] sell 200 but here's where I think they might reach that goal it's simply because of the fact that it's in Australia

[20:41] and those crazy Aussies pay so much money for games that I think there might be enough collectors in Australia

[20:48] who will just support a company from Australia so they can sell like a hundred there will they find a home

[20:56] elsewhere in the world I don't know I don't know it's a hard thing to to wake up again and just like with all the

[21:02] options land on a theme like that and I hope that the next theme they come up with is far better learn how to build games on a theme

[21:11] that might be you know undesirable but your next game your soft more game has to be a theme people want okay all right so no

[21:20] news from Chicago gaming company whatsoever this continues to be like the forever waiting game for Chicago gaming company

[21:26] to give us something any news from American pinball with them I don't think hot wheels has sold very well

[21:32] and I'm curious what they're going to do next I don't know what they're going to do next I don't know what the future holds for them

[21:38] I think the competition is very stiff right now everyone's gonna have to up their game to find buyers and I think it's just going to get harder and harder for AP I really do I mean

[21:47] I was reading a thread on Pinside in which someone's trying to sell a Houdini with only 30 plays Houdini with only 30 plays for

[21:55] 5175 it was at last night and even then it was just sitting there even then and people are like it's a $5,000 pin I mean a $5,000 pin and Houdini's pretty packed people

[22:09] it's pretty packed and it's crazy to me so you talk about a game like Houdini what maybe they sold 600 it's got a ton of stuff in it

[22:18] it's a theme like Houdini everyone knows Houdini a magic theme everyone says magic is great for pinball and yet you can't even give it away at 5175

[22:29] and that just goes to show how competitive pinball is right now how you either make a magical game or you're going to be DOA now

[22:38] like it is so much harder to be successful in 2020 than it was like six years ago I was listening to the Buffalo stream tonight and they were talking about

[22:48] kelbs and they're like well you know spooky started out small with 150 America's most haunted right and they grew slowly from there

[22:57] yeah but you got to remember when spooky came out with America's most haunted the pinball landscape was so radically different

[23:04] there weren't nearly the amount of titles there weren't nearly the amount of like great games out there now there are so many other players in pinball that are making games and also it's just timing right

[23:15] if America's most haunted came out the same month as guns and roses you best believe spooky pinball might have never gotten off the ground

[23:24] if there was a guns and roses pro that was the same price as amh right so that's a thing it's like it's just so much harder

[23:32] and that's why in this difficult climate in pinball more than ever you really have to get the theme right you really have to deliver something unique and different

[23:41] and just making pinball is not going to be enough anymore so speaking of making pinball I got hit up by Ed Robertson he's like Chris

[23:48] did you just call Gary Stern a liar for saying he has 5,000 games back ordered and Ed told me that they have 5,300 games back ordered exactly 5,300 not 5,299

[24:05] not 5,300 and 1 but ladies and gentlemen Ed Robertson knows how many games Stern has back ordered okay so Ed's my new fact checker so anytime I say something I'm going to make sure Ed is brought in and can fact check if I'm right or wrong

[24:22] all right so deep route oh there's not really any real deep route news people it's like when you know when you say deep route now you kind of got to say it like you sign like you know it's like how's everything going

[24:33] everything's good and someone's like what about deep route like deep route deep route you know and I've been hearing that they've been communicating to people on the Zidware claims list that they are expecting to ship games by the end of the year end of the year

[24:49] now I really hope they clarified what year they were talking about is it this year is it next year is it 5 years from now and also the people who are in on an original Raza are being told that they will get the standard base version of the Raza as a make good I think that's disappointing to all those people too

[25:09] because remember when these people gave John Papaduk money for Raza they were buying a limited 100 game high end Pimmel machine that was $10,000 now they're being told that they're just going to get the base version of the game

[25:25] and so how much is the base version five six thousand dollars right it's really looking like all of those people are kicking themselves they should have taken the money when Robert was handing out the money I think it was like four five thousand dollars that people got if they wanted a refund on their Raza deposit

[25:45] and those people who got refunds gentlemen stand up and pat yourselves on the back because you you dodged a bullet and you did the right thing I mean the fact that people all the people didn't get refunds when the money was being handed out is crazy

[26:02] and it just goes to show that once again people's dreams of John Papaduk delivering will not come true and I don't know if they're ever going to come true but it just doesn't look good

[26:14] it doesn't look good they they need to show that they have an assembly line at least like it's almost November so let's just say hypothetically we've got 10 months left in the year where is the line where are the parts where's this octo assembly we heard so much about that's what we need to see until we see that no one's getting anything

[26:36] and from what I've heard from the deep roots six that went down there you know we've let them go right we don't hear about the deep six anymore it's like they were able to to escape into the night as we got distracted by guns and roses but let me tell you what I heard from the deep six okay from those in the deep six who broke NDA right they signed an NDA from those who broke NDA let me tell you what I heard from them I heard they saw zero manufacturing I heard there was absolutely no manufacturing that they saw

[27:05] they went into a room and it was basically like an empty manufacturing room I mean there was stuff in there there was no assembly going on there was no manufacturing taking place so they didn't see any manufacturing taking place so thank you deep six for not reporting on what you saw should we let them off the hook look I don't think anything they did is wrong I don't think that we should hold these people forever accountable for going down to see a game that was supposed to be really good

[27:35] they revealed the day after they were down there or two days after they were down there and then all of a sudden now they're like they have to be silent for the rest of their lives around this thing that's not what a pinball reveal trip should be it's not it's not really their fault it really isn't you know if you get invited to go test drive a car and you're a journalist and you sign an NDA that says you're not going to talk about like the car this or that okay fine but if you go test drive the car and the wheels fall off there are car blows up on the track

[28:04] You're allowed to go back and tell people I went to go test drive the new car and blew up right the NDA does not protect you from that you know or the wheels fell off and I think deep fruit sort of doesn't understand like you can't you can't hide everything forever like eventually it's gonna get out there right all right what else is going on in pinball hook up a subwoofer to your Guns and Roises I've been reading about that it the game comes alive

[28:28] There's a lot of talk about the speakers in the game. You know when I played this game

[28:32] I never felt like the speakers didn't sound good. This is the game sounded amazing

[28:35] So I'm just I'm it's like what do we want?

[28:38] Sometimes I'm like I read pinstead. I'm like what do you people want like what will make you happy?

[28:43] Will anything ever make people on pinstead happy? I don't even know if it's like pinball

[28:48] That's the problem. I wish I could sort of see how how most of these people who are always complaining on there

[28:55] How they spend their their lives like what are their days like are they are they exercising?

[29:00] Do they have a job they enjoy do they have kids? They love a wife?

[29:04] They love like what what makes people compelled to go on to a pinball form almost on a daily basis and

[29:11] Find something horribly wrong with pinball right did you guys get that way by listening to me?

[29:17] I hope not I hope not no so look this has been episode 523 to put a pin on it

[29:23] Jersey Jack pinball needs to do a much better job communicating to their top tier customers

[29:28] What the time frame is you don't have to give people specific dates

[29:32] But just give them a ballpark of what they can expect you need to over communicate to your best customers and

[29:39] Going silent like this wild these guys have to watch Ellie buyers have all the fun

[29:43] That's not the way to do it

[29:45] Stern showed you how to do it Jersey Jack make the essays first then make all your collectors additions and then make your

[29:53] Elise it's that easy it really is that easy and that's the best way to do it

[29:57] Stern pinball has 5300 back ordered games because Ed Robertson said so so it's fact

[30:04] What else is going on haggis pinball is only making 200 Celts only not even the Celts want to buy

[30:34] Who cares if there's longer ball times man stop making these games so damn frustrating out of the box

[30:41] It's such a stupid design decision

[30:49] Long ball times let me tell you something the really good players. They don't buy new inbox machines

[30:54] They don't most of them do not all right. That's been episode 523 of Canadian pinball podcast

[31:01] It's kind of like a late night edition and does my voice sound a little smoother
