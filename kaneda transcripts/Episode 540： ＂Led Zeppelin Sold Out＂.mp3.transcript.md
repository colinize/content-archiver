[00:00] I'm not gonna lie, I did not grow up as a huge Led Zeppelin fan, but I've been listening

[00:19] to Led Zeppelin all weekend and I must say this pan is really good, like someone should

[00:24] make a pinball machine based on Led Zeppelin and we're about to get it from Steve Richie

[00:29] and Stern Pinball and you know I don't really like Iron Maiden and when I listen to the Iron Maiden

[00:35] catalog it reinforced why I don't really love Iron Maiden but Zeppelin, man I think they're way

[00:41] better than Iron Maiden but it's all subjective but I'm here to tell you right now what is not

[00:46] subjective is what I'm about to say Stern's Led Zeppelin Pinball machine, the Ellie version of the

[00:53] game is sold out. I called around to all the major distributors and they told me they're a lot

[00:59] meant for the next Stern Ellie which is Led Zeppelin is all spoken for so I think what we're about

[01:05] to see tomorrow when we see the game it doesn't matter right from a sales perspective this thing is

[01:10] gone. It makes total sense when you think about how extremely popular this band is and if you only

[01:16] make 500 of a limited edition version of a game how quickly those will go. I mean we saw

[01:23] guns and roses sell 500 12,500 dollar machines in one hour. Now a question I have is Stern saw that

[01:33] happen they saw how many GNR sold and at what price so the question I'm curious about does Stern

[01:40] make more than 500 Led Zeppelin's because clearly the demand is well passed that number or will they

[01:46] keep it small and keep this game somewhat sought after for a very long time. We'll see where that

[01:52] goes because if you remember Star Wars had 800 Ellie's and that was a Steve Richie pin so they

[01:59] might be bumping this up knowing that it's such an amazing amazing theme now if they make 800 Led Zeppelin's

[02:07] will that sell out immediately on day one. I don't know I don't know we'll have to see I think the

[02:14] next thing we need to see is what's the game like it's a really interesting phenomenon in which

[02:19] these games and these titles when they're so popular they will sell out before anyone even sees

[02:24] it they will sell out before anyone even plays it right and there's not many themes that will do

[02:30] that for people but they are themes like Ghostbusters like Led Zeppelin like guns and roses like

[02:38] back to the future like Harry Potter like the Matrix would do that and that's why theme matters so

[02:46] much you know it's incredible that Stern can sell hundreds of machines and no one's even seen it

[02:53] and other companies out there will show you their product will open their order banks and they're

[02:58] struggling even to sell a couple hundred right we'll talk a little bit about Raz and where the

[03:02] numbers are at we're not sure where the numbers are at but here's my final thought before we get

[03:07] to see this game revealed to the world will this be Steve Richie's redemption or will this be

[03:14] Steve Richie's retirement moment and I think people are going to look at this title and they're

[03:20] gonna want to see Steve Richie knock it out of the park I mean I'm rooting for him to knock it out

[03:25] of the park I know you're rooting for him to knock it out of the park if you're called the king

[03:31] a king needs to rule over the land and right now there are a lot of incredible new designers in

[03:38] Keith L wins Scott Denise Eryk Minier to be the king and to remain the king into old age you have

[03:47] to every once in a while pick up that sword get on that horse and lead people to the promised land

[03:54] so will Steve Richie do it with Led Zeppelin Star Wars was a miss Game Throne was a miss he hasn't

[04:02] had a hit recently so I think a lot of people are hoping that this becomes the game that Steve

[04:08] Richie reclaims his throne because other people are occupying that throne right now if you were to

[04:13] ask me but it's going to be a sale success regardless of what the game is because of theme alone

[04:20] this game will sell very very well so we look forward to seeing it tomorrow I think what's really

[04:25] fun about this is we're really going to have a great comparison and contrasting Led Zeppelin

[04:31] by Stern Pimball versus Guns and Roses with Jersey Jack Pimball these two titles like it or not

[04:37] if you remove the subjectivity of the music itself they're both the juggernaut acts they both have

[04:42] incredible music it's then going to come down to which company is giving you the most bang for the

[04:49] buck which company is incorporating the theme and the license the best into the game it's going to

[04:55] be really really hard for Stern Pimball to do something better than Guns and Roses I think

[05:00] everybody feels that way and I'm glad that Jersey Jack Pimball raised the bar to the level by which

[05:07] they raised it because this is good for us as Pimball buyers for a company to elevate and bring

[05:14] it to the next level now will this game be able to compete with Guns and Roses and will it bring

[05:20] something original and new to the table because Guns and Roses brought a lot of new stuff to the

[05:25] table and just the concept of putting a rock concert inside a box like what will Led Zeppelin be

[05:32] what approach will they take what will be the storyline or the purpose of the game

[05:36] how many songs will they have inside the machine will they be full tracks like Guns and Roses or

[05:41] will they be just cut-ups of tracks they're probably not going to get 21 songs like G&R had

[05:47] who will do the art in the game that's the other thing I'm really curious about because in the past

[05:51] I've always felt like Steve Richie doesn't really embrace artwork and artwork is never really

[05:57] something that matters a lot to his games and we have to look no further than the art package and

[06:01] Star Wars the art package on Game of Thrones one of the worst art packages I think in the

[06:06] history of Pimball you know we have Black Knights art package okay it got better but man this is

[06:12] the moment will Steve give us everything he's got a killer theme will there be a killer art package

[06:19] we know the game's gonna have flow that's what he's great at will there be toys in it I heard

[06:25] there's gonna be a blimp bash toy does that make sense why would you bash a blimp you know I get

[06:31] ringing the bell and AC DC but bashing a blimp doesn't seem to make much sense you know it's like

[06:37] it's funny when people would say like there's no bash toy in Guns and Roses but I'm like well

[06:41] you're going to a Guns and Roses concert right that's what the game is trying to do like why would

[06:45] you be bashing something if you're at a rock concert it wouldn't make any sense with the theme of

[06:51] the game okay all right so all these answers will be out tomorrow and obviously we're going to be

[06:57] discussing it on Kineha just Pimball podcast but always a great day when Stern Pimball releases a

[07:03] new machine and we get to witness and bear witness to the most well oiled machine in Pimball because

[07:10] we know when they sell this game you're not going to have to wait months to get it now if I could

[07:15] give Stern one piece of advice it would be to have high res images ready to go immediately tomorrow

[07:21] because here's what's gonna happen they are doing their conference call with their European

[07:26] distributors tomorrow and that's where the first photos will come from people will screen grab

[07:32] that presentation that Gary does and then that's going to be the first time the world sees this game

[07:37] with crappy cell phone images so Stern please just put the game up to night at midnight get it

[07:45] going okay give people the best first impression you can of these games all right so speaking of

[07:52] game sales and games going up for sale you know I'm already predicted Led Zeppelin sells out

[07:56] tomorrow immediately if you didn't get on the list for one you're probably already locked out

[08:01] rasa pre-orders are open now I don't know how many they've sold I think based on the owners

[08:07] thread where people were sharing what their invoice number was that they were somewhere around

[08:13] 30 games sold 25 30 but look I don't know that for a fact there's no way for me to fact check that

[08:19] there's no way they will reveal that to us so there's no point in me even asking but here is

[08:24] something funny that did happen a rasa owners thread popped up on pinside and so people were starting

[08:32] to say hey I ordered the game I ordered one I ordered two here's my number and pinside shut down

[08:40] the rasa owners thread they locked it because that thread violated their own policy that to have

[08:47] an owner's thread a game has to be shipping now I thought that was kind of comical that they

[08:54] reminded the team at deep root and the fans of the game that it is too soon to do a victory lap

[09:02] it's too soon to take credit for having a game you're not part of an owners club the only thing

[09:09] these people own right now is a spot in line to get the game they don't own a game yet and we hope

[09:17] they own a game we hope they're unboxing their games in a few weeks I don't know when the clock

[09:23] starts on deep root they said four to six weeks is the average by which they should be held to when

[09:31] it comes to revealing a game and shipping a game so that is sometime in mid to end of February so

[09:38] the clock starts ticking January 1st so we'll see what happens there all right what else is happening

[09:44] this week it's not just one new machine this week alien pinball is going to be revealed to the

[09:50] world by the pinball brothers for some reason it seems like the reveal is the super awesome pinball

[09:56] show podcast with Christopher francey so definitely tune into that show on friday we are all going to

[10:02] be listening to see a few things we know the game is alien we know the art package is orics old

[10:09] art package I do think they missed a golden opportunity to improve the art package in the game

[10:16] because here's why here's why I think it makes no sense to carry over that art package first and

[10:21] foremost it's just not a great art package and it's no insult to oric the problem with that art

[10:26] package is that Andrew lied to them and told them they could not use hand drawn artwork and we

[10:33] know that's a lie because we saw the Brian Allen hand drawn artwork translate okay so he was not

[10:40] giving oric all of the cards he had to work with because if oric knew that that they could get an

[10:46] illustrator to create this play field he's a creative director he would have went and found someone

[10:53] to make this game with him and to bring it to life in the best possible way and we see illustrated

[10:59] alien artwork all over the place with comic books with t-shirts with other things so this was

[11:05] such a lunch box deal when it came to the artwork on this game and here's the other reason why I

[11:11] would never have carried it over when you carry over the same exact art package that Andrew highway

[11:17] made with highway pinball all that does is tell me this is still highway pinball this is still

[11:25] highway pinball's game this is still highway pinball's art package you are carrying over one of

[11:31] the most major decisions made by highway pinball but then you don't want people to think you're highway

[11:37] pinball and that is why I think this is a colossal mistake if you wanted to put a stake in the ground

[11:44] and say we are an all new company this is an all new reimagining of alien pinball in which we invested

[11:51] so much time and energy into the greatest way they could have visually brought that to life and

[11:56] said this is a brand new game even though it's based on an older design is to change the artwork on

[12:02] it what a great way to refresh it because we've seen this art package now for over four years four

[12:09] five years why not when you've spent all this time reengineering the game go get a more talented

[12:18] artist to illustrate this thing because now I'm worried that the cabinet artwork is simply going to

[12:23] be a flat version of what was already on the game itself I mean is it now the 40th anniversary

[12:30] of alien remember it was like the 35th anniversary last time the game came out so I think that was a

[12:34] mistake so we know the art package looks like it used to we know the screen is not on the playfield

[12:40] anymore we know it's a wide body game we know they've added a magnet we know they've changed a lot

[12:46] of the electronics so really the only thing left to hear from the pinball brothers when they do

[12:52] the super awesome pinball show is how much is this game how many models are they going to make

[12:58] where are they making it who's making it and when will games ship now the one question I hope that

[13:04] Christopher francey asked them there's one question that really really really needs to be asked

[13:10] because you can't just forget what happened you can't just forget that all of the pinball brothers

[13:16] were highway pinball I know it's convenient to completely try to forget that but here's the one

[13:22] question I would ask because they were over there taking people's pre-order money when they knew

[13:27] the strategy was to bankrupt highway pinball the question I want to know is how much money did the

[13:34] pinball brothers acquire the highway pinball assets what was the dollar amount that they paid

[13:42] to acquire all of those highway pinball assets I'm hearing some rumors that it was comically low

[13:49] like comically low and does that make sense and is that fair to do it that way and look we may never

[13:55] get that answer but that is the question I want to know because I just feel like this was all part

[13:59] of the plan and again if it's an all new company and you want us to think about you as an all

[14:04] new entity why would you make your game look exactly the same as Andrew highways vision I know you're

[14:10] changing the cabinet but why did you make the game look pretty much exactly the same but yet two

[14:15] years you had two years to really make it look and feel as different as you could all right what else

[14:21] is going on in pinball if you have a Rick and Morty good news there's a code update that has two

[14:26] new adventures I think it has scary Terry and Rick potion number nine now what I really like

[14:31] about Rick potion number nine I think you only play it after you get through nine adventures so I

[14:38] like that because I've said one of my criticisms of the game was there's nothing to work towards so

[14:44] this is a really good move it's a smart move and I think for those of you who have a Rick and Morty

[14:49] it's really great now that you have something to achieve and something to reach for in the game

[14:55] and I've been speaking to my friends who have their Rick and Morty's they love this new code update

[15:00] and they are enjoying the game now you know me you know me I sold mine I think I got out when the

[15:05] going was good I got $11,000 for my Rick and Morty happy on that resale the owner is happy with

[15:12] the game it had the butter cabinet so I didn't make a ton of profit on it but I made a nice chunk of

[15:17] change there are always a lot of Rick and Morty's up for sale and I think one of the reasons that is

[15:23] is two things I think a lot of people bought it who aren't die hard fans I also think a lot everyone

[15:29] bought it without being able to play the game and so here we are again everyone's gonna buy Led Zeppelin

[15:34] without ever playing it everybody who bought guns and roses never played it this is the new pinball

[15:40] you absolutely get no chance to play your machines before you buy them it's kind of unfortunate

[15:48] it really is why it's sad there's no shows going on right now because the shows are really where

[15:53] we got to do this and even if we didn't personally get to do it the shows were always the moments

[16:00] in which the manufacturers would reveal their game and then all these people would jump on it and a

[16:06] lot of the people who would jump on it where people we trust it and people that we believed in so

[16:12] we got all of these reviews from the community and then we had a good sense of how the game shot

[16:17] of whether or not it was magical if there were great moments if the code was good we really got like

[16:22] reviews like you got reviews from people there are no reviews now there is no way to know if the game

[16:29] is great or not like I look at Raza right now and I just don't know how you know if the game is good

[16:34] or not I don't know if we have enough not enough people have played it and that's gonna hurt their

[16:40] ability to sell the game because without a licensed theme if you have to go on gameplay alone and you

[16:47] have an original IP and it's this kind of climate where you can't bring the game to shows there are

[16:53] no Raza's at any bars in America there are no Raza's on location how do you sell the game like that

[17:00] is why they're limiting the number and they're limiting the sales window they're trying to create

[17:06] some sort of urgency some sort of FOMO around it but this is challenging like this is a really

[17:13] hard marketplace to sell in when you're going up against alien against guns and roses against

[17:19] Led Zeppelin I mean a lot of these themes right now are take my money now kinds of themes and so

[17:26] it's it's gonna be brutal if your product doesn't emotionally grab people or do something really

[17:31] special or unique how do you get people to go in on it so we don't know how this story ends we're

[17:37] gonna see but I know this Led Zeppelin is sold out they didn't even show you the game yet it's sold

[17:42] you can't get one good luck go call your distributor right now after listening to Canada's

[17:47] Pimball podcast and they're gonna tell you what I told you right now can't help you can't help you

[17:51] I'll put you on the wait list but we think it's sold out I want to end episode 540 by just saying

[17:56] thank you to everyone for tuning into Canada's Pimball podcast you know I've been listening to all the

[18:00] other podcasts that have been out there and for some reason you know there's a lot of looking back

[18:04] on where we've come from how podcasters work competitive how people were saying this and saying that

[18:10] a lot of stuff has happened but I want to say isn't it all just in the past by now having

[18:16] we all moved on and now we're at a point now where there are so many pinball companies there are so

[18:21] many new people getting into pinball there are so many options out there not just from a media

[18:26] standpoint from a game standpoint from a manufacturing standpoint and I do implore everybody out there

[18:32] to just let's have fun I know I know it sounds like people still want to hold me accountable from

[18:39] shows of the past but let's have fun let's enjoy what's going on in this hobby and let's critique

[18:44] the games that is why you listen to a pinball podcast to critique the actual pinball games to critique

[18:51] the accessories and critique the companies that are making these things I don't care I'm so tired

[18:57] of hearing about people of critiquing the people making the content about pinball like stop we all

[19:03] can we just stop can we just say as of today we're all going to stop pretending as if the people

[19:09] who talk about pinball are interesting we're not it's the games that are interesting it's these

[19:15] companies that are interesting it's these designers that are interesting okay everybody episode

[19:19] 540 we are going to be back on the airwaves tomorrow giving our opinions about lead Zeppelin

[19:24] pinball we will obviously be on the airwaves giving our opinions about alien pinball as well I want

[19:30] to let you know too that I interviewed this incredible man who made sonic spin ball pinball I am

[19:35] going to air that interview next week I told him I didn't want to air it now because all of the

[19:40] news is going to be around these new titles but Ryan McQuade he made sonic pinball are you sitting

[19:46] down he made this incredible game in less than a year and we talked to him about how he did that

[19:53] we talked to him about Jpop and what it's like seeing someone take seven years without getting a

[19:58] game out and we go through the deep route home brew offering and I wanted to ask him a guy who's

[20:05] made a home brew game if that's enticing for him to be a part of so it's a really great interview it'll

[20:11] air next week Ryan thank you for joining the show anything else going on is it twippy season yet

[20:15] yeah it's coming up in January now don't forget if you vote it in the drop down stuff that's not

[20:22] your final vote you have to vote again in January okay just don't forget that because sometimes

[20:27] people get confused it's not confusing but people get confused everybody have a great day I

[20:33] can't wait to see Steve Richie's new game tomorrow later

[20:58] bye

[20:59] oh

[21:16] but
