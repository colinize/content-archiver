[00:00] Not nothing on heaven's go off, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

[00:18] Welcome, welcome, welcome to episode 35 of Canata's Pinball Podcast and

[00:26] I want to sort of start out this podcast first of all by just thanking everyone out there

[00:33] who's listened to this show.

[00:35] I was just looking at my numbers on SoundCloud and we have reached over 30,000 lessons, which

[00:41] I think is incredible.

[00:43] I really, and I couldn't have done it without a lot of you coming back and listening to

[00:48] each episode and putting up with some of the crazy rants and some of the more provocative

[00:54] and out there themes we've tackled.

[00:56] But I hope you enjoy it.

[00:57] I hope you enjoy coming and listening to Kennedy's podcast.

[01:01] And we're going to keep going.

[01:02] And it's a lot of fun.

[01:03] It's a lot of fun to talk about this hobby.

[01:06] But I want to start out this evening's podcast on a sad note.

[01:12] And I think most of you heard today and it really sucks and I'm really bummed out.

[01:17] And this was a day where we all were looking forward to seeing Ghostbusters being played

[01:22] the Ellie for the first time.

[01:23] And that was sort of the thing I was really expecting to hear about today.

[01:28] And about gosh, around like one o'clock today, I got a text message from a friend and

[01:36] it just said Mike Chestnut passed away.

[01:41] And I was absolutely shocked and taken a back by that news.

[01:48] I know that all of us in the community have appreciated Mike's contributions to pinball.

[01:56] The man has done so much for this hobby.

[01:59] He's made so many people's pinball machines beautiful.

[02:02] He's such a nice guy.

[02:04] Corresponding with him has always been a real pleasure.

[02:07] And I finally had the opportunity to send Mike some parts to do for me.

[02:14] They're actually at his place now.

[02:15] I just feel so terrible.

[02:17] I don't really give a shit about the parts.

[02:19] We'll figure all that stuff out.

[02:21] He's got great people looking out for his family's well-being right now.

[02:26] I know Chris from Hot Rod Arcade sent a note explaining the situation and what to do and

[02:34] how to contact him if you had anything with Mike.

[02:38] It just sucks.

[02:39] It sucks.

[02:40] We all have sad, sad, sad hearts tonight knowing that Mike Chestnut is no longer a member

[02:47] of the community.

[02:48] I just wanted to take a few moments of silence just for everyone to say a prayer to his family

[02:54] and think about Mike.

[03:03] I remember when I first saw Mike's work on Pennside and it was when I had my Lord the Rings

[03:11] and it was always with such great pleasure and joy that people shared Mike's work with

[03:17] the rest of the people in the community.

[03:20] He really just made the games sing.

[03:26] His attention to detail in his work was just above and beyond the best.

[03:31] You don't get the kind of word of mouth accolades that he did without just creating an incredible

[03:37] product.

[03:39] I know he loved motorcycles and I've been reading the thread and it's just great seeing

[03:43] so many you share stories about Mike and I hope people continue to do that.

[03:47] I know he loved motorcycles and riding fast was something he enjoyed.

[03:53] He actually had a few, I was reading a couple of series accidentally.

[03:57] I saw one was back in 2011 where he injured his leg and his arm really bad and it just

[04:03] always seemed like he always wanted to get back on the bike and ride hard and he always

[04:07] said if he was going to go he was going to go on the motorcycle and it sucks and it's just

[04:12] terrible.

[04:13] I guess the only silver lining is he died doing what he loved and he died in the way that

[04:19] he wanted to go.

[04:21] I really think it's a dark cloud over the hobby today and I think for all those people

[04:27] who have parts with Mike and please give them time to heal and everyone will get their

[04:35] stuff sorted out and there's good people looking after this stuff.

[04:39] I know that having stuff out of the game and over there he's got people and pickles and

[04:45] whatnot but just give it some time.

[04:47] We're going to get everyone's parts back to them and he's got really good people helping

[04:53] figure this stuff out.

[04:54] Again, just thoughts and prayers with Mike's family tonight and all the friends and family

[04:59] who loved Mike and new Mike and hate to hear news like this.

[05:04] Just never want to hear anything bad happen to anyone in the community no matter who they

[05:07] are.

[05:08] Our thoughts and prayers grow out to Mike and his family.

[05:11] Alright, so let's switch gears and talk about ghost busters and what we saw today.

[05:17] With the first ever sort of world premiere footage, gameplay footage of the Ellie of

[05:24] Ghostbusters.

[05:25] You know, it's just a correct to me.

[05:26] We really haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment.

[05:29] I blame myself.

[05:30] So do I.

[05:31] I don't know since worrying about it now.

[05:34] Why worry?

[05:35] Each of us is worrying and unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.

[05:38] Well, I think we can all just relax now and I say that because the last couple weeks

[05:46] of Pinside and the conversation around Ghostbusters has been nothing but people complaining and

[05:54] moaning and speculating about this pinball machine and I get it.

[05:59] Like the pro plays really hard and there's a lot of drains and people are really worried

[06:04] about how the pin was going to be.

[06:06] And I think all of people's concerns for the most part are going to be silence when they

[06:11] watch the video footage of dead flip playing Ghostbusters Ellie.

[06:17] That happened tonight.

[06:18] And it started at six o'clock for me.

[06:22] It was 5 p.m. Central time in Chicago and we had Jody there.

[06:27] We had Jack Danger.

[06:28] We had John Trudeau and I think it was Dwight was there as well playing Ghostbusters on Twitch.

[06:35] And it was great to finally see the game being played and it just seemed I'm trying to

[06:45] just break it down and how I want to talk about the pin.

[06:47] I think the first thing is the game just seems like a ton of fun and I think more than anything.

[06:53] Theme is so important.

[06:55] Everyone is attracted to the Ghostbusters theme.

[06:57] We all want this pin to be great.

[06:59] I don't think I've ever seen a pin that so many people universally just want to be great.

[07:05] So the theme is something we're rooting for.

[07:07] The artwork is great.

[07:09] The cabinets, great the play fields, great the toys are great.

[07:12] So the only thing that was really left and I call this in my special edition last was

[07:17] is the game too much of a drain monster.

[07:20] Is that going to be the Achilles heel of the pinball machine?

[07:22] And I think what we saw today showed no it's not.

[07:26] This game looks like a ton of fun and the Magnuslings are great.

[07:31] They really are great.

[07:34] They're so much fun.

[07:36] I say fun again because it's just so cool to see a pinball machine do something different.

[07:41] And you could see when Jack and team were playing it today when those Magnuslings grabbed

[07:46] the ball and sort of throw it around in that magnetic way.

[07:50] It's so cool.

[07:51] And yes, there are times when it looks like it acts like a regular sling.

[07:55] So for the most part, the way the ball engages with the slings seems to cut down a lot on

[08:01] the outland draining that people were experiencing with the regular slings.

[08:06] And I think it just goes to show that this pinball machine was designed first and foremost

[08:10] to have those magnetic slings in there.

[08:13] So by putting the traditional slings and I think it actually makes the game a lot harder.

[08:18] So I think people are really happy to see that the magnetic slings are going to enhance

[08:23] the play of the game.

[08:24] They're going to make the game more fun.

[08:26] They're going to make the game less draining.

[08:29] And so it's just like, I think there's just like a big sigh of relief from so many people.

[08:36] Because I also don't think I've seen a pinball machine where so many people are already in

[08:42] on it when it comes to a stern pinball machine.

[08:45] And by that, I mean, people have committed to buying it.

[08:48] They've also defended it without even playing it.

[08:52] And so this was a moment where I think people's fears were alleviated and I think their expectations

[09:01] were met.

[09:02] And I'm really happy about that because I think it would have sucked if we saw a video

[09:06] today and it looked like the gameplay was bad or that magnetic slings weren't working.

[09:12] So really cool, really awesome to see the video today.

[09:16] I think this game is just going to be a home run.

[09:20] The L.E.'s are sold out.

[09:21] It looks like they're going to go on the line soon.

[09:23] I know they are for a fact because I'm in on an L.E.

[09:26] I think I've said this many times or haven't said it, but I've alluded to it.

[09:31] I'm in on an L.E.

[09:33] I'm getting it from Trent at a tilt of musements.

[09:38] And I was asked today for the remainder of my deposit.

[09:42] So he said it's going to be any week now.

[09:46] So that is great news.

[09:49] So some of the things that I did, there was funny about watching on DeadFlip.

[09:54] So there was a whole bunch of people impersonating me on the DeadFlip channel on Twitch.

[10:02] Someone had, so let me just clarify for people, if I'm ever watching something on Twitch,

[10:08] my handle is Canada23.

[10:10] Okay, it's not going to be Canada underscore pinball.

[10:13] It's not going to be the real Canada.

[10:16] It's not going to be all these different things.

[10:17] I did find it funny that there were so many impersonators, which even got the jack

[10:23] and jody and all those guys talking about Canada on there.

[10:28] It always makes me laugh because everyone always says that I'm just like an attention

[10:32] who wants attention.

[10:33] And yet here all these people are just giving me the attention.

[10:36] So thank you for it.

[10:38] I appreciate it.

[10:39] You're just letting more people know about Canada's pinball podcast.

[10:44] I'll say though about the Twitch channel and watching these reveals.

[10:49] And I don't know if you guys feel this way, but hit me up if you do at canadapimballadgmail.com.

[10:56] But I do wish when we have these like first reveal playfield footage or game play footage

[11:02] of machines that they would sort of break it up a little bit more in terms of how they

[11:09] show the game.

[11:11] I don't really need to see four guys play the machine for an hour straight.

[11:15] I don't know about you guys, but it just gets a little long winded.

[11:20] And I think what there's on every game, there's like certain things we want to see.

[11:26] So I mean, I would love to see them play it organically for like a half hour.

[11:29] And then I would love to see them take the glass off and show us different things.

[11:35] Whether it's, you know, activating certain modes so we can see how they work or moving

[11:39] the camera so that we can see the ectogoggles or positioning the camera differently so we

[11:44] can see slimer more of like a walkthrough of the pen.

[11:47] Right?

[11:48] And then you can time it out.

[11:49] You'd be like in the first half hour, it's going to be game play.

[11:51] And then from, you know, 30, from the 30th minute to the 35th minute, we're going to walk

[11:56] around the cabinet.

[11:58] And then we're going to do this at this minute.

[11:59] I mean, it's not really that hard to do that.

[12:01] And I think it would just make it a little bit more interesting because I do think watching

[12:05] people just play pinball over and over again gets pretty repetitive and boring.

[12:13] Okay?

[12:14] Now what makes the flip channel fun though and the dead flip channel and the Twitch channel

[12:17] fun is just the commentary and listening to these guys respond.

[12:21] I love Jody too because Jody is my favorite.

[12:24] Like Jack's trying to like make everyone just get along and Jody like is like battling

[12:28] and out with these trolls.

[12:30] And it's just really funny to see the different dynamic going on.

[12:36] But thank you Stern for doing it.

[12:38] I really appreciate it.

[12:39] I think everyone appreciates it.

[12:41] I think Stern goes out of their way consistently to give the fans what they want.

[12:47] And they do it and they do it and they do it well.

[12:49] And I think Jack is a great person as well.

[12:51] I want to thank Jack Danger.

[12:53] I think he's one of the greatest personalities in pinball.

[12:56] I love that he stays above the fray.

[12:58] He doesn't get mixed up in all the non-sister and all the drama.

[13:01] And he goes out there and he plays pinball and he has fun.

[13:05] He's a great personality for this hobby.

[13:07] And I think he's a great, just the image of Jack Danger and what he brings.

[13:12] I think he brings more people into pinball and I'll leave it at that.

[13:17] And so it's a great day.

[13:19] I think people who are in on L.E.s are super excited.

[13:21] I saw that one actually went up for sale.

[13:24] Going back to other pre-order and it's for sale on pinside.

[13:28] Go run it's at $8,750 I think it was, which is more than most distributors are selling

[13:37] it for but they're sold out.

[13:39] So we'll see if it goes at that price.

[13:42] Interested to see how long that lasts.

[13:44] But I think this is a great day and I think people are in on the premium and the L.E.s are

[13:48] going to sleep very well tonight.

[13:50] And I think people are going to be very happy with this game.

[13:52] I think some people have said it but this is going to be, I believe, when it turns big

[13:58] as pinball machines ever.

[14:00] And I think this game is, as some are saying, is like kind of like the next Adam's family

[14:04] in terms of theme, integration, toys, how fun it is.

[14:08] That's yet to be seen yet but from what we're getting so far with the sounds are amazing,

[14:13] the art, everything.

[14:14] I think this game is going to be the home run that everyone expected it to be.

[14:19] So congratulations, Stern.

[14:21] And I look forward to playing in L.E. very soon.

[14:24] This is what happens.

[14:25] When you fuck a stranger in the ass.

[14:27] All right.

[14:28] Well, Big Lebowski, the three Big Lebowski machines that were put in boxes have gone out.

[14:35] They've shipped.

[14:36] It seems that two of them have arrived and have been set up.

[14:40] And so, it's interesting to see what people's, the first owner's feedback has been.

[14:47] I know that the biggest sort of responses have been coming from PDX Monkey who has set

[14:55] his up.

[14:56] And it just, I don't know.

[14:59] There's just something about these threads that the game just still feels incomplete.

[15:05] And the game's still beautiful.

[15:10] There's a lot to like about what Dutch has put into this pinball machine.

[15:14] But there's just a few things that I'm just still scratching my head about.

[15:18] And we've said this a few times.

[15:19] But how is it that after two years of being in development that this game ships with

[15:27] code that is so incomplete?

[15:29] I'm just, I just don't get it.

[15:32] How it's the code number is like 0.42.

[15:37] That it came out with.

[15:39] What have they been doing the last year?

[15:41] I mean, I get that Roger Sharp is working on licensing.

[15:46] But how is it that in 365 days have gone on and the code is still so incomplete?

[15:55] I'm just perplexed.

[15:56] And I think it's, I think Dutch really made a mistake here.

[16:01] And I'll tell you why.

[16:02] Because if you're going to come out and you're going to charge $10,000 for a machine,

[16:06] we haven't even really said this.

[16:08] But this is the most expensive new-in-box pinball machine of all time.

[16:13] Has any other new-in-box pinball machine that came from a factory sold for this amount

[16:19] in the year it was produced?

[16:21] I'm not talking about some cactus canyon or older pin that was kept new in box for 20

[16:27] years.

[16:28] And then it sold for a lot.

[16:29] I'm talking brand new game, 10 grand.

[16:33] How can you release a brand new game at $10,000 and not have the code further along?

[16:38] I just think it's silly.

[16:40] I think these guys, and they're only making one game.

[16:43] You can't tell me Dutch is working on games 2 and 3.

[16:47] What have they been working on?

[16:48] What's the programmer been working on?

[16:50] For all you guys who give Stern shits, Ghostbusters is shipping with code that is far more complete

[16:57] than the Big Lebowski.

[16:58] And Stern's been working on, what do they got eight, nine titles on the line right now?

[17:03] Stern's probably got four or five pins being worked on in terms of development.

[17:10] And these guys are focused on one singular title and they can't get the code further along.

[17:14] I just think it's embarrassing.

[17:15] I think it's also a shame because now that they're shipping, you look at the threads and

[17:19] they're just like, not much, not much.

[17:23] And these new pinball companies, I think they're all just sort of getting it wrong.

[17:29] If you're going to be the best Dutch and you're going to then ship with complete code,

[17:33] complete, complete.

[17:35] You had two years to get it done, two years.

[17:39] So now it's going to happen.

[17:40] They're going to ship these machines and people have to wait another year, year and a half

[17:43] to get it completed.

[17:45] I don't know why it takes so long.

[17:46] Can someone explain that to me?

[17:48] Can you email me at canadapimballatgmail.com how after two years of reveal the code in this

[17:54] pinball machine is not further along?

[17:56] What could take so long?

[17:57] My only guess is they haven't been paying a programmer to do it.

[18:03] That's my only guess.

[18:05] So that's the big Lebowski.

[18:07] Let's see when the other ones go out as well, too.

[18:08] I think that's the big moment of really being in development is when more than a few go

[18:16] out because the three in a box, if they only built three, these are still like beta production

[18:24] kind of ways to build it.

[18:26] These can't be on the factory line, everything's ready to go because then there'll be more

[18:30] than three built.

[18:33] And I saw someone said, too, in the thread that they were planning to build 80 a month

[18:37] but they moved to a larger factory so they're going to plan to build even more than that

[18:42] a month.

[18:43] Are you guys really serious?

[18:45] Are you smoking something?

[18:47] Do you really think they're going to be able to sell upwards of 100 or more a month at

[18:52] $10,000 a pop?

[18:54] I don't know, we're going to have to see.

[18:57] They're definitely not going to be selling and people are not going to be having orders

[19:00] fly in if the code's incomplete.

[19:03] That's why again, I think it's a mistake.

[19:04] I think they need to get orders coming in and people are not going to be glowing about

[19:08] this game with incomplete code.

[19:11] And I'm going to call it now.

[19:12] There's something called the Ghostbusters Effect that is going to fuck up everyone's plans.

[19:18] Ghostbusters coming out, being what it is, being how good it is, being how excited people

[19:22] are about it is going to, that is where the money is going to go.

[19:27] You, I called it earlier on, I called it earlier on in the year.

[19:30] They said, look, with those six to eight new pinball machines coming out this year, there

[19:34] is no way they're all going to be successful and there's no way they're all going to sell

[19:37] them the numbers that they would up.

[19:39] Imagine if Big Lebowski came out two years ago, right?

[19:42] Two years before Ghostbusters.

[19:44] Think about that.

[19:45] It would have sold like hot cakes.

[19:47] Same thing with Hobbit.

[19:48] If Hobbit came out when an originally plan to come out, they would be flying off the

[19:52] shelves.

[19:53] More orders would be flying in.

[19:54] But you can't tell me that money is not being diverted into Ghostbusters.

[19:59] Like nothing else.

[20:01] And that people are now sort of waiting to see because I think Ghostbusters has a ripple

[20:06] effect because people are going to wait to see, wait a minute.

[20:09] This is amazing.

[20:10] Stern is up the Annie so much.

[20:13] And rumors are true.

[20:15] Star Wars LCD in November.

[20:17] You might as well just hold on to your money versus going after a Lebowski and a Hobbit

[20:22] with incomplete code.

[20:23] And might as well just wait those out and see what happens.

[20:26] And pick up, pick them up later down the line.

[20:29] So I think that Ghostbusters effect is really going to fuck over a lot of these companies

[20:33] that waited too long to bring their pins out.

[20:36] All right.

[20:37] Have you guys heard the mini-ville madness remake conversation going on?

[20:41] It sounds a lot like this.

[20:44] You're just stalling now.

[20:45] You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

[20:48] You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong.

[20:51] So you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save

[20:54] you.

[20:55] You might not choose the wine in front of you.

[20:57] But you've also bested by Spaniard, which means you must have studied.

[21:01] And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison

[21:05] as far from yourself as possible so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.

[21:10] You're trying to trick me into giving away something.

[21:12] One word.

[21:13] It has worked.

[21:14] You've given everything away.

[21:15] I know where the poison is.

[21:17] Then they can choice.

[21:18] I will.

[21:19] And I choose what in the world can that be?

[21:22] What?

[21:23] It's the medieval madness insert issue.

[21:26] This is like the issue that just won't die.

[21:29] And I think this sucks too, because this was another pin that just people were so excited

[21:36] for.

[21:37] And it was an opportunity to get medieval madness at a much better rate and cost and get it

[21:43] brand new and have new technology and colored dots and all these things.

[21:47] And look, in the end, this all might work out for people.

[21:50] But what sucks is the insert issue just won't die.

[21:53] And if you go to the medieval madness thread, you still are seeing people get medieval madness

[21:57] to ship to them with poorly ink screened play fields where the text on the shields is

[22:09] transparent when there's light behind it.

[22:12] And I know they had a saw of a light diffuser kit that they were sending out to people that

[22:17] sort of minimized the issue.

[22:20] But here is what it seems like the takeaway is.

[22:24] And it's that certain people, when they first got their medieval madness remakes, didn't

[22:30] have this issue at all.

[22:31] So it seems to be a good batch of play fields that were printed out there.

[22:37] After that, something happened in the printing process that led to this issue that lots of

[22:43] people have been experiencing.

[22:45] Some have learned to live with the game and are okay with it.

[22:48] They don't really care.

[22:49] It's not that big of a deal.

[22:50] Others have put the diffuser kit in to help minimize the issue.

[22:56] I know they also offer sort of like inserts to go over the play field to cover up the

[23:04] problem as well.

[23:06] It sucks.

[23:07] It sucks because people who are in on this machine who haven't gotten their machine yet are

[23:10] all sort of just anxiously awaiting to see what their machine arrives like.

[23:15] Even though planetary pinball sort of said, look, this was just a small little incident

[23:20] that didn't affect most of them and they've corrected it.

[23:25] I don't think they have.

[23:26] And I think what people have said is accurate that all the play fields are printed.

[23:32] They're stockpiled somewhere.

[23:35] And if there was an issue with the printing, they're not going to go back and redo it.

[23:39] They're not.

[23:40] They can't afford to.

[23:41] As we all know, the margins for profit on these pens and these companies that are remaking

[23:47] stuff can't support a major part needing to be redone.

[23:56] So I think people are anxious.

[23:58] I think they're unhappy.

[23:59] And I think it spoiled the release of this game.

[24:03] It really has.

[24:05] The lay to get the game has been a real issue.

[24:07] Now people have waited all this time and the game is not arriving exactly how they wanted

[24:12] it to be.

[24:14] And if I were people and I was anxious and I wasn't sure, I would cancel my order.

[24:20] I really would.

[24:21] There's no point in spending this kind of money not being 100% happy with your purchase.

[24:27] And I know a company that is going to print a beautiful play field that won't have this

[24:32] issue on any of the inserts.

[24:35] Who are you going to call?

[24:36] Who are you going to call to get you that play field?

[24:39] So this issue, I really wish there was some sort of honesty that was going to come out

[24:44] of this in the very end.

[24:46] And I think people are being lied to.

[24:49] And I don't think they're being like directly lied to, but I think they're being told things

[24:53] that aren't completely accurate by the parties who are directly involved.

[25:00] And I think those parties are just in an impossible situation where what are they going to say

[25:07] that if they know they can't redo them all, they're going to have to sort of marketing

[25:12] spin this thing to get people to relax and not all cancel orders.

[25:17] But if I were you and I would just get out and wait, go buy one used from someone who

[25:24] definitely got one that didn't have an issue versus getting it and then being unhappy.

[25:30] And it is interesting that they're also selling the diffuser kit on their website.

[25:35] Like why are they selling it for money?

[25:37] That doesn't make any sense to me.

[25:40] If everyone is going to get one for free because of the issue, then why do they have to sell

[25:46] it unless they know that it is going to affect everyone moving forward.

[25:54] And I don't know, there's just something not right here.

[25:58] Nothing is really adding up.

[25:59] So I feel bad for a medieval man as remake guys.

[26:01] I think some of you are really enjoying the game and that's great, but I think a lot

[26:05] of you are anxious and I think it's sort of this thing is sort of commanding gates in

[26:10] a pretty bad way.

[26:11] I think it's going to make it difficult for them to sell their second remake if an issue

[26:17] like this happens again.

[26:19] So let's see what happens, but this story just won't seem to die.

[26:32] Speaking of precious games and expensive games, the Hobbit has now been shipping for about

[26:41] a month I want to say.

[26:44] We're getting around that time period.

[26:47] And it's great that it's finally out.

[26:48] It's great that people have waited so long to get this pin and Jersey Jack has established

[26:55] his company as a premium pinball manufacturer.

[26:58] And I don't think any would argue that the Wizard of Oz is a beautiful machine.

[27:05] It raised the bar from anything that Stern had available at the time and it really brought

[27:12] a top notch well built high quality pinball machine to the world.

[27:19] And even to this day I think was is stunning.

[27:22] It's stunning.

[27:23] You look at it with the Vaz and you're blown away by it.

[27:26] And it had those details though and it was the attention to details that I think elevated

[27:31] Jersey Jack pinball above the rest and really put them on the map and stuff like the wood

[27:37] apron.

[27:38] Absolutely gorgeous.

[27:40] Anything like that had been on a pinball machine before and looked that nice.

[27:44] Stuff like the direct print, the direct screened cabinets, the painting right on the cabinets

[27:51] was beautiful.

[27:52] It was beautiful.

[27:55] And I think people really were getting the biggest bargain of the century when Walsh first

[28:01] came out.

[28:02] Well was it 6,500 bucks people paid for it?

[28:04] And I've said this before but there's no way Jack could make a profit and 6,000 as a

[28:11] company selling Walsh for 6,500 and subsequently the price kept going up and up and up and

[28:16] something happened though when the Ruby Red version came out and it was a new LE the wood

[28:22] apron went away.

[28:24] So the price went up and Ruby Reds were $9,000 is an all of a sudden some of the material,

[28:31] some of those details that people really really really were attracted to and separated the

[28:37] JJP from the rest started to go away.

[28:40] We all know about the decals replacing the screening of the cabinets and I also don't

[28:50] believe that that was that that's the better way to go.

[28:54] I think everyone would rather have a direct screened cabinet versus decals.

[28:59] It doesn't mean you can't get nice like decals but it's just at the end of the day there's

[29:04] just something about having a directly painted to the wood especially in a home use only

[29:09] environment where it will stay beautiful for many many many many many years.

[29:16] So the hobbit is shipping and there's had there have been some early issues and some

[29:23] of the stuff you know again makes you wonder how much was this game tested that it's still

[29:29] having these issues.

[29:31] The wire form on the left side where the ball gets jammed that seems to be something that

[29:36] how is that not caught during any of the testing.

[29:40] People everyone's experienced this from the beta units to playing it at shows so games

[29:45] shipped with that as a flaw.

[29:48] Balls were getting stuck inside the pop ups.

[29:51] So I'm reading here that so Jack is telling people that there have been changes made to

[30:01] the machine and the latest I heard I want to read this this comes from Kong Husker out

[30:09] of Lincoln Nebraska.

[30:11] He said I just talked to Jack about all ramp wire form and pop up issues.

[30:16] He said all problems were on early production games and new games being built to have been

[30:21] addressed.

[30:22] Wire forms are now positioned differently and pop up mechs have been changed he said these

[30:28] are his words so it sounds like they addressed the issues moving forward early build game

[30:33] owners can contact distributors for needed upgrades basically.

[30:37] I feel more confident to buy knowing that now.

[30:41] Okay now this really begs the question do you or do you not believe Jack here.

[30:50] And in the past he has made comments about repairs to games and fixes for games that haven't

[31:00] exactly panned out to be accurate.

[31:04] So it sounds like they didn't really redesign the wire form they just moved where it was.

[31:14] So I'm not sure if that fix is going to solve the issue for good.

[31:20] We will see because ultimately people will put this in their pins and decide now new

[31:26] game shipping now.

[31:28] This is what's annoying because I think people now have no idea what is in there is when

[31:33] they get it soon.

[31:35] Are they able to date that the fixes are you know we're implemented into the game or

[31:40] do they have to now go to the distributor and get the fix.

[31:46] If you were to ask me what I really think is going to go on I think all those changes

[31:54] probably haven't gone into the machines that are on the line right now because that would

[31:59] require stopping the line and making changes which I don't think they can afford to do.

[32:03] I think that Jack is going to ship games and wait to see you know sort of just roll the

[32:10] dice and see hopefully most people won't have the problem because not all people are having

[32:14] the problems but as we as we know it doesn't matter if just 10% of people have issues with

[32:20] their games those are going to be the 10% that go on Pinside and Bich and Mone and make

[32:24] people nervous about placing orders.

[32:26] So we'll see what happens we'll see what happens.

[32:32] The other issue that I saw that was probably more concerning than these things I think these

[32:36] things are fixable but something else that's happening with JDP just speaks to the the

[32:43] decreasing quality and I say that is because I'm concerned that quality is really where Jack

[32:51] needs to just blow everyone away and I just saw some images that just really really sad to see

[33:00] and it was the decal on the back box of Hobbit was peeling off and it was peeling off right when

[33:08] people were taking their machines out of the box and a lot of people were just asking why are they

[33:12] even putting a decal on the back of the back box like can you just screen that it's just these

[33:21] kinds of things that is it how much can you really be saving by doing the decal over the print.

[33:29] So we'll see I think that JDP is set a standard with a machine that needs to warrant the price

[33:42] and they look beautiful. Waz was definitely problematic let's not floor ourselves and Waz is a

[33:48] quality pin in terms of materials use but those materials had a lot of issues and if Hobbit

[33:55] displays a lot of issues and you add in certain elements seem cheap and not worth $8,000

[34:02] dollars I think it's really really gonna hurt JDP and again the Ghostbusters effect is really really

[34:09] really going to make any issues or second guessing people have about other pinball machines

[34:16] it's gonna make the money go to Stern so you have to be more on top of your game now than ever

[34:22] before if you want people to go in on your pen knowing what you can go get new inbox from Stern

[34:29] knowing that they will have distributors have people to help have are more likely to sort of jump

[34:35] in and give you like a fix. So let's see what happens I think that only time is gonna tell and I

[34:44] don't think we can I think Jack's actions need to speak louder than his words and I think we'd

[34:48] all agree with that. Alright well that seems to be the topics I wanted to discuss on episode 35

[34:56] of Canadian pinball podcast a little reminder to those of you that I will be at Alan Town this weekend
