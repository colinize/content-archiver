[00:08] the fair princess from the clutches of an evil dragon.

[00:16] Ah, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast, the only pinball podcast where Jack Danger's

[00:20] not allowed to join the show.

[00:22] Everybody, I want to give a shout out to our latest club members.

[00:26] We are at 480, it keeps growing, Ted, JR Pinball, and Phillip, welcome to the party.

[00:34] So here's what I want to do on this episode.

[00:35] I want to talk a little bit about Deeproot.

[00:38] We talked to Steven.

[00:39] We got a lot of really good information from him.

[00:41] There's been a lot of information being given to everybody from Blueberry Johnson over on

[00:46] the Pinball show with Zach Many.

[00:48] I want to just give my thoughts on Deeproot and where we go from here.

[00:52] I want to talk about, as you heard in the intro, Dragon's Lair Kickstarter, and how

[00:57] I think this is the stupidest idea you could possibly do is to fund a pinball kickstarter,

[01:06] and then just a couple things going on in the pinball world with the different manufacturers

[01:09] that are out there.

[01:10] How does that sound for an episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast on a Wednesday?

[01:14] Are you getting your money's worth, people?

[01:16] You bet you're getting your money's worth.

[01:17] All right.

[01:18] Let's start with Dragon's Lair Pinball, and I think there are two main reasons why I think

[01:23] a kickstarter around this theme is absolutely stupid.

[01:28] I'll tell you why.

[01:29] Reason number one is I think Dragon's Lair is a horrible theme for a pinball machine.

[01:33] I'm going to explain why.

[01:35] And the other reason is 99.99% of pinball kickstarters have failed.

[01:41] So you just know you're going to lose your money, and we all know by now, going from

[01:46] a prototype game to being able to manufacture a pinball machine is next to impossible.

[01:53] But this one's even easier to call dead on arrival simply because the person who's making

[01:58] this game, and it's somewhere I think overseas is making this game, the person making this

[02:03] game has already lied to the community.

[02:06] They said they have the license to make the game, and that bit of information is crucial

[02:12] because we all saw what happened with Kevin Kulik and with Predator, and when you don't

[02:16] have the license, it's real simple.

[02:18] You don't have permission to make the game.

[02:20] And I want to give a shout out to pinside member Trey Bo 69 because he reached out to

[02:26] the license holder of Dragon's Lair, and I want to read the response from the license

[02:32] holder.

[02:33] They said, thanks for reaching out.

[02:35] The person you mentioned has reached out to Digital Leisure and Dragon's Lair LLC, the

[02:41] licensing arm for all things DragonLayer, but has yet to secure any license.

[02:48] They have simply presented their ideas for the project, but nothing firm has been agreed

[02:54] to.

[02:55] I have forwarded your email to the DLLLC as they will be direct point of contact for

[03:01] such a project and will follow up with the individual posting to the Facebook group.

[03:06] Thanks for the details, best regards, Paul Gold over at Digital Leisure.

[03:11] So there you go.

[03:12] The guy is looking to raise money to make a game that he does not have permission to

[03:16] make.

[03:17] And look, everyone is cool with boutique people making a one of one licensed version of a

[03:22] game.

[03:23] We all love seeing the Nightmare Before Christmas or the Airplane game, Sonic the Hedgehog Pinball.

[03:29] There's many more people out there that are making these games because they love the property.

[03:34] Now going from that to a manufacturer capable of getting people games they paid for, it's

[03:40] never worked out.

[03:41] We've seen this fail time and time again.

[03:43] Now the other reason I think this is absolutely a name and asinine is this.

[03:47] I think Dragon's Lair is an absolute horrible theme for a pinball machine and here's why.

[03:53] It was absolutely a horrible arcade machine.

[03:58] Look, I grew up in the 80s and 90s and the best thing about Dragon's Lair was the intro

[04:03] to the game.

[04:04] Like you would walk by it and you would hear that introduction.

[04:07] You would see like this cartoon that seemingly felt like you could play the cartoon and then

[04:13] you jump on the machine itself and it is probably one of the worst gameplays in the history

[04:20] of arcades.

[04:22] Like you realize real quick the whole thing is just about memorizing which way to move

[04:26] the joystick and that's it and then you get to see more of the cartoon play out and that's

[04:31] it.

[04:32] It's a laser disc game and it's bad.

[04:34] It's really bad.

[04:35] Now look, it was still one of the coolest machines back in the day in the arcade.

[04:39] For some reason, like that intro that I just played, you always heard it over all the other

[04:45] games.

[04:46] It just pulled you in, audio and visually pulled you into the experience and then it was horrible.

[04:51] Now let me ask you a question.

[04:53] How would this make sense as a pinball machine?

[04:55] The entire Dragon Slayer game is all about watching the cartoon take place.

[05:02] Now a static pinball machine artwork package would not do this game justice.

[05:06] This game itself was all about like moving the joystick in the right direction to see

[05:10] more video.

[05:12] But pinball is not good at showing you more video.

[05:15] But then I was like, look, this is bad for like a static artwork pinball machine.

[05:19] But then I was like, you know what?

[05:21] There is only one platform.

[05:23] There is only one pinball platform where Dragon Slayer actually makes maybe perfect sense.

[05:30] And that is the multi-morphic P3 people.

[05:33] I mean, think about it.

[05:34] Jerry has the screen as the play field.

[05:38] The way he could do it is those drop bank targets.

[05:41] Like all of them could be red, but one is green and you have to get like one shot to

[05:45] hit the green one to move Dirk onto his next adventure.

[05:49] So I was like, well, wait a minute.

[05:51] If there's anyone who should be making Dragon Slayer pinball, it's multi-morphic.

[05:55] And that is a great next theme for Jerry over at P3.

[05:59] Now Jerry, I just gave you this for free and clearly this guy doesn't have the license.

[06:03] So how about taking some of that weird out pre-order money, calling these guys up and

[06:09] securing the Dragon Slayer license for the multi-morphic?

[06:13] I think it makes perfect sense.

[06:15] What do you think?

[06:16] Hit me up in the comments people.

[06:17] But let's face it, nobody is dumb enough now to give money towards a pinball Kickstarter.

[06:22] And we don't need another pinball company.

[06:24] I mean it when I say it, people.

[06:26] We don't need more pinball companies.

[06:29] I was talking to a friend offline and I'll just tell you right now what I said.

[06:32] I don't think we really need many more companies other than Stern, CGC, and Jersey Jack.

[06:39] I mean it when I say it.

[06:41] Those three companies, when they have all of their manufacturing going and they can get

[06:46] out like hundreds of games a week or a month.

[06:49] We don't need more.

[06:50] Right?

[06:51] Think about it.

[06:52] Those three companies arguably make the best pinball machines and they make the greatest

[06:56] games in pinball and they keep making new games every year.

[06:59] Stern makes like three to four new games every year.

[07:01] Jersey Jack every 18 months.

[07:03] CGC like every three years.

[07:05] But when they're all firing, those three companies are all we need.

[07:09] Now it would be nice to have a dark horse like an American pinball actually figure it

[07:14] out for once and add something to the mix.

[07:17] It would also be nice if spooky pinball could mature and actually make a game worthy of what

[07:24] they're charging.

[07:25] Like they've been around a decade now and there's just no more excuses for spooky games

[07:30] not being at least at the level of a Stern pro.

[07:34] Ding, ding, ding.

[07:35] They need to hire more people to get there.

[07:37] But you know what I'm saying?

[07:38] Like those top three.

[07:40] Like if you had Stern making three games a year and Jersey Jack with one game a year

[07:44] and CGC with one new game a year, you would have five amazing pinball machines to choose

[07:50] from five.

[07:51] Now that's enough in my book.

[07:53] How many of you want to buy more than five machines a year?

[07:56] Now I know we love having all these options but the truth is this.

[08:00] Even though there's like eight or nine pinball companies right now that are claiming to be

[08:04] pinball manufacturers, how many of them are really executing?

[08:09] How many of them have been efficient?

[08:11] How many of them have made pinball games that are great?

[08:15] Right?

[08:16] What's the point?

[08:17] There are so many great pinball machines that have already been made and those games keep

[08:23] going up in value.

[08:24] And I'm going to say it.

[08:25] A great game is a great game.

[08:28] Wait for it forever.

[08:31] It doesn't stop being great.

[08:34] It's like a great movie.

[08:36] It becomes a classic.

[08:38] And I've said this and I'll say it again.

[08:40] I think the biggest letdown of all these modern boutique companies is that none of them have

[08:46] made a game that any of us would consider an amazing classic game that people will enjoy

[08:54] years and years and years from now.

[08:56] Right?

[08:57] All these companies that have thrown their hat into the ring.

[09:00] How many of us look at their games fondly?

[09:03] How many games in the top like 20 are from these boutiques?

[09:06] Now to sneak their way in, we've got Big Lebowski and we've got Alien.

[09:10] But we both know the story on these companies.

[09:12] Like right, it's like these games are both like six, seven years old and they're still

[09:18] making these same games.

[09:19] Imagine if Stern made one game seven years ago, failed to get those games to people who

[09:26] paid for them, which is both of these companies and then never made another game.

[09:31] All of you would be at a pinball, right?

[09:33] Think about it.

[09:34] How boring would this hobby be if Stern operated like these companies and I've said it before

[09:39] and I'll say it again, these companies are just failures.

[09:41] They're failures.

[09:43] This is not successful business.

[09:45] No way that pinball brothers or Dutch pinball is making any money.

[09:50] The only company that's made money in the boutique space is Spooky Pinball and they've

[09:54] done it right within their world.

[09:56] I would argue that the games could be better.

[09:58] They need to be better.

[09:59] But look, they've done it the right way for a small startup and I will always give them

[10:04] credit for that.

[10:05] Do I think the games are great?

[10:06] You know, Rick and Morty is their best game, but arguably as a shooter, I'm not the biggest

[10:11] fan.

[10:12] So just to put a bow on this, we don't need dragons, lair, kickstarter, pinball.

[10:17] All right, let's stick with boutiques for a minute.

[10:19] So Haggis Pinball, still no pictures, still no update.

[10:24] Here's the part I don't understand.

[10:25] I was listening to the pinball show and one of their correspondents said that they traveled

[10:31] over to Haggis Pinball and they saw a production happening with Fathom Pinball and I was like,

[10:37] well, that's great.

[10:38] But then I'm like, why can't Damien and Marty show other people the progress that this person

[10:45] apparently saw?

[10:47] And I don't know why this continues to be a secret.

[10:51] You gave them your money a year ago.

[10:54] Some of you have paid in full and when you paid in full, what Damien told you was that

[10:59] your game was going into final testing in April.

[11:04] He's only got like nine or 10 days left, even less if you count the weekends to put these

[11:09] April games into testing.

[11:11] Now look, this month I think is going to be a wash for Haggis Pinball.

[11:16] May is really the date in which he's promised people games will start shipping.

[11:20] So if it happens in May, great, you know, we've been waiting a year for this.

[11:25] If it doesn't happen in May, I think you're going to start to see a lot of people get

[11:31] really anxious and demand answers.

[11:35] It must be a really difficult time for Damien and Marty to get sleep, to figure this thing

[11:41] out.

[11:42] I'm worried about the golden screw.

[11:45] And if you know what the golden screw is, it's the one item that you need to finish

[11:50] the game and without it, you can't make the game.

[11:54] Do they have every single part they need in-house?

[11:59] Because as we know, a game cannot go to a customer unless it's 100%.

[12:06] Everything is there in the build.

[12:08] You know, I learned a lesson this weekend with my demon when I went to go start it up.

[12:12] The battery died.

[12:14] And just that one item.

[12:16] That $1,200 item absolutely bricked and made useless my 840 horsepower muscle car.

[12:25] And pinball building is a lot like that without one item.

[12:29] And it could be something as simple as a gate or as a rail, as a, as coil stops, whatever

[12:36] it is, it could be anything.

[12:37] You could just, it could be lockdown bars, whatever it is, it could just be one item.

[12:43] And without it, we can't make the game.

[12:45] Now something interesting is happening in the Haggis sort of world.

[12:49] Someone out there bought four pre-order spots and that person is selling a pre-order spot.

[12:56] I think they sold it for like a $1,500 profit.

[13:00] And when they listed it for sale, they said that this was a sale through Haggis.

[13:05] So Damien is allowing him to sell his spot and transfer the new owner to the person who

[13:12] paid more than $2,000 for the spot.

[13:16] Now I have a friend of the show who is also trying to get rid of his spot.

[13:21] And months ago he emailed Damien.

[13:23] I have the entire email correspondence and he asked for a refund.

[13:28] And Damien said to him, I think there's someone on the waiting list and if they confirm they

[13:34] want it, I will transfer your spot to them and I will give you your $2,000 back.

[13:40] Now that was a few months ago and every week I check in with this individual and I ask,

[13:46] have you got your refund yet?

[13:48] So Damien was like, we found someone new and we're just waiting for the transfer to come

[13:53] through.

[13:54] I'll double check and this and that.

[13:55] Okay, so look, I hope all this works out.

[13:58] This is where I get nervous.

[14:00] I saw this before with Andrew Highway, this whole, you sell your spot to someone else.

[14:05] So Damien's got $2,000 coming in from someone new and then you're not immediately getting

[14:11] refunded.

[14:13] And it's all about waiting for the wire transfer to come through.

[14:16] Look wire transfers, when you do bank transfers, it only takes usually 48 hours.

[14:21] So hopefully I'm going to keep on this.

[14:23] I'm going to ask my friend if he got his refund yet.

[14:26] This isn't something that should take longer than a week.

[14:29] So we will stay on top of it.

[14:30] And I also talked to the person who had the four pre-order spots.

[14:34] I'm like, why do you have four?

[14:35] And believe me, he bought them solely to flip them.

[14:38] And what he bought wasn't for from Haggis.

[14:41] He bought his four from people who got in right away and then wanted to get out.

[14:47] So he bought other people's spots.

[14:50] All of this right now is trading on speculation.

[14:53] I think the real risky thing is the person who bought the pre-order spot for $1,500 more.

[14:59] Now look, if Damien can get games on the line next month and Fathom starts shipping,

[15:04] then yes, I think you will see confidence skyrocket.

[15:09] I think you will see people be able to sell their spots without trouble.

[15:14] I think people will make $1,500, $2,000 on a pre-order spot if this company can pull it off.

[15:23] You know, that's all people want to see, right?

[15:24] It's like Deeproot could have pulled it off if they actually made games and people would

[15:28] have been fighting for a Raza spot if there were only like 127 made.

[15:33] But when you see no games being made, there is no way someone's going to take your pre-order

[15:38] spot off your hands.

[15:39] So look, it's going to be a very interesting five weeks for Haggis Pinball.

[15:44] The next five weeks for Haggis Pinball will either be a great period for them in which

[15:49] they will show the world they got it done and they're getting games out the door, or

[15:54] it's going to be a brutal period for them in which people will be coming after them

[15:59] with Pitchforks because they've missed another deadline and they promise people games would

[16:05] start shipping in May and this would be really upsetting to people who paid in full that they're

[16:10] once again not getting their game.

[16:13] Alright, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[16:15] Well you know, like not a ton of stuff is going on.

[16:18] Let me talk about Deeproot real quick.

[16:20] So it was great talking to Steven and hearing once again from someone who actually worked

[16:25] at Deeproot.

[16:27] Lots of good information.

[16:28] I think you guys loved that interview and I want to say something and I'm going to trademark

[16:33] this phrase.

[16:34] Pinball is artwork.

[16:36] Artwork is not pinball and that is the canada phrase of 2022 other than never by a non-refundable

[16:45] game again.

[16:46] But I want to restate that.

[16:48] Pinball is art but art is not pinball.

[16:51] You know one thing Steven said when he was talking about Merlin's arcade and showing

[16:56] up at TPF with a booth filled with Merlin's arcade artwork but no game.

[17:02] And I'm just over this whole approach.

[17:04] Like this was J-POP's approach.

[17:06] Just win them over with art and who cares if you know how to make the game.

[17:11] And that is what was happening over at Deeproot Pinball is all the creatives and all the designers

[17:17] were just tinkering for three years with 61 million dollars of stolen money and they

[17:24] were using that to pretend that they were a pinball company.

[17:28] They were a pinball design studio.

[17:32] They had no idea how to manufacture anything and that video of Robert trying to shove the

[17:39] play field back in the rotisserie play field that pulls out with the latches just goes

[17:44] to show you what a fool he was.

[17:47] Nobody.

[17:48] Nobody in the right mind who's trying to build a successful pinball company would say that

[17:54] that is a problem we need to solve.

[17:56] And it just goes to show what a jackass Robert Mueller was.

[18:00] He absolutely innovated in all the wrong areas.

[18:04] That thing was stupid.

[18:06] The pinbar was stupid.

[18:08] The pin pod was stupid.

[18:10] The floating back boxes stupid.

[18:13] Every single thing he brought to pinball that he thought was an innovation was actually

[18:18] dumb.

[18:19] And if these innovations were what people wanted in pinball we would see them from Stern

[18:25] Pinball from Jersey Jack from other companies out there that are successful.

[18:30] What he did was he created a million more problems than he solved with each of these

[18:36] dumb ideas.

[18:37] The man's a fool.

[18:38] Like he's a fool.

[18:39] He's a bully.

[18:41] He's a coward.

[18:42] I have empathy for a lot of people on this planet but I don't have empathy for that crook.

[18:47] And so yes a lot of people joined up with Robert Mueller or Bobby Mueller as I like to

[18:52] say because they wanted a paycheck.

[18:55] That's all it was.

[18:56] All of these guys needed the money.

[18:58] And even when I hear them now you know they try to talk about what they worked on with

[19:03] some pride in this net and I'm sure you know Stephen put all he could into his projects

[19:08] and so did John Norris and so did Barry Oh but let's face it people.

[19:12] None of these games were ever getting made.

[19:15] None of these games were even complete.

[19:18] There wasn't one complete game they ever made.

[19:23] Raza was never even completed.

[19:25] Go watch a stream of Raza.

[19:27] Go watch that game.

[19:29] It is such a weird experience.

[19:30] Like you watch it and it feels like there's no real code.

[19:34] Like there's no magic in the game.

[19:36] There's no like all these incredible modes and animations happening.

[19:40] None of it is there.

[19:42] It's such a pathetic gameplay experience.

[19:45] And then after Raza there's nothing.

[19:48] Nothing else is done.

[19:49] It's so funny that they didn't even have a food truck game but yet they spent millions

[19:55] on food truck animations.

[19:56] Let me repeat that.

[19:57] I heard food truck animations cost like a million dollars.

[20:01] It's absolutely a name.

[20:03] How much money was spent on stuff that didn't even go into a pinball machine.

[20:08] But here's my question for all of you and write in the comments what your thoughts are.

[20:12] I'm at the point now where I'm sort of just over everything deep root and I listened to

[20:18] blueberry Johnson and this guy's got way more stuff he wants to put out in the world.

[20:24] And if you go to the deep root thread I mean he's in it like every day for hours and here's

[20:30] the part I don't get.

[20:31] Why is he so obsessed with deep root.

[20:35] The man lives in Hawaii.

[20:37] He's like in Maui.

[20:39] And why is he on that thread seemingly hours a day nonstop hunting for information about

[20:47] deep root.

[20:48] It's really weird to me too how much he's putting into this whole thing.

[20:53] It's kind of scary because it's pointless blueberry Johnson.

[20:56] We all know the way this movie ends and I don't care what led to the disaster of deep

[21:03] root pinball anymore.

[21:04] Like we know it led to the disaster.

[21:06] It was a ship where the captain was the biggest fool on planet Earth and he had no right captaining

[21:11] a ship with all these people.

[21:13] He had no experience with manufacturing and he stole money from old ladies.

[21:19] And I'm at the point now where like I really don't care anymore about all these new revelations

[21:24] at deep root because it's not worth it.

[21:27] The games suck.

[21:28] They suck.

[21:29] Look at all those games.

[21:31] They are all half thought out half baked pieces of trash and they deserve to be thrown in

[21:39] the garbage.

[21:40] I don't care that some of these were made by designers that you guys worship.

[21:44] Those games all look like garbage.

[21:47] None of them none of them look that fun.

[21:50] None of them look that incredible.

[21:52] None of them look anywhere nearly as good as like anything Keith Elwin could do or Eric

[21:57] Minier could do or John Bore can do.

[22:00] Trust me when I say this.

[22:02] If someone was great at pinball design they would have been at Stern CGC or JJP.

[22:10] Those companies absorbed everybody that people really wanted and what you got at deep root

[22:16] was all the leftovers.

[22:18] Now Dennis Norman is like always that exception.

[22:21] Obviously he's very talented.

[22:22] Obviously I think Dennis Norman is an incredible designer but clearly Dennis also needs a paycheck

[22:28] and for some reason I don't know what it is but for some reason I don't know why Dennis

[22:32] just couldn't land permanently at one of the more stable companies.

[22:39] I would love for Dennis to tell us why that is the case because he's clearly talented

[22:43] and why does he keep floating around everywhere.

[22:47] Just get somewhere Dennis and be like a stable designer at one of the stable companies.

[22:53] That seems to be the goal of any creative in the pinball world not just the designers

[22:59] also the artists.

[23:00] You think Franchi is happy he's just floating around pinball space now looking for an outlet

[23:05] for his creativity.

[23:07] No like he had the dream job.

[23:10] The dream job of an artist is to be at Stern.

[23:13] You will be able to work on two games a year and see your hard work out in the world with

[23:19] the company that is going nowhere that gets the best themes and you got to protect that

[23:25] at all costs.

[23:26] You have to protect that kind of job.

[23:28] We know what happens.

[23:30] Creative sometime can start to think that they're more important than the company but as we've

[23:34] learned the most important thing when you work for somebody because everyone's working

[23:39] for someone you need to keep your employer happy.

[23:42] If you get on Gary Stern's bad side and he doesn't want to work with you anymore that's

[23:46] it.

[23:47] If you get on Leonard Abbess's bad side and you get kicked out of JJP that's it right.

[23:52] So look if I was in the pinball world as a creative I would want to be at Stern pinball.

[23:57] That is the one place I'd want to be.

[23:59] Let's just go around the horn real quick.

[24:00] So speaking of Stern pinball if you have a rush machine there is a new mod out by the

[24:04] Ninja Camp mod people now these people they're not just making scoop protectors and by the

[24:08] way I love what I saw with them is they saw that someone who had one of their scoop protectors

[24:13] there was a weakness in it and it broke and they said we think it's just a defect on that

[24:18] one unit that was printed but we are going to reinforce that area on all moving forward

[24:24] and if you have an issue we will fix it for free.

[24:27] Here's what I love about these guys is they now made a mod.

[24:30] If you play Rush there's like a loop shot in the upper left where you can't really see

[24:34] the inserts well and so what they made was a really awesome mod that sits right above

[24:40] that area that shows you if the insert is lit for like I think it's one two three and

[24:46] an arrow and I love this mod.

[24:48] I love mods that actually serve a purpose versus just gluing tacky stuff all over the

[24:55] game.

[24:57] So if you have a rush take a look at this mod I think it's something you're all going

[25:01] to want.

[25:02] American Pinball I heard this rumor over at the Pinball show thank you Zach and team

[25:06] that American Pinball is supposedly thinking about releasing more Houdinis and Oktoberfest

[25:13] but get ready for this.

[25:15] They're going to strip features out because I think they're new strategies they want to

[25:19] make pros and deluxe's and so the old Houdinis and Oktoberfest will be considered deluxe

[25:26] machines and then they're going to sell pro versions that have stuff removed from the game.

[25:33] Another terrible idea by David Fix and American Pinball.

[25:38] I wish Mukesh would just call me and I wouldn't charge my $400 in our fee for smart marketing

[25:47] ideas for them.

[25:48] I would actually sit in a room with them and in two hours I could set American Pinball's

[25:54] strategy in such a better way.

[25:57] This is not a good strategy.

[25:59] First thing they need to do is stop looking backwards at Houdini and Oktoberfest.

[26:05] Stop.

[26:06] Nobody wants to revisit these games.

[26:07] They weren't successful.

[26:09] They're not going to be successful.

[26:11] Stop remaking games in ugly cabinets.

[26:14] Nobody wants that back box.

[26:15] We need to fix the back box.

[26:17] Our games don't look pretty enough.

[26:19] Stop.

[26:20] The artwork on Oktoberfest is arguably one of the worst art packages of all time.

[26:25] If I'm sitting down with them, forget the past.

[26:30] The past of this company was set in motion by John Papadook and Mukesh's family members

[26:35] who didn't really know what they were doing.

[26:37] If I'm David Fix, I'm saying to them, look, Dennis Norman's game is the start of the new

[26:43] American Pinball.

[26:45] Everything that came before it, including Legends of Vahala, which wasn't a game we

[26:49] made, we are going to close the book on the past.

[26:53] And we are going to make sure that Dennis Norman's game is the coming out party of the

[26:58] new American Pinball.

[27:00] There's going to be a new cabinet.

[27:02] There's going to be a new American Pinball logo.

[27:05] This is our moment to say welcome to the new American Pinball.

[27:09] But that's not what David Fix is doing.

[27:12] It's like he's shuffling the deck between what's coming and what's old, and he's trying

[27:16] to put it all together in an enticing package, and I just think it's a mistake.

[27:21] David, before you got to AP, tons of mistakes happened.

[27:26] Stop making the same mistakes.

[27:29] Just forget about those titles.

[27:31] And remember when he said he's going to make jumps and loops for Hot Wheels?

[27:35] Well, where's that?

[27:37] He said that two years ago.

[27:39] How hard would it have been to make a mod where you added a loop-to-loop into that game?

[27:44] They can't even figure that out.

[27:45] I just think there's a lot of talk.

[27:48] There's not much marketing expertise over at American Pinball, and I don't expect much

[27:53] from them just because every time they make a move, it's always a real head scratcher.

[27:59] All right, let's go over to Spooky Pinball.

[28:01] The Troubles just never stop with these spooky games.

[28:06] The latest one isn't a new one, but more people are realizing this because more people are

[28:11] getting their Halloween's.

[28:13] And I noticed this on Jack Barr's machine when I first played it.

[28:18] The armor on Halloween, the gold-flaked armor.

[28:22] There is an issue with it.

[28:24] There's not enough clear coat on the armor itself.

[28:27] So when you play the game, the gold turns to black.

[28:31] You actually end up discoloring the armor with the oil from your hands.

[28:37] And it is bad.

[28:38] It looks really, really bad.

[28:40] And every single Halloween collector's edition is going to suffer the same fate if you keep

[28:47] your palms and your hands on the lockdown bar and on the side rails, which is where

[28:53] you keep your hands on a pinball machine, which goes to show once again they didn't

[28:58] properly test this stuff before they sent it out to customers.

[29:04] Everyone in on a Halloween and an Ultraman is nothing more than a guinea pig.

[29:09] So then the question becomes, well, what is spooky do now if you're not happy with this?

[29:14] I think this is another thing that is going to be a headache for them.

[29:19] I think solving this won't be that easy.

[29:22] Are they going to allow people to send back their armor and get it recoded?

[29:27] That sounds like a really long and really laborious problem.

[29:33] Are they going to make new changes to it and then send the old people new lockdown bars

[29:38] and side rails?

[29:40] Not the easiest thing to switch in and out of a machine, but not too hard.

[29:44] The problem is all of this is going to cost them a lot of money.

[29:48] And much like hedge multi-baw, here we are once again, something that should have been

[29:54] caught at the factory.

[29:56] I don't know guys, like this whole like Spooky's a small boutique, they've been doing it for

[30:01] 10 years.

[30:02] They didn't have this issue with any other game they made.

[30:05] And so it just goes to show that a lot of what I'm seeing is the result of, I think,

[30:11] rushing games out, not properly testing them.

[30:15] And that's it.

[30:16] Like there's no other way around it.

[30:17] And I think this is going to be another example of owners are either going to have to live

[30:22] with it or they're going to raise a stink and force Spooky to make changes.

[30:27] The last bit of news is CGC is starting to get more cactus cannons out.

[30:32] I'm seeing more unboxings, which is good.

[30:34] Still no word on when the LEDs are going to ship.

[30:37] And one issue, if you have a cactus canyon, just look out for this.

[30:40] The drop targets are having some issues.

[30:42] We know that CGC re-engineered the drop targets on cactus canyon.

[30:47] So who knows, right?

[30:48] They made the opening smaller where the drop targets are.

[30:51] So is that the problem?

[30:53] Is there too much movement in the drop targets?

[30:56] But if you have a cactus canyon, just look at your drop targets and just know that there

[31:00] might be a possible issue with them.

[31:03] All right, everybody.

[31:04] So that's it for a little hump day version of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[31:08] As you can see, even when there's not a ton of pinball news, I'm going to do shows.

[31:12] I'm going to make it entertaining.

[31:13] I'm going to get right to the point.

[31:15] And I love doing this show for all of you.

[31:17] So thank you once again for all of your support.

[31:19] For you new club members, I'm excited for you because you just joined.

[31:24] And now you have all of the club episodes that you can go back and listen to.

[31:27] That's what's fun about it is when you join the club, like they've never heard these podcasts

[31:32] before, and there is a lot of them.

[31:34] And so every week we keep getting new members.

[31:37] Thank you so much.

[31:38] If you have friends out there who are in the pinball world, I would love for you to introduce

[31:43] them to this podcast because I think for some people out there, they're missing out on the

[31:47] fun, but none of you guys are.

[31:49] So thank you so much.

[31:51] All four hundred and eighty of you have a great day.

[31:54] Your odyssey continues against the awesome forces that oppose your efforts to reach the

[31:59] dragon's beard.

[32:00] Lead on adventurer.

[32:01] Your quest awaits.
