[00:00] Because I know somewhere deep down in my heart, I still love you.

[00:14] I was sort of like the reaction to Stern's Batman 66 application form that came out today.

[00:32] It's just a whole other reason why people are going to complain about what Stern is doing.

[00:38] And I think I just get into the point now where I don't know about the rest of you, but

[00:42] reading Pennside on a daily basis, it's just starting to get depressing.

[00:47] And I'm going to cover this on a different podcast, but the amount of complaining and whining

[00:51] and moaning and groaning, it's just getting out of hand.

[00:56] So let's call this Canada's Pimball Podcast Episode 52, Moaning and Groaning.

[01:05] Joining me on this episode is going to be Blake.

[01:08] We talked to Blake a couple of weeks ago.

[01:11] He's Creative Director doing Domino's Pimball Spectacular.

[01:14] And him and I are going to talk about the application that came out today for Batman 66.

[01:19] We're going to talk about where we think Pimball is going in 10 years.

[01:22] We're going to talk a little bit about Star Wars.

[01:24] We're going to talk a little bit about Ghost Busters.

[01:27] It's a great interview.

[01:29] It's a little long.

[01:30] I'm sorry, it's an hour and a half, but it's great.

[01:32] So I want to get right to it.

[01:33] I think you'll enjoy it.

[01:35] Unlike other podcasts, we're not going to talk about how we set the mic up for 10 minutes.

[01:38] We're going to jump right into it.

[01:39] So let me roll the tape for you guys.

[01:41] All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[01:46] Blake, Dumas Nile, the Creative Director working on Domino's Pimball Spectacular.

[01:52] Blake's going to join me.

[01:53] We're just going to talk about stuff that's percolating through the Pimball hobby.

[01:57] Blake, welcome to the back to the show.

[02:00] Thanks a lot.

[02:01] Good to be here.

[02:02] All right.

[02:03] And we have a list of things we want to talk about.

[02:05] I'm going to run down them, but then I'm going to reveal what we're going to start with

[02:08] because it's sort of blew up today.

[02:10] We want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pimball Podcast, where we think the Pimball

[02:15] hobby is going to be in 10 years.

[02:17] We want to talk about whether or not we think there's going to be a bubble burst when it

[02:21] comes to Pimball prices in the future.

[02:24] We want to discuss Ghost Busters.

[02:26] Is it the best worst Pimball ever?

[02:28] We're going to talk about expo.

[02:30] What we think it's going to be like between the showdown of Batman, Alien, and J.J.P.

[02:35] and spooky.

[02:37] We might talk a little bit about Star Wars.

[02:39] But before we get to all of that, Blake, we have to talk about Gary Stern's move to offer

[02:46] Batman 66 super limited edition as something people can apply to buy.

[02:53] What were your thoughts when you saw that news today?

[02:58] You know, honestly, the first thing that popped in my mind was that they were looking at

[03:04] a market that they haven't really tapped into yet.

[03:07] I thought it was actually a pretty interesting marketing move.

[03:09] I mean, I actually had to laugh about it, honestly.

[03:13] You know, the response to this application thing has been pretty entertaining to read.

[03:23] I've got to say, it's kind of one of these damned if you do, damned if you don't type

[03:28] of situations.

[03:29] I mean, there were a lot of people that were upset that there were going to be 30 of these

[03:33] games that were very limited and exclusive and that they potentially were not going to

[03:37] have an opportunity to buy one.

[03:39] And that if they wanted to get an LE, they wanted the absolute best LE option out there.

[03:44] But then on the other hand, you know, now Stern has made that opportunity to available

[03:50] to people.

[03:52] And yet, they're still upset about it.

[03:53] Right.

[03:54] Right.

[03:55] So it's like, you know, it's, you know, you kind of can't have your cake and eat it

[04:02] too.

[04:03] You have to kind of respect what they're doing.

[04:05] And I think that they're doing something special for their anniversary, but they're also

[04:10] trying to tap into some of these super collectors, if you will, that are out there.

[04:15] And they clearly are out there.

[04:17] I mean, right.

[04:19] And for those of you who haven't seen the application, let's go through real quickly,

[04:23] like, what is in this application?

[04:26] Right.

[04:27] Because I think people were shocked, right?

[04:28] I do agree with you, Blake, that Stern seems like they can never win lately on, on, on

[04:33] Pinside, right?

[04:34] They, they, to your point, people were locked out, so people were pissed.

[04:39] And they let you buy it.

[04:40] And, but this is how you have to like get a chance to buy it and people are pissed.

[04:44] So the, the, when I was pissed because I opened it up and I'm like, man, I'm never going

[04:48] to get one because I can't even answer yes to half of these questions.

[04:52] So the first question is, or, or, or, or, they didn't want to know is, please,

[04:58] list the games in your collection.

[05:00] Stern and other brands.

[05:01] Okay, so I have a, a Williams, Tails, the Rabia Knights, and no Sterns right now.

[05:07] I mean, I have a Ghostbusters, I'm waiting for it.

[05:09] So I have no Stern Pimbal machine.

[05:10] So right there, I'm out.

[05:12] That, that the next question is, have you ever visited the Stern Pimbal factory?

[05:16] Um, but, you know, Blake, let, let me ask you these questions.

[05:20] As, as if I'm Gary and I'm asking you to apply it.

[05:23] So do you have any Sterns in your collection or other brands?

[05:27] Uh, no, I'm in the same boat you are.

[05:30] I'm waiting on a Ghostbusters premium.

[05:31] So, uh, it, be my first game.

[05:34] That's it.

[05:35] You're out.

[05:36] You're not getting one.

[05:37] Okay.

[05:38] Have you ever visited the Stern Pimbal factory?

[05:39] Nope.

[05:40] Never been to Chicago.

[05:41] All right.

[05:42] Over to you're definitely not getting one.

[05:43] How many, how many Pimbal shows or events do you attend each year?

[05:47] Uh, two.

[05:49] Okay.

[05:50] And there's, there's, there's dozens of Pimbal shows each year.

[05:53] Yeah.

[05:54] Uh, have you ever met Gary Stern or Joe, Kim, Kim, Kim, and cow?

[05:59] I've probably never, never met him, but I'm friends with somebody who has.

[06:03] Okay.

[06:04] Well, and it's like half a point.

[06:05] I, I, I'm answering note of those as well.

[06:08] Um, what else do you collect besides Pimbal machines?

[06:12] And that's an interesting question.

[06:13] And we'll talk about why I think that one's in there.

[06:16] Yeah.

[06:17] I thought that was interesting too.

[06:19] Um, you know, I think that they're kind of trying to gauge, you know, what's sort of

[06:25] the common interest among people, you know, that share this hobby.

[06:28] You know, what else, you know, are they into cars or they into other anti collectibles,

[06:34] you know, jukeboxes, arcades, whatever.

[06:37] Um, I think that's more of a fun question.

[06:39] I think they want to know what will this exclusive game be surrounded by, you know?

[06:46] Yeah.

[06:47] I mean, I, I think that could be part of it, right?

[06:49] And I, I think, and this is just me as a marketer looking at this.

[06:52] I think they're just trying to find out who's got money.

[06:56] Like, if you're, if you're collecting cars or you're collecting beanie babies, I mean,

[07:01] which one, which one is it?

[07:02] Um, so I think that's an interesting question.

[07:04] And then the next question is named three titles that would be interesting for you for

[07:09] a stern cupow, limited boutique game in the future.

[07:15] Man, you know, I'm surprised at all the jaws people aren't jumping all over this opportunity

[07:20] to let stern know exactly the kind of games and titles that they want to see.

[07:25] Right.

[07:26] You know, I mean, they're, they're fishing for, if you've got $15,000 to drop on one of these

[07:31] exclusive games, then, hey, maybe stern saying we might be willing to cater to you a little

[07:36] bit, right?

[07:37] Yeah, this is definitely sort of like hidden.

[07:41] It's not even hidden.

[07:42] Like, inside this application for Batman is really just questions to get marketing data

[07:49] for them, customer data for them that they don't have.

[07:52] Right.

[07:53] If they want to find out what themes people want next, right now they have to dive through

[07:59] threads on pin side of, and you know how the threads are, every 15th answer is a legitimate

[08:06] one.

[08:07] Just people like sharing photos of women or stupid answers back and forth, it would take

[08:12] them forever to plow through it.

[08:14] So this is an easy way for them to aggregate the three themes, three themes from each customer

[08:20] that they want to see, right?

[08:21] I mean, it's simple.

[08:22] Absolutely.

[08:23] I mean, they're, they're going directly for their target audience.

[08:27] You know, I think that they, they have seen how much value there is in the collector market.

[08:32] Although, you know, previous years Gary has said that, you know, their, you know, overseas

[08:38] sales and operating, you know, routed games, sales were a huge part of the company.

[08:45] I don't doubt that, but I think that they also see just how much money and support that

[08:51] the home collectors are providing to the company as well.

[08:53] So I mean, you'd be foolish not to learn who your target audience is, you know, it's,

[08:59] like doing a marketing analysis on who your customer base is.

[09:03] So it makes perfect sense.

[09:06] And I think that it also, I think it also backs up this, this notion that they kind of

[09:13] have started with Ghostbusters and now Batman 66 of, you know, how successful can these

[09:21] nostalgic retro titles actually be?

[09:23] You know, I think they're finding out with Ghostbusters sales and Batman sales already

[09:28] that there's a huge base for these nostalgic games, maybe even more so than current themes,

[09:36] you know.

[09:37] Right.

[09:38] I couldn't agree more.

[09:39] What's interesting to you about that question is the Stern Kapow limited boutique game

[09:43] in the future, right?

[09:44] There's, there's like this partnership now that's going to start with Batman where Kapow

[09:49] who makes slot machines, right?

[09:51] Like, they, and they use a lot of like video technology and there's slot machines and a

[09:57] lot of different assets that there's a lot of speculation that that's going to be incorporated

[10:01] into the, into the Batman pinball machine.

[10:04] It's interesting if, if, if it's the Kapow element that's going to make the games like

[10:09] super early, right?

[10:10] That they're going to bring some of the innovation that they brought to the slot machine world

[10:15] to pinball.

[10:16] And that's what's going to cause the, the superness in these games to make up a word.

[10:23] So yeah, that is interesting.

[10:25] I agree with you and I do wonder, you know, are they just going to start tapping into licenses

[10:31] that Kapow has already secured for these slot machines and stuff?

[10:34] I personally, I have not gone and looked at what all slot machines they've done.

[10:40] But yeah, I mean, this, this must, may just be a very easy way for Stern to deal with

[10:47] the license without having to start from scratch with the license holder, you know.

[10:51] So the next question, I think they kind of phrased it a little too strident, but I'll

[10:56] read it in 200 words or less, please tell us why you deserve an invitation to purchase

[11:02] our 30th anniversary super early Batman 66 game.

[11:07] And I think, I think they could have, they could have asked this question in a little bit

[11:12] of a different way.

[11:13] That's more like in 200 words, ask us why you'd love a chance to buy the game, right?

[11:19] I mean, the die hard collectors or Batman fans, that's what you want to get from people.

[11:24] But asking people why they deserve an invitation is a little presumptuous that nobody is as good

[11:32] as they are.

[11:32] I thought it was funny when I read that.

[11:35] My 200 words would be like, because Canadian owning a Batman super early would piss off

[11:41] wise snow, that would be my answer.

[11:43] So I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll marry pass in this in this green box they have here.

[11:49] What do you think people are going to say

[11:52] but when they have to, you have a 200 word limit

[11:57] to explain why you deserve it?

[12:00] You know, I think that in a nutshell,

[12:03] what they're trying to figure out from people is

[12:07] who are the real fans here that would value having

[12:11] one of these kind of machines?

[12:12] I mean, you've got to use those 200 words

[12:15] pretty, pretty sparingly.

[12:17] And I mean, I do think that people,

[12:24] they could come up with a lot of different ways

[12:26] to say, oh, I'm a super collector,

[12:28] I've got this many games, but just because you have

[12:31] the money to own 30, 50, 60 games,

[12:35] doesn't necessarily mean that you're,

[12:37] you know, any more diehard of a collector

[12:39] or enthusiast than somebody who only has permission.

[12:42] So I think that maybe what they're looking for here is,

[12:47] you know, an eloquent, passionate,

[12:51] you know, way for people to explain and express

[12:54] why they would like to have one of these games

[12:57] and maybe how they would use it,

[12:58] how they would entertain within stuff.

[13:00] So I don't know, it's kind of, to me,

[13:03] it's a textbook question for these types of contests

[13:07] or applications or whatever you wanna call it,

[13:09] you know, basically tell us why, you know,

[13:13] you would like to have one the most

[13:15] and why you would enjoy it more than anybody else

[13:18] that could have the opportunity to get one of these.

[13:20] Of course, a lot of people on Pinsider are also saying,

[13:23] this question also reads, you know, explain us

[13:26] why we should give you the opportunity

[13:28] to, for you to give us a lot of money

[13:30] to be able to purchase this game.

[13:32] You know what they're gonna get?

[13:33] And whenever I would run promotions with contests

[13:37] and I saw this with like Pepsi perfect

[13:39] and when we had a limited number,

[13:41] you're gonna get a lot of people trying to tug

[13:45] on the hard strings and sympathy plays too.

[13:47] You're gonna get like my dad who just passed away,

[13:51] like loved Batman 66 and it's my fondest memory of him

[13:55] and this would mean the world or, you know,

[13:58] they're gonna get a lot of that.

[13:59] So it's gonna be interesting to see

[14:00] what their filter is for deciding who's gonna get it or not.

[14:05] And then the next question, and then this is another one

[14:07] or I think this is purely based

[14:08] that sort of so they can see who's got cheddar and who does.

[14:12] And please submit a one to two minute video, YouTube link,

[14:17] showing us your collection and showing us why you would have

[14:21] and why you should have an invite to purchase

[14:24] the 30th anniversary of the Batman Ellie Super Ellie.

[14:28] So it's interesting that like one's video, one's writing.

[14:32] I don't know if, I don't know,

[14:33] it doesn't say if you have to do both of these

[14:34] or you get there's an option to do one.

[14:37] But here they are, basically Stern's gonna get

[14:40] to peek into people's homes and see their collections.

[14:43] I mean that is another surefire way where they can determine

[14:46] who's a serious baller and who's not.

[14:51] Yeah, I mean, you know, you think about it.

[14:53] Stern is the only company out there of all the manufacturers

[14:57] that is not selling directly to the collectors, you know,

[15:02] they're, so they're working everything through distributors

[15:05] and they're not getting an opportunity to see exactly

[15:09] how many machines are going out on location

[15:12] versus going into people's homes.

[15:15] Yeah, I think it does give them a very good metric

[15:18] of who their die hard fans are and who's buying

[15:22] every single game they've got or, you know,

[15:26] now should that have any bearing on who gets one

[15:28] of these machines?

[15:29] I don't think so.

[15:29] I think that whoever provides the best answers

[15:32] and provides the passion that they want to see

[15:35] and I don't mean the answers that tug on the heartstrings

[15:38] like you said, and you're right,

[15:39] there will be people that submit answers like that.

[15:42] But I think that there's a way to express passion

[15:45] for this industry without having an entire warehouse full

[15:49] of games to show off, you know.

[15:51] Yeah, that just means you got the money.

[15:52] So that does answer one of their questions

[15:55] and maybe one of the pieces of criteria for this machine.

[15:58] But at the same time, you know,

[16:02] so I have a solve that I'm going to reveal

[16:05] that I didn't read anyone say this on Pinside

[16:08] and I didn't read anyone say this on Facebook.

[16:12] I'm going to go to the last two points

[16:13] and I'm going to tell you what I think is a solve

[16:15] that could create a win-win for Stern and all the people

[16:18] complaining and all the people who really wanted

[16:20] and what could be a fair way for them

[16:23] to come out of this whole situation.

[16:25] But the last two points are interesting too

[16:27] because they're not questions,

[16:28] they're sort of bullets here.

[16:31] If you plan to sell the game in the first 18 months,

[16:34] Stern Pimball has the right,

[16:37] the first right option to buy the game back.

[16:39] So they're stealing a page from Ferrari

[16:42] from the car industry where they saw a super limited version

[16:46] of the car Ferrari has a chance to buy it back.

[16:50] So how they gonna, I asked them like,

[16:53] how are you gonna track that?

[16:54] Is it gonna be GPS in the game?

[16:56] I mean, are they just gonna monitor

[16:58] all the places Pimball sold?

[17:00] I mean, obviously people can do deals behind the scenes.

[17:03] They'll never know if these games are really traveling.

[17:06] Yeah, like you said, they can do it offline

[17:12] to where if it's not popping up on Pinside or eBay

[17:15] within the first 18 months,

[17:17] then it's gonna be something that's probably hard to manage.

[17:21] I don't think they're gonna go to the trouble

[17:23] to try to track it.

[17:25] So I applaud them for trying to prevent people

[17:33] from scalping these machines immediately,

[17:35] just buying them to flip them simply

[17:36] because they have the money to do so.

[17:40] And essentially screwing other people over

[17:43] by trying to charge even more money

[17:45] than what it costs in the first place.

[17:46] But my question is, why do that?

[17:49] Why not just let people flip who wanna flip

[17:53] and let people who wanna, as people would say,

[17:55] people who have the money and wanna buy it,

[17:58] like let's say, let's say a stencil of this game's 12 grand

[18:01] and people wanna flip it right away for 15, for 16,000, right?

[18:06] I see cactus canyons going for 16 grand

[18:09] and this machine's much rarer in terms of number.

[18:12] If someone wants to flip it, I don't know,

[18:14] it's just weird that they're like trying to stop it.

[18:16] I get the effort, but they'll never stop the flipping.

[18:19] Exactly, yeah, I get the effort as well.

[18:22] And like I said, I applaud them for trying to make sure

[18:26] these end up in the hands of people

[18:27] who really wanna keep them, but at the same time,

[18:30] if you've paid the money to own one of these machines,

[18:34] you have every right to do what you want with.

[18:36] And if that means that you play it for one month

[18:39] and you don't really like the game that much,

[18:41] then you should have the right to sell it

[18:43] regardless of what kind of a model game it is.

[18:45] So yeah, here's the thing,

[18:50] regardless of whether people can buy the game

[18:53] and sell it within one week or one month

[18:55] of it being brand new versus waiting 18 months.

[18:57] These 30 games are always going to be very limited.

[19:01] They're always going to be exclusive

[19:03] and they're always going to bring more money

[19:05] than what they originally sold for,

[19:08] regardless of an 18 month period, I think.

[19:11] I think that the limited nature of the game

[19:14] is just automatically going to create a built-in demand.

[19:19] Unless the game's a dog, right?

[19:22] I don't think it's gonna be, but if the game comes out

[19:25] and it's not great and people don't like it,

[19:29] it would be interesting to see what would happen,

[19:31] but just because they are rare,

[19:33] I think I agree with you.

[19:34] They're gonna hold their value or go up.

[19:36] Yeah, and you're absolutely right.

[19:39] I mean, if the game sucks, which I think is probably doubtful,

[19:43] I think enough people like the original version

[19:45] of Batman, Dark Knight, as it is,

[19:48] they'd probably stick with it anyways,

[19:50] or they'd find it a good enough game to buy it.

[19:53] So, yeah, I don't think you're looking at

[19:57] like a WWE situation here with this game, you know?

[20:00] Right.

[20:02] Okay, so the final point they write,

[20:03] and the applications and video become the property of Stern

[20:08] and can be used for promotion and testimonial purposes.

[20:11] So that's kind of smart there.

[20:12] They're asking people to basically upload videos

[20:16] basically begging Stern to let them buy a Bimbal machine

[20:19] and these people are gonna be gushing, you know,

[20:21] all their praises for Stern,

[20:24] and Stern's gonna be able to use that all

[20:26] for their social media content.

[20:27] So they just did a lot of Stern's own marketing for them.

[20:30] So I think in terms of Stern coming out winners,

[20:37] in terms of what they're gonna get for free from people

[20:39] with this application is a smart move.

[20:41] Now, how many people will actually fill out the application?

[20:43] If people really want to protest,

[20:45] they just want to fill it out, right?

[20:47] That's the easiest way not to let Stern have

[20:50] bull you around like this, right?

[20:52] Yeah, I mean, here's a thing for all the complaining

[20:54] that everybody's doing about this today.

[20:57] Nobody's twisting anyone's arm to fill this application out

[21:00] or to try to get one of these games.

[21:02] If you really want one of the games,

[21:05] these are the conditions that you're gonna try to get one under

[21:08] or you're gonna wait till somebody sells one down the road,

[21:12] you know, to try to get one without going through

[21:13] all the application process.

[21:15] But honestly, it's like, look,

[21:17] if you don't like the circumstances,

[21:20] all you have to do is not participate.

[21:22] Nobody's forcing you to.

[21:23] So yeah, and in regards to the video content

[21:27] being used for promotion and testimonial purposes,

[21:30] yeah, it's smart on their part, you know?

[21:32] At the same time, I think that it's probably not a bad thing

[21:37] for the hobby either.

[21:38] I think there are a lot of people that if they don't have

[21:41] a problem with their collections being shown online,

[21:44] I think that a lot of people are going to see

[21:46] just what kind of collections are out there

[21:48] and just how big this hobby actually is.

[21:51] So perhaps it may be a good thing for the hobby.

[21:53] That could be a stretch.

[21:54] And I know doing it through Stern's, you know, channels

[21:58] may still seem to be one side of it

[22:00] because they may only focus on the collections

[22:02] that are, you know, Stern machine heavy.

[22:05] But at the same time, I do think that it shows

[22:09] just how big this hobby's actually grown

[22:11] and how important the home collector market is.

[22:14] So what I was alluding to earlier in terms of what I would do

[22:18] to sort of come out of this on top and create a win-win

[22:22] is if I were Stern, I would collect as many as I could

[22:26] and I'd say, look, we got so many passionate collectors,

[22:30] we got so many great answers that we can't narrow it down

[22:33] to just five.

[22:34] We're gonna, everyone who submitted an application,

[22:37] we're gonna put into a lottery and pick five winners out.

[22:41] And they could have done that.

[22:43] They couldn't made it lottery from the get-go

[22:45] and made the questions a little broader

[22:46] and not so much about, have you ever met Gary?

[22:49] You know, like things that don't really matter

[22:52] in terms of like what the information they need

[22:54] is valuable to them because that's not valuable to them.

[22:56] That doesn't matter.

[22:57] If Apple's gonna send me a survey,

[22:59] it doesn't matter if I meet Kim Cook or not.

[23:01] Like, you know, there's stuff in there

[23:04] that just seems a little bit like,

[23:06] it's a favor to simply play, then there's stuff in there

[23:08] that actually would help them with their marketing.

[23:11] So, I don't know.

[23:12] I think it's this thing kinda seesaws for me.

[23:15] It's like, are they trying to just butter the people

[23:17] who have shown them love

[23:18] or they actually trying to open it up

[23:20] to people who just love collecting pinball?

[23:23] Like, what if you're a Valley Williams guy

[23:25] and you all of a sudden, you know,

[23:27] but you want this to be your first stirring

[23:29] because you love Batman so much?

[23:31] Yeah, so I like your idea

[23:34] and I do think that that would probably be

[23:36] the most diplomatic way to handle this.

[23:39] Here's the one question that they don't ask

[23:41] on this application.

[23:42] They specifically say, why, you know,

[23:45] they're saying, tell us why you deserve an invitation

[23:48] to purchase this machine.

[23:50] Nobody knows how much this game is going to cost.

[23:53] Now, we would expect it to be more expensive than an LE.

[23:58] It's a super LE.

[23:59] It's even more limited, right?

[24:00] Well, they're not, you know,

[24:03] there are people that could give great answers

[24:05] to all of these questions.

[24:06] Hell, I could probably draft up great answers

[24:08] to these questions, but I can't afford

[24:12] to buy one of these games for what the likely price points

[24:15] going to be on it.

[24:15] So that makes me wonder, you know,

[24:20] are they, you know, would they take the five best answers?

[24:24] And if those people can't pay $15,000, let's say,

[24:29] for this game, you know, does that take him out

[24:32] of the running?

[24:33] Is Stern going to cave?

[24:35] Do they compromise on the price to give into the right kind

[24:40] of answers and people's passion?

[24:41] Or is this really just about saying,

[24:44] we gave everybody the opportunity to buy one

[24:46] of these machines if they could?

[24:49] And, you know, they're not going to,

[24:51] they're not going to own anybody

[24:52] and explanation of why they chose who they chose.

[24:54] Right.

[24:55] So I don't know.

[24:57] I think this is more about getting marketing analysis data

[25:01] and saying that they gave people the opportunity

[25:04] to buy one of these machines if they want to.

[25:07] And yeah, it also lets them see who they're, you know,

[25:09] they're super fans.

[25:10] Who are the super collectors that are out there?

[25:12] Who can buy the Ferraris and Lamborghinnings

[25:15] of the pinball industry?

[25:17] Right.

[25:17] Now, I agree.

[25:18] And I think at the end of the day,

[25:21] this is Stern's move that basically is just

[25:25] putting a mirror in front of the hobby.

[25:27] And they're saying, look, this is what

[25:30] the new collector world is.

[25:32] As we have heard from you guys,

[25:34] you want limited edition machines that are special.

[25:37] And it's not even like Stern heard from people,

[25:40] they just watched.

[25:41] They watched people hand J-Pop $16,000

[25:45] without seeing a single thing, right?

[25:47] For a game that might come out one day,

[25:51] they watched this go on in the hobby.

[25:53] And this is just Stern's reaction

[25:55] to the super collector who wants that rare item

[25:59] that most people don't have.

[26:01] And I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

[26:03] I think it pisses certain people off.

[26:05] But look, it's so easy to go get a premium or an LE,

[26:08] I mean, the LE sold out, but I'll say this,

[26:10] it was much less of a hassle to get an LE Batman 66

[26:14] than to go through all this application

[26:16] and asking permission to buy it.

[26:18] Exactly.

[26:19] I mean, we don't even know how this game,

[26:22] what it looks like, or how the game plays.

[26:25] We got all these people that are putting pre-orders down

[26:28] and complaining about whether they can

[26:32] or cannot get a certain model of this game.

[26:34] But yet, I think that we're kind of missing

[26:37] the whole thing that really ought to be important.

[26:40] Is the game fun and does it play well?

[26:43] That's what we do with Pimball Machines.

[26:45] I'm sure there are people that just let them sit

[26:46] in their homes and they don't play them very much.

[26:48] But Pimball Machines are meant to be played.

[26:50] They're meant to be fun items that you interact with.

[26:54] And who cares what kind of model it is, you know?

[26:58] Well, I guess the point that the question becomes Blake

[27:01] is do collectors who want the rarest,

[27:06] do they even care about playing?

[27:09] You know, I think that there probably

[27:11] are some people out there that care, but at the same time,

[27:14] I think that it's just as much about the machine

[27:16] being a conversation piece and being able to point to

[27:19] and say, I'm one of only 30 people in the world

[27:22] that owns that machine.

[27:23] Yeah, I don't think it's the way.

[27:24] I'm the only person speaking to the LE placards

[27:31] that they've started posting pictures of.

[27:32] I'm the only person that owns the Batmobile,

[27:36] Bat Gadget, LE model of this thing, you know?

[27:40] Right.

[27:40] Well, I think that it's gonna,

[27:43] if you, if I'm assuming that people who get this

[27:47] have a collection and I can't see them banging away

[27:51] on the pin because why would they?

[27:54] And it brings up an interesting debate

[27:58] because how much would people want to play something

[28:00] that is gonna put wear and tear on it

[28:03] if it's so damn rare?

[28:04] I mean, people are not banging away on King Pins

[28:06] and King Kongs.

[28:08] They're gonna just play a pin to the left and right of it

[28:10] that is more readily available.

[28:12] So, but again, I think the collector's happy

[28:16] because he has the rare item.

[28:18] I don't think playing the pinball machine

[28:20] necessarily is what brings him the pleasure.

[28:21] And I understand the mentality of that collector.

[28:25] As much as it pisses off people who are,

[28:27] who are player collectors,

[28:29] that this is not for them.

[28:31] If you're a player collector, get an LE

[28:35] or get a premium because I heard the premiums

[28:36] are gonna be limited too.

[28:37] So, exactly.

[28:39] This is not for them.

[28:41] No, no, it's not.

[28:42] And I do think that this is about catering

[28:48] to a very elite exclusive crowd.

[28:51] And I think that it's about the people

[28:53] who wanna buy these machines as an investment.

[28:57] Whether people like it or not,

[28:59] these games are investments,

[29:01] just like collector cars are investments.

[29:05] So, you're absolutely right.

[29:07] If people wanna be able to play these games,

[29:09] if they wanna play them every single day,

[29:12] then they probably should be looking

[29:15] at a different model game.

[29:17] However, if they can afford to buy one of these super LEDs,

[29:20] if they can get on the list to get one,

[29:22] and they wanna play it every single day,

[29:24] you know, I applaud them and you know,

[29:27] you're doing what you should be doing with Pim-O-Machine.

[29:31] There are a lot of people in the collector car hobby

[29:33] that buy an automobile,

[29:35] and they just turn them into trailer queens.

[29:38] They just trailer them everywhere across the country,

[29:41] or even around the world sometimes.

[29:44] The cars never get driven.

[29:46] There's still beautiful pieces of artwork.

[29:49] But they're not necessarily being used

[29:51] for what they were designed to be used for.

[29:54] There's nothing wrong with that.

[29:55] I have no problem with that.

[29:57] So, I think that if you can afford to buy these things,

[30:01] do what you want with it.

[30:02] Right.

[30:03] No, I agree.

[30:04] And this whole thing is gonna sort of blow over

[30:07] once they actually show the game.

[30:09] Now, here's something I learned today too

[30:11] that nobody really knows.

[30:14] Just because some people like Canada and talk to me

[30:17] about stuff that they see.

[30:18] And I heard that through the rumor mill,

[30:22] that the mechanism that is gonna be

[30:24] in the upper left corner of Batman 66

[30:28] is one of the coolest and most innovative things

[30:31] that Stern has ever done.

[30:34] It's not gonna just be a rotating Joker head.

[30:39] And so this game is real.

[30:40] From, I don't think I've seen like,

[30:44] Stern people so giddy as much as I've seen them giddy

[30:46] around this machine, which is a birthday present

[30:50] to the company.

[30:50] I think it's gonna be really special.

[30:52] I think people are gonna maybe kick themselves

[30:56] that they waited a little long on the sidelines

[30:58] wondering what the price was because at the end of the day,

[31:01] we know the ballpark.

[31:03] We know where they're at.

[31:04] They're not gonna skyrocket on us with this stuff.

[31:08] Yeah, I think that if people really want the machine,

[31:13] then they at least need to be talking to their distributor

[31:17] and figuring out what kind of a deal they can work out with them,

[31:19] whether that means putting money down or not.

[31:22] The people, this theme was clearly geared towards people

[31:27] who are huge fans of the show.

[31:30] This game isn't being built design as a machine meant

[31:34] to be routed or operated.

[31:35] I'm sure there will be some out there.

[31:37] But I'm not surprised that Stern's put a lot of passion

[31:42] and effort into this game.

[31:44] I think it's been in development for a long time.

[31:46] And quite honestly, I was really thrilled to hear

[31:49] that this is gonna be way more than just a reskin

[31:52] of the Dark Knight.

[31:54] I'm glad to hear that they're putting more effort into it

[31:57] and they're really gonna make it something special.

[31:58] And rolling it into their 30th anniversary was a great call.

[32:01] So.

[32:03] All right, well, it's gonna be a fun month waiting for Expo

[32:07] because I think we're gonna see this game right around.

[32:12] I bet we see pictures of it for the first time

[32:14] like that Wednesday Thursday when Expo kicks off.

[32:16] That's my expectation.

[32:19] So we will definitely cover more Batman 66.

[32:22] So let's go on to another topic that got a lot of people

[32:28] sort of fired up and that was where do we think

[32:31] that Pinball Hobby will be in 10 years?

[32:35] 2026, what do you think?

[32:38] Where do you think we're gonna see this hobby?

[32:40] 10 years from now.

[32:42] What kinds of innovation, what kinds of winners and losers?

[32:45] What are your thoughts on 10 years from now, this hobby?

[32:50] Yeah, I thought that was a real interesting thread.

[32:53] Real good sort of devil's advocate type of thread

[32:56] that gets a lot of good discussion going on.

[32:58] And I was very surprised to see how many people

[33:04] thought that this hobby would be practically dead

[33:07] or on a life support and there would be back to only one,

[33:11] maybe two companies, sort of like a repeat of 2001

[33:17] after Balli and Williams went out.

[33:19] I don't think it's gonna be that bad.

[33:20] I think this hobby is doing very, very well.

[33:23] I think that the hobby is going to become

[33:27] more of an elite hobby.

[33:31] I think that people are getting upset

[33:33] about the prices on these things going up.

[33:35] But people don't like making arguments

[33:40] and comparing this to the Cawker car hobby.

[33:41] But I do see a lot of similar trends.

[33:45] The values on these machines are likely not going

[33:48] to go down over time.

[33:49] Even though there may be ups and downs

[33:52] where certain games are worth less than others over time,

[33:54] ultimately I think the trend will continue to go up.

[33:57] I think Stern will still be hanging in there.

[34:00] And I think that there still probably will be

[34:01] a couple of other manufacturers out there.

[34:04] Maybe not on the same, I don't think there will be

[34:06] another manufacturer on the same scale as Stern.

[34:09] Unless, right now, JJP is the only company

[34:12] that's got the, that has an assembly line

[34:16] that is sort of along the same lines of what Stern's got,

[34:22] but not on the same scale.

[34:24] Nobody else is even close.

[34:26] So it's gonna depend on how well some of these other games

[34:31] and titles sell for some of these other manufacturers

[34:33] to determine if they hang in there or not.

[34:36] Royability's gonna be a big thing.

[34:38] Themes will always sell no matter who's making it.

[34:42] I mean, look how much trust was put in Skitbee

[34:45] on Predator just because of what the theme was.

[34:47] You know, so that's not gonna be an issue.

[34:51] It's whether these companies can actually

[34:53] produce the game or not.

[34:54] Can they crank them out and can they build reliable machines?

[34:58] So, right.

[34:59] And it's like, it's a, it's a very broad question, right?

[35:01] Because what I wanna do now is like,

[35:03] let's deconstruct it a little bit

[35:04] and think about like specific variables

[35:08] that could happen over the next 10 years

[35:10] when it, as it pertains to certain elements of the hobby.

[35:12] So, you know, I look at it like,

[35:14] pinball is a thing that's really interesting

[35:16] because if you look at 2006 to today,

[35:21] there hasn't been like tons of innovation, right?

[35:24] In terms of the product.

[35:26] I mean, it's pretty slow in terms of the types of innovation

[35:30] that get incorporated.

[35:32] But if you looked at video games per se

[35:35] and you look at a 10 year period of how video games jump,

[35:40] much more innovation.

[35:41] Now, what's interesting about just entertainment,

[35:45] I think it's hard for me to predict where virtual reality

[35:47] and its impact will have on all gaming in the home

[35:51] and all entertainment in the home.

[35:53] And that is definitely gonna be a factor in people,

[35:58] you know, shelling out $8000 to $10,000

[36:02] for a physical pinball machine.

[36:06] Or can virtual reality pinball 10 years from now?

[36:09] It's hard to, we can't even comprehend

[36:11] how good virtual reality is gonna be in a decade.

[36:13] What that experience will be like

[36:15] and will be satisfying enough.

[36:17] Some people say yes, some people say no

[36:18] and I understand both sides of the argument.

[36:20] That will definitely have an impact.

[36:23] But like, what do you think the impact is gonna be on

[36:26] the like, Valley Williams error titles?

[36:29] Do you think those titles are going to go up in price

[36:34] or down in price?

[36:35] Let's say like five years from now, 10 years from now.

[36:38] As so many more, if new titles keep coming out every year

[36:41] as at the pace they are now.

[36:45] I do not see those titles coming down dramatically

[36:49] to be honest with you.

[36:50] I really don't.

[36:51] I mean, obviously they're not making any more of them.

[36:53] It was back in a time when they had huge budgets

[36:57] to dump into these games,

[36:58] to come up with all these really cool custom mechanisms

[37:01] that were really still not seeing in some games today.

[37:06] It was from a Renaissance period

[37:08] and I think that the titles that sell well from back then

[37:11] are gonna continue to sell well.

[37:14] I don't think that those machines are going to become,

[37:18] I guess as antiquated, if you will,

[37:21] as like the EMs did by the 1990s.

[37:25] I think that there's still a close enough tie

[37:29] in terms of the technology and the way the game actually plays

[37:33] to modern games that people are okay

[37:36] going from a modern game back to a game that's 20 years old

[37:41] or 25 years old.

[37:42] Yeah, some of them feel different.

[37:45] Some of them don't feel like they have as much going on

[37:47] or they're not as complex.

[37:49] But overall, I think the fun factor is still there

[37:51] with a lot of those games.

[37:53] So the speed of the games is still there.

[37:57] You look at the EMs from the 50s and 60s and early 70s

[38:02] up to the 90s and there was a huge gap in technology.

[38:06] So the question is, will we see a really huge gap

[38:09] in technology once again in the next 10 years?

[38:12] I think that the LCD technology is here to stay.

[38:16] It's not going away.

[38:18] I think that we will see more creative ways

[38:22] for it to be integrated into games.

[38:23] I think that the way that multi-morphic has integrated an LCD

[38:28] into making it interactive with the ball,

[38:31] I think they're onto something.

[38:32] Now, is there application the way that it will be carried out

[38:37] in a mainstream manner?

[38:39] I don't know.

[38:40] But I think that the concept of the ball interacting

[38:43] with an LCD, I think that that is an idea

[38:46] that will probably get some legs.

[38:49] And I could see that being a big deal in 10 years possibly.

[38:53] Right.

[38:54] Well, yeah, I mean, look, with what Jerry's doing

[38:56] with multi-morphic, he's building his platform

[38:59] and it's a new way to think about pinball.

[39:02] And who's to say like a few years from now,

[39:04] Stern does in acquire or work with his technology

[39:08] and make a game that is using his vision,

[39:13] as an offering for them.

[39:15] I mean, they're selling 10 to 12 titles at a time.

[39:18] Maybe they experiment with that type of technology.

[39:21] Maybe Jerry comes out and the game takes off.

[39:24] And his company grows.

[39:26] I mean, we don't know.

[39:28] Another question I have Blake in this short term.

[39:32] We have a lot of UTI companies that are popping up.

[39:34] And there's a lot of new to the game players.

[39:38] 10 years from now, do we think there's

[39:40] as many people making pinball machines

[39:42] or is it going to consolidate or is there

[39:46] going to be, because we know how hard it is

[39:50] to make pinball machines.

[39:52] Do we see all these guys in it for the long run?

[39:58] Making these pinball machines is incredibly difficult.

[40:02] And we've obviously seen a lot of growing pains

[40:06] with these machines and some of these manufacturers

[40:09] over the last few years.

[40:11] I really don't think that there will be a ton of manufacturers

[40:18] in 10 years.

[40:19] I think you're still going to have one or two giants

[40:23] in the industry, and then you may still

[40:25] have a boutique or two hanging around.

[40:29] I see a company like Spooky.

[40:32] And I don't just say this because of my involvement

[40:33] with Domino's, but I could see a company like Spooky

[40:38] staying the course and being successful

[40:40] and lasting over the years, because they're not trying

[40:44] to grow to become a juggernaut.

[40:45] They know what scale that they want to stay at,

[40:48] and they know what they can handle.

[40:50] And I think that they will continue to grow a little bit,

[40:53] but I don't know that they'll ever be a Stern.

[40:55] And I don't think they ever want to be what Stern is.

[41:00] I think that other companies that are rushing to become

[41:03] a new juggernaut manufacturer, I don't know.

[41:07] I think that they still have a long ways to go.

[41:09] So I'm not convinced that we're going to see

[41:13] more manufacturers in 10 years.

[41:17] I'm thinking we may see around the same

[41:20] if not a couple of fewer manufacturers

[41:23] than what we have right now.

[41:24] Right.

[41:26] Yeah, I agree.

[41:27] I think in the next couple of years,

[41:30] we're going to see winners and losers.

[41:32] I think that it's a tough business as you were saying,

[41:35] and it's at the point now too, or like boutiques,

[41:39] they need every pinball machine they make to be successful.

[41:42] And you can't afford a miss.

[41:44] Now Stern can have hit miss, hit miss, hit miss, and be fine.

[41:48] They can have a WWE and a Mustang in between a Ghostbusters

[41:53] and a Batman and still survive,

[41:55] because the money's still coming in on the other titles.

[41:59] But I think boutiques for them to make it,

[42:02] they've got to have themes that have long lasting

[42:05] universal appeal.

[42:07] And I'm going to say this, when I see a company like Dutch,

[42:11] it's like you're not going to survive making a theme

[42:14] that's pretty niche that is the game you want to make,

[42:16] but not the game that has the buyer base

[42:19] that you need to survive.

[42:20] Same thing with full throttle.

[42:22] You got to make a theme that has people saying,

[42:26] take my money before I even see it.

[42:30] Yeah, I mean, this concept of announcing a game,

[42:37] and it's not getting released for three to four years,

[42:40] it's not going to cut it.

[42:41] And I don't see how any business can last very long

[42:45] with a trend that continues that way.

[42:48] They've got to tighten their process up.

[42:50] I mean, they've got to have it really, really streamlined.

[42:56] And they got to pick titles that are always going to

[42:59] count unless they get into a mode where they've,

[43:02] you know, like Stern, where they can't have a few

[43:03] misses periodically.

[43:05] But right now, there's no other manufacturer out there

[43:08] that can afford to have a miss in my opinion, really.

[43:11] Absolutely, absolutely.

[43:14] It's going to be interesting to think about Stern

[43:16] over the next 10 years.

[43:18] And if they continue at the pace they're ahead,

[43:23] Bartime's like, are they just going to run out of licenses

[43:25] one day?

[43:26] You know, I mean, yes, they'll always make

[43:29] like current themes that are popular.

[43:32] You know, there's always going to be more Star Wars movies,

[43:34] right?

[43:35] There's always going to be more next avatars.

[43:36] There's going to be TV shows that become super popular,

[43:40] that they'll base the fun.

[43:41] Eventually, the nostalgia themes will run out.

[43:44] You think in the next 10 years, we'll start

[43:47] to see remakes of nostalgic themes the way Hollywood goes

[43:52] back and remakes a movie theme over again.

[43:56] Like, well, it's interesting.

[43:58] That is an interesting question.

[44:00] And I don't understand why Hollywood keeps doing it,

[44:06] because almost all the remakes and reboots that come out

[44:09] end up sucking, and they just aren't

[44:11] a successful.

[44:11] Very few of them have been successful.

[44:13] But I think when it comes to kind of rehashing classic pinball

[44:18] themes, I could see that working.

[44:20] I mean, for example, I would love

[44:22] to see an updated version of like back to the future.

[44:25] I'd love to see.

[44:26] I think it's a theme that lends itself incredibly well

[44:29] to pinball, just like Ghostbusters does.

[44:31] It's an overall great package.

[44:33] And it's one of those themes that was done all right back then,

[44:38] but it certainly could be done a whole lot better, especially

[44:40] with new technologies.

[44:41] So yeah, I definitely could see the potential for remakes.

[44:44] Now, with that said, I don't think

[44:47] they're going to go back and remake successful classics.

[44:50] Like, I really doubt they're going

[44:52] to remake a game like Adams Family.

[44:55] And when I say remake, I don't mean like what planetaries

[44:59] doing by just rebuilding the same exact game.

[45:01] I mean, making a new version of an old title.

[45:04] You know, so I don't know.

[45:06] I don't really see that happening.

[45:08] I think that games like Adams Family and Twilight Zone

[45:11] were done as best as you possibly could do them back then

[45:14] and probably even today, with the exception of adding LCD

[45:20] clips and stuff into it, which I don't know.

[45:23] I don't think that that would really make a huge difference.

[45:26] I mean, I would love as much as this game gets ranked really high,

[45:29] I would love another version of the classic Indiana Jones

[45:33] because that machine in me, like,

[45:36] it's beautifully presented and the integration's nice.

[45:42] It's so clunky.

[45:43] I can't get over the clunkiness of the mode start shot

[45:47] that is just impossible to hit.

[45:49] And it's a wide body with the shots that are so tight.

[45:52] It's, I would love to see someone just take another crack

[45:57] knowing that that theme can have so many different elements

[46:00] from those three movies and incorporate them

[46:02] in a different way using new technologies

[46:04] that I think could make that game better.

[46:07] Yeah, no, I'm with you on that.

[46:09] I do think that every time I play that game,

[46:14] I have more fun on it when it's a machine

[46:17] that's been very, very fine tune and it plays well,

[46:20] but I can't say I've played very many of those machines

[46:22] that play well.

[46:23] And if the game's not playing right,

[46:25] it's very hard to make some of the shots

[46:26] and it does feel very clunky.

[46:28] It's got some awesome mechanisms and toys in that game,

[46:31] but it's not an easy shooter

[46:35] and it's not one that I go back to frequently.

[46:37] But yeah, I wish that Stern's Indiana Jones,

[46:41] I wish that they had made that game more like in the 2012,

[46:46] 2013 timeframe when they started really making

[46:50] some better games like Metallica and Star Trek,

[46:53] games that really did the theme more justice, honestly,

[46:57] because unfortunately, their Indiana Jones

[47:00] still falls victim to some awful artwork.

[47:03] That's terrible.

[47:04] That's terrible.

[47:05] And I think that it's got maybe some better shots

[47:08] more flow to it, obviously than the original Indiana Jones game,

[47:12] but the arts more lacking.

[47:14] And so it still doesn't feel like

[47:15] the definitive Indiana Jones game.

[47:18] Well, that's interesting.

[47:19] Because Stern can always go back to their vault

[47:23] and they've learned their lesson.

[47:26] That artwork is the key.

[47:28] When you have a good theme, the next step

[47:30] is make the thing visually pop.

[47:32] And I think there's a whole error.

[47:34] There's a decade of Stern pinball machines

[47:37] that have shit art.

[47:38] And I think they're going to go back

[47:40] and do these like, and I was saying this earlier

[47:43] in another podcast, I think vault edition

[47:45] might be kind of dead.

[47:46] They're just going to re, they're going to tweak

[47:49] them a little bit with completely new art.

[47:52] And they're not going to be called vaults.

[47:53] They'll be like super addition of whatever.

[47:56] Well, it also gives them an excuse

[47:58] to raise the prices higher, because it's not

[48:00] the exact same game of what people were able to buy

[48:03] for $2,000 cheaper 10 years ago or whatever.

[48:07] Right.

[48:08] And I think they're going to do a lot of it.

[48:09] I think people were panicking over the last couple years,

[48:12] right?

[48:13] When Iron Man Vault came out, there

[48:15] was just like, oh, it's going to be Lord of the Rings.

[48:17] It's going to be Tron.

[48:18] We haven't seen any of it, right?

[48:20] We saw Spider-Man, which I think

[48:22] that they really made that game much nicer

[48:26] on a visual level.

[48:27] And the new toy is great.

[48:29] And now Batman is more like a new design and new layout.

[48:32] And a completely different theme from the one it's replacing.

[48:34] So really, really interesting to see where they go.

[48:39] I mean, I would, I'm not sure if Lord of the Rings comes out,

[48:43] like a Vault Edition with new art or tweaks to some of the toys.

[48:49] I'm not sure people want to keep going back, though.

[48:51] I think the future of the next 10 years is new stuff.

[48:54] I think that is a better play than remaking attack from Mars.

[48:59] If they remake attack from Mars like planetary pinball,

[49:02] I just don't see people caring that much.

[49:04] It's like medieval madness.

[49:06] You had a $15,000 pinball machine that everyone said

[49:09] was too expensive.

[49:10] They remake it and nobody really cares.

[49:13] Yeah, you know, honestly, I think that they really ought

[49:17] to just leave the old titles alone.

[49:20] And let's say you want to make a game that's attack from Mars,

[49:23] then make a new attack from Mars.

[49:26] Don't just rehash the original game.

[49:28] I mean, you know, I'm with you.

[49:31] I have mixed feelings about what planetaries doing.

[49:36] Personally, I'd much rather see them focus their attention

[49:38] on making games like Kingpin that hardly any people

[49:43] have ever even gotten to see in person, much less play.

[49:47] That's something that would feel like a brand new game

[49:50] versus remaking a game that most people have had an opportunity

[49:54] to play or own.

[49:56] So yeah, the prices are high on those original games

[49:58] like medieval madness and attack from Mars.

[50:01] I don't know.

[50:02] I guess it's sort of a very risk averse perspective

[50:07] like Hollywood has with movies today.

[50:09] They know that it's a guaranteed seller pretty much.

[50:12] It's a guaranteed success.

[50:14] And they don't have to, you know, there's

[50:16] not going to be much of a risk.

[50:17] But I bet there'd be a lot of people out there

[50:19] that would be interested in, let's say, sort of a reboot

[50:26] cool of attack from Mars.

[50:28] You know, maybe you take some similar elements

[50:32] that made the original game fun, but then you update it.

[50:34] You know, with some new stuff.

[50:36] So, right.

[50:37] But Planetary, as you were saying earlier,

[50:40] they fall into the bucket too of like company that

[50:42] makes you wait years before you get your game.

[50:45] And we haven't even heard them reveal title two.

[50:49] Maybe at Expo, they'll reveal it.

[50:52] So let's segue.

[50:54] Let's segue to Ghostbusters and we'll jump to Expo

[50:56] because the Ghostbusters thread, you know,

[50:59] there's like 10 of them.

[51:01] And there's, I want to kick something off.

[51:05] This is just how I feel about where the hobby

[51:09] and then the communities, it's so,

[51:11] there's so much negativity around this title

[51:13] that I just don't understand.

[51:16] This title is universally loved by the people who own it

[51:20] and universally critiqued by the people who don't.

[51:24] In a way that makes me feel like people just don't even

[51:27] want to have joy in this hobby.

[51:31] It's one of the greatest themes ever for a pinball machine.

[51:34] And the art package is one of the greatest ever.

[51:36] It has so many fun and unique toys and elements

[51:40] and sort of quirky, can't be shots in it

[51:44] that I think people are really enjoying.

[51:46] And yet there's just so much moaning and groaning about it.

[51:49] Why do you think that is?

[51:51] Yeah.

[51:53] I actually think that it's quite insulting for people

[51:56] to get on there and claim that it's the worst pinball

[51:59] machine ever made or the worst stern this ever made.

[52:01] I mean, come on.

[52:04] This game is a work of art.

[52:08] And I don't think that you and I both

[52:10] feel this way about the game because we're both getting one.

[52:13] It is a beautiful game and it has an overall amazingly

[52:17] complete package compared to other games that are out there.

[52:20] I think people have got sour grapes because some are better

[52:25] at playing at the others are.

[52:26] It's a hard game.

[52:27] It's not an easy game.

[52:31] I don't think that's an excuse to shit all over the game.

[52:35] I think that Trudeau and Dwight Sullivan

[52:38] and Zombie Eddie and everybody else involved with that game.

[52:41] I think that they put their hearts into it.

[52:43] And I really do think that they made one of the best

[52:46] machines, if not the best machine that

[52:48] Stern's ever made.

[52:50] Right.

[52:50] You know what another hard game is, Blake,

[52:53] that millions of people love?

[52:55] It's called Donkey Kong.

[52:56] Most people can't get past the first level of Donkey Kong.

[53:01] But they still play it.

[53:02] They still enjoy it.

[53:03] Same thing with Miss Pac-Man.

[53:05] You think people are not.

[53:06] These are not hour long gaming sessions.

[53:09] And these are the most popular video games of all time,

[53:12] arcade games of all time.

[53:14] And I love the fact that I see tournament players hop on

[53:18] Ghostbusters and the Magnus Link throws the ball down the

[53:20] middle and they start crying like babies.

[53:23] Yeah, I actually do too.

[53:25] And I've seen the same thing in my own league where people

[53:28] that are better will avoid.

[53:30] Now, it goes both ways.

[53:31] They're people in my league that are great, that will avoid it.

[53:34] Then they're people in my league that are also equally

[53:36] as great, but they play it because they want to learn how to

[53:39] play the game.

[53:40] They want to get better at the game.

[53:42] And they're not afraid of the spontaneous aspect of the game.

[53:47] I feel like the way people are complaining about it,

[53:49] it's like they want a game to be this sort of middle ground

[53:55] between being easy and being hard.

[53:58] I don't think there is a such thing really.

[54:00] I think that every game is designed the way that it's designed

[54:03] by the designers for specific reasons.

[54:07] The physics play out the way that they either intend them to

[54:10] play out or they just happen to fall that way.

[54:15] I think there's only so much that can be controlled in terms

[54:17] of the physics and the way the ball rolls on these games when

[54:21] they're designing these machines in a CAD model.

[54:24] So I don't know.

[54:27] I just think that I don't know if people are pissed that it's

[54:31] a theme they love and it turned out to be a hard game.

[54:36] I would think that they'd be more upset if it was a theme that

[54:38] they love that turned out to be an easy game, but it was just

[54:42] an awful execution on the machine.

[54:44] I completely agree.

[54:46] If people are having half hour ball times on Ghostbusters,

[54:50] they'd be moaning and groaning just as much that the game's

[54:54] not going to be a keeper because the ball times are too long.

[54:58] Yeah, I mean, would people really want to own a game that was

[55:02] so easy that they can beat it upon every evening or morning

[55:08] or whatever they play their machine that they get on it to play it?

[55:10] I mean, I think they'd get real sick of it really quickly

[55:13] if they can beat the pants off of it immediately.

[55:16] To me, the reason I keep pushing the start button on Ghostbusters

[55:21] is because I want to see those modes I can't get to.

[55:23] I'm not frustrated that I can't get to them or that I got a climb

[55:26] the ladder every time.

[55:28] To me, it's, I don't know, maybe you have to love the theme.

[55:31] Maybe there are people out there that get sick of hearing the same

[55:34] stuff over and over again, but I mean, come on.

[55:38] If you don't like it, don't play it.

[55:39] But to me, I love the deepness of the game and I love the fact

[55:45] that it's challenging and that's just going to make me love

[55:47] having the game over a long period of time even more.

[55:50] Yeah, no, I agree.

[55:51] And I think there's almost like an indescribable addiction

[55:58] or like to keep coming back for more, right?

[56:01] Because it's like, oh, like if you're a great player,

[56:04] you're like more than ever determined to get good at it.

[56:07] I mean, I was playing at Sunshine Laundromat the other day.

[56:10] And this guy was like really good player.

[56:12] He was like, he'd probably put in like 10 bucks

[56:14] into Ghostbusters and was like, I just want to get good at it.

[56:17] And that's a good thing.

[56:19] It's like, it's got to, it's a machine that will keep people

[56:22] coming back for more, maybe for years, maybe forever, right?

[56:26] It might just be that machine that always kicks your ass,

[56:29] but you just love it because it's fun.

[56:31] And that's pinball.

[56:33] People, it's, you know, it is a very addictive game.

[56:37] People can bitch all they want right now about the game

[56:41] for various reasons.

[56:43] At the end of the day, it's a timeless theme.

[56:46] The game is going to go down in history

[56:48] as one of the best pinball machines ever made.

[56:50] I don't question it all.

[56:54] I think that the number of those games that are selling,

[56:57] the fact that it probably is about to become

[57:00] Stern's best selling game if it isn't already,

[57:03] especially once they start cranking the premiums out,

[57:06] I think that speaks for itself, you know?

[57:09] So speaking of that, because I think the other side

[57:13] of the coin on why people bitch about the machine

[57:15] is the quality control issues, right?

[57:17] So that is sort of plague this machine on a different level

[57:22] and Stern's handling of the quality control issue

[57:25] around Ghostbusters.

[57:26] And so it's, they've never really come public

[57:31] with like their program for how they're going to fix people's

[57:34] issues with ghosted inserts and with chipped clear code.

[57:36] I think they're going to make everyone happy

[57:39] who has like serious issues.

[57:41] Like if there's a lot of chipping going on,

[57:43] those people should deal with their distributors

[57:45] and let Stern fix the problem.

[57:47] But here's all what I'll say about ghosted inserts

[57:49] and I said this before, ghosted inserts are part of Pimbal.

[57:53] Now you might have a machine that doesn't have any,

[57:56] but I'm looking at a thousand dollar CPR gold

[58:00] tails of the Rabie Knights reproduction playfield.

[58:03] These are, these playfields were built

[58:05] with more care than any playfields

[58:07] and there's a couple inserts that have minor ghosting.

[58:10] Does it ruin my experience?

[58:12] No, do I notice it?

[58:14] No.

[58:15] But if you look really closely, you'll see it.

[58:19] And I think a lot of people might have some ghosting

[58:22] and they need to not freak out.

[58:25] Yeah, yeah, the, there have been some,

[58:29] some justified, angry reactions that people have had.

[58:34] I, I do feel for the people who have, you know,

[58:37] already got chips in the, the clear code

[58:40] and the artwork on these machines that,

[58:42] that should not be happening at all.

[58:44] But the little bit of ghosting that's starting to come in

[58:47] around some of the inserts, especially where it's just

[58:50] a little sliver of it.

[58:51] I mean, I think those people, if that's all they've got,

[58:56] they should consider themselves lucky when they do look

[58:59] at what other people, you know, what's happening

[59:02] to their machines, not granted.

[59:04] I don't think that Stern should have a window

[59:07] for basically saying, if you only have minimal ghosting

[59:13] on your play fields in the next six months,

[59:16] anything that happens beyond that,

[59:17] we're not going to replace it.

[59:19] I don't think that's the right perspective.

[59:21] If it, if these play fields do happen to get worse over time,

[59:25] Stern needs to continue doing the right thing

[59:27] by, by fixing it, you know?

[59:32] You know, minimal gameplay on these machines,

[59:35] especially this early on shouldn't be causing these problems.

[59:38] They really shouldn't.

[59:40] And they know that and it's been,

[59:44] I get the frustration from the people

[59:48] and I was equally frustrated.

[59:49] I had a whole podcast on this.

[59:51] When Stern knew there was an issue,

[59:53] they were still shipping the play fields

[59:55] as they tried to figure out the issue

[59:57] because they had to keep the line going.

[01:00:00] I had a problem with that.

[01:00:01] I think there should have been a pause.

[01:00:04] It would have really hurt them financially.

[01:00:07] But this is the ripple effect, right?

[01:00:11] This is the reaction you're going to get

[01:00:13] from people is now there's going to be skepticism

[01:00:16] and a loss of credibility.

[01:00:17] And some people are just flat out angry.

[01:00:20] It's like you could have weighed it

[01:00:23] and now I wouldn't have to wake up every day

[01:00:25] and look at my ghostbusters and be pissed off

[01:00:28] that now I'm like, I know how fans get, right?

[01:00:32] Fanboys when they have an issue with their beloved toy,

[01:00:37] it eats away at them every day until it's fixed.

[01:00:42] Yeah, but you know at the same time,

[01:00:45] how many people were throwing money

[01:00:47] at a site unseen Batman 66 machine right now,

[01:00:50] even with these up in the air issues

[01:00:54] with the play fields going on.

[01:00:55] I mean, there are a lot of people

[01:00:56] that are complaining about it

[01:00:58] and there are some that have every right to complain

[01:00:59] but at the same time,

[01:01:01] there are a whole lot of people out there

[01:01:02] that obviously don't care that much

[01:01:04] because oh my God, they just announced a title

[01:01:07] that they desperately have to have.

[01:01:09] Right, well I think what that also shows

[01:01:11] is that the people who have really serious play field issues

[01:01:15] are still the minority of owners.

[01:01:18] And those people speak the loudest,

[01:01:20] they speak the most frequent

[01:01:22] and they rally the anti-stern people on the forums

[01:01:27] to scream too, but how many people really have poorly shipped

[01:01:34] to Ghostbusters or Ellie play fields?

[01:01:36] You know, let's say it's hypothetically 15 people

[01:01:41] out of 500.

[01:01:44] It might not even be that high, right?

[01:01:45] It might not only be five people,

[01:01:46] but we're gonna hear from those five people

[01:01:48] and they would have you believe

[01:01:50] that everyone who's getting a machine

[01:01:51] it's gonna be heavily flawed.

[01:01:52] And that's clearly not the case.

[01:01:54] I also think like people would rather not get shut out

[01:02:00] from Batman Ellie than, you know,

[01:02:04] then miss out because they're waiting to see

[01:02:07] if they fixed the quality control issues.

[01:02:09] So, because there's more of a pain of missing out, right?

[01:02:12] That now I have to pay a premium versus just,

[01:02:15] might as well just go in on it

[01:02:17] and if you have issues,

[01:02:17] the external probably help fix it.

[01:02:20] Exactly, yeah.

[01:02:22] I mean, I think that it just, I don't know,

[01:02:26] shows a few folks being a little hypocritical,

[01:02:29] but about the situation, but at the same time,

[01:02:32] I think you're right.

[01:02:33] I think that ultimately as big as these issues may worry people,

[01:02:36] they don't want to miss out on a specific title that they want.

[01:02:39] So, all right.

[01:02:40] All right, so we got a few more things we want to talk about.

[01:02:43] We're at the hour point, but we'll still like five more minutes

[01:02:45] Blake, like, so X-Boat 2016.

[01:02:49] It's gonna be an interesting smack down.

[01:02:51] We got Batman 66, we got Alien, we've got JJP.

[01:02:55] Do you think JJP number three is gonna be there?

[01:02:58] I think that Pat Lawyers game probably will be there.

[01:03:03] I think that there is a reason that Jack and Pat

[01:03:06] are gonna be doing a panel together.

[01:03:08] I think that it would be an unbelievable missed opportunity

[01:03:14] if they do not unveil anything at the shows this year.

[01:03:16] I mean, X-Boat was a pretty bad year

[01:03:19] in terms of reveals last year

[01:03:21] and now all of a sudden it seems like we're kind of

[01:03:23] having the complete opposite this year

[01:03:25] where we're gonna have tons of new stuff to talk about.

[01:03:27] But man, if JJP goes another year just riding out,

[01:03:33] oh, we've got the Hobbit, we're doing great things with the Hobbit,

[01:03:37] that's not gonna cut it.

[01:03:38] People are moving on the new stuff.

[01:03:40] There's too many other options.

[01:03:42] I agree.

[01:03:43] Well, my question is like, and I said it on an earlier podcast,

[01:03:47] I don't know because I still think he needs to milk

[01:03:50] the Hobbit as much as he can before money gets frozen

[01:03:54] and goes towards Lawyers game

[01:03:55] because he said he's not taking pre-orders on Lawyers game.

[01:03:58] So the question then becomes this,

[01:04:01] I think if they show Lawyers game,

[01:04:03] that game has to ship within like two to three months

[01:04:07] to consumers.

[01:04:07] It can't be, here it is coming out in 2018 or end of 2017.

[01:04:15] It needs to be, they need to be able to ship those games

[01:04:20] because if he's not taking pre-order dollars,

[01:04:22] remember, he's not seeing anything until games are shipping.

[01:04:24] So what good does it do you to show it

[01:04:27] and they make people wait a year?

[01:04:31] Yeah, no, you're right.

[01:04:33] They do have to, they absolutely need to announce this machine

[01:04:37] and they need to be ready to ship it

[01:04:39] within a few months, similarly to how Stern does it.

[01:04:42] But here's the thing, you know, at Expo this year,

[01:04:44] I feel like they're not only trying,

[01:04:47] as in-person maybe to save Hobbit sales

[01:04:51] by not announcing the next game or showing it,

[01:04:53] I kind of feel like they're at a little bit of a tipping

[01:04:56] here where they need to also focus on saving Jersey Jack

[01:04:59] pinball as well.

[01:05:00] I mean, this company has a lot of fans

[01:05:04] and they've established a lot of goodwill with people.

[01:05:06] They've built a couple of good games

[01:05:08] and I do like both of their games.

[01:05:11] They have tried to push the envelope

[01:05:13] and do some new innovative things,

[01:05:15] but at the same time, you know,

[01:05:18] they need to prove to people that they're not just a one

[01:05:22] and two pinball machine company

[01:05:26] per every five years, you know, type of a company.

[01:05:29] They need to, they need to show that they can do more

[01:05:32] than just that.

[01:05:33] So I think that they need to catch people's attention

[01:05:37] and granted, no matter when people release news

[01:05:40] or updates on these games,

[01:05:41] it does get a lot of press and attention in the hobby.

[01:05:44] But if they don't announce anything,

[01:05:48] then they're going to be walking away from this show

[01:05:51] with zero hype whatsoever because of the other games

[01:05:54] that likely are going to be shown, you know,

[01:05:56] and available to play.

[01:05:57] So, I mean, you're a marketing guy.

[01:05:59] You know the importance of these things

[01:06:01] and granted, you have to strategically strike

[01:06:04] when you're ready to, but at the same time,

[01:06:08] silence can be deafening.

[01:06:10] Right. Well, I think it's going to be interesting too.

[01:06:12] So like, are they going to actually have,

[01:06:14] if they do want to show Lawler's game?

[01:06:16] And we know this game has been worked on

[01:06:18] for a long time as well.

[01:06:20] So it should be done.

[01:06:22] I mean, I heard, the rumor I heard initially was like,

[01:06:25] Lawler was working on this game before Jack even approached him

[01:06:27] and the game was pretty far along

[01:06:29] and Jack just is like, okay, let's make this our third game.

[01:06:34] So I'm expecting this game to be near complete

[01:06:37] because it's been worked on for years.

[01:06:38] I don't think this can be like a work in progress kind of reveal.

[01:06:41] So it's interesting if they'll actually physically

[01:06:44] have the game there to show people as a surprise.

[01:06:47] As a marketer, I think that would be kind of awesome.

[01:06:50] I don't think we'll see that.

[01:06:52] But I also think what's going to be interesting for Jack,

[01:06:56] Blake is he's seen what Stern's doing here.

[01:06:58] He's seeing that Stern is able to now sell out of machines

[01:07:02] without even showing a goddamn thing, right?

[01:07:04] Based on theme alone.

[01:07:05] And these limited editions that Stern is super successful

[01:07:10] in getting people to jump in.

[01:07:14] Feverishly, Jack's Ellie model is terrible, right?

[01:07:17] These thousand editions of the hobby,

[01:07:20] 1500 of Smowk, it doesn't work for him.

[01:07:23] So it's interesting to see if he's gonna have limited edition

[01:07:26] or variations of Lawler's game,

[01:07:29] that's gonna create more of that demand

[01:07:31] and create more of a halo for a smaller portion of the title.

[01:07:35] Yeah, I mean, the concept of making so many LEDs

[01:07:38] that it makes everybody feel like that

[01:07:41] everyone gets to take a trophy home, you know,

[01:07:43] for participation or just because you can afford

[01:07:47] one of those model games,

[01:07:49] that completely defeats the purpose

[01:07:50] of there being a limited run, you know,

[01:07:53] or having an exclusive run of these machines.

[01:07:59] Here's a question, you know, is the Pat Lawler brand

[01:08:02] as strong as, let's say, a theme like Batman 66

[01:08:06] that people are really clamoring for?

[01:08:09] I don't know, I think that people love Pat stuff,

[01:08:13] but I don't think people are willing to drop

[01:08:18] that kind of money on a game,

[01:08:20] regardless of Pat's involvement,

[01:08:22] without knowing a single thing about it,

[01:08:24] you know, in terms of the name, the theme, whatever.

[01:08:29] So we know, so we can get away with it because of the theme.

[01:08:32] I don't think they can get away with it on Pat's game.

[01:08:34] Well, and look, I mean, I would say no,

[01:08:37] his Pat has had some humongous hits, right?

[01:08:42] Some of the best Pemble machines ever,

[01:08:45] Adam's family, Twilight Zone,

[01:08:48] Pat's also had his misses,

[01:08:51] and he's been out of the game for a long time.

[01:08:53] Now, so the expectations are through the roof.

[01:08:55] Now, part of me, if I were to be a betting man,

[01:08:59] I, knowing that this is an original theme,

[01:09:02] I think that's gonna be a hard sell.

[01:09:06] And the rumors we heard of,

[01:09:08] some of them were like natural disaster themes,

[01:09:10] some were like cell phone and technology theme.

[01:09:14] Who knows?

[01:09:15] I know that there's no way you can evoke

[01:09:17] the kind of emotional pull towards a game,

[01:09:21] like an nostalgic theme that speaks to people's childhood.

[01:09:27] It's the greatest pull there is.

[01:09:29] No, there's no way.

[01:09:30] And I'll say this, I mean, what certainly has peaked

[01:09:33] my interest on Pat's game is that it's not only once again

[01:09:39] an original Pat Law or theme,

[01:09:41] but it's hopefully Pat Law are back

[01:09:43] with a decent budget on a game,

[01:09:45] which he did not have really for any of the games

[01:09:48] that he did in the 2000s.

[01:09:49] So hopefully that combination will make for a really great game,

[01:09:55] but you're right, it's not a guaranteed sell

[01:09:59] like a specific theme that people have

[01:10:02] in a nostalgic emotional tie to.

[01:10:04] So I think that if the game, once they reveal it,

[01:10:08] if it looks great, then I think people will be on board with it,

[01:10:12] but they're not gonna just dive all in

[01:10:15] like people have on Batman 66.

[01:10:17] So I think that, and you're right,

[01:10:20] it'll be amazing if they have a playable game at Expo,

[01:10:24] but at the very least they need to show the game,

[01:10:26] they need to unveil what the name of it is,

[01:10:28] the theme of it and hopefully show something of that game

[01:10:31] because there's gonna be a lot of people with money there

[01:10:35] willing to buy a brand new machine

[01:10:37] and it's just a matter of which one is it gonna be

[01:10:38] from which manufacturer, you know?

[01:10:40] Right, and I'm just sort of digging into Pat Law,

[01:10:45] there's a library here, I'm trying to think which games

[01:10:49] were original themes of his that were really sort of knockout

[01:10:54] hits, right?

[01:10:55] So you've got World Win, Fun House,

[01:11:00] Buns I Run, Earth Shaker,

[01:11:04] but the big ones were themed, Adam's family, Twilight Zone,

[01:11:07] I mean, Roadshow wasn't really that popular,

[01:11:10] Safe Cracker, not really, no good gofers.

[01:11:16] Then he did some questionable games like Monopoly,

[01:11:21] rollercoaster-type games, anyone, Ripley's believe it or not.

[01:11:24] I mean, as you go, Ripley's was the best stern era game

[01:11:27] he did, although NASCAR is not bad,

[01:11:30] I've played it a number of times and I have to say that it's fun,

[01:11:34] I don't think it's a great game, but it's fun.

[01:11:35] I mean, I'll play it multiple times when I see a machine.

[01:11:39] But if you look at like his last titles, right?

[01:11:43] So you've got CSI, you've got Shrek, Family Guy,

[01:11:49] Grand Prix, NASCAR, Ripley's believe it or not,

[01:11:53] Rollercoaster-type-Hoon and Monopoly.

[01:11:55] So I think everyone would say that those machines

[01:11:59] were designed within a strict budget, right?

[01:12:02] That this was the era when Stern was pumping out stuff

[01:12:05] that was all about cost-cutting and survival.

[01:12:08] So you're right, I think this game is gonna be

[01:12:10] past sort of comeback effort.

[01:12:13] I do think there might be a little bit

[01:12:17] of a Chinese democracy effect here

[01:12:19] where he's gonna try and make his greatest game ever

[01:12:21] and might overdo it, which is hard,

[01:12:24] considering how much is in the Twilight Zone

[01:12:26] and when you think about overdoing a play field.

[01:12:29] But it's gonna be interesting.

[01:12:30] I mean, I wanna see it, everyone else wants to see it,

[01:12:33] but I don't think sort of Pat Lawler,

[01:12:36] original theme will attract people like Star Wars, right?

[01:12:41] Like Ghostbusters, like Batman.

[01:12:44] Let's end this episode with Star Wars.

[01:12:49] So what are your thoughts?

[01:12:52] In my last podcast, I alluded that distributors

[01:12:55] are lining up super long lists of people already

[01:12:59] saying take my money, which is not shocking, it's Star Wars.

[01:13:02] No, no.

[01:13:04] No, I guess let's hypothetically say, okay, it's Star Wars.

[01:13:10] It's arguably one of the biggest themes

[01:13:12] and franchises you could base a Pimble machine around.

[01:13:15] There's more reference material

[01:13:17] than you could possibly fit into a single machine with.

[01:13:22] Let's say that Stern has figured out that art sells

[01:13:26] and they've got a really killer art package

[01:13:29] on these games as well.

[01:13:32] I think that we've seen with Ghostbusters

[01:13:35] that they're definitely learning that.

[01:13:36] They've got artists like Zombie Yeti

[01:13:38] and Dirty Donny working on these things.

[01:13:41] Hopefully Batman 66 will be a cool looking game too.

[01:13:45] So I think they're putting stock in that

[01:13:47] and I'm not surprised that the games may already be selling out

[01:13:51] at all.

[01:13:55] I think it's crazy.

[01:13:55] But isn't that crazy?

[01:13:57] Like, Star Wars can be like a year from now

[01:14:01] and by the time anything even gets leaked or rumored,

[01:14:05] like I mean, people are gonna just be starting to get pissed off

[01:14:10] because if Stern knows they've already got like,

[01:14:12] let's say a thousand people have are on distributor lists

[01:14:17] and I'm Gary and I'm like, okay,

[01:14:18] I gotta price this thing now.

[01:14:20] And these people don't even know what it's gonna cost

[01:14:23] and they're already saying take my money.

[01:14:25] So I know the demand is well higher than anything

[01:14:28] I've ever sold before.

[01:14:30] All right, so then I'm gonna do another,

[01:14:32] I'm gonna do an L.E. that cost people 12 grand

[01:14:35] and I am banking that 75% of people just love this theme

[01:14:40] so much that they'll never wanna miss out on it.

[01:14:44] Yeah, I think that for as much people complain

[01:14:47] about the prices and how they keep going higher

[01:14:50] and higher, they're just feeding it.

[01:14:52] They're just feeding the industry more

[01:14:56] and they're making the things that they have issues with worse

[01:14:59] by doing that.

[01:15:00] I mean, when you're putting money down

[01:15:02] and saying you'll take one immediately

[01:15:04] without even seeing what it is,

[01:15:07] yeah, to me that's a signal that I'm sure Stern is seeing

[01:15:12] as wow, let's just keep pushing the onto.

[01:15:16] Let's see what we can do.

[01:15:18] But people are even more obsessed than that.

[01:15:20] I said this in the rare hero rant that I did.

[01:15:24] Here's a game, he's seen it,

[01:15:26] he doesn't even like it and he's still buying it.

[01:15:29] That's how obsessed people are with themes

[01:15:31] because he loves the theme.

[01:15:33] It's, I mean, Star Wars has,

[01:15:36] I think people get caught in the emotional tractor beam

[01:15:41] that is Star Wars, that it's like you can't even resist,

[01:15:47] but to buy it if you are a fan of that theme

[01:15:51] and you love Pimball.

[01:15:53] What movie is it gonna be Force Awakens?

[01:15:57] Like what do you think the machine's actually gonna be?

[01:16:01] You know, I think that essentially the pro model

[01:16:06] will probably be new trilogy stuff

[01:16:09] and I think they'll use obviously everything they can

[01:16:12] from Force Awakens and you know,

[01:16:16] by the time let's see the next movie,

[01:16:18] the next trilogy movie comes out next December

[01:16:22] or actually is the following May, I don't remember.

[01:16:24] It's next December.

[01:16:25] It's, I think it's next December.

[01:16:27] It's next December, it was supposed to be May

[01:16:29] but they pushed it back.

[01:16:30] Yeah, they pushed it back, that's right.

[01:16:32] So I can see them rolling some assets out

[01:16:38] from the new movie with the machine

[01:16:40] but I think it will be pretty limited.

[01:16:43] It's entirely possible that with everything

[01:16:45] it's been going on with the delays

[01:16:47] that maybe they just bumped the game back

[01:16:49] later in the next year so they can tie it more

[01:16:51] into the release of the new film.

[01:16:54] Going from let's say the pro model being new trilogy based

[01:16:59] into premium LE territory.

[01:17:03] You know, it was interesting that you mentioned

[01:17:05] about the the LEDs on your last podcast

[01:17:10] being, you know, maybe each base,

[01:17:14] maybe there's a model based on each

[01:17:16] of the original trilogy films

[01:17:17] and I think that it would be hard for it to work

[01:17:21] but I don't necessarily think it's out of the question

[01:17:25] in terms of if you've got a major toy like a Death Star

[01:17:30] that could span each of the films almost,

[01:17:35] you know, you've got the star killer base

[01:17:36] from Force Awakens that would be a similar looking device

[01:17:40] or however whatever the mechanism works like.

[01:17:42] And then you've got, you know,

[01:17:46] you've got the Death Star isn't two

[01:17:47] of the three original films, they could probably swap it out

[01:17:51] for something that might be Cloud City

[01:17:53] or Best Been Related.

[01:17:55] So I could see where depending on the complexity

[01:17:57] of the mechanism you could do these facade swaps

[01:18:01] to make it applicable to each respective film.

[01:18:04] And if the play field is an overall mesh

[01:18:08] of the trilogy as a whole but then the entire exterior

[01:18:13] and, you know, Translite Art Package

[01:18:16] is based around each of the trilogy films,

[01:18:19] I could see them making it work.

[01:18:21] It's a stretch, I admit it is a stretch

[01:18:24] but I think they know how much demand the theme is going

[01:18:27] to create, I mean my God, we're talking about people

[01:18:30] already buying this machine

[01:18:31] and it's not even announced yet.

[01:18:32] And I think they know they're gonna have to make more

[01:18:37] than, you know, 300 LE's worldwide.

[01:18:40] So I think a way to do that

[01:18:42] and to keep the numbers limited is to make maybe 250 new

[01:18:46] hope machines and 250 empires and 250 return of the Jedi's.

[01:18:51] I mean, you're gonna, I mean, for the diehard fan though, right?

[01:18:56] I mean, they're gonna want every one, they're gonna want

[01:18:57] every one and that's gonna keep you.

[01:18:59] And it also allows Stern to jack the prices up

[01:19:02] because they're exclusive.

[01:19:03] Right. And look, I think we're gonna see more

[01:19:06] whether it's Super Ali but I think as I was saying,

[01:19:09] if they make 10 variations that are just like Luke Skywalker

[01:19:13] with special whatever on it, it's the Star Wars fans will buy it.

[01:19:17] I mean, because this is the kind of machine too

[01:19:20] when you look at even just go on eBay,

[01:19:21] people are spending $5,000 on just Star Wars Lego sets

[01:19:28] that came out just a few years ago.

[01:19:30] Like a single Lego piece is five grand.

[01:19:34] So you're telling me, you dangle this in front of that guy

[01:19:37] who has everything in his Star Wars collection.

[01:19:40] This would be the ultimate like centerpiece

[01:19:42] for when people come over to see what he's got.

[01:19:44] So I don't know, we'll see.

[01:19:47] I don't think that's gonna happen.

[01:19:48] Just because I think it just requires too much adjustment of,

[01:19:53] I mean, Stern can't, the one thing they're still slow at is code.

[01:19:57] And so if we wanna do those variations,

[01:19:59] I just can't see them having the code.

[01:20:02] I'm with you on trying to wrap around the logistic aspect of doing it.

[01:20:09] But at the same time, I think that they're going to milk the models

[01:20:14] for this game as much as they possibly can.

[01:20:16] And so they'll end up building a ton of pros and a ton of premiums.

[01:20:22] Right.

[01:20:23] But why, I think if I'm Gary Y. Rush, right?

[01:20:26] Because if I look at, if I have the Star Wars license right now,

[01:20:30] I'm like, all right, Force Awakens pin.

[01:20:33] And this is a company, remember,

[01:20:34] they're making three to four to five titles a year now.

[01:20:38] Force Awakens pin, they're probably already gonna start development,

[01:20:42] maybe on a Rogue One pin, maybe on the Han Solo movie's coming out.

[01:20:46] There's gonna be a Boba Fett movie.

[01:20:48] Gary will just keep up with where the franchise is going.

[01:20:54] And if he has the rights, I think he's like, this is sweet.

[01:20:57] I'm gonna have a new Star Wars pin every two years that's based around the universe.

[01:21:03] So what if, and I think you're right,

[01:21:06] I think that this could very well be a long term prospect for them,

[01:21:12] just like Disney is looking at Star Wars and the Marvel universe

[01:21:15] as being very long term.

[01:21:17] But is it out of the question for Steve Richie to have designed?

[01:21:25] Maybe this overall perfect layout that can be modded and manipulated

[01:21:32] in just enough ways to be retrofitted for different models or different themed models.

[01:21:41] I don't know.

[01:21:41] I mean, it's very hypothetical.

[01:21:44] I don't think anything's really been done like that before.

[01:21:48] But it's interesting.

[01:21:49] We talk about getting as much money out of your investment as possible.

[01:21:56] Let's say you do all the legwork for one design, one layout, and you do all of that,

[01:22:03] and then you just change in art packages and maybe change some toys here and there moving

[01:22:07] forward.

[01:22:08] I don't know.

[01:22:09] But it almost just feels like then.

[01:22:13] It's like you're getting the new game plus it's vault addition on the same day.

[01:22:22] I just think people are going to want more variety.

[01:22:26] If I get a empire strikes back pin, I want it to be completely radically different looking

[01:22:33] than a return of the Jedi pin or a new hope pin.

[01:22:36] Look, I think if Stern goes and makes those three pins radically different, and it's

[01:22:43] also fun to think about them coming from different designers.

[01:22:47] I think that's what's also make the Star Wars movie so much fun is Lucas did the first

[01:22:52] one.

[01:22:53] He didn't do the second one.

[01:22:54] You give them to different designers and you get a little bit more flare.

[01:22:57] I would love to see Trudeau tackle a Star Wars pin minus the gap with the flippers.

[01:23:04] I think Trudeau to me, the toys are what I love in the way he thinks creatively and

[01:23:10] the way he did with Ghostbusters.

[01:23:12] Richie is much more of a flow guy.

[01:23:15] When I picture Richie and Star Wars, I feel more like I want to jump in an X-wing and

[01:23:20] it's all about flow and navigating through the Death Star, getting to blow up the power

[01:23:28] core of the planet.

[01:23:30] I don't expect to see as much use of magnets and mechanisms.

[01:23:34] I hope I'm surprised, but that's not really his style per se as much as Trudeau and some

[01:23:42] others.

[01:23:43] We'll see though.

[01:23:44] I think Star Wars, Stern knows how big it is.

[01:23:47] They're not going to disappoint.

[01:23:49] I think Batman is going to be a good indication of where they're going with mechanisms and

[01:23:55] rethinking layouts and designs.

[01:23:59] Star Wars is going to be even better.

[01:24:03] I agree with you.

[01:24:05] I actually do love your idea about allowing each of the different designers to take on a

[01:24:11] Star Wars machine.

[01:24:12] It's a great idea.

[01:24:16] I think it's a very exciting time for the pinball industry.

[01:24:19] I think Stern's doing some really kick ass stuff.

[01:24:22] The other manufacturers are doing some great stuff too.

[01:24:27] In the last 10 years, the bar has definitely been raised a lot.

[01:24:30] I'll say that about the hobby.

[01:24:34] For as much bitching as people do and as much things as they have, we're figuring out

[01:24:38] to complain about.

[01:24:40] We're in really great times right now and we really ought to consider ourselves lucky

[01:24:44] as pinball enthusiasts because it's awesome.

[01:24:48] Stern's doing some great, great stuff and I can't wait to see what they do with

[01:24:52] Batman and Star Wars.

[01:24:54] I'm thrilled to be a part of the hobby right now.

[01:24:56] I couldn't agree more.

[01:24:57] This hobby was on life support 10 years ago.

[01:25:00] If you were to tell people 10 years from now, this is what's going to be available.

[01:25:05] These are the options people are going to have and this is what the games look like.

[01:25:10] I think people would have considered you crazy.

[01:25:12] That's why for those people who bitch and moan and are like serial cry babies, you're

[01:25:18] going to get called out on this podcast.

[01:25:21] You're going to get the rare hero effect.

[01:25:25] That's why this podcast exists.

[01:25:27] Blake, I want to thank you for taking the time this evening.

[01:25:29] This has been fun.

[01:25:30] We're going to do this.

[01:25:31] Blake's going to become like a regular.

[01:25:32] I can feel this.

[01:25:33] This is like, we have like some good back and forth.

[01:25:38] There's always going to be enough news for us to sort of jump in and the next month is

[01:25:41] going to provide a plethora of new topics as we see Batman as we learn more about Stern's

[01:25:48] next pin, which is probably Erasmith as we see what happens with Alien.

[01:25:52] There's a lot of stuff that I look forward to talking to you about Blake.

[01:25:57] Thanks again.

[01:25:58] Yeah, no problem, Chris.

[01:26:00] Thank you so much for having me on the show.

[01:26:02] It really is a blast every time.

[01:26:06] I think we need to catch up again after Expo.

[01:26:08] I think it's going to be a really interesting October.

[01:26:11] Are you going to Expo?

[01:26:13] Man, I wish I was, especially after seeing what the Stern party is going to be like.

[01:26:18] It's going to be just a kick ass party it looks like.

[01:26:22] I wish I was, but maybe next year.

[01:26:26] I do want to get up there.

[01:26:27] I've never gotten to, actually, I've never been to Chicago and I've certainly never gotten

[01:26:32] to see the Stern factory.

[01:26:33] Those are things that are on my bucket list to do right now.

[01:26:38] Definitely in the future.

[01:26:39] Awesome.

[01:26:40] Awesome.

[01:26:41] I think this is going to be a good one.

[01:26:42] I was there last year.

[01:26:43] It was like, so-so, but this year is going to be phenomenal.

[01:26:46] Blake, thank you again and we're going to do this real soon.

[01:26:50] Sounds good, Chris.

[01:26:51] Thanks a lot.

[01:26:52] All right.
