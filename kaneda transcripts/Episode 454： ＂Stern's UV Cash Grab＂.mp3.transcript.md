[00:00] Alright, so let me get this straight. I bought a $9,100 pinball machine and I have to spend extra money to unlock features of the game.

[00:10] Let's talk about that on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] Alright, so someone explained to me how this news today that you can spend $280

[00:29] on a stranger things UV kit that gives you new plastics, a new apron, a UV light hookup,

[00:38] and it unlocks something that has been in the game all along that none of us discovered.

[00:44] Because guess what? We don't walk around with special UV light shining and on things to see if

[00:52] something is hidden there. So a little secret was revealed today that each stranger things game

[00:58] has special ink on it that is unlocked by this new kit that costs $280.

[01:07] What do we feel about this? Is this a cash grab or is this a really cool feature that people are excited to

[01:14] unlock in their stranger things game? Is it just lipstick on a pig? Does it make the game any better

[01:21] or not? So we're going to talk about that because you know I saw the stream and like many of you

[01:27] out there when you're watching it and you're there and I heard from Jack Danger that it looks

[01:31] really impressive in person. You know there's always going to be the initial complaining.

[01:37] There's going to be the initial cheerleaders I think it's amazing. And I think after spending a

[01:42] few hours thinking about this entire offering I've come to this conclusion. It is like going to see

[01:50] a movie that has 3D in it and then the movie theater after you buy your ticket the movie theater

[01:59] wants you to spend additional money on the glasses. And to me that is what is happening here.

[02:07] You bought the game. You bought the game with the features matrix that they told you the game had.

[02:14] Now there's another hidden feature in it and it's cool like people said from the very beginning

[02:21] that stranger things and you know should use some sort of UV or black lit technology to represent

[02:28] the upside down and low and behold here it is but you can't unlock it unless you spend this extra

[02:37] money. Now is that fair? Is that a cash grab? Is this a new precedent for what we can expect with

[02:45] pinball machines moving forward that we're no longer going to have everything the games you know

[02:52] been designed to give us on day one. It's not a mod. This was always part of the plan because if

[02:59] it was just the plastics and it was just the UV light and it was just the new things that you put

[03:05] on that glowed that's one thing but no they made every single play field with this UV ink.

[03:13] So that means this must have been the plan from day one and it just begs the question because

[03:19] this feature is cool. I mean this feature is cooler than the projector. It really is. It actually

[03:27] adds more of the ambiance of the stranger things world than that stupid projector. I'm serious.

[03:33] The projector is dumb. It's not necessary. This is much cooler. And this is never when we talk about

[03:42] something that hasn't really been done well in pinball before. It didn't really work well in

[03:46] predator but it looks really cool. But now it's like I just can't get over the fact that this

[03:55] wasn't put in the game on day one and part of the games launch. So then it really makes me feel

[04:04] like stern new from the very beginning that either they ran out of time and came to this decision

[04:11] to sell it later on or from the very beginning they knew that they would do this. And for those of

[04:18] you out there who are like why are people complaining about it? Why are they you know what's the big deal?

[04:25] It's only 280 bucks and it's 20 minutes of work. To those people I say it's BS that this game

[04:34] didn't come with all the features installed on day one and we have to pay extra. And this isn't

[04:41] like an unnecessary thing. I think everyone who has this game is going to want to upgrade with this

[04:47] this new kit. Now just think about it like this. If stern sells a few thousand stranger things

[04:56] so that's another 280 thousand dollars they're going to make. If only you know if if 1000 owners

[05:04] upgrade and you know that every single Ellie person is going to upgrade. So that's almost 150

[05:12] thousand dollars right there extra. And my point is I don't like this and I'll tell you why. I think

[05:21] this game always should have had the UV light installed at the factory. That's the other thing too.

[05:26] Now they have all these parts and why don't they just install them at the factory? Why didn't they

[05:32] just wait? I don't even care if they raised the price of the game by another 280 bucks. But I'd

[05:38] rather pay $9,300 for an Ellie that features this installed from stern and they tell me on day one

[05:47] here's what's in the game and here's why it's a little bit more because we have two new features in it.

[05:52] UV lighting and a projector let the buyers make the decision versus doing it this way. And now it's

[06:01] just stupid too because now you have now you have like an apron you don't need. Now you have other

[06:07] plastics you don't need like you're just going to chuck that stuff and it's what a waste what a waste

[06:12] of parts. And so you've got this thing that I don't know I don't like this. I mean it's just the

[06:20] beginning of stern doing this stuff now where we get Ninja Turtles and oh and by the way we left

[06:25] a space blank for for a lower play field subway you know mechanism right now it's just a clear

[06:33] plastic and if you spend another 400 bucks you can install it into the game I don't like it. I

[06:39] don't like it I think it's a cash grab I think it should have been in the game from day one and I

[06:45] think those people that are making excuses for this I don't get them I don't get these people that

[06:52] claim to be hobbyist and and they're looking out for stern's ability to make money it's like

[06:58] none of us are investors in stern pinball and you know who you are on pin sight always making

[07:03] excuses you don't you you are not gonna make money if stern makes more money off of us. How is

[07:10] everybody not on the side of the consumer here? This is screwing over consumers this you don't

[07:20] even know now if your game is done physically and before we didn't know if it was done codewise

[07:26] now we don't even know when a stern game will be complete and I just don't like it it's not a

[07:34] mod it's not a mod this thing was built for this feature this is much different than like ray

[07:42] guns and ghostbusters right they they never could get the proton pack mod right they never they

[07:47] never made that part of the game because they said they couldn't get it to work right this is

[07:52] clearly something that they got to work right that they had ready to go and they held it back

[07:59] to make additional money off of everybody I don't know how you think that's a good thing for pinball

[08:06] I don't know how you think that's a good thing for pinball consumers that we now have to spend

[08:12] an extra 300 bucks and take the games apart and also the reason why I think it's stupid is

[08:18] how many casual people out there casual pinball buyers that just walk into a distributor's office

[08:25] and buy a stranger things they bring it home they're playing with their wife and kids they don't

[08:31] want to have to take the game apart I don't care if it's only a 20 minute job they do not want

[08:38] to have to then modify the game to get this super cool feature to work you pinheads will do it

[08:46] but what about all those other people out there who's gonna install it or distributor is gonna

[08:51] install this thing for free I mean yeah it takes 20 minutes to do okay I just don't think this

[08:57] should have ever been done this way and is it a lipstick on a pig I really don't care how cool

[09:03] it looks I still would rather I would rather them have done the UV light I and and and just got

[09:11] rid of the stupid projector I would have done the UV effect and added two more toys or something

[09:18] more interesting into the physical elements of this game because remember again this is still not

[09:25] a physical thing that interacts with the ball it looks really really cool it looks cooler look

[09:32] when I see it going in full UV glory it looks much cooler than the projector does I just think

[09:39] the projector with the ugly white strips and the way it looks on different angles when it projects

[09:47] it's just not that neat it really isn't but this is something people would have raved about and again

[09:55] I think stranger things to me is going down as a game in which is a little bit all over the place

[10:02] like I don't really know what they were going for when Brian Eddie talks about wanting to create

[10:08] the atmosphere of the show I think the UV light thing nails it I think the projector stupid and

[10:15] it's almost like they couldn't make up their mind what stuff to put in and I really I just really

[10:22] don't know why this wasn't in this game from day one and that's that's my take on it I'm still

[10:29] not going to buy the game I don't it just doesn't feel like a game I feel like I need to own if you

[10:37] enjoy the game that's great if you love the game that's great if you love the game there's a great

[10:43] chance you're going to buy this and not even care right 280 bucks is not a big chunk of change

[10:50] for pinball buyers it's not about the money it's about the principle of what this means and what

[10:58] this could mean for games moving forward that you are now heading into an era in which stern pinball

[11:07] in which stern pinball can just change the game on you and charge you money to get things that

[11:13] you should have got from day one and it's a long line of of this happening now in pinball you now

[11:20] have to like spend all this money to unlock games to get things that we always used to get never

[11:27] used to have to pay extra for toppers you know there's just a lot of stuff in these games and I

[11:34] think we're spending enough where everything should be in it on day one I mean imagine if Pirates

[11:40] of the Caribbean was like well there's an upper play field pirate ship cool all right but if you

[11:45] want it to rock if you want it to rock that's another $250 motor and mechanism that you need to

[11:53] install to make that pirate ship rock back and forth it's just to be you can go through every

[11:59] single game all right here's a T-Rex if you want the T-Rex to move well that's an additional

[12:06] $500 and you can install the moving T-Rex you see what I'm saying it's just it can open up Pandora's

[12:13] box and stern if anyone's gonna do it it's gonna be stern they're gonna look for ways to save money

[12:21] to capture your money first and then get you to spend more money I don't like it I don't want more

[12:28] of this I think this is the beginning I think you're gonna see DLC coming from stern in the future

[12:35] oh games done games at 1.0 oh you want more modes we're gonna charge you money why wouldn't they

[12:41] do that if you're gonna spend money on this why wouldn't you spend another 300 bucks for another

[12:47] wizard mode or another journey in a in a game they're it's gonna start and it's not gonna end

[12:55] and this is going to be seen as the beginning I think of stuff like this now I could be completely

[13:01] wrong this could be a one-time only occurrence it could have been something that wasn't ready when

[13:07] the game was going on the line and they held it back but I think it is totally idiotic now that

[13:13] the game is on the line that this thing isn't just going into games from the assembly line like why

[13:20] see even now it's like if you're gonna order stranger things starting today why can't you order

[13:26] this installed at the factory I I think it's completely idiotic that your game has to come in you

[13:33] have to remove the glass and then you have to install this like it's stupid it's absolutely stupid

[13:39] do you agree do you disagree and that's it that's the topic on this short episode of Canatus

[13:45] Pinball podcast Stern has once again found a way to steal more of your money and you're gonna give

[13:52] it to them and they're never gonna learn a lesson and it's gonna be on to the next I mean it's

[13:57] crazy they're gonna make like three hundred four hundred thousand dollars on something that should

[14:01] have been in every single game that left the factory and if you disagree I think you're you're

[14:09] a moron okay come on wake up people you don't have to buy the 3d glasses you don't buy a car

[14:17] and then have to spend an additional money to get the steering wheel all right let's be honest here

[14:23] this should have been in the game do you agree do you disagree canator pinball at gmail.com no outro

[14:30] music just the number one pinball podcast telling you how I feel how I feel and what sucks is this

[14:38] you if you have stranger things you have to buy this like you have to buy this now there's no way

[14:45] around it you you can't not put this in your game and they know that like it's so unfair like they

[14:52] know that this feature is something that every single stranger things owner is going to want to have

[14:59] this isn't something minuscule and the game is coded for this like this turns on with the coding

[15:07] of going into the upside down and the more I think about that like that's garbage that you now have

[15:14] no choice but to give Stern more of your money no choice no choice at all you have to put this in

[15:22] your stranger things game they did it to all of us smart marketing if you're them smart let's

[15:30] let's create something that everyone has to buy or else they're going to feel their game is

[15:35] incomplete unbelievable you can spend $9100 with tax on top of that and shipping and your game is

[15:43] still not done people wake up 2020 get your head out of the sand and don't it sucks I'm even though

[15:53] I tell you don't do it you're gonna have to do it there's there it's a it's a lose lose it's a

[15:58] lose lose you're gonna win a cool feature but it's a lose lose in terms of like moving forward what

[16:03] we're gonna get from Stern pinball and I think other manufacturers are gonna look at this and take

[16:09] advantage of it because deep down they all know that the pinball buying community we are a bunch of

[16:15] suckers and and they keep testing to see how big we are of when it comes to being suckers and man

[16:21] take my money now because I need to unlock this feature it sucks like a nothing else to say on it

[16:26] canate a pinball at gmail.com tell me how you feel and I'll read some of your feedback on the air

[16:32] later if I want to stand oh I'll get another stand
