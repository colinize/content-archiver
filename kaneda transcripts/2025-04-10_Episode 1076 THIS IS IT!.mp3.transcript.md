[00:00] You can rely on the old man's money, you can rely on the old man's money, it's a bitch girl, and it's gone too far, cause you know it don't matter anyway.

[00:11] Some money, money won't get you too far, get you too far.

[00:20] Well, money will get you a Jersey Jack Pinball Collector's Edition of Harry Potter, which is gonna be $15,000,

[00:28] and you can order it today without even seeing the game at your distributors.

[00:33] So here's the thing everybody, look, I think Jersey Jack has done a really good job of keeping Harry Potter, hanging over all of these other launches like a dark cloud.

[00:44] They haven't had to make many moves, but every time they make a move around Harry Potter, it just steals the conversation.

[00:51] It's easily the biggest theme coming out, but I do think you have to have your head examined.

[00:58] If you ordered this game and gave a distro, a non-refundable $2,500 deposit, which is committing you to buying a $15,000 Harry Potter CE,

[01:15] when you don't even know what the game is, you don't know how many they're gonna make, why would you lock your money in?

[01:24] I think anybody who ordered already either is the biggest fan of Harry Potter, or just really has to have the game right away, because you know how I feel.

[01:35] I feel this game is gonna be great, I do, I think they're gonna nail it, but I also, I don't think you're gonna have to spend $15,000 to get one,

[01:44] if they make unlimited amounts of CEs, or they open up the order banks for an unlimited window of time.

[01:52] I really don't. I think they're gonna be making Harry Potter CEs over the next three to four years, and every time there's a little lull, they're just gonna run a few more.

[02:02] That's what Stern does, that's what Jersey Jack is gonna do with this game.

[02:07] Now, it is Thursday, and we know Harry Potter's around the corner, we know King Kong is around the corner, we know Barrel's a Fun's New Game is around the corner,

[02:16] and we know Predator is around the corner, but nobody's making a move really other than Jersey Jack, think about it.

[02:23] Nobody cares about Barrel's new lighting system or non-reflective glass, everybody.

[02:29] Stop using non-reflective glass as a teaser for your game.

[02:35] Nobody cares. All these games that are around 10 grand or more should come with non-reflective glass.

[02:46] Don't tell me this is now a new reason why to choose you.

[02:51] It's par for the course, and if games don't come with non-reflective glass, then yeah, that's a really cheap move by a company that's kind of ripping us off.

[03:03] You should not have to pay extra for this, and the fact that now everybody's got their own name for their like glass, it's PDI glass, it's Voodoo glass, it's this glass, it's so stupid.

[03:13] It's absolutely so stupid. Wizard vision, whatever they want to call it.

[03:17] Oh, Canada's going to launch his line of non-reflective non-glass, and you know what that is? You pay me 200 bucks, I come over your house, I just take the glass off, and you play the game,

[03:27] and it'll be the clearest you've ever seen that day on Playfield. $200 coming at you in 2025.

[03:32] Canada's non-reflective non-glass. What that means is no glass whatsoever. I give you the best bang for the buck in Bimbal, and now I'm going to remove your glass, and you're going to pay me to do it.

[03:43] So, there's a lot of talk around this image that's being shared around, and I shared it around, of the shooter knob of Harry Potter with the logo of Jersey Jack and the trademark for Warner Brothers.

[03:57] I think that's an official asset from the game that was given to Zach over at Flippin' Out. I think they gave it to him, and they allowed him to release it.

[04:07] Now, you don't see Flippin' Out anywhere on the image, and I think it's a smart move. Think about it. They give the image to Zach. We know Zach and Ken are friends. They get the image out.

[04:17] Everybody's using it. Everybody's running with it. It's not driving people to one distributor or another. It's not showing any favoritism.

[04:25] It's just a great asset to get the word out that this game is coming, and you can order yours today, and also think about it. I bet JJP has a timeline they've agreed to upon with Warner Brothers of how the release will work when assets will go out.

[04:43] So this was a smart move because none of the Harry Potter assets, not that image, is anywhere near an official channel of Jersey Jack Pimbal. If you go on Facebook or Instagram, you're not seeing that image.

[04:57] So real smart move by Ken and the marketing team. Slide that over to Zach. Let this be on everybody's radar, and let orders open up, and it doesn't look like we've already started our Harry Potter marketing.

[05:11] Also, when you think about it, this game's not coming out next week. Harry Potter is not coming out until May, but when you think about why they're doing this and why they're doing this right now, it's so obvious the amount of respect Jersey Jack has for Keith Elwyn.

[05:31] Like Harry Potter is a 10 times bigger theme than King Kong. They shouldn't have to move first at all, but the fact that they are shows so much respect to Keith and what he's capable of because they know that he can make anything magical.

[05:51] He can make anything amazing. And so they're getting out in front of his game without even showing their game. And they're using the power of the theme absolutely. But man, what respect Jersey Jack has for Keith Elwyn by moving in front of him.

[06:10] And notice how Stern doesn't have to do anything. When you have the King Kong of designers in your corner, you don't have to do anything. They're not teasing that it's even Keith Elwyn's next game.

[06:24] He is the greatest modern pinball designer, and they're just waiting, ominously waiting in the shadows. What do they got? Is it going to be packed? Is it going to be the next Godzilla? I think it's going to be Godzilla and then some.

[06:41] I think it's going to be way better than Jaws. Look, Jaws is a great game. It's a very, very great game. And the reason why Jaws is great is the theme integration is amazing. But Jaws is severely underwhelming in the area of art.

[06:58] It's underwhelming in the area of toys and mechanisms. Yes, it is still embarrassing to this day that they made a Jaws pinball machine where Jaws doesn't eat the ball. It's also embarrassing that upper play field looks nothing like the orca.

[07:18] I get that Jaws shoots great. The theme integration is amazing. The music, the call outs, the clips, everything's in there, right? There's no muted clips in Jaws pinball. The rules are amazing. And that's what makes Jaws so amazing, right? As an experience, it is amazing, but it is not. It is not on the same level as Godzilla when it comes to toys and mechs.

[07:42] So I think King Kong is going to have big mechs. It's called King Kong. I think it's going to be loaded. You know, we're not talking about who's on the art package of King Kong. Is it going to be zombie Eddie? I think it is. I think it is.

[07:58] I think it is. Zombie Eddie is very prolific. And I think he wants to be on the king of the monster games that Keith Owen makes. So he did Godzilla. I actually think Yeti's art style is better for Kong than it was for Godzilla.

[08:13] Look, we know we're not going to get our dream of it looking like an old King Kong movie poster. They're going to make it colorful. They're going to make it more modern, more contemporary, more comic book style. This game is going to be released in less than a week. And they haven't had to do anything.

[08:30] The media day is on Thursday. The distors are going to see it on Wednesday. And maybe we might see a leak. I don't know, sometime on Tuesday. We're definitely going to get that teaser video tomorrow. I'm so curious about what happens tomorrow.

[08:44] Because I think we might see three games remind us of their coming presence. And I think it's going to be Harry Potter might drop something tomorrow. It's definitely going to be King Kong and our friends over at barrels of fun, man, they need to do something.

[09:02] I don't know, man. I don't know. David finally got back to me on text message. David, thank you so much. I just think they need to get people hyped. They need to get people excited and they haven't done anything. And I think they're making a big mistake.

[09:16] And I think David, you got to remember David, Carrie Hardy and I, even though the content wasn't the best, we hyped Alice's adventures in Wonderland, and we sold all 500 of them in the week the game was revealed. You know what Melvin did? He gave Carrie and I different assets and gave us a window to kind of get stuff out.

[09:41] Now look, maybe we teased out Alice too long, but I don't understand why they're not giving us anything. Why wouldn't you give Carrie, Zach, me, retro Ralph, Don, loser kid, electric bat? I mean, I could go down a list. Todd Tucky. Why aren't you giving us now something? You don't have to show the whole game. We all know that it's like most likely Dune. You're giving us nothing.

[10:11] And so then you're going to cram it all in to this tiny little window now. You haven't controlled the narrative. You haven't managed expectations at all. And then by the time you do anything, Keith Elwin's Godzilla is going to pummel you.

[10:27] If that doesn't pummel you enough, then Harry Potter is going to take his magic wand and shove some lightning bolts up your new games. But, and you're doing nothing. And I don't know what your plan is. And I mean this when I say this gang over at barrels of fun guys, come on, come on.

[10:45] I want to see some hype. You know, they use the word hype like it's a bad thing. I'm going to tell you right now. Like what scares me about barrels is every time I talk to my friends over there and they're listening right now. And I'm like, how excited are you guys for your game or your next game? And the response is always like, well, you know, we're working really hard. And we know that some of our titles are going to be for some people.

[11:06] Everybody's going to like what we do. And I'm like, how is that a response? How is that a response? When you ask me if I was running barrels of fun, like, oh man, you're going to want this game more than anything. Like you got to hype it. Even Jack Winari hypes his games even when he knows he's got Godfather next.

[11:25] He's going to say it's the greatest game he's ever made. And hey, it's the job of marketing to get people excited. And all you're showing us is a lighting system that looks exactly like the lighting system that's in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I'm not seeing any innovation there and nonreflective glass. And that's all you're going to do.

[11:47] Meanwhile, there's a Harry Potter image going all over the place and you've got nothing, nothing. And again, I keep coming back to this thing. They must have the greatest game ever. And they must be so confident about it. And they're going to call me up on Tuesday and laugh in my face that they knew they had the biggest banger ever.

[12:11] And, Canada, all of your anxiety and all of your fears were unfounded. It's either going to be that or I'm going to be the one laughing. And you're going to be the one laughing. Because this is it. This is it. Like next week is it, man. There's no more hiding. There's no more ducking cover. This is it. Next week, it's put up or shut up. All the blowhards like Canada and Carrie Hardy.

[12:36] It doesn't matter what we say. We're going to get to the point where the rubber meets the road. And this is it. This is what we've been working on. This is what we think is worth $10,000. This is the best value in pinball. This is it. Spooky pinball don't care. They got their popcorn. They're chewing on their popcorn. They sold all 888 evil debts. They're coasting all the way to December. And then they got freaking Beetlejuice.

[13:04] I want to be in the hot tub with Bug and Luke sipping champagne. These companies, they're minted for the next two years. And meanwhile, we got barrels of fun. They've got to be nervous about the next two weeks. And this is why it all comes down to theme. It comes down to how you build your brand. It comes down to transparency.

[13:24] You can't write barrels. You can't write on a Facebook post that you're transparent and nobody even knows who you are. Have you guys heard from any of these guys? Where are they? Where's Brian Savage? Where's David Vaness? Where's my boy Blake? Guys, where are you? Where are you? You just can't go in and finish the game. And that's building a brand. Should have hired Canada. You could have hired me. They could have done this. They could have said, hey, look, Canada, here's what we're doing.

[13:54] What are we going to do? How much money do you make on your podcast a month? And I'm like, all right, guys, this, right? Oh, yes, not as much as it should be, but it's more than everybody else, right? That's the vibe around my monetary intake. And they should have said, look, we want to buy you out. Yeah, we want you to sell out for two months and do nothing but get people hyped about this game.

[14:15] And I would have been like, you know what? I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll sell my integrity for twice what I bring in. And I guarantee you, I will sell you more games. You will make more money through me than you will make if you do what you're doing now, guys. Seriously. And it's not hard because they're doing nothing.

[14:33] If you think that all it takes is the game, you're wrong. You only get there when you're Keith Elwin. You know, you only get there when you've got a theme like Harry Potter. So we'll see, man, I love this. I love this. I love jabbing my friends at barrels. I mean, I know they're upset. They're like, oh, man, but they're good guys. They're good guys. But boys, turn on the marketing. And David, don't pick a theme. Don't pick any theme that you don't feel confident yours truly, Canada, is going to win.

[15:03] I love because I represent what most people want. I will admit, King Kong is a good theme. It's not the best theme, but it's a good theme for pinball. Rick and Morty is a good theme for pinball, right? Harry Potter, Back to the Future, all good themes for pinball. Heck, even Evil Dead. It's not a terrible theme for pinball.

[15:23] It's not a great theme, but it's a good enough theme because it's campy and it's weird and it's a cult classic. I would not land on Dune because Dune is slow. Dune isn't exciting. Dune doesn't have energy. And like, I would rather do tremors than Dune.

[15:42] Now on paper, Dune made so much more money than tremors, right? But tremors is so much more fun. And pinball needs to be fun. All right, we shall see. We're a week away. We're a week away. And that's where we're at, ladies and gentlemen. Tonight, I head to Scotland. I'm going to my brother-in-law's wedding. I'm going to have a lot of fun. I know some of you are wishing for a drunken canada rant from a wedding. It seems to be something I normally do.

[16:12] We're going to be about five, six hours ahead. Will I still do the Saturday morning spectacular? I don't know because Saturday is the day of the wedding, so I highly doubt it. But you know me, I might have to pack up my podcast gear because stuff's going to happen. I get back into the States Monday and then it's all going to happen.

[16:31] I'm going to be back next week. Don't worry. I'm going to be here covering everything. It's about to get real. Kong. You know the game we don't talk about at all as predator, right? Like, where's pinball brothers? They keep sharing this image of something's in a box. You know, it's not going to be in that box, pinball brothers. Any money. You're not going to sell these things if you don't start getting stuff out there. And if you don't have Arnold dead on arrival, dead on arrival.

[16:56] And I think there's a 99% chance now they don't have Arnold. I really do because think about it. If all they needed to do was stay on everybody's radar, all they would have to do is release a sound clip of Arnold saying get to the chopper and Jengus and I would buy every single one of those games. That's all they got to do.

[17:19] They're not using anything right now to get us excited. What's the deal with the marketing around pinball games? Y'all are terrible. The only one doing anything is Jersey Jack. Really, the only one doing anything is Jersey Jack. The rest of you, if you were my marketing departments, I would fire you. Even Stern, I would fire you guys. You're doing nothing. You can't work on a game for a year, year and a half. And you get right down to the finish line and you do nothing. That is pathetic.

[17:48] It makes my head spin as a marketer. Everybody, canadapinball at gmail.com. If you want my marketing skills, let's make a deal. Let's make a deal. Like I'll be a freelancer. You could hire me to help you freelance launch your game. I mean it. It wouldn't just be me here like blowharding about your game. No, it's like creating assets, working with the different content creators to get them assets.

[18:12] Yeah, watermark those assets. Give them exclusively. Time it out. Get people excited. Think about how you want to open your order banks. You know, the other concept of like order banks, no one even thinks about this. Why do you have to sell every game right away?

[18:26] Why don't you think creatively about how you take orders? Creatively about how you tell someone what game number they got. They don't do anything. It's lazy and it's going to bite some of these companies in the butt because I think unless you've got Keith Elwin and Harry Potter, I think everybody else needs to get stuff going and they're not. Nobody cares about your non-reflective glass.

[18:51] Everybody's going to buy Canada's non-reflective non glass. I come over your house. I take your glass out. You smash it over my head because he's a crying baby that didn't win a Twippy. That's how you treat me. Everybody happy Thursday. Love you. Canada out.
