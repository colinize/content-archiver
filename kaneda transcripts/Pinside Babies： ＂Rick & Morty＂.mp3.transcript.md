[00:00] You know the drill people, it's an episode of Canadian Spin Side Babies explicit language is to follow

[00:07] So if you have children or wives or you yourself are easily offended, please turn off this episode of Canadian Spin Ball podcast right now

[00:30] I

[00:32] Want to dedicate this episode of Canadian Spin Side Babies to all of you 50 gentlemen out there who bought an Elvira Signature Edition

[00:41] Do me a favor take that piece of couch and you know where to shove it stupid morons in this hobby they're everywhere

[00:48] I can't avoid them you read Pinside you get dumber you hear people's reaction to things and you get stupider

[00:56] Yeah, bye bye bye. No, no, no, no think people

[01:00] Think for a fucking second alright here's a thing I want you all to think about

[01:05] Rick and Morty Pimball it is revealed to the world by spooky Pimball and it is amazing how just a contemporary theme

[01:13] That has a lot of fans and people are really excited about how

[01:17] Immediately dropping something like that into the old cramudge and old fart hobby like Pimball how it becomes this like

[01:26] Divisive thing and here's the thing here's the thing I don't know about you people out there

[01:30] But you know what a normal person does when they see people get excited about something a normal person who

[01:38] Has like a normal life and normal balance and has had sex within the last 20 years a

[01:44] Normal person when they see people get excited about a property or a theme you know what they say to themselves

[01:51] Okay, I'm gonna check it out because I want to feel excited

[01:57] Like those people over there that are doing back flips for this theme and it's

[02:02] Unfucking believable to me that when people here

[02:05] People's excitement around Rick and Morty they they turn it off they tune it out

[02:10] They don't want anything to do it that they want to say it's a horrible theme that spooky's making a mistake

[02:14] They're not gonna sell games people are so fucking stupid so stupid

[02:18] They are going to sell every single one of these games and look. I'm the first one to admit

[02:24] I've never seen a single episode of Rick and Morty, okay now the next logical thing for me to do the

[02:33] Synaptic fucking elite my brain is making is I am reading people's

[02:39] Estatic response to this game and I'm saying holy fuck I've missed out on something that fucking nerds like me

[02:47] Fucking love and so I'm not gonna run to Pinside and say

[02:51] Remember what are they doing? Why can we make more themes from the nineteen fucking sixties?

[02:55] I'm gonna I'm gonna say hey, I'm gonna get on Hulu binge watch Rick and Morty and see if I love this show

[03:03] Just as much as other people now and then you hear like what the show is about it's about like a fucking

[03:10] Back to the future kind of inspired sci-fi show with super incredible writing that's supposed to be funny and

[03:17] These people can't be wrong and it's not just the fucking idiots on Pinside doing backflips that can't be wrong

[03:25] Millions and millions of people fucking love the show and hey for you Pinside babies out there do something

[03:33] Fucking use Google do some research before you immediately just need your react on social media on a forum

[03:41] Hey, I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do any homework

[03:43] I'm not gonna even try this before I give an opinion about this, but that's fucking Pimbo now, right?

[03:49] Everyone's got a fucking opinion before they even try anything

[03:53] I mean the games almost probably already fucking sold out you haven't even seen it people haven't even fucking seen anything

[03:59] And it's probably already sold out. I mean I at four fucking thirty in the morning

[04:04] I went on to the fucking fang club on spooky Pimbo and I signed the fuck up

[04:10] Why oh shit my alarm is going off. That's probably chucked selling me. Hey good fucking choice Chris

[04:15] Because I woke the fuck up and I said to myself why not sign up for the fucking fang club

[04:20] For 45 fucking dollars a year and at least have a shot at getting it if I turn out to love the show and I want one

[04:28] Because they're gonna be fucking caught 750 and that's it. I love it

[04:33] It's fucking limited you finally get a fucking limited game that's actually limited

[04:38] Based on a theme that millions of people love and what is there to fucking complain about nothing and the best part about it

[04:44] I love Chuck's fucking response where he's like look

[04:47] We're gonna make this many and that's it and we always just want to make sure that we bite off as much as we can chew because we

[04:54] Never want to turn into a situation where we have to fire people we're a family business and I'm telling you

[05:01] I'm telling you think Gary fucking Stern has that mentality you as Gary fucking Stern

[05:06] Which is what what's he what game does he love the most you know his responses the game that makes me the most fucking money

[05:12] And that's all they care about it's the fucking money

[05:14] You know, I really I really have turned a page on spooky because I you know

[05:19] I think they're gonna put the passion into this game and the other big fucking point is that this game is being made

[05:25] With the founder of the fucking show

[05:27] It's not gonna be an an asset disaster like so many pinball machines we've experienced recently

[05:33] This guy is gonna put everything in it custom call out. It's not like you know Chuck has this

[05:39] They find a way to connect with the creators of the stuff they're making games on

[05:43] I mean all I do is see photos of Chuck with like Alice Cooper and Rob Zombie and now this guy and and and Scott

[05:50] Denise he's making it what the fuck is there to be upset about on any level?

[05:55] I'm happy only

[05:57] 50 it's a theme that people love and it's gonna be fucking made and it's coming out now

[06:02] This isn't like this game's like six months from now. Oh, here's a here's a here's a prototype of our game that you can't fucking her for six months

[06:10] And who knows what the final fucking package is fuck that?

[06:13] This is how you do it and for fuck's sakes finally a couple of themes that are relevant and contemporary

[06:22] I mean we have Rick and Morty and stranger things coming out in December of

[06:27] 2019 thank you fucking God

[06:29] Thank God can we finally get some stuff that's relevant today in the pinball market stuff that kids enjoy today

[06:37] I don't know I don't know if you let your kids watch Rick and Morty, but you know what I'm saying?

[06:40] I mean enough of the fucking Elvira

[06:44] Monsters Batman 66 I mean it's like shit that like old cram engines are into I mean seriously

[06:50] When you read some of these pin-side fucking idiots talking about Rick and Morty and these are the guys are going all

[06:57] Google for Elvira

[06:59] I mean the last breath these guys have ever held over the last 30 years of fucking turkey breast on Thanksgiving

[07:05] And that's why they get so excited looking at Elvira like oh we got to go back to that that yeah, that's great

[07:11] Oh, I get it. That's her thing who cares who fucking cares? I mean seriously

[07:17] Rick and fucking Morty I know you know what I'm excited that people are excited because I don't even fucking I've been seeing the show

[07:24] But I just love watching people try to get upset about something that they don't know anything about we'll wake up and fucking learn

[07:31] Are we are we all so fucking

[07:35] preoccupied that we can't go fucking learn a little bit we can't go watch something and here's a thing

[07:41] I think when we watch it you those of you who haven't seen it yet

[07:46] I think we're gonna fucking love it. See I don't think it's gonna be like iron maiden

[07:49] I fucking hate iron maiden music like you couldn't pay me

[07:53] To listen to like

[07:55] That's shit socks. It's socks compared to like guns and fucking roses and motley crew

[08:01] I think iron maiden sounds like shit. It's sound to me. It sounds like like like like it's a cover band

[08:07] Like a spinal tap like it's like they're making fun of metal music. I mean seriously. I don't like it

[08:12] I have such a strong aversion against it, but at least I listened to it

[08:16] I tried hard to get into iron maiden music and after listening to it

[08:21] I think it sucks, okay, but Rick and Morty I haven't seen it

[08:25] But I think it's gonna be easier for a comedy show that's an animation

[08:30] Based around back to the fucking future where they traveled through different dimensions

[08:34] I think it's gonna be easier for me to enjoy that and welcome it into my nerd kingdom

[08:39] Then iron maiden music so I think people are gonna probably discover that maybe there's just something out there in this world

[08:47] That you didn't know you would like, but you will like if you give it a shot, okay?

[08:53] Don't be like one of those those assholes who was like I don't I don't like lobster

[08:57] Well, did you try lobster? Never tried it. Well go fuck yourself if you're one of those people because it life is too fucking short

[09:04] To not try and expose yourself to new things that you might fucking enjoy

[09:08] Okay, and I just want to say congratulations to spooky pinball forgetting a license theme that people are doing back flips for

[09:17] Congratulations for building your pinball company at a scale in which you can manage everything

[09:22] They've always got people their games when they said they would and now they're in the big leagues

[09:29] They are they they have they have landed a theme that millions of people like and they're gonna have way more demand than supply

[09:36] And it's gonna turn out to be a I think a special pin for them

[09:41] Scott Denise he's making it people love fucking Scott Denise

[09:44] He's one of the smartest mother fuckers in pinball and he's for some reason this guy so fucking smart

[09:51] He the only dumb decision he made in life was to work in fucking pinball because he could probably be like an

[09:57] Astrophysicist or working at Google making millions, but he's doing what he loves and I think he has a lot of support

[10:04] His first game TNA was it was a great hit that came out of nowhere

[10:07] I mean I mean stern pinball wanted it. They wanted Scott Denise and he said nope

[10:12] I'm gonna work with this family company and I think he made the right decision now

[10:17] Of course we haven't seen a fucking big I mean it would be fucking funny after all this hype

[10:22] I thought they're all this fucking hysteria

[10:23] But that the gay day show is just a fucking complete turd, but I don't think it's going to be

[10:28] And I think it's really exciting that we're getting this game and then stranger fucking things coming out

[10:33] Like a few weeks later and I love that they released it now

[10:36] It was like why not get ahead of all the stranger things hype and get this game sold

[10:41] Now what will we see when sales of this game come up are using me thousand dollars not refundable?

[10:46] Who knows who knows but 45 bucks to have a shot at it? Why fucking not?

[10:50] I'd rather join the fang club than the stupid stern insider bowl shit

[10:56] I mean what is bowl shit like I'm gonna pay money to get a fucking Nate shivers podcast like behind a fire wall

[11:03] What the fuck is that?

[11:04] Where is the fucking outcry with that stupid and that fucking t-shirt?

[11:09] You look like a fucking like a broke college kid painting a house when you wear that fucking stern insider

[11:15] T-shirt and they have nice fucking t-shirts

[11:18] So you pay money to join a club where you get shit shit content shit ever you don't get anything

[11:24] You get you get first crack at buying their games. I mean to me

[11:28] That's the best part of the spooky fucking fan club you get to cut the line because you're paying money

[11:34] And you're like a die hard fan great. What do you get with stern? Oh you get early?

[11:38] Yeah early like an hour early you get information that then goes out to the fucking world

[11:43] Unfucking believable and I fucking love stern two don't get me wrong. I fucking love stern

[11:49] You know stern story though. It's so like yeah

[11:51] We're gonna go get the biggest themes in pinball and then we're gonna figure out how to make these games in a way

[11:57] That doesn't give you any the fucking assets you want. Let's see what assets we get with stranger things

[12:02] I hope we get them

[12:03] I hope they fucking have like all the clips from the shows and the movies and the songs

[12:07] But we're gonna see they're gonna be judged on that okay? All right, what else is going on?

[12:11] Fucking people here's a fucking funny thing for you on this episode of Canadian babies

[12:15] Um, and you know, I look this is this I'm gonna fucking just do it cuz I do it all the time

[12:20] I'm not gonna do it on this episode

[12:21] But you know, I think I know I think I know pretty well what American fucking pitmars

[12:27] Next title is why do I know it now December what fourth or fifth is it December 5th?

[12:32] I know I I have pretty much

[12:36] Confirmation on what the next American pinball title is why do I fucking know it because they told a fucking distributor

[12:42] What it was gonna be and you know what distributors fucking do they fucking talk and they have loose lips and they tell their best

[12:48] Customers who they trust and it's so fucking stupid it happens time and time again

[12:52] You know, it's darn doesn't do they don't tell their fucking distributors jack shit about what's next they don't know anything

[12:59] Because they would all talk half the fucking distributors have like podcasts now half of them are trying to get the scoop

[13:05] It's it's so the cat's not gonna get back in the bag now the question is will canada reveal to the world

[13:11] What the next American pinball title is and spoil their reveal at GPF?

[13:17] That's the you know it email me canada pinball edgmail.com

[13:21] I'll put up a poll on my Facebook page should canada reveal what he thinks is the next American pinball title to the world yes or no

[13:29] Should he let Joe Busser have his moment in four months or should he do it now and email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[13:37] All right, I just want to close out this episode of canada's pinball babies, you know by saying something saying something just you know

[13:43] Heart to heart with all you guys out there. I really I really want everyone to just sit down and do me one favor in this hobby

[13:50] Please please I know we don't always come across like this canada and stride in with all this language

[13:54] Please do me a favor everybody just wake the fuck up. Please just wake the fuck up. That's it. That's all I ask wake up play the games before you

[14:03] Fucking buy them don't fucking buy overpriced shit

[14:06] Is it like seriously if you could do one favor for me in 2020?

[14:10] Don't pro by overpriced shit

[14:13] Don't run at everything and fucking buy stuff that has nothing fucking in it if you do that

[14:19] We will continue to get fucked by manufacturers

[14:22] They will put less in the games and then charge us more money. It's a fucking epidemic, okay?

[14:28] Now stern pinball, you know who's buying most of stern pinball games?

[14:31] I bet most of their games are sold in the pro format to people who don't know what the fuck pin side is

[14:36] They've expanded pinball to new buyers just rich guys with houses that just want a toy in it

[14:43] You have to have somewhat of a good financial backing to buy in your life to have five six seven thousand dollar

[14:48] Non-essential toys, okay, but just wake the fuck up wake the fuck up, okay?

[14:53] Make sure you get enough for your money. I mean when I see people unbox a fucking Willy Wonka collectors edition

[14:59] Okay, yes the top her looks like an oompa loompa took a giant shit on top of your machine

[15:04] It does it even looks like the the form of shit, right?

[15:07] But besides that that game is fucking stunning stunning. It's beautiful

[15:13] It's absolutely beautiful. It's a work of fucking art

[15:15] If I could get over my version with with the code problems in it if I was a Willy Wonka fan

[15:21] I mean it's it's fucking wonka artwork that you can play it's fucking stunning and then I look at a virus signature edition

[15:29] Piece of shit in comparison and it's more money. Oh, but it's only 50 50 my ass

[15:34] Same fucking game people wake the fuck up. It's the same game for eight like was it eight thousand nine thousand dollars

[15:41] You're gonna spend seven thousand dollars more for the same fucking game for some foil on the fucking sides

[15:48] Wake the fuck up and

[15:51] Understand that half of the people that are talking to you

[15:54] Convincing you to go in on these games are trying to fucking sell you the games

[15:59] Selling you the fuck like seriously. Oh, I love the Star Wars topper. I don't take easy arguments

[16:04] It's not gonna take the hard argument that it's a great get the fuck out of here that that Star Wars topper is

[16:10] Probably costing Stern fucking a hundred bucks to fucking assemble get the fuck out of here people wake the fuck up

[16:16] All right, this is how we would talk if we were doing the super awesome Pimbo podcast every fucking episode my god

[16:24] Christopher Branchy that shows up

[16:26] Shows up they need some canada on that show. I mean, I don't know how those three guys are gonna fucking maintain it

[16:31] I really don't I heard what episode it's kind of like it's like all these segments going on all this production value

[16:36] But man, I don't know. Well, it's just something something else needs a shot of fucking canada

[16:41] You know, you got a fucking jab that show with one of my fucking twippies and let's get some fucking energy in it

[16:46] It's like either go all fucking in like this like just go all in like we can bring the energy

[16:51] We can bring the excitement if we did this every episode

[16:53] I wouldn't have as many listeners, but man

[16:55] You got to decide which way you want to go man

[16:57] Do you want to be a fucking R rated movie then fucking be the best R rated movie ever or or do what I normally do
