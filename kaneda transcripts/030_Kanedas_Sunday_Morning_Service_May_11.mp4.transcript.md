[00:00] All right, we alive. We alive. The sun is coming in. We're a little late. We're a little

[00:09] late to our own party. But, you know, I had to get some stuff together. It's Cassian's birthday.

[00:16] Let me, I need to go get my glasses. The glare. Hold on.

[00:30] All right. Guns of Rose is still in the house. You got one dude here. Happy Mother's Day.

[00:51] To doobies. Good morning, Anthony. All right. Oh, man, hold on. Let's have problems today.

[01:13] We're going to go forward with it. There we go. All right. There we go. That's better.

[01:21] Barcelona. Let's share this with everybody. We're going to be an hour show today because a little bit over an hour, but not hour and a half.

[01:31] Because I, I've got to get ready for Cassian's party today. We're doing a nice little get together. A small group.

[01:39] But it's always a good time to celebrate one year on this planet with little Cassian. He's going to be one years old on Tuesday.

[01:52] Oh, let's do this. We're live.

[02:02] Good to do.

[02:14] Is that it? I think so. All right. Let's see who joins this party today. It is Mother's Day. So I hope all of you have called your mother's.

[02:25] I want to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the mamas out there. Retro jengos in the house. Tebow was a.

[02:34] Tebow is just in exercise in patients. Like they're they're just going every which way the kids like nobody knows what's going on.

[02:43] Oh gosh. My mom is coming over today. Got together yesterday with all all three siblings had an amazing reconciliation recently with my older brother, which has been absolutely more valuable to me than anything else going on in my world right now other than my little baby.

[03:06] But man, when stuff gets put in perspective in life, you just sort of like, I don't know, man, it's easy to just kind of relegate these things to what they are. Damn toys, people. They're toys. They're not changing lives.

[03:21] All right. Here's here's the thing.

[03:28] First I want to let everybody know that I have some information on Pokemon from Stern Pimball. It is coming. It is Pokemon.

[03:35] It is not next. It is most likely Jack Dangerous title. But I have some information on what's done is planning around that game.

[03:42] You will get that. You will get that on Patreon and a podcast probably tomorrow.

[03:48] So you're going to get it exclusively. I'm not doing an exclusive unboxing like Carrie Hardy. I mean, I love Carrie, but he's feminist lately like with these like exclusive King Kong, I'll leave videos but dude, like nothing's really exclusive like the games out there. Everyone's got it.

[04:04] Like here's what it looks like without the side armor exclusive.

[04:08] Here's what it looks like if I lift the play field exclusive. Here's what it looks like if I do a handstand next to my game exclusive.

[04:22] I don't know man, I feel like Pokemon isn't, it's not, it's in my like realm of obviously if Japanese stuff as I wear Maracom, he's Ellie Dodger. What's up babe?

[04:37] Okay, hold on, go. Oh Brenda, Brenda, you caught it.

[04:44] Sexy Brenda walking by. Yeah, so you know, I talked to Retro Ralph last night and he's got Kong Ali and evil dead and guess which game he was just like this is the one.

[05:00] Canada. I don't know if he's going to be comfortable with me saying this but he's like evil dead man, he's like this game.

[05:07] It's just true. It's just such it's so much more right now out of the box evil dead is much more of an occasion than King Kong is.

[05:17] And I think everyone's realizing that it's just it's just a much better overall game.

[05:22] And the jig is up on Stern's lazy corner cutting approach to King Kong. I'm sorry but like it's just it is what it is like there's you have three games that all look the same.

[05:37] All the arts the same the Ellie Ellie trim stuff is uninspired.

[05:43] The code is not there. The game is like a jumbled mess right now and then you walk over to evil dead and it's so beautiful looks better.

[05:53] It's got way more mechs in it way more toys. It's ever the details are all better in it.

[06:02] I mean, King Kong's got a subway car that doesn't even work right like it.

[06:07] It Kong's supposed to like hit the subway car up and the balls are supposed to go out the front right now the balls are popping out the back.

[06:14] It's like that did they even test this thing.

[06:17] And you know you buy an evil dead there's only eight hundred and eighty eight that will ever be out there only forever.

[06:24] You buy a King Kong there's there are more at least of King Kong and then there's thousands of premiums are going to make and thousands of pros and they all look the same and congrats.

[06:35] I think it's part of a club that nobody feels is special.

[06:39] So it's just it's just over it's over.

[06:42] It's over the sales are the sales are bad.

[06:45] The game is not there and I think the L win army tried its hardest to convince us otherwise and I think they've been silenced because in the end.

[06:57] I think everyone's realizing the truth about this entire hobby is that collectors are the most important audience in all of pinball.

[07:04] The home buyer collector is the most important audience to keep stern pinball going it's not operators it's not tournament players who want to win twenty three dollars in a translate after three hours of their lives it's home buyers.

[07:21] And what we're witnessing now is home buyers all waking up and flexing their power that they don't feel like they want to support anymore the approach of a mass market product that has turned its back on collectors.

[07:42] And when once you lose that enthusiasm it's hard to get it back you don't just win back people you know damage to a brand last a long time and what's done doesn't realize is the humongous damage to their brand stuff like two thousand dollar toppers has done the people stuff like Ellie is all losing three to four thousand stuff like James Bond sixty of being greedily pressing.

[08:11] Being greedily priced at twenty grand stuff like walking away from back to the future all these things collectively add up to a company that has seemingly hit its peak and is significantly on the decline in terms of making the right moves as an organization to keep those home buyers happy.

[08:31] And it's not to say that the games are still fun it's not to say that you know you're going to enjoy flipping them but they just don't feel like ten thousand dollar or more products.

[08:41] And and gang like you got to remember when you get a stern premium and by the top and by the accessories and by everything that would come from a boutique on day one if you buy everything a stern premium is like twelve to thirteen thousand dollars.

[08:58] So like you got to remember that like we're not idiots we're not I don't want that who wants that.

[09:07] So with the limited run of Alice this will be collectible instantly Alice is more collectible than any stern because of the small amount of games being made but I talked to someone went to coin taker played Alice dune king calm.

[09:23] They walk they called me objective person they're not in on any of these games is a Chris.

[09:29] Hands down Alice is one of the most beautiful games ever and people that were there were just blown away by like just the stunning nature of the game.

[09:37] And so really positive I mean Alice is successful and what Alice has set out to do you got to remember Alice.

[09:45] And Alice wanted to make a working version of a foam core game and make it beautiful and they they succeeded in that it's a stunning game to stand over is it as good as the other games no is it have the code no is but is it is that what it's meant to be no I think everyone who buys an Alice knows exactly what they're getting into now the reason why I don't think Alice is are going to go like up in value but I also don't think they're going to like lose three to four.

[10:14] I think is is just the game is not great enough.

[10:19] But it's it's so you know I'm saying so I think people who own it will lose like a grand to 1500 but they're not going to lose 4,000 on them.

[10:31] Maybe though maybe right I don't know right there's so much stuff out there.

[10:36] I don't think Alice is like a you ever going to be hard to get I think so when something's not hard to get then you know you really chip away at its collectability especially in pinball right remember you can call something a collector's addition or limited edition that does not make it collectable.

[10:53] But right now I think evil dead is the game I would buy to collect I don't think evil deads are going to go up for sale very often I think evil dead is the beginning of a new period in spooky pinball and I think a lot of collectors if you think about it people like to collect certain brands like people have been collecting

[11:10] the most expensive ones for the longest time I think the Stern collectors are the ones that are scratching their heads right now because if you're a Stern collector and you bought all these Stern Ali's over the last 3D 4 years 3 to 4 years if you bought them all you you got destroyed.

[11:28] Now if you bought Stern Ali's from circa 2014 to 2020 you love life every Ellie you bought went up in value some double then value you know what I'm saying so Stern had this entire collector community where every buy they made between 2014 and 2020 six years a six seven year run of absolutely every Ellie like hit.

[11:58] And the last 4 years if you stay to Stern collector you got decimated who did that did they did it to themselves and now the opposite right if you collected spooky pinball machines at the beginning you lost money on everyone they're not desirable things have changed I think this is the new beginning of a shift of which companies collectors will look to to buy games from.

[12:28] And I don't think it will be Stern anymore I know what themes barrels of fun has in the hopper those games are going to sell out day one day one I can't wait for you guys to hear what they have like they're going to I'm literally going to buy both and not buy them the scalper flip buy them to keep for life dream themes for canada

[12:58] dream themes Stern doesn't have them Stern made John willick Stern made venom Stern made D&D Stern made you know go down a list of all these games Stern made venom I say venom are ready I you know King Kong with no assets

[13:19] You know and we're about to see again I mean you look at evil dead and you start to think what what happens when these guys do beetle juice what happens when you give Christopher franchi goonies or beetle juice or gremlins you give mr. franchi you give bug you give Luke you give that team you give Ben heck you give hilton you give Miguel Jones it's the same person you give that team of people over there now that is so passionate about pinball and you give them dream themes

[13:46] and they sell out in an hour like they're already sold out beetle juice is already sold out if you're not on a list for beetle juice you're not getting one

[13:56] canada doesn't have to be on anybody's list I cut every list I love it when people get met how you how why do you get one because I made 1,800 and nine I'm adding too many there I made 1,090 podcast about pinball over the last 12 years what did you do cheat goonies

[14:16] go nothing you just went on pinside and you displayed to the world your alcoholic tendencies the best part about pinside right now is watching Neil McCray and ice man Mr. Doug Mo junior fight it out I've never seen a better battle in the history of pinside watching ice man versus Neil McCray you guys got to go check that out now

[14:42] like I don't pretend to have ice man money but ice man man he's like he you know that money matters he's it's his flex but man Neil

[14:55] Neil runs circles around them I'm on I'm of course I'm on team Neil because for some reason every time every time ice man mentions my name is gotta say such disparaging things I have no ill will towards Doug Mo junior or Neil McCray

[15:09] it's just funny watching to grown men with money just fight over pinball like literally I'm too busy owning one machine having a having intimate relations with a beautiful Irish beauty queen Brenda yeah I'd rather have that then fight with these guys on pinside I think I think everyone needs to get some more action you know if you know what I mean she'll she'll

[15:34] them out I'm not doxing ice man hits his name what do you mean doxing ice man everyone knows his name is Doug it's not a secret that's not a is that doxing someone is that doxing someone just saying who their name is no doxing someone is here's his home address here's where he works here's his boss's email come on that's my doxing someone get the hell out of here with that I know what the line is believing no one's I've been the victim of being dox multiple times people

[16:03] don't don't tell me what doxing is find out his last name everybody knows who he is geez it's not it's not a legal to tell someone's full name that's not doxing now would you guys agree yes or no if you say someone's full name that's doxing ridiculous ridiculous I know most of your full names if I if I if I say them out loud that's that that means

[16:33] what alright so here's the deal with noon here's the deal with doing I also heard from my guy that went over there I heard that don't is a is showing really well he said the flippers were strong I think people are looking at do now you know every week you get more and more curious about it because the reality that it is done is not.

[17:03] reality and that sort of, yeah, I will say like theme

[17:09] disappointment wears off. It just wears off and then you start to be like, all

[17:13] right? It's not so bad. Looks like a lot of theme integration going on. Looks like

[17:21] they got the actors from the movie to have their voices synced up with the

[17:25] clips. That's pretty cool. Oh, the music is amazing. This is a this is a sound

[17:29] track for a, you know, a billion dollar franchise. That's the game sounds

[17:34] incredible. The mech looks incredible. The overall game when you stand over it

[17:40] looks really nice. I mean, they have their own version of Radcals. Really looks

[17:44] good. So it's it's it's I think June slow burn. Gonna be a slow burn. I don't

[17:57] know if they're gonna sell all thousand. I think when they get all the clips in

[18:01] and people actually start playing it. I here's here's here's my take on

[18:06] June. I think it's gonna be more interesting to own a doon than a King Kong. I

[18:13] mean that for you pinball people out there. I just think you'll have more fun

[18:19] on something unique and new versus more of the same from Stern. And I think

[18:24] again, I just feel that's the vibe is I just you know, I think I feel the same

[18:28] way about evil dead. It's like if everybody's just been hyping and shilling

[18:35] this company's games and it you have you noticed the amount of like arcade

[18:39] one up guys now making pinball content. That was their strategy. And I'm not

[18:44] talking about retro. There's another guy like cool toys or something cool toy

[18:48] guy. And it's like they get the views, but like they don't nearly get the views

[18:53] they had when they were doing like arcade one ups. I mean arcade one up audience

[18:56] was like 70,000 people. You do something pinball related. You get like five to

[19:02] 10 grand in terms of views. But but that's what's crazy to me is I watch these

[19:07] guys like Hawking King Kong's 10,000 views and they still can't sell 932

[19:17] L's. That's that's embarrassing. Like right, it just goes to show you like the

[19:24] real marketing you need to do is not post launch. The real marketing you need to

[19:28] do is before launch. Because if you get all the marketing decisions right before

[19:32] launch, then you don't have to worry about marketing the game after you launch it

[19:36] because you've done all the hard work and you made all the right decisions and

[19:39] the game would sell out. You know, Kong was easy. Kong was an easy decision. It

[19:45] should have only been 500 units for the LE and they would have sold them all. And

[19:48] and everybody would be looking at them. So a little bit differently. I still think

[19:53] Stern is just like they can't walk it back. They they made bad marketing

[19:59] decisions and they just can't walk them back. And they just keep doing the same

[20:04] thing every launch and it's old, it's stale and it's boring. And I hope the

[20:08] new CMO shakes stuff up. If I were certain, you know what I would do? Can I can I

[20:15] tell you what I would do? Canada here. Only been doing marketing for 24 years.

[20:23] Here's what I would do. It's the easiest thing to do. If you really want to get

[20:28] Ellie from the back. You know what I would have done?

[20:34] King Kong, Ellie. We're only making 250 of them. We just we just decided.

[20:44] This is a really, you know, really a unique game and we only want to make 250

[20:50] Ellie's. We know that we've been over supplying and we just want to, you know, we

[20:56] want to cut it. If you're not happy with that, here's the premium. Get it back instantly.

[21:08] Guys, do me a favor. Let's not just talk about Doug or Neil. Okay. Like

[21:15] everyone's going through something in life, man. Everyone has their own outlets.

[21:19] Everyone finds their own quantum of solace. I am not one to throw stones at people who

[21:25] have a few drinks and post and rant and rape. Alcohol will make people do that.

[21:31] You know, I am I am up as someone who does like make mistakes in my own life.

[21:37] I think everyone is far too critical of people's behavior, especially when they

[21:43] look, no one's getting hurt. And that's my point. Like if you want to get wasted and

[21:47] argue with other out of shape white men around the world about Pimble, that's your

[21:53] prerogative. As long as you don't get in a car, right? As long as you don't hurt yourself,

[21:58] someone else, your family, get abusive with your wife, you know, you got drunk.

[22:03] You're a dude and you it's your outlet. Like he might be dealing with stuff and you know,

[22:07] what he knows what people are dealing with. And I do encourage people out there to, you

[22:12] know, have a little bit less fatalistic views on people.

[22:17] Everyone's got their vices. Everyone has to find an outlet. And you know,

[22:21] as someone who's been indicted and canceled by some people for throwing a drink in someone's

[22:28] face once, like whatever. Like I don't wish I didn't do that. But I was in a moment.

[22:36] And I it wasn't, you know, I wasn't like a victim, but it was also wasn't

[22:42] unprovoked either. Like so, but again, like there are people that won't forgive me for

[22:47] that. That was seven years ago, seven years ago. Since then, I've been married. I've

[22:52] kids like this. I bought a house. I like bought other cars like I've made another 700 shows

[22:59] about Pimble. Nope. I'm still glued by these people. So it is what it is. But I'm not going

[23:06] to, again, I'm not going to pretend I know any of these people. And neither should you.

[23:12] That's my, my request of everybody here. You don't know these people. You don't.

[23:18] And money doesn't make the man. You know, a lot of these people have so much money.

[23:23] And I think they just don't know what to do with it. They're bored. These things don't

[23:28] feel the void. These Pimble machines. Alcohol's fun. You know, like, here's the thing about

[23:34] alcohol. Real simple. And your 20s, it's, it's really fun. In your 30s and 40s, it's like

[23:42] fun, but it's a problem. It's not, you know, and then when you're like in your 50s and

[23:50] older, like, and you keep drinking a lot, like, then it's just a problem. It's not fun anymore.

[23:55] And it's hard to find the balance because when you, when do you have money, that's the

[23:59] problem with all of it. You just, you just, no one can tell you know, like, you have time,

[24:04] you have money and your board, because there is not much else to do, especially if your

[24:09] kids are grown, I don't have that. My kids are just beginning. So I have another 15, 16 years

[24:15] of, of being a dad. So I'm not looking to get crazy drunk more than one night a week.

[24:23] All right. So the thing is this. Here's the, here's the thing. Let's talk about Star Wars

[24:34] episodes one through three. Let's talk about whether or not we think Star Wars episode one through

[24:42] three could be a hit if John Borg does it. And is it that, is it a Darth Vader pin? Is it

[24:50] skeleton crew? Out of all those, I want to just say that I 100% think a Star Wars episode one

[24:57] through three will be a smash hit for Stern. If, if done right with that dual fates music and the theme

[25:05] song, it, well, they did not do, they all they did was the first movie, right? Didn't they just do

[25:12] Phantom Menace was the pinball 2000 game? I think we're going to see, I think we're going to see

[25:22] something special. I think pot racing. I think you got the, you know, the Darth Maul you're going to

[25:30] have Yoda jumping around. You're going to have Millennium Falcon in it. No. Now Falcon appears

[25:42] in New Hope, Guadal, yeah. I don't know. I think, I think all you need is a,

[25:57] you know, and then you've got like a thousand games sold.

[26:03] So I don't know. I think, you know, if Stern's got Star Wars and Pokemon, man, I mean,

[26:09] those are, those are the pretty much like two of the biggest IPs in the world.

[26:15] Star Wars is, you know, I will say episode one through three is kind of being looked at now a lot

[26:21] differently because of the annoyance of all these Star Wars TV shows. I think we look back on the

[26:29] movies very fondly now and we kind of are forgiving of a lot of the mistakes of those films because

[26:36] I will say this. I remember seeing a tack of the clones at the Zigg Field Theater for a special

[26:43] invite from from Lucas and Disney. And I remember when Yoda pulled out his lightsaber, the entire

[26:53] theater went crazy standing up, clapping, screaming. I haven't seen a theater erupt like that. And even

[27:03] when the theme song hit like people, it was an occasion. There were no reserve seats back then.

[27:10] Like you waited online with all the fans. That's like going to translate really well if they do it right.

[27:21] So I'm a, yeah, it's going to be Gary Stern doing the Jar Jar voice like Misa

[27:28] in 1000 Eliza so we as you know that's like Gary and like the beauty was set.

[27:34] Bisa you know I don't know and then like like a set is like Wato. I don't know. I don't know.

[27:43] Gary, they did we need them all galactic credits to that.

[27:49] Somehow you know, somehow you know 932 King Kong at least would not sell out somehow you know.

[28:00] Use a big do do Jar Jar. I love that guy like a leader of the Gungdon.

[28:08] Who's I in a big do do.

[28:17] Yeah, I'd buy it. I'd buy that for five bucks. I don't know man like predator.

[28:27] I think the consensus is Star Wars done right will sell.

[28:32] They're not going to do a Darth Vader machine. Now you just think about that. How do you do a

[28:36] Darth Vader machine? It doesn't make any sense. They're not going to do an all original.

[28:40] They had Brenda in all original. We saw you Brenda. We saw you walking right by your man.

[28:45] Show you man. No respect. You see this? You see what I put up with.

[28:49] Mother's Day. Mom, mom of the year.

[28:53] Yesterday in the middle of the day, it was 1145. I said Brenda was busy planning this whole day

[29:01] doing all this uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, killing him over here. What do you got?

[29:10] Hold it up. Hold on. Hold on. Come here. Don't hit the mic over here. What do you got?

[29:18] This guy. Who's that guy? I can't see you. Who is he?

[29:25] Storm V? Yeah, Storm V. Storm V.

[29:32] I think- I think that's BB-8. Can you say BB-8?

[29:38] You get- are you gonna put on your Darth Vader costume? Go get your- go get your costume on.

[29:45] Well, we're having a Star Wars theme party here. Uh-uh, because Cassian is named after Cassian andor.

[29:51] Um, the leader of the rebellion. I love that name. Um, it's BB-8. Not BB-88.

[30:00] It's BB-8. BB-8. Or I like Stormy as a better name for him.

[30:08] I know. You- you noticed me positioning the microphone. Dave, because I like- he always messes up

[30:15] the mic wire because it's loose and I'm like- I'm like, ah. BB-8, BB-88. BB-88 miles an hour baby.

[30:25] Where the heck is back to the future? Here's my thing about back to the future. I feel like

[30:31] Barry, like, spends all week in places one post. He's like-

[30:37] Mmm.

[30:41] Mmm.

[30:43] Ha.

[30:45] Mmm. You know, like a week later. He's like, meh here.

[30:50] 12 years later, you'll get your game.

[30:52] You know, I mean, I seriously, I feel like the Dutch design process.

[30:56] Yeah.

[30:57] Mmm.

[30:58] Guys, do we get off all log? It's, yeah. It's like Europe. You know, the Europeans don't work that hard.

[31:03] You have many bank holidays there are. When Dutch pinballs, like, we're going to finish these

[31:07] allises by the end of the year and we only make 10 a week and there's 52 weeks in a year

[31:14] and they're not starting until May and there's like 89 bank holidays and they take the entire

[31:19] month of like August off. You're not getting your games this year, people. Like, just-

[31:27] I don't know what math Barry's doing in Melbourne, but like, I tell Melbourne every day. I'm like,

[31:31] wait, you're not making these games.

[31:37] So my point was yesterday, Brennan was busy. She was planning everything.

[31:42] I told about the prizes people. I had 11.45. I already got the car started. I plugged into the

[31:49] nav system and address. And she said, we got to do this. We got to bike out. You know, you know,

[31:54] how wives get a tag. We got to clean up. We got to go to the store. We got to do this. We got to

[31:58] do that. We got to do that. But, but, but, but, and in our heads, you know, men are like, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

[32:04] You know, guys, it's like, do I have any time to play Pan or Xbox today?

[32:08] So it's like 11.45. And I'm like, babe, I need you in five minutes. She's like, all right.

[32:15] She's like five, you know, you know, how good wives are. They pop up like five minutes. What do we do?

[32:19] What do you need? You know, they're like, they're like army drill sergeants. They mean they're keeping

[32:23] these kids alive every day. And they have three children. She has Cassie and killing and me. So they

[32:28] got to keep all of us going. And I'm like, can you get in the car? And I need you to just drive to

[32:35] where it tells you to drive. And I'll see you in two hours. And it was a 90 minute massage.

[32:43] Just 15 minutes away. And she came back so happy. That's it. Those are gifts. Those are gifts.

[32:52] I'll tell you, should I, you know, many times I could do that or buy a $2,000 flat plastic

[32:59] topper. Let me ask you guys a question. For all you after who buy $3,000, $1,000

[33:05] at least and flat plastic toppers, when's the last time you surprised your wife? When's the last time?

[33:11] What when was the last time instead of spending the money on yourselves for these toys,

[33:17] your wife opened up a blue Tiffany box. And there was a $13,000 like diamond bracelet in there.

[33:26] Just because I love you. Think about it. I hope you do both. I hope you do both.

[33:37] It's more important.

[33:42] $2,000 flat plastic topper. It is the marriage advisor. Am I wrong, eh? Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

[33:53] I don't think so. I think most of you do well. I bought my girlfriend a $100,000 Mercedes and we

[33:59] aren't married. Well, first of all, Geno, talk about depreciation. And also, what are you doing?

[34:09] What are you doing buying your girlfriend a car? And you're like, what are you doing?

[34:15] I've wanted like Dave, Dave Ramsey you right now. Like I hope you paid and fall for that car.

[34:23] You bought a $100,000 use Mercedes?

[34:29] I love this. Geno, what did you pay for the car? Was it originally $100,000? And now it's used.

[34:37] I'm confused. I only paid cash. I feel like we're all curious now. Geno, how much?

[34:45] Did it, did it, did it cost $100,000 used or was it a $100,000 car that you got used?

[34:51] Now we need to know. Now we're going to pry and because you put the number out there, now we want to know.

[34:59] I don't know. I'm curious. Geno, the ball, the ball's in your court.

[35:05] Oh, he's he's he's he's get it out the calculator. Wow. $100,000. What what model? $100,000

[35:13] used has to be like a for Mercedes use for a hundred K has to be like an AMG S class or AMG

[35:24] truck. Did you get like a G wagon or something? Okay. What'd you get? The seven passenger SUVs.

[35:32] I don't I the depreciation on undamped Mercedes trucks is insane. I don't know how people do it.

[35:39] They lose like a hundred grand on these things like my dad my dad. My dad just got a new an S class

[35:45] like this year. Check this out. Get this S class champagne color like it's beautiful inside.

[35:53] And my dad same way he pays for all his cars. He doesn't finance. He just pays for them. And I

[36:00] my dad must have lost like a few million dollars on cars from depreciation.

[36:05] Um, he goes they gave me 60,000 off the sticker price at the dealership for the car brand new.

[36:14] They just had it on the lot brand new 60,000 off the sticker price. I'm like I was like how does

[36:19] that even like how do they even make money? Like how's that even a thing? My entire Toyota was like

[36:27] 35 grand 40 grand. I feel so good. I I the Toyota is all paid for. I got the title in hand.

[36:36] The Dodge demons paid for. I got the title in hand. The only mistake I made was leasing this

[36:41] Kia Carnival. I didn't have to I should just bought it because like it's the depreciation is

[36:46] actually not bad on these minivans. Who knew that right? Minivans hold value better than anything.

[36:51] Can it is minivan pinball podcast? Um, all right. So we've got back to the future coming out

[36:57] sometime in 2027. We've got raza coming out next after Alice's adventures in Wonderland.

[37:07] Uh, we've got predator coming from pinball brothers. We've got most likely Star Wars Episode one

[37:15] through three coming from John Borg sometime in August. We've got Pokemon. I'll give you guys

[37:25] Pokemon is coming. First quarter 2026. So it's like their February 2026 game. Jack Danger is doing that.

[37:36] Don't think you guys are going to get X-Men code any better than it really is. I don't care what

[37:40] Gomez says. I think there's too much overhaul required. And I think we're going to all be talking

[37:46] about one game and one game only for the next month. You know a game that is right? Harry Potter.

[37:55] It's going to be the talk of the entire pinball world. I'm so excited to see it.

[38:02] I'm my last show. I heard that it has nothing significantly more than what we've seen from the

[38:10] last four titles from Jersey Jack. Now look, that is a rumor. I also heard from someone who said

[38:18] they have a friend who played it and it's amazing and it's loaded. So you know, I think it's

[38:25] really easy to start rumors either way. Right? It's load. Like I heard Toy Story 4 was loaded.

[38:34] And I don't. People who played it told me that. I think what happens with all new games is you

[38:43] really hop on a brand new machine and are just excited. I just would happen with me with

[38:51] Wonka. You're just so excited to play a game before the rest of the world that you look at it with

[38:59] rose colored glasses and you you you kind of are caught up in the giddy-ness. Is the is my mic

[39:06] scratchy again? Really? Did I move it? I might have moved it. Am I sound and scratchy?

[39:21] I mean, I think more people would tell me it's scratchy if it was because last time it was scratchy

[39:27] like people told me. It comes and goes. Is that just food fighter? Everyone else is saying it sounds

[39:35] okay. So food fighter, I think it might be you brother. I'm leaning in and I don't know. Let me

[39:41] try and not brush this cable. All right. So I think it sounds okay. It's now.

[39:54] Okay. Let me see here. Let me see here. Let me try and do this. Let me see. Does anything?

[40:08] Is that better? I don't know. I can see here. I don't know. It's scratchy from time to time.

[40:18] Do you guys all right? I'm going to end this show a little early but let me just sound okay now.

[40:25] Let me see if I can find. I'm not sure where it is. All right. Hold on.

[40:48] All right. Do you guys want to see?

[40:57] Hold on.

[41:02] Uh, we're...

[41:06] Let me see.

[41:12] Hold on. I'm just looking for something.

[41:15] Is it okay? My mic? I...

[41:18] I'll restart the show if it sounds back because I want to do something fun to end the show. I want

[41:23] to walk you guys through the deck I presented the stern. It's good enough.

[41:33] Oh my god Brenda. Alexa. Stop.

[41:40] Brenda is... She's in the car and she thinks she's connected. She's connected to the sound bar here.

[41:55] Hold on. I got to go turn the sound bar down.

[42:06] Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to restart this.

[42:11] I hear Shakira in my head.

[42:20] I hold on. Hold on.

[42:26] You know what? Let's do this next Saturday because I want to really like...

[42:30] I want to make this a moment like me walking through what I presented the stern and see what you guys

[42:35] think. I actually do have to go get ready for this party. Everyone's coming in 40 minutes.

[42:42] I will make sure the sound is better next time. It's this damn... I'm going to order a new mic and

[42:48] cable. This will be my backup one but I need a new one. It's just... So everybody happy mother's day.

[42:55] This was fun and Brenda has left me with Shakira screaming in the back of my ear.
