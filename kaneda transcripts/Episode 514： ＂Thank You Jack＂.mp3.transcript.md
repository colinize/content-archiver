[00:00] But no way!

[00:03] Now, imagine you can't fit it!

[00:06] Wuh-uh-uh-uh!

[00:07] Right, I said you don't forget,

[00:09] But if you get this, get it!

[00:12] Oh yeah!

[00:13] No, no, no, no, no!

[00:15] On it!

[00:16] You know, I think my friend Bill Webb just said it the best.

[00:26] We were talking on Facebook and he said,

[00:28] Every time Jersey Jack Pimbal releases a new game,

[00:32] It's a moment.

[00:34] And he's right, he's absolutely right.

[00:36] There's just something about a new Jersey Jack release

[00:40] That does something to us Pimbal fans

[00:42] That know their company does,

[00:44] Because we know, we know deep down inside this company

[00:47] Just spends more time, more effort,

[00:50] And puts more into these games.

[00:53] Now look, you could argue that that's not the smartest approach

[00:55] That they should get more games out of the year.

[00:57] But I don't agree with that.

[00:59] I don't.

[01:00] I think one epic game from Jersey Jack Pimbal a year is enough.

[01:05] I really do.

[01:06] Look what happens when you start making Star Wars movies every year.

[01:09] It was a moment, right?

[01:11] When Star Wars movies would come out once every three years.

[01:15] There was something about that that was special.

[01:17] There's a reason why we love the Olympics and the World Cup.

[01:21] It's because it's not every single year.

[01:24] And I think when you make four to five Pimbal machines a year,

[01:27] It's not a moment anymore, right?

[01:29] When a new Stern game comes out,

[01:31] Yeah, we're excited to see new Pimbal, but it's just not the same.

[01:34] And how quickly are those games for God and right?

[01:37] How quickly does a new Stern machine come out?

[01:39] In which we all of a sudden move on to the next.

[01:42] And I think tomorrow is going to be a moment.

[01:44] It's going to be a moment in which you're going to say,

[01:47] Is Canada right?

[01:48] Was all this hype worth it?

[01:50] And I think you're going to be smiling from ear to ear.

[01:53] Tomorrow.

[01:54] I think tomorrow is going to be a day that delivers a Pimbal,

[01:58] Exciting moment like you haven't seen in a very long time.

[02:02] And I can't wait for all of you to see this game that Eric worked on.

[02:05] Now, the reason I name this show, Thank You Jack,

[02:08] Is I really want to just do a quick podcast and thank Jack Guinari

[02:13] for creating Jersey Jack Pimbal because I've given this company praise.

[02:18] I've torn this company down when they've made stupid moves.

[02:22] But we really have to thank the man who was driven to create a company

[02:27] That would give you an alternative to Stern Pimbal.

[02:30] It really was just that simple like he wasn't happy with the products he was selling when he was selling Stern machines.

[02:38] Now obviously Stern machines have improved.

[02:41] But let's face it, who forced Stern to get better?

[02:44] If there was no competition, Stern machines would not be where they are today.

[02:49] And it was Jack Guinari's dream to create a company that would elevate Pimbal.

[02:54] And I think Jersey Jack Pimbal over the years has been a little bit of a mixed bag for all of us.

[02:59] Right? It's like we want to love the games more than we normally do.

[03:03] Or then we actually do for many of you out there.

[03:05] The games have had a lot in them, but they've been overly complex.

[03:09] The games have had reliability issues and created headaches for owners and operators.

[03:15] But I think tomorrow we're going to see the new Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[03:19] But it's still Jersey Jack.

[03:21] It still carries his name.

[03:23] It was his dream to create this company.

[03:26] You know when I think about Jersey Jack Pimbal and its relationship to Stern

[03:30] And why we think Jersey Jack Pimbal is going to eventually cross the Rubicon and make a game and be successful.

[03:39] I always think of Steve Jobs in this interview he did when he talks about Microsoft.

[03:44] Because I definitely think Stern Pimbal is like the monster, the juggernaut in the Pimbal world.

[03:50] They're the Microsoft of Pimbal.

[03:52] You know they're not the dreamers.

[03:54] They're the ones who are capitalizing on the opportunity to make money in Pimbal right now.

[03:59] And they're doing it so well time and time again.

[04:01] I want to play for you.

[04:03] What Steve Jobs said about Microsoft.

[04:05] And tell me this doesn't feel like what Jack Guinari would say if he was talking about Stern Pimbal.

[04:11] So let me let me air this for you right now.

[04:13] I have two characteristics.

[04:14] I think they're very strong opportunists.

[04:16] And I don't mean that in a bad way.

[04:18] And two, they're like the Japanese.

[04:20] They just keep on coming.

[04:21] Now they were able to do that because of the revenue stream from the IBM deal.

[04:27] But nonetheless they made the most of it.

[04:29] And I give them a lot of credit for that.

[04:31] The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste.

[04:35] They have absolutely no taste.

[04:37] And what that means is I don't mean that in a small way.

[04:40] I mean that in a big way.

[04:41] In the sense that they don't think of original ideas.

[04:46] And they don't bring much culture into their product.

[04:50] And you say well why is that important?

[04:53] Well you know proportionally spaced fonts come from type setting in beautiful books.

[04:57] That's where one gets the idea.

[04:59] If it weren't for the Mac they would never have that in their products.

[05:04] And so I guess I am saddened not by Microsoft's success.

[05:10] I have no problem with their success.

[05:12] They've earned their success for the most part.

[05:16] I have a problem with the fact that they just make really third rate products.

[05:21] Their products have no spirit to them.

[05:24] Their products have no sort of spirit of enlightenment about them.

[05:29] They are very pedestrian.

[05:31] And the sad part is that most customers don't have a lot of that spirit either.

[05:37] But the way that we are going to ratchet up our species is to take the best and to spread it around to everybody.

[05:46] So that everybody grows up with better things and starts to understand the subtlety of these better things.

[05:53] And Microsoft is just you know that it's McDonald's.

[05:56] So that's what saddens me.

[06:00] Not that Microsoft is one.

[06:02] But that Microsoft's products don't display more insight and more creativity.

[06:09] Wow.

[06:10] And I really, that's how I feel lately when we just keep seeing it.

[06:15] A lot of the same sort of ideas come out in the Pimbal hobby.

[06:19] And it's not just Stern ladies and gentlemen.

[06:21] I've been following this hobby now for five years.

[06:25] And you really just get a sense that a lot of the Pimbal machines that come out.

[06:30] They are pedestrian.

[06:31] They are simple.

[06:32] And if there's one thing that Jersey Jack Pimbal is not, it's pedestrian.

[06:37] It's not simple.

[06:38] They allow their designers to put everything they can into these games.

[06:43] And that's why you know they take big risks.

[06:46] And sometimes those risks work out.

[06:48] And sometimes they have it.

[06:50] And for the most part, the the risk taking at Jersey Jack Pimbal has not worked out.

[06:54] It has not worked out.

[06:55] They have not achieved the success of a Stern Pimbal.

[06:59] And we have to give Stern credit for that.

[07:01] But here's the thing.

[07:02] I think it all changes tomorrow.

[07:04] And what you're going to see tomorrow, I think, is going to change everything.

[07:07] I think they're going to have a sales hit on their hands.

[07:11] I think they're going to sell out in one day of their collector's editions.

[07:15] And the other thing that's going to happen tomorrow that's never been done before.

[07:18] And the history of Pimbal people is this game is already in people's home.

[07:23] So they are even going to do something that Stern Pimbal has never done.

[07:28] They are going to announce tomorrow that this game is already out in the world inside people's homes.

[07:34] It's in Australia already being played.

[07:37] And so this is also going to be a moment in which Jersey Jack Pimbal is going to announce that they have up to 100 games already built and in box tomorrow people.

[07:48] You heard it here first on Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[07:51] That is their target to build 100 games and have them new in box ready for you tomorrow.

[07:59] No more eight months of waiting.

[08:01] No more streaming.

[08:02] Pired to the Caribbean for a year before it goes on the line.

[08:05] No more waiting months and months and months for your games.

[08:08] Tomorrow you will have Guns and Roses available to pick up at the Chicago factory.

[08:14] This is going to be an amazing day.

[08:17] And I want to thank Jack.

[08:19] And I want to thank Jack.

[08:20] And I know Jack sometimes thinks I'm a horrible person.

[08:23] I want to thank him for being a dreamer, for taking a huge risk and going out in the world and creating a Pimbal company against all odds.

[08:32] He has succeeded.

[08:34] He's failed to put ultimately he has succeeded.

[08:37] His company lives on.

[08:39] And I know that Leonard and Brett now own Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[08:42] But the reason why they own it.

[08:44] The reason why they invest it in it is because they believed in Jack.

[08:48] And they believed in Jack's products.

[08:50] And they are carrying his dream on into the future.

[08:54] And that's a good thing.

[08:56] It is a good thing.

[08:57] He created something of value.

[08:59] And that's why the money came to help him out.

[09:02] We've seen another Pimbal company recently with all this investment dollar do nothing.

[09:07] They don't have a line.

[09:08] They don't have games in box.

[09:09] They're not making Pimbal machines.

[09:11] They're just designing stuff.

[09:12] That's not what it takes.

[09:14] You know, Jack put these players on the court as well.

[09:17] You know, Jack is the one who found Eric and gave Eric a job and gave Eric a shot.

[09:21] A loud Eric to design a game.

[09:23] I mean, Jack saw something in him.

[09:25] And now you're all going to see something in Eric tomorrow that is just going to blow you away.

[09:29] This guy is it.

[09:30] This guy is it.

[09:31] And when I say like that, this guy is it.

[09:33] I mean, there are two people in Pimbal right now that are just Pimbal right now.

[09:37] And I put this on Facebook.

[09:38] Keith Elwin and Eric Minier, their Pimbal hard stop.

[09:42] These two men, that's Pimbal nowadays hard stop.

[09:45] They are so far above everybody else.

[09:48] It's at the point now where it's like they feel like, you know, Tarantino and Spielberg.

[09:52] Right?

[09:53] George Lucas and Spielberg.

[09:54] It's like movie directors.

[09:55] It's like I only want to buy pins from Keith Elwin and Eric Minier now.

[10:00] Unless Pat Lawler can win me over with Toy Story.

[10:03] Those are the two guys that those are the pins I want to own.

[10:06] And it's exciting.

[10:07] It's exciting to see what comes from each of them.

[10:10] But we would not have Jersey Jack Pimbal if it wasn't for Jack.

[10:13] And we would not have Stern where they are today.

[10:16] If it wasn't for Jack, if Jack didn't push and move this hobby forward,

[10:21] we would all be playing games with crappy Photoshop drag and drop artwork.

[10:26] We probably wouldn't even have LCDs yet.

[10:28] Stern would just keep making those games the way they made those games.

[10:31] Because like Steve Jobs said, and I mean this,

[10:34] a lot of you out there, you're pedestrian.

[10:37] You don't push these products forward.

[10:40] You don't demand more in your Pimbal.

[10:42] And that's a sad part of Pimbal.

[10:44] Is that customers don't stand up and say, this is not good enough for the money.

[10:48] You all just keep buying and buying and buying.

[10:52] And you keep buying every new Stern regardless of the quality, regardless of this.

[10:56] And yeah, they got better.

[10:58] But look, the prices went way through the roof.

[11:00] The only reason Stern early is $9,000 is because Jersey Jack Pimbal

[11:04] showed them that there's customers out there that will spend $9,000.

[11:08] Now unfortunately, Jack was putting so much in his machines that they were worth $9,000.

[11:14] But you're buying Stern machines that are worth nowhere near $9,000.

[11:18] And of course, Stern Pimbal wants you to think, oh, if it's fun, then what does it matter?

[11:23] Canada, it does matter.

[11:24] It does matter.

[11:25] And tomorrow, you're going to see it.

[11:27] And this is why I can't wait for you to see Guns and Roses.

[11:30] Tomorrow, you're going to see what you should always have been getting for your money

[11:34] when you start spending this kind of money.

[11:36] You're also going to see the potential of what Pimbal machines should look like in 2020.

[11:42] And what can be in a Pimbal machine of what someone who is a dreamer,

[11:46] who is creative, who's not pedestrian, what it's like when he makes a Pimbal machine,

[11:51] unlike the cookie cutter, fan layouts, stranger things, approach to Pimbal.

[11:56] Okay, you know what I mean.

[11:58] So, Jack, thank you so much.

[12:00] Thank you for finding Eric.

[12:02] Thank you for giving Eric his shot.

[12:04] Eric, thank you.

[12:05] Thank you for designing a machine that is all-heart, man.

[12:08] This game is all-heart.

[12:10] It's incredible.

[12:11] You're going to love it tomorrow.

[12:12] And thank you, Leonard, for saving Jack's dream.

[12:15] I mean, literally, you saved his dream.

[12:17] Jack was out of money, man.

[12:19] They stopped the line.

[12:20] They just walked up to the line one day and said, we're done.

[12:23] It's over.

[12:24] And it was until Leonard stepped in.

[12:26] Now, obviously, there's been a lot of management things back and forth.

[12:29] And I think Leonard's probably learned a lot of lessons about how hard it is.

[12:32] This billionaire, banker, has learned that probably the hardest company in his repertoire of companies

[12:38] to make money is Pimbal.

[12:40] And I think he's still in it because there's just something special about it.

[12:44] Because unlike everything else, you can make all this money in banking and wineries.

[12:49] But there's something about your final product being a Pimbal machine that makes it a moment, right?

[12:56] You can't wheel out a bottle of wine and have a real moment the way you can reveal a Pimbal machine, right?

[13:03] It's a moment.

[13:05] Bill Webb is right.

[13:06] Every time a Jersey Jack machine comes out, it's a moment.

[13:10] I know a lot of you won't sleep well tonight as you wait for guns and roses.

[13:14] I know you're going to be satisfied beyond belief tomorrow.
