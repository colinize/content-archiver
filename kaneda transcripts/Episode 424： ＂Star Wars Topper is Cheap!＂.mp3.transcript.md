[00:00] Oh I said I wasn't gonna do any pinball podcasts during the Thanksgiving break but I woke

[00:22] up this morning and I felt compelled to give you all a belated happy Thanksgiving

[00:27] episode 424 or 5 which one is it let me check real quick of Canadian pinball podcast 424

[00:37] episodes so I just put up the lost Jared episode Jared over at Stern Pinball I think Jared's

[00:45] an awesome individual we did that podcast over two years ago right at the moment Star Wars

[00:53] pinball was about to come out and I think you're really gonna enjoy it please excuse the lack

[00:58] of audio quality that was my old microphone but I still to this day to this day I do not understand

[01:07] why Stern pinball listen to that show and wouldn't let him have permission to air the show and it's

[01:16] funny when you listen to how much has changed over the last couple years because I talk about getting

[01:20] all these other Stern luminaries on the show to interview and we were we were much more much more

[01:27] infactuated with Stern pinball that we might be today but you know this show I call it like it is

[01:33] I love some Stern games I don't like some Stern games I like some Stern designers I don't like

[01:37] other designers I like some coders I don't like some coders and you know what I played I played

[01:43] as I see it I call it like I see it like I see it what the hell is that even me anyway so enjoy that

[01:49] so what do I want to talk about on this episode of Canadian pinball podcast we have to start out by

[01:54] first saying that my Batman 66 super limited edition game has sold and will be picked up next Wednesday

[02:04] and going to a great new home and I'm not gonna tell you what I sold it for but I'll tell you this

[02:10] I didn't lose any money on it so I'll tell you that right now and it is kind of incredible

[02:15] that you can buy this high end pinball machine play it for two years and not lose a single dollar

[02:22] on the machine there are only 80 of the super limited editions out there that is something to do

[02:28] with it but I will say this the buyer of my game said the only reason he was having the conversation

[02:35] with me and would pay the price he paid is that I had a play field protector on this game from day one

[02:43] and those of you out there who think that play field protectors don't matter and don't add any

[02:49] value to games when you resell them you're fooling yourselves and so many stern games especially

[02:56] around the time period that Batman was made look at their play fields they look like a golf ball

[03:04] they look like moon crater dimpled garbage and I don't know what happened something happened

[03:10] in the last few years that made all these stern play fields look like trash but they dimple so

[03:16] poorly and if you're OCD and you want a game looking as mint as possible a play field protector is

[03:23] the way to go all right so that game is sold and that means we're one down and we got the big

[03:29] Lebowski to go and you know that that auction ends a week from Sunday I really look forward to seeing

[03:35] what it goes for right now the high bid is fifteen thousand dollars so get your bid in I'm getting

[03:41] a lot of hysterical Facebook messages from Lebowski fans who have no idea about pinball someone sent

[03:48] me a message yesterday that it goes is this a full size functioning pinball machine and if it is

[03:53] what is the cost I mean really I can't wait to ruin that guy's day and tell him it's going to

[04:00] go somewhere between fifteen and twenty thousand dollars and he's just going to be like I'll never

[04:05] hear from him again all right so look there's something I want to talk about first and foremost

[04:11] and that is the forever in the making Star Wars topper is now officially available and has an

[04:21] official price tag are you sitting down seven hundred and seventy five dollars for a Star Wars

[04:29] pinball topper how can we not talk about that right now so here's the thing it's a limited

[04:37] edition topper and there will be only five hundred of them made at seven hundred and seventy

[04:44] five dollars and it has R2D2 sitting on a little metal platform and he moves back and forth and I

[04:51] think maybe his light his his little you know hologram thing lights up let's talk about this for me

[04:58] because I see pinside like exploding and people saying how they're not going to buy this thing and

[05:03] this is this is the final cash grab from Stern pinball and we're not going to take it anymore and I

[05:09] just have to say what do you expect Stern to do at this point you all of you and I mean this

[05:16] people have been running to this company and spending exorbitant amounts of money with absolutely

[05:23] no value in the packages for so many years and Stern pinball has realized that all they ever have

[05:30] to do to remove money from people is make something limited edition and then you know don't add

[05:38] much value to it and wrap it around a good theme and they'll most likely sell whatever it is they're

[05:47] trying to sell get a good theme limited don't add much and charge a lot that has been their formula

[05:54] for a very long time and so when I saw the price of this topper I was kind of laughing because I'm

[06:00] like well you know this doesn't even phase me anymore after watching how morons went and bought

[06:08] the signature edition of El Vira I've said it like what lessons are we teaching Stern when time

[06:16] and time again we just jump in headfirst to anything they offer and we scoop it up regardless

[06:23] if the value is there so yes on a value level that Star Wars topper is a complete joke it's like

[06:30] $775 for that like that thing you could go get any major video game council you could go get one

[06:38] of the best phones in the world you could get stuff with actual engineering and actual value put into

[06:44] it and it's just moves back and forth like it it and it looks unfinished like it doesn't even look like

[06:51] the the base of the thing just looks so bad and when you see it on top of the machine it also looks

[06:57] really bad I but but that doesn't matter it's R2D2 it's Star Wars and do I think Stern is going to

[07:05] sell every one of these here's here's the sad part I do because the 20 or 30 of you crying on

[07:12] pinside isn't even their target for this thing it's the people who bought this game who love this

[07:18] game all they need are 500 people who love Star Wars game in their home and they get a call from

[07:25] their distributor saying hey how would you like to you know put the icing on the cake there's only

[07:30] going to be 500 so make sure you get it now so will they sell all of them I mean look at the

[07:35] Ghostbusters topper that thing was 500 bucks and it was a plastic garbage on top of the machine garbage

[07:43] I mean sometimes I wonder if people don't understand like when you look at the Ghostbusters topper

[07:47] it looks like cheap toys from China that they just stuck on top of the machine and they charged

[07:52] people 500 bucks and nowadays you can't even find the Ghostbusters topper for sale if you had one

[07:59] I'm sure you could get more than 500 bucks so I'm not surprised that the Star Wars topper

[08:04] is going to be even more money now we all know Stern spent a lot on the Star Wars license and they're

[08:09] they're going to continue to milk this game first long as they possibly can I mean we just saw

[08:14] the reissue of the game with the new comic book art but here's the thing about Star Wars in general

[08:21] the Star Wars property now as a property has never been hotter the Mandalorian just dethroned

[08:28] stranger things as the most streamed show of all time I believe uh you know you got the new movie

[08:34] coming out in December Star Wars land opening up in Disney World in Disneyland okay now I still

[08:42] think that the Star Wars Pimball experience is really lackluster so this game to me won't be

[08:49] improved by putting an expensive topper on the game I think Stern missed a real golden opportunity

[08:57] to make Star Wars an incredible game I just don't think it is one and I all the arguments in the

[09:04] world around like whether or not I'm right or wrong it's all subjective but I love Star Wars I

[09:10] love the movies the potential to just put the most amazing Star Wars world under glass was just

[09:15] missed so to me I could I could care less that two and a half years later they finally figured out

[09:21] the topper but it's more than the topper and that's why people are reacting it's the reality

[09:28] that Stern Pimball is charging so much money for stuff and the value is just not there but it doesn't

[09:37] matter because people will buy it you bought Elvira now you you don't deserve any value I have to

[09:42] say it the people in this hobby are really embarrassing at times what they run towards and I want

[09:49] to tell you a little story and this happened to me this week I was I was waiting to pick up Brenda

[09:55] from her new job she's working over at Facebook which is awesome I was I was waiting to pick her up

[10:01] I had to kill a few hours I was in the type R in New York City so I decided to go over to modern

[10:06] Pimball and I decided to play some Pimball for for an hour now that the only thing that sucks about

[10:11] modern Pimball now in New York City I just want to play Pimball for an hour and they only sell you

[10:17] all day long pass like you it's like you you can buy for the entire day and there's no like

[10:23] hourly rate so I had to pay like 20 something bucks when I only want it to play for like 45 minutes

[10:29] but whatever okay so I go in there and they've got a bunch of Stern machines they've got

[10:34] Valley Williams machines they've got EM's they've got solid state they've got dialed in

[10:40] they've got Star Wars you know the the John Papaduke one episode one they've got a bunch of stuff

[10:45] they got World Cup Soccer you know they've got a fish tail they've got a Star Trek the next

[10:52] generation and I go in there and I just go around the horn and I start playing everything and I start

[10:58] you know and there's one machine or two machines that really just like honestly when you're standing

[11:04] over it I was just like wow like look at all this stuff in this game and then I went over and I

[11:10] played that a monster's premium they'd a Deadpool they'd have Guardians the Galaxy uh and you know

[11:16] and new Stern's compared to the older games and and when you're only 10 feet away from the

[11:22] Valley Williams stuff and the Stern stuff and it's right there and it's right next to each other

[11:26] it's really easy to compare just like physically like what's in these games okay now I have to say

[11:33] this the game that just like blew me away in terms of like the amount of stuff in it and the

[11:38] amount of like toys and gadgets and and loops and ramps and habit trails and cannons and lights and

[11:46] and sounding callouts from the actors of the show was no other than Star Trek the next generation

[11:53] and they had one there and it played beautifully and and I I came away from that game and then I

[11:58] went over to monsters premium and I went over to Deadpool and I went over to the other Stern games

[12:03] and it's so hard for me to have a pinball podcast to do an assessment of pinball machines and

[12:10] what are we getting for our value and Stern selling these machines for $6,000 and $9,000 to $15,000

[12:18] and to just see what's in these games and then the go play Star Trek the next generation and look

[12:23] at all that's in that game and and then say to ourselves that where is pinball gone in 20 years

[12:31] like these games now are so expensive toppers are $750,000, LVira with a piece of couches $15,000

[12:39] and I'm here to say it like these games comparatively next to like a Star Trek the next generation

[12:45] or World Cup soccer they're like embarrassingly barren and empty and without hardly anything

[12:53] interesting on the play field and yet we're spending so much money on these games and I walk out

[13:00] of there I walk out of there and I think about you know Chris you do a show about pinball you do a

[13:05] show about pinball buying and you do a show about pinball collecting and I really have to give it

[13:11] to Stern they have created an environment they've created a bubble in which people have stopped

[13:18] even questioning what they're getting for their money and their sales are indicative of that

[13:25] like they have incredible sales numbers year over year over year and I think it proves the power

[13:32] of the theme I think it proves the power of reliability I think it proves the power of consistency

[13:40] right they don't stop there's gonna be three to four new games a year based on themes you love

[13:46] and the games for the most part are gonna be really reliable but they've cut corners there's no

[13:51] denying it go over a modern Stern game look at the play field looks like a golf ball okay go look at

[13:57] the mechanisms in them how how many of them actually have like anything interesting going on

[14:02] mechanically it's all in the code it's all in the theme it's all in the artwork I have said it

[14:08] before everything that pretty much cannot break is where they sort of attract us but man jump on a

[14:16] start trick the next generation and to me that's like pinball wow that's just pinball wow and then

[14:22] I jumped on World Cup soccer which is not even one of popadews most popular machines and that

[14:27] game's got tons of wow stuff going on more so than I even saw in raza when I watched the videos of

[14:33] raza same designer but lots of stuff going on in the games and that's all we want to see I know

[14:39] that that's what you want to see in pinball you want to see stuff going on right and I just I

[14:45] just had this like I don't know this moment and I had this a lot where we we mown and grown we

[14:52] complain about these prices but if you keep buying these games at these prices who's to blame who's

[14:58] to blame and I've said it I think 2020 is gonna be a year in which a lot of stuff is gonna come out

[15:06] a lot of stuff competing for your your dollars and I can't wait I can't wait to just clean the slate

[15:14] of my two games and then figure out what to get next the crazy part is this too after I sell these

[15:21] two games I will have generated close to 30 thousand dollars to in my bank account for from selling

[15:31] just two two pinball machines I mean that's ludicrous 30 grand for two machines and and you think

[15:41] about the experience of these machines these games don't give you 10 to 15 thousand dollars in

[15:48] entertainment value it's insanity we are lost all of us in this hobby at at at simply just not even

[15:57] wanting to think about how much this stuff is costing and what's in it and my god for like nine

[16:05] thousand dollars you feel like you should have everything and the kitchen sink put into a game

[16:10] you'd think companies would start to look at games you know like like bonds I run again and like

[16:15] why not have something creative going on with the back box why not have something more creative

[16:19] going on with the top or why why can't you to design a game in which the ball goes up to the top

[16:24] on the machine let me just let me just dream for a minute you're telling me after 20 years of

[16:30] understanding what to do with the pinball machine in cabinet you can't design a game in which the

[16:35] ball physically travels up the back box goes up to the top and shoots out and comes back down into

[16:42] the play field that you we can't figure that out we couldn't have figured out with woolly wonka how

[16:48] to make the wonka Vader actually break out of the the back box and become like an amazing interactive

[16:54] topper during that mode in the game we can't we can't figure this stuff out mechanically doesn't seem

[17:00] that hard okay I just want I just yeah and and here's the crazy part what what if what if after going

[17:08] on location or visiting your friends house in which they have tons of pinball machines what if you

[17:13] come out of that experience with just a revelation that I really enjoy playing pinball pinballs a lot of fun

[17:22] but the desire to own any games at these prices is now dissipating within my mind I don't really care

[17:30] I don't really care to own these super expensive games anymore because for a few reasons uh I can

[17:37] get my fix close by now I know not not most of you can do that I also don't care anymore because I

[17:42] really do I think the status and the cachet that comes with owning these machines is like gone now

[17:50] I mean there's so many games out there so many them have the title limited edition so many of them

[17:57] collectors edition limited edition signature edition it's at the point now where none of it really

[18:03] feels special none of it feels unique none of it feels that innovative and when I hear people talk

[18:10] about innovation I don't get it I don't get it and I listen to other shows and I hear people

[18:18] talk about the innovation and the where is the innovation please someone email me at

[18:23] canada pinball at gmail.com and tell me where the innovation and the outside the box thinking

[18:31] is taking place right now with so many of these games okay and am I am I being again it's because

[18:37] I don't know maybe start trick the next generation to bad example because it's a wide body and it's

[18:41] jam pack with stuff it'd be like playing twilight zone being like well everything feels barren next

[18:46] to this but but man those games were cheaper than these games are now I don't get it okay all right

[18:53] what else is going on in pinball right now so if you buy an American pinball game you get five hundred

[19:02] dollars off your next new inbox American pinball game and it can be a Houdini or an October Fest

[19:09] but here's the problem with this sale and if you go and look at use game prices right now in the

[19:17] market trends for American pinball games you can go get a Houdini with lots of mods and great

[19:24] condition for fifty nine hundred bucks you can go get an October Fest for sixty one hundred

[19:30] dollars tomorrow ship to your door and you'd still be saving yourself way more money than their

[19:37] current deal so what this must mean is they must be sitting on inventory and there must be inventory

[19:44] at American pinball and distributors must be holding on the games and they need to get rid of them

[19:50] but here's the trouble I see they have officially announced that their next game will be revealed

[19:58] at Texas pinball festival now that's four months away so what's on the line over the next four months

[20:05] flying Dutchman redemption games they need to get more games on the line I still don't understand

[20:14] with all these home brew games with alien pinball needing manufacturing with the big Lebowski

[20:20] needing manufacturing why isn't American pinball going out and getting a game to put on the line

[20:27] that has built in demand and just make it and just keep making it they they could sell big Lebowski's

[20:35] at twelve five and just keep pumping them out I still think they would sell and you know and if

[20:41] AP could help maybe make the boards better because that's what AP does they make their own boards if

[20:46] they could help fix some of the quirks of that game why not do that you know so I'm just confused

[20:54] but I am I am looking forward to AP's next game now here's what I heard I heard they had two games

[20:59] in that they're making one is license one is not and they will bring the game out that is

[21:03] finished first at tpf okay all right what else is going on in the pinball world there's a great

[21:09] interview on the slam tilt podcast with Steve Bouton of deep root pinball and Steve talks about

[21:17] raza retro atomic zombie adventure land so I would definitely go check that out what's

[21:22] interesting about Steve working on this game is you know normally normally a game is designed

[21:31] with the software engineer and the mechanical engineer and the game designer together you know so

[21:38] you get together you figure out the game you figure out the storyline you figure out the shots the

[21:43] modes you know how you're gonna sort of all bring it together this is different and when

[21:48] Steve talks about it you'll hear it like he basically was just given this game that was already

[21:53] designed by john poppadoo and it's his job to bring the game to life with code now that makes me a

[22:00] little nervous it that this thing is sort of being built in silos and is you know and and how will

[22:09] that translate or how will that manifest into a final game and gameplay experience because there's

[22:16] there's a lot going on with this narrative of being in an adventure land and Ned and then you've

[22:22] got like zombies and you've got all this stuff going on duck target spinning and this and that

[22:28] I'm not sure it's all gonna come together and that's always the challenge and I think when people

[22:34] look at a game like Jurassic Park and why people love it and we've said this before it's because Keith

[22:40] Elwin designs the game with the rules and the code in mind so everything is thought of at the very

[22:49] moment of inception and there's a reason why Jurassic Park is now the number one game on pen size

[22:57] top 100 so congratulations Keith Elwin this guy unfrikin believable what he's done two games two

[23:07] home runs two games that are gonna win best game of the year at the twippy is without a doubt nothing

[23:14] nothing is even going to come close to winning that award other than Jurassic Park I'm sorry all

[23:21] you will you want a fanboys I know you're the same way with the pirates the Caribbean fanboys

[23:26] I know you guys love your games but thousands more are buying and enjoying this stern titles and

[23:33] that's you're just never gonna win because of votes you just don't have the votes and also those

[23:37] games are just not on location as much you you really have a hard time finding you know a Willy

[23:44] Wonka on location but you can find stern games all over the country all over the world far more

[23:51] exposure to a stern machine all right so so like yeah Steve Bowden's got a code and unravel the

[23:59] mystery of John Papaduke so we'll see how that comes to fruition but you know at some point you

[24:04] know March is gonna get here and we'll figure it all out all right so what else is going on in the

[24:09] pinball world I I took a you know I had I wrote down a few notes for the show but the other thing I

[24:15] want to talk about and we talk about value value did I did I just say that weird here's the thing

[24:22] what if I told you that a black knight Ellie with only 88 plays is $6,900 right now

[24:31] all right and a monster's premium black and white $5,900 bucks and then a big bang bar which

[24:38] Chicago gaming company has already said they're going to make more big bang bars is being listed

[24:44] for $16,500 so look we are at a point now and you have to feel it you have to feel it lots of games

[24:56] lots of games for sale lots of new stuff coming the market is softening it is softening it's never

[25:03] going to crash in pinball but it is very soft right now and I I really I love putting money in

[25:10] the bank and I love waiting to see what comes next now what games do I really want to buy next here

[25:16] here's my top here's my top five list of games that canada is considering to put in his bedroom

[25:22] all right number one on my list of if you gave me this theme I would want this theme number one big

[25:29] trouble in little china it's not happening I just want that pinball machine number two on my

[25:36] list of themes I would want in my bedroom because I love it so much and be perfect for pinball

[25:40] the matrix I really want a matrix pinball machine I'm still kicking myself I did not buy that

[25:47] re-skinned version of johnny new monic for 20 grand okay now they're 30 grand stupid 30 grand for

[25:54] pinball machine you can go get a Honda Civic Type R for almost that much all right number three

[26:00] on my list if you make it I buy it is ready for it toy story I love toy story I love all the movies

[26:08] I love all four of them I think it's the perfect theme for pinball and I know that jersey jacks

[26:13] making it so it makes me even more excited all right toy story the next one guns and roses I

[26:20] love gnr I've always been a huge gnr fan part of my life's story revolves around guns and roses so

[26:27] I can't wait to see what jersey jack does with guns and freaking roses okay now stranger things is

[26:32] also I would put stranger things in guns and roses together I would really it would really have

[26:38] to blow me away those stranger things it just there's something about the fact that I love it as a show

[26:44] but I'm not sure how all three seasons would play out in a pinball experience that would be super

[26:50] rewarding and have longevity to it so that's where I'm at right now now look you know how it is you

[26:57] wake up one day and that's your top five you wake up next week you might have another theme that

[27:01] you think would be awesome you know I love all the eighties nostalgic stuff like I love top gun I

[27:07] would love man like die hard would be awesome I would love transformers generation one I forgot to

[27:14] say that that's always number one for me transformers generation one and Akira are just they're just like

[27:19] above number one for me they were just like if you've made these games I would just buy it I think

[27:24] a Kira would be awesome I think it would be awesome to make an Akira if you haven't seen that anime

[27:29] go check it out it's where canada comes from if you weren't aware of that so look I don't know

[27:36] what 2020 holds I really don't I actually was just listening to a new pinball podcast that's out

[27:44] there I believe it's called the super awesome pinball podcast it is with doctor pin Christopher

[27:50] Franchi and Ed van der Vee now Chris Franchi was kind enough to give me an early link to listen to

[27:59] the episode and I was listening to it this morning between like six and seven thirty in the morning

[28:05] I would definitely check it out you know Chris loves he has a history in podcasting he loves to produce

[28:12] these segments they're highly produce highly stylized and you know I'm all for it I mean I think

[28:18] it sounds really interesting and entertaining and you know if I could give them any advice and they're

[28:23] only an episode one and someone told this to me a while back and they came to me and they said look

[28:30] my son is twelve years old and he loves to listen to your show but I can allow him to listen to it

[28:38] if there's curse words and so could you do your shows without cursing and it really stuck with me

[28:46] it's like wow like I I can do this show without cursing without swearing without you know going nuts

[28:55] if I want to do a pinstead babies episode with like you know explicit language I can easily let him know

[29:02] so that's one of the shows he won't let his kid listen to and since then since then I haven't

[29:09] sworn on this show and maybe a couple times by mistake when I'm talking about Elvira but for the

[29:15] most part I don't think you need to get like explicit to get your point across and so you know

[29:22] but look everyone's gonna do the show they want the way they want to do the show and Chris is very

[29:26] outspoken and it's it's definitely got some explicit language in it um they're gonna do it every

[29:31] two weeks they're gonna try the challenge with that always becomes keeping the news relevant

[29:37] and being relevant and capturing the news when it happens is something we try to do a lot on this

[29:42] show hopefully we we we we do enough of that for you hope I think a lot of people listen to this show

[29:47] to get the news without having to listen to other um or to go on forums to find the stuff out or

[29:55] weed through the pin-side forms okay so check it out super awesome pinball show just came out today

[30:01] uh check out the slam tilt show uh a couple of other things and I'm gonna let you go so I got an

[30:08] email from someone saying you know Chris you don't talk enough about Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[30:15] Castle and how great this machine is and how awesome it is and yada yada yada and you know I don't

[30:21] talk about the machine simply because uh I've said in the past I do think it's spooky's best game

[30:28] I do think it's it's a phenomenal game with great animations the shots are tight

[30:33] but you know that but that game to me when they got the code and the shots everything dialed in

[30:41] together and the animations are some of the best and the way that game sort of invites you in

[30:47] I think it's a great game I think people are enjoying it uh do I think it's at the same level

[30:53] as as a stern premium or a jersey jack machine no not it's not there yet

[30:58] I think the sculpts are beautiful but you know don't don't mistake sculpts for actual mechanical things

[31:04] but spooky has always done the smart thing and they've grown uh at the pace they can grow

[31:11] and they innovate at the pace they can innovate and so I I I don't know what else to say they're

[31:16] going to make all 500 when Charlie said he was going to make them and then they're going to move

[31:20] on to their next title it is Rick and Morty going to be Scott Denise's I don't know now speaking

[31:26] of Rick and Morty I forgot to mention this I also was inundated with emails saying how amazing

[31:34] Rick and Morty is and then I should give it a try I want to clarify that I never said that Rick

[31:41] and Morty wasn't a good show I just said that if I was going to pick a theme for pinball I wouldn't

[31:47] start there because I do think it's a show you've either seen it and love it or you know nothing

[31:54] about it now yes you could say that about everything on some level but for the most part if you

[32:02] look at the themes that Stern does from an IP standpoint it's stuff that has much more universal

[32:10] awareness and knowledge but that look I get it I'm going to check the show out I I understand

[32:16] that it's the perfect kind of humor and storyline for pinball so that's great and if they make it

[32:23] will they sell a few hundred can they sell thousands of Rick and Morty's no no way but if Scott

[32:30] Denise he wants to make 750 absolutely I think that's within realm of possibility but there's no way

[32:38] that you're going to sell thousands of Rick and Morty machines do you disagree can you

[32:42] to pinball at gmail.com come on the show and tell me how you think Rick and Morty is going to

[32:48] sell thousands of units okay versus like Batman or Godzilla or Ninja Turtles okay it's just not

[32:54] there it's just not there I do get it's one of who lose most popular shows but again I don't

[33:01] think the crossover to the pinball buyer base is as strong as people think I can just see Ben

[33:06] heck screaming at me right now all right what else is going on I got an email from Jeff over at

[33:12] this week in pinball he wanted to clarify something about the twippies in my last episode I think I

[33:19] joked that how many canada pinball podcast votes did not get counted because people spelled my

[33:27] name wrong and he wanted to clarify that every which way people spelled canada was tallied in the

[33:34] voting and I know it was Jeff I was just joking with you the one thing I'd like to see and he knows

[33:41] this and I want to explain real quick why I think this piece of information being left out really

[33:48] is unfortunate for those of us who spent all this time and energy making pinball podcasts so

[33:53] last year and the first year when you won for best pinball podcast or when you had a right in

[34:01] category they did not tell us how many votes we got nor did they tell us what percentage of the

[34:09] votes we got so the margin of victory is unclear to me so I don't know if I won by 50 votes 500 votes

[34:18] 200 votes one vote I don't know if I got 60% of the votes or 20% of the votes it's all up in the

[34:26] air it's one big question mark and here's why I just think it's important I think whenever you do

[34:32] anything you want to be able to measure how well you did and you want the data necessary to see year

[34:40] after year am I improving am I getting more votes am I expanding my my vote reach it would also be

[34:48] great it would be great to understand where the votes are coming from am I am I if I got listeners

[34:54] in Australia in Europe and whatnot but but here's the thing I really hope they open up

[35:00] and let everybody know in this year's twippy how many votes they got and what the percentage was

[35:07] a victory because I also think it's important for people finishing in second and third place to know

[35:13] how far they have to go and and I know Jeff's response was we don't want to discourage people from

[35:19] doing their shows and that's why we didn't reveal that information but what what what what other

[35:25] what other like voting or election type of thing do they withhold the votes to not discourage

[35:34] people I mean we live in a world in which it's an election year in 2020 and all we're seeing are

[35:40] where people stand in the polls and how popular they are and if if you get information that is

[35:46] discouraging it makes you do two things it either makes you improve or drop out and maybe

[35:54] maybe just maybe that might be beneficial information for people to have but here's the thing I

[36:00] don't think people do pinball podcast to win or lose a twippy I don't I think every single person

[36:07] who picks up a microphone and does a pinball podcast does it because they love pinball because it's

[36:15] entertaining to them because they enjoy doing their show it doesn't matter whether or not they win

[36:21] or get recognition at the twippies it really doesn't now I've always said that the twippies mean a lot

[36:27] to me and winning them does mean a lot to me in this show because since the day this show began

[36:33] we've always been on the ropes against the pinside forum and all the other people out there that

[36:39] just didn't want this show to have a voice I also try to make the best most entertaining show possible

[36:46] and and the only recognition we have right now is the twippy so it just it just means a lot I do

[36:53] love the recognition because for me winning a twippy is really a victory for you for everybody that

[37:01] listens and loves this show I love carrying the mantle for all of you because I know that when

[37:09] you have to tell people that you enjoy Canadian pinball podcasts that sometimes people roll their

[37:15] eyes they don't understand it but I know that for those of you who love this show weekend and

[37:19] week out victory at the end of the year at the twippies is somewhat of a validation for all of you

[37:26] who enjoy this show and that's why I want to win I want to win so you guys can celebrate the

[37:32] fact that together we're creating a very entertaining pinball podcast and that's it that's it nobody's

[37:39] making money nobody's getting rich I'm not getting like a big endorsement deal out of this whole thing

[37:44] all right all right what else is going on in pinball let me just close the show by saying I am loving

[37:52] loving watching people unbox their collectors editions of Willy Wonka it's a stunning pinball

[37:59] machine without a doubt it is one of the most beautiful pinball machines that has ever ever been

[38:06] available for sale I'm also not seeing anybody you know we covered the other side of this story

[38:12] we need to we need to address this I am not seeing anybody unboxing a Willy Wonka collectors

[38:20] edition noticing any pooling or play field clear coat issues on their games and and I mean that

[38:29] that it we need to we we should applaud the fact that it seems like Jersey Jack has figured out the

[38:36] issue with these play fields it's still early on so let's see how these games hold up but we were

[38:43] seeing people pull out of new inbox games when when he had issues with pirates and Wonka L.E.'s and

[38:49] standards people were seeing the pooling right away so the fact that we're not seeing pooling now

[38:55] it is a good sign it's a good sign and I'm glad they figured it out because these are expensive

[39:00] machines I still you know I still think the topper looks like an umpa lumpa took a dump on top

[39:06] of the machine though I definitely would put a new topper in that game and I think mirror blades

[39:12] would look better than the inner side art but other than that this this thing is gorgeous so I

[39:17] I think Jersey Jack uh once again has delivered a beautiful Pymma machine to the world uh all right

[39:23] anything else that I want to talk about in Pymball I hope you all had a great thanksgiving uh

[39:28] ours was incredible is me Brenda and her sister Rebecca and Bubba and we watched the Bulldog

[39:35] win best in show on the dog show and we watched football we went to see knives out it's just

[39:42] thanksgiving's the best it's the best holiday it really is and and the best part about it was

[39:47] about like 10 30 at night this couple outside was screaming at each other and the woman's just

[39:52] like slapping the guy in the face and I'm like well that's just you know what what a great data to

[39:57] be assaulting your boyfriend on Thanksgiving anyway everyone thank you so much for listening to

[40:03] Kenny's Pymball podcast uh I love the fact that you tune in every week to hear what we have to say
