[00:00] Alright and just like that, Jaws Pinball is out in the world, no more speculation, no more

[00:26] wondering what is in this game, we are now looking at the first official photos of Keith

[00:32] Elwyn's two years in the making Jaws Pinball, I think 95% of my predictions about what would

[00:39] be in this game have come true, we've got the Orca, we've got the other small ship with

[00:45] the kinetic ball that lifts up and then we've got the mechanical shark underneath, while

[00:50] he's not so mechanical, we're going to talk about that, we've got the spinning disc from

[00:55] the Avengers, we've got the upper play field, we don't have this sort of clear translucent

[01:02] plastic that I thought was going to be in this game, but we now know what Keith Elwyn's

[01:08] Jaws machine is going to be like, photos are being shared all over the interwebs, Jason

[01:15] Knapp seems to have high res photos, Kanaida's got low res photos, I've seen video of the

[01:22] game in action and so here we are today on Tuesday, January 2nd and we now know what

[01:29] the game is going to look like, look over the next week we're going to get everything

[01:34] on this game, we're going to get this storyline tomorrow, then we're going to get the feature

[01:38] videos, then we're going to get all the high res assets, the L.E.s will be for sale this

[01:44] Thursday, this is definitely going to be Shark Week over at Stern Pinball and so here's

[01:51] the thing, whenever we see a game for the first time, it's always hard to sort of figure

[01:55] out how to process a new pinball machine when we see it for the first time because we haven't

[02:01] played it and I can tell by the gameplay video, as I watch this game being played, it's going

[02:08] to play like a Keith Elwyn game so if you like Keith Elwyn games, I think you're going

[02:14] to enjoy this game, the thing is this, as I look down at this game, it's not that it

[02:20] doesn't look like it shoots good because of course it's going to shoot good, it's Keith

[02:24] Elwyn, it's probably going to shoot great, there's just something about a Stern machine

[02:30] where like our expectations are always super high and I have to just say this, looking

[02:35] down at this machine, it's definitely much simpler than a game like Godzilla, the artwork

[02:41] is much simpler and I think some people are going to like that, I think some people might

[02:46] consider it to be a little bit more barren looking but when you look down at this game,

[02:51] it definitely looks like a game in which Stern did not have all of the assets they wanted

[02:57] in the machine itself and you can definitely feel the missing presence of Brody, the main

[03:03] character from Jaws the Movie, him not being on that play field, you get the sense that

[03:09] Stern had their hands tied a little bit by the license holder with this game and as I'm

[03:15] looking at the game right now, there's a lot of blue, there's a lot of blue in this game

[03:19] and that makes sense but I'm just staring at the game right now, there's this great

[03:22] hi-res image I'm looking at of the game and it almost looks like you have your chin on

[03:27] the lockdown bar and you're looking out over the play field and you're looking at the orca

[03:32] in the upper left, you got the smaller ship that Jaws pops up from underneath, you've got

[03:38] the spinning disc that's to the right, you've got the chum bucket to the left, you've got

[03:42] three drop down targets on the left side of the game, you've got a third right flipper

[03:47] midway up the right side of the game and really like a lot of the action in this game seems

[03:52] like it's going to take place in that upper left area of the game, the whole middle of

[03:58] the game, the whole center of this game is wide open so that means this game is going

[04:03] to be really fast, you also see the posts in the in lanes on both sides of this game

[04:09] which are going to pop up and give you the ability to lock the ball, I think Jurassic

[04:13] Park has that on one side of the game and just looking at the game, okay, because right

[04:18] now all we can really comment on are the mechs in the game, the artwork on the game and some

[04:25] of the design geometry layout of the game and that's it and that's only half of a pinball

[04:31] experience, we know that there's still so many questions to be answered when it comes

[04:36] to the code in the game, what's the storyline going to be, how close to the movie is this

[04:42] game going to be and how are they going to deal with Brody, I've seen some clips from

[04:46] the LCD screen and I think you see him, so will he be in it, are they going to get voice

[04:52] actors to do his iconic lines, a lot yet to be determined in that area of this game and

[04:59] just looking down at this game and looking at the le version of this game and looking

[05:05] at the mechanisms in this game, I just want to say this, I think this is a really, really

[05:10] good effort from Stern Pinball and from Keith Elwyn, my problem now in pinball is this,

[05:17] does not look like a $13,000 machine, if it was $10,000 I'd be looking down at this le

[05:24] with much different eyes and that's my main issue, is this hobby's become so expensive

[05:30] at the prices that pinball is at and then you see the shark mechanism in action and the

[05:36] shark doesn't do anything like the boat pops up and there's this rubber shark that looks

[05:41] like it's a little chew toy that my dog would play with or that Killian would play with

[05:45] in the bathtub and that's Jaws in Jaws Pinball, you know there's something about Keith Elwyn,

[05:51] like Godzilla does nothing and Jaws seemingly really doesn't do much and I was just expecting

[05:57] a lot more drama from the shark itself, like I just pictured Jaws coming up from underneath

[06:04] the ocean and he was going to eat the ball like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park and you know

[06:09] in the movie where he's wiggling back and forth like there's none of that and I really

[06:13] wanted to see some of that like this big mechanical shark that wiggles back and forth and his gills,

[06:19] you know there's something about Jaws' gills when he's out of the water and he's moving left and

[06:23] right and also his name is Jaws like you want to see his teeth and his mouth open up and he

[06:29] doesn't do anything, it just looks like a cheap rubber toy and then I'm reminding it who we're

[06:34] dealing with here, it's Stern Pinball and so yeah it's a really good effort from Stern but I'm just

[06:41] at this point now where a Stern is a Stern is a Stern and at these prices what should we expect

[06:48] in a pinball machine, I mean that's my main thing, the first half of this day I was seeing all these

[06:53] posts by people being like the LEDs of Jaws are already sold out, I'm already starting to see the

[06:59] FOMO generated by the distributors and the dealers already, none of them even have their games yet,

[07:05] nobody's really taken any money yet on the game and as I'm looking at this game and I'm looking at

[07:10] the artwork, I'm looking at the mechanisms in the game, I'm looking at the white armor with the

[07:15] weird shark bite being taken out of it, when you look at that shark bite on the armor that's not

[07:20] how a shark's mouth is, it's not circular, it has more of an edge and a point to it and it doesn't

[07:26] even look like a shark bite, just looks weird to me you know, it just looks a little bit strange,

[07:30] it looks a little bit off and it looks like a Stern, it looks like Stern where they just kind of go

[07:34] far enough on everything but nothing really blows you away and that's my thing, I think this

[07:40] game is going to shoot great, it's a Keith Elwin game, we don't have to worry about that so it's

[07:44] going to be fun in terms of design and layout, the artwork is not really that amazing, like it

[07:50] feels very uninspired, we've seen much better art packages on pinball machines but I want to say this,

[07:57] I do like they went more simple on the artwork because Jaws should be more simple, I've said

[08:03] this from the very get go, they should make this game look a little bit more weathered and simple

[08:08] the way the movie poster is in the iconic movie poster and I think they nailed that, I really do,

[08:14] I think if you tried to fill every inch of play field with something detailed, the way Godzilla

[08:20] is, the way Zambietti did with Foo Fighters and did Venom, I don't think that works with Jaws so

[08:25] I'm kind of happy they went in this direction, now here's the thing about this game, it's Jaws,

[08:31] shark in the ocean, there's just nothing from a mechanical standpoint that simulates,

[08:37] like being in the ocean, is there going to be a buoy that pops up and down, I don't think so,

[08:43] there's no barrel that goes up and down, I'm really hoping that the Orca has movement, I can't

[08:49] tell yet but I really hope the Orca has some movement that feels like it's a boat on the ocean,

[08:56] you know when we first saw Pirates of the Caribbean, you know Jersey Jack's Pirates of the Caribbean

[09:00] and that pirate ship was rocking back and forth, that blew everybody away, we had never seen anyone

[09:07] do anything like that with an upper play field that was simulating a ship and then you look at

[09:12] this game and you're like there's nothing even close to remotely as interesting as that happening

[09:17] just yet so we shall see what happens with that Orca, it just feels like there's just something

[09:24] missing, like there's not that big shark attacking something, like there's not going to be that moment

[09:30] where the shark pops out of the game and takes a big bite out of the Orca, like if you look at

[09:35] the Orca right now, it's already got a big bite in it, like there's no shark that's going to come

[09:41] up and create a kinetic physical pinball moment where that happens and when I was thinking about

[09:46] Jaws, I mean how do you not have, Jaws pop up and have that yellow oxygen tank in its mouth and you

[09:55] get one shot to hit it and blow the shark up, I mean that's the iconic scene in the movie and again

[10:02] there's just not going to be that in this game so you could argue, Canada had expectations that were

[10:07] way too high from a mechanical standpoint and I probably did and I probably want creative stuff

[10:13] in pinball machines that might not even be physically possible or mechanically possible

[10:19] but then again at $13,000, $13,000 and Ghostbusters LE was $7,500 or $8,000,

[10:30] are you seeing $5,000 more in mechanical wow and Jaws than you did in freaking Ghostbusters

[10:38] and that's my point with all of this is like when a new pin gets released, how do you look at these

[10:44] games now and not think about the price? Are we supposed to just focus on the gameplay? Are we supposed

[10:51] to just focus on the code and I guess the price now and where pinball pricing is, it's almost like an

[10:57] annoying distraction to everything because none of these games should be this much money and I mean

[11:03] it and like when I'm looking down at this game, I'm just going to be honest for a minute, let me go

[11:06] in a little bit of a rant, this is not a $13,000 game, this is not a $13,000 game, there is no way

[11:13] this game should be $2,500 more than Godzilla was, there is no way it should be that much more,

[11:20] there's not as much artwork in it, there are not going to be as many assets in it, there aren't as

[11:25] many interesting mechanisms in it, so why is this game $2,500 more than Godzilla? I'm sorry,

[11:31] Godzilla has all the assets you're going to want if you're a Godzilla fan, they didn't even get Brody

[11:36] the main character from Jaws to be in the Jaws pinball machine and this is where I'm at people,

[11:41] is like this is just too much money and then I'm watching all these people lose all this money on

[11:46] all these LEs and that's my point, is this LE should have been 10,500 and the premium should be

[11:51] 8,500 and the freaking pro should be $6,000 and until we get pinball back to that place, every new

[11:58] launch, it's hard to look at it with enthusiasm because we know that the money's not going into

[12:04] these games, the money's just going to stern because they want to stop people from flipping a

[12:10] $10,000 Jaws, they don't want us to be able to make a couple thousand dollars on our investment,

[12:15] you know what's crazy right now is you actually lost less money if you bought a James Bond premium

[12:22] or a Foo Fighter premium, those games only lost $1,500 to $2,000, the LE versions of those games

[12:29] have lost $3,000, so as I look at Jaws LE on a random Tuesday the week the game is coming out

[12:37] and if you're going to ask me would I go in on a Jaws LE after seeing this game today,

[12:43] I don't know people, I really don't know what to tell you, the market's going to do what the market

[12:48] does but looking down at this game I see a fun Keith Elwyn game that should be $10,000 and a

[12:56] premium should be 8,500 and that's where I'm at with pinball, I'm just getting a little bit deflated

[13:01] by looking down at that game and saying hey this game's $13,000, I was deflated looking at Elton

[13:07] John for $15,000 and $12,000, all of these games are overpriced, they're all overpriced and are we

[13:14] not allowed to raise our expectations as we get these games and I think we're just feeling some of

[13:20] the burnout and after seeing this game today does this game feel like the white knight right, the

[13:27] great white shark, is this going to be the great white knight that saves pinball in 2024 and bails

[13:35] all these distributors out who are sitting on all these Venoms and James Bond premiums and all these

[13:40] expensive games and I'm here to tell you right now I think this is the beginning of the end of these

[13:46] ridiculous prices, I don't think this hobby is going to survive 2024 at these prices, there's no way,

[13:54] there's just no way we're going to absorb these games at these prices if this is what's going

[14:00] into pinball, there is a price limit we have on fun and I think for most people out there the most

[14:07] you want to spend on the creme de la creme version of a stern is $10,000 and the most you want to spend

[14:15] on a creme de la creme version of a jersey jack game is maybe $12,500, so let's talk about this game

[14:22] a little bit more. Alright so straight up the middle we've got the boat where you hit the kinetic

[14:26] ball, it looks like it hits three different targets and then the shark pops up to the right of that

[14:32] is that interesting spinning disc that is raised above the play field, it almost looks like the

[14:37] avengers wheel that's raised up, I think that's like a fishing lure that you're winding up as you

[14:43] go around it and it almost looks like it's the James Bond figure eight shot, I'm not sure and then

[14:49] up the middle too you've got I was wrong about this there is a little shark fin that pops up and

[14:55] goes across the play field it's the chum line apparently now here's what's weird about this

[15:00] thing it's only moving to the right so are you telling me that the shark is gonna have to swim

[15:06] backwards to get that target over to the left side I think it's gonna start on the left side then

[15:11] move to the right but again you know look you're designing a game about a great white shark and

[15:16] you're gonna have a fin that pops up from under the play field and for $13,000 the fin that pops

[15:23] up from under the play field is just a little plastic target with a shark fin sticker on it

[15:29] they couldn't even sculpt it to look just like a big fin I don't know people I don't know what to

[15:33] tell you I really don't know what to tell you again I think this game is gonna shoot great I think

[15:38] it's gonna have elwin flow I think it's gonna have a lot of different shots to hit I think it's

[15:43] gonna be fun it's gonna be fun I just don't see the 13k here and I think pinball is in for an

[15:50] interesting 2024 because now like if this game doesn't take off and light the pinball world on fire

[15:57] it's still May people it's still very early I am not sticking a fork in this shark just yet we have

[16:03] to see more gameplay we have to see the code we know the team over at stern is gonna do a good

[16:08] job on the code but I'm just a little bit worried without Brody that could really hamper this game

[16:16] in a way where Jurassic Park wasn't affected nearly as much because he's such a central figure in all

[16:22] the iconic lines in this movie but from what I can see in a few of the video clips I've seen in the

[16:27] video he's in some of those video clips so that makes me feel a little bit better you're gonna

[16:32] see him and then Jaws is gonna be out like this game is gonna be on the line they're gonna make

[16:36] thousands of these things and then what right what's next Jersey Jax game is dead on arrival with

[16:43] Elton John spooky pinball's got its two games already revealed and then what's next from stern

[16:49] like I don't know if this is the game that's gonna save stern in 2024 and looking at that huge factory

[16:55] and knowing that they need to crank out hundreds of games a week is this gonna be the game that

[17:01] everyone's gonna trade their godzilla's for and make room for and write checks for 10 to 13 thousand

[17:07] dollars is the pro gonna be enough like I don't know is the pro gonna have the upper playfield

[17:12] that's a huge question will the pro have the upper playfield it probably will not it's probably

[17:18] gonna be like foo fighters you're not gonna have that upper playfield look a lot more is coming

[17:24] this week I'm a little bit disappointed if you can hear it in my voice I'm a little bit disappointed

[17:30] I just expected a little bit more and the reason I'm disappointed is that the shark itself

[17:36] really should be doing more in a jaws pinball machine and again it's a great effort from stern

[17:43] at 10 500 for the le I just don't see 13k here let me know what you think how do you feel about

[17:50] the game is it blowing you away you know what are your thoughts again this is just me waiting for

[17:55] two years for this Keith elwin masterpiece and maybe all of us need to lower our expectations

[18:02] about what stern will put in a box but again at this much money why should we be lowering our

[18:08] expectations we should be raising them as you can tell I'm losing my voice so many more shows

[18:13] coming this week this is just one of many jaws episodes coming from canada everybody peace out

[18:18] we know all about you chief you don't go in the water at all do you some bad hat harry
