[00:00] I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know everything that's shining on is gonna be okay.

[00:09] I'll be fine once I get it.

[00:12] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast. Happy Monday morning. It is Expo week. Everyone is still alive and ticking and we have so much more to be thankful for in life than stuff we should be upset about.

[00:29] And I'm gonna talk about that on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast. All of our different pursuits of happiness in pinball and what it means to us and what we're gonna see at Pinball Expo.

[00:40] I'm gonna talk a little bit about the fact that they banned me from Pinball Expo. I haven't really brought it up that much but I wanna talk about it. I wanna just clear the air because people keep asking me independently if I'm gonna be there and no I'm not.

[00:51] And I'm gonna give you the truth about what went down and how it all transpired and it's kinda silly. But you know me, this is what I'm used to.

[00:59] Canada has been banned from all these forums and he's such a terrible toxic person. And you know, on Saturday morning spectacular, I got into it a little bit with Pinball artist Mr. Christopher Franchi and if you watch the show, at the end of the show, we went a little back and forth and here's the thing.

[01:16] I definitely wanna sit down and talk to Mr. Franchi. I love his artwork. I think he's one of the greatest pinball artists in the history of pinball artists. But if we're gonna do it, we're gonna do it right.

[01:27] And I think him and I should just talk live to each other. That's how it's gonna go down. We're not gonna do a pre-recorded show. I'm not gonna have to edit anything.

[01:37] Is there any more fair medium than a live chat between two larger than life pinball personalities? And I don't expect it to be a battle royale. I'm not mad at him. I don't hate him. I don't hate anybody in pinball.

[01:51] You know what he said to me? He said, he can't have me on his show because his co-hosts hate me. And I think hate is a really strong word. And I don't think that word should be thrown around in the pinball hobby.

[02:03] I don't think hate should be thrown around in any hobby. Why would you be a part of a hobby if there's things in it that make you hate people? There's no room for hate in pinball, right?

[02:13] I could really, really, really be upset with Jersey Jack Pinball for charging this much money for Toy Story with no toys in it. But I don't hate people over there.

[02:22] I don't hate Pat Lawler for fumbling this game. Everyone is trying their best to do what they can do in this hobby.

[02:28] Everyone's trying to make their best content, their best games. But we should not be saying, I hate you. When it goes that far, I believe when you get that upset and you get that riled up about people in pinball, it's time to hit pause.

[02:43] It's time to take a break. Now look, I know there are a lot of people out there. And I mean, I'm going to go right into the expo story right now.

[02:50] There are people out there in the pinball world that absolutely, certifiably, hate me. And I don't know who they are, right? I mean, you could probably make a pretty long list of people who hate Canada or have reasons to hate Canada.

[03:05] There are definitely manufacturers out there who probably don't like me. I've been called unkind. I've been called toxic. I've been called narcissistic.

[03:14] But here's the thing. Every single pinball company out there who's successful, they don't care what Canada says. They're too busy taking care of business.

[03:24] And I'm just going to say this and I normally don't reveal like what goes on behind the scenes. But I have a good rapport with Mr. George Gomez.

[03:31] I can still talk to the gang over at Spooky. David Fix and I have a relationship. Barry over at Dutch Pinball will talk to me. Jack Winnari talks to me.

[03:39] I think everyone who's out there who's making pinball machines, that's their focus. And I think if you zoom out a little bit, all of these pinball companies know one thing.

[03:48] They have to know this about Canada's Pinball Podcast that this podcast is good for pinball. It's not a podcast which Christopher Franci said is about me hating on pinball.

[03:59] If this was a podcast in which I hate pinball, I would challenge anybody to find a sound clip that says I hate pinball. No, I don't hate pinball.

[04:10] The only thing I really hate in pinball, I mean this when I say the only thing I really hate in this hobby and there's not a lot.

[04:16] The only thing I really hate are nonrefundable deposits. Okay, I really hate that. I don't like the high pricing, but I don't hate it.

[04:24] I mean, I know why these companies are doing it, but when people say they hate you. So here's what went down with Expo and it's a little unfortunate because I was planning to go.

[04:32] I haven't had many vacations or time off since having Killian. Thankfully, my beautiful wife Brenda got me the trip to Vegas, but here's what happened.

[04:40] I booked my hotel room to Expo months ago. And about a month ago, I got a note from Rob Burke over at Pinball Expo saying that because I snuck into the exit of last year's show

[04:53] and did a walk around of Expo that I was banned from the show. Like that's the reason he gave me. And I knew it was a bogus reason because I was talking to a moto and all the other pinball content creators.

[05:04] We all did that because they didn't open the show up for media early. So we just went in and we walked around. We showed everybody what was going to be at Expo and you watch those lives and they were great.

[05:16] All that did was really celebrate what was going on at the show. We didn't spoil anything. We didn't reveal a game that wasn't supposed to be revealed. We didn't ruin anyone's seminar moment.

[05:27] We just walked around and said, Hey, here's what's going on at Pinball Expo. So that's not the real reason. That's the reason Rob Burke gave me.

[05:35] And then I heard other reasons from David Fix. Here's the overall reason I'm getting. I am hearing that there are other people going to Expo who did not want me there.

[05:45] And they said basically they wouldn't go if Canada went. So then it was an easy decision. Let's just get rid of Canada's presence at the show and everyone will have a better time.

[05:56] I wholeheartedly disagree that a show is better because I'm not there. I think people who love this show and are going to be there would have loved to have hung out with me.

[06:04] And as all of us know, the shows are all about hanging out with people and having a good time.

[06:09] I was hanging out last night with Benjamin from France, a Canadian club member who's in New York City on his way to Chicago for Pinball Expo.

[06:17] And we hung out last night with his co-worker Pat from Ireland who actually grew up across the street from Brenda's house.

[06:25] He went to the school that's across from where my wife lived as a child. It's unbelievable how small the world is.

[06:32] And that's why I love this hobby because it brings people together from all over the world.

[06:37] And so look, unfortunately, I won't be there. I've canceled my hotel room. I've canceled my flights.

[06:43] You know, and I think all this does whenever they do this, whenever they ban me from going to a show like I'm some big bad wolf, all it does is make the Canada club stronger.

[06:55] It just makes the words I say more impactful and more meaningful because we are all grown men, right?

[07:02] How silly is it in a world in which there is warfare going on, in a world in which kids have diseases, in a world in which there is so much poverty,

[07:12] in a world in which there is so much real evil and real toxicity in the world that you are going to prevent a pinball personality from going to a show

[07:22] to celebrate the one thing we all love. Like that is so strange to me. And here's the hardest part for me is I'm very transparent.

[07:30] I'm very out in the open. If I don't like something, you're going to know it came from me.

[07:35] But all those people out there who don't like me, they hide in the shadows. They don't reveal who they are.

[07:41] They don't want to stand in front of it. They want to complain behind the curtain and there's nothing I can do.

[07:46] I can't defend myself. I can't have a conversation with them. I don't even know who they are.

[07:52] So all I can say is this, if you're going to Pinball Expo, have a good time. You're going to have a good time.

[07:59] Hang out with people, drink some booze. Don't worry about the outside world.

[08:04] It's a tiny little bubble of a bunch of geeks and nerds that nobody else on the planet really understands.

[08:10] We are a little circle of nerds and geeks. People think we're losers, right?

[08:16] So it's funny that we turn on each other so much. It's funny that we bicker and fight so much.

[08:21] When I go on Pinside and I see the level of anger towards each other, it's so weird.

[08:27] Everyone in this hobby should realize this. We're the ones who need to be in it together, us as a community,

[08:33] because everybody else thinks we are in an arrested state of development.

[08:38] They think we can't grow up. They think we have our priorities all wrong. They think we are losers.

[08:44] If you remember the arcades in the 80s and 90s people, and I'm speaking to a lot of you out there,

[08:49] the Cool Kids did not play Pinball. Pinball was where the older guys who were smoking, who were really too old to be in that arcade,

[08:57] that's who was playing the Pinball machines. All the Cool Kids were playing Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat and Daytona USA.

[09:05] I grew up in the arcade culture and I remember you hopped on a Pinball machine when the Street Fighter machines were occupied.

[09:12] No one ran to the arcade as a kid to go play Adams Family Pinball. No, it just didn't happen.

[09:17] So we're just all in this together. I want to say moving forward, and I encourage Franchi to do this,

[09:23] moving forward, if someone has a problem with the Canadian Pinball Podcast, just come to me.

[09:27] If you know someone who doesn't like the show, have them hit me up. I would love to have a conversation with them.

[09:32] I would love to have a beer with them and talk about why they don't like me so much.

[09:36] The reason why I titled this show, Just Do It Makes You Happy and Pinball, that is the only real lesson that matters in all of this.

[09:44] It doesn't matter what Stern makes or Jersey Jack makes or what these games are.

[09:49] Each of you is on a pursuit of happiness. What will make you happy in life?

[09:54] For some of you, you love unboxing games every year. For some of you, you can easily afford it.

[10:00] For some of you, you can't. And that's what makes each of our lives beautiful, is that we're all different.

[10:06] We all come from different places. We have different jobs. We have different need states. We have different things we love.

[10:12] You know what I love about Pinball? Is that no game is universally loved by everybody.

[10:17] Like some people love Godzilla. I talk to people who hate Godzilla. They don't like it, but they can never say it because if they say it on pin side,

[10:25] they'll be attacked by the Elwin army. See, that's why this hobby is so fun because every few months, a new game comes out and we get to have our opinions on it.

[10:35] And I love that about Pinball. And my pursuit of Pinball happiness is right here.

[10:40] I love doing this show more than playing Pinball. I think it's quite clear that that's the case, right?

[10:46] I've done 733 episodes about Pinball. I have not reviewed 733 games. I don't talk to you about rulesets.

[10:54] I don't talk to you about scoring strategies. I talk to you about the hobby and I try to capture what's going on in this hobby.

[11:01] And I love it. You know what I love too about this hobby is it's always changing.

[11:05] You know, people will ask me like, what do you talk about? How do you find topics?

[11:08] And I would argue there is always something to talk about that's new and interesting in Pinball because the Pinball community changes with the tides, right?

[11:17] Look at Pinball now. Did any of us ever think we'd be paying this much for games? None of us thought that way.

[11:23] Five years ago, nobody thought every single game coming out would be over $10,000 with like taxes and shipping.

[11:30] Nobody thought that. So that has changed like the way we're looking at Pinball.

[11:34] And what excites me about that is now our expectations are super high because they need to be.

[11:40] So speaking of super high expectations, there's going to be a lot of conversation when we finally see James Bond.

[11:47] Here's my prediction on the James Bond stream.

[11:50] I think the game is going to be a James Bond fans like Dream Come True because I think you're going to see a ton of clips.

[11:56] But I think people are going to start to look at all of these games like they're kind of not worth this much money.

[12:03] And I mean that and you can see it in the Toy Story thread. You can see it like if people are like if this game was eight or nine grand,

[12:10] I could look at it differently and I absolutely think you have to look at a game differently based upon what it costs.

[12:17] Let me ask all of you a question.

[12:19] If you go into McDonald's and you have a quarter pounder with cheese, it's a delicious meal, right?

[12:25] How much does it cost you? It's like what $6.95 and you have this delicious cheeseburger.

[12:32] Okay, if you walked into McDonald's and that burger was $25, would you look at it the same way?

[12:38] It's still a delicious burger, but would you want to spend $25 on it?

[12:43] Probably not. And that's what's happening in Pinball.

[12:46] All Pinball on some level to each of us is delicious.

[12:50] It's fun. Like it's a toy. It's a game.

[12:53] But I'm going to look at a $13,000 Stern LE differently than an $8,000 Stern LE.

[13:00] And I think everybody is and that's what's really interesting.

[13:03] Now, when I look at the game and I look at what we're getting for $13 versus what we used to get for $8,000,

[13:10] I come to a very simple conclusion.

[13:12] I don't see the value. I don't see the value in these super expensive games and it's like nobody else wants to say it.

[13:19] I'm listening to all the other shows and everyone's like, yeah, you know, and Canada was the one who said they could raise prices.

[13:25] Yeah, I did and they are and look what's happening.

[13:27] They're probably going to be successful at it.

[13:29] But you know what's awesome? You know what's awesome because the more this goes up and up and up,

[13:33] the more people are going to say no, no, no, and the more people are going to look for more, more, more.

[13:38] And the more people are going to look for a dream theme that they want to bolt to the ground and the days of like shuffling games in and out of your home are going to be over.

[13:45] Maybe not for good, but I think the days of buying new in box over and over and over again are going to be over because I think these things are going to start to depreciate much more than they ever did before.

[13:55] And the only place for the price to go down is south.

[13:58] And I think the big issue and I mean this, Canada means this.

[14:02] The big issue in 2023 is going to be every single distributor is going to have an abundance of inventory.

[14:12] They cannot move.

[14:13] We are going to see an absolute flipping upside down of where the community was a year ago when COVID hit in which nobody had any games in stock to sell.

[14:23] What's going to happen in 2023 when the market goes down the toilet, which it is going down the toilet.

[14:29] I mean like the world global economic market as it goes down the toilet, you're going to see people pausing on buying new pinball machines and you're going to see dealers over stocked.

[14:40] The reason they're going to be over stocked is that all the policies that are in place on how distros get games, they were set up when times were great.

[14:49] And every dealer wanted to get as many LEs as they could because they would sell out instantly.

[14:54] And then to get those LEs you had to buy a bunch of pros and premiums.

[14:58] But the problem now is when you sit on that pro and premium inventory and you can't lower the price and who's going to run in by a $9700 premium

[15:08] where they're going to make limitless amounts of them and they're going to make them for five years.

[15:13] So why would you go buy a $9700 premium the first year the game comes out?

[15:19] Because everyone's going to know this.

[15:20] If you just wait and don't buy it new in box, you can go get that $9700 premium for $8000 and a homeowner will take better care of it than the damn shipping company.

[15:32] And then here's the other good part when you finally buy the game.

[15:36] If you let the FOMO pass by, you will buy the game when the code is actually done.

[15:42] Right? We are buying these games incomplete.

[15:44] James Bond is going to be incomplete for an entire year.

[15:50] So ask yourselves, why do you need to own James Bond right now?

[15:54] Why do you want to play the game when the sausage isn't fully made?

[15:59] If you wait a year, you'll be able to get the game.

[16:02] It'll be brand spanking new.

[16:04] Everything's going to have less than 200 plays and then you'll get to experience the game the way it was supposed to be experienced in complete form.

[16:13] The other scary part that I haven't talked about on this show, which is going to be interesting, did you see what Stern said about Stern Insider Connected?

[16:21] I think Stern's going to require you to sign up for Insider Connected to unlock features of the game.

[16:27] That is the next thing that's coming in pinball, all the DLC.

[16:30] It's coming.

[16:31] Stern has a strategy.

[16:33] For me, I think all of these pinball companies' strategies were set in place during a bull market.

[16:39] And I think it's going to be interesting to see how these companies sort of shift gears if the economy goes down.

[16:45] And look, when people say like, oh, you know, pinball survived the recession of 2008.

[16:49] Don't forget this.

[16:50] In 2008, when pinball survived the recession, there was only one pinball company making games.

[16:57] Now we have like 10.

[16:58] Back then, if we look at the price of a Stern machine back in 2008, if we adjust that for inflation, those games were still cheaper back then than the games are currently when you look at the inflation and you do the adjustment for it.

[17:11] So look, it's going to be really interesting.

[17:13] I'm going to be here along for the ride.

[17:15] I'm going to be here talking about the James Bond stream when we see it.

[17:18] I am going to be your venerable pinball servant.

[17:22] I'm not going to go away.

[17:23] I'm not going to let the haters deter me.

[17:26] This is the greatest pinball podcast in the world.

[17:29] It is.

[17:30] And I know it is.

[17:31] And it's the most entertaining.

[17:32] We are not afraid to talk to anybody.

[17:34] We are not afraid to go after the issues in pinball.

[17:37] We're not afraid to go underneath the surface of what's happening in pinball.

[17:41] We are not here to give every game a good review.

[17:44] There are failing games in pinball, right?

[17:46] And that's the thing.

[17:47] People are talking about this.

[17:48] If you're going to review pinball machines, you got to be able to give some games a DNNF.

[17:52] If you don't have a failing game, like a game like Thunderbirds,

[17:55] is an F. That's it.

[17:57] So I want each and every one of you to enjoy pinball expo.

[18:00] I think we're going to have a lot to talk about with this James Bond stream.

[18:04] And the other big question mark is where's the Keith Elwyn game?

[18:08] Isn't it weird that Stern like announced this game in a press release?

[18:12] And then the photo leaked and they've said nothing else about the game.

[18:17] I don't think we're going to see the Elwyn machine until like December.

[18:22] But here's what's weird, right?

[18:23] It's like for some of you James Bond fans out there,

[18:26] how do you feel good about buying a $13,000 LE when you might want the Keith Elwyn game instead?

[18:34] Shouldn't Stern show you everything available before they take your money?

[18:38] If I were you just listen to Canada, I would just wait.

[18:42] Don't run to buy this game.

[18:44] It is not going to be hard to get a James Bond LE.

[18:47] If you don't think so, go look at the marketplace on pinside.

[18:50] You could easily get this game right now for like $14,000, $15,000.

[18:55] And look, it's going to keep coming down.

[18:56] The price is not going to keep going up.

[18:58] The price is going to go down because a thousand of anything is not very limited.

[19:03] All right, there are not that many people that wake up and want to drop 15K on a pinball machine.

[19:08] Okay, there's just not that many.

[19:09] But look, find your own path of happiness in pinball.

[19:12] And I'm glad that for each and every one of you listening to this right now,

[19:15] part of what makes you happy in pinball is Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[19:19] And that makes me super happy.

[19:21] And seeing these club members every month makes me super happy.

[19:24] I put the challenge out there to you guys.

[19:26] Invite a friend.

[19:27] We can get back up to 560.

[19:29] 560 was never a target.

[19:30] We can get to a thousand subscribers eventually.

[19:33] We're going to get there.

[19:34] We're going to get there.

[19:35] And the greatest thing to help me market this show is everybody else not getting to the point right away.

[19:40] Everybody love you guys.

[19:41] Have a happy Monday.

[19:42] And I'll talk to you soon.

[19:49] I'm not sure what's going to happen.

[19:56] I'm not sure what's going to happen.

[20:05] I'm not sure what's going to happen.

[20:15] I'm not sure what's going to happen.
