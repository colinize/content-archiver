[00:00] JUST YOU

[00:30] Welcome to Episode 175 of Canadian Pimbal Podcast.

[00:54] We're almost two years now.

[00:56] It's been just you and I.

[01:01] Sharing our love of Pimbal, right?

[01:04] Isn't that why we're in this hobby?

[01:06] Is that we love Pimbal?

[01:08] And I want to start out this podcast where we're going to go into Guardians of the Galaxy

[01:13] and what's going to be in the game and a couple other news items in Pimbal.

[01:18] But before I start out, I just have to say one thing and I was just reading the Guardians

[01:22] of the Galaxy thread tonight.

[01:24] I don't want to say this.

[01:26] After reading that Pimbal thread for a couple of hours, you would have thought that Stern

[01:31] Pimbal announced that they're not going to make Guardians of the Galaxy.

[01:36] That Stern Pimbal announced that they've taken everyone's Guardians pre-order money

[01:41] and then they're not going to ship you a game for three years.

[01:45] The amount of bitching, moaning and groaning that goes on on Pimbal.

[01:51] After Stern showcases what I believe to be one of the most beautiful Pimbal machines

[01:57] they've ever made, absolutely makes me want to just like walk away from this hobby.

[02:04] Because I'll tell you why.

[02:05] There are so many of you out there that nothing makes you happy in Pimbal.

[02:11] You literally live on Pinside and argue back and forth about the most idiotic stuff

[02:18] on a daily basis and you need to hit time out, step back and ask yourselves, am I really

[02:25] complaining about the fact that Stern Pimbal is going to make Guardians of the Galaxy

[02:32] Pimbal machine that I can own in just a few months and I am guaranteed to get the machine.

[02:40] Sure, there are little issues here and there that you might want to discuss, but for the

[02:46] most part, it's not a discussion.

[02:48] It's a bunch of crying and moaning and groaning and it gets so freaking old.

[02:56] Here's the thing, nobody's even flipped this machine yet.

[03:00] All you have to go on right now is the art package by Christopher Franchi and the layout

[03:07] by John Borg, both of which are pretty freaking incredible.

[03:13] If you're complaining that you're getting the best of Iron Man, the best of Metallica

[03:18] and one of the best art packages of all time and you want to complain, it boggles my mind.

[03:27] Let Stern show you what condition the code is in.

[03:31] The other part that is just like this never ending, oh my god, if you are concerned about

[03:39] what condition the code will be in, here's something you could go do.

[03:44] Just don't buy it until you're comfortable with where the code is at.

[03:49] There is nobody making you buy these games on day one.

[03:53] You don't have to go in.

[03:55] If you go in on day one and the code is not complete, you know that's how things happen

[04:02] in this hobby.

[04:04] Who you want, shame on me, fool you twice, shame on you.

[04:08] I got that backwards, didn't I?

[04:09] It's only one shame on me.

[04:10] I don't even care.

[04:11] You know the phrase, alright, it's 175, I'm not even drinking, I'm messing up phrases.

[04:17] But here's the thing, here's the thing.

[04:19] Just step away from the computer, step away and you'll realize that most of the world

[04:26] doesn't even realize there's new pinball machines, alright?

[04:29] I know I'm very critical of pinball machines at times, but I think I fire arrows when arrows

[04:36] need to be fired, okay?

[04:39] I think there is nothing that you have to go on right now that is cause for concern of

[04:44] guardians of the galaxy.

[04:46] And if you can't get excited for this pinball machine, I kind of think there's something

[04:50] wrong with you.

[04:51] I really do.

[04:52] I really do.

[04:54] I think between guardians and pirates of the Caribbean and Houdini, it's a really

[04:59] freaking exciting time in pinball.

[05:02] And the things that you should complain about are the companies that have truly, truly

[05:08] fucked people over, like, for real.

[05:11] Like people got fucked over by highway, by Dutch, by Skit B, by John Papaduke, erase

[05:19] those cancers from this hobby.

[05:21] No one's really getting hurt by buying a Batman 66 and having to wait a long time for

[05:28] that code.

[05:29] But why?

[05:30] Because the code's gonna probably be great one day and everyone who has that machine will

[05:34] be happy.

[05:35] You know why I know this?

[05:37] Because none of them are going up for sale.

[05:41] People are holding on.

[05:42] Alright, that was my little five minute rant about how annoying it is to go into a thread

[05:49] like guardians and see people say like this about that, about the artwork, about spike

[05:55] versus Sam about Arosmith layout, about plastic ramps versus metal ramps.

[06:01] Oh, Knaid, there's no spinners in the pro.

[06:05] How could they do this?

[06:06] How could Stern take spinners out?

[06:08] I was gonna do a whole pin sight baby episode on pinball spinners.

[06:13] You know, I draw the line, Stern.

[06:16] I'm not buying a premium.

[06:18] If my premium spinners are found in the pro, I'm the only one who's happy, man.

[06:23] You pro guys don't deserve spinners.

[06:26] You don't, you cheap bastards.

[06:28] You take the machine, you get.

[06:30] If you want spinners, work harder, get a better education and buy yourself some fucking

[06:35] spinners, you fucking babies.

[06:37] Oh my god.

[06:39] If you ever don't want to get laid in life, simply go into a bar and say, hey baby girl,

[06:45] let me tell you something.

[06:47] There's no spinners in guardians of the galaxy pro.

[06:51] And watch her slap you in the fucking face.

[06:55] All right.

[06:56] Are we ready for 175 to kick off?

[06:59] All right.

[07:00] So, on this episode, I wanna talk about where we are with Guardians of the Galaxy and the

[07:06] big question everyone has is what music will be in the game?

[07:10] And I said on my last podcast, as of back then, I think it was Monday, Stern had not yet

[07:16] confirmed that there was going to be music in the game.

[07:21] I also said the first job of Zack Sharp should be to increase communication.

[07:27] And what happens?

[07:28] The very next day, on that Tuesday, we get what they're calling a Stern of the Union

[07:35] Address, where Stern is gonna tell us on the first Tuesday of every month, I think it

[07:39] is what's going on with the company.

[07:42] And I just wanna say, I applaud this.

[07:43] I think this is absolutely awesome.

[07:46] I think this is great.

[07:47] I think this is what people have been waiting for.

[07:50] Just reading that stuff that they put in that update is great.

[07:53] They talked about Batman code.

[07:54] They talked about Kiss code.

[07:56] They talked about Guardians of the Galaxy.

[07:59] Let's start off with what they said about Guardians of the Galaxy.

[08:02] I wanna read it for you right now.

[08:05] And they said, let's see, Guardians of the Galaxy.

[08:10] In case you haven't already heard or seen the news, we have just announced our newest

[08:15] game based on the popular movie franchise Guardians of the Galaxy exclamation point.

[08:21] The music package will include pop songs.

[08:25] And if you happen to be attending the IAAPA show in Orlando, which starts November 14th,

[08:33] we will be at booth number 2013, where you can come check out the game in person.

[08:40] Otherwise set a reminder on your personal calendars as we will be having the official

[08:45] Dead Flip gameplay stream with Jack Danger on Monday, November 20th at 6pm, Central Standard

[08:51] Time.

[08:52] Alright, now when people read that paragraph, I don't know about you guys, but when I read

[08:56] it, the first thing that jumped out at me was pop songs.

[09:00] Like, what is Stern talking about?

[09:04] Pop songs, okay?

[09:05] So I was confused by that.

[09:07] And they didn't say what we all wanted to hear, which was in the game, we will be featuring

[09:14] some of the officially licensed tracks from the movie, or songs from the official soundtrack

[09:21] of Guardians of the Galaxy.

[09:23] They said there's going to be pop songs.

[09:25] And then I started thinking to myself, picture this.

[09:29] Alright, picture this, Zach Sharp, brand new marketing guy at Stern.

[09:34] He's probably thinking to himself, you know what?

[09:37] To sell more games, we should really put more contemporary music into them, right?

[09:43] That's how we can get a younger audience to play Pimba.

[09:46] And he's probably going down the list of the sound track from Guardians of the Galaxy.

[09:52] And he's saying, man, all these songs came out in the 70s.

[09:55] And none of these young millennials, they weren't even born then.

[09:59] So I just had this image of like Zach calling Gary Stern into the room, calling Keith

[10:05] Ellen into the room, calling John Borrigan into the room, calling George Gomez into the

[10:09] room, calling Jared into the room, calling Jody into the room.

[10:13] He's like, guys, I've got an idea.

[10:16] And right there is a Guardians of the Galaxy machine.

[10:18] And he's like, you know what?

[10:21] Imagine hitting the start button and all of a sudden this goes on.

[10:27] Gary starts dancing, joting him or going crazy, Gomez slaps Gary high five.

[10:33] Oh, yeah, hot music and Guardians of the Galaxy.

[10:41] Jared rips his shirt off.

[10:50] He's rubbing his belly against Gary's forehead.

[10:53] Ellen and Gomez are just embracing each other.

[10:56] Beautiful.

[10:58] Well, maybe that's not exactly how it went down at Stern, but maybe.

[11:03] And maybe you never know.

[11:04] You never know.

[11:05] But I want to say this.

[11:07] And words, pop music, just really, really strange use of word.

[11:11] I think you all agree.

[11:13] But the rumor is this, that two of the songs from the movie will be in the Pimbal machine.

[11:19] So here's what I want to do.

[11:20] I want to go down and play for you a clip from each of the songs that are in the first

[11:25] Guardians movie.

[11:26] And I want us to evaluate these songs with two criteria.

[11:32] Then does this song sound like pop music?

[11:36] Two, would this be a good song for the Pimbal machine?

[11:41] And then maybe three will ask ourselves realistically, do we think this song can make

[11:45] its way into the machine?

[11:47] Before I do that, I want to say one thing.

[11:49] I had a lot of fun listening to all 12 songs that are in the movie.

[11:53] I had a lot of fun.

[11:55] And I kept thinking to myself, as I was listening to this stuff, music is really the greatest

[12:01] thing on the planet.

[12:02] It really is.

[12:03] And music is free.

[12:06] Music just puts you in a good mood.

[12:08] And after listening to these songs, I was like in such a good mood because the songs are

[12:12] so good.

[12:14] They make that movie so good.

[12:17] You know, we talk so much about how Pimbal is this social thing and it's so much fun.

[12:23] At the end of the day, you could invite your friends over and get a great bottle of whiskey

[12:30] and put on these 12 songs and probably have more fun just hanging out, talking, shooting

[12:37] the shit, listening to this music, then you could if you bought a $9,000 Pimbal machine,

[12:45] right?

[12:46] Music just kills Pimbal in terms of enjoyment and happiness and joy that it brings to

[12:52] the world.

[12:53] It just does.

[12:54] I just, I just something about it.

[12:56] Now music inside a Pimbal machine, that is where the awesomeness lies.

[13:04] So that's why people are so hoping these songs make it in.

[13:08] Okay, starting off with number one, these songs, which I think most of you want in this

[13:15] game.

[13:16] Let's play it right now.

[13:18] So freaking good.

[13:44] It has to be in the game.

[13:45] It just has to be like if there's one song, you need to Uka-chaka, Uka-chaka.

[13:51] You need that to start the game up.

[13:53] So that was hooked on a feeling performed by Blue Swade and okay, so let's ask ourselves,

[14:01] is that pop music?

[14:02] Absolutely not.

[14:03] That is not pop music.

[14:06] Would it be great for the Pimbal machine?

[14:08] Absolutely.

[14:09] I just think this has to be in the game.

[14:11] I think you all agree and could this be in a game?

[14:14] Well, last time I checked Blue Swade's hooked on a feeling, probably not the most expensive

[14:19] track to license.

[14:20] So I think yes, there is a very good possibility that could be in the game.

[14:23] It has to be in the game.

[14:25] Here is number two on our list.

[14:41] All right, so that was go all the way by the Razzberries and I have to say, you know,

[15:00] is that a pop song?

[15:02] Of course that's not a pop song.

[15:04] I also don't think that song would be really good for Pimbal, right?

[15:08] Pimbal has more action and has more pace and maybe throw that song into the menu screen,

[15:14] but I think that that is not a song that will make its way into the album.

[15:18] All right, let's go to number three.

[15:51] All right, that song is awesome.

[15:54] That is spirit in the sky performed by Norman Greenbaum and you know, that song would make

[16:00] an awesome, awesome song in a Pimbal machine.

[16:04] Great, great song.

[16:05] Got a lot of energy.

[16:06] It's still not pop music.

[16:09] We may not find anything that's really poppy.

[16:11] Some of them are more than others, but that is definitely not pop music, but that song

[16:15] would be awesome in the machine, right?

[16:18] You're starting to get torn a little bit, right?

[16:19] Because if you can only have two, I would definitely want hooked on a feeling and I would

[16:24] love to have spirit in the sky.

[16:25] But there's more songs coming up that you're also going to want in this machine.

[16:29] It's really unfair to only put two songs in a machine.

[16:34] It's like going to a concert with, you know, to hear one of your favorite bands and they're

[16:39] like, hey guys, welcome out tonight to Madison Square Garden.

[16:42] We're guns and roses.

[16:44] We're going to play two songs tonight and then go home.

[16:47] Which two would you like to hear?

[16:48] I mean, that's kind of what this feels like.

[16:51] It sucks.

[16:52] Maybe there's going to be more than two.

[16:53] Who knows?

[16:54] Who knows?

[16:55] I mean, some of these don't feel like they're going to be that expensive.

[16:57] Let's go on to track number four.

[17:17] All right.

[17:25] Well, that was Mr. David Bowie, Moonage Daydream.

[17:29] Whenever we hear that song, it sounds like it belongs more like in the big Lebowski than

[17:33] Guardian to the Galaxy.

[17:35] Look, I don't, that's definitely not pop music.

[17:39] Do I think that would be a good song for a pinball machine?

[17:43] You know, I kind of do.

[17:44] I'll tell you why.

[17:45] I got that like trippy vibe.

[17:47] I think that kind of song would work really well with a game that has all these full RGB

[17:53] LEDs, kind of like a little psychedelic sort of break sort of mode.

[17:57] You know, it just, it would work well.

[18:00] It doesn't have the energy of some of the other songs we've heard, but it would work

[18:04] well.

[18:05] Now, do I think Stern would ever be able to pay the money to license a David Bowie song?

[18:12] There is no way they would ever do it.

[18:16] So I think that we can remove this from one of the songs that will be in the game.

[18:21] All right.

[18:22] Number five.

[18:23] I must have been through about a million girls.

[18:28] I love a man I leave him alone.

[18:33] I didn't care how worse they're kind of sad.

[18:41] All right.

[18:42] So that was Fooled Around and Fell in Love by Elvin Bishop.

[19:05] And it is not a pop song.

[19:07] And it's, you know, another one of these songs where it's, I don't really think it'd be

[19:11] good for pinball.

[19:13] Again, this doesn't have enough of like the energy.

[19:17] And so for that reason, I don't think that song is going to be one of the ones that Stern

[19:22] Chase is after for this pinball machine.

[19:24] All right.

[19:25] Let's go to number six.

[19:26] Number six.

[19:31] Number six.

[19:46] Number six.

[19:52] Number six.

[19:53] The singer has a diss was the song that Hilton sang to Andrew Highway to get Andrew Highway

[19:59] to send him one of the first alien pinball machines he shipped.

[20:03] I mean that's the rumor.

[20:04] Okay.

[20:05] So that song was, I'm not in love performed by 10CC.

[20:11] Uh, look, not pop song.

[20:15] Not gonna make it to any pinball machine.

[20:16] That is just another one of the slow ones.

[20:18] But this next one, this next one would be the perfect song to be an opinion.

[20:23] Pinball machine to get the energy going and let's play it for you right now.

[20:28] The head gets to my toe, I don't want you around.

[20:32] Those bitter faces always make you stand out in the crowd.

[20:37] Let's show the one you throw the bunch of wingless looks all at two.

[20:42] Now it's much too late for me.

[20:44] Take a second look.

[20:46] I think we can fairly say that that is a pop song.

[21:09] That there is one pop song in the soundtrack.

[21:13] So does that mean because Stern said pop music, they're going to get the Jackson Fives.

[21:18] I want you back.

[21:19] I think the odds of getting this song into the game are about the same odds or the same

[21:24] chances that Stern will sell out of WWE Ellie machines.

[21:31] Super expensive title to license.

[21:33] I don't think this one is going to make it.

[21:36] It is an awesome song though.

[21:38] It would make for a brilliant song and a pinball machine.

[21:41] Again, light shows, mode starts, that opening chord comes into that song and man you're

[21:47] adrenaline and it's pumping.

[21:49] Pumping.

[21:50] I think the lesson too as we hear these tracks, right?

[21:52] This is just case in point that most pinball like music, just original scores, can't hold

[22:00] a candle to the music we hear in movies or in video games and I think it's a big issue

[22:06] with pinball.

[22:07] I think that music is one of the biggest missing components that gets your blood going and

[22:13] gets the adrenaline going when you're playing pinball and I know it's hard to license some

[22:17] of these songs but I'd rather have two pinball machines a year that are amazing with awesome

[22:22] license and music versus four to five machines where we can't afford to because we put money

[22:28] in other areas.

[22:29] You know, all the money they lost on Mustang and WWE could have been another few songs

[22:34] that went into Guardians of the Galaxy.

[22:36] Alright, let's play the next track for you guys.

[23:04] Well, that was coming to get your love by Redbone and you know, maybe you can consider

[23:08] that a pop track.

[23:09] I think so.

[23:10] Mainly because that song was recreated by the Ultimate Pop Act of all time and you know

[23:18] who I'm talking about.

[23:19] You know who I'm talking about, Hilton, the real McCoy.

[23:34] I feel like that's what Hilton sings when he stares at his broken Xenomorph head.

[23:45] Alright, so that was coming to get your love and that was performed by Redbone.

[23:51] So like I don't, you know, I think there might be a good chance that that song makes it

[23:57] in.

[23:58] I do.

[23:59] When I hear pop music, I think I could see Uka Shaka and come and get your love being

[24:04] one of the tracks that might make it into the game.

[24:07] I'm not that I wanted to be that track but I think that could be one that's in contention.

[24:12] I think this next song though, if I had to take a guess, I think Hooked on a Feeling

[24:17] and this next song are going to be the two tracks that make it into the game and that

[24:22] song is.

[24:23] Today is David Holt and David Scuplow.

[24:44] I can't tell if that song would make thatка so bad, because we didn't hear it.

[24:53] until that song will get absolutely annoying after a while

[24:57] or it'll be awesome to have in a pinball machine.

[25:00] I'm like divided, but I do think that that song

[25:04] is going to be in the machine.

[25:05] I think it is a good song for pinball

[25:08] and that was Sherry Bomb performed by the runaways.

[25:13] And it's not gonna be an expensive song to license.

[25:16] That's why I think there's a good chance

[25:17] of that making it into the game.

[25:19] Now, I'm gonna play the final three songs together.

[25:22] And there's one of these songs I just wish

[25:24] would be in the pinball machine.

[25:26] I think it would make for the ultimate

[25:28] like wizard mode song to have in the game.

[25:31] And if I could beg, Stern, beg,

[25:34] I'm gonna want one of these three songs in the game.

[25:37] I'm gonna play them all three of them for you right now.

[25:40] If you like me to come on us,

[25:43] get caught in the rain.

[25:47] If you're not to your gun,

[25:50] if you have a brain,

[25:53] if you like me to love it midnight,

[25:57] in the doom, summer cake,

[26:00] I'm the love that you've looked for.

[26:04] Right to me, I just stay.

[26:07] Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier.

[26:13] Ooh, child, things are gonna get brighter.

[26:17] Some day, yeah, put it together

[26:21] and we'll get it done.

[26:23] Some day, when you hit it much lighter.

[26:28] Some day, yeah, we'll walk in the rays

[26:32] of a beautiful sun.

[26:34] Some day, when the world is much brighter.

[26:38] Listen to me, baby.

[26:40] Ain't no mountain high, ain't no valley low.

[26:44] Ain't no river wide enough, baby.

[26:48] If you need me, call me.

[26:50] No matter where you are, no matter how far.

[26:54] No worry, baby.

[26:55] Just call my name.

[26:57] I'll live there in a hurry.

[26:59] You don't have to worry.

[27:01] Oh, baby, there ain't no mountain high enough.

[27:06] Ain't no valley low enough.

[27:09] Ain't no river wide enough.

[27:14] All right, well that rounds out.

[27:17] The awesome mix volume one from the film.

[27:20] And those three songs were Escape the Pena Calada song

[27:24] by Robert Holmes.

[27:25] That is not a pop song, really.

[27:29] It's not a song I hope makes it into the Pimball machine.

[27:33] I don't think it'd be good for Pimball.

[27:36] Ooh, child, performed by the five stair steps.

[27:40] I wish this was the song that made it in.

[27:44] I think this song at the end when Star Lord is dancing,

[27:47] it's such a great final sort of scene in the movie.

[27:52] It's a great final song to have in a wizard mode.

[27:55] I just think it'd just be so awesome to have that in a Pimball machine.

[27:59] And then Ain't no mountain high enough is also another really, really high energy sort of fun song.

[28:05] That's Marvin Gaye.

[28:08] Great song.

[28:09] I don't know how much it costs to license these songs.

[28:12] I can't imagine it would be super, super expensive to get some of these tracks.

[28:18] Now, the fact that Star Lord is only going to get to, again, my money is on,

[28:22] hook down a feeling and cherry bomb.

[28:25] If I had to pick a third, I think they're going to do come and get your love.

[28:30] I wish there were more.

[28:32] I really do.

[28:33] It's right.

[28:34] I think if you listen to these songs and the way I just played them all,

[28:38] it really is a bummer we're only going to get to.

[28:41] I hope we get more.

[28:42] The good news is this.

[28:44] In this Pimball community, someone will make a mod in which you can add the other songs to the game.

[28:50] It's not the same as it is coming from the factory.

[28:53] It's like modifying a car, giving it a new paint job.

[28:56] It's never quite the same as a factory job.

[28:59] Also, music needs to be incorporated into the code.

[29:03] None of this stuff that's ever layered on top of the game and the game's code truly sounds right.

[29:10] Let's see what we get.

[29:13] Let's see what we get.

[29:14] Is that going to happen at IAPA on the 14th?

[29:17] Will it happen with the Jack Danger flip stream on the 20th?

[29:21] Sometimes people don't let people film their booths at IAPA.

[29:25] So who knows.

[29:26] I think we'll get a good sense of how the game plays then.

[29:30] Stern might not even put the songs in that build of the machine.

[29:34] So we might not get what the songs are.

[29:37] So that's my sort of wish list for Guardians of the Galaxy music.

[29:43] I think it's going to be a great machine.

[29:47] I think Stern has an opportunity here to take the great work of John Borg and the great work of Christopher Franchi.

[29:54] And we'll see what the code is.

[29:57] But I do believe that music makes this game.

[30:00] Music makes this movie special.

[30:03] Music is the key.

[30:05] It is the key.

[30:06] It is the linchpin to making...

[30:10] I put it like this.

[30:12] It's the difference between Guardians of the Galaxy being a good game and Guardians of the Galaxy being a great game.

[30:19] That's how important the music is to this title and this franchise.

[30:23] Alright.

[30:24] Send me your emails at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[30:28] Let me know what songs you would love to have in other than all of them.

[30:32] And let's see what people would love to have in that Pimbal machine.

[30:36] Alright.

[30:37] And for love of God people, can you just be patient?

[30:40] People should not be in the Guardians of the Galaxy threat anymore, bickering and complaining.

[30:45] I think we said everything we needed to say about the machine and for the people who find themselves there tomorrow.

[30:52] Like literally anyone who posts in the Guardians of the Galaxy threat tomorrow should be ashamed of yourself.

[30:59] Because A there's no news and stop complaining and whining about something you haven't flipped yet.

[31:06] Give the game a chance to come out.

[31:08] But here's the deal.

[31:09] Within a month or two, the game will come out.

[31:12] If you want to bitch and moan and cry on Pinside, by all means go into the threads where people should be bitching and moaning.

[31:19] Go into the home pin thread and bitch and moan that he's not giving anyone refunds anymore on thunderbirds.

[31:26] Go into the Dutch Pimbal thread and bitch and moan that people have waited three almost four years now to get their machines.

[31:32] Go into the alien Pimbal thread and bitch and moan that people are still waiting on refunds and the games have issues.

[31:39] There's so much to legitimately complain about and I know I get down on sternate times but for the most part.

[31:46] For the most part we've got to give credit where credit is due and this machine looks good.

[31:54] This machine looks good.

[31:55] I think this machine is everything I wish Star Wars was.

[32:00] I really do.

[32:01] When I look at this machine I get that sort of I can't wait to play it.

[32:05] I can't wait to flip the machine.

[32:08] What else is going on?

[32:09] Not too much is going on in the Pimbal world.

[32:12] Some observations I wanted to talk about.

[32:14] One was there was a question of whether or not Lord of the Rings would be a vault addition.

[32:21] The reason why someone is speculating on this and I noticed this on eBay.

[32:26] A lot of Lord of the Rings machines have come up for sale recently.

[32:31] Both on Pinside and on eBay.

[32:33] This isn't a title that you usually see people let go of very often.

[32:39] There weren't a decent amount of these made back in the day.

[32:43] I don't think this is indication that a vault addition of Lord of the Rings is eminent.

[32:49] A few reasons why.

[32:51] One, I think getting the license again would be expensive for stern and two.

[32:58] I think they sold a boatload of Lord of the Rings machines back in the day.

[33:02] There really isn't that much of a demand for it.

[33:06] I know that people will always say if they remake Lord of the Rings with better art package on the cabinets and improve a few things, I'm a buyer.

[33:16] I would also say look it's probably Stern's best machine ever.

[33:21] Some people might disagree.

[33:25] I still think Lord of the Rings is the greatest theme integration, Pimbal machine.

[33:30] It probably has one of Stern's greatest codes.

[33:34] It has everything you want in the machine.

[33:36] It has wow shots.

[33:37] It has fun toys.

[33:38] It has great music.

[33:40] It has everything about it.

[33:42] Probably the best call outs in terms of a Stern Pimbal machine.

[33:46] It's just so good.

[33:47] The downside of the machine is extremely long ball times.

[33:53] Some of the shots are clunky.

[33:55] The artwork is not the best.

[33:57] The sound is hit or miss here and there.

[34:01] But I wish Stern would take this game and put it into the 21st century and make it.

[34:06] I'm just modernized.

[34:08] Even with the same shots, maybe do what they did with Spider-Man where you improve all the sculptures in the game and maybe fix some of the mechs that were a little wonky.

[34:17] But I don't think it's coming.

[34:19] I don't think it's coming.

[34:20] The reason why I think we're seeing a lot of these machines come up for sale is quite simply

[34:25] Guardians of the Galaxy, Pirates of the Caribbean, Houdini, Diled-in.

[34:31] People need to make room for new machines.

[34:36] And people need to free up money to buy these new machines.

[34:40] And I hate to say it, but a lot of titles that aren't that great are really going to sit on the 4th sale block for a very long time.

[34:50] Lord of the Rings is a great machine.

[34:52] It's a machine that if priced right will sell pretty quickly to free up that money that people need to get the new machines.

[35:00] And people also need space.

[35:02] People have played Lord of the Rings now.

[35:05] For what?

[35:06] Like, didn't it come out like in 2004?

[35:09] Am I right or wrong?

[35:11] And like over a decade now people have been enjoying that pinball machine.

[35:15] And people are ready to move on to some of the newer stuff.

[35:18] So I think that's why we're seeing a lot of Lord of the Rings machines pop up for sale.

[35:23] Another thread I saw which was interesting was talking about the Hobbit.

[35:28] And how Hobbit reselled prices are not that strong.

[35:32] I think there's a smog special edition that is actually for sale on Pinside for $6,500.

[35:39] And that's pretty cheap right?

[35:42] That game was closer to $8,500 when it came out.

[35:45] And so, you know, Hobbit will always go down as a miss in my book.

[35:52] And the reason why I think it's a miss, and we've talked about this machine a lot, I'm not going to be a dead horse,

[35:57] but I think Hobbit machines are going to continue to lose value.

[36:00] And the reason why is the movies were not that good.

[36:03] The layout was pretty uninspired.

[36:06] The game does play floaty.

[36:08] It's a beautiful looking machine.

[36:10] It suffers from far too many multi-balls.

[36:13] You can get multi-ball over and over and over again, which leads to really long ball times.

[36:18] It also suffers from what the hell am I supposed to be doing?

[36:21] It is one of those games where you need an instruction manual to really understand how to progress through the game.

[36:28] Not nearly as easy to get through that game as you can get through Lord of the Rings.

[36:33] Ironically coded by Keith the same person.

[36:36] But sometimes too much spoils.

[36:40] Spoils the fun of a pinball machine.

[36:42] I think that's what's exciting about Houdini and how Josh is going to code that machine.

[36:48] I don't think it's going to be a complex mess.

[36:50] Star Wars, for example, another game.

[36:52] A complex coded nightmare.

[36:54] With all the multipliers and all the stuff going on, all the stacking.

[36:58] That doesn't make me feel like I'm progressing through the Star Wars narrative at all.

[37:03] I think we're going to see Star Wars prices plummet going into 2018.

[37:09] I do.

[37:10] Star Wars is not going to be a game that people have to own.

[37:13] It's really not.

[37:14] I believe it's a fun machine.

[37:16] I believe it's a fun machine that should probably have sold for $2,000 less than it currently is selling for.

[37:23] Because all the money went to the license.

[37:25] The money did not go into making that game special.

[37:28] It just didn't.

[37:29] All right.

[37:30] Beasleboob.

[37:31] Nobody believes you, bro.

[37:32] Nobody.

[37:33] We get it.

[37:34] It's fun.

[37:35] You're Ellie's going to sell for $2,000, $3,000 less than you paid for it.

[37:40] There's an interesting topic of what's better, kiss or ghost busters.

[37:45] I think people were back and forth.

[37:47] I think more people were saying kiss is actually a better machine.

[37:50] It was kiss Ellie or ghost busters, Ellie.

[37:52] And people prefer kiss for the most part.

[37:55] And I have to say, I think theme wise, ghost busters blows kiss away.

[38:00] I think art wise, ghost busters is still the nicer art package.

[38:05] Ghost busters should have been.

[38:07] And I'm going to say this.

[38:08] I mean this.

[38:09] It should have been the greatest Stern Pimball machine in the last 10 years.

[38:15] It had everything going for it.

[38:17] Everything going for it.

[38:19] It even had fun mechanisms.

[38:22] It looked like that world under glass.

[38:24] Look at the sculptures that are above the pop bumpers and ghost busters.

[38:29] And look at what they've done since.

[38:31] They really put a lot into the game.

[38:33] The thing that will always make ghost busters go down as a humongous miss is simply the fact that it's frustrating as hell.

[38:41] It's a drain monster.

[38:43] And because of that, it's not fun.

[38:45] It's like you feel like you're having fun.

[38:48] But then you realize I'm not really having fun.

[38:51] I'm surviving this game.

[38:53] I'm not enjoying it.

[38:55] You're hanging on for your dear life.

[38:57] The flipper gap and the drains on the out lanes.

[39:00] And just the overall bad geometry of the game destroyed it.

[39:05] If I were Stern, I would now that Trudeau is like gone.

[39:10] Even though he's he pleaded not guilty.

[39:12] Did you guys hear that?

[39:13] John Trudeau pleaded not guilty to the charges.

[39:15] Yes, somebody else put those images on his computer.

[39:18] They should redo ghost busters geometry for like, they could never do it.

[39:23] Because they'd have to like replace everyone's machines.

[39:26] And KPG would like show up at Stern with like a Tommy gun and light up the place.

[39:31] But you know, that will always be the Achilles heel of ghost busters.

[39:36] Is how frustrating it is.

[39:39] So I just want to sort of end this podcast.

[39:42] This podcast number 175 by saying to everybody out there.

[39:46] Just do yourselves a favor.

[39:50] It's November.

[39:51] We're heading into Thanksgiving.

[39:53] Things to be thankful for.

[39:55] We're heading into the holidays.

[39:57] We should be thankful that there are still new inbox pinball machines coming out.

[40:02] We should be thankful that Houdini's coming out.

[40:05] And Guardians of the Galaxy will come out.

[40:08] Before Christmas, if you want one, there's a good chance you can have one.

[40:12] You can go get dialed in with that's got all this great code and it's a pat lawler's back.

[40:18] With a full feature JJP game that you can go buy.

[40:22] It's a good time.

[40:24] There's a lot more to be thankful for.

[40:26] And you guys know who you are.

[40:28] The ones who keep the negativity going on the forums.

[40:33] You gotta chill out.

[40:34] You gotta give stuff a chance to show its true colors.

[40:38] And I think you'll be happier because of that.

[40:41] I know I get caught up in the bullshit.

[40:43] You stare at this stuff too long and you stop playing pinball and you start speculating and talking about it more than you actually play it.

[40:53] Life is short.

[40:56] Life is really short.

[40:58] And for those of you who have pinball collections, you are blessed people.

[41:03] In the larger scheme of the world, you have succeeded more than 98% of the planet.

[41:11] You have more than they ever will have.

[41:13] Like tied up in pinball machines.

[41:16] Just think about that.

[41:17] So next time you want to go on pinside and the sky is falling.

[41:21] Remember that.

[41:22] I'll do my best to remember it.

[41:24] 175.

[41:25] I hope you enjoyed this.

[41:26] I can't wait to see Guardians come out.

[41:29] I can't wait to get my Guardians of the Galaxy.

[41:32] It's a theme I love.

[41:33] I think the game is going to be awesome.

[41:35] I really do.

[41:36] I'm fully confident in this machine.

[41:39] If you're not confident and you're uncertain, just wait.

[41:44] Just wait.

[41:45] I have different reasons for going in early on it.

[41:48] I'll explain those to you after I get the machine.

[41:50] But I want to let you guys know.

[41:52] I'm very thankful that you listen to this podcast.

[41:55] I hope you enjoyed on a weekly basis.

[41:58] And for the love of God, Nate shivers, come back.

[42:01] Give us more than one podcast a month.

[42:04] All right.

[42:05] You can't say you're coming back.

[42:07] And then not come back.

[42:09] Just put the mic on.

[42:10] Just sing to me, Nate.

[42:11] Sing me a lullaby.

[42:13] I love that show.

[42:14] I want more of it.

[42:16] I love head to head pinball.

[42:17] I love the flipping podcast.

[42:19] I love the pinball podcast.

[42:21] I love the full tilt.

[42:22] I'm just going to make up podcast now.

[42:24] I love the middle.

[42:25] I love.

[42:26] It's all good.

[42:27] We're all just talking about something that most of the world doesn't care about.

[42:29] This is Kaniyata.

[42:30] Sign it out.

[42:31] Just you.

[42:34] And I.

[42:39] Just you.

[43:32] Just you.

[43:37] Just you.
