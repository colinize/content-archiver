[00:00] Chicago Chicago that tunnel in town Chicago Chicago I will show you around

[00:17] We are back in New York City after spending two days in Chicago at pinball expo 2016 and this is episode

[00:26] 63 of Canada's pinball podcast and we are going to call this podcast a tale of two expos because

[00:33] There was one expo that was defined by all of our

[00:38] Expectations going into the show and then there was the actual expo as it was and what I want to do on this

[00:44] Podcast is give my opinions of the show what I thought what I heard

[00:50] Did it live up to the expectations that I had that I think you guys

[00:55] Had and did any of the predictions that we made prior to the show actually come true

[01:01] So the way I want to structure it because so much goes on at expo that I don't want to just go off on a million tangents and

[01:09] Rans I actually took notes for this episode and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go down

[01:14] What I believe to be a list of the least impactful things that happen at the show to the most impactful and I'm gonna do this sort of

[01:22] having company order so

[01:24] We're gonna start with the companies that I think had the least impact and we're gonna end up with the company that I think had the biggest impact and made the biggest impression at this year's expo

[01:36] And we're gonna do it that way and then I'm just gonna give you guys some overall opinions of the show that I had and

[01:42] Some thoughts and some observations that I want to give you guys in terms of what I think people should do over the next six months to a year as we approach this hobby

[01:52] First I really just want to say thank you to all of the the fans of Canators Pimball podcast that I got to meet at this show because

[02:00] These shows are all about people. All right anyone who goes to a pinball show will tell you this you can play these games on location

[02:08] You can play these games in people's homes. You can hear about the news on the internet

[02:12] They're the only reason to really go and what makes these shows so enjoyable are the people so I want to say thank you to all the

[02:21] The fans of the show that came up to me. I want to say a special thank you to

[02:27] Ed Vandervine for catching me in the elevator as I was just going down to check out some games and Ed said hey, man

[02:33] Do you want to come have a cigar with us and spending a few hours with Ed and Dennis Norman and and and and Brett and and and and he calls it

[02:43] Ed's big big smoke over at Spears. It was awesome

[02:46] It was probably one of the highlights of of my my expo this year

[02:50] Also want to give a great shout out to listener

[02:53] Robert in New Jersey

[02:55] Brendan and I had a really amazing dinner with Robert and his great wife Heather last night and Robert is in on a Batman

[03:03] Super Ellie and it was really great to hear his opinions about the machine and

[03:09] And how he's so excited to get that Batman super early and we're gonna talk more about that

[03:14] But I also want to thank everyone else out there that I ran into who said hey, man. I'm a fan of the show

[03:20] I really really really appreciate it when people come up and and say that and it was actually great to have people say that in front of Brenda because

[03:27] She's always a little bit skeptical about why I do this and say Brenda

[03:30] You know it really does

[03:32] entertain and give people enjoyment out there so

[03:35] What I also want to ask all of you out there who listen to this before we dive into the different companies and the show

[03:41] Is I want you guys to email me what your thoughts were of expo because I'm the next episode. I want to

[03:47] Read out loud what you guys thought of the show because I don't want this just to be my opinion

[03:53] I also want to share what you guys felt came out of expo 2016 and again

[03:58] The email address is canada that's K.A.N. EDA

[04:03] Pimball at gmail.com. Let me know what you thought. Let me know what you think of my review of expo

[04:09] Let me know what you thought as you saw stuff

[04:12] It doesn't matter if you went to the show. I want to hear from people and what you thought of

[04:17] Pimball expo 2016 so I got to say just overall I was

[04:22] Pretty much let down by expo 2016. I went in with really high expectations of what I was gonna see

[04:30] What I was gonna play and what would come from these companies knowing that this was sort of the the industry show

[04:38] Right the moment for all of these companies to take the stage and tell us what they have going on

[04:45] And why we should be excited and ultimately why we should hand them over a large amounts of money to buy these toys

[04:52] So I was let down and I think I'm gonna go over why I was sort of let down as I go through my list here of

[04:59] Companies and how they fair to Pimball expo so at the bottom of my list of

[05:05] Companies at expo and the impact they made at the very bottom is Chicago gaming company now

[05:11] We expected these guys to come to expo and announce title number two which has been rumored to be attacked from Mars

[05:19] Chicago gaming

[05:21] Company gets a zero in my book because they just canceled they just canceled their seminar

[05:27] they decided not to show up and

[05:30] I think that was unfortunate. I think that was disappointing. I think this was one of the games that

[05:36] People were just looking forward to finally getting the confirmation of what this game would be

[05:41] I think it's also disappointing for these guys too because we're at the stage now

[05:45] Where there's a lot of people revealing stuff and asking for people to hold on to their money because you should apply your money here and

[05:52] With them saying nothing I think it was a big miss opportunity for Chicago gaming company and if it's gonna be attacked from Mars

[06:00] Or monster bash or a cactus canyon or whatever it's gonna be

[06:03] I think these guys need to get their act together and and I think it was a missed opportunity for them to reveal what it was gonna be at the show

[06:12] Okay, so a little bit above Chicago gaming company is Dutch Pimball now Dutch Pimball over the last two years has really gone from being

[06:23] You know a hero a company that people were super excited about

[06:28] Fast forward two years to expo 2016 and they literally just had two games there

[06:35] They had a bright-up Pimball and they had the big Lebowski which obviously those are their two titles

[06:40] But was really interesting is the amount of or shall I say just the lack of attention

[06:47] There was around those two titles there. There was never a line to play any of the games or was never much

[06:53] Action around those titles. It goes to show

[06:56] You get a chance to really

[06:59] Build hype get people excited and and be into your product and I think what's happened is people have just moved away

[07:06] I mean I talked to a lot of people nobody brought up playing the big Lebowski being excited about it

[07:11] It still seems to be a game that is not really shipping quickly

[07:16] Hardly anyone has it. It still seems to be a game where the code is not really there and you know

[07:21] We didn't really hear from Dutch

[07:22] Now I I don't know if they did but I'm pretty sure they didn't do a seminar so they didn't really talk about

[07:30] Anything in terms of getting games out the door faster

[07:34] They didn't talk about what is there gonna be a game number two is the big Lebowski?

[07:39] Is there another game coming that they're working on that they're really excited about?

[07:42] And I don't know. I don't know what's going on over it Dutch. I

[07:47] Have made many many sort of

[07:51] Assumptions and predictions that I don't think all these companies are gonna survive and by the looks of things and by the looks of the show

[07:59] I don't think Dutch is gonna survive if they don't really get more games out

[08:03] And if they don't get a second title out that has a little bit more mainstream appeal so really disappointing

[08:10] Dutch pinball

[08:12] Presence at pinball expo

[08:14] All right up from Dutch and

[08:18] You know the next two I think are sort of similar and this is this is no like slam on the company but

[08:24] Spooky didn't really have much of a presence at the show and went in in our

[08:28] Prediction of what we were gonna expect at expo

[08:31] We were pretty confident that spooky was gonna bring the Jetsons that we were gonna hear more about that and how that title came to be

[08:40] But that didn't happen and spooky went to

[08:45] They were they had a seminar there and they showed us a video of a tour of the factory Ben Heck was up on stage

[08:52] with Bug and Charlie and Charlie's wife and I have to say this I still I still love these people. I really do

[09:00] There was just like a moment that was really a telltale sign of this company

[09:06] I was just sitting down with Brenda in the hallway and Charlie's wife walked by and just said you're not wearing your sweatshirt

[09:13] And I was like just a little like taking back like what she said your spooky sweatshirt

[09:19] And she remembered that I bought a spooky sweatshirt at

[09:23] Texas pinball festival and and wore it and I was just like wow like I think that just like is such an

[09:30] In assisted indication of this company and how how genuine they are and they they're

[09:36] They're they're attention to people and they're like a family and they like I don't know

[09:40] I was really really impressed that

[09:43] That she just remembered that and and so it was exciting to see the factory and and it looks like a really cool

[09:49] Awesome place to work and these guys have really established themselves as the really only boutique that is consistently shipping games

[09:58] spooky bought a dominoes pinball machine to expo 2016 and

[10:02] You know, I have to say like I played it. It's simple. It's it's only what 5300 bucks

[10:08] It just feels like a game that is for dominoes franchisey zoners. I can't really see why collectors or pinball fans would want this in their home

[10:17] If I was a franchisey zoner, I would love it

[10:20] You know, but again, I think we're really waiting to see what comes after Rob Zombie that is in original

[10:27] spooky game and not just a commission title so not much on the spooky front that we learned from the show

[10:33] All right, so next on the list is p3 multi morpheck

[10:38] Jerry was there had I think three multi morpheck set up running titles and

[10:44] You know, look Jerry came right up to me and he said look canada

[10:48] I got to tell you man

[10:49] I disagree with what you said about Lexi light speed and just to recap listeners. I was

[10:55] Pretty critical on one of my podcasts when I said that I didn't think Lexi light speed could compete with the other

[11:02] Titles that are coming out simply because it's going up against juggernaut licenses like aliens like

[11:09] Batman like you know ghost busters and was gonna be aros myth

[11:14] It's gonna be a pat law their game and he said look you got it all wrong

[11:17] It's I'm not selling Lesky light speed. I'm selling a platform

[11:20] It's all about the platform and what multi morpheck does and and I get it

[11:25] I totally get it

[11:26] I know what Jerry is going for and I really want Jerry to get the game out and then that was like the second part of our conversation was like Jerry

[11:32] You know you got to get these games in the homes and and only then

[11:36] Will the software and the other games follow that?

[11:40] You know that can make this a sustainable thing, you know, it's you can't just if you're gonna

[11:47] It's basically like he's saying I'm making a video game council. I'm not making video games

[11:53] And when I get the council into people's homes

[11:56] Titles will come and it's a little bit of both though, right?

[11:59] I don't I don't necessarily agree with that. I think Nintendo councils move because there's Mario brothers on it

[12:06] Right no one would have bought NES if super Mario brothers wasn't such a good title

[12:10] So there has to be a p3 multi-morphic title that makes people want to go in other than just

[12:17] Buying the platform. I still believe that the simple games for kids are really

[12:23] amazing for

[12:25] Home collectors who don't have games at their young children can play so I think that is an untapped part of the market

[12:32] A lot of the collectors out there are at the age where they have kids that are that are young that aren't

[12:38] Trying to figure out how to advance through modes of ACDC, right?

[12:42] They they kind of want to have a simple pin

[12:45] So it's look the balls in Jerry's court

[12:48] I think everyone is just has demoed this game

[12:52] Year after year after year and Jerry's saying that multi-morphics are gonna get into people's homes in

[12:58] February now. Let me just reiterate not everyone. I think he was saying 15 test units are gonna go out in February

[13:05] So I hope I hope that happens

[13:07] I look forward to seeing what the response is and that's that is step one

[13:11] He needs to get these games out. I think that that has to happen in 2017. We can't go another year

[13:18] With this thing making the you know the the nation-wide toward to all the different shows

[13:24] People have to be able to get them now. So we hope that Jerry can get those games out to people all right

[13:29] now we're gonna get into sort of like the the main

[13:34] Parts of the show the things I think people really really talked about and

[13:37] After multi-morphic this is like number four out of the companies that had people talking and that's American Pimball and

[13:46] This was the reason why I flew in early early early on Friday because I wanted to make sure I got there

[13:54] To hear these guys talk at at nine o'clock about

[13:59] American Pimball now this has been a company that has just been shrouded in mystery

[14:03] We know a little bit the parts that we do know

[14:07] Make people anxious they make people angry they make people frustrated

[14:12] But they do make some people optimistic they do make some people excited

[14:18] But I think all of us all of us are really just scratching our head

[14:22] So I wanted to be in the audience as these guys spoke and

[14:27] There were four people that got up there the main three that did all the talking were

[14:32] Scott Goldberg

[14:34] Joe Balser

[14:35] And and deval but it was really Scott who led the charge and Joe as well explaining what American Pimball

[14:42] What they were what their approach was and I have to say this

[14:46] It is almost comical when you read Pinside

[14:50] Alongside Expo and when you're in the room and things are happening in real time in real life with real people

[14:58] What's going on there as opposed to what Pinside is saying is going on there and and the way

[15:05] Pinside was reacting to this thing so Pinside said these guys had a total flop at Expo

[15:11] They totally dropped the ball they totally failed. I couldn't disagree more

[15:17] I think that these guys went into this show and they were just trying to do one thing

[15:22] And that was manage expectations and I think they did a really good job of addressing everything head on

[15:30] About what they were going to do

[15:32] Why they were doing it why they were working with Jay pop why Jay pop wasn't there why they hired Joe

[15:40] But before all of this I do have to say that American Pimball made some promises that they did not keep

[15:47] They said that they were going to bring Chris from coin takers magic girl for him to take home at the show

[15:54] Okay, and we said on an earlier podcast that we were going to give this company the benefit of the doubt

[15:59] And they were in a position where their actions need to speak far louder than their words and they clearly

[16:07] Clearly failed to do what they said they were going to do and and for most people right

[16:13] This is what we've seen happen before the promise of magic girl, but no one's ever flipped it

[16:19] So what did they do they invited Chris from coin taker over to see

[16:24] The facility where they're making these games and Chris gave a glowing review of how amazing it is and how beautiful it is and how this and how that

[16:35] Did he play it? No, did he see a final game? No, did he flip anything? No, and this is like people are like

[16:42] I can't fucking believe it

[16:44] We are back all over again. It's groundhog day

[16:49] Jay pop invites someone over to see a beautiful work in progress, but nothing is done

[16:54] This is it for most people this is where we've been for the last

[16:58] Four years on this title and the fact that this guy was supposed to bring the game home

[17:05] And we're still at the same place with it

[17:08] It's really frustrating and I think this was a big mess on their part

[17:14] Why would they go on to Facebook and say your game's gonna be done?

[17:18] Your game's gonna go home with you and then it's like whoa wait a minute

[17:22] I'm gonna at the end of my American pinball talk here

[17:25] I'm gonna explain what I think is going on and why I'm also concerned, but that didn't happen

[17:30] Also, who did he didn't even show up the game itself did not show up the way we saw it at Vegas

[17:36] And a lot of people are just like saying well, why would they go to Vegas with it

[17:41] And not bring it to

[17:43] Now we got the explanation and this is the really the heart of what they were trying to explain

[17:49] During their presentation was their relationship with John right and they basically said there are questions

[17:56] We're gonna answer as American pinball and there are gonna be questions that are just those are zidware questions and we are not zidware

[18:04] It's really confusing guys. I am very confused

[18:09] By you know by the stance of this company because

[18:13] Zidware is like just really John

[18:16] So if you're working with John in a large capacity and to say you're not

[18:21] Zidware, but you're you're you're working with John as a consultant

[18:26] It's all a little fuzzy

[18:29] It seems convenient when they can say that's a zidware question. I was telling Brenda whenever they would say that to a question

[18:35] It's like I'm we're pleading the fifth. We're not gonna say it. That's a zidware question

[18:40] That's a question for John

[18:41] But here's what we do know and here's what they did say

[18:44] They are hiring John as a consultant John worked on Houdini John is not finishing Houdini Joe Balser is now when you ask me

[18:54] That's an interesting

[18:56] Thing to have happen and what they kept saying is John is really good at some things John is not good at other things

[19:03] John is good at getting

[19:05] 75% of a game done. He's really bad at finishing a game and

[19:11] It's all it's it's I mean we hear this we hear this we hear this

[19:15] Um, and I don't even know what that means right what does that really mean?

[19:18] So we all know that the normal way to design a pinball game is you design a white wood

[19:25] You make sure everything on the whitewood is flipping perfectly all the shots all the geometry is there

[19:30] That's the hard part getting all that right and then you do the artwork

[19:36] But once again we see who Dini covered in beautiful art

[19:40] And then Joe gets up there and says you know, we might have to work on

[19:44] Changing some of the shots and making sure some of the mechanisms are actually like feasible and you know

[19:49] Bringing this game to the finish line is gonna require it to come back to reality

[19:54] And it's like well great John sort of maybe did it all over again where he didn't

[19:59] Doesn't have a flipping white wood of who Dini that fully works before he got to the fun stuff

[20:04] I mean John always wants to jump to the fun stuff, which is the art

[20:08] But you know, I think

[20:10] It's it's just so frustrating that this could be basically the fourth

[20:15] Game again that is just

[20:17] Designed with a beautiful art package, but it's not done and doesn't shoot and it's never been shot

[20:23] And who knows if it even works?

[20:25] Did he do it again? Has he duped these guys again?

[20:28] Is who Dini just the fourth attempt that John to convince people that he has games that are ready to go

[20:34] And I don't know and I really don't know I mean it just feels weird

[20:40] And when it comes to magic girl owners they are still saying that

[20:45] That they're gonna make I think they said somewhere between 19 and 20 magic girls are gonna go out by the end of the year

[20:50] And they keep standing behind that statement

[20:53] Even though the game is not done in mid-October and I just don't get the sense that it I don't know

[20:59] I just don't feel good. I would have felt great if chrystrum coin taker

[21:04] God is machine and took it home, but that didn't happen all right

[21:08] So if you were in on razz or owls in wonderland based upon what these guys said

[21:12] I think you have to be really nervous because

[21:15] It sounds like the steps for these guys are to get the magic girls out

[21:19] They they need to do that before anything happens with who Dini they then said they're looking at who Dini to be a mid

[21:26] 2017

[21:28] Title so nine months from now. They're hoping to have who who Dini available for order

[21:34] Okay

[21:35] They are not going to address Alice in wonderland or raza owners

[21:39] until after

[21:41] That who Dini moment and even then they're not gonna say anything or put any promises out there

[21:48] If you were to ask me I don't think those games are gonna get made

[21:51] I do think you're gonna get

[21:53] Whether it's a refund or an offer of credit towards who Dini and a future title

[21:59] for restitution on those games and

[22:01] I really think that's gonna be the case

[22:04] You know and what was really interesting is when Joe talked because Joe said something that they're at a crossroads

[22:10] Right there at a fork in the road he said and the fork he sort of put up his hands

[22:15] And then the fork wasn't that divided and he said like on one side is j pop on one side is american pinball

[22:21] now that he's on board

[22:23] He is going to

[22:25] Sort of take over the reins to make sure these games get built and I was happy to see Joe up there because he has a very

[22:32] Non-sense get shit done kind of attitude

[22:35] Which is perfect when you're dealing with a guy like john

[22:39] But it did I did get the sense that Joe is gonna be the guy moving forward

[22:44] Who helps this company from a design standpoint get games out the door

[22:48] So they've already said we're not putting when we saw who Dini the reason we didn't see who Dini at Expo is it was inside the zidware cabinet at

[22:57] At Vegas and they said we're not gonna be using

[23:01] The zidware cabinets moving forward. That's a zidware thing the the monitors that are down like on the playfield the way John had it in magic

[23:08] Girl and that's how we saw who Dini's monitor that's not gonna be the way the game looks when it comes out

[23:14] They have a whole new american pinball cabinet design we saw that in the in the private room they had set up

[23:20] We saw what it looked like it didn't look like a zidware cabinet the the display is gonna be up in the back box

[23:27] So they're really moving away from zidware IP and there's a lot of speculation about they're doing that because of legal reasons

[23:35] And I'm not gonna get into all of that stuff

[23:38] You know, I don't want to go on and on on about american pinball because I want to get to the other three companies that are real companies and making games

[23:44] Right now, but I'll say this I went up to them in the private room and look they're nice guys

[23:50] They're nice guys and I was talking to Scott and I basically said to him look I get that you guys have this plan in place to

[23:57] To divide yourselves from from zidware and to make american pinball its own entity

[24:03] But this entire company's credibility

[24:06] Rest on getting magic girl out the door because they're making a promise from american pinball that that is when they will have those games made

[24:14] And I really just I looked them in the eye and it said look

[24:17] Are you sure that john is gonna finish this game because he's very good at convincing people it's almost done

[24:23] And he just needs a little bit more time and he misleads people

[24:28] He lies to people about the game being almost done all the time

[24:32] And so they said yes

[24:35] And they said that they had

[24:36] 12 examples of it. They were pretty much done

[24:40] But they have a pro a legal issue that's holding things up right now and when I heard that I just wanted to just like

[24:47] Fall backwards fall on the ground and just pretend to be dead and have Brenda push me out of the room because I just you know

[24:53] Here we go again

[24:55] It never goes smoothly and there's always some hurdle or some excuse about why things haven't developed

[25:02] People say they're gonna develop and if there's legal issues with the zidware ip and that they don't have the they don't have the legal rights to even show clips or video of magic girl

[25:12] Or even get them out the door and this whole thing is gonna end up in lawsuits

[25:16] Uh, then I just think it sucks. I think it sucks. I think it sucks that the wounds will be reopened

[25:23] But we're gonna have to just see what happens between now and the end of the year

[25:26] But I'll say this if magic girls don't go out before the end of the year

[25:31] These guys are are really going to be

[25:34] laughed at and never taken seriously

[25:37] So they need to stand behind their word and get those games out and whatever it takes they need to do it all right

[25:42] We're um, we're gonna go into the top three

[25:45] These are the companies that I think finished in the top three of expo and you can probably guess who they are

[25:52] but the order might surprise you a little bit and

[25:55] The number three most impactful and successful company at expo

[26:02] 2016 is

[26:06] Stern pinball and I really thought you know this expo was was Stern's moment to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the company

[26:16] To really swing a big stick and show the other guys how it's done and I can't tell you

[26:23] How utterly disappointed I was that Batman 66 wasn't playable

[26:30] How utterly disappointed I was and how they revealed it at expo

[26:35] But ultimately overall I was just utterly disappointed in how much Stern was trying to do at the show

[26:46] And how unsuccessful they were to do any of those one things

[26:52] Empowerfully, impactfully and professionally in a way and and I got to say

[26:59] I'm really really really want it Stern to have a better showing at expo

[27:04] And and let's just talk about Batman not being playable so

[27:09] It when I booked my flight and Stern was having their their epic party

[27:14] You know, I really thought they were gonna reveal Batman the game at the party and I'm gonna talk about the party in a little bit

[27:21] But they showed the game

[27:24] What was it Thursday morning during the storm Stern tour they actually released the images to the internet before the tour even started so people

[27:33] Who are on the tour were getting text messages and Facebook links and they were able to see it before they could actually even go

[27:39] Physically see it on the tour and look it looked great

[27:42] I think visually this Batman game when I first saw it I was super excited

[27:47] I mean I put up pictures on Facebook. I saw so many people saying wow that looks like Batman 66

[27:52] For those people who are like it's it's too colorful it looks like it's a Skittles machine

[27:56] That is the color scheme for Batman 66 u-fools it is like a else in an LSD trip from from that error

[28:04] It is supposed to be colorful

[28:06] Uh, and I have to say like the pictures looked amazing. We finally got to see the super

[28:11] The super Ellie and we got to see you know, it was it gonna be worth $15,000

[28:18] Ah look

[28:20] I got to see the machines in person and when I walked up to them the first thing I was like well these are cool

[28:26] Like the screen is really neat. I like the way they integrated it

[28:30] Um, and there's the super Ellie which obviously has everyone's attention and I have to say without shout of a doubt

[28:37] Without any hesitation

[28:39] There is no way this machine looks like a $15,000 machine

[28:45] It's almost laughable that they're charging $15,000 for this machine

[28:50] And I have lots of friends at Stern and I love you guys and I love what you do

[28:55] But you have got to be kidding me that with a $15,000 machine you have

[29:02] Matchbox cars in it you have toys in this machine

[29:06] That are differentiating it from the LE that cost $5

[29:13] $10 maybe

[29:14] Nothing is originally sculpted

[29:17] Nothing is made specifically for that machine

[29:20] It was embarrassing to look at the shooter lane and be like those are two matchbox cars

[29:25] Or to look at the the bat signal in the upper right corner and it's like it looks like a $5 toy

[29:31] Or the bat copter that also looks like a $5 toy

[29:34] I mean literally what what it's like it's like Gomez through someone like 20 bucks

[29:38] And was like go down to target and get me some bat toys so we can uh, you know charge another $5 grand for this thing

[29:44] No, look I'm joking

[29:46] George, you know, I love you guys. I really do. I know you're putting passion behind this thing

[29:51] But that is so cheap

[29:54] I'm sorry you don't deserve to get away with that level of

[29:59] Cheapness of store bought toys for something that is gonna be the

[30:04] The birthday present to your company the the most expensive pinball machine ever released

[30:11] Right magic girl never got released. This is the most expensive pinball machine of all time

[30:16] And you're gonna put cheap store bought toys in it

[30:20] And okay, let's go from there like the machine looks really cool like the bat mobile of the decals on it are really awesome

[30:26] It's got this like mirrored shiny sort of like embossed

[30:31] Graphics that just look awesome, and it's got this nice like black sparkly

[30:37] Power-to-coated armor. It's got the red piping on on on on the armor

[30:42] And I know I was saying like well the coin door and the shooter rod areas aren't power-to-coated

[30:47] But I was told those are gonna be power powder coated

[30:50] It's got the speaker panels got some bat signals on it that aren't on the LE

[30:55] But the thing is this we heard in the press release

[30:58] I thought we were gonna get like an exclusive topper for it this same topper is on the LE

[31:04] The but the SLD guys has a as a bat signal that you can that comes out of the topper again like what is that like a

[31:13] $10 $20 flash light thing that anyone in the mod community can easily make it just felt like

[31:20] I gotta be honest it felt like the super LE should be Stern's first $10,000 machine

[31:27] And when I look at the LE it felt like well this LE should be you know

[31:31] Should be the premium and it should be

[31:35] $8,000 and so forth with with the the the premium which is really the pro

[31:42] And and and let's look at the game so when you look down at yes, it's different from Batman the dark night

[31:47] It's not the same layout

[31:49] I but I kept hearing so much from my from my Stern contacts and from people were like

[31:54] Oh the mechanism in the upper left corner is like the coolest mechanism we've ever made and it's gonna be incredible

[32:00] And this game's gonna blow everybody away and you're never gonna believe what you see

[32:04] And then I look over and I see the Mac and it's what it's cool. I mean it's but it's it's rotating

[32:11] Targets with a magnet in front

[32:14] Uh, one is like villain vision one is the bat phone. I think one is the bat copter

[32:19] Uh, it's cool

[32:21] But again, it's not holy cow. Oh my god

[32:25] Greatest mechanism ever made we've been working on this all summer here's the mechanism that we've been fucking crushing ourselves to get

[32:32] I just didn't I wasn't like whoa like that's something I never would expect to see in the game

[32:38] Uh, and I have to say like the crane being there. It's just it's a little bit of a disappointing distraction

[32:42] Why did you build this thing on something that because that's still the main mechanism and it's old

[32:47] We've seen it. It's part of a game that never really caught on and it just it literally it feels like

[32:55] Half of the game is new half of the game is old

[32:57] Uh, and maybe my mind would be changed if I could flip it and see how much better it shoots and how much better it flows

[33:04] And how much more fun it is but I didn't get to and how can you Stern not just

[33:10] To have a version of the game flippable even if it's just one mode

[33:14] Just so people can get a sense of how the the shots flow people would understand that it's early that the code's not there yet

[33:20] I also found it's so ironic that Stern is like we can't let you play it because the code is incomplete

[33:27] All Stern does is ship people games with incomplete code that we have to play

[33:32] Uh, it's suffered through incomplete code for the most part and if there's any time where we would forgive them for incomplete code

[33:39] It's during

[33:40] An expo reveal where we know the game is still not finished yet

[33:44] I just thought it was so annoying that they did that and there's all these rumors like lineman wouldn't let them do it and lineman

[33:51] lineman sheets is up all night to make sure the game was gonna be playable at the Stern party Friday night

[33:56] Like that's the rumor that started Thursday was like Friday night lineman's working around the clock to make sure it's playable

[34:02] That didn't happen didn't happen for Saturday

[34:05] We never got to flip it never got to flip it and I just think it

[34:10] I would be embarrassed if I was Stern and it wasn't flippable and I spoke briefly to Gomez

[34:15] He's like well, we didn't want people to play it we didn't want people to play it because we knew if there was anything wrong

[34:21] Then this would happen then the what George what are you talking about you sold out

[34:26] You sold out of the super ellies you sold out of the ellies at least let people who bought in Ellie or a super Ellie

[34:33] play it you've already

[34:35] Sold them the game and they can't even play it. What are you nervous about there's I just thought that was really like lame that they wouldn't let people play it

[34:45] And get it to a form or anyone who has the positive down actually got the sea at being played heck even let

[34:51] Let Gomez play it let lineman play it and he's gonna show his like here's here's what it looks like being flipped

[34:58] People would have settled even for that

[35:00] um

[35:01] So no I just don't think this looked anywhere near a fifteen thousand dollar machine

[35:06] But I'll say this having spoken to a bunch of people who are in on super ellies. They're excited

[35:11] They think it looks great. They want it. They don't give a shit that it's not like you know for them

[35:17] It's the nostalgia factor for them. It's the exclusivity factor

[35:22] For them this still is the most beautiful stern package that's ever been put out there and it is from a visual standpoint

[35:28] There's no stern that visually pops like this thing

[35:31] It but yeah, you can't see five thousand dollars extra

[35:35] How can you put a price tag on people's nostalgia?

[35:38] How can you put a price tag on people's desire to have a very limited thing right?

[35:42] So it's the intangibles that make the price what it is

[35:46] But I just didn't see it all right

[35:47] So what else about stern is the reason why I have them in third place here

[35:50] So uh stern's epic party and I had been bitching and mowing that if I get to this party and there's no free drinks

[35:56] I swear to god, I'm gonna lose it. There were no free drinks. There was no free food. Um, I have to say

[36:04] You know, I I could go off and off and off about like I think they're and tried so hard to do so much at this show

[36:09] And they would have been better off just doing a few things really awesome and they would have been better served

[36:13] I you know, I did the Adam West meeting greet and that was fine. That was fine. I mean, I think that was handled very nicely

[36:20] But the party itself was a little weird and and this is the over

[36:23] the

[36:25] The over our jean sort of sentiment I got from people was

[36:29] We are at pinball expo

[36:32] We are at pinball expo

[36:33] We have people coming from all over the world from all different states spending all different amounts of money to be here

[36:40] To celebrate pinball at pinball expo the biggest party

[36:45] That always went on was the pinball life party all right

[36:48] So that was the standard of the big party at expo is everyone would go to pinball life

[36:52] They'd get free beer free booze free pizza free cake and have all these games on free play

[36:59] And people loved it. It was a tradition at expo

[37:02] Stern comes in says it's our 30th anniversary

[37:05] We're gonna do a big birthday bash for Stern and you get there and there's no pinball machines

[37:12] I mean, I I don't understand there was two pinball machines at Stern's 30th birthday party and here here's the thing

[37:21] I could go off about

[37:23] People swallowing balloons and cutortionists and this it was like there is just things going on everywhere

[37:29] It was like it was like walking into some sort of like

[37:33] Scary house a horrors where there's like all these weird activities going on none of it seemed to

[37:38] To connect in any real way

[37:41] Other than the Batman theme that was running throughout other than Stern trying to tease us by playing iron maiden on the you know

[37:47] All the time and air ismith music all the time

[37:50] But people paid $30 of their money to get to this thing

[37:53] And then they paid money at the bar and they paid money for pizzas and I don't know people expect it more

[37:59] I expect it more

[38:00] It's not how I would have done it if I were Stern and I were celebrating 30 years of this company being in business

[38:07] I would have very simply

[38:09] Made people feel like they were experiencing what it was what Stern has done over the last 30 years

[38:14] I would have had a room in the major room

[38:16] I would align that music hall with one of each game that Stern has made over the last 30 years

[38:23] Now maybe that's too many games right but at least have like 30 or 40 or 50 games

[38:28] Lined up so you can just see what we've done

[38:31] Let people play while you have the music going while you have the bar going turn that freaking place Viper alley into the biggest pinball barcade

[38:41] In Chicago that night and they didn't do that they didn't bring anything

[38:46] Um instead they hired all these like side show acts to just do all these things and you know

[38:51] The best part of the night for me was just waiting online and sitting down with zombie Yeti and Ernie Hudson

[38:56] And and that was great. It was intimate and they were all really nice and and there was like a slimer behind Ernie Hudson

[39:02] It was a great photo op great autograph picture from zombie Yeti

[39:07] But it just seemed like the skits are front-end event and I think they should have just celebrated pinball more

[39:13] And I you know I heard from other people too and I heard this that

[39:16] It there is just like there a lot of like crude jokes and this and that and there were kids there and there were wives there

[39:22] And here's what I want to here's my advice to Stern moving forward

[39:26] You guys are selling 15,000 dollar pinball machines you want to you need to start acting a little bit like the premium company you want to be

[39:34] And I know that's hard. I know this has always been like sort of uh

[39:37] You know like like a dive bar kind of toy that

[39:41] You guys have developed this sort of sarcastic

[39:44] Personality but I think it's time to grow up

[39:47] I really do and this is coming from canada someone who who never grows up right when when it's coming for me

[39:52] You know you know things are serious

[39:54] But I think Stern needs to start maturing

[39:56] I think they need to start maturing and acting a little bit like a mature company that takes the high road at times

[40:02] Um, I heard they were handing out pizza. I wasn't there for this her handing out pizza trying to get people

[40:07] Uh, to not go in the jack's presentation for the lawler game. I think that's a bit of a classless move

[40:14] I mean this that's not that's not cool

[40:16] Like everyone should should share the spotlight with each other and let them have their stage

[40:21] I think that's a classless move

[40:22] I think whenever these the owners of these companies whether it's jack shitting on Stern or it's Gary shitting on jack

[40:28] When the Dutch guys got up there a couple of years ago and cursed out everybody

[40:32] I think that's classless. I think these companies need to let their products do the talking and not engage in such juvenile behavior

[40:40] Uh, you know, and I think I think Stern is at the point now where

[40:44] We know you're the biggest pinball company in the world

[40:47] We know you ship games consistently and we are all very thankful for that

[40:50] We know you make great games Batman 66 looks like a really fun game

[40:54] But as a company and as a company that is a leader

[40:58] I think you need to start acting like a leader a little bit more

[41:01] And I think you need to just it's time to start maturesing a little bit

[41:04] Especially when you want to start selling games that are indicating that you're now the Porsche of this industry the Mercedes

[41:10] Uh, you can't keep acting this way. I don't think it makes people laugh

[41:16] I don't think people are in on the joke. I think it's a lot of

[41:20] Stern's internal people thinking this is a good idea and I think they're missing it. I think they're missing the point that this is a show

[41:26] Um, where people expect more from you. Okay, so that's why Stern in my book finishes in in third place in terms of expo this year

[41:34] And they and look they definitely spent the most money. So I think that's a big miss for them. All right, so number two

[41:41] Is Jersey Jack pinball and dialed in okay, so this was sort of the

[41:47] Oh my god, what the hell did we just see moment of the show? So

[41:53] What do I think so I saw the Jersey Jack reveal on periscope and

[41:59] I watched this huge room of people go completely silent when they pulled the curtain off the games

[42:06] I thought it was hysterical before him when they had the black sheets over the games and everyone on pinside

[42:12] Was like the back box is too feet taller than a normal pin and it's wow

[42:17] Is this like some sort of like safe cracker like tiny pin? Is this some sort of like bonds? I run it

[42:23] It's just a normal cabinet guys

[42:25] Just goes the show like you give pinside

[42:28] Enough time and they will make something out of nothing all right, but anyway, so

[42:34] The games revealed and like I heard I heard everybody say worse theme ever

[42:40] I don't want to play a game about a cell phone

[42:42] Jack doesn't know what the hell he's doing. This is like the biggest misstep this company's done

[42:47] Jack should just go lock himself in the room in exbow

[42:50] They should just go home right now

[42:52] Lock it up these guys are done and this sort of game was sort of being

[42:57] Everyone's like dead on arrival dialed in now. I got a chance to play this game a lot

[43:03] And I have to say without a doubt

[43:05] This was the best game at exbow with the absolutely worst name of a game ever

[43:13] And others are saying it I listen to Nate show on the plane coming back he said it

[43:20] They made a huge mistake calling this game dialed in it this game is not about cell phones per say

[43:28] The cell phone is part of the game

[43:31] But the game is about saving quantum city it this game is basically sim city

[43:35] It's an unlicensed sim city when people say medieval madness is an unlicensed

[43:41] Montape python and the holy grail

[43:43] If you want to say that like tells the ribbing nights is an unlicensed Aladdin

[43:47] This is an unlicensed version of sim city where the city is under attack and you need to save the city from aliens from meteor showers from this from that

[43:58] Awesome right from the attack of the 50 foot woman

[44:01] It's like yeah like that sounds like a theme I could get into

[44:05] dialed in

[44:07] Dialed in

[44:09] Does nothing to indicate what this game is about at all in fact throughout this show

[44:16] Nobody could really articulate

[44:19] What this game was about the biggest confusion was people were like

[44:25] I think you're trying to destroy the city and some people are like no, I think you're trying to save it

[44:29] And there's this confusion and I don't know like it didn't seem like that confusing

[44:36] But the game itself

[44:38] shoots amazingly well it is

[44:41] gorgeous like this game next to Batman 66 it's embarrassingly

[44:48] how much

[44:51] better

[44:52] Dialed in looks than Batman in terms of like when you look at it the quality the amount of

[44:58] Original thinking going on at the amount of mechanisms and toys and shots and

[45:04] And lights and all these things dialed in looks incredible

[45:10] Uh, I hate saying dialed in looks incredible. I wish I could say and Nate said this and others have said it

[45:16] Quantum city

[45:17] Should be the name of this game jack if you are listening

[45:20] And I know you have the ability to change the artwork just change the title

[45:25] Call it quantum city

[45:27] You know or escape from quantum city give it like a fun name

[45:31] You know

[45:32] Diled in and this character with his shirt tucked into his jeans

[45:38] Nobody

[45:39] Tucks their dress shirt into their jeans

[45:43] That no one wants to be that

[45:45] loser

[45:46] You know

[45:47] And he's holding his cell phone up sort of like a he man. I got the power like a lightsaber

[45:52] You know looks a lot like the loop image and you hope

[45:56] So it's confusing because it just everyone thinks this game is about cell phones and it's not cell phones

[46:01] It's like just the weapon it'd be like if you just called star wars lightsaber here's a game it here's a movie

[46:06] It's called lightsaber

[46:08] Ah, that sounds good star wars much better see marketing matters as much as you guys think my job is a joke

[46:15] And I'm a joke

[46:16] Marketing matters this was a marketing decision and this is a mistake by jack and Nate said this and I agree

[46:23] Jack should have pushed back and been like yeah, this is awesome. This is awesome. This is awesome

[46:27] You're gonna call what no man. We can't call that

[46:31] What's the game about okay? It's saving this city. Okay. What's the city called quantum city? Okay save quantum city

[46:37] Or quantum city just something

[46:40] Not dialed in I look they have nine months before this game supposedly ships. I didn't think I'd go back

[46:45] And change it to quantum city even just on the on the cabinet you can sell the image of the guy in the middle of playfield holding up the phone

[46:52] But really if they make that change I think people are gonna warm up because it's such an awesome game

[46:59] It's such an awesome game. I saw so many people enjoying it loving it having a good time

[47:04] Uh, it's got a lot of innovation. That's really cool

[47:06] I think they emphasize too much of fact that it can like connect to your cell phone like that's cool

[47:11] But man, that's not really the that's not really what it's gonna drive a pinball person to love this game

[47:16] The shots the amount of like things that happen in this game are really cool

[47:22] One really cool mode in this game is where like these lasers are being fired at your flippers and the lights are slowly

[47:28] Lighting up towards your flipper and the closer they get to your flipper if you don't hit the shots to push back the laser beam

[47:33] The flipper starts like flipping erratically. I mean, I was like well, that's cool

[47:38] The toys are really cool. I think another thing that's kind of confusing for people in this game is it looks like law or did

[47:44] Just like throw everything in and

[47:47] There's stuff that I just don't get like I get the fact that you've got this electrical guy that moves across the playfield

[47:53] And you got to hit him to charge the phone. I thought it was cool. It's like it's a rewarding shot

[47:57] The ramps the crisscrossing ramps are super rewarding to hit

[48:01] The one thing I just didn't get in the game and maybe this is gonna come through more as as the storyline gets developed in the mode

[48:08] Was the Einstein theater in the middle. It's very much

[48:12] You know like the ectogagos sort of like hologram inside there. I didn't understand why why is this

[48:18] A game about saving a city

[48:20] dominated by this Einstein theater in the middle of the playfield

[48:24] It just it didn't make sense to me and look maybe that's gonna come through more as code develops more

[48:30] But it just seemed like a little confusing when I just looked at it to understand how each toy in each

[48:37] Mechanism related to the story and related to the theme of the game and that's where I think everyone is right now at this game

[48:44] It's got really cool things like the selfie mode

[48:46] That's awesome. You're playing and it takes your picture on a Polaroid and all of a sudden your photos up on the back box

[48:51] People were dying laughing at that. I saw women like cracking up Brenda loved it

[48:57] It's really really cool

[49:00] There was I heard there's like a mode where you actually wave your hand and it's like you're scratching off lotto tickets and

[49:05] And the camera can see your hands scratching them off

[49:08] Really really awesome innovation put into a game

[49:12] But again, I think it's just so much going on

[49:16] It's hard to see how this is all cohesive and then we have the last part of this whole thing that makes me really just want to

[49:25] Take my head and smash it into a wall

[49:27] And that's the way Jack talked about the pricing of this machine

[49:31] What what is with

[49:33] Jack and his pricing and his marketing around his games? I mean

[49:38] It's like the guy sits in a room and says you know what?

[49:41] How can I really try and fuck people over when it comes to pricing and limited editions and and what would really make people mad

[49:51] He Jack needs like just two

[49:54] Two columns this would make people happy and this would piss people off and right now

[50:01] When I look at how Jack releases his games he's really got everything and this is what would piss people off

[50:06] Release was limited edition

[50:09] Okay, so we're only going to make this many limited editions then release another

[50:14] Ruby red edition that is more expensive and is now the more limited version

[50:19] Release the hobbit limited edition

[50:22] All right, we're only going to make this many limited edition hobbits. Okay. Oh, but if you want to order smalg edition

[50:28] You can order a smalg edition anytime up until December 31st and we're going to make as many smags as people order

[50:34] Um the head is going to be gold

[50:35] Okay, now now that we're saying that smalgine limited edition are sold out here's the black arrow edition

[50:41] Which Jack also announced the show another edition of the hobbit jack needs to stop

[50:45] He needs to stop this guy's out of his mind with all these editions and all these variations and it's just getting to the point where Jack

[50:52] You're just fucking yourself over people are just tired. Who I mean you're not you're not fooling any

[50:57] Buddy with all these editions and when he announced the dialed in pricing

[51:02] He said the game is nine thousand dollars and that made people just be like fuck like here we go like was originally

[51:11] 6500 hobbit was 7500 now. This is nine thousand dollars

[51:15] Um, and then he's like we're gonna make

[51:18] limited edition

[51:20] Between one and seven thousand six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine is what he said now

[51:24] I don't understand if people didn't understand the sarcasm there he was that was like a sarcastic joke

[51:31] He's saying 7000 limited edition that's like him's just making fun of

[51:36] All of the Ellie nonsense that's been going on in the world that was Jack's attempt at humor

[51:42] Um, but I don't think people found it funny because the price is higher than they may have expected for an original IP

[51:49] Uh, and it's just stupid. It's like stupid

[51:52] You're not gonna let number these games jack one to seven thousand

[51:55] Uh, but the ultimate joke is when jack said and we're gonna make a collector's edition

[52:00] That's twelve thousand five hundred dollars. I mean did Jack just come up with that a week ago when stern announced the super Ellie

[52:08] probably yes

[52:10] And it's just another one of these like armor packages with like unique translate and signed by pat and and then he said we're gonna make

[52:18] We're gonna make as many collectors editions

[52:21] um

[52:22] We're gonna fill every order for them that we get between now and the end of the year

[52:28] So what happened Jack what happened to you saying you're not gonna take pre-orders on on Pat's game

[52:34] You're not gonna reveal the game until it's ready to ship. So those are two things

[52:38] You're going against and and now you're saying you're taking pre-orders

[52:44] um, and you're gonna cut off the orders for lim- the collector's edition at the end of the year

[52:51] I just think this is all bogus

[52:53] Why would anybody go in on a collector's edition?

[52:57] We all know what jack is gonna do

[52:59] He's gonna take all the money for that

[53:02] All right, you don't know when you're gonna get your game. So you could be in another was situation

[53:06] Was in hobbit situation where you wait months. I don't think so this game seemed pretty far along

[53:12] Uh, but again as we know it's not about like putting a prototype up there

[53:16] It's about ordering parts and getting it on the line that could take months or years

[53:20] um, and then here's what jack's gonna do

[53:22] He's gonna announce another edition after he gets all the money for that

[53:27] This jack needs to stop

[53:30] He needs to say this is exactly how many of each version we're gonna make and that's that

[53:34] And if you want to have like in the limited run like stern has on premiums

[53:37] That's fine, but I think he keeps fucking people over with these like special editions that he just you know

[53:43] He makes an arbitrary number of them and then he turns to the next

[53:46] So what do I think I think 12,500 dollars is absolutely bonkers and nuts for dial then

[53:52] But I'll say this I don't think nine thousand dollars is crazy for this game when you put it next to

[53:58] What else is out there? You I mean

[54:01] The game looks twice as good as dominoes looks like it has twice as much innovation twice as much quality as a dominoes pinball machine

[54:10] Um, it definitely embarrasses Batman Ellie for 10 grand definitely

[54:16] I there is no there is no comparison between Batman Ellie and dialed in in terms of quality

[54:22] If you go through dialed in there is more money that went into making the single mechanism

[54:27] Uh of the guy that goes across the play field that it's got these lightning bolts that light up when you hit him

[54:32] All of those toys all of the fun stuff and dialed in the

[54:36] The they've got the drones where the blade spin all of the stuff in there is made for the game

[54:43] Is made for the game

[54:44] Einstein's theater original toys original mechs and you've got to be kidding me that you think nine thousand is just way too much for it

[54:53] You think this this should sell for seven thousand dollars really

[54:57] Really I mean this game it makes ghostbusters look

[55:01] Embarrassing in terms of like what's in it again you have to play dialed in you will love it

[55:06] You will love it and you will hate it at the same time and that's why everyone is so frustrated

[55:10] And I think they could easily make it a game people love if they re-themed it and jack I think you should do it

[55:15] I really do I think you should listen to what people are saying because

[55:19] I don't care if it's like

[55:21] No one wants to walk around the dialed in t-shirt. They'd walk around the quantum city t-shirts. All right

[55:25] So I'm trying to get this in for under an hour

[55:27] But I think jack knows what he needs to do to make this a winner

[55:30] But I'm also you know this game's not shipping for nine months like he'd be hearing like April

[55:35] May is when it's going to go out

[55:38] So really frustrated to see

[55:40] Distributors asking for deposits on this game. I don't think anyone should put a deposit down on this game

[55:46] Of jacks making seven thousand versions of it. Why would you ever lock in money?

[55:50] The Ellie and the limited versions of Jersey jack games are all

[55:55] Lies you will get your game when you want it

[55:59] You'll get it whenever you want it and you should wait to this thing ships and to code is further along and see what the final thing is

[56:05] I think you're a fool if you go in an eclectic edition. I really do

[56:08] It doesn't matter how much you love pat lawler jack is proving time and time again not to lock up money early

[56:13] But the game is so damn good and that's why they finished number two. So number one

[56:18] In terms of game at the expo that I think got the most buzz and got most people talking and most people excited

[56:25] Uh, was highway pinballs alien

[56:28] And I didn't expect that to be the case and I first want to start out by saying

[56:34] um

[56:34] Something about on a personal level about highway pinball and myself and and what happened at the show and I just want to sort of

[56:43] Clear the air and say something and and set the record straight and and move on from there. So

[56:50] Yes, I had some

[56:52] Words with Andrew highway and with oric loss and at the show and Andrew actually came up and asked to talk to me

[56:58] Express some concerns about things he thought I was doing

[57:02] To hurt his company and I've been critical of highway pinball in the past and I haven't lied and I've been up front about that

[57:10] And my concerns about what they're doing at times and I've had my personal beef with oric as well

[57:15] Now all I want to say in this matter is this I spoke with Andrew and we came to an agreement

[57:23] And we came to an understanding and after I had my conversation with or I mean so with Andrew

[57:29] Or it came and found me he walked around and you know he came and found where I was and he said hey man

[57:34] Let's talk and we talked

[57:36] And we got a lot of stuff out in the open a lot of stuff about

[57:40] Assumptions that were being made about speculations about things we thought each other had said and this and that and I'll say this

[57:48] We've all acted poorly at times and we've all acted emotionally and we've all acted out

[57:53] Without thinking about what we're doing

[57:56] But again my conversation with oric didn't end with fists being thrown or we didn't end with us yelling at each other

[58:03] It ended with us shaking hands and saying it's cool

[58:09] And both of the conversations ended with the same sentiment that people really want alien pinball and let's get now to the game

[58:16] I heard so many people

[58:19] Excited about alien and as I told Andrew and told or people really want this game. They want you guys to get them the game

[58:25] That game gets out to people

[58:28] You have buyers you have people who are excited to get it and when the game ships all of this bullshit all the drama all the speculation

[58:37] All of that will dissipate immediately when people start getting their alien pinball machines and so

[58:45] This is what I heard unanimously from so many people that this is just a theme that people would cut off an arm to get

[58:53] People love alien. They love love love the theme when we talk about how dialed in is such a miss

[58:59] alien is such a

[59:02] Home run theme. I mean imagine pat law they're making alien pinball, right?

[59:08] Yeah, you get the picture right these guys picked a theme that people have such an emotional attachment to

[59:15] That people are gonna go in on any alien pin regardless of even how good it is I think that's how much people like the theme

[59:22] um

[59:23] And so what did I think of the final package? You know, I have to say I

[59:28] I think it I think it did its job. I think people are excited by what they saw

[59:33] I think the game needs polish though

[59:35] You know and that's gonna happen and then I went to the alien presentation and I listened to them talk

[59:41] And the US team hasn't even got in the game yet and I know they're anxiously waiting to get it

[59:46] They can't put the polish that they want on this game until the programmer actually physically has it until the artist

[59:53] Physically is in front of it

[59:55] So there's a lot of work to be done to get this game as polished and as finished as they want it to be

[01:00:03] You know, but they're saying stuff like when you get the game the game is gonna be done like yeah

[01:00:08] They'll make some slight code

[01:00:10] Improvements, but it's not gonna be one of these games where modes don't work where features don't work where things are in the

[01:00:16] Game yet. No, they're they're programming it so that all works. That is music to the ears of

[01:00:22] Of pinball fans, right

[01:00:25] I mean the game looks fine. I didn't I didn't even get chance to flip it

[01:00:30] And I'll tell you why I didn't get a chance to flip it because there was always a lot of people online

[01:00:35] Waiting to play it and they only had two

[01:00:38] So it wasn't as easy to wait online and get in on one as it was with dialed in

[01:00:42] But I was happy to see that attention

[01:00:45] Because at the end of the day pinball machines should excited should make us want to play should make us want to jump on and

[01:00:53] From what I saw in the in the seminar that they gave I think the screen looks really good

[01:00:59] I think it's really sort of got this cool like nostalgic

[01:01:04] Look and feel to the visuals of the game

[01:01:08] The news that Ripley is not in it right. It's finally been confirmed and they don't have Sigourney Weaver in the game

[01:01:14] Yeah, everyone's bummed out about that no one's like yeah, man. I'm great. She's not in it

[01:01:18] We didn't really need her because she doesn't really have many quotes while it's true

[01:01:21] She doesn't have many quotes in the alien films

[01:01:24] Not having her likeness and not having her in the game at all is a disappointment

[01:01:30] But here's what I could do I could say that's a deal breaker like that's stupid

[01:01:35] They don't know how to do a licensing deal. They suck don't get alien

[01:01:39] Uh, I'm not why would I say that because it is what it is Roger sharp was there and they tried to get it and

[01:01:44] She said no, so what are they gonna do not make the game

[01:01:47] So they made the game to the best of their ability with what they were dealt with

[01:01:51] um and and again

[01:01:54] I'm giving alien the number one spotted expert because of like what I heard from other people and other people out there

[01:02:00] They're not saying I'm dropping out but not saying I'm not gonna

[01:02:03] You know, I'm not gonna go in on it because of that fact

[01:02:06] Um, they would have liked what have been there and it's not so what are you gonna do?

[01:02:11] You know, we just have to accept the game we get

[01:02:14] Uh, in terms of like the overall visual look and feel of the game

[01:02:17] You know, I think there's some plastics on it that look like they could be a little bit better

[01:02:22] I think there's like you know someone was saying like some details could be made a little bit more

[01:02:28] Uh, you know

[01:02:30] Like the alien had like it was painted or glossy like the original showed it

[01:02:34] You know, I think some things could be a little bit higher end looking and feeling

[01:02:38] But again, this is a prototype

[01:02:40] Again, there's a lot of room on that

[01:02:43] Pinball machine for the mod community to step in and and and and make some of that stuff happen

[01:02:48] uh, but from what I heard from people who did play it uh, they enjoyed it

[01:02:54] So this is canada saying

[01:02:57] Out of all the games at the show

[01:02:59] The one that people enjoyed and also liked the theme and we're still excited to go in on the number one game goes to alien

[01:03:08] And I think I just have to report it that way

[01:03:11] Personally, I'm not in unborn personally. I'm gonna get out of probably my Batman LE because I just don't think it's worth 10 grand

[01:03:19] And personally, I think this is a really exciting time for the hobby because there's so many options out there

[01:03:26] Uh, that I think it's time uh to sit back and see how all this stuff plays out now when it comes to alien

[01:03:33] I just don't think we're getting this game anytime soon

[01:03:35] And I said that to Andrew said, you know, why did you say november?

[01:03:38] You say november and people expect november people are like

[01:03:42] Thinking they're gonna be playing alien pinball during Thanksgiving and they're gonna have it by Christmas

[01:03:47] And we know now that the Ellie art package hasn't even

[01:03:52] Hasn't even started yet now orcs has not gonna take too long

[01:03:56] But the there's work to be done right there's work to be done that lead to me to believe that they can't start ordering parts

[01:04:03] And getting this getting everything together necessary to start shipping these games until all that stuff is done

[01:04:09] And it's not done yet

[01:04:11] And I don't think those things are gonna happen where the game ships in 2016 and that's fine right

[01:04:18] There's the only reason now people are

[01:04:21] Probably gonna be a little upset is that Andrew told them november December right and as I said to him

[01:04:26] I and I say it all the time on this podcast

[01:04:29] Why would you ever give a release date until the game is done when your game is done and ready to go in box

[01:04:35] Then you should give your release date and it should be like apple be like here's the game

[01:04:39] You can order it tomorrow and you can have it in like a couple weeks. That's the way it should work

[01:04:44] I you know american pinball is fucking up by saying

[01:04:47] Magic girl is gonna be shipping by the end of December and it's not done

[01:04:51] So what if there are like delays?

[01:04:53] I didn't foresee whether they're legal or if they're with like a mechanism or a part or any to any delay

[01:04:59] They are then fucked

[01:05:01] And then look like they lied and they they went back on their promise

[01:05:06] So here's where I think people should go with alien. I like I don't think if you pre-ordered cool

[01:05:13] I don't think people should be giving any more money though

[01:05:16] Until the game is ready for production and I think Andrew should just be transparent about when that production is actually gonna start

[01:05:22] And in and an email and out saying that production was starting and it didn't so we just I just I think if everyone's transparent

[01:05:30] Everybody wins and then no one is is misled and no one feels like they've locked their money in and now the wait might be six months and not

[01:05:38] Two months right so

[01:05:40] Alien though takes it from expo

[01:05:44] This is not me like making up for for being a jerk to those guys at time

[01:05:50] I'm calling it like it is. I'm calling it like it is. I think expo 2016

[01:05:55] Was it was was a little bit of a letdown and I have to be honest

[01:05:58] There's a little bit of a letdown

[01:06:01] Because of the lack of playable games that we thought we were gonna be able to play

[01:06:05] I thought I was gonna be able to play the new attack from Mars remake

[01:06:08] I thought I was gonna be able to play Houdini at least or see a video of magic girl

[01:06:13] I thought I was easily gonna be able to play Batman

[01:06:16] I thought I thought I thought and I was wrong

[01:06:20] And so only half of the games really showed up that we're supposed to

[01:06:24] Out of those the games that were there

[01:06:28] The one that's supposed to ship the soonest wasn't even playable and that's Batman

[01:06:32] I think there's a long wait for Lawler's pin which makes it strange that Jack showed it so early

[01:06:38] um, and you know alien we don't know what the release date is currently. We know there's work to be done

[01:06:44] But I was just you know, I just a little disappointed. I I

[01:06:47] I'd love that hanging out with people

[01:06:49] I love the socializing that happens at expo

[01:06:52] Because it's all positive though, and that's the thing

[01:06:54] It's you know when I read pin side when I was there and I was on it frequently

[01:06:59] There was just a lot of constant negativity on the forums and you meet these guys in real life and everyone is really awesome

[01:07:06] And I really implore the people that continue to be like ultra negative all the time

[01:07:12] To just chill out it's pinball these are toys

[01:07:16] Um, you know a lot of people call me all sorts of names out there

[01:07:18] I'm looking at you iceman call me like I'm a phony like how am I a phony like I I've always been honest about

[01:07:25] My situation with pinball and and look iceman. I'd love to have you on the show

[01:07:29] And that's the thing you know, I've been called out by some guys recently and just come on talk about pinball

[01:07:34] Talk about why you think I don't deserve to have a podcast or a microphone and I'll happily talk to you about it

[01:07:40] And you can make your point

[01:07:42] But here's the thing whenever I offer guys like iceman the chance to come on the show

[01:07:46] They usually run and hide and don't want anything to do with it

[01:07:49] They're so vocal the guy will like post

[01:07:52] 150 times a day and then you ask him to come out from behind the keyboard

[01:07:57] Talk talk like a human being talk like a man to me and he probably won't iceman

[01:08:03] I hope you do the the offers out there

[01:08:06] The same thing was true in that new guy with tim crowley's corn ball pin cast

[01:08:12] Insults me insult me insults me so I said hey man

[01:08:16] How can I come on your show and talk to you and we can talk about why you think I'm such a this and that and he's like

[01:08:22] No, we won't have you on the show all right cool

[01:08:25] And I'll say this I asked Andrew highway if he would come on the podcast and he said he would

[01:08:30] So I hope to get him on one day soon and we can talk about what's going on with alien and when what the release date

[01:08:35] Looks like moving forward for people

[01:08:36] But I come out of the show with with with with with one one feeling

[01:08:42] And that is this is a really exciting time for pinball and there's a lot of amazing people in this hobby

[01:08:47] And you'll meet tons of amazing people in this hobby

[01:08:51] I've made new friends at this year's expo and those are the things that I really enjoy

[01:08:57] It is meeting unique individuals from all walks of life who all share a common passion for pinball

[01:09:03] We don't insult each other. We don't make fun of each other

[01:09:07] We're not we're not constantly jabbing at each other. Let the way people do on the forums

[01:09:11] We're all we're all really like nice people on person

[01:09:14] I think that's what I love about this hobby

[01:09:17] And it's an exciting time to be part of it and there's all these games coming out right if you would if you had gone back 10 years and said

[01:09:24] In the year 2006 in 10 years

[01:09:27] There's going to be this many manufacturers this many games on the horizon this many new and box pinball machines

[01:09:33] People would have said you're f-ing crazy no way the industry was about to die back then right

[01:09:38] So it's incredible. We're right now my advice is this though because as much as we see prototypes

[01:09:45] And as much as we see flashing new machines and and new innovations and this and that

[01:09:50] Pinball machines are getting really expensive and there's no denying that and

[01:09:55] Stern shifting the market so far high on Batman and and Jjp following

[01:10:01] People keep saying like it's just it's out of control

[01:10:04] I don't know. I don't really think it is

[01:10:06] I think what is happening now more than ever is you really just need to wait

[01:10:11] You need to wait now and make sure you buy a machine you love and we're at a time now

[01:10:16] There's there's there's like a silver lining with high prices and the silver lining is this the higher the prices get

[01:10:23] the less the less

[01:10:25] These expensive pins are going to sell out

[01:10:28] And the less likelihood these games will ever increase in value

[01:10:32] So you'll be able to buy

[01:10:34] Use versions of these games when code is done

[01:10:38] For much cheaper than people pay for these games new there is nowhere a Batman Ellie is going in price

[01:10:45] But down there is nowhere a ghostbusters Ellie with old DMD technology is going but down in price

[01:10:53] I predict that dialed in will actually have a price decrease before it is even announced and if people buy them

[01:11:01] For nine grand they're not going to be selling them used for eighty eight hundred a year later

[01:11:06] You're going to start to see more and more of these titles will be obtainable when code is finished for a much more reasonable price

[01:11:14] Because so much volume will be out there and so many options will be out there that it's people keep using carguments right

[01:11:21] I think they're finally going to get the reality is it's going to get there where it is like the car industry and every car

[01:11:29] loses money for the most part right very very very very very very few go up in price

[01:11:34] Uh, so I think it's an exciting time but I think everyone should hold on to their money. I that's my advice

[01:11:40] You should spend the next six months to nine months to a year if you want anything

[01:11:47] And if you if you have to have it yes then go get it

[01:11:51] But I would just wait

[01:11:53] It makes so much sense to wait if you wait a year from now everything we just saw it ex though

[01:11:57] You'll be able to get new inbox quickly from a distributor in just a matter of days if you wait

[01:12:03] If you wait a year you'll be able to see what Star Wars is all about

[01:12:06] You'll be able to see what Erasmith is all about you'll be able to see what else comes out from the industry if you wait

[01:12:12] But if you run now and you run in your hand distributors your money and you lock in your money on games

[01:12:19] And those games don't ship when you expect them to or those games are delayed or another game comes out

[01:12:25] And now you're locked into this game

[01:12:27] You're gonna be frustrated. You're gonna wish you had waited. I just don't see any benefit to rushing in to get anything

[01:12:34] And I think that's my advice and I think if we all can just take a step back

[01:12:40] And realize after Expo now there's gonna be a law

[01:12:44] There's gonna be a period now where nothing is really gonna happen for a few weeks

[01:12:49] Uh, the two things that people there's three things that between now and the end of the year

[01:12:54] That people should talk about

[01:12:56] One will American Pimbo actually deliver on their promise of magic girls two will Batman 66 ship

[01:13:04] And will be worth the money and three will alien come out anytime this year

[01:13:10] I think those are three narratives of storylines that were promised to happen in 2016
