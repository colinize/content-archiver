[00:00] Shame! Shame!

[00:04] This is a special edition of Kineita's Pinball Podcast and it's called Shame.

[00:16] And it's going to be focused on really mainly on what I believe are behaviors that we see

[00:22] consistently by certain pinball manufacturers that they should be shameful of.

[00:29] And also pinball retailers.

[00:32] So I woke up this morning and I saw that the alien pinball thread has been sort of going,

[00:39] has been ignited again.

[00:41] And mainly because people in that thread are starting to lose patience and you have

[00:45] to understand why they're losing patience.

[00:48] And I'm not going to go over the whole backstory of alien pinball.

[00:52] But when you miss release dates over and over again, there comes a point where people

[00:57] are going to raise red flags.

[01:00] And raising the red flags is a really sticky situation because we remember, we remember

[01:08] very specifically when predator had issues and people were trying to raise red flags.

[01:15] What happened?

[01:16] I'll tell you what happened.

[01:18] There were a few individuals led by a guy that we all know as wise Snow and Hilton who

[01:24] reassured everybody that things were fine.

[01:27] This is what he did during the predator fiasco and what happened.

[01:33] Things weren't fine and enough people were burned because they listened to guys like

[01:40] wise Snow and Hilton and they didn't read the writing on the wall and they didn't look

[01:45] at the red flags.

[01:46] And I want to talk about red flags and when we should raise them and when a red flag

[01:52] goes up, what people should probably do at that point.

[01:57] And the first red flag that I think everyone can agree with is when you miss a release

[02:02] date.

[02:03] When you say this game is going to be ready on this date and then that date comes and goes,

[02:10] that should be a red flag to everybody because that means that the company is having delays

[02:16] and issues and problems.

[02:18] And we all know that making pinball is hard and startup pinball companies have a very difficult

[02:24] time realizing all the work that goes into putting a pinball machine in a box and getting

[02:31] it to you.

[02:32] And so for alien, the red flags of missed release dates go back two years.

[02:39] Remember, this game is two years delayed in April of 2017.

[02:44] So we also heard in the summertime that this game was definitely going to be out by September

[02:50] October, would definitely be in people's hands by expo, would definitely be in people's

[02:55] homes by Thanksgiving.

[02:57] So we all know those dates came and went.

[03:00] So those are more red flags, right?

[03:02] More release dates, more release dates missed.

[03:05] And then we got communication in November that there was definitely going to be 30 games

[03:11] that went out in December, right?

[03:15] 30 games were going to go out and then 100 games were definitely going to go out in January,

[03:19] right?

[03:20] So those are just words by the company itself.

[03:24] And so what happened?

[03:25] All those dates came and went and no games went out.

[03:30] More red flags, okay?

[03:32] But all throughout that, if you go read the thread, all throughout that period where red flags

[03:37] should be raised, you still have guys like Hilton and a few others that continue to say

[03:44] progress is moving forward.

[03:46] Everything's looking great.

[03:48] Everything is awesome and I can't wait to get my alien.

[03:51] And I don't think the facts could be anything more contrary to what those guys constantly

[03:59] say.

[04:00] When you show up to the biggest coin-opt show in all of Europe and your machine is broken,

[04:06] broken, how is that progress?

[04:10] How is that progress?

[04:11] And so I want to talk about those red flags because here we are.

[04:15] This February was February 2nd and there's still no release date.

[04:21] There's still no news, okay?

[04:23] So the release date's slipping is red flag number one.

[04:27] And I think we've seen tons of red flags with alien when it comes to release dates.

[04:31] The other ginormous red flag.

[04:34] And to me, this red flag is probably the most telling is when people struggle to get their

[04:39] refunds.

[04:41] I went in on alien, probably like eight months to a year ago and I asked for a refund.

[04:48] Now if you go in on alien, the refund policy is spelled out.

[04:52] If you need a refund, you will get your refund within 30 days and you also pay a little bit

[04:58] of a PayPal transaction fee, okay?

[05:01] And the refund is $1,500.

[05:04] When I tried to get a refund and this was probably over six months ago, it took much

[05:10] longer than 30 days.

[05:13] It took much longer than that.

[05:14] The day they gave me that I would have my refund by came and went.

[05:18] I had to send multiple emails and eventually I did get it.

[05:23] But it was long after the 30 days and also so you know, when you get a refund, you lose

[05:28] a few hundred bucks.

[05:29] So there's that part of it.

[05:30] Now, we saw recently of the last few weeks individuals who came on to Pinside and said,

[05:37] I have asked for a refund since November, since October, I've sent 27 emails, I haven't

[05:44] heard back.

[05:45] And so when these people get fed up, what do they do?

[05:49] They come on Pinside and they announce to the community the trouble they're having

[05:55] getting their refunds.

[05:57] And it always amazes me.

[05:58] It always amazes me how this always happens time and time again.

[06:03] When you email an organization and ask for a refund and you get no response for months

[06:09] and then you go on Pinside and within a day or just within hours, we always see the company

[06:14] respond and say, hey, sorry for the delay.

[06:17] I'm going to reach out to you today.

[06:19] That is our huge red flag because what that means is this.

[06:24] They are purposely ignoring a customer who wants their money back because the red flag,

[06:30] if you look at it, it's simple.

[06:32] They don't have the money to give the refunds or if they do give the refund, they're going

[06:38] to be hurting even more.

[06:39] And it is such a red flag.

[06:42] And the fact that whenever in highways case Andrew comes into the thread and says, oh,

[06:48] sorry for the delay.

[06:49] Yeah, I'm taking care of this guy now.

[06:51] And people are like, see, he's such a good guy.

[06:54] He's such a great guy.

[06:56] He listens and he hilt and all you guys out there who don't get it.

[07:01] But don't you realize this is not the act of a great business man who's making a decision

[07:09] because he's doing the right thing.

[07:10] He's being publicly shamed and called out for being delinquent.

[07:15] And his response is a response of mercy to not have more people demand a refund.

[07:23] And I think it's always shameful when these companies have to wait until there's a public

[07:30] outcry to handle the refunds of their customers.

[07:35] And that is a ginormous red flag.

[07:37] And we've seen it.

[07:38] And if it was just one incident, right, it was just one incident.

[07:42] Maybe I believe it.

[07:43] Maybe I believe it, but when it's many instances, then I have a hard time believing that they

[07:50] just didn't see the email.

[07:52] And that's the other thing too, right?

[07:53] We see all the time that excuse like, I didn't see the email or I didn't read it in the

[07:59] thread.

[08:01] And so how many times are we going to hear people say this?

[08:05] And yet we have this small group of people constantly reaffirming everybody that everything

[08:12] is okay.

[08:14] So that is a humongous red flag.

[08:16] Okay, let's go to the next red flag that I've seen recently.

[08:20] So I've heard rumors that there were board issues with alien.

[08:24] And I've heard rumors that the board issues aren't as simple as everyone believes in getting

[08:31] new boards made and new boards to the factory and that and you know, getting games out.

[08:35] You can't make games without boards.

[08:37] It's like making a car without an engine, right?

[08:40] And so we know, we know for a fact that Andrew reads Pinside Daily and that he is on top

[08:50] of his thread, right?

[08:51] If you're in charge of a pinball company, wouldn't you read what is said about your company

[08:57] every day, especially in a time like this, where every day matters, right?

[09:03] You've got to make sure that people are in upset that the frustration levels haven't reached

[09:08] a point where people are ready to bail in numbers.

[09:11] So you're reading it and we know he does.

[09:12] We know he does because every time there's enough pressure or refund, you know, stories,

[09:17] he pops in immediately and he immediately knows that he, it's time for him to act.

[09:22] And whether or not he's personally reading the threads or not, he has people that he

[09:26] knows that are reading it, that are tipping him off when it's time to come in.

[09:31] So over the past week or so, the rumors of the board issues have been circulating and

[09:37] what, what's happened?

[09:38] When those issues were raised by Rob T, which by the way, I think everyone needs to applaud

[09:44] this man for being on top of these issues and raising them, right?

[09:49] Without guys like Rob T, you're prone to getting into another bad situation where people

[09:56] could lose money because no one's asking the tough questions.

[10:00] So thank you Rob for asking those tough questions.

[10:03] And so when Rob T, not only did he put together, right, all those different examples of

[10:07] refund requests, he put together all the different comments people were making about board

[10:13] issues and what happened when he did that, the response from Hilton and why Snow?

[10:18] And we covered off on this guy in the Alien Apologist podcast.

[10:22] The response from him was what are you talking about Rob?

[10:25] The boards were working fine.

[10:26] He had some issues on day one of the show.

[10:29] They went back, came back the next day and the game was working great.

[10:33] The game was not working great.

[10:34] The game had problems with the display, not all the, not all the mechs and when I say not

[10:39] all the mechs were working.

[10:40] The main mech wasn't working, the xenomorph head.

[10:43] The game didn't work properly and yet you have Hilton who's screaming and constantly

[10:51] posting how everything's fine.

[10:54] The boards worked great.

[10:55] And yet here we are with one side of the fence saying there's board issues and Hilton

[11:00] saying no you're wrong, the boards are fine, progress.

[11:03] They had one little snap view and things are going great.

[11:06] And what happens?

[11:07] You get enough of a ground swell of people saying are there board issues and Andrew finally

[11:14] comes into the thread and confirms what?

[11:18] He confirms that yes there are board issues.

[11:21] But what really just upsets me and I just, you know, I would, Andrew emailed me and said

[11:27] like look things are, we're waiting for everything to get together and this and that.

[11:33] But when I read his podcast, I read his comment.

[11:37] He wrote that he missed, he missed the threads about the board issues.

[11:43] I apologize.

[11:44] And right there do you believe that that he missed all of those threads in his games thread

[11:51] about board issues?

[11:52] How do you miss that?

[11:54] There were tons of threads and conversation about the board issues.

[11:58] So I don't believe him right there that he missed that.

[12:01] He then says the board issues simply came down to Chinese New Year, those damn Chinese,

[12:06] right?

[12:07] Some Chinese companies require more than three months notice in the run up to holiday

[12:11] for orders.

[12:12] We missed the boat to have assembled PCBs in time for the EAG show.

[12:19] So bear PCBs arrived instead.

[12:21] We had to manually solder the first boards and that led to unexpected problems on the

[12:26] eve of the show which only got fixed on date too.

[12:30] And look, we all already saw that it wasn't fixed on date too.

[12:33] They got the boards working enough to make the game playable.

[12:38] Since then he writes, new boards have been soldered professionally and locally.

[12:44] Quantities of PCB boards will arrive from China within two weeks once the factory we use

[12:49] reopens on Monday.

[12:51] So Monday, I don't know how long the Chinese New Year go.

[12:55] It's February, right?

[12:57] But here's the word that I've seen this man use time and time again.

[13:02] And that is two weeks.

[13:05] Two weeks.

[13:06] Everything's fine in two weeks.

[13:08] And you could do an exploration of all of the comments, all the multiple times where everything

[13:14] will be good in two weeks.

[13:16] Let me tell you guys something.

[13:18] Two weeks is February 16th, the week of February, you know, 13th, 14th.

[13:24] And you still don't have one game out the door.

[13:27] And is that a red flag?

[13:29] Do you believe that he missed the thread?

[13:31] And yet on the pin side, that comment from Andrew gets 14 thumbs ups and no thumbs down.

[13:39] So what we have happening here, and this is a climate where I just have to say this.

[13:45] I hope you guys get your alien pinball machine.

[13:48] But if people lose money and people get burned, I don't care.

[13:51] I don't care because people have constantly time and time again shown one quality on

[13:56] pin side that you take at face value, what a pinball manufacturer tells you, right?

[14:04] You just take it at face value.

[14:06] And anything that Andrew ever says, anything that Kevin ever said, anything that J-pop said

[14:12] at the beginning, like people believe, like they believe because you guys want your pinball

[14:17] machine and it's too painful for you to believe anything that's contrary to that belief,

[14:24] that desire, that dream to get alien pinball.

[14:28] And you should get your alien pinball machine, you paid for it.

[14:31] And Andrew should make the games and deliver them to you.

[14:35] But I just think that these red flags should have people concerned.

[14:39] Now, I'm not telling you what to do from there.

[14:42] That's the whole thing.

[14:43] I do wish that more people would air out their frustrations and share information they

[14:49] had that could lead people to make a more educated decision here.

[14:54] And that's the problem with pinball in general is that you let these manufacturers miss dates

[15:00] by years.

[15:02] You let them lie to you.

[15:03] You let them mislead you and you still support them and wave their flags.

[15:08] You did it with Jersey Jack.

[15:10] You've done it with Andrew Highway.

[15:12] You did it with Kevin Koolick.

[15:15] And so what is the point?

[15:17] What is the point of all this protection of these individuals?

[15:22] God forbid we live in a world where people are accountable for the promises they make and

[15:30] their company.

[15:31] And God forbid their companies should go under because they're not great businessmen.

[15:36] That is the reality.

[15:37] I don't know what world you can live in where you miss a ship date by two years and you

[15:42] stay in business.

[15:44] And so the climate at highway has got to be very, very stressful and very tense and

[15:50] very anxious.

[15:51] And I know you guys are anxious to get your machines.

[15:55] And I'm not here again.

[15:56] I'm not here to tell you what to do.

[15:58] But I am here to ask everyone to simply ask the tough questions and to ignore idiots like

[16:06] Hilton.

[16:07] And Hilton, when I see you at a show, I'm not going to be shaking hands anymore.

[16:10] I just think you're an idiot because you can't even see the forest through the trees, my

[16:16] friend.

[16:17] And not only that, it's not that you're not seeing it even when you're presented with

[16:21] information that shows you were wrong, like you were flat out wrong.

[16:26] You don't shut up and go away.

[16:29] You're still in there, shilling again, shilling for someone else.

[16:34] And that needs to stop.

[16:36] And if you ask me what the PINSIDE Mod should be doing is get off their asses and stop

[16:42] creating this environment that protects these manufacturers who constantly lie to their

[16:48] customers, who constantly miss release states.

[16:52] And I read the reason why they do it because the PINSIDE moderators are the fanboys.

[16:58] They want to chill too because they are dreams of new PINBALL machines override their common

[17:05] sense.

[17:06] And I think that's why some people really enjoy this podcast is I'm not like that.

[17:11] I don't think that we should give these people passes when they make these kinds of mistakes.

[17:18] And I think they should be honest.

[17:20] And I said it weeks ago, Andrew's honesty needs to come through more.

[17:25] And he should have said this.

[17:27] He waited.

[17:28] He waited until there's that ground swell of people who want refunds.

[17:32] He waited.

[17:33] He waited.

[17:34] The problem is the time is up.

[17:36] He can't delay much further.

[17:38] And he must be getting hit up for refunds.

[17:40] And he must be getting hit up for people who are anxious and nervous.

[17:44] And the amount of people that are shilling the game are going to start to lose out to the

[17:50] people who are more and more nervous.

[17:52] I mean, look at Dutch PINBALL for example right now.

[17:56] Look at the problems they're having because of board issues.

[17:59] Their game is frozen, frozen on the assembly line for months.

[18:04] People still don't have their games.

[18:07] And so when PINBALL is having board issues, are we really to believe that all is going

[18:13] to be great in two weeks?

[18:16] I bet you more like two months.

[18:20] Do you think you're going to see an Alien PINBALL machine ship in February?

[18:24] I don't know.

[18:25] And there's other signs too that if you look at these threats and you look at the climate,

[18:30] the reason why I start to think that there are real issues is that there's also like

[18:36] a lot of silence from other people within the organization that used to be very vocal.

[18:42] Like where's Oric?

[18:43] He's nowhere to be found in the Alien threat anymore.

[18:47] He's migrated into the other threats.

[18:49] Why isn't he saying much?

[18:52] They're just in this waiting period.

[18:54] And look, again, it's going to happen.

[18:57] These delays will happen.

[18:58] But I think everyone needs to be stopped being so accepting of this kind of behavior from

[19:05] these manufacturers.

[19:06] And you need to look and ask yourself, is if this is smoke, is there a fire?

[19:13] And that's all I'm going to say about the shameful behavior I've seen over the past few

[19:18] months in terms of being honest and transparent with customers.

[19:23] The other thing that I'll just talk about briefly is a thread that popped up and just

[19:27] went nuts yesterday about the treasure code, right?

[19:32] Byer beware, treasure code.

[19:34] I bought a judge dread that was supposed to be fully working.

[19:39] And then I get the pinball machine and there's corrosion on the boards and there's all this

[19:44] damage.

[19:45] And the buyers telling people that the treasure code guy Ray told them that that damage happened

[19:54] after the buyer got the machine and everyone's like, no, that's bullshit.

[19:58] Then Ray accuses the guy of swapping out the boards and the guy shares pictures of all the

[20:03] boards with matching serial numbers.

[20:05] It's like that one time where a matching number is machine actually means something, right?

[20:11] And it's this just vitriolic thread of the community coming to sort of defend this buyer

[20:18] rightfully so.

[20:19] Like, let's be honest, to your Ray sold this guy who a broken machine he flipped it quickly

[20:25] and didn't really go through it thoroughly.

[20:27] And then there's even more drama in the story about how Ray's brother passed away and

[20:32] that's why the guy had to pay through PayPal and all this stuff.

[20:36] And it's just like, really if you read the thread, it's five pages of probably

[20:42] the most dramatic anger filled vitriol that I've seen on Pinside in a long time.

[20:51] And we've seen this before is like these retailers try to pull a fast one in the hobby and the

[20:57] community comes and works together to like basically point out the faults and enchain

[21:03] the perpetrator, right?

[21:06] And so look, it's clear what happened.

[21:10] And I think what's also good about Pinside is that when companies try to pull these

[21:17] fast ones and try to avoid dealing with a customer, Pinside is a great form for people

[21:25] to come on and air their issue and publicly shame companies who are ignoring them, right?

[21:33] That's the other side of the coin.

[21:34] There's like, there's a good side to form forms and public speaking about an issue and

[21:42] there's obviously bad sides to it.

[21:44] But in this case, it seems like Treasure Cove really painted themselves in a corner and

[21:50] then Ray came out and with this whole excuse that didn't really jive well and like refunded

[21:55] the guy like 150 bucks, when he should have just said, look, I probably didn't go over

[22:01] this game as thoroughly as possible.

[22:02] I'll give you your money back like it's no big deal.

[22:05] Like I want you to be happy.

[22:07] Like that's all he should have said.

[22:08] Instead it's like he's still holding on to his lie about the game being working when

[22:12] he sent it.

[22:13] And so look, I applaud, I applaud this buyer for taking that kind of issue to Pinside.

[22:21] I do laugh that Pinside people are like, I'm never buying from the Treasure Cove again.

[22:25] We all know that these retailers don't sell to people on Pinside or very educated buyers.

[22:32] Like people are also slamming him for charging what, $3,200 for a judge dread.

[22:37] That's not really nice and they're like, that's the price of a restored one.

[22:41] First of all, if you guys think a nicely restored judge dread is $3,000, you're out of your

[22:45] fucking minds.

[22:46] And I'm also sick of Pinside people thinking like restored pins are the price that they

[22:50] set.

[22:51] And I've really nicely restored machine of judge dread is going to go for much more

[22:56] than $3,000.

[22:57] But anyway, retail prices aside, these retailers need to make money so everything's inflated.

[23:01] No one who's in on the forum who has people, they know who have collections deals with retailers.

[23:08] They deal with other collectors when they want to buy stuff.

[23:11] But shame on you Treasure Cove, you really, you did it all wrong.

[23:16] And I think the lesson for all of us in this little special edition of mine is getting

[23:19] longer than I wanted it to is keep people honest.

[23:23] Raise the red flags, share information when you have it, let customers decide whether

[23:29] or not they want to work with those entities.

[23:32] But the more you protect manufacturers and insulate them with their lies and reinforce

[23:38] their lying by giving them thumbs up every time they talk, you are setting yourself up for

[23:44] disaster.

[23:45] And you're going to lose money.

[23:47] Other people are going to get burned and it's all because you've created a community that

[23:50] accepts people who lie, people who mislead, people who aren't honest.

[23:56] So that's it.

[23:58] Everyone needs to sort of be careful with their money in this hobby.

[24:02] I've said it before, all these companies are not going to succeed.

[24:06] Making pinball is hard.

[24:08] When you look at Stern's factory, all you got to do is this, look at Stern's factory

[24:11] videos, just look at their factory videos.

[24:14] And then go look at Highway Pinball's production video that's on YouTube.

[24:19] Look at the size of their factory.

[24:21] It's huge.

[24:23] Look at the amount of people in that factory on the production line and then go look at Stern.

[24:28] And tell me, you walk away with the same level of confidence that you're going to get

[24:33] your machine.

[24:35] This is February of 2017.

[24:38] Andrew Highway.

[24:39] Make the machine.

[24:41] Make it.

[24:42] Say anything ever again until you have a release date and that means games are in boxes

[24:48] ready to go.

[24:49] The next time you speak Andrew, you should be like games went out today.

[24:52] I think that's my advice for you.

[24:54] If people want refunds, give it to them.

[24:56] Don't make it.

[24:57] Don't make people go on the forum to ask for the refunds.

[25:00] Why snow?

[25:01] Hilton.

[25:02] Yes, I'm going to single you out.

[25:03] You need to shut the fuck up, man.

[25:05] You need to just shut up and go away.

[25:07] You have no credibility.

[25:08] You have no credibility.

[25:09] You live on the pin side.

[25:11] Your life revolves around this and you're not smart.

[25:14] You're not smart.

[25:16] All you do is help people make stupid decisions.

[25:19] That's all you've done.

[25:20] That's all you've shown to do in the past.

[25:23] It's all you'll ever do in the future.

[25:25] If any of you have problems with my feelings on why snow hit me up, he knows he's invited

[25:30] on this show every time.

[25:32] But guess what?

[25:33] The man doesn't even have a smartphone.

[25:35] The man doesn't engage in the real world of 2017.

[25:38] The man simply is a pinball operator and lids.

[25:44] I don't even know what his education level is, but he's proving time and time again.

[25:47] He's not very smart.

[25:49] For you out there who are the buyer, just smart him up.

[25:52] Smart him the fuck up people and ask the tough questions.

[25:56] And don't be afraid every once in a while to go into a thread.

[26:00] If you have information, even if you're not in on the game and share what you know.

[26:04] Look, Rob T's not even in on alien and he's helping more people make wise decisions than

[26:10] the people in on alien.

[26:12] And he might be in on alien.

[26:13] I'm sorry Rob if I said that incorrectly.

[26:16] But you know what I'm saying?

[26:17] It's like why does it take people who are not even in on it to help people make the right

[26:23] decisions.

[26:24] So, 26 minutes of Canadian pinball podcasts trying to help you guys make good decisions.

[26:29] Shame on all you guys out there who constantly do things that are only in the end.

[26:34] You're not going to be successful in business and in life if you constantly do shit like

[26:41] this.

[26:42] Canadian pinball podcasts, the only honest and truthful and direct pinball podcast out

[26:48] there have a great day everybody.
