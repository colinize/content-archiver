[00:00] Shout to the heart and your two blades, darling, you give love a bad name.

[00:19] Aw, welcome everybody, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast, one more show to go and then I'm taking the family to Disney,

[00:25] so there's not going to be any more shows this week other than this one, so, Canada, you better make it a good show.

[00:32] We're going to talk about Jaws, we're going to talk about how Stern Pinball is going to get the gang together Monday night and show us this game with Jack Danger.

[00:40] I think after that stream, all of the Ellie's are going to be spoken for, even if the shark doesn't eat the freaking ball, people.

[00:49] We're going to talk about Jersey Jack Pinball, when are they going to learn their lesson and just finish this damn code in all these games and turn a corner?

[01:00] We're going to talk about a quarter million dollar pinball collection that went up for sale, we're going to talk about how that went down and what that means and how each and every one of us has to juggle things we own and real adult investments with toys that we buy

[01:17] and what life means, this short little time we have on this planet and let's talk a little bit about what's going on in the pinball industry around the horn, how does that sound and maybe I'll do my Canada's collectors corner at the end as a special treat.

[01:32] Let's look at what's for sale in the world of pinball for $13,000 or more and ask ourselves, do we think this is worth it? Is this a game I would buy at that price?

[01:43] But before we do that, I want to give a few shout outs to people who have raised the roof.

[01:48] These gentlemen have raised their pledges, so thank you so much.

[01:52] Hector did it way back in January. I don't think I thanked Hector. He went all the way up to MX 100. I don't know what that means.

[02:00] Mexican $100, $100 pesos. I don't know Hector, thank you so much.

[02:05] I want to thank Bev from going from $5 to $10 and Darren W just went from $10 to $15.

[02:12] So thank you gentlemen for raising the roof and if you raise the roof people and you like what you hear, you will get a shout out.

[02:19] Alright, so let's start with Jaws real quick. So there's been so much debate back and forth about this game.

[02:25] I talked to Darren. He played the game at CES. He said he really, really liked it. He played it a lot.

[02:32] I've talked to other people that played the game and the game shoots just fine. It's a Keith Elwyn game.

[02:38] The upper play field they said is fun. The game is a lot of fun to flip. We knew it would be fun to flip and I think this game's got 2 out of 3, right?

[02:47] It's like a meatloaf song. 2 out of 3 ain't bad. It's got an iconic theme with all of the assets.

[02:54] It's got a great layout, but it doesn't have great toys. It's never going to have great toys.

[03:02] I don't care if people try to make a shark that eats the ball. It's not going to work.

[03:07] I don't care if you glue on a bunch of plastic figurines. People are going to mod this thing and tack on so much tacky stuff into the game,

[03:15] but it's never going to be one of Stern Pinball's most impressive mechanical games.

[03:21] It's never going to be one of Keith Elwyn's games in which the toys are really exciting and create a wow moment,

[03:27] but I think what we're going to see Monday night is this. This design team and the code working on JAWS,

[03:33] what they are really, really good at is creating an atmosphere with the game. The code is 0.79. It's not done.

[03:44] And I think when JAWS and everything is said and done on this game, I do think they are going to be very successful

[03:52] in creating an atmosphere around this game and around this title that is going to be a very, very, very rewarding pinball experience.

[04:04] Now, does that mean the LEDs are going to go up in value? I still don't think so. I think $13,000

[04:13] is like more than anybody wants to spend on any pinball machine, let alone a Stern Pinball machine without many toys in it.

[04:22] And that's the thing, right? And now I'm starting to see people act like premiums are the new LEDs.

[04:27] Like, I got to get in on the first run of premiums. And everybody, why?

[04:32] Why do you need premium run number one when the code is not even nearly done

[04:38] and they're going to make this game for five freaking years?

[04:41] And if you just wait a little bit, you know, you're going to be able to get used premiums in six months for much less money.

[04:49] So just don't be impatient. Do you need it right now?

[04:54] So many of you can walk into your game room and see like 15 great titles. You don't need another one right now.

[05:02] I think Jaws LE is obviously the nicest looking of the packages, but I just don't see it as a game that's ever going to be that hard to get.

[05:10] It's still available for sale. It's not sold out. And have we ever seen a Keith L.W. in LE not sell out?

[05:17] Like James Bond LE sold out faster than Jaws. So did Foo Fighters and all of those games were $13,000.

[05:24] And I think that just goes to show where the market is at. And I want to congratulate each and every one of you

[05:30] who's just kind of waiting it out and seeing how this plays out.

[05:34] All right. So I think Monday night when Jack Danger streams it with the team,

[05:38] a lot of people are going to turn a corner and get more excited about the game.

[05:42] We will get over our anger of lack of mechs and stern ripping us off once again with these stupid prices.

[05:49] Don't mistake me, people. I think all of these prices right now are inane and asinine and stupid.

[05:56] We are not getting our money's worth for $13,000. And all you have to do is look at the used market

[06:04] and everybody is getting hosed when they try to trade in any pinball machine they bought over the last two years,

[06:10] whether it's Stern, Jersey Jack, American Pinball.

[06:13] I mean, someone just went to sell their galactic tank force like the Deluxe Edition.

[06:18] That was like a $9,000 game or a $9,500 game. And now it's $7,000.

[06:25] $7,000. Which means that $17,000 signature edition is freaking $10,000 more for the same exact game.

[06:36] The same experience. I mean, come on. We can't put this much value on like tank treads and like

[06:42] foiled sticker decals on the armor and powder coat does not cost that much money.

[06:48] All right. So speaking of money, $250,000.

[06:53] Troy over at Tilt Amusements scored a huge, huge, huge, huge deal.

[06:59] There was a gentleman on pinside that asked a question. He had 31 pinball machines and he asked everybody,

[07:05] should I sell these individually or should I sell them as a package deal? In which way will I make more money?

[07:12] Now, obviously, if you sell each game individually, you will make a lot more money than if you sell it as a package deal.

[07:20] But it turns out that this gentleman needed some money for a venture he was interested in.

[07:26] And so I think he made the right move. If you need a quarter million dollars and you need it right away to invest in something,

[07:34] you might as well take a deal that Troy offered because if you try to sell each of these games individually,

[07:40] you know how the market is right now. It could take you like a year to find buyers for every game.

[07:46] And so look, 31 games, $250,000. Crazy, right? Crazy seeing that much money trade hands.

[07:55] Also even crazier that you would publicize it with YouTube videos and sharing it all across pinball media because the IRS

[08:04] will probably want some of that quarter million dollar deal because anything over $600,

[08:12] they have their finger on. And so I don't know if they're going to come after this deal. And Troy gave an interesting thing.

[08:18] He said, look, when I do a deal like this, I want to make 20% back on my investment. Now, that's not a bad investment, right?

[08:26] In S&P 500 fund, you're looking at about 10% return is a good return. And over the years, like a pinball investment has outpaced the markets.

[08:36] Like how many of you out there got way more than 10 to 20% returns on your stern machines when you bought LEs at the right prices?

[08:44] So will Troy get his 20%? You know, we're about to see 31 really nice games hit the market. Some of them have already sold.

[08:51] There were games like Big Bang Bar. There was like a Deadpool LE. There's a lot of nice games in that collection.

[08:58] There's an Indiana Jones, I believe with like Leor mods. Like a lot of stuff is in there. So super exciting.

[09:04] I shared the video of that deal on my Facebook page. If you haven't seen it, go check it out. And I know this opens up the debate.

[09:11] Are we silly for investing this much money in pinball machines? And each and every one of us, our financial situations are different.

[09:19] I have much more money in savings and in my portfolio than I do in pinball machines. You know, it's crazy. I don't even have a lot of stuff.

[09:27] Like I don't have a lot of games or pinball machines, but I still have a lot of money tied up in things. For example, I've got over $100,000 tied up in a single car.

[09:38] That's what the Dodge Demon would go for. Okay. A car I basically drive two times a month. And you know what I hate about like car people?

[09:46] Is they always justify like, oh, the investment in the car much like pinheads. But I'll tell you this, if I had put $86,000, which is what I bought my demon for.

[09:56] If I had put $86,000 in an S&P fund five years ago when I got the car, I would have much more money in that fund than I would have in the car itself.

[10:07] But what I wouldn't have is this. Memories, experiences, all the thrills of having that Dodge Demon. And the same is true with pinball.

[10:17] The reason you have money in it is every day you get to wake up and it makes you happy. It gives you an experience. It's fun. It's joy in your life.

[10:26] And just owning stocks. Man, that doesn't really make you happy. Of course, people are happy when they make money, but there's no journey there.

[10:34] There's no experience. It's not like you created a company and you sold it and then you made money and you have all those memories of the company you created.

[10:42] That would be different. But when you just buy stocks or invest in a portfolio or gold or a 401k, how many of you out there have any memories associated with any of that?

[10:54] You just don't. Now look, the key to life and the key to happiness is balance. So you should have a balance investment portfolio.

[11:01] And yes, your pinball machines are an investment. When I meet with my financial advisor, she asked me, how much is your car worth? How much are your arcade machines worth?

[11:11] So if I think about how much my arcade machines are worth right now, I've got a Guns N' Roses CE Newn box. It's about $12,500.

[11:19] Now that thing used to be worth like $20,000. Now it's worth about $12,500. I got a Batman SLE easily worth $30,000 on the current market.

[11:28] Just there alone, $42,000. And then I've got a few Neo Geo cabinets that are worth about $10,000 each. I've got three of them.

[11:39] So that's another $30,000, $72,000 in coin-up devices. And I don't even play any of them right now. It's kind of crazy, but I will when I get a house.

[11:50] I can't wait to set them all up. And that's a tiny, tiny collection. I think a lot of you out there would be shocked if you went down your row and you sort of calculated how much your collection is worth.

[12:03] And yeah, go look at McDonald's stock, everybody. We all should have bought McDonald's stock 10 years ago. Then you could have had your pinball collection, a Lamborghini or two, and a bunch of Rolexes in the top drawer.

[12:17] Alright, so what else is going on in the world of pinball? I said, is Jersey Jack pinball gonna learn a lesson?

[12:23] And once again, I was on pinside this morning and that damn Panzer freak thread. I mean, I'm glad he started it.

[12:31] Where is the JJP code? When is Jersey Jack pinball gonna finish the code on games? How many times do we have to ask this question? When will Jersey Jack pinball go back and revisit guns and roses?

[12:45] When will they finish pirate to the Caribbean? And I'm seeing more and more people say, I'm done with Jersey Jack until they show us they're gonna finish the code in their games.

[12:57] And I just don't understand. It is like January of 2024. What have they been doing? Like, why can't they hire a few more software people to go through all of the feedback they've been getting?

[13:11] And the fans of these games have been giving them so much great feedback, but you shouldn't even need to rely on the fans. They should simply want to finish the games they started and they don't.

[13:24] And I think there is a growing descent with Jersey Jack pinball that continues to be a dark cloud over this company. And if I had one wish for Jersey Jack, just finish these games.

[13:37] Just finish pirates, finish guns and roses. What is taking so long? Toy Story could use a little mini wizard motor too. Why can't you go back and put extra polish on the games?

[13:50] And your main competitor, Stern Pinball, all they ever do is continue to work on their games until they make them perfect.

[13:59] So if I'm buying into a pinball brand and a pinball company, I feel way better about supporting Stern and buying a Stern because I know they're not gonna leave me with an unfinished product.

[14:10] I know they're not gonna leave us with like an imbalanced rule set. I know they're not gonna stop before the job is done.

[14:17] And they're not gonna stop on James Bond. They didn't stop on Batman. They're not gonna stop on Jaws. But Jersey Jack is the complete opposite. They stop.

[14:25] This is one of the reasons why people leave Jersey Jack in the rear view mirror.

[14:29] Now you want to talk about losing money on games, ladies and gentlemen. One year ago in March, Godfather came out. A collector's edition was $15,000.

[14:39] You know what one is listed for right now on the marketplace and it didn't even sell? $10,000. So you just lost $5,000 on a Godfather collector's edition.

[14:53] I don't know what to tell you. Bye, bye, bye as a mentality has screwed over so many people over the last two years.

[15:01] How can anybody run at these games new and box seeing this stuff?

[15:05] Foo Fighters has lost almost $4,000, Ellie. James Bond Ellie is another one. Over $3,000 in losses. Godfather, $5,000.

[15:14] I mean, if the game is great, you're gonna lose $3,000. If the game is mediocre, you're gonna lose $5,000. What happened to Pinball?

[15:23] In the 10 years I've been covering this hobby, you can't name one Stern Ellie that came out since 2004 that has lost anywhere near $3,000 to $5,000.

[15:34] You can't even name one Led Zeppelin didn't lose that much. Mustang didn't lose. Mustang went up now. Heck, even WWE did not lose that much money.

[15:44] And if there isn't any greater sign that this hobby is so overpriced right now, which company is gonna learn their lesson and lower prices?

[15:54] Something's gotta give because it's just not sustainable. There are no way people are gonna absorb these losses for much longer.

[16:02] Alright, everybody. What else is going on in Pinball? Let's go to Canadian's collector's corner for you before I head to Disney.

[16:08] Now, speaking of prices, I put in games that are over $13,000 and let's just read out what people are asking for stuff.

[16:15] A Pirates of the Caribbean Ellie for $19,975. No, thank you. I'm not going anywhere near Pirates of the Caribbean until they finish the code.

[16:26] I also think the hype on Pirates is dead. I think everyone with one listed right now is listing it for about $4,000 to $5,000 more than people want to spend on it.

[16:38] I'm not seeing any of these games sell for the current asking prices. We got a Godzilla Ellie for $16,000. Nope, I wouldn't do that.

[16:47] That game's gonna slide back down to around $13,000 real soon. Here's one. Elvira House of Horrors 40th Anniversary Edition in a box.

[16:55] For $16,500. Wow. Wow. Remember when these games were selling for $25,000? That's an $8,500 loss if you bought this game for $25,000.

[17:08] And because of the Blood Kiss Edition, it's like, I don't know, the nicer edition is out, but there are only 199 40th anniversary editions.

[17:17] I kind of like the 40th even more than the Blood Kiss. I like having more color on the game, but, but there's a big but.

[17:25] Stern put a lot of sparkle even on the play field with the Blood Kiss Edition. I hear from people that it's actually much more stunning than the 40th.

[17:34] So I think Elvira has become this weird game where like there's so many variations now, nobody knows what to expect.

[17:40] So here's what's crazy. There is a restored Indiana Jones for $16,755, right? And then right below it, a collector's quality Indiana Jones for $25,000.

[17:53] Would you spend $25,000 on an Indiana Jones game? That is crazy. No way. No way is it worth that. There's just too many out there.

[18:03] If you're going to spend $25,000, it has to be on a game where there's like a limited amount because you could take any Indiana Jones and turn it into a collector's quality game.

[18:16] And so I just saw like someone is selling an Indiana Jones new old stock play field for over $5,000 for just the play field because it's been clear coded by Cruzman.

[18:27] And I get it. He does amazing work, but over $5,000 just for the play field. That's insanity. Here's a Star Wars LE for $13,300.

[18:38] No, that game is a dud. I wouldn't go near Star Wars. Another medieval madness for $21,000. The Royal Edition. I wouldn't go anywhere near that.

[18:48] With all these Valley Williams remakes coming people, we don't know. We don't know if it's going to be Twilight Zone or Indiana Jones.

[18:54] I kind of would just hit pause right now. Now, what I do know is this. Padrety Gaming is never going to make a game as nice as CGC.

[19:02] My prediction is this. All the CGC remakes are going to go up in value because once these Padrety games come out and the quality is not there, I think it's going to be weird, right?

[19:13] We're going to have two different companies making Valley Williams remakes, but the one everybody's going to want are going to be the CGC games.

[19:20] And if CGC doesn't make any more Valley Williams games, those original ones they did are going to go way up in value.

[19:26] Alright, here's someone smoking a crack pipe, a Godfather CE for $15,000. I mean, this guy is legitimately selling this game for $5,000 more than another Godfather CE is being sold for.

[19:41] We got a few big Lebowski's around $15,000. I don't know why anyone would pay over for a big Lebowski. You can still order one today.

[19:49] So why would you spend $15,000 when you could spend $13,000 and just get it when it's made? I just would not spend over on this game.

[19:58] Here's another Elvira House of Horrors for $15,000. I still feel so bad for these guys. These guys all are getting hosed.

[20:06] Like this game again used to be easily like $18,000 to $20,000. Here's a Supreme for $60,000. I mean, come on.

[20:15] The only person that's going to buy a Supreme for $60,000 is some crazy rich like Supreme collector. I don't know. I feel like even the market on that kind of stuff is starting to cool down a little bit.

[20:27] I'm looking to see if there's anything else interesting here. Here's one that's interesting. New in box. A Rick and Morty Bloodsucker Edition.

[20:35] Brand new butter cabinet. Wow. Like somebody bought a Rick and Morty with a butter cabinet and never opened it up.

[20:44] That's crazy. Now look, the price is also crazy. I think I spent on my Rick and Morty with butter cabinet. I think it was around like $9,500.

[20:53] This person wants $15,000 for a spooky pinball machine. I do think you need to have your head examined. If you buy a Rick and Morty for $15,000, here's another Elvira House of Horrors for $22,000.

[21:09] I mean, again, like how is somebody selling in Elvira for $22,000 when we can go up the page and see one for $6,000 less?

[21:17] Another Elvira new in box for $19,500. Another Elvira signature edition for $19,500.

[21:25] See, George Gomez needs to go here and realize what he did. Every single Elvira that's listed for sale, Stern Pinball is the reason why these guys are cutting bait on these games.

[21:37] They screwed over all of these gentlemen. Everybody who's selling their Elvira, their signature edition, their 40th, they all lost about $5,000 to $8,000, maybe $10,000 in value because Stern made a nicer version for $13,000.

[21:55] I mean, come on, George. I love you, Mr. Gomez, but don't act confused as to why people are pissed off about what you did.

[22:02] And not only that, people don't even want these games now because the nicer version is the cheapest version of the LE.

[22:10] Here's a Pirate to the Caribbean CE for $32,500. All right, let me just say this for a minute. All of you Pirate to the Caribbean people, COVID is over.

[22:19] COVID only exists in the world of people who own Pirate to the Caribbean. This game is not worth $32,500 anymore.

[22:27] That ship has sailed two years ago. I have not seen a Pirate to the Caribbean sell for anywhere north of $30,000 anytime in the last year.

[22:38] I know that you want to stick to your guns, but here's the other part. We know you bought your game for $12,500. You're not going to make a $20,000 profit on the game anymore.

[22:50] And you know what's interesting is this. We all now know that Jersey Jack is never going to make this game again, and that hasn't sent the price north.

[22:59] And the reason why is this. This is one of the most overhyped games of all time. Yes, it's beautiful. Yes, it's deep, but it doesn't have assets from the movie.

[23:09] It's such a mixed bag game that has only heralded it because it's rare. That's it. When this game was readily available, nobody really wanted it.

[23:18] And maybe the same is going to happen to Elton John. Who knows? But again, I just don't think this game speaks to people, especially if you love Pirates to the Caribbean.

[23:29] Do I have to remind everybody there's no Jack Sparrow in this game. There's no triple spinning disc. Everything that made that game exciting when they revealed it was yanked out of the game.

[23:39] And look, another Pirate CE 2675 Firm.

[23:44] Alright, so let's just look at this again, people. So you have someone who's selling one for $3025, and then right below it, there's one for like $26,000.

[23:52] Okay, so what world are these people living in where you're trying to sell the same exact game for $6,000 more than someone who's selling the same exact game as you?

[24:05] $6,000 more? You could get a freaking Stern Pro. It's like, I don't understand this. Do people not want to sell their machines? Are they not motivated buyers?

[24:14] I mean, look at this. There's another Elvira 40th. Are you waiting for it? For $14,000. $14,000. That's an $11,000 loss if you bought it for $25,000.

[24:26] Look, I could go on and on and on with this, but I'm not. I think we're all seeing the writing on the wall.

[24:32] New and box games are losing more value than they've ever lost before. There's a lot of delusional sellers out there who think COVID is still going on.

[24:40] And I think it's the greatest time to wait and see people because if you knew what I knew, that's going to be in back to the future.

[24:47] Going to be in the matrix. Going to be in games that come out this year.

[24:51] Don't waste your time throwing money at these overpriced used games. The future of pinball is going to be really interesting at these prices.

[25:02] These companies are going to have to release masterpieces. And if they don't, that's good news for each and every one of us.

[25:09] Because then we can march in and let the initial buyer take the $3,000 to $5,000 hit on the game.

[25:15] And then you could own that Godfather. I mean, my poor friend Derek, I told him not to buy Godfather LE.

[25:22] He paid $12,000 plus $600 in shipping. And now the CE is worth $10,000. He just lost $5,000 on his game.

[25:33] That's a first class plane ticket to New York. That's eating at Michelin star restaurants every night.

[25:39] That's an experience you'll never forget. Godfather pinball does not create an experience that is worth losing $3,000 to $5,000 in a year.

[25:48] We're all waking up people.

[25:50] Canadian pinball podcast has been saying, wait and see. And if you took my advice, what has happened, you're going to come out on top.

[25:58] If you buy, buy, buy everything, what's going to happen? You're going to regret it because you're going to lose so much money. And that's not fun.

[26:05] You know, it's fun going in now and saving $5,000 if you're a huge Godfather fan. Like you could have saved $5,000.

[26:14] And you didn't even have to wait a year. That's the great part, right? These things are dropping like lead balloons instantly.

[26:21] Like instantly, the moment we see Elton John's for sale, they're not going to be selling for at MSRP or even close. They're going to be $2,000.

[26:29] Knock it off. That cardboard box at JJP is worth $2,000 to $3,000. I can't wait to see it. Everybody, no shows for a week.

[26:37] I hope you enjoyed this show. I had a lot of energy. I had a lot of excitement doing it. And we will be back.

[26:43] I'm going to be in Disney with Killian and Brenda this Monday through Friday. And I don't want to be making podcasts.

[26:52] I want to be very present and enjoy the experience with my family. So I hope you stick around and don't cancel your subscription.

[26:59] We're going to be back with a lot of shows. I might do a few Facebook lives to talk about the Stern stream and stuff like that.

[27:06] But no podcast for a week because I'm not lugging this equipment down to Florida.

[27:11] Everybody, thank you for being a club member. We'll talk to you soon. Take it away, John Bond, Joby.
