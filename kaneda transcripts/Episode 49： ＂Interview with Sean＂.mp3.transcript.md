[00:00] There are literally hundreds of types of cranes, rigging, and equipment in the construction industry.

[00:06] But there are some basic common safety rules that apply to all types of equipment.

[00:11] That's what this program is all about.

[00:14] Episode 49 of Canada's Pinball Podcasts.

[00:24] The only pinball podcast out there that just gets right to it.

[00:28] My God, I've been listening to the other pinball podcast the last few weeks.

[00:31] And then rambling and rambling and rambling.

[00:34] Just talk, talk pinball, get to it.

[00:36] So before we jump into what this whole podcast is about,

[00:39] it's an interview with Sean McDermott from All Castle Games.

[00:42] You might remember Sean, we talked to him a few months ago.

[00:45] He's an operator at a Wisconsin.

[00:47] Him and I are just going to talk about a lot of the different subjects

[00:50] that have been percolating through pinside and within the community.

[00:55] But before I do that, I just want to talk about one quick topic before we roll the tape.

[00:59] And that is the Batman Crane Toy.

[01:01] The amount of back and forth that people are having over this crane toy,

[01:06] I think is absolutely ridiculous.

[01:08] And here's my take on the whole thing.

[01:10] Batman The Dark Knight wasn't a great game.

[01:14] All right.

[01:15] No one ever said that this crane toy was one of the best toys or mechs

[01:18] that's thrown it ever created.

[01:20] So the fact that it's getting carried over into Batman 66,

[01:24] it doesn't super excite me.

[01:26] And I think people are right when they say a crane has no real business

[01:31] being in a Batman game.

[01:32] It has nothing to do with the theme of Batman.

[01:35] And I get it.

[01:36] The scarecrow is Dr. Crane.

[01:39] And that's why he's controlling the crane in Batman Dark Knight.

[01:44] But it even makes it more confusing.

[01:46] Why is the penguin now controlling a crane in Batman 66?

[01:52] There wasn't even a scarecrow in Batman 66.

[01:56] So I don't know.

[01:57] The whole thing is just a little marketing spin.

[02:01] And it's just a little weird.

[02:03] If Stern's going to redesign the game completely,

[02:06] why leave the left half of the design intact?

[02:10] So I don't know.

[02:11] We'll see.

[02:12] I still think it's going to be fun.

[02:14] I think it's a great theme.

[02:16] But I think people need to stop claiming like the crane mechanism

[02:19] is the most amazing mechs Stern's ever done.

[02:21] And Batman 66 is going to blow people away.

[02:23] Like no other pin.

[02:24] So premature to be making those bold statements.

[02:27] All right.

[02:27] Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen,

[02:30] Sean and I are going to shoot this shit.

[02:31] Here we go.

[02:33] So ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce

[02:35] back to Canadian pinball podcast.

[02:37] Sean McDermott, operator of all castle games.

[02:41] Sean, welcome back to Canadian pinball podcast.

[02:44] Woo, it's great to be back.

[02:46] All right.

[02:47] Good.

[02:47] Good.

[02:48] I, and we're just going to do a little sort of covering

[02:52] off of what's been going on in pinball.

[02:54] Now for you, friendly listener, you get to hear two people go

[02:57] back and forth on topics.

[02:58] There's not just Canada ranting and raving today.

[03:00] So Sean, welcome.

[03:03] We know we love you when you rand rave.

[03:05] All right.

[03:05] You know that they do pretty decently those those

[03:08] a pinside baby podcast that I do.

[03:11] I could do it every week with the amount of bitching

[03:14] and moaning that's been going on.

[03:15] We're going to cover off on some of those topics that have a

[03:17] lot of people severely but hurt.

[03:20] Well, let's start, let's start right there.

[03:22] So Sean, we're not going to talk too much about like what you

[03:24] have going on with your operations.

[03:26] I know you have a Ghostbusters Pro.

[03:27] We're going to talk a little bit later on about ghosting

[03:30] and if we think Stern's turned the corner on this.

[03:33] But let's start on the hot topic right now, which is Batman 66.

[03:37] What are your thoughts on Batman 66 when you saw the news?

[03:42] When I first saw the news or what I listen to the podcast with

[03:45] Nate Schivers and I listen to Gomez.

[03:48] So my opinion did change if I listen to that.

[03:51] My first impression was they were just going to risk in Batman

[03:54] the dark night from what I understood.

[03:57] But after listening to Gomez and that other Jody guy speak,

[04:01] I do believe it is probably a new game.

[04:04] Is it something that we're going to buy for the route?

[04:07] Probably not.

[04:08] Right.

[04:09] It's too expensive.

[04:10] So just for you guys who didn't listen to Costa Coast Pimball,

[04:15] let me just go down the list of what Gomez covered off on.

[04:18] So the Crane Toy, which I swear to God, I've heard more

[04:22] discussions about this damn Crane Toy being like the greatest toy

[04:25] in Pimball history all of a sudden now that people have to have it in a game

[04:29] they really want.

[04:30] It's a neat toy, but let's we can all universally agree that the Batman

[04:34] dark night, the game itself, isn't really heralded as a great game at all.

[04:41] So but the Crane Toy is going to be driven by the penguin in this game.

[04:45] And he's going to be wreaking havoc on Gotham.

[04:48] Now there has been so much discussion as to why there's even a Crane

[04:51] Toy in Batman and some people are so idiotic.

[04:55] It's because the scarecrows last name is Crane.

[04:59] He's Dr. Crane.

[05:00] It's it's a wall.

[05:01] That's why it's a little weird, right?

[05:03] I mean, it's not it's not like it was in the movie and it's a little bit of a

[05:07] literal take on the character.

[05:10] Doesn't really make sense that the penguin is now operating.

[05:13] Dr. Crane's Crane, but that's what it's going to be in the new game.

[05:19] Yeah, I never really to be honest, I didn't watch the old old Batman very much.

[05:23] I'm not that old.

[05:26] You know, the reason we're not interested in as an operator is because it's kind of an old title.

[05:32] You know, versus if it was like Batman, the dark night, which we used to have.

[05:38] We don't have anymore.

[05:40] When we had it, it was it was an okay game for its price.

[05:43] I mean, it was a decently priced game.

[05:45] Right.

[05:47] You know, it kind of, you know, there was another game with the crane.

[05:49] I think it was last action hero, I believe.

[05:51] I think that one had a crane and it didn't work for nothing.

[05:54] I think if I remember it, it was always broken.

[05:57] So it kind of gave me, you know, second thoughts about buying a game with the crane on it.

[06:02] But it's a it's a neat toy.

[06:05] I mean, I was playing it today at Sunshine Longer Madden.

[06:07] When the crane swung out, there was a birthday party going on and all these kids got all excited watching it.

[06:12] And anything that moves across the play field like that, I think is, it's neat.

[06:16] It's not like the greatest thing ever.

[06:19] So let me just, I'll go down the list real quick of what else is going to happen in the game.

[06:23] So the crane's going to stay in the same place.

[06:26] There's going to be a left and right ramp that cross each other.

[06:30] So I don't know if that's sort of like fish taili or sort of like hoppy kind of looking ramp.

[06:35] Lots of the same elements on the right side as Batman, dark night.

[06:40] The left hand side has been redesigned.

[06:43] Completely new feature on the left side of the game that provides three distinct interactive modes for the player.

[06:49] And also acts as an additional ball lock.

[06:52] He says there's way more shots than Batman, dark night.

[06:56] And it's not so much stopping go.

[06:59] There's an LCD screen approximately the size of a medium laptop, about 15 and a half inches diagonal.

[07:06] So that's cool.

[07:08] The most thing I'm interested in is to see what they're going to do with the flat screen displays.

[07:14] Now they said something they're going to do with the play field LCD.

[07:19] They're going to do something special.

[07:21] Now I'm trying to think of what they could be doing.

[07:24] Ideally, I like to see them do something like highways done where they put it in the play field where it seems to make sense.

[07:29] But if they do a pin to K kind of thing with them, like some sort of hologram or mirror or an OLED thing where you can see through it.

[07:36] Can you see those games that have that?

[07:38] Yep.

[07:39] That might be kind of neat.

[07:40] It does kind of mess the ball a little bit when they do that.

[07:43] I have to imagine the screen is going to be...

[07:46] My guess is sort of where the Joker is in Batman, dark night.

[07:50] Like that area there seems to be...

[07:53] Like a WWE.

[07:55] Yeah, I think it's going to be more just like showing clips from the show and interactive.

[08:00] And remember, we've got Joe, I'm not going to butcher his last name, but the guy who's helping out, he does work on all the Batman slot machines that are out there.

[08:10] So I think a lot of those assets, they're going to try to find unique ways to incorporate them.

[08:15] I think into the LCD that's on the play field.

[08:18] Look, it's all just guessing.

[08:20] A lot of slot machines use clear displays.

[08:22] So they have a display in front of the Reels and stuff.

[08:26] So I mean, I could see something like that where...

[08:28] There's a couple arcade games we can get that have.

[08:31] You can see through the screen and the front of the machine is a touchscreen and it displays stuff.

[08:35] But you can see through it to see the prizes.

[08:37] It'll be a game from adrenaline called Blackout and then a Candy Crush version of it as well.

[08:42] So I mean, if they did something like that and incorporated it, I mean that would be kind of different in need.

[08:47] I don't know if we're going to give them that much credit.

[08:49] They're going to go that far.

[08:50] They're going to stay the safe road and just put it like Circus Voltaire.

[08:54] You know, the back.

[08:55] But I mean, I guess it remains to be seen.

[08:57] We're going to know soon.

[08:58] Right, we're going to know real soon.

[08:59] So it sounds like they're going to...

[09:01] It's definitely going to be playable at Expo.

[09:03] But I hear...

[09:05] We have to see images of this thing in September.

[09:10] Because I know that distributors are going to start making people lock in their deposits and make them non-refundable.

[09:16] And you can't do that until people see the thing.

[09:19] Well, I mean, Start doesn't have to do anything.

[09:22] They can stay over there.

[09:23] They want...

[09:24] They own the market.

[09:25] I mean, it's a similar to like, you know, in the 1980s, late 80s when Nintendo had 190% of the market or something like that.

[09:33] Right. But right now the $2,000 to reserve the LE, the distributors are telling customers that it's refundable right now.

[09:41] But once the game is revealed, it's non-refundable.

[09:46] So you get to make up your mind.

[09:47] Like, here's what it's going to be.

[09:49] I mean, that's how it should be.

[09:50] But you know, because they can't just have people on a whim just reserving these games and then they all bail like at the 11th hour and then stirring them.

[09:58] Yeah, but I think people are going to...

[10:00] They're going to fill the spots.

[10:01] Oh, yeah.

[10:02] I mean...

[10:03] Sold out already.

[10:04] It's crazy.

[10:05] It's crazy.

[10:06] It's crazy.

[10:07] Let's talk about that.

[10:08] Let's talk about that.

[10:09] This game is sold out.

[10:10] No one has even seen it.

[10:12] And people already...

[10:15] And we're talking this is the first time ever, Sternons asked for $2,000 deposit without showing you anything.

[10:24] So the 240 LEs are sold out.

[10:27] The 30 super LEs that Gary's going to give to his friends.

[10:32] Those aren't even for sale.

[10:33] You have to be invited to get those.

[10:35] So that butt hurt a bunch of people.

[10:37] I kind of think Gary is...

[10:40] He's celebrating his own company.

[10:41] 30 years doing it.

[10:42] I...

[10:43] God bless him.

[10:44] Why not?

[10:45] Why not make 30 for your closest friends and families.

[10:47] And have a little problem with the 30 year thing because Stern pinball is not 30 years old.

[10:52] Well, it's what Daddy East and...

[10:54] Daddy East and Sega and each of those lost...

[10:56] You know, they had to sell the division each time.

[10:58] So I mean...

[10:59] Failure.

[11:00] A bound.

[11:01] And it wasn't because...

[11:02] I mean, it was kind of their parent companies that failed.

[11:04] I think if I remember correctly, it wasn't really the pinball...

[11:07] It wasn't pinball's fault for say, you know, this really no way to know for sure.

[11:12] And they kind of...

[11:13] When Sega inherited it from Daddy East.

[11:15] Sorry.

[11:16] I mean...

[11:17] But it's still like...

[11:18] 30 years of Stern, not really.

[11:20] I guess it's the same guy.

[11:21] Technically.

[11:22] Yeah, right.

[11:23] It's 30 years of Gary doing this thing.

[11:25] And he is Stern pinball.

[11:26] So I'll give him that.

[11:28] I think 99...

[11:29] I'll give him that.

[11:30] 99.9% of the world doesn't really care that it's not legitimate anniversary.

[11:35] So, look, this game is...

[11:37] It's going to be interesting, you know, because it's coming out.

[11:40] So soon, you know, it's amazing...

[11:42] I was talking about this in the last podcast.

[11:44] There's been so many issues with Ghostbusters.

[11:46] Let's talk about that for a little bit, because...

[11:48] Yeah.

[11:49] So many people were saying,

[11:50] I'm not going to buy the next Stern pinball machine until they fixed their shit.

[11:54] And here we go.

[11:56] They don't...

[11:57] They don't even confirm they've fixed anything yet.

[12:00] Although I know for a fact that they have.

[12:03] Like, the fix is in.

[12:04] Like, the new game's shipping now with August 24th Playfields.

[12:08] They all are the beautiful and perfect.

[12:12] Like, there's no ghosting, there's no ship clear coat.

[12:15] The premiums are all going to have perfect playfields.

[12:18] But Sean, you have a pro that was built months ago.

[12:21] Do you have any issues with ghosting on it?

[12:24] Not yet.

[12:25] I mean, it's...

[12:27] You know, it's been on the location for three weeks.

[12:31] I've been really, really nitpicking it and just, you know, with a magnifying glass.

[12:35] Not really, but almost.

[12:38] But one thing with this whole ghosting thing is, like, I've been buying pinball machines for a while.

[12:43] And I've never had a problem with Stern where they've never...

[12:48] They never lived up to what they said they were going to do.

[12:51] Even after the war, he's expired.

[12:53] Even on games like Avengers that were dogs.

[12:56] And they've always sent us parts.

[12:58] I mean, expensive parts.

[13:00] Long after I warned, he was up.

[13:03] And I don't have any confidence issues with them.

[13:06] I can see where people that are, you know, buying pins for the first time.

[13:10] Or there can be...

[13:11] They've been doing this for a couple of years or something.

[13:13] And they're buying this $8,000 machine.

[13:15] It's got these problems.

[13:16] And they're like, oh my God, what am I going to do?

[13:18] Because they're used to every other company in the world being a bunch of aoles.

[13:21] And, you know, I think they'll make it right.

[13:24] I don't think it's going to be an issue.

[13:26] I wouldn't worry.

[13:27] Right.

[13:28] Well, you know, it's...

[13:29] It sucks.

[13:30] Well, I see...

[13:31] What's interesting is...

[13:32] I heard a rumor.

[13:33] I heard a rumor now only.

[13:35] Because we're up here in Wisconsin.

[13:37] And I heard a rumor that a company up here was doing the play fields for them for a little bit.

[13:45] And they were trying to...

[13:46] They were switching from someone else to them.

[13:48] And I think that's where this mess came about.

[13:51] And then they went back to the old people.

[13:53] But that's only a rumor, you know.

[13:55] Well...

[13:56] My rumor...

[13:57] I had a rumor too.

[13:59] And what I heard...

[14:01] And from a pretty reliable source was that...

[14:05] Stern gets its play fields made by Churchill.

[14:08] And that Churchill had people quit.

[14:12] And with those people, a lot of the expertise went with them.

[14:17] And so all of a sudden, Stern started getting...

[14:20] Play fields that weren't the quality that they... they expect.

[14:23] And so it's been a process of getting...

[14:26] That process at their vendor back where it needs to be.

[14:30] And that's why I kind of feel back for them.

[14:32] Because it's not their...

[14:34] Making this issue, right?

[14:36] It's a vendor's product.

[14:38] And I know Stern is also trying to ramp up their own internal play field,

[14:42] manufacturing capabilities.

[14:44] But that has yet to sort of transpire.

[14:47] So we'll see.

[14:48] But look, the problems fixed right now,

[14:50] and it couldn't be better timing.

[14:52] Because the premiums are really where the line share I think of Ghostbusters orders

[14:55] are going to be.

[14:57] And there's no way they could send premiums out if this issue is still persistent.

[15:01] I think where there is going to be issues moving forward or a couple things.

[15:05] One is, they've never really come out and said what the program is.

[15:08] So I'm still waiting to hear what the program is to help fix people's issues.

[15:13] I saw something where they're going to send a box.

[15:17] Yeah, but they've never come out like an officially said it.

[15:20] Like they've told customers, or some distributors here and there.

[15:23] Yeah, they're going to, if you qualify, right?

[15:27] And I think there's going to be a big sort of issue.

[15:31] Who qualifies and who doesn't for a new fully populated play field?

[15:35] If you qualify for it, like you have chipped clear code and it's really bad shape,

[15:39] they will send you a box, you send the play field back to them,

[15:42] and they will repopulate, they will take the pieces off of your play field

[15:45] and put it onto a new play field and send it back to you.

[15:48] So I think that there's going to be cases where people are going to clearly qualify for that.

[15:56] But I also think you're going to get a lot of people who have ghosting going on and no chips

[16:01] that are going to really want a new one because it's driving them crazy.

[16:06] And I don't know how they're going to handle that.

[16:08] I think those people are going to, you know, I was telling someone I know over at Stern.

[16:12] I'm like, hey, I think people are going to start taking like screwdriver

[16:16] to their play field and tapping a little chips off just so they can get new ones.

[16:20] We'll see. I don't know.

[16:22] This whole collecting thing is a new, it's a brave new world in it.

[16:26] I'm not used to, you know, I mean, back in the day,

[16:28] Bally had issues with play fields too and they just sent you a sheet of mylar in the bottom

[16:32] if you remember.

[16:34] Sure, sure, sure, sure, he jacked just send people stickers.

[16:38] When Wizard of Oz was like wearing out in areas,

[16:42] he just sent people stickers to put over it.

[16:44] I mean, that was what people did.

[16:46] So look, I think Stern is going to have the fix in place and I think you're still going to see people moaning and groaning.

[16:54] But like the reality is the amount of people who are experiencing problems is my new compared to

[17:04] the thousands of games they're going to sell of Ghostbusters, premiums,

[17:08] and the thousands of Batman's are going to sell and Star Wars that comes out after.

[17:12] They're just going to keep selling.

[17:14] Well, like I told you earlier before the podcast that we have a game of Thrones pro

[17:20] and it has Ghosty not in it, tiny bed, I mean,

[17:24] like two millimeters or something around the edges of all the shield targets.

[17:30] And you know, I probably noticed it when we first got it,

[17:34] I just didn't think anything of it.

[17:36] Just like, oh, Stern pinballing on the...

[17:38] But now that everyone's been like, oh my god, there's Ghosty.

[17:42] And so we reported it to him and they've set us some pictures.

[17:46] They didn't get back to me.

[17:48] They said, okay, thanks for the pictures. We're looking into it or something like that.

[17:50] I believe in that. If they did get back to me, I don't...

[17:52] I don't have to look at the email level. I'll just shake on on.

[17:54] If you look at the timeline of when the vendor started having issues

[18:02] and the games that were affected, I mean,

[18:04] it's really game of Thrones, Spider-Man Vault Edition.

[18:08] I think there might have been some Metallicas that were on the line too during that period.

[18:12] And then, and of course, Ghostbusters.

[18:16] So, like, it's a headache for Stern.

[18:18] And it was an unforeseen headache.

[18:20] And I'm not really...

[18:22] I think they could have communicated better than they did.

[18:24] But I also think the pin-side pressure cooker environment

[18:28] where these guys just like pulled their hair out and go apesh it.

[18:32] And don't even give Stern a chance to do anything.

[18:36] It's also just equally as silly.

[18:38] So, you know, I don't...

[18:40] Because you don't know what the percentages are, right?

[18:42] People would put polls on pin-side.

[18:44] And it's like 57% of people are having issues.

[18:47] Bullshit. You know why that's bullshit?

[18:49] Because I voted in those polls with five of my duplicate accounts

[18:53] and put, yeah, I've got issues. I don't even have a fucking machine.

[18:56] You know, it's like...

[18:58] Well, I mean, you look at any other company like McDonald's.

[19:00] You're gonna tell you what percentage of burgers have fecal man right?

[19:02] Either, you know.

[19:03] Right.

[19:04] I mean, it's something that they're not gonna publicize.

[19:06] I mean, they're communicating with the person who has an issue.

[19:08] And that's it.

[19:09] But like, I don't blame them for that.

[19:11] 80% of pin-side poll votes are fake.

[19:14] People who either don't own the game, don't like Stern or just have an agenda.

[19:19] All right. So...

[19:21] Well, pin-side...

[19:22] Pin-side is what? Only less than 3% of the pinball collecting market

[19:25] or something like that.

[19:26] It's really not anything to us.

[19:29] I mean, it affects my business.

[19:31] No.

[19:32] Right.

[19:33] So...

[19:34] Pin-side is like...

[19:35] If you look at...

[19:36] Imagine the pinball collecting community and the pinball hobbyist community.

[19:40] Compared to America, pin-side is like...

[19:44] There's a lot of pissed off people in Rhode Island.

[19:47] And that's it.

[19:48] And everyone else is like really happy in the country.

[19:50] Well, it's a great read. It's enjoying.

[19:52] You know, but I mean, I wouldn't say...

[19:54] I wouldn't use it as like a scientific poll.

[19:56] You know what I mean?

[19:57] I know two pin-siders in town here.

[19:59] I mean, that's it.

[20:00] Right.

[20:01] You know, and there's, you know, 60,000 in the city here.

[20:04] And that's only one small fraction of the route.

[20:07] So, I mean...

[20:08] I'm always surprised when I go to Expos and shows how few people are on pin-side.

[20:15] And when you say pin-side...

[20:16] Because that's always like...

[20:17] I always ask people like...

[20:19] Well, what's your pin-side name?

[20:20] It's almost like when you meet someone who plays Xbox,

[20:22] you're like, well, what's your gamer tag?

[20:23] And you just assume like they're on there, right?

[20:26] And most people are just like, what?

[20:28] What? I'm not on that fucking site.

[20:30] Like, they're like, are you crazy?

[20:32] So, it's not...

[20:35] It's right.

[20:36] It's an interesting read.

[20:37] I mean, we have a lot of little micro-casms of different players in our business.

[20:43] And this is just one of them.

[20:44] I mean, there's a Street Fighter people and the initial D people and the dancing people, the DDR.

[20:50] I mean, they're all just as passionate.

[20:52] And they all...

[20:53] You know, they have their little tips and taffs and whatever you want.

[20:55] You know, fights going on and pin-sides no different.

[20:58] Right, it's just...

[20:59] So, Sean, let me ask you.

[21:00] Out of all the new games coming out, which one...

[21:04] Which one or ones are you most excited about?

[21:07] We have a little bowsky with Hobbe, we've got home pin with Thunderbirds.

[21:12] Well, not Thunderbirds.

[21:14] No offense to the Australian guys.

[21:16] I'm not a fan of that.

[21:17] A bowsky?

[21:18] Yeah.

[21:19] Too expensive.

[21:20] And what is that $10,000 box?

[21:21] $10,000, yeah.

[21:22] For comparison, just so you know,

[21:24] I can buy one of those environmental Jurassic Park games for that price, just for comparison sake.

[21:30] Which one or out-earn it, right?

[21:32] Oh, yeah.

[21:33] We have one of those.

[21:34] Yeah, I said, oh, earns, pinball.

[21:35] All of our pinball machines by itself, you know.

[21:38] So...

[21:39] And I know I got a lot of flack for what...

[21:42] Last time I talked, because we were selling off pins and we didn't have a lot.

[21:45] And just to be for comparison sake, the largest operator in our state is getting rid of all of them.

[21:52] And they were, I mean, we're like a flea and they're like an elephant.

[21:57] And they were down to less than seven last time I talked to them and they're getting rid of those.

[22:02] And just, I don't, they just have this thing where they don't like them, you know.

[22:06] Pinball, you mean?

[22:07] So they're just like going into other areas of amusement other than pinball.

[22:11] It's a non-thing for them.

[22:13] Right.

[22:14] I mean, gambling, jukeboxes and dartboards and stuff.

[22:17] I mean, it makes...

[22:19] It makes sense.

[22:20] I mean, look, if you're an operator and if your goal's money, I mean pick the thing that requires very little maintenance that makes money much quicker.

[22:30] And, you know, it's...

[22:32] No, it can last longer.

[22:34] I don't want to sound like a negative Nancy, you know.

[22:37] I love pinball.

[22:38] We'll always have pinball.

[22:39] And if it makes, maybe if it makes zero, I'll be the one playing it and it'll still be there.

[22:45] But it does affect like, you know, when we're buying equipment, we were selling off some because we knew these LCD monitors were coming.

[22:53] And unfortunately, the first one is this Batman game, which I have no interest in.

[22:57] I'm not saying it's a great theme.

[23:00] A lot of people love it.

[23:01] It's just...

[23:02] It's not relevant enough for like a public venue.

[23:06] I was hoping it would be Star Wars, I guess I was a little sad, but that's okay.

[23:10] Well, everything's shifted.

[23:12] So Stern's plans all shifted out.

[23:14] I think Star Wars was originally planned to be what was going to be shown as like...

[23:19] I know they're doing Slayer too, right?

[23:21] I think Slayer is meant to distract people from Arrowsmith.

[23:24] I think that is a loose stuff.

[23:26] Oh yeah, I think...

[23:28] Come on, who's going to buy Slayer?

[23:30] Look at Metallica, look at Metallica though.

[23:32] Like Gary probably doesn't listen to any of this stuff.

[23:35] He's like, well Metallica's good and they like Slayer, so Slayer's got to be the same thing.

[23:39] He's probably thinking in BAM.

[23:40] There you go.

[23:41] I don't know, but like theme wise, like Slayer's fanbase compared to Metallica ACDC is minuscule compared to Arrowsmith's fanbase.

[23:50] Maybe Arrowsmith don't want nothing to do with that.

[23:53] I mean, I think it's that.

[23:56] If I was Gary, I mean, if you're contacting a musical act and you're like,

[24:01] Hey, being on a pinball machine is probably one of the coolest things that immortalizes the greatest bands out there.

[24:07] Everyone from the stones, the guns and roses, to Metallica.

[24:11] So we'd like to make a pinball machine for you guys.

[24:14] I think people would jump at the opportunity to have a pinball machine made for the band.

[24:18] So we'll see what it is.

[24:19] I mean, I don't think we're going to hear anything other than Batman at Expo.

[24:25] I don't think they're going to.

[24:26] So I think this is going to be what we get through Christmas.

[24:29] There's a crazy amount of titles.

[24:32] I mean, I think it's more than I can justify purchasing.

[24:36] The return of the investment takes longer in a pinball.

[24:39] Our purchase rate is, we don't always buy every cycle.

[24:43] And this is just insane.

[24:45] It just came out with this Papsa game.

[24:47] I know that's just a marketing ploy or something like that.

[24:50] But still, I mean, first thing I was thinking when I saw Batman is like,

[24:53] we had trouble getting our Ghostbusters premium.

[24:56] So we went to the pro.

[24:58] I was like, if they can't make those games, how the hell they're going to make more games?

[25:01] I mean, it's just like, I don't know.

[25:03] It seems like they're behind.

[25:04] Right.

[25:05] And they're going to release more.

[25:06] Well, it's crazy.

[25:07] If you go to Stern Pinball, I'm going to them right now.

[25:10] And you go to games.

[25:11] They have available for you to buy one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

[25:19] Wait, no, wait.

[25:20] Nine games right now on the line that you can get, that they're currently marketing as available.

[25:27] Add Batman to that.

[25:29] So that's ten.

[25:30] That doesn't show on this website.

[25:33] It doesn't show the Paps game either.

[25:35] Right.

[25:36] So it's eleven.

[25:37] I guess Paps is being sold through Paps or PBR.

[25:39] It's directly in line.

[25:40] Right.

[25:41] And then you could also add, well, then you could also add medieval manned's remakes.

[25:47] So that's what, eleven or twelve.

[25:49] I mean, it's, it is incredible.

[25:51] I mean, they moved into a factory that's twice the size of the old factory.

[25:54] So they have the, they have the assembly line that could pass it to do this, which, which,

[25:59] look, it's just incredible though.

[26:01] If you go to Jersey Jack's website, you see two games.

[26:04] If you go to Dutch's website, you see one game.

[26:07] If you go to highway, you see two games.

[26:10] You know, it's, when Gary gets up there and talks to people and makes it sound like,

[26:14] we really are the only game in town.

[26:16] I mean, he's right.

[26:17] I mean, this, this feels like a company that is making a lot of pinball machines.

[26:21] Now, I still have a heart for boutique pinball and out of the games coming out, like we were saying.

[26:26] So the Bowsky is too expensive.

[26:28] Thunderbirds, I don't, I don't get that theme at all.

[26:32] If you're trying to, let's talk about that for a little bit, because if you're trying to like launch your pinball company,

[26:37] why would you pick an obscure theme like Thunderbirds?

[26:41] Well, they're from Australia, right?

[26:43] Yeah, but is it like, is that a huge show in Australia?

[26:46] Is it like the GI Joe of Australia?

[26:49] I mean, but even so, like, that's not the, how can you, is that your main market then as Australia?

[26:55] It shouldn't be the US where most collectors are?

[26:59] I, well, Australia is a pretty big market I heard.

[27:02] I don't know for sure, but I mean, I heard when they sold ACDC, they sold a ton of them to them.

[27:07] So, I, you know, I mean, if they're a boutique company, right?

[27:10] Well, they're making them in China.

[27:11] China.

[27:12] And they're making every part in house.

[27:14] Like, nothing is being bought from...

[27:16] But hell, I mean, if they can make that game for $3,000, I don't know what the price point's going to be.

[27:20] I'm China.

[27:21] You know, I mean, people will buy it regardless of if it's Thunderbirds or...

[27:25] I think Thunderbirds are the Explorer.

[27:28] It's going to be around probably $8,000, $10,000.

[27:33] I think it's a premium product.

[27:35] So, Mike who runs Home Pin, he's going to show not the complete game, but he's going to show mechanisms

[27:43] and sort of like a rudimentary, like a basic cabinet in September.

[27:49] I think 24th and 25th at a show over there.

[27:53] And I think in Australia, I want to say...

[27:55] I'm guessing it's some of this stuff.

[27:57] But I know there is a modern Thunderbirds cartoon.

[28:00] It's on Netflix.

[28:01] I don't know if it's any good.

[28:03] But it is something they're trying to bring back.

[28:06] Like, I...

[28:07] What's your thought?

[28:09] Because I just don't think all these boutique companies can survive the next couple of years.

[28:14] I mean, they...

[28:15] There's just no way.

[28:17] Well, if you remember a long time ago, like, I mean, a long time ago before any of us were born,

[28:23] back when, you know, Baffleball was new.

[28:26] There was like something, what, 20 or 30 pinball companies back then, you know, making these bag of telegames

[28:32] and every little, do-wiki kind of game you can think of.

[28:35] And then, I think it was the war happened, I believe.

[28:39] And then only two of them came out after the war.

[28:42] You know, I mean, the market couldn't sustain them all.

[28:44] And it kind of reminds me of that a little bit.

[28:46] There's just so many of it, you know.

[28:48] And eventually, there's going to be some sort of...

[28:51] You know, the market's going to correct itself.

[28:53] It's either that they're all going to survive, which I highly doubt,

[28:56] or the market will shift.

[28:59] And, you know, you can see with Stern, we're seeing one huge player,

[29:02] they've become Valley Williams.

[29:05] And, you know, Jersey Jack would probably be the equivalent of what Stern used to be.

[29:11] I would think that at East or the second place player.

[29:15] And then, we have our Capcom and we have, who else was there?

[29:20] Got Lee, Got Lee, Premier.

[29:24] So, I mean, it's kind of history repeating itself.

[29:28] There's a lot of garage makers now.

[29:31] Right.

[29:32] And that was...

[29:33] Yeah, well, what's crazy is we are in a boom.

[29:37] And to me, what's unfortunate is the new to the game guys, like Highway and Dutch,

[29:45] even Jersey Jack, they just can't ship pins.

[29:49] People want to give their money to these companies, and they can't get the pins on the line.

[29:56] And the box...

[29:57] Well, I mean, isn't Jack shipping...

[29:59] They're shipping Hobbits.

[30:00] Yeah, Jack has got Hobbits shipping.

[30:03] He's got Waz's.

[30:05] But, I mean, look, it took Jack three years, almost three years delayed to get Hobbit out

[30:11] from when it was originally promised.

[30:13] But if I have money today, Sean, and I go to Jersey Jack, I don't know how quickly I get a Hobbit.

[30:21] I think they're still making like the LEDs that ever ordered in the essays that people pre-ordered.

[30:28] So, it might be a long wait.

[30:30] Alien Pimble?

[30:32] I don't know.

[30:33] Is it going to come out in November, December when, as Andrew says, I tend to think that whenever people put dates out there, they never hit them.

[30:44] So, I wouldn't be surprised if Alien slips into Q1 of 2017.

[30:49] You have a problem with this Alien game, don't you?

[30:52] No, I mean, look, my problem with Alien is...

[30:57] I mean, I've had my issues with Orrk directly that I've aired out on this podcast.

[31:01] Well, look, I have the same issues.

[31:03] I just think they should focus on their game and reveal it when it's ready.

[31:06] And they're doing that.

[31:07] I mean, I still think Orrk should stop going into the Ghostbusters.

[31:10] Yeah, because...

[31:11] He's got a puppy, his old blood.

[31:12] He's going...

[31:13] But he's doing the same thing again that caused him to take a break the first time.

[31:18] He's being critical of Stern in what they're doing.

[31:21] And it's like, Orrk, man, just focus on your game.

[31:24] Like, if Highway...

[31:25] Highway has an opportunity here, and I've said it.

[31:27] If Alien is a home run, and they reveal it, and it blows people away, I think they're going to get...

[31:34] ...inundated with orders.

[31:36] But it's...

[31:38] I think that if Batman is as spectacular as Stern is saying, it is.

[31:43] Not that we can trust their own opinion of their own product.

[31:47] I think it's going to take some of the wind out of the sales of Alien.

[31:50] And I think Alien, if it had shipped or been revealed earlier, it would have helped them.

[31:55] I don't know.

[31:56] I heard stories, and I'm not as burst in this, as you are.

[31:59] But I believe that...

[32:01] You said there's no likeness of actors on that game.

[32:05] Well, there's not on the Playfield art.

[32:08] I think there will be in the clips from the movies and the call-out.

[32:12] So I think they have...

[32:14] I would assume so.

[32:16] I think they have to, right?

[32:18] What's the point of having that beautiful screen if you can't show movie clips?

[32:21] But again, that just comes down to whatever the licensing deal Andrew has with Fox.

[32:25] I do think there was an issue with the licensing deal, and that's why we haven't seen anything.

[32:31] But we may never know.

[32:32] And I don't want to speculate, because it's stupid.

[32:35] Well, I mean, are there a new company?

[32:37] I don't know how well full throttle sold.

[32:40] I've only ever seen one.

[32:42] Well, if you only only one in the full state.

[32:45] If you ask Wise Snow helped in, he thinks it's like the greatest game ever.

[32:49] I know.

[32:50] I bet it's...

[32:52] I would assume that full throttle has not really sold.

[32:55] Well, maybe...

[32:57] I still have a fundraiser too.

[33:00] But in the UK, even, I don't know what they sold.

[33:02] I mean, you think it in their home market, it would sell more.

[33:05] I mean, I don't know.

[33:07] I mean, we'll never get those numbers.

[33:09] I know in America, people are not...

[33:12] Even like, pin-siders, you have it, what, like less than 10?

[33:16] Maybe 5 have one?

[33:18] Yeah, that's a tough sell with those original themes.

[33:21] I think your friend Ben Hex said it the best.

[33:24] I mean, you know, with the license you get the story right away.

[33:27] People already know it.

[33:28] And with this game, it's motorcycle racing, which is OK.

[33:32] It's not MotoGP.

[33:35] So, I mean, if it was a Harley game in the States, it would probably sell.

[33:39] But it's a weird kind of...

[33:44] It looks foreign.

[33:46] It's got the foreign actor.

[33:48] It's just Americans are weird that way.

[33:51] No, look, I think it's always difficult to build a company

[33:57] and not have a license theme out of the gate.

[34:01] And I think that...

[34:03] I mean, like, America's most haunted experienced that.

[34:05] If it wasn't limited, hyper limited, that wouldn't have sold.

[34:09] Rob Zombie sold out immediately with a theme that people like.

[34:14] And so...

[34:16] You know, I wish there was a little bit more originality in Pimball,

[34:19] but I also really don't care.

[34:21] If the game is awesome, and it's based on a theme that I love,

[34:24] I would love a big shot.

[34:26] The originality stuff only works when they're ripping off something else anyway.

[34:29] Look at me, people.

[34:31] And even Americans most haunted is a rip off of all those ghost shows

[34:35] that were popular for a while.

[34:37] I mean, tell us the Raven Knights is a lad in.

[34:39] I mean, everything's based on something that's very popular within culture or history.

[34:45] Yeah, I mean, you know, original themes are good.

[34:49] But they're...

[34:51] I mean, I don't buy them.

[34:53] I mean, you know, I like theater magic.

[34:57] That's one of my favorite games.

[34:59] And...

[35:01] Didn't he want that originally to be called Harry Houdini?

[35:05] I think he wanted it.

[35:07] David Copperfield.

[35:09] John's obsessed, by the way.

[35:11] He's obsessed with David Copperfield.

[35:13] When I was talking to John, and I was talking to him about magic or on marketing it,

[35:17] I literally put together a really awesome deck of marketing ideas for him.

[35:23] He didn't even, like, say, like, thanks or like that.

[35:25] He's just like, I really just want to set up a game for David Copperfield in his home and let him play it.

[35:31] And I'm like, John, like, you realize this guy's been like accused of like,

[35:37] raping women and he's really not very popular with people anymore.

[35:41] Maybe that we shouldn't do that.

[35:43] But, John, it's kind of a strange guy.

[35:45] I mean, back to Highway Pimble.

[35:47] I don't want to rip on them.

[35:49] I like Andrew Highway.

[35:51] A lot of the things they made into the game are like where they put the LCD monitor.

[35:55] I like the fact there are no physical roll overs, which is stuff like that.

[35:59] There's a lot of innovation there.

[36:01] I mean, they need the game with the theme.

[36:03] Obviously, they're having issues with the license.

[36:07] That's what's the 100% that's probably what the delay is.

[36:11] They're trying to get likeances and it's probably costing more than they wanted.

[36:15] Well, look, the game is going to be revealed really soon.

[36:19] It's going to be at Expo. They're going to show it Thursday night.

[36:23] They're going to have their big reveal.

[36:25] Then the next day's tournament is going to have their massive party with Batman and Adam West.

[36:29] It's actually I'm excited for Expo this year.

[36:31] I'm going to be going. For those of you who listen to this podcast,

[36:33] Canada will be there.

[36:35] And I look forward to it because I got to admit last year's show was kind of like a dud.

[36:41] I really wasn't planning to go back.

[36:43] But I think it's going to be much better this year.

[36:47] I think we're going to because we're going to see some brand new pins for the first time,

[36:51] which we really didn't get last year.

[36:53] And Stern's party looks awesome.

[36:57] I got to admit, the pinball life party was kind of cool, but it was also kind of strange that you people were,

[37:03] it's like an hour and 15 minute drive from where the convention is to get to the pinball life party.

[37:09] And I was like, yeah, I never been to the pinball life party.

[37:11] I've been to the Expo a bunch of times.

[37:15] I don't want to drive any farther.

[37:17] It's just weird. Like it's just strange.

[37:19] Like you're at this convention and then you got to like leave and drive to go play more pinball, somewhere else.

[37:25] I don't know. And I had a party I was told.

[37:27] It's an awesome part. It's an it honestly.

[37:29] It's better than Expo if you want to play pinball.

[37:33] Pinball like, well, and that's what the thing is. Expo is all about announcements.

[37:37] It's about sitting in the room and listening to companies announce things, right?

[37:43] And have a dialogue with the different people and talk to them in the room about what their news is.

[37:51] It's really more about releasing news than it is about playing pinball because the hall where you play pinball doesn't even have that many machines.

[37:59] And then there's a tournament going on.

[38:01] There's times when you literally can't play anything because nothing's available to play because there's like a tournament taking over the room.

[38:07] So I'll be there. I hope to meet up with a lot of you guys.

[38:11] All right. So look, we'll wait and see on Aliens. So let's talk about the Dutch pinball because the big Lebowski is a machine that when it was revealed at Expo in what 2014, it's sort of like blue people away.

[38:25] And I think now that it's shipping, I don't know. I'm really not hearing that much come from the owners.

[38:33] And I think maybe partially because there's not many of them, they've only managed to get out around 30 of them so far.

[38:41] I don't know if they can survive on these this really slow trickling out of games.

[38:45] If you were to ask me which company I think might go under, I think Dutch might not survive at the rate they're going with these games.

[38:53] Yeah, I mean, I can't say for sure, but I mean, if you're not selling products, you're wasting money.

[39:01] I think, you know, and they did make so money off of what is that with the robot that kid?

[39:09] They had that bright a pinball at 2.0.

[39:11] Yeah, I mean, that probably helped. That's a really good idea, honestly. Maybe making more of those, maybe they should be doing.

[39:21] But I wouldn't buy one is too expensive. I mean, that theme doesn't do any, I don't, that movie is not one of my favorite movies.

[39:29] I mean, it's not a bad movie. I just, it's okay.

[39:33] So I mean, that doesn't do anything for me. And then the price when I look at it, it gets sticker shock and fall over and, you know, need resuscitation.

[39:41] But, you know, if they're not, if they're not moving product, they're not making money.

[39:46] Right. Unless they're not paying anybody.

[39:49] Well, that's what I always like, I just had scratch when it's these companies are, they're around for like two, three years in development with no money coming in.

[39:58] How do you recoup that once you, you know, so your first game is operating in a loss.

[40:05] And so I've always said, like when I try to just figure out the business of pinball on the manufacturing side, I mean, either some of these guys are just like independently wealthy.

[40:17] Either they have investors that are helping out because look, Jersey Jack pinball and everyone knows this would have gone under with people's hobbit deposit money.

[40:29] If Jack didn't get investors to bail him out of the red.

[40:34] I mean, that's true.

[40:35] But that's, that's fine. I mean, he's, he's, he needed that to get the company to where it is today. And like I hope, I hope my dream is that Jack can have two, three games on the line at the same time.

[40:47] Because I think that Jersey Jack quality is phenomenal. And I think he's also bringing a level of innovation that makes Stern up its game, makes other people up their game.

[40:56] But the, it's just the issues with shipping are what going to sink these companies if they can't get stuff out quickly.

[41:04] Well, I mean, a lot of, you know, Wizard of Oz was obviously not making them enough money to survive.

[41:09] So I mean, there's a lot of features on there and quality built into that that is just not feasible.

[41:15] You know, so I mean, that's what caused their financial part probably, excuse me, problem, probably in the first place.

[41:23] So I mean, you're going to see games from them come out, but I don't think you're going to see the level of toys.

[41:29] Right.

[41:31] Hobbit was kind of in the middle. That one kind of put them almost in the hole in the ground.

[41:37] And so the next game I bet you're going to get cut down a bit.

[41:41] And no one's talking about this, but I'm pretty sure you can see a lot, a lot of pet lowers game at X was well.

[41:47] And that may be a surprise that may really change people's minds on a lot of things.

[41:54] So here's the thing with with with lalder's game.

[41:56] And I will go on the record by saying I am anxiously optimistic about it.

[42:06] Now, tell you why, I think it's been developed for so long.

[42:10] It kind of to me feels like the Chinese democracy of pinball where like this guy's, you know, like he's had, he kind of peaked like early on in his career.

[42:19] And made a lot of really amazing games that people are still considered to be the some of the best games of all time.

[42:24] But so much time has passed and he's trying to recreate the magic.

[42:28] That sounds a lot like you can say the same thing about Steve Richie.

[42:32] You know, I mean, but yeah, I mean, he did, but he's not he's not he's making great stuff.

[42:38] And you know, I would underestimate pet lower.

[42:41] But he's he's continued to yeah, no, like I like I.

[42:45] Jack's also not an idiot and Jack can recognize.

[42:48] I think what what is going to be a good game.

[42:51] I fully believe that.

[42:53] So look, if the game is revealed at expo, I think it's interesting.

[42:56] Here's my question though.

[42:58] It's like, I don't think Jack can show this game until it's like really ready to go on the line.

[43:03] Because then what is it get you all it does is it makes people freeze their hobbit orders.

[43:09] Right?

[43:10] I'm not going to because it's going to cannibalize hobbit and was sales the second that game is showed.

[43:16] So I think Jack is going to have the milk.

[43:20] You know that the smoug titty as much as possible before he can show all his games.

[43:25] I don't think the hobbit selling that great to be honest.

[43:29] And they may just need a boost of something to get something going.

[43:33] No, I don't know anything, but I mean the hobbit's expensive.

[43:37] It's not that great of a game.

[43:39] Let's just face it.

[43:41] You know, unless you like the movies.

[43:43] But Sean the code, the code everyone swears by the code.

[43:47] Well, you can put all kinds of paint on your car, but it's not going to go any faster.

[43:51] So I mean, you know, even those cheap $35, you know knockoff mufflers to make it sound faster.

[43:59] But it you know, no, it's a it's a different game.

[44:02] You know, I was not saying it.

[44:04] It's not it's just it's not the game that we're used to anymore.

[44:07] We're used to faster and more action packed games.

[44:10] And it's it seems kind of like a throwback to like godly even stuff when the game is more about hitting multiple drop targets and floaty.

[44:18] And you know, it's just I've never been then impressed by it to be honest.

[44:22] It's like was.

[44:24] Yeah, I'm like, hobbit is a polarizing game.

[44:29] And I've yet to ever be amazed by it.

[44:34] I am amazed visually by it.

[44:36] But I just I've never played it like in a home environment where you know where I can hear everything and understand what to do.

[44:41] And it but even so I'm not a fan of the shots.

[44:45] I don't know if it's one with one.

[44:47] I mean, it's not like I mean once I got to play it a bunch, I got you know, I got into it.

[44:51] It's not it's not like a complete dud.

[44:54] It's just it seems like a lot of stuff was wasted on drop targets or like making them individually selectable.

[45:00] It's just a waste.

[45:02] I mean all that can as them and stuff could have been done for something else.

[45:05] More ramps or you know some of their feature.

[45:09] You know, the trolls were cool.

[45:11] You know, but not for them.

[45:13] It's just back them all.

[45:15] Do you do you think the rumor that Jack has toy stories is true?

[45:19] Do you think that's going to happen?

[45:23] I would buy that.

[45:25] You and me both.

[45:27] I mean I that's like my that's my dream theme.

[45:30] I'm trying to get somebody to make Minecraft.

[45:33] Okay.

[45:34] The kids like today they just love Minecraft every kid just under the age of like 10 probably.

[45:41] If I have one of those pinballs, I know that they would just play the hell out of it.

[45:45] I know it's not really appealing to the collective markets.

[45:48] The old people don't get it.

[45:50] You know, it's in that.

[45:51] But for an operator, that's a theme that would really do well in any form.

[45:55] Right.

[45:56] There's a redemption piece or whatever.

[45:58] I don't know.

[45:59] Microsoft owns it now.

[46:00] So who knows what's going to happen with it.

[46:02] But I mean that's kind of what we're looking for.

[46:04] Ghostbusters is kind of like one of those themes that appeals to everybody.

[46:07] Which is great.

[46:08] It feels to the old guy.

[46:09] It feels to the young kids.

[46:10] It's a great piece for us.

[46:13] Game of Thrones.

[46:14] It's okay.

[46:15] You know.

[46:16] I like the game.

[46:18] I think Game of Thrones is just a huge mess.

[46:21] I love the show.

[46:22] I think the fan base is rabid.

[46:24] I just can't get over the art.

[46:26] I'll never be able to.

[46:28] It's like I've looked at it closely.

[46:31] Even the resolution on the different people isn't the same.

[46:34] I can't close the close.

[46:36] I got to say this too.

[46:37] I mean after seeing Ghostbusters and what Trudeau did with all the, you know,

[46:42] the Magnus slings and the toys and the subway ramp and the slimer.

[46:47] I'm a little worried if Richie's doing Star Wars that it's just going to be more of a flow game

[46:53] and not have the toys and the magic that Star Wars deserves.

[46:59] Because if there's not a BB8 rolling around the play field using magnets,

[47:04] I'm like, or like Kyla Run Force grabbing the ball.

[47:08] And like it needs magnets.

[47:10] Lots of them.

[47:11] Richie's really not into that.

[47:13] I think stun stuff like that.

[47:16] Which stuns?

[47:17] I don't know.

[47:24] Does he use magnets frequently in some of his previous titles?

[47:29] Was it high speed too?

[47:31] Or was it going around a circle and the reds up the engine up there?

[47:36] What is that?

[47:38] Yeah, so like I, I hope that's certain.

[47:41] Like so when I think we're in a different era of sterno then like back in the day, right?

[47:46] When it's like they don't lock themselves in a room.

[47:48] I think all these designers probably talk to each other and share ideas.

[47:51] But Star Wars to me needs to have a lot of like fucking magic going on in the play field.

[47:59] It can't just be like flowing all about like code and stacking shit.

[48:04] I don't know.

[48:05] And it also, I'd love to have a Millennium Falcon where like the hangar door drops down.

[48:09] You have to shoot up to lock the ball.

[48:11] How fucking cool would that be?

[48:13] That would be pretty cool.

[48:15] You know, I don't, I'm trying to think they've made so many Star Wars games already.

[48:19] They're all terrible.

[48:21] Well the daddy's one's okay, it earned pretty well.

[48:24] I don't remember.

[48:25] They had a death star on it, I think.

[48:26] They all earned.

[48:27] But I mean no one, if you look at the rankings, Star Wars in terms of top 100 games,

[48:32] like no one ever is like, I love my Star Wars.

[48:35] You don't hear that.

[48:37] Yeah, but I mean people see Star Wars and they want to buy it.

[48:41] I mean, I just don't, I don't know.

[48:44] I think Steve Richie is going to get it.

[48:46] I mean, I heard it's like it's Richie and I think Lyman on code for it.

[48:54] Really?

[48:55] God.

[48:56] But I got to imagine, I mean Star Wars is going to get everyone sort of like

[49:01] giving ideas like Gomez, like, like, I don't know.

[49:07] I don't know how they operate.

[49:09] Maybe Richie's like, I don't want to hear from any of you, motherfucker, it's mine.

[49:12] I've heard that he's really mean.

[49:14] Yeah, I've heard that.

[49:15] That he kind of just, it's his way of the highway, you know.

[49:19] So maybe he's not like that anymore.

[49:21] I don't know.

[49:22] Well, like I mean, I've only met him a couple times.

[49:24] I think you need a little bit of an ego in this industry to be a good pinball designer.

[49:28] Yeah.

[49:29] It's definitely a requirement.

[49:31] Well, all right.

[49:32] Well, so we'll see what happens there.

[49:34] I mean, I don't think we're going to see anything on Star Wars until like Q2 of 2017.

[49:40] And I would imagine it be kind of awkward.

[49:45] I don't know if it's a Force Awakens pin or if they're going to try and get the sequel to Force Awakens into it and release it maybe next December.

[49:55] I don't know.

[49:56] I mean, I doubt that they have information on the second film.

[50:02] I don't know.

[50:03] I don't think they're going to give it to them.

[50:07] I wouldn't mind it being just Force Awakens.

[50:09] I mean, I love that movie.

[50:10] It's kind of like the new Star Wars for a new generation.

[50:13] And I don't want it to be like all the movies.

[50:18] Because then it would be weird, right?

[50:20] Because then you'd have the first six.

[50:23] I don't know.

[50:24] You know, which the first three saw the prequels.

[50:26] And then you'd have like the three that people like.

[50:28] And then you'd have Force Awakens.

[50:30] So you'd have like seven movies, but you wouldn't complete the entire storyline.

[50:35] Because we need two more to finish the Force Awakens storyline.

[50:39] So I don't know.

[50:40] I think it'd be kind of strange.

[50:41] I don't know.

[50:42] I don't even know what the, what's the next movie title?

[50:44] I don't even know.

[50:45] I'm not that big into it.

[50:46] So I don't know if it is titled yet.

[50:49] I don't think it has a title.

[50:52] I know there's the rogue one that's coming out.

[50:55] Right.

[50:56] Maybe they'll make it on that.

[50:58] Right.

[50:59] It'll be the pinball be based on the side story stuff.

[51:02] Right.

[51:03] Because that would be cheaper license, right?

[51:05] I don't know.

[51:06] So in terms of like, so what the new stuff coming up,

[51:10] I'm trying to think we've reached everything.

[51:12] So spooky.

[51:13] Yeah, I'm sorry.

[51:14] Spooky's got Rob Zommies that are coming off the line now.

[51:17] There's Domino's now too, you know.

[51:19] And Domino's, yep, we talked a blake of a week ago.

[51:23] I think that Domino's looks fine.

[51:25] I mean, like I personally wouldn't own one with all,

[51:28] I mean, it's not like a dream theme for me.

[51:30] And also my client that I work with is Pizza Hut.

[51:32] So I would probably get fired if I bought a Domino's bin.

[51:35] But I think, you know, for what it is,

[51:37] and with the tax, you know, you get the tax rebate on it

[51:41] because they're making a charitable donation when you buy it,

[51:44] it's like, you know, all of a sudden these,

[51:47] it's a $40, what, like a $4800 game.

[51:51] That's a good price.

[51:53] It's not bad, you know, in a world of $9,000 or $10,000 or pins,

[51:57] not too shabby.

[51:58] There's not that much on there, I mean, to be honest.

[52:01] I mean, there's like, what, a motor, I think, a turbo.

[52:04] You definitely get what you pay for, right?

[52:07] But I think it's going to be interesting too,

[52:11] because spooky's not going to limit it.

[52:13] It's not limited edition.

[52:15] So, like these are made for Domino's people,

[52:19] first and foremost, right?

[52:20] Same thing with, you know, like Paps, Paps.

[52:24] Like they're making that game as a thank you to the bars,

[52:29] you know, that sell their products.

[52:31] And it's smart marketing.

[52:33] I mean, the cost of development is being subsidized

[52:37] because it's Domino's Pizza that's helping, you know,

[52:41] is helping pay for the project.

[52:44] They're paying spooky to do this.

[52:47] I would assume it's not just, like, I'm sure they're making it.

[52:50] I'm shaking on each one's soul.

[52:52] I'm assuming.

[52:53] Yeah, they've got to.

[52:54] I was not that big in a profit.

[52:56] I mean, but he's not stupid.

[52:58] So, I just got to, it can summon you to keep the doors open.

[53:02] And if he was in a profit, he'd be selling those games for hell,

[53:05] I'm more, and people would buy them, you know.

[53:08] Well, I think he also, though, like, I'm, you know,

[53:11] it's interesting, because, like, we're seeing a lot of people

[53:13] trying to flip Rob Zombies.

[53:15] And to varying degrees of success, I think, I don't think, you know,

[53:21] Rob Zombie is $9,000 new in box.

[53:25] Like, people thought it was going to be just because there's 300.

[53:28] Because here's why I think, as much as spooky will limit their games,

[53:32] their games do look really, really, really home-brew next to, like,

[53:36] like, Ghostbusters.

[53:38] Yeah, they're a little...

[53:39] A little...

[53:40] A little last gem, a little bit.

[53:42] Like, Ghostbusters Pro even next to Rob Zombie looks twice as expensive

[53:47] and twice as innovative.

[53:49] Have you seen a Rob Zombie, though?

[53:51] Yeah.

[53:52] In person?

[53:53] Yeah.

[53:54] It looks a little better than it does in that picture.

[53:56] No, it looks fine.

[53:57] I mean, look, it's...

[53:58] But it's, you know, like, we were saying, like, there's not a lot going on.

[54:02] And they, uh...

[54:04] And they're, like, they're priced accordingly.

[54:06] Oh, yeah.

[54:07] I mean, that's, you know, there's a, you know, you're gonna $9,000 box

[54:11] is gonna get you a whole one more stuff.

[54:12] Right.

[54:13] You know, $5,000 gets you that.

[54:15] I think what's...

[54:16] I mean, it's a fun game, though.

[54:17] I'm gonna say it.

[54:18] I think what spooky needs to do eventually is they need to, with the money they're making

[54:23] and putting in the bank, I think they need to hire game designers who can take them to the next level.

[54:30] Because I think they're sort of stuck in their own, like, simplistic way of designing.

[54:35] And I don't think they have the know-how to even go to where, like,

[54:40] Stern can go with ideas and other companies.

[54:43] And then, I think it just comes from hiring the people that, like, can bring you that.

[54:48] And I think they can afford a good salary designer if they continue to do what they're doing.

[54:54] Well, you know, Ben Heck, Design America, most haunted.

[54:57] And a lot of that had some innovating stuff in it.

[55:00] And, like, mechanisms and things.

[55:02] They need a good mechanical kind of engineer, like him or someone.

[55:05] Um, I don't know if Ben is doing anything else with them.

[55:08] I thought he was going to, maybe, but, you know, there's stuff like that.

[55:13] And you can tell with the other games there's not a lot of mechanical stuff.

[55:17] It's just, you know, there's servos and stuff, but there's no, like, there's no elevator.

[55:21] There's no gadget.

[55:23] Usually, like, even like, there's slime, like, slimer mech, for example, right?

[55:26] It's like, you kind of want people who, and maybe this is just because Stern also has, like, a huge company

[55:33] that can help bring these ideas to life.

[55:35] But you want to be able to, like, put things in games that are just unique to the theme

[55:40] and to what you're, you're doing and not always have, like, when I see the noise,

[55:43] it looks just like the ghost from America's most haunted.

[55:46] It's like, you know, like, you're, we're getting, like, recycled sort of design.

[55:51] That was a good game.

[55:53] I mean, so I don't see them not recycling parts of it.

[55:57] There's a lot of design that looks like it was, you know, recycled from that game.

[56:02] It is a limited game, so I guess if you couldn't get America's most haunted, you can get dominoes

[56:06] and it has a lot of the same stuff.

[56:08] Not a lot, but a few things.

[56:10] Now, I don't know how much of that game that the dominoes game that Spooky actually designed themselves.

[56:15] I know some of the people at dominoes were doing some of the designing.

[56:19] So I don't know if we should really pin the blame on anyone at Spooky or not.

[56:22] Well, I don't think, yeah, well, there was art.

[56:27] There was an art team that was working on the game along with Blake that did like the,

[56:32] but I think the design was like Spooky design.

[56:35] No, I thought they were laid out some shots for them and stuff like that.

[56:39] I heard somewhere that, I don't know how much of it is.

[56:43] I mean, I love Charlie. He's a great guy, so I'm not going to leave.

[56:46] He's a great company.

[56:47] Yeah, you know, I look forward to playing it.

[56:49] I think Spooky is like, got the right thing going and I do look forward to seeing what their theme is going to be.

[56:56] After Dominoes, I think if anyone's going to make, you know, what is it?

[57:01] We keep the monsters.

[57:02] We keep hearing people who want like those kinds of like quirky.

[57:06] And they're the company to do it.

[57:08] I mean, they can make the small runs.

[57:10] Exactly.

[57:11] It's not a 10,000 seller or whatever they sell now.

[57:15] They can still do it.

[57:16] Right.

[57:17] They are going to, I've heard rumors of another game.

[57:20] You know, that's theirs that's coming and maybe ready for X.

[57:23] But I don't know.

[57:24] I don't know when it's coming by for.

[57:26] There is another one.

[57:27] There's a fourth game exists.

[57:29] Yeah, well, you got it.

[57:30] Like, they're a legitimate company.

[57:32] I mean, I'm sure Game 4 and 5 is being sort of worked on.

[57:36] I mean, it's, I mean, Stern is working on games probably up in, you know, I've been saying this like the next two, three years.

[57:42] Like, they've got it mapped out.

[57:43] Like, this theme, like...

[57:45] Well, I mean, you guys, I mean, the whole collector market is used to this.

[57:48] They want new game, new game, new game.

[57:50] And like, the old school market of this is, this amusement market, games don't come out this fast for us normally.

[57:58] And we have like an arcade game in the last couple of years.

[58:01] You know, I mean, that's, you know, they make, you know, Jurassic Park.

[58:05] And that was made last year.

[58:06] I'm probably probably using that one until next year.

[58:08] They'll be making that one game and maybe another title, but not like we're going to get a new game every three times a year.

[58:15] And just, right, you know, this is, you know, and then they're taking a different kind of model and putting it into a factory where they used to building things in a certain way.

[58:23] So, I mean, you know, it's, it remains to be seen, you know, you can keep coming up with designs and stuff.

[58:30] But if your line is the bottleneck, you can't get the stuff out the door.

[58:33] What's the point of designing more stuff?

[58:35] Right.

[58:36] Well, what I think would Gary will eventually do too is not only make pinball machines.

[58:44] Well, that would be good.

[58:45] Yeah, because he's going to see that, you know, if there's money in like, going up and other things and slot machines, they might, like, that's what we tried before.

[58:53] I mean, this is not new.

[58:54] They tried that failed.

[58:56] I mean, hardcore.

[58:57] I mean, when you go for making a pinball machine to go to make a ski ball machine, for instance, there's a lot of this quirks, you know, and you don't see, you know,

[59:07] there's a batak making pinball for a reason, and there's the reason that Stern, I mean, they tried to make coin rolled out games before.

[59:13] They tried to make the light-stopping game.

[59:15] Right.

[59:16] And they thought Titanic was a good idea, whoever grinned, let that thing.

[59:19] Right.

[59:20] You know, it just, it didn't, the gameplay mechanics are different between the two fields, you know.

[59:25] So you have to get somebody in there that knows that stuff.

[59:28] Right.

[59:29] And it does a pay, you know, and maybe it will.

[59:31] But there's, there's people that are established in the other stuff.

[59:34] So it's hard to break into that.

[59:35] Right.

[59:36] Well, Stern's goal, I mean, I think Stern is just wants to put everybody else out of business.

[59:40] And as much as people are like, no, they, you know, I don't think they're that vindictive.

[59:45] I think, I think they, you know, they're sitting pretty at the top of the hill and they don't care.

[59:51] Right.

[59:52] What, what, what, what, what's going on in the bottom of the hill?

[59:54] Well, yeah, maybe you're right.

[59:55] And also like with, with other companies frustrating having endless delays, it just drives more people to Stern because, again, they're the only company, even like today.

[01:00:05] I have 10 grand in my pocket, burning a whole my pocket and I want to buy something.

[01:00:09] And I want a game in like, you know, a few weeks.

[01:00:12] It's really just Stern.

[01:00:14] Yeah.

[01:00:15] There's nothing else.

[01:00:16] I mean, nothing.

[01:00:17] Jersey Jack is as close second, you know?

[01:00:19] Yeah, probably.

[01:00:20] I mean, it could probably, like, that's a second.

[01:00:21] Yeah, I can't, but, but, but again, like with Jersey Jack, it's like, I have to love the freaking Hobbit, which I don't know who likes that movie.

[01:00:29] I hated it.

[01:00:30] And I love Lord the Rings.

[01:00:31] Like one of my favorite franchise is, you're, it's all or nothing on the theme for them.

[01:00:35] And I think that's the problem.

[01:00:36] Like, if I go to Stern's, you know, back to Stern's page, if I'm a walking dead fan, I'm happy.

[01:00:41] If I'm a wrestling fan, I'm happy.

[01:00:42] If I'm a game of thrones, Spider-Man, Kiss, Star Trek, Ghostbusters, well, Nelly, you know, Metallica, it's like my, they've got something for everyone.

[01:00:51] Right.

[01:00:52] And they can take your money today.

[01:00:55] And you will get a pin very soon.

[01:00:57] So, uh, lately, not so much, but, you know, I bet they'll be fixed.

[01:01:02] Eventually, yeah, that all that's, look, premiums are flying off the line right now with Ghostbusters.

[01:01:07] I mean, people are gonna, we're gonna see more happy campers with Ghostbusters premium.

[01:01:11] And like I have to say, I played the L.E. today at Sunshine.

[01:01:15] And the game is just phenomenal.

[01:01:17] I mean, it's super fast. It's super fun.

[01:01:19] It's super hard, but it's after going from Ghostbusters to the Adams family, I swear to God,

[01:01:26] me and Brenda were like, man, this just feels so dated and old and boring compared to Ghostbusters.

[01:01:33] I mean, literally, it like, it, it, once you get, you know, hooked by it, I think it just makes all these old games feel old.

[01:01:43] It feels really old.

[01:01:44] Yeah, it's gonna be there for the ages.

[01:01:46] Ghostbusters is a great game.

[01:01:48] It may be the new Adams family, but it's, I think it's gonna be a, go down as a classic, I really do.

[01:01:53] I was like, keep the license. I'll keep putting them out, I think.

[01:01:56] Yeah, they'll make them for five years.

[01:01:58] And then they'll do a vault edition of it.

[01:02:00] And then everyone who bought the L.E. will be like, what?

[01:02:03] Well, I don't, I don't foresee this market lasting forever.

[01:02:07] I mean, like in market.

[01:02:08] And this whole collecting thing is a brave new world.

[01:02:11] And who knows how it's gonna, it could go on for a long time or this generation of people might die off.

[01:02:16] And the whole pinball market might collapse with them, you know.

[01:02:20] And the operators, there's a lot of hobby operators doing great.

[01:02:24] But in the general population, pinball is a struggle.

[01:02:29] And when you see the big operators, not having them at all, that's not a good sign.

[01:02:34] And it needs to be fixed.

[01:02:36] You know, David Busters needs to have them.

[01:02:38] Right.

[01:02:39] If it doesn't make money or not, they need to see the value.

[01:02:41] Right.

[01:02:42] They just don't.

[01:02:43] Right.

[01:02:44] I can't blame them for that.

[01:02:45] But well, the bubble hasn't burst yet because...

[01:02:48] Well, it could be another 10 years.

[01:02:50] I don't know either.

[01:02:51] Right.

[01:02:52] 240 LEs sold out immediately and people don't even know what it looks like and then they don't even know what the price is and say they said, take it.

[01:02:58] Take my money.

[01:02:59] I don't even care.

[01:03:00] Well, this may be a permanent thing.

[01:03:01] Right.

[01:03:02] I don't know.

[01:03:03] This is a whole new world now.

[01:03:04] So it's not like the old days when it was the 90s and we had to collapse.

[01:03:07] Look, as long as I always tell Brendan this, as long as there's rich, old white men who are bored.

[01:03:15] Or white people.

[01:03:16] It's it.

[01:03:17] Oh, come on.

[01:03:18] Look at me.

[01:03:19] It's racist, man.

[01:03:20] Is that even racist?

[01:03:21] That's like, it is racist.

[01:03:22] No, how's that racist?

[01:03:23] That's the hobby.

[01:03:25] There are some...

[01:03:27] There's always...

[01:03:28] There's always like...

[01:03:29] There's always like...

[01:03:30] I know a lot of people...

[01:03:31] Yes, there's...

[01:03:32] No, but they're collector for the most part.

[01:03:34] That is the demo.

[01:03:36] That is buying these.

[01:03:37] Let me look at the themes.

[01:03:38] That's the stereotype demo too.

[01:03:40] Yeah.

[01:03:41] And look, pinball manufacturer stereotype.

[01:03:44] Look, there's no...

[01:03:45] I have...

[01:03:46] It has spanic eye who owns multiple million dollar houses.

[01:03:49] You rents out to Bruce.

[01:03:50] He buys pinball.

[01:03:51] I don't...

[01:03:52] I don't...

[01:03:53] I'm not a stereotype in one people.

[01:03:55] I'm still...

[01:03:56] Until there's a musical theme that actually has some diversity.

[01:03:58] Look, why isn't there even like a two pop girls...

[01:04:00] People choose the...

[01:04:01] There should be.

[01:04:02] Yeah.

[01:04:03] That's what I meant about.

[01:04:04] You know, get everyone else involved.

[01:04:06] You need to...

[01:04:07] I mean, popular culture says, you know, hip-hop is the way to go, right?

[01:04:10] Rap music.

[01:04:11] And I'm not a...

[01:04:12] But hell, man, I would buy that pin because I know all other people are.

[01:04:16] That...

[01:04:17] You needed to diversify the market, you know.

[01:04:18] I understand what you're saying about.

[01:04:20] It's all white people, you know.

[01:04:22] In reality, that's not true, but that's the marketing people's target for some reason.

[01:04:26] And, you know, I...

[01:04:28] I just think it should be broader.

[01:04:30] Yeah.

[01:04:31] That's nice.

[01:04:32] And that by little core...

[01:04:33] Yeah, of course.

[01:04:34] Yeah, it is.

[01:04:35] Actually, a great idea.

[01:04:36] They should just do it.

[01:04:37] Of course.

[01:04:38] Of course, I stereotype in a way that is meant to be...

[01:04:39] It purposely...

[01:04:40] Politically incorrect.

[01:04:41] It purposely pissing everybody off on PIN side.

[01:04:44] Right.

[01:04:45] Well, they're not even pissed off because, like, PIN side is like...

[01:04:48] Look, it is...

[01:04:49] I could stereotype that, but I mean...

[01:04:51] You...

[01:04:52] That's not true.

[01:04:53] I mean, we won't even go down the road of like the amount of political and correctness on the site.

[01:04:58] But Sean, we are just over our hour mark and I want to keep it around there.

[01:05:04] This has been fun talking.

[01:05:05] We will do it again real soon.

[01:05:07] Are you going to Expo or are you going any shows?

[01:05:10] Yeah, I think I'll drive down to Expo this year.

[01:05:13] Maybe I'll see you there and throw some garbage at you or something.

[01:05:16] Yeah, yeah, we'll...

[01:05:17] And, you know, we'll join the PIN side band community of people at Expo.

[01:05:21] I guess there's more of us out there who have been banned from PIN side.

[01:05:25] Right, we'll have to have our own little like...

[01:05:27] Situaside Squad...

[01:05:29] Band by PIN side sort of like get together where we can tell our horror stories.

[01:05:33] All right, Sean, I really appreciate it.

[01:05:35] Have a good night and blazing gentlemen.

[01:05:37] Check out all castle games.

[01:05:39] Is there a website you want to send people to where they can see what you're all about?

[01:05:42] All castlegames.com would work fine.

[01:05:45] All right.

[01:05:46] We sell games, but you know, sometimes.

[01:05:50] All right.

[01:05:51] All right, well, this will be some nice sort of Labor Day weekend sort of podcast listening pleasure for those out there.

[01:05:59] Next week, I'm actually talking to somebody who worked on getting Papa Duke's magic girl ready for the show that time that we all remember.

[01:06:10] So he's going to have a lot of interesting stories to tell about what the game was like when they first saw it, how much work had it go into it, over like a 48 hour period to get it ready to be flipped.

[01:06:21] So, interesting interview coming up next week.

[01:06:24] So, look out for that one.

[01:06:25] So, that one, blazing gentlemen, and have a good evening.

[01:06:28] All right.
