[00:00] Oh, a new computer. Brennan got me a new computer. Look at the camera. Looks amazing.

[00:08] It's got a better camera than the one before. I think it's going to sound amazing. Let's get

[00:14] something to prop it up on. Hold on a second.

[00:30] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a box here from Spooky Pimball. We're going to open that up today.

[00:52] I'm excited about that. Christopher, Franchie in the house.

[00:59] Oh, man. How's everybody doing, man? Oh, man, the camera looks great. I will say,

[01:05] Brennan just got me this new laptop and it looks so damn good.

[01:13] Click it. There we go. How's everybody doing? Can you hear me?

[01:22] Good morning from California. Got people over here. Let's go full screen here.

[01:29] Feeling the holiday spirits. I wish everyone would just join on YouTube. I'm tired of having to go

[01:36] both YouTube and Facebook. But how's everybody doing? I don't know. You Facebook people,

[01:42] I don't understand. Why don't you like to go to YouTube? It's better. The quality is better.

[01:47] The mic is better. Everything about it is better. But you know what the thing about Facebook,

[01:51] I like is I do get, I do get those like 3000 views or plus. Happy holidays. Everybody,

[02:00] we're going to talk Pimball. I owe you guys a podcast. It's been the holidays. It's snowed a lot

[02:07] here in a beautiful Rowafan Connecticut. We had a wonderful holiday and we got Christopher

[02:14] Francia here. The kids, you know this. When you've got Christmas and a one year old and a four

[02:21] year old, it's magical. It's beautiful. Everything about it is just absolutely magical.

[02:30] Reliving Christmas through the eyes of young children is just the sweetest thing ever.

[02:35] And you know it's amazing about getting kids gifts. They don't need like $15,000 Pimball machines.

[02:41] They really don't. It was scratching in my eye. Oh, all that. We're dog sitting right now,

[02:48] which is a lot of fun. How's everybody doing? How is everybody's Christmas? Was it good? Did you get

[02:53] what you wanted? Did you get to download the new code for the games that are out there right now?

[02:59] I think there's new code for X-Men, for Alice, for what else is out there? I don't know.

[03:04] Accessories are coming out now. I think it's going to be a really amazing 2026 in Pimball.

[03:10] Can't wait to watch everything transpire. I know some stuff. I've seen some stuff.

[03:16] And boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. If I were some of you and you're kind of like

[03:23] you need to you need to free up room, I would start listing stuff now. I would start listing stuff now.

[03:31] I just think the old stuff is going to start to feel really old.

[03:35] And I think a lot of people out there are not going to be used to

[03:39] the actual prices you're going to need to list things at to move them because I just don't think

[03:44] people are going to want the old stuff. And that's the thing with so much exciting new stuff coming

[03:49] in Pimball right now. I just don't know who wants old like Stern premiums at like 7000. No,

[03:55] I mean this when I say it, I think pros are going to 3,500. I think premiums are going to 5.

[04:01] I just mean it. There's just so much of everything old that's out there. The new stuff is where all

[04:05] the excitement is going to be. And it's not stopping. And this is the part, you know, it's kind of like

[04:11] when I look at to use a cargum in all the people that are like trying to get like so much money

[04:18] for old porches. It's like well, porches not stopping. They're just going to keep making more and

[04:22] more new great stuff. And I think that's sort of how I look at Pimball. There's none of these companies

[04:27] are calling it quits. They're not getting ready to throw in the towel. They're just making

[04:30] better and better games. And they're going to start making better and better games. And it's going

[04:35] to be a really exciting. I think the next two years of Pimball are going to be super duper exciting.

[04:40] But you 10 guys on Facebook just come over to YouTube. Just come over to YouTube. We've got so

[04:47] many more people on YouTube. It's way easier to just we can share screen on YouTube. We can

[04:53] pull up stuff. We can look at stuff. Ah, now more people are joining on Facebook.

[04:59] Sad boy, what's up? I played the Walking Dead Remastered extensively. Just made me want to play

[05:05] the original. Thank you, Sad Boy for your $4,999. It wouldn't be a Saturday morning spectacular

[05:11] without Sad Boy's contributions every week. I love your brother. I hope you had a great holiday.

[05:18] Why did it make you want to play the original? I'm curious. Was it just, was it the art? Was it too

[05:25] easy? What was it just the waiting for license or approval? Like what about the new one?

[05:33] Makes the old one feel more special. I'm just I'm I'm serious and curious like what

[05:38] what is what is missing the mark on the new Walking Dead? By the way, that game is just

[05:43] it's the Walking Dead on arrival. No one's buying it. We are about a week away from Pokemon

[05:50] and you know there's just not a lot of enthusiasm for it. I think Stern thought the game was

[05:56] going to do a lot better. I feel sorry for the people that paid 13 for it. I'll leave it

[06:01] there like 10 now. They're like already kind of 10 on the table is going to get you one.

[06:07] And we're just going to see more and more of this as we're on to the next. We're on to the next.

[06:13] We're on to the next. So you know also cause the thing is it's hard to double the price of what a

[06:20] game used to cost. I don't believe when Stern says 70% it was 70% of making a brand new game

[06:28] went into making a remastered. Yes, sure. How is that how is that possible? How is it take 70%

[06:37] of the work when the game's already been designed? Christopher Franchi holiday cocktails for mom and

[06:45] dad milkshakes for the kids. Oh, thank you brother. We're going to Christopher Franchi. We're going to

[06:49] go and get some a nice late lunch brunch with the kids and I will definitely make sure you're

[06:57] 50 dollars gets used for for that purpose. Man, I want a milkshake. Can I get a milkshake,

[07:07] dude? How you guys doing, man? Like we're going to talk all about what's going on in pinball. We're

[07:13] going to talk about the end of the year. I was planning to do I'm going to do it sometime this

[07:20] over the next few days. I'm curious to know I want to do my end of the year sort of my best of

[07:30] if you will. I can do best and worse but you know maybe I don't know. Cause thanks for the buck

[07:37] but I want to do canada kudos end of the year awards if you will. You know I'm done with the whole

[07:43] doing polls on everything and people's choice and I are the twiffies even alive. I don't even know

[07:50] I don't think they are. I know there's going to be another award show that's going to happen but

[07:55] yeah, whatever. I feel like award shows in pinball now have become a little bit of a joke that

[08:00] no one really cares. So we're going to open up this package from spooky pinball. Thank you so

[08:07] much. Emory family and spooky family for sending me a box. I didn't open it yet. I think it's

[08:12] something for the kids too and myself. So we will do an unboxing.

[08:21] An unboxing from spooky pinball.

[08:26] And Benton, Wisconsin.

[08:31] Could be anything in here. There could be a

[08:33] bregia. They could be definitely not a topper but you know can't wait to see what they sent

[08:41] but good vibes man. I've been feeling very blessed. I've been feeling like the holidays are

[08:49] great time to a little bit mentally reset. I've had some amazing moments with my kids, my wife,

[08:57] my parents came over, my parents are both still here. They're getting older and they're slowing down

[09:05] and for those of you out there who know what I'm talking about I think we all do is just when you

[09:10] see life and you start to sort of evaluate everything happening in the world, everything

[09:18] happening in our lives. All the things we should be thankful for I really do feel the holidays

[09:24] are a moment where there's a reset going on of how I would like to improve myself, improve

[09:32] the way I look at the world and just sort of you realize like what's really important and it's not

[09:41] like expensive token items even though I did get run a really nice jacket that

[09:47] caused an arm and a leg but it really just comes down to moments and laughter and experiences and

[09:53] I think we've all realized that significantly especially in this hobby where we're at the center

[09:59] of everything we talk about is a very expensive item and it's the people that make this hobby

[10:07] truly tremendous and you don't need to buy a ton of pinball machines to have a magical connection

[10:14] to this community and that is the beautiful thing about pinball. Look at me I don't even really

[10:19] play much pinball and I've got such a beautiful connection to so many people in this hobby.

[10:24] Talks what's up brother I'm thankful for a lot more than usual every day.

[10:28] Yes absolutely it's um there's um you know sometimes it's hard to get that clarity and peace

[10:37] that we're all searching for because we're just so distracted we're on to the next we're on to

[10:42] the next we're thinking about you know so far down the road that we we sometimes really have a

[10:48] hard time especially in modern culture just to stop enjoy something put on knives out movie and

[10:55] just watch it like don't get distracted I'm gonna say something I'm gonna do a podcast about this

[11:01] I'm gonna say something right now that's gonna be very uh controversial in our space

[11:11] because I just watched season one I'm almost done I just need like one more episode but I actually

[11:17] think I'm gonna say this and I mean this I think Fallout could make a great pinball machine

[11:27] they're there I said it now I'm not gonna go through all of my reasons why I'll do that on my

[11:32] podcast but after making it our way through my way through Fallout season one uh yeah I think

[11:41] I think it's got way more potential than John Wick and then Venom I think it's uh I think everyone should

[11:48] watch it and keep an open mind and that's the part I think that's really hard for this pinball

[11:55] community is to just keep an open mind if I were to tell each and every one of you a year ago if

[12:04] I if I had known the theme of Winchester's mystery house most of you would have slammed the door on

[12:11] the the pin right you would have slammed the door on the pin if you just knew the theme and sort of

[12:17] like we're slamming the door and Fallout because we know the theme it's freaking Fallout by Keith

[12:23] Delwin maybe and when you think about that world and the subject matter the music everything I'm

[12:34] gonna go through my reasons why I think Fallout could actually end up being a tremendous pinball

[12:40] machine if done right I mean right now it's at the point now where Stern has to do it right and

[12:47] they have to check all the boxes because people are not they're not going in on these Stern games

[12:54] right now and it's uh it's it's a brutal time for them they they are really struggling they are

[13:01] really struggling oh man you know I'm looking at my my neighbor shoveling his pathway and I just

[13:12] want to be sitting I sat by the fire with my dad and then we just had some nice conversations about

[13:17] life and you know I really do the more I hear from my father and and people who have who grew up

[13:26] before the internet before the chaos of today I they're perspective to me now means

[13:34] so much more than than what it did even like 10 15 years ago I really think there is a desire to

[13:40] get back to something that that has forever been stripped from culture and and I think a lot of

[13:47] people I was thinking about this this morning you know we all need to now think about and your

[13:52] kids do if you have kids who are especially in school it is now a creator culture like you either

[13:59] create or you're like a slave you you know what I'm saying and and my definition of a creator culture

[14:09] a plumber creates a working toilet and sink you know what I'm saying like your skill you're you

[14:16] have a skill that creates something that people want and I think that's the big shift I'm seeing in

[14:23] the world is so much of what people study there's not you know I don't know if there's like an outlet

[14:30] to create something of value so I really do you know I really do appreciate all the pinball

[14:36] manufacturers out there that that work really hard every week to create machines and allow us to

[14:40] create content on top of that give us the options what we're going to talk about it we're going to go

[14:46] around the horn and we're going to talk about all this stuff so let's where do we want to start

[14:53] let's start at um let's start somewhere unique so I saw this hexapimbal three musketeers

[15:05] yeah I apparently they showed this trailer at expo I must have missed it maybe they did a seminar

[15:12] that I did not attend and people are saying it's like AI generated slop and it's no thank you

[15:22] and I've been thinking about what what pathway forward to some of these smaller companies have

[15:31] in the world of pinball and do they need to always have a licensed theme or is there still an

[15:39] opportunity to have a niche bootie company find success in pinball and I think it's really hard I

[15:47] think the real like difficult thing is you know how do you land on a price point that's attractive

[15:59] compared to everything else you can buy in pinball at that price right because it's not just

[16:06] new in box like let's say they make three musketeers and it's I don't know six thousand dollars

[16:13] is that game going to be better than any stern pro and now for six thousand dollars you can go get

[16:19] like a dialed in a toy story four like you can go get a guns and roses at least right so I just

[16:26] I don't know how you survive unless what you make today is as good as everything else that someone

[16:36] else could buy at that same price point in pinball heart the top the masterpiece of space on so

[16:43] that that's kind of like where I'm at with the whole thing it's just you know there's a lot of

[16:47] effort that goes into it there's a lot of work that has to happen you know to get a game to market

[16:53] um finding a license to agree to let me design out in the open has been a challenge right so

[16:59] Jack is Jack wants to do like kind of like an open source transparent design of a pinball machine

[17:08] and you know Jack it's like that would be really exciting but you know the challenge is I think

[17:15] Jack what you should do is just I think what's hard for Jack now is because he's officially at stern

[17:20] I would just say just do it you know I'm saying like like if you're just doing a one-of-one

[17:28] custom-made game why not just do whatever you want to do and ask for forgiveness later um

[17:37] I think it's probably difficult because of Jack's official affiliation with stern

[17:42] but it's um you know it's it's no longer to me uh you know exciting to have like 15 companies

[17:55] tank rope design um you know that like let's let's count let's see how many pinball companies

[18:01] we can count because I think I've lost track let's start on on on on my fingertips so we got stern

[18:08] we got jersey jack we got spooky right we got CGC we've got hexa pinball that's five we got pinball

[18:19] brothers we got Pajready we got Dutch pinball I'm not going to count Dutch pinball axis

[18:26] as a separate company we've got home pin they're still out there we've got multi-morphic all right

[18:33] that's 10 we got barrels of fun we've got um turner pinball we've got

[18:46] who am I missing that's 12 so far we've got I know I'm missing someone

[18:55] pinball adventures are they do they even count I don't know ramps pinball you know I mean what's your

[19:01] pass what's your pass like five you know American pinball that's right American pinball may be like

[19:08] 13 or 14 um the Spanish name was was like quetzal right like quetzal pinball they made the

[19:19] basketball game they made I think they made like a fast and furious game they made a remember they

[19:24] made that captain Nemo game who who was around when they made the captain Nemo game remember that

[19:30] those days um you don't even see like I haven't even seen anyone stream that damn thing I did say

[19:37] turner haggis is done so you know there's like so many companies and you know to the point of like

[19:47] imagine trying to secure a license when you're going up against like Leonard Abyss you know and

[19:55] and stern and I think it's interesting I am so shocked I don't know how they did it I don't know I

[20:03] I don't know how spooky secured the licenses they have the licenses they're going to make

[20:09] um what a blunder by the other big dogs to sort of sleep on some of these nostalgic properties

[20:17] that are absolutely um what people want it's you know if we think Beetleju is sold out it

[20:24] instantly goonies will do the same gremlins will do the same I don't know if it's South Park or

[20:29] something else francey will tell us if it's not South Parky francey is the ultimate

[20:34] you just just shuts down every false rumor instantly like I'm just going to say this I don't think

[20:42] I don't think American pinball is ever going to have a successful pinball machine I hope I'm

[20:51] wrong I hope I eat my words I just don't think that they have the front office that understands

[20:59] pinball I don't I don't think Mukesh and company they think about it think about think about

[21:06] an organization that actually invested in the individuals they invested in I don't even want to

[21:11] name their names but think about what that's who they had faith in so they're a bad judge of

[21:20] character they're a bad judge of talent so I don't think American pinball is all of a sudden

[21:26] now good to like figure it out thank you for the $10 Don H is this Donald Donald the

[21:37] uh reveal yourself which Donald are you um yes stern uh George Gomez has gone on the record

[21:51] for uh yeah there's there can be only one Don always is arcade okay welcome um

[21:57] is stern George went on the record and said nobody wanted to make the Edelgeuse

[22:03] I mean I you know I'm like a dead horse on this whole topic of stern passing on

[22:09] beetle juicing back to the future what was probably the biggest mistakes they've made in marketing

[22:16] history to pass on beetle juicing back to the future and green light venom and John Wick you have

[22:25] to like understand the enaneness of that decision and how you know because again like if you get

[22:32] back to the future you can make it forever you know I'm saying they would they would have been

[22:35] selling back to the future premiums for a decade

[22:47] well you guys want to hear something I I am hearing through the rumor mill and I don't

[22:52] franchise scene it because he's working on it but I've been hearing through the rumor mill that

[22:58] back to the future just needs a little something extra needs a little bit more magic mechanically

[23:04] put into it I I wonder I don't know if I wonder but I worry a little bit I worry a little bit about

[23:15] you know Barry and team they just don't have a lot of experience

[23:22] and this is the part that I think is going to be challenging for Dutch as they design back to

[23:27] the future is there they're not a company that's been constantly evolving and improving

[23:37] and you know getting better because they haven't had more than one game and you know big

[23:46] Lebowski amazing game 13 years ago doesn't hold a candle to the newer stuff that's just you know

[23:56] from a design standpoint from a theme integration I mean it's a great team integrated game don't get

[24:02] me wrong but you know what I'm saying it's like imagine if Lebowski was Barry's first game and he's

[24:10] made six others to get to back to the future so I worry about that I worry that they have in you

[24:21] know and they're in a vacuum you know they're not focus group testing this thing they're not going to

[24:26] whitewood it before they so I get I just I've heard a few things from people that have played the

[24:33] whitewood I just I just want to say I got to talk about this in a little bit of a round about way

[24:41] but the what I heard was and again it's probably hard to stand over the whitewood of a game you know

[24:49] there's no art there might not even be like assets on the screen to just see the whitewood I mean

[24:55] you take any game and you strip away all of the color and all of the you know stuff I mean you might

[25:01] not even have like all the next in place or all the this or that but yeah I'm just hearing it might

[25:09] need a little bit more so you know time will tell because here's what's gonna happen

[25:22] you know again I think Beetlejuice has raised the bar

[25:27] Sonic is gonna is gonna be insane

[25:32] um it is based on the Sonic uh Sega game it's not based on the movies I I know something about Sonic

[25:44] that I'm gonna I'm gonna wait to tell my podcast listeners um I'm very very excited about Sonic

[25:54] I Sonic is gonna be it's it's it's Sonic it's Tails it's it's it's it's the whole crew here let me um

[26:07] yeah it's Ryan McQuay to be part of the design team no no you shouldn't

[26:17] no no I'm I'm full confidence in Steve Richie I don't think Steve Richie needs to learn anything

[26:23] from Ryan McQuay about how to design Sonic Himball nope nope sorry Ryan sorry it's in better hands

[26:36] um franchy art on Sonic I don't think so franchy um I don't know if you worked on it or not I don't

[26:42] think franches on Sonic but it it's gonna um I've a few things I'll tell you guys

[26:52] exclusively on Sonic on my show well but trust me gang like let me see if I can find like uh like

[27:00] Sonic hedgehog

[27:09] I'll tell you like let me let me see something here

[27:23] I'm trying to find like

[27:43] it's just it's I don't know it just looks like we remember Sonic art I'm looking at Sonic images

[27:51] I was signed on the do Steve's next game but bailed after I thought about it I then signed

[27:58] exclusively with spooky um yeah so look I know that Jersey Jack wants to get everything you I mean

[28:09] you get a remember these this is a company that is spending close to half a million dollars just

[28:14] to get the Harry Potter John Williams theme song into the game so I don't think uh Brett and Leonard

[28:21] are gonna stop until they get everything that they know you want into Sonic the hedgehog

[28:34] yeah I think it's gonna have the original music everything so you know so look I um

[28:39] should we open up this spooky box should we open it up let's open it up

[28:46] ah so spook what do you think's inside here from bento Wisconsin

[28:52] I've got a gift I got to send my friends at spooky I have to go to FedEx and spend it special so it

[29:00] doesn't break I mean Sonic's not I think it's gonna have a loop de loop I think it's gonna be the

[29:11] from what I heard it's the fastest pinball machine ever

[29:15] from what I heard when you plunge this game you're all gonna want one instantly

[29:21] I know I need something to open this with hold on

[29:27] packages so well

[29:31] there we go

[29:37] and

[29:42] if they hot glue gun this thing shut

[29:47] that's right it's Don's laundry oh man

[29:52] I

[29:54] um

[29:56] I can't wait to the beetle juice is start going out I think they're gonna start going out in

[30:02] January which is gonna be really exciting

[30:07] you know what I think's gonna happen with beetle juice is I don't think many people are gonna

[30:10] be selling their spots I think beetle juice is gonna become I think I keep saying this beetle

[30:16] juice and Harry Potter are gonna become the foundations for every every new pinball collection

[30:23] because I think both those games kind of make everything else feel a little dated and old

[30:28] when you see like Harry Potter next to Godzilla like it's embarrassing like I'm embarrassed

[30:34] you know and I know when we see beetle juice next to like Godzilla and jaws are gonna be like

[30:40] you know like it's not to say that like it's not to say that like jaws and

[30:44] Godzilla they're amazing games they're absolutely amazing games they just look really cheap next to them

[30:50] and they're just something about it like I don't know like once you have this beautiful

[30:56] these beautiful new games it's hard to to justify the cost of these turns they're looking

[31:03] really cheap all right so I got a nice note here I'm gonna oh my god I can already tell already

[31:10] this isn't gonna be a very thoughtful gift because I just saw something deer Cholores family

[31:16] I like that not the Canadian family married Christmas and happy holidays from the spooky crew

[31:23] I was out black Friday shopping and I saw the sparkle smash puzzle on the shelf and just

[31:30] knew the boys had it just knew the boys needed it hope you have an amazing Christmas and even better

[31:39] new year love the spooky crew this see this is it you know like when I talk about

[31:47] when I talk about modern day hospitality when I talk about company culture when I talk about

[31:55] how important it is to connect to the community this is like this is it like and and again the reason

[32:03] I love the spooky crews it's just so authentic to them and they're so nice

[32:11] it helps that they make really good games now too you know it would really it would really

[32:16] I would be conflicted if they were so nice and they were still making games like Rob Zombie you know

[32:22] I'm saying so like I'm really happy that now our love affair with with the spooky crew is backed up by

[32:30] games we love like it's so it's so awesome where it's like opposite with Stern it's like

[32:36] the people are kind of annoying now and like yeah everyone's in a while there's a good game but like

[32:41] in general like yeah like I just don't I'm not vibing with those people anymore oh my god look at this

[32:48] it's a sparkle smash puzzle you know this is so this is so amazing

[32:56] Killian loves sparkle smash and he loves puzzles so to have both of them together is absolutely

[33:03] the grigor I love that it's in this like carry on like he because he can use this now he can use

[33:08] this to like put other stuff in you could like bring this to school thank you so much

[33:14] and there's a post a note that says four killian with the heart they put a heart on it

[33:21] you never heard of sparkle smash monster jam baby we've been the monster jam twice and I will

[33:28] say the second time we went sparkle smash wasn't there and he was gutted it wears sparkle smash

[33:34] it's there's nothing more painful than a little boy who goes to see a monster truck show and his

[33:40] favorite monster truck is not there and then for Cassian Paw Patrol oh no now you know too Cassian

[33:49] loves the color and this is amazing this is a Paw Patrol color and sticker kit you know what

[33:57] kids worlds are blown blown away just any new gift they get so excited well thank you so much

[34:06] team spooky emery bug Luke Don francey all you guys I literally I literally couldn't I couldn't

[34:16] create a better company vibe than you guys have I'm absolutely you know it makes me it makes me

[34:26] want to tear up it really does thank you so much they're gonna love these um let's get back

[34:36] well you see the good will right you see the good will and and I've been saying this for a while

[34:40] it is now at a point where I would never buy an American pinball game because of the way that

[34:45] company has treated me personally I would never buy a CGC game because the way that company treats

[34:51] its own customers I would definitely buy a stern game again for sure like I love a lot of people

[34:59] over at Stern I would absolutely buy another game from Jersey Jack um I would buy a game from

[35:05] J.J.P. I think there's just like but but all of it is like we now get to decide who we want to

[35:12] support I would absolutely buy a game from Dutch pinball Melvin's one of my best friends uh you know

[35:18] it's where do I who do I want to support it's not just enough anymore to to just make a good game

[35:25] like you you people are buying into a brand and this is something I've been saying for a while

[35:30] and this is what Stern got so damn wrong is they they torpedo their own brand

[35:38] and by turning their back on their own loyal customers by rerunning things they said they never would

[35:46] they it's so stupid Stern made the dumbest mistake ever they put growth at any cost as the priority

[35:56] and I think we all live in a world now where we're tired of this that every company should be

[36:05] making moves only because more money could be had not because it's the right move to make

[36:12] and this is like what's been driving Stern and their private equity investors is like grow grow grow

[36:18] 3000 games ordered by Costco for Pokemon that may be true and if you sell 3000 games to Costco that

[36:27] may be good for your bottom line but it's bad for your brand you know I'm saying it's still bad for

[36:34] the brand of Stern because like it's almost like they should have a sub a sub brand not even

[36:41] Stern pinball that makes those games you know because it just it cheapens everything and it's hard

[36:48] to sell a 13 thousand dollar version of something that looks almost too close to the thing being sold

[36:53] at Costco for five when you put Star Wars at Costco I mean it almost looks it looks similar enough

[37:02] to the 13 thousand dollar Star Wars game and so the the approaching these companies as brands

[37:13] is imported you know I will say this I think Jersey Jack as a brand is about to do something

[37:22] that is probably long overdue they're about to kill FOMO for their own products and they're going

[37:31] to only make products that you're going to want to buy and own and not buy and worry about the

[37:38] resell value of it and you're not going to you're not going to see a lot of of their games be offered

[37:44] up for resell because they're goals to make games that make you not want to sell it you know so when we

[37:53] see when we see Sonic the CEs will also be unlimited now the marketer on me that just wants to

[38:03] like preserve some value and you know make there I need to turn off like my notifications hold on

[38:09] the second I have like notifications on my on let me close out this new computer it's it's

[38:19] giving me notifications for messages let me force creep that okay all right um you know so when

[38:30] you remove the FOMO you instantly you kill all the scalping you you you don't you don't

[38:38] annihilate the second hand value um it also just like I don't it just it kind of resets everything

[38:49] you know I like I like a two approach world of Pimba I like where spooky will have

[38:57] the FOMO crazy secondhand prices what why can't I close out of like the phone messages I don't

[39:08] understand it's gonna keep popping up hold on a second yeah I need to like figure this out it's

[39:13] like and my annoying brother will literally just text everybody options remove from dog

[39:23] I don't know how do I stop he literally has like text messages with him set like no one respond

[39:38] he just like spams us all day long um so yeah I think we're gonna get I think we're gonna get

[39:51] FOMO for the spooky games I think we're gonna get maybe some FOMO from barrels and then JJP

[39:57] we'll just get you you know you want one you want one of these high-end sonics or Harry Potter's

[40:02] we'll get you one you know what to worry about not getting one we're not gonna we're not gonna

[40:06] lock you out you know because the margin for them is great it's a lot of money but they're giving

[40:12] you a lot more for the CE I kind of like that right and then it it does beg the question

[40:19] where does that leave stern and I'm just gonna say this I think Stern's three tiered model is what's

[40:28] now dead I do I just think Stern's you know Stern Stern's trying to have it all at once now

[40:38] and it's just not gonna work like I just don't think they're gonna be able to sell their L.E.s

[40:42] for 13 let's let's not call it an L.E. for 13 with all the accessories Stern is trying to sell

[40:49] 14 to 15 thousand dollar games they just don't make a 14 to 15 thousand dollar product they're

[40:55] they're just no way around it it's like it's like hardstop when you see a Stern machine with

[41:01] raspberry pie with their their lighting system their art package their cabinet art decals it just

[41:08] does not look like it's a penny over 10 gram it just doesn't look that good when I see Stern I see

[41:18] $5500 pro I see a $7500 premium and I see a $9500 L.E. like I that's I don't care what their cost

[41:30] are I that's that's what their games look like and so I just don't think

[41:38] their model works at like 7 10 and 13 which is really again you don't even get a

[41:47] topper for the $10,000 freaking premium I mean the new cabinet everything they've done spike

[41:55] three was a cost-cutting measure like imagine this imagine cutting costs making your product cheaper

[42:04] and having to spin it as an improvement it's only an improvement to the to the private equity

[42:12] investors that are looking for better margins but nothing about the new cabinet seems like an

[42:17] improvement the lighting doesn't seem much better the screen is a little bigger but that's not a

[42:22] lot of money yeah the sound's a little better but because you but it's also because they're just

[42:25] sound was so bad they're just such cheap speakers and also like when you look at how much speakers

[42:32] cost come on gang like this is there is not you know when you think about it's a $3,500

[42:40] difference $3,500 difference between the Stern premium and an L.E. go look at what TV you could get

[42:48] for $3,500 you could get a PS5 and one of the best Samsung TVs and a prostitute for the price

[43:01] difference between a premium and an L.E. and it's just comical like like we're not going to ask like

[43:08] oh is it worth and and the moment no one cares anymore like as the community like nobody looks at

[43:15] anybody with a Stern L.E. anymore with any like any envy Jersey Jack then all is in the house baby

[43:24] Jersey Jack what's up guys who's hey who's doing the handle these days at Jersey Jack

[43:30] love you guys um you know I have a I have a great relationship with JJP and and and it's an

[43:39] it's an intimate relationship and and you know I never really disclose anything we talk about

[43:46] and and I respect that and I and I really look forward I look forward to all of you seeing what

[43:53] they're working on okay let's just say that um but it's um it's about to get real real interesting

[44:02] in 2026 and again I think Stern just needs to do what I've been suggesting I think they need to do

[44:08] what Cal has been suggesting I think Stern needs to do a focus group with about 10 people I think

[44:14] they need three content creators three operators um three tournament players and I think they need

[44:22] to bring us in and they need to really listen and we'll listen to them what their realities are

[44:30] but I think they really need to listen and just say hey in your world what are we doing right what

[44:38] are we doing wrong what do we need to improve upon right and just go and ask everybody I mean

[44:44] probably like maybe it's like I would have like two collectors maybe two content creators like

[44:49] you know what I'm saying like but they just need to bring in their audiences because they have

[44:55] multiple audiences and they need to like hear from them you know it's crazy as I look at um you

[45:03] can get a business class plane ticket from JFK to Tokyo right JFK to Tokyo for around like

[45:12] 4,000 4 to 5,000 I would much rather do that than the difference between a pro a premium like

[45:18] literally a pro and an LE the difference is $6,500 yes you can absolutely fly from New York or

[45:26] wherever you are in America to Japan for cheaper than the difference between a Stern pro and an LE

[45:32] and I will tell you this right now you will and you will enjoy your life way more if you don't buy

[45:39] an LE you buy a pro and you go to Japan I guarantee you if you go to Japan because you use the

[45:46] difference between an LE and a pro you will thank me for the rest of your life that you made that

[45:53] decision or you know it better yet just go to Japan because you'll come back and not keep buying

[46:00] every single new Stern machine because you'll see what real quality is real craftsmanship is real

[46:06] attention to detail is when you go to Japan you know you know what I'm saying ain't no IKEA cabinet

[46:13] you know they tried to sell us on the brackets are an improvement you know I'm saying like

[46:19] they George legitimately with a straight face tried to tell us that this is a better cabinet

[46:26] with a straight face it's it's it's smoother it's straighter it's easier to get the decals on

[46:35] it's easier to manufacture it's easier to make you know if something's damaged yet it's

[46:41] easier to replace one of the sides but it's still cheaper it's raspberry pie and the damn thing

[46:48] the raspberry pie is like 30 bucks remember when spiked through these computer systems people are

[46:54] like what's got an HDMI out they started celebrating that it had an HDMI out as a as a as a feature

[47:02] a thirty dollar raspberry pie can't make this stuff up you can't make this stuff up

[47:16] I mean you know I don't think they had a plan you know if I'm

[47:24] the problem with Gomez I'm reading some of your comments I think is every time he talks he makes

[47:29] it sound like Stern's issues are our problem and not Stern's problem yeah a hundred percent

[47:34] agree with that the problem with every time George explains stuff is is the end user doesn't care

[47:44] like you know I'm saying I don't care what challenges you have with the licenseer

[47:50] you know I don't care like if making cabinets is hard find someone to make them that is warranting

[48:01] a thirteen thousand dollar price but you can't do it like this the truth is we all know the reason why

[48:11] everything is the way it is now it's Stern they just they have too much pressure on them to pay

[48:17] for all those employees and they they they grew so big that they need a volume now that is

[48:25] is in conflict to making like high end pinball right something that's justified in the bright so

[48:35] I just think they they got too big they scaled up so large and now they need to manufacture that

[48:44] kind of demand to justify them being at that size and I think it puts them under so much pressure

[48:50] that I think that ends up creating a toxic work environment I'll tell you this I don't know

[48:58] the future holds but the moment any company is just fixated on growth at all costs at the cost

[49:06] of creativity the that's the moment the culture just gets killed

[49:16] it just is because then you become like bottom line thinkers and bean counters and you never stop

[49:23] hearing about it and the people cracking the whips aren't the ones who are actually creating

[49:30] the value they they just they're just whip crackers

[49:40] but the issue really is like the the alternatives just became so good you know what I'm saying

[49:48] like the alternatives became so good that to me it's all like Stern's got like a lot worse like

[49:55] let's let's be honest people Stern machines didn't really go from being amazing to crappy like no

[50:02] no no no no just everyone else got so much better you know I think people forget that like

[50:08] Joe's is still an amazing bit should write it's an amazing bit but it's the kind of

[50:17] it's weird all right we're back now what you know what you know what happened

[50:26] it it it weirdly connected to my neighbors Wi-Fi

[50:33] well yeah and court you know court just said King Kong is great right but it's like a great $80

[50:40] $80.000 at a league that's the thing oh it's like so it's like you know you know and that's

[50:47] the problem Stern has is like King Kong is a great $80.500 at a league maybe $95

[50:54] and it's not a great $13.000 or L.E. it's just not you know and and you know when you look at

[51:04] Beetlejuice for 10 you're like what's 10 this thing looks like it's 15 if if if these Sterns are 10

[51:12] and that Stern's 13 with no topper and that Stern with the toppers 14 6 if that Stern fully

[51:21] accessorized is 15 yeah so Jack said it man and Jack I this is what I'm saying is like everyone's

[51:30] like everyone's making great pins now and now it just becomes like 67 which one do I go with

[51:38] you know which one do I go with like you know like it's crazy right like Doom if Doom came out 10

[51:44] years ago didn't would have been the best machine I'm planning it or 10 years ago it really would

[51:51] have you would have been blown away movie as it is like sound like the mech this is like Doom comes

[51:57] out today and there's like it's it's it's suffers from you know relativity like the things that's

[52:03] relative to just excite you more but no one who wants to do and is having a bad time this is the

[52:09] thing right it's like yeah you know what I'm saying like I know what it's like to have a pinball

[52:14] machine that doesn't shoot well Guns and Rose right I know what it's like but I get I understand

[52:20] Guns and Rose is like what it does well it does very well but again it's not a great shooter and I

[52:25] you know I know it's like to have a clunky machine that has like some of the best team integration

[52:31] ever Lord of the Rings right Batman both of those Lord of the Rings and Batman

[52:37] I maybe two of the best codes in the history of pinball I think if you were to say like

[52:43] name me two games where the code itself is so damn good it's worth owning Batman and Lord of the Rings

[52:50] 100% both games are clunky clunky games they don't shoot great I think Lord of the Rings is better

[52:59] mechs for sure I mean jaws is another one the code isn't sane right jaws isn't doing anything

[53:07] like mechanically interesting but the code isn't sane people are saying James Bond is like that

[53:16] but you know you like with some of these games like Jawsman you wanted jaws like let's you want

[53:21] a jaws do you need to own like 15 other games if you have a jaws in a Harry Potter tell me you're

[53:27] not good just just think about that for a minute let's let's throw three in let's just throw

[53:34] let's just throw the three best games from these three if you want to jaws a Harry Potter

[53:39] a jaws 50th a Harry Potter CE and a beetle juice are you telling me you're waking up being like

[53:45] I need another game that's what's crazy is those three games are probably better than 98% of pinball

[53:56] ever made ever made I look I don't have the room if you have the room god bless you but I also think

[54:15] you know you don't really have time to get through like 15 games 10 it's a lot I mean right now

[54:23] my Xbox I play three games I play UFC I play FC 25 or 26 the soccer and then and then maybe

[54:36] like a shooter that's it like I don't I don't you know Xbox has got hundreds of games like use three

[54:47] you know but each their own man I mean look some people have like like Joe Newhards got a damn

[54:52] church filled with product although Joe Newhard did post something recently that was not

[55:00] act your writ yeah I miss some stuff in here yeah spooky stickers baby I think I'm going to stick

[55:12] this on my computer you got the franchy logo I want the one with the the hard on

[55:30] said boys got a jaws premium OG Twilight Zone six pins currently look okay so here you want

[55:41] to know what was inaccurate and I saw I saw when this was posted and people were like wait what that

[55:49] means like demands over that means like we're gonna start to see them go for less money

[55:56] so Joe said something I think it was Joe again but basically like got Harry Potter C.E.s new

[56:03] inbox ready to ship out like no there's no Harry Potter C.E.s right now sitting at Distros unsold

[56:16] anywhere you know but when you write that it makes people it it it telegraphs that like the demand

[56:24] is now softened to the point where they're sitting at Distros there are none at Distros Joe does

[56:30] not have them new inbox and you know are you trying to get orders and then you know because like yeah

[56:40] call them up and see if you can have one in two days you're not getting it my point is that the

[56:46] Harry Potter demand is still strong I think they've made I want to say 1800 C.E. so far

[56:54] yeah everyone's still waiting I mean Chad I think stern lighting is is embarrassing next to

[57:10] next to barrels next to spooky and next to J.J.P the stern lighting system is still like looks old

[57:16] I'm worried about an ACDC remake I mean that that's apparently what's next my guess is that

[57:26] stern is is now second guessing everything and with walking dead remaster being in a in a

[57:36] bismill seller they have to be someone has to be held accountable for for green lighting that game

[57:47] no when that when I saw in the new Star Wars next to Harry Potter gang I saw a game that looked

[57:55] half as like look like it should be half the price and I'm talking like Potter this is

[58:04] what Potter wizard edition right the Ellie versus a 13,000 dollar stern Star Wars Ellie

[58:16] and just stern just looks so cheap I don't I don't get it I wouldn't want to be the cheap the

[58:24] cheap looking thing you know what's annoying too it's like well why can't they just make the

[58:29] cabinets look better like why did we have this amazing cabinet decal with Batman SLE right the

[58:36] the three-dimensional embossed decal it looked great what they've never fully done it to that extent

[58:43] ever again you're telling me that decals are expensive it's just again spike three needed a

[58:51] complete overhaul and it was more of a cost-cutting you know one step forward two steps back I feel like

[58:57] and and what's funny is you can see now why they never had a spike three launch moment

[59:06] because they knew they didn't have anything they really pulled a curtain off on you know you don't

[59:11] do like an apple iphone launch moment if the new iphone is cheaper than the old one

[59:16] if the cat if the camera's worse right the features aren't all better it's bigger screen but

[59:23] you know but less battery life you know I feel like that's what stern realized was well we can't

[59:29] do like a spike three here it is because here here it is isn't that impressive

[59:40] jersey jack does not have ghost buses by the way I can confirm that

[59:47] they they they do not moving forward they're not going to go back and remass like remake games that are

[59:53] already out there everybody let's see we got about 25 more minutes I would love to open it up for you

[01:00:05] guys to ask any questions if there's anything you want to talk about I know I've been stuck on a few

[01:00:12] things here I know there's other stuff going on in pinball but I'm happy to talk about any topics

[01:00:18] you guys would love to to converse on a goonies is definitely spooky and maybe barrels so what I do

[01:00:29] know is that you cannot have the exclusive license for goonies but making two goonies is idiotic

[01:00:40] so whoever gets to market first is gonna win it would be weird right I mean look I guess what's

[01:00:51] interesting is maybe that's not accurate what I just said because imagine this if spooky makes a

[01:00:59] thousand goonies and they sell out instantly which they will there's gonna be a thousand people that

[01:01:06] want the game that didn't get one easily and then barrels like we got one too I heard barrels is

[01:01:15] doing they definitely are remaking that pinball circus game I heard from David you know I they're

[01:01:23] not they're definitely not gonna make 500 of them I think if they do make that pinball circus game

[01:01:30] I think we're talking very limited run of it I mean like 50 to 100 that he knows they're not

[01:01:37] gonna sell 200 of those things absolute novelty I think they might have a really high price tag but

[01:01:44] completely tiny volume and then never ending story was what I heard is the the next game from them

[01:01:55] what are some fringe themes you think would work for pinball outskirt IPs that may be more loose

[01:02:05] Jack you know I think stuff like blood sport I think the last starfighter I'm just I'm just throwing

[01:02:13] out stuff that I think might might work the movie rad the BMX movie rad I think gleaming the cube

[01:02:22] I'm just naming some stuff because like you make it gleaming the cube it I think there's there's

[01:02:28] like that level of like campiness of 80s movies that weren't blockbusters or early 90s that still

[01:02:36] could be fun masters of the universe to me is not fringe it's huge so masters of the universe is

[01:02:42] gonna be the biggest movie released that Mattel has next year it's not fringe um you know I would

[01:02:51] start with stuff like that I think you get into some um yeah I'm wondering

[01:03:02] I also do think and get don't kill me I do think Alfred Hitchcock movies is something I would

[01:03:11] look at right probably easier to get all the assets I think I think rear window and psycho would

[01:03:18] be the ones I start with um I also think that clue would be interesting I think um like an agatha

[01:03:33] Christie again I'm just trying to think of stuff again I'm going off of of what Winchester's

[01:03:41] mystery house had this like campy vibe to it police academy is a good one spawn yeah spawn

[01:03:51] I also think like again this is not fringe but if I were to do a Batman I would look at Frank

[01:03:56] Miller's the dark night and make a pinball machine based on on that but I think that would be hard

[01:04:04] to do and these are just a lot of things I mean I'm in due and I was in due when I was a kid

[01:04:11] I'll never choice um yeah I think there's um you know there's a lot of like let me see let me pull

[01:04:21] up like like 80s you go like 80s cult classic movies you know

[01:04:29] let's see what comes up

[01:04:40] all right the last dragon is a good one you know Bruce Lee Roy

[01:04:46] I don't think true romance is fringe because it's like a all-ever stone terrentino movie like

[01:04:52] that's expensive especially with those actors um like the lost boys here's what's coming up

[01:04:58] last dragon the outsiders weird science um let's see escape from New York let me do images

[01:05:15] you know like the burbs how are the duck

[01:05:21] big trouble in little china

[01:05:23] yeah let's see I'm trying to think like what's which ones are like cult

[01:05:34] hmm you know like porkeys

[01:05:44] but yeah I mean there's a lot

[01:05:46] and you know I think um I think we need more of it like monster squad you know we just need more

[01:06:03] so from from what I can tell I mean I hear transformers is shaping up to be the better like a

[01:06:11] banger so we'll see right now my my enthusiasm to see the next stern machine is probably the lowest

[01:06:22] it's ever been so I don't um space balls is great I you know I don't know like I what I love about

[01:06:30] stern is at least we know we're gonna get one every four months like a new cornerstone which is

[01:06:35] not a lot right it it's like we wait four months for it it comes out we spend two months complaining

[01:06:41] about it and then before we know it in two months we get a new one you know it's like right doesn't

[01:06:46] it feel like Star Wars has been out for four months it's it's it has but the time goes quickly

[01:06:52] was turned because it creates such you know debate it creates such conversation also like for a lot

[01:07:00] of us like we just never bought them I think a lot of people just never haven't been buying these

[01:07:06] these games like they used to yeah I mean I yeah Khan feels like it's years old right Khan's

[01:07:12] only been out for like a year I mean it's the Keith Owens last game it feels like doesn't it feel

[01:07:19] like Khan came out before Jawz almost because we got Jawz 50th this year which became like the talk

[01:07:25] of the town so I you know I don't know man it's um you know my money is marked safe from a lot of

[01:07:32] this I mean Kang Thighards never happened and Bruce Willis the States never gonna license it

[01:07:41] um what other question you guys got hit me ask Canada anything

[01:07:47] I'm Bucker Fruit Bonsai how about Cannonball Run

[01:07:56] right how about some of those like weird um I think Magnum P.I. would be cool I think a Magnum P.I.

[01:08:03] pen I think Miami Vice man why is there no Miami Vice Pimball Machine man you do the whole like

[01:08:12] 80s like Miami vibe man that'd be amazing what about Scarface I mean Scarface is way better for

[01:08:21] Pimball than Godfather what is the one game that you really want to be made yeah if I if I

[01:08:35] had to be completely honest it would be Transformers G1 the movie and then it would be the Fifth

[01:08:42] Element then it would be Big Trouble in Little China and then Akira in that order so G1 Transformers

[01:08:51] the movie the movie though not the G1 series Fifth Element Big Trouble in Little China and then Akira

[01:09:05] do you have any details on Transformers it features Autobots and Decepticons I'm sure they got

[01:09:19] was a Peter Cullen to do the voices see I'm all about like Campiness now like like you know

[01:09:27] I'm saying like someone said Matlock but I mean I know there's something about going Campy

[01:09:36] right sort of like the monsters was sort of um you know like a Charles and charge Pimball

[01:09:44] like a like a family ties Pimball Machine there's just something about

[01:09:48] Peewee's playhouse you know like just Campy stuff that could just could work Jerry Springer

[01:09:57] would actually be kind of funny but the Moripovid show would be funny you know what I'm saying like

[01:10:04] like you are not the father like you have to to go through the different iconic moments of the

[01:10:10] Moripovid show and and get like the best reactions to not being the father again I'm just talking

[01:10:18] like weird what is this I can't wait to play it see what happens

[01:10:27] yeah the I mean the office would be great the office would be great

[01:10:36] traffic thunder yeah that would be a good one

[01:10:39] so I'm probably be terrific I don't I don't know man I think we're kind of music pinned out I think

[01:10:50] Michael Jackson for sure I think M&M and I think Phantom of the Opera the the Angeloid Weber

[01:11:04] the fact that there's not an Angeloid Weber there's not an Angeloid Weber like Wicked Angeloid Weber

[01:11:13] K-pop demon hunters I mean the thing I like about Broadway shows more than just like

[01:11:21] acts is there's a storyline that goes with them all and that's where it gets kind of boring to

[01:11:27] me we just do like another music pin but if you do Phantom there's a storyline if you do demon

[01:11:34] hunters there's a storyline if you do you know I don't know I just think it's that's where music

[01:11:41] pins to me get a little old over time because there's no storyline run and stumpy yeah I mean

[01:11:50] the transformer soundtrack it's amazing Iraqi 4 would be amazing oh Billy I don't all right

[01:12:00] everybody I'm gonna we're gonna end this a little bit earlier today because I'm going to go play

[01:12:07] a few games with my boys and then we have to shovel ourselves out and we're gonna go get a nice

[01:12:13] family brunch I just want to say from my family to yours I'm so happy you guys are here I hope

[01:12:22] you all had a very happy holidays happy Hanukkah Merry Christmas whatever you're celebrating I hope

[01:12:28] you have a great new year I think it's gonna be an amazing year in Pimble I'm not going anywhere I

[01:12:34] may try and sell you a few pins here and there but you'll see how that will work it's gonna be fun

[01:12:39] it's not gonna be it's not gonna ruin this show it's not gonna turn me into a show you'll see I

[01:12:44] think you're gonna laugh when you see how it's all gonna work I am gonna figure out how to get

[01:12:48] these five Beetlejuice machines to club members that will happen sometime in the new year but I think

[01:12:56] bigger than all these games bigger than all these companies is the community and the connection this

[01:13:02] community gives each and every one of us and I think that is where the value always lies I think

[01:13:07] there's an inordinate amount of money spent on things that aren't gonna bring you more Pimble friends

[01:13:14] they're not gonna give you greater conversation and I really do encourage each and every one of you

[01:13:21] to really show support to the companies that are are going the extra mile I think the times of

[01:13:27] mailing it in and cutting corners and cost cutting measures are over and I think we are in a new

[01:13:33] golden age of pinball where the stuff that hits this year is gonna be like wow and it's not gonna be

[01:13:40] stuff you're you're not gonna be talking about resell because you're not gonna want to resell these

[01:13:43] games you know what I'm saying like I don't I don't talk about like how much am I gonna get for all

[01:13:47] these things I buy Brenda because when we get divorced I'm gonna have to sell some of this stuff

[01:13:51] no I'm never divorcing Brenda like this is it you know so I think we all just want Pimble machines

[01:13:57] that don't make us want to talk about resell we don't want to talk about how much money we're losing

[01:14:02] because we won't lose a penny if we never sell these things and I think that's some of the part

[01:14:07] of the Canadian haters don't get we talk about the market and we're shocked by the the extraordinary

[01:14:14] losses people have been having on some of these games but the only reason those games have had

[01:14:18] extraordinary losses is because they're not great games or they were significantly overpriced to

[01:14:26] begin with and talking about that is not a negative it is just using common sense right if you love

[01:14:32] Kong Elleave you can go get one now for nine so you save four thousand dollars maybe cheaper even

[01:14:40] make sense I mean I want to hang out with the community that's looking out for each other

[01:14:45] not a community that's like shilling everything and just saying everything is awesome from all

[01:14:49] these companies and you should just like you know just blindly hand over checks stupid I want to see

[01:14:56] you guys have balance I want to see you guys get your money's worth Castlevania's awesome everybody be
