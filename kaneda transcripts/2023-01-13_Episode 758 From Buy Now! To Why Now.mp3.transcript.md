[00:00] Time has to spell on you, but you won't forget me.

[00:10] I know I could have loved you, but you won't let me.

[00:18] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the world's favorite pinball podcast to 523

[00:31] people who are on the Canada club.

[00:33] Thank you everybody for being a member.

[00:35] We are going to talk about a topic today as we discuss the hobby as a whole, as we discuss

[00:41] the different manufacturers.

[00:42] And that topic is simply this.

[00:45] the mood shifting in pinball from buy buy buy to why why why.

[00:53] I think we're all starting to ask ourselves these questions more and more.

[00:57] Why am I buying this game?

[01:00] Or more poignantly, why do I not want to buy this game?

[01:05] Because I think all of us out there who are pinheads, we really want to feel compelled

[01:10] to buy every single pinball machine that gets revealed to the world.

[01:16] And for many years, it was really hard to resist, right?

[01:18] It was really hard to resist.

[01:21] Those Halcyon days of old, when we had nothing but game after game after game, that was a

[01:27] great theme, that had a lot in it, that had beautiful artwork.

[01:32] And look, not every game was a hit, not every game was something we really had to own, but

[01:37] over the last six to seven years.

[01:40] There always was that magical game each year that restored our faith in the new and box

[01:46] pinball world.

[01:48] Now the problem is this, you have to constantly keep innovating and evolving and keep upping

[01:55] what you put into your products or else people will get bored.

[02:01] People will get tired of every single new reveal.

[02:04] If each new reveal doesn't elevate our expectations, doesn't elevate what can go into a pinball

[02:11] machine, doesn't elevate the theme and the theme integration and the artwork and the

[02:16] light shows, you know, for this much money, and I think that's what I've been noticing

[02:19] with everybody, for this much money, why do I need to own this game?

[02:26] And I think people ask that about James Bond.

[02:29] I'm hearing James Bond sales are really weak.

[02:31] I think people ask that about Toy Story 4 and I think the majority of people cannot

[02:36] answer that question.

[02:37] Why do I need to own a Toy Story 4?

[02:40] Why would I spend $15,000 on a Toy Story CE?

[02:44] Why would I spend $12,000 on an LE?

[02:47] Why are Stern premiums now $10,000 basically?

[02:51] Why, why, why?

[02:54] And the more we're asking why about this hobby, I think the more and more, most of us are

[02:59] finding a place of solace and the place of solace is simply this.

[03:05] If I wait and see if this game is going to be worth it, then I will be in a much better

[03:12] position to answer the question, why do I want to own this game?

[03:19] But if we jump in and we let FOMO make us commit to buying a game, before we can answer

[03:25] that why question, I think people are just fatigued by the amount of people telling you

[03:30] to buy everything when it comes out.

[03:33] Those days are over.

[03:35] And I think if you wait and see and you wait and play a game, that will put you in a much

[03:40] happier place in pinball.

[03:42] That's where I'm at right now.

[03:44] It's going to take a lot for me to buy a new and box game again.

[03:48] The other thing I think we're going to see more and more of in pinball is simply this.

[03:52] I think we're going to see a lot more trading of games.

[03:56] I think we're going to see a lot more people go and buy games that we know for sure are

[04:02] great games.

[04:03] We know for sure we enjoy this game.

[04:07] Now we don't all enjoy everything, but there is a lot of really good pinball out there.

[04:13] If you go on the pinside marketplace and you want to fill your house with 10 great pinball

[04:19] machines, you can go get 10 great pinball machines that there are no question marks around.

[04:25] Now if you want to chase every single new and box game that comes out, I think you're

[04:29] going to end up really disappointed for the most part.

[04:32] I think you're going to end up losing a lot of money.

[04:34] I think you're going to end up taking a really big risk.

[04:38] And I think that's the thing is I think people are just getting tired of taking the risk.

[04:43] We don't talk about it a lot, but a lot of people got burned on their deposits for toy

[04:48] story.

[04:49] A lot of people got burned on their deposits for spooky pinballs last game.

[04:54] And look, there are some people that will run right into the fire again.

[04:57] I'm already seeing someone list a Scooby Doo spot for $1800 or best offer.

[05:04] Scooby Doo number 607, I will lose $200 if you want my spot or best offer.

[05:10] That means he's willing to lose even more than 200 bucks.

[05:13] Look, $200 is nothing in the grand scheme of things because if you order to Scooby Doo,

[05:19] you're going to be writing spooky pinball a check for like $10,000.

[05:24] But the question remains is this, why would anybody buy Scooby Doo already?

[05:29] You don't know the game is going to be good.

[05:32] You don't have a past precedence of the coder doing anything magical in Bimbal.

[05:37] In fact, the majority of people, the silent majority would say spooky pinball still needs

[05:43] to prove they can get their quality up.

[05:46] They need to prove they can engineer mechs that are really exciting.

[05:50] They need to prove they can make a game that has good flow.

[05:53] They've got a lot to prove with this game.

[05:55] And look, I'm rooting for them.

[05:57] But I think the fool is the person with the sun behind their back that walks over the

[06:03] cliff and orders a game before even seeing any of those things come to fruition.

[06:09] So I'm waiting on the sidelines.

[06:11] A lot of people are waiting on the sidelines.

[06:13] Now, distributors don't want you to wait on the sidelines anymore.

[06:16] They want you to buy the game.

[06:17] They want you to buy the game so that when they mail their money to spooky,

[06:21] they already have a customer lined up.

[06:23] And I'm just saying, I think people are starting to move away from that behavior.

[06:27] Instead of buy now, it's why now?

[06:30] Like why would you order Scooby Doo right now?

[06:34] You don't know enough.

[06:35] You don't.

[06:36] I'm not saying it's not going to deliver the goods, but you just don't know.

[06:40] You know, and I think the other thing, you know, why now?

[06:43] Like why would anyone buy a $20,000 James Bond 60th anniversary game?

[06:50] Why would you buy it after Stern Pimball lied to us in their reveal video?

[06:55] I just saw this interview with the guy over at Stern.

[06:57] I forget his name.

[06:58] He said something at CES that just made me laugh.

[07:01] He said, if you want the ultimate gaming experience, and he's saying this at CES,

[07:06] where all the big video game companies are at.

[07:09] If you want the ultimate gaming experience by a Pimball machine, is he out of his mind?

[07:15] Like I love Pimball to no end, but there is no way in the gaming world,

[07:21] Pimball is a better gaming experience than what's on Xbox and PlayStation.

[07:27] And this is the delusion now.

[07:28] I think Pimball is reaching this point where so many people in it and in the industry and

[07:33] in the media and at the companies and at the distro level,

[07:37] so many people have been drinking the Pimball Kool-Aid for so many years.

[07:43] They're starting to say stuff like Pimball is the ultimate gaming experience on the planet.

[07:49] Let's not say silly things like that.

[07:52] The reason I love Pimball, and maybe you think I don't say it enough,

[07:55] I love Pimball because I don't like a digital world.

[07:59] I don't like a world in which gaming is always remote.

[08:03] I don't like a world in which everything is just on a screen.

[08:07] I love Pimball because it's a physical game.

[08:10] You can't digitize Pimball.

[08:12] When you stand over a Pimball machine, it is so much fun looking down at this

[08:19] physical analog world under glass that I get to play.

[08:24] And I love the randomness of it.

[08:27] I would argue, yes, Pimball is more fun than Donkey Kong.

[08:30] It is more fun than Pac-Man.

[08:32] Those older arcade games are very repetitive and they get old very fast.

[08:37] But Pimball is not more fun than Call of Duty to me.

[08:41] It's not more fun than Halo.

[08:43] It's not more fun than modern video games.

[08:45] And that's just my personal opinion.

[08:47] And the great thing about modern video games is just for a few hundred bucks,

[08:51] you can experience the best the world has to offer.

[08:55] Where Pimball gets comical is now the most expensive Pimball machine of all time,

[09:00] this $20,000 James Bond, I would argue is one of the most simple and basic.

[09:04] And there's no way that is the greatest example of Pimball in 2022.

[09:08] We should be embarrassed that that is the price or 2023, whatever year you want to

[09:13] consider this game coming out, even though it came out last month.

[09:15] And if you go on Pinside, you know what everyone sounds like on Pinside?

[09:19] They sound like this.

[09:21] My father says everything's negotiable.

[09:24] Pee-wee.

[09:25] I wouldn't sell my bike for all the money in the world.

[09:28] Not for a hundred billion million trillion dollars.

[09:31] Then you're crazy.

[09:33] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:34] You're a nerd.

[09:35] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:37] You're an idiot.

[09:37] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:39] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:40] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:42] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:43] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:45] I know you are, but what am I?

[09:46] Infinity.

[09:47] No, I'm not.

[09:48] You are.

[09:49] No way.

[09:51] Knock it off.

[09:52] Cut it off.

[09:53] Oh shut up.

[09:54] Pee-wee.

[09:55] Why don't you make me?

[09:56] Why don't you make me?

[09:57] Because I don't make monkeys.

[09:59] I just trade them.

[10:00] Sons of bitches.

[10:01] I mean, listening to these grown men spend the last week and a half arguing back and

[10:18] forth on this game after Stern lied to us, after we could see how ugly the game is, after

[10:24] we could see that this thing has nothing really special.

[10:27] I was listening to another podcast in which they mentioned for $20,000 maybe Stern should

[10:33] make the screws by the LCD screen that's on the play field because the border is all

[10:38] black.

[10:39] They were mentioning that the screws should be black.

[10:42] And heck, yes, they should be black.

[10:45] For $20,000 the screws there should be black.

[10:49] But you know what they said?

[10:50] They said that they probably are not black because of the cost.

[10:55] The cost of making screws black.

[10:58] We are now making excuses for these companies.

[11:01] It's at the point now where I think everyone is just waking up out of the COVID coma, out

[11:08] of the price frenzy and realizing the reason why the screws aren't black is because Stern

[11:14] doesn't care about the details.

[11:18] Stern doesn't care to actually make the cabinet artwork more interesting.

[11:24] Stern does not care.

[11:26] And the screws are a great example of that because the screws themselves would not need

[11:32] license or approval.

[11:35] And Stern doesn't care that they false advertise.

[11:37] I didn't even talk about this on my last show, but they said it was exclusive the topper.

[11:42] And then they said it was exclusive because it's included in the purchase of the 60th.

[11:47] They lied to us.

[11:49] They lied to us.

[11:50] And then they tried to spin it.

[11:52] So look, I think all of this is starting to sort of drag people down into this space.

[11:59] Instead of buy now, it's why now.

[12:02] I tell you another example where I just think people are starting to lose excitement because

[12:07] nobody's excited to spend 15K on a Jersey Jack machine.

[12:11] And nobody's really excited to spend 13,000, let alone 20,000 on a Stern pinball machine.

[12:17] I put up what date Jersey Jack pinball number eight is coming out to the world.

[12:22] It's coming out February 20th.

[12:25] Okay.

[12:26] Now, normally that would be a huge reveal.

[12:28] It would be something totally everyone would talk about.

[12:31] Canade is reporting that Jersey Jack number eight is coming out February 20th.

[12:36] I'm going to ask one of you who's listening to this right now, who has the guts to go

[12:41] on the pin side and actually start a thread that says, Canade reporting JJP number eight

[12:47] 220.

[12:49] Do me a favor post that.

[12:51] I'll send you a canada mug.

[12:52] I promise you.

[12:53] Okay.

[12:54] But here's the thing.

[12:55] Even after having it on my page, nobody's talking about it.

[12:58] It's like nobody cares.

[13:00] Everyone's worried it's going to be Godfather.

[13:02] Everyone already knows what the price is going to be.

[13:04] And that's creating an overwhelming lack of enthusiasm for this hobby.

[13:12] And here's the thing.

[13:13] And I get it.

[13:14] Like you guys are like, Canada, you're beating a dead horse.

[13:16] Canada, you're being negative again.

[13:18] No.

[13:19] What I'm trying to do is just tell you the vibe I'm feeling.

[13:22] And there's only one way out.

[13:24] There is literally one way out of this.

[13:28] All these manufacturers, all these companies, they've painted themselves into a corner.

[13:33] And the only way out is if they make amazing games.

[13:38] And that's the silver lining in all of this.

[13:41] That's what keeps me excited to see what happens in the future.

[13:45] Because if your game is not amazing, if it is mediocre, it will be dead on arrival.

[13:51] I'm hearing from distributors.

[13:53] Nobody's ordering Queen Pinball.

[13:55] It is dead on arrival.

[13:58] You're not going to get people to cut you a $10,000 check if the game itself doesn't

[14:03] elevate, doesn't innovate, doesn't take it to another level.

[14:08] Think about any other industry.

[14:10] In what other industry can you release a product that's not even as good as products that came

[14:16] out five years ago and then charge 40% more?

[14:20] I mean, just think about that.

[14:22] Are you buying a TV that's not as good as your old TV for 40% more?

[14:26] And that's what's been happening in Pinball.

[14:29] You can't fool us anymore.

[14:30] Our love affair with chasing every new inbox is gone.

[14:34] I mean, it's gone, man.

[14:35] You can see it, man.

[14:37] Disturbs are going to start to get really desperate as times get leaner.

[14:42] You're going to see more and more of them starting to unload used games, right?

[14:47] Buying from other people and unloading other products because I know you really want an

[14:50] Iron Maiden.

[14:51] I know you really want a Ghostbusters.

[14:54] I can't convince you to buy a James Bond because you don't see the value there.

[14:58] But I know you're going to want these classical games.

[15:01] I think we're going to see more and more distros become used, pinned salespeople if they want

[15:06] consistent revenue because when they announce Galactic Space Force or Godfather or Foo Fighters

[15:13] or Venom, are people going to run through the door?

[15:16] If 2023's big titles are Godfather, Venom and Foo Fighters, the answer is no.

[15:22] You know the answer is no.

[15:23] I mean, come on.

[15:24] At least go make the A team.

[15:26] I mean, the A team is a better theme than the Godfather for Pinball.

[15:30] I can't imagine it's that hard to license the original A team TV show.

[15:35] All right.

[15:36] Let's quickly go around the horn and see what's happening in the Pinball world.

[15:39] So, Stern Pinball, everybody hates them right now.

[15:42] They lied to us.

[15:43] They misled us.

[15:44] I still haven't forgiven them and they need to ask for forgiveness.

[15:47] James Bond sales are nowhere near where they thought they would be.

[15:51] Spooky Pinball, probably the most exciting post of the week.

[15:55] They showed us they have Scooby-Doo manufacturing beginning.

[15:58] We saw a lineup of cabinets.

[16:01] We see them working on the playfields.

[16:03] This game is about to go on the line any day now.

[16:07] They hired the voice actor that's been doing the Scooby-Doo voices over all of these years

[16:12] and supposedly he will be giving us those 4,000 custom callouts.

[16:17] The only question I had when they announced that he's joining Team Spooky, I thought they

[16:23] already recorded the 4,000 callouts and that's why they used it in their marketing materials.

[16:28] So I hope they have a lot of this game already coded because the moment Spooky shows this

[16:35] game, they must know deep down inside that this code needs to be pretty good.

[16:40] This can't be Baron code like Halloween and if they show this game and it looks like there's

[16:45] a ton of work that needs to be done, you're going to hear 1969 people go, RUH RUH, what

[16:52] did I do?

[16:54] I should have listened to Canada.

[16:55] I should have waited to see if this game is going to deliver for this much money and I'd

[17:00] tell you this right now guys, I'm just going to be candid.

[17:02] If you waited on the sidelines, you're going to be able to buy a Scooby-Doo for less than

[17:07] MSRP.

[17:08] You're going to be able to get one cheaper than anyone who bought it directly from Spooky

[17:13] or directly from a distributor.

[17:16] Times have changed people.

[17:17] Wake up.

[17:18] 1969 games.

[17:20] It's not going to be rare.

[17:22] It's not going to be hard to find and the code's not going to be done at launch and that's

[17:26] going to make people buy it, realize they don't want to wait and then they're going to sell

[17:30] the game for less than sticker and you heard it here first.

[17:33] It's not being negative.

[17:35] It's just that there's too many pinball companies now.

[17:37] The prices are too high and most of us are just fed up and the scalping is dead.

[17:42] All of these companies killed the scalping.

[17:44] There's no more second hand value to be had in any of these games and now we have to wake

[17:49] up to that reality.

[17:50] That was not the reality over the last 10 years and it's going to hurt the sales tactic

[17:54] of FOMO and when that goes away, the whole buy-buy-buy mantra is going to be dead.

[18:01] People are going to wait and see and they're going to listen to Canada and they're going

[18:04] to sleep better at night.

[18:06] Okay.

[18:07] So Spooky Pinball ready to go.

[18:08] Haggis Pinball.

[18:09] They're getting more fathoms out the door.

[18:12] Did you see this mistake by this week in Pinball with the Twippies?

[18:16] They left Fathom Pinball off of the ballot for the Twippies.

[18:22] I don't understand how you have a committee of people who is in this hobby.

[18:28] This is like Steve Bowden.

[18:30] The people on this committee, they should know better.

[18:33] I don't understand how you don't realize that Fathom Pinball is shipping this year for the

[18:39] first year ever and it should be included in certain categories.

[18:44] Now that being said.

[18:45] Do I expect Fathom Pinball to win a Twippy?

[18:49] No.

[18:50] And it's real simple because not enough people have it.

[18:53] Not enough people have seen it and the Twippies is a popularity contest and the more people

[18:58] that have the game, the more people that have played the game, you're more likely to get

[19:03] those votes.

[19:04] And so yes, why I think it was a boneheaded move to leave it off of the ballot.

[19:09] I don't think it's going to change anything.

[19:13] But come on.

[19:14] At what point are these guys going to realize maybe Canada should be on the committee and

[19:19] then we'll announce that he's ineligible for a Twippy moving forward.

[19:24] Just give me the Lifetime Achievement Award and let someone else have it next year.

[19:29] But this year, I'm putting on the cargo shorts.

[19:31] If you haven't voted yet in the Twippies, this is the last weekend to vote.

[19:36] So make sure you vote Canada for Fathom Pinball Podcast and Fathom Pinball Streamer.

[19:40] I much appreciate all of your support.

[19:43] Tag is pinball.

[19:44] Chicago Gaming Company, we're still trickling out Cactus Canyon LEs.

[19:49] The thing I don't understand about this company is this.

[19:52] Where is the Lyman Sheets Code?

[19:54] Poor Lyman has been gone for a long time now.

[19:58] What's happening with this code?

[20:00] What is going on?

[20:01] Why would it take an entire year, even without Lyman, to finish what he worked on?

[20:07] How much did he even work on?

[20:10] There's been no communication around this.

[20:12] There's been no timeline around when this code is going to drop.

[20:15] And it's really disappointing.

[20:17] I think that's the only way I can describe CGC and the way they've been communicating

[20:22] this game.

[20:23] It's just an utter disappointment.

[20:26] Let's go over to Dutch Pinball.

[20:29] Because if you've been in the Dutch thread and you're seeing what's going on with Dutch

[20:33] Pinball, it is Mirko Playfield Nightmare all over again.

[20:38] It is the same exact thing that happened with Guns N' Roses owners.

[20:42] There's a batch of Mirko Playfields that are now pooling, they're chipping the artwork,

[20:48] and it's really bad.

[20:49] And it's really, really bad.

[20:51] And I don't know how many strikes does Mirko get?

[20:54] Before us, as a community says, I refuse to buy any pinball machine that has a Mirko

[21:02] Playfield logo on it.

[21:05] This company, and I mean Mirko, this guy is a joke.

[21:11] And he's making millions of dollars, people.

[21:14] Do the math.

[21:16] Imagine if he ships 5,000 Guns N' Roses Playfields to JJP.

[21:22] How much money out of that 5,000 units do you think he makes per Playfield?

[21:29] And he's been making Playfields for JJP, for Dutch Pinball.

[21:33] He's made thousands and thousands of Playfields.

[21:37] They don't all have issues, but hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them have had issues.

[21:44] And when this clown makes a mistake, does he send you a replacement Playfield if his

[21:49] Playfield falls apart?

[21:51] Nope.

[21:52] I've got to buy it again.

[21:53] And I'll tell you this, when Jersey Jack sells me a replacement Guns N' Roses Playfield

[21:58] for 500 bucks, they're paying Mirko that 500 dollars.

[22:03] We're just selling it to me at cost.

[22:05] So that's the most painful part about it, is Mirko's making money again.

[22:11] He's making double the money on his own mistakes.

[22:14] We need to wake up.

[22:16] The guy's a squirrel.

[22:17] He doesn't deserve our money or our support.

[22:21] Anybody out there who's at pinball company should be looking for a new vendor to make

[22:26] these Playfields.

[22:27] Alright, so thank you, Mirko, for giving us this nightmare once again as everyone now

[22:33] searches for washers to put under their big Lebowski posts.

[22:37] Alright, what else is going on?

[22:39] We covered off on Spooky.

[22:41] Jersey Jack, game number eight, what we know is it's probably Godfather, it's Christopher

[22:45] Franchi, it's Eric Minier, and it's coming out in just about a month.

[22:50] And it seems like nobody cares.

[22:52] And look, I mean it when I say it.

[22:53] Jersey Jack marketing.

[22:55] Wake up, people.

[22:57] If it's Godfather, let us know now.

[23:01] Rip the band-aid off.

[23:03] Let everybody complain for a few weeks.

[23:05] They'll get tired of complaining.

[23:07] There's only so much you can complain about pinball unless you're Canada.

[23:13] And then you can complain for seven years straight.

[23:15] Alright, everybody, so what else is going on?

[23:17] We've covered off on those companies.

[23:19] Well, look, we also know we're getting a new game from Stern.

[23:21] I said we're all upset with Stern right now.

[23:24] And the other question will become, in March, will it be Venom?

[23:27] Will it be Foo Fighters?

[23:29] It's not going to be back to the future.

[23:31] I wonder what it's going to be.

[23:32] I think it's going to be Venom.

[23:33] I'll tell you why.

[23:34] I think Venom's been done for a really long time.

[23:37] It's been done for over a year.

[23:39] It's Brian Eddy game.

[23:41] It has a big mech in the middle of it.

[23:43] And it's also a zombie Eddy game.

[23:45] And I think after this ugly James Bond game, Stern is going to hit with an absolutely knock

[23:54] out of the park.

[23:55] Gorgeous zombie Eddy game.

[23:57] Now, the big question is this.

[24:00] How do you sell a $13,000 Venom?

[24:05] And how do you make $1,000 of them at that price?

[24:08] I think what we're going to see, if Stern wants to sell Venom for $13,000, I think they're

[24:13] going to have to get back to making the limited editions actually get ready for it.

[24:18] Are you sitting down?

[24:20] They need to actually make them limited.

[24:22] I think we're going to see.

[24:23] I would bet Venom should be like 400 Lees.

[24:26] Like if you're going to do Venom, do not do 1,000.

[24:29] Do not even do 500.

[24:30] Make it 400.

[24:32] Make it somewhat rare and exclusive.

[24:35] We need to get back there.

[24:36] I think all Lees and CEs need to be 500.

[24:39] I think there still needs to be like some FOMO with the collectible version of the game.

[24:45] The 1,000 units was too much of a jump.

[24:48] It was way too much.

[24:49] I'm going to think about it for a minute.

[24:50] Jersey Jack went from 500 Guns N' Roses CEs to 1,000 Toy Stories.

[24:58] I mean, stupid.

[24:59] You don't double the amount of something.

[25:01] That's not an incremental increase.

[25:04] Like absolutely boneheaded move.

[25:07] The funny part is this.

[25:08] The only way Toy Story CEs ever would have held value is if they made 500 or less.

[25:15] The moment we saw 1,000 was the moment they killed the collectability of the game.

[25:20] I mean, think about the irony of that.

[25:23] These own companies are killing the collectability of their collector versions of the game.

[25:30] James Bond 60th.

[25:31] Let's just talk about this for a minute.

[25:33] Here's what I think James Bond 60th is going to be worth in a year.

[25:36] Are you ready for it?

[25:37] Stern's going to make all 500.

[25:40] Distros are going to sit on them forever.

[25:42] I think this game a year from now will sell for $12,000.

[25:49] And I think it's going to be $12,000 or less.

[25:52] If you buy one of these games now for 20 or 22, you're absolutely going to lose your shirt.

[25:59] And I don't care if you're the world's biggest James Bond collector.

[26:02] I don't care if you take a bath and $100 bills.

[26:06] Nobody who's rich wants to buy something that's supposed to be collectible and rare and sort

[26:12] of exclusive.

[26:13] Nobody wants to buy something only to realize they could have got the very exact same item

[26:19] and save themselves thousands and thousands of dollars.

[26:23] This thing I'm telling you right now, this game will never be special.

[26:27] It will never be sought after.

[26:29] It will never be something we talk about in a positive light.

[26:35] It's never going to be that.

[26:36] We are never going to look at this game with adoring eyes.

[26:40] We're just never going to do it.

[26:41] All right. Am I missing anybody in the pinball world?

[26:44] We covered off on Stern, JJP, Spooky, pinball brothers.

[26:48] We talked about how nobody is ordering Queen Pinball.

[26:51] That is truth. American Pinball and Multimorphic.

[26:54] Let's cover off on the final two companies that are actually making pinball machines.

[26:58] So Multimorphic, Weird Owl.

[27:01] Where are the Weird Owls?

[27:02] They are still slowly trickling out.

[27:05] So not a lot of news there.

[27:07] It will be interesting to see if Weird Owl wins any Twippies.

[27:11] I was thinking about it.

[27:12] Like what Twippies could it win?

[27:13] It could win for best music.

[27:15] It could win for, I don't think they even have best callouts.

[27:18] Maybe best animations.

[27:21] Maybe best topper.

[27:22] I don't know, right?

[27:24] It's another game where like, I don't even think they've made 50, let alone 100.

[27:29] Stern Pinball is making 600 games a week.

[27:32] So there's almost no way Multimorphic can win anything.

[27:36] And I know they feel like they deserve it, but they need to get these games to customers.

[27:40] They need to figure out manufacturing.

[27:42] All right, let's talk about American Pinball last, but not least, American Pinball.

[27:48] Seemingly, the Nordman game is coming out sometime soon.

[27:52] But once again, I think AP is missing a golden window because think about it.

[27:57] If Stern has a new game in March, Jersey Jack has a new game in February.

[28:02] Just think about those two companies alone.

[28:04] Between those two games, let's say you want to buy both of them

[28:08] and you buy the next JJPCE and you buy the next Stern LE.

[28:12] Add that together now.

[28:13] During a global recession, that is really coming people.

[28:16] It is really going to happen, people.

[28:18] So those two games will set you back with tax.

[28:21] Are you ready for it?

[28:22] 15,000 plus 13, 28,000 dollars for two machines.

[28:29] Add some tax to that.

[28:31] Over 30,000 dollars if you want to buy

[28:35] the nicest version of both JJP and Stern.

[28:39] This crazy, this hobby is absolutely crazy.

[28:41] And then American Pinball is going to come out and sell you a game around nine

[28:46] to ten thousand dollars.

[28:47] Are you really going to go 38, 39,000 dollars if you want three pinball machines?

[28:53] This is crazy.

[28:54] If you want to buy just three pinball machines now at the top trim level,

[28:59] it is now $40,000.

[29:01] Think about that for a minute.

[29:02] 40 grand for three machines.

[29:05] It wasn't that long ago.

[29:07] Stern LE's were 7,500.

[29:10] You could get three machines for around like 22,000 dollars.

[29:14] We've doubled the price.

[29:16] This hobby has doubled the price.

[29:19] And that is why no one is saying buy now.

[29:22] The thing we're saying is why now?

[29:25] Why now is pinball twice the price of what it used to be just a few years ago?

[29:32] Why now are pinball machines this expensive and we're not even close to

[29:37] getting the magic in these games the way we used to?

[29:41] It's just getting ridiculous.

[29:43] And I'll be here to cover the vibe of this hobby.

[29:46] I think we need a miracle game.

[29:48] I think we need a magical miracle game that restores all of our faith in

[29:53] pinball.

[29:54] Bring out diehard, bring out matrix, bring out top gun, bring out big trouble

[29:59] in little China, bring out the A team.

[30:01] I don't know, maybe the A team is not a great example, but bring out something

[30:05] that when we look down on it, our eyes, they just pop open and we're like,

[30:10] oh my gosh, I can't believe you did that.

[30:12] Look at that innovation.

[30:13] Look at these shots.

[30:15] I can't wait to find a distributor to give my money to because this company

[30:19] just knocked it out of the park.

[30:22] Nobody is saying that with James Bond.

[30:24] Nobody said it with Toy Story.

[30:26] Nobody said it about any game in 2022.

[30:30] And we need a game in 2023 that makes us feel that way.

[30:33] Everybody, thank you for being a member of the Canada Club.

[30:36] Back with more shows because you know you love to hear Kadeida tell everybody

[30:42] that nobody's ordering Queen.

[30:45] Later.

[31:00] I'll follow you down to the sound of my voice will hold you.

[31:08] Give me just a chance.

[31:11] You will never get away.

[31:13] You will never get away.

[31:16] You will never get away.

[31:23] You could be my silver spring.

[31:28] My blue green colors flashing.
