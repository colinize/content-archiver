[00:00] But my name I cannot sign.

[00:05] Why?

[00:06] Do you mean to deny this confession when you are free?

[00:09] I mean to deny nothing.

[00:11] Then explain to me why you will not...

[00:14] Because it is my name!

[00:18] Because I cannot have another in my life!

[00:24] I have given you my soul.

[00:26] Leave me my name!

[00:30] Cactus Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts

[00:33] Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon,

[00:34] Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts

[00:35] Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon,

[00:36] Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts

[00:37] Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon,

[00:38] Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts Canyon, Celts

[00:39] it was going to be Labyrinth.

[00:41] It's Labyrinth.

[00:42] I said it was going to be David Van Es part of this company after he left Spooky Pinball

[00:47] because they wouldn't make Labyrinth and that's just what happened.

[00:50] We've also got Scott D'Nisi.

[00:52] We've got a whole list of people that are ex-Spooky Pinball employees that are part of this new

[00:59] pinball company, this mystery pinball company, which now we know the name and it is the worst

[01:07] name you could possibly pick for a pinball company.

[01:10] We're going to talk all about that on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:14] I want to look at this thing from a marketing perspective.

[01:17] How could you do all of this hard work?

[01:20] It is really hard work to make a pinball company happen all of the hours and the labor and making

[01:27] the parts and figuring out assembly.

[01:30] The easiest thing to do is just name your company something that you'd be proud of and

[01:36] what are they doing?

[01:38] But before we do that, I've got to introduce some new members to the Canada Raise the Roof

[01:44] Club.

[01:45] We've got our new members, Jeff Tersch.

[01:47] We've got Pete Rosen, who raised his membership in one single day to $30 a month and that

[01:54] wasn't enough for Pete.

[01:55] He then raised it to $50 a month.

[01:58] Steve Jablonski.

[01:59] Now, Steve is another one.

[02:00] He sent me an amazing note.

[02:02] Steve is like, look, don't insult my wealth with asking for $30 for the Omokase Club.

[02:08] Now he's up to $50 a month.

[02:11] We've got our Cade Time is up to $30 a month.

[02:14] Mike N.

[02:15] Sorry, I don't want to butcher your name.

[02:16] Mike N. is also raising the roof and upped his pledge to $10 a month.

[02:21] Yes, you get a shout out even if you just go from five to 10.

[02:25] Welcome, everybody.

[02:26] All right, so here's the deal.

[02:27] We now know that this company is making labyrinth.

[02:32] We know who's behind it.

[02:33] It's a lot of people in the industry that carry a lot of weight.

[02:37] They carry a lot of clout.

[02:39] They have a lot of respect by people in the pinball industry.

[02:42] And so look, I'm here to tell you right now.

[02:44] I'm excited to see this game.

[02:46] Now labyrinth is in a dream theme for me, but when I talk to people about the movie, you

[02:52] do get a lot of enthusiasm and excitement for the game itself.

[02:56] I do want to start out this podcast by saying, I think this company is doing a lot right.

[03:02] I like the fact that they did do this teaser campaign.

[03:05] I like that this game didn't leak.

[03:08] Like they really controlled the narrative on their own product.

[03:11] They didn't have any leakage of information.

[03:14] Everybody who signed an NDA around this game.

[03:17] And look at all the people involved with this game.

[03:19] And it didn't leak.

[03:20] Like I didn't, I wasn't talking about labyrinth six months ago.

[03:24] And yet I know a new title coming out from Stern Pinball that nobody knows about that

[03:28] I'm going to let you know about it in a month.

[03:30] Because I agreed to an embargo on when I could release the news.

[03:33] Now look, the news is not coming from Stern.

[03:35] They don't know I know this, but it's going to happen.

[03:38] And you're going to hear it here first on Canadian Pinball podcast, but they did a good

[03:42] job of keeping this thing secret.

[03:44] They kept it a mystery.

[03:46] And mystery pinball company became what this company was known as.

[03:49] And I actually think the mystery pinball company is a much better name than barrels of fun.

[03:55] We're going to go more into this title, but I want to start with what I think they did

[03:58] well first.

[03:59] I think the teaser campaign was fun.

[04:01] It was decently orchestrated.

[04:03] You know, they definitely piqued everybody's curiosity.

[04:06] What I like about what they're doing now, though, I like that they ripped the bandaid

[04:11] off the fact that it's labyrinth the way they did.

[04:14] Because as I said, if you don't have a theme that's like a take my money now theme, you

[04:19] might as well just let people in on it before you bring the game to the show.

[04:23] Like Jersey Jack Pinball is going to do the complete opposite.

[04:27] They're going to wait for the show to tell us is the theme that nobody really wants.

[04:31] They're going to wait to pinball expo, march in there and tell us it's Elton John, which

[04:36] we already know.

[04:38] And if they would just confirm it now, it would just allow people to voice their anger

[04:42] about it.

[04:43] And then by the time they bring the game to the show, everyone sort of lowered their expectations.

[04:49] And then the game itself can exceed those expectations.

[04:52] That's what I would have done with Toy Story 4.

[04:55] It's what I would have done with the Godfather.

[04:57] It's what I would do with Elton John.

[04:59] But Jersey Jack Pinball, they're like the definition of insanity.

[05:03] They do the same thing over and over again, and they expect different results.

[05:08] It's not going to happen.

[05:09] So I like the fact that they told us it's labyrinth.

[05:11] I like the fact that they gamified it.

[05:13] They brought the community in on it.

[05:14] I also like the fact that we're going to see the trailer for the game the Friday before

[05:19] expo.

[05:20] I think getting out in front of the show is super smart because they're now going to

[05:24] control the narrative.

[05:26] They're now going to be what everybody's talking about.

[05:29] They're now going to be the game when you go through the door at expo.

[05:32] They can be there right away.

[05:33] They don't have to wait to the pizza party to play the game because they've now shown

[05:38] you the game.

[05:39] You know what the theme is.

[05:40] You know if this company is all about.

[05:42] So they don't have to make everything happen at some sort of panel discussion pizza party.

[05:48] That party can now just be a party because the cat's out of the bag and we know everything

[05:53] about the game.

[05:54] I think that's super smart.

[05:55] I think it puts extra pressure on Jersey Jack pinball.

[05:59] I think it puts some pressure on the pinball brothers.

[06:02] I don't think anyone really cares about what pinball adventures elements that will be at

[06:06] expo.

[06:07] So I think that's all good.

[06:09] I think they assembled a lot of talented people that are on board with this company.

[06:14] I'm not going to name all of their names but the ones that jump out the most are Bo and

[06:18] Karen's Scott Denisi and David Vaness.

[06:22] These people are all ex spooky pinball.

[06:25] Now if you want to know a little bit of the backstory on why this all happened it's that

[06:29] David Vaness was disgruntled that they would not let him make a game.

[06:34] Like he wanted to make labyrinth at spooky pinball.

[06:38] And what happened was this.

[06:39] There was a period where Charlie was going to sell the company and the kids were against

[06:44] it.

[06:45] Like they didn't want their dad to sell the company.

[06:47] They didn't want like to lose what they had created.

[06:49] And instead of cashing out you know Charlie gave the company over to his children and

[06:54] they're doing what they're doing with the company.

[06:56] And look it's been successful for spooky pinball.

[06:58] The Emory family is receiving the lion's share of all that money they're making at

[07:04] spooky pinball.

[07:05] If David Vaness was to make a game he would make money for that game.

[07:08] Same way Scott Denisi made money for every Rick and Morty.

[07:11] And so the Emory family has kept spooky pinball close to the Emory family.

[07:15] And that's always been the trade off right.

[07:17] Because they lost a lot of the talented people that were over at spooky pinball.

[07:23] Seemingly because they did not want to pay those people what they are worth.

[07:28] And I think this mystery pinball company which we now know is the worst named pinball company

[07:33] and pinball with barrels of fun.

[07:35] Barrels of fun pinball now has all of these ex spooky talented people that are now making

[07:41] a game that is obviously going to be a direct competitor to spooky pinball.

[07:46] So now it gets real interesting.

[07:48] You know Scott Denisi and his music is going to be in labyrinth.

[07:52] That is super interesting.

[07:54] David Vaness and his animations super interesting.

[07:58] There's also one of the ex coders from spooky pinball that is part of this team.

[08:02] And Bowen Carons and his rules said now look Bowen and spooky do not get along.

[08:06] Recently spooky pinball had a block Bowen from their Facebook page.

[08:11] That's how heated it is.

[08:13] And look he doesn't hold back like he picks fights.

[08:15] He doesn't like me.

[08:16] I think he blocked me on Facebook too.

[08:18] So I don't really know what his deal is.

[08:20] But I do know that like he's a really good pinball player.

[08:23] Some people like his rules.

[08:24] Some people think the Rick and Morty rules are really shallow.

[08:27] So we'll see what happens with this game.

[08:29] I don't expect this company to be able to animate or code a machine as good as a stern

[08:33] pinball machine or a Jersey Jack pinball machine just yet.

[08:37] But they don't have to get that far.

[08:39] I think what people really want to see in this game is a world under glass.

[08:43] I think we're going to get that.

[08:44] I think it's going to be interesting to still see how many tears there are and how much

[08:48] money this game costs.

[08:50] All right.

[08:51] So look more to come on that.

[08:52] We're going to do a lot of shows about this new game.

[08:54] I want to talk about how do you freaking name this company barrels of fun.

[08:59] And that is the name people.

[09:00] It is barrels of fun.

[09:02] I don't understand why they didn't name this something that showed more respect for all

[09:08] the hard work.

[09:09] And here's the thing.

[09:10] It's like I hear people saying I just went on Facebook live and people are saying like

[09:14] it doesn't matter what the name is if the game is good.

[09:17] And I absolutely disagree.

[09:20] You have to make sure with a brand that you take it seriously and every detail of your

[09:25] brand matters.

[09:27] Everybody will tell you this.

[09:28] You have to go through every single thing.

[09:31] Like imagine a restaurant that served amazing food.

[09:35] Like you could have a Michelin star restaurant where the food is amazing.

[09:39] But if you name the restaurant like Wacky Packs which I think is you know Sonic Drive

[09:44] Thru's like Happy Meal name.

[09:46] If you name the restaurant Wacky Packs are people going to be excited to say they ate

[09:51] at Wacky Packs.

[09:53] Imagine if Porsche didn't call itself Porsche.

[09:56] It called itself like a car that's a lot of fun to drive.

[09:59] It's just weird to name it barrels of fun.

[10:03] And look at the pinball marketplace and someone was saying this on Facebook.

[10:06] It's a niche market so it doesn't matter what the name is.

[10:09] That's absolute bogus.

[10:11] This is the part where I think they're really going to regret this name.

[10:14] Like barrels of fun.

[10:16] So what's the abbreviation?

[10:17] Boff.

[10:18] Everyone's going to be calling you boff.

[10:20] And then think about it like this.

[10:21] When you go around pinball shows and stern pinball you see their employees with like

[10:26] really cool denim jackets and t-shirts and stern and stern pinball alley and sterns is

[10:32] a powerful name.

[10:33] Jersey Jack.

[10:34] Great name.

[10:35] Great logo.

[10:36] Right?

[10:37] It makes total sense why it's Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:39] I love that branding for that company.

[10:40] It's weird now that the games are made in Chicago but Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:44] I love the name of that company.

[10:45] Spooky Pinball.

[10:46] I love the name Spooky Pinball and the story behind it.

[10:49] How it connects to people.

[10:50] And you want to walk around a show and on your t-shirt, on your polo shirt, the entire

[10:56] team that works for your company has to walk around wearing a shirt that says barrels of

[11:01] fun.

[11:02] Let's just say you're at the bar and someone's like what do you do for a living?

[11:04] I make pinball machines.

[11:05] What's the name of the company?

[11:07] Barrels of fun?

[11:08] You know everything about it is just bad.

[11:11] And it disappoints me as a marketer because you really do only get one chance to name

[11:16] your company.

[11:17] I'm hoping that they come to their senses and change the name of this company before

[11:22] Pinball Expo.

[11:24] I don't think it's going to happen because their deals are signed under this name.

[11:29] It's on the trailer.

[11:31] This is it.

[11:32] It just doesn't show respect to the fact that this is Jim Henson's first pinball machine.

[11:37] It doesn't show respect to all the personalities that are a part of this company.

[11:42] It's not good.

[11:43] And with all these people that are seemingly very smart and understand this industry, how

[11:49] did nobody say what are you doing?

[11:51] Like really that can't be the name.

[11:53] This is like as bad as Haggis.

[11:54] It's as bad as Deeproot.

[11:56] I think it's worse than those.

[11:57] Like Deeproot and Haggis.

[11:59] I mean just saying those is not as bad as saying Barrels of Fun.

[12:02] It's like a statement.

[12:03] It doesn't feel like a company name.

[12:05] And so I know I put up on Facebook that I would never buy a pinball machine from a company

[12:09] called Barrels of Fun.

[12:11] And deep down inside I kind of feel that way.

[12:14] And I'm not trying to torpedo this company or their sales or like people's desire to

[12:18] own these machines.

[12:19] But I think they should really be ashamed of themselves calling the company this.

[12:25] And someone asked me like well what would you name the company?

[12:28] Well look, I mean it's not like I'm going to sit here and throw pinball company names

[12:32] at the wall.

[12:33] But a pinball company name should be derivative of like the people that are there, the founder

[12:39] of the company, and have some sort of storyline that goes with it.

[12:43] But you know what, when you name it something as silly as this, I don't even care what the

[12:47] story is.

[12:48] I don't even care what the cultural references to that phrase like Barrels of Fun.

[12:53] I think that's what they used to say about toys back in the day.

[12:56] This toy is a Barrels of Fun.

[12:58] But when people make decisions like this, it's like you're not taking into consideration

[13:03] your target audience.

[13:05] And this is the thing about marketing.

[13:07] Real good marketing removes the marketer from the equation.

[13:11] The end user is what people are thinking about and what the end user and what the buyer's

[13:17] feeling will be towards that brand.

[13:20] And you're telling me if you take some of the most iconic brands of all time and you

[13:23] gave them terrible names, you think those companies would be as successful?

[13:28] Imagine if Nike was called Comfortable Sneakers.

[13:31] Imagine if Apple was called Fast Computing Company.

[13:34] It just doesn't work.

[13:35] I think they're really going to regret it.

[13:37] I think there's going to be an outcry about the name.

[13:40] And I think they're going to feel embarrassed about it.

[13:42] And I think they're going to change it.

[13:43] I really do.

[13:44] I think they're going to change the name because I think they're going to hear the feedback

[13:47] and realize it's a huge mistake.

[13:49] And here's the other thing too.

[13:50] You buy a pinball machine.

[13:52] You're going to have that company name on the back glass on the translate on everything.

[13:57] And do you really want to look at a pinball translate and you see Stern, Chicago Gaming

[14:02] Company, Jersey Jack Pinball?

[14:04] These feel like brands that people want to be about.

[14:07] They feel like brand names where there's going to be fandom in a community.

[14:11] And then you see barrels of fun.

[14:14] It just kills me inside.

[14:15] They had all these people sign NDAs if they just came to me and said, what do you think?

[14:20] I would have told them right away.

[14:21] This is horrible.

[14:22] To the point of like, what would I name it?

[14:24] I mean, again, I would just name it something else.

[14:27] Like give it a name that's more about pinball.

[14:30] You could just call it the pinball company.

[14:32] You know, it's just a better name.

[14:34] You know, there's so many better names.

[14:35] You could call it Silverball Trading Company, whatever you want to call it, like Wicked

[14:40] Pinball, you know, like look at a brand like Liquid Death.

[14:43] Okay.

[14:44] Liquid Death is a billion dollar brand because they called it Liquid Death.

[14:48] It's just H2O in a can with some cool artwork on it that makes young kids feel like they're

[14:54] drinking beer, but it's water.

[14:56] Imagine if Liquid Death was called H2O, you know, like H2O, it's good water.

[15:02] Like it doesn't work.

[15:03] So that's just it on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[15:06] There's a lot more to come this week.

[15:08] I'm going to be doing a lot of shows.

[15:10] You're going to get sick of hearing my voice.

[15:12] Everybody look, I mean it when I say it.

[15:15] Pinsball's matter and this company worked really hard to make a game, to figure manufacturing

[15:20] out.

[15:21] And I'm just really disappointed that the name of the company, which is the easiest thing

[15:26] to get right, they seemingly turned it into a joke.

[15:29] And I would just love to hear from you.

[15:30] Like, do you think this is a good name for a pinball company?

[15:33] I'm going to start a poll.

[15:34] I'll put it on Patreon.

[15:35] We'll see what people say.

[15:37] And this is the thing is like, why create such an unnecessary distraction?

[15:41] Why would you name your company something that's going to turn people off when you want

[15:45] them to be excited?

[15:46] You want them to feel good about every aspect of your company.

[15:50] And there's no excuse for this.

[15:51] There just really is no excuse.

[15:53] Again, as a marketer, it just kills me.

[15:55] It just kills me that they're doing this.

[15:58] Everybody have a good night.

[15:59] I'm going to go to bed.

[16:00] I'll be up.

[16:01] And we're going to get the trailer for this game on Friday, which is going to be super

[16:04] exciting.

[16:05] I can't wait to talk about that.

[16:07] Everybody thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[16:09] And also I got some really good feedback about the Omokase Club, which by the way, if you

[16:13] donate $30 or more, I am going to treat you to an Omokase dinner in New York City or the

[16:19] city we're in together.

[16:21] I'm also probably going to make Omokase Club t-shirts.

[16:25] So if you join the Omokase Club, you are going to get a Canadian Omokase Club t-shirt

[16:30] that's going to be super funny.

[16:31] And no, we're not going to require people to give us a hundred bucks for a polo shirt.

[16:36] Everybody have a great night.

[16:37] We'll talk to you soon.

[16:38] Give me my name!

[16:40] It's making me laugh.

[16:45] It's making me laugh.

[16:48] It's making me laugh.

[16:51] It's making me laugh.

[16:52] It's making me laugh.

[16:53] It's making me laugh.

[16:54] It's making me laugh.

[16:55] It's making me laugh.

[16:56] It's making me laugh.

[16:57] It's making me laugh.

[16:58] It's making me laugh.

[16:59] It's making me laugh.

[17:00] It's making me laugh.

[17:01] It's making me laugh.

[17:02] It's making me laugh.

[17:03] It's making me laugh.

[17:04] It's making me laugh.

[17:05] It's making me laugh.

[17:06] It's making me laugh.
