[00:00] You know, it's 7.30 in the morning, and I got nothing better to do than make a podcast for my contributors,

[00:05] and I'm gonna give you guys the best of the best of the best.

[00:08] I'm gonna give you guys, Canada unfiltered. It's been too long.

[00:12] I'm always reserved. I'm always worried what's everyone gonna think.

[00:15] Or people gonna go after me. I don't really care. On the Canadian club, you guys are gonna get the old school.

[00:22] The raw version of Canada. It doesn't mean I have to curse.

[00:25] It doesn't mean I have to curse. I might throw some F-bombs out there,

[00:28] but I'm gonna talk about on this episode for you guys exclusively,

[00:32] the 88 of you who donate to Patreon and the PayPal people out there who can't figure Patreon out,

[00:38] you're gonna get my feelings right now.

[00:40] On the ridiculous statement, Jersey Jack Pimbal is sending to its customers who are asking for washer kits.

[00:48] I can't wait to read you this statement and deconstruct it. It's not very long,

[00:52] but it obviously shows they don't even think we can think with any common sense.

[00:57] We're gonna talk about Spooky's new release and why is it taking them so long to just show us what the hell the damn two games are.

[01:03] And then we got Deeproot Pimbal, a company that will never die because you know why?

[01:08] The last people. The last people that should be paying for Raza are paying for Raza.

[01:13] You and me, the taxpayers of the United States of America, let's go with Canada Club episode four right now.

[01:20] Welcome to my house!

[01:22] Baby, pick on door now. We can't even slow down.

[01:28] We don't have to go otherwise!

[01:30] Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!

[01:35] Oh yeah, welcome to my house. This is Canada's house and I'm hanging with my contributors and you guys

[01:39] are gonna get episode four of the Canada Club and they're not gonna get it. I just had to tease all

[01:44] those mofos out there. You know, when you're doing this for five years and you've got a few thousand

[01:48] people that listen to every single episode and then you ask people, show your support, show

[01:53] your love for five years of absolutely free content.

[01:57] 88 of you showed up and there's some more of you on my PayPal as well.

[02:01] You guys can't figure Patreon out but here we go right now.

[02:04] Let's get right to it.

[02:05] I want to talk about how stupid some of the things are that are happening in the pinball

[02:10] world, how inane they are, how ridiculous they are and this is not me creating controversy.

[02:16] I always love when people say that he creates the drama, he creates the controversy.

[02:22] This stuff I'm about to talk about right now, I didn't freaking create, I don't wake

[02:27] up in New York City, look at my beautiful wife, my beautiful child and say how can I conjure

[02:33] up some ridiculous toxic thing in the pinball world.

[02:37] Everything I'm about to talk to you about right now, I am reacting to.

[02:41] I would love to live in a world in which these pinball companies could actually treat

[02:45] us like respectable human beings that can actually think.

[02:49] I would like to live in a world where there is no pinball drama where they make games,

[02:54] they put them in boxes and you get to buy them.

[02:57] That's how almost every single product we engage with on planet earth works.

[03:04] Can you imagine if most of the products that Amazon sold us we opened up the box and

[03:07] there were freaking problems with it?

[03:09] And if we went to get support we got stupid comments from the companies and we didn't

[03:13] get real fixes and resolutions but welcome to pinball people.

[03:18] I mean I get better customer service on a $3,000 flat screen TV.

[03:23] If I unbox it and there is one dead pixel I will be sent a new TV without any headaches.

[03:31] If I buy a $10,000 pinball machine and there is an issue, good luck, good luck to you

[03:37] getting any resolution.

[03:38] And there's a point now I'm looking at pin sight and there's a Jurassic Park freaking

[03:42] premium for sale.

[03:44] A Jurassic Park premium listed for sale for $9,000.

[03:51] I think that's the moment right?

[03:52] Is that the moment we jumped the shark?

[03:54] What point do we look at this entire hobby and just say it's getting f in ridiculous.

[04:01] Between the prices, between the sloppiness of the companies, between all these boutiques

[04:06] you can't get their shit together.

[04:08] How many years are we going to go on and on and on?

[04:11] Let's marry around and then try to blame Canadians pinball podcasts.

[04:16] I mean I'm here to entertain you.

[04:18] I'm here to say stuff that nobody else will say.

[04:20] I mean I was listening to other podcasts the other night and I was like oh let me check

[04:24] out these guys you know they're always really funny really campy and they are really funny

[04:28] and really campy and all it is is everybody kissing everybody's ass dropping names of sponsors

[04:35] left and right.

[04:37] Where did the world go wrong?

[04:39] Where are the independent thinkers in pinball?

[04:42] Where are they?

[04:43] Why aren't there more people looking at this stuff saying this is bullshit?

[04:47] Like is it literally bullshit?

[04:49] It's a super fun toy.

[04:51] I love pinball.

[04:52] I love buying it.

[04:53] But when certain things happen like I'm about to read to you, where's the outcry?

[04:58] Where are people saying this is bullshit?

[05:00] You know where's the coverage from this week in pinball?

[05:02] I've said this to Jeff Patterson I was like Jeff you said you were going to cover the

[05:06] play field issues.

[05:08] Who are the number one pinball news outlet?

[05:10] You write about stuff that's newsworthy in pinball that people who are into pinball should

[05:16] be aware of.

[05:17] So should not people be aware that there are play field issues with Jersey Jack games.

[05:22] Okay he said he was going to cover it.

[05:24] That was months ago.

[05:26] Where's the coverage?

[05:27] Nothing.

[05:28] Okay.

[05:29] Where's the coverage of alien pinball machines that are having a lot of problems at a box?

[05:34] Nothing.

[05:35] So this is where we are in pinball.

[05:36] You realize this people.

[05:37] We have a world in which everyone is on the side of the fence of cheerleading the companies,

[05:44] cheerleading the games.

[05:45] But when things go wrong and when there are issues that should be addressed, guess who

[05:50] covers it?

[05:51] Nobody.

[05:52] And it's left to me to be the bad guy.

[05:55] But you get to hang with the bad guy right now.

[05:57] Okay.

[05:58] So let's start with this.

[05:59] We're going to talk about the Jersey Jack communication.

[06:01] Then we're going to talk about spooky pinball and where this game is or these games are

[06:06] and how they're launching this machine.

[06:08] And then I want to talk to you about deep root at the end.

[06:11] Not a lot to say, but life goes on for deep root and unfortunately for you and me, the

[06:17] US taxpayers are going to be the final bailout that J-pop gets.

[06:21] It's pretty sickening when I think about this whole thing and how it's all sort of just

[06:26] been a never ending cycle of burning money to get this game out that's not worth it.

[06:33] Because guess what?

[06:34] No game is worth it.

[06:36] How much money can you throw at J-pop to get something that's not even worth it?

[06:42] This whole thing has been a 10 year calamity.

[06:45] Zidware buyers got duped.

[06:47] Pintasia buyers got duped.

[06:49] American pinball people who bought magic girls got duped.

[06:51] The whole thing has just been the greatest way to evaporate money in the pinball world.

[06:58] Like nothing else.

[06:59] It's still going and now there's hundreds of thousands of government loans going to

[07:04] deep root to make the raza games and to keep these people salaried and it's just crazy

[07:11] that we're still here.

[07:12] Alright, so let's start with Jersey Jack pinball and I will say this.

[07:15] I'm going to speak from the heart on these Canadian clubs.

[07:18] I have loved pinball like I've never loved pinball before when I saw the magic that was

[07:24] Guns and Roses pinball.

[07:25] You know it.

[07:26] You saw how excited I was.

[07:29] This game meant so much to me and it still is a masterpiece game.

[07:33] I want to start out by saying that these play field issues are not.

[07:39] They do not detract from the amazing game that Eric Minier, Keith Johnson and Slash

[07:46] and company created.

[07:47] And I know there's a team of people over there that also worked really hard on creating

[07:52] this game.

[07:53] This is not an indictment of those people.

[07:56] This is not an indictment of Jersey Jack as an entire entity, but I know Jersey Jack will

[08:03] be listening to this because I know they listen to everything I say.

[08:07] That's why they unfriend me on their Facebook page.

[08:10] That's why Ken Cromwell unfriends me on Facebook.

[08:14] They listen to what Canada says and guess what their response to Canada is.

[08:19] Please stop attacking our company.

[08:23] Now I want to talk directly to them right now because I'm not attacking your company.

[08:29] I am responding to what your company is doing.

[08:33] I am allowed as a customer of your product which I purchased.

[08:38] I am allowed to respond to what you do.

[08:42] Your actions speak louder than words and yet I will deconstruct the words you are sending

[08:49] to your customers.

[08:50] But ultimately over the past few months this thing has sucked my enjoyment out of Pimbal.

[08:57] It really has.

[08:58] I loved this game so much and now I know that they're not going to do anything for me if

[09:04] I have an issue.

[09:06] How can that put me in a good mood?

[09:08] I love Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[09:11] I root for this company because they are the only company that's really trying to put

[09:16] more into Pimbal.

[09:18] But as I always said with this company they always find a way to disappoint and there's

[09:25] always an Achilles heel with every game they launch and here we are same story just different

[09:32] title and it's unfortunate and I bet this is more depressing to Eric and Keith than

[09:38] anybody else because they work so hard on this game.

[09:42] It's now nothing but play at your own risk.

[09:43] And look I understand the other side of this argument that we should all be grown adults.

[09:49] We shouldn't let it bother us.

[09:51] A little chip on the play field does not ruin the experience of playing the game.

[09:56] This is why this whole thing has been so hard on so many of us because it catches us

[10:01] in the middle of even our own ridiculousness.

[10:05] Our own OCD behavior around Pimbal machines and I get it.

[10:08] It's almost like we're a little bit to blame right.

[10:11] We're expecting way too much from these products where it's a steel ball bouncing around

[10:16] wood and clear coat and plastic and we expect nothing to happen.

[10:22] We never used to feel this way when we were kids.

[10:25] We went into the arcade and we just banged on our arcade machines and we banged on Pimbal

[10:30] machines and we had fun and we had smiles on our faces and we went home and we enjoyed

[10:35] these games.

[10:37] That is how kids deal with games.

[10:39] And for many of us we buy these games to get back to that feeling of being a kid.

[10:45] But the problem now is this.

[10:47] When we were children we were never OCD little crybabies.

[10:51] We weren't.

[10:52] We weren't OCD little crybabies.

[10:54] Nobody went into the arcade back in the day and say hey this tron has a scratch on its

[11:00] decal.

[11:01] Hey this Adam's family has a chip over here by this post.

[11:05] Hey this shooter lane is all worn out.

[11:08] But as grown adults we want the toys that kids enjoy but we want to approach them like

[11:15] a bunch of whiny babies and we do and you see it.

[11:18] Now do we expect more for our money and should these games be better quality for the money?

[11:24] Absolutely.

[11:25] But that's the problem with it all.

[11:27] We want this mint version of something that naturally is taking a beating.

[11:32] We want these machines that used to be on location only to hold up like collectibles for

[11:38] our homes and our houses and that is never what pinball was meant to be.

[11:43] But we also know that you can have your cake and eat it too.

[11:46] We know that there are companies out there that have fixed the play field issues.

[11:50] And that is why Jersey Jack pinball is the most painful pinball company for me to cover.

[11:55] And I know they listen to this.

[11:57] They know the reason why they're painful to observe because they make the most magical

[12:03] games and then they can't figure out the same issue over and over again.

[12:09] You know what the issues are and it's just at the point now where it's just stupid and

[12:13] it's a sign.

[12:14] But here's the part where I really am the most disappointed in them.

[12:19] I understand Jersey Jack pinball if Mirko sent you play fields that are all over the place.

[12:24] I get it.

[12:25] I have empathy because you had trust in your vendor that they would figure this out.

[12:31] You believed Mirko when he put his little quality seal on the play field and clearly that

[12:36] doesn't work.

[12:37] This is a play field issue.

[12:39] This is not a Jersey Jack manufacturing issue.

[12:43] Jersey Jack knows that Mirko is telling customers that it's Jersey Jack's fault.

[12:49] Jersey Jack has been more professional and not thrown Mirko under the bus.

[12:53] They probably are scrambling to try to find another vendor to make their play fields.

[12:58] But play field vendors are not a dime a dozen.

[13:01] This isn't like making a pizza.

[13:03] There's not like thousands of pizza reas out there that you could just switch your vendor

[13:07] or your supplier.

[13:09] This is very very sort of highly skilled work that not a lot of people do.

[13:14] So I have empathy for Jersey Jack pinball.

[13:16] They must be so annoyed and frustrated that this has happened again.

[13:21] But here's the part I just don't get.

[13:24] And this is why Jersey Jack, I know you're listening.

[13:28] You've got to think before you tell people stuff like this.

[13:32] When your customers reach out to you and are asking for help and are asking to get the

[13:38] preventative kid, it's not a solution, but this might help prevent your game from getting

[13:45] chips and pooling and having play field issues that you don't want.

[13:50] And your customers reach out to you and you write back to them this answer.

[13:56] This is where I'm like, you know what?

[13:58] I'm kind of just at the point where I'm done with Jersey Jack pinball because it's like

[14:02] they're not even thinking about what they're saying.

[14:06] And this stuff speaks volumes.

[14:08] And common sense as my mom always said is the most important thing to have in life.

[14:14] It doesn't matter that you have billions of dollars.

[14:17] It doesn't matter that you went to Ivy League schools.

[14:19] It doesn't matter what your job is, what your title is.

[14:22] You need common sense because when I read something like I'm about to read and I apply

[14:29] it through a common sense filter, I just shoulder shrug and want to walk away and be done with

[14:36] Jersey Jack pinball because it's like they don't even think.

[14:39] Okay, so I want to give you the context for this.

[14:41] So a customer of Guns and Roses pinball saw that they were sending out washer kids to help

[14:48] with the issues, okay?

[14:50] And this is the response that Jersey Jack pinball sent back to their customer.

[14:56] We are not offering washer kids as we are having a hard time securing inventory.

[15:02] Your best bet is to reach out to your favorite part supplier and ordering from them.

[15:09] Kama, we do not recommend anyone modifying their game.

[15:14] Let me repeat that in layman's terms.

[15:16] We don't have kids, we can't find parts, but you should go to your favorite supplier

[15:23] and get the parts and then we don't recommend using those parts.

[15:28] That is what this is saying.

[15:29] Can we for a moment just call this the most ridiculous statement of the year?

[15:35] Jersey Jack, let me get the straight.

[15:37] You can't source parts but you're telling people where to go get the parts.

[15:40] So why don't you go get the parts from your favorite part supplier?

[15:44] And if someone does get washers, what the hell is this final statement?

[15:48] We do not recommend anyone modifying their game.

[15:53] What I don't understand, you just told me you can't give me a solution.

[15:58] Where to go get the solution?

[15:59] But don't you install that solution.

[16:02] This is the problem with JJP right now.

[16:05] It is like the lawyer wrestled the keyboard away from their customer service person who

[16:11] was typing this and through in that final line that indemnifies them to anything you do

[16:16] on your game.

[16:17] That if you wanted to put washers on your machine to solve the problem, don't do it.

[16:22] This is the most contradicting statement I think I've read all year and this is just BS

[16:29] and they should be ashamed of themselves for sending this stuff out.

[16:33] And Jersey Jack, this is not me attacking your company.

[16:36] You understand that your customers that can afford your expensive machines are well

[16:41] educated.

[16:43] They can think critically.

[16:44] They're going to read something like this and then do what Jersey Jack?

[16:48] What do you think they're going to do when they read this?

[16:50] Okay, so you're basically saying we can't help you out.

[16:53] You might be able to go help yourself, but don't help yourself because then we're not

[16:56] going to support whatever you do.

[16:58] Don't modify your game.

[16:59] These are not modifications Jersey Jack.

[17:03] Nobody wants to modify their game.

[17:05] This isn't like you're plugging in an electrical mod to the game and using up the power source

[17:10] and create a short in your game.

[17:13] This is not a modification Jersey Jack.

[17:16] This is a necessary thing people have to do to fix the problems that are in the products

[17:21] you're sending them.

[17:22] A modification is something you do to make the game better.

[17:25] When you modify something, you make it better.

[17:27] This is not a modification.

[17:29] When someone sticks a bandaid on their body people, do you see your friend with a bandaid

[17:35] and he says, yo, Chris, I just modified myself with this bandaid.

[17:40] Jersey Jack, wake up.

[17:42] You're too smart gentlemen.

[17:44] You are too smart.

[17:45] Pat Lawler, Brett Abyss, Ken Cromwell, Eric Minier.

[17:49] You guys are too smart for communication like this.

[17:53] Tell the lawyer to sit down.

[17:55] Tell the lawyer to stop with this stuff.

[17:57] This is such legal speak and it's not doing you any favors and I think these guys need

[18:02] to come up with a solution.

[18:04] I think they need to move past Mirko and I think they need to send everyone who has

[18:08] a guns and roses.

[18:10] They need to send you these kits.

[18:12] This shouldn't have to be something you ask for because by the time you're asking for

[18:16] it, your game is probably displaying some issues.

[18:20] This is how you do it Jersey Jack.

[18:22] You sold us games that were very expensive.

[18:25] These washer kits that also come with new posts.

[18:29] There's been no communication about any of it.

[18:31] There's no communication.

[18:32] There's no communication about what the new posts are, how you design them that way,

[18:36] what you did and why you think that's going to be a solution.

[18:40] There's been zero communication.

[18:42] Like I said, nobody else wants to talk about this.

[18:45] Nobody else wants to cover this.

[18:48] Everybody else just wants to brush this under the rug because they're all friends with

[18:51] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[18:53] I mean this when I see the Jersey Jack team at shows.

[18:56] It's going to be them who don't want to walk up to me.

[18:58] I will happily walk up to them, shake their hand, congratulate them on a great game and

[19:04] encourage them to get a resolution and to start talking to us.

[19:08] Like we're grown adults who have common sense, okay?

[19:11] All right.

[19:12] Kinatikov, man, man, I wish everybody could hear this.

[19:15] They don't get to hear it.

[19:16] You get to hear it.

[19:17] All right, let's talk about spooky Pimball because this thread right now and the spooky

[19:20] Pimball, the next spooky Pimball theme, it's derailed.

[19:24] And this has not been a great release week for spooky Pimball.

[19:27] This is not how you do it.

[19:29] The way they did the Rick and Morty release was so much better orchestrated than this.

[19:34] And I've been reaching out to spooky Pimball and the thing they keep telling me is we need

[19:38] to wait for license or approval before we can show stuff.

[19:42] And I'm just like, why did you dummies?

[19:44] And I love the team over there.

[19:46] So I say that facetiously.

[19:47] But why would you dummies even put out the Halloween video if you didn't have all of your

[19:54] ducks in a row on your launch?

[19:56] Like wouldn't you submit everything for license or approval, get their approval on everything

[20:01] you're going to do, and then go live?

[20:05] Like now you have this completely ridiculous and sloppy launch happening right now.

[20:10] And look, I don't think this is going to impact sales at all.

[20:13] I know it.

[20:14] Spooky Pimball has a customer base.

[20:16] They have a fan base.

[20:17] Halloween is a license theme.

[20:19] They're going to be fine.

[20:20] They're going to be fine.

[20:21] This is me analyzing how stupid though and how silly and how sloppy this launch has been.

[20:26] I mean, first and foremost, you want the attention to be on one game at one time.

[20:31] Not too.

[20:32] Stern would never release two games on one day.

[20:35] So this whole like it's going to be Halloween and another theme on the same design is enane.

[20:41] It's not smart.

[20:42] It's nothing you should really be doing.

[20:44] I think what's happened here is this.

[20:46] I think Charlie just in a little bit of a selfish way and he deserves to be selfish.

[20:52] He wants to see this obscure game as a pinball machine and instead of just making it for himself,

[20:58] you know, it's too expensive to do that, you know, to do it properly.

[21:01] I think he just is using this Halloween game as a way to get some other thing out there

[21:07] that would be a complete commercial failure.

[21:09] Absolutely commercial failure.

[21:11] I keep hearing that the people over at Spooky are scratching their heads on this other

[21:15] title and everyone's just like, why are we wasting our time with this?

[21:19] But it is what it is.

[21:20] But the problem now is all of the attention has moved away from Halloween.

[21:24] This is why this is a marketing mistake.

[21:27] Everyone is now guessing what the second title is instead of saying how excited for Halloween

[21:33] they are.

[21:34] This is not how you do it.

[21:35] You don't want to distract people from the main act, which is Halloween.

[21:40] This is like everyone's trying to guess who's the opening act is going to be for Guns

[21:44] and Roses.

[21:45] Who gives a shit who the opening act is?

[21:47] The main act is Guns and Roses, right?

[21:49] The main act in this concert is Halloween and he's got everyone more excited to try

[21:54] to figure out who the opening act is.

[21:57] That is stupid.

[21:59] That is a mistake.

[22:00] And where is it?

[22:01] It's the fourth of July week and this is the other part that makes no sense.

[22:05] The whole thing was just, it was put up on a Tuesday.

[22:07] We got confirmation it's Halloween.

[22:10] Everyone is now going into a long weekend in which they don't want to be thinking about

[22:13] pinball.

[22:14] They're going to be traveling on vacation at barbecue.

[22:18] And when are we going to open the order banks now?

[22:20] So it probably is not going to be this weekend.

[22:23] It's probably going to be next week.

[22:25] And so now you have this two week period of a completely sloppy launch.

[22:30] And every time I go into the thread, I'm like, what is this shit?

[22:33] Like how do you work a year and a half on a game and you launch it like this?

[22:39] And the lack of creativity in pinball with pinball launches too.

[22:43] It's like, it's like the only tactic people know how to do now is let's show the other

[22:47] side of the play field first and have them guess.

[22:50] Okay, we've seen that now time and time again.

[22:55] Why can't people do something original?

[22:58] Why can't each launch have an original creative thing you do to get people excited that's

[23:03] based on the theme itself?

[23:05] How fun would it be if spooky pinball found like a pumpkin patch somewhere and hit a USB

[23:11] stick inside it that had all of the details about Halloween pinball and they had people

[23:15] go and try and find it.

[23:17] I don't know, just do something.

[23:19] Think a little bit originally about this whole thing, all right?

[23:22] Now here's what I think is going to happen.

[23:24] You know, the other thing I keep thinking about is this game going to sell out?

[23:27] Are they going to sell a thousand units of Halloween?

[23:30] And I think the answer is yes, unequivocally yes, they're going to sell a thousand of this

[23:36] game.

[23:37] Will it sell out day one?

[23:38] My guess is it won't sell out day one.

[23:41] I do think it's going to need a little bit of time to sell everyone.

[23:45] But here's where the butt is.

[23:47] If the game is freaking awesome and the play field and the shots and the mechs and everything

[23:52] about this game is super freaking cool, then absolutely I think it'll sell out possibly

[23:57] day one.

[23:58] And guess what ladies and gentlemen?

[24:00] That's how it freaking should be.

[24:02] Game should stop selling out before we see them.

[24:05] Mandalorian selling out before we see it and then we see it and I'm going to be so

[24:10] honest right now.

[24:11] Mandalorian is so meh in my mind.

[24:14] Mandalorian sells out before anyone sees it.

[24:17] There's absolutely nothing magical under the glass in that game.

[24:20] You know it.

[24:21] I mean, damn Alice Cooper's nightmare castle used to magged it way cooler than the damn

[24:26] baby Yoda does.

[24:27] And here we are.

[24:28] It's sold out.

[24:29] Not only that, people are spending way over sticker on an Ellie.

[24:32] This is stupid.

[24:34] This entire hobby has become so freaking stupid where like game sell out before you even

[24:39] see it.

[24:40] I understand a game selling out once you see it even if you haven't played it.

[24:44] We also can make a connection by seeing something and understanding how fun it's going to

[24:50] be to flip.

[24:51] I can make that connection.

[24:52] I can look at Hot Wheels next to Tails or the Arabian Knights.

[24:56] I could put those two games next to each other and I could easily determine that I would

[25:00] have more fun on Toden than Hot Wheels simply because of what's under the glass and seeing

[25:06] the game.

[25:07] Absolutely.

[25:08] And so could you.

[25:09] Now the problem with Thimbal lately is it doesn't even matter.

[25:11] Stern's just going to keep clobbering us with themes that we want and they're going

[25:14] to sell out right away and that's going to lead them to putting less in the games.

[25:19] Why would they put more in the games?

[25:20] Now I do think Godzilla will be packed.

[25:22] I do think it will be packed but it's still going to be a Stern people.

[25:26] Don't be fooled.

[25:27] This isn't going to be like Stern's Godzilla is going to look like a JJP game.

[25:31] It's not going to happen folks.

[25:32] I do think this spooky could be a day one sell out if the game is packed.

[25:37] Here you have to see how the other obscure theme does if it's launched simultaneously.

[25:42] Now the word on the street was something like a thousand Halloween and 750 of the other

[25:48] one.

[25:49] Now that other one seems like a high number because this thing seems to be more obscure than

[25:54] Rob Zombie, more obscure, more obscure than Alice Cooper.

[25:59] So my word to spooky is they can do better with this launch.

[26:02] It's just been a little bit of a sloppy launch and the whole thing is kind of exhausting

[26:06] going into that thread and seeing everybody just make endless guesses that are all going

[26:11] to be wrong.

[26:12] Okay.

[26:13] And I just want to say out there to the haters that said, Knaiida didn't guess Halloween

[26:17] and Knaiida threw out so many guesses.

[26:20] I gave people three titles.

[26:22] Three titles people.

[26:23] I didn't throw out a hundred guesses and I told you Halloween was the one I thought it

[26:28] really was going to be and I went back to it as I got more information and I was right.

[26:33] So I was right with Halloween.

[26:35] I was right with Mandalorian and again point me in the direction of another pinball podcast

[26:40] out there that told you Mandalorian that told you Halloween.

[26:44] They can't do it.

[26:46] Even if they know it's that they won't do it.

[26:48] Why is it that no other pinball podcast on planet earth if they know what a company's

[26:54] title is going to be won't share it with you because they want to be friends with the

[26:58] companies.

[26:59] I don't really care.

[27:00] And this episode with deep root and why I think this is the most ridiculous thing that

[27:04] still continues to go on and on and on.

[27:07] And I think what's ridiculous about deep root and raza is the sheer amount of money that's

[27:12] continued to be pumped into this company.

[27:15] It's been millions of dollars and we know it's been millions and millions of dollars because

[27:19] we can see right now that the US government has given deep root money as of April of 2021

[27:27] almost another million dollars has gone from the US small business administration in the

[27:31] form of a paycheck protection program.

[27:34] All right.

[27:35] And this is defined as an SBA back loan that helps businesses keep their workforce employed

[27:40] during the COVID-19 crisis.

[27:43] Now nobody told the US government that deep roots been trying to make this game for years

[27:48] prior to COVID.

[27:50] And it is kind of comical that they are now taking government money, taxpayer money.

[27:56] That is meant to go to businesses so they can pay their employees so that good businesses

[28:02] don't go out of business because they can't pay the salaries of their employees.

[28:08] Are you telling me that deep root pinball and deep root studios and deep root technology

[28:14] that these were successful businesses that had a hard time because of COVID and they need

[28:21] it help?

[28:22] No.

[28:23] This isn't how it's supposed to work.

[28:24] We're not supposed to bail out failed operations that have had years to try to make something

[28:31] happen.

[28:32] Years.

[28:33] Imagine if a restaurant, imagine if deep root was a restaurant.

[28:35] I love the metaphor of a restaurant.

[28:37] Imagine if deep root was a restaurant and for years they didn't bring out any food to

[28:42] its customers for years.

[28:44] And then eventually, you know, they have paying customers who still didn't get their food.

[28:49] And so then COVID hits.

[28:51] Now this is a restaurant that hasn't been successful for three years prior to COVID hitting.

[28:56] Should the US government and taxpayers give that restaurant money to continue to pay its

[29:01] servers or should that restaurant have been at a business years ago?

[29:06] And this is the part I just don't get the ability.

[29:09] And I'm saying like, look, Robert's doing this legally.

[29:12] Whatever they do to sort of figure out who gets this money, he did it.

[29:16] He did whatever he had to do to get this loan.

[29:19] And what's interesting about this loan that he just got, I'm going to give you the amounts.

[29:23] So the deep root loan for deep root tech was $759,000.

[29:31] And that's for 47 jobs retained.

[29:34] Let's just stop there for a minute.

[29:35] There are 47 people working at deep root technology and not one game has shipped.

[29:41] 47.

[29:42] Isn't that more people than spooky pinball employees?

[29:46] 47 jobs.

[29:48] What are these 47 people doing every day?

[29:53] Where are the games, Robert?

[29:55] Why can't you show us a photo of those 47 people making the games?

[30:00] But also deep root studios, which is more of like the software division of deep root,

[30:05] they also got a loan for $298,000 to retain 18 jobs.

[30:13] This is insane to me that there are 65 employees over at deep root pinball.

[30:20] The US government just gave them another million dollars to pay those people's salaries and

[30:26] not one game has shipped.

[30:29] Not one photo has surfaced of a production line.

[30:33] Nothing.

[30:34] They said these games would ship six to eight weeks back in December.

[30:38] And here we are in July.

[30:40] Now look, if you're in on this game, this is good news to you because it means they're

[30:46] going to continue to go to make these games and look, will Raza's get made?

[30:50] I think they will.

[30:51] But if you add up how much is each Raza costing deep root pinball, I mean, I think a low estimate

[30:59] and I mean, this a low estimate is probably like a hundred thousand dollars per game.

[31:08] There's over the last four to five years, this company has spent at least $10 million

[31:14] on getting this game to market and there's only a hundred and twenty two of them.

[31:21] They're not going to sell 4,000 in one year like Guns and Roses, a hundred and twenty

[31:27] two.

[31:28] Now, for those of you in on Raza who think you're going to have some holy grail that's

[31:32] going to skyrocket in value, I don't know.

[31:35] This pinball market is insane, but here's the bigger question.

[31:39] If you're not a burned Zidware customer and I understand why the burn Zidware customers

[31:44] want their games, I get that.

[31:47] But for everybody else, how can you support this?

[31:51] How can you wake up and support a company that is now taking from taxpayers to finish John

[31:59] Papaduke's game?

[32:01] John Papaduke has burned through so many millions of dollars to get this game out.

[32:08] Look at Raza, ladies and gentlemen, just go watch the videos of Raza.

[32:13] Watch all of the videos.

[32:14] You can watch the videos on Deep Roots page, you can watch it on YouTube, you tell me where

[32:20] any of this is worth it.

[32:23] The art's not nearly as good as the zombie Eddie art.

[32:26] It's not nearly as good.

[32:27] It's not nearly as colorful.

[32:29] It's not nearly as good as Zombie Eddie's Raza and Matt Andrews's Raza.

[32:34] It's not.

[32:35] Go look at the old Raza, it looks much better.

[32:38] Look at the mechanisms in this game.

[32:40] There's nothing new, there's nothing original, there's nothing innovative.

[32:46] The pinbar, which is the most innovative thing they're bringing.

[32:50] Do we need that?

[32:51] When you played pinball, are you staring at the lockdown bar?

[32:54] No, that's not what makes pinball better.

[32:58] Pinball of the glass is what people want.

[33:00] Is it a sexy package?

[33:01] Sure, the game looks sexy, but there are plenty of sexy games out there that I could go

[33:06] get today.

[33:07] So what was worth it?

[33:10] What was worth it?

[33:11] Where did all this effort go awry?

[33:14] Why did so much money get spent and there's still nothing to show for it?

[33:20] How do you make up all of that lost capital?

[33:23] You just can't, you can't make it up with food truck.

[33:26] So I don't know, eventually, eventually they're going to have to open up the curtain and

[33:32] they're going to have to send out the Raza's and get to game two.

[33:36] And I've heard food truck is pretty impressive.

[33:38] I have, I won't lie.

[33:39] For the people that saw it, I heard it's got some really neat stuff in it.

[33:44] How do you survive food truck versus Mandalorian?

[33:47] Food truck versus Godzilla.

[33:49] Food truck versus guns and roses.

[33:51] I just don't know how you do it.

[33:53] So this is where we're at.

[33:54] You know, John Papadu doesn't have nine lives.

[33:56] He has 19 lives and he just keeps going and going and going.

[34:02] And I would love to be a fly on the wall over at Deeproot today.

[34:05] And I will say this.

[34:07] I think it is pathetic that the people who live in Texas who are customers who were promised

[34:13] a tour of Deeproot don't have the guts to knock on the door and go get a tour.

[34:19] Knock on the door and ask for a tour.

[34:23] Are you really that scared of Robert Mueller that you can't do that?

[34:26] And if they don't give you a tour and they won't let you in, then there's your answer.

[34:31] But at least report back to the consumers and to the community.

[34:35] That's what they told you that they wouldn't let you in.

[34:39] And cars in a parking lot do not equal pinball manufacturing abilities people.

[34:44] They do not.

[34:45] I could pull up to giant stadium and see 45,000 cars in the parking lot.

[34:51] That doesn't mean a pinball machine could be made by anybody in the stands.

[34:55] And I don't care if it's 10 cars or 65 cars.

[34:58] It means nothing.

[35:00] You don't just know how to manufacture pinball machines.

[35:03] And this isn't just like a small little operation.

[35:05] They need to turn on something very big because they've invested very big.

[35:10] And if you ask me, I don't think they're going to be able to figure it out.

[35:13] It's clearly not as simple as they thought.

[35:15] It's much more difficult than they thought.

[35:17] And I don't even think they have all the parts sourced.

[35:19] I don't because the where is the game?

[35:22] Where's the game?

[35:23] And I hope they released the game because here's what?

[35:25] I'm so sick of analyzing deep roots intentions.

[35:29] I want to look at the game and I want to judge them by their products.

[35:34] That's how it's supposed to be.

[35:36] I talked at the beginning of this podcast.

[35:38] That's how the world's supposed to work.

[35:39] I'm supposed to talk about companies based on the products,

[35:43] not based on promises, not based on vaporware they've been working on for 10 years.

[35:49] What is the actual product?

[35:51] You are telling me is done and ready for me to jump on and ready for me to react to.

[35:59] And I love that they think they're laughing at me.

[36:01] Who's laughing at anybody but them?

[36:04] They've had five years, millions of dollars and not one game.

[36:08] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening to Knai2 Club episode four.

[36:12] I hope you enjoy it.

[36:13] I hope you get entertained by this.

[36:15] And I'm going to keep doing these Knai2 Club's and I really appreciate it

[36:17] because I do put a ton of hard work into this show and it's been years and years and years

[36:22] and hours and hours and hours and I got to get my merchandise ready because I know a lot

[36:26] of you want to sport Knai2 Club's pinball podcast merchandise.

[36:29] That is coming as well.

[36:31] You will get access to the merchandise before anybody else.

[36:35] And so thank you again.

[36:36] It means a lot to me, Brenda and Killian, that you contribute every month and support

[36:41] Knai2 Club's pinball podcast.

[36:42] Peace out people.

[36:43] Welcome to my house.
