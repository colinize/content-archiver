[00:00] She got a smile that it seems to me, it might be a childhood memory, but everything was spread out the black lose guys, guys, guys.

[00:12] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:16] Ah, good morning everybody, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] I'm your venerable host, Kaneda, coming at you from Connecticut, here on a weekly basis,

[00:27] it's usually three times a week to talk about pinball.

[00:30] And I think the reason why you listen to Canada's Pinball Podcast, we give a sort of unbiased,

[00:35] if you will, opinion about what's going on in the pinball world.

[00:39] And I haven't been as active of late on the Patreon chat, I just want to talk on this

[00:44] episode a little bit real real about what's going on in my world, where my head's at,

[00:49] what I'm seeing in the pinball hobby, and I kind of want to make some correlation between

[00:54] personal life and the pinball world.

[00:57] I mean, that's kind of the juggle we all do.

[01:00] If you think about it, all of us have a personal relationship with pinball.

[01:05] All of us have personal relationships with the friends we've made in the hobby, with

[01:09] the companies we've witnessed in this hobby.

[01:13] Some of you are Stern fans, some of you are Jersey Jack fans, some of you love the old

[01:19] Bally Williams games, some of you just love all pinball.

[01:22] I think most people out there.

[01:24] If I were to sort of, I don't know, sort of blanket this entire hobby, I think most people

[01:31] just love great pinball.

[01:33] And you want a magical game.

[01:36] You want a game that makes you feel something.

[01:38] You want a game that really gets your blood going.

[01:41] And it's a really fun game.

[01:43] In this modern digital world that is very cold, it's very isolating, it's very lonely,

[01:50] the modern world.

[01:51] It is.

[01:52] When you look at all the data, most of us grew up in a time where we were out in the world,

[01:58] where we encountered our friends when we were young face to face.

[02:02] We weren't hanging out with people staring at phones.

[02:06] Imagine going back to the 1980s and the 1990s.

[02:10] Just think about all your fond memories of going into arcades, of going to the mall,

[02:16] of waiting online to see Batman, Ninja Turtles, right?

[02:20] Star Wars movies.

[02:22] Imagine all of those fond memories and now give everybody in those moments a cell phone

[02:29] and see how different it is.

[02:32] We didn't know.

[02:33] I used to love going into the arcades and not knowing every week if there was going

[02:38] to be a new machine there.

[02:40] And if there was a new machine there, whether it was a new pinball machine or arcade machine,

[02:45] you didn't really even understand where it came from.

[02:48] You didn't know, like, oh, next week we're going to get Daytona USA.

[02:52] You didn't know Mad Dog McCree was going to make its way into the arcade.

[02:56] You didn't know Adam's family or Twilight Zone was going to just appear one day in the

[03:01] arcade.

[03:02] And not only that, when you went up to those machines and you enjoyed them, you then did

[03:07] not go on the internet and hear everybody complain about the lack of code or the shooter

[03:14] lane where I'm the game.

[03:15] And that's the thing.

[03:17] It's like I just sometimes wake up in the modern world and there's so much noise everywhere.

[03:23] And I know what you're thinking.

[03:25] I'm also contributing to that noise.

[03:28] Absolutely.

[03:29] Now look, it is fun to get connected like this.

[03:33] And I think the community we built here is great because if you think about it too, if

[03:37] we go back to the 80s and 90s, none of us would be friends.

[03:42] Unless you lived in my town, unless you were going to Nathan's arcade on Central Avenue

[03:48] in Yonkers, New York, you and I probably never would have met.

[03:53] And unless we crossed paths at high school or college, I never would have known you existed.

[04:00] And I'm talking to my fans out there in Australia, in Europe, in South America, in Canada, in

[04:07] California, in Texas.

[04:09] You know who you are.

[04:10] Chicago.

[04:11] We never would have met.

[04:12] So it really is a great thing, the connection we've made.

[04:16] Because I do think the valuable connections we're making through this hobby are happening

[04:21] because we all discovered pinball in different ways.

[04:24] And it's all very personal.

[04:27] And for me right now, in my personal life, what I've been struggling with is the job

[04:31] I've loved for 12 years now.

[04:34] I've been at this company.

[04:35] I've loved it for 12 years.

[04:37] It started to change during COVID.

[04:39] A lot changed in my industry during COVID.

[04:42] We went from in-person meetings.

[04:45] We went from going to the clients, even for just an hour meeting.

[04:49] I used to fly down to Atlanta, get into a room, and speak face to face to my colleagues

[04:55] at Coca-Cola.

[04:57] Nowadays, everything is through the computer.

[05:01] Everything is on a team's call.

[05:02] Half the company doesn't even go into work.

[05:05] And there's a company holiday party.

[05:07] I don't even recognize two-thirds of my own company who's part of the New York office.

[05:13] And there's just been so many changes.

[05:15] I hope you guys understand when you're going through something personally and whether it's

[05:20] at work, whether it's with a family issue, I've also had some family issues good and

[05:25] bad.

[05:26] And so all this is going on while I'm reading NAPS Arcade, right?

[05:30] While I'm reading Pinside and I'm trying to muster up sometimes.

[05:35] I mean, some weeks, it really gets hard for me to even talk about a $15,000 pinball machine.

[05:45] Because I might be in this personal space where I'm just like nervous or I'm anxious

[05:51] about where my life is going, about how I'm going to provide for my family.

[05:57] And it's not that I don't have money saved up.

[05:59] It's not that I don't have a good job right now, but that doesn't eliminate the anxiety.

[06:05] Because for many of us out there, and I know I'm not talking to all of you, but for many

[06:09] of us out there, we still rely on an income and we still work for a company.

[06:15] Now a lot of you might work for yourselves and that's great.

[06:19] It is absolutely great.

[06:20] You know, if there's one lesson I really want to pass on to my kids, it's try to find a

[06:25] way to be free, to learn a skill, to learn a trade and go into business for yourself.

[06:33] I think a lot of us, and I grew up in this generation, like we went to college, we studied

[06:37] something and we got pushed into the corporate world.

[06:41] And that's where my dad worked and he was very successful at it.

[06:45] But not all corporate jobs are the same.

[06:48] And the corporate world is not the same anymore.

[06:51] Very few people at the top are taking everything.

[06:54] It used to be there was more loyalty.

[06:56] It used to be there was more trickle down.

[06:58] It's not that way anymore.

[07:00] You know, I look at my wife Brenda, beautiful Brenda.

[07:03] She worked at Metta.

[07:04] She woke up one day to an email that her job was eliminated.

[07:08] Not just her, 60,000 people got eliminated in one day when that happened.

[07:14] And since then, the Metta stock has gone through the roof and Mark Zuckerberg is worth $300

[07:20] billion.

[07:22] And he fired all those people because of his own mistake of investing in a Mettaverse that

[07:28] never came to fruition.

[07:30] And now the whole thing is about using AI to target people and it's super successful.

[07:36] So as I see the AI debate around Harry Potter artwork, it hits home for a lot of us.

[07:44] As I read the thread and I realized how did this happen?

[07:48] How did one of the most anticipated games of all time, one of the games that Jersey

[07:53] Jack needs to just create positive vibes in this hobby?

[07:58] Because everybody, you don't really care that much about my personal life, but you care

[08:02] about pinball.

[08:03] And I think everybody's been rooting lately for these pinball machines and these companies

[08:10] to justify these prices.

[08:13] But the easiest way to do it is just release magical games that make us believe again,

[08:20] that make us feel like a little kid inside when we see it for the first time.

[08:24] And I'm looking at this Harry Potter game and is it not interesting how the entire conversation

[08:30] around it right now is the fact that corners were cut, clearly something weird went on with

[08:36] the creation of the artwork.

[08:39] And now what that's doing is telegraphing to everybody that instead of going to an artist

[08:46] and having them hand illustrate a Harry Potter pinball machine from scratch, you took some

[08:54] artwork, you fed it through some sort of computerized filter and this is what you got.

[09:00] It's almost like they tried to do what Christopher Franchi does without Christopher Franchi.

[09:08] And Franchi still illustrates, I know he uses source material, but he is still hand illustrating

[09:15] it.

[09:16] He's not using AI.

[09:18] And I'm watching not just like in pinball in the world, the reaction everybody is having

[09:25] to the way we've turned on all of these technological shortcuts and how these things are removing

[09:32] the humanity from the very things we love and how these things are costing more jobs.

[09:40] They're not really giving back to society.

[09:43] And that's why so many artists are so mad because when you see stuff like this and I'm

[09:47] looking at this Harry Potter, imagine if AI designed a pinball machine and simply went

[09:53] and stole all the designs of Keith Elwin, put them together in its own design and said,

[09:59] Now you get to release a game and it's your design.

[10:03] It's not Keith Elwins, even though I've stolen everything he's done and just rearranged it,

[10:09] now it's yours.

[10:10] It's a really weird world we live in now.

[10:12] And I think what people love about pinball, it's what you love about pinball, it's what

[10:16] I love about pinball.

[10:17] It's analog.

[10:18] It's fully analog.

[10:21] And the more we see the digital world sort of infiltrate this analog game we love and

[10:28] we've seen it.

[10:29] We've seen it.

[10:30] There's more going on on the screen on Harry Potter than is going on below the glass.

[10:35] There just is.

[10:37] And yet I still hear people say that the game is packed underneath the glass and it confuses

[10:43] me.

[10:44] If that game is packed, I just don't understand.

[10:47] How does anyone who says that go walk over to a game like Monster Bash or a game like

[10:53] Toten or a theater of magic.

[10:55] I just don't get it.

[10:56] I really don't get it.

[10:59] And look, I understand that some of those older games on a code level are shallow.

[11:03] Okay, so if you're going to bring in these big LCD screens and you're going to bring

[11:08] in these software teams and these coders, fine, but then you've got to make the code

[11:15] magical, right?

[11:17] You've got to make the code so good that it takes my attention away from the lack of physical

[11:24] stuff that's under the glass.

[11:26] And then the question I have for each and every one of you is, are they doing that right

[11:31] now with Harry Potter?

[11:33] I think there's some work to be done.

[11:35] Are they doing that with Dune?

[11:37] I think it's getting there, but there's work to be done.

[11:40] Dune's theme, I still think is going to be the big issue.

[11:44] The King Kong code is coming along.

[11:46] It really is.

[11:48] Everyone I talk to who like owns a Kong and plays a Kong is really enjoying it.

[11:54] Kong's issue will always be the lack of assets and all the mechanical stuff going on with

[12:00] the game.

[12:01] I want to say a very happy belated birthday to Zombie Yeti.

[12:06] His birthday was yesterday.

[12:08] I would reach out to him if you have not and wish Jeremy Packer a happy birthday.

[12:15] I love his work in pinball.

[12:17] I've been critical of the Kong art package I have, not his work on it.

[12:23] And I think they set him up a little bit to fail on it.

[12:26] I do because they didn't license the iconic Kong.

[12:30] If they had licensed the iconic Kong and the iconic Kong imagery from all those movies,

[12:36] I think Jeremy's art package would have been so much better.

[12:40] Everybody look, I've got to make this a short show because I got to go in early.

[12:44] I've been up since four in the morning.

[12:46] Thank you Melvin Williams over in the Netherlands.

[12:50] My boy Melvin, you know him as the DPX founder.

[12:55] You know him as the Alice in Wonderland creator and now a partner with Leor Melvin.

[13:02] Just thank you for being such a good friend.

[13:04] I mean this.

[13:05] I don't know where I would be right now if it weren't for Brenda and my pinball friends.

[13:12] I mean that.

[13:13] The other friends in life, I don't know where they all went.

[13:16] You wake up one day and you still have all these friends, friends from college, friends

[13:20] from jobs and everybody has kids, everybody moves on.

[13:24] But you guys, you've never moved on.

[13:26] And maybe that's because the other pinball podcasts just aren't as good.

[13:30] But you've been here.

[13:31] Like I've been friends with some of you for a quarter of my life.

[13:36] A quarter of my life.

[13:37] And that's amazing.

[13:39] Everybody thank you for being a member of Canadian pinball podcast.

[13:42] I'm not sure what the future holds but I will promise you this.

[13:46] Whether jobs come and go, I'm always going to be living in Rhoaden.

[13:51] I love this town.

[13:52] I'm always going to be happily married to Brenda.

[13:55] I'm always going to be the best father to my children.

[13:58] All they want is love.

[14:00] I've learned a lot over the last 12 years.

[14:03] I've learned a lot recently over the last couple years about the power of waking up

[14:08] in a good mood.

[14:10] How all this stuff we buy, Gucci, pinball, watches, it doesn't matter.

[14:17] None of it matters when you wake up and you're not in a good mood.

[14:21] It doesn't.

[14:22] All of it is irrelevant.

[14:23] And that's why it's hard sometimes lately for me to wake up and be in a mood that's

[14:30] like not myself.

[14:32] And I don't feel like myself.

[14:33] I feel like recently I've become something other people want, not who I am.

[14:39] You know me, Canada.

[14:40] I love being me.

[14:42] I love having my creative control, my creative freedom.

[14:45] Imagine if you gave me, after all these years of doing this podcast, you gave me some editor.

[14:51] Hey, Chris, I'm now going to control what content of yours gets to be put up for your

[14:58] fans to listen to.

[14:59] This show may never go away until the day I die.

[15:03] I'm going to quickly edit this, get it up, and then I'm going to go play with my kids

[15:07] and I got to catch a train.

[15:08] Later, Canada out.

[15:33] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[15:35] Sweet child, we die.

[15:40] The fire.
