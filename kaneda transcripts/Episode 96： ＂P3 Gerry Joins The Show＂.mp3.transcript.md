[00:00] Born in the USA, Born in the USA, I was born in the USA,

[00:16] Born in the USA, I was...

[00:22] Welcome! It's episode 96 of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[00:26] and we're inching closer and closer to that 100th episode.

[00:32] And that's not taking into account some of those episodes I've deleted in the special editions.

[00:38] On this episode, we talked to Jerry at P3. It's an exciting time for those guys over there after years of development.

[00:46] They are getting ready to put their first machines together and ship them out.

[00:50] So we're going to talk all about that.

[00:52] Before we air that interview, just want to do a few news items. What's been going on in pinball?

[00:58] Let's start with alien. So alien is getting a lot of attention.

[01:04] There are games out there in the wild. There was the dead flip stream.

[01:08] I'll go into more detail on another podcast about that stream.

[01:12] But I think the overall consensus is that the game is looking good.

[01:16] It looks pretty hard and brutal and pretty difficult to start multi-ball.

[01:20] But that is something that can all be adjusted with software.

[01:24] The thing is this.

[01:26] I really know that a lot of people are excited about alien.

[01:30] And I really want everyone who is excited about this pinball machine to get their game.

[01:36] But there's still some... I don't know, maybe it's just me guys.

[01:40] But there are hard questions that I still am like...

[01:44] I hope people are still asking.

[01:46] Why doesn't the US team have games yet to finish the game?

[01:52] Orc said it himself that the US team who is handling the programming, the lighting, the animation, the sound, they don't have games yet.

[02:02] Even Joe, who's... I think he's doing the programming, doesn't have the xenomack or final ramps.

[02:08] So why are games going out to Hilton, to other locations for people to play, before they're going to the actual team members who are finishing the game?

[02:22] Doesn't anyone find that kind of strange?

[02:26] And then again, the investigative reporter in me is just like, well, it's kind of obvious.

[02:34] Andrew needs hype, he needs people and needs orders to come in.

[02:38] And like, I don't blame him, I mean, he needs that to happen.

[02:41] I just think, you know, it could still be a while before final production games go on the line.

[02:48] And I think too, you know, if you look at the way they positioned those first few games that went out, it was kind of like...

[02:55] William Pimball is now shipping productions begun. And that's not the case.

[02:59] These are prototype beta units that are out in the wild for testing. And that's cool. That's cool.

[03:06] But man, I just wish people would be honest about what these games are and what they signify.

[03:13] And there's a difference between Jersey Jack putting some dialed in on location months ago, and when dialed in's will actually ship.

[03:22] The gap there could be four to six months between real production begins.

[03:28] So I don't know what the case is. All I know is this. It's getting closer.

[03:33] And you guys who are in on alien are have to be excited by what you see.

[03:38] And I hope you get your game soon. I hope you get your game soon.

[03:41] And I hope the guys who are building the game get physical games soon so that they can polish it.

[03:47] You know, two years waiting for alien, I think this machine should ship pretty, pretty final.

[03:53] So what else is going on? Magic Girl. I just want to say quickly, Pimball News put up a great YouTube video that has 10 minutes of Magic Girl gameplay.

[04:03] And what you'll see on that is what I've been experiencing on the machine.

[04:07] You'll see 10 minutes of beautiful lights, beautiful music, beautiful call outs that all connect in a chaotic circus of like of of Pimball.

[04:20] There's nothing to shoot for. There's no code that directs you on what to do.

[04:26] It's it's almost in a weird way like it's fun to flip, but there's nothing flipping going on. Like you don't really know what to do.

[04:34] And I think at this point, at this point, the Magic Girl conversation is going to like nose dive because people are going to realize these games are what they are.

[04:45] There are 25 unique novelty items. There is nothing interesting to be seen or found when you explore the gameplay.

[04:53] It's just a lot of random stuff going on at the same time.

[04:56] I think the people trying to sell these machines for 30 and I saw one for 33, one for 50,000.

[05:02] One is on there on eBay for 45,000. And look, I'm not happy. He didn't ask me to use my photos. So fat train.

[05:10] You know, I don't think it's super cool that you like grab my photos without my permission and listed it on eBay. I'll tell you why.

[05:18] Because I got so many people being like, are you selling your machine? Like, is this a joke? Like just do. Just like ask me.

[05:26] Like I just think it's sort of common courtesy if you're going to take someone's photos of their machine and ask their permission, especially because you're using photos that are my house, like inside my home.

[05:36] And you didn't even ask permission. So like I'm not, I don't, you know, whatever. I don't care. I know you said it's other owner's machines.

[05:43] But I think everyone trying to cash out on magic girl is doing it all wrong. And you can't have multiple people selling such a high end thing all at the same time.

[05:54] If these owners were smart, they'd all get together and slowly sell one every few months. Instead, they're like flooding the market.

[06:02] There's more freaking magic girls available than Batman SLEs. There's more magic girls available than Ghostbusters Lles right now.

[06:09] And I think, I think it's silly. I think they're not going to sell. And if I were a buyer, I would just hold on to my money and see where this whole thing nets out in a few months. There's no reason to rush in right now.

[06:20] I heard from Stern a little bit. I've been prodding to see when I can get information on Star Wars. They still won't confirm it. They won't tell me when. It sounds like we're not going to hear anything on Star Wars for a while.

[06:32] They're just backlog. There's a big backlog. I think they had something like a thousand Ghostbusters orders that they're still waiting to get to.

[06:41] So it's exciting to see so much excitement around Ghostbusters. But there's still a lot of time before we're going to see anything about Star Wars.

[06:49] What else is going on? I think some more Captain Nemo's have been going out, which is exciting. Beautiful pen. Love seeing that game out in the wild.

[06:58] I look forward to playing one. The machine works, which is great. I love like a tiny run machine that actually plays. That is an awesome thing.

[07:08] We're getting closer and closer to Texas Pinball festival. I will be down there. I look forward to going. I think anyone who's going to the show this year, it's going to be an amazing show.

[07:18] I'm going to break a little bit of an exclusive for you guys. Talk to some of the folks over at American Pinball.

[07:24] And their plan, I don't know if this is going to happen or not, their plan is to physically bring Houdini to the show.

[07:31] So you will be able to see Joe Balser and the Houdini that American Pinball has been working on.

[07:39] I am a little bit saddened to learn that Matt Andrews, the artist who did the amazing Houdini artwork that we saw previously, his work will not be carried over onto that machine.

[07:50] Personally, I think that is a mistake, but it might not be a mistake. I have to see the artists that they went with.

[07:57] I have said it before though. They really visually won people over with John's version of Houdini.

[08:04] And so once you get how good it can look in someone's head, even if it didn't shoot, once you get how good it can look, I hope the art that they deliver is of the same caliber.

[08:17] So that's a little bit of Pinball news. I am enjoying my Nintendo Switch. I really believe in what I said last time guys that I am sort of getting over this whole notion that every time I want to play a Pinball game or collect a new one, I am going to be dropping $10,000.

[08:32] I am over it. I think a lot of people are going to start to get over this and realize if you live within close proximity to other collectors or to like barcades or to other locations where you can see the art that they are going to be collecting.

[08:46] I have to see the art that they are going to be collecting and playing Pinball.

[08:52] I do not see the need anymore to just buy these games, to buy it and own it and have it and spend so much money on them.

[08:57] I just think it doesn't make sense. I am kind of stepping one foot out of this desire to chase everything.

[09:04] Does this mean I won't keep flipping games when there is hot new games? Of course I will, that is easy money, easy money, easy money.

[09:12] Um, all right guys, I want to, and you know, as we go into this Jerry interview, I want to say something and I think

[09:17] I think Jerry has sort of done it right and here's the here's my approach on this podcast and this has always been my opinion

[09:24] If you are a pinball manufacturer and you don't take people's money early

[09:30] You don't mislead people you simply put your nose to the grindstone and make your pinball machine

[09:37] And then you take money when the games are actually going into production

[09:42] I will always applaud those individuals right so on a on a manufacturing level

[09:48] I always applaud people who do it that way if you're gonna treat pinball and your pinball company

[09:55] Like it's a used car sales law and you're a used car salesman and you're constantly spinning you're constantly lying

[10:02] You're constantly setting expectations that don't come true

[10:07] You're not gonna be a fan of my of me

[10:10] You're not gonna be a fan of this podcast and I'm gonna call you out on it

[10:14] And I think that what you know people can have all sorts of opinions about P3 and multi-mortem

[10:20] Whether or not you like the offering

[10:22] To me that's irrelevant because

[10:25] Look, I'll let you guys make up your mind on it. I'm still on the fence about P3

[10:29] I want to play more but I want to see what the future holds

[10:32] I do applaud Jerry for for going out and and innovating and thinking about pinball differently

[10:38] But I really applaud Jerry for not being a salesman for not being

[10:45] Disingenuous for not making people wait for years and having them sort of scratch their heads and pain every night

[10:51] And I think he's a class act and I think when you act that way you deserve respect

[10:57] I mean, I think that's that's life like in general and and and for that you know

[11:02] I'm excited to see what these guys are doing and another thing that Jerry's doing right is he's starting small

[11:09] You have to start small when you build a pinball company you have to take baby steps

[11:14] If you want to survive you know

[11:16] I've been hyper critical in the past of of Andrew highway like building a big factory

[11:21] Slapping his name on the side of the wall building all this big machinery like gearing up for mass production and then

[11:27] Hardly selling any full throttles for years, you know

[11:30] It's like you got to start small you got to start small

[11:33] You can't try to scale up too fast or you'll quickly find yourself

[11:38] Financially in a hole that might be impossible to get out of and if anyone out there thinks that the financial burdens that have played

[11:46] Jjp that have plagued highway

[11:49] Are just gone. I think you're fooling yourselves. I think you're fooling yourselves

[11:54] And I think Jerry's doing it right and I want you guys to listen to how Jerry talks about contract manufacturing because that is a topic that

[12:01] Has completely become a cancerous term

[12:05] Especially with what we think about with Dutch pinball, but Jerry's doing it differently

[12:09] He's doing it differently. He's not relying on them to make the parts for his game

[12:13] They're simply assembling the game with all the parts that that that he's made so without further ado

[12:20] I want to air this and and I want to let you guys listen to sort of Jerry explain the milestone there at and I want everyone to keep an open mind with

[12:29] P3 because

[12:31] You know like I'll be honest

[12:32] I'm not quite sure the titles are there yet, but I think the platform has extreme potential and and I think he knows that and I think getting up a

[12:42] User-base will open the door for those sort of themes and maybe licensed themes that people are craving for on the platform that can really make the platform sing

[12:51] But I think he's sort of he's on to something if he can make it work because what he's hitting on is this nerve that

[12:59] Every time you want to play a new game you got to drop

[13:03] 8,000 10,000 15,000 dollars that's a sign that model

[13:09] I just don't think it's gonna stick around forever. So let's air it. I've talked enough on this intro

[13:16] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna roll the tape of Jerry and canada fireside chat

[13:22] All right, ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome back to the show

[13:27] Jerry Stellenberg of P3 and multi-morphic Jerry. It's been about like a year

[13:32] So I'm excited for us to catch up again and see where things are at with with the platform

[13:38] Yeah, absolutely Chris. Let's talk to you again. Yeah, it's been too long

[13:41] I know we've sort of seen each other and passing at shows and a lot is transpired in the

[13:47] Pimbal world over the last

[13:50] 365 days

[13:52] But let's let's jump right into where you guys are at because I probably cover everyone else all the time and I haven't given you guys

[14:01] Enough air time. So I really want to talk about where you guys are at and what's like the next like six months to a year hold for for you guys

[14:08] Yeah, great. No, and I appreciate where you're coming from to we've been kind of under the radar

[14:13] And we've done it intentionally and unintentionally

[14:17] and it's it's nice to get onto a platform and talk about things

[14:23] But it's also nice to be able to just head down develop and try to you know create a new product and create games

[14:29] And that's what we've been doing a lot of so we talked last right after the Texas pinball fest last year

[14:35] I think we did and it's we're right on the eve of that and I'm going back

[14:40] Are you gonna be there this year? We are going to be there TPS is our home show

[14:46] We're using that as our launching platform as our as our big show to announce new games like we did last year

[14:54] And this year to announce or not to announce because we've already done it

[14:58] But to show people that we really are building a machine. We're actually in production. So we're

[15:04] We're gearing up for this show. We want to show people we're building machines and we have new games and we hope to make a big deal of it

[15:10] Great. So let's talk about that. So let's talk about production when you guys say you're in production

[15:15] What what does that mean because we hear that word a lot

[15:18] What how do you define it and and what what is production look like for you guys?

[15:22] Well, let me give you a two-day example

[15:25] I will just got home a couple hours ago from working at the contract or with the contract

[15:30] Manufacturing partner that we're using and we were doing inventory on all the parts that are coming in so that we can put

[15:36] Machines together in the next week or two

[15:38] Nice. So we've been taking orders for a while and what we call those zero-dollar pre-orders

[15:43] We've been taking them for Jesus. It's been a year and a half now before that we had we had a bunch of paid pre-orders

[15:50] We've been talking about building these machines for a long time and we're finally there

[15:54] So we are

[15:55] Building 25 machines in the next few weeks and a lot of those are going to customers and a lot of those are in a few of them are staying with us for

[16:03] You know all the things that we need to do on them continue developing do certifications do shiptests and all that kind of stuff

[16:09] That you need to do to be a real company right? So walk me through production with contract manufacturing because I know that

[16:16] That's a term that's been thrown out there. I think everyone is really familiar with with sort of the Dutch pinball problems or having

[16:24] But you guys have a contract manufacturer and so you work with them to sort of

[16:30] Spec out everything it takes to build these machines the parts are then ordered and and they're ordering parts for how many machines for this first run

[16:38] Is it for the 25 or I'm sure there's a few extra parts for that you guys will order as well

[16:43] How many initial machines do you need order parts for to get production going with with the contract manufacturer?

[16:49] Yeah, if you don't mind let's take a step back because you said a couple of things using a couple of pronouns that I disagree with

[16:54] Okay, you said very specifically that

[16:58] We work with them to define the specs to define the the the build process we work with them

[17:04] I think you even hinted that they're ordering parts and in reality

[17:08] The way we've structured our relationship with a contract manufacturer is that we

[17:13] Control at least in the very short term we control everything

[17:17] We we design the machine we do the assembly instructions

[17:21] Let me yeah, we talked to them to get their expertise and to learn their processes and what they like to do and how

[17:27] How their people like to you know build stuff, but we define all the assembly instructions we define the test instructions

[17:33] We define the shipping process

[17:35] We define all the things that it takes to do from the point of ordering parts to shipping machines and

[17:44] We're not reliant on them for anything at this point except space and additional hands

[17:50] Okay, so you're so walk me through that so you're basically

[17:55] Teaching them how to make your product right? Yes, and that's actually the definition of contract manufacturer

[18:01] We are contracting them to help us manufacture a product

[18:05] But we designed a multi-morphic one to the designs we own the IP we own everything so

[18:10] We take all this

[18:12] intellectual property including all these instructions that I talked about assembly instructions and test instructions and we go in there and we work with their people to essentially

[18:24] Sit on a line or or sit in a you know a

[18:28] A build station and build sub assemblies or assemble a full machine

[18:32] They do it under our direction of course they don't work

[18:36] The employees there work for their boss, which is the company the manufacturing company, but there are client

[18:43] and we are paying them

[18:45] to

[18:46] Or there are provider there are vendor we're a client, but we're paying them to help us build these machines the way we want to have them built

[18:54] so

[18:55] We buy the parts the parts get delivered to them we help them inventory it we assign all of our

[19:00] multi-morphic part numbers to it

[19:03] We sit down with their people with assembly instructions and set of workstations and

[19:08] Help them build the machine for us

[19:11] We monitor the process we watch them test it we test it with them

[19:16] We work with them on our customer list to define you know the shipping

[19:20] And instructions for all the customers there are a few different things we send to different customers because we have a lot of different products that we offer

[19:28] You know different kinds of games and different combinations of play fields and those kind of things

[19:32] So it's uh it's it's not a case where

[19:36] We rely on them to help us design stuff from the own so my pee and then we can get into a you know a interesting discussion about who owns what and

[19:44] And those kind of things we own everything in this relationship we're at design house and and we use them to help build it

[19:49] Okay

[19:51] Well, that's good. I think it's good news. I think um that is very reassuring and it's

[19:55] Talk to me Jerry because I think I mean, I'm definitely a neo-flight to sort of

[20:00] Sort of contract manufacturing and how to make a pinball machine

[20:03] What what was it like like training people and teaching them how to make your baby?

[20:07] Was it was it nerve-wracking after all the years? You're like watching them like wait

[20:12] You know to make sure that it they do it right how how long did it take to sort of

[20:17] Bring these people up the speed on your vision. Well, it's it's never finished

[20:21] It's all it's it's a process and you know, it's one of those things where I don't know when you teach someone a new sport or someone a new

[20:29] A new skill you know, they're never they're never finished learning

[20:33] I'm never finished learning how to do my job. I can get better at it over time

[20:37] So um, it's you know you you define instructions hopefully well enough that they could sit in a room by themselves and follow your instructions and build the machine

[20:46] but

[20:48] It's it's it's a little different here in the sense that these are people who are skilled at assembling stuff

[20:56] Right the contract manufacturer they are people that are comfortable manufacturing things

[21:01] They're they're comfortable with soldering irons and turning screwdrivers and and putting mechanical subassemblies together

[21:07] So there's really nothing well actually let's step a take a step back again because

[21:12] When we talk about pinball machine manufacturing traditionally that means

[21:18] uh, very specific things and manufacturers of traditional pinball machines have to understand pinball

[21:25] Because playfields are these these

[21:29] uh

[21:30] Assemblies that have pinball specific things they have these huge wiring harnesses that are complex and they have to have all these mechanical things interacting the right way

[21:39] And it's difficult for someone just

[21:42] Off the street not familiar with the pinball machine to put those together

[21:45] But the p3 is different because of the way we designed it because of the

[21:49] modularity of it because of the way we

[21:52] You know can slide in and out these flipper assemblies are the back playfield the physical playfield portions in the back and

[21:58] They can build all these things as completely separate subassemblies

[22:03] And they can just do it to our simple instructions. So we have we have I think it's 12

[22:08] subassemblies in the machine

[22:10] We have a button boxes our flipper assemblies our

[22:14] We're playfield modules are our vuk assembly which we call it trough

[22:18] The wall scoop assembly that the base cabinet the back box these are all subassemblies that somebody can build separately

[22:25] And they can test them separately

[22:26] We have what we call p3 in a box

[22:29] Which is a it's our control system with a p3 rock and couple driver boards and switch boards and we can hook that up to

[22:37] A subassembly like the wall scoop assembly and stick it in a test jig and run a program on a computer that just

[22:44] Cycle tests the wall scoop assembly over and over and over and over again

[22:48] We've cycled our flipper assemblies over a million times to test

[22:52] You know the linkage strength or the

[22:55] the

[22:57] Illuminum hit we have aluminum flipper bats hitting the ball over and over and over again to make sure they're reliable

[23:02] So we're going through these process

[23:03] But the point is that they can assemble these sub assemblies in standalone stations

[23:08] Instead of trying to assemble an entire pinball machine on this crazy assembly line

[23:13] right and I think I think there's a really big innovation. I think when you look at the

[23:19] This stern assembly line as impressive as it is

[23:23] It does feel like an old school sort of like how you know how to build a car back in the Henry Ford days

[23:30] To make it that way and when something does go wrong, right like there is an issue

[23:36] um the whole

[23:37] Thing sort of either has to stop

[23:40] Right, you can't keep going or

[23:43] Or the worst case scenarios they just they just say we have to keep the line going and they start shipping stuff out when they know there's issues

[23:51] Um, which is it is not a real solution. So this this how many people how many people

[23:58] In total Jerry does it take to sort of bring the the p3 to life

[24:03] In terms of the assembly line is it is it 20 people is it

[24:06] 15 is it 10 is it 100 so I can give you specific examples when we were building our

[24:14] Production sample machines which are the same machines we're going to build production

[24:17] But we built them ourselves just to make sure that the processes were we're well defined

[24:22] We had two people build two machines in a weekend

[24:25] Oh

[24:28] You throw more people at it and you can have one person doing each sub assembly each sub assembly takes an hour or two or the

[24:34] Super complex one is our wall scoop assembly that one could take three or four hours for a single person to do

[24:40] But um a group of people could put a p3 together in just a couple hours or one person could do it in you know a day or two

[24:47] And again, it's because see you mentioned the the stern the stern uh assembly line and they've gotten very good at doing

[24:54] It the way they do it and that's great

[24:57] um, but with our sub assembly structure and with our

[25:01] modular board system we don't rely on that huge

[25:05] Complex wiring harness. We don't have to use peg boards and other things. We can just go to our our partners and ask

[25:11] Ask them to build you know if we're going to build 25 machines we ask them to build some set of

[25:18] wiring harnesses for each sub assembly and they can they can do that their point to point cables or maybe a

[25:24] three or four connector cable and they can build those ship into us and we literally just plug them onto our sub assembly after the

[25:30] Mechanicals are built so it's it's a it's a different and it's not a neither way is good or bad they all have their pros and cons

[25:39] We just have the ability to leverage and we do it on purpose because we're experts at design. We're not experts at manufacturing and

[25:46] And it's not something we want to do day to day

[25:49] So we leverage people who are good at doing those things right

[25:53] And I think it's I think it's smart you know, I think a lot of

[25:57] a lot of times

[25:58] When people try to build the entire like they try to build a pinball machine and a manufacturing facility

[26:05] And they bite off so much at the beginning right and I think what's good too is you guys are

[26:10] You're walking before you run with assembly here, right? So we're talking

[26:14] 25 machines initially

[26:16] Jerry when are you expecting those 25 machines or when are you expecting games to start going after customers?

[26:23] Yeah, so we've told customers that we're building machines in March

[26:27] And that we're shipping them in April and that of course depends on things going correctly

[26:31] And not finding any issues with vendor parts and those kind of things, but that's a plan

[26:36] Nice so that that's that's like now right?

[26:40] That's why I just got back from the from we call this CM the contract manufacturer

[26:44] I just got back from the CM and like I said we were doing part inventories and making sure we have all the parts in stock

[26:49] Are you guys putting any games out on location as well to get some

[26:53] Player feedback we will we have not yet we've taken on machine every now and then we take it to Buffalo Billiards

[26:59] Which is a nice location in downtown Austin to get some some feedback from players, but

[27:06] When you take a machine onto location the only way you're going to get real numbers is if the machines reliable and

[27:11] It has the features that your production machines going to have and all that so we haven't gotten to that point yet

[27:16] But now we're there because we're building these production machines one of the we're keeping eight machines for ourselves

[27:22] And like I said before a few of those will go to developers and we'll use others for other reasons

[27:26] But we expect to take two of those and put them in locations in Austin and do that location testing and get you know

[27:34] Coin drop feedback and all that stuff right

[27:36] You know, it's interesting. I was just talking about the coin drop location

[27:41] Metrics with with some other people and with the p3 it's an interesting discussion because

[27:47] The p3 is a multi-game system

[27:49] So if we take the machine and put it on location and you know

[27:53] Gage how many people are gonna pay to play what are they paying to play?

[27:57] They're not paying to play the p3 they're paying to play the game that's installed in the p3

[28:03] Which is most likely a lexelite speed type game for for a

[28:08] traditional pinball type in the environment or maybe it's a canon lagoon type game for redemption environment

[28:14] But that metric we can't just take a p3 and people say oh people either love or hate the p3 because they put in x number dollars

[28:21] It's it's a really a judgment of the game

[28:23] Yeah, and I think that yeah, and I've always said that I mean I think at the end of the day

[28:28] um

[28:32] new

[28:34] Approaches to pinball um but the games itself will ultimately be what excite people and and and that is that's that's true of anything right?

[28:41] I mean it's true video game councils. It's true of of any platform

[28:44] It is as good as the software that is on the platform

[28:49] So you've got to be excited because I know this has been a long journey to get to this stage

[28:55] How long

[28:56] Has this been in development in in in totality?

[28:59] That word long is interesting to me because some days it feels super short and some days

[29:04] For long but you know in relation to some of the other manufacturers it actually hasn't been that long

[29:09] We are we are almost exactly five years from our first

[29:15] Show with our super early p3 prototype. It was a I don't know if I don't know if you were you were at the shows back then

[29:23] It was at tpf 2012 or my time we had a white

[29:27] I mean it was it was literally a whitewood it was or actually it was white pvc board that we

[29:34] We we

[29:35] Basically built around our ball tracking LCD system

[29:39] We had a very primitive long scoop system and we had a basic play field layout up top that wasn't modular at the time

[29:45] Um, that was just our early concept and we took it to tpf and people really liked it so we decided to make a go of it and

[29:52] Uh since then in five years we've designed

[29:57] A new type of pinball platform from the ground up. We've had to invent new flippers. We've had to invent

[30:04] Jesus even our even our buttons on the side of the cabinet can't go through the wood like traditional buttons do because they run into our play field structure

[30:11] So we've had to change a whole lot. We've designed a lot from scratch and we've done it. This is the important bit

[30:18] We've done it without significant financial backing so

[30:22] It's taken us five years, but most of those five years are people working nights and weekends and helping us out of their passions for pinball and the passion for the ideas that we're pushing

[30:32] So it's it's been an interesting ride and we're super excited to get to production for sure

[30:38] No, I mean it's it's been great. I mean look it's the other game

[30:42] Yeah, I laugh because I hear five years and and and I've played p3 and it works and I'm as I look at my magic girl

[30:49] Five years and it doesn't even work so I think you have a step up on other machines that have been been worked on for a while

[30:55] But you're doing something completely different and I think we all know that and no one is um

[31:00] It's it's not an apples the apples comparison against what other manufacturers are doing

[31:05] Let's talk about the package itself and the platform itself so at launch what

[31:11] What games will be available when when this thing comes out hopefully in April? Yep, so we've

[31:18] For a long time been talking about lexelite speed and the p3

[31:24] When it comes out will ship with lexelite speed escape from earth

[31:28] That's the first game that was the one designed by Dennis Nordman and the one we've been showing it shows for a while to traditional style game

[31:35] People who bought in early one of the bonuses they got for buying in early or for signing up early the zero dollar pre-orders

[31:42] Also get this is that it also comes with our can on the goon playfield our that's the redemption style

[31:48] Less complex layout less complex rules and just gives people you know something fun to to shoot at

[31:55] So it comes with the can of the goon playfield it comes with rocks, which is our

[31:59] Our kind of asteroid style video game implemented on a physical pinball machine with the real ball interacting with the asteroids

[32:07] I mean, it's gonna ship with a mini game

[32:10] That we built with lexelite speed which is called lexelite speed

[32:14] The secret agent showdown, which is a it's an eight ball

[32:19] multi-ball mini game

[32:21] Where instead of playing a three ball pinball game like people are used to if feeds you one ball at a time

[32:28] You try to lock it

[32:30] If you don't lock it you shoot it into a hole or it drains

[32:34] Then that balls gone and you get another ball and you work through eight balls you have a chance to lock all eight balls

[32:39] And then you get to play the multi-ball

[32:41] So that's a you know, it's a little fun multi-ball

[32:44] mini game version of lexelite speed

[32:47] And then our last game is our children's game barnyard, which is just a simple

[32:52] game that that really young kids can hopefully

[32:57] Use to get into pinball to learn how to flip to interact with animals to hear the animals make sounds to spin them around and

[33:03] And just just you know get them interested in pinballed young age right

[33:06] No, and when you showed the demos of all the different games last year at tpf

[33:12] And I think what I walked away was there really is

[33:16] Something for everyone and especially for entry level pinball

[33:20] There's nothing out there. I mean we've we've talked about it before

[33:24] But there's if you have a young kid and is he really gonna jump on ecdc

[33:30] So I think that there is a lot of

[33:32] Potential here to make a game that could be the gateway to some of the

[33:37] You know

[33:37] Even some of the games that will be on your platform, but just pinball in general as as you know

[33:42] You have to learn step by step like first how to do ball control

[33:45] And I know you guys are working too with like tutorials on ball control and

[33:49] And other elements that like teach you pinball right? I mean that's what's cool about the platform

[33:53] There's absolutely no pinball machine out there that teaches you pinball

[33:58] Well, yeah, and we can get into that. That's one of our one of the new games that we we just announced that we're going to show off with tpf

[34:03] But before we do that, let's talk real briefly about why about why there aren't other machines that do that kind of thing that teach you how to play or that

[34:11] That give you an interesting game experience for young kids

[34:15] And it's it's a risk problem for other manufacturers when you're shipping a machine

[34:23] With a single game on it that game

[34:28] If it sells really well, you can continue operating as a company

[34:32] And if it doesn't sell well, you've sunk a lot of money into it and your your you might be in trouble

[34:37] So people running single themed pinball businesses have to make

[34:44] Interesting decisions about what kind of content they develop and in the pinball industry we know

[34:50] What pinball enthusiasts enjoy they enjoy these semi

[34:54] Not super deep all the time, but semi complex rule sets interesting shot layouts and those kind of things and if you give them something different

[35:02] You have to be ready for the fallout for people saying this isn't what I'm used to this isn't

[35:09] I don't want it right and they might eventually

[35:13] Play it and enjoy it, but if you're building a single themed machine and sell it and in that first year that you're selling it

[35:21] You know 50 people buy it you're in trouble

[35:24] But when you develop this this platform

[35:28] You can do that kind of stuff we can take some time we can develop barnyard wasn't I mean obviously if you see it

[35:34] It's not a super intricate game it didn't take us years to develop or months to develop it was a pretty

[35:41] Quick development cycle and it's something that had absolutely zero risk or very little risk for the company right

[35:48] Well, let's let's talk let's talk about that so

[35:51] And and I've always said this I mean it's it's when you're a new company you're getting off the ground

[35:56] Your first few titles are important right and it's it's you've got to still have that

[36:02] Sort of halo title that will get people super excited about the platform

[36:07] We've seen Lexi for a while is is the next game or then you know the next sort of game that's geared towards the

[36:15] The hardcore pinball guy is that currently in development?

[36:18] I know you address like the license team issuing in your last email

[36:22] But what what's next for people who you know want the more hardcore pinball game?

[36:28] So yes, we have Lexi lightspeed and then we have a bunch of games that are so

[36:32] Let me start that over again

[36:34] We have Lexi lightspeed escape from earth

[36:35] Which is a traditional style game which is for mostly pinball enthusiasts

[36:40] Then we have all these other games which are to help broaden the appeal of the p3 and hit other markets

[36:46] I'm cosmic heart racing the game that we announced

[36:49] Back when we started

[36:51] Basically when we went public with the machine

[36:53] We we were talking about this second play field layout that's going to be very high speed ramps and loops and you know

[36:59] Very flow oriented game, which is what pinball enthusiasts like that's the next play field we're working on

[37:04] cool, and that

[37:06] Possibly by the end of 2017 right yes, that's our plan

[37:10] but we have a

[37:13] Single group of mechanical engineers that are finishing up the machine working to help us get through production and

[37:19] They're the ones that are also working with cosmic heart racing

[37:21] So our plan is definitely to release it by the end of the year

[37:23] But you never know when this in this industry

[37:25] No, aren't we get if we get near the end of the year just keep telling everyone it'll be out in two weeks and then you can sit at for another six months

[37:32] Okay, but by crazy I want to talk real briefly about that that what you said earlier about

[37:39] Those first two games or whatever being what maker break a platform

[37:44] I think you're right

[37:46] In the sense that video game platforms have to have that super awesome super amazing

[37:54] game

[37:56] We sports for the Nintendo wasn't wasn't super complex, but it was a blast to play

[38:02] It was the greatest demo game ever like people played it with their girlfriend at you know

[38:07] And then they're like I'll get it it was and we all we all got it just for that and then

[38:12] Yeah, two hours later you're like yeah

[38:15] I'm good with this

[38:17] But but for pinball

[38:21] We have a couple of challenges one of our markets not super big so we don't have the opportunity some millions of platforms

[38:29] so

[38:30] The other problem is of course that these machines are super expensive to build with lots of intricate engineering involved and mechanical assemblies and all this stuff

[38:38] So just getting off the ground with a new machine as you can see with all the manufacturers is a super huge challenge

[38:45] when you combine the engineering

[38:48] uh

[38:48] The engineering obstacles and creating something like the p3 and you add to that

[38:54] The risk and the cost and the time and the interface to do some kind of high-value license

[39:02] It's kind of a non-starter you can't take all your resources and throw them at a

[39:08] a studio

[39:10] asset and IP of a you know a movie or a

[39:13] uh

[39:14] Whatever a rock band or or whatever you can't take this startup money like I said we're bootstraps

[39:18] So we couldn't afford to go spend a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand dollars on a big license

[39:24] And hope that we could develop it on this new platform which we also didn't know if it worked

[39:28] So we couldn't attack the market like that our our plan was to and still is to

[39:34] Develop this platform that's capable of

[39:37] Of delivering both traditional gameplay and new gameplay and the content will come

[39:42] If we put out a platform that doesn't work

[39:44] Contents meaningless

[39:45] But if we put out a platform that works and has an interesting developers kit and has interesting features that people want to want to interact with

[39:53] The content will come and we want to of course deliver content and we're also working with third parties to develop content too

[40:00] So so it will come and it's coming let me ask you a question because and

[40:04] A lot of what we've talked about is is sort of sort of the third party support and

[40:10] Where is that at right now are there people with

[40:13] Machines developing

[40:15] What's going on with with additional support for you guys?

[40:19] So one of the games so we talked about

[40:22] Up a couple games coming out

[40:24] That we had just previously announced that we're going to start showing off the tpf

[40:27] We hinted that one of them's a training game which you touched on very briefly earlier

[40:31] One of the other games is a third party developed app that runs on top of our Ken and Lincoln playfield

[40:38] So there are people that have our dev kit that are

[40:41] Interacting with us trying to learn how to develop games and the first game that's been developed on top of our dev kit will be shown at tpf

[40:51] So that's super exciting you asked specifically how many

[40:54] Machines are out there and who's developing play fields and things like that

[40:58] There aren't any we have the machines that the prototype machines are here in our office

[41:04] but as part of this

[41:06] 25 machine production run

[41:09] We will now have machines that we can start giving to people or selling to people and

[41:14] Getting them time for developing these kinds of play fields got it

[41:19] Okay, I mean it makes sense. I mean you guys are again walking before running. Let's get let's get these things built

[41:25] Let's figure out how to build them

[41:27] Let's make sure they're working properly and and and basically you know get start to get them out there and and then once we sort of get them out there get feedback

[41:39] People get introduced to it. We can start to think about putting newer games on the platform and introducing

[41:46] Because I think I think the appeal jerry right and what you've been saying is

[41:50] When people try to go and build a traditional pinball machine from the ground up

[41:56] We've seen we've seen people fail nine out of ten times and when we see it all the time. It's like

[42:02] It's such a monumental task, but your platform if you have an idea

[42:08] It doesn't require that level of designing from the bottom of the play field to the top

[42:15] It does you know you can look at it in a modular sense right and and sort of bringing the creative idea life

[42:21] In a way that doesn't require this this almost like

[42:26] Extreme amounts of pinball knowledge to build a whole machine. Yeah, well

[42:32] It's interesting when we think about it relative to the p-rock we came out with the p-rock board

[42:37] Jesus been almost eight years ago and our theory was

[42:42] Now that we've designed this control system that you can use you no longer have to be an electronics expert to design a pinball machine

[42:49] And look what happened the the industry went through this resurgence and a lot of people started building machines some hobbyists and some manufacturers

[42:57] And some succeeded and some failed and what we learned is that

[43:01] Just because you don't have to be an electronics expert to design a pinball machine that doesn't mean that you should be designing and selling

[43:09] Yes

[43:10] But but throughout the development of the p3 we've created this platform that eliminates a lot more of the obstacles

[43:16] Um, so somebody with an idea

[43:18] They don't need to go learn how to build a learn how to build a cabinet to design a control system to wire it up to

[43:24] You know, they don't even have to learn how to manufacture it because now we have all the contacts and the relationships with vendors

[43:30] Parts vendors we can go get wire forms made or ramps made or we have good relationship with the printer

[43:34] We can get things printed and we can do all these things

[43:38] So somebody with an idea can just get you play field maybe work with somebody to put it in CAD and and then we can build it

[43:45] It's it's a

[43:47] Very different

[43:49] Design paradigm than the pinball industry has seen before because we've done all our work

[43:54] Is is one of your long term goals to eventually

[43:58] Allow other pinball manufacturers to license and build a game on your platform

[44:05] Yes

[44:07] It has it tantly because um, it's it's really up to them as far as we're concerned

[44:13] We are a manufacturer of a platform that is open to the world

[44:17] Right, I mean, it almost feels a little bit like the unreal engine right?

[44:19] I mean if you build something that other people can tap into

[44:24] Yeah, but here's the deal Chris

[44:26] I might have said this before I'm going to say it last year, but if we have a thousand or two thousand machines out in the wild

[44:33] Those are customers that have machines that want new games

[44:38] So does it make sense to design the machines from the ground up and force people to make space in their house

[44:43] Or does it make sense to take advantage of this customer base that's already there in itching for games and oh by the way

[44:49] You can sell in that game for a thousand or two thousand dollars instead of eight or nine thousand dollars

[44:54] Right, so

[44:55] Let's talk price because I think it's

[44:58] You know, I just did a podcast or this earlier today

[45:01] Where I was just like I don't know. Maybe I'm just feeling the burn of dropping over 20 grand on a magic girl

[45:07] That doesn't work and I'm playing like a $400 and tend to switch big like what where did my life go wrong?

[45:15] But you're price where the market is right now. So we're talking

[45:20] for the for the

[45:22] Unit itself for the p3 machine with lexelite speed

[45:25] Escape from earth

[45:26] We're talking roughly 10 grand. I see it as 9,875 dollars correct. Yes. That's right

[45:33] And then when we announced that a year ago people said we were crazy

[45:37] Yeah, I mean, I don't look I I've been saying this for so long that everyone else who start has been a startup or new to the game

[45:46] They priced themselves into bankruptcy all of them like except for spooky

[45:52] Everyone else set a price. I mean we go back now. We look at wizard of Oz being initially priced at $6500 and you're just like okay

[46:00] Cool, that's awesome just and it's almost like

[46:03] So you're price and like let's because that we always hear the term bomb and build build of materials or build on materials

[46:11] And setting that first and knowing what it cost to manufacture and then setting the price you guys feel good at this price with with what the

[46:19] Bomb is what the contract manufacturing cost are like this this gives you guys room to

[46:25] Reinvest in the company go into R&D for new games like this is a this is a good sweet spot for you guys

[46:32] So when you talk about to build a material cost cost to build and sales price which translates to

[46:40] I'm revenue and some percentage hopefully of profit. You can't have that discussion without talking about volume

[46:47] Right if we go to our metal supplier and ask for 10 pieces of our apron

[46:55] They're gonna say okay great it costs $200 a piece

[47:00] And when you multiply that by the you know the 100 different

[47:04] Custom pieces of metal in the machine. It's gonna cost this $20,000 to build a machine

[47:08] But if we go to the metal the metal supplier and ask for 200 aprons

[47:13] They might be $10 a piece or $5 a piece. So having this discussion is kind of irrelevant without talking about volume

[47:21] So if we go and sell

[47:23] 25 machines and we buy parts for 25 machines

[47:27] Then you can imagine we're not gonna get rich

[47:30] Doing that right if we can go out and build 200 machines the time or 500 machines at the time then we can make some good money

[47:38] And we can you know start hiring more people and start paying good money for licenses and start doing all these

[47:43] Crazy things that some people hope we do which is doing crazy graphics on the screen and super high-deaf

[47:49] Animated things and all that stuff and so it's it's more a matter of we have to start growing our business

[47:55] And you keep saying we're walking before running and yes, we're we're starting out slowly

[48:00] It doesn't make sense to build a thousand machine into the first time out the shoot because you have to fine-tune your processes

[48:05] And get everything working right so we'll grow into that if we grow to our projected volumes

[48:10] Then we'll be happy if we grow a lot slower then we'll be working for free for longer right

[48:16] And is part of the need is part of the reason why people pre-order to sort of

[48:22] Take a guesstimate at what volume might be in terms of demand

[48:26] Are you asking why other manufacturers? Yeah, I

[48:29] You know, yeah, I mean when you talk about it because I agree like it's volume is everything when it comes to figuring out the total cost and where the

[48:38] You know is is and I know you've done

[48:42] Sort of like a zero money down pre-order which is kind of probably hard to gauge like who's really and who's really out

[48:47] So at this stage now where you've sent out the communication that things are starting to roll

[48:52] When are you asking for money and and when you know when are you locking people in?

[48:57] So to address your first point

[48:59] It's pretty much impossible to start a pinball company without raising money

[49:04] Because of course these things are complicated and they're physical things that you have to build right

[49:09] And yes, you can get people to work for free if you're lucky and they are passionate about your product and they believe in your vision and they're excited and

[49:17] Talented and all that stuff that's super important

[49:20] But you can't build machines you can't buy parts without money

[49:24] So the two options really are to find investors

[49:27] Which could be getting alone or it could be finding someone who's willing just to you know take a leap with your company and

[49:33] invest or much money to invest

[49:36] Now they want to invest untraditionally

[49:38] You've heard the number thrown around that a new pinball game takes about a million dollars to develop

[49:43] And we could argue whether or not that's true anymore

[49:47] I can tell you for sure if we were paying

[49:50] Our employees for the time they put into it. It would cost well over a million dollars to develop the p3

[49:57] So it's it's a way it's impossible to develop a game without money. So

[50:04] Then there's the fact that a lot of people don't want to invest in pinball companies because it's a small market and you either have a hit

[50:12] If you're lucky and get a good theme that everybody likes or you develop features everybody likes or or it's not going anywhere

[50:18] So it's it's a risk in this well, it's a risk always

[50:22] But it's an especially big risk in the super small niche market

[50:26] So then the option is to announce your game and take pre-orders and hopefully you can get enough pre-orders to

[50:32] Finance the building of their machines

[50:35] But farther hopefully you can get enough pre-orders to justify high enough build volumes

[50:40] So that you can get enough profit

[50:42] So that you can start building extra machines so that you can you know start building up inventory and letting people buy them on the spot

[50:49] It's a super big challenge. It it no, I mean it is and I think what adds to the challenge is

[50:57] The climate of the whole pinball world and let's talk about

[51:03] What's happened over the last year because you guys must be monitoring it and saying to yourselves

[51:08] Like we know our price we know our sort of time frame

[51:12] But and Ben hek you should say this like if people get burned if people lose money if people enter into

[51:20] Deals with other manufacturers like that money evaporates

[51:24] It sucks the life out of the hobby for people and you know potential

[51:28] Customers and collectors disappeared on a daily basis because they just get fed up

[51:33] What what are your thoughts on just what you guys have seen transpire as and and I give you guys credit because you're

[51:40] You're nose to the grindstone you're not out there making all these false promises on a weekly or monthly basis

[51:46] And you've just seen these like other ventures

[51:50] Suck the life I feel like out of the hobby in a lot of ways

[51:54] It's it's a little bit depressing

[51:58] For two reasons one is that the p-rock was one of the things that enabled some of these guys to start businesses that have been failed

[52:07] And there you know there have been a lot of successful companies too or a lot of successful projects at least and but

[52:13] It's depressing that some of these companies have used our products

[52:16] And then and then announced great things taking a lot of money and then failed

[52:20] But it's also depressing because yes exactly what you said we've

[52:24] And we took those zero dollar pre-orders and we knew we would lose some percentage of those

[52:28] I'm almost every person who dropped out said that the reason they dropped out was because they lost money and other machine and

[52:34] Couldn't no longer afford the p3

[52:37] Yeah, it's you know, it's it's true like

[52:40] People on just even you know some guys like deep pockets

[52:44] But there's like just the principle and I'm as I read even like pin-side and just follow stuff with like

[52:51] The Dutch pinball issue going on now or it's like

[52:54] When people have waited a really long time and their money's been tied up a really long time

[52:59] Even if they have the money they just start to develop this

[53:03] anxiety and this hesitation

[53:06] To supporting more pinball and I think it sucks because I do think that

[53:11] You guys have done it right and you haven't like anyone that paid in fall like people willingly saw your product

[53:18] Believed in it and invested in it and there wasn't like this

[53:23] You got to pay up now you know and then

[53:26] Years of waiting

[53:27] It was never communicated like that and I applaud you guys and I think that what will help

[53:34] Um is is your approach of like let's get the games out there. Let's show people they're real and

[53:40] And as we get our manufacturing up

[53:44] You know people want to place an order knowing they're gonna get a game within you know like a few months and not a few years

[53:50] Yep, so that's actually where we are now because we're you asked earlier when we were taking money for our pre-orders

[53:56] We announced that we're in production and that was the gate to start asking our

[54:01] Zero-dollar pre-orders for money so in order to to be in

[54:06] For those who didn't want to let their order go

[54:09] They had to put in a deposit and then just this past week was the first

[54:15] Milestone date where they had to put in a significant chunk of money to to basically

[54:20] A confirm their spot

[54:23] We're taking that money. We have another payment at the end of March

[54:27] So right after tpf where they can see the games that we're announcing and they can play the machine again

[54:32] We're other people hopefully we'll see videos

[54:35] Of the machine and we're asking for a second payment

[54:38] We're gonna take those two payments the one just last week and the one at the end of March and we're applying that money directly to

[54:43] Purchasing parts for their machines

[54:46] So this isn't a pay now and then we're gonna get around a billion year machine

[54:49] We've announced that we are building the second production run in June and July

[54:54] Right and I think it's a cheap point

[54:57] The money has to go to the person who's like the person's machine and I I think we're other companies get in the trouble

[55:07] When they have these long delays and people have paid up for years is the new money

[55:13] Goes to

[55:14] building the old orders

[55:17] And and that that is where things start to collapse because

[55:22] You can't get out of that hole

[55:24] Well the thing is Chris people like to be paid to do their jobs

[55:28] Yeah, so the longer it takes to and again

[55:34] 80% of the employees including me at Multimorphic are working for free just because we want to get this machine to market

[55:40] But if you're paying people to work that money's got to come from somewhere and the longer it takes to release that machine

[55:46] The more money you have to spend and you're probably paying rent at a facility or you're probably paying

[55:51] You know artists and and designers and and

[55:56] What not your IP lawyers or whoever and it costs money

[56:00] So there's no way like we talked about it before there's no way to do it without money and new orders bringing money

[56:06] Right

[56:07] Right and it's it's um and to your points of volume game

[56:10] I mean it's that juggling act of okay bringing in new orders

[56:16] um, I need to get to the certain point

[56:19] We're all be okay, and it's it's but I think you guys are doing it right and I think because of that

[56:24] um, you don't have people

[56:27] Badmouthing they come you know people are not angry people are excited to see the games come out

[56:34] um

[56:35] Well, we think you both know that it's pretty quiet related to the p3

[56:38] There are a lot of people saying good or bad things about the p3 because there aren't machines out there yet and because we're not out saying

[56:46] We're taking thousands of pre-orders and things right and and also I think you know and Jerry

[56:50] This is just like the marketer and me it's people have seen it for a while

[56:54] You know, I think people are now you know they want to see it out there. I mean it's it's been it's been around the the tour of shows for a long time

[57:02] People have gotten some some time on it

[57:05] Um, so you know now the next milestone is is is shipment to people and that and that and that'll drum up news and excitement

[57:12] I think you know, there's there's only so much

[57:16] People can you know see the the game at shows before they really okay like let's get it out and I think that's that's where you guys are at

[57:22] So it's good. I mean what what um

[57:26] You know, I'd look I think pricing. I don't think you guys really you know should be too worried

[57:31] I was interesting about your price model is after you get sort of like the main game or the main platform

[57:39] um

[57:40] You've got Canon Lagoon at

[57:43] 1500 basically and that comes with the game if you if you were one of the original people who went in on it

[57:49] Yep

[57:50] Looks like cosmic cart racing your estimate around 2500 okay

[57:54] And then and then as you get to these like many games within the game it's interesting because

[57:59] You know anything from like 150 to 300 to 400 dollars 500 dollars

[58:04] These are sort of like this is code that unlocks new games with which will and I'm assuming the pricing is because

[58:12] There's animations there's coding that has to be done and that that's not free

[58:17] Yeah, well, so yeah compare it to a uh

[58:21] Uh, I don't know pick your favorite platform a mobile phone platform like the iPhone or Android

[58:26] There are free games out there are free apps and we hope to be able to support free apps on the p3

[58:32] But yeah, like you said it takes time and it takes money to develop this stuff

[58:37] And they have to be programmed and content has to be developed

[58:40] But I would never give any pinball people anything for free

[58:44] Well now we find it interesting we talk about this every day how people will spend a hundred dollars three hundred

[58:48] dollars four hundred dollars on a mod for a machine

[58:52] Right, they'll think nothing of it

[58:53] They'll just throw that money at a mod to make the machine look a little bit better to add a trinket to their machine

[58:58] Which is it's cool some people love that

[59:01] Let's talk it let's talk about mod and we've never really talked about modding and and your platform so

[59:06] It's that's an interesting

[59:08] phenomenon where there's a lot of ancillary money to be made with mods

[59:13] um

[59:14] Have you guys ever explored looking at some of your games and I mean where I guess uh look

[59:19] I guess the thing is what like most mods right? It's like a lot of it is like licensed theme is what what drives the mod market

[59:24] So maybe that's a bridge you guys will cross as you explore

[59:28] License themes, but I guess as you look at future revenue

[59:34] Is that something that you guys also want to think about in terms of

[59:38] You know, I even think to it be interesting to think about limited edition modular play feels like we're only gonna make 50 of this special thing

[59:46] You know people seem to be driven a lot by scarcity in this hobby

[59:50] Yeah, that's true um to answer your question

[59:54] You kind of nailed it before walk before we run and so it's a thing we keep saying in this call over and over again

[01:00:00] But yeah, we'd love to explore the ability to design add on

[01:00:04] Whatever's whether it's upgraded displays or you know cool new lighting that you can add to it or

[01:00:10] Or specific toys or or whatnot you never really know what someone's gonna want on a machine related to a you know

[01:00:16] An add-on or an upgrade until you start shipping machines and you can see where the interests are

[01:00:21] So we want to get the machine out we want to get people enjoying the games and then

[01:00:26] We'll talk and I long said I long said we want to hit a model kind of like you know you buy an apple computer a

[01:00:33] Dell computer you pay for the base platform then you can

[01:00:36] Decide what you want it to ship with you can pick your I don't know pick your flipper assembly or pick your button boxes

[01:00:41] Or pick the artwork you want on the side of it and those kind of things we want to eventually get to that point

[01:00:46] But no we have to get the platform out first

[01:00:48] Right it doesn't maze me at the prices people pay for pinball

[01:00:53] The lack of customization available on the machines just bought it boggles my mind. I mean for

[01:01:00] You know when you like I want to get your thoughts to because I know you've you've spent a long time

[01:01:05] innovating and thinking of new ways to innovate pinball

[01:01:11] What does it feel like when you walk by like Batman super early and there's like five dollar toys on and it's like 15 grand or you like and people are like

[01:01:19] You know just like throwing money at it or you like oh like

[01:01:22] Why like it does nobody care like is it like literally or did if you just have money to burn like

[01:01:29] Send it my way, you know like what are your thoughts when you see stuff like that?

[01:01:32] If only you could sit as a fly in the wall in our private Slack channel

[01:01:38] And hear the things that we talk about every day when we see releases like this

[01:01:44] When we see these you know these 15 thousand dollar machines sell out almost instantly

[01:01:49] And we know what it costs to build a traditional type of machine

[01:01:53] Yeah, I don't I'm not gonna repeat the types of things I say but it's so you know like when you're like

[01:02:01] Like to make a traditional machine

[01:02:04] The way stern is there is nowhere near where the price is at now and they just keep pushing that

[01:02:09] Sealing higher and higher and and the more people

[01:02:13] Keep chasing it and throwing money at it

[01:02:17] Um, I you know what I just think like and I don't want to you know

[01:02:20] You know, I want to take it on a road of like having to say stuff about other manufacturers

[01:02:23] But my my assessment is people are losing out in innovation

[01:02:27] They're losing out in quality while the price is increasing and I don't know any other category in this world

[01:02:33] Where that approach succeeds in the long term

[01:02:36] Well, what I will say Chris is that's exactly why we developed the the paradigm we've developed because we don't believe it makes sense to go spend

[01:02:46] Eight or nine thousand dollars or whatever twelve or fifteen thousand dollars on a machine

[01:02:51] Turn around and decide you don't like it or you want to expand your collection and spend that kind of money again

[01:02:56] So we've developed the product that's yeah

[01:02:58] Of course we talk a lot about how great it is for the person who can only fit one machine in their apartment or their house or whatever

[01:03:05] And but it also makes sense for the pinball enthusiasts who has a family and he may have parties once a month or

[01:03:12] Whatever, but normally he's playing one machine at a time

[01:03:16] It just makes sense to have a machine that gives you more value for your money

[01:03:20] So we compare I mean we can get in a bond discussions and volume discussions about all the other manufacturers and whatnot

[01:03:27] But we compare the price per game

[01:03:30] Not the price per machine because that's irrelevant when you start talking about the p3 you pay that money once

[01:03:35] We start talking about the price per game

[01:03:38] So when we start talking about fifteen hundred dollars for Canon Lagoon or twenty five hundred dollars for a cosmic heart racing

[01:03:45] Add on game those are full

[01:03:48] You know just as complex as any traditional machine out there

[01:03:53] Canon lagoon isn't and that's why it's fifteen hundred but cosmic heart racing and Lexi light speed are there just as

[01:03:58] intricate they were designed by

[01:04:01] Lexi was designed by Dennis Norman. It's a complex layout. We're talking about

[01:04:05] twenty five hundred dollars versus a ten thousand or fifteen thousand dollar game

[01:04:09] There's really no comparison. So it's great for us

[01:04:11] It's great for us to see the prices of all these other games going up because it just

[01:04:15] It lends more value to the the whole p3's paradigm right

[01:04:20] Now I totally agree and I get it. I mean I literally I just spent a whole weekend soul searching

[01:04:27] with the prices of these machines

[01:04:29] And it's getting to the point now where if you want to play three games and it's thirty thousand dollars

[01:04:36] It's like what?

[01:04:38] Yeah, you know you just can't justify it. You six games is the price of the hellcat

[01:04:46] Why like what where did we go wrong with like where things rad and I think

[01:04:51] You know, I think people are gonna get sick of it soon. I really do

[01:04:54] I don't think it can it can stay afloat at this rate too much longer, but you know every time I say that

[01:05:02] You just like you throw out star wars you throw out some of these these themes that people just are so emotionally connected to that

[01:05:10] It's like money's not even an object. No, yeah, we get that but so so

[01:05:15] The thing about the p3 is that people can

[01:05:19] Decide whether or not they want to keep supporting these super expensive games if they do

[01:05:24] continue to pay a lot of money for cool content

[01:05:27] It still makes sense to have a p3

[01:05:30] Because of the value because of the variety, but also because in the next year or two

[01:05:35] They'll be getting just this cool themes and interesting shot layouts and all this things on the p3 as they work the other machines

[01:05:41] But on the flip side if that market drops out if that bubble burst and people stop paying that kind of money for new machines

[01:05:47] And the p3 is the only machine that makes sense. All right, so we've got platform that we think can survive that kind of bubble burst

[01:05:54] I got an idea for you guys

[01:05:56] I got an idea for a license

[01:06:00] Theme that we're gonna put up it again. No, it won't cost a lot

[01:06:06] But every single pinball person is aware of the theme in fact this theme has been building hype now for years

[01:06:13] You don't even you don't have to drum up the excitement

[01:06:16] You guys should make is this when you say Tetris again? No

[01:06:20] You should make and I'm not crazy here. You should get the IP

[01:06:25] Faraza and make it on your platform or even make a magic girl that works on your platform and I

[01:06:33] Do you know the story about

[01:06:35] Magic girl and Raza jump up a Duke with our platform? I know that he like stole

[01:06:40] Basically stole p-rock. Did he like steal it and then make boards that just copied it and then didn't want to pay for it

[01:06:47] Like am I making that up? I don't know I just what I heard or something like that

[01:06:50] Yeah, there's there's an interesting story down there somewhere, but tell it come on. I mean, it's all it's that that

[01:06:57] That train has gone off the

[01:06:59] Tracks it crashed into the ocean and everyone got eaten by sharks like just tell us

[01:07:05] What did he because he

[01:07:07] What don't we know about how much he messed the whole thing up? I don't know what you don't know so I don't know what to tell you

[01:07:13] But what I will tell you is

[01:07:15] So I think everybody knows that jump up to get started he announced that all of his games were coming out on the p-rock right he announced that in trade shows and then

[01:07:24] John's more of an old-school designer. So he designed games the way he always designed games

[01:07:30] Which was he wanted a you know a big driver board in the back box

[01:07:33] He wanted traditional wiring and all that so it was a bit of a struggle to get him to

[01:07:38] To accept our modular board systems and whatnot

[01:07:41] He asked me at one point to design

[01:07:43] Uh

[01:07:44] Driver board that more represented the old way of doing things with a new way

[01:07:49] And I think he got frustrated with my trying to push him to the new way and not wanting to design those new boards or charging him actual real engineering time to do it

[01:07:56] So he made the choice to to go away. He made his his business decision was to go find someone who would

[01:08:04] Do things the way he wanted to do things and I don't fall them for the at but of course

[01:08:09] Yeah, we all know that he he basically paid somebody to clone the p-rock in his entire

[01:08:16] Operating system or his entire control system is based on

[01:08:20] What we developed which is a bit a bit annoying

[01:08:23] Yeah, yeah, I mean

[01:08:25] It's like like like all that karma all I mean everything he did the way he worked with vendors and people and

[01:08:33] It like when I look at the magic girl now. I'm like for what like for what end was all of that was he had all these talented people working in silos

[01:08:44] He was doing all these like and he just didn't know how to like put it together like I just I I can't like I

[01:08:51] I was so like hoping when I saw the pictures from American pinball and that's when I went in on it

[01:08:58] They showed me the pictures of the empty cabinets and like a fool

[01:09:02] I marched in and said you know what I feel like he must have spent the last year fixing everything and getting it ready

[01:09:09] Hey, but empty cabinets are exciting. We just announced our own pick we really stole picture of empty cabinets

[01:09:14] Yeah, no, I'm gonna I'm gonna um

[01:09:17] I'm probably gonna be bird inside my empty magic girl cabinet one day and but it you know when I got the game

[01:09:22] I mean it was like none of the mechs work nothing's hooked up like switches are wired all wrong

[01:09:28] So the whole thing is just what I'm saying is though there is an IP there and I'm not even joking when I say this

[01:09:33] I think you guys

[01:09:35] Could make a more futuristic version of those games

[01:09:40] Uh, and it would be super cool. I'm just saying. I'm just saying like so here. Here's one thing. I can tell you with a hundred percent certainty

[01:09:48] We are not interested in lilies in touching a John pop a Duke intellectual property. Yeah, nobody is

[01:09:56] Well, he doesn't own me, but he doesn't own the IP anymore

[01:09:59] So I wouldn't even be um, you know, you don't have to deal with him

[01:10:02] That's the that's see that's the part people don't get he doesn't own the IP anymore on these things

[01:10:09] So all that beautiful artwork all the beautiful assets everything he doesn't own

[01:10:15] Um, and there's so much value in it. So just just consider it um, but so so one thing let me let me actually touch on that a little bit because one of the things that

[01:10:23] um

[01:10:25] Common in the engineering world or the technology industry is it's not super common

[01:10:32] But it's it's not unheard of for companies that failed to execute

[01:10:36] To open up their platform so that people who bought in and got a you know, a half-pink finished product or who didn't actually get

[01:10:43] What they wanted can go in and make the change or they can rely on the open source community to

[01:10:48] Complete a project form

[01:10:51] That's really what should probably be happening with that IP and that's one of the reasons

[01:10:56] That we like the open platform model to begin with if if somebody develops a playfield for the p3

[01:11:02] Then anybody can write software for it

[01:11:04] Right, so it's just it just makes sense to

[01:11:07] It's it's not it's interesting to have IP and allow people to run with it

[01:11:13] You know, I you know what helps me sleep in the ijr is from now on I'm going to start

[01:11:17] Considering zidware and magic girl to simply be a platform

[01:11:21] It now just needs people to actually design a game that actually works on top of that platform

[01:11:26] Well, well, uh, it's running the pie prop game

[01:11:31] What do I call pinball framework that Adam and I developed way back in the day so

[01:11:35] We know people are familiar with that platform and can develop games on

[01:11:40] I should mail you mine and see if you guys can make it work somehow

[01:11:43] I mean, I just feel great because I don't really have anything else I need to be doing right now

[01:11:47] I know Chris keep saying ship your game super game, but oh by the way, I have this thing I need help with no seriously like you can be like a finished magic girl

[01:11:56] Um, well, Jerry this is super exciting and you're gonna be at tp app for those attending the show

[01:12:01] You're gonna be when is your seminar what day? We're at 12 o'clock noon on Saturday and as we all know that

[01:12:09] Lunchtime to lunchtime means food and we will be feeding people again this year

[01:12:14] Can people have more than two slices?

[01:12:16] Two and we've never restricted it

[01:12:18] Last time wait last time we bought 60 pizzas and I think I had to eat 10 of them by myself in the booth right after the seminar

[01:12:25] Oh my god, he had a lot of extras no, uh, so we're going to I think we've talked about it before at least I put it in the announcement

[01:12:32] We're showing off three new games at the show um that's that third party baseball game

[01:12:37] I talked about it's that training game you mentioned briefly where we're gonna teach people how to play them

[01:12:42] To play pinball. We're gonna teach some skills. We're gonna teach some passing and aiming and catching and all those kind of things

[01:12:49] And then we have an interesting new

[01:12:52] An interesting third game which is I think it's the first time it's ever been done in the industry which is having a

[01:12:59] head-to-head

[01:13:01] Game kind of in the style of NBA fast break, but what's new is that it's

[01:13:06] Internet connected

[01:13:08] So we're having two machines there that can talk to each other over a network and you can literally play against someone on another machine

[01:13:16] Wow, I you know I've been waiting for that to come to the pinball world. I don't know why it's taken so long and

[01:13:23] If you guys

[01:13:25] Can implement that you'll be the first ones where it's like

[01:13:28] Basically online gaming coming to pinball which well I'll tell you why it hasn't happened before because it makes no sense to stare at this

[01:13:35] Physical play field with no cool interesting display showing you what's going on the other person's machine right

[01:13:42] Nice true

[01:13:43] I'll give you two physical play fields with no interesting video screen is pointless and we've even found I mean there are instances when you

[01:13:50] So we tried three or four different concepts for this head-to-head game and the first couple were just

[01:13:56] boring and not fun because you have to find this this magical combination of

[01:14:01] Of local gameplay and remote gameplay that that worked together and it's a challenge

[01:14:06] But we've come up with this concept that's super fun to play every single person who's tried it out on this machine walks away smiling and happy and loving it

[01:14:14] You know what you guys need to make try it. I don't know if you can deal it

[01:14:17] But it would your platform it would work for because of the screen

[01:14:21] You ever play bus to move or like puzzle bobble or like you have to line up the three

[01:14:27] Color balls and around that and that that would be so rad on your platform

[01:14:32] So we've talked a lot about puzzle games and figuring out how to

[01:14:36] Use that physical pinball and the physical input mechanism that the flippers give you and and make it interesting puzzle game

[01:14:42] We have a couple ideas. We've also tossed out a ton of ideas because it's it's a challenge to take an idea and

[01:14:51] Make it fun on a pinball platform without forcing something right

[01:14:55] No, totally, but it's gotta be fun too because like you have more possibilities like your platform is not just

[01:15:01] Static and don't want to done right it's yep

[01:15:05] You can mold it and your imagination is like the only limitation. I'm like really what you can do

[01:15:10] I mean it's yep, it's exciting. Jerry and I'm happy for you guys when I got the emails. I was like

[01:15:16] I was really

[01:15:17] Lated and I love that you included all these pictures too

[01:15:21] Aparts. I mean nothing gets pinball guys to salve eight more than like

[01:15:27] Not just words, but when you see the physical components

[01:15:31] That's when it starts to get real and and we're happy to see you guys moving towards this great milestone

[01:15:38] I'll be at tpf. I look forward to to seeing the game and and to chatting with you guys and and we'll definitely be attending the seminar

[01:15:46] Jerry for for anyone who listens to this podcast to who might

[01:15:50] Have heard about this platform for the first time because I'm usually just bitching about stern and highway and everyone else

[01:15:56] On most of my podcast

[01:15:58] Which you're not bitching about us either you

[01:16:01] No, no, you know, the things I've said about you guys in the past is just like

[01:16:05] It's just timing and I always feel like

[01:16:08] The climate of

[01:16:10] When you guys are coming out with whether it's people getting ripped off or too many machines are colliding at once

[01:16:18] Um, you know, I think it's always hard to gauge

[01:16:22] When you guys launch if if it's like the perfect time or if you're catching the hobby when it's going through like a shit period

[01:16:30] Right, so it's like and you never know like it's just

[01:16:34] It's like it's like it's like buying a computer you can keep waiting and waiting and waiting for the perfect time when just the right

[01:16:40] New technology comes out or you can just buy it when you need it

[01:16:43] So I mean, we're not we're not really thinking about that. We're just developing a machine and when it's ready

[01:16:48] Which is now we're gonna build it and sell it and go from there

[01:16:51] Well, what I know is what I know to be true

[01:16:54] It no matter what's going on in the pinball world

[01:16:56] If you physically have something to sell someone unless it's full throttle they'll buy it

[01:17:03] I mean, I just that's what I know I mean it's

[01:17:06] And it's and yours is different too. I mean, that's the thing is like he's not just and these people like variety they they really do and

[01:17:15] and so

[01:17:17] Where should people go jerry if they want to check out what p3 and multi morph gives all about like what's the best place to get an introduction

[01:17:26] Video or or information on on on on the brand. Yeah, thanks for asking. We have a website of course multi morphic.com

[01:17:36] Has an intro page and a couple of our videos. We're actually working on a new site that we're gonna release or or go live in a couple weeks with

[01:17:44] That's gonna have a new layout and it's gonna talk more about our

[01:17:47] Machine and our games and all those things

[01:17:49] So you can get a little tidbit now or a little introduction now and you can see our old videos and in a couple weeks when we get to tpf

[01:17:56] We're gonna go live with our new system and give a lot more information

[01:18:00] Cool

[01:18:01] Well, Jerry I want to thank you for coming on. This has been great

[01:18:05] I look forward to playing the game in a few weeks

[01:18:08] And and I look forward to two things to come for you guys

[01:18:11] I think you've done it right and I always applaud the companies out there that don't make

[01:18:17] Consumers go through years of pain because all it does is it takes to fun out

[01:18:24] You only need to get burned ones to never want to go back and I think pain is fun. Is that what you say?

[01:18:29] Yeah, it sucks like this these are toys meant to entertain

[01:18:33] There are men to be escapes from the other hardships in life and

[01:18:38] And you know again when a game becomes like your own worst enemy because it's just it's just messing with your mind

[01:18:45] You can't sleep you've invested money in the company and your wife is like what the fuck are we doing here?

[01:18:51] You got 30 grand on the line with zidware you and it's like it's not good. I have a solution for all those people

[01:18:59] Stop spending money and all those other machines and just pay someone you trust

[01:19:03] Exactly no, it's true and I think I think people

[01:19:07] over the last year have wisedub and I mean I hope I hope that's true

[01:19:15] Um, but I think they have I think people have have sort of hit the brakes. They want to see games going out

[01:19:22] You know, we want to see

[01:19:24] P3 go out. I want to see highway get games out, you know a couple beta games is not a victory parade that

[01:19:31] Productions begun like people

[01:19:33] People know that like stuff's not real to you

[01:19:37] You've got like multiple games going out, but you guys are right. You're setting expectations

[01:19:42] You're and you're not saying we're gonna have 250 games out in April and then April comes and you're like

[01:19:48] Two weeks like we'll get you know five out and then it's

[01:19:52] Expectations are everything when it comes to building um confidence and credibility with customers

[01:19:58] I think well, you know, they're pros and cons in running a business as an engineer versus a salesperson

[01:20:05] Uh, and my my failure is I sometimes dig down too much into the technical aspects and not

[01:20:12] Sell the the positives and the content and all that exciting stuff

[01:20:16] I'm more excited personally about the technology and the cool features that we've developed but uh

[01:20:21] Um, one thing that comes out of being an engineer is

[01:20:24] We like to tell the truth right

[01:20:27] So I think it's great and you know, you've got a you got a friend of me and I go

[01:20:30] Help you guys out with marketing, but you know the marketer and me is gonna

[01:20:33] I'm gonna push you guys I i'm gonna push you to that license game

[01:20:37] Which is gonna be the the gangbusters one i did and but look we're gonna get the platform out first

[01:20:43] Get a user based up and you march into a studio and be like look at this would you want your property on this

[01:20:49] Static piece of wood or do you want your property on this thing?

[01:20:54] That's

[01:20:56] Full animation screen like it's it's it's no brainer like you can use the competition

[01:21:03] To ink your deals more than you even need your own technology. I like it. I like it. All right. Let's do it

[01:21:08] It's take it over let's take over everything all right
