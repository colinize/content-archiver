[00:00] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome, I'm just an ordinary daily guy.

[00:06] C'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya, c'ya.

[00:10] Uh, welcome everybody to a little short edition of Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:15] We're one day away from Stern Pinball's Dungeons and Dragons.

[00:20] For each and every one of you, come hang out tomorrow, starting at noon Eastern Standard Time.

[00:27] I will be live on my YouTube channel, and we can watch together.

[00:32] The moment Stern drops the reveal of the game.

[00:36] Supposedly, it's supposed to come out at one o'clock Eastern Standard Time,

[00:40] but you know how it goes.

[00:41] Stuff leaks early, so let's just get together.

[00:44] Maybe we'll have a little, like, Friday-boozzy lunch kind of moment,

[00:49] and give our first impressions of D&D.

[00:52] I'm super excited.

[00:53] It's always a lot of fun when we see a new game together for the first time.

[00:57] All right, so I'm gonna give you an exclusive bit of information.

[01:01] I haven't heard anywhere else.

[01:04] I got confirmation on this from someone in the industry who knows exactly what is going on.

[01:12] So I haven't seen photos of this, but I'm here to confirm for you on Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[01:20] Another pinball machine that is gonna come out in 2025.

[01:25] You know, and this has been a theme that people have wanted a remake of in a really long time,

[01:30] and I have a little bit of, like, mixed emotions about this,

[01:34] because with so much happening in pinball, I do think there's a lot of companies

[01:39] that are bringing new games to market, themes we've never had before,

[01:44] a lot of big IPs on the horizon,

[01:47] and then there are some companies that are looking backwards at older games that were very popular,

[01:53] that are hard to find in great condition.

[01:57] And so I'm here to confirm for all of you right now what the remake game is gonna be from Pedretti Gaming.

[02:05] The game they are gonna bring back to market,

[02:08] and you're gonna be able to get a brand new one,

[02:11] and we'll see how the build quality is.

[02:13] We'll see what they do with the art package.

[02:15] The original is kind of iconic.

[02:18] We know they're probably gonna work with Brian Allen,

[02:20] because he's already done a translate on this game.

[02:24] And so the game coming back is no other than Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[02:31] That will be the next remake game by Pedretti Gaming.

[02:36] And if we think about the remakes coming out in 2025, people,

[02:41] now we've got Toten, we're also gonna get more medieval madness games.

[02:46] Nobody's talking about this.

[02:48] CGC is about to make more medieval madness games right on top of

[02:54] Stern Pinball making Dungeons and Dragons.

[02:56] Now if I were CGC, I would have reminded people,

[03:00] hey, we might still have the better Brian Eddy game that features dragons and castles and all that medieval lore.

[03:08] So it's interesting to me, and this is gonna be the final run of medieval madness.

[03:14] You know what I would do if I were CGC?

[03:16] We're gonna make 739 final editions of medieval madness.

[03:22] Make one less than Stern is making of Dungeons and Dragons.

[03:26] So that is gonna happen.

[03:28] We're also gonna get the return of Twilight Zone by CGC.

[03:33] And then I think it's like Halo from Play Mechanics.

[03:36] I bet your head is spinning a little bit.

[03:39] My head is spinning a little bit as I think about this hobby and where it's going right now.

[03:46] It's hard not to feel like Pinball is reaching a point now where there's just so much happening.

[03:53] But man, we're still waiting for the masterpieces.

[03:57] We're still waiting for it to be done right.

[03:59] And here's the problem I see in all of Pinball.

[04:01] There's so many games out there.

[04:03] And Pinball is always gonna be the same game for the most part.

[04:08] There's no real innovation.

[04:10] So you've got all of these amazing games.

[04:13] And there are so many amazing games in Pinball.

[04:16] And they're out there.

[04:17] Hundreds of thousands of games are out there.

[04:20] We're adding new games into the mix every single year.

[04:24] And look, a new great game does not make an old great game no longer great.

[04:30] So Dungeons and Dragons, no matter how good that game is,

[04:34] it's not gonna take away anything from how much of a masterpiece medieval madness is or Lord of the Rings is.

[04:42] If you think about the theme of D&D, there are other games in that thematic category that are amazing.

[04:49] And if you really want like castles and dragons, this adventure through some like fantasy land,

[04:55] there are some amazing Pinball machines that do that.

[04:58] And I'm just worried about all of it.

[05:00] I know, I know, I know, I'm excited and I'm worried.

[05:03] I'm excited to see what's around the corner, but I'm just worried that it's just oversaturated.

[05:09] And when I see things like remaking old games again,

[05:13] part of me is like, nah, man, nah, just let those games have their moment in Pinball.

[05:19] Let people go on missions to find a restored version of Toad in

[05:24] or medieval madness, royal additions, like it should have been the end.

[05:28] Medieval madness, royal additions should have been the final run of the game.

[05:33] Even seeing the way Stern is doing it, right?

[05:35] They're gonna remake everything.

[05:38] The rumor now is Ghostbusters is coming back.

[05:41] But how are you gonna handle this?

[05:42] How are you gonna handle making a better version of Ghostbusters

[05:46] than all those thousands of people who have the original one are now gonna have what?

[05:52] A game worth a lot less, a game that doesn't play as well as the new one.

[05:57] And you're gonna just burn them the way you burn the Metallica owners.

[06:01] And I'm worried about it because I just think there's so much pressure now

[06:06] for all of these companies to keep their lines going that they're not gonna do moves

[06:12] and they're not gonna make decisions that take into consideration

[06:16] how the customer is going to feel.

[06:19] And I think it's gonna be brutal.

[06:21] And obviously, Stern has like 80% of the Pinball market.

[06:25] So every move they make is gonna be very interesting.

[06:29] If Ghostbusters comes back, it's gonna be interesting to see what happens.

[06:32] Even just Jason Knapp just writing a story about that,

[06:36] we're seeing all these Ghostbusters go up for sale.

[06:39] And now the same thing's gonna happen with Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[06:42] Even if you have an original, now that you know more are coming,

[06:46] now is the most you're ever gonna get for it.

[06:49] I think Toten in good condition.

[06:51] When I got mine, it was like a $7,000 pin.

[06:55] Now when people list a Toten in good condition,

[06:58] you're looking at $12,000, $13,000, which in my honest opinion, is way too much.

[07:05] It's a fun game.

[07:06] There's a lot of awesome mechanical stuff in that game.

[07:09] Trust me, Toten mechanically embarrasses about 95% of modern pins.

[07:15] The code is just really shallow.

[07:18] You can beat the game almost every time you play it if you're a decent player.

[07:23] And it gets old pretty quickly.

[07:26] But it's still one of the greatest worlds under glass.

[07:30] It's still got one of the coolest mechs in all of Pinball

[07:33] in the shooting star Outlane save, the disappearing magnet,

[07:37] the way the genie throws the fireballs at you.

[07:40] It's just so well done.

[07:42] Like I look at a game like X-Men and it's trying to do unique stuff mechanically and with the layout.

[07:48] But like Toten actually executed so well.

[07:52] The ramp in Toten, I think there's only one ramp,

[07:55] but it diverts the ball three different ways.

[07:57] Go look at the ramp in Toten.

[08:00] That is one of the most amazingly thought out and engineered ramps of all time.

[08:06] So who knows, maybe they can put better code in it,

[08:08] but we've seen the Padready gaming and we've seen the sort of code they've done with Funhaus.

[08:14] And guess who worked on the new code for freaking Toten?

[08:17] That little weasel known as Mirko.

[08:19] He's the one who's behind like the upgrade kit for Tales of the Arabian Knights.

[08:24] So I hope it's not that.

[08:26] If they really want to make these remakes sort of the next level of these pins,

[08:31] they need to hire real good coders to take these games to a modern replay place.

[08:38] And until they do that, I still think I'd rather just own the original.

[08:43] You get an original one with Balli Williams parts and a CPR play field

[08:48] and you don't need anything else.

[08:50] I had one.

[08:51] It's gorgeous.

[08:53] And in a large lineup of modern games,

[08:56] it's fun to have some of those classics sitting there knowing that they were made,

[09:00] right in the 90s.

[09:01] They were made by the folks at Balli Williams.

[09:04] I think we have to start placing value on having an original,

[09:08] you know, in the toy collecting world.

[09:10] Yeah, you can make a brand new version of Optimus Prime,

[09:13] but if you've got the one from 1986, that's the one that has the value.

[09:18] Oh, so everybody, there's the exclusive.

[09:20] Go to Pinside.

[09:21] Don't give Canadian credit.

[09:23] And I'll see you guys tomorrow at noon Eastern Standard Time.

[09:28] As we wait to see what is in Stern Pinballs D&D.

[09:31] Will the dragon fire pinballs out of its mouth?

[09:35] It looks like there's no lower teeth.

[09:37] I think something's going to come out of that mouth.

[09:39] But I'll tell you this, if you spend $13,000 on this game on day one,

[09:46] you're putting something into that dragon's mouth people,

[09:49] and it ain't a pinball.

[09:50] We'll talk to you soon.

[09:51] Canada out.
