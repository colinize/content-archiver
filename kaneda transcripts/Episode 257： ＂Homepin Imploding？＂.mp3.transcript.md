[00:00] See that girl, watch that scene, give it a passing feel.

[00:09] What's...

[00:10] Oh...

[00:13] Oh...

[00:14] Oh...

[00:15] Oh...

[00:16] Welcome to episode 257 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:21] Happy Monday, everybody.

[00:22] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:24] And what in August?

[00:25] It's shaping up to be in the pinball world.

[00:28] A lot is going on this summer as we head into the fall,

[00:31] which I don't think anybody really expected

[00:34] that we would have a new stern game out with Deadpool.

[00:36] We'd have Pirates of the Caribbean.

[00:39] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle is on the line.

[00:43] Monster Bazzard remake is gonna be revealed any day now.

[00:46] You know, all of it happening at the end of the summer.

[00:48] And most of these games, they were supposed to come out

[00:51] far, far earlier on in the year.

[00:54] So it's interesting that this is like the summer blitz of pinball.

[00:58] So what we're gonna do on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast,

[01:01] we're gonna go down the list of manufacturers.

[01:03] And we're gonna talk about what is going on in their world.

[01:06] We're gonna share my opinion about those manufacturers.

[01:11] And here's the thing, all of you out there who listen to this show.

[01:14] If you wanna tell me how you feel,

[01:16] just email me at canadapinballadgmail.com

[01:20] because I haven't really received many emails lately.

[01:22] And I know you guys are listening.

[01:24] I still see the listening numbers be up around 1500.

[01:28] So don't be shy.

[01:30] Don't be shy because I would love to read on the air.

[01:33] Your feelings in the pinball world.

[01:35] So where should we start here?

[01:36] I've got a bunch of notes I wanna pull them up.

[01:39] Hold on everybody.

[01:41] Let's see what we got here.

[01:42] So, okay.

[01:43] So I'm going to get to probably the most dramatic thing

[01:47] that's been happening in the pinball world on pin side.

[01:49] And that is home pin.

[01:51] But I'm gonna cover them at the end of this podcast

[01:53] because I think it deserves sort of to be the close out

[01:58] of this show.

[01:58] I wanna talk about my last podcast quickly.

[02:02] The warranty wineau.

[02:04] And the individual who bought a Houdini

[02:07] and then complain that they weren't gonna give them a free part.

[02:10] And this has had a happy resolution

[02:13] because the good guy in the industry, Joe Newhart

[02:16] over at pinballstar has decided to give this guy

[02:20] the part that he needs to get his Houdini up and running.

[02:23] Now, here's my thoughts on this whole thing.

[02:26] As first of all, I did think it was absolutely ridiculous

[02:28] that this guy starts a thread that throws American pinball

[02:32] under the bus when he's the second hand buyer of the machine

[02:36] because most pinball warranties are not transferable

[02:41] if you are the second owner of the game itself.

[02:44] So I think it's, you know, it was a good PR move for Joe

[02:47] for sure.

[02:48] I think Joe is probably one of the nicest guys

[02:51] in the entire pinball hobby.

[02:53] And when you're a distributor,

[02:54] if there's one vibe you wanna give out to the world,

[02:57] it's that you're gonna stand behind your customers.

[02:59] And so I think it's great that Joe did this.

[03:02] Now, the other thing is I don't think this guy learns a lesson

[03:06] because now what happens when the next guy who's out of warranty

[03:11] wants a part, does he go and complain

[03:14] and does he get a part for free,

[03:16] even though he doesn't deserve it.

[03:17] Now, 90 days is not a long period of time

[03:21] to have a pinball machine covered under warranty.

[03:23] I think other manufacturers cover the parts for up to a year,

[03:27] but it is what it is.

[03:28] And I think the lesson from this entire thing is,

[03:32] is just make sure you read the warranties on the products

[03:35] that you buy.

[03:37] And I think it's a habit that we all have,

[03:39] is that we usually sign our name on the line

[03:42] without going over the contract about what we just sign.

[03:45] And I know it's not always fun.

[03:48] Like we wanna get our toy,

[03:49] we just wanted to be in our home,

[03:52] but we should be better informed and better educated

[03:56] on what exactly we're getting when we buy a game.

[03:59] All right, all right, isn't it nice?

[04:01] I've also noticed on the forum,

[04:03] it's really nice that the drama that surrounded

[04:07] highway pinball's alien game

[04:09] and the Dutch pinball's the big Lebowski.

[04:11] Like those threads are starting to be pushed down

[04:16] to the basement area of the pinside threads.

[04:19] We're like, it's nice that that drama is sort of evaporating.

[04:23] For those of you who lost money on those ventures,

[04:26] time will heal all wounds.

[04:28] It just will.

[04:29] Like you'll learn a lesson and you'll move on.

[04:32] And that's just the way it goes.

[04:34] So what else do I wanna talk about?

[04:36] When it comes to drama though,

[04:38] we saw that John Papaduke will be,

[04:42] he will be at pinball expo this year.

[04:45] And let's talk about that for a minute

[04:47] because I think a lot of people are saying to themselves,

[04:50] what do you do in Deeproot?

[04:51] Why are you bringing John Papaduke to expo?

[04:54] And I think Deeproot is,

[04:55] their goal is to rock up with their team.

[04:59] And John Papaduke is a major member of their design team.

[05:03] So what are my thoughts on this,

[05:04] on bringing John to the show?

[05:06] Now look,

[05:08] we all saw what happened when American pinball showed up.

[05:11] And even when they just talked about J-Pop,

[05:14] like the mood in the room just gets really somber,

[05:18] really quickly.

[05:20] He doesn't bring out the best in people.

[05:23] And there are still a lot of people

[05:26] who are out a lot of money because of John.

[05:30] And there's still a lawsuit going on around John as well.

[05:34] So is it a good PR move for Deeproot to show

[05:37] John the answer is no.

[05:39] I mean, it's not.

[05:39] I would never say that he brings anything

[05:43] but negative vibes into the room.

[05:45] But I'd also say that at some point,

[05:48] Robert needs to just rip the bandaid off

[05:50] with John out of show.

[05:51] And he's going to need John there.

[05:53] If they're making John's games and they're correcting them

[05:56] and they're going to bring them to market,

[05:58] ultimately John will be a public facing figure

[06:02] of Deeproot pinball.

[06:03] Now, I probably wouldn't have John be anywhere near

[06:07] a Deeproot seminar until one thing happens

[06:11] until they actually get a working J-Pop title

[06:15] that they're ready to show the world.

[06:17] I don't think I would have John be anywhere near

[06:21] my seminar or my company until that moment happens

[06:25] because the only thing that will ever make people feel better

[06:30] about John Papaduke is that he finally figured it out.

[06:34] That he finally got a game to work

[06:36] and that people can actually buy a J-Pop game

[06:38] that is functioning and that works properly.

[06:42] And if I could give any advice to John and to Robert,

[06:46] what I would do, when John does make his appearance

[06:49] for the first time and publicly address his people

[06:51] because remember, he never really has.

[06:53] He never really has publicly addressed a crowd

[06:56] in the pinball world is I would say,

[06:59] very sorry, this was all my fault.

[07:03] What happened at Zidia was 100% my fault,

[07:06] I'm not a victim.

[07:08] And I quickly realized after, like, not quickly,

[07:12] but after a few years, I realized I couldn't do this

[07:15] that my ego in designing pinball machines

[07:17] led me to believe that I could tackle more of what I could.

[07:22] And that I was actually surrounded by an army of people

[07:25] at Bally Williams that helped see my creations

[07:29] come to fruition.

[07:30] And after all of the years of trying to do it on my own

[07:33] and with other people helping me,

[07:35] I'm finally at the right kind of company

[07:38] that I need to be successful in pinball.

[07:41] And I super, super duper apologize

[07:46] for ever thinking I could do it on my own.

[07:49] And I'm so sorry for all those who invested in my companies

[07:52] that didn't see a product.

[07:54] Now I'm happy today to say that my vision is now a reality

[07:58] because of the help I now have at Deeproot Pinball.

[08:02] And we're gonna work to make sure that everyone who went in

[08:04] on Zidia where games is able to get these games

[08:09] with some sort of advantage or benefit

[08:11] because of the money you've already invested in me.

[08:13] And I will not stop until you are all made whole

[08:16] in this industry.

[08:17] So something along those lines, right?

[08:20] Again, it's neat.

[08:21] You're never gonna be able to just pull the curtain off

[08:23] of John Game and think all will be forgotten.

[08:25] Now, the other part about this that's always hilarious

[08:28] is how people on pinside say how, you know,

[08:32] there's gonna be this angry mob

[08:34] and the room's gonna go crazy

[08:35] and people are gonna be shouting out expletives

[08:37] and people are gonna physically hurt John if they see him

[08:40] because he took $18,000 from them.

[08:43] We all know that that's a bunch of BS.

[08:45] I've never seen a community that's more keyboard

[08:48] commando than the pinball community.

[08:50] People talk all this smack on pinside and then in real life

[08:55] when they're face to face with the people,

[08:57] they bow down or they're much more mature

[09:01] about the whole thing.

[09:03] And I think that's good.

[09:04] I don't think anyone should ever threaten John

[09:07] with physical harm.

[09:08] I don't think we should get to a place

[09:10] where we're like laying hands on him

[09:12] because he took your money.

[09:14] I used to bad businessman, right?

[09:16] I don't think he did this to pick a fight with people.

[09:19] So I think we won't see that happen at Expo.

[09:23] But again, if I were Robert,

[09:24] I would hold John back until TPS

[09:26] until you actually have like a working version

[09:28] of John's games to show.

[09:31] Again, I just don't see the advantage.

[09:33] All right, let's move on to what else is going on

[09:35] in the pinball world.

[09:37] Stern pinball.

[09:38] So we saw the Deadpool stream

[09:41] and I think a lot of people are absorbing it.

[09:44] I think a lot of people are happy

[09:46] that this was probably Stern's best stream to date.

[09:48] Thank you to Jack Danger,

[09:50] to Tim over there, to the marketing team to Gomez,

[09:53] to Zambiyeti, everyone who is there,

[09:54] to the designer, the coder,

[09:56] everyone has chimed in and is giving people,

[10:00] I think one of the greatest early looks

[10:02] at a pinball machine that makes people,

[10:05] you know, figure out whether or not they want to buy it,

[10:06] which I think is great.

[10:08] That's what streams do for us.

[10:09] They let us behind the curtain and to see

[10:11] if this is something that we might like.

[10:13] Now you still have to play a pinball machine.

[10:15] At the end of the day,

[10:16] I still think pinball streams are kind of stupid.

[10:18] I'll tell you why,

[10:19] because you don't know if you're really gonna like it.

[10:21] And you really have to test drive it in person.

[10:23] I think buying games without having played it

[10:26] is kind of idiotic.

[10:28] I really do.

[10:29] They're too expensive.

[10:30] They're just too expensive to go in on

[10:34] without test driving it, right?

[10:36] And that's just my belief about pinball.

[10:39] I do still stand behind what I said

[10:41] that I just think Deadpool is missing the wow.

[10:45] And I'm gonna talk a little bit later

[10:47] on this podcast about something that happened to me

[10:49] in the pinball world this weekend,

[10:51] where I played a game at a bar.

[10:53] And it kind of reinforced what I was saying.

[10:55] Is that the game to me just doesn't have

[10:57] that one magical element that when you see it happen,

[11:02] is gonna blow you away.

[11:03] I think it's got great art.

[11:04] I think it's got interesting code.

[11:06] I think the LCD is really neat.

[11:08] I don't know.

[11:08] Will the shiny disco ball will that be the wow

[11:11] that people are looking for in the game?

[11:14] But I think mechanically, when I look at Deadpool,

[11:17] I'm just not seeing a lot going on there.

[11:19] Like there's not even a lot mechanically different

[11:21] from the pro versus the premium.

[11:24] And then a lot of money.

[11:25] And then you forget it.

[11:27] Like the pro versus the LE.

[11:29] Like the fact that the LE is almost, you know,

[11:33] it's like almost not, it's sorry,

[11:34] it's almost $4,000 more.

[11:38] And I don't see how you can start to justify

[11:42] going in on the limited edition versions of this game

[11:45] when there's nothing mechanically different at all

[11:48] in the game or hardly at all, right?

[11:50] Drop targets, a diverter and a disco ball

[11:53] do not equal like $3,500 in cost.

[11:58] All right, let's see what else is going on in the Stern world.

[12:02] There's a WWE LE for sale.

[12:06] Get ready for this.

[12:07] It a limited edition WWE,

[12:09] which I don't think they were like,

[12:11] were they like $8,000 back then?

[12:13] It's selling for $4,400.

[12:15] So if you've always wanted a WWE LE,

[12:17] you can go get one for real cheap.

[12:20] One more thing in the Stern world.

[12:22] I had a little problem with my Batman.

[12:24] And I'm not sure if you guys have had this issue before.

[12:26] And my Batman kept resetting this weekend.

[12:30] It was kind of scaring me.

[12:31] It was freaking me out a little bit.

[12:33] Whenever the computer fan would go on,

[12:35] the game itself would sort of freeze mid-game.

[12:38] And then it would restart.

[12:40] And it kept happening.

[12:41] And I was like, what's going on here?

[12:43] And then I did a little digging on Pinside.

[12:46] And I read some people talk about the spike system

[12:49] and how it's very sensitive to voltage.

[12:52] Now I think my issue was,

[12:54] and I don't know because I haven't played many, many games

[12:56] after this troubleshoot.

[12:58] I think because I had all my air conditioning's going

[13:00] in my apartment,

[13:02] that that might have caused the voltage

[13:03] in the apartment to go down a little bit,

[13:06] which then might have interacted

[13:08] with the spike system causing it to crash.

[13:10] I don't know, I'm not sure.

[13:12] So I'm going to play the game some more.

[13:13] I haven't had issues with this game in an entire year.

[13:16] So I think that might be the case.

[13:19] But if you've had any issues with spike and voltage,

[13:22] I would love to hear from you at canadapimbal.com.

[13:25] All right, let's go on to John, not at JJP.

[13:30] Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[13:32] So Jack has done his cartwheel.

[13:35] The truck has arrived to pick up pirates of the Caribbean.

[13:39] Now I did find it funny that Jack can't even successfully

[13:44] do a cartwheel.

[13:45] I feel like he's going to injure himself.

[13:48] It's funny to me because those three seconds

[13:50] in which Jack is trying to cartwheel,

[13:52] it kind of is like the physical representation

[13:55] of how well I think this company has launched this game.

[13:58] Like it just completely fumbled

[14:01] what their intentions were to get this game out

[14:04] in Q1 of 2018.

[14:07] I mean, here we are almost at the end of August.

[14:09] And the first games are finally being picked up.

[14:12] Now, that being said, with all that being said,

[14:17] I want to say something that I did I do believe

[14:19] and I do feel this way.

[14:21] It's exciting whenever a Jersey Jack game goes out.

[14:25] And when you look at the final product

[14:27] and you lift up the hood of the game

[14:30] because I know one of the one got sent to a brewing company.

[14:32] The guy has been awesome in terms of taking photos

[14:35] of the play field of the artwork,

[14:37] like lifting the game up, showing the final version

[14:40] of everything talking about how the ship rocking works.

[14:44] All the different things that people have questions about.

[14:47] It was, it's really amazing to see

[14:49] what they put into these games.

[14:52] I mean, Jersey Jack does not hold back.

[14:54] And I've said it before, they pack these games.

[14:57] That he puts everything in the kitchen sink

[15:00] into his products.

[15:02] We all wish that these games would ship sooner.

[15:04] We do.

[15:05] We wish that Jack could get games out faster.

[15:08] But when a Jersey Jack game does get released into the world,

[15:14] I think everyone gets excited

[15:16] because there's no denying that this is a higher level

[15:20] of pinball.

[15:21] It just is.

[15:22] If you put Pirates the Caribbean, Ellie,

[15:25] next to Deadpool, Ellie, next to Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[15:29] Castle, next to Houdini, yes, there's

[15:34] going to be price differences.

[15:35] But I don't think anyone ever looks

[15:38] at a Jersey Jack pinball machine and says,

[15:41] I don't see the value in this game.

[15:44] No one ever says that.

[15:46] They may say it on the collector's edition.

[15:49] But I'm almost doing like an emotional like Miyakopa in 180

[15:54] where I'm not going to lie.

[15:56] I kind of feel like I'm excited that Pirates is out,

[16:00] that if I was in the market for a pinball machine,

[16:03] I think you have to really want to get some time on this game

[16:06] and see if it's good or not.

[16:09] I think visually, and I think everything that's in it,

[16:12] I do think that this is the closest we're getting

[16:16] to sort of Valley Williams error pinball

[16:19] in terms of the world being under the glass

[16:23] that has actual things that the ball interacts with.

[16:26] And that's my main gripe with a lot of the modern stirons.

[16:29] There's just like, there's just nothing there.

[16:32] What is the ball really interacting with in Iron Maiden

[16:36] or in Star Wars and Deadpool?

[16:41] I wish there was just more mechanically

[16:45] where interacting with the ball.

[16:47] And then you look at stuff like dialed in

[16:48] and Pirates and the stuff's just jam packed.

[16:50] Now look, that doesn't mean the games are more fun

[16:53] because there's more mechanical stuff in it.

[16:56] As we know, what makes pinball great is when it's a dance,

[17:01] right, there's a synergy between all those things,

[17:03] between the code, the lights, the sounds, the callouts,

[17:06] the physical things on the play field.

[17:09] But I definitely think Jersey Jack is giving people

[17:12] a heck of a lot inside Pirates of the Caribbean.

[17:15] So I look forward to playing in and luckily for me,

[17:17] there probably will be a Pirates of the Caribbean

[17:20] on location in New York City really, really soon.

[17:23] So I look forward to hopping on that game,

[17:25] putting a headset on and telling you my experience

[17:28] with the game, all right.

[17:30] All right, let's talk about Chicago Gaming Company.

[17:32] We're still waiting for Monster Bash remake.

[17:34] Nothing new there.

[17:36] Moving on to spooky.

[17:38] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is now on the line

[17:41] and we got a great visual.

[17:43] I think there was something like 12 games, maybe more,

[17:45] that spooky was working on at the same time.

[17:48] So in terms of production, spooky has really ramped up

[17:52] their ability to make more games every day.

[17:56] And I think it's exciting.

[17:57] I think Total Nuclear and Isolation.

[17:59] It's a game we don't hear too much about recently.

[18:02] And I was actually starting to realize that when you don't

[18:05] hear a lot about a game on Pinside,

[18:08] it usually means one thing.

[18:10] It usually means people are having fun.

[18:13] They're playing the game and they're satisfied.

[18:16] It's just weird thing with the forum where it's usually

[18:19] when people are pissed off that they're

[18:21] talking about stuff all the time.

[18:23] Every once in a while you get a great thread,

[18:26] like the Batman Club thread.

[18:28] Because there's so much modding going on in Batman

[18:30] that keeps that thread going.

[18:32] And it's also the code updates.

[18:34] But when a game is pretty much done and people are playing it

[18:37] and they're loving it, it starts to become crickets

[18:41] on the forum, which is actually a good thing.

[18:43] I think there's two games to me where the code is kind of done.

[18:46] People are playing it all the time.

[18:48] People are loving it.

[18:50] And you don't really see much action in the threads.

[18:52] And those two games are Iron Maiden and Total Nuclear

[18:56] and Isolation.

[18:57] I think they're just games that are inside people's homes

[18:59] and inside bars and barcades.

[19:02] And people are loving them.

[19:03] And I think that's a great thing.

[19:06] And I think sometimes we have to remind ourselves

[19:09] that a lot of the forum chatter, it exists slowly

[19:13] or insuredly or it's slowly.

[19:15] It just exists to be a place of negativity.

[19:18] Speaking of negativity, we're going to get to home pin.

[19:20] But anyway, so that's a good thing.

[19:23] I did find it interesting that, and I called

[19:27] this, that people who want to sell their Alice Cooper

[19:29] nightmare castles are going to have an interesting time

[19:33] trying to sell their spots.

[19:34] Because right now, if you go on Pinside,

[19:36] there are two different Alice Cooperers for sale.

[19:40] Someone is trying to sell game number 394.

[19:44] So if you're that far into the build,

[19:46] you're going to wait over a year.

[19:47] And someone is also trying to sell game number 66.

[19:52] So game number 394 is for sale.

[19:54] You can buy the $1,000 deposit off the guy for $800 bucks.

[19:59] So you're basically saving yourself $200.

[20:01] Here's what I love.

[20:02] The game that's number 66, you can buy that guy's

[20:06] pre-order spot for $1200.

[20:08] So he's charging you $200 over to get the game early

[20:12] or you can pay $200 less and get the game later.

[20:15] Just, it's just interesting to me.

[20:17] And I don't think this is a great move on Spooky's part,

[20:20] like locking people in like this.

[20:23] I don't think seeing if we see a bunch of people

[20:26] trying to sell their spots, it just doesn't really

[20:28] look good for the game.

[20:31] I think Charlie should have just said,

[20:33] there's just one version of Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[20:37] Forget all the different ways to option it out.

[20:39] I think he should have just made one version.

[20:42] And that's it.

[20:42] And then that way, you don't have to lock people in.

[20:44] The reason he had to lock people in with Rob Zombie

[20:47] is people were one person would order it with the Buttercabin.

[20:51] And then they would bail.

[20:52] And Charlie would then have to sell a version of the game

[20:55] that was customized as someone else's desires.

[20:58] But these aren't like real customization, right?

[21:01] Like no one's ordering the game with like crappy brown armor

[21:05] or this or that.

[21:06] These games are still easy to find buyers for.

[21:09] You know, it's like the auto world

[21:11] where you can order a car in 18 different colors

[21:13] and some of them are just disgusting.

[21:15] I think for the most part, it wouldn't be too hard

[21:17] to find a new buyer.

[21:19] But I think what Charlie saw was that demand for Rob Zombie

[21:23] had dried up.

[21:24] And people were selling the game on the second hand market

[21:28] before he was done with production for much less

[21:31] than a new game cost.

[21:32] And so if you want it one, you could go get one for like a thousand,

[21:36] $1,500 less than new.

[21:38] And then you would bail on your spot.

[21:40] And not only that, then people wouldn't want to go in

[21:42] on the later builds because they would just wait for one

[21:46] to come up second hand.

[21:47] And that's just always going to be the case with Pimball.

[21:49] I don't think any of these games are really going to go up

[21:52] and value.

[21:53] Like you look at Iron Maiden LE.

[21:55] Look how quickly the LEs went from being sold out to,

[22:00] I think you could probably go get one for around MSRP

[22:02] if you really want it one.

[22:04] I think the whole fear of missing out, I have to have it.

[22:07] You know, it's silly.

[22:08] Like I sold my Iron Maiden for almost $3,000 more than it cost me.

[22:14] And I think those days are coming to a little bit of an end.

[22:17] I think, because even if you wait it and you're just patient,

[22:20] you will find every single Pimball machine for sale

[22:24] close to the original price.

[22:27] And with where games are going now,

[22:29] there's just not a lot of room for games to climb up in value.

[22:33] There's a short window and as a flipper,

[22:35] and I'm a self-admitted Pimball flipper,

[22:39] you've got to sell the game in the first couple of weeks.

[22:41] Now, the advice I give people is this,

[22:43] you can tell on day one of reveal whether or not

[22:46] there's money to be made.

[22:47] And this is why I passed on Deadpool LE.

[22:50] There's no money to flip a Deadpool LE.

[22:52] And the reason why is simple, they didn't sell out.

[22:55] They're still available.

[22:56] And if you go on eBay, this is another telltale sign

[22:59] for you guys who want to think about flipping.

[23:01] If the LEDs are available on eBay for MSRP,

[23:05] because right now you can go find Deadpool LEs

[23:07] for $9,000 on eBay.

[23:09] And those listings have been up there for about a week or two.

[23:13] That to me tells me that there aren't more than 500 people

[23:18] in the world who want a Deadpool LE.

[23:20] And so I'm out.

[23:22] There's no money to be made.

[23:23] You will easily be able to get one for $9,000 or less

[23:26] because there's the supply outweighs the demand.

[23:30] That wasn't the case at the initial part of Iron Maiden LE.

[23:33] But even now, you're not seeing Iron Maiden LEs

[23:36] for sale for $9,000.

[23:37] So that was a game to make money on.

[23:40] Will the monsters be one that goes up in value?

[23:43] I don't know.

[23:44] The monsters is an interesting theme.

[23:45] I don't think it's like universally the most popular theme.

[23:49] But I keep hearing that Francian Borg are going to knock it

[23:52] out of the park.

[23:53] So just interesting that that's going on at spooky pinball

[23:58] with those pre-sale spots being opened to buy.

[24:03] All right, let's talk about what I think is just one

[24:07] of the most comical threads on Pinside.

[24:10] You really should just go get a bucket of popcorn

[24:13] and read this thread.

[24:15] If you want to have a good laugh, and if you want a roadmap

[24:18] on how not to sell a pinball machine,

[24:22] on how not to position your pinball company,

[24:26] get some popcorn, pull up a chair,

[24:28] and just start reading the home pin thread.

[24:32] I mean, it is an absolute cluster, fuck,

[24:35] if I've ever seen one.

[24:37] For some reason, Mike continues to carry on like a pork chop,

[24:42] and he just can't stop carrying on like a pork chop.

[24:46] He just, it's just like you would think by now.

[24:49] He would learn that he needs to get people

[24:53] excited about his product and his company.

[24:56] And he continues to just do things and say things that just

[25:01] baffle any logic, any common sense you might have,

[25:05] will be challenged by this individual.

[25:08] And I'm not sure why he does it.

[25:11] I'm not sure why he does it.

[25:12] I think a lot of people are coming to the conclusion

[25:15] that he kind of just likes being a jerk.

[25:18] And I think he takes this stance that he's telling you

[25:22] like it is.

[25:23] And he's sorry that he's not sugar-coating things,

[25:27] but he's going to give you the truth.

[25:29] And he's going to deliver it in a no bullshit way.

[25:33] Now I think Mike needs to learn one thing, right?

[25:36] He acts as if being nice and honest

[25:40] are mutually exclusive things that you

[25:43] can't be both at the same time.

[25:46] And I almost feel bad for Mike because life

[25:48] doesn't work that way.

[25:50] You can actually accomplish both of those things

[25:53] at the same time.

[25:54] You can be nice to your customers,

[25:57] and you can be honest with them.

[26:00] Just because you're delivering something

[26:02] in a strident, aggressive, angry way

[26:06] doesn't mean you're being honest, or doesn't mean what

[26:10] you're saying is what people need to hear.

[26:13] People are buying a toy, Mike.

[26:15] They're buying a toy they don't need from you.

[26:18] What they don't need is to be abused or insulted by you.

[26:24] And so for those of you who haven't been following this story,

[26:27] the genesis of all of this is that Mike took money

[26:31] from Australian buyers first with thunderbirds.

[26:35] And the first pins that he's shipping

[26:38] are not going to those people.

[26:40] They're going to Canada.

[26:42] And there just seems to be this whole like back and forth

[26:45] with Australian buyers and their pissed off

[26:48] that he's not giving them the games.

[26:50] When he said they would get them first,

[26:52] it looks like he's chasing new money

[26:54] by sending the games to Canada and not to Australia.

[26:58] Then we've got ironically another highway

[27:00] pinball company.

[27:00] They're the distributor for Mike in Australia.

[27:03] Now they're talking about how they're

[27:05] going to help customers out.

[27:07] There's like air freight options.

[27:09] I think Mike said the people at the very beginning

[27:11] that shipping wouldn't cost extra now.

[27:14] It is costing extra.

[27:16] And then you come to probably the most ridiculous part

[27:20] of this thread.

[27:22] And it's Wayne from Australia and Mike going back and forth

[27:26] at each other.

[27:27] I mean, it is like a cage match.

[27:29] I've never seen such sort of vitriol thrown at each other.

[27:34] And it's incredible to the point where Wayne is talking

[27:38] about how Mike called them up drunk one night

[27:41] and told them that he was broke and that he burned through all

[27:45] of his wife's insurance money and that he's $3 million

[27:49] in the hole.

[27:50] And these idiots who only invested $50,000

[27:55] are demanding their games.

[27:57] And it's terrible.

[27:58] And then Wayne is like being like you liar, like you this,

[28:02] you that, like I've got $3 million in the bank.

[28:05] I do $10 million a year in sales.

[28:08] I mean, it is just like sort of like just an ego trip times

[28:13] a thousand.

[28:14] And it's the whole thing.

[28:15] I mean, I'm reading it.

[28:17] And I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

[28:19] Like this is pinball.

[28:22] Like people just want to buy a pinball machine.

[28:24] You know, like you go into Stern's Deadpool thread

[28:27] and it's positivity.

[28:28] You go into Jersey Jax and people are excited.

[28:31] You go into spooky and people are excited.

[28:33] You open up the home pin thread.

[28:35] And it's like World War III is going on.

[28:37] And for those of you who say,

[28:38] Canada creates the drama, again, like this is why I've always

[28:42] just been fascinated.

[28:43] All I do is capture the drama.

[28:45] That is out there.

[28:46] I'm not creating any of this.

[28:48] This podcast a long time ago, I think we accurately

[28:53] told people whom Mike really is.

[28:55] And he is.

[28:56] It's like really angry guy.

[28:57] And maybe he could take a page from the Michael Phelps ads,

[29:00] I keep saying, and go get a therapist and chill the fuck out

[29:04] because this is not doing anything good for him.

[29:08] Now, I think to summarize all of this, though.

[29:11] And I think all of you feel the same way.

[29:13] It's like, what is the point of all of this?

[29:15] And the reason why I say that, there's one single thing

[29:19] that I think everyone realizes.

[29:21] And it's just like, what's the point?

[29:23] And that is very simply, the game's not even good.

[29:27] Like if Thunderbirds were great, you might put up with this.

[29:31] It might be worth it.

[29:32] You might be clamoring to get it sent to you.

[29:35] But the game is not good.

[29:37] Like everyone who plays this game comes back with like

[29:40] lukewarm reviews.

[29:42] I think the pre-order people just want what they paid for.

[29:44] They don't care if the game's good or not.

[29:46] They already bought it.

[29:47] Like think about how silly those guys are.

[29:48] They bought it without even playing it.

[29:51] But you know, like Steve Jobs was an asshole.

[29:53] Henry Ford was an asshole.

[29:55] But those people made amazing magical things.

[30:00] They put amazing inventions into the world.

[30:03] Mike might be a jerk.

[30:05] But if Thunderbirds was amazing,

[30:06] all would be probably forgiven.

[30:08] But because it's not, you literally can't help but be like,

[30:12] this whole thing is just going to implode and collapse on

[30:15] itself simply because the game is not there.

[30:18] You know, the only reason why people are still willing to give

[30:21] John Papaduke another shot is there's still belief that he

[30:25] can create a great pinball game.

[30:28] I kind of feel like the nails are going into the coffin of

[30:33] home pin pretty quickly.

[30:36] And they're either going to need like another game or two to be

[30:39] ready to go to turn things around.

[30:42] But how can you really successfully launch a pinball company

[30:46] if your inaugural game is a flop?

[30:48] Like I don't think you can.

[30:50] Like you can't stay in business and hope to get to a good game.

[30:54] You know, why sold enough?

[30:56] Charlie sold enough America's most honnets.

[30:59] Do they even sell 150 Thunderbirds?

[31:02] I don't know.

[31:03] I mean, he probably needs to sell a few thousand to stay in

[31:06] business.

[31:06] If you think about it like this, let's run the math.

[31:09] If Mike is 3,000 in on Thunderbirds and let's just say he

[31:14] makes $1,000 profit on each one he makes, which I don't even

[31:18] think he could because he's only selling them for $5,000.

[31:21] But let's just hypothetically say he makes a grant on each one.

[31:25] He then has to sell.

[31:26] Are you ready for it?

[31:27] He has to sell 3,000 of them to make $3 million back.

[31:33] 3,000 of them.

[31:35] So what happens if he only sells 300?

[31:37] And that's the problem.

[31:39] Is none of these guys do the market research?

[31:42] And if you're going to get into making pinball, you need to make your game great.

[31:46] Now, I still think Ben Heck is right.

[31:47] I think this whole company is a red herring just so Mike can make pinball

[31:50] parts and sell his parts to stern and other people out there in the world.

[31:55] Because if he can make coils for cheaper, he could probably make more money

[31:58] selling coils to pinball people around the world versus trying to make a game

[32:02] himself.

[32:02] So we'll see what comes of it.

[32:04] But just another crazy home pin thread that is just enjoyable.

[32:10] And in its own sadness, it's enjoyable.

[32:13] All right.

[32:14] What else is going on in the pinball world?

[32:15] Not much.

[32:16] Not much.

[32:17] I'll say this.

[32:18] I want to close on.

[32:19] I think I have a couple emails I want to read from you guys.

[32:21] And something happened to me yesterday.

[32:22] I was just sort of waiting to have brunch with a friend.

[32:24] And I'm in this bar in Murray Hill called Brother Jimmy's.

[32:28] And they have a beat enough, probably beat into crap.

[32:32] Or coaster typhoon or tycoon.

[32:36] Just a typhoon.

[32:37] Roller coaster tycoon.

[32:39] And it was the games got four flippers.

[32:42] The upper right flipper didn't work.

[32:45] But I put a dollar in and I started playing it.

[32:47] And first I realized, you know, this is like for most people pinball location,

[32:51] the game experiences shit.

[32:52] Like the games get beat to shit.

[32:53] Unless you're like in a pinball bar where the owner really takes care of it.

[32:57] For the most part, when there's just one pinball machine in a bar, typically it's not

[33:01] a pinball bar and the game's going to be crappy.

[33:05] But I'll say this, I walked away from that game.

[33:08] Just kind of mesmerized by the amount of stuff that's just in it.

[33:11] Just all the different ramps going all the different places.

[33:14] The ramp looping around down by the flippers.

[33:18] The rail ramp.

[33:19] And it's just like, it looks like a roller coaster world like under a glass.

[33:23] I'm going to keep saying world under glass.

[33:25] But I just do think it is kind of comical.

[33:28] How little we're getting in some of these modern games when it comes to actually like the

[33:33] physical stuff in the game.

[33:35] And I don't know, like I keep thinking more and more about like how beautiful the games

[33:40] are looking from an artistic standpoint, how nice the displays are.

[33:44] But I really do.

[33:45] I have a wish that Stern pinball, the number one pinball manufacturer would literally

[33:51] get back to more of the physical stuff under the glass.

[33:55] I mean, George Gomez would always say they see the game as being a game under glass.

[34:00] And I just don't think the recent releases are doing that.

[34:05] I think we do see it in pirates.

[34:07] I definitely think, you know, Alice Cooper's nightmare castle, like what that big castle

[34:12] does give you.

[34:14] To me, Alice Cooper looks like it's halfway there.

[34:17] It's got this ginormous like he man castle grayschool thing going on.

[34:21] But it's still a very simple game.

[34:23] There's not nearly as much, you know, interacting with the ball as I think I would like to see

[34:29] in a game.

[34:30] But again, like, you know, the spooky price point is not super high.

[34:32] You know, to me, it's to me, if I'm to be honest with all of you, I just wish Jersey

[34:39] Jack could get it right.

[34:42] And then that's it.

[34:43] I just wish he could really knock it out of the park with the game because I think we

[34:45] all would buy it.

[34:47] He's always so close.

[34:50] Even just wins because they've got the best themes and they got the best cadence of shipping.

[34:56] We know that Stern's going to ship us monsters by the end of the year.

[34:59] We know Beatles is going to happen.

[35:00] We probably know all these other things are going to happen that are going to be awesome

[35:03] themes.

[35:04] I don't need to worry if I'm going to get my Stern game.

[35:09] If I buy it, I get it.

[35:11] That's how it should be.

[35:12] No one wants to wait a year for a game.

[35:15] But again, I just think we're just stuck in this compromise.

[35:17] If Stern and Jersey Jack could just unite, we would like to know.

[35:20] We would get the best Pimball machines on planet earth.

[35:23] Maybe Stern should just buy Jersey Jack out and have a premium line of games that they

[35:28] charge $12,000 for.

[35:29] No, it's never going to happen.

[35:31] Never going to happen.

[35:32] Anyway, everyone, email me at canadapimballedgmail.com.

[35:36] Speaking of that, let me read a few of your emails and then we're going to call it a day.

[35:39] We're doing shorter shows.

[35:40] I hope you like it.

[35:41] I hope you like it.

[35:42] Let me pull up Canada's Pimball email address.

[35:46] I haven't been getting too many.

[35:48] As I said, I feel a lonely man.

[35:50] We're going to get more interviews going.

[35:52] I know I haven't interviewed people in a while.

[35:55] I think I explained why.

[35:57] Let's see.

[35:58] I got an email from...

[36:01] Okay, bland, bland.

[36:05] He said, what the hell is with everyone blacklisting you?

[36:09] Falcon Punch on dumbass Pinside said you will never be on head to head ever.

[36:15] Not to mention the Bobo head that was bullshit, so the douche said.

[36:21] The more I read Pinside, the more I'm glad I don't talk to anyone.

[36:25] Seems mostly everyone on there are pecker heads.

[36:29] On head to head, it's good to listen to when I'm constipated.

[36:33] Keep up the good work, brother.

[36:35] People in 2018 are...

[36:37] I don't want to say this words.

[36:38] And can't handle the truth and realistic notions.

[36:42] Peace, Sean.

[36:43] Well, Sean, thank you for the very colorful commentary on why you listen to this show.

[36:49] And here's the thing, Ryan and I are really good friends.

[36:51] I talk to Ryan every day.

[36:53] We're mostly every day, but we jab back and forth, but he's not being adduced.

[36:57] The only reason that I will not be allowed to be on head to head pinball is because Marty

[37:03] doesn't want to let me on the show.

[37:06] And I think it's a little bit of a shame.

[37:08] I would love to come on the show and talk with them.

[37:11] I would love to have Marty and Ryan come on my show.

[37:14] We gave Ryan his shot at pinball podcasting fame.

[37:18] He got his start right here on this show.

[37:21] So I think it's unfortunate that Canada can't come on their show.

[37:26] You should email them and tell them that you would love to have Canada on as I guess.

[37:30] And Marty knows it would do gangbusters.

[37:33] I'm much more entertaining than the coder they just interviewed at Stern.

[37:39] It would be a great chat.

[37:43] I should even start to work on my Marty.

[37:46] I'm going to do a Canada laugh track that I give to them.

[37:49] My next podcast, let me come up with a few examples of what that laugh track would be.

[37:53] You guys can pick which one I send to them.

[37:55] How's that sound?

[37:56] Is that sound good?

[37:57] All right.

[37:58] Let's go on to another email.

[37:59] Sean, thank you for listening to the show.

[38:02] Let's see.

[38:03] Drew, Drew, I got an email from trying to get someone on the show.

[38:06] Let's see.

[38:07] Melissa Cooper and Charlie's designs.

[38:09] Okay.

[38:10] This came from Dave Sanders.

[38:12] Dave said, maybe all Charlie from spooky really needs is an extra pair of eyes to go over

[38:17] his designs.

[38:18] Give them a once over and optimize the space to squeeze every last available square millimeter

[38:24] into the shot openings.

[38:26] Since his geometry seems sound enough, that's what I'm good at.

[38:29] Barry O and I would go back and forth that way.

[38:32] And I assume Ben Heck was doing that before he left.

[38:35] So Dave, thank you.

[38:37] Yeah, look, I think when shots are too tight in a machine and the game is breaking a lot,

[38:42] I think that's bad geometry.

[38:44] Don't let roto Dave fool you people out there.

[38:47] Like a brick fest is not a good designed game.

[38:51] You know what makes Pimball hard enough like having to hit the combos?

[38:55] The actual opening to a shot shouldn't be ridiculously tight.

[38:59] What should make it tough is getting through the mode and through the code and what you

[39:03] need to do to accomplish that.

[39:06] The shots should be makeable.

[39:08] And I think it would help Charlie to have another set of eyes.

[39:11] You know, I heard from Ben Heck that he was helping Charlie, but I think he just got tired

[39:17] of trying to always, as he would put it, maybe like fix some of Charlie's bad designs.

[39:23] And he wanted to just work on his own game.

[39:26] And I think that was a little bit of the reason why he left.

[39:28] But I think the main reason was he was just tired of waiting for his game to go on the

[39:31] line.

[39:32] It was going to take too long.

[39:34] But it sounds like Dave might be offering you some help Charlie.

[39:37] So maybe you guys can connect.

[39:38] I'd happily connect you to.

[39:40] All right, let's read another user email here.

[39:43] Do do do do do.

[39:46] This is from Angela Moro.

[39:48] He writes coast to coast has paid ads on Facebook.

[39:52] He said, Hey Chris, just thought I will let you know about coast to coast news to me.

[39:56] I do like his podcast too.

[39:58] Just you and him I listen to.

[40:00] Have you thought about setting up a patron account?

[40:03] Okay, so that's so it looks like coast to coast pinball like they when he did an interview

[40:08] with George Gomez, he actually puts paid behind it to get people to listen to it.

[40:13] And he it's a he has a screen grab from Facebook and there's a sponsored post from coast

[40:18] to coast pinball.

[40:19] Look, I mean, I don't know if Nate makes money doing his podcast.

[40:23] I sure as hell don't make any money.

[40:25] Neither does head to head pinball.

[40:27] I don't think anyone really does.

[40:28] I think there might be some money that people donate to this week in pinball, but I don't

[40:34] do this for the money.

[40:35] I was thinking it might make sense for me to set up a little feature so you guys could

[40:40] donate to the show.

[40:41] I do spend a lot of time doing this show.

[40:43] A lot of time that I should be at work.

[40:46] I should be doing other things.

[40:48] It would be nice.

[40:49] I don't know.

[40:50] Would you guys want to donate a few bucks to the show to show your support?

[40:53] Would you rather buy t-shirts?

[40:55] I'd love to hear from you.

[40:56] In what form would you feel comfortable maybe donating to the cause?

[41:01] And it's probably hard for people to donate to me since I'm always boasting about driving

[41:07] Dodge demons and buying Gucci clothes and working and marketing.

[41:12] Yeah.

[41:13] So I don't feel like it's more about showing support.

[41:15] I don't need the money.

[41:17] But it would be nice to have some sort of some some payment from this because it is work.

[41:22] We're giving this away for free.

[41:25] We're all giving you guys free entertainment.

[41:27] I don't even have a single pinball company that wants to do any advertisements on this show

[41:32] which always made me laugh.

[41:33] I should just start doing them anyway without their permission.

[41:36] Alright, let's go back to another one.

[41:39] Oh, and by the way, I wish Nate would do more shows I do.

[41:42] He swoops in whenever there's a new game release.

[41:44] He gets like the big interview exclusive and then he's gone.

[41:50] So hopefully Nate can do more shows because I always love listening to Nate show.

[41:54] Alright, so I got an email.

[41:56] I love when it's like, please don't use my real name.

[41:58] So this person wrote and said, hi, Kay.

[42:02] I started to thread the other day and just wanted to it just shows how toxic pinsetters

[42:07] can be when asked a simple question.

[42:10] So the topic was this.

[42:12] He wrote, I have a hundred thousand dollars for twelve pins to buy.

[42:17] Which ones should I buy?

[42:19] And of course, a post like that will always set off the pinside people and makes people

[42:26] defensive because you're basically saying, I have a lot more money than most of you and

[42:32] I can go buy a hundred thousand dollars in pinball machines.

[42:37] What should I get?

[42:38] And for a lot of people in this hobby, they don't have anywhere near that in terms of assets

[42:44] or net worth or anything.

[42:46] So it is a little bit of a boastful way to ask a question.

[42:50] You could easily say, I'm going to buy ten pinball machines over the next year.

[42:55] Which ten machines do you think are the best?

[42:58] You could even come up with the story that's like, I'm building a barcade or whatever,

[43:03] you could spin it in a way that doesn't make it seem like I'm richer than you.

[43:08] Here we go.

[43:09] But I also think, you know, when you do a post like that, you are purposely trolling the

[43:14] form a little bit and it's fun to see people like lose their minds when people do, sort

[43:21] of show that there are a lot of very wealthy people in this hobby.

[43:25] Whenever I look at game rooms, I'm always curious because there's such a polarization of finances

[43:33] in this industry.

[43:34] I mean, some guys have, you know, one pin in a beaten down house and some guys have basement

[43:40] arcades that look like they cost like $200,000.

[43:43] So and everything in between.

[43:45] But it's great, you know, more power to you.

[43:47] This is what makes this hobby great is that no matter if you're richer poor, I think you

[43:51] can enjoy pinball no matter your financial situation.

[43:55] It just shouldn't be the only thing you have money and that's my whole thing.

[43:57] All right.

[43:58] All right.

[43:59] Let's see.

[44:00] I got an email from someone and says, yo, hey Chris, love the podcast, dude.

[44:04] Would like to come on the show sometime to talk pinball and, you know, give you my thoughts

[44:10] while I drink a beer.

[44:12] All right.

[44:13] Or buy a beer for me at TPM.

[44:14] All right.

[44:15] So we're going to get some people on the show.

[44:16] That's just, that's just going to happen.

[44:17] All right.

[44:18] Everyone, we're at the 45 minute mark.

[44:19] I hope you enjoyed this episode number 257 of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[44:24] We will be back.

[44:25] We're going to get some interviews.

[44:26] I'm getting tired of just talking to you guys about pinball.

[44:28] I also want to get some time on pirates soon.

[44:30] I don't know if Jack and company will let me come by and interview him about the game.

[44:33] I'll reach out.

[44:34] Jack's always a nice guy.

[44:35] I don't even think Jack listens to podcasts.

[44:37] He's like too busy getting his company going.

[44:39] So maybe we'll do a drive over to JJP.

[44:43] We'll try and set that up since they're only like an hour and a half away.

[44:47] Everyone, have a great week.

[44:49] Maybe we'll see Monster Bash remake this week.

[44:51] Maybe we won't.

[44:52] Maybe we'll get a new stream of Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle.

[44:55] Maybe we won't.

[44:56] Enjoy your pinball machines and we'll talk to you real soon.
