[00:00] Welcome to episode 169 of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:27] I'm your host, Canada.

[00:29] On this episode, we interview Blake Dumasnil, who went to Expo.

[00:34] So I think you're going to enjoy his take on what he saw there.

[00:37] But more importantly, he also took a tour of American Pinball.

[00:41] So I really think you're going to enjoy what he saw when he went through the same door

[00:46] that John Papaduch once went through.

[00:48] But now there's actually a game coming out.

[00:51] I have to apologize in advance.

[00:54] Blake's computer wasn't working, so he had a download Skype to his cell phone.

[00:59] And there's periods where it cuts in and out.

[01:01] And I know I've never had an interview sound so scratchy.

[01:05] And I was even debating whether or not I put it up, but I want to put it up so that Blake

[01:09] can hear it, feel ashamed, and go buy a new computer or fix his technology issues.

[01:16] Before I air the interview, just a couple of news items I want to talk about.

[01:20] Okay, first and foremost, let's talk about Alien Pinball, which is shipping right now.

[01:25] So if you're in the thread and this company has spent the last six months getting these

[01:31] Alien machines ready to go out the door, I think you have to be concerned that the games

[01:36] are shipping and immediately there's a lot of quality control issues with the games.

[01:42] Even if you just look at the photos inside the Alien thread, it's all these photos of wires

[01:47] and connectors and trying to figure out what connector goes to what thing and how do I

[01:52] get my back box working and my LCD just broken.

[01:56] All these issues are plaguing some of the owner's games.

[01:59] Now look, there's not many owners right now.

[02:02] So one person might have received a lemon and that could be the issue.

[02:07] But I think people are really concerned.

[02:09] I think they're concerned that the quality is not there.

[02:12] The quality of these machines is not going to be up to par.

[02:16] And I think the real, real concern is how long will Highway Pinball be around in the

[02:21] long term if I buy one of these games now?

[02:25] No one wants to buy a game and then a year from now the company goes away and there's

[02:29] no support.

[02:30] There's no parts.

[02:32] That's the same issue that's plaguing big Lebowski owners and Alien Pinball owners.

[02:38] So I think roughly 21 games have gone out.

[02:41] There's still absolutely no word when Ellie owners are going to get their machines.

[02:46] And if you're an Ellie owner, I don't know how you are still patient right now.

[02:51] You were the first people to give Andrew Highway your money.

[02:54] You were the biggest alien fans.

[02:56] Not only are you watching probably new orders and new standard edition people get their

[03:02] games before you, but you still have no idea what exactly you're getting with your limited

[03:08] edition game.

[03:09] You don't even know right?

[03:11] They yanked out the real limited edition stuff.

[03:14] So you probably are like, well just give me a standard edition and send me the upgrades

[03:20] later.

[03:21] Now the two big issues that just won't go away here are the people that have been waiting

[03:27] forever to get their repopulated playfields.

[03:30] These are the people that already gave Andrew money when he shipped the first installment

[03:34] of aliens.

[03:35] I'm earlier in 2017.

[03:37] They were told by the new owners they are going to get populated playfields.

[03:41] They have not received those.

[03:43] Not everybody has received a refund.

[03:45] And ultimately these new owners have disappeared.

[03:49] They are not communicating.

[03:51] They are not transparent.

[03:52] And I think they have this approach of well let's just let's not engage the mob.

[03:58] Let's ship the games and we'll let the games do the talking.

[04:01] The problem is the games are talking and they're saying to the world the quality is not

[04:06] there and that people should be concerned.

[04:08] And I've said it from the get go.

[04:10] If you have money in on this project you should get your money back and wait until there

[04:17] are a bunch of games sitting in boxes at CoinTaker and you know that the quality is up to where

[04:24] you want it to be because there's just too many options out there to have your money

[04:27] frozen in this.

[04:28] All right.

[04:30] Now what else is going on?

[04:32] And speaking of companies trying to figure it out, well we're going to talk to Blake

[04:35] about Dutch pinball.

[04:37] I wanted to read something from someone on Pinside when it comes to Dutch pinball.

[04:41] So if you go into the Big Lebowski the preorder club page.

[04:45] This is a page on Pinside where it's supposed to be people who are in on Lebowski.

[04:50] The thing is this only about 50 people have their Big Lebowski.

[04:53] So the club is pretty small but hundreds of people are interested in the game and so

[04:59] they're all chiming in.

[05:00] Now I wanted to read a post from someone.

[05:03] His name is Hydef on Pinside.

[05:05] And this man, he gave CoinTaker money to buy Big Lebowski.

[05:09] I don't know since 2014, right?

[05:13] Now he had a special deal with CoinTaker where instead of CoinTaker holding the money,

[05:19] he knew that when he sent CoinTaker his money that that money was going to go to Dutch.

[05:24] It was going to go directly to Dutch pinball.

[05:26] It wasn't going to be held in escrow by CoinTaker.

[05:29] And so Chris at CoinTaker basically chimed in and told the guy who's been now saying

[05:35] on the message boards that he's giving everyone a date by January 2018 that if he doesn't

[05:41] get his game or a refund, he's going to go after people.

[05:46] I probably sue them or try to do something.

[05:49] And at first he started to attack CoinTakers.

[05:52] I want my money back and CoinTaker was like wait a minute bro.

[05:55] The deal was you knew your money was going to Dutch.

[05:58] Now I want to read what HighDeaf wrote.

[06:00] He wrote, I have been the biggest DP proponent and supporter, but my patience has worn

[06:06] thin.

[06:07] Perhaps you can relay the message to Dutch pinball that January 2018 is my drop dead deadline

[06:13] before I take action.

[06:15] I don't care if Dutch pinball has to sell themselves in the red light district, asless

[06:19] chaps and all.

[06:21] I am not going to wait until New orders receive their games to get my game that was ordered

[06:25] back in 2014.

[06:27] That's how this was presented or sold to me.

[06:30] Their supplier dispute is not my problem.

[06:33] I have plenty of other obstacles and challenges in my life to battle.

[06:37] Nothing personal but I need a game or my money back come January 2018.

[06:42] I really want at this game, but I can't allow my $8500 to drift away due to bad business

[06:48] decisions and running changes that affect it's value.

[06:52] Supplier issues, music code, order of game production.

[06:55] If Dutch pinball isn't going to resume production where they left off, then they need to be

[06:59] transparent and upfront about it don't make people ask.

[07:03] I'd rather put my money into a new attack from Mars Remake or total annihilation because

[07:08] I have confidence in these US based manufacturers and I know my game will show up.

[07:13] Alright, well here's a thing HighDeaf.

[07:16] You gave Dutch pinball a startup company your money in 2014 before they were approving

[07:24] company before they knew how to manufacture games and before games were inbox.

[07:30] So you ostensibly paid for something that didn't even exist.

[07:34] You invest it in a startup.

[07:36] That startup since 2014 has had nothing but obstacles, nothing but issues and pretty much

[07:43] went belly up.

[07:44] You are not in a position to demand anything your money could be gone.

[07:50] When I read posts like this and I read people who say I don't want to deal with these

[07:55] issues, they're now your issues.

[07:57] When you invest in a company, their issues become your issues and I just find it funny

[08:02] in the pinball world.

[08:04] This is the hardest lesson.

[08:05] This is the hardest pill that everyone has had to swallow.

[08:09] It doesn't matter what you want.

[08:12] The reality is when you invest in these companies, you are now an investor.

[08:17] You are now part of that company.

[08:19] Their pitfalls are your pitfalls.

[08:21] Their headaches are your headaches.

[08:23] Their mishaps are your mishaps.

[08:25] And come January 2018.

[08:27] There is nothing that you can do HighDeaf.

[08:30] There is nothing.

[08:31] And here's why.

[08:32] Because if you try to take legal action against a company that is in the Netherlands, good

[08:38] luck.

[08:39] If you even try to contact a lawyer, it'll be 500 bucks the first moment you sit step

[08:44] foot in their office and try to even have a consultation meeting with them.

[08:48] You're never going to get your game.

[08:51] You're never going to want to invest the money in any legal action.

[08:56] You had a deal with CoinTaker that your money would go to Dutch.

[09:00] You can't go after them either.

[09:02] You can hop and you can pop and that's what you're doing.

[09:05] At the end of the day, I empathize with you.

[09:09] But I also think you need to understand the reality, the situation.

[09:13] There's a lot of people in the same boat as you that want refunds.

[09:17] I mean, my friend Bill Brandes wants a refund.

[09:19] I have other friends in on the game.

[09:21] I think what sparked a lot of this angst is rare here of getting his refund and people

[09:27] want their money back because he got his money back.

[09:30] Now look, Greg went in, got his money back.

[09:32] Greg went and was proactive and did stuff.

[09:34] And even if Greg threatened to contact Universal to get his money back, who cares?

[09:39] When you lose faith in a company and all bets are off, go do what you need to do to take

[09:45] care of yourself.

[09:46] And I think that's the other part is people act like everyone has a responsibility to

[09:51] look out for the whole community when it comes to these bullshit companies like Dutch

[09:55] and SkitBee.

[09:56] But at the end of the day, the individuals that looked out for themselves and went and

[10:01] got their money back first, those individuals, oh, nobody else, anything.

[10:06] They don't owe you shit.

[10:07] They're not in this to make sure everyone is made whole.

[10:10] The same is true of the people who got their money back from John Papadoug when they went

[10:14] over there and something smelled fishy.

[10:17] Okay?

[10:18] So it sucks.

[10:20] The situation I think sucks.

[10:22] I think Dutch Pimball's business plan, as we'll talk about with Blake, is absolute garbage.

[10:28] They basically told people.

[10:29] They told people that our business plan is a pyramid scheme.

[10:33] And did people shout at them?

[10:36] Did they kick them out of Expo?

[10:38] No.

[10:39] You guys all take it on the keyster.

[10:42] Why do you allow these people into your shows?

[10:44] Why do you allow them to have the microphone?

[10:47] Why do you allow them to speak about their plans?

[10:50] And when those plans are ridiculous, you still don't lambace them.

[10:55] I only blame the Pimball people.

[10:57] You guys are like, what are those bugs in Wreckit Ralph that just move towards the light?

[11:02] The second they tell you, like, oh, things are fine.

[11:05] You immediately move towards the light again and have faith again.

[11:09] I get it.

[11:10] All you can do is have faith because otherwise it's too painful to accept the reality.

[11:15] But Dutch Pimball, their new plan of getting new money in to build the old games, it doesn't

[11:20] make sense because eventually they hit a point where then where's the money come from

[11:25] to build the old games.

[11:26] I mean, it doesn't, I feel like a third grader could look at this business plan and be

[11:30] like, that's not going to work.

[11:31] But we have a bunch of adults who have thrown hundreds of thousands of dollars at this company

[11:36] that are continuing to make excuses.

[11:38] So that's all I'm going to say on that.

[11:40] I think that the Dutch Pimball thread is going to get worse and worse and worse as we move

[11:46] towards the end of the year because people are actually expecting to get big Lebowski's

[11:49] by December.

[11:51] It's not going to happen.

[11:54] Okay.

[11:55] It's not.

[11:56] No Fn way.

[11:57] All right.

[11:58] Speaking about games by the end of the year, we should be hearing about Guardians of the

[12:02] Galaxy any day now, any day now.

[12:04] I think it will be probably by the end of next week.

[12:07] We're going to get the reveal.

[12:09] They have to because Stern is supposed to ship this game in November and guess what next

[12:12] week is November.

[12:15] Stern is going to want to have a new game on the line by the holidays.

[12:18] Stern is smart.

[12:19] Stern's business people realize people spend money during the holidays.

[12:24] There's a reason why Q4 is when all the new video games come out.

[12:28] It's when all the new toys come out.

[12:29] It's when all the new sort of non-necessity items are released.

[12:34] It's when the Dutch demon is coming out.

[12:36] All these companies know that Q4 is the moment when people get their holiday bonuses.

[12:41] It's the moment when they spend on these things.

[12:44] So Stern is smart.

[12:45] They're going to have a new game out.

[12:46] It's going to be Guardians of the Galaxy.

[12:48] We hope it's good.

[12:49] I can't speculate any more than that.

[12:52] I'll say this, the other companies that need it to have their ship together in game shipping

[12:57] in Q4 were Dutch, were highway pinball, and I think Houdini as well.

[13:03] You'll hear Houdini's aiming for end of November.

[13:05] I hope they hit that date.

[13:07] But again, as we hear the numbers from Blake, it's just a couple games.

[13:11] It's not a lot.

[13:12] It's not a lot of games.

[13:14] All right.

[13:15] What else is going on?

[13:16] I wanted to also close the door on the whole Ossiercade, Mike from Home Pin, BS.

[13:23] Okay, because you guys heard in my last interview with Ben Heck, it's so clear as day that Mike

[13:29] took Ben's system.

[13:31] And all Ben wants is to be acknowledged that we did the work that Ben and his friends

[13:37] are the ones who did the work that Mike stole.

[13:40] And Mike should stop just making all these excuses.

[13:45] And here's the thing.

[13:47] If Ben's system isn't what makes it into the final version of Thunderbirds, it doesn't

[13:52] make it any better that he stole Ben's work for the prototype of Thunderbirds and then

[13:57] won't acknowledge that theft.

[14:01] And the other part is if someone put up a thread on Ossiercade talking about the Ben Heck

[14:07] interview.

[14:08] And someone sent me a note and said, hey, why don't you chime in?

[14:11] And the reason why I can't chime in is I am banned from Ossiercade forum.

[14:16] I can log in to that forum.

[14:18] I can't post anything.

[14:20] They've taken away all my privileges.

[14:22] Now I do find it funny that I put up a podcast saying I was banned by the forum.

[14:28] They lift it my ban.

[14:29] So I was able to go on and say, hey, cool.

[14:32] You guys like now you changed your mind.

[14:34] And then they go and ban me.

[14:35] And they go and lock my thread.

[14:37] So they've locked the Canadian pinball podcast thread.

[14:40] They've ban me from the forum.

[14:41] And if you go read that thread about the Ben Heck interview on there, go read Mike and

[14:47] he's at his same old bullish self making all these excuses in the world.

[14:52] He won't give his side of the story.

[14:54] He even admits he won't even listen to the podcast where I interviewed Ben.

[14:59] And that just goes to show I think the kind of guy he is.

[15:01] I mean, if someone put up a podcast about me, I would check it out.

[15:04] I would chime in.

[15:06] I would want to give my point of view on it.

[15:08] And he goes from being, he wants like, it's so hard to give empathy to this man.

[15:14] And we get he's been through a lot of personal hardships.

[15:17] But then he talks about how he has to do something with his late wife.

[15:21] And then in the same thread, he's talking about how this singer at this club has this

[15:26] amazing pair of you know what?

[15:28] It's like, he just loves to throw out that male meathead sentiment.

[15:35] And look, we live in a culture now, Mike from home.

[15:37] And we live in a society right now that's going through an amazing time because we are

[15:42] outing this meathead culture that is permeated culture and permeated businesses for far too

[15:49] long.

[15:50] Harvey Weinstein, anyone?

[15:51] You know, everyone is getting out of celebrity chefs, you know, movie, movie moguls, you

[15:57] know, Hollywood actors, stars.

[15:59] The bottom line is this, nobody, nobody wants this meathead culture to prevail.

[16:06] And it's about time like people are speaking up about it.

[16:09] And the fact that Mike not only celebrates that meathead sort of culture, but he goes on

[16:15] to like, say to everyone else, fuck off, I don't care, you know, it's total BS.

[16:21] And the last point I'll make is in the thread on Aussie arcade, someone said that we were,

[16:26] Ben and I said that we were, we didn't believe that his programmer died.

[16:30] We never said that.

[16:31] We completely acknowledged that.

[16:33] And we think that's the reason why Mike went and stole Ben's work.

[16:35] So like, I think Mike from Home Pin is, is who he is.

[16:40] It's up to you to decide if you want to buy his products.

[16:42] I think he has no room in this community.

[16:46] I think people like that are not worth talking about anymore.

[16:52] I'm not going to cover Home Pin or Thunderbirds.

[16:55] The game is so bad, it's not even worth covering.

[16:57] I think you all agree with that.

[16:59] I think he's a vile individual.

[17:01] And you know, as much as people call me all sorts of names and call me a narcissist,

[17:05] call me toxic, call me cancerous, I know that I'm not a bad person.

[17:09] I know I'm not.

[17:10] I've done bad things.

[17:12] I've probably said things that I regret on this podcast.

[17:15] And whenever I have, I've always apologized.

[17:17] I've always removed those podcasts.

[17:19] And I've always sort of tried to find, you know, a better way out.

[17:23] I think Mike does the complete opposite.

[17:25] You know, for me, the ultimate convalescence episode for this podcast, if I could have

[17:30] one dream guest to come on and let's just talk pinball and bird the hatchet completely,

[17:35] it would be orc loss.

[17:37] And you know, because I'm like friends with orcs friends, like I'm really good friends

[17:40] with Greg Colton, Greg is friends with orc.

[17:42] And I would love orc to come on the show because you know what, I think after everything

[17:47] that's happened between us, I think both of us have put it behind us and it's over.

[17:52] It's like water under the bridge.

[17:53] It's like we both got caught up in a vortex at a bad time.

[17:58] And you know, and that's just my offer to him is to come on.

[18:00] Let's just talk pinball and let's talk about what he's excited about because I think

[18:04] birding the hatchet and forgiving and moving on past bad moments is important in life.

[18:09] And we all have to do them in different areas of our life.

[18:12] All right.

[18:13] Maybe I should get off this soap box.

[18:15] What else do I want to say?

[18:17] Batman 66 code is supposed to come out this week.

[18:20] For those of you out there who have a Batman 66, I keep hearing Iceman be like, this

[18:25] is the week.

[18:26] This is the week.

[18:27] I feel like Iceman just has like all this booze waiting on Friday and it's like if Batman

[18:32] code doesn't come out, he just like drinks bottles of booze.

[18:35] Look, here's my, here's my, here's my guess.

[18:39] I don't, I don't know when it's coming out.

[18:41] I don't think it's going to be this week because it's always this week and it's we've

[18:44] been saying this week for like eight months.

[18:47] I do think this.

[18:48] I think when the code comes out, it's

[18:50] not going to be what you think it is.

[18:52] It's not going to blow people away.

[18:54] My assumption is that Lyman is struggling with this game.

[18:58] I think the game, there's just too much content from all the shows.

[19:01] I think the shots just aren't there.

[19:03] One final point on Batman, it just doesn't have that wow shot.

[19:07] And that's my problem with the game.

[19:09] Batman is a wow show with all this fun quirky stuff going on and the game itself does not

[19:13] have the wow shot.

[19:15] It's, I think it does have the world under glass.

[19:17] Look, it's very colorful.

[19:19] But I just don't think this game's ever going to become the walking dead.

[19:23] When I look at the walking dead play field versus Batman, I still think the walking dead

[19:27] is a much more interesting layout and has a lot more wow stuff going on in the game

[19:31] than Batman 66.

[19:32] All right.

[19:33] All right.

[19:34] Anything else I'm missing?

[19:35] I'm not really sure.

[19:37] I don't really care right now because I got to get ready to go have some breakfast with

[19:41] Brenda.

[19:42] Guys, enjoy this interview with Blake.

[19:44] Again, I'm sorry about the quality.

[19:46] It's all Blake's fault.

[19:47] It is.

[19:48] Hey, my name is Blake, come on man.

[19:51] Get a freaking computer that works.

[19:54] I'll talk to you guys soon.

[19:56] All right.

[19:57] Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome back to Canadian's Pinball podcast.

[20:00] Blake Dumas-Sneal who actually went to Pinball Expo.

[20:04] Blake, welcome back to the show.

[20:06] What's up, Chris?

[20:07] How's it going man?

[20:09] It's good.

[20:10] It's good.

[20:11] I'm living a life in transition.

[20:13] Our renovations almost done.

[20:14] I'm engaged.

[20:15] I'm selling my health cat.

[20:16] I'm like growing up.

[20:18] Yeah, no, no, no.

[20:19] Congratulations on the engagement.

[20:22] That's awesome news.

[20:24] Thank you, thank you.

[20:26] And as we were away, Brendan and I were in Europe, Pimbal Expo was going on.

[20:30] I would have been there with you Blake.

[20:32] I would have been drinking with you guys.

[20:34] But you were there.

[20:35] So we're excited to talk to someone who actually went to the show.

[20:38] I also know that you went on a tour of American Pimbal.

[20:42] Let's start there because I think there's been a lot of recap of Expo.

[20:45] And we'll go into what you saw at the show.

[20:48] But I want to hear from you what it was like going through the doors, the same doors that

[20:54] John Papaduc once went through and entered into the world of American Pimbal.

[20:58] So can we talk about what you saw there?

[21:02] Yeah, yeah.

[21:04] DeVal was very nice about inviting Ed Van Der Reen with TPS and I out to see the facility.

[21:12] Just to, you know, I think they're wanting to prove that they're legit operation and

[21:15] they actually have got a kind of a line set up and that are moving forward.

[21:20] It's a nice facility.

[21:22] They've definitely, you know, there are no traces of John Papaduc anywhere in the facility

[21:26] at all.

[21:27] Did you check the band's walls?

[21:31] I did not use the facilities while we were there.

[21:34] It's like the J-Poop is on like above each toilet.

[21:37] Well, you know, that's probably what's cool.

[21:41] Anyways, yeah, you know, they're preparing to start having us out there.

[21:49] Joe Balser and Josh and the rest of the guys, they were at the show at the time that we

[21:53] went because we went early one morning.

[21:56] But basically they just, DeVal wanted to show us, you know, around basically, you know,

[22:01] we actually are ramping up to try and do production on these games and we've got a real

[22:06] facility.

[22:07] We've got a real development going on.

[22:09] But the building is nice.

[22:11] It's not too large.

[22:13] I hesitate to even, you know, compare it to what Stern is just because of the scale of

[22:18] Stern.

[22:19] But basically they've got some office areas where they're doing all the development on

[22:23] the games up in the front.

[22:26] They've got a engineering area in a separate room off to the side of the highway and then

[22:33] they've got a larger highway where they've got their parts cage and it looks like they're

[22:38] going to be assembling the back boxes and stuff.

[22:41] Then in a separate room, kind of to the back right or back left corner of the building

[22:47] is basically where they've got the line set up to start building these games.

[22:53] They basically said that everything to start shipping these games by the end of November.

[23:00] I do think that that's possible, but I do think that they have some work left to do

[23:05] to get ramped up.

[23:07] The facility is really nice.

[23:10] They have spent a lot of money going in and cleaning everything up, freshly painted

[23:14] floors.

[23:15] A whole lot of brand new racks and equipment.

[23:19] Everything is brand new.

[23:21] Nothing looks used over from something else.

[23:25] They did have about, oh, I'd say six or seven cabinets on the line that have already

[23:30] been built.

[23:31] Turtle cabinets is building the cabinets for them.

[23:35] Then Mirko is doing the play fields and they had already got McCabness in, applied to

[23:42] the e-cows and everything and we're ready to kind of start rolling them down the lawn.

[23:49] The reason I think that they have a little ways to go still is that even though they've

[23:53] got test benches set up where they're going to be doing the wiring harnesses and stuff,

[23:58] they're not organized and really ready to go where those benches are.

[24:04] They don't have parts there ready to go.

[24:06] They haven't started putting any wiring harnesses together.

[24:09] But based on what they showed us in the parts cage, they do have all the stuff that they're

[24:15] going to need.

[24:16] They may be waiting on a few things, but I think that they've got a real streamlined

[24:23] operation set up so far.

[24:25] Did they, I guess one question I have too is how many employees were there?

[24:30] I know a lot of times when we see these startups and we saw a lot of videos when highway was

[24:36] showing us behind the scenes, there was never that many people.

[24:40] Are they fully staffed up to go into production or are they still looking to hire people?

[24:45] I think that they're still looking to hire people.

[24:48] Basically, the room where the main line is, there was nobody in.

[24:53] You basically have the rollers with the cab, slide them down the line, but they did have

[25:02] people stocking the parts area.

[25:04] They did have guys working in the engineering area testing mechs and they did have somebody

[25:13] working on getting play fields organized and stuff.

[25:18] I think I said they are ramping up, that's the term that we use a lot, especially with

[25:23] highway and stuff.

[25:24] They're not there.

[25:28] They definitely have some work to do to get going with them as much, but it's doable.

[25:33] I don't think that it's out of the question, but it doesn't look like a lived in totally

[25:37] working facility just yet.

[25:40] Right.

[25:41] They were saying possibly end of November.

[25:45] Did they give any indication of how many games they're looking to build monthly?

[25:53] They didn't say on a monthly basis, but they did tell us about it based on it based on

[26:00] it.

[26:01] I think they said that they were hoping to crank out about two games a day and ramping

[26:07] up to about ten games a day.

[26:09] But that would be over the course of the next month to get to that kind of an end.

[26:17] I think that that's possible to do today.

[26:20] I still think that's ten games a week.

[26:23] I don't know.

[26:25] I mean, I'm going to be cranking that out for the first few months at the very least.

[26:32] I think that there's going to be a lot of things going on.

[26:40] It's a very clean facility issue.

[26:45] Lake, you're breaking up on me a little bit.

[26:47] Are you getting a reception there?

[26:49] Oh.

[26:50] Yeah, yeah.

[26:51] I've got to get a reception.

[26:53] Okay.

[26:54] Are you using like your bed headset or just like talking to the phone?

[26:58] No, I'm just talking to the phone.

[27:00] Okay.

[27:02] I want to do you have like an iPhone or?

[27:05] No, it's an Android.

[27:07] Okay.

[27:08] Do you ever use like, do you have like an earbud with a mic or?

[27:14] I don't.

[27:15] No, I don't.

[27:16] And the only mic that I have is the USB 1.0 computer.

[27:21] Okay.

[27:22] Yeah, just talk.

[27:23] Yeah, I guess just talk.

[27:24] I think maybe if it goes really loud, it cuts a little bit.

[27:28] So you were saying and I'll edit the stuff that like cracks up.

[27:32] So you were saying they're looking to do two games a day, possibly.

[27:36] That would be 10 a week and ramp up to maybe 10 games a day over a period of eight months.

[27:41] Is that what you were saying?

[27:45] Probably, yeah, that didn't specifically say eight months, but they did alludes to getting the 10 games a day over the course of many months.

[27:53] They do not have walkie expectations of doing that immediately.

[27:58] They, I think that they really want to make sure that they've got their process worked out to where it's moving smoothly and they're not trying to piecemeal stuff together.

[28:09] Kind of like highway has done over a long period of time now.

[28:13] So I do feel like that they're being very smart and cautious about moving forward.

[28:19] And I don't they're going to over promise anything.

[28:23] Even mentioning they wanted to start the November.

[28:29] They admitted that it's possible that that may not happen, but that that's what their goal is right now.

[28:35] And you know, in all fairness, that was their goal back at TTF on the on bill.

[28:40] The game too.

[28:41] Right.

[28:43] Did they indicate when they ship what state the code of the game would be in?

[28:49] Yeah, Josh actually did mention that they expect the code to be 95 to probably 98% complete when the game ships.

[29:00] Wow, which is good.

[29:03] I mean, they've been I think the having code far along when you ship is probably the biggest advantage you can have to get buyers in because people are fed off with the weight of the game.

[29:17] We know who we're talking about there.

[29:21] So all right, well, Merck and pinball who do you think like the I was talking to another pinball fanatic all 200 of us on the planet.

[29:33] The what do you think they would they could sell annually of who do you need if you had a guess or their projection is total sales and then annual sales.

[29:44] You know, I think to be looking at a fleet.

[29:53] I'm more around.

[29:55] I'll miss games total total run.

[30:01] I do think they're going to do it just to get out in and.

[30:07] As I said, they want to establish a cutoff any sort and that's why they're not really doing like an LED or premium model.

[30:21] It's also an unlicensed theme basically due to time.

[30:27] So I don't think they really have a hard cutoff with a licensor.

[30:32] I'll say this, I do think that you and I both played Houdini at TVF and from March until now when they brought the games to X-Thome.

[30:44] There have been a lot of positive adjustments made to that game.

[30:47] They they seem to be listening to the people's feedback on the inside as well as the shows.

[30:54] There were concerns about the lower play field being really close and they.

[30:57] Going in and not only lightened up with the spotlight that you mentioned a few episodes ago,

[31:02] but they've also actually lightened the artwork itself up.

[31:05] So there's more contrast.

[31:06] They they added blue rubbers to the flipper bats to help make that stand out a little bit more.

[31:12] And then of course they had just the LCD.

[31:16] I definitely felt like the game had more going on to it and I think they did it just the geometry a little bit since March.

[31:23] So I feel like they want to get it right.

[31:27] Yeah, I think the changes look good.

[31:29] I cut when I covered Expo and in my recap.

[31:34] I thought every adjustment they made, what was definitely an improvement.

[31:39] I think they listened to feedback.

[31:40] I think the LCD screen moving that horizontally looks much better as a theater than it looked more like a cell phone sticking up before.

[31:50] I think the lighting is better.

[31:52] The you know they've improved the catapult success rate into the high 90s.

[32:01] You know, so I think for for me who Dini is a game that it's all about timing when they get this game out.

[32:11] Because a week from now, Stern is probably going to show us Guardians of the Galaxy.

[32:18] We've seen how good Pirates is.

[32:21] We have dialed in shipping.

[32:22] We have alien pinballs even shipping, right?

[32:25] It's like there are so many ways you can spend your money now.

[32:30] I think it's going to be critical for them to get this game out during the right window where people want something new.

[32:39] And there's nothing really brand new in box other than who Dini is shipping.

[32:46] Because I think if they go ahead to head with like a Guardians or something or trying to fulfill orders at the same time as a super hot theme, I think it could be difficult.

[32:56] Absolutely.

[32:57] Yeah.

[32:58] I think they've got at least got a little bit of buffer before Pirates of Caribbean comes out.

[33:04] Because I honestly don't expect that game to start shipping until probably close to TPS next year.

[33:09] But it's a very different game than the stars being put out there.

[33:17] I think that there seems to be more to who Dini in terms of originality of shots and stuff than they're even as on Star Wars 2.

[33:26] And I think in terms of theme integration, it's probably stronger as well.

[33:31] It's kind of odd because I'm talking to a lot of people at Expo and people that were at TPS.

[33:37] The people that are interested in Dini are not necessarily seem to be interested in some of the other offerings that are out there right now.

[33:44] I mean they seem to really gravitate towards the game.

[33:47] I think that families have seemed to really like it a lot so far.

[33:52] And I don't really get the impression the American Pinball guys are honestly to do concerned about some of the other options out there right now.

[34:02] Right. Well, I mean like it seems to me like a modern day theater of magic right.

[34:07] I mean look at this game came from John Papaduke.

[34:11] I mean he's his dream theme.

[34:13] Him witnessing who Dini coming out and not being a J-pop game is a fitting punishment for his bad business acumen.

[34:24] I think you're right though. I think original themes that are fun.

[34:27] But look who Dini thought in a regional theme it is a well known historical figure who's who's tied to magic.

[34:34] And I think magic we talk so much about magic and pinball needing to come together to make a special pinball experience.

[34:41] This is like literally that kind of theme.

[34:44] And I think there's there's I think it comes down to one thing.

[34:48] I think I was talking to someone about Batman today.

[34:51] Maybe it was you Blake.

[34:52] I think it was you.

[34:53] There there needs to be a wow shot in a game.

[34:59] The ball needs to do something that makes you go wow.

[35:01] It doesn't have it in Batman 66.

[35:04] Questionably that questionably might not have it in Star Wars if you think maybe the hyperdrive is a wow moment.

[35:10] But that catapult in Houdini is is a holy cow.

[35:14] Well, I've never seen a ball fire that far across a playfield before in the history of pinball.

[35:18] Is there another game that does it that far?

[35:20] I don't think so.

[35:23] I guess technically taxi has a catapult on the Westhand side of the playfield because Mark Richie more or less developed that mechanism.

[35:33] And that's what's being used by American pinball.

[35:35] But that wasn't like a mid air shot.

[35:41] It was within a wire form.

[35:43] Yeah, I mean, medieval madness has them at the wire form catapult.

[35:47] Right.

[35:47] Exactly.

[35:48] But mid air is in amazing.

[35:51] Oh, yeah, absolutely.

[35:53] I mean, I think that I think that that's a really great shot that's kind of equivalent to the the magnet on the truck on the inner magic, you know, grabbing that ball right off the playfield.

[36:04] Wherever you shoot at it.

[36:05] You know, it's pretty cool shot as well.

[36:08] So I give them props for, you know, trying something really different and

[36:14] making sure that they had good theme integration and at least had one wild shot to it.

[36:19] That can't be said about all games that are out there.

[36:23] I am curious if you look at John Papa Dukes who's Dini design and you look at the Joe Balls or design.

[36:32] Was that catapult in John's design?

[36:36] Because it looks like it was, but I highly doubt John had it engineered and figured out.

[36:41] But I wonder where the that idea origin into from and I've been like I've been trying to get Josh Kugler and Joe Balls or on this show now for months.

[36:53] Joe will tell you, no, no, Josh will tell you that Joe keeps like stalling on coming on.

[37:00] So Joe, if you don't want me miscrediting your design and some of the features come on the show.

[37:08] Let's clarify all the elements of who Dini but I think the price point at what it's $7,000 right.

[37:15] Right. Yeah, I mean it's like it's very competitive.

[37:19] Crazy that we're saying that now because it's it is.

[37:23] I mean, but it's it's interesting because $7,000 it's definitely much more jam packed than a Stern pro.

[37:31] So right there it is competitively priced because once you jump up to a Stern premium,

[37:37] you're talking what $7,500, $7,600 bucks for a premium now.

[37:42] Yeah, that's I think that's going right.

[37:46] I mean, there's more in who Dini then is in Star Wars.

[37:50] So I just think it looks like a solid game.

[37:53] My big issue with it and you played it at Expo.

[37:55] Like how did it shoot?

[37:56] Because I always felt the game was some of those shots just are so damn tight and my biggest concern

[38:03] is that when you play theater of magic, there's no tight shots.

[38:08] No, no, it's smooth. It's a really smooth game.

[38:12] You feel like even if you hit a crappy shot, you've got a pretty strong chance of still completing

[38:17] some sort of shots successfully.

[38:20] Also, this is about who Dini, you know, when I played at TPS, I agree that I thought the shots

[38:26] were incredibly tight. In fact, you know, I was breaking the ball against some of those

[38:31] stand-up posts alongside the ramps and the orbits quite frequently.

[38:35] I played it a lot more at Expo and I do think that they've maybe tweaked a little bit,

[38:42] just a little bit of the openings, but they are still tight shots.

[38:46] Now with that said, I didn't have any trouble hitting it.

[38:50] Maybe I was just having an on-day versus, you know, the day at TPS.

[38:54] But I actually put the Grand Champs score on the game that I played at Expo and it played great.

[39:03] I mean, it held up really, really well and I got to say that I felt like the build quality

[39:09] was better on that game than it is on Alien. I mean, it just felt more solid. It felt like

[39:15] the shots were a lot smoother and even if you missed a shot, you felt like you kind of get it

[39:22] back and you weren't totally punished by it.

[39:26] A question I have about the game in the gameplay. So,

[39:29] Theater of Magic, you've got that Magic trunk to just bash in Tales of the Arabian Nights,

[39:36] you've got the Genie to bash. You know, John always had that like singular item that you do hit.

[39:43] In this game, is there like something to bash or shoot for? Do you hit that Theater where

[39:49] the LCD is above like, what's the, if I just walk up to you? Yeah. What's the shot I want to keep

[39:54] hitting? I think that people are going to gravitate without knowing anything about the game

[40:01] to hitting that Theater shot because it's right at the middle. It's not too dangerous of a shot

[40:06] in terms of if you hit it, the ball's not going to come straight back down the middle. I see

[40:11] you can recover it. I do think people are going to be a little confused about how do they get the

[40:16] ball over to the cannon to launch it into the truck. You know, that's not crystal clear.

[40:24] However, I kind of have a tendency with these new games that have LCDs to not pay a whole lot

[40:29] of attention to the LCD. So, it's quite possible that the rules will lay out quite clearly if you're

[40:36] paying attention to the screen. How do you think? Do you know how to get it in there now after playing?

[40:41] Not entirely. I'll take that as a note.

[40:53] You basically hit it up the ramp and it comes back down around and gets diverted into the

[41:00] into the cannon itself. But I'm not 100% sure. I think when I hit it, I was in the middle of a

[41:06] multi-ball and there was a lot of sorts of stuff happening. I still think in so many modern games,

[41:14] what they don't have is that Genie Shot or the Magic Trunk Shop. Because I think what John

[41:21] always figured out is if you just put something that is pretty intuitive, I need to hit here.

[41:29] And then something magical happens there. The Genie had the disappearing magnet that trunk would

[41:33] spin around and grab the ball or the magnet that the ball would stick to the side of the trunk.

[41:39] Everything revolved around this really singular mechanism and this is not just a knock on Houdini.

[41:45] When I look at all these modern pinball machines, I think a lot of them you walk up to and you're not

[41:50] really sure what's the main thing that will interact with the ball and do awesome things.

[41:57] And if I just hit this, I'll have a good time. I'll have medieval madness castle. But that's just

[42:01] me digressing on modern pinball design. All right, so you played Houdini, you say it shoots a little

[42:07] bit better. We're thinking later November, we'll see where this goes. I think it's going to be

[42:13] really interesting having this company come out of nowhere and drop another machine into the marketplace.

[42:19] Let's talk about Pirates, because that stole the show at Expo. You were there. What was the vibe like

[42:26] when Jack revealed Pirates? It was, well, you've heard a lot of people say this, but it was a

[42:32] complete 180 of the reveal last year. I think that a lot of us were expecting God in to get revealed.

[42:39] We were kind of hoping that that wasn't the theme and then all of a sudden, yep, sure enough it was.

[42:45] Pirates on the other hand, we also knew that was the theme going into this, but I think the

[42:50] difference is that people were just blown away by such a different interpretation of that theme

[42:57] compared to what Stern had done. And it don't be wrong. Stern made a really great Pirates game.

[43:01] I think the thinking ship is as long as coolest mechs they've ever put it in the chain.

[43:07] But what Eric did with Pirates was just truly impressive. It felt like that world

[43:15] under glass that we've been missing on some of the recent games. Even though I know a lot of people

[43:21] that have the hobby, I like the hobby and it's got beautiful art and stuff, I never felt like

[43:26] that was a true world under glass representing the film series. But with Pirates on the other hand,

[43:33] I actually kind of ignored the artwork more and I was so mesmerized by shots and the mechanisms

[43:39] that to me it felt more like parts of the Caribbean, the ride and not just the movies.

[43:44] And it really just had that spirit of getting on that boat and riding the ride at Disney World.

[43:51] And I got to say I was blown away by it. I couldn't believe it because I was kind of down on

[43:59] them doing that theme again, especially since it's been done. But man, talk about really

[44:06] opening everybody's eyes and showing that there is more you can do with some of these things than

[44:10] what's been done before. Right, I think unanimously we all went in with a lot of skepticism around

[44:19] a theme we know. I think we all feel it's pretty, pretty long-winded theme. I think the hype and

[44:25] the relevancy has died down. But I think this game sort of showed if you make the pinball amazing,

[44:32] nobody really cares the last two movies or three movies were kind of shit.

[44:37] How did it play in terms of speed? Because my whole issue with wide bodies is always they feel

[44:42] floaty and slow. Did it feel like it played faster than the Hobbit or was? Yeah, I've been really

[44:50] critical of the speed or Hobbit and was. I just feel like there's just not enough going on to

[44:56] keep you on your toes with those names. Pirates is the complete opposite. You feel like you were

[45:00] playing a standard body game. Even though there's a lot of stuff on the play field and there's a lot

[45:09] that can be, you know, can kind of divert the ball around. It never really lost speed. But you also

[45:18] weren't dealing with a fast game like Star Wars where you could barely keep control of the ball,

[45:23] you're flailing around and you can't set up your next shot. So I felt like it was very easy to get

[45:30] it up the right ramp and the rocking ship. That's a very steep ramp actually, kind of like Ghostbusters.

[45:37] But it was an easy shot. Once you got the ball there, it actually wasn't that hard to keep it up

[45:42] there, but it did require some challenge and some skill to keep it up top. I think the left ramp

[45:49] around the whirlpools is really cool, a very easy shot as well. I'd say the toughest shot that I

[45:55] found on the game was when you open up the chest, David Jones's chest in the middle of the play field

[46:01] in the back to lock the balls. That's a physical ball lock and the main shot that's underneath that

[46:07] chest is basically a vertical U-turn shot. Similar to what we've seen on my Felt from the

[46:14] Cript or even Alien has a shot like that. And you've got to have some pretty good momentum and you

[46:20] got to hit that thing dead on to get it up into that trunk because that's one of the farthest

[46:25] shots away from the flippers. And it's not that easy to hit it with the upper left flipper.

[46:32] It could be possible if you ricochet it off the right thing, but you basically need to hit it

[46:37] from the lower left flipper. So lower left to your back handing it up there or the right flipper can also?

[46:46] You know, it actually felt pretty comfortable to do it both ways because the angle, the angle

[46:51] of where that chest is, it's almost dead center in the back of the play field. So it felt pretty

[46:57] equal to shoot it from the left to right flipper. The only reason I say the left flipper is because

[47:04] the right ramp sticks out a little bit more and it doesn't feel like quite as clean as shot

[47:10] from the right flipper. But it is very makeable on both sides.

[47:15] How are the three concentric discs? How did you feel about those?

[47:24] I got a kick out of how the tournament players can play in about those things because

[47:29] yeah, they randomize the hell out of the ball and it's awesome. You have to be on your toes

[47:34] when the ball gets down to the lower part of the play field because it'll either send it to the

[47:41] back part of your flipper and up the inline or it'll center right down the middle. But it wasn't so brutal

[47:47] that you know it was immediately fun getting into the out lanes or right down the middle. It gave

[47:52] you a pretty good chance of capturing the ball and stopping it. So it was really great. It was a good

[48:00] deflection that adds a lot to the game but it doesn't create a brutal game.

[48:08] And was the compass on the apron? Was that coded yet? Was that utilized in the current code that you played?

[48:17] Yeah. So basically the the arrow, the compass is supposed to represent Jack Sparrow's compass which

[48:25] always points towards towards whatever you desire in the in the story. So it will allow you to kind of

[48:35] pick which skill shot you want to aim towards. There's a series of lights over by the shooter lane

[48:42] that rotate through and they highlight different skill shots and depending on which light is

[48:49] loaded up that arrow is going to wobble a little bit. And it tells you, you know, let's say you're

[48:55] aiming for the first light, you might need the aim up the middle of the play field or over to the right.

[49:01] So it's actually a pretty cool little feature. Is it used for skill shot only right now?

[49:05] Does it also activate during modes? You know as far as I could tell it was just for the skill shot

[49:12] right now. It's quite possible that it was doing more than that but I wasn't paying a whole

[49:18] lot of attention to it beyond skill shot. I do I would not be surprised if they program it to do other

[49:24] stuff. How did you feel about the lack of movie clips and you know no Johnny Dapp? Like do you feel like

[49:34] that was glaring a mission or you didn't really mind it? I honestly didn't mind it and considering

[49:43] I've been critical of Alien not having so many weaver in it. The games just got so much personality

[49:50] in the shots and the toys and the mechanisms that you don't even really notice that you're not

[49:56] getting these these clips. There weren't a whole lot of callouts that I heard yet. I think that's

[50:01] something that they're definitely going to be working on. But it didn't bother me honestly. I think

[50:07] it was because so much of the rest of the game had personality that I didn't miss seeing

[50:14] playback clips. I actually thought that it was kind of overkill in the hobby and I think it's

[50:19] overkill in Star Wars 2. So I'm really glad that they kind of let their own custom animation work

[50:27] do the talking on the screen. I keep hearing from more and more people and you know as much as LCD

[50:33] is being pushed out onto us as like the next evolution of pinball you can't see the screen when

[50:40] you're playing pinball. I even heard someone tell me like they've got the pirate map and they

[50:46] didn't even like really care nor have time to look at what's going on up there while you're playing

[50:54] the game. So it's an interesting thing as cool as it is to spectate when you see some of those clips

[51:00] unless you really utilize the LCD in a very simple almost like a DMD like way it's kind of pointless

[51:09] to have too much going on up there. Yeah the pirate map looks really cool. I mean everything

[51:16] you know was beautifully rendered and I'll get Jersey Jet credit credit because they've always

[51:21] done a really great job coming up with custom animation screens and transitions and stuff.

[51:26] My understanding is that the pirate map is supposed to work kind of like you know it's super Mario

[51:33] Brothers where you've got the world maps and you jump from level to level that's kind of what

[51:38] the pirate map is supposed to be like. I don't know that it was fully programmed yet

[51:44] but that's a cool concept. The only thing is that I still didn't find myself looking up there

[51:49] you know. Yeah it's it's just like you just you can't it's just not you can't play a game that

[51:57] you're staring down at and keep glancing up it's you know like the DMD the amount of time you

[52:02] would glance at DMD's there's decades of pinball playing that landed there as being just the right

[52:10] amount of what you need to see to get back to the game below you. So I think everyone's still

[52:16] figuring it out. I think some Jersey Jet games have overkill. I think Stern has no clue what

[52:22] they're doing on some of the recent games. I think Star Wars is a convoluted mess up there that

[52:27] come on you can't over-display stuff you got to make it simpler. All right so Pirates is a hit.

[52:34] Now I've been trying to figure out and I'm curious what your opinion is. Is this new model of

[52:42] showing games six months early? Is it the right thing to do to create the hype that Jack needs when

[52:50] the game is finally available? You know or does it just freeze money in the market? I really think

[52:59] that I think it's going to freeze a little bit of money in the market but at the same time I do

[53:04] feel like it's maybe a little too soon to the degree because you know I'll give Stern credit for

[53:11] being able to reveal a game and you know that they're going to be shipping within about three or four

[53:15] weeks of the reveal. I do think that Jack felt confident enough that this is a very strong game

[53:23] which it is. I think it's going to be a very successful game for them that they could reveal

[53:27] it ahead of time and get people start saving up. But you know how people are in this community and

[53:33] they do kind of get bored quickly in terms of if their money is being held for a while

[53:42] and something else that's really well done comes out. They kind of are impulsive about wanting

[53:47] to jump onto that other train because it's the new thing. It's not being talked about. Pirates

[53:54] won't be talked about as much when Stern and Jack comes out. So I do think that there's a

[54:01] downside to revealing too soon. I think that maybe part of what Jack is doing is really trying

[54:08] to establish that hey we we're here to stay. We are major players in the industry and we had a

[54:15] rough first few years cranking things out but now they've kind of got a rhythm. Well let's be honest

[54:22] because I know you are Stern Pimbal would have released two consumers pirates of the Caribbean

[54:31] in its current state in its current code state. It's called Batman 66.

[54:40] They would have no problem getting the game into your home and making you wait a year to for

[54:44] finish code. I think Jack's approach the pros are this. The game's out. He can now work on it, tweak it,

[54:54] get feedback, hear from people, put it on location, have people test it, work on stuff without having

[55:00] to worry about keeping it a secret so that he can spend six months refining it so by the time

[55:05] it comes out games near perfect. The downside is what we... Yeah go on. Oh well I was just going to say

[55:13] that I think that that is going to go along the ways with people right now considering the quality

[55:18] issues that we're saying with not just Stern games but now we're starting to see quality issues with

[55:24] alien. I don't know if you've been paying attention to the evening but alien reading the thread.

[55:28] Oh it is. It's like pros solution. It is exactly and so I think that even though Jack's revealing these

[55:35] games what say five months ahead of time it's going to go a long ways for people knowing that if

[55:43] they're going to spend that much money that they are going to get a quality product that's not going

[55:47] to have any major issues. They've got that piece of mind because it's fantastic. I mean let's just

[55:53] face it right. Any issue, any glaring issue with your new expensive Pimble machine creates headache,

[56:00] creates sleepless nights and it's just frustrating. Nobody wants to have to deal with issues when

[56:06] you open up a new unboxed machine and having a lack of code is a major, major issue for a lot of

[56:12] people and I understand why. So the con to releasing early obviously is the hype. It's hard to

[56:20] drum it up again. I don't I think pirates will be a little bit immune to that. I think people will

[56:24] still be excited to get it because of how deep the game is right. I mean Keith is going to make this

[56:30] thing one of the deepest codes sets he's ever had with like what's got like 125 different modes

[56:38] and it randomizes 25 each time you play so you're you're never going to have the same games twice.

[56:43] I think you know there's a lot of first that this thing is doing you know with this game so

[56:49] I think people are really excited about Jersey Jack machines because he's pushing the envelope where

[56:56] you know I'm not so sure Stern is and speaking of Stern now you were at Expo Blake and Stern had

[57:02] the complete opposite response to people who saw them in Expo they didn't have anything new.

[57:07] They seemed like they were on the defensive. They seemed like they were you know sort of making

[57:12] excuses. What was it what was the vibe like when it came to Stern at Expo?

[57:18] You know they were around the show itself and of course on the factory tour but personally I found

[57:25] it more exciting that they had their three most talented artists there to find things right next to

[57:31] where they had all their machines back up versus the machines that were actually there. I mean

[57:36] people that were playing on the Stern machine they seem to be having a good time but I don't

[57:40] know everybody had already seen all that stuff or even the Batman code that was updated on those

[57:44] games hell I couldn't really tell the difference is honestly and I'm I'm sure they were there but

[57:51] other than if you call out some new animation I couldn't tell a huge difference.

[57:56] Now do you think this is a long awaited Batman update because that's the big rumor is that like

[58:02] you know maybe Lyman can't knock it out of the park this time and it's not coming along the way

[58:08] people expect. I just don't understand how you can't knock it out of the park with this theme.

[58:15] You know Batman 66 is a fantastic theme for pin mulching and they have enough set up there

[58:24] between the main villains and then all the sub-billains that you would think that you can make quite

[58:30] a deep rule set and really change it up. I think maybe part of the challenge is that there aren't

[58:37] a ton of shots on the game honestly. You know how do you how do you make so many different

[58:42] combinations of things to do when you don't have quite as much to shoot at like you do on Pirates of

[58:48] Chervian. I personally I don't feel like that Lyman's having trouble with the game. I just

[58:55] feel like the guy seems to be ever worked. I just think that there's just so much going on.

[59:00] So you don't think he's solely working on Batman which is what George Gomez keeps telling us.

[59:06] I highly doubt it because they don't have that many coders. I don't see how he could just

[59:12] solely be working on that game and when they've got on average four to five other games in

[59:18] development at the given time. You know. Right. I mean the rumor is he's working on O'Vira.

[59:26] Yeah. I think you saw a pirate that's going to be built by Stern. You've got another

[59:31] capital title that's going to be built by Stern. And those aren't even the three cornerstone

[59:36] games I don't think for the calendar year. Right. Well look a week from now when Stern shows

[59:45] Gardens of the Galaxy it's going to be a very pivotal game for Stern and I've been saying it

[59:52] on the show. It's a theme people love. It's a theme that they want to see integrated amazingly

[59:58] well into a pinball machine. And I think Stern is at this crossroads where they need to make a

[01:00:04] game that looks like it's worth $9,000 if you're going to ask me for $9,000. That's right. I absolutely

[01:00:11] agree with that. And you know you could I saw a number of Stern guys looking at Pirates over that

[01:00:19] weekend and you could tell that they were impressed with what they were saying that you know there was

[01:00:26] this fresh blood and this new designer being shown up the show and that things don't always have

[01:00:33] to just be the same old family out so we're in over. Right. I mean think about like this. If you're a

[01:00:38] Stern designer, if you're John Borg, if you're why am I losing like touch with my designers?

[01:00:45] If you're who's designer? So you got keep that one now you got John Borg. Steve George Gomez.

[01:00:55] George Gomez. He's taking over to this game. Well here's the thing. He's personally, if I was a

[01:01:04] designer though at Stern and I looked at Pirates, I would want to submit my resume to Jersey Jack

[01:01:14] and have them make my next game. I mean a designer wants to be able to design with all the bells

[01:01:20] and whistles and and make a game absolutely incredible. Hold on. Bubba, Bubba, what are you doing?

[01:01:26] What? Bubba isn't like heat right now just like trying what do you want? What do you want?

[01:01:32] I want to talk to the podcast. I want to make your podcast intro. Come on. Say something Bubba. Bubba.

[01:01:40] Bubba, what's going on? Oh my god. Brenna sleep. I don't know if you have to go out.

[01:01:45] Do you want some water? Here, come on. He's been very feisty and I'm not going to edit this part out.

[01:01:55] Anyway, if I'm a Stern designer, I don't know. I would want to go somewhere where my passion and

[01:02:05] the things I want to put into a game aren't compromised because we're designing to a price point.

[01:02:11] I think that's the that's what people are feeling like that Stern's just the

[01:02:17] the profit driven nature of Stern is is is creating a product that's not maximized in these themes

[01:02:26] potentials and and and I think Guardians is a game where we want to feel like blown away by it.

[01:02:33] Even when I look at like the walking dead now, like how how how how how full featured walking

[01:02:38] dead feels compared to like Star Wars? Oh, yeah. I mean, I was not very fond of walking dead

[01:02:46] when it first came out, but I I absolutely love that game now. I mean, I think it's a really

[01:02:51] well done game and I really felt like bored did something very different with that game compared

[01:02:58] to all the other titles that are out there. But at the time it came out and even compared to

[01:03:03] what Stern's come out with since, you know, I feel like I feel like a difference for seeing

[01:03:11] here is that yeah, Stern is definitely concerned about the bottom dollar and I sense that some of

[01:03:16] these designers are frustrated that they can't do everything that they may have some great ideas

[01:03:23] about with these games because of the budgets. You know, Jericie Jack might be able to get away with

[01:03:28] that because they're only doing one or two games. So they don't have budget going towards

[01:03:33] three cornerstone games being that are being released that year plus development of let's say two

[01:03:38] or three more games for future years. Back in the 80s and 90s, all these designers were competing

[01:03:46] with each other for creativity. They were competing for people's quarters on location and it wasn't

[01:03:52] about how cheap can we make this game. It was about how could we want to the next guy over there.

[01:03:57] And that's why I think we saw a lot of innovative things get done back. And now it's just, I don't

[01:04:05] feel like that driver there. Right. No, I think that's like the ultimate point is when you're trying

[01:04:13] to make the best pinball machine that's in an arcade and steal the thunder, right? These guys

[01:04:20] were all competing against each other for notoriety, for sales, for just like the accolades of

[01:04:27] you know, I made the pinball machine that moved 10,000 units, 15,000 units. You know, the passion

[01:04:34] created the profit, right? Now it's like the profit is killing the passion at Stern. And it's like

[01:04:44] completely opposite effect. All right. So Stern was lame duck. They were lame duck at Expo.

[01:04:49] Everyone knows that they're going to make an announcement in the next couple of weeks of

[01:04:54] Guardians. So we'll see what happens there. It's not even I will obviously have you back on

[01:04:59] Blake when we see Guardians. It'll be a whole nother wave of excitement and disappointment

[01:05:05] like all Stern releases when they show the game. They will cover it all.

[01:05:09] Before Chris Franchise, I talked to him about it at the show and he's definitely very excited about

[01:05:14] the game. I think he was very disappointed considering he came in the Chicago from Detroit,

[01:05:21] was there and did not get a chance to talk about his brand new game that's going to be released

[01:05:26] in a week and a half to two week anyways. You know, so I think he was kind of bummed about that.

[01:05:31] And I would be too honestly. I think someone also stole his artwork. I think I said, was that him?

[01:05:37] Yeah, somebody also stole a number of prints off of his table unfortunately.

[01:05:43] But he and I, we hung out quite a bit at the show and we had a great time.

[01:05:49] Had a really nice visit. Chris is a really good guy and he's definitely passionate about

[01:05:56] doing this stuff the right way just like, you know, zombie Eddie is and even 35.

[01:06:01] Right. Yeah, I mean, it hasn't been confirmed that he's doing Guardians.

[01:06:06] We just assume that's the case. For my conversations with Chris, I know he is bummed out that

[01:06:13] that his game just won't get the spotlight reveal that it deserved. And I know when he talks

[01:06:20] about the art, what excites me is he's talking about how every inch of the play field he filled

[01:06:26] with so much detail, which excites me because if there's one knock I have against pirates,

[01:06:31] is when you do look at the artwork, there's just so much lack of detail when you look at the

[01:06:37] play field. It's like the characters are there and they're so close to looking Photoshop that they

[01:06:42] even though it's hand drawn, it still looks Photoshop drag and drop. And there's not like a lot of

[01:06:48] detail in the artwork. And I think she's going to do the complete opposite with Guardians.

[01:06:54] What about, so Alien wasn't there now. That was a big mission for them not to have a presence.

[01:07:01] So let me, yeah, I've actually got an interesting story about that. I found out why they were out there.

[01:07:08] So Highway had flown two Alien games over to Chicago to have them there in time for the

[01:07:15] extra coin taker was going to receive. Well, it turns out by Friday night, Melissa with coin taker

[01:07:24] found out that the machines were at Chicago here sitting there waiting to be picked up. However,

[01:07:32] Customs were not released because apparently Highway forgot to fill out one of the forms that was needed.

[01:07:37] So Alien was in Chicago ready for the show and not able to get to the show. They just sat at the

[01:07:44] airport the whole. Great job Highway Pimball. Once again, showing us how it's done in the world of

[01:07:52] business. Well, look, not at the games are out and they're shipping. They were having there.

[01:07:58] Now that the games are out and they are shipping, we're seeing the initial batch of games are having

[01:08:04] issues. What, like, what are the issues you've been reading on Pinside that owners are experiencing

[01:08:08] with these machines? Now that they're getting them. Well, so I guess the, yeah, the 21 units that came

[01:08:13] in on Friday were supposed to have the additional fully populated playfields for a handful of the

[01:08:21] machines that have been pre-sought. So my buddy Brad here in Houston, he's got one of them, you know,

[01:08:26] Helden's got one of them and there are a few others elsewhere that needed to be replaced.

[01:08:33] And of course, none of the parts or playfields were on this shipment of games.

[01:08:39] And then, you know, turns out tonight, people were reporting that games that have only been

[01:08:44] open for three days that LCD is going out on them or the lighting on the fruits or something like that.

[01:08:50] Right. I see like people are having problems with like the back box lighting too. And

[01:08:55] so these games are not arriving bulletproof. And I think the expectation was when Andrew was

[01:09:03] booted, these guys took over ownership in May, June, that all the time they had to work out the

[01:09:10] kinks would have resulted in a more of a trouble free game. I think what's more troublesome though,

[01:09:16] or problematic, is the original buyers still don't have their new playfields, right? And even more

[01:09:24] worrisome is that the LE owners, right, the LE buyers who were the first ones to support this game,

[01:09:31] they don't even have an indication of when they're going to get their machine or what the LE even is.

[01:09:38] Right. Now, it's a bad situation with this company and I think the people that own these

[01:09:44] games already, they've accepted the fact that basically they've got a pre-production model game.

[01:09:50] And they've accepted that they've got issues, but they also expect that those issues are going to

[01:09:56] be resolved and honored by highway. And once again, the new regime over there just seems to be

[01:10:02] concerned about new money keeping the lights on. Same thing that Andrew was doing the whole time,

[01:10:08] and they're leaving these people that are out to drive. Now, we got 21 games that came over

[01:10:13] your state side, plus another handful of them went to what's sweet and I think.

[01:10:19] If these games have issues, now you're talking about not just five to ten people that had games

[01:10:26] with issues. Now you're talking about 30 to 40 games that have issues. I mean, that's really bad.

[01:10:33] Right. Support and future support seems to be a big concern.

[01:10:39] And you know, look, I mean, we've been trying to sort of do my best not to

[01:10:46] negatively harp on this company, but I just still think that the problem is they've

[01:10:53] inherited the issues that Andrew created and they haven't fixed it because they can't redesign

[01:11:01] this game. They were given a bag of goods and the bag is not that good. And

[01:11:07] I literally think they should have just like gone back to the drawing board, gone away,

[01:11:14] come back with a whole new version of the game that didn't carry over a lot of the problems

[01:11:20] that just went into the initial design, but they're stuck. They're stuck in this really bad place.

[01:11:25] And the last point I'll make is not everyone who has asked for a refund has received it yet.

[01:11:32] And that's, to me, that's like the ultimate telltale sign. It's like they literally wanted

[01:11:37] to get games out to keep people from bailing. And that was Andrew's strategy from the very beginning

[01:11:44] when he started selling games to guys like Brad and that, you know, our friend down in Florida

[01:11:49] who had one who got the first Ellie. Remember that first Ellie bullshit?

[01:11:54] Right.

[01:11:55] You know, it's like, it's all catching up to them. And I do believe in karma. And I really think

[01:12:00] that highway is going to struggle to ever get to another game. I do. I think I think with,

[01:12:06] I don't doubt that the cards that Andrew dealt with these new investors were probably worse than

[01:12:11] what they expected because he was so good about, you know, lying to people's faces and making

[01:12:19] things seem like they were all wine and roses when they really weren't. So I kind of sympathize

[01:12:25] with these new guys from that standpoint. They probably had a lot more crap to deal with than

[01:12:30] what they anticipated. But on that same note, there's no excuse for them coming out and being honest

[01:12:35] with everybody and saying, this quality is not up to the standard that we want to have moving forward.

[01:12:42] There are engineering issues with this game that need to be resolved. And, you know, we're going

[01:12:48] to have to delay this. I agree with you. They should not. But they're not even speaking, they're not

[01:12:52] even speaking at all. They're just silent investors. Right. No, it's horrible. It's really bad. I

[01:13:02] mean, and I can tell you, you know, Brad has been more than patient with these guys. And he's been

[01:13:10] very fair about giving them a chance to get these cards. And it's like, what's so hard about getting

[01:13:15] these cards, you know? So I just think that they're still struggling. They're still trying to get

[01:13:21] new money. And man, if I was a pre-order and I saw these 21 games come in and they went to new

[01:13:27] buyers, I'd be pissed. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, if I was an Ellie buyer and I'm like, these

[01:13:34] these new money SE owners are getting their games before me, I would get my money back immediately,

[01:13:40] especially because you don't even know what the Ellie is. I would just wait. They're not sold out.

[01:13:44] They never will sell out. They never will be in Ellie. They don't have any idea what to put into it.

[01:13:49] All right. Well, because I want to keep this within an hour, a few more things I want to cover.

[01:13:53] Blake, so did you go to the Dutch pinball seminar? Did you hear them talk?

[01:13:59] Yeah, I actually did sit in. I'm probably the first 15 minutes of it. Basically, just to get the

[01:14:04] the gist of where he op was going to go with everything. And I just sounded like a broken record.

[01:14:09] It was the same thing as what he said at TPS, basically. Except this time, they've admitted that,

[01:14:14] you know, they've got this new contract manufacturer in China. So I guess that was really the only

[01:14:20] bit of news, but this does not sound like that game is going to get made anytime soon. I don't think

[01:14:27] these people are going to get their games. I mean, carbonally within the next six months, probably.

[01:14:34] I mean, there were really not even that people playing a big clubowski that was at the

[01:14:38] coin. They were ultimately admitting a pyramid scheme business model to survive, which is a proven

[01:14:50] failed the business model. We've been calling this company since day one as being incapable of

[01:14:58] getting this thing back on track. To this day, I still don't understand why they didn't just

[01:15:04] raise the price of the game to satisfy what ARA was saying. It would cost to make each unit.

[01:15:10] If it was 10 grand, if it was 11 grand, heck, if it was 12 grand, just tell people, this is what it

[01:15:16] costs. We're sorry we underestimated. And everyone would be playing their big Lebowski's. But,

[01:15:24] you know, it's not going to work out. It's just not going to work out. But you can't run the numbers

[01:15:30] and see how it's going to work out. And when Yop talks about it, he's like, yeah, we know this is not

[01:15:35] ideal, but it's the only solution we could think of. Like, does that sound like a company you want

[01:15:41] to invest in? No, I mean, you know, I honestly, at these last couple seminars that I've sat through

[01:15:49] with these guys, Yop gets up there and he tries to be humorous and snarky and sugarcoat everything

[01:15:56] in a very sarcastic way while Barry just kind of sits there and just lets him go. And I almost

[01:16:03] feel like that these two guys are not even saying hi to I on this stuff. I mean, I think they're just so

[01:16:10] far in deep on this mess now that that I don't know what they're going to do to try to get out of it

[01:16:17] because I'm not convinced that they're going to be able to do these games built in China.

[01:16:21] It will remind them they're having to turn read near all these parts to make this game.

[01:16:27] Now, it's a whole other set of parts that are going to have to be tested and fail. And there

[01:16:33] will be more issues with that. No, it's unbelievable. You know what they need to do? They need to get

[01:16:40] Hilton on board to chill for the game because he can keep a dead project going for years with all his

[01:16:48] you know his votes of confidence in in highway pinball and in skippy. You know, they need

[01:16:54] they need him on board. They they they get another another two years at least of being convinced

[01:16:59] it's going to work out. Now, look, I think what Expo showed us Blake and I think where we're at

[01:17:06] in this whole hobby. There are real games and there are fake games. There are real manufacturers

[01:17:12] and there are jokes out there and it's it's so easy now easier than ever to see which companies

[01:17:19] are real and which companies are just trying to like figure it out. And if you have money,

[01:17:24] you're hard earned cash for these expensive toys only by a game that's in a box and will be

[01:17:31] shipped to you and you're not going to miss out on anything anymore. Like they make enough of all

[01:17:36] these games where if you want it, you don't have to go in early and take a leap of faith. Like this

[01:17:41] is all carryover from like circa 2014, 2015 tactics. I mean, all these kinds of owning an

[01:17:51] exclusive game I think has has died quite a bit. You know, I think it died some star wars because

[01:17:59] the little face of the led just doesn't live up to the press tag. It died with Batman 66, son.

[01:18:05] And then Jack dug himself a hole where he keeps relief and releasing some of the different versions

[01:18:10] of a game. You know, at least this time with pirates, he's admitted that yeah, we're probably still

[01:18:16] going to keep making this game as long as there's a man for it and I very well could release a whole

[01:18:21] nother version of it. Yeah, you know, the whole like limited hype is dead when people look back on

[01:18:29] Star Trek, Ellie with like extreme nostalgia. Like yeah, I get it, but it was still just a few things

[01:18:37] they put in that game, but it's no nowhere near this like, oh my god, like there is this sense of

[01:18:43] overwhelming pride and joy. And we're seeing it too with like ACDC Lucy. Those games used to be like

[01:18:49] an obtainedium rare Lucy. I've got one and now they're like coming way back down to Earth with

[01:18:55] pricing. I saw like pinball refinery couldn't even sell there is like sell for like 7,500. Those

[01:19:01] games used to sell for like 10 grand. Yeah, well, and I do wonder if the vault edition has had

[01:19:08] some effect on that in terms of ACDC. I think what it is, and I realized it's magic girl,

[01:19:14] eventually one day you wake up and you're like, you know what? I no longer want to collect pinball

[01:19:21] machines that only like 50 loser dudes in the world actually give a shit that I have one version

[01:19:27] of it like no one cares right nobody cares anymore. Just get the game you love. I mean, I think

[01:19:34] magic girl's beautiful work of art. I love it for what it is, but I don't care anymore like I don't

[01:19:39] nobody cares. Nobody really does care that I have a magic girl. And I don't care that people don't

[01:19:44] care. Like I just want pinball machines that I enjoy owning. And I think more and more people are

[01:19:49] realizing that they've been like raked over the coals for the past like three, four years in this

[01:19:54] whole led drive to get the latest hype like supreme version of it. And look at every Batman 66

[01:20:02] super early owner. Look how they feel right now. They feel worse than people who are like enjoying

[01:20:07] whitewood every day. Yeah, yeah, I mean 15 grand. I think that it really boils down to people realizing

[01:20:16] the most important thing here shouldn't be an etched number on a plaque, you know, well to be a

[01:20:22] machine. It should be how much fun is the game to play? What's the replayability of that game?

[01:20:29] Does it capture a spark of imagination, of excitement that these games should have? And you're right.

[01:20:37] There's nothing being added to these LEDs and all these exclusive versions that is doing that.

[01:20:43] You know, you can go get a standard parts to cure being and have equally as great of an experience

[01:20:50] on it as you're going to have with the Ellie and the collectors. So and while you have the same

[01:20:56] experience, I mean, the only difference in experience is just the visual pop you get with these

[01:21:03] extra like dressings. You know, it's like I was talking to someone about Star Wars Ellie because

[01:21:08] I've slammed the game for theme integration and all they could have done with Star Wars. And I

[01:21:13] read the thread and I read how people are like, this is the greatest turn ever. They got that one

[01:21:18] more ball. It's fast. It's fun. And I wouldn't just state for the record that I've never said that

[01:21:24] Star Wars isn't fun. Like pinball is fundamentally fun on on on a level. But a yo-yo is fun. But I'll pay

[01:21:34] five bucks for a yo-yo. I won't pay a hundred bucks. My point has always been for nine thousand

[01:21:40] dollars. Star Wars does not provide the value or integrate the theme the way it should. And it could

[01:21:47] have been much more fun than it is, especially for the money. But it doesn't mean you're, of course,

[01:21:53] you're going to have fun flipping it. But do you feel like that's the best version of Star Wars

[01:21:57] and it's worth nine grand. And that's where we're at. I mean, a game, you know, needs to be fun,

[01:22:02] but it also needs to be worth what you paid for it. You know, a Mazda Miata is fun. It might be

[01:22:10] more fun to drive than a half a million dollar Ferrari because you're not worried about crashing it.

[01:22:17] But it's if I charged you a half a million dollars for Miata, is it's, you know, do you feel like

[01:22:22] it's just as is it as much fun now? Exactly. Yeah. I mean, and I think the point that you're making is

[01:22:31] that I feel like is kind of relevant here. The games from the 90s, I feel like that that

[01:22:39] truly was the Renaissance of pinball from, you know, the 70s over to the 90s. And the creativity that

[01:22:47] they put into those games, mechanisms, I felt like they never cut corners anywhere. I felt like

[01:22:53] that those design teams always put everything that they wanted to put into those games. And,

[01:23:00] and you know, you'll always be able to get those games for less money than the prices that these

[01:23:05] new games are at until the prices come down. And even though, yeah, it's DMD era and everything.

[01:23:11] And it seems like it's old technology compared to the LCDs. I don't think that the magic will ever

[01:23:17] fade away from those games. And they've, they've already stood the test of time. You know, if they were,

[01:23:23] if they were fads back in the 90s, then they would have just gone away. And we wouldn't care about

[01:23:28] those games anymore. But the fact that people still hunt down Adam's family in Twilight Zone and

[01:23:33] Whitewater, you know, they've stood the test of time. And I don't know that some of these new games

[01:23:40] are going to do that. You know, it's just like movies, right? It's like back to the future of the movie.

[01:23:46] We'll always be amazing. The fifth element will always be amazing. It doesn't matter that they have

[01:23:50] new movies with better technology and, you know, more tools to play with. A classic, a classic will

[01:23:57] always be a classic. And we'll always sort of bring that magic no matter when you play it. And that's

[01:24:02] that's how games remain classics over 30 years is they just have that thing that clicks, that

[01:24:09] that intangible, the elements of art and, and like music and, and, and, and like shots and mechanism

[01:24:16] and toys. And it all works together. And, and it never gets old. I'm going to use that pitch when

[01:24:21] I saw my totem in a few months when it's finished because I, I'm, I'm, I'm having a hard time

[01:24:29] deciding if I should let it go or not because of what you just said. I just think it's, it's, it,

[01:24:33] it will never see another game like that ever. Um, well, Blake, I want to appreciate you for taking

[01:24:39] the time. I will, when I insert this podcast, apologize for some of the sound quality issues,

[01:24:45] Blake, you got to get your computer fixed so we can have headset quality coming from your end

[01:24:49] again. Yeah, I'm sorry, man. Yeah, usually don't have those issues. Right. Um, but yeah,

[01:24:55] well, talk to you soon. Bubba's growling. He's got to go for a piss. So that, that's my cue that

[01:24:58] this podcast is over Blake. Have a great night and we'll talk to you soon. You too. Thanks, Chris.

[01:25:05] All right. Later, man.
