[00:00] I've put my trust in you. Push that spot as I can go.

[00:07] Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.

[00:13] All right. Let's just do like a fun Canadian pinball podcast today.

[00:18] How's that sound? I feel like everything's been so heavy lately.

[00:22] And let's just take some of that weight off our shoulders and talk about the pinball hobby.

[00:27] We'll talk about news and rumors going on in pinball.

[00:30] We'll talk about people's responses a little bit to the Raza game.

[00:34] Who's got the licensing rights to Rick and Morty?

[00:39] Dutch pinballs got a new apron on the game.

[00:42] Lots going on. And somewhat it also feels like not much at all is going on in the pinball world.

[00:48] But here's where I want to start. Here's where I want to start.

[00:51] I just want to answer some of the critics.

[00:54] And I have some critics. You'd be surprised.

[00:57] I have some people that don't agree with what I do.

[01:00] I have some people who thought that what I'm doing with the Big Lebowski sale,

[01:04] I went about it all wrong.

[01:06] Now let me first say that. Majority of people.

[01:10] Majority of people are like, I think it's good what you're doing.

[01:13] I support it. I think it's a classiac.

[01:15] And I couldn't agree more with those people, right?

[01:18] But some people feel like no money is coming out of your pocket, Chris,

[01:22] if you do it this way, what are you really doing?

[01:25] And I'll just say this.

[01:27] Everybody on planet earth knows I could sell a Big Lebowski for more than $12,500.

[01:34] Okay. I already have offers $16,000, $17,000.

[01:37] Some guy on eBay wants to give me $16,000 for tomorrow.

[01:41] And here's the thing. Here's the thing.

[01:44] If I sold it for $18,000 and I put that money in my pocket,

[01:49] does it then become my money by which I can decide what to do with?

[01:54] And if I take that amount of money over the $12,500 and donate it to Project Pimball,

[02:01] is that not my money going to Project Pimball?

[02:04] See, here's the thing. I don't really care.

[02:06] I know what I'm doing is the right thing.

[02:08] I know the money is going to go to a good cause.

[02:10] And I'm not going to let you naysayers rain on this fundraiser.

[02:17] No good deed goes unpunished, especially in the age of the internet,

[02:23] in which everyone has to send me like, you know,

[02:26] write these long-winded emails, save your energy, save your time.

[02:30] I think this is a great way to get rid of this game.

[02:33] Someone gets a game. Project Pimball gets some money.

[02:36] It's a win-win for everybody, okay?

[02:38] All right. So that being said, just don't forget,

[02:40] we're going to accept bids on this game all the way up till Sunday, December 8th.

[02:44] So if you want a big Lebowski, you know, hit me up.

[02:47] I'll say this. I did learn through this, the power of a theme.

[02:52] And more and more, I get people who Facebook chat me and say,

[02:57] hey, I'm really interested in this game, okay?

[02:59] And then the second thing I always ask people is, hey, do you know anything about Pimball?

[03:05] And you'd be surprised how many people just love the big Lebowski so much.

[03:10] I don't know how Facebook algorithm works,

[03:13] but people see that it's for sale.

[03:15] And they're like, no, I don't know anything about Pimball.

[03:18] And then they always ask the second question, how much is the big Lebowski Pimball?

[03:23] And I don't know about you, but because we're so used to witnessing, you know,

[03:27] the escalating prices of the Pimball world, the common man and common woman out there in the world,

[03:34] probably thinks that Pimball machines cost like 1,500 bucks.

[03:39] And I always sort of like, and so nervous to tell people the actual price of a machine.

[03:45] So someone says like, what's the big Lebowski?

[03:48] And if I said, hey, 15, they'd be like, oh, 1,500, here you go.

[03:51] No, $15,000 is probably where the conversation would even begin if you wanted to get into the ballpark

[03:59] of getting one of these games right now.

[04:01] And I also, you know, I got a guy and he wants to put it like in his restaurant.

[04:05] And I'm like, dude, if you've never bought a Pimball machine before, I need to call you

[04:09] and walk you through the entire storyline here because I don't know.

[04:13] I don't like to be one of those guys who sells something to someone and they have no idea what they're getting into.

[04:19] This isn't just a normal machine with normal customer service and a normal history, right?

[04:24] There's a lot that goes with it.

[04:26] All right. Okay. So let's move on.

[04:28] You look, I know I had the Pinside podcast post my last or my last podcast was about

[04:33] Pinside yanking it down and I, you look, they're just, they're just never going to let me have anything with my name attached to it.

[04:38] And that's cool. We'll sell this game without Pinside. I'm not worried about that.

[04:42] All right. And don't forget, if you want a Batman Super Ali, this one for sale.

[04:47] You know, I'm looking forward, I'm looking forward to sort of cleaning the slate of what I've got,

[04:53] invested in Pimball and starting over in 2020.

[04:57] Now, another thing I'm going to do to just clean the slate and clean clean house on

[05:03] Canadian Pimball podcast and Chris's engagement with Pimball.

[05:07] I'm also going to air. I've just come to this conclusion.

[05:10] I'm going to air the lost Jared interview that I did with him about a year and a half.

[05:16] It's probably like two years old right now.

[05:18] We, I talked to Jared over at Stern and then Stern Pimball listened to it and said they did not want it to be aired.

[05:25] I'm going to air it. And I think when you hear it now two years later,

[05:30] it's not going to be relevant because I think we talk about games that are two years old.

[05:34] I think you're going to laugh when you hear this interview and you realize that this made Stern nervous.

[05:40] I think the one thing they really got nervous about was Steve Richie calling Pinside a cancer.

[05:46] Now that Robert Mueller has called it a sewer, maybe, maybe it's time that we use a new adjective to describe the site.

[05:54] Okay, so what else is going on in the Pimball world?

[05:57] Let's talk about, since we talk about theme, Rick and Morty, someone is making a Rick and Morty Pimball machine.

[06:04] Now, who is it? Is it Scott Denise's next game or is it Stern Pimball's next game?

[06:09] Or could it possibly be the other one that it could possibly be is American Pimball's next game?

[06:16] Now, here's what I want to tell you right now.

[06:19] I don't care who makes a Rick and Morty game.

[06:24] It's probably the easiest theme for me to pass on out of all the themes that I've ever heard thrown out there as possible Pimball themes.

[06:34] And it's like Guns and Rose is give it to me, toy story, give it to me, star wars, give it to me, Batman, give it to me, and Rick and Morty, what?

[06:43] Who, who, like, you know, and look, I'm not here to tell you it's not a popular show because it does have a following.

[06:50] But I was reading a mashable story about Rick and Morty's popularity and I've never seen a single episode of Rick and Morty.

[06:57] So I'm not going to tell you it's good or bad. I don't know. I absolutely know frame of reference.

[07:02] But the audience for this is a younger audience. It's a more millennial audience.

[07:07] And I'll tell you right now, guess who doesn't have money to buy Pimball machines, a younger millennial audience.

[07:15] So it really is a head scratcher that anyone would make this theme and want to get sales out of it.

[07:21] It reminds me of when Ben Heck was like, Futurama would do great.

[07:24] You know, it's like those, it's sort of in that realm of Bob's burger, Futurama, Rick and Morty.

[07:31] Definitely, definitely a niche theme if there ever was one.

[07:36] And then the people who actually do enjoy it don't buy Pimball machines.

[07:41] So it's a little bit of a double whammy, but we know that someone is going to make this game.

[07:46] So the question I have for you, the listener, and we talk a lot on this show about market research.

[07:51] So what market research did someone do to land at Rick and Morty as being the next game?

[07:58] I don't know. I don't know how you can correlate the fans of that show with the kinds of people that buy Pimball machines.

[08:07] And if you did a survey of what people want to own, I can't imagine Rick and Morty would be at the top of anyone's wish list.

[08:16] And oftentimes when people would write into different threads, here's my dream themes.

[08:21] I never really saw Rick and Morty come up very often.

[08:25] So it's common or it's or someone has the license for it. So we'll see when it actually does happen.

[08:31] Now, what is Stern's next game if it's not Rick and Morty?

[08:35] Now it might be Rick and Morty because I did hear from someone that Stern's next game is a head scratcher.

[08:40] And Rick and Morty does make me want to scratch my head.

[08:43] Okay, I don't think we're going to see Stern's next game until CES, which is the first week in January.

[08:50] That seems to be the most likely place to bring the game.

[08:53] Now, I think it would be a home run if Stern rocked into CES with Stranger Things by Brian Eddie.

[09:02] I mean, wouldn't that be like the best place to bring that game and the best forum in which to release it to the world?

[09:09] I just think to make Stranger Things the right way, you're going to need to have all the assets from the TV show to do it right.

[09:18] And I don't know. I don't know. We haven't really seen Stern give us the kinds of assets we want in these themes lately.

[09:25] But we know they can do it. They did it with Star Wars. I always fall back on that because Star Wars is one of the most popular franchises and expensive franchises.

[09:35] And Stern gave us everything we wanted with Star Wars in terms of the assets. Now, how they assemble those assets. That's a whole no.

[09:41] There's a story that we're not going to go down that road.

[09:43] All right. So there's new news today from the world of Dutch Pimbal and a newsletter went out from Barry showing people a promising bunch of photos of Big Lebowski production happening over there in the Netherlands.

[10:00] Now we're seeing games on an assembly line. We're seeing the new apron that he's giving to the early achievers who buy one of these new games.

[10:11] And it's a backlit apron for the game that only early achievers get if they buy one of these new games at $12,500.

[10:20] So you're $21,000 into the game and you get one right now with a special apron with the hope of getting one down the road.

[10:30] The main question right now that everyone has is how will these games hold value if they make 200, 300, 400.

[10:42] Will they all be worth $12,500? And I just want to say, and I'm not saying this because you know, I'm selling a big Lebowski.

[10:50] I do. I think these games are going to hold their value for a few reasons. One, there's only going to be about like four to 500 games in total if they ever figure this thing out.

[11:02] So if you think about it like that, and there's only one version of the game.

[11:07] So imagine if Stern only made 400 Ghostbusters or Stern only made 400 L virus. Like nope, there's no pro version of the Big Lebowski.

[11:18] There's no premium. It's just this one version with everything in it. And if I think the theme is popular enough within the demographic for pinball that these games would hold their value.

[11:31] Now the question, the question obviously becomes how long is it going to take to make that many games and will interest in this game remain strong.

[11:44] If it's going to take them a year or two to complete these orders, the other question I have is if you're an early achiever, why do you, what do you do with the second game you get?

[11:56] I mean, people forget that you're 21 grand in on one title now with hopes that you get a second title. But why does anybody need two of the same game?

[12:08] So I think that's another, you know, it's like I know people really want it. But no one's ever had to do this before by their game again with the promise of getting two of them.

[12:18] So kind of strange never really happened in the history of pinball. And the final question that we all have and I don't know if we'll ever get the answer is where's the money coming from?

[12:27] Like who's financing this thing right now? Do you care? I kind of just want to see them figure this thing out.

[12:33] I would love people to get their games. I'm always skeptical though because when I see these photos, it does remind me a lot of highway pinball because remember remember highway pinball.

[12:45] What was the one thing we never saw in any of the photos normally when Angie was trying to convince us production was going on? You don't see people anyone can stage a manufacturing photo.

[12:59] But people are real. You have to have people there who are working on the games. Who's there? Who's working on these games?

[13:08] It's one thing for a couple people to build a few games and put them in a box. But if you're going to try to build a few hundred, then you need labor and you need people there.

[13:18] And so I would love to see a video of what production looks like. I would even love to just see how many cabinets do they have?

[13:25] Can't build a game without cabinets. I see a bunch of boxes stacked on top of each other. But I don't see people. I don't see a bunch of cabinets. So we'll see.

[13:35] We'll see what they can pull off with this with this new like third or fourth time trying to make the big Lebowski.

[13:42] A lot of people are talking about the deep root interview we did with Robert Mueller. And I think we covered Raza in a nice way. I think we got three different points of view on the game.

[13:56] We got from a beginner player in advanced player and the guy who's running the company. So I really feel glad about the variety of coverage that you got with Raza with with Canadian Spinball podcast.

[14:09] And I've enjoyed listening to other pinball podcasts deconstruct the interviews we've done with people and with people's videos and with people's gameplay experiences from the Houston Expo.

[14:21] And I will say this I'm a little shocked at some of the feedback mainly the feedback around the ramp because I still after watching all the videos and hearing all of the analysis.

[14:34] I think people are missing a few things. Okay, I think people are missing the fact that even though this is a prototype.

[14:41] Everything that is on that play field is pretty much finalized in terms of the mechs and the ramps and the way the game plays I don't think is really going to change it all.

[14:52] And so if you listen to stuff that's going to change is the art package and the code and the cabinets that that that house these games.

[15:04] But will that ramp change and I'm also just so surprised that so many of us who have played pinball for years who understand what makes a game great are now like almost excusing.

[15:17] I think just a fundamental design flaw in a game. I've never heard a designer say that a ramp is purposely meant to be difficult to make.

[15:31] I mean that does it just doesn't compute it doesn't seem to make sense because a ramp that is purposely difficult to make is frustrating.

[15:44] It's not fun and we've heard from so many people from the show it's not fun having a ramp in a game that is stopping go that you can't nail over and over again if you're a precise shooter.

[16:00] So something has to give they have to listen to this feedback and I think they have to address that ramp issue the other part I just don't understand and this is just I've spent like a week just mulling this over a little bit if you go back and look at the whole reason why people gravitated towards raza and john's games.

[16:21] It's because of how beautiful they were it's because of the amazing art packages that's what he reeled people in with.

[16:31] So then now they're telling us that they don't want people to buy the games based on the art they want them to buy them based on the games.

[16:42] But this doesn't visually look nearly as spectacular as what we saw with zidware it just you just have to google image search raza and zidware and put these two side by side and you tell me which one pops but again again the get out of jail free card on everyone's opinion on everyone's feedback the get out of jail free card is that it's just a prototype and I don't know like at some point.

[17:11] It's not going to be right and that's that's that's coming in March but I do think they got a lot of good feedback and they need to listen to it alright what else is going on the pinball world oh man the twippies are coming up and I listened and I heard that the twippy committee which I am not a part of I am not a part of the twippy committee they have convened and they are doing something new this year it is actually good it's going to make it easier to do it.

[17:40] It's going to make it easier for people to vote when you have your right in sections you know like best pinball podcast best pinball tournament best pinball venue anything where you write in your answer and and we've been part of the right in category for best pinball podcast what they're going to do this year is they are going to ask people I believe starting December first is they're going to ask people to write in what they want to see in those categories.

[18:09] And then they are going to aggregate the top responses and I think the top 10 responses and make those part of the drop down category so when you go on to vote we will be in actual selection can it is pinball podcast I think that's great because I can't imagine how many vote we must have lost because people spelled canator wrong it's also going to just be interesting to see all the top 10 pinball podcast because there's a lot of them.

[18:37] But I look forward to it award season is always fun Jeff and the twippy staff do a great job of putting the show together and it always is a fun time of year celebrating the best the best in the pinball industry so it is going to be really cool and I look forward to seeing all the different categories and all the different things happening and encapsulating and tires you in entire years worth the pinball in that voting because it's great you get to see like oh yeah the

[19:07] those were all the games that came out last year those were the best art packages those were the best mods those were the best you know designs the best themes and it's just cool to sort of see it entire years worth the pinball in one place in which we also can vote and then celebrate the best of the best in the industry speaking of pinball podcast now we are finally it seems like going to get Christopher Franchise podcast with Ed van der Vien and doctor pin the three of them are teaming up

[19:37] to do a pinball podcast show and I forget what the name is it's not the super duper extra awesome it's something similar to that and it's the pinball podcast we all deserve I look forward to hearing it I I've loved hearing how Christopher Franchise does really cool stuff with his production quality and podcasts I think he's got a great radio voice and I think he shoots from the hip and you know me I just love people who are candid and just tell it like it is

[20:06] and I think he's one of those gentlemen he might not tell us what he thinks about Chicago gaming company but the good news is he's working with Chicago gaming company and almost all of the news that comes out of C.G.C.

[20:18] is is really positive news so that that's that's going to be interesting to see how they are you know how that show materializes can't wait to check it out all right we have to congratulate Jersey Jack pinball on shipping

[20:32] Willie wonka collectors additions now I saw an unboxing of one where it has the single coin slot so that went over to Europe somewhere

[20:40] but these games are going out richy wrench is going to get his game soon is going to get his coin door powder coated that nice candy apple red

[20:48] but the games are on the line you can order one now and they are beautiful I won't lie I love the way the game looks I still think Jersey Jack games aesthetically

[21:00] are sexy sexy machines absolutely I can't wait to see guns and roses I can't I can't wait to see

[21:08] Eric's follow up game you know to me Eric is really I think the future of Jersey Jack pinball it's not pat lawler it's not it's Eric

[21:19] he has shown us that he is an original thinker that he has new designs that he mechanically is pushing the envelope in pinball

[21:29] and I think he approaches these games without any legacy other than the legacy he's trying to create for himself right now

[21:37] I think we all agree we need young talent in this hobby we need new people in this hobby

[21:45] it doesn't excite me when we keep hearing the same designers from the nineties who haven't worked in pinball since the nineties

[21:52] just getting picked up and told to keep making the same thing and they must still approach it like it's 1995

[21:59] I don't see many of them approaching it like it's 2019 right like what are you seeing in raza that feels like a 2019 thing that

[22:08] couldn't have been done that's actually a good question that to stand over these new games could this have been done in in 1995

[22:15] or did you do something that feels like innovative and new and original we've seen so much before we don't want to look back I want to look forward

[22:23] and guns and roses is interesting because you're like what what mechanically can you put into this game that's going to be reflective of the rock man guns and roses

[22:35] you know how is he going to bring it to life I always thought the coolest thing I would do this is what I would do I would if I was designing a music pin

[22:43] I would make the back of the play field an elevated stage okay and I would have it be all about creating almost like you're looking at the at a miniature version of the guns and roses stage in the back of the game

[22:57] and the whole goal of the game is to get the band through an entire concert and before you play the game you set the set list

[23:07] right so you got to get through the 15 modes and whatever order you want to do it you want to start with jungle do you want to go to it so easy do you want to go to Mr. Brownstone live and let that I don't know I thought that would be really cool

[23:19] to do it that way maybe if the collect all the band members first and then they pop up on stage slash comes out from underneath the stage kind of like when he comes out from underneath the water in the

[23:30] strange music video here's what I hope I hope that these guys are die hard guns and roses fans as well because when you're making something like this there are just a lot of nuances that if you didn't grow up like just just infactuate it with guns and roses you might miss some of the creative elements you might drop into the game

[23:49] to this pin but when will we see guns and roses from Eric you know jacks timing if you look at it it's a little bit delayed and we all know that the play field issues have caused somewhat of a delay with him he definitely was not anticipating that but if you were to ask me it just seems like T.P.F. is going to once again be the moment in which we see guns and roses from Jersey Jack pinball now if you were smart I would you know guns and roses big and whenever people are like oh no

[24:19] you know I don't know how popular that's going to be it would make more sense to not reveal it at T.P.F. I mean you I'd want to reveal it I'd want to reveal it with rolling stone or a big music outlet and start there and and get the word out now the great thing is this when guns and roses sort of markets this they're going to have a humongous fan base to promote this with like this if you think about it like this

[24:49] this will reach more eyeballs than any other Jersey Jack pinball machine ever and I mean that because guns and roses has an active audience worldwide now if you think about it if you have the wizard of us

[25:03] or is there a wizard of us Facebook page that has the amount of people into it right nope okay the Hobbit movies that people really didn't like who are you reaching when you have the hobbit pinball machine and and and people are sort of sour on the film because the films weren't that good right you're not really waking that many people up dialed in you reach nobody nobody like there's no pre exist

[25:33] in dialed in fans so you're really relegated to only pinball fanatics and maybe pat lawler fans which is next to nothing like a few thousand people might care but when you make a guns and roses pinball machine there's millions of people that love this band and care about this band millions of people way more and it's way more relevant and they're

[25:56] currently way more relevant even than Willie Wonka I mean remember guns and roses just announced that they made 540 or 550 million dollars on their last tour that is currently still going on and the rumor is they have a new album coming out sometime in the next year or so I never believe that they never release albums that's part of guns and roses is entire like as a fan that's all I ever do is get my hopes up for new albums but you know what I'm saying is when Jersey Jack gets this game out I think he's gonna

[26:25] realize that this could possibly be the strongest themed Jersey Jack game to date again you might disagree with me but I'm telling you when it comes to

[26:37] engaging people that will you know are on the receiving end right how many of you were like watching Wizard of Oz all the time or watching Willie Wonka I bet you are playing guns and roses in your car when you're driving I bet you hear it when you watch a football game on the weekends

[26:54] this band has more of a engaged audience than those other themes from Jersey Jack Pimball so that being said question is how will this sell in 2020 for Jersey Jack Pimball

[27:11] well if Eric Kimmachanically do some really interesting things with this game and the art package is stellar we know the songs are incredible I mean guns and roses doesn't have a lot of albums which is good because in everything that makes it way into the game

[27:27] is going to be like one of their hit songs because out of all the bands I always think you know had quality over quantity

[27:34] so you're gonna have like November rain paradise city welcome to the jungle sweet child of mine you know strange knocking in the heavens door I don't know if they're gonna have that one because Bob Dylan but they're definitely going to have live and let die

[27:47] then they'll probably be some stuff from Chinese democracy probably hopefully hopefully just a couple songs from Chinese D

[27:54] but you know what I'm saying it's gonna sound amazing I have something like out of all the games Jersey Jack has made let's be honest

[28:02] they've all been sort of PG you know not really hitting the Pimball demo properly like they haven't been for men and I'm just gonna say it like

[28:15] Pimball's demographic is majority of people are men ages 40 to 60 guns and roses hits that sweet spot I mean Jack's been making games basically for families

[28:29] and I think this is the first game he's making that is targeted and and is going to appeal to more men and the masculine side of the hobby now the good news is to guns and roses has appeal across both men and women

[28:45] and their music is is more popular than a lot of the other music pins we've seen come out in the world but music pins also are a little bit limiting because you don't have a narrative you don't have a storyline

[28:57] interesting because guns and roses as a band has a very distinct narrative there's no way they're going to go down that road because the guns and roses narrative is not really a positive one so I think it would be cool to do it about like you know trying to get guns and roses on stage and it performed their entire set could be kind of funny because that always was a challenge for for the people that were managing guns and roses over the years

[29:22] so I think we'll see that in March guns and roses and then toy stories those two man Jack I know you think I'm a terrible person but I would love to buy toy story and guns and roses if they knock it out of the park and that's one of the reasons why I just want to free up my capital I think Batman 66 is a phenomenal game I've loved it over the last two years but I'm ready to pass it on to someone else who wants to enjoy Batman and wants the best version of Batman 66

[29:50] okay and I'm looking forward I'm looking forward to staring in a blank wall in my bedroom and wondering what am I gonna put there what is going to be good enough to get my money and put in that spot will it be medieval madness remake Royal edition will it be guns and roses will it be Raza what will it be I love it I love not knowing right versus just buying everything and then trying to figure out if I like it or not I'm not one of those guys I I

[30:18] To be honest, I can't afford to be one of those guys.

[30:21] I can't.

[30:22] I can't afford to take $2,000 or losses on a game if I don't like it, and then it's really

[30:27] hard to move.

[30:28] It's also really annoying for me to move a game into my apartment.

[30:31] It takes a lot of work.

[30:33] I don't have a big basement.

[30:35] You can't just pull your pickup truck right in front of my house.

[30:39] I even take, go up some stairs, take an elevator.

[30:42] I have to take the door off the hinges to get the game into the bedroom.

[30:46] It's annoying.

[30:47] It's a lot of work.

[30:48] I also don't like having to pack up games and get them out of here.

[30:53] It's an all day affair.

[30:55] But I am really excited to see what 2020 has in store for us with Pimball.

[31:01] I think there's going to be a lot of titles and themes and mechanisms and Pimball games

[31:08] that are going to try and win us over and try to be the new classics in Pimball.

[31:16] A better way to do it than just to have money in the bank and wait to see what comes out.

[31:20] I really look forward to 2020 and not having anything other than the ability to put a fresh

[31:26] new game inside my home.

[31:30] Here's what I want to do.

[31:32] Here's what I want to do.

[31:33] It's Thanksgiving this week.

[31:35] We all have a lot to be thankful for.

[31:37] We all should be thankful that we're still here in kicking.

[31:41] We have our friends and our family to be thankful for.

[31:44] We have all these Pimball companies that we should be thankful for are still making

[31:48] games in 2019 into 2020.

[31:51] I think it's almost crazy that this hobby has more manufacturers now than ever before.

[31:58] Unbelievable.

[31:59] This hobby is pretty much dead by now and it's alive and kicking.

[32:04] So lots to be thankful for.

[32:05] I'm thankful for all of you who listen to Canatus Pimball podcasts.

[32:09] I really do appreciate each and every one of you who tunes in.

[32:13] Whether or not you can stand me or not, I think that you take the time to at least hear

[32:18] me out.

[32:19] I hope all of you have an amazing Thanksgiving with your families.

[32:23] I say that now because I am going to take off a few days and not come back on the airwaves

[32:28] until probably sometime over the weekend or Monday.

[32:31] I just want to unwind.

[32:32] I want to spend time with those who mean the most to me.

[32:37] You come in as a close second but I really just want to bond with my family and spend

[32:45] a quality time with Bubba.

[32:47] Visit my mom and just see people out there.

[32:50] Hopefully get to see my brother and do stuff this holiday weekend that is outside of the

[32:57] world of Pimball.

[33:00] And then next week we're going to hit the phone hard.

[33:02] We're going to do as much as we can to raise as much money for that big Lebowski so we

[33:07] can write as big of a check as we can to project Pimball.

[33:10] And we're going to have new new guests coming on the show soon as well.

[33:13] I told you that Bill Webb was coming on from Special WinLit.

[33:17] He is still going to come on.

[33:18] He had to just delay because of personal reasons.

[33:22] But he is going to come on the show.

[33:25] Here's what I'll do.

[33:26] I'll air for you the Jared Lost interview during the next few days.

[33:30] So you have another Canadian Pimball podcast to listen to to fill your free time.

[33:37] How's that sound?

[33:38] Everyone.

[33:39] Have an amazing Thanksgiving.

[33:40] Thank you again for all you do and for all the time you give me to talk to you about

[33:46] Pimball.

[33:48] Love you guys.

[33:49] Talk to you soon.
