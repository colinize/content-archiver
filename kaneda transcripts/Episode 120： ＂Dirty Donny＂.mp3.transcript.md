[00:00] You loving it and loving it, huh?

[00:02] You living it up when I'm going down.

[00:05] You loving it and loving it, huh?

[00:07] You loving it up till I keep the ground.

[00:10] Let's.

[00:11] Let's.

[00:12] Let's.

[00:13] Let's.

[00:14] Let's.

[00:15] Let's.

[00:16] Let's.

[00:17] Welcome to Episode Wow.

[00:19] We're at 120 episodes of Canadian Pimbal Podcasts.

[00:24] On this podcast, we are going to continue our series of

[00:29] interviews with great people who are making a huge impact in the

[00:33] Pimbal world.

[00:34] And on this episode, we're going to talk to Derni Donney Gillis,

[00:38] who, and Donney is the man who, I believe, brought back artwork

[00:44] where it needed to be in Pimbal with what he did on Metallica,

[00:49] what he's done on Aerosmith and what he did with the

[00:53] PBR Crusher game, but really the two juggernauts are his work on

[00:57] Aerosmith.

[00:58] And so we're going to talk to Donney about artwork and its importance

[01:01] with Pimbal.

[01:02] Because if you know me, there's one thing I value.

[01:05] I think artwork and theme are the two most important elements that make a

[01:11] Pimbal machine special.

[01:13] They really do.

[01:14] I'm not one of these guys who demands the super deep code with

[01:20] bajillion wizard modes and 18 billion points and stacking modes and

[01:26] this and that.

[01:27] Sure, I like a game with depth, but I would much rather have a game

[01:32] look amazing and have an amazing theme versus a game that's got all

[01:37] of this deep code that I'm never going to see in the game.

[01:40] All right.

[01:41] So, but before we do that, let's do a little bit of some quick updates

[01:45] before I air the interview with Donney.

[01:47] First, I want to give a shout out to a couple people first and foremost.

[01:51] I have to give a shout out to Brenda.

[01:54] She listened to the the Allentown podcast with Ted and she's like,

[02:00] you know, you gave a shout out to all these people, but you didn't give a shout out

[02:03] to Brenda and I want to say Brenda, thank you.

[02:05] I love you.

[02:06] I love that you got in the car with me and we drove through some stormy weather

[02:11] to get to Allentown fairground to play some Pimbal.

[02:15] She's a trooper.

[02:16] She really is a trooper and it's very rare that you find someone who can

[02:23] share in a passion like Pimbal with you.

[02:25] Even if Brenda doesn't love it, she's such a good sport about coming along,

[02:29] playing the games and telling me her honest opinion about stuff because I don't

[02:34] know about you guys out there who are in relationships, but ideally you want

[02:38] to find that pin that she loves it just as much as you do.

[02:42] Right?

[02:43] I mean, that is sort of what we're searching for.

[02:46] Unfortunately, most of these themes are only targeting men, right?

[02:50] They really are.

[02:52] What else?

[02:53] I want to say a shout out to Joe.

[02:56] Joe was at Allentown.

[02:58] He played Aerosmith with Brenda Ted and myself.

[03:01] Joe, thank you for listening to the show.

[03:04] He sent me a little email saying he couldn't agree more with me about highway and

[03:09] Dutch.

[03:10] There are absolutely no way in hell of those two companies are going to survive Joe

[03:14] things.

[03:15] I don't know.

[03:16] I think we might be on to something that both these companies could be

[03:20] in for a rough ride, but you're hearing this first on Canadian pinball podcast people.

[03:25] I am hearing and I'm not going to go very far into this speculation, but I am hearing

[03:31] there's really good news that is going to come out of Dutch pinball situation.

[03:38] So I hope that's true.

[03:41] I hope that's true, but I'm hearing that we could hear some very, very positive news

[03:45] for people who are expecting to get their big Lebowski soon.

[03:49] So we'll stay tuned for that.

[03:51] Who else I want to give a shout out?

[03:53] I want to give a shout out to another listener of this show and that is Sean.

[03:59] Sean F.

[04:01] Sean wrote, hi, canada.

[04:03] I've only been in the hobby for about a year, but I really enjoy your podcast.

[04:07] I think that yours more than any other pinball podcast and I listen to all of them.

[04:13] Educates me on the industry.

[04:16] Other than what you talk about, I don't know the canada that's been banned from

[04:21] pinside, but this second act canada sounds reasonable informed and entertains me

[04:27] throughout the week.

[04:29] So thanks for your efforts.

[04:31] Sean F. Thank you for that note.

[04:33] I really do appreciate it.

[04:34] And for you other listeners out there, if you want to say something to me,

[04:38] if you want to respond to anything you hear on this podcast, hit me up at canada

[04:43] gmail.

[04:44] Sorry, canada pinball at gmail.com.

[04:47] And I will read your feedback on the air.

[04:51] That is always the agreement I have with my listeners.

[04:54] So a little some news items before we kick off the interview with Dirty Donny.

[04:59] What do I want to talk about?

[05:01] There is a thread blowing up that has this title.

[05:05] Pinball prices are going to plummet.

[05:09] And it's gotten so much engagement.

[05:13] And it reminds me of the canada of the good old days, right?

[05:16] This guy has one pinball machine in his collection.

[05:19] He's brand new to pinside.

[05:21] And he just says something that's just meant it's just meant to get underneath the skin of people on pinside.

[05:28] And by the number of people responding to this guy's accusations that pinball prices are going to plummet,

[05:34] he's hit a nerve.

[05:36] And here's my take on this whole thing.

[05:39] And he gives his name's Gonzo and he gives all these different reasons why he thinks pinball machines are going to plummet.

[05:46] And there are reasons we've heard time and time again.

[05:49] Stuff like people are going to age out of the hobby.

[05:52] Stuff like young people aren't getting into pinball.

[05:55] Stuff like deep pockets, right?

[05:58] That people are going to buy everything they want and there's not going to be anything new they're going to chase.

[06:03] All these different reasons.

[06:05] Now if you were just to ask me, canada, and I look at this hobby and I observe it from a collectible standpoint.

[06:12] If you said our price is going to go down in pinball, I would say to you, yes.

[06:17] Like there is no way around the fact that the majority of pinball machines that are out there are going to lose value.

[06:24] There's too much new and exciting stuff coming out.

[06:28] Just this afternoon, I went to Sunshine Laundromat and I played a bunch of pinball machines.

[06:34] And the ones that had my attention, the ones that I was most excited to play were Aerosmith and they had Big Lebowski working.

[06:43] Those two were in my mind the most valuable experiences for me to get on because they're new.

[06:53] And I think people are always going to be chasing the hot new themes and they're going to want the hot new themes when they come out.

[06:58] They're going to want Star Wars.

[07:00] They're going to want Alien. They're going to want Dialnan. They're going to want Toy Story.

[07:04] They're going to want Pirates of the Caribbean.

[07:06] You know, this notion of like, I want the new stuff because I think people are more addicted to getting the new inbox experience.

[07:14] Then they are just building these big collections and holding on to things forever.

[07:21] People will get bored and when they want to move the game out of their collection or out of their house.

[07:27] That is when they are going to experience what we've been calling with the Black Knight, a market stall.

[07:34] Is that people are not going to get what they paid for because there's just too many options.

[07:40] Am I going to go spend MSRP on someone's use pin or just go buy a new pin?

[07:46] But here's the thing. Prices are not going to plummet.

[07:49] Pins are going to lose a thousand here or a thousand there. Some might go down more if the game is not good.

[07:57] But you're not going to start seeing Wizard of Oz is selling for $4,000 anytime soon.

[08:04] And if you ask me, this is why. And people can call me crazy.

[08:09] I don't think most pinball machines are collectible in any sense of the word because there's just too many of them out there.

[08:17] This whole notion that the trim package makes something collectible and that will be the one everybody wants.

[08:25] I think is ridiculous. There's a reason why Batman 66 Super Ellie is never going to be really a sought after collectible

[08:38] because you can get the same exact experience with the other Batman's that costs so much less.

[08:45] And the same is true with all the other Ellie's that's thrown eventually makes because the premium is the same exact game.

[08:52] I think the values will just keep going down and down and down on these things. I just do.

[08:58] And it's also the reason why I think when I'm a good magic girl in my living room, it doesn't matter that the game doesn't even play.

[09:06] If you're a collector of pinball and you want to have something that's rare and unique, you can't beat something like a magic girl.

[09:16] I'd rather have one magic girl that doesn't fully work versus two pinball machines that work but thousands of people have the same exact game.

[09:26] And I say that from a collector's standpoint, that's the key as a collectible that might go up in value one day.

[09:35] A rare game like a magic girl has a much better chance versus like a Ghostbusters Ellie where there's 500 of them in the world.

[09:43] So I don't think prices are going to plummet but I think they're all going to go down.

[09:48] And I think not because people are aging out of the hobby, I think solely because there's just too much inventory coming out that people need to make room for the new stuff.

[09:58] And you're not going to be able to just get exactly what you put into a pin back. That's just that's just not going to happen.

[10:05] And if you were to ask me from a collectible standpoint, which games I would buy today that would raise in value five years from now, 10 years from now, the games I would buy to be honest, if I was fully honest with you, I'd buy Alien because I don't think they're going to make that many of them.

[10:23] I don't think they're going to survive and make thousands of these games. I'd buy a big Lebowski because I think they're only going to make like 300 if they ever make the final run of the games.

[10:33] And that's not going to be that many for a game that's that complex and that unique. And I would buy a magic girl. I these people I'm telling you I'm telling you as much as people make fun of this game and they knock it.

[10:44] People are going to say 10 years from now, I can't believe magic goes were only selling for $20,000 on eBay back in 2017.

[10:54] I could be totally wrong. I could be totally wrong. But that's just my guess. That's my guess.

[10:59] All right. Well, it looks like Alien has another machine going on to a truck and going to a customer in Florida. And we heard from this gentleman and he said that he was told by highway that this machine will have the new and improved Xeno head mechanism in the game.

[11:20] Okay. So there was an issue with the Xeno head tongue was shooting out at the wrong times. And if that happened, the bulk had hit it, which could damage it.

[11:29] So I'm curious. I'm curious to see what this means. Does this mean that more machines will be going out this month and in what volume.

[11:40] And what we've still yet to see we've still yet to see any video or pictures of that show a real production occurring over there.

[11:49] And that's what we're waiting for. We're not we're not waiting for anything other than lots of games going into trucks into containers.

[11:59] Not this one game at a time, one customer at a time that that's not that's not going to cut it with the amount of people that are expecting to get their aliens. So we hope we see a lot more games going out to customers over the next few weeks.

[12:16] And we're going to monitor the situation, but that's that's the latest. Hopefully that they've got all the issues ironed out that they can now get production going because excuses excuses excuses.

[12:29] Let's get customers their games. All right. Last point I want to make and this sort of is a good segue into the Donnie interview because we talk a lot about artwork and the aesthetic aesthetic of the game.

[12:39] Someone put up a thread basically saying they didn't like the way Stern pinball machines look with the black speaker grills that are next to the new LCDs.

[12:52] What do you guys think right right me at canada pinball at gmail.com I'm curious to see what you guys think of that whole speaker panel area.

[13:02] Personally, I think Stern could have done a lot more with the area. I really do. I look at games like Ghostbusters, other games where they started to have artwork around that area like Metallica.

[13:15] And then I look at what is there and it's just this these they look like waffle irons like these two big black rectangles.

[13:25] They're very unimaginative. They're very uncreative and I think Stern would be better off integrating the screen with the back glass art in a more seamless manner so that the art also surrounds that area.

[13:41] Sort of like the way Houdini if you look at the Houdini pinball machine and how their screen is integrated into the back glass with the artwork.

[13:50] I think that looks so much better than what Stern has going right now. There's just something off about it and I don't think it looks better with the Batman 66 Super Ali with the red circles around the speakers.

[14:05] I don't there's just something that looks cheap about that section that I hope Stern addresses on future titles or I hope people in the mod community can address that.

[14:13] All right. So speaking of making games look better. I want to air this interview with dirty Donnie and I think Donnie has really brought some of the most amazing artwork to pinball and hand drawn artwork.

[14:29] The importance of it on pinball I think is without a doubt one of the key elements to making a pinball machine incredible.

[14:39] It really is and it's always confusing to me how pinball went from having such great hand drawn artwork to the crappy Photoshop stuff we got in sort of like the 2000 error of pinball.

[14:52] Right. And for Stern now to be the company that is employing the best hand drawn artist in the entire pinball world. I think it's testament to Stern listening to customer feedback, Stern continuing to improve what they deliver.

[15:10] And I can't say enough about aero smith pro at 5200 bucks. How good that game looks. I mean it's it has better art packages than games that cost twice as much.

[15:24] But I still think I still think when it comes to pinball art. We should demand we should demand nothing but the finest art on pinball machines for what these machines now cost.

[15:38] There are so many good artists out there and so when I see a pinball machine come out and and the artwork is mediocre. It's inexcusable. It's inexcusable right.

[15:50] So and nobody knows that better than than dirty Donnie. So without further ado let me air this interview. We have a great talk about his love for pinball.

[15:59] The process of putting artwork on on aero smith and Metallica and just his overall thoughts of how he thinks about art and his approach to putting art on on something that's as unique as a pinball machine.

[16:14] So let me air that interview.

[16:16] All right ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome to canators pinball podcast a very special guest. We have dirty Donnie on the show. One of the most talented artists providing artwork to the pinball world. Donnie welcome to canators pinball podcast.

[16:34] Hey thanks for having me. I'm glad that I'm a very special guest. You are you are and I think people who listen to this podcast they know that probably the number one thing I appreciate in a pinball machine even more than like shot geometry is the artwork of pinball.

[16:51] That's what got me that's what got me into pinball you know it's just the artwork you know it's a game being so attractive and you know just seeing it all like artwork all lit up you know that was that was something that you know just was found very striking about pinball you know I mean as a kid but like I really I really got into pinball I would say like probably probably in the mid 90s.

[17:14] Okay that's when I around when I got my first game my friend Ricky gave me his sonic Mars track and had some friends he was in Toronto and I lived in Montreal and he had some friends picking up a drop it off for me and you know plugging in your first game you know and it was just so cool you know it's this piece of artwork that comes to you know comes to life the lights and you can play it you know but you grew up Donnie when the arcade boom you know you are kid in the 80s and you know you were you in our kids and pinball.

[17:44] Or like walk us through sort of how you got into sort of coin operated machines in your love affair with them.

[17:50] Well I remember being like a little little kid in the 70s and going to like pizza parlors and pinball you know it was at every corner store you know and that's how I was like introduced to it and you know my my all my my older cousin and some my family and my dad my uncle like they all like pinball and we had some other cousin set actually had a I can't remember what game it was but they actually had a game at their house and I remember thinking how cool that was and then

[18:13] And then, you know, like Pac-Man hit,

[18:14] and they had a Miz Pac-Man at my grandparents.

[18:19] My family had a clock.

[18:21] They built clocks and watch repair.

[18:24] So they had a store in a mall,

[18:26] and they had Miz Pac-Man there.

[18:28] And that was like really my first introduction

[18:29] to like arcade games,

[18:32] and I would just like, you know, as Dine to play that.

[18:34] And, you know, of course Atari,

[18:35] you know, like I got an Atari, my friends had them,

[18:39] and I got Pac-Man, and you know,

[18:40] I got totally into that, of course.

[18:42] But yeah, you know, going to arcades and stuff, you know,

[18:46] and I know I would play, I remember playing Pac-Man,

[18:49] and then going over and playing Black Knight,

[18:51] you know, and going back and forth.

[18:52] And like, okay, I'm gonna have some video games,

[18:53] I'm gonna play some pinball, you know, bouncing around.

[18:55] So, but I was like, which one now, like in the 90s,

[19:00] which one were you more like a Street Fighter guy,

[19:02] or like an Adam's Family Pinball guy?

[19:05] Oh man, I was, okay, both, you know,

[19:06] I was like, me and my friends were so in the Street Fighter 2,

[19:10] you know, like a lot of people were, you know,

[19:12] it was just this game, like as far as vids go,

[19:14] like I'd have to say that that's my favorite, you know.

[19:18] Aside from all the retro, you know, 80s games,

[19:20] but that's like three virtues, like they want to go to.

[19:23] But, you know, pinball in the 90s, like,

[19:26] I remember being on tour with my friends band,

[19:28] and the first stop was in Sudbury, in Canada,

[19:31] and Bar had a Elvira Scared Stiff game,

[19:35] and you know, like I dumped about five bucks into it,

[19:38] but I think I spend more time just staring at, like,

[19:40] the Big Fair as is artwork, you know,

[19:42] like just just just just being like,

[19:44] wow, this is like the coolest artwork ever, you know.

[19:46] And it is actually like, you know, in my opinion,

[19:48] like I want to definitely the top five best artwork,

[19:51] you know, pinball machines.

[19:54] But yeah, you know, I've, like theater magic,

[19:56] and Adam's Family was totally,

[19:58] was totally into all those games, you know, in the 90s.

[20:01] Right, so you're in the pinball in the 90s now,

[20:04] when do you get into actually being able

[20:08] to apply your artistic skills to pinball?

[20:11] Like when does Stern come knocking for you?

[20:14] Well, you know, I started my career,

[20:15] it's been about 20 years, full time,

[20:18] and I was buying pinball books, like, in the 90s and stuff,

[20:21] and I was definitely pulling influence

[20:26] from old pinball artists and stuff.

[20:30] But when I moved to California, 2002,

[20:33] I met my friend Wade Krause,

[20:34] who I did a lot of, I've done a lot of projects with,

[20:37] Wade and I had met through a thing called the Circus Punks,

[20:41] and it was like a screen printed little doll

[20:43] that they were making for artists,

[20:46] and Wade was a part of that.

[20:47] And we started talking on the phone, you know,

[20:50] about the project, and then, you know,

[20:52] we discovered that we were both like, into pinball,

[20:54] and the Wade actually, you know, like, had it,

[20:56] like a lot of games, or has a lot of games.

[20:59] And so we became, you know, we became friends,

[21:01] and we talked about, you know, maybe customizing a game,

[21:06] and taking an old game.

[21:07] And so he said, yeah, I have a kingpin machine,

[21:09] and a kingpin is like, it's trashed,

[21:11] but I'd love to restore it and strip it down,

[21:14] and then, you know, we could,

[21:16] he's like, I could screen print the glass with your artwork,

[21:18] we could stencil the sides,

[21:20] and, you know, I would pan paint the play field.

[21:25] And so we just did it, and it was the helicopters game,

[21:29] that's the band from Sweden, the great rock and roll.

[21:31] And I had done a record cover for them,

[21:33] I'd done a bunch of arcs for them,

[21:34] and they're like, buddies of mine,

[21:35] so when we were coming up with the theme,

[21:36] I was like, well, why don't we do this band,

[21:38] is like really cool, and like, why don't we do,

[21:41] like, why don't we take this record cover,

[21:42] and I'll redraw it for a pinball,

[21:44] and we'll go with that theme, you know?

[21:46] And so that's how that came about,

[21:48] and we did that game, and we put it out,

[21:52] and I mean, at that, I don't know the year we put it out,

[21:55] but maybe it was 2006, 2005,

[21:59] but we really hadn't seen a custom pinball done

[22:04] to that level, you know?

[22:05] Like we really went off on that,

[22:06] and it was just a very pretty game.

[22:08] Right, and at that time period,

[22:12] pinball art had sort of fallen by the wayside, right?

[22:16] If you look at the art in games during that error,

[22:19] a lot of it, right?

[22:20] Just Photoshop, sort of hand drawing art was sort of gone.

[22:24] Yeah, pinball and movie posters, you know,

[22:26] a lot of things had just gone to the sort of, you know,

[22:28] Photoshop, it was just, I think, for companies,

[22:30] trying to, you know, going through a recession,

[22:33] maybe, and just the companies trying to save a little money

[22:36] on budgets, I think it was a quicker, you know,

[22:40] and acceptable at the time way for companies to, you know,

[22:44] to do it, I hated it.

[22:45] I was like, this is, you know, what happened to you,

[22:47] you know, what happened to you, you know?

[22:49] My artwork that I loved, you know, but anyways,

[22:53] we got the helicopter's game.

[22:54] We had it at a car show, and I had a Texas James set field

[22:58] from Metallica and said, hey man,

[22:59] I'm gonna be at the Bill of Proof Car Show,

[23:01] I'm bringing the game.

[23:02] I mean, those guys are always on tour and stuff,

[23:04] and actually taking that game and bringing it to the studio,

[23:07] just it wouldn't, you know, it was just too hard to, you know,

[23:10] make that happen.

[23:11] And so we, I was like, I'm gonna have the pinball machine

[23:16] at the Bill of Proof, and so James, he came to my booth

[23:20] and he checked it out, and he's like, yeah,

[23:21] I wanna own a Metallica one.

[23:23] So that's when we met Tanya Klice, and, you know,

[23:27] he had people were like, he can't reprogram old games,

[23:30] he just can't be done, you know,

[23:31] and Tanya figured out a way to do it.

[23:32] So he put Metallica music and reprogrammed it.

[23:36] So, you know, it's very similar to what you hear these days,

[23:38] you know, like what you're hearing now in modern games.

[23:42] And that was, yeah, I think people saw that game

[23:47] and took note, you know, and Tanya now works for Stern,

[23:49] and you know, I'm doing art for Stern, and pretty cool.

[23:52] So you made a Metallica custom pin right before

[23:57] you made the Stern Metallica pin.

[23:59] Yeah, I did, I did a few years before, yeah,

[24:01] that's actually in my book.

[24:02] And is it a one off, or did you make more than one of those?

[24:06] We made one machine, and that machine was on,

[24:09] and that was on an Earth shaker.

[24:12] We found an old trashed Earth shaker,

[24:14] and you know, Wade and company had said stripped it down,

[24:18] and you know, done their resto work on it.

[24:21] And, you know, we stood, again, we stenciled the side,

[24:24] screen print in the glass, and my hand painted play field,

[24:26] and then that's when we met Tanya,

[24:27] and he worked his wizardry on the, you know,

[24:30] it's the first game that I had heard that had, you know,

[24:33] MP3s or whatever music playing, you know,

[24:35] and the music would change out, like, you know,

[24:37] programmed like, you know, like you play game today.

[24:40] It was like the first room, you know, game, again,

[24:43] which totally made sense to me, you know,

[24:45] because when I play games like in my house,

[24:47] and I've all zoned games and stuff,

[24:48] and when I would play it, I put a record on, you know,

[24:52] listen to rock and roll, listen to music, whatever, you know.

[24:54] Right, right.

[24:55] Yeah, I'm looking at the pictures of it now.

[24:57] It's very cool.

[24:58] So who, sort of James take possession of that machine?

[25:02] Yeah, James owns it.

[25:03] It's in his house.

[25:04] He, we made it for him, and he let us display it

[25:09] at the Pacific Pinball Expo on Free Play for people.

[25:13] So people got to check it out for a weekend,

[25:16] and then he lent it to me again for my solo arc show,

[25:19] a cop rog gallery in San Monica about six years ago.

[25:22] And, you know, now it's this part of his private collection.

[25:25] So we, you know, bug them anymore.

[25:27] Right, right.

[25:28] So, okay, so you make this machine,

[25:31] and people within the pinball sort of industry

[25:34] start to take notice.

[25:36] How, what was the chain of events

[25:38] with you making the Stern machine?

[25:41] Did Stern go to Metallica?

[25:43] Metallica is like, if we're gonna do our machine,

[25:46] I want Donnie to do it.

[25:48] Exactly, but Stern turns out we're also, apparently,

[25:54] also wanting to work with me,

[25:56] because they had seen my custom games

[25:59] and my artwork and my first book and, you know,

[26:01] all the stuff.

[26:03] So when I got the phone call from Stern,

[26:06] they were like, yeah, so like, hey,

[26:07] we're doing a Metallica pinball.

[26:08] I'm like, oh, that's awesome.

[26:10] And they're like, yeah, do you want to do it?

[26:11] Because we want to work with you.

[26:12] And Metallica said, like, you got to be the artist.

[26:14] So I was like, I was like, oh, man,

[26:17] I can't believe I'm getting this phone call.

[26:18] It's happening, you know, like, right.

[26:20] So, you know, they're like, can you do it?

[26:21] Can you handle this?

[26:22] I'm like, oh, no problem.

[26:23] You know, I got this, you know, and, but I was all,

[26:26] I mean, there was a lot of weight on my shoulders,

[26:28] because there hadn't been a, you know,

[26:30] aside from the Marvel, you know, comic games,

[26:33] there hadn't been, you know, like a, like a hand-drawn

[26:37] pinball in a long time, you know.

[26:40] So I had that.

[26:41] I had to, I had to, I had to hit it off with Stern.

[26:45] I had to impress Metallica fans,

[26:47] which is a really tough thing to do.

[26:49] And I had to, I had to, you've been press the band,

[26:53] you know, I had to, you know, there's so many

[26:55] pinball fans, you know, I had, there's so many elements.

[26:58] So I had so much weight on my shoulders.

[26:59] And then like, I know Metallica fans, you know,

[27:01] and I know the band, I know what they expect.

[27:03] They have high expectations.

[27:05] You know, Stern's a new client, and, you know,

[27:07] they probably have high expectations as well.

[27:10] Right.

[27:10] And then, you know, pinball fans are,

[27:12] we're crazy bunch, you know, like we are very picky.

[27:16] And, so.

[27:17] Yeah.

[27:17] Yeah.

[27:18] That's an understatement.

[27:19] What's that?

[27:20] That's an understatement that pinball people are picky.

[27:23] So, Donnie, the years, it's, look, it's 2013.

[27:28] Now, when did, that's when the game came out.

[27:29] When did you start working on Metallica with, with John

[27:33] Borrigan Stern?

[27:34] I don't remember exactly the dates, but I'm pretty sure I worked

[27:40] on that game for about six months.

[27:43] And I had done, you know, the, the different,

[27:45] the different versions of it.

[27:47] And there had been, you know, a few changes here and there.

[27:50] So there was like a lot of drawing, and it was sort of like,

[27:53] you know, sort of like a, it was a new thing for all of us,

[27:55] I think, you know, everybody involved.

[27:58] And Greg Ferris had just gotten hired.

[28:01] So he wasn't not the art director yet.

[28:03] It was another guy.

[28:04] So, you know, my second time around, we'll talk about that

[28:07] after I'm sure, but doing, you know,

[28:08] Aerosmith, when I, when I got, you know, talking to Greg,

[28:13] you know, he was like, he had a whole system in place.

[28:15] It was really cool, you know, EZR director.

[28:17] And it was very cool to work with him, you know,

[28:19] and it was a lot easier, a lot smoother the second time around.

[28:22] Not that it was rocky the first time around.

[28:24] And just we were all, like, you know, we're all kind of,

[28:26] you know, kind of, I guess, you know, bushwacken and,

[28:29] and, and, you know, making new ground.

[28:33] Right, right.

[28:34] Well, yeah, and because there really wasn't any sort of

[28:38] hand-drawn art happening at all at Stern at this time.

[28:40] So, Donnie, talk us through like the process.

[28:43] Like, what are the steps you go through making a pinball machine?

[28:48] Let's start with Metallica,

[28:49] because it might have been a little bit different with Aerosmith.

[28:51] So, are you working with the designer

[28:53] and you get the layout for the play field?

[28:55] Do you start with the play field?

[28:56] Do you start with the cabinet?

[28:57] Do you start with the back box?

[28:58] Like, how do you, how do you approach it?

[29:00] Like, what's, what are the steps?

[29:02] Like, walk us through it as if we know nothing

[29:03] about applying artwork to a pinball machine.

[29:06] Gotcha. Well, basically, I start with the back glass,

[29:10] you know, that, we'll start with one glass

[29:12] and that's sort of like the, the key piece

[29:14] and everything sort of trickles down from there.

[29:18] With Stern, they're doing, you know,

[29:20] generally three to four back glasses, you know.

[29:22] So, usually three and with Metallica, so we did.

[29:27] So, I have my work cut out for me as far as back glasses go.

[29:30] And I'll jump around till I'll do a back glass

[29:32] and then maybe work on some cabinets and stuff.

[29:34] So, cabinet and back glasses is, is generally just, you know,

[29:38] I mean, bouncing it back to a, to drag back and forth.

[29:43] And, you know, while John is coming up with the game design

[29:46] and the play field goes, I do the play field dead last.

[29:49] That's the last thing I do.

[29:50] And then usually the plastics will go over top of that

[29:52] and the stickers and stuff, but it's usually like that

[29:55] will set, we'll come later.

[29:56] Is there a reason for that, Donnie?

[29:58] Like, sort of like, you're creating the framework

[30:01] of where the play field will sit first

[30:03] so that that art sort of, well, then,

[30:06] the game might design yet, you know.

[30:07] So, I mean, these are built 100% from scratch.

[30:10] Right.

[30:11] So, like, you know, I mean, there is no play field to draw

[30:14] because you don't know where the lights are yet.

[30:15] You don't know where the ramps are.

[30:16] So, those, that's coming into place, you know.

[30:18] So, I'm seeing roughs of it from John, you know, like,

[30:21] this is, it's pretty cool.

[30:22] You know, we're back and forth, we're on the phone.

[30:24] Like, he's showing me what he's up to.

[30:25] I'm like, oh, that's cool, that's cool.

[30:26] And then when he's ready, you know, when he's got it to a point

[30:29] where I get to start putting art on it,

[30:30] that's when, you know, we start talking about,

[30:32] you know, play field art.

[30:33] And then, yeah, it's really the reason why

[30:35] the artwork on the play field goes last is

[30:36] because there is no play field, you know.

[30:38] Right.

[30:39] How many different revisions to a back glass or a cabinet

[30:43] do you normally go through?

[30:44] Like, how many hours in total?

[30:45] I think we always speculate how long it takes

[30:47] an artist to do this stuff.

[30:48] How much time do you normally spend applying the artwork

[30:53] or sort of going through the different drafts

[30:55] to get to the final?

[30:57] Well, you know, kind of depends with the, with the Aerosmith,

[31:00] there wasn't, there wasn't a whole lot of revisions, you know.

[31:03] We, it was really smooth, you know.

[31:04] We had a couple of, you know, Greg, you know,

[31:08] Greg and, uh, Erser Greg and I had done a few,

[31:10] a few, you know, minor, you know, adjustments to, you know,

[31:13] here and there and then, you know,

[31:14] there had been some back and forth with the band,

[31:17] but it wasn't, it was really smooth, you know.

[31:19] And I was even Tyler wanted to have more sins on the play field,

[31:23] like, I had some cigarette butts and some stuff,

[31:25] some cards and dice from, you know,

[31:30] various, you know, Aerosmith songs and he was like,

[31:34] yeah, I'm more of that.

[31:35] I'm like, well, that's no problem at all.

[31:36] You know, I said, you know, an hour later, boom, there you go.

[31:39] You know, and he was like, that's, you know,

[31:41] but he apparently loved the artwork and, you know,

[31:44] with, it's different with Metallica.

[31:46] It's like, I actually know Metallica with Aerosmith.

[31:48] Like, I don't know Aerosmith, so, you know,

[31:49] it's going through chains, you know, and, and you gotta,

[31:52] you gotta realize, see these bands are like,

[31:54] I mean, they're, they're fucking huge, you know.

[31:56] Yeah, they're busy.

[31:57] Really, really busy.

[31:58] Yeah, they're very busy, yeah.

[31:59] So, you know, to do a pimp on the,

[32:01] I was like, you're a school thing, but, you know,

[32:03] I mean, they're, they're, they're, you know,

[32:05] right. So when you were doing Metallica,

[32:06] because you knew James and, and the guys over there,

[32:10] were you sharing with, with James, what you were cooking up,

[32:13] and it sort of as you were developing it?

[32:16] Nope.

[32:16] No, I, I actually was, you know, I was under contract with

[32:21] Stern, so I was, I, she had been doing art for Metallica for,

[32:26] at that point, it was probably about, maybe 10 years or so,

[32:30] and I know what they like and what they want.

[32:33] I'd done so much stuff for them, you know.

[32:35] So, you know, when they had me do it, it was,

[32:38] I just knew what to do.

[32:39] They trusted you after a decade of, of, of doing their art, okay.

[32:43] Exactly.

[32:44] And there's just so much going on to, to throw that in the mix, too.

[32:47] And I left that up to Stern, you know, because I was under

[32:50] contract with Stern, so, you know, I didn't want to be like,

[32:52] calling them, being like, hey, check this out, and then,

[32:54] you know, they have changed.

[32:55] It's just what it caused problems, you know.

[32:57] Right.

[32:58] No problems, but it would have been like, it just would have,

[33:00] it would have made the process, it could have made the

[33:03] process harder.

[33:05] Right.

[33:06] Now, now, when, and they're busy, too, you know, like,

[33:09] they don't need to see anything till it's totally done,

[33:11] and then, you know, we can make changes once it's all finished,

[33:13] you know, it would just be new, since I'm sure.

[33:15] So, did, did you work on the scopes as well from, from Metallica?

[33:20] Like, I saw you did some sketches of Sparky.

[33:23] So, the different toys are actually on the game itself.

[33:25] Oh, yeah, yeah, totally.

[33:27] Yeah, yeah, I did, like, turn around and complete rendering,

[33:31] renderings of all the toys, and then off they went to their

[33:35] sculpture, and, you know, we, we didn't have a lot of changes,

[33:39] like, it came back really, I mean, Sparky, like, exactly,

[33:41] how I drawn him, you know, like, I did side versions, and,

[33:44] you know, a lot of specs for, for the, you know, the sculpture,

[33:49] and sculpture did an amazing job, same with Jackie, you know,

[33:52] on the, the arosmith, like, the toy box, yeah.

[33:56] And that was exactly what I envisioned, you know,

[33:58] it's like, yeah, this is it, you know.

[33:59] So, when, when you finished working with, from, from A to Z,

[34:03] how long, did it take Stern to make the Metallica

[34:07] pinball machine?

[34:08] Is it a year in development?

[34:09] Is it two years?

[34:10] Are you brought in at the last, like, six months?

[34:13] Like, what is, I, I'm, I'm brought in at the very beginning,

[34:16] and, you know, we all sort of start going at it, like,

[34:19] we have a team.

[34:20] You know, this is the programmer, the game designer,

[34:23] and then there's, you know, there's a lot of other people, you know,

[34:25] that are involved.

[34:27] And with Metallica, I believe, I believe from when I started working on it,

[34:32] and I think I started working on it in, like, the September,

[34:36] and I think it came out in, like, June.

[34:39] So, that was pretty fast with arosmith, because of their new,

[34:43] their new screen, there was, I mean, the screen's basically brand new,

[34:48] so there was a little bit of delay.

[34:49] So, you know, I actually finished the, I mean, it's coming out right now,

[34:53] but I finished the artwork March of last year, March of 2016.

[34:59] Well, before we, I definitely want to talk about arosmith,

[35:03] because it's like the new baby, it's just shipping right now,

[35:06] and people are really excited about the pin.

[35:08] When Metallica came out, and, you know, you never know,

[35:12] you never know if a pinball machine, if all the pieces are going to come together,

[35:16] right, if the code, the artwork, right, the gameplay, Metallica comes out,

[35:23] and what, what was like the initial feedback you were getting

[35:27] when people first saw the machine?

[35:28] Was it, were people just, like, blown away,

[35:31] were they super excited to see finally some great hand drawn artwork returning to pinball?

[35:37] Um, yeah, you know, it was, it was crazy, because I just,

[35:40] I wasn't expecting it, you know, I wasn't expecting the, the, the response,

[35:44] you know, I was, I was kind of like, okay, you know, the games coming out and,

[35:47] cool, you know, and then it started shipping, and, and they started kind of popping up here and there.

[35:51] And then, you know, but people started jumping out the window, you know,

[35:54] they were like, I was getting like, like, emails and like,

[35:57] you know, it was just, it was insane, and that's when people started to,

[36:00] um, a lot of the pinball expos were like, hey, do you want to come and be a guest?

[36:05] And I was like, absolutely, I would love to be a guest, you know, so,

[36:09] I started, you know, traveling a lot, and, you know, I,

[36:12] pretty much, you know, three years until I wrote Smith, you know,

[36:16] there was like Metallica, Metallica, Metallica, you know, people were still stoked on it.

[36:20] And, uh, I just didn't realize the response, I was really stoked, you know,

[36:24] how the response was, like, people were, were very kind and very cool, you know, I mean,

[36:29] one of the lot haters, you know, people dug the game, you know, and John Bork hit it out of the park,

[36:33] it was a, it's a really fun to play a game, you know, and I think, uh,

[36:37] I think it looks really pretty and, uh, programming's awesome, like, lemon sheets, you know,

[36:40] into the great job and yeah, because Metallica, Metallica continues to be, um,

[36:48] held up is one of the best storm pinball machines of all time. And I think it's got to be really

[36:52] satisfying, right, to, to, to have your artwork on something that has been, it's still selling,

[36:58] Metallica. Like, I, I think it's still online. Yeah, yeah, it's crazy. It's cool.

[37:04] There, and I get, I get texts and messages from like friends all over the world saying, like,

[37:10] bands on tour, got a friends of mine, they're like, I'm in Australia and they got a Metallica at the

[37:14] bar, you know, another friend was like, yeah, they got one of these at the airport and I'm like,

[37:17] what the airport? And I just all over the world, you know, and people in my hometown are like,

[37:22] yeah, they got like a Metallica at the movie theater and there's one at the store and there's like,

[37:25] you know, one at the bar, Katie and I'm like, whoa, like, it's really nice. It's really nice to,

[37:30] um, you know, I've been doing, uh, you know, it's been 20 years for me full time and to have that,

[37:35] to have a piece of artwork, like, make it around the world like that is really satisfying, you know.

[37:40] Why does it also got to be as an artist too? These items too, they're, they're collectibles for a

[37:46] lot of people around the world and people are waxing them and cleaning them and preserving your

[37:52] artwork for all eternity, right? So these, these, these machines, you know, it's not like a t-shirt

[37:58] that over time is going to get worn out and eventually like tossed away, like these, these

[38:03] machines are going to be around for decades. So it's got to be really rewarding knowing that your

[38:08] art is on one of the most successful Stern Pimbal machines of all time. Um, so then you get the,

[38:14] you get, when do you get word that the next thing Stern has lined up for you as Aerosmith?

[38:21] Sorry, Siddheline. When did you get, when did you realize your next, um, assignment was going to be

[38:26] Aerosmith after Metallica? Um, we had been talking about doing a Pim, you know, since that summer

[38:34] that Metallica was launching and, and, you know, they were like, wow, it's, it's doing so great. It's

[38:38] awesome. And, you know, they've just been, they've been talk and, um, you know, finally it was like,

[38:43] I got the call, he's like, all right, you know, it's, it's, we got green lights. It's going to be

[38:47] Aerosmith. Do you want to do it? I'm like, yes, uh, 70s rock. Amazing, you know, I like Aerosmith,

[38:54] I like 70s, I like all music, right? I like everything, but, um, um, I, you know, I think Aerosmith's

[38:59] pretty rad and, and they're, uh, I mean, you know, think of like, like first, first off, I'm like,

[39:03] days to confused the parking lot scene, the opening scene with the GTO, driving through the parking lot,

[39:08] like sweet emotion. You know, it's like, so rad, you know, 70s rock. So, so I was like, yeah, I,

[39:14] I want to do this, you know, I want to do this. And it's, it's a band. It's super cool. Like, um,

[39:18] I'm, I'm going to get into it and, and try to make Aerosmith, like, try to make this, like, look,

[39:24] as cool as possible, you know, and, and I also, you know, I had been a few years since I've done

[39:28] Metallica and, you know, I feel as an artist that, you know, you grow and one of my things is to not

[39:33] stop growing, to keep learning and to keep trying to better myself and, you know, I'm, you know,

[39:38] not get lazy and not get too comfortable and just like, you know, keep, keep trying to slam it,

[39:42] you know, slam that ball out of the park. And so I tried to, I tried to, you know, I tried to up it,

[39:48] I tried to, you know, do everything that, you know, you know, like looking at Metallica, like,

[39:54] three years earlier, I was like, I really want to make this, you know, like, I'm going to try to

[39:57] make it better, you know. So people think it's better, but, you know, I, I wanted to make a really

[40:02] pretty game, you know, I wanted to really get in there and, you know, kind of a nod to the

[40:07] traditional pinball artists, like Gordon Morrison and Dave Christianson, you know, I really wanted to,

[40:11] you know, make that play field, like, just put, like, little tiny details everywhere, you know, so,

[40:17] I was like, you know, GM are in there. Right. And I was just about to say that I'm looking at the

[40:22] back glass and just the level of detail that is in this game is just phenomenal. And I think that's,

[40:29] that's one of the things that you only can really achieve with, with the hand drawn artwork,

[40:35] are those little sort of like Easter egg and detailed items that, that just make it such a joy

[40:39] to look over the machine, right? As much as it's fun to play, you can, you're always finding like

[40:44] new things that are sort of hidden here and hidden there in the artwork, which is just incredible.

[40:50] Now, was the process of working with Greg on Aerosmith, how, how is that different than Metallica?

[40:55] Was it a little bit more streamlined with Greg on board? Oh, yeah, it was great. Just to, just to kind

[41:00] of recap what you're talking about, there are some Easter eggs on, on Aerosmith and I'm going to

[41:06] reveal some of them, I'm doing a vlog. It's called Donny TV and I haven't launched yet. I got

[41:11] about eight episodes in there, like little four minute episodes and I'm going to be launching it,

[41:15] either this summer or September. So I'll, you know, I'll just check out my Facebook and check

[41:20] out my website and it'll all be on YouTube and Facebook and, and, and, and all that everywhere,

[41:25] you know, kind of thing. I'm going to do, I plan to do a little mini episode on, on Easter eggs.

[41:30] So, um, but, uh, so sorry, your question again, it was about, uh, uh, working with Greg.

[41:36] Yeah, so when Greg came on board, you were, you were mentioning when you did Metallica, Greg

[41:40] wasn't there yet and does Greg, does Greg have a certain process of working with artists and,

[41:47] is it, was it different working on Aerosmith than it was on Metallica when, once Greg was part of

[41:52] the stern sort of family? Yeah, yeah, definitely, you know, because Greg, Greg's done a lot of games,

[41:57] you know, Greg is a pinball artist, you know, and he's one of the grades, you know, so, I mean, he

[42:01] knows, he knows what we have to go through and he's been working in the industry. So he knows how

[42:06] everybody works, you know, he, he's the perfect buffer. He's like basically the guy that, you know,

[42:12] we, we report to you. Um, so it was really cool. It was, uh, it was, uh, it was, uh, when Greg, you

[42:17] know, had a suggestion, it was like it's Greg for Aerosmith's suggestion, you know, is what he's

[42:21] talking about. This is cool, you know, a guy respecting him, you know, so also a long way to do it.

[42:26] It was very cool. It was just smooth and, yeah, they had, they had a really good system in place

[42:30] by that point, you know, and they'd work with, uh, you know, zombie Eddie and a couple of other people.

[42:34] And so they had, uh, they had a nice system in place for, you know, hiring freelancers and stuff.

[42:39] Right. I mean, I'm just, I'm, I'm like looking at Aerosmith right now and just the level of details

[42:46] and the coloring in this, in this machine. It's, it's just gorgeous. And what, what's gotta be

[42:52] satisfying to Donnie is when, when Stern announced Aerosmith, right? I think Aerosmith is a little bit,

[42:59] a little bit more of a guilty pleasure rock and roll band for some people than maybe Metallica.

[43:04] And, and there was a lot of like, I don't know if Aerosmith is gonna do well. I don't know if I buy

[43:09] that pinball machine. I think it had a little bit more skepticism going in than Metallica.

[43:14] Oh, it's really, absolutely. And, well, and it's like, if you look at the album sales of Aerosmith,

[43:20] though, they're ginormous. I think they, I think they about sold Metallica in terms of albums,

[43:27] in the States. I might, but they might be different genre. See, it's always weird because it's like

[43:31] hard rock. There's metal. There's, so I think Aerosmith is one, I think is the best-selling

[43:38] rock and roll band in US history. I might, yeah, they're different genres for sure too. You know,

[43:44] and I mean, I, James Hatt will listen to Aerosmith when he was a kid. Yeah, they've been around forever.

[43:49] He was a kid. Yeah, and Metallica, you know, they're, they're a metal band, they're a thrash band,

[43:53] they're, you know, they've carved out their own deal. So it's definitely, I mean, they're all

[43:58] it's all rock and roll, right? But, no, so there's skepticism when the game is announced, right? And then

[44:06] you know, Batman came out, people fell in love with Ghostbusters. And Aerosmith was sort of like,

[44:13] you know, Star Wars has been the worst kept secret out there. So Aerosmith sort of got slotted in.

[44:19] Were you nervous at all that sort of, there was so much hype before, before it came out,

[44:24] and also all the anticipation for Star Wars that people were just going to sort of

[44:29] ignore it in some way or look past it and you had put all this work into it? Well, you never know,

[44:35] you know, you never know what's going to happen. You can put all this work into something in a

[44:37] cabong, you know, you just, you just never know, you know, but my thing is I just try my best. And,

[44:42] you know, they, I think the reason why they hired me was because they knew they wanted this game

[44:47] to look cool. They wanted, you know, because Aerosmith is cool, but I think that it could have

[44:54] not been a cool game, you know, I think that that could have very easily gone south. And I'm stoked

[44:59] that they hired me. And, you know, I, I was my goal was to like, I want to make, I want to, like,

[45:04] Aerosmith's already cool, but I want to make this game look cool. I want to make them look cool,

[45:07] you know, so they're on back last and they don't look douchey, you know, they look cool, you know,

[45:11] right? It's the most you come, it's like, yeah, this is rock and roll, dude, I'm driving my muscle

[45:15] car and it's like, listen to it. Aerosmith tickets this summer, you know, it's a hotest event

[45:20] summer kind of thing. So that vibe, you know, keep it down. Yeah, I mean, you can't, you're like

[45:24] that, like, that could have gone south, you know, well, yeah, I mean, you capture that cool, like,

[45:30] almost like psychedelic, like, 70s, like, cool vibe for the band. And, you know, imagine,

[45:35] I imagine if this game looked like Photoshop art, I mean, I'd look like, let's just take

[45:40] example, ACDC. It would have been fucking horrible, dude. Yeah, it would have been terrible. Like,

[45:46] you know, like, ACDC is a great game, but there's nobody out there who doesn't wish ACDC had

[45:52] an art package like Metallica or Aerosmith, right? So I think art, I've said it, I've said it a

[45:59] million times on this podcast, I think art is the most important thing on a pinball machine.

[46:08] And I explain why. Games can be great. Like, and this is, this is coming from a guy,

[46:14] Donnie, who's got a magic girl, right? I've got Zombie Yeti's labor of love. Oh,

[46:17] yeah, right on. That's a beautiful looking game. It's like gorgeous. The game doesn't even work.

[46:22] Like, it doesn't, you know, John never finished the, the engineering of it, but because it's so

[46:28] beautiful, it stands almost alone as a work of art. And I think, look, half of the people out

[46:34] there who buy pinball machines, we all play them. But there's such an enjoyment from looking at a

[46:39] machine. And when you're looking down while you're playing, the more detail, the more artwork,

[46:47] the, it's such a more special experience than if what you're looking at, you know, just feels kind

[46:53] of flat or feels kind of sterile. Yeah, you're talking to somebody who comes from the school of

[46:58] pinball, you know, I mean, like, I schooled, I never went to art school, but I read a lot, you

[47:03] know, I collect, you know, old artwork books that I dug through pinball stuff for years, you know,

[47:08] just like studying, gave Christians some studying Gordon Morrison, you know, just going through that

[47:13] and just, you know, staring at it and staring at it, you know, just like, why is this so cool? And,

[47:18] you know, why is this so special? And it is. And owning those games too, exactly, you know, it's

[47:22] like, it's magic. It's, it's part, it's a huge part of the soul of pinball, you know?

[47:27] In your mind, what, what's your favorite art package on a pin ever?

[47:34] Nitro Ground Shaker, Dave Christensen, I own it. I like, I like scared stiff, you know,

[47:41] El Vira, Grig Ferres. You know, I like a lot of Gordon Morrison's pinball machines. I like,

[47:48] I love all the dead Christensen games and, I mean, there's so many, there's so many good ones,

[47:54] you know, there's just so many good ones. Right. It's, it's crazy. How is that Pacific pinball

[47:59] yesterday? Michael, she's, is, is, his warehouse in Alameda. And I did a, actually a little piece

[48:05] on my blog, did a little piece on his, what he's got going on. And, you know, he's got, I think,

[48:09] 1300 games there. And, you know, I just, you know, walking through and getting to stare at them. It's,

[48:14] you know, just so cool. Do you think I'm missing some games for sure? Like, I'm missing like, you

[48:20] know, what are my favorite games? But those are definitely two of my favorite games. Right.

[48:24] For sure. So I think Stern found a really good balance. And it was interesting, Donnie, when you

[48:28] said you start with the back box first. And the, there's this whole new sort of like LCD error

[48:35] happening now with pinball, where some manufacturers are, are eating up a lot of the artistic real estate

[48:42] with, with a screen, right. And it, and Stern worked hard. And we heard George Gomez talk a lot

[48:47] about how the pinball backlash is still something that you have to cherish. Like, you can't lose it.

[48:53] That's the red cover, dude. You know, right. That's your LP cover, you know. Yeah. And, and

[48:59] nobody wants games in your house or in a bar or somewhere and you've got it turned on in the

[49:04] corner. I mean, that's what you look. That's what you see when the game's not being played. You know,

[49:07] it's huge. Right. So when you see these new games coming out with these 27 inch LCDs, just

[49:13] eating up the whole backlash, we just saw, um, Alien revealed Brian Allen did artwork for the Alien

[49:20] 35th anniversary game, beautiful hand drawn backlash, right. And, and if you put the screen there,

[49:28] it just like, it destroys the entire art. Um, I think it's got to work out pretty good with

[49:34] their new, their new system. I mean, it takes up about a quarter of the, you know, the glass area,

[49:39] but I mean, the glass is still, you know, the, the, it's still there and big, you know, it's still

[49:43] totally like looks like a pinball. And then there's enough room, you know, I think they, they got the

[49:46] perfect balance, you know, so they're able to get in there. And then there's a lot of speaker room,

[49:50] you know, like, and those speakers look pretty cool. So, you know, I was, I was like, you know,

[49:55] I can, I was like, you know, this game's still going to look like super cool as, you know, it's not

[50:00] getting in the way. So, right. Did you, Dany, did you do the animations on Aerospace?

[50:05] No, no, I, um, the artwork I did for the game was, uh, the art package, when I would hand it in,

[50:12] that was made available to, uh, the department at Stern that was in charge of the animation.

[50:18] Um, so, uh, you know, I'd done basically like, you know, like, given, you know, my wings and, uh,

[50:23] the logos and stuff like that, you know, but the animation wasn't not done by me. I was busy doing

[50:27] the artwork. So, um, that was a whole other team and, and, you know, that's a huge undertaking. So,

[50:33] you know, it would have been fun to get in on that, but I honestly like, I was so busy, you know,

[50:38] right. Right. That I was just like, I had got you, you know, the three cabinets and, and the playfield

[50:43] and the plastics and the back glass and the variations and changes and decals and, you know, just the

[50:49] list goes on and on, you know, and, and so busy, you know, but, uh, well, we've said on this podcast

[50:54] many times and I, I walked out of Texas Pimball Festival saying this, you know, we see all the new

[51:00] games out there and you hear a lot about how expensive Pimball machines are becoming these days.

[51:07] The best bang for the buck has to be Aerosmith Pro for $5,200. You get, it's amazing. You get the

[51:15] LCD, you get the hand drawn artwork, you get an iconic theme, you get the great music, you get a great

[51:21] sound system in the game. Um, and it's hard, it was really hard for me to justify games costing

[51:28] almost twice that much considering what you get with this package. And I think, Don, you've really

[51:33] raised the bar. I think even above Metallica with your artwork on Aerosmith. So I just want to say,

[51:41] like, you knocked it out of the park and I think the feedback you're getting from people now mirrors

[51:47] that that people people love this game. They're, they're, I've heard nothing but positive things about

[51:52] Aerosmith. Oh, good. Oh, that's good to hear. That's good to hear. I, you know, I haven't really,

[51:56] you know, been checking it. I don't really want to look at the message boards and I, you know,

[52:01] I just kind of hear from people at the shows and I haven't been to a show in about a month. So

[52:06] my next show is Southern Fried, Southern Fried Gaming Expo. I'll be a guest at that. But that's

[52:13] great to hear, man. That's great. I'm, I'm stoked. I mean, I think it's, I think it's better than Metallica,

[52:18] you know, for a few reasons. And, you know, I tried my best on Metallica, but, you know, I, I,

[52:23] know, I've grown as an artist in the last three years. And, you know, and I, I applaud myself, like,

[52:28] you know, just as hard as I did on Metallica, I was, you know, 110%. But, you know, this, this,

[52:32] this time around, I was, I was, you know, I knew what to expect. So I was able to, I was able to,

[52:41] put my, uh, uh, manage my time better, you know. Right. Well, it looks, it looks incredible.

[52:47] You've raised the bar. You've got a little more on it. I was able to spend extra time on it, you know,

[52:53] right. Well, you've raised the bar on your, on your own sort of pinball skill. So what's,

[52:59] what's next in terms of are you on to a third game? Are you sort of on, on a holding pattern right

[53:04] now, Stern? Yeah, I do. I'm working on Kevin and Costner Waterworld. Dude, it's about time.

[53:11] That's what I tell everybody, because everyone's like, what are you doing now? I'm like, uh,

[53:14] Waterworld, dude, what else, you know, yeah, I know there's a million titles that could be cool. And

[53:18] no, we're talking about doing stuff. Um, you know, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

[53:22] You know, maybe I'm working on something. I'm not, you know, I can't really talk about it. But, um,

[53:26] can you, can you make a big trouble in little China pinball machine? Please, somebody,

[53:30] meet somebody out there. What's your, what's your game that you'd want to see? I mean, if I,

[53:35] I mean, big trouble in little China, I think we'd be great. I would love a garden to the galaxy.

[53:39] I just saw that the, the new movie, you know, it was incredible. I think, yeah, yeah.

[53:45] Um, I mean, personally, because I'm a canada, I would love an Akira pinball machine.

[53:51] And what my dream though would be Transformers, do you, Transformers the movie, the, the, the original movie

[53:58] was the music like Stan Bush and I can't watch them. I was like, it looks like a guy with a jogging suit

[54:08] that he, any, any sprayed glue all over himself and rolled in a bunch of smashed up VCR parts.

[54:13] I can't take it. But I'm a horrible and Michael Bay just like signed on for like four more. It's

[54:18] just, he's ruined my childhood like in everything he touches and he's ruined into turtles. He's

[54:23] ruined Transformers. Um, but yeah, the original G1 like I, I, I, that, the music, the art, everything

[54:31] about that was just perfect to me. Um, but, Donnie, what are your thoughts about like just pinball

[54:37] in general? I mean, you're a big pinball fan. When you look out at what's coming out in the pinball

[54:42] world, um, what's, what stuff out there has got you excited? And you know, besides the stuff that,

[54:47] I know you, you probably know so much of what's going on with Stern. Um, is there anything else

[54:51] out there that you're just like, wow, that's really cool. What they did over here or any other art

[54:56] packages out there that you're like, that, that game is just gorgeous. I would, I would love to

[55:00] own one of those one day. I like to see all the homebrew companies and, you know, uh, starting,

[55:06] starting up, you know, I love seeing that there's all these companies popping up and we're seeing

[55:10] more and more games that shows. I think it's great. You know, and I think, uh, through the whole

[55:14] barcade, you know, phenomenon that's going on is amazing. It's, it's, it's, it's just, you know,

[55:19] it's like, it's the way it should be. You know, it's very, it's very cool. And I just remember being,

[55:23] you know, and just into pinball and there's like, there's a good, you know, like a 10-year chunk,

[55:27] where it's like, was this gonna, what's gonna happen with this? Is this gonna get big? And,

[55:31] you know, just, it was the same for a long time. You know, like there's pinball expose and,

[55:35] you know, I go to them and, and uh, people were like, this is so much fun. This is so cool. And like,

[55:39] like, finally, it's like catching on, you know, so, um, it's very cool to see. Um, I, I like the big

[55:43] libouski game a lot. I think that's cool game. You know, I loved the own one of those at some point,

[55:48] you know, so would the people who also paid for that game years?

[55:52] Uh-oh. Can worms? Do you know what happened with, do you know what's going on with that? So,

[55:56] you know, um, well, just long story really short. Um, they're in a dispute right now with the

[56:03] manufacturer. They, they're contract manufacturing them. And like 50 got shipped. And then

[56:10] there's just a dispute going on with how much they owe the contract manufacturer. So,

[56:15] basically, there's like 40 games sitting in, in boxes in the Netherlands that are built

[56:20] that have been sitting there for like eight months. And so, yeah.

[56:25] All right. So we were talking, um, libouski is one that you'd love to own. I think that's,

[56:31] that's a gorgeous pin. I mean, the bowling alley feature underneath it is one of the coolest

[56:35] things I've ever seen in a pinball game. Um, yeah, the Photoshop ain't actually that bad. You know,

[56:41] like, I've got past it. And it's just a nice game, you know? Well, and the thing too about Photoshop

[56:47] art, because I think that's something that it does get like, yeah, it gets like a horrible,

[56:53] it gets a horrible bad rap. But if you could look at a game like the Hobbit,

[56:57] it looks great. All Photoshopped. Um, it's just a matter of how much effort you put into, you know,

[57:05] what you do with the computer when you lay everything out. I mean, you can do a lot with, with assets and

[57:12] yeah, and computers these days. Um, so, Donnie, do you have, do you have a collection of pinball machines

[57:18] and arcades in your house right now? Well, I've, I've owned quite a few and right now, I just got my

[57:24] can crusher in the mail. So I got it, uh, came last week and, uh, Matt and Sean from Free Gold Watch came

[57:31] down to help me set it up. So it's gonna be on the vlog as well, the unboxing of McCann Crusher.

[57:36] So yeah, I have a Nitro Grandshaker, a Metallica and a Can Crusher and, um, I sold my, I had a

[57:41] Twilight Zone that I sold and I had a, uh, a pirate party monsters that I, uh, I sold as well

[57:47] to make room for, you know, Erasmith and, uh, and Can Crusher. I only have room right now for four

[57:53] in my living room for pinballs and I also sold up all my arcade games. Um, yeah, I just, you know,

[57:59] just I'm in San Francisco and I collect other stuff too, like I know just I'm not just pinball,

[58:04] you know, I have like a, a few old cars and, you know, I got a lot of toys and, and records and stuff.

[58:09] So, you know, I've got to kind of balance everything, you know, I can't go too crazy. So, but probably

[58:14] going to move at some point pretty soon and, uh, get a bigger place, um, maybe a country and, uh,

[58:21] I'll, I'll be able to do that. How about a little arcade on the side? Kind of deal.

[58:25] We, we sound like, like twins right now. I mean, I have it, I have it in arcade collection,

[58:30] a toy collection. I have one car, but I love cars. Um, I want to collect more pinball. I actually

[58:37] just got rid of my transformer toy collection after much debate. The time had come. I'm, I'm trying

[58:44] to simplify my, my collectibles as I get older. Um, yeah. Pinball seems to be something that I'm

[58:51] fairly confident. I want to collect as I get older just because unlike our arcade games and,

[58:57] and you, you would be jealous, Don, I'm staring at a Street Fighter 2 championed edition, which

[59:04] is a home use only that my mom bought for me and my twin brother when we were 13. Oh wow.

[59:10] It's in my bedroom. It's never been on location. It's mint. Um, because her deal was like,

[59:18] she thought we were going to get into drugs and meet like all these crazy people at their

[59:22] arcade. So she's like, if we get you guys a game, you stay home and we're like, hell yeah.

[59:27] Um, and that's never leaving. But I'm simplifying my, my collections and my collectibles and

[59:33] stuff's going out, but pinball will stay in, I can, I can fit three pinball machines in my apartment.

[59:39] Without looking too cluttered because I don't like, you know, you see these guys, they got like

[59:44] machines in their kitchens and they're like sleeping underneath the machine and I, I never want to

[59:48] look like that. Yeah, yeah. My, my, my, my deal is like organized hoarding, you know, if there's

[59:54] a, there's a spot for it, you know, it goes like, I've got a storage downstairs, but, but it's

[59:59] mainly it's got to have a place on the wall or, you know, it can't be in the way, you know,

[01:00:04] like it's, I've got to be able to function. My studio is my studio. It's very like, there's toys,

[01:00:08] but they're all off the ground on the walls and the rest of it is just, it's all, it's all work

[01:00:14] centers, you know, so it's got to be a flow and stuff. Um, I mean, I want to, it's, it's easy,

[01:00:18] you know, once you get like two, three games, you blink your eyes, you've got six and then you've

[01:00:23] got 12 and then you've got fucking 30, you know, and then you've got like 130, you know, it's just,

[01:00:27] that's how it happens. And yeah, I see it all the time and I'm luckily,

[01:00:33] it's you and I had a few broken ones downstairs and I had a gorf and I actually got it fixed and,

[01:00:38] you know, I had a, I think, Tanya would give me a genie pinball and, you know, I was like, yeah,

[01:00:44] I'm gonna fix that up and then, you know, I never did. I think I just gave it away, you know, but,

[01:00:48] there's just, there's, yeah, I'll never get into the whole like repairing and restoring games back

[01:00:53] to life. I mean, I'm, I'm a terrible pinball tech. I, I, I self-inmittedly know that because,

[01:01:00] every time I try to fix a pinball machine, there's certain things I can do on a machine, but if it's

[01:01:05] like electrical or things are going haywire, I'm not really the guy that whip out the volt meter and

[01:01:11] try and figure out where the thing is. I got no time to restore games. Right, so,

[01:01:20] New York City curbs my, my ability to hoard pinball just because I run out of room pretty quickly.

[01:01:27] Oh, you're in New York City, oh, no way. Yeah, I'm in a, if you, if you Google, I don't know if

[01:01:32] you've seen the story, Google, uh, man builds arcade and loses fiance, you'll see my, my bedroom

[01:01:39] arcade. It's, it's pretty cool. Yeah, it's, uh, yeah, it was my story like three years ago, I,

[01:01:47] I did that. I was engaged. Uh, and yeah, I was trying to sell my apartment and I was living with

[01:01:53] my fiancee in Brooklyn and I know, I got no offers on the apartment and I'm like, let me just do

[01:01:59] something with it since it's just sitting there and no one's even living in it. So I, I made in

[01:02:04] our Kate out of the bedroom and in the process of doing that, we sort of figured out we weren't meant

[01:02:08] to be together. So, yeah, it was like, it was like a good catalyst. I've got a great, a great new

[01:02:15] girl now. She's awesome. She's been living with me for a while, Brenda. She's from Ireland. She's got

[01:02:20] a more, the Irish, they're pretty sensible, you know, they, they, they understand

[01:02:24] pinball and the, or else I pretend that she does, but yeah. So, so, Donnie, do you get, as part of

[01:02:32] your agreement with Stern, do you get one of every game you design for them? Well, you had something

[01:02:38] that you can work into the deal. So, um, um, you have technically, yeah, uh, I'll, I'll be getting in

[01:02:44] Erosmith at some point. Um, so I, I could get an L.E. if I want a premium. I have a premium

[01:02:55] Metallica. I might get a premium. Um, I don't know. I was actually on the phone with one of the

[01:03:00] fellows over there today about about getting a game. So, what, I don't know. We'll see. I don't know

[01:03:05] which one I want yet. Why didn't you just get the most expensive one? Or is it just like, is there

[01:03:11] an R package that, which one, like, do you have your favorite other ones? Well, that's a thing. I

[01:03:15] mean, I made, I made all the R packages, like, just as cool as the other ones. So, I don't have a

[01:03:19] favorite. Right. Right. So, go like, well, like the premium better and I like the limited

[01:03:23] better. But, you know, I, I, I really tried to make each cabinet, you know, like, like, it's

[01:03:29] own, like, this thing, you know, like I dumped a lot of extra time into each cabinet. So,

[01:03:35] right. Now, I know, I can't ask you about Star Wars. I know you're not allowed to comment on it.

[01:03:40] It's not been announced. Like, keep yelling at people I know at Stern. Like, everyone knows

[01:03:46] it's coming, but we can't talk about it. So, I can't ask you questions about the Star Wars

[01:03:50] art package, right? That's awful limits, right? I know nothing about what they're up to now. I

[01:03:55] just know that there's some stuff that we've been talking about as far as I'm concerned. So,

[01:04:00] as whatever they're up to, I really have no idea, you know. So, so, Donnie, is, is what you're working

[01:04:06] on next or as you look at sort of like your genre, is it will it always be musical, musical themes,

[01:04:13] or do you think you want to branch out and do something that could be like a movie theme or

[01:04:17] something else? I'm game to do anything that's cool, you know? Okay. I just look in

[01:04:22] ball. I mean, you know, like, like, themes and, you know, it's all fun to work with, you know,

[01:04:26] no matter what it is. What, let's talk, you asked me like what my, like, dream themes would be,

[01:04:30] what would your dream themes would be if you could, if you could say like one tomorrow.

[01:04:35] Three and I was like, I'm going to make my own pinball machine. Dude, I fucking do heavy metal,

[01:04:39] you know? Like the movie, like, cartoon movie, I'd be like heavy metal, you know, coming right up.

[01:04:45] I think one of my first ones, I'd love to see a Mad Max pinball machine, you know, each of the

[01:04:50] each of the films, you know, four different games. That'd be pretty cool. You know,

[01:04:57] there's so many movies, you know Blade Runner, you know, that'd be pretty sick. Like, I don't know,

[01:05:01] who knows, you know? Well, I think Stern saw it too with the success of Ghostbusters,

[01:05:07] that there's, there's a huge well of themes from that period of like the 80s and even like the

[01:05:13] late 70s that would still do really well in a modern marketplace. I mean, Ghostbusters,

[01:05:21] like, sold out in a matter of hours. Um, hugely popular. Blade Runner would be awesome. I just

[01:05:27] saw the trailer for the, for the new movie coming out. So all these things are, there's like,

[01:05:32] we're going through this like nostalgic like resurgence again, right? It's 80s, 90s stuff is super hot.

[01:05:40] Yeah. So we're sure. I mean, I've heard rumors, but I'm here in like Deadpool, I'm here in

[01:05:47] Guardians, I'm here in Pulp Fiction. No, no one will confirm anything for me. I can speculate.

[01:05:54] So Donnie, like in terms of anything else going on in the pinball hobby, like, are you,

[01:05:59] so you're not on the forums, you're not, you're, like, what is your activity with pinball,

[01:06:05] like in your social life? Do you play mostly at home? Are you going to barcades? Like, how do you

[01:06:09] stay in the loop about what's going on? Do you see stuff at shows? Like, oh, I don't know, you know,

[01:06:14] I just, I play at home and I go down a free gold watch and, you know, a lot of my friends are like

[01:06:19] into pinball and I'm at the shows too. I'm at a lot of the shows. Like, I would say, I don't know,

[01:06:23] these days, you know, there's more expose popping up, but I traveled a lot in 2017 already, you know,

[01:06:30] like, I've done quite a few shows and, you know, definitely be at Chicago this year,

[01:06:37] doing a Southern Fried Gaming Expo. There's a whole bunch in the fall. I could have traveled out

[01:06:42] of the country as well. I think, on a white Canada, they're doing one and they just asked me to come.

[01:06:47] I'm at the shows and, you know, I talk to our people, you know, it's like I'm one of you guys, you know,

[01:06:55] I've always been a part of that, you know, so as far as keeping in the loop, like I'm just in the loop,

[01:06:59] you know, like, I just, I mean, I'm not a message board guy. I never was mushing the message boards and,

[01:07:04] you know, it's too much negative shit on there. I just, you know, I don't bother with it. I try to help

[01:07:09] the guy, I try to help the guy, I try to help the guy, you know what I mean? I know what school,

[01:07:13] I know what people like, what they want. It's what I want, what I like, you know.

[01:07:17] Right. So I got to ask you, Street Fighter 2, like, who do you play as? Who's your guy in that game?

[01:07:26] Chun Lee. Oh wow. Are you good? Are you like, would you consider yourself good?

[01:07:30] Because I'm about to bring this back to Pimble in a second.

[01:07:33] Okay, well, yeah, consider, I consider myself, okay, here's what I'm doing. I'm having a,

[01:07:37] yeah, there's this guy. And let me, I'll send you, I'll send you his information and maybe you can put a link

[01:07:44] down. And so there's this guy. I know, and he makes those mini cabinets. And he made me a Donkey Kong

[01:07:51] Jr. and it's a multi-cade. And it's a bar top. So what I'm going to start doing, like, this is about

[01:07:55] two years ago, I got the bar top. So I'm going to do a few bar tops. And you know what those are,

[01:08:01] right? They're just normal size screens. Just for people that don't know, that's a normal size screen.

[01:08:06] It's a multi-cade. So it's usually got about 60 games in it. And it looks just like a,

[01:08:11] it looks like a Donkey Kong, you know, cabinet. It's everything. It looks like an Nintendo cabinet.

[01:08:15] And he does all the cabinets and he does such a cool job. It's like a mini arcade, but you got a

[01:08:20] normal size joystick and a normal size screen. So very cool. It doesn't take up a lot of room. So

[01:08:25] I kind of want to have a little, a little, a, a wall full of those. And he's making me a street fighter

[01:08:31] too game right now. And maybe after we're done this, we can talk about, you know, what package

[01:08:36] I should get because I'd like to get the, you know, the classic or, you know, get, get all the

[01:08:39] street fighter games put into it if that's possible. But he's going to make me one. So, you know,

[01:08:45] I'm, I'm, I'm kind of naturally good at that game, but I haven't had a chance. Like, I don't

[01:08:51] own it. And I haven't had a chance to really spend a lot of time on it. But I know that when I get

[01:08:57] mine and start doing a little research and kind of, you know, figure everything out, I just have

[01:09:02] a natural instinct. I know I sound, sounds stupid, but I have a natural instinct with that game. You

[01:09:07] know, like I, yeah, it's, it's riding a bike. When you get good at street fighter too, you could,

[01:09:15] you could take a break for a year. And it's just, it's second nature of the movements in that game.

[01:09:20] Yeah. Yeah. I'm an attacker to you. Like, I'm not like, you know, I don't back off. And like,

[01:09:24] I, I'm an intimidator. Right. We'll get fucking intimidated. You know, when you go over there and you

[01:09:30] kick a little faster. I want to, I want to challenge way better than me. But I just, like, I just,

[01:09:35] you know, I just walked right up to them. And, you know, like, right, just throw, just do some,

[01:09:39] like, what's the work? The world kick she does. Like, okay. So here's the deal. I got to

[01:09:44] pry two sides of the fuck my leaves. So, you know what I mean? I'll just play any of me. I play with

[01:09:48] Gael. And I want to challenge you, Donnie on this podcast. He's fun. He's fun. I want to challenge you

[01:09:55] to a street fighter to battle. We'll have to figure out where we do this at one of these shows. We'll

[01:09:58] find, we'll find, I'm always disappointed when I go to the big expose. And it's not a street fighter

[01:10:02] to like, at a show because there's, I always see like new geos. I see like all these other games. But

[01:10:09] if I beat you, Donnie, oh, you're gonna beat me for sure. But what we should do is we should play

[01:10:14] and you can maybe teach me some stuff. Like, you own a fucking game. I was gonna, I was gonna

[01:10:18] I want to play you're like a erosmith translator or something. And this, you want to win something.

[01:10:23] I get it. I get it. It's like, if you like, coaster or something and then next to show,

[01:10:28] then I'm at the Urat. And you can show me some street fighter two stuff. When I get my own game,

[01:10:34] and I start, you know, I start, you know, dipping into it, you know, maybe then we can,

[01:10:39] right. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll play for bragging rights. We'll start there. Um, well,

[01:10:45] Donnie, this is, this has been great. I, I, I love hearing your sort of stories about

[01:10:51] providing artwork for these stern machines. And I, and I say this, I've heard nothing but

[01:10:56] glowing feedback for erosmith and, and Metallica is already a classic. I mean, your, your,

[01:11:02] hand has touched one classic stern. And from what I'm hearing, and I've, I've sort of been saying

[01:11:07] this, I think erosmith could be the sleeper hit of the year first. And I think people's

[01:11:11] attention were like on Batman and Star Wars. Um, but I think erosmith is the total package

[01:11:18] of artwork of gameplay, a fun factor. It's got an amazing toy. It's got a bunch of stuff going

[01:11:22] on. It's got great music. Um, I think, I think they're going to love it for years to come. So,

[01:11:28] it's a really fun game. And there's a lot going on. You know, there's a lot of like, I mean,

[01:11:32] that whole like right hand side is all ramps. You know, it's all stuff that the ball goes in. You

[01:11:36] know, it's, it's a fun-ass game. You know, like John did a crazy cool job. And um, and that,

[01:11:42] you know, the upper play field was really tricky. It was really tricky to like, what am I going to do

[01:11:46] with this? It's a weird shape. You know, like what, so I did stage rigging. I'm like, that's the

[01:11:50] rigging for the, you know, the concert. Right. And I don't know. It was a, yeah, I'm glad to hear

[01:11:58] that. I'm, you know, I hope people are stoked on it. I like to get a lot of played in a bunch.

[01:12:02] Um, again, like I haven't, I haven't clocked in a lot of time on it. I can't wait to get one.

[01:12:06] And kind of really open it up, you know. Right. Now it's, I played it at Allentown this past weekend.

[01:12:12] And I loved it. I mean, I, I keep, I keep not, I gotta be honest, I keep not wanting to love it

[01:12:20] that much because I, I'm like, I don't want to buy an aerosmith pin. But every time I play it,

[01:12:24] I'm like, man, this is more fun than Batman. It's more fun than Ghostbusters. I was like, maybe I just,

[01:12:30] part of the deal is like doing these games too. Like you, like when I, my, my job is, so like, I

[01:12:34] want to make that game look so cool that it doesn't matter what the title is. It's just a pretty game,

[01:12:39] you know, like, because there was titles that I'm sure there's titles out there that like, you

[01:12:43] know, it's kind of like, it would be kind of a weird title that something, you know, it wouldn't

[01:12:47] want to buy, but the art was so great. And the gameplay was so great that you had to get, you

[01:12:50] had to have it, you know, I have no examples, but, you know, um, like it should matter, it should

[01:12:56] matter. It should just be like, wow, it's a really cool game. You know, it's fun to play. It's

[01:13:00] beautiful. And I got to have that in my collection. You know, it's like a must have. Right. And the,

[01:13:04] the first thing people fall in love with with any pinball machine is the art. And if, if you start

[01:13:10] off on a bad note, like, I'll use Game of Thrones. I love Game of Thrones. I love the show. Right?

[01:13:16] I'm like, I'm obsessed. I think, you know, everyone knows that the Game of Thrones artwork,

[01:13:23] whether they were, had their hands tied by HBO and what, whatever happened.

[01:13:27] Um, you know, you don't get that sort of love affair with looking down at that play field. And

[01:13:33] you don't sort of get pulled into that Game of Thrones universe. Um, you know, but the game

[01:13:38] shoots great. The game has great flow. But when the art's not where people want it to be, you,

[01:13:45] you just, it's just, you, you, you long for it, right? And I think what's great about your games,

[01:13:50] Donnie is like, no one looks at a, at a dirty Donnie's turn game and is like, you know what, I,

[01:13:55] I wish this thing looked better. You know, like, you will never hear anyone say that. Oh, thank you.

[01:14:02] Yeah. And then, and then when the shots are great and the code is great, which is what we're

[01:14:05] hearing with, with, um, with Aerosmith, I mean, it's, there, there's really, I haven't heard any

[01:14:11] knock on it other than it's similar to kiss, but better in every way. So it's like, well, you know,

[01:14:18] John board has a design scheme and he, you know, he's made, he's made the game even better. So,

[01:14:24] um, the only thing I see about kisses that the, I mean, the bumpers are sort of in the same

[01:14:28] spot, but that's the only thing, you know, I mean, it's kind of, it's, it's, it's, it's John

[01:14:33] board game, you know, it's like, it's boring. You know, on the, on the, on the forums, these guys

[01:14:37] will lay the playfields on top of each other and show how it's like pretty mirror design or,

[01:14:42] I, on other shots. Like I, I, I know, I know, believe me, like it's, it's pinball, it's pinball.

[01:14:50] Like, yeah, exactly. Have you no fucking life just have fun. It's a fun thing. It's a positive

[01:14:56] thing, you know, right, right. Well, well, Donnie, I really appreciate you taking the time coming

[01:15:00] on the show. Um, again, we look forward to seeing what your next game is. You've, you continue to

[01:15:07] raise the bar with, with artwork. Um, and I, and I will say this, I'm friends with Jeremy and

[01:15:12] I think he killed it with, with ghost busters, but I do think Aerosmith is the nicest art package.

[01:15:19] I've seen on, on any stern ever. I think you've raised the bar over ghost busters. I do. I,

[01:15:24] and people go back and forth on those two, but I, I think you're the new gold standard by which,

[01:15:30] the rest of the artwork will be compared. So congratulations on that. Oh, thank you, man. Thank

[01:15:36] you. I think there's going to be some like really good art coming out of stern. You know,

[01:15:38] there's going to be a lot of a lot of good stuff coming, you know, from, from, from Jeremy and,

[01:15:43] and others, you know, um, it's like, uh, uh, we're going in a good direction, you know. Right. And

[01:15:48] what's exciting, uh, looking great. What's exciting for everyone who listens to this show is all of

[01:15:54] these games that stern is working on, they'll actually come out unlike all the other boutique

[01:16:00] manufacturers out there that keep stalling, releasing their games. Stern is the only one that just,

[01:16:06] it's, it's like a, the train keeps on moving. Um, games keep coming out every year. It's exciting.

[01:16:12] I, you know, I, I, I can't imagine anyone who's in the pinball who's not thankful that stern is

[01:16:19] in business in 2017 and, and, and businesses booming. So that's a, depth, a great thing. It's great.

[01:16:24] Yeah. Totally. Totally. You know, um, it's all, it's, it's, it's, it's cool. You know, just

[01:16:28] everyone buy them the games, you know, and, um, it's amazing. You know, like, uh, going, going

[01:16:33] all the pinball shows, you know, people have been so warm and so cool. Everyone's coming up

[01:16:38] and they're stoked. And, you know, I get to, I get to hang out with a, you know, a lot of

[01:16:41] pin-siders and a lot of, a lot of, you know, pinball fans, because like, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

[01:16:45] I'm one too, you know, I'm a fan too. And it's cool to, to do these shows and just to get all that love,

[01:16:50] you know, it's super, super cool. Like, I'll go to the, after the show, go to the bar and, you

[01:16:54] know, just hang out with, you know, the people, you know, it's, it's super fun and, um, getting

[01:16:59] nothing but love about, you know, Metallica and, um, you know, and it's cool to hear that about

[01:17:03] Erasmith too, you know, I'm glad people are stoked. And, yeah, you, I can't go,

[01:17:08] Tony, you've, you've, you've got to go into the pin-side Erasmith thread and read all the

[01:17:15] positive feedback. I mean, you, you deserve to hear what people are saying. It's all, it's all good.

[01:17:21] It's all good. Trust me. That's cool. That's cool. I had, I had no idea. The only time I had,

[01:17:25] I had, I had heard about some Erasmith stuff was when I put my book out and the official teaser was,

[01:17:32] we had pictures of Erasmith in my book, my, I know, it spoiled the, the launch or the reveal, right?

[01:17:38] Um, well, it was, it was an official, it was an official teaser. Right. So, yeah, well that,

[01:17:42] it's, that sounds like something Jody came up with that title. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

[01:17:47] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's fun. It was a lot of fun to, uh, you know, I only had 10

[01:17:52] books in Chicago and there was like a giant line and people were like, he's got his book, he's

[01:17:56] got his book and I hear the new pin-bills in there. So like, dudes were just like, saw them with

[01:18:00] their phones, just taking pictures and like up it went, you know, on a pin-site, on a, on online.

[01:18:05] So it was cool. That was really neat, you know, yeah. What's been done really well? See all the pinball

[01:18:09] fans have been like, all the pinball people have been picking it up and being getting a lot of emails

[01:18:14] and, and, uh, you know, messages about, uh, about, you know, how much people like the books,

[01:18:19] and that's very cool. It's nice to hear. What's the name of your book if someone wants to go and

[01:18:24] order it? My book is called Pinball Wizards and Black Lake Destroyers. So the, the meeting behind

[01:18:30] the title is obviously, you know, pinball. A lot of the book is dedicated to my pinball heart

[01:18:34] and also my Black Light poster series. So the two kind of mixed together and then the book has also

[01:18:39] got a lot of the, all the other stuff I've been up to in the last five years, which would be since my

[01:18:44] first book, Monster Revolt, which was the first 10 years of me being in California. I basically

[01:18:50] put a book together of 10 years being in California. So the new book is, is all the new stuff and it's

[01:18:55] actually, I like it a lot better. It's, it's, it's, it's a much, you know, much more broad, uh, it shows

[01:19:01] that the full range of what I'm capable of. And, um, so you, you can actually get the book on my

[01:19:06] website, dirtydoney.com. And I've got a web store and that's where you can get all my posters and

[01:19:11] all that stuff. But, uh, the book's on Amazon. It's all the new place. You can pick it up. And

[01:19:15] if you want the book's signed to, bring it to the show. I'll sign it. Bring your glass. I'll sign

[01:19:19] your glass. No problem. You know, so next, next place to see Donnie's at Southern Fried Gaming Expo.

[01:19:26] Any other plans Donnie to be at other shows this year. So people who are listening might want to

[01:19:31] take a chance. Australia. Australia. I got an art show on May 26th and May 27th. It's a solo art show

[01:19:38] at custom Lane Gallery in Melbourne, Australia. So if you're in Australia, please come out to the show.

[01:19:44] Bring your, bring your glass. You know, come by a book. It's my book launch as well.

[01:19:49] Wow. You, you know, Donnie, you do know that like the, I think the second biggest pinball market

[01:19:55] next to the US is Australia. I have so many listeners who are over there who send me urinals all the time.

[01:20:00] It's big and I'm, and if you're in Australia, I'm trying to reach you. I want you to know about

[01:20:05] the show. I just don't know how. So we're trying to get over it. You're going to reach a lot. And

[01:20:09] you know what? I'll post it too. I'm on, uh, I was banned from Pinside. So now I'm on the

[01:20:13] Australian arcade forum. So I will post that you're going to be there. Oh, oh, cool. Yeah,

[01:20:18] please do. That would be awesome. Oh, you got banned from Pinside for being a dick. Oh, man,

[01:20:22] you know how it is. I'm kidding. No, it's, it's all right. Ever since I've been banned, I've been

[01:20:27] doing this podcast and it's actually been a much more positive experience for, for all parties involved.

[01:20:33] But I, but I, I asked for pinball political asylum in Australia on the forum and they,

[01:20:38] allowed me to join. So I will post it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is what he said. Well,

[01:20:44] Donnie, thank you for taking the time. I appreciate this has been about like an hour, which is like our
