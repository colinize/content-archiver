[00:00] There's dancing behind the movie scenes, behind the movie scenes,

[00:05] Saturday night, keep the warm, the keeps the dream alive,

[00:11] from the morning past evening to the end of the light.

[00:15] Settles, settles, settles, settles, settles, settles, settles.

[00:19] You know, this keeps happening to me.

[00:21] I sit down to do a show and the moment I'm about to hit record,

[00:25] something groundbreaking in the pinball news happens.

[00:29] And I don't know if you saw, but this morning on this weekend pinball,

[00:33] a full deep dive on deep root pinball was uploaded.

[00:38] And for the first time in years, we've been able to see some of the fruits

[00:43] of the labor of John Papaduke, Robert Mueller, Steve Bowden.

[00:49] Yes, there are images of Razup pinball machine from deep root

[00:54] that are now out there in the world.

[00:56] All of the mystery, all of the speculation is now coming to somewhat.

[01:02] And that is the key word somewhat of an end.

[01:05] Now, I have to say, let me just give you my quick opinions about this,

[01:09] the interview they did.

[01:11] And then I do want to air for you in interview I did with everyone's somewhat

[01:17] favorite guest of the show, maybe not so much.

[01:20] Dr. Frightner Larry, he comes on the show and we talk about what we think

[01:26] or what he thinks should be included in all limited edition pinball machines

[01:33] that cost $9,000 or more.

[01:36] So I think you're going to enjoy that chat.

[01:37] But let's go back to deep root.

[01:39] So the first time you see a new pinball machine, it is a special moment.

[01:43] Now, when I saw this machine, the first thing I said was, wow, like, wow,

[01:50] like this is, this is a J-pop game.

[01:52] And the first thing you always notice on a J-pop game are the ramps that he puts in his games

[01:59] because they go up, down, left, right, swirl around.

[02:04] He always finds a way to make what I think are the coolest ramps in pinball.

[02:13] And whenever I see a J-pop ramp design, I'm always like, well, how is the ball going

[02:19] to go around and up and down?

[02:21] And does it have enough velocity to make that shot?

[02:24] But it is really, really neat game.

[02:28] I mean, you have to read the interview.

[02:29] You have to see the pictures.

[02:30] There's magnets.

[02:32] I think there's a couple magnets in the out lane.

[02:35] There's magnets that divert.

[02:37] It seems like there's a ball lock underneath.

[02:39] There's a Ferris wheel.

[02:40] There's a bash toy.

[02:42] There's like a jump shot.

[02:44] Goes up the ramp.

[02:45] Jumps up a ramp and hits a target.

[02:47] I think it's like a comet ramp shot.

[02:49] That's a jump shot.

[02:50] There's a lot of toys in this game.

[02:52] A lot of toys.

[02:53] And you know me.

[02:54] I'm a toy fanatic.

[02:55] But it also looks like a game that has a lot of flow.

[02:59] That is going to be fast.

[03:01] But what I love about the interview and when you read it, and this is what I've been

[03:06] always saying about pinball, is they talk a lot about you have to make a game

[03:13] immediately fun for people.

[03:16] But also deep enough where there's stuff to do in the game.

[03:20] But when you hop on a pinball machine and that steel ball is going around the play field,

[03:26] you want it to interact with stuff physically.

[03:30] And the reason why I love this game is here's why I'm just really excited right now because

[03:35] as I look down at that play field, I see a world of toys and fun shots and fun things

[03:41] going on.

[03:43] And I don't even care.

[03:44] Here's the thing.

[03:45] I don't even care what is on the screen.

[03:48] And yet we know what will be on the screen will be the best animations we've ever seen

[03:54] in pinball.

[03:55] And if you've seen the rise of video, you know these guys are taking animation to a new

[04:00] level over at deep root.

[04:03] And finally we have it.

[04:04] Now some other things that we have to mention about this this news item.

[04:10] The cabinet is a standard cabinet.

[04:12] This is not the prototype cabinet that Jeff from this week in pinball saw when he visited

[04:19] deep root.

[04:20] Here's a truth.

[04:21] Here's the truth.

[04:22] I'm just going to share this with you.

[04:25] If you see this and you're impressed by what you see and I am impressed by what I see

[04:30] with this game because it just it looks like a pinball game.

[04:34] I'm just so excited to see it not try and do something completely crazy.

[04:40] But I know for a fact that this raza that you are looking at right now is not even close

[04:50] to the final product that they are going to put out.

[04:54] They are sandbagging us.

[04:56] Okay.

[04:57] Now which crazy and now this all makes sense when Robert said hey the thing we're going

[05:01] to bring to Houston is going to be good enough to go in a box and get to customers.

[05:06] If any other manufacturer released this game it would be good enough to go but it's

[05:11] not good enough for us and the level they're going to take it to is higher than this.

[05:17] That's also what has me excited to know that this is the sandbagged version of this game

[05:23] and the final version of it will be even way way more aesthetically pleasing and have much

[05:32] more finesse and details and just like polish than this version of the game.

[05:39] So that's damn exciting.

[05:42] Now I can't wait to see people flip it.

[05:44] I can't wait to see what the reaction to the game is.

[05:47] It is funny that after all of the sledgehammer talk to the play field they are going with

[05:54] Mercow play field to right now if there's one play field manufacturer that nobody trusts

[06:00] or nobody believes in its Mercow with all of their issues.

[06:04] But I and Robert said this is not what we're going with with the final production.

[06:09] It's just what they ordered in time for the show.

[06:12] Now when is this stuff coming out?

[06:14] When is Deeproot Pimball actually going to have products for sale?

[06:18] So the timeline now has shifted.

[06:21] He's saying earliest that they will ship games is April 2020.

[06:27] The latest, the latest which would be the worst case scenario would be June 30th which

[06:32] is now the new legal date by which all did where customers have to get their raza shipped

[06:39] to them.

[06:40] So he also has a date by which Deeproot Pimball will reveal itself fully to the entire world

[06:47] and it won't happen at a show.

[06:49] It will happen at Deeproot Auditorium on March 25th I believe or 22nd.

[06:57] It's like it's right before TPS.

[06:59] Let me just make sure I get this date right for you guys hold on because what I was reading

[07:05] when he said it is that he's going to have an event in which media are invited.

[07:10] Now look, Robert Smart, he's going to invite real media, not just Pimball media to see

[07:16] this new Pimball company but I want to make sure I get the date right for you guys hold

[07:21] on March 25th I was right 2020 at 8.55 am no sooner and no later than 8.55 Robert I'll

[07:31] be there at 8.54 buddy with a cup of coffee in hand because I can't wait to see what's

[07:36] going on.

[07:37] Now will there be multiple titles?

[07:40] He doesn't know.

[07:41] Raza is for sure.

[07:42] There might be some other titles.

[07:43] Now there was also a long interview with John Papaduke and I would read that if I were

[07:49] you.

[07:50] It's always interesting to hear the mind of the crazy man known as J-Pop.

[07:54] I still wish you would just apologize for once.

[07:58] Just say I'm sorry how things went down.

[08:01] He just needs to say those two words together.

[08:03] I'm sorry.

[08:07] And then we'll put it behind us because it does seem like if you got burned by J-Pop

[08:14] that there is something beneficial coming your way and it's real and it looks like it

[08:20] works and I'm excited to see this thing come to fruition.

[08:25] I like the rhetoric from them now.

[08:28] Here's the thing all the boasting all the bragging all the hyperbole you know I thought

[08:32] that was stupid I don't think they needed it.

[08:35] Let your game do the talking.

[08:37] This game looks like it's going to do the talking.

[08:40] When you hear them talk about value and giving customers what they pay for and putting stuff

[08:46] in pinball machines that are magical and sort of like awaken our imagination.

[08:52] I mean I love hearing Steve Bowden in his interview talk about the rule set of this game.

[08:56] How you're spending time in the adventure land and you can either spend time in the

[09:01] adventure land and have fun with all the toys and all the you know the amusement park

[09:06] rides but there's a mystery tower X and you might want to see what's going on up there

[09:13] and it opens the door to a whole nother deeper adventure within the pinball game.

[09:20] I mean I just like the way J-Pop thinks and approaches pinball.

[09:24] I don't like the way he runs the business.

[09:26] I don't like any of the way he you know he fails to finish mechanisms and misleads people

[09:33] and it moves on from one project to the next it seems like it seems like the Houston show.

[09:39] The reason why they're doing it and you can hear this in Robert's interview.

[09:42] He wanted to pressure the team to deliver something by a date and they definitely have something

[09:49] ready to go and I think it's going to be an exciting weekend for those of you at Houston.

[09:56] I actually think Houston has something more exciting to play than anything that was at

[10:01] Expo this year and so for those of you down there you have a treat coming your way.

[10:06] I think the lines to get on this game are going to be tremendously long but I look forward

[10:12] to seeing the videos and what people's experiences are and I'm actually going to have at least

[10:18] one person I know who's going down there on the show and interview them about what it was

[10:23] like to play Ross and now I'm really this is going to be fun because a listener of the

[10:28] show Derek you know Derek he loves Jersey Jack Pimball he loves Willie Wonka he loves

[10:33] pirates of the Caribbean. I'm really curious to see what a guy who loves Jersey Jack Pins

[10:39] what he feels when he jumps on a deep root pin does he feel this game is advancing and

[10:47] enhancing the kind of magic we've had in Pimball because you know I would say like up to this

[10:52] point Jersey Jack Pimball has been the company trying to put the most Pimball magic back under

[10:57] the play field right without a doubt but here we have this new company Robert Mueller's deep

[11:03] root and I know Robert still considers the Valley Williams games to be the best games ever and he

[11:09] wants to top that I don't think you can say that about Stern I don't think Stern's trying to beat

[11:14] Valley Williams under the glass I think Stern's trying to beat us or beat them with better you know

[11:22] new themes or big themes great artwork and great coding but I don't think that Stern Pimball

[11:30] is mechanically pushing the envelope at all in fact I think it's the opposite I do I think it's

[11:36] Gary walking around with the investors in mind and yanking stuff out of the game and we have proof

[11:42] of that now when you look at Raza and you look at this game and I'm not going to go over it I always

[11:47] hate when podcasts try to describe so go look at it when you look at it you really do see a lot

[11:53] of mechanically fun stuff going on in the game and I think it's going to be a blast to shoot the

[11:58] cabinet artwork is not final it is placeholder there's sandbag in us on this art package that

[12:03] there is no way the game is artistically going to look like this now the other thing Robert talks

[12:09] about is value and how they want to they want to show the Pimball world exactly what you can get

[12:16] for your money in a way that no one else is doing right now he also said that the games might

[12:22] increase in price hold their value increase in price over new in box prices so I do think they

[12:28] will have different tiers of the games and I think they they they I think they have to have looked

[12:35] at the Pimball market and understood that you do need to make special versions of the games for

[12:41] collectors you have to I you just do I don't want just one one version of an s class Mercedes or

[12:49] one version of a C class or one version of an eight series BMW I want there to be a base level I

[12:55] want there to be a medium level and I want there to be a collectible version that has all the

[13:01] bells and whistles maybe even has an extra mechanism in it maybe even has an extra mode or two I

[13:07] hope they've listened to all of that kind of feedback that we just want more for what we pay for

[13:13] and if we pay more and we get that stuff we're happy I don't know how you know my whole thing is

[13:19] we people how can you be happy when you pay more and you get nothing which has been basically what's

[13:25] been going on recently now what what's not on this game is a top or where's a top or that's all

[13:30] we care about now you know we've been reduced to discussing toppers so take a look at that game

[13:37] super awesome I think you know deep root it's impressed me so far I'm gonna hold back sorry I'm

[13:44] gonna hold back my you know my school like giddy enthusiasm or childlike enthusiasm I have for

[13:49] woolly wonka and I still you know like I still love the way wonka shoes I'm not gonna go down

[13:54] down that road okay so what else is going on anything else before I air the interview with Larry

[14:00] I have not I have not I've not talked about the Batman 66 code update which happened about a week

[14:09] and a half ago or a week ago the reason why simple there's like nothing really different about it

[14:14] it's more of just a bug fix code update but here's what's curious it says SLE speech at it now I

[14:22] have an SLE I did the code update I've played the game for hours after the code update I don't

[14:28] notice anything different what SLE speech did they add I wish when they did stuff like this like

[14:35] we added this speech well what speech where how do I get to it am I just randomly waiting for it to

[14:42] play I would love to know from Stern Pimball what SLE speech was added to the game okay like what it

[14:48] Adam West record for you I think he did some like holy super elite you know I think he did some of

[14:53] that stuff I wish it would say that every time you turn the game on it's like wow Batman super

[14:58] limited edition like something like that would be really cool all right so what else I want to talk

[15:04] about real quick before we air the interview with Larry I also saw this now this is concerning to me

[15:12] and you know I always take the arrows in the back when I talk about warranty issues and how

[15:20] manufacturers are treating customers here's our here are two concerning things for me one is

[15:27] Stern Pimball apparently not sending people populated playfields if the playfields I have have

[15:33] chipped and have been of poor quality within the warranty period or within the first few months

[15:38] of owning it so I have an issue with that but here's the real concerning thing that again I don't

[15:44] hear people talking about this people sweep this under the rug and maybe it's an isolated incident

[15:49] but how Stern is handling this I think is very poor a gentleman updated a game recently a

[15:58] Stern Pimball game I think it might have been a Batman I'm I'm pretty sure his Batman or Ghostbusters

[16:04] one of them in the process of updating the code in his game two of the node boards got fried or

[16:13] working during the code update okay so the actual update itself is what caused the boards to fail

[16:20] he then calls up Stern Pimball and says I just put your new code in and it broke two of my node boards

[16:28] they won't send him new node boards for free they want him to pay money for those node boards

[16:36] now I that is garbage response like how can you how can your code update break a guy's machine

[16:44] and then you refuse to to to to cover him under the warranty of the game now I get it again it's hard

[16:53] because how do they know that that code update was actually the thing that trigger the node board

[16:59] failure you know it's like but you've got to take your customers word and you got to the customer

[17:06] is always right is usually how you do customer service the right way in the world so I think

[17:13] Stern Pimball needs to back these node boards and if they fail during a code update Stern Pimball needs

[17:19] to stand behind the products they made they made the node boards they made the code update if that

[17:26] breaks a guy's machine they should be responsible okay and I think everyone would agree with that

[17:32] anything else going on real quick if you want to buy a Batman Ellie I saw on Pinside one just

[17:41] went up for sale pretty mint condition home use one owner 9700 bucks for Batman Ellie now I say

[17:49] that because that's one of the cheaper prices I've seen on a Batman Ellie and there's only 240

[17:54] out in the world it has the topper so if you are looking for Batman Ellie I would run to Pinside

[18:01] I think that's a decent price for that game another game that went up for sale that had a lot of

[18:06] debate I want to talk about it real quick and then we'll do the interview and I'm sorry that this

[18:10] is going to go over in our people but it's simply because of the deep route that we saw today and

[18:16] that was an in addition to the Larry interview that was just going to get thrown up someone is

[18:21] selling a Wizard of Oz Emerald City limited edition for $11,000 now they want they want

[18:30] $11,000 because the game has almost every single mod that you can put in that game it's got the

[18:37] red witch mod or the red smoke witch mod it's got the that special flying monkey mod it's got

[18:44] everything I'm not making a list all the mods now I guess the question I have for you out there

[18:50] and let's just talk about quickly do mods add value to a game when you sell it used and I've

[18:56] heard other podcasts talk about this and everyone's like no they don't it's like modding a car it's

[19:00] like you're never going to get your money's worth now I definitely agree that normally when you

[19:06] mod anything you're not going to get back dollar to dollar it's like when people put in color

[19:11] DMD's and they want exactly what the color DMD would cost or they put in a brass plating and they put

[19:17] in atomic pile mods and Batman and they put in this and that and new scopes and everything I don't

[19:24] think you're going to get back dollar to dollar but but if you have a mod in a game like the special

[19:30] winged monkey that they're not making anymore or that it's backordered for a year I don't know

[19:36] you know some of these mods they don't make anymore then those mods I think become more valuable

[19:42] than they were even when they were new and there are certain games out there and Wizard of Oz is

[19:48] one of them I think Batman is one of them there are certain games out there in which some of the mods

[19:54] are just mandatory to to making the game look as good as it could look so but here's the problem with

[20:02] $11,000 for a Wizard of Oz is the game right now you can go get an Emerald City almost readily

[20:11] available all over the place for around $7,000 maybe even less they just made so many of them

[20:20] so that's the issue is you really are going to have a hard time charging $4,000 over

[20:29] what anyone can go get a Wizard of Oz for and here's why because none of these mods any of them

[20:37] actually change the gameplay experience for the most part it's still the same game it just looks

[20:43] a little better so I don't think he'll sell that for $11,000 you know I saw his justification was

[20:50] well a yellow brick road is $11,000 so mine's much nicer and has the flying monkey and has all this

[20:57] other stuff so you'd be stupid for buying in $11,500 or a yellow brick road edition and he's right

[21:03] the yellow brick road edition is is a suckers buy it's stupid it's Jack removed stuff and charged

[21:10] more and then you don't even know how limited it is it's a suckers buy everyone knows that like

[21:14] $11,500 for that what with a crappy top or no not worth it and he's making more he's making more

[21:20] Ruby Reds with the monkey he's also Jersey Jack is is also reselling old stock of the Emerald City

[21:30] limited edition right now like they're they are putting the 2.0 lightboards in Emerald City editions

[21:36] and selling them through some distributors at $11,500 it's crazy it's crazy like they just keep

[21:43] making what was is are like gremlins like the second you get a one wet another four pop out

[21:51] like there's there there's Wizard of Oz is everywhere the game is never felt like it's hard to get

[21:56] it doesn't mean it's not a great game it just means I think it's like one of the least collectible

[22:01] games out there because there's over 5,000 in existence in existence all in different trim levels

[22:07] okay all right anything else going on okay so Larry and I talk about what we think should be

[22:14] in every limited edition machine now when you talk to Larry it's sort of like

[22:20] it's sort of like if you give a kid a power wheels and you just want him to go straight and you're

[22:25] like just just go straight straight up the driveway and the kid gets in and just start to yank in

[22:29] the wheel left and right I mean keeping Larry focused and on point is always extremely difficult

[22:35] for me but I think I did a good job I did I he he tried to go on tangents every once in a while

[22:42] and I got him back online to stay focused on his list of things he thinks should be included in

[22:49] every Ellie all right so you're gonna hear that I think it's good the one thing we missed and I

[22:54] want to add this to the list I think should be in all limited edition games are cliffies or

[23:01] metal protectors in areas of where and a shooter lane protector I just think it is absolutely crazy

[23:09] that all pinball machines come out now and people have to later on add these things to the game

[23:17] when these things could be manufactured from the factory and I'm still shocked if I'm a Robert Mueller

[23:23] one company I'm gonna buy maybe doesn't need to because of how they're doing their playfields

[23:27] the one company someone should buy is cliffies go buy cliffies cliffie go buy him go buy his company

[23:33] go buy his pinball protector company he probably wouldn't sell it because he wants to make stuff

[23:38] for every game that guy's probably gonna end up with like you know 10 million dollars

[23:43] retired in the Caribbean one day because all of these pinball companies couldn't figure out

[23:48] figure out how to make their games with with little metal protectors that kept the playfield safe

[23:53] I mean it who doesn't want to cliffing a game all right all right everyone here is Larry happy

[23:59] Thursday happy Friday this might be the only show for the weekend until after we see what goes

[24:04] on at Houston everybody thank you for tuning in oh and before I let you go please everybody check

[24:12] out special when lit pinball podcast this week I was interviewed by Ken and Bill it was a lot of

[24:19] fun it was so nice to have a pinball podcast out there actually extending all the branch and

[24:25] talk to me I love talking to all the pinball personalities out there it was it was a good romp

[24:31] through what's going on in pinball bill will be coming on the show because when you listen to their

[24:36] show they had some audio issues with Bill and it's sound like he was being you know talking from

[24:42] inside a coffee can down the hallway which is kind of funny every time he comes in but he's gonna

[25:03] interview here it goes all right ladies and gentlemen back by what some would say unpopular

[25:10] demand dr. frightening Larry who wanted to tell all of you what he thinks should go into a

[25:19] limited edition machine Larry welcome back to the show hey what's up how you doing man so you've

[25:25] heard me you've heard me complain you know and why and about what I think should be in these games

[25:29] for all this money and I know you've been giving this some some thought so what we're going to do

[25:34] on this episode of canators pinball podcast we're going to go down a list of everything you think

[25:40] should be in a limited edition machine how does that sound that sounds great okay so let's let's

[25:46] just start let's just go right in Larry what's number one that should be inside every Ellie machine

[25:52] well these are not in any specific order okay so I just have a list because I was thinking about it

[25:59] and as I was looking at mostly a stern machine because I think they can do a lot more uh and they're

[26:06] getting up into the 10k range I mean they got to put more into these games right well let me you

[26:11] know Larry I don't mean to stop you right away I just want to ask you before you go down the list

[26:15] how many games do you think is that on one is that one of your items the number of games that they

[26:20] should make to consider it actually to be limited you know I didn't I didn't put that on the list

[26:25] but clearly stern is doing 500 which I think it's fine okay so anything more do you think is too much

[26:32] well I mean if you're calling it uh you know in Jersey jacks case they have a CE and LE in a

[26:37] standard and then uh so it's a different way of saying it but specifically I'm mostly talking

[26:43] about stern because they consider their LE their top brand right um and so we're not so I think in

[26:49] Jersey jacks case they consider like a premium their LE so we'll just say whether it's CE or an

[26:56] LE jacks jacks CE's are his LE's because he makes thousands of limited editions that's okay I

[27:02] would I would say and then we'll go down the list I would say that to me the sweet spot for to be

[27:07] truly limited is 250 I think 500 is a lot and that's why they pop up so often but let's go down the

[27:15] list because I think you're right these games are getting between 9,000 and 12,000 500 15,000 for

[27:21] Elvira what's number one thing should go you think should go into an LE well and this is something

[27:27] stern doesn't do is radcale artwork okay like uh Jersey jack puts on their CE's and it's a clear

[27:35] difference I mean they're so beautiful shiny uh it's amazing so I would definitely think that for

[27:41] $10,000 stern should be able to do radcale artwork okay so let's stop at each one and discuss so I

[27:48] agree with you that I think the cabinet artwork on stern machines could benefit from them doing

[27:55] a more radcale now they have something that's not called radcals but it's more like the foiled sort

[28:00] of metallic decals that they put on Batman 66 and it's now on I think it was on iron maiden LE

[28:07] and it was on iron man vault edition and it was also on Elvira signature edition but they don't

[28:13] do it on every LE so I do agree that the LE should have a nicer glossier sort of high-end cabinet

[28:20] artwork so I agree with you one for one on there what's your next thing okay this really just

[28:26] irritates the hell out of me so you have all these you know like the rubbers everywhere you know for

[28:32] the bumpers everything else um why aren't where why isn't everything black okay if it's an LE

[28:38] you know why isn't it green to go with Jurassic Park or red uh for acdc or whatever why can't they use

[28:46] silicone uh rubbers for all the uh different things on on the playfield makes no sense because the

[28:54] black brings the game down right so item number two is color coordinate the rubbers in the game on

[29:01] the LE to be more in line with the colors of the game I I agree with you and I think you know

[29:07] changing rubbers out is not expensive but it is something that a lot of people do with their

[29:13] LE and I think that could be done at the factory and that's not expensive right I mean what's a

[29:18] rubber set cost in a game like maybe ten to thirty bucks to do a full rubber set like and you're

[29:25] talking about more than you're already paying for the black so it's not going to be much more right

[29:29] so you're talking about pennies and why can't they coordinate that two for two side are

[29:35] better and rubbers what's the next thing okay so Chicago gaming right they really blow me away

[29:42] with their with their sculpted uh pieces and and they're getting you know uh when they came out with

[29:48] uh monster bash it was eighty five hundred or whatever now why can't uh stern do that uh why can't

[29:55] they have sculpted toppers when you're charging a nine thousand ten thousand dollars for game

[30:01] they should have sculpted toppers and by the way so should Jersey jack if you're going to have

[30:06] a game cost twelve thousand dollars wouldn't you rather have a sculpted Willy Wonka and umpa

[30:11] lumpas on the top I mean come on okay so let's let's zoom out a little bit so just getting a

[30:17] topper for an Ellie is not something that stern does anymore or has done since Batman uh so right

[30:26] now you pay nine thousand dollars so Larry you're saying every Ellie should at least come with a topper

[30:33] correct okay and from there if you're going to charge a if you have one of the more expensive

[30:39] Ellie's it should come with a sculpted topper that has some dimension to it unlike time let's be

[30:46] honest the Wonka topper looks really cheap so it is the yellow brick road topper what you know

[30:52] I think people want to see toppers like pirates of the Caribbean right and ghost busters and Batman

[30:58] with some dimension to it right okay so you think that should be included standard if you're paying

[31:04] ten thousand dollars okay and then stern wants to flip around four months later and do a topper

[31:08] for five hundred dollars why is it included for for ninety five hundred dollars a domain of funds

[31:13] right let me ask you let me ask you a question how what do you think about a scenario in which

[31:18] they make a topper that is exclusive to Ellie owners that only they can buy it but it is an

[31:25] additional fee would that be okay yeah I think there's nothing wrong with like when you buy a car

[31:31] you know they have options okay uh you know there's no reason why you can't be able to you know

[31:38] add something to your game when you're paying ten grand you should be able to get everything right

[31:43] something I've been confused about is the delay between topper availability and the game availability

[31:50] I mean they they should be ready to go together I agree and look at Star Wars two years later two

[31:56] and a half years later still known topper all right so I would argue that topper a topper is a

[32:03] main revenue stream for a company to sell in addition but I do think I agree with you once

[32:10] you're spending nine to ten I think it should be included in the price because we're seeing

[32:16] the difference between a premium and an li be sometimes between twenty five hundred three thousand

[32:22] dollars so they could you know oftentimes we don't see where that value goes other than the limited

[32:28] number that seems to be where the majority of it goes all right what so I agree so topper is yes

[32:32] I think every li should have a topper what what's next I don't I think that if you're paying nine to

[32:38] ten thousand dollars you know everything should be wire form and it should be powder coated okay so

[32:44] powder coated on the armor and the wire form correct so ten dollars look you're already powder

[32:51] coating a chrome you could easily just powder coated blue red whatever it's not really going to

[32:56] cost any more money and if you're paying ten thousand you should get metal wire forms not plastic

[33:02] that can break and crack right so you don't like plastic ramps not not if you're paying ten thousand

[33:09] dollars right okay so powder coated wire forms and powder coated armor now right now the

[33:16] LEDs do come with a powder coat okay so the the main area of the game that people would

[33:24] well I have a dressing park Ellie and it is not powder coated it's chrome the the habit trails are

[33:30] chrome right nothing's powder coated no the the armor is green no the armor is I'm talking about the

[33:38] wire forms right so the wire forms are not so you want to see those now what color would you powder

[33:45] coat them in Jurassic Park um you know I don't you know some people would say powder coated the same

[33:51] color as the armor but you know like with my say creature in black Lagoon I powder coated everything

[33:56] like a like kind of like a light purple and then everything on the outside was a lime green so

[34:05] I just think you know it's case to case basis but easily it could have been green right what about

[34:11] the coin door that seems to be the one area of a game that nobody powder coats from the factory

[34:16] other than we just saw recently that Chicago gaming company is going to powder coat the coin door

[34:22] to match the armor on medieval madness royal edition but would you like to see that also powder

[34:28] coated well you know my next thing that was that I have on here is if you're buying a collector

[34:34] type game it's probably never going to get routed so I think you should have the option of eliminating

[34:39] the coin door altogether and so that that opening door could have some sort of artwork on it

[34:46] opposed to having a coin mechanism right see I I'm going to disagree with you on that one I'll

[34:53] tell you why if you do that then you have then you get into the nightmare situation of where these

[34:59] manufacturers have to now special order cabinets and and I do see a operators put L.E.'s on location

[35:08] so then you now have to take multiple orders with you know and you have to it gets too hard it's

[35:15] much easier and I think the aesthetics of a pinball machine I do I think it looks better with a coin

[35:19] door I've never seen it look better without one yeah I'm not saying not to have a door I'm just saying

[35:26] instead of coin mechs you could have just a door that has artwork on it I see what you're saying okay

[35:31] but there's just something about seeing the 25 cent coin slot that just signifies that this is

[35:41] you know a pinball machine that even though you know that is for use out in the world in our case

[35:48] it's sort of like that's the arcade symbol of a machine yeah but if you wanted it that way it would

[35:54] actually be cheaper for like Stern not to have all those coin and a lot of times you know those

[35:59] things get caught up on stuff inside I'd rather I was buying an L.E. that I was going to keep I'd

[36:04] rather have just a coin door with nothing on it and then have sticker art on it that blends into

[36:09] the cabinet it would look more detailed okay all right what is next on your list Larry okay

[36:15] external volume headphone jack okay like all J.J.P.s come with all the way back to Wizard of

[36:21] Oz there's no reason why Stern can't put this on any machine especially in L.E. right so an

[36:29] external headphone jack what the other part volume control with volume control okay so I agree

[36:36] with that here's what's interesting I've got one on my Batman some Sterns have them Jersey jacks

[36:41] have them but here's what none of them have and maybe I'm wrong but I think I'm right none of them

[36:45] have the ability to change the volume of the game from outside the game you have to open up the

[36:52] coin door and then adjust the volume that way I wish you could adjust the volume with a plus

[36:59] and minus button maybe under the cabinet somewhere but I really wish that was put into all modern

[37:04] pinball well it should be on all games and there's no reason why I can't be on a Stern L.E. for $10,000

[37:11] okay I agree external headphone jack I think everyone would agree that that is just something that

[37:16] should be probably added to all pinball machines not just the L.E.s okay what else what else you got

[37:22] this one really bothers me so like on Jurassic Park right the whole games green and the flippers

[37:28] are yellow they look hideous and then they have black rubber on it it don't match the game whatsoever

[37:35] you know there's this website called pinball decals and they sell chrome flippers chrome buttons

[37:42] why is the if the game is green why on an L.E. can't you have green flippers instead of yellow

[37:50] and yellow buttons stand out like a sore thumb on you know it doesn't belong right you follow

[37:57] and it don't make no sense this goes back to what you said about color coding yep I I again will

[38:04] agree that when you get to the L.E. range I do think the rubbers should be color coordinated with

[38:11] the game color palette and I do think the flippers yes I do agree no one likes just the standard yellow

[38:16] flippers all right so we agree on that as well and that's an easy change for them to do what's next

[38:22] side blade art and I know that they are putting it on now but like it kind of bothers me and you

[38:27] don't of course I love your J.J.P. but for $9,500 it should have side blade art or at least mere blades

[38:33] and that should be a standard on any game that's over $9,000 I'm sorry any game made for over that

[38:39] price should have side blade art on it so I'm I I'm pretty sure that every single L.E. currently comes

[38:46] with side blade art every stern does yes it is now but what I'm saying is like to say for example

[38:52] in Willy Wonka it does not and it's $9,500 but I'm saying is any game from any manufacturer

[38:59] at 9,000 plus range should either have mere blades like monster bash right it comes with mirrors

[39:06] it should either have mere blades or side blade art or something for $9,500 you should be able to

[39:10] get that right you know it's interesting you said that because in Jack's world the collector's

[39:15] edition those are the that's considered his top of the line so he does put it in that but he does

[39:20] not put the side art or the inner side blade art in the L.E. so you'd want to see that for $9,500

[39:29] anything over $9,000 should include something yeah okay I agree and that and that again that's not

[39:34] expensive also the other part about inner side blade art it's so much easier if it's installed

[39:41] at the factory before the whole play field and everything is put in on some of these games it is a

[39:46] pain in the ass because of how tight that fit is to install those things after market so I really

[39:52] wish they would just put them in from the factory all right I agree with that that makes the game

[39:57] look better what's next on your list okay so this one's an interesting one that I hope you like

[40:02] okay so like when you look at Sterns and even really Jersey Jacks all the heads are exactly

[40:09] identical and you know one of the things I really liked about Thudini is how they mixed it up and

[40:14] they made it look different and they had kind of like a like a you know it was kind of like it came

[40:20] out and it's swirled in and then back out and so I think like on an L.E. just imagine like a

[40:25] drastic park head right and it had like a chunk bit out of the side okay right you know where a T-Rex

[40:32] took a bite and then you incorporate that into the artwork but I don't understand why they can't

[40:37] change the look of the head design the way that American Pimball did because I have to give American

[40:44] people a lot of credit I really do like their other change that part of it up yeah but they didn't

[40:50] change it because they were making an L.E. they just wanted to look different than the competitors

[40:55] so it was just more about they wanted a design aesthetic I would I would argue that to me that's

[41:02] just a headache I think you're adding a whole nother layer of manufacturing and I get it it's

[41:10] you know it's like when that guy made that Indiana Jones that looks like the Disney version where he

[41:14] kind of you know made the legs look like bamboo and and it looked like it came out of like in arc and

[41:19] whatnot I I actually think Stern Stern's look great lined up next to each other as do Jersey

[41:27] Jack games because there's like a there's a beauty in symmetry when you line up games that all

[41:34] have the same back box so I would disagree there I don't think that's necessary I wouldn't expect

[41:39] to see that in an L.E. for the money I just think that would be a headache for manufacturers so

[41:44] what what else is on your list okay like bolts let hold the legs on so like for example on Jurassic

[41:51] Park you you powder coat the legs green but then you have chrome bolts why can't the bolts be powder coated

[41:58] along with the legs I I agree with that one I I've never understood that it's sort of like lug nuts

[42:06] in a car you know normally the lug nuts look better when they match the color of the wheel

[42:11] again I think that's just a cost-cutting measure for them and it can't be that expensive

[42:17] to get lug nuts to match the powder coating of the armor so I would agree that that is something

[42:23] that I would like to see changed in pinball for these prices next one okay so this one's fairly

[42:29] interesting because one of the best I think Chicago gaming really I mean I'd love to start seeing

[42:34] them make games that aren't remakes but they really take their time with these uh collector you know

[42:41] le types and when you look at monster bash it has that beautiful like plaque on the lock bar I don't

[42:47] understand why you don't get that on all le's and I'll give you an example on monsters they had

[42:53] some sort of and it's cheesy looking it's nothing on the level of Chicago gaming but it has something

[42:59] there right but then on Jurassic Park it does not so there's no like consistency here and I think

[43:05] that they should have something that decorates the lock the the button on the lock bar right I think

[43:12] it looks really good when there's an ornament that surrounds a a that when there's a button on the

[43:18] lock down bar I don't I got to be honest I don't think that big ornament that's on the bar on

[43:25] monster bash I just think that looks kind of cheesy to be honest but I do like it like the boom

[43:32] button on Deadpool you know when people make a nice sort of decoration to go around it or like on

[43:38] on pirates of the Caribbean or Willy Wonka I don't just want to have it I think I don't think it does

[43:43] no it doesn't um on pirates of the Caribbean you know people put the gold around it the barnacles

[43:48] I think that looks good but I like a nice clean lock down bar unless there's a reason to draw my

[43:56] attention there I don't want them just sticking stuff on it yeah so I like it on monster bash and

[44:04] I I think it looks nice to have some kind of wrap around around the button and something to make

[44:10] it stand out like hey this really is a collector there isn't but there is no button in monster bash

[44:16] it's just I know I know I know I got a monster bash but what I'm saying is like on monsters they

[44:21] did something but I'm dressed tall yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[44:25] okay it's it's it's hit or miss with stern in terms of how much they pay attention to that that

[44:30] area of the game but I always think if there is a button there they could do a lot to sort of

[44:35] dress up that area for the Ellie isn't I agree so all right what's next on your list Larry

[44:40] well yeah I don't mean to take a shot at Gary Stern but every time I buy an Ellie I get an

[44:45] autograph of him you know and I don't know why okay but you know here's the thing like I know you

[44:52] would love karate kid pinball game Ralph Machia would sign 500 cards or whatever that you could

[44:59] put into an Ellie for very little okay the people who were in Willie Wonka the people who are

[45:06] physically in the movie that are so live they all would have signed it for virtually nothing

[45:11] I don't want Gary Stern's autograph Adam West okay he would have you literally could have

[45:15] sent him 500 tops cards he'd signed them all for one fee and I'd rather see when you're paying

[45:22] $10 he did wait Larry he did you know that he did like Stern got five cards yeah yeah I know and then

[45:28] he held him out until and then he's gonna sell him later yeah but the reality is I bought an

[45:32] Adam West card and put it in mine so I paid a lot of money for my game but I didn't get an autograph

[45:37] but what I'm saying is like you take like Willie Wonka I don't want no offense but game designers

[45:43] autographs and so on so forth I'd rather have like the people that were in the movie to sign it

[45:48] and most of the cool things you're doing movies based on with characters that you know they only

[45:53] make money by signing autographs okay so they're very easy to obtain and there's no reason not to get

[45:59] them let me ask you a question what do you think of the signature plate on Willie Wonka

[46:04] collectors edition well it looks like a piece of metal just you know I don't like it I think

[46:11] they should have 3d printed something to go around it and I'm sure somebody like the mod

[46:17] couple will make something to improve it but then again it might cut off some of the autographs

[46:23] but I I'm 100% confident that my couple will come out with something to fix it I don't know if

[46:29] you can fix that what what do you okay I mentioned another question where do you think

[46:34] forget who's signing the game where do you think the signature should go on a pinball machine

[46:39] that looks the best well probably when you when you buy a collectors edition and this is another

[46:45] topic is these pinball like roll cards or how much the game cost to play I think when somebody's

[46:52] paying $10,000 and I'm playing a routing the game so obviously right there you know to replace like

[46:59] the the price 50 cents or $1 it should go right there right well they did that with the kiss

[47:06] signature edition like they they made a card but people complained when that was the case I actually

[47:11] really do like Stern's new approach where they have a designated area on the apron for game

[47:18] designer coder artist whatnot and it looks really clean and that was actually designed by Franchi

[47:23] but I think that to me I like because it's a permanent part of the game it's signed on the apron

[47:29] when when you sign a card it just starts to feel cheap and I think jack sort of struggled where to

[47:34] put all the signatures on the wonka collectors edition and it just yeah I just think it was

[47:40] poorly executed all right so but I I think we both agree though those yellow those yellow like

[47:46] cards that go on the left of the apron that tell you like how many quarters per player like

[47:51] one dollar per player those have to be the ugliest rule like they're and the ruleset cards right

[47:56] those ugly yellow rule set cards why can't they make beautiful artistic rule set cards for the games

[48:03] especially when it's an elite right yeah we agree the next thing I have on my list is if you do

[48:11] clear ramps and things like this then they should at least have decals in them and I shouldn't have

[48:17] to go and buy them for a really expensive game like Jurassic Park and then I buy a decal of T-Rex

[48:24] footprints okay why didn't Stern provide that right well I guess the thing with ramps

[48:33] is that not all of them look good with a decal and the decal should somehow be symbolic of the

[48:41] the area of the playfield so sometimes you might have a ramp that's supposed to be like steps and

[48:45] then you put steps there and it it makes sense the other part with decals on ramps sometimes

[48:50] is it blocks the view of what's behind that ramps I think sometimes people for you know

[48:56] the ramps are clear and the habitrails you can see past sometimes there's action behind those

[49:02] ramps you want to see and the decal could block it I don't really care about that so much Larry

[49:07] because I just think decals yeah you know I read gaming it improves the thingy nobody wants

[49:15] a ten thousand dollar game you don't want plastic anyway okay so if you were going to put it in

[49:20] there then you should have some sort of decal that dresses it up right okay all right not a big

[49:27] one for me not not a deal breaker for me but what else you got well a camera like JJP I don't

[49:34] even understand why Stern hasn't already incorporated that but like when you're putting up your high

[49:39] score that's really cool that it takes a picture or then incorporates you into the game somehow

[49:45] and if Stern doesn't want to put it on their pros that's fine okay but why can't you have it on the

[49:49] LEs right I think that might be coming I think we're going to see cameras and I think we're going

[49:56] to see internet connectivity and I think Stern is going to make it so it's easy to stream a game

[50:01] from your game so that's a good question you know Jack's got the camera now Larry but he doesn't

[50:06] really let you do much with it other than it's part of the gameplay would you like to see cameras

[50:12] have the ability to help you stream your pinball experience well I've actually said this at one

[50:20] point on Pinside that I'd really like to see like you know Xbox Live but pinball live you know

[50:25] where you can play people and your games would connect and they can see you and you can see them

[50:31] and but you can't do any of that if you don't have Wi-Fi connection so it's totally out of the

[50:36] question I think it would would really help and that's actually my next thing is Wi-Fi connection

[50:43] okay so Wi-Fi connection and pinball should be standard on all 9000 plus dollar games and I already

[50:52] touched on this one but I just it's another point that I want to make I think going forward Chicago

[50:57] game is set the new standard topper should be sculpted there should be no more toppers that aren't

[51:03] sculpted or aren't animated like the black knight topper because it's not you know it's still a

[51:10] a physical moving object okay and even with the monsters you know it does have like a mechanical

[51:18] mechanism to it that you know brings it to another level and so I think going forward though all

[51:23] toppers should be sculpted and when you're paying 10,000 you should get that let me play devil's

[51:29] advocate because I do agree that Chicago gaming delivers a beautiful package but they also have

[51:35] the advantage of having almost no R&D time or cost required for these games because they're

[51:42] remaking games that were R&D 20 years ago 25 years ago so all the money that's turned has to put

[51:48] into creating a new experience they don't have to pay for now I know there's a little cost and

[51:54] sort of you know upscaling to the new screen and LCD but they can they can put that additional

[52:00] money into sculpts and toppers and armor and so do you think that Chicago gaming company so

[52:08] someone has an advantage because they're just remaking games yeah I mean they might have somewhat

[52:15] of advantage but you know put it this way you I know I heard one of your podcasts where you

[52:19] complained about Jersey Jack not having like a shopper store okay and I agree with you because

[52:25] can you imagine people love the Hobbit movies they love Wizard of Oz they love Willy Wonka can

[52:31] you imagine going back to these games and making sculpted toppers with those characters and figures

[52:37] on top of the machine I bet you people would pay eight nine hundred dollars for those toppers

[52:42] and that's something that Jersey Jack should look into because I think it would be huge revenue

[52:48] and then the best part about it is they don't break you know right and I mean that like

[52:53] across all timball you know you put them on there and they're they're always good to go but I

[52:57] Jack could have sold the Pirates of the Caribbean topper I'm not even lying when I say this he could

[53:01] have sold that for a thousand dollars and every Ellie person went a bought one I agree and he

[53:07] should sell him and he should go back and he should get the Wizard of Oz a right to do it like a

[53:13] sculpted topper and he should do the same things for Wonka and I guarantee he would be selling

[53:18] as fast as he can make them and they're easy to make because once you have a mold you can make

[53:21] as many as you want so why are they doing these just like cheap piece of plexi like the Pirates of

[53:26] the Caribbean Ellie topper is embarrassingly bad like no effort whatsoever put into it you know I

[53:34] think on on Jersey Jack's case is they put so much effort into all the things I'm complaining

[53:41] mostly about Stern not doing that sometimes you overlook the obvious you know because you're so

[53:47] wrapped up in like when you're trying to create parts of the Caribbean you're trying to get that

[53:51] boat to work for example right I'm sure that wasn't the easiest thing in the world to do

[53:56] and you're so focused in on that that you know that you forget about like wouldn't it be cool if

[54:00] we had sculpted you know you know pirate characters and so on and so forth and I don't know I think

[54:09] that's what I've said it before there should just be a topper division within every pinball company

[54:15] and I think the topper division can actually drive significant revenue if you had a little

[54:21] team of people working on each one for each game okay what is next on your list they'd be cheap

[54:26] to make what's next in your list uh this is like really noise the hell out of me uh on Stern games

[54:33] and I'm gonna put two together one when you lift up your game in a stern Ellie or stern

[54:39] anything right number one you have to take the balls out because they won't put in a five cent

[54:45] flap like they have in a Jersey Jack game so the balls don't fly out why don't they have that on all

[54:51] games but not to mention Ellie's maybe you could explain I agree that should be in that's that's

[54:57] lazy that that is not part of all modern pinball machine so we agree there I guess we could also

[55:03] the is the next one the railing system in the game so the the play could doesn't fly out of the

[55:08] cabinet and well I've had two different Ellie's from Stern where they the game is literally fallen

[55:15] into the cap right now that that's an excusable that's an excusable and they've put the cheapest

[55:21] rail system I've ever seen on there it's not even closer what they did in the 90s but clearly

[55:26] Jersey Jack has the best one the games can't fall in and if you take the play field out for any

[55:31] reason you can set it on the ground you cannot do that with a stern but why you're charging

[55:36] $10,000 and you can't make it so that you could set your play field on the ground or put a rail

[55:41] system I mean that's just as mind boggling right okay why I agree I agree regardless of Ellie or not

[55:48] I think that should be implemented into all games uh $6,000 and above okay what else is on your list

[55:55] the next one we kind of already talked about is just aprons in general and I really hate the price cards

[56:01] on an Ellie you're buying a collector game you should get full color uh beautiful artwork to stick

[56:07] in those slots and in case you are going to put it on route you can get the other ones but for

[56:12] $10,000 or more dollars you should be able to get that yeah and I also think for the Ellie's

[56:18] they should really look at the apron as as artwork and if you want why not just do the rule cards

[56:25] as maybe magnetize you ever see when people make like new apron artwork and it's magnetize like

[56:30] it'd be really easy to just do that for operators but if you're not operating I think that apron is

[56:37] is a great piece of real estate for some amazing artwork to be put into a game yeah you know another

[56:44] thing that I think would be great is a pinball games had like a story modes or options like you

[56:53] know you do on a video game so if it's you could put it in home uh mode and then you can continue

[56:58] game so you could lose and you can continue from where you left off all right let's see this so

[57:03] I want to make sure these are things that Ellie's should have versus because now we're we're bleeding

[57:08] into just all pinball should have stuff like that so I want to make sure we stay focused on what

[57:14] should be in a 9000 plus game um I think that's I think that's all pinball should have that what

[57:20] what else is on your list of of like it should be in the high end version well like uh for example

[57:25] like when you talk about like it's like stern might put in an extra like ramp that lifts up and

[57:31] then you know whatever why not put extra stuff in the code for example in the Star Wars game you

[57:38] have like you can avoid asteroids with the flippers it's like a video mode wouldn't have been

[57:43] cool to have the same thing in Jurassic Park where you shoot down like a bunch of loss of raptors

[57:48] and you could put those like extra little uh uh things in the game I think uh and I think the

[57:55] game would be a lot more fun I I 100% agree with you if what you're saying and I think you're saying

[58:00] this that Ellie machines should have exclusive modes and gameplay experiences I'm paying more

[58:09] for example and I'm gonna give you a prime example you agree with that yeah and I have a prime

[58:13] example for you so I walked up to Stern's booth one time at iapah and I said you know uh you

[58:20] know I bought arrowsmith and I said the funniest thing is their greatest song ever doesn't include

[58:28] uh isn't included on the game you know and they're like I said so why wasn't that song

[58:34] uh on the game and they said well because they wanted a hundred and fifty dollars extra per game

[58:39] then why didn't you put it on an elite your charge in ten thousand dollars add the freaking extra

[58:44] arrowsmith song okay for a hundred and fifty dollars a game that you're doing a hundred and fifty

[58:49] times five hundred and then you're saying hey if you pay ten thousand you get the greatest arrow

[58:54] smith song that they I mean look at rancor it's rank number one Larry Larry we've talked about this

[59:00] arrowsmith song before I'm gonna you're you're now forbidden from talking about that song up

[59:05] yeah on every podcast I no one even bought arrowsmith the game so let's just leave that

[59:10] what what next all Ellie's obviously should have an upper play field or a lower play field and

[59:18] when you look at Jurassic Park it doesn't have one yeah I mean I don't agree with that I think

[59:25] the designer you can't I don't think you can have a designer say hey you got to put in an

[59:30] upper or lower play field I think there should be an upper or lower play field because it makes

[59:35] sense depending on the theme of the game and and like I would argue Jurassic Park as it has a damn

[59:41] T-rex up in it you know I'd rather have that T-rex which is awesome and functions incredibly well

[59:48] versus like the crappy upper play field in game of thrones right you know so I just think you go

[59:53] by I think you just you designed it according to the theme if it warrants it great if not

[59:58] fine like I'm okay with that you know like like it's like the lower play field on the monsters adds

[01:00:03] nothing it looks cool one of the most unsatisfying things to actually flip well I think you're

[01:00:11] gonna agree with this one no plastic art period okay so like you take monsters and uh the there's

[01:00:20] a plastic grandpa okay but then mod couple makes a you know a 3d printed uh uh uh grandpa

[01:00:29] sitting in an electric chair why do you have plastic you know like art on the game anywhere if you

[01:00:34] pay $10,000 yeah I mean it look it's I think there are definitely areas of a game where they

[01:00:44] cheap out and they should have sculpts or molds in places of the game and and I do agree with that

[01:00:49] we should get them but you know go look at magic girl the most beautiful pinball ever and most of

[01:00:55] the art is on plastic but it's it's layered so nicely that it doesn't feel cheap um but I do

[01:01:02] agree that there should be more you know sculpts in a game um for what we pay because I mean look

[01:01:07] it spooky look at all the sculpting you get in Alice Cooper's nightmare castle way more sculpting

[01:01:12] in that game than you get even in a $9,000 stern game by next thing is uh and you're gonna

[01:01:19] like these next few uh well this one maybe it's being petty but I'd like to see themed flasher's okay

[01:01:27] like in for Batman 66 I think with mod couple made those uh the things that replace it and makes

[01:01:33] it look like the siren from the uh from the back back art yeah I mean it's like why do we have

[01:01:40] these like one 15 cent plastic you know they you they don't help the theme eat okay and like for

[01:01:47] parts of the Caribbean mod couple made you know like a t and t barrel or something or whiskey but

[01:01:52] rum barrel that went over it I mean why can't you have themed flasher's right okay yeah I mean

[01:01:58] that'd be nice again not a deal breaker not a deal breaker for me I'll take what this one here

[01:02:03] this goes to show like how much I put into the thinking of this why in the world for spending $10,000

[01:02:10] don't you get a keychain I think you you get don't you don't you get the chain plastic no you

[01:02:17] for dressing park you did not get a keychain okay you didn't but whenever you buy like for example

[01:02:22] I get keychains for anything I buy from Chicago gaming you get a keychain but whenever I buy

[01:02:28] something from stern I don't get a keychain I got a keychain in my Batman and so maybe it's

[01:02:33] I see that's another point that you know where they're inconsistent okay so they put something

[01:02:37] around the lock bar button then they don't I mean there's gotta be some currency for $10,000 you

[01:02:43] should get a keychain yeah I'm again that's I think that's as I think that's as miniscule and trivial

[01:02:48] when it comes to whether or not you're gonna go in on a $9,000 game but what what else you got

[01:02:52] anything else big any big ticket items in viziglass why isn't in viziglass on every 10,000 it is

[01:03:00] it's not on stern yet is you get you get you get you get that you get the non-reflective with the

[01:03:05] LEs it doesn't look like it I'm pretty sure you do well that's my entire list okay let me

[01:03:16] throw let me throw a few others out there for you but I have a I have a great idea for you though

[01:03:20] no no no no no no no you're not gonna go off track because no it's about stern and vaults

[01:03:27] what I'd like to see in a vault well that's not what we're talking about on this on this podcast

[01:03:30] so we're gonna we're gonna keep it focused because here's here's a few other things I think we

[01:03:35] should get in every Ellie that's 9,000 or above I do think there should be unique playfield artwork

[01:03:46] I don't think the artwork on the playfield should look the same as the premium or the pro

[01:03:51] and I think I think you know that's what I would like to see unique playfield artwork I would

[01:03:56] also like for there to be an extended warranty period on the more expensive pins yeah those are

[01:04:04] good points I didn't think of those too so if I'm buying a 9,000 dollar pin or 12,000 dollar pin I

[01:04:09] want like a two-year head to toe coverage on this thing that just lets me know you have my back I

[01:04:16] mean I saw this week and I have to confirm this that stern is now no longer gonna send people

[01:04:22] fully populated playfields as a solution if their playfields have issues I don't want to spend

[01:04:27] 9,000 dollars and and and not you know get a replacement if my playfields defective other things Larry

[01:04:38] I would like to see you know I I would like to see more customization and if you're only making

[01:04:46] 250 and you know who your buyers are and you have Elvira in the studio in the booth and you're

[01:04:55] you have Lyman coding this game over two years I would love to see there be more custom call-outs

[01:05:02] and I mean that because it's just so much fun when you own a game that has just a little bit

[01:05:08] of a customization for you and especially when it's coded that way it it really makes you never

[01:05:16] want to get rid of the pin well you're right and by the way going back to Elvira that game was 92

[01:05:22] 9,500 Elvira she makes a living sign autographs she could have signed all 500 of the LEDs I mean come

[01:05:29] on that should have been a no-brainer she's making money every time the game sells she should have

[01:05:33] signed every one right well I mean they gave you a piece of couch on a piece of paper that's ridiculous

[01:05:42] right all right well so I guess that concludes our things we'd like to see in limited edition

[01:05:48] machines um Larry we have a few more minutes let's talk I mean I'm going to give you one more

[01:05:55] topic you can talk about that or we can talk about iapa and if you think iapa is a show that

[01:06:01] manufacturers need to be at and why they need to be there well uh uh two things as first off iapa

[01:06:09] is the biggest amusement show in the world okay um it's almost a million square feet um it's

[01:06:16] gotten so big it's even outgrown the Orlando Convention Center which is one of the biggest in the

[01:06:21] world and so now they set up tents outside and then they take a huge section of the parking lot

[01:06:26] and they set stuff up out there it's well over a million square feet it attracts 25 to 30,000

[01:06:32] people anybody who loves pinball would love iapa because all the games are on free play every

[01:06:39] game you could imagine uh you could there's rides you can ride everybody who sells pizza to roller

[01:06:44] coasters and everything between is there but i did uh look for you and there's five manufacturers

[01:06:50] of pinball that are going to be at iapa and for the first time ever american pinball is going to be there

[01:06:57] right i wonder if they're going to bring their redemption game they've been working on it would

[01:07:01] seem to make sense to bring that well i can tell you that any manufacturer um

[01:07:09] you know if they're trying to get a game done they want to get it done you know uh before iapa

[01:07:14] or for iapa so last year sterren brought beetles to iapa didn't even have code on it you know they

[01:07:20] just kind of sort of turned it on and they supposedly put the code on that night um so you if you

[01:07:27] have a new game you definitely want to get it uh because see here's a thing the bowling industry has

[01:07:32] their own trade show the coin up in a tree has their own trade show right and they're all very small

[01:07:37] only this show has everybody all in one spot right and this show is next week uh i don't know

[01:07:44] when you're airing this podcast but yeah you go to air tomorrow morning probably but i but you think

[01:07:51] for iapa though it isn't that more for it's for operators around the world to figure out what

[01:07:55] to put on location right well i mean it's uh it's any it's like everything park in the world goes to

[01:08:02] and then everybody who runs any kind of amusement operation will be there um even like a lot of uh

[01:08:09] for example i met movie studio people there i met like people who own uh sports franchises like

[01:08:15] the milwaki bucks because they have these new arenas they try to do other things so yeah i mean

[01:08:21] absolutely you know jersey jack has a big presence there sterren has a big booth american pimp ball

[01:08:26] chicago gaming has a really nice booth there um and uh so yeah i mean if uh if there's any going

[01:08:34] to be anything new revealed okay i'm hopefully it will be revealed um right there and you know

[01:08:39] what the great thing about iap is it's is that florida uh pinball show is usually right before it

[01:08:45] during it or right after so i think this year it comes right after so the jersey jacks the sterrens

[01:08:51] they just stay behind right and they go to that thing right it doesn't seem like sterren is

[01:08:56] is gonna reveal their next cornerstone as early as iap i think we're gonna maybe have to wait to

[01:09:02] December for that uh so it doesn't seem like the show itself will have a big reveal take place uh

[01:09:09] but it sounds like everyone will bring what they have available right now to order so you'll see

[01:09:14] jack with wonka and you'll see chicago gaming with medieval madness and monster bash and all that

[01:09:19] yeah and you never know i mean you you won't know till you get there but when i'm setting up my

[01:09:23] booth i i'll tell you you'll be the first to know right i'll send you pictures all right lara

[01:09:28] i'm gonna give you one more topic to quickly discuss so i'm gonna let you go okay on sterren okay

[01:09:35] yep uh i think a lot of people would like to buy a vault um you know uh gain a specifically you

[01:09:43] know like tron or something of this nature or even gain a throne i would love to see sterren

[01:09:48] switch these games to the new spike system right and put a color screen go back get the rights to

[01:09:55] show clips and so on and so forth and put a color screen in it opposed to the dot matrix that they

[01:10:01] should have replaced a long time ago i think of stern does vaults they should do them only as

[01:10:07] alleys and that's why i think it's rolled into this topic and they should change them over with full

[01:10:12] size so they don't have to change the game just change what you see on the screen i think that would

[01:10:18] be a huge improvement right well i mean i you like the game but that's not that's not a new wish

[01:10:26] we've been the last since they went to the LCD the room you know people have been speculating whether

[01:10:31] or not they could uh a lot of work has to be done the switch over from from the sam system

[01:10:37] to the to the spike and i think that i don't know if they they want to invest the time to do that the

[01:10:43] other issues they have to renegotiate a lot of the rights here's what i think i would love to see in

[01:10:46] pinball because i do agree that would be great but i would i also think would be awesome is if pinball

[01:10:52] companies would actually open up the source code of their games so that the community could go in

[01:11:00] and put in all of the clips from the movies with the actors and just release those

[01:11:06] codes through the fan community you know how awesome would it be if people could go in and make

[01:11:12] a pie or to the Caribbean using the clips from the movie and just drop those in throughout the game

[01:11:19] same with like Lord the Rings if you vaulted it you don't have to redo the code just instead of

[01:11:25] having it be the DMD graphics you show the movie clip from those scenes when those scenes are

[01:11:30] happening it'd be easy to do but they'll never get the rights you'd have to open it up for the

[01:11:35] fans to do it versus like going in new lines cinema and whatnot we know it's interesting about

[01:11:41] Game of Thrones and another game like Spider-Man is they are using clips from the movie and whenever

[01:11:48] you colorize them they actually look terrible okay i always tell people don't put color screens

[01:11:55] on movie on games like Game of Thrones because they're showing tv clips and it looks faded out

[01:12:01] so in Game of Thrones they are using clips from the TV show saying Spider-Man so I don't know if

[01:12:07] you could go back vault those and use those clips because you already got permission to do so in

[01:12:12] first place but I would I would go back and buy those games if it had clips from the films personally

[01:12:20] with all the games coming out I just think we're looking forward I don't think we're looking

[01:12:27] back and Stern has made some great games everyone has made some great games but it just

[01:12:31] boars me to death when these manufacturers keep looking backwards when we should we should there's

[01:12:38] so much new stuff I mean how many remakes of Wizard of Oz do we need or this or that like let's

[01:12:44] focus on making new stuff if look if you want to make an all new Tron game how awesome would it be

[01:12:50] to make an all new lure the rings game that's the other part right why does it always have to be a

[01:12:54] remake why can't we just reimagine or or a completely new lure the rings pinball machine based on

[01:13:00] the first three movies with all the new technologies all the new knowledge and understanding of

[01:13:06] of innovation and magic that can go into a pinball game why not just make another one I mean if I

[01:13:12] were Jack I would have got the license for the first three movies again versus making the hobbit

[01:13:18] well I think you'd like to see back to the future right everybody would I mean back to the future

[01:13:24] goonies you know I think all the eighties nostalgia stuff would play well stranger things you know

[01:13:30] we keep hearing everyone say stranger things I mean I don't I mean where they're smoked maybe

[01:13:34] there's fire maybe that's Brian I wouldn't do stranger things because I think sometimes things are

[01:13:40] fads and they wear out and you know I stopped watching stranger things after the second season because

[01:13:46] it was just so boring I'd rather see them do something that is had the test of time

[01:13:54] and that is you know it's gonna stand on its own and plus stranger things I don't know that it fits

[01:14:00] in that wheelhouse of the demographic of who actually is buying pinball games you know the 40 to

[01:14:06] 60 year olds I'd rather see goonies or something or you know I tell you Beetlejuice I think would

[01:14:12] have been a great one I would have been the first I think these all are strong themes I think

[01:14:17] stranger things actually does have a pretty wide demo and you should watch season three because

[01:14:21] it's amazing season two is a little like and we've seen this before but season three got it back

[01:14:26] on track but you know look I also don't want pinball to only be an nostalgia play if you remember

[01:14:34] like all throughout the 90s we got so many pinball machines that were based on the current hot

[01:14:39] movies and TV shows and not not as much anymore not as much it's become more expensive to do that

[01:14:47] but like I would happily love a Ghostbusters and I would happily love a John Wick you know

[01:14:53] all within the same year yeah I'd love to see Ghostbusters with the movie clips but you know there's

[01:14:59] also a lot of bands out there that haven't been touched like Nirvana that should be one you

[01:15:03] could easily get because the rights were sold to a company that all they do is licensed so I don't

[01:15:09] know why there hasn't been an Nirvana game but there's a lot of bands I'd love to see a Beastie

[01:15:14] Boys game I'd love to see a Michael Jackson game there's a lot of music pins that are still waiting

[01:15:20] to be done queen I'd love to see that one but you know it's really expensive though the license

[01:15:26] that the hit songs for the games and that that's always the challenge I mean and that's that's

[01:15:30] where you coming with an LE you pay more you get more I agree I agree well Larry look I want to

[01:15:35] thank you for taking the time to go down your list of things that should be in LE's and some

[01:15:41] additional things that should just be standard in Pimble any final words for the listeners of

[01:15:47] the show well I know a lot a lot of Pimble people probably will not be at iAPA but if anything

[01:15:57] you know makes a splash there tune in to canada because I will forward them to his personal cell phone

[01:16:05] and I will make sure he gets them so he can reveal whatever happens at iAPA you'll find out

[01:16:10] about it right away all right cool and I'll upload those to facebook if I get anything well Larry thank

[01:16:15] you so much yeah thank you for taking the time and we'll talk to you soon hey no problem man you take

[01:16:20] it easy all right later

[01:16:40] yeah
