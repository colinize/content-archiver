[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:16] We're gonna get a new pinball machine this week from Spooky Pinball.

[00:21] It is November 20th and they are going to reveal tomorrow the theme of their new game

[00:28] which I revealed to everybody how many years ago Evil Dead 1 and 2, ready to come out from

[00:35] Spooky Pinball.

[00:36] And what's exciting about this game is we know that Spooky Pinball loves these themes

[00:42] and they are very passionate about these movies.

[00:45] You know, they grew up watching all these horror films.

[00:49] You could argue that maybe Chuck should not have let his kids watch all these horror movies,

[00:54] but it sure has turned into a beneficial thing as Spooky Pinball gets ready to release Evil

[01:00] Dead 1 and 2.

[01:02] It is based on those two movies and they are gonna have all the assets, they're gonna have

[01:07] Bruce Campbell do the call-outs, they're gonna have everything you want if you love those

[01:12] two movies in this pinball machine.

[01:15] It is not gonna have a spinning cabin.

[01:19] Thank you, Gary Hardy.

[01:20] Now all of a sudden he knows everything because he's seen the game.

[01:25] Carrie, thank you so much for debunking the rest of us out there who speculate time and

[01:31] time again as you sit back and get it right after you've seen everything.

[01:37] It's gonna be a multi-tiered game with four flippers, one of which is hidden.

[01:43] You can't see it.

[01:44] How are you gonna know how to flip it if you can't see it?

[01:47] That's gonna be interesting.

[01:49] And there's gonna be a ton of theme integration.

[01:52] Carrie said something that was funny.

[01:54] This is gonna be Spooky's Godzilla.

[01:57] Alright, well Godzilla's the number one game of all time, but what he means by that is

[02:03] his game is gonna be loaded.

[02:06] It's gonna have a lot of stuff in it.

[02:09] It's also gonna nail the theme integration much like Godzilla.

[02:13] Is it gonna shoot as good as Godzilla?

[02:16] Probably not.

[02:17] Spooky's recent games have shot pretty well.

[02:21] And this is also not gonna be a game where they're gonna make another theme on the design.

[02:27] So you're gonna get Evil Dead 1 and 2.

[02:30] You're not gonna have to look down the row and see someone playing Looney Tunes.

[02:35] You know, or watch someone playing like Care Bears Pimball sharing the design with Evil

[02:40] Dead.

[02:41] It is gonna be Evil Dead.

[02:44] And so we're gonna get the theme revealed tomorrow, which is what?

[02:47] Thursday.

[02:48] And then the game is gonna be revealed in all of its glory on Friday.

[02:54] Order banks are gonna open up on Friday, which is great.

[02:58] You're gonna get a chance to get one.

[03:00] I'm not 100% sure about that, but they're gonna reveal the game.

[03:02] They might do something where order banks open up on Monday, but to be honest, if they

[03:09] do it right, when you reveal your game, you wanna take money instantly.

[03:14] Don't give people time to think about it.

[03:17] Don't give people too much time to go on pin side and be talked out of it.

[03:22] But I do find it amazing that Spooky Pimball has once again found the perfect window to

[03:30] launch a pinball machine.

[03:32] And look, right now, when you look at Pimball, it's really shaping up to be Sternes number

[03:37] one.

[03:39] And Spooky Pimball is number two.

[03:40] I mean that.

[03:41] I feel like Spooky Pimball is now the second best company in all of Pimball when it comes

[03:48] to launching games, when it comes to theme integration, when it comes to executing a reveal

[03:55] properly, right?

[03:57] They're not gonna do this long drawn out teaser campaign.

[04:01] I mean, everyone did that last time.

[04:03] It didn't really work out.

[04:05] I think this is the better way to do it.

[04:07] I really do.

[04:08] Unless you have a theme like Elton John, you gotta give it a long runway or a theme like

[04:12] Avatar or a theme like Godfather or a theme like Toy Story 4.

[04:16] You know what I'm saying?

[04:17] It's like Spooky Pimball is gonna have.

[04:19] This is crazy.

[04:20] They're gonna have more toys in a game than Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:26] So tell me they're not now the number two company.

[04:29] They're gonna have better theme integration in their machine than Jersey Jack Pimball.

[04:35] Yeah, it's not gonna look as good as Avatar, but it's gonna be more fun.

[04:39] I can guarantee you that right now because it's gonna be campy.

[04:43] It's gonna have perfect theme integration and it's gonna have toys and mechs.

[04:47] And what more do we want in Pimball?

[04:49] And I guarantee you the multi-level gameplay is gonna be more satisfying than going underneath

[04:54] in those lower playfields in Avatar.

[04:57] And here's the best news.

[04:58] This game's gonna cost less than $10,000.

[05:01] I'm sure if you add the butter cabinet and maybe a topper, you might get over $10,000,

[05:06] but you're gonna be able to get this game for less than $10,000.

[05:12] Can't say that about X-Men LE.

[05:14] Can't say that about Avatar LE or CE.

[05:17] And so coming Friday, Evil Dead 1 and 2 for less than $10,000.

[05:22] There's also gonna be less than a thousand units made.

[05:26] I can tell you right now, Canadian Exclusive, I'm gonna give it to you like this.

[05:30] They are gonna make less than 900 Evil Dead games, but more games than X-Men LE has.

[05:39] So do the math.

[05:40] You got a one in seven chance of getting that right.

[05:43] So less than 900 games, less than $10,000, loaded with toys, perfect theme integration,

[05:52] maybe not the theme for every one of you, but when a theme integration is done right,

[05:57] it's the greatest way to get into a theme for people.

[06:00] You're not gonna be staring at muted clips.

[06:02] You're not gonna have an auto plunger not working.

[06:05] You're not gonna have incomplete code.

[06:07] Ben Heck has been working on this code.

[06:09] And when this game comes out on Friday, the code is gonna be solid.

[06:13] And maybe the best news, the game is already on the line.

[06:17] They are happy there are no windows in the new spooky facility.

[06:21] The game is already on the line.

[06:23] Now I don't think you're gonna see games shipped in a week or two.

[06:27] They're most likely gonna come out maybe end of December, early January, but they're making

[06:32] games and they are ahead of schedule.

[06:35] And they've never revealed a game where the game's already on the line when they reveal

[06:40] it.

[06:41] This company has grown up.

[06:43] They're making smart moves.

[06:45] This is still not a theme for me.

[06:47] They're gonna get to a theme I really want.

[06:50] I'm also here to tell you that Steve Ritchie is not working on Sonic the Hedgehog.

[06:55] So if Jersey Jack has the license, I have no idea who's working on it.

[07:00] Maybe it's Mark Sidon because he likes video games.

[07:02] He made a Metroid game.

[07:04] What else is going on in Pinball?

[07:06] Let's just go back for a second to that Metallica topper.

[07:09] How can you put so much effort into Metallica, Ellie and premium and make it gorgeous?

[07:15] It's a stunning machine.

[07:17] And then you just give up on the topper?

[07:21] What's up with you, Stern?

[07:22] You're like the biggest pinball company in the world.

[07:25] The most creative people in the industry.

[07:29] And then you make a lazy topper with just the name Metallica and four flasher caps, whatever

[07:35] you call those damn things.

[07:37] It's a part bin's thing.

[07:38] How cheap is that?

[07:40] You've got this incredible artist who made this incredible new Metallica machine and

[07:45] you couldn't incorporate any of his artwork into a topper?

[07:49] What are you doing?

[07:50] I'm so tired of this.

[07:52] We need companies who think it through everything through.

[07:56] And that is why I'm happy that Spooky Pinball is making this game because they're passionate

[08:01] about these themes.

[08:02] They don't leave loose ends untied.

[08:05] And also it's like they wake up and they want to make these themes.

[08:10] This is stuff that means a lot to them where I feel like some other designers and some

[08:15] other companies, they're just answering an assignment and this is not going to be that

[08:19] game.

[08:20] I'm super excited to see more about this game.

[08:23] I haven't seen anything.

[08:24] They haven't given me anything other than a flyer that says Evil Dead 1 and 2.

[08:29] So it is Evil Dead 1 and 2.

[08:31] And hey, if they really want me to hype this game before Friday, give me some images,

[08:35] bug.

[08:36] I know you're listening to this, Luke and Bug.

[08:38] Just sneak a little image.

[08:40] CanadianPinball at gmail.com.

[08:43] And let me just see it.

[08:44] I give you my word.

[08:45] I won't leak it.

[08:46] I am personally telling everybody I will not leak it.

[08:49] You can watermark it.

[08:50] You can put whatever you want on it.

[08:52] I'm not going to leak it.

[08:53] Let me see the damn game, Canada out.
