[00:00] One one is a white wine clear star bright. There's no evidence of gas refluxulation the one is a light stroke core

[00:05] Consistent to green reflections in the edge medium concentration of color

[00:09] We're almost coming out of like this lime candy lime zest

[00:19] You hear that guy describing a wine if you guys have seen the movie saw

[00:23] You've seen how stupid and ridiculous it is when these guys like try to describe and determine where the wines come from

[00:30] That's how stupid people sound trying to describe why they like or don't like pinball machines

[00:37] I mean it is getting to the point now where can't people just realize that a

[00:42] Pinball machine is a

[00:45] subjective

[00:46] Experience okay, which means I might love the habit or I might hate the fucking habit now

[00:52] I get it and I get it people are gonna to discuss it at nausea

[00:56] But it's gotten to the point now when I read some of the way people describe these machines

[01:01] It's it's beyond the machines

[01:04] Subjectivity it's now turns into the realm of just I think pinball fanboys are actually mentally challenged

[01:11] I think a lot of you guys are really really mentally challenged and the thread that really just made me want to pull my hair out

[01:18] When I keep reading it because it's just it's full of like idiotic statements left and right

[01:22] It's like it's like too idiots playing tennis and the rackets are tied behind their backs and they're hitting the ball

[01:28] They're foreheads. I mean that's what it looks like on pinside these days. Let's see

[01:32] There's a thread that's just basically says is ghost busters the greatest pinball machine ever right and just asking that question gets like

[01:41] Nothing but downvotes so right there you can't even ask if this pinball machine

[01:47] Which is really popular which a lot of people really love you can't even ask if it's the greatest machine of all time

[01:52] Why not why not why can't you even ask that question that just obsets people and I think people are

[01:58] Downvoting it because we're saying it's not and that's cool

[02:01] But I think the real question is this who gives a shit what the greatest pinball machine of all time is does anyone really care?

[02:11] Does it matter?

[02:12] Does it really matter?

[02:15] Does it matter because if you have the greatest pinball machine of all time?

[02:18] It's gonna be worth more. I don't know

[02:21] medieval madness is number one right now and I think medieval madness is not as fun as ghost busters there

[02:27] I said it I have more fun playing ghost busters

[02:30] I don't know maybe because it's new and that's a fair point

[02:33] I don't think a machine that's 20 years old is gonna be able to compare with new machines that come out that are just new

[02:40] They're exciting because they're new right fun wears off on games

[02:45] You don't hear people talking about a grand theft auto from 15 years ago, right?

[02:51] They're talking about the new one so the fact that we think that 20 year old machines and brand new machines can be

[02:59] Can be weighed equally and judged equally is idiotic

[03:04] So I think ghost busters just because it's new is probably more fun and enjoyable for almost everybody to play if you have a

[03:09] collection of machines

[03:11] It's gonna be more fun to play than stuff that you've been playing for years. It's just that simple

[03:16] Right doesn't make it better. I don't know. I think better is like such a subjective term with pinball

[03:22] And then and then you have guys that are like well you have to wait

[03:27] Five years before you can determine if a machine is really great and seriously when I read people say that about a pinball

[03:35] Bishied I literally just want to like close out of this podcast

[03:39] I want to just sell all my machines and I want to just stop hanging around

[03:44] People who say the dumbest shit like that you after wait five years before you can tell if your ghost busters is really a keeper

[03:52] Really fuck you. No, you don't you don't have to wait five years a pinball machine should

[03:58] Immediately be fun. It shouldn't take five years for you to figure out whether or not the game is great

[04:05] Or a classic it doesn't take that long if it takes you that long again

[04:10] I think there's something seriously fucking wrong with you five years five years

[04:15] Look I get it that some machines after five years might not be boring right Lord the Rings might still be a

[04:23] Challenge and still be rewarding for people, but if I look at the pins that are still

[04:29] relevant right or still enjoyable over a long period of time, you know stuff like Adam's family Twilight zone medieval madness

[04:38] You know these are just games that are good

[04:41] They're still enjoyable to play the same way I can still go play

[04:46] Donkey Kong and Pac-Man and punch out in the arcade and Street Fighter 2 and have a good time

[04:51] But for fuck's sake guys you don't have to wait five years to determine whether or not you think ghost busters is a

[04:58] Great great game, but here's a thing about pinball games that I think people just miss is that everything is gonna get old

[05:07] Everything is gonna get boring. I don't care how

[05:11] Awesome a game is it's gonna get stale and if you think that you're just gonna enjoy it forever

[05:18] And it's never gonna get old and it's never gonna get boring. I think you're wrong

[05:22] I think you're wrong and I see guys with like these rows of collections and

[05:27] Why why does a guy like frolic need another one need another one need another one because they're chasing that feeling

[05:35] Of the honeymoon period when they have a brand new pinball machine and the whole experience is new

[05:40] I mean isn't really that much fun after having Metallica for two or three years to keep playing Metallica

[05:48] Do people really really get into it the way they used to? No, they don't and are they gonna have more fun on ghost busters?

[05:55] Yes, so what they're what the point is is there's a shelf life for fun

[06:01] Things will decrease in fun the more time you have them

[06:05] They're not gonna keep getting better and better and better. That's not gonna happen. You're gonna get bored

[06:10] It's a fucking toy, all right, and then you got guys like I look I love the black night

[06:16] This guy is a wealth of knowledge

[06:18] But every time he talks me I feel like he's talking to me from like 1990

[06:23] It's like we get it man at Chris you have such knowledge of pinball history

[06:27] But history is not just always repeating itself right there are gonna be variables that are different in the present

[06:35] You can't look at sales as indication of if a game is better

[06:41] So the the game that everyone always holds up is Adam's family sold 20,000 units, which is fucking incredible

[06:48] There will never be a game that ever sells 20,000 units ever again our Cades are gone

[06:55] Right there used to be our Cades all over America

[06:58] You could find Pimball machine all over the place there were Pimball machines and fucking bodegas and Chinese restaurants

[07:05] Admisfamily sold tons because it was during the resurgence of the 90s arcade

[07:10] But what do you people forget is the resurgence of the arcade in the early 90s?

[07:15] Wasn't because of pinball it was because of one game and one game only it was because of Street Fighter 2

[07:22] Don't ever think that pinball brought our Cades back in the early 90s

[07:26] And that's why Adam's family was so popular Adam's family rode the wave of Street Fighter 2

[07:31] Street Fighter 2 and the fighting game resurgence of the arcade right where you could play against someone instead of just playing the computer

[07:38] That's what created the early 90s arcade boom all right and Street Fighter 2 as much as Adam's family was so successful

[07:45] Street Fighter 2 sold like 200,000 plus units of Street Fighter 2 so once again our Cades far more popular than pinball

[07:53] But anyway if you think that Adam's family selling 20,000 units is indication that it's the best game ever

[08:00] I don't necessarily agree with that. I think it's a great game

[08:04] But you can't look at volume. That's my point. You can't look at volume is the Honda Civic the best car out there

[08:10] I mean they sell more Honda Civic and they sell of any fucking enthusiast car. It's not you could argue that the Mazda Miara

[08:18] That might be the best sports car of all time because it sold the most units

[08:21] But I would even argue against that but again all these arguments are subjective and they are simply stupid

[08:27] But what's crazy which crazy in this thread of is ghost busters the greatest pinball machine of all time is you get the same

[08:36] Freaking clowns making the same arguments over and over again

[08:40] People who own ghost busters Ellie love it and then you got people who don't even own it who haven't played it that much

[08:47] Who just like the shit on the fact that people are enjoying it?

[08:50] That is what sucks about pin side. Pin side is the only place where when you come on there and you're like

[08:56] Hey, I got my ghost busters Ellie. I love it and the next thread is like yeah, I think the game fucking sucks

[09:02] Like that's pin side and it's fucking stupid

[09:05] It happens all the time. You're these guys like who get

[09:09] God bless the guys who get the hobbit those people get like shit on

[09:14] Every day by people who are just like yeah

[09:17] Congratulations, you just got an $8,000 piece of shit. You don't see that in other hobbies people don't shit on each other's

[09:24] Purchases the way they do in pinball. I mean we're I'm on other forms transformer forms

[09:29] I'm on claw but when the club is a great one is a great example

[09:33] Club is a community where people are buying different arcade games and when someone goes and gets like an arcade game

[09:39] Nobody is like oh you got a major havoc. What a piece of fucking shit. You got ripped off. No

[09:45] They all like congratulate each other because they're actually happy that people are

[09:50] Supporting the hobby and keeping video games in arcade games alive

[09:55] But in pinball if you read the way people act it's like a constant civil fucking war between people on the titles

[10:03] Right, and then you got guys that are like professional trolls like my good friend crazy levy you guys all fall for levy's bullshit in every thread

[10:11] He comes on there and says

[10:13] Stern stars is better than Ghostbusters and what happens you guys fucking react to it

[10:19] Are you fucking kidding me levy? Let me know what he's doing

[10:22] He knows how to fucking get people's blood boiling

[10:26] There is no way that game is more enjoyable than Ghostbusters. There is no way all right

[10:32] All these like guys who grew up in the EM error who like still think these like

[10:37] Classic games are better than the new stuff. That's fine and look it might be for them

[10:42] But it's not for me and I know it's not for a lot of you collectors out there you want the news stuff all right

[10:48] And then what I love to is like there's just one guy who just can't get over the fucking realities of Ghostbusters and

[10:55] How many times can rare heroes say this and I keep it?

[10:58] I've been fighting Greg on to the show like man you need to just stop

[11:02] You need to stop in every single thread

[11:05] Wining about the coding Ghostbusters. This is what he writes

[11:09] Okay, and this is what this is why I think Ghostbusters is one of the greatest pinball machines ever because

[11:14] Even knowing all the issues right and these issues are not just code related. They're not just like tight shots

[11:21] They're they're not about like even with chipping playfields even with ghosted inserts even with like

[11:26] I swear to god like Ghostbusters like the coin door could open up and castrate you and people would still be like

[11:32] All right, but I'm still gonna buy it and see if it doesn't chop my nuts off like that's how much people love this title

[11:38] Is they're willing to accept so much bad because what they see and what they get from the experience is so fucking good so

[11:47] Rare hero writes well I agree with levy. I want he writes. I want to be wrong

[11:53] I still have the game on order and I wanted to be awesome. I've done this before I know the drill

[12:00] I bought games where I love the theme but ended up selling due to annoying design and code flaws and meanwhile

[12:07] All he's bitching about is annoying design and code flaws in Ghostbusters for for months

[12:15] He's been bitching about it for months and he's still buying it

[12:19] So what do we have here? We have grown adults who recognize their own ridiculous behavior and go on and admit

[12:27] They have no control over it. They have no control over their behavior

[12:31] So even if you know what you don't like about a game and this game has what you don't like

[12:37] But you're still gonna buy it if I'm Gary Stern

[12:40] I'm basically telling my my CMO

[12:43] Hey, this is who we're selling to these are grown men and they're fucking

[12:49] Obsessed with our product to the point when they know we can make something they don't even like and they're gonna buy it

[12:57] Holy shit

[12:59] It's like Gary's discovered fucking Shangri-La fountain of youth fucking holy grail product

[13:05] He can make something that you don't like and you'll still buy it think about that if you're Gary and you read that

[13:14] What these guys write you're like well we can fucking do anything as long as we put the thing in a box and have a theme that people like

[13:21] They're gonna gobble it up. He then goes on to write

[13:24] Transformers X-Men Star Trek. I'm taking the risk because I still feel like the potential for a good game is there

[13:32] And I love the theme more than any of those others

[13:35] I'd love to eventually take all my negative fatigue about this game and for it to be a keeper

[13:42] Then why don't you just shut the fuck up Greg?

[13:46] Just wait

[13:47] By the game see if the code becomes what you want it to be and then make up your mind but instead

[13:55] This guy is on Pinsite every day for like a hundred posts a day

[14:01] Wining about it. You didn't have it. He doesn't even have it. He's complaining about a toy that he doesn't have yet

[14:08] And many that he has what he doesn't like that he's still gonna get it

[14:13] This stuff guys. I mean, I don't understand

[14:17] Why people allow this behavior to percolate through the Pinside world and if you see Greg at an expel or a show man

[14:25] Like they just grow up. This is the epitome. I didn't call this episode Pinside babies

[14:31] Because I don't want to over saturate with that beautiful title

[14:34] But is this not indicative of the ultimate like just baby behavior that we constantly hear from these people and I love it

[14:42] Like I'm taking the risk

[14:45] Like people should take real risks in life right people should take a risk and they should maybe ask that girl out that

[14:53] They think is gonna say no people should take a risk and maybe

[14:56] Start that business that they're afraid to but if they do it it could change their life

[15:01] People should take a risk like travel to a country there. They've always wanted to go to

[15:07] Taking a risk on buying ghosts busters premium pinball machine

[15:12] You consider that a fucking risk in life. Are you fucking serious man?

[15:18] That's not a risk the rest of the world that's taking actual risks are looking at this stuff being like these guys are the biggest

[15:28] Fucking losers come on. It's not a risk. You've got a lot of money man

[15:34] You must be you're buying eight thousand dollar toys. This isn't a risk. All right. This is just

[15:40] Pin money, right? You know look up the term pin money. It's just excess cash you have okay? That's what this is

[15:48] And then he goes on later to say in the thread

[15:51] It's a shame with some testing and refining and not locking themselves into a linear and frustrating mode concept

[15:58] Go spusters could and he writes could all capitalize could have been the next atoms

[16:04] I'll settle for it just being fun at this point

[16:07] Update update please come soon. I really think like Greg like sits in his bed at night and like

[16:14] Clinches his hands together and it's like please God please

[16:19] Could you please update the ghost busters code so that it's no longer linear and that it's better because I really think this

[16:26] Pin's got potential. I mean, I think this guy talks more or thinks more about this pin than he would like his own

[16:32] Child who you know, it's like this is how people look at children. Oh, I want my kid to grow up to be a doctor

[16:38] Lawyer my child has such potential. I want to make sure they get all the right advantages in life

[16:44] So they can fulfill that potential

[16:46] He we're talking about a fucking toy a game made of wood

[16:52] Wires and lights that's just supposed to give you a few minutes of entertainment and this guy is like playing that it can

[16:59] Reach its ultimate potential to be just as good as the atoms family

[17:04] I want you guys all out there to do me a favor

[17:07] Stop someone you know today that doesn't know anything about pin bombie like hey, man

[17:11] How much are you wishing that ghost busters can live up to its potential and be as good as the atoms family?

[17:16] And I want you to watch the person's reaction as they look at you and are like what the fuck are you even talking about?

[17:25] Get a fucking life man. You're 40 50 years old. Why are you concerned about this for fucks sakes?

[17:33] Let it go Greg just get your ghost busters put it in your lineup and fucking enjoy it

[17:41] You're looking at this thing like the glasses have empty you could look at any pinball machine and be like

[17:47] Oh if it only had this if Game of Thrones only had like artwork that was good

[17:54] If if the walking dead actually like had like this in it or have the actors voices and if this game had this

[18:01] If stay puff marshmallow man actually you like inflated it would be so much

[18:06] But shut up all of you fucking guys who whine about the littlest details the bottom line is this

[18:13] Ghost busters might be fun for you. You might hate ghost busters. You might love the hobbit

[18:19] You might hate the hobbit, but for fucks sakes. That's great

[18:23] But don't say it a million times over and over and over again at the end of the day at the end of the day

[18:30] Can everyone on Pinside do me a favor?

[18:33] Give me one fucking review of the game, right?

[18:36] Imagine seeing a movie and you just won't shut the fuck up about your review of that movie

[18:42] We get it. This is how you feel about it

[18:45] Thank you for telling me for the fucking 18,000 time Greg that you don't like the code all your bitching is not gonna make Dwight change it and

[18:54] For those of you who actually own the game

[18:57] Who play it on a daily basis and say you know what?

[19:00] It's not that bad the code the way it works the ladder system it works fine. I

[19:05] Trust those people more. All right. I trust those people more

[19:09] I trust the hobbit owners more who get to play it every day who actually are playing it

[19:14] Because how many mother fuckers out there in other world?

[19:17] Like I love always hear mother fuckers who shit on the hellcat

[19:20] Have you ever driven a hellcat?

[19:22] People who are like oh it handles like shit. Oh, it's just an American beef head car. I

[19:27] Drive one every weekend. It's fucking magical

[19:31] So I tend to believe the people who own it

[19:33] Versus the people who rent it and then get cranky about not being able to own it and like honestly

[19:39] There's a lot of fucking haters in this community. All right so many fucking haters more so than I'm

[19:44] Clob more so than in any other like toy collecting community because when you go to buy Legos or the new transformer or Star Wars toys

[19:51] They're not $8,000. So I think a lot of fucking people are jealous and they just shit on stuff

[19:57] But are isn't it getting old of just like shooting on someone else's purchase?

[20:01] Let them make up their mind look and I get it if you play it and you don't like it say it but don't say it 15 fucking times

[20:09] And I used to do that. You so you know, I don't like the hobbit

[20:13] But if I own the hobbit I would be able to make a much better

[20:18] Subjective a little bit more of an objective opinion on the game all right and

[20:24] Let's just say this. I want to close out by saying this the thing that I think fucks with everybody

[20:29] The thing that like really should just go away is the pinball top 100

[20:35] Because this is just a list of

[20:38] opinions not facts and

[20:41] You can't settle a score by like which is better right the reason I like cars as as much as you can

[20:48] Subjectively bitch about cars the things we subjectively talk about are the design right the looks

[20:54] But when it comes to cars

[20:56] It's performance and performance is something you can test

[21:00] So as much as like people talk all this shit in the world

[21:04] They take it to the track and they figure out well who's actually which one's better?

[21:08] Which one's faster?

[21:10] You can't do that in pinball and it's stupid to do that in in with a game

[21:15] It's a fucking game guys. It's a toy

[21:17] Now people people like argue like moral combat versus Street Fighter like let's just keep arguing back and forth

[21:23] No one really did that people played them and they enjoyed them

[21:26] But the top 100 it starts to give people this sense of like

[21:31] You know like it's like people are fanboys for these titles

[21:34] I I will go on record for saying right now. I enjoy Ghostbusters L.E

[21:39] More than I enjoy medieval madness more than a nine more than I enjoy Twilight Zone more than I enjoy Monster Bash

[21:46] More than I enjoy Attack from Mars and more than I enjoy Lord the Rings and I just listed the top five titles

[21:52] On the top 100 so what does that mean if someone's asking could Ghostbusters be the best game of all time?

[21:58] I don't know if I have more fun than it now right now. It's on my this number one

[22:04] I get what people say over time. Will you still like it as much as those titles?

[22:08] I don't know I've just never even liked medieval madness. I play the game so much. I just don't like it that much

[22:15] I find it boring

[22:18] Indiana Jones the pinball adventure Adams family

[22:22] Indiana Jones is probably the clunkiest machine. I've ever played in my life

[22:25] I love the theme but a wide body. We're like all the shots are like right near the flippers and it's impossible to start modes

[22:33] Ah, come on

[22:36] You know so look

[22:39] Pinball is not like wine. It doesn't get better with age

[22:43] We're at a new era now that no one's used to games stop the being made really like the good games all these games

[22:50] Like the like 97 93 98 right 92 93. I'm like listening up. Okay, so what?

[22:59] 20 years ago there was this like boom when all these great titles came out

[23:03] We're at another boom period the games that come out in this boom are gonna skyrocket over these games in terms of what people

[23:12] Really want to play and people are gonna consider them better and people who love these old games and have them in their collection

[23:18] A lot of people are gonna be but hurt that all of a sudden aliens more fun and Batman's more fun and Star Wars is more fun

[23:24] And hobbit is more fun like I don't see any of those like new games really up on these they're gonna be on these lists

[23:30] They should be they're gonna be what people want. They're gonna be what people desire

[23:35] so look

[23:37] for for the 15th time people just

[23:41] Realize you're playing pinball you're talking about pinball if you zoom out and look at the way you guys talk about

[23:49] Ghostbusters it's fucking pathetic if you can't enjoy ghostbusters

[23:53] I really think there's something wrong with you. I really do if you can't have fun on that machine

[23:59] There's something wrong with you. It is the epitome of fun and that's all I'm gonna say

[24:04] It's not a fucking wine

[24:06] It's not something that's supposed to get better with age. It's something that's supposed to bring you enjoyment the moment you plan

[24:11] And I think it does that for most people and I think once people start getting their premiums and it's out there

[24:17] You're gonna see more and more people love it and yes, they're gonna polish the code a little bit

[24:22] But no Greg rare hero. They're not gonna change the way the modes are selected just for you

[24:28] You're not that special

[24:31] Take the pacifier out of your mouth. We've heard what you've said a million times we get it

[24:36] I think you make a lot of sense

[24:38] But just the repetition of it makes you sound like the biggest baby, right?

[24:43] Levy we know what you're doing you do it successfully

[24:47] You're the troll that canado always wanted to be you I mean

[24:51] Levy used to tell me man

[24:52] You gotta learn how to troll right you're gonna get kicked off and he was right. I got kicked off

[24:57] Ice man, I think you're like the voice or reason in all this nonsense

[25:01] You have the game you love it you enjoy it and you're just watching these guys complain about something that brings you enjoyment

[25:07] It's funny and you don't take it too personally. I like that about ice man

[25:11] He's like a cool guy lately, you know after the magic of the buckle anyway. That's it little rant little rave

[25:18] People it's pinball stop acting like fucking babies. All right. Have a good day
