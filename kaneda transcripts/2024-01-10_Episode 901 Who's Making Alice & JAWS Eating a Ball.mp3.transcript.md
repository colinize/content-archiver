[00:00] It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me, and tea, time, everybody agrees.

[00:09] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:14] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:16] I'm super excited about today's show.

[00:18] For all you new members, welcome to Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[00:22] I think for all you old members out there, you're realizing how you're getting your money's worth.

[00:26] We're doing rapid fire shows.

[00:28] We're back to the old Canada scooping the industry.

[00:32] Alice in Wonderland is coming out sometime in May.

[00:35] And we're gonna talk about that.

[00:37] We're gonna talk about Haggis Pinball and how they did not build all the fathoms.

[00:42] We're gonna talk about Spooky Pinball.

[00:44] Where's the Looney Tunes code?

[00:46] Do you believe that they're waiting for a licensor approval?

[00:49] That is the greatest excuse in the history of Pinball.

[00:52] Jaws Pinball is at CES.

[00:54] We'll talk about that.

[00:56] There's a mob that's supposed to make the shark eat the ball.

[00:59] We're gonna talk about how that's impossible.

[01:01] We're gonna talk about why I think Jaws' feedback is so harsh

[01:04] and the fact that there's still LEDs available.

[01:07] And I got a correspondence from George Gomez yesterday.

[01:11] We chatted about his comments being deleted on Facebook.

[01:15] I'm gonna clarify what George said to me

[01:18] and what his statements are on this topic.

[01:21] And then we're gonna talk about if hindsight were 2020.

[01:25] How everybody made a mistake revealing their games before Jaws.

[01:30] Pinball, let's get right to it.

[01:31] So you heard yesterday, I confirmed for the world

[01:35] that Alice in Wonderland is coming back.

[01:38] Yes, it is going to come back.

[01:40] It is going to have the Zambietti artwork.

[01:43] Zambietti himself chimed in in the thread

[01:46] and said he was approached to do this project.

[01:49] What greater confirmation that it's happening than that.

[01:52] And I know there's a lot of downvotes.

[01:54] There's a lot of anger.

[01:55] J-POP's not working on this game.

[01:57] They took the J-POP design.

[01:59] I've seen this game.

[02:00] It is based off of the John Papadook foam core machine.

[02:05] It is not based off of John Papadook's

[02:08] like Bally Williams prototype Alice game that he made

[02:11] that got him the job at Bally Williams.

[02:14] So it is based off of that game.

[02:16] It is put into a standard Bally Williams cabinet

[02:19] and it has the upper magnetic flip play field.

[02:22] It's going to be freaking super cool, super beautiful.

[02:25] And I can't wait to see this game.

[02:27] And now the next big question mark is,

[02:30] who's making the game?

[02:32] Is it going to be American pinball?

[02:33] Is it going to be Dutch pinball?

[02:35] Is it going to be CGC?

[02:36] Is it going to be Padredy gaming?

[02:38] Everybody's wondering.

[02:39] And look, you know, pinball news, pinball magazine

[02:42] might have spoiled the reveal on this one.

[02:45] And I think a lot of people have been guessing,

[02:47] you most likely been guessing, right?

[02:49] A pinball manufacturer that you know all too well

[02:52] built a second building and there's a really good chance.

[02:55] I don't know, maybe it's not going to be them,

[02:57] but I think there's a really good chance

[02:59] it's going to be our friends over at Dutch pinball.

[03:02] Now look, I think Dutch pinball screws together

[03:05] a better game than Padredy gaming.

[03:07] I mean, the Italians don't screw things together

[03:09] as well as the Dutch.

[03:11] I think what got people all confused about this too

[03:13] is the people who were behind the magic girl remake,

[03:16] those group of people that fixed magic girl with the kit.

[03:19] The guy went on pin side and said,

[03:21] I'm not doing this.

[03:22] I'm not making Alice in Wonderland and I'm Dutch.

[03:25] What he meant by that was that he's actually Dutch

[03:28] by ethnicity, not that he's Dutch pinball.

[03:32] And look, I'm glad this news is out there

[03:34] because I think 2024 is going to be the year

[03:37] of Dutch pinball, I really mean it.

[03:39] And I think they're going to be done with the big Lebowski's.

[03:42] Everybody's going to be made whole.

[03:44] And now, right now it's going to be smooth sailing

[03:47] for Dutch pinball because they're going to have two games out

[03:50] in 2024 in which they don't owe anybody anything.

[03:54] They are going to make these games

[03:56] and then take your money and then take a deposit on games.

[03:59] You're not going to be paying in full for these games

[04:01] and not get them in 10 years.

[04:03] And I want to encourage everybody,

[04:05] I know what Dutch pinball went through.

[04:07] I know every misleading thing they said

[04:11] and they said some stupid stuff 10 years ago

[04:14] and they delayed and they delayed and they delayed

[04:17] and they made excuses.

[04:18] And there was a time when they were lying to people

[04:20] about what was going on.

[04:22] What was going on with contract manufacturing?

[04:24] What was it, ARA?

[04:25] Remember those years?

[04:27] Some of these new guys don't understand these years

[04:29] and what we all went through and it was a debacle.

[04:32] Like it was a huge debacle, but that was 10 years ago

[04:35] or eight years ago.

[04:37] And they went through a long period

[04:39] where they could have called it quits.

[04:41] We lost Yop in the process to a terrible disease.

[04:44] And Barry, instead of hanging it up,

[04:47] instead of saying it's over, fine, forget it, I'm leaving,

[04:50] he found a way forward.

[04:52] And I want to encourage each and every one of you

[04:54] who's still holding on to the anger from 10 years ago.

[04:58] At what point as human beings have we given up our ability

[05:02] to forgive somebody and accept the fact

[05:05] that he found a solution?

[05:07] He was in a terrible dilemma, a terrible situation.

[05:10] And instead of quitting, he found a way forward.

[05:13] And that doesn't erase what he did 10 years ago,

[05:16] but it should at least make each and every one of us

[05:19] give the damn guy and the company a second chance.

[05:22] I've done that, a lot of people have done that,

[05:25] and every EA is gonna unbox their big Lebowski

[05:29] before you see these other games.

[05:31] And that's really good news.

[05:33] And so I'm super excited

[05:35] and looking at the landscape of Pimbal right now,

[05:37] I think Dutch Pimbal is a company

[05:40] that has a lot of people's attention.

[05:42] As we see these other companies strip down their games

[05:45] and take everything out and not build their games

[05:48] with incredible quality,

[05:49] we're happy to see that this pristine factory

[05:52] over there in the Netherlands

[05:54] is gonna make not just maybe an Alice in Wonderland game,

[05:58] but also back to the freaking future with Joe Kay.

[06:02] And I'm hearing Bob Gale is on board for this project,

[06:05] so it's not gonna be this stripped down,

[06:06] got nothing in it game

[06:08] that some people want you to believe it's gonna be.

[06:10] It's gonna be the game you should be holding

[06:12] onto your money for.

[06:13] And that's just the damn truth, people.

[06:15] So congratulations, this Alice game is gonna be gorgeous.

[06:19] And this back to the future game

[06:20] is gonna have three times the demand

[06:22] as games they can build.

[06:23] Scratch that 10 times the demand.

[06:25] And I'm super happy that Berry's ship is gonna come in.

[06:29] It's gonna come in for Chris and Melissa at Cointake

[06:31] or who stood up for Berry all those years.

[06:33] All right, so that's that.

[06:35] Put a pin in that, people,

[06:36] because we got five months to wait on that game.

[06:38] So we don't have to talk about it every day

[06:40] and read the misinformation on Pinsight.

[06:43] Haggis Pinball said they would finish

[06:44] all of the Fathom Mermaid editions,

[06:46] not just the Mermaid, all of the Fathom editions

[06:49] by the end of the year.

[06:50] Guess what?

[06:51] Guess what they didn't do?

[06:52] They didn't finish all of the Fathoms

[06:54] by the end of the year.

[06:55] So here we go, once again, in ETA,

[06:59] a statement by Haggis Pinball that does not come true.

[07:02] This is just one of many updates from Haggis Pinball

[07:05] that has not come true.

[07:06] I'm just gonna say this right now.

[07:08] As I look on Pinsight and see these Mermaid Fathom editions

[07:12] that are selling for less than

[07:13] they were brand new, new in box.

[07:15] You know why that is?

[07:16] Because they screwed over everybody

[07:18] who bought the Mermaid edition.

[07:20] People might have forgot this.

[07:21] Remember when sales were struggling

[07:24] and they didn't have many orders on the standard edition

[07:27] and Damien was probably looking at the balance sheet

[07:31] and realizing we can't afford to go on

[07:33] unless we sell some more of these games.

[07:35] We need some more money.

[07:36] So what did he do?

[07:38] He went against his word.

[07:40] I would say he baited and switched

[07:41] all of his early customers.

[07:43] He then offered the exclusive Mermaid edition software

[07:48] to everybody else.

[07:49] And the moment he did that,

[07:51] he screwed over everybody because he needed the money.

[07:54] Everybody, I'm not gonna hold back here.

[07:57] This company, the writing is on the wall.

[07:59] There is no way this company is doing just fine financially.

[08:03] I think the writing is on the wall.

[08:05] I think they must be running on fumes.

[08:07] And I kind of do feel bad for these guys

[08:09] because they started their company

[08:11] at the worst possible time.

[08:13] At the very beginning of a pandemic,

[08:15] located in a part of the world where it's super expensive

[08:18] to get parts and to ship stuff in and out of,

[08:20] high taxes, their dollars were nothing next to the US dollar.

[08:24] But I didn't make them start this company, they did.

[08:27] I didn't make them tell people

[08:28] they'd have their games in eight weeks

[08:30] and it took eight months if they even got it in eight months.

[08:33] It's been a series of inconsistencies

[08:36] and white lies by Haggis Pimbal.

[08:38] And for all those people who got your game

[08:40] and wanna defend them, that's fine.

[08:41] You can defend them all you want.

[08:43] But the writing is on the wall.

[08:45] With 15 Pimbal companies trying to sell games in 2024,

[08:49] how is this company gonna survive

[08:51] if all they've got is a Centaur remake?

[08:55] That's not where the demand is in Pimbal.

[08:57] How many people do you know are looking for remakes

[09:00] of solid state games that cost like 12 to $18,000, right?

[09:05] That Orblivian addition, once again, a tone deaf move

[09:09] to sell an $18,000 game in the current climate.

[09:13] Everybody who's stuck in COVID,

[09:15] everybody whose marketing plans were established

[09:18] during the COVID frenzy, you're gonna fail.

[09:21] It's all gonna fail.

[09:22] You all need to wake up.

[09:24] Part of being a marketer, part of being a businessman,

[09:27] you gotta adapt to the times.

[09:29] And the times, they haven't changed, people.

[09:31] You can't even sell out of a Jaws LE

[09:34] and you're gonna sell a $17,000, $18,000

[09:37] or a Blivian addition with a stupid motorcycle helmet

[09:41] and a leather jacket.

[09:42] Didn't you learn anything from galactic tank forces,

[09:44] thermos and a lunchbox?

[09:46] We don't want this stupid stuff.

[09:48] We don't wanna spend stupid prices.

[09:50] And we don't wanna be told,

[09:51] eight weeks we're gonna get our games

[09:53] and then eight months later,

[09:55] there's still no game inside the home.

[09:57] They didn't live up to their end of the year promise.

[09:59] And I don't know at what point are we supposed to say,

[10:01] you know what, I don't have any trust left in this company.

[10:05] I get that they can slowly crank games out,

[10:08] but the writing is on the wall.

[10:09] I don't see how they survived the year.

[10:11] Look guys, times are tough.

[10:12] Let's go over to Spooky Pinball.

[10:14] Times are tough.

[10:15] Spooky Pinball had to let some people go

[10:17] right before the holidays

[10:19] because they have like a two to three month window

[10:21] where games are not going out the door.

[10:23] They're manufacturing stuff,

[10:25] but games are not really flying out the door.

[10:27] Some of them are, but Scooby-Doo sales are winding down

[10:31] and they're ramping up production of the new games.

[10:33] But there was like, I heard there was like a two to three

[10:36] month window in which they might not have had stuff

[10:39] for everybody there to do.

[10:41] And so they let some people go and business is tough

[10:44] and pinball is gonna get very competitive.

[10:46] And Stern is just a larger version

[10:48] of how tough it's gonna get.

[10:50] And so the word on the street is that they obviously

[10:52] revealed these games a little bit sooner than they wanted to.

[10:55] They absolutely revealed these games in front of Jaws Pinball.

[11:00] Everybody's been afraid of Jaws Pinball.

[11:02] Spooky Pinball got in front of it.

[11:04] Jersey Jack got in front of it.

[11:06] And I'm gonna talk about this later,

[11:07] but hindsight being 2020, I'll just talk about it now.

[11:10] I think everybody's sort of, if they could go back in time,

[11:14] they would have just let Jaws come out

[11:16] because the Jaws response,

[11:18] even though we all thought it was gonna be

[11:19] the Keith Elwin masterpiece

[11:21] and nobody was gonna buy another game after seeing Jaws,

[11:24] that's not the case.

[11:25] And it actually would have been better to let Jaws come out,

[11:29] let everybody see what Stern's doing

[11:31] with their homerun hitter,

[11:32] and then come out and show people Elton John.

[11:35] Can you imagine if Elton John launched after Jaws?

[11:38] I do think the response would have been much better

[11:41] because relative to Jaws,

[11:43] because if I was Jersey Jack,

[11:44] I would have taken a Jaws-like premium.

[11:47] I would have bought one.

[11:48] And this is what I would do.

[11:49] You remember when car companies used to advertise

[11:51] with other cars in the commercials

[11:53] or the Pepsi Coke challenge?

[11:55] If I was Jersey Jack,

[11:56] the best way to show people the value of Elton John platinum

[12:00] is to go grab a Jaws and put it next to your machine

[12:04] and just say no words.

[12:06] I mean, that's the one time you would use

[12:08] Damien and Marty's like hashtag no words

[12:11] because when you see Elton John next to Jaws

[12:13] and you see what's in it

[12:15] and the overall package of Elton John,

[12:17] it absolutely blows away Jaws pinball,

[12:20] but they didn't do that.

[12:21] They sort of like limped it out in this like soggy fashion.

[12:25] There was no feature at video.

[12:26] There was no excitement.

[12:28] We all knew it was Elton John for like a year and a half

[12:30] and they wouldn't just tell people it's Elton John.

[12:33] That's the other reason why I think it's beneficial

[12:35] to just tell people right now,

[12:37] it's gonna be Alice in Wonderland

[12:39] and it's gonna be made by Dutch pinball

[12:42] because by the time the game is made,

[12:44] everybody who's crying about J-pop and Alice

[12:48] and Dutch making it, everyone who's complaining about it

[12:50] can get it out of their system

[12:53] by the time the game goes on sale.

[12:55] When you have something that you know is gonna trigger people

[12:58] in maybe a negative way like an Elton John theme,

[13:02] then just rip the band-aid off early,

[13:05] let those complainers run out of energy and steam

[13:08] and then get people excited.

[13:10] They didn't do that.

[13:11] They did the same playbook

[13:12] as if every game they launched is Guns N' Roses

[13:14] and Jersey Jack has once again realized

[13:17] they only have one approach to marketing

[13:19] and it's not working on their last three titles.

[13:22] So, Spooky Pinball definitely went out early.

[13:24] So, when they say to us,

[13:25] we're waiting on license or approval,

[13:27] if that's the case, I would like to ask them to do one thing.

[13:31] If they're waiting on license or approval,

[13:33] can you share us an email that says that?

[13:36] Any correspondence between you and the license holder

[13:39] that says, you can't show this game

[13:41] until we give you approval?

[13:43] I don't understand this.

[13:44] Why would they be waiting on license or approval

[13:46] of cartoons that are aired everywhere all over the world?

[13:49] I can go watch every single episode on YouTube.

[13:52] Do you really think Warner Brothers is like,

[13:54] wait a minute, we're really concerned

[13:56] about how you're gonna show these cartoons

[13:58] in a pinball machine for 888 people

[14:02] when millions of people can go on YouTube

[14:04] and watch every single clip

[14:06] of every single show we've ever done.

[14:08] I don't buy it.

[14:09] I think the waiting on license or approval

[14:11] is simply because the code is not far enough along

[14:14] and I don't think they want people to see it

[14:16] until the code is further along

[14:18] and I wish they would just say that.

[14:20] It's like for some reason,

[14:22] no one can ever be honest about that.

[14:25] Like even when Stern did James Bond,

[14:27] they should have just been like,

[14:28] this code sucks right now.

[14:30] We're gonna be honest.

[14:31] Just be totally brutally honest.

[14:33] Working with a license holder is really difficult.

[14:35] What you're gonna see right now is like 20%

[14:39] of where the game's gonna be.

[14:40] Now it does beg the question.

[14:42] If you're not far enough along to show the game,

[14:45] then don't show the game.

[14:47] You don't have to show Looney Tunes

[14:49] and Texas Chainsaw Massacre at the same time.

[14:52] Again, it's because Jaws forced them to show it then,

[14:55] but it clearly wasn't ready to be shown.

[14:58] I don't think anything should be shown to the public.

[15:00] You should never take money on a pinball machine

[15:03] if you don't have approval to show the damn code.

[15:06] Can we just make that like a rule within this hobby?

[15:09] Don't show me your product

[15:11] unless you're legally allowed to show me your product.

[15:13] It's so stupid and don't take my money

[15:15] and then don't take my money in a nonrefundable fashion.

[15:19] Everyone who gave a deposit on Looney Tunes,

[15:21] if you don't like what you see,

[15:23] you now can't get your money back.

[15:25] Do you understand the idiocracy

[15:27] and that sort of arrangement

[15:29] between company and consumer?

[15:30] Absolutely, Asani.

[15:32] And all right, Jaws pinball is at CES

[15:34] and I think Jaws is trolling all of us.

[15:37] They marched in a bunch of games

[15:39] and there's a really big shark with a pinball in its mouth

[15:43] and that's the one thing everybody wants the shark

[15:45] to do in the game and then they troll us.

[15:48] There's more going on in the booth at CES

[15:51] than is going on in the actual machine itself.

[15:54] They've got a wax figure of quint reeling in the shark.

[15:57] They've got the authentic barrel from the movie.

[16:00] My friend is the one who actually set up all those props.

[16:03] Mr. Chris Kiska, he's a great guy.

[16:05] He's over there with stern pinball.

[16:07] He's a longtime friend of mine.

[16:09] And look, the game is there.

[16:11] I'm not hearing the feedback I thought I'd hear.

[16:14] I'm not seeing any gameplay being discussed by people at CES.

[16:18] I heard the sound there is really loud

[16:21] and you can't really hear the game.

[16:23] Once again, ladies and gentlemen,

[16:24] it makes no sense for stern pinball

[16:27] to bring any of these games to CES.

[16:30] I mean, they are right next to a 3D holographic TV.

[16:34] That is state of the art technology.

[16:36] And they're like, and over here,

[16:37] we have stern pinball introducing QR codes in 2024

[16:42] with hexagon achievements.

[16:44] I'm sure it's fun to have pinball machines to play at CES,

[16:47] but it's also probably a horrible experience

[16:50] for anyone who's trying to get a first impression of Jaws.

[16:53] Now, look, the game is on the line

[16:55] and the game is gonna be at operators.

[16:57] The game is gonna be on location all over the place real soon.

[17:00] I can't wait to play one.

[17:01] And now we get the most ridiculous item of the day.

[17:05] You know the guy who made the Jerry ramp in Rick and Morty?

[17:08] That opens up that Jerry shot

[17:10] that gives you a straight shot into the garage,

[17:13] which is basically a cheat mod in the game

[17:15] because it's really hard to get into the garage

[17:18] with that upper right flipper shot.

[17:19] And so this gentleman is on pin side saying,

[17:23] he is going to engineer a shark mod

[17:26] that eats the ball, feeds it into a subway,

[17:30] and then releases the ball somewhere else

[17:32] onto the playfield in the premium

[17:35] and Ellie models of the game.

[17:38] He's also gonna make a shark

[17:39] that eats the ball for the pro machine.

[17:41] And the one thing that this guy doesn't get,

[17:43] this isn't like just removing a target,

[17:46] opening up a pathway in Rick and Morty.

[17:48] He's talking about eating the ball, going into a subway,

[17:53] and then returning it to the playfield through what?

[17:57] There is no hole that is connected to a subway

[18:00] in Jaws pinball.

[18:02] He also has no idea what underneath the game looks like.

[18:06] He also has no idea if you do that,

[18:09] that is gonna mess up the entire software of the game.

[18:13] Because Rick and Morty,

[18:14] you were just getting to that switch faster,

[18:16] but hitting that switch wouldn't change

[18:18] the way the game is coded.

[18:19] If you turn what is a millisecond bashing of the shark,

[18:22] which hits a switch,

[18:24] and then that activates something in the software,

[18:26] if you take that fraction of a second switch moment in Jaws,

[18:31] which is just bashing the shark,

[18:32] and then that becomes the shark opening its mouth,

[18:35] eating the ball, going into a subway,

[18:37] having to travel to another place in the playfield,

[18:40] and then having to be ejected back into play.

[18:44] So you're taking what's a fraction of a second,

[18:46] and then adding in like a two second delay,

[18:49] it would absolutely mess up everything

[18:51] in the software of that game.

[18:52] Not to mention, how are you ever gonna make this mech happen

[18:55] without drilling a hole, or drilling screws

[18:59] into the playfield?

[19:00] And I love that everyone's like, put me on the list,

[19:02] sign me up, pinball people.

[19:04] Stern pinball should have engineered this.

[19:07] And I'm just gonna say this,

[19:08] the more we keep allowing the mod community

[19:11] to make the games the manufacturers

[19:14] should have made at the factory,

[19:16] the more we're screwing ourselves,

[19:18] the more we're screwing ourselves,

[19:20] then they're just gonna keep relying on the mod community

[19:23] to do everything they should be doing,

[19:25] and they're charging us $13,000.

[19:28] For $13,000, this thing should have everything.

[19:31] I shouldn't have to go mod it out afterwards.

[19:34] When I buy a Dodge Demon,

[19:35] I don't have to add anything to the car.

[19:37] It's so sad to me that we're like doing the work

[19:40] for the manufacturers, and we're paying them

[19:43] for this work they should have done at the factory.

[19:45] You know, and then I was just thinking about it,

[19:47] I was reading all the feedback,

[19:48] I've been watching people's commentary on Jaws,

[19:50] and it's not great.

[19:51] Like Jaws' feedback is really brutal.

[19:54] I thought there was gonna be more universal love

[19:57] for this game, and there's just not,

[19:58] and I think I know why.

[20:00] I think it's one reason why.

[20:01] I think people are so burnt out

[20:04] after two years of these high prices.

[20:07] I think people are so burnt out

[20:09] of losing so much money on all these stern machines,

[20:12] and then Jaws comes out at $13,000,

[20:16] and on top of that, I think stern really,

[20:19] at the worst time, showed their true colors of greed

[20:24] with those anniversary editions of Jurassic Park,

[20:27] another version of Elvira.

[20:29] They really put a sour taste in the mouth

[20:32] of the collector, of the person that loves to buy the LEs.

[20:36] And you almost need the LE fanfare

[20:38] to lift everything else up.

[20:40] And so when Jaws' LE got revealed,

[20:43] you have all these people that are burnt out,

[20:45] they're angry, and they're seeing what the game is for $13,000,

[20:50] and they just don't see it,

[20:51] and I think that turned a lot of people off.

[20:54] You know, when they say the numbers don't lie,

[20:56] have you ever seen a Keith L. Wynne LE

[20:58] after being out for over a week?

[21:01] It's still for sale.

[21:03] Like you can go on the pin side marketplace

[21:05] and people have them for $13,000.

[21:08] And I think you're gonna see more of these games

[21:10] open up for sale.

[21:11] I think it's a whole new world of pinball,

[21:13] and I think for this much money,

[21:15] the game has to check every box,

[21:16] and I don't think the game does it.

[21:18] All right, so I talked to George Gomez yesterday,

[21:20] and you know, I ragged on him a little bit

[21:22] for his deleted comments.

[21:24] We had a good conversation back and forth,

[21:25] and he was just like, look, I deleted the comments,

[21:27] he said something like it was impossible

[21:29] to tell what he was answering,

[21:31] because it was like a really chaotic chat going on.

[21:34] And so I wanna read for you what he said,

[21:36] and he's confirming this.

[21:38] Future anniversary editions will be premiums

[21:41] with new art built as premiums.

[21:43] Black armor, no fancy LE content.

[21:47] LEs will mostly be uniquely cornerstones.

[21:50] I think this is new.

[21:51] A special DMD may get an LE model,

[21:54] but that's TBD and very dependent on the model.

[21:58] DMD remakes will be few and far between

[22:01] because they are very hard to do,

[22:03] the tech update and licensing.

[22:05] And he was like, you know,

[22:06] I'm not sure why there's so much drama.

[22:08] And I said, George, to be fair,

[22:10] a lot of people that bought LEs last year

[22:12] saw anniversaries or new LEs dropped

[22:15] that significantly hurt the game's value.

[22:17] I also told them, you know, this is why it's a hot topic,

[22:20] because no anniversary edition to date

[22:22] has been unnumbered $9,500 or without powder coat.

[22:27] And I just want to clarify for him

[22:29] that we're not just making up this drama out of thin air.

[22:32] He said he's been trying to respect

[22:33] what he's been hearing.

[22:34] He said that distros have been telling them

[22:36] that people want to know

[22:37] they are buying the loaded best of everything edition.

[22:40] He said, we've been buried in requests for certain vaults.

[22:43] Lord of the Rings, Tron and Ghostbusters,

[22:46] some are very hard.

[22:48] A white star game ported to new tech

[22:50] is like making a new game from scratch.

[22:53] Not to mention the challenges of approvals all over again

[22:56] with all new people,

[22:58] because no one works at a licensor for that long.

[23:01] So we're trying to be responsive and responsible.

[23:04] Totally, right?

[23:05] I mean, if you made Lord of the Rings in 2004,

[23:09] nobody who worked on that game

[23:11] from a licensing standpoint

[23:12] is still over at New Line Cinema, right?

[23:15] What a nightmare it must be.

[23:16] Like 20 years later, we have to write all new contracts.

[23:21] We have to create all new technology to make the game work.

[23:24] It is probably more expensive

[23:26] than making a game from scratch.

[23:28] But if they made Lord of the Rings vault

[23:31] with modern artwork and modern tech,

[23:34] that's something I'd pay a lot of money for.

[23:36] So there you have it.

[23:37] And speaking of DMDs coming back,

[23:39] Harry Hardy is saying that Kiss DMD

[23:42] is gonna be the first DMD they remake.

[23:45] Is there really that much demand for more Kiss machines?

[23:48] I think there's more demand for Kiss toppers.

[23:51] And you know that Stern is gonna remake the Kiss topper.

[23:54] If they remade the Black Night topper,

[23:56] if you're one of those people who bought a Kiss topper

[23:59] for like $3,000,

[24:01] I think you're about to see a new one,

[24:02] probably for like $8.99.

[24:04] Oh, look at you guys getting like back to back to back

[24:08] episodes of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[24:10] Everybody, thank you so much for the support.

[24:12] If you've been loving the show recently

[24:14] and you've been a member for a long time

[24:17] and you feel like you're getting more

[24:19] than your $5 worth,

[24:21] I would love it to call out more names

[24:23] of people who are raising the roof.

[24:25] And what I mean by raising the roof,

[24:27] you just raise your subscription a little bit,

[24:30] maybe from five to 10, 10 to 15, that's it.

[24:33] It's just a little bit more a month.

[24:35] I know, I know, I'm not gonna make anybody, don't worry.

[24:38] I'm never gonna raise the minimum,

[24:40] but if you feel like you're getting your value,

[24:43] I would love to shout out more people raising the roof.

[24:46] Everybody have a great Wednesday.

[24:48] We'll be back with more.

[24:49] Oh, and by the way,

[24:50] next week I'm going to Disney with the family.

[24:54] I'm going to Disney with Brenda and Killian.

[24:56] I am so excited.

[24:58] So there will be no podcasts next week.

[25:00] Please don't cancel your subscription.

[25:02] Please let me have a week off to recharge

[25:05] with my little man.

[25:06] I don't wanna bring my podcast gear on this vacation.

[25:10] I might do a Facebook live here and there,

[25:12] so check that out.

[25:14] But there will be no shows next week.

[25:16] And I think it's the perfect time to go

[25:17] because I don't think anything new is happening in Pimbal.

[25:20] Well, we might get that Padredy gaming

[25:23] Valley Williams remake.

[25:25] That's coming any day now.

[25:27] Everybody have a great Wednesday.

[25:28] We'll talk to you soon.

[25:29] I'll stay directly at the sun, but never in the mirror.

[25:34] It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero.
