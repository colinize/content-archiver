[00:00] I think the best way to start out this journey on listening to all of the unreleased guns

[00:05] and roses material or the demo tracks and the original 1999-2001 Chinese democracy tapes

[00:12] which are infamous now in the world of guns and roses.

[00:15] I think the best way to start this out is to understand one simple fact that Axe Rose

[00:20] wanted to make an album that buried his arched nemesis which ironically was his lead guitarist

[00:28] slash.

[00:29] That so much of this album was fueled by his hatred of slash and his desire to record music

[00:36] that sounded nothing like the slash material of guns and roses of old and we're going

[00:42] to start this with a song from 1999.

[00:45] Now you might not know this but Axe Rose re-recorded Sweet Child of Mine and put it on the soundtrack

[00:52] to the Big Daddy movie.

[00:55] What's interesting here is one very very simple change to the song Axel made.

[01:00] In between verses after he says wo wo wo wo sweet child of mine there is usually that

[01:05] iconic slash solo you know.

[01:10] Axel just removes it from the song.

[01:13] Let's listen to that right now and this is the ultimate F you to slash in 1999.

[01:55] Did you catch it?

[02:06] Did you see how he just went on into the second verse without that guitar solo and listen

[02:10] to Axel's voice in 1999.

[02:13] What other song do you think he recorded right around this time period that has that same

[02:17] sort of throatiness and almost like there's a frog stuck in his throat kind of voice

[02:23] where he's just straining to get out the lyrics reminds me of this song from Chinese

[02:26] democracy.

[02:28] Oh no I won't be told anymore.

[02:33] Did I have a look down in this door?

[02:38] Oh it has no far out from this door.

[02:44] Or Axel always left so far out from this shore so here's what we're going to do.

[02:49] We're going to play for you now songs that evolved and then we're going to get to the

[02:54] instrumental stuff the world has never heard and we're going to end then with the new

[02:58] tracks that have vocals on it that the world's never heard before and I think that's a good

[03:02] way to do this.

[03:03] So let's talk about the evolution of tracks on Chinese democracy because he would have

[03:08] a raw album ready to go in 2001.

[03:11] Let's play for you right now.

[03:13] Let's play for you right now the original version of the song Chinese democracy that was

[03:19] ready to go in 2001 that Axel was insecure about now.

[03:24] Keep in mind that this song is recorded without bucket head.

[03:28] We are then going to listen to the part that bucket head added to this album that I think

[03:32] makes it even better but here's how he originally wanted the song Chinese democracy to sound.

[03:39] Actually let's listen to the album version first so you can hear the difference of the

[03:42] original to the one the world finally got and you let's talk about which one we think

[03:47] has more pop.

[05:13] What I love about hearing that first is you're going to realize when you hear the original

[05:17] version of the song how much more work Axel put into the final version of the song the

[05:23] world got.

[05:24] Now what I want you to hear now is the original version of Chinese democracy and a few things

[05:29] I want you to listen to how there's much less going on musically.

[05:33] You hear a lot more of the bass line when Axel singing just the bass in his voice which

[05:37] is really cool and much raw or then the final version which has a lot of slide guitar

[05:42] work by Bumblefoot.

[05:44] You're also going to hear the guitar solo at the end of the song I believe it's Josh

[05:48] freezes guitar solo.

[05:50] Now on the final studio version bucket head he lets Josh freezes part play and then

[05:56] he adds to the solo which I think makes it even better and you're going to see that

[06:00] as we show some examples of how bucket heads additions made stuff so much better but it's

[06:06] all cup copy and paste it right it's cut and paste material it's not like he wrote the

[06:11] entire solo so let's listen to the entire raw version of the original song Chinese democracy

[06:19] listen to the guitar solo and then we're going to play bucket heads addition after so

[06:23] here we go here's the original 1999 2001 version of Chinese democracy.

[07:11] Real-time visionaries sitting in a Chinese stew to view my dear seeing fat two-way shots

[07:21] I know that I'm a classic case watch out for different gennities

[07:27] playing it for the fall and the gone they sing the end and you can't move on now

[07:36] cause it will take a lot more hate than you to win a vaccination

[07:43] even with an iron fist more than you got to rule the nation with all I got is register

[07:54] it don't really matter it's not people's myself

[08:00] it's said it don't really matter it's not like the mouth of somebody else

[08:08] cause it will take a lot more time than you I've got a masturbation

[08:15] even with an iron fist more than you got to rule the nation with all I got is register

[08:25] more than you got to rule the nation with all I got is register

[08:46] it don't really matter

[08:49] alright let's stop it there because you hear how the guitar solo goes and then it goes until you don't really matter

[08:54] now that's the short version of the original guitar solo of this song before bucket head came on board

[09:01] now listen to the same solo and then listen to how bucket head takes this solo and this song to a whole other level

[09:15] yeah!

[09:21] yeah!

[09:23] yeah!

[09:39] it don't really matter

[09:42] i give you a high top for yourself

[09:45] No stone will matter

[09:48] So you can't hear it now from somebody else

[09:52] You think you got it all enough inside

[09:56] To add a thing to another day

[10:00] To attract the world in the fog from the south

[10:04] Now you're dealing with your own game now

[10:07] Wake up, wake up, I'll make a sound

[10:11] From the road, reach out for you

[10:15] And you're out of game

[10:21] I think that shows the world why Buckethead was the biggest acquisition that Axaro's got when he was working on this material

[10:28] I'm gonna do another example of what Buckethead brought to this band and why when he left

[10:33] It was pretty much over for this band being exciting when Buckethead exited the band

[10:38] So this another song Axaro was working on called There was a Time

[10:42] I want to play for you there was a time before Buckethead and then after Buckethead

[10:48] So let's play for you there was a time and Buckethead added about a minute and a half of

[10:54] Amazing guitar work that just again brought that song to another level of greatness

[10:59] So here's the original version of There was a time

[11:42] Wow

[11:54] ets

[11:55] too much

[11:59] Nope

[12:00] Nope

[12:01] Nope

[12:02] Nope

[12:02] Nope

[12:04] Nope

[12:05] Nope

[12:06] Nope

[12:07] culturally

[12:08] Yeah

[12:09] But

[12:10] I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

[12:40] Lord, where we live

[12:43] Come here when you die

[12:50] Loving me in the water

[12:53] No matter whatρέ

[12:57] Alone over the night

[13:01] without you

[13:04] You're a little shy, too long to let go

[13:13] You're a little shy, too long to let go

[13:20] You're a little shy, too long to let go

[13:34] Let's listen to the same exact song with Buckethead in the band

[13:44] And you tell me this band didn't make this band so much better and was actually more talented than Axel

[13:50] Here we go, same exact section, can you find Buckethead?

[13:53] But there was a time

[14:23] Yeah, you're a little shy, too long to let go

[14:43] Here there was a time, you're a little shy, too long to let go

[14:59] Tell you what you know we are, so wonderful

[15:07] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[15:26] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[15:36] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[15:56] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[16:26] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[16:56] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[17:06] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[17:22] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[17:36] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[17:51] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[18:21] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[18:51] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[19:21] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[19:36] Oh, I was a little shy, too long to let go

[19:44] Walk anyone

[19:47] That need a girlfriend

[19:49] From some guy

[19:50] I need a girlfriend

[19:52] From some woman

[19:53] Who cares

[19:56] To be

[19:58] A lucky girl

[20:01] A lucky

[20:03] And then the boys

[20:04] Who they're gay

[20:07] Who fall in

[20:10] So many sad women

[20:12] Who know how to show

[20:13] All the memories

[20:15] You and me

[20:16] Is going on

[20:18] All the love

[20:21] I'm falling into the rain

[20:24] Game that I want

[20:26] To be my hero

[20:28] You're so

[20:29] Be my last step

[20:32] So tell me

[20:33] What we got

[20:35] And all the love

[20:36] And all the love

[20:37] To fall

[20:42] To fall

[20:44] To fall

[20:46] Alright are you ready?

[20:48] That same exact song

[20:50] Puttered by Bumblefoot

[20:52] And it starts off right away

[20:54] Right when Axel starts in

[20:56] With his beautiful lyric

[20:58] On an ordinary day

[21:00] Back in an ordinary way

[21:01] Just listen to you how Bumblefoot's guitar

[21:03] Just is doing all this random weird stuff

[21:06] And it's just like

[21:08] Takes away from the beauty of the song

[21:10] And all the love

[21:12] And all the love

[21:14] And all the love

[21:16] And all the love

[21:18] And all the love

[21:20] It's leading

[21:22] Back in an ordinary way

[21:24] All I would want

[21:26] To sound out

[21:36] Knowing that you won't let me fall

[21:38] For they've bought some cloud, we'll get out here

[21:44] So many ma'am dancing up

[21:49] And I've let me end this world away

[21:55] From the night

[21:57] Grab your sore wounds in my head

[22:01] Use the memor Darwinian

[22:06] You're the one

[22:09] How about it took a bite?

[22:13] You ain't that bad for a guy

[22:15] You took my feelings

[22:17] And you're my stress

[22:20] Sometimes I'm the only thing

[22:23] I can't hold on to you

[22:25] I want everything

[22:27] I want you

[22:29] I want you

[22:32] I want you

[22:35] I want you

[22:40] I want you

[22:45] I want you

[22:49] I mean what the fuck right?

[22:51] It's like Axel just didn't know where to stop with this album

[22:54] And that's just the story of Chinese democracy

[22:57] Now let's get to

[22:58] Let's just get to the new stuff

[23:00] And before we do that

[23:01] Let's just play

[23:02] I think this is a good example of how

[23:04] So many different types of sounds

[23:07] Are in all of these songs

[23:09] And I tell people that

[23:10] Chinese democracy is like a fine cognac

[23:13] You have to sort of listen

[23:15] To hear all these unique notes that are pieced together

[23:18] And it's kind of amazing that Axel was able to assemble

[23:22] All of these competing sounds into songs

[23:25] That ultimately some of them were actually really good

[23:28] And let's take for example

[23:29] Let's start with this song

[23:31] This song was called

[23:33] $3 Pyramid when they started working on it

[23:36] That was like the track name

[23:38] Now you're going to recognize it once I played for you

[23:40] But let's look at a musical composition by this band

[23:44] And you'll get a sense of like all of the different sounds they were going for

[23:48] And it actually is kind of beautiful when you strip away the lyrics

[23:51] And you just listen to how it's all assembled

[23:54] So let's hear $3 Pyramid

[24:31] $3 Pyramid

[25:01] $3 Pyramid

[28:01] Now, better was written by Mr. Robin think of 9-inch snails.

[28:17] Now here's what we're going to do.

[28:18] We're going to play a mixture of songs that have vocals from this period of time and songs

[28:24] that are just instrumental.

[28:26] And you could see how Axel could take an instrumental piece and absolutely change it into a different

[28:33] song by what I'm going to share first.

[28:35] So let's do this.

[28:36] Let's play for you the demo of a song that then became the same name song on Chinese

[28:44] Democracy.

[28:45] But I want you to try and guess what song this is as I play it.

[28:47] Here we go.

[29:14] Alright, so this is a good time to stop it because what you're going to see now is Axel

[29:27] Rose took that demo and made a song out of it.

[29:30] Now you're going to see what I mean when I say Axel had all these guys just make music

[29:36] and then he adjusted it so that what you just heard he clearly slowed it down and turned

[29:42] it into this song.

[30:06] Isn't it incredible how much it changed from the demo that was written by Buckethead

[30:11] to what ended up on the album.

[30:13] Let's listen to Ron Bumblefoot's solo in Shaqler's Revenge and then I'm going to play for

[30:19] you something the world's never heard which is the solo that Bumblefoot had originally put

[30:24] into Shaqler's Revenge and what's interesting is Bumblefoot trying to emulate the sound

[30:31] that Buckethead created.

[30:32] I don't think it's good but here's the album version of the solo.

[30:41] Alright, well that's not actually too bad.

[31:08] I think Bumblefoot when he has to recreate Buckethead he actually is in his element of

[31:13] shredding right.

[31:14] Doesn't work when he's recreating Brian May Solo's.

[31:17] Now let's listen to Buckethead's original solo in the original version of Shaqler's Revenge.

[31:24] Really cool.

[31:25] No one's ever heard this.

[31:26] Here we go.

[31:38] Alright, right.

[32:01] So you can get this industrial metal sound to this album, right?

[32:05] So here's the deal.

[32:06] Let's start out.

[32:07] Let's start out with the first of our instrumental tracks that we're going to listen to.

[32:12] This is a song that was rumored to be one of the tracks that would be on Chinese democracy.

[32:17] This is the instrumental version of a song called Zodiac.

[32:22] Let's take it away.

[36:36] Now that sounds like a final version of a song that's just waiting for Axel Lyriks.

[37:06] Now he also was really fascinated with Nine Inch Nails.

[37:10] Now this song has Axel Lyriks.

[37:13] I'm not sure if this was going to be the complete song, but this definitely shows that

[37:18] Axel Rose was really also trying to experiment with a Nine Inch Nails Robin Fink kind of sound.

[37:25] And this song is called, and this has vocals.

[37:27] This is called Silk Worms.

[40:36] I mean, imagine that on an album by a band that released Sweet Child of Mine in Paradise

[41:06] will feel like one of the largest band in 10 albums in the country is an annual song.

[41:18] it that basically is another 9 inch nails inspired track. This one is called I On You.

[42:48] I'm happy that you have to say for good. If that was all I ever thought I'd bet to you.

[43:48] I'm happy that you have to say for good.

[43:54] All this time I thought I ever had you. I know the best you did I wanted to.

[44:05] All I say is you say for good. If that was all I ever thought I'd bet to you.

[44:16] All this time I thought I ever had you. I know the best you did I wanted to.

[44:27] All I say is you say for good. If that was all I ever thought I'd bet to you.

[44:58] Again, you can definitely hear the 9 inch nails influence on that song and the Robin Fink influence.

[45:07] Now let's play another instrumental track that doesn't have axel lyrics but also gives you another interesting insight into the kind of musical sound he was going for on Chinese democracy.

[45:19] And just ask yourself, could you see a song with this kind of musical direction? Could you see it on Chinese democracy? Does it have a home there?

[45:28] This is called Me and My Elvis.

[50:49] What do you think? Do you think axel had a hit there? I don't know. I don't know. A lot of interesting stuff going on.

[51:11] But again, you see this like these songs just don't have normal sort of composition. There's no defining guitar solos in them. It's a lot of stuff going on.

[51:22] Speaking of a lot of stuff going on, this next track, Atlas Shrugged. Whenever people were talking about the big guns that were going to be on Chinese democracy, this is before the album was out.

[51:33] We always heard about this song Atlas Shrugged. Now it turns out this song is a little bit like a sweet home Alabama kind of like country guitar funk going on with it.

[51:43] And on guitar on this song is Mr. Brian May from Queen and see if you can sort of get a sense of the difference from that industrial rock sound to a song like this.

[51:53] And you can get a sense that Axel didn't quite know what kind of sound he was going for because this song sounds a lot like the same vibe as Ketchur and the Rye.

[52:02] So let's play Atlas Shrugged right now.

[52:23] I'm saying I just want to find out that I'm letting go.

[52:28] Oh, I can't help it from the back. So if you managed to become a stillness, I'll show me how to keep it together.

[52:42] When I tried it with me, no matter what's the way that still always to go,

[52:53] oh, so if you ask me to believe you're I won't mind when you always get a mind of its own.

[53:04] When it says one and the more it's fun, and you're the one who stole us just,

[53:13] we ain't got enough who's shown the strong way and then had enough of.

[53:21] I'll leave it like I said, don't follow your heart, but for the only thing you'll be there.

[53:31] And what you know, what you've done, and what we know you've done today.

[53:42] It's not the thing, if I were you, I would say all that I knew to be happy as strong,

[53:52] but I'll still be alone.

[53:56] Here's your day for time, to look back at what you find your heart's advantage.

[54:04] When it says one and the more it's fun, and you're the one who stole us just,

[54:13] we ain't got enough who's shown the strong way and then had enough of.

[54:21] I'll leave it like I said, don't follow your heart, but for the only thing you'll be there.

[54:30] And what you know, what you've done, and what we know you've done today.

[54:39] And what you've done today, don't follow your heart, but for the only thing you'll be there.

[54:48] And what you know, what you've done today, is all that I hope you understand.

[55:09] Oh!

[55:23] I need the list to sit on

[55:25] By the rear hall

[55:27] And there's more new way than day

[55:29] To be me

[55:31] Oh!

[55:33] That's why you're not

[55:35] And what you show

[55:37] And what will I understand?

[55:40] I will not say no, but I will hold you

[55:45] But God, that's what it takes to make a man

[55:49] From what you've known, all that you've been shown

[55:54] The deeds of our God, do understand

[56:07] Now that's a great example of a song in which I do think there's a little too much going on

[56:19] It's kind of hard to hear acts of through all of this stuff happening

[56:23] It would have been much better just an acoustic guitar and those beautiful lyrics

[56:27] Now again, these are not final album versions of the music

[56:31] But you see how they're doing that effect on his voice

[56:34] It's just too much tinkering of a good thing

[56:38] So let's jump back into an instrumental track that no one's really heard before

[56:43] And this again will show you that hard metal sound he was going for on half of the material

[56:51] This is a song, let's see, it's called Dummy

[56:55] And this is the hardest of all the instrumental leaks

[56:58] Let's listen to Dummy right now
