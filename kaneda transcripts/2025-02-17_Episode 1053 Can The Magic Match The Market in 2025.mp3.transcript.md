[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] I had a little pregame show going on there on Facebook and I came up with this show topic

[00:29] on this President's Day holiday.

[00:32] Now look, daycare is closed, so I got the kids here.

[00:35] The theme of this show, can the magic of pinball, can it catch up to the market of pinball?

[00:43] And those two words, I mean it, it's like a Venn diagram.

[00:47] We need to see more of an overlap.

[00:50] The magic and the market.

[00:52] Think about them just colliding together.

[00:55] The pinball market has been inflated prematurely, in my honest opinion, before the magic arrived.

[01:04] Jersey Jack Pinball raised its prices on Toy Story 4.

[01:10] They kept those prices $12,000 and $15,000 and then we got Godfather, Elton John and

[01:18] Avatar and none of those games.

[01:20] You know it, none of those games have been worth $12,000 to $15,000.

[01:26] Stern Pinball raised its prices.

[01:28] Godzilla, the most packed modern Stern over the last four years, was $10,500.

[01:38] Then they raised the price.

[01:40] I think the first LE that was $13,000 was Foo Fighters, I want to say.

[01:46] Then James Bond, Venom, Jaws, John Wick, then we got D&D, has the Stern magic lived up to

[01:56] the market price of those games.

[01:59] I would say that Stern has done a better job of getting the magic close to the market.

[02:07] Spooky Pinballs have gotten more expensive.

[02:09] I think Spooky Pinball has done a good job where, you know, if you don't load it up with

[02:13] the butter and all the expensive toppers, you're still getting a game for below $10,000

[02:20] where they're only making $888.

[02:25] American Pinball can't even make anything new.

[02:28] They've got all their old games in boxes nobody wants.

[02:32] They don't have any magic, even though they have Houdini.

[02:35] They don't have any magic that answers what the market is pricing these games at.

[02:41] Cuphead's not going to be that.

[02:42] I just want to go on a little bit of a tangent, everybody.

[02:45] Cuphead is going to be a flop.

[02:50] Nobody I know is going to make room in their game room for Cuphead.

[02:55] Now it has so much bad press.

[02:59] You know this game was developed during a period in which the leadership over there

[03:05] was maybe one of the worst leaderships in all of Pinball.

[03:09] It's going to be indicative of what the product is.

[03:12] You really think that Ryan McQuade over there is going to drop a Keith Elwin-like Iron Maiden

[03:19] experience with Cuphead and just everybody.

[03:22] Theme is important and again, it's not a theme that's going to move and when are you going

[03:28] to release it?

[03:29] When's a good time to release Cuphead?

[03:31] When you got Harry Potter, you've got freaking, what else?

[03:34] You got King Kong, we've got Barrels of Fun, which they might be making G.I. Joe.

[03:39] Okay, let's go down this road right now.

[03:42] Will there be a G.I. Joe game from freaking Barrels of Fun?

[03:48] The reason why Jason Knapp put up this story, we've been thinking about what's next from

[03:52] Barrels.

[03:53] It's clearly not going to be Dune Pinball.

[03:56] Here's the biggest thing that Jason missed in his story.

[03:59] Brian Savage, who's the co-creator of Barrels of Fun Pinball, Brian Savage has spent like

[04:07] 25 years of his career as the head of the G.I. Joe fan club and he did all these G.I.

[04:16] Joe conventions and transformer conventions.

[04:19] This guy is the guy when it comes to like 80s G.I. Joe and transformers and so if he's

[04:27] the co-founder of this company, it is a really good guess that G.I. Joe pinball from Barrels

[04:34] of Fun might be in the cards and if they make a G.I. Joe pinball machine, yo Joe, in a year

[04:44] in which America's back baby, I think it would do so well for this demographic.

[04:52] I think a lot of us, he-man, back to the future, transformers, thunder cats, like you just

[05:00] make any of those nostalgic 80s cartoons.

[05:04] Now you gotta do it right.

[05:06] Don't do it wrong like Ninja Turtles where you make the game too hard and you don't use

[05:11] the iconic 80s or 90s cartoons.

[05:15] You make new versions of them.

[05:17] That is stupid.

[05:18] They make G.I. Joe pinball.

[05:21] I want to see the G.I. Joe cartoons I grew up with in the game itself.

[05:27] I love G.I. Joe.

[05:29] It's fun.

[05:30] Transformers G1.

[05:32] It's fun.

[05:33] Thunder cats.

[05:34] Fun.

[05:35] He-man.

[05:36] Fun.

[05:37] That's the other rumor is that like American pinball is like we might release the next

[05:40] two games and the other game was always rumor to be He-man but again if they make He-man

[05:46] it's gonna be bad.

[05:48] We know this.

[05:49] We know this.

[05:50] What have they done?

[05:51] What have they done?

[05:52] Like what designer have they hired?

[05:54] What move have they made that makes you think American pinball has got a magical game ready

[06:02] to go that's gonna be successful in this pinball market?

[06:07] It's gonna get very competitive very quickly and I have been watching a lot of other content.

[06:15] If you like cars or watches everybody's having this conversation now.

[06:21] It's like after COVID all these grown men that have put an inordinate amount of money

[06:27] into other toys you know if you have a lot of money you can collect cars.

[06:32] I feel like car collections are men who have a lot more money than pinball collectors.

[06:37] Now there's some very wealthy pinball collectors and you're out there you know who you are.

[06:42] You could also be in the cars.

[06:43] You might be in the both.

[06:45] Watch collectors are very similar.

[06:47] It's easier to get into watch collecting than it is even pins or cars because guess how

[06:53] small the watch is and there's hundreds of watch companies.

[06:57] Now in pinball the reason I love it the reason you love it it's not hard to understand everything

[07:03] happening in pinball.

[07:04] You know sometimes we say well there's a lot of companies making pins.

[07:07] Yeah there's like 13.

[07:10] If you go in the auto world or the watch world or the wine world there's hundreds of companies.

[07:15] There's thousands of products being pumped out into the world but everyone's having

[07:20] the same discussion in 2025.

[07:24] We are all waking up to a sober reality that prices have gone nuts that a lot of stuff

[07:33] now is depreciating at a level that you just can't ignore.

[07:40] And so there's only one way really there really is only one way to create something in pinball

[07:48] that is like recession proof or depreciation proof.

[07:52] And that is you make a magical game.

[07:57] You make a magical game based on a theme people want and you make the game so much fun that

[08:07] when you buy it you're never going to think about selling it.

[08:12] To me that's the supernal realm of pinball.

[08:15] That's when you reach magical status.

[08:18] That is the realm of masterpiece.

[08:20] I don't even care right.

[08:21] I don't care what it costs.

[08:23] I don't care about what I paid for it because I know I'm never going to sell it.

[08:29] Now what's interesting about pinball than these like three to four hundred pound toys

[08:34] we have to lug around our houses is I think we're all at the stage now where we're getting

[08:39] a little bit tired of that constant rotation right because if you were one of those people

[08:45] that really enjoyed rotating games in and out of your game room you got hammered over

[08:51] the last three to four years.

[08:52] Like you just got hammered.

[08:54] If you bought stuff brand new in a box you got hammered.

[08:58] Now the smart people and you know who you are West Bentley the smart people out there they

[09:03] don't buy new in box when they do rotations.

[09:07] They want to enjoy the best pinball has to offer and the last thing they would do is chase

[09:13] the FOMO and pay full retail for a game.

[09:17] I was just talking to my friend West he got a Guns N' Roses collector's edition for $9000.

[09:26] Like think about that for a minute.

[09:28] That is $6000 cheaper than Avatar and Guns N' Roses is a much better pin than Avatar.

[09:36] The reason I know that Jersey Jack will struggle to sell 1500 avatars.

[09:43] There's a reason why they probably sold 6500 Guns N' Roses machines.

[09:48] So if you want to experience a lot of pinball magic you don't need to fall victim to the

[09:54] new in box market because I think the new in box market as we go on is the worst market

[10:00] to engage with.

[10:01] If you don't need to have it right now why would you rush after these things brand new

[10:08] they're all going to pop up for sale.

[10:10] Look how many Metallica remastered LEs are for sale right now and they only made 500

[10:18] and it just goes to show.

[10:19] I think for some weird reason over the last few years these manufacturers thought the market

[10:27] for pinball was bigger than it really is.

[10:30] It's not.

[10:31] It hasn't grown nearly as much as they think.

[10:34] And do you know something crazy and this is like I've never heard anybody say this but

[10:39] stern pinball initially when they were thinking where they could take their brand within the

[10:45] pinball market within the global demand for their product stern pinball initially wanted

[10:51] to make 1500 LEs before they settled on a thousand.

[10:57] See this is the problem.

[10:59] There's not 1500 people in the world that are going to spend $13,000 on your pinball

[11:06] machine and if they actually did do that and they tested that market the games would

[11:12] not have sold out and then you would have had 1500 potential people.

[11:16] Let's just say they did sell out and 1500 people spent $13,000 on your game and then

[11:22] those games sink down well below 10 grand.

[11:26] I think they would sink all the way down to $8,000 because there's 1500 of them in the

[11:31] world and then you've basically handed 1500 people of $5,000 loss because they bought your

[11:38] product and you think that's sustainable.

[11:41] So we'll see what happens everybody because King Kong I have high hopes that King Kong

[11:46] is going to bring big magic to pinball.

[11:50] It's also going to bring a big price increase.

[11:53] I heard stern is going to add $600 to the price of the game.

[11:57] So we're looking at $13,600 if they make a King Kong topper.

[12:03] We're now in that really scary territory where a stern machine fully loaded is aiming closer

[12:12] to 15 grand than 10 grand.

[12:15] We've gone in the wrong direction and again it's like I think there's a lot of you out

[12:20] there that are like I don't even care how magical these games are Kaneda.

[12:24] They've just gone bonkers.

[12:26] But what keeps me optimistic, what keeps me excited about pinball is this.

[12:33] Those 13 companies they know they need the magic or their games are going to be DOA if

[12:42] the market prices are this high.

[12:45] Guess who's going to benefit?

[12:47] You and I because the days of mediocre themes are over.

[12:52] The days of charging a lot of money for empty games are over.

[12:57] There's a reason why CGC is going to bring back medieval madness like any week now because

[13:03] they know they're going to sell every single one.

[13:07] Look how much more is in medieval madness than a $15,000 avatar.

[13:15] Look at that game.

[13:17] There's like one mech in freaking medieval madness is more impressive than all the mechs

[13:22] combined in avatar.

[13:25] And so magic, right?

[13:26] It's like if you've got something magical and that's why stern pinball, trust me when

[13:31] I say this, stern pinball is going to remake everything that they know is their magic.

[13:39] There's going to be remakes of walking dead, Ghostbusters, Tron.

[13:44] Of course they're going to remake all this stuff.

[13:46] And they found that loophole, anything that was made during the D&D period can come back

[13:52] in a new Ellie form.

[13:54] And they don't care.

[13:55] You think they care about torpedoing guys that have had those games for 10 years.

[14:01] I think the statue of limitations on getting out of those games is over.

[14:07] So if you had like a Metallica Ellie, the original one, the days of you getting $16,000

[14:14] are over.

[14:15] If you watch these delusional guys, they're trying to get like $16,000 for their master

[14:20] of puppets, Ellie.

[14:21] I don't care that you powder coat it the armor.

[14:24] Yeah, that game would have sold for $16,000 like four months ago, but now it's like a

[14:30] $10,000 to $12,000 game at most.

[14:33] But I love watching a good pinball delusion.

[14:36] I love it.

[14:37] I mean, you go in the pinside marketplace and there's still dudes trying to sell Godfather's

[14:42] CE for $15,000 in a box.

[14:45] There's still like those distributors who just are reluctant to price the damn thing

[14:50] where it needs to be.

[14:51] How much do you think you need to price a Godfather's CE new inbox?

[14:57] It was $15,000 new.

[15:00] What do you think actually gets money on the table?

[15:03] I think it's going to have to be like 10.

[15:04] I mean it like 10 new inbox because you can get open ones for cheaper because again, then

[15:10] the only value is that damn box and anything over $10,000 you're just paying for the cardboard.

[15:18] So I'm excited because the themes are going to have to be magical.

[15:22] Are we going to get Sonic the Hedgehog?

[15:24] I hope Stern pinball makes Super Mario Brothers.

[15:28] I would rather have Super Mario Brothers and so would you over Pokemon.

[15:34] So that's a rumored theme.

[15:36] We also know Stern is going to come out with more music pins.

[15:40] Are we going to get Journey?

[15:41] Do you want Journey?

[15:42] I love Journey music.

[15:44] I just don't want a Journey pinball machine.

[15:46] What about Motley Crue?

[15:48] We're hearing rumors about the Beastie Boys and Jersey Jack has the Beastie Boys license.

[15:55] Now I could see Steve Ritchie doing Beastie Boys.

[15:58] Here's the thing everybody, Steve Ritchie is not going to do Matrix or Top Gun.

[16:04] I don't think it's happening and the reason why is both of those licenses come with nothing.

[16:12] You can't make a Top Gun pinball machine without Tom Cruise.

[16:17] So the two rumored games that I think are the front runners is that Steve Ritchie is

[16:22] doing Sonic the Hedgehog.

[16:24] Yes, I love that.

[16:25] Or he's doing Beastie Boys.

[16:28] Both of them are great.

[16:29] Both of them are great for pinball.

[16:30] I mean Sonic the Hedgehog as a video game character.

[16:34] He is a freaking pinball flying around his world doing the loop-de-loops, the jumps, the

[16:40] springs, there's freaking pop bumpers all throughout the Sonic world.

[16:45] And Steve Ritchie is the king of flow and speed so I think it's a perfect marriage.

[16:50] Beastie Boys, high energy music.

[16:52] I mean freaking out.

[16:53] You could just put the Beastie Boys into the Elton John game and it would make Elton John

[16:58] that much better.

[17:00] After that we don't really have a lot more rumors with Jersey Jack.

[17:04] Man, this is it, right?

[17:05] Back to the futures come in sometime before you die.

[17:08] It's not going to happen anytime this year.

[17:10] I'm worried about Back to the Future.

[17:13] My friends over at Dutch Pinball know that I'm worried.

[17:16] I think they need to ink a deal.

[17:17] I don't think it's going to happen.

[17:20] I don't think we're going to see a Keith Elwin back to the future.

[17:23] I think Barry's going to want to do it himself and it's fine.

[17:26] We'll see what he comes up with.

[17:28] I don't know what they're going to do when they actually get orders for this game and

[17:31] they can only make 10 a week.

[17:32] He's going to be making this thing for eight years.

[17:35] But man, that's where we're at.

[17:36] It's a lot.

[17:37] I know these games cost a lot of money.

[17:39] It's at the point now where if you want to buy just two of the top of the line games

[17:45] from Stern and Jersey Jack, it's scary to say that you are now dropping $28,000 before

[17:54] taxes, before shipping on two pinball machines.

[17:58] $28,000.

[18:00] I mean, it's nuts, people.

[18:02] That's a few Rolexes.

[18:04] It's a car.

[18:05] It's a lot more.

[18:06] Is it bringing you that much fun?

[18:08] I mean, it's weird to me to say that.

[18:11] You used to be able to go get two Stern Elise for like 12 grand and now it's $28,000 and

[18:20] the games are not that much better.

[18:23] The games are not that much better.

[18:25] They're definitely not bringing that much more fun.

[18:28] I mean, I got to Lord of the Rings for seven grand.

[18:32] Nothing that's new is better than that game.

[18:35] Nothing.

[18:36] And they want twice as much.

[18:38] Everybody, I can't wait to see what's next.

[18:42] I think the next release we're going to get is Barrels of Fun.

[18:45] I think Potter is going to be after Barrels of Fun.

[18:49] So here's the order that could happen.

[18:52] We could get Barrels of Fun, G.I.

[18:54] Joe.

[18:55] Then we get Harry Potter.

[18:57] Then we get King Kong.

[18:59] Then I think we're going to get Walking Dead Remake.

[19:03] Then we're going to get Medieval Madness.

[19:04] I forgot that Medieval Madness is probably going to come out probably even before Harry

[19:09] Potter.

[19:10] So G.I.

[19:11] Joe, Medieval Madness.

[19:13] I'm trying to get the order right live, which is hard.

[19:16] We're going to get G.I.

[19:17] Joe, Medieval Madness, Harry Potter, King Kong, Walking Dead Remake.

[19:24] Another game by John Borg.

[19:26] Maybe it's Journey.

[19:27] Who knows what comes out after the Walking Dead Remake.

[19:31] Then we're going to get, at the end of the year, we're also going to get Beetlejuice

[19:35] from Spooky Pinball, Padredy Gaming somewhere in the mix.

[19:40] Maybe they've got Predator.

[19:41] We've got Toten coming back as well.

[19:44] What else is out there in the pinball world?

[19:46] Who am I missing?

[19:47] Jerry's going to bring out Portal from Multimorphic, right?

[19:50] You add all this up.

[19:51] Hundreds of thousands of dollars of new product, new pinball machine, thousands of new games.

[19:57] If the magic is not there, these games are going to die instantly in the market.

[20:06] If the magic isn't there.

[20:08] Everybody, this is a good time to be a buyer who is patient.

[20:14] Don't rush in.

[20:15] Only fools rush in, people.

[20:17] All of these games, when you add it all up, there's just going to be so much available.

[20:23] And just wait.

[20:24] Be patient.

[20:26] If you want to buy a game right away, like X-Men, and then wonder if the code's going to get better.

[20:33] And that's the other thing too.

[20:34] At these prices, there's no room anymore to release a game that's not finished.

[20:41] People are not going to wait forever now to see if the magic arrives.

[20:46] You want my money right away?

[20:48] Then you better prove to me right away the magic is there.

[20:51] Happy President's Day, people.

[21:23] In the world it must be strong, or else why please, I'm made of love.

[21:33] And in the end, all dreams we will defend, cause us, why love is made of love?
