[00:00] I see the bad moon rising.

[00:05] I see trouble on the way.

[00:08] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:13] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Spinball Podcast. I'm your host, Canada.

[00:16] I'm so excited for you to hear this episode.

[00:18] It took me over four hours to edit what you're going to hear on this episode of

[00:22] Canadian Spinball Podcast. So don't ever say that I don't love you.

[00:26] So here's what happened. It was like four in the morning and Neil McCrae

[00:29] over in the UK is like, dude, you need to listen to the pinball profile.

[00:33] Jeff Teol is interviews Jack Guinari and Steve Ritchie and you're not going to

[00:37] believe the stuff they say, stuff like the Godfather is selling well.

[00:42] And Toy Story 4 is a great theme for pinball.

[00:44] And so I gave it a listen and it was like a good 20 minute interview and I was

[00:49] laughing out loud at a lot of the stuff that Jack says, but it's Jack being Jack.

[00:53] So here's what I'm going to do on this episode.

[00:55] I am going to at the end of this episode, re-release with a few edits done by

[01:00] Canada. I think you'll be able to pick out the stuff I put into the show.

[01:04] I'm going to re-air for you the pinball profile interview of Jack and Steve

[01:09] Ritchie with a little additions from Canada. Now look, before you hear it,

[01:13] I just want everybody to know this. This is meant to be satire.

[01:17] It's meant to be a joke. We need to laugh more in this hobby.

[01:22] Everybody takes way too much of this hobby, way too seriously.

[01:26] And we're here for entertainment and nobody entertains you more than

[01:30] Canada. I do want to say this. If you're a fan of pinball profile,

[01:34] show Jeff Teal is some freaking love. At the beginning of his show,

[01:38] he talks about Patreon support and how he's thankful for everybody who

[01:42] supports the pinball profile. The dude has done over 340 episodes of

[01:47] pinball and he has a total of five Patreon subscribers. Five!

[01:51] Are you kidding me? If you're a fan of Jeff and you listen to the show,

[01:55] go show that man some support. Alright, but before I do that,

[01:58] I want to talk about what I thought I was going to talk about on this

[02:01] episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast. I thought I was going to give my

[02:04] Venom first impressions and I went over to Jack Barr yesterday and I was

[02:08] there for over an hour and I didn't play a single game of Venom and I'm

[02:14] going to explain why right now. You know, sometimes you walk into a

[02:17] pinball bar and there's a brand new game out and you just want to play it.

[02:21] You just want to play it for the first time without any distractions.

[02:26] I don't want to talk to people about it. I don't want to hear other

[02:29] people's opinions. I just want to jump on the game and play about five

[02:33] games myself uninterrupted. Now, when I got to Jack Barr,

[02:37] there were a few people playing Venom and they played it and they played it

[02:41] again and they kept playing it and playing it and playing it.

[02:44] Even though they asked me if I wanted to join, I really didn't because

[02:47] the way they were playing the game, they were so overly dramatic about it

[02:52] all. There was an older gentleman with a ponytail. There was a younger

[02:55] gentleman and another younger gentleman at the bar and they were really

[02:58] going over the game pointing out the inserts. I mean, they were really

[03:02] into it. When they were flipping this machine, they were slapping the

[03:05] buttons as if they were like in the IFPA championship match being

[03:09] broadcasted globally. I'm just thinking to myself, it's a beautiful sunny

[03:14] day in New York City. It's 75 degrees and sunny and perfect out. Here I am

[03:20] huddled into the corner of dark Jack Barr watching these three guys

[03:25] play this machine as if this is the most important thing in the world.

[03:29] I can't help but be honest with you. I just didn't care. I didn't care

[03:32] to jump on. I actually just wanted to watch them and see what the game

[03:36] was like from a spectator's point of view. I'll tell you this, there was

[03:40] one moment that made me laugh. The older gentleman walks away from the

[03:43] machine after like 20 plays and he goes, this game is going to be exactly

[03:47] like Avengers for me. I'm going to play it for two years and have

[03:51] absolutely no idea what I am doing. I can tell you this just from observing

[03:55] the game. It's all about just battles. It's not a story-driven game. It's

[03:59] all about just battle after battle after battle and getting your levels

[04:03] up and getting your stacking and your multiplying going. And that's it.

[04:06] I'm going to play the game, but I hope some of you can relate to this.

[04:09] Like you just want to play a game for the first time solo. You don't

[04:14] want any distractions. You don't want anyone else. And I will say this.

[04:18] I do think this is a little bit of pinball etiquette. I think if you've

[04:22] played a game like five times in a row and you look around you and you

[04:25] see there's other people in the bar that are clearly waiting for the

[04:28] machine, just step aside for a little bit. Go play something else.

[04:33] I get you're being social asking them to play with you, but not everybody

[04:38] wants that, especially a brand new game when they want to play it by themselves.

[04:42] I am not anti-social. It's just the way these guys were playing the

[04:46] machine. They were sliding the machine around, slapping it so hard,

[04:50] slamming their hands down on the lockdown bar. The older gentlemen kept

[04:53] cradling the ball and then just like pointing all around the play field,

[04:57] trying to point stuff out and all this stuff. And I just wasn't ready to go

[05:01] that deep. I just wanted to get a first gameplay impression because we all

[05:06] know on location, a game like Venom is not a game where you're going to

[05:10] learn the code on location. You're going to have to sit with this game in a

[05:14] home environment probably because it's got a 32 page rulebook.

[05:18] All right. So you're not listening to this about my missed opportunity to

[05:21] play Venom. One other news item that mystery pinball machine released

[05:25] new photos sometime Saturday. And now we got to see underneath the play

[05:29] field. We see a lot of mechanisms, apparently a lot of coils, a lot of

[05:33] wires. There looks like there's holes for subways or scoops. And it's also

[05:37] got an interesting back box, which is pretty steep. It looks steeper like

[05:41] the Zidware back box. Oh man, they better not be working with John

[05:45] Papadook. I don't think they're working with John Papadook on all the

[05:48] cabinets are lined up in a fancy manner on these like beautiful wooden

[05:52] easels that are holding up the cabinets. What excites me about this company is

[05:57] clearly they're figuring out manufacturing before they show the game

[06:01] to the world. It also looks like they're very, very close to revealing this

[06:05] game. Normally we don't see stuff like underneath the play field. We don't

[06:09] see stuff like inside a factory until a company is ready. After so many boutique

[06:14] companies burning us by taking pre-order money, I'm really happy to see a

[06:19] company that's clearly going to have a bunch of games made. They clearly have

[06:23] thought about the manufacturing of the game. The only thing I'm asking myself

[06:27] right now is well, what's going to go wrong? Because I feel like whenever

[06:30] these boutique companies do pop up like this, it's really hard to think through

[06:35] every possible thing that can go wrong. And I wish them the best of luck. I hope

[06:40] they at least give us like a timeframe. And if they're going to bring this

[06:43] pinball machine to Expo, I think they should let people know because I don't

[06:47] know about you, but right now I really don't see the biggest reason to go to

[06:51] Expo. There isn't an official like new game reveal on the schedule anywhere. We

[06:56] think pinball brothers might show up with their next game, but other than that

[06:59] nothing. And I get you might want to surprise people, but for people traveling

[07:04] and figuring out whether or not they should invest in the show, I think you

[07:07] should at least let people know there's going to be a mystery game revealed.

[07:10] I mean, that's all they've been saying is mystery here, mystery that. We'll see

[07:13] this sometime soon. All right, so let's get to this Jersey Jack interview. I

[07:18] just want to say this. This is satire. It's meant to be funny. There seems to

[07:22] be a little bit of delusion over at Jersey Jack at times and look, Jack is

[07:26] a perpetual salesman. He always spins everything to sound beneficial to the

[07:31] company. You know, notice how they never say Toy Story 4. Notice in the interview

[07:35] how it's always like Toy Story is an amazing property. Nobody's had Toy

[07:39] Story before. Nobody's brought out a Toy Story game. It's like, dude, you didn't

[07:43] bring out Toy Story. You brought out Toy Story 4. And then he says like, we

[07:47] don't bring in outside people. We need industry veterans that know a thing or

[07:51] two about pinball. We don't bring in anybody outside of pinball to give our

[07:55] company a lift. And it's like, Jack, you got bailed out by a banker. The

[08:00] president of your company is the son of the banker. What did he know about

[08:05] pinball? The president of Jersey Jack pinball is no longer Jersey Jack. It is

[08:09] Brett Abbess. They absolutely took outside money, outside knowledge and

[08:14] outside people to fix this company. Who knew nothing about pinball? Just own

[08:20] it. I don't care. Like, I'm glad you got bailed out by the Abbess family, but

[08:23] don't act like you didn't hire a whole bunch of people who knew nothing

[08:27] about pinball. You know, but look, here's the thing. It's like, I get that Jersey

[08:31] Jacks had two flops in a row, but really, it doesn't matter if the next

[08:35] game is a hit. And they know that. You know that. I know that. We're very

[08:39] fickle pinball fans. Like you could love stern pinball, but we all know venom is

[08:42] going to be a flop. And if a game is great, that's the greatest way to get

[08:46] people to forget some of your past mistakes. And that's all anybody wants

[08:51] from Jersey Jack. We just want a great game. We don't want you to talk about

[08:55] the company. We don't want you to talk about how well Godfather sold because

[08:58] we know it's not selling well. We know that toy story did not sell well. You

[09:03] know, and when Jack says like, you're never going to find any of their games

[09:06] that break down Jack, there's a reason why most operators don't operate Jersey

[09:11] Jack machines because they're much more problematic. And that's okay. Like you

[09:15] make a much more complex device and with the prices of your machines and with

[09:20] the depth of the code, you're not making machines for operators. You're making

[09:25] machines for the home collector. And I think that's the biggest issue I've

[09:29] always had with Jersey Jack. They just will never embrace the company. They

[09:34] should be. They keep trying to compete against Stern and they'll never be able

[09:38] to do it. As long as Stern's got a Stern pro for like 6500 bucks, how are you

[09:44] going to compete when your entry level is $12,000? And I know Jack likes to use

[09:51] like video game analogies. It doesn't matter how much the game costs. Yes,

[09:55] it does. This isn't Miss Pac-Man. It is not 1982. Times have changed and home

[10:02] buyers do not want to lose or take a bath on a brand new game because they'll

[10:07] just wait and get it used. All right, everybody. So I just want to give this

[10:11] to you right now. Thank you so much for the support. I hope you have a chuckle

[10:14] when you listen to this. And again, save all your legal threats for somebody

[10:18] else. I've got my lawyer on standby. If you're upset with this parody, then I

[10:23] think you need to find a new hobby because we got to learn to laugh at more

[10:26] of what goes on in this pinball hobby. And we have to hold people accountable

[10:30] to the things they say when they're true and when they're not true. And if people

[10:34] say stuff that's just ripe for comedy, you best believe Canadian is going to take

[10:38] advantage. Here you go. Enjoy.

[11:01] You can email pinballprofile.gmail.com. And if you'd like to show your support on

[11:06] Patreon, boy, that would be very, very kind. Before I started drinking, I could not do that.

[11:10] You can do so. Patreon.com.

[11:12] slash pinballprofile. Thanks to great people like Jimmy Law and Lua W. Rodney C.

[11:17] so many others. I can't thank you enough for your continued support. This was

[11:22] recorded a week ago with a couple of very special guests. Okay, this is a special

[11:28] treat for me here at Pentastic. I am in the luxury suite of one Steven Richie

[11:34] who's here with Jersey Jack. And Jersey Jack's here himself. Hey, Steve, how are you?

[11:38] I'm doing great, Jeff. Fun show. It's a great show.

[11:44] Lots of new games to play. I don't know. I like the people here. Very different.

[11:49] It's good. I've seen you at Pentastic before, the old location. I know this is a

[11:53] place that's very important to you too, Jack.

[11:55] I love it. Gabe and his buddies started it years ago. I was at the first one and I

[12:00] wouldn't miss it for anything. It's great. Boy, that was the plan to give you a boner.

[12:05] And you got one.

[12:08] The last one I was at, and again, old location, that was when Willy Wonka came out.

[12:12] And you had the kids there and stuff and obviously now all grown up. But that was a huge

[12:17] success for Jersey Jack, for Willy Wonka.

[12:19] It was great. That was really great fun. We had the Wonka kids and as you said,

[12:24] they've grown up and everybody got a kick out of it. They signed the autographs and

[12:27] took a lot of pictures. It was fun. But every show is fun. With the Godfather name,

[12:32] it's really some reaction to it. It's just amazing. And later, we're going to have our

[12:38] seminar where Steve and I and Mark are going to speak a little bit and laugh and joke

[12:42] around. We're going to feed everybody with pizza. Then we have cannolis coming.

[12:47] And then today is Mike D'odna's birthday for Automated Services. So we've got a

[12:52] couple of people coming from Mike. We're all going to sing him a happy birthday.

[12:55] Oh, and throw in a couple of martinis while you're at it.

[12:57] I think I saw something you were signing for him. So that was very, very nice.

[13:00] It was a big birthday card. Like 100 people, more than 100 people were signing the card.

[13:04] It was great.

[13:05] Okay. I'm going to ask Steve, because he's maybe made one or two games himself.

[13:10] That Godfather game that Jack's talking about, that is such a great game.

[13:15] Your thoughts on Godfather, Steve?

[13:17] It's pretty fun. I like playing it. It's a nice game that stays true to the movies.

[13:26] It's a team and all that. It's fun to play.

[13:36] It is my favorite Jersey Jack game. I've said that to other people.

[13:41] And it's not like the others I didn't like. I've liked them all.

[13:45] But this one is just, there's something special about it.

[13:48] You don't like them anyway. You don't have to say that.

[13:50] And I appreciate you saying that. It's one of my favorites too.

[13:56] Godfather is a theme. I was working on that license about four years ago, I started.

[14:04] It was great. Paramount was great support. Eric and his team did a great job on it.

[14:10] It's just a lot of fun.

[14:11] And what it's done, I've noticed, I thought it would happen, but it is happening.

[14:15] A lot of people that never bought a pinball machine heard that there's a Godfather pinball machine and they bought Godfather.

[14:23] And it got them into pinball.

[14:33] And I've gone to customers' homes when I heard games were going to be set up.

[14:37] I brought cannolis.

[14:40] And set up, played the game with them and surprised them.

[14:43] And it's really a lot of fun. It's really a lot of fun.

[14:46] You know, it's a family game, just like we did Toy Story as a family theme.

[14:49] Godfather is a different family, that's all.

[14:52] A little different for sure, but you're right.

[14:54] When you can strike gold with a theme, and the Godfather, you're talking about, look at any list.

[15:01] Top five movies of all time.

[15:03] And just how it changed movie making.

[15:05] And you've got it all in the game.

[15:07] The theme is near and dear to my heart, too.

[15:10] And Steve, I know theme means a lot to you, so...

[15:20] When you come to a company like Jersey Jack, and we're so excited to see your game coming out, the theme is...

[15:26] Rock and Man, Burning out a few dark hair with arms

[15:31] Really, really important.

[15:33] It's everything. You know that. I mean, I have to love what I'm working on.

[15:36] I couldn't think of a more horrible job if I wanted to.

[15:39] And you have to do it. You have to. Or I'll fire you. Do you understand?

[15:44] Oh, I just, you know, when you love what you're working on, and passion comes through, it's like...

[15:50] I don't know, something special happens to me, where everything just has to be right. That's it.

[15:55] Have you had, in your past, and a vast past at that, have you had themes come across your table and just said,

[16:01] That's not for me?

[16:03] I don't know.

[16:20] Many. I didn't want a two-world poker tour. I'll tell you that, but...

[16:25] I don't think we should do this here.

[16:28] There's a good reason why we haven't done any poker games in 30 years. People don't care about it.

[16:35] We ended up selling 1700, and it was a let down.

[16:39] But again, so theme is something important. I know you're excited about the next theme.

[16:43] We're not going to talk about that.

[16:55] I remember when I was young, me and silly had no mother phone,

[17:03] Pulling hand and then skimming's gone,

[17:07] And I thought I'd go somewhere else, and I'd mess with my own, like a big skimmer.

[17:11] I see the smile on your face. I know this is audio. I know you're looking forward to that.

[17:15] You've had different themes, whether it be movies, whether it be pop culture, whether it be music.

[17:21] Is there one that you prefer the best, and I know you've got a music background?

[17:24] I like mixing them up. I always have. A good band can make a great game.

[17:40] I like that. A music game or a movie game. It doesn't make any difference.

[17:46] As long as it has the power, as long as I feel like, okay, I can make a great game with this material.

[17:51] You know, that's what's exciting about Steve being at Jersey Jack.

[17:55] You know that he's going to be given all the toys, and this is a man who loves toys.

[17:59] Jack, we're excited for that.

[18:01] Well, we let him loose, and he made something that, and I don't know if he used them to do all that stuff,

[18:08] but I will, he made a really great game.

[18:11] I think a lot of people will say, Steve Ritchie is back, really.

[18:15] To me, it shoots amazingly. It's very fast. I just love it.

[18:21] I would have to say that if I didn't, but it's better that I do love it, for real.

[18:26] And what you said about theme is good. We used to joke around.

[18:29] It's like having a vegan chef in a steakhouse.

[18:32] He's probably not going to cook meals that are too good.

[18:38] So you got to get him to like, and the team, the whole team has to be involved with what the theme of the game is.

[18:46] You've got a great team at Jersey Jack. It's, I don't want to say new for you.

[18:50] You've been there for almost a couple of years now. What's it like working with these guys?

[18:54] It's so much better than anywhere else I've ever worked.

[18:57] Get out the way, get out the way, bitch. Get out the way.

[19:01] You don't take things out of my game, okay? My game is complete. It's all there.

[19:05] It makes me very happy. Just to be able to do everything that we want to do, that we need to do when I look at a game design, I think.

[19:12] How much money is it going to make? What can I do to make it make more money?

[19:15] What can I do to make you wish on this game? I mean, I think about all those things all the time.

[19:21] This game checks all the boxes. No question.

[19:24] You say that with a wink in your eye, and I know the last game we saw for me was Led Zeppelin, my favorite band.

[19:30] And you love the band too.

[19:31] I do.

[19:32] Things got taken out of that.

[19:33] They definitely got taken out. It's like, the biggest, biggest heartbreaker and the stupidest move is to remove Starway to Heaven.

[19:42] I was a little drunk.

[19:43] How can you have a Zeppelin game without Starway to Heaven? They wouldn't do it.

[19:47] Wouldn't do it. That's too bad.

[19:49] What do you say we cut the chit chat a-hole?

[19:52] That's not going to be the case for sure when we see the new one from Jersey Jack.

[19:57] This has been a big year for you. We mentioned Godfather, the location, the hirings.

[20:04] I have a feeling, you know, with a few more months left in the calendar, we're not done yet, are we, Jack?

[20:08] Well, maybe not. You never say never, you know. We like to keep our options open.

[20:14] And we'll have to see what the next few months have.

[20:19] Another wink in the eye. This audio. People don't see these winks here, but it's exciting because Jersey Jack has really just

[20:26] stepped it up. It was Black Knight that got me into pinball. It was just, I love the flow of it, the magnets, everything.

[20:33] I still like the game to this day. I call three of them, in fact.

[20:38] And that's why I'm excited to see what's coming from you with Jersey Jack.

[20:43] Well, one cool thing is that at Jersey Jack, they never did set up anything like, you have to do this or this or this or this.

[20:49] They never said that to me.

[20:51] But don't you see? That's what she was there for. That was the plan to give you a boner. And you got one.

[20:58] No one ever said it to me. So it's like, I did what I could. And it turned out that, we're not done, but we're getting there.

[21:06] It turned out that it was a very special crew. Maybe one of the, I do want to say this, okay, the best software team I ever worked with.

[21:18] Yeah. Three guys. What's so cool about them is they're constantly communicating.

[21:23] I'm going to have you fired.

[21:25] There's no ego thing. It's just, we have to make this great game. What do you think? Okay, we're going to get together, make the rules, set it up, check it out.

[21:33] If it's fun, we keep it. If it's not, we improve it. Okay, so things just go like that.

[21:38] So the mechanical engineering department at Jersey Jack became much stronger recently.

[21:45] And so all these things make it possible for us to build special machines, new things, and new devices.

[21:52] I can see the excitement you have for your upcoming game. Recent hire at Jersey Jack. Tell us about Tom Capara.

[21:58] Oh, sure. Yes, absolutely.

[22:00] Well, Tom's a great guy. He's an industry veteran. And that's what we need. We need pinball people to build pinball machines.

[22:06] I know that sounds silly, but I personally don't believe in bringing in people from outside the industry.

[22:16] Veteran people from other industries to try to bolster what we do.

[22:22] Ladies and gentlemen, gamers, pinheads, everyone watching live on Twitch. Welcome to the Jersey Jack Pinball Reveal.

[22:31] I'm Brett Abbas. I'm thrilled to be here today with my team to present our newest invention.

[22:40] We need people that already know what they're doing.

[22:45] Yes, we can train people on the job kind of thing, certainly. Right? But we need people that know the difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[22:54] We need people that know the difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[22:59] The difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[23:02] The difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[23:06] The difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[23:09] Hello, my name's Chris Bloerboom. And with this short video clip, what I want to do is talk about growth staging corn,

[23:19] especially how it relates to herbicide and herbicide applications,

[23:25] and ultimately the top safety of how we do a corn.

[23:31] We've got to water the cornfield.

[23:33] Yeah, don't water the cornfield.

[23:35] Well, I didn't talk about you, Steve. I figured you might know the difference between a cornfield and a play field.

[23:42] The cornfield has corn in it that tastes good.

[23:46] You know, the scarecrow was in the cornfield.

[23:48] That's right.

[23:49] And the scarecrow was on the play field.

[23:51] Yeah.

[23:52] So there was a cornfield on the play field if you want to trigger it.

[23:55] I don't know what game that was.

[23:56] Was it a VOD?

[23:57] Okay, well, sorry.

[23:59] I thought the cornfield might have been on, like, walking dead.

[24:04] I remember seeing a cornfield scene, it's known out.

[24:08] I can't thank you enough, Steve, for giving so much to Pinball, for making me a fan for life.

[24:12] Sure you can.

[24:13] You know what? Even poured me a drink here.

[24:15] I've got a rum and coke too. Thank you. Cheers, my friend. Cheers.

[24:18] This is $23 with my copay, right?

[24:22] Thanks for that.

[24:23] We sell everything nobody needs. I've said that for many, many years.

[24:26] It's kind of a funny thing to say.

[24:29] We're trying to bring more smiles to people and make people happy and forget the troubles.

[24:34] Willy Wonka is a great thing. Toy Story.

[24:36] I talk to every operator, and if they have a Toy Story, it's like, yeah, that's my number one.

[24:42] Toy Story is number one game on location.

[24:45] It's funny to go back a little bit, but I was just amazed, being in the industry, as long as I have, that

[24:51] no other manufacturer of any other piece of equipment, any kind of route game or FEC kind of game,

[24:59] went to Disney and licensed Toy Story for, you know, a video game or some other, you know, type of game.

[25:05] From Disney Interactive, Toy Story, the video game.

[25:11] And that was the first and only, apparently, you know, it's a great, great, great license.

[25:19] Toy Story is a fun game, no doubt, and it's like, I don't know, I can't think of a place where they would say,

[25:25] oh, we don't want that.

[25:27] Yeah, it's a game that opens doors, really.

[25:31] But it's not my kind of theme.

[25:35] No, but you can appreciate it from an operator's point of view.

[25:38] If you own an arcade, you want that.

[25:39] I appreciate every good pinball I've ever seen, and now it's like, I have to give it credit.

[25:48] And that's one thing about Jersey Jack games, I'm sure, with your game, you talked about the software engineering,

[25:53] is these are great games for location.

[25:57] Jeff, I was thinking, as you were talking about operators, certainly I was an operator many, many years.

[26:01] And one thing I learned early was, it didn't matter what the game cost.

[26:05] They'll pass over the money without even thinking about it.

[26:08] But as money they have, in peace they're like.

[26:13] I know a lot of operators, they're afraid to spend more than a certain amount of money.

[26:18] They think they're not going to get it back.

[26:20] But if you buy our games, not only do you get it back in the cash box with a bill except or a card swipe,

[26:27] you get it back in the residual if you want to sell that game years later.

[26:31] Even with inflation and the economy and everything, some things have come down, certainly great.

[26:38] It's not the go-go time during COVID.

[26:40] They still, I wouldn't guarantee it, but I tell you what, go find the Wizard of Oz.

[26:47] Go find the Pirates of the Caribbean.

[26:50] Go find the Willy Wonka game.

[26:53] You don't find these games.

[27:01] We bill like 5,000 guns and roses, you know.

[27:05] So, yeah, are you going to see a couple of used ones here and there?

[27:09] But they're still going for really good money.

[27:12] It's something to be really proud of.

[27:14] The whole company and the whole team in a way, we designed something.

[27:18] It's designed for the future.

[27:21] And those games won't fall apart, I tell you that.

[27:31] Go lift up one of the Godfather games and see what that game is built like.

[27:37] Compare it to any other game in the market.

[27:40] Put it side by side, go through it, open it up.

[27:43] You know where the money is, the money is in that machine.

[27:47] That's where it is, it's in the machine.

[27:50] And if you're lucky, you might find a cannoli in there.

[27:53] I hope it's fresh and refrigerated.

[27:56] You might have to put a refrigerator in the next Godfather games.

[28:00] Jack, Steve, I know you guys are busy at Pentastic.

[28:02] In fact, I have to go play Guns N' Roses right now in the playoffs.

[28:05] Thank you very much, gentlemen.

[28:06] It means a lot to me.

[28:07] Thank you, gentlemen.

[28:08] This has been your Pinball Profile.

[28:09] You can find everything on pinballprofile.com.

[28:11] I'm Jeff Chihlitz.

[28:20] This is going to be the worst thing in a while.

[28:22] The bells of love will make me believe until we die.

[28:30] On the ground tonight, we're bound to take our day.

[28:35] There's a bad mood on the right.
