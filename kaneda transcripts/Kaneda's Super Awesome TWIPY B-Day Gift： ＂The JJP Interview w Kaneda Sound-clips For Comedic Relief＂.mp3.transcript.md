[00:00] My life is yours, and I'll be gone.

[00:07] It's time for another Pinball Profile.

[00:09] I'm your host, Jeff Siles.

[00:10] You can find everything on PinballProfile.com,

[00:14] all our past episodes, subscriptions, and more.

[00:16] We're on Twitter, slash acts, we're on Instagram.

[00:19] At PinballProfile, we've got a great Facebook group as well.

[00:22] You can email PinballProfile at Gmail.com.

[00:25] And if you'd like to show your support on Patreon,

[00:27] boy, that would be very, very kind.

[00:28] Before I started drinking, I could not do that.

[00:31] You can do so.

[00:32] Patreon.com slash PinballProfile.

[00:34] Thanks to great people like Jimmy Law and Lua W. Rodney

[00:37] see so many others.

[00:38] Ah!

[00:39] I can't thank you enough for your continued support.

[00:42] This was recorded a week ago with a couple of very special guests.

[00:47] OK, this is a special treat for me here at Pintastic.

[00:50] I am in the luxury suite of one Stephen Richley, who's

[00:55] here with Jersey Jack and Jersey Jacks here.

[00:57] I'm so hasty.

[00:57] How about you?

[00:58] Ah, do a great, Jeff.

[01:01] Fun show.

[01:01] It's a great show.

[01:02] A lot of new games to play.

[01:06] I don't know.

[01:07] I'll write the papers.

[01:08] Very different.

[01:09] It's good.

[01:10] I've seen you at Pintastic before.

[01:11] The old location, I know this is a place that's very important to you too, Jack.

[01:15] I love it.

[01:16] OK.

[01:17] And his buddy started it years ago.

[01:18] I was at the first one, and I wouldn't miss it for anything.

[01:21] It's great.

[01:22] That was the plan to give you a bowler.

[01:25] Can you get one?

[01:27] The last one I was at, and again, old location, that was when Willy Wonka came out.

[01:32] And you had the kids there and stuff, and obviously now it all growing up.

[01:36] But that was a huge success for Jersey Jack for Willy Wonka.

[01:39] It was great.

[01:40] That was really great fun.

[01:41] We had the Wonka kids.

[01:42] And as you said, they're growing up, and everybody got a kick out of it.

[01:46] They signed the autographs and took a lot of pictures.

[01:48] It was fun.

[01:49] But every show was fun.

[01:50] You know, with the Godfather now, it's really some reaction to it.

[01:55] Just a minute later, we're going to have our seminal, our Steve and I, and Mark are

[02:00] going to speak a little bit, and laugh and joke around.

[02:02] They're not going to feed everybody with pizza.

[02:05] Then we have Kenoli's coming.

[02:07] Oh.

[02:08] And then today is Mike the Dones birthday from automated services.

[02:11] So we got a birthday cake coming from Mike.

[02:13] We're all going to sing them happy birthday.

[02:14] Oh, and throw in a couple of martinis while you're at it.

[02:17] I think I saw something you were signing for him.

[02:19] So that was very, very nice.

[02:20] You see, birthday card, like 100 people, more than 100 people are signing the card.

[02:24] That was great.

[02:25] OK, I'm going to ask Steve because he's maybe made one or two games himself.

[02:31] That Godfather game that Jack's talking about, that is such a great game.

[02:35] Your thoughts on Godfather Steve?

[02:36] It's pretty fun.

[02:37] I like playing it.

[02:39] It's a nice game to stay true to the movies.

[02:44] It's a theme and all that.

[02:48] I don't know, fun to play.

[02:52] It is my favorite Jersey Jack game.

[02:59] I've said that to other people.

[03:02] And it's not like the others I didn't like.

[03:04] I've liked them all.

[03:06] But this one is just something special about it.

[03:08] Anyway, you don't have to say that.

[03:11] And I appreciate you saying that.

[03:14] It's one of my favorites too.

[03:17] Godfather is a theme.

[03:19] I was working on that license for about four years ago, I thought it.

[03:25] It was great.

[03:26] Paramount was great support.

[03:28] Eric and his team did a great job on it.

[03:30] It's just a lot of fun.

[03:32] And what it's done, I've noticed, I thought it would happen, but it is happening.

[03:36] A lot of people that never bought a pinball machine heard that there's a Godfather pinball

[03:41] machine and they bought Godfather.

[03:44] And it got them into pinball.

[03:49] And I've gone to customers homes when I heard games are going to be set up.

[03:58] I brought canollies.

[03:59] I've set up, played the game with them and surprised them.

[04:03] And it's really a lot of fun.

[04:05] It's really a lot of fun.

[04:06] It's a family game.

[04:08] Just like we did Toy Story's a family theme.

[04:10] Godfather is a different family.

[04:12] That's all.

[04:13] A little different for sure.

[04:14] But you're right.

[04:15] When you can strike gold with a theme and the Godfather, you're talking about, look at

[04:20] any list.

[04:21] Top five movies of all time and just how it changed movie making and you've got it all

[04:27] in the game.

[04:28] The theme is near and dear to my heart too.

[04:31] And Steve, I know theme means a lot to you.

[04:34] So when you come to a company like Jersey Jack and we're so excited to see your game

[04:45] coming out, the theme is really, really important.

[04:54] It's everything.

[04:55] You know that.

[04:56] I mean, I have to love what I'm working on.

[04:57] I couldn't think of a more horrible job if I wanted to.

[05:00] And you have to do it.

[05:02] You have to.

[05:03] Or I'll fire you.

[05:04] Do you understand?

[05:05] Oh, I did.

[05:06] You know, when you love what you're working on and passion comes through, it's like,

[05:10] I don't know, something special happens to me or everything just has to be right.

[05:15] That's it.

[05:16] Have you had in your past and a vast past at that?

[05:20] Have you had themes come across your table and just said, that's not for me.

[05:26] I didn't want to see the world poker tour.

[05:43] I'll tell you that.

[05:45] I don't think we should do this here.

[05:49] There's a good reason why we haven't done any poker games in 30 years.

[05:53] People don't care about it.

[05:55] I'm only going to be an upselling 1700 and I want to sell that down.

[06:00] But again, so theme is something important.

[06:02] I know you're excited about the next theme.

[06:04] We're not going to talk about that.

[06:06] I know you're looking forward to that.

[06:31] I see the smile on your face.

[06:33] I know this is audio.

[06:34] I know you're looking forward to that.

[06:36] You've had different themes, whether it be movies, whether it be pop culture, whether

[06:40] it be music.

[06:41] Is there one that you prefer the best?

[06:43] And I know you've got a music background.

[06:44] I like mixing them up.

[06:45] I always have.

[06:46] I don't, you know, a good fan can make a great game.

[06:52] You know, like that, I'm a music game or a movie game.

[07:04] It doesn't make any difference as long as it has the power.

[07:07] As long as I feel like, OK, I can make a great game with this material.

[07:12] You know, that's what's exciting about Steve being at Jersey Jack.

[07:15] You know that he's going to be given all the toys.

[07:18] And this is a man who loves toys.

[07:19] Jack, we're excited for him.

[07:20] Well, we let him loose.

[07:22] And he made something that, you know, I know he's using through all that stuff, but I

[07:28] will.

[07:29] He made a really great game.

[07:31] And I think a lot of people will say Steve Richie is bad at the real.

[07:35] To me, it shoots amazingly.

[07:38] It's very fast.

[07:40] I just love it.

[07:41] You know, I would have to say that if I didn't, but it's better that I do love it for

[07:45] real.

[07:46] And what you said about theme is good.

[07:48] You know, we used to joke around.

[07:49] It's like having a vegan chef in a steakhouse.

[07:54] Probably not going to make, it's probably not going to cut meals at a particular time.

[07:59] So you got to get him to like, and the team, the whole team has to be involved with what

[08:04] the theme of the game is.

[08:06] You've got a great team at Jersey Jack.

[08:08] It's, I don't want to say new for you.

[08:10] You've been there for almost a couple of years now.

[08:12] What's it like working with these guys?

[08:14] It's so much better than anywhere else I've ever worked.

[08:19] They don't take things out of my game.

[08:22] Okay, my game is complete.

[08:24] It's all there.

[08:25] That makes me very happy.

[08:26] You know, just to be able to do everything that we want to do, that we need to do when

[08:30] I look at a game, design, I think, how much money is it going to make?

[08:33] What can I do to make it more money?

[08:35] What can I do to make you wish on this game?

[08:38] I mean, I think about all those things all the time.

[08:40] And this game checks all the boxes.

[08:44] There's no question.

[08:45] You say that with a wink in your eye and I know the last game we saw from you was Led

[08:48] Zeppelin, my favorite band and you love the band too.

[08:52] Things got taken out a lot.

[08:53] The guy they definitely got taken out.

[08:55] It's like the biggest, biggest heartbreaker and the stupidest move is to remove stairway

[09:02] to heaven.

[09:03] I was a little drunk.

[09:04] How can you have a Zeppelin game without stairway to heaven?

[09:06] They wouldn't do it.

[09:07] Wouldn't do it.

[09:08] It's too bad.

[09:09] What do you see?

[09:10] We cut the chit chat a hole.

[09:13] That's not going to be the case for sure when we see the new one from Jersey Jack.

[09:18] This has been a big year if you mentioned Godfather.

[09:22] The location, the hiring.

[09:24] I have a feeling, you know, with a few more months left in the calendar, we're not done

[09:27] yet, are we Jack?

[09:28] Well, maybe not.

[09:29] You never say never, you know.

[09:32] We like to keep our options open.

[09:36] And we'll have to see what the next few months have.

[09:40] Another wink in the eye.

[09:41] People don't see these wings here, but it's exciting because Jersey Jack is really just

[09:46] stepped it up.

[09:48] It was black night that got me into pinball.

[09:50] It was just a love the flow of it, the magnets, everything.

[09:53] I still like the game to this day.

[09:55] I call three of them, in fact.

[09:59] And that's why I'm excited to see what's coming from you with Jersey Jack.

[10:03] Well, one cool thing is that at Jersey Jack, they never did set up anything like you

[10:08] have to do this or this or this or this.

[10:10] They never said that to me.

[10:11] But don't you see?

[10:12] That's what she was there for.

[10:13] That was the plan to give you a boner.

[10:15] And you got one.

[10:16] No one ever said it to me.

[10:19] So it's like, I did what I could.

[10:22] It turned out that we're not done, but we're getting there.

[10:26] It turned out that it was a very special crew.

[10:30] Maybe one of the, I do want to say this, okay, the best software team I ever worked with.

[10:37] Yeah.

[10:38] Three guys.

[10:39] What's so cool about them is they're constantly communicating.

[10:43] I'm going to have you fired.

[10:45] There's no eco thing.

[10:47] It's just we have to make this great game.

[10:49] When you think, hey, we're going to get together and make the rules.

[10:52] So I would up check it out if it's fun.

[10:53] We keep it if it's not, we improve it.

[10:55] Okay.

[10:56] So things just go like that.

[10:58] Also, the mechanical engineering department at Jersey Jack became much stronger recently.

[11:05] And so all these things make it possible for us to build special machines, new things,

[11:11] new devices.

[11:13] I can see the excitement you have for your upcoming game.

[11:15] Recent hire at Jersey Jack.

[11:17] Tell us about Tom Capaira.

[11:19] Oh, sure.

[11:20] Yes, absolutely.

[11:21] Well, Tom's a great guy.

[11:22] He's an industry veteran.

[11:24] And that's what we need.

[11:25] We need pinball people to build pinball machines.

[11:26] I know that sounds silly.

[11:29] But I personally don't believe in bringing in people from outside the industry.

[11:37] Veteran people from other industries to try to bolster what we do.

[11:43] Ladies and gentlemen, gamers, pinheads, everyone watching live on Twitch.

[11:48] Welcome to the Jersey Jack pinball reveal.

[11:51] I'm Brett Abbas.

[11:53] I'm thrilled to be here today with my team to present our newest invention.

[12:01] We need people that already know what they're doing.

[12:06] Yes, we can train people on the job kind of thing, certainly.

[12:10] But we need people that know the difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[12:15] We need people that know the difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[12:20] The difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[12:23] The difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[12:27] The difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[12:30] Hello, my name is Chris Borbom.

[12:32] And with this short video clip, what I want to do is talk about growth staging corn,

[12:40] especially how it relates to herbicide and herbicide applications.

[12:46] And ultimately the cop tapers power the corn.

[12:50] You got a water in the cornfield.

[12:54] Yeah, don't water the cornfield.

[12:55] Well, I didn't talk about you Steve.

[12:56] I figured you might know the difference between a cornfield and a playfield.

[13:02] The cornfield has a corner at that tastes good.

[13:05] You know, the scarecrow is in the cornfield.

[13:08] That's right.

[13:09] And the scarecrow was on the playfield.

[13:11] Yeah.

[13:12] So there was a cornfield on the playfield.

[13:14] I don't know what came that was.

[13:17] Was it a vibe?

[13:18] OK, sorry.

[13:20] I thought the cornfield might have been on like a walking dead.

[13:24] I remember saying cornfield scene.

[13:27] It's known out.

[13:28] I can't thank you enough Steve for giving so much to pinball for making me a fan for life.

[13:33] I even poured me a drink here.

[13:36] I've got a rum and coke too.

[13:37] Thank you, cheers, my friend.

[13:38] Cheers.

[13:39] This is a toy three dogs with my co-pay, right?

[13:43] Thanks for that.

[13:44] I don't sell everything nobody needs.

[13:45] I've said that for many, many years.

[13:46] It's kind of a funny thing to say.

[13:50] We're trying to bring more smiles to people and make people happy and forget the troubles.

[13:55] Willie Wonka is a great thing.

[13:56] Toy Story.

[13:57] I talk to every operator.

[13:59] And if they have a toy story, it's like, yeah, that's my number one error.

[14:03] Toy Story is number one game on location.

[14:06] It's funny to go back a little bit.

[14:07] But I was just amazed being in the industry as long as I have that.

[14:11] No other manufacturer of any other piece of equipment, any kind of route game or FEC kind

[14:18] of game went to Disney and licensed Toy Story for a video game or some other type of game.

[14:25] Problem Disney Interactive.

[14:28] Toy Story.

[14:29] The video game.

[14:30] And that was the first thing.

[14:33] Only, apparently.

[14:35] It's a great, great, great license.

[14:39] Toy Story is a fun game.

[14:40] You know it out and it's like, I don't know.

[14:43] I can't think of a place where they would say, we don't want that.

[14:46] Yeah, it's a game that opens doors, really.

[14:50] But it's not my kind of theme.

[14:53] No, but you can appreciate it from my operator.

[14:57] If you own an arcade, you want that.

[14:59] I appreciate every good pinball I've ever seen.

[15:01] And it's like, I have to give it credit.

[15:09] And that's one thing about Jersey Jack Games.

[15:11] I'm sure with your game you talked about the software engineering is these are great

[15:14] games for location.

[15:16] Jeff, I was thinking as you were talking about operator, certainly I was an operator many,

[15:21] many years.

[15:22] And one thing I learned early was it didn't matter what the game cost.

[15:25] It'll pass over the money without even thinking about it.

[15:28] But as money they have, the piece they like.

[15:33] I know a lot of operators, they're afraid to spend more than a certain amount of money.

[15:39] They think they're not going to get it back.

[15:41] But if you buy our games, not only do you get it back in the cash box that Bill accept

[15:46] or are a quad swipe, you get it back in the residual if you want to sell that game years

[15:50] later.

[15:51] It's not going to lose money.

[15:53] Even with inflation and economy and everything, some things have come down certainly great.

[15:58] It's not the go-go time during COVID.

[16:01] They still, I wouldn't guarantee it, but I tell you what, go find a Wizard of Oz.

[16:08] Go find a pirate so the Caribbean.

[16:10] Go find a Willy Wonka game.

[16:13] You don't find these games here.

[16:17] We bought like 5,000 guns and roses.

[16:25] So yeah, are you going to see a couple of used ones here tonight?

[16:30] They're still going for really good money.

[16:33] It's something to be really proud of.

[16:34] The whole company and the whole team in the way we design something.

[16:38] It's designed for the future.

[16:40] Those games won't fall upon it.

[16:42] I tell you that.

[16:53] Go list up one of the Godfather games and see what that game is built like.

[16:58] I don't know if there's any other game in the market.

[17:01] Put it side by side.

[17:02] Go through it.

[17:03] Open it up.

[17:04] You know where the money is.

[17:05] The money is in that machine.

[17:08] That's where it is.

[17:09] It's in the machine.

[17:10] And if you're lucky, you might find a canolean there.

[17:12] I hope it's fresh and refreshing.

[17:15] I might have to put a refrigerator in the next Godfather games.

[17:20] Jack Steve, I know you guys are busy at Fantastic.

[17:22] In fact, I have to go play guns and roses right now in the playoffs.

[17:26] Thank you very much, gentlemen.

[17:27] It means a lot to me.

[17:28] Thank you, gentlemen.

[17:29] This has been your pinball profile.

[17:30] You can find everything on pinballpofe.com and Jeff Teales.

[17:35] This is going to be the worst thing I've ever done.
