[00:00] Oh, welcome everybody to the sixth time Twippy Award-winning favorite BimBall podcast.

[00:27] Happy Sunday everybody!

[00:29] Is heaven gonna be a place on PimBall Earth, the remainder of 2023?

[00:34] You know, I actually had to make a list of how many PimBall companies are in the world

[00:38] right now.

[00:39] Are you ready for it?

[00:40] Stern, Jersey Jack PimBall, Chicago Gaming Company, Spooky PimBall, American PimBall,

[00:45] Dutch PimBall, PimBall Brothers, Haggis, Multimorphic, Home Pin, PimBall Adventures, and I guess

[00:52] we'll count Turner PimBall.

[00:53] Now there are four months left in the year.

[00:56] Do we think anything major is gonna happen between now and the end of the year?

[01:01] We've got PimBall Expo in October, but four more months to go.

[01:06] And what I want to do on this episode of Canada's PimBall Podcast is I just want to go down

[01:10] the list of companies.

[01:11] And I want us to ask ourselves, are we gonna see anything else from these PimBall companies?

[01:15] Now before I go over these like 10 or 11 companies, I want to say something right now.

[01:20] I was talking to someone who's working at that mystery PimBall company.

[01:24] It is coming and it is coming this year.

[01:27] They are just waiting on a few parts because I was talking to the person and I said to

[01:31] them, look, it's not a bad time to release something new in the PimBall world and we're

[01:36] gonna see it when we go over all these companies.

[01:39] Not much is happening.

[01:40] Venom is dead on arrival.

[01:42] The other games over at Jersey Jack and what American PimBall, they're not selling very

[01:47] well.

[01:48] So if there ever was an ideal moment to march into PimBall Expo, if there ever was an ideal

[01:53] fall to come out with a new game, I think now is the time because everyone is holding

[01:58] on to their money until they see Keith Elwin's next game.

[02:02] We're gonna talk about that when we go over all the companies.

[02:04] But that mystery game is coming, which makes it really exciting.

[02:08] They have kept this thing a tight-lipped operation.

[02:11] Nobody has broken their NDAs.

[02:13] Nobody has leaked stuff to Canada.

[02:15] But as I was talking to this company, I was like, look, I told them, I'm like, let me help

[02:18] you hype this thing up a little bit.

[02:19] So we'll see if they give me any information moving forward.

[02:22] All right.

[02:23] So four months to go.

[02:25] We've got September, October, November, December.

[02:28] That means four more months of tippy eligibility.

[02:31] Right now it is looking like Foo Fighters is going to be the runaway game of the year.

[02:36] Obviously, I will cover what I think is going to win in the award shows this season, but

[02:40] it's way too early.

[02:41] So four months to go.

[02:42] Let's start at the top with Stern PimBall.

[02:44] What is Stern PimBall have in store?

[02:46] Well, they kind of surprised us, didn't really surprise us because I was telling you Jurassic

[02:51] Park anniversary edition was going to come out and it came out.

[02:54] We saw that logo on a translate like a couple months ago.

[02:58] So Stern PimBall is moving into a new factory.

[03:00] I hear there are some delays moving into the factory.

[03:03] I'm not sure how many delays there are.

[03:06] Jurassic Park 30th anniversary for $13,000.

[03:10] It's not sold out.

[03:12] It is what it is.

[03:13] If you've been dying to get your hands on a Jurassic Park over the last four years, now

[03:17] you can go get this machine.

[03:18] I think everyone kind of sees through this Jurassic Park.

[03:21] It's just the premium with different armor and decals because the premiums were on the

[03:26] line.

[03:27] They really only had to order like a new translate, a new apron and new armor.

[03:32] And all of a sudden this game that used to cost us $7,500 is now freaking $13,000.

[03:38] And I think a lot of people are seeing through it.

[03:41] And that's why people are not running towards this JP 30th anniversary edition.

[03:45] It's not a real, I don't know.

[03:47] They're just something that rubs everybody the wrong way.

[03:49] If you're going to charge this much for a game that used to cost so much less.

[03:53] So we just got that from Stern.

[03:55] Venom is just like seemingly like two years old.

[03:58] Doesn't it feel like Venom came out like two years ago?

[04:01] Nobody's really excited about it.

[04:04] I think some people out there that like Venom are starting a weird rumor that this

[04:08] game is going to go the same way as Stranger Things.

[04:11] It is not, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:13] Stranger Things is one of the most popular contemporary TV shows of all time.

[04:18] It's the second most popular Netflix show of all time.

[04:21] It was bumped out of first place by Wednesday.

[04:24] Do you really think there are that many Venom fans that want to plop down $13,000

[04:29] on an LE or 10,000 on a premium?

[04:32] There are not, ladies and gentlemen.

[04:34] And look, Stranger Things had a rough start because the code was not completed,

[04:37] but it still had a lot more interesting stuff going on in the game than Venom does.

[04:43] And the projector and the magnetic ball grab.

[04:45] It's Stranger Things.

[04:46] It had clips from the show that were synced up.

[04:48] It had the theme song from the show, and it has one of the coolest moments in

[04:52] modern pinball, which is the UV kit and going into the upside down.

[04:56] And remember, none of that was available, the upside down kit.

[04:59] None of that was available when the game first launched.

[05:02] And the other thing was this, when Stranger Things launched, there were only 500

[05:06] LEs and they were like 89.99 and they didn't sell out.

[05:10] And the games sat in boxes because it was before COVID and we all still had

[05:15] common sense, so we didn't run towards the game.

[05:18] So there is no way Venom at these prices with a theme that's not that popular

[05:22] with the pinball buying demographic.

[05:24] Venom is dead on arrival.

[05:26] And so Stern must know that because the Venom orders have not come in.

[05:30] Dealers and distros are screwed on Venom.

[05:32] If they ordered a big amount of Venoms so that they could secure themselves a

[05:37] large amount of Keith Elwyn's jaws is they're going to be sitting on those Venoms

[05:41] forever. And so now everyone who's looking at Stern is looking beyond Jurassic Park,

[05:46] beyond Venom, and it's going to be Keith Elwyn's jaws.

[05:49] Everybody is saving and waiting to see that game.

[05:52] And we have new information exclusively from Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[05:56] Not only did I tell you first, it's going to have the three yellow barrels,

[06:00] but it's also now going to have a shark fin that pops up from underneath the

[06:03] playfield and moves around the playfield.

[06:06] I can't wait to see this game.

[06:07] More and more details will surface as more and more people start to see the game

[06:12] as it gets closer to launch. It is going to be jaws people.

[06:16] There is not going to be a surprise back to the future announcement in November.

[06:20] That is not happening.

[06:21] And maybe we get something else from Stern pinball at the end of the year.

[06:24] The only thing I could see them doing is a vault edition game sometime in

[06:29] November, December, but they're not going to want to interrupt Keith Elwyn's

[06:33] launch. Keith Elwyn is the new king of pinball.

[06:36] Stern pinball knows that they invest the most in him.

[06:39] They give him the most resources.

[06:41] They give him a higher bomb because he delivers so much more than anybody else

[06:45] designing pinball these days.

[06:47] I fully expect Stern pinball to have a nice runway to Keith Elwyn's game and

[06:51] doesn't overcrowd it with something else.

[06:53] All right. So that's Stern pinball.

[06:55] Maybe a vault at the end of the year.

[06:56] If I were to guess what game they're going to vault,

[06:59] I think it is going to be Tron.

[07:01] I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I do think Tron is either coming or I think

[07:06] it's going to be Metallica.

[07:08] I think it's one of those two games, Tron or Metallica.

[07:11] All right. Jersey jack pinball.

[07:12] What is Jersey jack going to do now that Godfather sales are absolutely flat

[07:17] lined? We're seeing people open up their collectors editions.

[07:20] I don't think they're going to make all 1000 collectors editions.

[07:23] There's no way a thousand people on a lukewarm theme like this,

[07:28] after they witnessed everybody losing so much money on Toy Story 4,

[07:33] there is no way a thousand people went in and agreed to buy this game for

[07:37] $15,000.

[07:38] We are going to see a fire sale on every single Godfather machine between

[07:43] now and the end of the year.

[07:44] It's going to take them till November to finish the run of the collectors

[07:48] editions, and then there are no more orders for L.E.'s.

[07:51] People getting the C.E.'s are not going to be able to create a new demand for

[07:56] the L.E. of the game.

[07:57] And so that leads us to Steve Richie's Elton John,

[08:01] which I fully expect to see at the end of the year.

[08:04] I think Steve Richie's Elton John is the only pinball machine coming out between

[08:10] now and the end of the year that has the potential to bump jack

[08:15] dangerous foo fighters from game of the year.

[08:18] I don't think there's anything else major coming out other than that mystery game.

[08:22] Maybe that will do it,

[08:23] but it's going to be really hard to bump jack dangerous foo fighters simply

[08:27] because game of the year will be decided by popular vote and Stern has the

[08:33] distribution. Like more people will have owned and played foo fighters than

[08:37] will ever have owned and played freaking JJP games.

[08:41] But it doesn't mean JJP can't win game of the year.

[08:44] Remember we saw dialed in win game of the year.

[08:47] We saw guns and roses win game of the year.

[08:50] So Jersey jack seems to be able to win game of the year in any year where Keith

[08:55] Elwin does not have a game out in the world.

[08:58] So the door is still open for this game to be successful.

[09:01] I don't know anything about Elton John other than I think it's going to have

[09:04] Christopher Franci on artwork.

[09:06] I know that Steve Richie was given a blank check bomb to make this game.

[09:11] I know there was some internal fighting over there,

[09:13] but Jack Winari to get Steve Richie to come over said,

[09:16] you can put whatever you want into the game.

[09:18] And I think we're going to see a loaded game.

[09:20] I fully expect there to be a crocodile rock crocodile mechanism that eats the

[09:25] balls. And I think if they do it right,

[09:27] I think if they make this look like 1970s Elton John,

[09:31] I think it's going to be super cool to see this game with all those rainbow LEDs

[09:35] lighting up. I think it's the perfect game for the JJP light show.

[09:39] I think it's weird seeing that light show in the Godfather,

[09:42] but Jersey jack pinball needs a home run. They are down.

[09:46] It is the bottom of the ninth. This company's mojo is gone.

[09:51] They need a hit game. And look, I hope it's a hit game.

[09:54] Do I have faith in Steve Richie after the games he put out over at stern pinball?

[10:00] I'm just going to plead the Robert Mueller fifth.

[10:02] I don't want to self incriminate myself, everybody. All right.

[10:05] Let's go on to Chicago gaming company. So between now and the end of the year,

[10:09] we should see these pulp fictions on the line, not the LES,

[10:13] but the standard versions of the game.

[10:15] I don't like that decision. They should be making the LES first.

[10:19] I don't know why they would not make the LES first.

[10:22] It's the same exact game. Let me repeat that.

[10:25] It is the same exact game except for a mirror,

[10:29] translate and a topper. So why wouldn't you just make the LES games?

[10:34] Maybe the armor is a little bit nicer and the speaker grill is a little bit nicer,

[10:37] but for the most part, everything on the play field is the same exact thing,

[10:42] the cabinet, the same exact thing between the LE and the SE or the SE plus.

[10:48] So I think all these pinball companies need to learn a lesson.

[10:51] If you don't have a pro version of the game,

[10:54] if you just have two trims, you make the high end trim first.

[10:59] Don't make your most expensive buyers wait the longest.

[11:03] The people who buy first class, they get on the airplane first. Okay.

[11:07] So we're going to see that at the very end of the year.

[11:10] I don't think we're going to see many of them.

[11:12] And then we're supposed to get the LES sometime in February.

[11:16] I don't know though, because when it comes to CGC manufacturing games,

[11:20] the only word that comes to mind is delays, delays, delays,

[11:24] delays, nothing comes out when they say it's going to come out.

[11:28] So that is what we're going to see from CGC. Spooky pinball.

[11:31] We already know the answer. They are only halfway through the Scooby-Doo runs.

[11:36] So halfway through,

[11:37] which means we're going to be another full year of Scooby-Doo before they show

[11:42] the next game. Now, I think Spooky's plans will be simply this.

[11:45] I think they're going to move into their larger factory.

[11:48] I think they're going to be able to up their production a little bit quicker.

[11:51] And I think we're going to see their next game or two by the end of next year,

[11:56] but nothing by the end of this year.

[11:58] So it's a Scooby-Doo holiday for everybody over at Spooky Pinball.

[12:02] I got a nice note from Luke over there. I'm going to follow up with him.

[12:06] Yeah. And see, everyone doesn't hate Canada just because a few people want to

[12:10] complain about me. I think we're still doing really strong.

[12:13] And I'm really excited to do these shows for you guys and take the Facebook break.

[12:17] Don't worry, we're coming back. I got a great plan for when I come back.

[12:20] All right, let's go on. Spooky Pinball.

[12:22] Congratulations on all the successes. American Pinball.

[12:24] This is the company I'm worried about.

[12:27] I'm really worried about American Pinball.

[12:29] If there's any pinball company,

[12:31] if there's any two pinball companies where I worry about the doors closing on

[12:36] them, the two companies I'm most worried about are American Pinball and Haggis

[12:41] Pinball. I think American Pinball has made a lot of really boneheaded decisions.

[12:47] I don't understand why a company that has access to some really hard to get

[12:52] parts. Remember, it's like AIMtron makes the boards for this game.

[12:55] That is how this entire company came into existence.

[12:59] Do you know the backstory?

[13:00] Do people forget the backstory that the reason why American Pinball exists is

[13:05] because John Papadook ordered his boards from AIMtron.

[13:09] Like AIMtron was making the boards for Magic Girl.

[13:12] And that is why they let John Papadook go over there and tinker for another year

[13:17] and a half and try to get those broken Magic Girls out the door because they

[13:20] were just trying to recoup their investment.

[13:22] And Mukesh just made a pinball company just to give to people in his family

[13:26] because those kids clearly couldn't find other professions.

[13:29] That is the origins of American Pinball.

[13:32] And then they bring in David Fix and he goes around on this media tour for two

[13:36] years in which he tells us he's going to assemble the new American Pinball team

[13:40] and it's going to blow us away.

[13:42] They've got Dennis Nordman.

[13:43] They got Zofia Ryan from Overhead Valley Williams.

[13:45] And I just want to say this, like looking down at that game.

[13:49] Now, look, I don't really blame Zofia Ryan because Dennis Nordman designed

[13:52] that game before she ever became a part of the project.

[13:56] So I don't think her talents were really implemented into that game.

[14:00] I also, after all of these years in watching all of these Valley Williams

[14:04] engineers parade themselves around the last 10 or 15 years, it's quite obvious

[14:10] that Valley Williams had a team of engineers that made these designers look

[14:14] like rock stars. It's why we've never seen anything nearly as impressive

[14:18] mechanically on any modern games as we've seen on Valley Williams machines.

[14:23] It doesn't matter. Pat Lawler didn't have the talent to do it at JJP.

[14:27] John Papadou couldn't do it when he was on his own.

[14:30] Dennis Nordman, we haven't seen anything.

[14:32] Brian Eddy wears the medieval madness castle like mechanisms that we saw.

[14:36] He's not doing that over at Stern Pinball.

[14:38] Now he's got doppelgangers swinging out with three USB sticks hanging from his

[14:42] butt. So I just want to say this, the Valley Williams team at the heyday of

[14:46] Pinball in the mid nineties runs circles around anybody in this hobby right now

[14:52] on a mechanical engineering level.

[14:54] I mean, look at the mechanical engineering in Circus Voltaire, in Theater of

[14:58] Magic, in Tales of the Arabian Nights, in Adams Family, in Twilight Zone.

[15:03] And those games were like $3,000.

[15:05] And this is the problem is like nobody wants to like look back at those games.

[15:09] Look at what you used to get for the money.

[15:12] And even if you incorporate inflation people, you are around like seven or

[15:17] $8,000 for a game like that.

[15:19] If they made a game like that, now these companies would charge us $25,000.

[15:24] So American Pinball, Galactic Tank Force sales are done.

[15:28] They're never going to get sales back.

[15:31] They are trickling these games out.

[15:33] They have not even made a single signature edition.

[15:36] You know that $17,500 edition with the thermos.

[15:40] Those haven't even been made yet.

[15:42] So this company really needs to get to its next game.

[15:45] Its next game is going to be based on a video game and cartoon series.

[15:49] I think it's either going to be like Golden Axe or maybe Dungeons and Dragons.

[15:53] It's going to be something like that.

[15:55] It's Ryan McQuade's first game.

[15:57] Ryan McQuade used to be a friend of the show.

[15:59] And then just like everybody else, the moment they get close to that pinball son,

[16:04] they get really smug.

[16:06] They get anti-Canada and then all of a sudden they don't talk to me anymore.

[16:09] And it's cool.

[16:10] It's cool.

[16:11] It's really cool to just cold shoulder the guy that's got an audience that's

[16:15] larger than the total amount of games American Pinball has ever sold.

[16:18] Okay. Do you want me to repeat that?

[16:20] I have more people following Canadian Pinball Podcast than the total

[16:23] number of games American Pinball has ever sold.

[16:26] And yet let's treat him like he's some sort of black sheep.

[16:29] So look, I think there's nothing new coming out from AP this year.

[16:32] I think it's going to be a slow trickle of galactic tank forces making their way out.

[16:37] And I do think this company is in jeopardy.

[16:39] I think at any moment Mukesh could pull the plug on it.

[16:42] And the irony is this, if they pulled the plug on American Pinball and the company

[16:46] went away, then all of a sudden, right, those galactic tank forces would skyrocket in value.

[16:52] It doesn't matter if the game is great or not.

[16:54] It's a modern game where there weren't many made and only scarcity would make that

[16:58] game successful.

[16:59] And I mean it when I say it, if I was in charge of marketing over at American

[17:03] Pinball, I could have sold them a thousand of those games instantly.

[17:07] Here's what they did wrong.

[17:09] They should have said from the very beginning, we are only making a thousand.

[17:12] There's 250 tank additions and there's 750 regular additions.

[17:17] It's a quirky game.

[17:18] It's a weird game.

[17:19] You're never going to sell more than a thousand.

[17:21] And if they did that, there would have been a run on that title.

[17:24] Instead, they did the dumbest thing ever and they just made it feel like no

[17:28] version of the game was special.

[17:29] And the only version that felt really, really special was freaking ripping

[17:33] everybody off with 17,500 dollar price tag.

[17:36] And all of that was a marketing decision.

[17:38] And the way they rolled the game out with that horrible video, they should have

[17:42] given the game to Greg and Zach to do a straight down the middle like overview of

[17:45] the game.

[17:46] They did everything wrong and it just goes to show you if you launch a quirky,

[17:50] weird product in the wrong way, it will be dead on arrival.

[17:54] The same thing happened with dialed in.

[17:56] All right.

[17:56] So that's American pinball.

[17:57] Dutch pinball.

[17:58] They have nothing new.

[17:59] They are going to make the Lebowski's.

[18:01] They are getting the EA's their games.

[18:03] I've been talking to Barry.

[18:04] He's really excited about what's next, what's around the corner.

[18:08] I think it's the matrix.

[18:09] I think it's going to blow people away sometime.

[18:11] Maybe, maybe at the end of next year, but we've got a long way to go.

[18:16] But Barry's in a really good position.

[18:18] A company like his is exactly the kind of company that I would make.

[18:22] If I were advising someone, what kind of pinball company should we make?

[18:26] Make a very small run, high end boutique pinball company that actually puts

[18:32] magic into the game.

[18:34] That is what I would do.

[18:35] They're the only company that is making games that looks like a

[18:39] Balli Williams modern version of pinball.

[18:41] They are the only company right now.

[18:43] Jersey Jack started out that way and then they started removing everything

[18:47] from the game.

[18:48] If you lift up guns and roses, Toy Story and Godfather, they are empty

[18:52] compared to Wizard of Oz, Hobbit and Dialed in.

[18:55] They just are.

[18:56] Do me a favor, do it.

[18:57] Just lift up the hood on the first three Jersey Jack machines and put them

[19:01] next to the last three Jersey Jack machines.

[19:04] They went the direction of like artwork and lights and LCD screen and they took

[19:09] out the mechanical magic and it's not going to work for those prices.

[19:12] Barry is in the driver's seat.

[19:14] If he has the matrix and he does what I know he can do to a theme and he

[19:19] actually markets it the right way from day one, this guy's in the driver's seat.

[19:24] I think Dutch pinball has the potential to be the first pinball company to truly

[19:29] do what nobody has been able to do before.

[19:32] Be the Bugatti of pinball.

[19:34] Don't make apologies.

[19:35] Don't make excuses.

[19:37] There are enough super rich guys in this hobby that nobody is really catering to.

[19:42] Stern is laughing all the way to the bank because the only thing they're doing is

[19:46] putting different stickers on a machine and charging $4,000 more.

[19:49] And that's the only thing the rich guys can buy.

[19:52] But if Barry comes out of the gate and says we are just making a thousand

[19:56] matrix machines and they are $20,000 each, he will sell every single one.

[20:03] Trust me on this.

[20:05] Every single one.

[20:06] Because now that Sterns are 13,000 for a non scarce LE that everybody has the

[20:11] same game when they buy the premium.

[20:13] If you make only a thousand matrixes and they're 20 grand a pop, I'd rather have

[20:18] that than two Stern premiums.

[20:21] Think about it, people.

[20:22] One game that's truly limited, a grade A theme that is absolutely loaded with magic

[20:29] is definitely worth the price of two Stern premiums.

[20:33] The same way a Bugatti is worth the price of four or five Lamborghinis people.

[20:39] We need someone to have the guts it takes to go super high end in pinball.

[20:44] But the only way it works is if you make a freaking masterpiece.

[20:49] And I think if there's anybody out there that can make a freaking masterpiece

[20:52] and claim the title of high end pinball boutique, it's not Jersey Jack.

[20:57] It's Dutch pinball.

[20:58] Barry, get it done.

[20:59] Let's talk, brother.

[21:00] All right, pinball brothers, I hear they have a surprise title coming.

[21:03] I hear it's a big game coming.

[21:04] I hear pinball brothers is about to shock us in 2023.

[21:08] So I think this is one of the companies where we are going to see something new this year.

[21:13] I don't think we've seen everything yet.

[21:15] I think they are done with the Andrew Highway era of machines, which was

[21:19] Queen and Alien Pinball.

[21:21] I think this is what's going to happen.

[21:22] I think pinball brothers and Padready Gaming are going to announce a partnership

[21:28] with Planetary Pinball.

[21:30] And I think we're going to see the Twilight Zone or Big Bang Bar.

[21:34] It's going to be one of them.

[21:35] And I think that's what we're going to see at the end of this year.

[21:38] Now, look, you know, even though they made so many more Twilight Zones,

[21:41] Twilight Zone would be way more successful than Big Bang Bar.

[21:45] I'll tell you why.

[21:46] There's so many newbies in this hobby.

[21:48] There's so many newbie dudes that don't want to buy a 30 year old Twilight Zone.

[21:53] They just don't.

[21:54] They want to open up a box.

[21:55] These new guys to the hobby, they really value cardboard more than anything.

[22:00] So if I were making a decision between Big Bang Bar and Twilight Zone,

[22:04] I absolutely go Twilight Zone.

[22:06] It sounds like a nightmare to make one in modern times,

[22:09] but it's obviously the game that's iconic.

[22:11] Like when you look at the top pinball machines of all time, it's up there, isn't it?

[22:15] So, you know, that's what I think pinball brothers is going to do.

[22:18] So keep them on your short list of companies that could surprise us in 2023.

[22:24] All right.

[22:25] Now, after them is Haggis Pinball.

[22:27] Now, the only real question of Haggis and I've stopped ragging on them.

[22:30] The only thing I'll say is this.

[22:31] I think they're in jeopardy as well as American Pinball of closing its doors.

[22:35] I can't imagine they're doing super well financially.

[22:38] They didn't sell out of any of their Centaur editions.

[22:41] You know, I'm not surprised people saw what happened with Fathom.

[22:44] You know, Fathom is easy to get.

[22:46] If you just wait and see, you would have saved money on Fathom.

[22:49] You would not have had to have locked your money up for two years.

[22:52] And now you can march in and get a brand new Fathom for sticker price.

[22:56] And also Fathom is arguably the better game.

[22:59] It's just a huge red flag that they had to announce that game so early.

[23:03] Get all the pre-order dollars and why?

[23:06] If you were doing well financially and actually making profit on Fathom,

[23:10] you wouldn't have to do this.

[23:12] Now, what we're looking for this year is not a new game from them,

[23:15] because we already know what their next game is.

[23:17] What we are looking for is that Damien keeps his word.

[23:21] He said he's going to finish production of all the Fathoms by the end of this year.

[23:26] So let's see if he can accomplish that.

[23:28] All right, after that is multi-morphic.

[23:31] What is multi-morphic got going on?

[23:33] Well, look, Jerry's making games.

[23:34] I don't know how many he's making.

[23:36] It feels like maybe like a few a week.

[23:40] He keeps showing pictures of people inside the multi-morphic factory.

[23:45] I think multi-morphic is a company that desperately needs to partner up with somebody else.

[23:51] Like, I think Jerry should call up Spooky Pimball and be like, Hey,

[23:55] can I rent out your garage and can you just kick me some line workers

[23:58] and can you just help me make like 300 games a year?

[24:01] There's just something about multi-morphic trying to do all of it on its own.

[24:05] That just looks kind of weird.

[24:07] I mean, I got to be honest, when I see the pictures of the manufacturing over there,

[24:11] it looks like, you know, when you see those prison shots of people making license plates,

[24:14] like it just doesn't feel like an assembly line.

[24:17] It just feels like people like in wood shop in high school, just at different stations.

[24:23] And we know what an efficient Pimball assembly line looks like.

[24:26] And that's not it.

[24:28] Now, look, Jerry's gone all in on this platform.

[24:31] What I fully expect from him is some other like consumer generated game.

[24:35] But I don't think we're going to get anything else other than Scott Denisi's game

[24:39] is going to start to roll out all the weird owls need to be built.

[24:42] So nothing really new or mind boggling from multi-morphic.

[24:46] Homepin, I can just skip over completely.

[24:49] Spinal tap, apparently maybe is going to come out this year.

[24:52] Nobody cares about it.

[24:54] Nobody is going to buy it.

[24:55] It's not a company anyone really pays much attention to.

[24:58] All right, then we get to Pimball Adventures.

[25:00] Andrew McBain's company, Pimball Adventures with Bunny Factory.

[25:03] One game went out to one of my friends who now is no longer a friend of mine

[25:07] because I wouldn't rag on Pimball Adventures.

[25:09] Well, the reason I didn't rag on Pimball Adventures is the same reason

[25:13] I just said about Homepin is nobody really cares.

[25:16] These aren't Pimball companies making any dent in the Pimball marketplace.

[25:20] And Pimball Adventures has another like unlicensed theme

[25:23] that has no target audience.

[25:25] There's no market research going on here.

[25:28] And so, yeah, they don't get much airtime because if I talked about Pimball Adventures

[25:31] for more than a minute, you would cancel your subscription to Canadian Pimball

[25:35] podcast the same way Andrew McBain canceled his subscription to my show.

[25:39] The moment I didn't speak positively about his company.

[25:43] This is my show.

[25:44] I'm free to say what I want to say.

[25:46] I'm not going to kiss a company's ass for five or 10 bucks a month.

[25:49] Last and certainly least is Turner Pimball.

[25:52] They don't have anything coming out.

[25:53] I don't know what this guy is doing.

[25:55] If he were smart, he would just auction off those working Razzas he has.

[25:59] But I don't know why he's even bothering with like Ninja Eclipse or whatever

[26:04] that game is. I saw it at Texas.

[26:06] It doesn't make any sense.

[26:07] OK, so that's a lot of companies and not a lot happening.

[26:11] It always feels like this way in Pimball, right?

[26:13] It's like everybody launched.

[26:14] Everyone fired their missiles in March.

[26:17] And now we don't really have much to get that excited about.

[26:21] I think next year is going to be a big maker break year for Pimball.

[26:25] I think Keith Elwyn is going to deliver.

[26:27] I think Jaws will have a super limited edition version of it that will be fully

[26:32] featured. I think they learn their lesson with James Bond, 60th.

[26:36] And I think everyone who says like, oh, you know, high end Pimball is dead

[26:39] and people aren't going to spend this much money.

[26:41] I think we're going to see a feeding frenzy for Keith Elwyn's game.

[26:46] I think distributors need it.

[26:47] I think Stern needs it.

[26:49] I think dealers need it.

[26:50] And I also think that's why PlayMechanics took all those orders on pulp fiction,

[26:55] because once Keith Elwyn's game comes out, everybody else is in big trouble.

[27:00] It's like at these prices, Keith Elwyn is the only one that I think can consistently

[27:05] deliver a Pimball experience worthy of this much money.

[27:09] Everybody else, you're just going to wait and see.

[27:11] Like even as great as Foo Fighters is, and it's a great pin,

[27:14] and it's an amazing inaugural effort from Jack Danger.

[27:18] If you just wait it, you can now go buy it, Newenbox and Ellie for at least

[27:23] a thousand dollars off.

[27:24] And the more and more we see of this, the more and more we're going to put

[27:28] pressure on the companies to make magic.

[27:31] And that's a good thing.

[27:32] Everybody, I love doing this podcast.

[27:34] I had a great day with the family yesterday.

[27:36] We went down to South Street Seaport right when I was about to do my

[27:40] Saturday morning spectacular.

[27:42] I took Killian and Brenda on a ferry and we had the most amazing day together.

[27:47] Then I went to the gym for 90 minutes.

[27:49] I'm working out every single moment I would have done a Facebook live.

[27:54] And I love it.

[27:55] And I love turning a negative into a positive.

[27:58] You know, and everyone else can be negative and everyone else who says

[28:01] they don't want to be part of Pimball drama.

[28:02] It's funny to watch how everybody shows their true colors.

[28:06] But at the end of the day, there's only one Pimball content creator

[28:09] that has won the award for favorite Pimball podcast for freaking six years in a row.

[28:14] There's only one guy that can stream Pimball without even Pimball in the stream

[28:18] and win the world's second favorite Pimball streamer without even playing Pimball.

[28:24] I am always going to be here.

[28:25] I'm always going to be a champion for the customers and the consumers.

[28:29] I will never be a shill.

[28:30] And my gosh, people can share all the private messages they want.

[28:35] If I were to share all of the private messages I have from all of these people

[28:39] running their mouths, nobody would have any friends left in Pimball.

[28:43] But I don't do that because I take the high road.

[28:46] Everybody have a great Sunday.

[28:48] We will be back.

[28:49] We will be back real soon with more episodes of Canada's Pimball podcast.

[28:53] Canada out.

[29:13] You heaven is a place on earth.

[29:17] You heaven is a place on earth.

[29:21] You heaven is a place on earth.
