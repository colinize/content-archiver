[00:00] I ain't worried about it right now, Keepin' dreams alive, 1999 Heroes.

[00:06] I ain't worried about it right now, Swimming in the flasks, Dancing on the Pals, Vino.

[00:30] You need more than one microphone so your show never goes down, so the man did a crazy

[00:34] thing and Venmo'd me enough money to get another microphone.

[00:39] So now, Kanaid has got two microphones, so whether he's out and about or he's at home,

[00:44] he's gonna have a place to do Kanaid's pinball podcast.

[00:47] Kim Mitchell, thank you very much, brother.

[00:49] You are one of the most generous fans of the show and I really do appreciate your friendship

[00:53] and your extreme generosity over the years.

[00:57] I wanna welcome our new club members, Sean, Nolan, MBT, Ron, RHK, David, CloneStar, Dan,

[01:05] M-E-S-Z, whoever that is, Nathan and another Nathan.

[01:08] So to Nathan's joining the show, welcome to Kanaid's Pinball Podcast.

[01:12] Look, I hope you guys all had a great Memorial Day weekend.

[01:15] I hope you guys all went to go see Top Gun.

[01:17] It is unbelievable.

[01:19] That movie in IMAX is better than any pinball experience ever and you know it and it shouldn't

[01:25] cost so much money to get a few hours of entertainment, but Tom knocked it out of the park.

[01:30] It's so good.

[01:31] I think it's actually better than the first one.

[01:33] It's that good.

[01:34] Alright, so here's what I wanna talk about.

[01:35] We're gonna talk about tournament talk.

[01:37] We never talk about tournament talk, but the greatest of all time, Mr. Keith Elwyn walks

[01:43] up to dialed in on his third ball and just drains, concedes the match, not just the game.

[01:51] He was up for the championship and he conceded the match by not even playing his third ball.

[01:57] We're gonna talk about this.

[01:58] It's starting to spark some controversy on whether or not that was something of respect

[02:03] or whether or not it was a quitter move.

[02:05] And this debate's interesting.

[02:07] I wanna give you my thoughts on it and you know me, like I don't watch competitive pinball.

[02:11] Like I would never waste any of my time watching competitive pinball because I think if you've

[02:15] seen one pinball tournament, you've kind of seen them all.

[02:18] Now I understand if you're competing in them, they're fun, but man, watching pinball being

[02:24] played, it's not fun.

[02:25] It's never gonna catch on.

[02:27] It will never catch on in its current format.

[02:30] They have to do something to make it more interesting.

[02:32] I wanna talk a little bit about pro versus premium and which is the way to go in the

[02:37] pinball world.

[02:38] I've been seeing some debate around that.

[02:41] Another fathom has left Haggis pinball.

[02:44] We're gonna talk about that.

[02:45] We're gonna talk about mods for your games.

[02:48] And does it make sense for these people to cap the number of mods they're gonna make?

[02:53] And then we're just gonna go around the horn and talk about what's going on in the pinball

[02:56] world.

[02:57] Now let's start here.

[02:58] Let's start with what's not going on in the pinball world.

[03:01] So I am hearing from someone who toured Jersey Jack pinball last week that there are no toy

[03:07] stories on the line.

[03:10] He went into the factory.

[03:12] He saw what's there.

[03:13] There are no toy stories being made on the main line.

[03:16] I mean maybe they have a secret line making some that's off to the side but I don't know.

[03:21] The only thing in eyesight is more guns and roses stuff happening.

[03:25] So there is no toy story on the line.

[03:27] So that begs the question.

[03:29] When are we gonna see toy story?

[03:31] I thought we were absolutely gonna see this pin or it was gonna be revealed by the Buzz

[03:36] Lightyear movie which is mid June.

[03:39] But if this game is not on the line yet and we know they normally wanna make like 50 to

[03:44] 100 available on day one then I don't think we're gonna see this game revealed in the

[03:50] next week or two.

[03:51] And that is a humongous bummer.

[03:54] And the reason why it's bumming me out and probably bumming everybody else out is I just

[03:58] wish Jersey Jack was able to give us a date by which we could expect their next title.

[04:05] Like even Stern Pinball has told everybody we are going to reveal our next cornerstone

[04:10] game in August.

[04:12] So we now know in August Stern's gonna deliver a new game.

[04:16] Now Jersey Jack Pinball doesn't even tell us what year, what month, what week.

[04:21] We don't know anything.

[04:22] It's always this cloud of secrecy around when their new game is coming out and I think for

[04:27] a lot of us out there what sucks about this it's so hard to get excited and to maintain

[04:33] your excitement when you don't even know where the finish line is.

[04:37] Why is it that we know when the next movie is gonna come out?

[04:41] We know when TV series are gonna launch.

[04:43] We know when video games are gonna drop.

[04:45] We know when sneakers are gonna drop.

[04:47] Why can't they just tell us the drop date?

[04:50] They don't have to tell us a theme.

[04:51] They don't have to share with us any images of the product.

[04:54] But why is it always such a mystery with Jersey Jack Pinball when they will reveal their games?

[05:00] And they're just on this wonky schedule.

[05:02] Because Willy Wonka was released in like March.

[05:05] Jersey Jack has no set schedule and it's sort of been the story of this company's history.

[05:10] It's like they can never reach deadlines.

[05:13] They can never stay on schedule.

[05:16] And I will say it, if they miss the opening of the Buzz Lightyear movie and they don't

[05:21] ride that excitement and that wave I think it's a huge missed opportunity to be a part

[05:27] of all of that Disney buzz that's gonna happen when that movie comes out, right?

[05:32] Buzz Lightyear movie.

[05:33] A new pinball machine, the first ever Toy Story pinball machine.

[05:36] You wanna be in all those stories that are saying how exciting it is.

[05:40] Also, you would think they'd wanna have these games at the movie premiere.

[05:44] How awesome would it be to put these Toy Story pinball machines at the movie theaters when

[05:49] the premiere is happening for Toy Story?

[05:51] And you could do it all over the world.

[05:52] But look, Jersey Jack Pinball, if they've shown us one thing, they know how to not do

[05:57] it right.

[05:58] Like they miss the Hobbit movies when it launched.

[06:01] And I hope they don't miss this one.

[06:02] Now here's the funny part, is they were supposed to have this game ready for Toy Story 4.

[06:08] Not the Buzz Lightyear movie.

[06:10] There shouldn't even be new Toy Story movies.

[06:13] I think we're done with this franchise from a movie standpoint.

[06:16] But the fact that they've had extra years to get this game ready and it is now June

[06:22] tomorrow and we have absolutely no idea when this game is coming out.

[06:27] It's deflating, it's a bummer, and I really wish Jersey Jack Pinball knew how to generate

[06:32] more hype and excitement for these games.

[06:35] It's just this deflating journey trying to figure out when they're going to get their

[06:39] act together.

[06:40] And everybody is so sick of Guns N' Roses.

[06:43] I am so sick of GNR.

[06:44] I haven't even unboxed mine yet.

[06:46] Alright, let's just get right to this Keith Elwin quitting in the tournament.

[06:49] Okay, so here's the thing.

[06:51] I didn't watch it.

[06:52] I was not going to spend hours on my Memorial Day weekend watching a pinball tournament.

[06:57] So here is what happened.

[06:59] Keith Elwin was playing dialed in against, I believe his name is Escher, and he was playing

[07:04] against someone who put up a strong third ball.

[07:07] I think Keith was behind by something like 900,000 points.

[07:12] Okay?

[07:13] Now look, it's not an insurmountable amount that he had to catch up.

[07:17] It was just a big gap.

[07:18] Now instead of playing the game, instead of competing to see if he could actually overcome

[07:24] his competitor, he drained the ball and he conceded the match.

[07:28] And he didn't just concede the game, he actually conceded the tournament because this was it.

[07:33] Like if he lost this, then he lost his chance to win the tournament.

[07:37] So what do we think about this Keith Elwin?

[07:40] One of the greatest pinball players of all time.

[07:42] I think he has 11 championships in the final match.

[07:45] In the final ball, he just drains.

[07:48] Now is this a move of respect or is this a lame thing that he did?

[07:52] And I see people debating this on both sides of it.

[07:55] And I'm just going to give you my point of view.

[07:57] All right, this is just one man's opinion who never watches pinball tournaments.

[08:02] If you are the greatest pinball player, Keith, then you are.

[08:06] And Keith, you have one of the biggest fan bases in pinball and you have to understand

[08:11] that.

[08:12] And I think with that comes a responsibility that I still don't think Keith Elwin quite

[08:16] understands.

[08:17] And I want to give you two examples of it.

[08:19] And I think this is one example.

[08:21] Keith Elwin has tons of fans who spend thousands of dollars on his products.

[08:27] And people love rooting for Keith Elwin and they love buying Keith Elwin products.

[08:32] And I think Keith needs to realize that he has a big fan base.

[08:35] That because of him, he's made thousands of people reignite their excitement for pinball.

[08:41] And so if you're rooting for Keith Elwin as a competitive pinball player and you're

[08:45] ready for ball number three, like, can the greatest pinball player of all time come back

[08:50] from this huge deficit, right?

[08:52] This huge margin.

[08:54] And Kenny show us that he is the greatest and overcome a 900,000 point deficit.

[08:59] And then he just drains the ball.

[09:01] I don't know any other way to look at that other than that's lame.

[09:05] People just wanted to see him try.

[09:07] People want to see what he could do.

[09:09] People want to see if he could pull one last magical moment out of a hat.

[09:13] And also, like, if you're the competitor playing Keith, you want Keith to give it his all.

[09:18] You don't want him to take a dive on the third ball.

[09:20] I don't care what anybody says.

[09:22] The tournament was on the line.

[09:24] And this is someone that so many people look up to from a player's perspective.

[09:29] And I do think it was kind of lame to do that.

[09:32] And I don't care what crazy Levy says or anyone else says.

[09:35] If this happened in other sports, everyone else would think it's lame.

[09:39] Let me give you an example.

[09:40] Imagine if this was a tennis match and you're in the championship and you're down two sets

[09:44] to none and you're also down five games to nil.

[09:48] And you're serving and you're down five games to nil and you just hit the ball into the

[09:53] net on all of your serves, concede the match in accept defeat and walk off the court.

[09:58] Everyone would think that was totally lame.

[10:01] We teach children and we teach people in all competitive sports to play hard to the end,

[10:08] to play hard to the final whistle.

[10:10] Even in baseball matches, when players stop running to first base when their team is down

[10:14] by a lot, they get chewed out by the manager.

[10:18] I do think this is a bad example to set for everyone out there.

[10:21] You don't concede like this.

[10:23] You play through to the end.

[10:25] And that is how I feel about all sports, not just this pinball tournament.

[10:29] And the other part is this, and I'm just going to say it.

[10:31] And I think Keith is one of the most talented people in pinball.

[10:35] I think he makes some of the greatest pinball machines of all time.

[10:38] Godzilla is getting better and better with each code update and people are loving this

[10:42] game like I haven't seen them love a game in a long time.

[10:44] But here's my other issue with Keith Elwin.

[10:46] Because when the award shows happen, he's nowhere to be found.

[10:50] He never talks back to the fans.

[10:51] He should be up there taking the trophy because everybody voted for you, Keith.

[10:56] That's another example where it's like, come on, man.

[10:59] Like all these people are voting for your game as their favorite game and you can't

[11:04] go and get up on stage and accept the award.

[11:06] You couldn't even make videos accepting the award when it was remote.

[11:10] And that's my thing is, Keith, I think you have a responsibility to play all of your

[11:14] balls to the end and you also have a responsibility to accept these awards when people are voting

[11:20] for you.

[11:21] These are your fans.

[11:22] Like it's not about being humble.

[11:25] It's not about being private.

[11:26] This is a small community and I just think he should engage more with his fan base and

[11:32] that's all I'm going to say on it.

[11:34] He's still the greatest designer right now in pinball.

[11:37] Keith, you have like the greatest air cover in all of pinball.

[11:40] Like no one's allowed to even say anything critical about Keith Elwin.

[11:45] And man, I just think these are two examples where Keith should just give back to his fans

[11:50] because they give so much to him and I think he needs to realize that.

[11:53] I think so.

[11:54] And it's not about being humble.

[11:55] It's not about being private, Keith.

[11:57] There is a responsibility that goes beyond just making these games for fans.

[12:00] I think you need to understand that.

[12:02] You are like the hero to a lot of these buyers and a lot of these kids who are playing these

[12:07] games and looking up to you.

[12:09] I know it's weird to say it, but a pinball player is actually a role model for a lot

[12:14] of people who love pinball.

[12:16] And I think there's a responsibility there.

[12:18] Okay, let's move on to the next topic.

[12:20] Let's talk about the fact that the next fathom went out the door.

[12:25] Now there was an image that was just posted an hour ago.

[12:27] It says I just picked up another fathom from the factory and then there's an image of the

[12:31] game in the box.

[12:33] But here's the weird part.

[12:34] The serial number, which would indicate to us what number fathom was picked up, is blocked

[12:40] out by an image that says Yippee.

[12:43] And I don't understand why we are still here.

[12:46] So there is still no understanding of what number is this.

[12:50] Someone on my Saturday morning spectacular said that there's two or three fathoms in

[12:54] America.

[12:55] So where are those games?

[12:57] Here's the thing.

[12:58] And I think Damien and Marty just need to stop with this secrecy and the silence and

[13:02] all of the questions and speculation.

[13:05] Every time a fathom is made, why can't they just share an image of this game going into

[13:12] a box?

[13:13] Hey, we've just built game number four or game number five.

[13:16] I don't even care what game number it is, but why are we still guessing where they are

[13:21] in production and why is production taking so damn long?

[13:25] You know, when you start building a game, you don't just build one a week or two a month

[13:30] or five a month.

[13:32] I don't know.

[13:33] Like this still feels like a slow ramp up to production.

[13:36] I don't think real production has begun, but you know, they just won't come clean.

[13:42] They just won't talk to us and tell us what's going on.

[13:47] Is it a part shortage?

[13:48] It can't be a part shortage.

[13:50] It must be a labor issue because if it was a part shortage and they were missing parts,

[13:56] then they couldn't build any games.

[13:58] So they must have the parts to make these games.

[14:01] I think it's a labor issue.

[14:02] I don't think they have many people over there.

[14:04] I think there's four to five people inside that factory.

[14:08] And I think building each one of these right now with a skeleton crew is a nightmare.

[14:14] And I think that's what we're experiencing because we're not seeing five games go out

[14:18] a week.

[14:19] We're not seeing 50 a month.

[14:20] And all of the people that paid in fall, the series ticket holders, they were promised

[14:24] their games by early May and they've missed that.

[14:28] And so here we are a month after the production video.

[14:31] Now we get game number two being showed to everybody.

[14:35] And I'm just here to say, I just don't believe that production has begun and I'm tired of

[14:40] speculating.

[14:41] They need to talk to us.

[14:43] Where are you in your production schedule?

[14:45] How many are you going to make a week?

[14:48] How come people didn't get their games in early May as promised?

[14:52] Why is this all such a secret?

[14:55] Hey Mitchell, I'm not going to let up on these guys because then I look over at Dutch Pinball

[15:00] and they've led us into their factory.

[15:02] And what do we see?

[15:04] Nothing but a huge row of Lebowski's lined up ready to go into boxes being tested for

[15:10] customers.

[15:11] Now, I will never give Dutch Pinball that much credit because this game is eight years

[15:17] old and they ripped off customers eight years ago.

[15:21] So Dutch Pinball never gets a full clap.

[15:24] You know, I'm like, my hands are going towards each other and then I'm stopping them because

[15:28] yes, while I'm happy to see Dutch Pinball get their production to this level, it's

[15:33] been eight years people.

[15:35] So let's not get too excited.

[15:37] It would be very hypocritical of me.

[15:39] I can't make fun of Haggis Pinball for being a year late when Dutch Pinball is eight years

[15:45] late.

[15:46] Okay.

[15:47] But they're getting it done and they are showing production that looks much better right now

[15:51] than Haggis' production.

[15:53] That's all I want and I'm not going to get it.

[15:54] For some reason, we are just not going to get the transparency from Marty and Damien.

[16:00] And I don't know why.

[16:02] And I think each week they go radio silent.

[16:05] It makes them look even more like they're faking it.

[16:08] And I don't buy that just one game being picked up is a good sign because think of their overhead.

[16:16] Think of what their monthly burn is.

[16:18] They can't survive as a company if they're only scratch building these games like one

[16:24] or two a week.

[16:25] Like that's not good enough.

[16:27] All right.

[16:28] So thinking of things and not being good enough.

[16:29] I want to talk about Pinball mods for a minute because I'm seeing this like really cool neon

[16:35] sign for Godzilla.

[16:36] By the way, Godzilla as a game is becoming a modder's dream come true.

[16:42] I will say this for some of you out there.

[16:44] Don't go overboard.

[16:46] And I mean it when I say it.

[16:47] Don't put so much in this game that you start to block the ball at every turn because you

[16:53] can put too many mods into a game.

[16:56] I think modding is a really interesting and fun thing to do in Pinball.

[17:01] But I also think there's a point where you can overmod a game.

[17:04] So just be careful.

[17:05] Don't put in too much stuff that absolutely does nothing.

[17:09] But this neon sign mod is really cool for Godzilla.

[17:12] And I think it improves upon the stern sign that is in the game.

[17:16] But here's the thing that I just want to encourage all of you modders out there.

[17:19] I think some of these modders prematurely cap the amount of mods they're going to make

[17:24] like they might say we're only making 150.

[17:26] I'm only making 300.

[17:29] Don't do that.

[17:30] I'll tell you what.

[17:31] The only reason you should ever like cap the amount of mods you're going to make if

[17:35] your mod is super, super expensive, right?

[17:37] The only way that like elite pinball toppers could sell those things at 2,500 a pop is if

[17:44] they only make 100, right?

[17:45] So that works.

[17:46] If they said we're going to make a thousand, they're not going to sell a thousand at $2,500

[17:51] a pop.

[17:52] For these other mods that cost around like 200 bucks or $250, why would you cap how many

[17:59] you're going to make?

[18:00] Why would you do that?

[18:01] Because the moment you do that on a game like Godzilla, Godzilla is going to sell like 5,000

[18:06] units.

[18:07] Mods are great, especially for the pro owners because they make the game look even better.

[18:12] And so it makes no sense to me to cap your mods.

[18:14] That's just some marketing advice for you guys out there because it's decent side hustle.

[18:18] Some of these modders, you guys don't want to know how much some of these modders make,

[18:22] but some of them are making six figures a year, like over $100,000 a year selling 3D printed

[18:30] stuff for your games.

[18:32] And they're making bank.

[18:33] I mean, and they know it.

[18:34] The ones who are smart, like they figured out a way around the IP infringement and they

[18:38] get mods out there and they are making so much because when you're 3D printing plastic

[18:45] and putting some LED lights, this stuff does not cost anywhere near what they are charging,

[18:50] but they're smart because they know if you have $11,000 to spend on a pinball machine,

[18:56] you easily, you easily have 250 bucks to make it look even nicer.

[19:01] I've always enjoyed the mod community.

[19:03] I always enjoyed modding my games.

[19:05] I love the mods and Lord of the Rings that I put in the game.

[19:08] I love the mods in Batman.

[19:09] I love seeing most of these Godzilla mods.

[19:12] So hats off to the mod community because I think you guys are doing the job that Stern

[19:17] Pinball should be doing.

[19:19] That's the final point I'll make for $11,500.

[19:23] Everything that these modders are doing should have been done at Stern.

[19:27] Stern is laughing all the way to the bank.

[19:30] There is so much flat cheap plastic in Stern machines that could easily be modded and have

[19:37] more 3D sculpted stuff in different areas of the game and they absolutely go cheap because

[19:43] they know that the mod community will just take over and make it look nicer.

[19:48] But again, for this much money, I think these games should come loaded with stuff and not

[19:53] require us to buy additional mods.

[19:56] I didn't talk about this, but I want to raise this real quick.

[19:58] The most ridiculous point that George Gomez made.

[20:00] This is why when you interview George Gomez, and it was a great interview by the Super

[20:04] Awesome Pinball Show, but George Gomez insinuated that more creativity happens when you lower

[20:10] the bomb.

[20:11] When you restrict your designers to a certain point, they have to get really creative to

[20:16] figure it out.

[20:17] And I want to say that George Gomez would love you to believe that.

[20:20] He would love me to believe that.

[20:22] He would love all of Pinball buyers to believe that.

[20:25] When you take away money and resources from designers, you're going to get a more creative

[20:30] product.

[20:32] That is the biggest bunch of BS I have ever heard.

[20:35] Because the true stories are this.

[20:37] The true stories are the moment in which John Borg had a meltdown because they yank stuffed

[20:42] out of his Munster's game and he was throwing stuff around the design studio.

[20:45] So that really happened.

[20:47] And you're telling me that if George Gomez looked at Pirates of the Caribbean, he's

[20:51] going to keep in that upper play field that rocks back and forth?

[20:54] There's a reason why when you look at most Stern games, there's really not much in them

[20:59] from an innovation standpoint, from a mechanical standpoint.

[21:03] And it's because the bomb is really low.

[21:05] See, George Gomez would look over the Big Lebowski and be like, well, why do we have

[21:09] to put all this money into this bowling alley?

[21:12] Why don't we just put the bowling alley feature on the LCD screen?

[21:15] We all know if Stern made Big Lebowski, that bowling alley takes place on the screen to

[21:19] save them all that money.

[21:21] What makes Big Lebowski so amazing and so magical is when you walk up to the game, there's

[21:26] a physical bowling alley underneath it.

[21:28] So I don't agree with any of that statement by George Gomez.

[21:31] I think these games get more creative when you give your designers more resources.

[21:36] All right, what else is going on in pinball?

[21:39] So I keep seeing people debate like whether or not I should get a premium or a pro.

[21:43] Now this is an age old debate, right?

[21:45] And I love the phrase pros or for hoes, right?

[21:48] It's always like the people who buy pros try to justify their purchase.

[21:51] I don't want an alley.

[21:53] I don't want a premium.

[21:54] I'm going with the pro.

[21:55] And every pro buyer always has the same rationale.

[21:59] It's always the same thing.

[22:00] They always have one reason why they get a pro.

[22:03] It shoots better.

[22:05] The gameplay is better.

[22:06] And you know what?

[22:07] They're not wrong.

[22:08] When you remove stuff from a pinball machine that slows down the ball, when you remove

[22:14] like the building from Godzilla that has to go up and down or a magnet that grabs the

[22:18] ball on mecha Godzilla, when you remove that stuff, the ball stays in play longer.

[22:23] From a gameplay standpoint, the pro will always shoot better because the ball is constantly

[22:30] in motion, right?

[22:31] That's the other argument, right?

[22:32] It's like a lot of people don't like upper playfields because they slow the game down.

[22:36] Same thing with lower playfields.

[22:38] Like a lot of people don't like the lower playfield in the Munsters because A, it's not

[22:42] rewarding when you're down there and it slows the game down.

[22:46] So if you are a gameplay fanatic and all you want is gameplay, then absolutely why not

[22:51] go for the pro?

[22:53] But if you want to see more mechanical wow and magical moments, I definitely think premium

[22:59] and LE is the way to go.

[23:00] The other thing that's funny is people need to stop saying they played the premium and

[23:04] the LE as if they're different games.

[23:08] It's the same game.

[23:09] You always see these jerks.

[23:10] Like I jumped on a pro, premium and LE.

[23:12] Here are my thoughts.

[23:13] Like why?

[23:14] Why did you have to jump on a premium and an LE to get a different experience?

[23:18] It's the same exact game.

[23:20] Okay.

[23:20] I think everyone looks silly when they try to act like the LE's got something special

[23:25] because it doesn't.

[23:26] There's absolutely no gameplay features that make the LE any different than the premium.

[23:30] From a financial standpoint, though, it always makes sense to get the LE because chances

[23:35] are if you get an LE, you're not going to lose as much money and you might actually

[23:39] gain some money.

[23:40] It's only been recently where people are paying over sticker for pros and premiums,

[23:44] but usually because Stern will make an unlimited amount of pros and premiums.

[23:49] If you buy one, you're going to lose a few hundred bucks, maybe a couple thousand at

[23:53] the end of the run.

[23:54] But nowadays, like you can buy a pro and premium and probably get your money back if you sell

[24:00] it within the first six months.

[24:01] But that's going to end because one Stern starts cranking these games out.

[24:04] All of these pro and premium prices are going to go south pretty quickly because you can

[24:09] have a new one.

[24:09] Like why would you want an old one, a used one when you can have a brand new one?

[24:13] All right, everybody, thank you so much for being part of the Canadian Club.

[24:16] We're back.

[24:17] The mic is working.

[24:18] Kim Mitchell, we got mic number two coming in soon.

[24:21] So everybody, I hope you guys had a great long weekend.

[24:24] And I don't know what to tell you.

[24:25] I don't think there's going to be much news until we get Toy Story.

[24:28] I was super excited.

[24:29] Now my energy levels are fading quickly.

[24:32] I just want JJP to throw the game into the ring.

[24:36] There's only so much we can talk about.

[24:38] Where's Cactus Canyon?

[24:40] Where's Legends of Vahala?

[24:42] Where's the Dennis Nordman game?

[24:44] There's nothing.

[24:45] There's nothing happening anywhere.

[24:47] I will say everyone else other than Stern has completely fumbled this window.

[24:52] Everybody.

[24:53] Stern gave all of these companies a window to make games and nobody can get it done.

[24:59] So we must still be feeling the effects of COVID.

[25:01] We must still be feeling the effects of the supply chain and nobody can get it done.

[25:06] Nobody.

[25:06] Like where are the Legends of Vahala is going out?

[25:08] Where are the weird-out games going out?

[25:10] Nothing is happening anywhere.

[25:12] Unfortunately for a lot of these companies, I think when they figure it out,

[25:16] Stern's going to show their new game and Toy Story is going to come out.

[25:19] They really missed the boat.

[25:21] And I think they're going to regret it because at these price points and as the economy goes down,

[25:25] a lot of people are going to start to say, I'm only buying one game this year.

[25:28] And if I had Legends of Vahala on order like six months ago and it was like nine months ago,

[25:34] I ordered Cactus Canyon, but now I really want this game or the new Stern game.

[25:38] I don't think you're going to see people go on like three, four game purchases a year anymore.

[25:42] It's just who the hell wants to spend like 40 grand on four pinball machines?

[25:47] It's getting crazy people.

[25:49] Canada out.

[25:49] I ain't worried about it right now.

[25:52] Keepin' dream alive.

[25:54] 1999 heroes.

[25:56] I ain't worried about it right now.

[25:59] Swimming in the flasks.

[26:01] Dancing on the clouds below.

[26:03] I ain't worried about it.

[26:10] I ain't worried about it.

[26:17] I ain't worried about it.
