[00:00] Alright everybody, welcome to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:18] The best thing to happen to haggis pinball this week is multi-morphic has a new game, The

[00:23] Princess Bride.

[00:25] It got revealed today, now look, I think I told you, I don't know, like how many months

[00:29] ago that this was going to be a multi-morphic game, now we know.

[00:34] And so let's talk about The Princess Bride.

[00:37] Is this the nicest P3 multi-morphic game to date?

[00:42] Will this be the game that makes people jump into the platform?

[00:47] What do we know about this game?

[00:48] Should we start with the theme itself?

[00:50] Alright, so Princess Bride.

[00:52] It's a movie that came out in 1987.

[00:55] It had a budget of $16 million and it made $30 million at the box office.

[01:02] So it was kind of a box office bust, but this movie kind of became a cult classic when it

[01:09] went to VHS.

[01:11] Like how many of you out there went to Blockbuster and rented The Princess Bride?

[01:17] And I think what makes this movie so iconic and so timeless, it just had so much fun fantasy

[01:24] stuff happening in this movie.

[01:26] You had a giant, you had pirates, you had large swamp rats, you had a king, you had

[01:32] a queen, you had love, you had a castle, you had a tortured chamber, it had comedy, it

[01:38] had action, it had some of the most memorable lines that to this day people still remember.

[01:45] My name is Inigo Mintoia.

[01:46] You killed my father, prepare to die.

[01:50] And now we have a pinball machine based on The Princess Bride.

[01:54] We've got interesting mechanisms in the game and I'm looking at the game right now and

[02:00] I want to just give you my overall feelings on the game.

[02:03] I haven't played it yet.

[02:04] Nobody has played it yet.

[02:05] And that was my first feeling about this reveal was so you reveal it on Presidents Day.

[02:12] Everybody is off.

[02:13] So that's not a bad time to reveal a game.

[02:16] Everybody is around their computers with nothing else to do and then you drop the game on the

[02:21] world and order banks open tomorrow.

[02:25] Now you know me, I would still wait it out.

[02:27] Like why would you order a game tomorrow?

[02:31] And at the pace at which multi-morphic is making games, you're not going to miss out

[02:35] on any edition of this game.

[02:39] They're going to make 500 collectors editions at $13,750.

[02:47] They're going to make 750 limited edition versions of this game for $12,750.

[02:57] And then it seems like they're going to make a standard edition, which is not that cheap

[03:01] either people.

[03:02] The standard edition of this game is going to be $11,500.

[03:09] And you can get a base P3 machine for $8,500, which I don't even think comes with a game.

[03:17] Now before we get into the different versions of the games, let me just give you my overall

[03:22] thoughts on the game itself.

[03:24] I saw the video.

[03:25] I'm not sure who that woman was in the video.

[03:29] I want to give Jerry some marketing advice.

[03:31] I'm not sure who that is playing the game, but you get one chance to release your game

[03:37] to the world.

[03:38] It's based on the Princess Bride.

[03:41] You should have had someone dress up like the dread pirate Roberts or whatever his name

[03:46] is in the movie.

[03:47] Instead of just having a random woman play the game, like you know that 98% of the pinball

[03:54] buying demographic is like middle-aged men.

[03:58] But do something that sells to your audience.

[04:01] I don't know if you're trying to convey that like, oh yeah, your wives are going to love

[04:04] this game if you get it.

[04:06] So it was a little bit funny to me when I saw the expressions on that woman's face as she

[04:11] was playing the game.

[04:12] I'm looking at the module right now and you've got the castle in the upper left.

[04:18] You've got the cliffs of insanity on the right.

[04:21] You've got some drop targets that go into different areas of the play field.

[04:26] You've got the green grass that Wesley falls down, you know, the as you wish.

[04:32] You've got two swords up there by the castle.

[04:36] And just looking at it right now, it definitely does present really nice.

[04:41] Like I do like the atmospheric essence of this modular kit.

[04:46] I do like it.

[04:47] The only thing is this, as I'm looking at it right now, everything does look a little

[04:52] plasticky.

[04:53] Like there's no scopes in the game.

[04:56] Like the rock cliff looks like flat plastic.

[05:00] The castle looks like flat plastic.

[05:03] And I think what would have made this game stand out even more is if they had actual

[05:08] scopes in the game.

[05:10] Like on that rock surface, I want to see more rockiness to it.

[05:15] On the castle, I want it to be more 3D sculpted.

[05:18] And I think this is a game where if you're a mod maker, this is going to be a golden

[05:23] opportunity to sort of add some more 3 dimensional scopes to this game because it all does look

[05:30] a little flat.

[05:31] And that was my first takeaway of just looking at the game itself.

[05:34] Now look, I do like some of the mechs in this game.

[05:37] And I think my favorite one is the cliffs of insanity where that pinball is climbing up

[05:44] the cliffs.

[05:45] Like that is super freaking cool.

[05:48] I hope that mech works every single time, but it just goes to show you in this sport

[05:53] of pinball that we all love, you want to see the ball do really interesting stuff like

[06:00] that.

[06:01] So I thought that was a tremendous, a tremendous way to use a mechanical must be magnetic way

[06:08] to sort of bring this theme to life.

[06:10] But as I'm looking at the game right now and I'm looking at the castle and the rocks,

[06:15] it looks like it's got that little hut house as I look at all over.

[06:19] And this is the thing.

[06:20] It's like this game is following in the footsteps of labyrinth and labyrinth is a similar kind

[06:26] of theme and labyrinth had so many beautiful 3D sculpted elements in the game itself.

[06:33] And it's making this game look really flat and really plasticky.

[06:38] So that is one of my gripes in this game is nothing's popping out in a 3D sense.

[06:44] And the other thing I felt when I was looking at the modular part of the game or just the

[06:48] overall game itself, and this can be added, but I think the major thing missing when you

[06:54] look under the glass, what is this movie all about?

[06:58] This movie is all about all of these different iconic characters.

[07:02] As I was looking down at this game, where is everybody like nobody is anywhere underneath

[07:08] the glass in physical form.

[07:10] And I really think this game does need some like characters, like some action figures

[07:16] or something underneath the glass.

[07:18] Like let's just take for example, the cliffs of insanity.

[07:22] It just feels like you want to see Wesley there, like even just having the characters at the

[07:27] top, even having Inigo Montoya somewhere like sword fencing, seeing the characters themselves.

[07:33] And I guess they're going to rely heavily on the LCD screen to do that.

[07:37] The whole game feels like the environment of the Princess Bride, but I just don't see

[07:42] any of the characters from the Princess Bride.

[07:45] Now they are all over the cabinets.

[07:47] They're on the Translight.

[07:49] And look, we've got very little gameplay so far on this machine itself.

[07:54] I hear Buffalo Pinball is going to stream this game on Saturday.

[07:58] But here's the thing everybody, they want to take your money tomorrow.

[08:02] And look, unless you absolutely have loved what you've seen so far.

[08:06] I wouldn't order this game tomorrow.

[08:08] The reason why I would not even order this game anytime soon is, Multimorphic is not

[08:14] a company that can make 1,250 games a year.

[08:18] How many games a year are they even making?

[08:21] I don't even think they're making one game a day.

[08:23] And so for a company to come out and say, hey, we're going to make 500 CEs, 750 LEs,

[08:31] and an unlimited number of standard edition games.

[08:35] And they're maybe only making five games a week.

[08:39] And they want to take your money right now.

[08:42] Why would you leave a deposit?

[08:44] It just doesn't make any sense.

[08:45] So if you like the game, I would just wait.

[08:49] And you're going to be waiting forever.

[08:50] Like even if you order the game in like a week or two, you're going to be waiting almost

[08:54] a year to get your game.

[08:56] So we will see more about the gameplay.

[08:59] Looking at the game right now.

[09:00] It looks like a pretty standard fan layout that ramp up the middle looks pretty wide.

[09:06] That looks pretty easy to hit.

[09:08] It doesn't seem to have as much, right?

[09:11] As much of a wow mech in it as the heist or as a game like Final Resistance.

[09:17] So we shall see how it plays.

[09:18] Look, and there's no getting around it, people.

[09:21] This game is not cheap.

[09:22] The cheapest version of this game is $11,500.

[09:28] Like that's $5,000 more than a Stern Pro.

[09:31] And the $13,750 version of the game, I mean that's in between a Jersey Jack Elton John

[09:39] Platinum and a Jersey Jack Elton John Collectors Edition.

[09:44] That's $750 more than a Stern LE.

[09:49] So these games are not cheap.

[09:51] So if you're going to go in on one, you really are going to want to go in on this platform.

[09:56] And I think Jerry has heard some of the feedback.

[09:59] I like the fact that there's finally artwork on the front of the cabinet.

[10:04] I'm still not a fan of those three flipper buttons on the sides of the game.

[10:10] Even in the video as the woman was playing the game and she was flipping back and forth

[10:15] between like the top flipper button and the bottom flipper button.

[10:18] It was just making me anxious watching her flip like that.

[10:22] Jerry, every single pinball machine that's ever come out that has an upper and lower flippers,

[10:28] they all operate using just one flipper button.

[10:32] And I know you can change that into settings, but why are we still here?

[10:37] Nobody who plays pinball wants to relearn how to play pinball on this platform.

[10:43] So here's the other part as I was looking at the feature matrix of the game is like,

[10:48] I don't understand a marketing move they're making.

[10:51] And let me explain what I mean by that.

[10:53] So the nicest version of this game is the collector's edition.

[10:58] There will only be 500 and each of those comes with a unique translate.

[11:05] Bronze powder coated legs and armor.

[11:08] This is the big one, the decorative cabinet T mounted swords.

[11:12] You got those in Eagle Mentoyo swords on each side of the machine.

[11:16] And are those going to interfere with your flipper buttons?

[11:20] Now they have said they do not.

[11:22] They are definitely weird.

[11:24] They are definitely strange, but they definitely fit the theme.

[11:28] You then also get a custom LCD framing back glass, custom launch button,

[11:34] a numbered plaque, a signed certificate of authenticity,

[11:39] and a printed limited edition translate.

[11:42] I'm just confused.

[11:43] Like you get the collector's edition digital translate because remember the

[11:48] translate area on a P3 multi-morphic is an LCD screen,

[11:54] but you also get a printed version of the translate.

[11:58] What's the point of that?

[12:00] Like you don't even need it.

[12:01] You can't even put that into the game.

[12:03] Here's my thing.

[12:04] And this is where it makes no sense.

[12:06] So I think to date, you know, we've had weird owl, we've had heist,

[12:10] we've had final resistance.

[12:12] I think this is the nicest P3 to date.

[12:15] Jerry, congratulations.

[12:16] You finally are starting to show people that this platform can work.

[12:21] If you get the right theme on it.

[12:23] And I like all the clips.

[12:25] I like all the assets.

[12:26] I like that you got all the call outs and it's all synced up.

[12:30] I mean, this feels like it's going to translate the movie really nicely in

[12:35] pinball format.

[12:36] Here's my thing about what they're doing here.

[12:38] So imagine if you've supported Jerry from day one,

[12:41] right?

[12:42] Imagine if you went all in on a multi-morphic and you bought Lexi light

[12:47] speed, cosmic cart racing, you bought heist, you bought weird owl.

[12:51] You've bought every single Jerry machine he's ever made.

[12:55] And now you cannot have the nicest version of the princess bride,

[13:02] which is the nicest game that's come out to date on the P3 multi-morphic

[13:07] platform because he won't allow you to upgrade your machine to be a collector's

[13:13] edition.

[13:14] I think that is a colossal marketing mistake.

[13:17] And I understand why they're doing it, right?

[13:19] It's like these cabinets are going to have the Enigo Mintoio swords on the

[13:23] cabinets.

[13:24] I don't think those are going to come on and off.

[13:26] Okay.

[13:27] So now it also starts to get weird because think about it.

[13:30] You spend $13,750 on the collector's edition of the princess

[13:36] bride pinball machine and you've got these two swords attached to your cabinet.

[13:42] So what happens when you put in Lexi light speed?

[13:45] You're going to be playing Lexi light speed with two Enigo Mintoio swords.

[13:50] It all of a sudden doesn't work.

[13:52] And it just starts to beg the question.

[13:54] It's like Jerry's almost making what people have been asking for from day one.

[13:59] He's making a cabinet that's dedicated to a theme.

[14:03] And now all of a sudden this seems to be like a weird sort of middle ground with

[14:07] his entire philosophy.

[14:09] Do you take those swords off?

[14:11] Do they even come off?

[14:12] It doesn't look like they're going to come off.

[14:14] They have to be on there pretty sturdy, especially if you're rocking the machine

[14:18] around.

[14:19] And so now you got to go all in on a dedicated princess bride cabinet.

[14:24] And if you buy this for $13,750, what happens when the next P3

[14:30] multi-morphic game comes out?

[14:32] Are you going to be ripping off the stickers on this game and putting in a

[14:36] new modular game, but then you've got swords stuck on the side of your machine.

[14:42] So it doesn't really make sense.

[14:44] And it still opens the door to the conversation Jerry doesn't want to have,

[14:49] which is if this company just made a dedicated cabinet,

[14:53] they would be much more successful.

[14:55] And that was sort of like my first day takeaway of looking at this game.

[15:00] The other mistake I think he's making from a marketing standpoint is the artwork

[15:05] on the collector's edition should be unique.

[15:08] It's the same exact artwork that's on the limited edition.

[15:12] Why is it that the only unique art package is on the standard edition game?

[15:19] Like the cheapest version of the game should not have the unique art package.

[15:24] And it does.

[15:26] And it's like, if only they would call up

[15:28] Canada and run this stuff by me, I could help them out.

[15:32] And I know what Jerry's trying to do.

[15:34] I know what he's trying to do.

[15:35] He wants to find new buyers.

[15:37] He wants to entice new people to go all in on the platform.

[15:41] But as I just said, like it doesn't really make any sense.

[15:45] And if you want to put the heist in it, you've got swords on the side of your game.

[15:49] And even like when I'm going through the pin side thread,

[15:52] there's just so much confusion with the multi-morphic platform.

[15:56] And if I pay this much, I get this and a cabinet that's empty is 8500.

[16:03] And then it's 3000 over here and 3700 over here and it's 5000 over here.

[16:08] And you're saving $700.

[16:10] If you do this, it's all over the place.

[16:12] And I don't think that's good.

[16:14] I think there's too much confusion about what to get.

[16:17] And it almost just feels like, Jerry, there should just be one version

[16:22] of the game. I think if there was just one version of this game,

[16:26] like there's one version of Labyrinth and he said, Hey,

[16:30] we're only making 1000 Princess Bride games.

[16:34] They all cost this.

[16:36] They all come with the topper.

[16:38] They come with this and that.

[16:40] And that's how you do it.

[16:41] I don't think Jerry is in a position to offer three versions of a game,

[16:47] especially a company that can't manufacture that quickly, Jerry.

[16:52] Like it just makes more sense.

[16:54] Just have one assembly line making the same exact game over and over and over again.

[17:02] You don't have the ability to customize it like this.

[17:06] It's just going to slow down your manufacturing.

[17:09] And my overall thoughts as I was looking at this game,

[17:13] I think most of you out there, this looks like the nicest P3 game to date.

[17:18] I think this has peaked a lot of our curiosity.

[17:21] I think everybody wants to play it.

[17:23] I think it looks like a fun game.

[17:25] And I'm just asking myself, do you want to spend this much money on it?

[17:30] And that's the big question mark.

[17:32] And I don't know, right?

[17:33] I mean, I know personally, I'm not going to spend this much money on a

[17:36] multi-morphic. I like the theme and I can't wait to play it.

[17:40] But again, it's just too much money for me.

[17:42] 13.7 for a collector's edition.

[17:45] And then if you buy another modular kit, you're in another $3,500.

[17:50] Now you're trying to sell almost a $17,000 package.

[17:55] If you want to sell this game on the secondhand market, $17,000.

[18:00] It's just too much.

[18:01] Ultimately, the market's going to decide whether or not Jerry's business model is

[18:06] going to work to date.

[18:07] It hasn't been the most successful.

[18:10] Right now, I would still much rather buy an Elton John Platinum for $12,000 over

[18:17] a multi-morphic.

[18:18] You could get a Jaws Pro is basically $5,000 cheaper than a standard edition of

[18:24] a multi-morphic.

[18:25] Like that's a lot of money, people.

[18:27] So we shall see.

[18:29] I'm obviously going to do more shows on this game when we see streaming on

[18:33] Saturday, but we have a new pinball game in the world.

[18:35] And the final point is this, this game is not going on the line until

[18:39] the summer.

[18:40] So why did Jerry reveal it now?

[18:43] Like it's still basically wintertime.

[18:45] We're not even at spring and he wants to take orders on this game tomorrow.

[18:51] I don't like this.

[18:52] This game is like four to five months away from actually being on the line.

[18:57] And he wants to lock in deposit money now.

[19:00] I wouldn't do it.

[19:01] I wouldn't give deposit money to Haggis.

[19:03] I wouldn't give deposit money to anybody.

[19:06] Make these companies make these games.

[19:09] Make these companies make these games without your money.

[19:12] Let them ship these games to distributors.

[19:15] And when that game is on a shelf at a distributor, then buy the game.

[19:20] We all need to change your behavior.

[19:22] There's no reason why anybody should be ordering this game tomorrow.

[19:26] It's not going to be on the line for four to five months.

[19:29] And this activity of needing money now, it also makes me feel like these

[19:34] companies are not doing well financially because if they were,

[19:39] they wouldn't be taking money four to five months in advance.

[19:43] They just wouldn't be doing it.

[19:45] Everybody have a great Monday.

[19:47] My voice is gone.

[19:48] I'm still not feeling 100 percent.

[19:50] I think I did too much on Saturday morning's spectacular, but I'll talk to you soon later.
