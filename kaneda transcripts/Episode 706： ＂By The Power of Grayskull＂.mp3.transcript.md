[00:00] And if I don't got enough in a tank, maybe I can just siphon enough to fill up this mass can't man

[00:04] Well I survived in this climate of what they said I was washed up and got a blood bath

[00:08] I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter I can adjust plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust

[00:14] So floor's open if you'd like to discuss

[00:20] Ah, welcome to Canade, it's been Bob podcast everybody

[00:23] Thank you for being a club member

[00:25] You know, it's been a little negative in this neck of the woods

[00:28] I've been talking way too much about Jersey Jack pinballs with it the plate toy story for you know, I'll say this

[00:35] It's bummed me out. I'm a huge fan. I don't want to keep talking about it

[00:38] So on this episode what we will do is go down the list of manufacturers and talk about the news going on in the pinball world

[00:45] Because nobody delivers the pinball news quite like naps arcade and that's the greatest thing right now

[00:52] Right we've got naps arcade giving everybody what's going on in pinball

[00:56] But the reason you tune into Canadian pinball podcasts isn't because I'm gonna break every single news item for you

[01:02] It's because I'm gonna give you the most honest opinion about what's going on in the pinball world

[01:08] That's the big differentiator right? I don't hold back. I don't hold punches

[01:13] You know, I was just thinking about it if some of these pinball podcasters were like baseball umpires and

[01:19] Jersey Jack pinball was up at the plate

[01:21] They would refuse to say strike three they would refuse to say you're out pat launder you whiffed get out of the batter's box

[01:28] It's time for Eric Minier to try to hit a home run because you just whiffed at the plate

[01:34] It's just so comical seeing all these people trying to promote something they need to sell

[01:40] Because they're gonna be left holding the bag when demand dries up. All right. It's already dried up
