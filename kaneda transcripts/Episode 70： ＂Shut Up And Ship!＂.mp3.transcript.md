[00:00] F

[00:29] shut up and dance. Well not exactly dance but it is time at the end of the year that we all

[00:36] on the last day of this year that we all know has been probably one of the worst years

[00:41] in human history it seems like all of our childhood icons are dying off one at a time

[00:47] and everyone just wants this year to end. So I thought it would be fitting to do a new year's

[00:51] Eve, Canada's pinball podcast special where we just say all right the year is over it's time

[00:57] everyone just shut up about certain things and it's time manufacturers just shut up and ship

[01:04] their games in 2017 enough is already all right I'm super excited to do this podcast I just get

[01:11] back from Ireland Ireland's amazing for those of you who haven't been you have to go to go away

[01:17] it is like the shire on planet earth I mean everyone is like got like a hop it like spirit that

[01:23] is incredible and if you hear some panting in the background like that's not force flow from

[01:29] pinside just being disgusted with everything I say that's actually Bubba the 62 pound six-year-old

[01:36] bulldog that Brendan and I just adopt it and he's hanging out to my right net right now and I

[01:42] have to say this I didn't sleep at all last night because we made the mistake of letting Bubba

[01:46] sleep in the bedroom and he just snored like he was sawing logs for eight hours but hopefully he

[01:53] comes down and we can get him to sleep in the living room so why am I asking people to shut up well

[01:58] he I'll tell you why but before I do that I want to say one thing I got an email from one of my

[02:02] listeners and he said you know what Canada I love the podcast I love when you interview people but

[02:08] I really wish that you wouldn't go after certain individuals and wouldn't call people out by name

[02:14] he said I think that's like the Achilles heel of your show and I and he's like you should stay

[02:18] away from pinside the pinside drama and you should just talk about pinball and I and I replied and

[02:24] I said look you know this show the heart of it the very heart of what I do is I go after the

[02:31] pinside drama head on and I think I speak candidly about the drama and I think I also call out

[02:38] individuals when they need to be called out in fact I mean I will go on the record for saying

[02:44] I actually think canada was the best moderator on pinside because I balanced out the that vocal

[02:53] minority that just never shuts up in the in the different threads and it's it's like without

[02:59] canada's presence these guys get worse and worse and worse and I don't know if you've noticed it

[03:04] but ever since I stopped podcasting during the holidays those individuals have gotten more bold

[03:10] more frequent in their complaining and whining and and articulation of their un general

[03:17] unhappiness in the pinball world so we're we're gonna new people when we need to and if you don't

[03:22] want to hear that I tell people all the time there are so many podcasts out there that discuss

[03:28] pinball and I have to say I listen to almost all of them as frequently as I could over the break

[03:35] and man they bore me they bore me not all them there are a few really awesome ones

[03:41] but so many of them the two hours and taking forever to get into it and never talking about

[03:47] anything interesting uh you can have those podcasts guys this is always going to be a different

[03:52] podcast and look if you don't like it there are tons of other options but I hope you listen to this

[03:57] one and I hope you enjoy the other ones as well um but this one is just going to go about it

[04:02] differently so shut up and ship that was the title of this podcast I'm gonna broaden it to things that

[04:08] I think people just need to shut up about in 2016 uh because you know you get a new perspective when

[04:14] you step away from this hobby for a few months you get a new perspective when even you go to countries

[04:19] like Ireland where nobody even plays pinball you start to realize that man like what are people really

[04:24] bitching about and why are they bitching about this stuff so much so the first thing I want to talk

[04:30] about where it's just like enough is enough already is Batman 66 right you would have thought the

[04:36] world was ending when people say like oh Stern didn't ship Batman on time because it didn't come

[04:42] out in November and that's when the flyer said it would come out and when I see people bitching

[04:48] about Stern didn't ship Batman on time I'm like are you kidding me like Stern showed this pin

[04:56] at expo right mid-October people were shown the pin people had the pin in their homes

[05:05] in the third week of December just think about that for a minute in the third week in December

[05:13] between expo reveal and people physically having the pin was just a hair over two months

[05:21] and so I think in general everyone just needs to just cut Stern slack there the only pinball company

[05:27] that actually gets you games in a timely manner all right we're not going to talk about quality

[05:33] control and code right now but like at the end of the day if you don't physically have a machine

[05:40] you've got nothing you've got no chance for for for insert issues you've got no you know early code

[05:48] you've got jack shit and I'm so tired of Stern taking all these arrows from people who are supporting

[05:55] companies that deliver jack you know where the hell is rare heroes the big Lebowski as he got

[06:02] in it yet I mean come on these other companies two years plus and they trickle games out stop bitching

[06:10] about Stern and then Stern goes and says look we're gonna do a dead flip video with Jack danger George

[06:18] Gomez lineman sheets and mr. Sharp and we're gonna show you guys Batman but it was a little weird

[06:24] right that that came out after people were getting their SLEs which would seem to have like code

[06:31] that was even a little bit further along maybe not but we got to see it right we got we finally

[06:36] got the seed and it's something really interesting happens when we actually get to see a game flip

[06:42] you know because so many people complain and moan and groan about a pin and all these little things

[06:47] when you when it actually starts to flip something always happens there's like this weird silence in

[06:52] the community right there's like 15 pages before people see how the game is and then when the

[06:58] game actually is played like the comments slow down and I think that happens for a few reasons I

[07:04] think partly because the arbitrary haters finally see the game and it looks fun and then they don't

[07:12] have anything to go on right so it it weeds those people out then you get the people who actually

[07:17] get machines right the owners are getting them and I'm like I got my super early and I love it

[07:24] it's gorgeous it's incredible and they say two words that usually shut up all the complainers

[07:31] and the bitchers and the moaners and they say those two words are I'm happy I mean maybe that's

[07:37] three words but I'm happy right they're satisfied and so you have to then ask yourself well why are

[07:45] people who aren't even getting the pins so unsatisfied and yet the people who are buying them

[07:51] are super satisfied and I think in 2017 and I know this is the hardest request of all

[07:57] is if you're not getting the pin or you don't even want to buy the pin

[08:03] yes give us your give us your comments I look I don't think any forum or any community should ever

[08:10] say like you can't comment on something if you're not buying it because I think that's stupid

[08:14] I think that's stupid I hate when people say that but but if you make a comment about a game

[08:20] and you make your point don't make it 50 times and don't stay in the thread like don't control the

[08:26] thread that's about a game you're not going to get and I've said this before and I am I'm looking

[08:30] at guys like like I said it last time like Jeff Rivera man Jeff you're not even getting Batman

[08:36] but you're controlling the conversation in the thread that says Batman 66 impressions now what

[08:42] that thread is meant to do is give people yes maybe impressions of what they think the game is but

[08:48] for the most part impressions on what the game is like to play right once the game starts

[08:54] shipping I think it's just enough already with all of the bitching about like what your personal

[09:01] opinions are of the game that you're never gonna get you're never gonna get so I think we all

[09:06] here's my assessment about Batman 66 I think the game looks fun I think it looks fine what I always

[09:13] would I always feel like when I see like a dead flip video and I see a gameplay for the first time

[09:19] I'm always underwhelmed in general because I think we build up every new pin to be like the next

[09:24] best thing right and as these prices go through the roof and I look at a pin like Batman 66 I can't

[09:32] I can't say like oh that looks like it costs 10 grand or that looks like it costs 15 grand

[09:38] and that looks like it's more fun than this or that I I don't see it right I don't see

[09:43] mechanisms I don't see things happening on the pin that blow me away right so I could say look

[09:49] it's a little bit meh to me right I I nothing is happening in the pin that I haven't seen before

[09:56] none of the mechs seem magical and the big mech the crane we've seen before and then the rotating mech

[10:04] seems cool like a lot of potential there but it's not like wow like for me even seeing the ball go

[10:10] across the playfield and branch strokeers stokers Dracula is more magical than that rotating mech

[10:18] right the the magnetic flippers on ghost buses are more magical to me than that rotating mech

[10:25] but look I think it looks okay it looks fun I think the LCD is phenomenal for those people who are

[10:33] complaining about the LCD in this pinball machine I mean you should just get like permaband from

[10:38] from every form if you think the LCD on batman is not an improvement over the red dots and I

[10:43] saw people on the forum that were complaining that losing the dots is like losing a big part of pinball

[10:51] and it's like are you insane like this is what everyone has been asking for hoping for wishing for

[10:59] stern does it and I think it looks great in batman and then you have people saying dots are

[11:04] no effin way if ghost busters with its zombie Eddie art and it's beautiful beautiful I think like

[11:12] just total package had this LCD in it ghost busters would be you know one of the the biggest

[11:21] classics of all time the fact that it's got dots I think knocks ghost busters down and I think it

[11:26] puts batman as like the beginning of the new era of stern pinball and look I gotta say something

[11:32] here and I wasn't going to say this because I keep my I keep my trust with my contacts I've seen

[11:38] aerosmith I've seen a video of aerosmith and I'll say this to you guys right now aerosmith is

[11:44] incredible it looks like Metallica on crack aerosmith will have animations in it that you'll see more

[11:54] you call them dots no you're going to see animations of like the aerosmith characters on that

[12:00] beautiful screen you're not just going to see music video clips it's going to show you what this

[12:06] LCD can really do when it comes to animations and and and renderings of of the characters in the

[12:13] theme I think people are going to be blown away by aerosmith that's all I'm going to say on it

[12:18] it looks incredible all right I've seen the video of it being played and you're going to love it

[12:23] alright so batman bitching I think everyone is just needs to stop I think the demand is there for it

[12:28] alright what else what else is going on in the pinball world that I want to talk about so this thread

[12:35] just will never end and it's Kevin Koolik right so we have to talk about when we talk about shut up

[12:43] when is I don't know how to even deal with this topic you know in the right way but people

[12:51] need to shut up about the anonymous group that brought down Kevin's efforts to build predator for

[12:58] and just a quick background on on this story for people Kevin said he was going to build predator he

[13:03] got 250 people to pay money for predator and it turned out he didn't have the proper license now he

[13:09] was going to go ahead and make these games or attempt to make them but a group of individuals

[13:13] known as anonymous went and contacted Fox and let Fox know what he was doing to shut down the

[13:19] whole operation the way the story goes as I'm reading it is that these individuals after they

[13:26] knew that Kevin didn't have the proper license got refunds for themselves and for their friends

[13:33] but they did not let anyone else know about the refund so that made a lot of people upset

[13:40] but here's the thing you cannot blame the anonymous group alright they did what they did

[13:45] there was so much like there were so many red flags that people should have seen the pull out of

[13:52] predator and there's one guy and this is just amazing that he won't shut up and if all the people

[13:58] that need to shut up about it the one guy that was adamant that Kevin was going to make these

[14:04] games that Kevin had the license was wise snow he goes by wise snow on pinside his name is Hilton

[14:11] he is the one who convinced everyone to stay in to stay in to the end he was duped like everybody else

[14:19] but when all those red flags were going off he kept telling people stay in stay in and

[14:26] he just needs to stop talking I know now he's trying to bring Kevin down but at the end of the day

[14:32] this whole scenario is going to end bad for everybody involved there was a video that came out I

[14:36] don't know if you saw it but Kevin has just bought laptops for his kids for Christmas here's a guy

[14:44] who defrauded people of over 800 thousand dollars knows that there is a huge huge lawsuit against him

[14:52] declares bankruptcy and buys his kid laptop computers well that's what you get guys when you invest

[14:58] in a guy who dresses like a pirate who lives in his mom's like basement seems and was going to

[15:03] build predator inside his mom's kitchen and you thought that Fox and Arnold Schwarzenegger would

[15:10] hand over that license to a guy like that and you gave money to him the only people that you know

[15:18] besides Kevin that made a bigger mistake are the people who actually thought this guy was for real

[15:22] I mean everyone just needs to chalk this one up as the end run of pinball it's a total loss I hope

[15:28] people get their money back but I don't but I think people need to shut up and stop blaming the

[15:33] anonymous group there's no one to blame but Kevin and yes some of the blame needs to go to the

[15:39] shills that made people stay in when they could have probably got refunds I'm looking at you

[15:43] Hilton and I see I see you doing the same thing again I see you doing the same thing a little bit

[15:49] with highway of course highway is nowhere near like Kevin Coolick but we're gonna talk a little bit

[15:53] about highway when we talk about shut up and ship or I did because you know I think they're right

[15:57] in the crosshairs of that kind of comment all right well let's just go there let's just go

[16:02] there and and go right to alien pinball because when I was just thinking like well what I want to

[16:07] talk about this week and the whole notion that it's time for one manufacturer to just shut up

[16:15] already and ship the pinball machine and that is highway pinball and look we we are beyond the

[16:22] stage where this pinball machine should be finished now we did get some news finally we finally

[16:27] got to see what the replacement toy was for the queen airlock chamber right the that toy that sits

[16:34] to the left of the big head the xenomorph head is the queen airlock chamber the feedback from

[16:42] expo is that people didn't really like that that it the scale was wrong and it just looked like it

[16:47] overcrowded the space that should have been dominated by the head and so we kept hearing they were

[16:52] redesigning that toy and they were going to reveal something and when the big reveal happened

[16:57] I mean it's just funny it's just funny you know it's like here it is the toy the new mech the new

[17:04] magic that's gonna go in this area is wait for it drum roll another LCD screen and I don't know I

[17:14] kind of did like burst out loud laughing because I just think LCD screens and this is not just a

[17:20] knock against highways just like the own it's like the only way that these companies can think of

[17:26] like an innovative new thing to put on the playfield is to put another screen in it and it's like

[17:33] what like we already have two screens on highway pinball machines and now there's a third one

[17:40] and so when I saw it and it had this like really thick bezel and it it didn't do any favors in

[17:47] terms of putting more of the focus on the queen itself or the head itself it just looked tacked on

[17:54] and I don't know you know look I read the threads and I see the feedback goes both ways and I have

[18:01] to say this I don't think it's that great of a toy or a mech or that original and I and I heard

[18:07] from them how like all along they wanted this to be in the design and and now it's back in and

[18:14] they can use it in different ways to guide the player on what to do and they can also use it for

[18:20] like lighting effects and whatnot so fine and they're going to move it a little bit to the left

[18:24] and that'll help sort of with the scale and not take away so much of the tension from the big head

[18:30] I think that I don't know I just expect more I just expect more it's not just from highways from

[18:36] all these companies like when I just and I don't know we should have known better it's like they

[18:42] only had a couple weeks or a couple months to redesign this thing and it wasn't going to be

[18:47] this amazing new mech uh and and we'll see how it all comes together I think it's really hard

[18:54] to review this pin or to preview this pin because we don't even know like what's final like what is

[18:59] it final is this it and so when I say shut up and ship ready I really think highway pinball

[19:06] and Andrew and Orrick need to both just shut up at this point stop asking for feedback stop taking

[19:12] feedback stop telling us what your intentions are every like other day in December and just

[19:20] finish the pinball machine finish it finish it don't ask for feedback anymore because I think

[19:26] it's well past the point where this pinball machine is should be redesigned in in different ways

[19:34] and it's just it's just comical how is this not comical that a game that was promised to be out in

[19:41] April of 2015 then promised to be out in summer of 2016 then guaranteed to be shipping by Expo

[19:50] then guaranteed to be in people's homes by Thanksgiving then guaranteed they were going to be

[19:55] 30 in December then guaranteed a hundred in January it's still being designed and I it's like it's

[20:04] it boggles my mind and and and so I just think they should just stop talking stop talking until the

[20:12] game is done like when is it going to be done done and I I always like sit back and I ask myself like

[20:18] who even designed alien pinball the way these changes are being made with like is it

[20:24] from the committee is this what they want it is this a dentist Nordmann design the whole thing

[20:29] just seems like a mess and I'm going to give Andrew another piece of business advice and some people

[20:35] had said this in the thread Andrew you lead highway pinball the company's name is your name your

[20:42] vision your vision and the vision of your team needs to be what drives the way you design

[20:51] manufacture and produce and show and announce your machines you need to have a vision you need to be

[20:57] like Walt Disney you need to be like Steve Jobs you need to be a leader here and you need to stop

[21:04] being so anxious and insecure and nervous and always asking people for feedback and then telling

[21:10] everybody will take into into consideration what you say that's always his MO we're looking into

[21:17] that we're looking into that we're looking into no man start telling people this is how it's going

[21:21] to be to get this game done we're going to design it this way and that's that you know take it or

[21:27] leave it you know there are times and and and I don't agree with the tact because I don't think

[21:32] you should ever tell potential customers like this is it like fuck off if you don't like it but

[21:37] at least oric adopts that M.O. and has a little bit of that this is the machine like buy it or

[21:45] don't buy it right you're going to ultimately come to that point and I think highway needs to

[21:51] shut up and stop trying to please everybody right because then they start saying things that really

[21:58] make me be like does this guy even have a vision does he even like believe in his own system right

[22:06] his own system of like we're going to innovate pinball we're going to make you know swapable play

[22:12] fields we're going to make everything a wide body we're going to make the back box different

[22:18] and then when he says stuff like well we're also going to look at if making a highway pinball

[22:24] machine in a standard cab if the demands there will look into that when he said that I literally

[22:31] like I'm like wait if the demand is there you'll make a standard body cabinet for people

[22:39] what market research are you doing Andrew because every other pinball manufacturer on the planet

[22:47] uses standard cabinets in fact stern uses standard cabinets and they sell out in one day so it's

[22:54] clear that people really really really would rather have a standard dedicated alien cabinet versus the

[23:03] highway cabinet that really forces people to make compromises on the artwork and just the overall

[23:10] package because at the end of the day I think alien lovers want to have an alien pinball machine

[23:15] and that's it they don't want to swap in a full throttle and I don't know when you can even expect

[23:21] to see game three from highway pinball I mean years ago Andrew said they were going to have four

[23:26] games a year let's be honest we'll probably see alien pinball game number three if we ever see it

[23:34] like 20 2019 do you disagree all right so I think it's time for them to shut up and ship

[23:41] and and that's it and the question I think we all will be very interesting is do you think highway

[23:46] pinball is going to ship alien in January like alien alleys like the ones that people really want the

[23:54] ones that people put money in on are they going to be able to deliver in January I'm going to go on

[24:00] the record I don't think you're going to see alien Ellie ship in January all right this is

[24:05] canada December 31st I don't think that promise is going to happen I think there's going to be more

[24:12] delays and I and I I don't want there to be but I just have to go off of the track record that these

[24:18] guys talk so much I think we're going to have a lot more talking from them they're not going to take

[24:22] my advice these guys are not going to take my advice and shut up and just ship the pin and talk when

[24:26] it's ready to ship they're going to keep talking they're going to keep talking they're going to keep

[24:29] saying things about this and that and I think they need to just shut up and ship it all right what

[24:33] else is out there that I think people just need to shut up about this is like a like I'm trying to

[24:38] make this like a positive podcast where I'm also like you know articulating what people need to stop

[24:43] bitching about but it's like kind of ironic right because I'm like bitching about people bitching

[24:48] interesting but let's keep going with it Bubba's Bubba is searching for his bed right now Brenna

[24:53] just came home and is trying to could jol him into his bed the thing about bulldogs guys is they

[24:57] don't like do anything you want them to do like ever he doesn't even like cross the street he

[25:01] just stops in the middle of the street I'm like terrified he's gonna get hit by a bus all right

[25:06] dialed in collectors additions this pinball machine is you know this is it this is the final day you

[25:14] just have a few more hours to get your dialed in twelve thousand five hundred dollar collector's

[25:21] addition order in before the order banks close at midnight tonight and jack reveals to the world

[25:28] how many collectors addition dialed in he's gonna make and that's it that's this is the last time

[25:35] guys I'm gonna make this collector's addition until I make a different collector's addition six

[25:40] months from now we all know it's gonna happen we all know that jack is never ever going to stay

[25:48] true to his word when it comes to limited addition variations of his machines because he does it

[25:54] every time right oh yes the gold smoug addition that's it that's it boom we got the black arrow

[26:02] addition why you know the ruby red was was the ultimate like F you to the the emerald city

[26:09] addition people and it's amazing he took out like the wooden apron and and took out like a more

[26:15] valuable element of the game and charge more money but that's pinball guys it's pinball you're all

[26:19] gonna get fleece sooner or later and there's gonna be enough people out there that are gonna fall

[26:24] for it so the rumor now is that he sold one hundred collectors addition dialed in's if you believe

[26:32] that you know what I don't I don't think a hundred customers have bought it I bet distributors

[26:40] are putting probably half of the orders in without having consumer dollars but I don't think

[26:48] this one's a smart one to go in on and but here's the thing again within the within the realm of

[26:54] this is like the shut up people podcast why do people care of people buy it if someone wants to buy

[27:01] dialed in collectors addition for twelve thousand five hundred dollars let them let them do it

[27:06] who cares like I wouldn't do it with my money I don't I don't think that machine is gonna go up

[27:11] in value I don't think it's gonna hold its value but it's not my money there are really big pat

[27:17] lawler fans out there that really want a dialed in jacket and to have lunch with the dude it seems

[27:24] now you guys see like the features list and it's it's it's comical that we haven't seen what the

[27:29] collectors addition looks like like there was enough time since expo for jack to actually create

[27:35] that armor the top or the the side rails but none of it none of it's been seen so you're basically

[27:41] spending what three thousand five hundred dollars on top of a limited addition dialed in for

[27:49] stuff you've never seen for a number that's unclear I I wouldn't do it I wouldn't do it but I

[27:57] also think you know what let people do it let them do it and if someone comes on pin side and

[28:02] says like I just bought a collector's addition I love pat lawler don't don't berate the person don't

[28:07] call them all sorts of names you know we did that to everybody who bought super LEDs and and all the

[28:12] name calling that went on and at the end of the day people are happy they're really happy with

[28:18] their pinball machines but I really really really really think that you know manufacturers need to

[28:25] shut up with these like special editions that they can't even show you what it is before they

[28:28] ask for your money I think that's a terrible trend that happened in 2016 that we I hope that does

[28:35] not carry over into the new year you know so we'll see if I had a guess how many dialed in limited

[28:42] you know super additions like what are they dialed in collectors is sorry I get confused I would

[28:48] I would just I would say they're gonna come out and say they sold a hundred and twenty five

[28:52] like some some some specific number that they're gonna make and I think then you know if the

[28:58] supply is limited enough they're gonna hope to sell the remaining ones because you're gonna say

[29:02] look it's only one of one twenty five or whatever it is I just wouldn't do it all right people what

[29:07] else has been going on the forms that I can touch on in this podcast so did you guys see that

[29:12] story of the guy who like had a warehouse find of pinball machines and pencil being somewhere

[29:19] is a funny story this guy comes on he's like I've got a warehouse find and I don't know the

[29:23] thread was all over the place because he wouldn't share photos he wouldn't sell the games individually

[29:30] and people were just like attacking this dude left and right and and but it literally was like this

[29:34] guy was dangling you know a piece of meat in front of a pack of hungry sharks you know everyone

[29:42] thought like oh my god warehouse fine equals great deals on on pinball machines and it's just like

[29:48] that's like the warehouse fine not just in pinball but also in arcade collecting become synonymous with

[29:53] like just just just the most amazing prices and deals ever and there's no way this guy was gonna

[30:00] give people like warehouse find prices I mean it's pretty clear that he was like yeah I found a

[30:04] warehouse full of games and you know I'm gonna sell them at like market price no one was gonna

[30:08] get these incredible deals now but it was just funny that thread if you go read it it's just

[30:14] it's just everyone slamming him and him slam in the community and then he started another thread

[30:20] being like this community blows and then you know people were chiming in because like you blow and

[30:25] it was just it was like it's like really a great sort of like end of the year sort of

[30:31] pin-side thread where just everyone is just bitching about everybody and nothing is even moving

[30:38] like there's not even like a game exchanging hands there's not even people playing pinball there's

[30:42] just a bunch of moaning and groaning all right let's go on to one more shut up and ship so

[30:50] American pinball this one is really interesting I still see there was like they were putting fliers

[30:57] into some some distributors or pinball parts company had like a Houdini flyer that was going out

[31:05] it was like happy holidays from American pinball I'm gonna say this I'm gonna say this a lot of

[31:11] people won't shut up about American pinball they won't shut up about J-pop I get it people lost

[31:17] money people are waiting for games people don't believe these guys are for real it's December 31st

[31:24] I really think people are gonna be surprised by what they see by American pinball I can't go

[31:29] into all the details I think you're gonna see magic girl soon I really do and I think when that

[31:36] happens I think when that happens it's gonna be step one there's there's more steps to go

[31:42] for the rehabilitation or the convalescence of Mr. John Papadu Jr. but I think it will happen

[31:49] and and it's exciting you know I don't know like if the game's gonna be great this or that

[31:54] to work of art we all kind of agree on that and I think people want to see people get their games

[31:59] and I think we're gonna see that happen and I think you know it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting

[32:06] because I think a lot of people as much as they bitch and say they'll never do this never do that

[32:09] who Dini if who Dini comes out and it's got that beautiful artwork and it's got some magic going

[32:15] on that we know J-pop and ball circle can bring to games people are gonna buy it all the people

[32:23] who are moaning and groaning about it are gonna go in on it and I think it's gonna be a successful

[32:28] pin if they can hit the price point and get it out the door um I'm trying to think what else is going

[32:32] on in the pinball world at the end of 2016 that that I want to talk about if it left anything else

[32:38] out um I will do a separate podcast on my 2017 predictions I will go into what I think will happen

[32:47] I'm gonna do that soon because I think stuff is gonna happen in January that I want to make predictions

[32:51] on but I think at the end of this year I think we were like at this whole year in in totality

[32:57] you know not only has it been like a really sad year with like all the celebrities and

[33:01] pop culture icons dying and like the politics was so contentious this year I think you know with

[33:08] all the really really terrible shit that hit people hard pinball should be lighthearted pinball

[33:15] should be fun pinball should be a place we go where people uh you know have joy it's it's a

[33:22] product that's designed for kids to have joy and I have to say this it was shocking to me on

[33:28] Christmas day when I went on pinside and there was still the same people on Christmas day complaining

[33:36] about the same things in the same threads on Christmas day and it just goes to show that some of the

[33:44] people that are just addicted to being unhappy about pinball I think in this new years as people

[33:52] make their resolutions to just say hey like what do I like about this pinball machine let me share

[33:59] that if I have some concerns or some things don't make me happy let me share that maybe once maybe

[34:05] let me get my point across but maybe I don't need to dominate every thread with my negativity and

[34:12] maybe I don't need to you know constantly remind people that I'm unhappy with their purchase okay maybe

[34:19] I can actually support people who are happy and congratulate them when they get the machine they've

[34:24] been waiting a long time for right so let's try and do that because I think at the end of the day

[34:30] 2016 has showed us that the most important thing in life is your health right and we saw that with

[34:39] with George Michael with with with with Prince with Carrie Fisher you've got to take care of yourself

[34:45] guys and that is what I really hope and wish for everyone is a happy and healthy 2017 and when you

[34:52] look at life and when you look at the pathway to having a healthy life it's not just a physical

[35:00] thing it's a mental thing and all the negativity in the world and the people are constantly moaning

[35:06] and groaning about pinball man I feel to see how these people will ever have healthiness in other

[35:12] areas of their life and let's let's try and all just do a little bit better at that right let's

[35:18] let's all try and eat healthier let's all try and spend more time working out and exercising the

[35:24] amount of time people spend on pinside imagine if people spend that much time even just in our day

[35:31] exercising what a pinball expo would look like right we've all I've been to the shows and I have to

[35:38] say it's not exactly that the healthiest group of guys that are congregating and enjoying the

[35:45] product so look 2017 resolutions for everyone be more positive take better care of yourself and be

[35:54] more positive in your outlook right I mean the guy who inspires me who I I talked to a lot off

[36:01] of the form is is Bill Brandis the guy is incredibly positive he's got a great outlook in life he's

[36:08] super successful I mean he's got like abs of like a teenager it's crazy the guy that that's how

[36:15] I don't know about you guys but I always want to be like that as I get older I want to I want to be

[36:19] more positive I want people to be around me more and I want to be successful in and that doesn't

[36:25] mean like just money it means I want everything around me to have more of a positive sort of vibe to

[36:32] it right so that's canators wishes for all you guys in 2017 is let's look at all the bad behavior

[36:40] that we all do and let's try and like fix some of it it's not all gonna go away not everyone's

[36:45] gonna become just a cheerleader and in that world sucks to like we're not just all gonna be blindly

[36:49] support everything going on but let's have a good year and let's hope that everyone in 2017 just

[36:55] shuts up ships their pin and by the end of January people are playing alien people are playing

[37:01] Batman Ellie's and Batman premium people are playing magic girl you know people are actually

[37:08] playing the machines that they ordered that where hero gets his big Lebowski and let's learn

[37:14] from 2016 the ultimate lesson the ultimate lesson that nothing is real until it's in a real box

[37:22] let's stop chasing the hype in 2017 let's tell these manufacturers enough already if you want

[37:29] me to spend big bucks give me magic don't give me more LCDs all over the play field all right that

[37:37] is it happy new year everybody happy and healthy to you and your families I really appreciate all of
