[00:00] Strange things are happening to me.

[00:07] Strange things.

[00:12] CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA CELA

[00:17] Very strange things are happening to Canada these days. He takes a dream theme, Toy Story, he has a deposit on a collector's edition, $15,000, and I gave it up.

[00:29] And I want to explain on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast in a very calm and collected way why I gave up my collector's edition pre-order, if you will, for Toy Story 4 from Jersey Jack Pinball.

[00:42] And I've seen the debate. I've been involved with the debate. I've seen people say they love it. It's a masterpiece. I see people say it's a cash grab stripped down version of a Jersey Jack game.

[00:54] And here's what I want to do. I want to just give you my personal reasons from walking away from this game.

[01:00] I don't think it's going to totally surprise you, but I want to give you more clarity as I've calmed down because it did take me like a week just to process everything, to watch all the videos, to see people write about the game, you know, to hear what went into the making of it.

[01:16] I didn't get to play it. And I'm also going to talk to you about why I walked away from this pre-order before even playing the machine because I don't care how good it shoots.

[01:27] I'm going to give you my reason. I don't care how good it shoots. It's just not for me.

[01:32] The first thing I want you to do is I want you to close your eyes. I want you to close your eyes and imagine that I brought you into a room and said, I'm going to show you pinball machines that are based on different properties.

[01:43] And then I want you to open your eyes and I want you to tell me if this machine lives up to what your expectations and what your imagination would be and just simply what you would want the pinball machine to be.

[01:57] So the first game I walk you up to and say, here is the pinball version of Lord of the Rings. And then I walk you around the game. I show you everything. We play the game. We have an amazing time.

[02:07] I then take you over to this is the big Lebowski. Imagine everything in the big Lebowski movie. Here is the pinball machine. Here is the cool stuff they put into this machine. It's got a bowling alley.

[02:19] It's got a rug you bash and then it rolls out. It's got all the clips from the movie you love with all the voice actors in it. It's got a parking lot in which you bash the car from the big Lebowski.

[02:29] It's got this upper play field, right? It's got all this stuff that's super, super cool.

[02:32] Then I tell you to close your eyes and open them again and here's Jurassic Park. Now while this game does not have any of the movie clips, look at the T-Rex head in this game and what it does and see how awesome this game is.

[02:44] And then I say, here's Godzilla pinball. Look at this. You're Godzilla. You play as Godzilla. The building goes up and it goes down. The bridge collapses. There's Mechagodzilla. Look at all the interesting shots in this game.

[02:55] And then I tell you to close your eyes, open them and here's Guns N' Roses. Imagine if you're a Guns N' Roses fan and you see that pinball machine for the first time.

[03:03] And you see all the concert footage. You see the lights. You see the Les Paul guitar. You see the drumsticks. You see the drum set. You see everything from G&R World. You see this beautiful illustrated art package in the game.

[03:14] I think everyone is satisfied when they walk away from those games. I think everyone says they nailed it. Like this is what we want.

[03:20] And so then if I say to you, alright, now do you love Toy Story? Do you love Toy Story? Do you love the Toy Story movies? And people would say yes. Of course I love Toy Story.

[03:30] And then I say, open your eyes. Here's Toy Story Pinball. And you look down and you see the current game.

[03:36] Now the first thing is you're just going to have to get over the fact that this isn't the Toy Story anyone really wanted. Nobody. Nobody wanted four over the first three movies. Nobody.

[03:44] So we got the worst version of the movie franchise. We got the most recent installment of Toy Story. Toy Story 4.

[03:52] And in that movie, you just don't get all of the iconic stuff that we grew up with, the stuff we loved. It doesn't have all the characters.

[03:59] The storyline of the fourth one is just not nearly as good as the first movie. Because the first movie is the story of Andy's room and Buzz Lightyear and Woody.

[04:08] And how they have to go help get Buzz back. And how Woody was super jealous of this fancy new toy. And he gets pushed out the window.

[04:16] And Buzz Lightyear is this toy that thinks he's a real space ranger. It's just the most beautiful story. And the characters and the development of them, it's beautiful.

[04:25] And I have probably seen Toy Story 1 about 50 times in my life. 50 times. I've memorized lines from the movie. Every time I watch the movie, I get excited all over again.

[04:36] Now, when I saw Toy Story 4 in 2019, I enjoyed it. I didn't love it, love it. I didn't hate it. I thought it was okay.

[04:45] I thought the third film was all we needed, but I watched Toy Story 4 and I enjoyed it. But I never watched it again. I never wanted to watch it again.

[04:53] There are just those certain things. You might see it. You might enjoy it. But that might be it. You might be good. You might not want to watch it over and over again.

[05:00] It didn't leave an indelible impression on us. The same way, I will watch the Lord of the Rings movies over and over and over again, but I will never watch The Hobbit again.

[05:11] I don't care to watch The Hobbit again. It was entertaining. It was good. It made billions at the box office, but it wasn't a classic.

[05:19] That's the number one reason I'm walking away from this game. The number one reason is that Toy Story, while a dream theme for me, if it is only Toy Story 4, then it is not a dream theme for me.

[05:33] I can't do a podcast like this. I've got 680-something episodes where I constantly tell each and every one of you to be more discerning with your selections.

[05:42] I told you that what I'm going to do moving forward on a personal level is I'm only going to buy dream themes that are executed properly.

[05:52] I don't consider Toy Story 4 only to be a dream theme for me. Personally, and this is just my own personal feelings, I don't want to get over that.

[06:03] I don't want to accept it. I just don't want it. If it's Toy Story 4 and that's the game, I'm out. I'm out on just that front.

[06:14] Now, the other reason why it's really easy for me to walk away. After that fact, the second major reason why I just walked away, I don't think this game is worth $15,000.

[06:23] I was in on a CE. I don't think it's worth $15,000. That's it. I looked down at that game and I don't see a $15,000 product.

[06:35] I know many of you do. They sold a lot of them. The one I gave up, it sold immediately. Someone was waiting to get it.

[06:43] There is a waiting list to buy this machine at $15,000. From a licensing standpoint, I know people are saying it was so stupid to license just the fourth movie.

[06:55] They sold all of them. It's not a licensing mistake. Getting the Toy Story property was a really smart move by Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[07:03] They brought $30 million through the door on day one. The total sales of all of these games is something like $75 million if they make every single CE and LE of Toy Story 4.

[07:18] It was a good marketing move by Jack to get the Toy Story property. I also want to say this. I haven't played the game yet.

[07:24] I'm hearing mixed things about the game. Some people say it's amazing. It's so much fun. We know it's going to shoot well. It's a Pat Lawler game.

[07:33] We know that. Here's what I think. I think I'm going to jump on this machine and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm going to have fun.

[07:40] For the decades of my life in which I enjoyed Pimbal, I didn't think I needed to buy the Pimbal machines. I went into an arcade and I played the Pimbal machines and I had fun.

[07:50] That's exactly what I'm going to do with Toy Story. I can't wait to play it at Jack Bar. I can't wait to find one soon. Jump on it. Spend $20-$50 enjoying the game knowing that I don't need to spend $12,000 or $15,000 to own it.

[08:07] I know I don't want to own it because I just don't want Toy Story 4. I don't care how fun it is. I don't care how well it shoots. I don't care about the shot geometry. I just don't want Toy Story 4.

[08:20] The only thing that could have changed my mind is if I looked down at the game and I saw more value in it. This is really the hardest debate to have. This is the thing. Everybody.

[08:34] I mean it when I say it. This is a 100% subjective debate. There's no right or wrong. Nobody is wrong here. If somebody loves Toy Story 4 and wants to buy it and own it and sees the value, they're not wrong.

[08:48] The same way, I'm not wrong if I say I don't see $15,000 in this game. I see a more simplified stripped down version of Jersey Jack pinball machines.

[09:01] I think they realize now that Stern's model works. Simplify the games. Make them easier to understand and make them shoot better. Like create a game that is really fun to shoot.

[09:14] Almost every single Stern pinball machine is fun to shoot. Almost every single one. And then after it's fun to shoot, we get down to stuff like are there cool mechs and toys in it? Is the code awesome? Does it have a lot of replay value?

[09:29] But they always start out with a good theme that's got good art and it's fun to shoot. Now from that point, here's where it gets really subjective. How much money does fun equal to you?

[09:41] I'm going to use a car argument. I've used it before. The most fun car you can possibly drive is a Mazda Miata. It's lightweight. It's super fun. You feel like you're in a go-kart.

[09:53] But then how much would you pay for a Miata? Would you pay $30,000? Probably. Would you pay $60,000? No. Would you pay $100,000? Absolutely not.

[10:03] And that's where I'm at with pinball right now because it's like the price of these games is almost becoming just an arbitrary test of how high the ceiling will go in this pinball market.

[10:15] And I've been saying this for years. These pinball companies haven't even scratched the surface of the amount of money that's out there globally of the people who buy these things.

[10:26] All you need is a thousand people who want this bad enough and you could charge more than $15,000 and it doesn't mean you even have to put more into the game.

[10:37] And I think what Toy Story 4 is showing Jersey Jack Pinball is that I've been right all along about that part of the hobby.

[10:46] That these people have so much money now, they've been waiting to show you how much money they have.

[10:51] Because I do believe you have to be pretty damn well off to just wake up on a random day and plop down $15,000 on a pinball machine or $12,000 on an LE.

[11:04] And I don't begrudge anyone. I don't pretend to know anyone's financial situation. I don't pretend to know what you have in your checking account, what you got in savings, what you have in real estate holdings, what you've got in the stock market or crypto, hopefully not crypto, right?

[11:16] I don't pretend to know any of your backgrounds. I do know this. They sold. So what they did worked. I'm not angry about it. I'm not pissed off.

[11:27] I am just disappointed because I love Toy Story 1 so much and I'm allowed to be disappointed.

[11:34] Then they knew when they made Toy Story 4 only that it was going to be a bummer to all the people who grew up with the original movie.

[11:40] Like they knew that. And I don't know what went on with the licensing deal. I don't know if the first three movies were available or not. It doesn't matter. It takes years to make a game and they're not going to go back and make the original Toy Story.

[11:53] Perhaps Disney wanted it this way. I don't know.

[11:56] And here's the next part I'm going to say. I don't want to spend $12,000 to $15,000 on pinball machines ever. I don't think machines should be this much money.

[12:04] Sure, I spent $12,500 on Guns N' Roses CE because I loved them so much and I think Eric nailed it. But every single Jersey Jack game now is going to be this expensive.

[12:15] Every single Jersey Jack game now probably is going to have a thousand CE's at $15,000. And they're probably going to raise the price even more because these things sold on day one at this price point.

[12:28] Think about it. If they sold a hundred, they sold a hundred through JJP Direct, they sold out in three minutes. So think about that for a minute.

[12:36] You don't think they probably said we could have charged even more. We could have charged $16,000, $17,500, and they still would have went.

[12:43] And I've always said this. If you have $15,000, you've got $17,000. If you've got $17,000, you've got $20,000.

[12:50] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[12:58] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:06] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:13] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:21] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:27] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:33] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:37] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:43] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:49] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:54] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[13:59] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:03] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:09] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:14] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:19] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:24] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:28] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:34] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:39] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:44] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:49] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:53] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[14:59] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[15:04] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[15:09] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[15:14] That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get. That's not what you're going to get.

[15:18] They're loving the fact that they can charge this much for gameplay. They can charge this much for artwork.

[15:26] They can charge this much because of the theme. You're giving their engineering departments a real break because they don't have to design stuff that's magical.

[15:34] For $15,000, I need to look down at that game and see something equivalent to the castle and medieval madness.

[15:41] I need to see something like the disappearing magnets in Toten. I need to see something like the theater of magic, magic trunk.

[15:48] I need to just see something that's just a wow.

[15:52] If you put Twilight Zone, which was $2,700 back in the day, if you put that next to Toy Story in 2022 for $15,000, you see what I'm talking about.

[16:03] The fact that an LCD screen is taking up a huge chunk of the play field. That's not why I love Pimbal.

[16:11] I love Pimbal because it's analog. It's physical. If I wanted to play an iPad, I would just play Candy Crush on an iPad.

[16:19] I don't want to play virtual Pimbal on a physical Pimbal machine. There was a golden opportunity there to put a physical Ferris wheel.

[16:28] There was a golden opportunity to put the Pimbal machine from the movie. Physically make the Pimbal machine the toys are hiding inside of in the movie in the Pimbal machine and lock balls inside it.

[16:37] That's my thing is, no, there's none of that. It's not in there. They just made a game that shoots well and that is fun to play.

[16:45] That's great and I'm happy it's fun to play. I will take my $50 and I will play it on location. I will play it at friends houses. I will play it at shows.

[16:54] I will enjoy it and I'm sure I'll say, this game is fun. It's just not something I would spend $12,000 to $15,000 on.

[17:02] I also think from an investment standpoint, because we have to talk about this, I think if you get one, I really don't think these things are going up in value.

[17:11] In fact, the LEDs are not going to go up in value. The LED buyers are going to lose their shirt a little bit. With so many LEDs being made and another Jersey Jack game coming out in the winter, I think this game is going to have a short window of FOMO and then I think it's going to be over.

[17:26] I don't think it's going to turn into like stranger things where like a year from now everyone says it's the best game ever, but it's already so expensive.

[17:35] Remember, stranger things, LE was like $8,700. $8,700. This thing is almost double that, double that from the factory.

[17:44] So there's not a lot of room anymore for these games to go up and up and up. If they do go up in value, I think you're going to see with a thousand of them, I think these things, if they go up, I think maybe in the short of it, they're going to go up.

[17:56] In short term, right now you might see CES trading for maybe $17,500. I think like $18,000 would be the max, but I'm not flipping one. I didn't keep one to flip. I'm not trying to make a quick buck.

[18:08] I just walked away. I made somebody else very happy. There was someone who loves this movie. He like loves Toy Story 4, like makes forky toys with his kids and he found out from Joe Newhart that Canada gave up his and it's yours now and he's super happy.

[18:24] I was happy to pay it forward. I didn't fleece the community and I'm glad it's ending up with a real diehard Toy Story 4 fan, which I understand. Like if you love this movie, you're in. You're in on it.

[18:37] And I just don't love the movie. I just don't think this was the Toy Story movie that I'm fond of and the one I go back to.

[18:44] Look, I'm also like a little bit bummed out because my expectations were so high, but now we can get back to talking about the rest of the hobby.

[18:49] You know, lately it's been like, let's just talk about Haggis. Then we built the hype up for this game and now what? Right? It's middle of June. What's happening in Pimbal?

[18:59] Well, there's a lot of other stuff happening and I will start covering that more on future shows. For example, Spooky Pimbal, the rumor is that Scooby-Doo is coming from Spooky Pimbal. That's exciting.

[19:09] Spooky needs a hot title to get things back on track. I saw that there's an Ultraman new inbox. I think for like $6,890. That game is just heading south and south and south.

[19:25] Yes, I'm walking away from my deposit. I'm not sending them a check for $8,000. That's not happening.

[19:31] Damien is telling all the series ticket holders that they will have their games by the end of the month. So that is two weeks. Don't have me cue the Andrew Highway two weeks phrase, but he's telling them in two weeks they'll have their games.

[19:44] I hope that happens. I haven't really been following Haggis over the last couple of weeks. I keep popping into the thread and I don't see any unboxings. That's it. I just don't see unboxings.

[19:54] So if stuff is happening, I hope so. We just haven't seen it. And if he's promising people by the end of this month, you know what Damien? I'm having a great vacation. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

[20:06] I won't rag on you for two weeks, but if no games are unboxed by the end of June, yes, I will make fun of you again for missing more deadlines.

[20:15] And then it's quiet, right? It's quiet. Like people are waiting for their cactus Canyon Lees. There's absolutely no momentum over at American Pinball. And what else is happening? Are weird owls being made? No, we're still in this like suspended state.

[20:29] But I want to say this. I do want to congratulate Jersey Jack Pinball for making what I'm hearing is 300 Toy Story Lees were made when they revealed the game. So that is awesome. And I think they're doing it right.

[20:45] And they're getting the games on location into homes the very week they announced the game. Super cool. And I want to say congratulations on getting that achievement done.

[20:52] And I also look forward to seeing how the playfields hold up because Mirko made them. And so Mirko's had playfield issues on every Jersey Jack launch. And so if these are holding up well, that's a good thing.

[21:06] Are there washers on the post? I haven't seen anyone walk around it yet. I need to look if there's a video of that. So hopefully these playfields don't start falling apart. Because if that happened, I just don't want to see this company go through that again.

[21:19] And then we're going to get to like Stern's next title coming up real soon. Like I don't think it's going to happen in August. I think it's going to be sometime in the fall. But you know what? It's the summertime.

[21:31] You should be spending time outside with your families. You should be traveling. I always say this. Pinball is a winter sport, people. Don't spend the beautiful days you have on planet Earth locked in your basements playing pinball too much.

[21:45] Do that in the winter when the weather is cold and crappy. Okay. Everybody, thank you so much for the support. Thanks for hanging in there. I know I've had some really candid and livid like Facebook lives.

[21:57] But I'm trying to just be a little bit more even keel on this stuff because I love pinball. I had high hopes for this game. It didn't deliver. So guess what? I just won't buy it. I'll wait for something else that speaks to me more.

[22:11] And the good thing about this hobby is there's so many companies making so many games and I can wait. I don't have FOMO anymore. I really don't. I look at Killian and I look at Brenda and I have everything I want in life. I do. I have everything.

[22:26] You could take away my demon. You could take away my Gucci. You could take away my guns and roses pinball machine. But as long as I have my family and the people I love, I don't need this stuff.

[22:36] But boy, is it fun covering this hobby and I'm so happy you're a club member and all of your support means so much to me. So thank you so much. We're now at like 523 subscribers. We're holding strong, which is great.

[22:49] And I'm happy to do these shows for you on a weekly basis and I still think this is the best version of Canadian. I mean, I love my Facebook lives. I love it. But this, this always is the thing I love doing the most.

[22:59] Have a great day, everybody. A great weekend and we'll be back next week with more episodes of Canadian Spinball Podcast.
