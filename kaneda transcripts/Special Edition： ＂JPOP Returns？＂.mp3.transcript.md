[00:00] Here's Johnny!

[00:02] I'm just not equipped to handle all this pinball news.

[00:13] It keeps happening like every hour.

[00:15] I need like a staff, I need like a team, I need people to help keep me in the loop because

[00:21] here we are in one day we're putting up our third Canadian pinball podcast.

[00:26] Don't say I don't love you guys, don't say I don't get you the information as it's

[00:30] breaking on this podcast.

[00:31] So oh my god, out of nowhere tonight, a press release gets posted on Pinside that indicates

[00:40] that American pinball is going to release a game called Harry Houdini.

[00:47] And we all know who is been working with American pinball no other than Mr. J-Pop, John

[00:55] P-Pop, what do we do?

[00:58] There's so much going on inside my head around this.

[01:02] I've already been banned on Pinside for duplicate accounting and sharing the news.

[01:07] And it's just funny watching these guys, they accuse every new member being Canada and

[01:11] I can guarantee you a few of them actually will be.

[01:14] But it's crazy this press release, I need to just read it for those of you who haven't

[01:18] seen it yet.

[01:20] It says American pinball to launch its first pinball machine at the global gaming expo in

[01:26] Las Vegas on September 26th.

[01:29] September 26th, that's like, what is that, that's Monday, all right?

[01:33] Let's like four days from now we're going to see this thing.

[01:36] It says American pinball manufacturer of arcade games and amusement is excited to announce

[01:40] the worldwide release of Houdini.

[01:43] Master mystery pinball machine for the home arcades, gaming centers, and magic collectors.

[01:49] The unveiling will take place September 26th at the Venetian Las Vegas Hotel on the

[01:54] eve of G2E, the global gaming expo.

[01:56] Okay, is anyone in Las Vegas, you need to go and see this thing.

[02:01] I don't know if it's vendors only, but we need to get photos of this thing.

[02:06] Let's see, so I just want to read this.

[02:09] I want to read it and I want to give some thoughts on it and then I'm sure we're going

[02:12] to not stop hearing about this forever.

[02:15] This in the mecca of the pinball universe just outside Chicago, Illinois, American pinball

[02:19] features a team with decades of industry experience and is launching its first pinball machine

[02:25] under the name Houdini for several reasons.

[02:30] Known as a masterful magician and Harry Houdini is considered the greatest magician, conjurer

[02:36] and escape artist there ever was, captivating audience is worldwide with his legendary

[02:41] escapes and shows was his specialty.

[02:43] The Houdini pinball will carry on that magical tradition as a beautiful crafted pinball machine

[02:49] featuring one of a kind pinball theater experience with an LCD color screen and patented cabinet.

[02:55] Right there, I mean we're starting to see patented cabinet LCD screens and on their Facebook

[03:00] page, which everyone should go join.

[03:04] They actually talk a little bit more about it how the screen is in the back of the cabinet.

[03:08] Who else had a screen in the back of the cabinet?

[03:10] Alright and then the press release goes on to say with a quote,

[03:13] who denies escapes illusions and handcuffed challenges are world renowned even today and

[03:18] formulate the basis of our inventive new pinball machine.

[03:23] Said president of American pinball, I don't know how to say his name,

[03:27] double, the Hable, the Hable, the Hable, or Houdini master mystery pinball machine would bring

[03:32] the man back to life with supremely detailed hand drawn game artwork, inventive ball tricks,

[03:38] brilliantly illuminated play surfaces and spirited devices while featuring all the classic

[03:43] pinball features like action jet bumpers, multi level ball stages, sculpted magic toys,

[03:48] secret escapes and much more.

[03:50] American pinball has also added a performance of new Houdini features to amaze players

[03:54] including the floating ball, the water torture cell, levitating bumper, the bullet catch,

[04:01] indunido trick, spear box, buried, alive, sarcophagus, lock chambers, magic beasts, the

[04:07] saiyans, milk can escape and Jenny the vanishing elephant, Houdini master mystery pinball transforms

[04:14] under the hood as well with the newest game motherboards created by award winning gigabyte

[04:19] technology to drive all of Houdini's pinball effects, full color graphics, sounds, gameplay,

[04:24] music, explain the scene.

[04:27] Wow.

[04:28] And then the next comment on that pin slide thread says hi, canada.

[04:32] Hey guys.

[04:33] Yes.

[04:34] Whoa.

[04:35] Right.

[04:36] I mean, it's like take a seat, take a five deep breaths and let's just talk about this.

[04:44] I am first of all, I am not in any way shape or form affiliated with American pinball with

[04:50] this machine at all.

[04:52] I know that there is a pedigree of me having given John some marking ideas for magic girl

[04:58] and that is true, but that is all I did.

[05:01] I did not give anything towards this machine.

[05:04] I have to add that after seeing this, I saw some emails from American pinball and I reached

[05:09] out to them and they have confirmed for me and I broke this news on pin slide even though

[05:13] they removed my statement of who it came from that this game is going to cost $6,995.

[05:21] So 7 grand and it's going to be playable at expo.

[05:24] They sound like this game is ready to go.

[05:28] Holy shit.

[05:31] The most crowded expo in the history of expo's with reveals now has another reveal making

[05:38] this so interesting.

[05:40] I am so happy.

[05:41] I booked my West in hotel tickets months ago because this is just getting at it.

[05:49] I would have even been surprised if Kevin showed up with experts of dangerous expo or

[05:59] Von E.D. whatever his name showed up with his game and all of the games are arriving at

[06:05] one.

[06:06] So let's tackle this from a few angles.

[06:10] This is just an impromptu podcast.

[06:11] I wasn't expecting to do this.

[06:14] The first and foremost, what do we think about J-Pop returning to design a game that might

[06:19] come out?

[06:20] What does that mean for the people that got screwed for Zidware?

[06:25] I think it sucks.

[06:26] I think everyone feels bad for the people who gave John money and lost money but it's

[06:31] also at some point what are we going to do?

[06:37] What are we going to do?

[06:38] Everyone can decide what to do with their wallets.

[06:40] Here's my hunch.

[06:42] So J-Pop, the people they have burned by Zidware are what?

[06:46] A hundred people.

[06:47] There are far more collectors than people who got burned by Pimbal.

[06:51] Now I have to imagine that these American Pimbal guys are smart enough to know that if we

[06:56] do something with this guy, it is going to be toxic.

[07:00] The response by the community is going to be toxic.

[07:03] People are going to be pissed off and we are going to come out of the gates behind, very

[07:10] far behind, in the court of public opinion.

[07:14] Is it like Jared from Subway launching a new sandwich line when he gets out of jail?

[07:19] I don't think it's that bad.

[07:21] But I also don't think you're going to find many people who there's more anger, hatred

[07:28] and frustration with more than John Papaduke.

[07:32] I think Kevin Koolik and not many other people have really stolen people's money or fallen

[07:40] on their promises.

[07:42] What does this mean?

[07:44] I think J-Pop has always been hard for people to see him go down the way he did because

[07:50] the guy's got potential.

[07:51] There's no denying that.

[07:52] As a Pimbal designer, whenever I play my Tales of the Arabian Knights, I can't help

[07:56] but look down and be like, this guy really has a different approach to Pimbal that's

[08:02] unlike anyone else's.

[08:04] That's why I think people have always held his games in high esteem because they are

[08:08] unlike anyone else's designs.

[08:10] I think other designers out there are pretty cookie cutter, other designers out there.

[08:17] Do struggle to always have like, that's their signature sort of look and feel.

[08:24] Not all.

[08:25] Not great designers too.

[08:26] I'm not taking away anything from other designers out there.

[08:28] There's not that many designers.

[08:30] I'm not really specifically shitting on anyone.

[08:32] But you have to admit that J-Pop has a very unique design aesthetic.

[08:38] He's obsessed with magic.

[08:40] We know that American Pimbal applied for the trademark on Houdini.

[08:44] I think we have to put all questions of whether this is real or not to bed.

[08:50] It's real.

[08:51] It's going to happen.

[08:53] It's been pretty much confirmed by people at American Pimbal.

[08:56] I'm satisfied.

[08:57] I think it's with their answer.

[08:59] I think it's going to happen.

[09:02] I think it's going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.

[09:06] We've never seen a Pimbal machine come out by a designer that has gone through what J-Pop

[09:13] has gone through.

[09:14] We've never seen that ever.

[09:16] How people will respond is going to be really interesting.

[09:20] Here's how I think people are going to respond.

[09:22] This is just me speculating, a good old Uncle Canada is going to get on his soapbox and tell

[09:28] you what he thinks.

[09:29] I think you're going to get pressure from the Compenside community and people who got

[09:34] burned and other people who, for a very good reason, you shouldn't fucking touch this

[09:41] thing.

[09:42] You should not let him rebound from what he did.

[09:46] This is going to be one very vocal community that speaks out against this pin.

[09:54] You're going to get people who say, I didn't get burned by J-Pop.

[09:57] I know it sucks.

[09:58] I feel bad for people, but I love his games and I'm interested to see what this is about.

[10:03] You're also going to have people that may not even been aware of the Zidware Fiasco.

[10:08] Those are people that are not on Pimside, but again, people who buy Pimbal machines, not

[10:12] everybody's aware of all this stuff.

[10:15] Even when John was doing his stuff for years, I was always surprised when I went to expose

[10:19] and I would talk to people about Magical.

[10:22] There were people who never heard of it.

[10:23] Other people, I think I heard something.

[10:25] If you're not on these forms every day following these tales, then you're not going to feel

[10:33] like as connected to it.

[10:36] Doesn't make it any less shitty for those people who got burned.

[10:41] I was wondering, is American Pimbal going to, if they come forward with this game, obviously

[10:46] they have no obligations to write the wrongs of Zidware?

[10:50] I was like, are they going to offer people who got burned by Zidware like a special deal

[10:54] to maybe win over some of the community who might be really upset?

[10:59] I don't know.

[11:00] I can't see them doing that.

[11:03] It just depends.

[11:05] You're a new company.

[11:06] You need to make money.

[11:07] You need to survive.

[11:08] It's really hard.

[11:11] What do you do?

[11:13] Their game is $69.95.

[11:15] Magical was $16,000.

[11:17] Razza was $10,000.

[11:19] All the J-Pop games were much higher priced.

[11:23] I'm also just really interested in, or find it interesting, the price of this thing.

[11:29] $7,000.

[11:30] All of a sudden, now, that's like the cost of what is Stern Premium, but now the premiums

[11:38] with Batman are $8,000.

[11:42] It's very, very, very, very, very competitively priced.

[11:47] Maybe that's their strategy.

[11:50] John Burn people on these super-booty games were not going to fall victim to that silliness

[11:53] of LEDs and super-limited titles.

[11:56] We are going to offer this game for far less, making it approachable for people.

[12:03] Is that going to be a way to get people to feel better about it?

[12:08] I don't know.

[12:09] I don't know.

[12:10] Again, I don't really even know how I feel.

[12:12] I'm sitting here looking at my Tales of the Rabie and Knights, and I wonder what a new

[12:18] J-Pop machine will look like.

[12:20] We all know what Magic Girl was.

[12:22] Magic Girl was a mess.

[12:23] The game was a mess.

[12:25] The art by Jeremy was beautiful, but I saw it flip the way the rest of you did.

[12:32] The game sucked because I think he just didn't progress it properly.

[12:39] Here's where it gets interesting.

[12:40] Someone said this on the pin side.

[12:42] J-Pop working with a real company, a team around them, to get him to finish lines and

[12:50] deadlines and pushing him to make the machine happen.

[12:56] Him just being the designer.

[12:58] That's all he is.

[12:59] He's a designer.

[13:00] He's on a builder.

[13:01] He's on a manufacturer.

[13:02] He's a designer.

[13:03] He's a creative.

[13:04] He needs people around him to execute.

[13:06] If he's surrounded by a team of industry veterans who know how to execute, and I'm also

[13:09] like, who are these people?

[13:11] Who are they?

[13:15] Then it's possible.

[13:17] I think we're past the point of speculating if it's possible.

[13:21] I think it's happening.

[13:25] What is going to happen?

[13:27] What is going to happen at Expo this year?

[13:30] I really thought like Stern is throwing his huge gala and their plans to show everyone

[13:37] fuck it.

[13:38] This is what we can do.

[13:40] They must also be scratching their heads like who the fuck are we even getting in the

[13:44] ring with?

[13:47] In Stern's head, before this week, before two days ago, Stern is getting in the ring

[13:55] to just basically blow highway out of the water.

[13:59] Stern is getting in the ring to basically blow the hobbit out of the water.

[14:03] Stern is getting in the ring to maybe blow P3 out of the water and Stern is getting in

[14:07] the ring and they don't blow spooky out of the water.

[14:10] They've designed a game that they feel is going to do that.

[14:15] They've priced at a level that makes me believe they are very confident that this machine

[14:20] will deliver and exceed those other titles and companies I just mentioned.

[14:27] All of a sudden now, two more people are getting in the ring, two more people, Pat Lawler

[14:34] and John Papaduke are stepping into the ring with Stern.

[14:40] This is fucking incredible.

[14:43] This Expo is going to go down as the greatest royal rumble of all Expo's.

[14:50] The three Titan designers are going head to head.

[14:58] George Gomez, Pat Lawler and John Papaduke are all showing and you could throw in Dennis

[15:08] Nordman for Alien, kind of right?

[15:12] Holy shit, who will win?

[15:14] Who will win?

[15:17] There is going to be a lot more to come on this.

[15:19] The pin side is going to explode.

[15:22] People are Iceman is going to pull people in one direction.

[15:27] J-pop fans are going to pull people in another and you know what?

[15:32] I don't know what to even fucking think about it.

[15:34] I'm sitting here in my apartment.

[15:37] I'm kind of just exhausted by it all and I'll tell you why.

[15:41] I think what's happening now is...

[15:44] And I predicted this.

[15:46] I want to go back to Canadian's pinball episode, whatever.

[15:49] I said there's going to be like eight new unboxed machines that are going to try and

[15:52] come out in 2016 and it's going to be too much and it's going to like put too much weight

[15:58] on the hobby and all of a sudden it's going to feel exciting and overwhelming at the

[16:02] same time and there's going to be winners and losers.

[16:04] But here's the thing.

[16:05] Here's the thing.

[16:07] What's happening now is just left over baggage from 2014 because remember, not even 2014,

[16:17] like 2012.

[16:19] Once the boutique pinball thought became a reality.

[16:26] Right?

[16:27] Once someone who was in a major company went out there and said, I'm going to take your

[16:31] money and I'm going to build you a boutique pinball machine and I am going to deliver you

[16:36] a limited number boutique machine that's going to be unlike anything out there.

[16:42] It's not going to come from Stern and look at where we are now, right?

[16:47] AJP started it but Jay Pop was really the one that showed the market, what the market

[16:54] could bear, the $16,000 very limited game sold out.

[17:00] All these titles, John Papadouk's title, alien we've been waiting on it for like two

[17:06] years now.

[17:09] In a home pin we've got Pat Lawler's game feels like it's three, four years in the

[17:14] making.

[17:15] All these rumor titles are now coming out at the same time.

[17:23] It'd be like Harry Potter, Star Wars, Avatar, Jurassic World are all hitting theaters this

[17:30] December.

[17:31] That is what it feels like and as excited as I am because here's why every pinball collector

[17:38] should be excited and should hold on to their monies because you are going to have more

[17:44] options come this December than ever before.

[17:48] Why would you rush the preorder anything?

[17:52] That's where I think everybody's got to be worried but Stern.

[17:58] I say but Stern because Stern's machine is moving and they're selling machines and they're

[18:04] selling like ten titles are available.

[18:07] I'd be so nervous if I was Andrew Highway now, even Jack, even because it didn't

[18:13] today boutique money is boutique money and people are not going to buy four machines

[18:21] this winter, this you know in first quarter of 2017 they can't afford to and what's exciting

[18:29] about it is that I think preorders are going to be dead because no one's going to rush

[18:36] to buy because of all the volume of the new stuff which is great because what we're going

[18:40] to get back to it almost feels like the fucking 90s again you've got ten pinball machines

[18:45] coming out.

[18:46] It's almost like our kids are healthy you know replaced by the home collecting market but

[18:51] now it's going to happen is the games that people are going to rush to are going to be

[18:55] the ones that are good, the ones that are really fun, the ones that earn, earn the attention

[19:03] right.

[19:04] They earn the title of being an amazing pin a collectible rare one.

[19:11] It's really ironic that this is happening in the exact moment Stern's releasing a $15,000

[19:18] super LE.

[19:19] Stern is pricing a pin at where magic girl is at and J-pop's coming in at a price where

[19:24] Stern used to be at with its premiums.

[19:26] They have traded fucking places.

[19:29] It's blowing my fucking mind.

[19:31] The whole fucking hobby has been turned upside down and I don't know where it's going to

[19:36] go.

[19:37] It's anybody's guess.

[19:38] I'm sure guys like the black night people have watched this hobby for 20 years are probably

[19:43] just like all fucking bets are off.

[19:47] May the best pin win?

[19:49] May the best pin win.

[19:50] If people lost money I still feel bad for you.

[19:53] I hope you get your money back.

[19:55] I don't know.

[19:56] I just think that in three weeks I look forward to seeing so many of you having drinks and

[20:02] playing all these machines and letting us make up our minds on where we want to spend

[20:07] our money.

[20:08] I don't think American pinball is going to parade John around the show.

[20:12] I think they're going to put new people in front of it and I think they're going to

[20:17] really talk about the process to get this machine made and you know they went with the

[20:22] guy that they know is impopular but sometimes you know I don't think there's any denying that

[20:28] is kind of like a design pinball design genius.

[20:32] You could put on one hand the guys on planet earth out of what eight nine billion people

[20:38] that are pretty above the fold when it comes to designing pinball machines and you have

[20:43] to put J-pop in that list.

[20:46] Crazy fucking news.

[20:47] Crazy day.

[20:48] I'm exhausted.

[20:49] I'm going to go watch the Patriots play the Texans.

[20:52] This has been Canadian Special Edition.

[20:55] John Papa Duke returns.

[20:57] Talk to you guys soon.
