[00:00] You'll never find your goal, you're not a sandy beach.

[00:05] You'll never dream for a lawyer, on a city street.

[00:14] All right, so our Rick and Morty journey continues.

[00:18] On this sort of like third installment, the end of the trilogy of Canada's review of Rick and Morty

[00:26] Pimball, I want to put a little bow on this chapter.

[00:30] So as you know, I went to Jack Bar, I played the game, and I thought the game was one of the

[00:36] best theme integrations I've played in Pimball history.

[00:40] I was very frustrated with some of the shots off the upper right flipper.

[00:45] Scott Nenecey reached out to me, we spoke about it.

[00:48] You heard about our conversation, and you heard from him on Canada's Pimball podcast.

[00:52] Now there was only one thing left to do.

[00:55] There was only one thing left to do, and that was to implement the things that Scott Nenecey

[01:01] is talking about on how to make this game shoot better from the upper right flipper.

[01:06] And what's happened over the last like 12 to 24 hours is Scott Nenecey and John from Jack Bar,

[01:13] they were talking about things to try.

[01:16] And what I did today was I talked to John, I said, how did your conversation with Scott go?

[01:23] Have you implemented the changes to the game and have they worked?

[01:28] And I know that's what everybody who has a rick and morty on order wants to know,

[01:32] can we make this game better than the clunk fest we've seen in some of these streams?

[01:39] And the big point is this, it's not about the shot being hard to hit.

[01:44] It's that when you do hit the shot right, nobody wants it at that point and clunk out.

[01:50] And that's the main thing.

[01:52] If you hit it and it should go, if you don't hit it right, that's on you, the player.

[01:57] I want to air for you my conversation with John at Jack Bar on what he did do his game and if the

[02:03] game is playing better because of it. So let's air that right now.

[02:07] All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is like a rick and morty trilogy.

[02:10] First, canada goes to Jack Bar does a review.

[02:13] Then canada in the second part of the trilogy talks to Scott Nenecey about the game and how to

[02:19] adjust the shots. The third part and the final part of this trilogy is adjusting in actual

[02:24] game to see if it plays better. I have John from Jack Bar joining the show after he spoke to Scott

[02:30] Nenecey about adjustments to the game. John, welcome back to Canada's pinball podcast.

[02:35] Thanks for having me.

[02:36] Now, you know, I have to congratulate you on your wedding this week.

[02:39] You got engaged or proposed, not in case you proposed on the show and the wedding was this week,

[02:43] right? To Morgan on Friday.

[02:46] Yeah, and our due date for our first child is actually today.

[02:49] I'm sitting here talking to you and I got a baby coming this week.

[02:52] Yeah, what do you do it?

[02:55] Get to the hospital.

[02:57] Well, congratulations. I know you're super excited.

[03:00] So, thanks.

[03:01] First and foremost, let's put all of the rumors to rest that I was not at Jack Bar for a while.

[03:07] I was there. Bren and I for a good amount of time, correct?

[03:11] Oh, for sure. You were here for at least two hours and you did most of the playing.

[03:14] You and Brenda both played, I played maybe four or five games.

[03:18] So you guys got probably a good 20 games in each.

[03:22] Yeah, it was super fun.

[03:24] And so you had the machine now for three weeks.

[03:27] So up into this point, talk to the listener of the show because I think a lot of people are

[03:32] opening up this game.

[03:33] New inbox might experience what you did before the tweaks.

[03:36] What were the issues you were having with the upper flipper shot?

[03:40] Well, the shots were, they weren't working.

[03:44] You know, I know they're designed, Scott wanted them to be difficult.

[03:49] And they are difficult by nature.

[03:51] But it wasn't about the timing or the ball not entering the entrance to the shots.

[03:56] It was the ball, like for instance, with the upper loop with the spinner.

[04:00] Even when the ball entered the entrance of the shot,

[04:03] it would rattle around.

[04:05] It wasn't even making contact with the spinner.

[04:07] It would just bank off of the rail and rattle side to side and fall right back out.

[04:12] So it wasn't about the player not playing well enough.

[04:17] It was about the shot not working.

[04:19] Right.

[04:20] For whatever reason, the geometry of it was off.

[04:23] I'm not saying from design, but for whatever reason, out of the factory, it just wasn't working properly.

[04:29] And that's coming from somebody's playing his whole life.

[04:32] Right.

[04:32] Yeah, I mean, you're a much better player than me.

[04:35] So part of the reason I want to have you on is you add a level of credibility to this kind of feedback.

[04:41] And so I experienced the same thing.

[04:44] The ball, it's not about timing it right off the flipper.

[04:47] Because I know we talked to Scott about that.

[04:49] Because even if you're hitting it and the trajectory is heading perfectly towards

[04:56] the spinner shot, it was hitting like the guardrail and sort of just like coming to like a dead

[05:02] rattle stop.

[05:02] Right.

[05:03] And so yeah, it was hitting a wall basically.

[05:06] Okay.

[05:06] And so last night Scott hit me up and I know he hit you up.

[05:11] Now, it seems that people are having great results from a few tweaks to the game.

[05:16] Now, I'd love for you to share with us sort of the kinds of things Scott recommended you try.

[05:22] And and then we'd love to hear your feedback on the game today.

[05:25] Because I know you've played it more after making the tweaks.

[05:28] So what kind of stuff did he, did he recommend trying?

[05:31] Well, he actually recommended a bunch of stuff that wasn't on Pinside.

[05:35] I don't know if this is stuff that he recently learned or figured out or thought about.

[05:40] But none of this was on Pinside.

[05:42] Well, yesterday when it was being discussed on Pinside,

[05:46] somebody mentioned that there was a set screw for the guard for the guide rail for the guideline.

[05:51] And it could be there was quite a bit of movement for it,

[05:55] which I didn't realize was there was under a plastic right there.

[05:59] So that gave some, you could change the the angle of that rail quite a bit.

[06:08] And but what Scott pointed out that I hadn't realized was if you take out two of the guide

[06:17] screws where you know the 90 degree tab comes off of the guide and screws into the play field.

[06:25] If you actually take those screws out and leave them out, it gives it a little more flexibility

[06:30] and allows it to bend a little more natural where out of the factory when it was screwed down

[06:36] was more of a flat spot. So it was hitting like a 90 degree wall.

[06:40] The ball would just bang off of it.

[06:42] And instead of like the guide catching it and kind of like allowing it to fluidly roll up it.

[06:50] Right now that I took those screws out, it's made a tremendous difference.

[06:54] Right. So it gives it a little bit more give elasticity to the metal.

[06:59] So when the ball hits it, it's sort of creating a bounce off it versus just a dead stop.

[07:04] Now did you have to bend at all the the guide?

[07:10] Only at the screw that the screws that I left in like for instance, one of those

[07:16] was the one at the very entrance, which obviously needs to be there to give it stability.

[07:22] That's the one that has flexibility in where its tab has a long slot and you can move it

[07:29] to different angles. You can either move it towards the player and widen the entrance

[07:34] to the lane where you can move it away from the player, narrow the entrance to the lane,

[07:39] but giving the rail more curve, which is what I chose to do.

[07:46] I felt more curve was going to allow the ball to like transition smoother.

[07:51] So because the entrance, the width of the entrance wasn't really the problem.

[07:55] The ball was getting into the shot. It just wasn't transitioning going northbound.

[08:01] It was just banking off of it and falling back out. So while the the entrance of the shot is

[08:07] actually a little bit tighter than it was because it was about midway out of the factory.

[08:11] It's actually a little bit tighter now, but that's not a problem.

[08:17] It's still, so I pushed it all the way away from the player.

[08:20] It still is, the ball can enter the shot,

[08:24] it's just allows the ball to continue off its intended path.

[08:29] Okay. So this is interesting because I think this is, as people think about it,

[08:36] intuition might lead you to want to open up that shot as much as possible,

[08:42] but that's not the problem. Getting the ball into that area has never been the real issue.

[08:47] It's the momentum and the velocity has been killed by hitting the dead wall.

[08:51] So you've opened up, you've closed up the entrance to give the curve, the maximum sort of curve,

[08:57] and then softened the the rail itself by removing those two screws.

[09:03] Now what results have you had, John, after doing this?

[09:07] Oh, it was like the night and day, the difference.

[09:11] I played the first game. I had at least three two loop combos right out of the game.

[09:18] On top of that, I, you know, in an effort to avoid any placebo effects.

[09:24] When my wife Morgan came down, she was like, oh, let me jump on there.

[09:28] I didn't even mention to her that I had done that.

[09:32] And I walked away from the game while she was playing.

[09:34] And she ran right up to me. She was like, I hit that shot a whole bunch of times,

[09:37] like just bragging on herself.

[09:40] And I was like, that's what I just tweaked.

[09:42] So if, if pregnant Morgan who's about to give birth any hour now,

[09:47] can hit the shot over and over again.

[09:50] Like if I can't hit it now, that should just retire from pinball.

[09:53] So, okay, so that's, that's really good news.

[09:56] I mean, it's still, don't get me wrong. Chris is still a tough shot.

[09:59] Yeah, you know, timing is still, is still a factor here.

[10:02] But, you know, if you do hit the shot properly,

[10:06] it more often than not will actually do what it's intended.

[10:10] Because I had tried all the other stuff I saw on, on, on pinside.

[10:14] I tried everything.

[10:15] It was as dialed in as it could have been when you came here yesterday,

[10:21] based on the information I had.

[10:22] Right.

[10:23] Well, and that's the thing.

[10:25] It's like nobody has an issue with the shot being tough.

[10:28] It's, it's always been, it's, it's just not fulfilling when you hit a tough shot

[10:33] and then it doesn't work.

[10:34] So it sounds like it works a lot better.

[10:36] Now, to get to those two screws, John, you have to remove the, the left ramp, correct?

[10:42] Yeah, exactly.

[10:43] Now, how hard is it to remove that ramp?

[10:46] That was simple.

[10:46] That was really simple.

[10:48] You know, when I was talking to Scott, he was like, it's just two screws

[10:51] and then it slides right out.

[10:53] And I've kind of found, found that hard to believe.

[10:55] Because when I hear somebody explain how easy it is to remove something on a pinball

[11:00] machine, I take it with a grain of salt.

[11:02] But it really is just the ramp flap screws.

[11:05] And the, and the rest of the ramp is held in place by how it sits in the back panel.

[11:10] So you take those screws out and the ramp slides right out.

[11:13] Okay.

[11:14] And boom, you're, and you can, you just remove the plastic that's directly underneath it that

[11:19] goes along the length of the rail, which is maybe two or three hex bolts.

[11:25] Okay.

[11:25] And then they're easy to get to.

[11:27] What would you estimate the time to complete this tweak?

[11:34] Oh, if somebody's, for me, it takes an hour and a half because I'm sitting around bullshitting

[11:41] for a second.

[11:42] But anybody else in the world, it shouldn't take a more than 10 minutes.

[11:46] Okay.

[11:46] Now, this feedback is great.

[11:47] So have you reported back to Scott that this is a great solve?

[11:52] Because I think the other question a lot of people have is sounds like this is a great tweak

[11:58] and maybe spooky can make these tweaks happen at the factory.

[12:03] Yeah, I did.

[12:04] I mean, he was the first person I contacted.

[12:06] It was like it totally worked.

[12:08] And, you know, he had mentioned to me when we were talking before he even did it.

[12:12] He was like, if it works for you, I might report back to the factory and suggest they do that.

[12:17] Yeah.

[12:17] It's, it's, it's a weird tweak, right?

[12:19] Because you're leaving screws out, you know?

[12:22] And so, yeah, but it's fine.

[12:24] I mean, there's as long as the entrance is secured with that one screw.

[12:28] I mean, the other screws don't really matter.

[12:30] And it sounds like if anything, they've been hurting the ball's velocity through that area.

[12:35] So I think people, and you don't see it, right?

[12:37] It's at the same time.

[12:38] Just, no, it's covered by plastic.

[12:40] You don't see it.

[12:41] It's the stability doesn't seem like it's sacrificed at all.

[12:45] I mean, I remember what I, as soon as I put it back together,

[12:47] I still had a couple of screws sitting on the bar top.

[12:49] And I'm like, like, racked my brain, like, where the hell did I forget?

[12:53] I'm like, oh, right, right, right.

[12:54] And leaving those out.

[12:56] But, yeah, I mean, you know, the first thing I did was wiggle it

[13:00] and press my finger into it and smack the ball against it.

[13:04] Just to see if any of the stability was going to be an issue.

[13:06] And it was fine.

[13:07] It was absolutely fine.

[13:09] Because I mean, it's tight on the ends, you know?

[13:11] Yeah.

[13:11] Have you since opening the game?

[13:14] Have you had to bend the spinner itself?

[13:17] I did it for good measure.

[13:20] When, you know, because it was one of the first things

[13:22] that Scott had mentioned when there was criticism coming in from that,

[13:26] that stream, that initial stream out of the factory,

[13:29] people were like, it looks like it's rattling around the spinner.

[13:32] And Scott mentioned in that thread on Pinside that, you know,

[13:37] like, it was a, you know, the spinner had to be bent up

[13:40] or something along those lines.

[13:41] So even though I kind of, I said to myself,

[13:44] it's not really interacting with the spinner before it gets hung up.

[13:49] I bent it up anyway, just for, you know, I figured it can't hurt.

[13:54] And I don't really know that that's necessary,

[13:56] because the spinner is very, very fluid and very smooth.

[13:59] It doesn't really, I don't know.

[14:02] I mean, I'm not going to bend it back,

[14:03] but I don't know that anybody really needs to do that.

[14:06] Right.

[14:07] Okay.

[14:08] So, and then the other shot off of this flipper,

[14:12] the shot towards the garage is also a very hard shot.

[14:16] And Scott's admitted that that's supposed to be the much more difficult

[14:19] of the two shots.

[14:21] Yeah. How's that shot going for you?

[14:24] Well, for me, it's become the harder of the shots now.

[14:27] Which it should be after that older.

[14:28] Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

[14:29] I really was, I was just targeting that inner loop,

[14:33] because that was the real problem area for me,

[14:35] based on design and functionality.

[14:39] As opposed to the lower one was hard for me,

[14:41] because it's just a hard shot.

[14:44] But I did do the same thing on that lane.

[14:47] I took out a couple of the screws

[14:49] that Scott and I discussed that.

[14:51] And, um, you know, I'm going to spend more time on it

[14:54] and I'll report back to you when I see.

[14:56] But see, yeah, I noticed with that shot,

[15:00] if you hit it, it normally,

[15:02] you always kind of need a little bit of momentum coming off of the flipper versus,

[15:08] if like the ball's moving slow towards that upper right flipper,

[15:11] it's not really going to have enough speed to make it all the way into the garage.

[15:14] But when it's moving around quickly,

[15:17] if you can time it just right, I was able to hit that shot pretty

[15:21] even more than the spinner shot, but it's hard and it's meant to be hard,

[15:26] because there's another way to get into the garage,

[15:27] and that's through the the right orbit on the far right side.

[15:31] I think that's the longest shot on the game.

[15:33] I mean, the distance from the flipper

[15:36] all the way up to the garage hole up that loop.

[15:38] I mean, that's a long path, you know,

[15:41] that goes up all the way across the playfield,

[15:43] and then like about halfway up the playfield.

[15:46] So, you know, yeah, like to your point,

[15:49] if you don't have enough momentum coming off of the flipper,

[15:52] really, I don't think it's any kind of design flow there.

[15:55] It's just like part of playing pinball.

[15:57] Sometimes the ball's going fast enough, and sometimes it's not.

[16:00] Now what, John, what pitch do you have this game at?

[16:03] The factory recommended angle?

[16:06] I think it's, well, I know Scott said 6.9.

[16:09] I'm pretty sure that's what he said.

[16:11] He designed it at.

[16:12] I think it was the last time I checked, it was 6.8,

[16:15] but you know, the floor is in jack bar.

[16:17] You know, you move the machine a bench,

[16:19] and things change a little bit.

[16:21] But there's pretty damn close, in my opinion.

[16:25] Okay, and then flipper strength.

[16:26] Have you adjusted that at all on the game?

[16:29] No, it's one of the few coils I have not nests with.

[16:32] Okay, I'm wondering if that would help or hurt

[16:35] if you jacked up the power.

[16:37] Can you increase the power on the upper flipper shot?

[16:40] Yeah, I believe all the coils are adjustable.

[16:43] Okay, you know, I'd be curious to see myself.

[16:45] It was, it wasn't having a hard time speed wise,

[16:49] making anything.

[16:50] So I just didn't want to mess with something

[16:52] that didn't seem like it needed it.

[16:55] Now, it's been there for three weeks, John.

[16:57] What's the total play count?

[16:59] How's it been earning for you?

[17:02] It's, Scott, I have 2,000 plays on it.

[17:05] Wow.

[17:06] At a bucket play, right?

[17:07] Yeah, it's, yeah.

[17:09] And it looks, it looks pretty much still like a brand new game.

[17:13] I mean, the play field, there's not a,

[17:15] I didn't see a single dimple on it.

[17:17] No, the play field's like glass.

[17:19] It's unbelievable.

[17:21] What was they're doing?

[17:22] You know what?

[17:22] Stir and listen up.

[17:24] Right.

[17:24] Because your game's right next to stranger things.

[17:26] And stranger things still looks like the craters of,

[17:29] on a moon.

[17:30] It, it's unbelievable.

[17:32] The difference for those people who say dimpling is normal.

[17:35] I can't wait to you stand over a Rick and Morty.

[17:38] After like a few hundred plays.

[17:39] Yeah.

[17:40] Yeah, it's, it's a, it's a whole another ball game for sure.

[17:43] And, you know, really, my personal issue isn't so much the play field,

[17:47] as it is that they're trying to sell me a $300 ad on it.

[17:51] The UK.

[17:52] But that's a whole other show.

[17:53] Yeah.

[17:53] Together, I guess.

[17:55] Well, and, and when I was standing over your machine the other day or yesterday,

[17:59] the first thing I thought is,

[18:00] you don't need to send the spooky play field to cruise men.

[18:04] He's the guy who does the amazing clear coats.

[18:06] Right.

[18:06] Doesn't, doesn't need it.

[18:08] It really doesn't for sure.

[18:10] It definitely does not.

[18:12] And how's it earning in comparison to stranger things?

[18:16] I feel bad now.

[18:17] I don't want to take any business away from Ron.

[18:19] Ron's great at what he does.

[18:20] You know, no, any of the every other play field in the world needs.

[18:23] Well, and Ron is amazing.

[18:24] But I just, there's every other game needs him to do it,

[18:29] except for this one right now.

[18:31] Yeah, I mean, listen, it can't hurt.

[18:33] I mean, to be honest with you,

[18:35] I probably would have paid for that if it wasn't

[18:37] going to hold my game up for like a few months, you know.

[18:40] Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you.

[18:41] I always like, I like to pull the proof everything if I can't.

[18:44] Yeah, I didn't even realize it was an option until it was too late.

[18:47] And my game's too early on the run to do it.

[18:49] But what I might do,

[18:51] I mean, maybe just get him to do an extra play for it.

[18:53] I always hate these like spare play field guys, right?

[18:56] Where they, they'll never in a million years ever do the swap,

[18:59] but they just feel good knowing it's like, under the bed.

[19:01] Why, he could hate me.

[19:03] I have a pile of play fields.

[19:05] I'm sure you do.

[19:06] You want a magical one?

[19:07] I'll sell to you for cheap.

[19:08] Um,

[19:09] well, John, are you there all day today?

[19:12] Uh, excuse me, I don't have a baby.

[19:14] Yes.

[19:14] And, and so you're open until Morgan's ready to, uh,

[19:18] to add another pinhead into the world.

[19:21] Yeah, for sure.

[19:22] Yeah, I think I might just hop in Uber and app right now and come over and play.

[19:26] Is that, is that come check it out?

[19:28] Is that a few check it out?

[19:28] I'll play with you.

[19:29] All right.

[19:30] And then I'll, basically, as people hear this show,

[19:33] what they're just going to hear is like a two second pause.

[19:36] And then my next assessment of the game.

[19:39] So let's do that.

[19:40] I'm just going to hop the cab right now.

[19:42] Okay.

[19:42] Sounds great.

[19:43] All right.

[19:44] I'll see you in a little bit.

[19:45] All right.

[19:45] Sounds good.

[19:46] Chris.

[19:46] Thanks.

[19:46] Awesome.

[19:48] All right.

[19:48] So then I hopped in in Uber $27.89 later.

[19:53] I'm at Jack Bar and I'm playing Rick and Morty again with John.

[19:56] Now I asked him to step up to the machine and let me,

[20:00] I was like, show me what you got.

[20:03] And he immediately plunges and he rips the upper spinner shot two times in a row.

[20:08] Something we had not done at all the previous day.

[20:12] So immediately I was like, all right, I can just go back now.

[20:14] I can just get in and Uber and go home because you just showed me in the first two shots of the

[20:20] game that those changes helped.

[20:22] So for those of you out there, I think this goes to show that obviously games need to be tweaked.

[20:28] These are tweaks that I wish came from spooky though.

[20:31] I do.

[20:32] I think that for most of you out there who are waiting on your Rick and Morty games,

[20:36] I really hope spooky finds the optimal, the optimal position for the guide rail.

[20:44] And I hope they find the optimal position for the flipper.

[20:46] And I hope most of you out there don't have to do this stuff on your own.

[20:50] But here's the good news.

[20:51] These are really, really simple tweaks like really simple.

[20:55] You don't have to bring out a soldering iron.

[20:58] You don't have to remove significant parts of the play field or ramps or upper.

[21:03] It's really, really easy to do this.

[21:06] And as we all know, little tweaks here and there are part of pinball.

[21:09] Now, there's been other suggestions people have been making about changing out the posts in the game.

[21:14] And that'll help as well that those skinny posts that are really,

[21:19] you know, tough on the spooky machines aren't ideal.

[21:23] I've seen people change the rubbers out and get better gameplay from the game itself.

[21:27] I was just happy to see this shot work.

[21:30] And I hopped on the machine and I only played about maybe six games today with John.

[21:36] And I was able to hit the shot much more frequently and consistently.

[21:40] And we actually had to just like pinch ourselves and say, okay,

[21:44] instead of just trying to keep it that shot to prove that the fix worked,

[21:48] let's just start playing the game and enjoying it.

[21:50] And I watched John put up something like a 24 million point game, which was really good.

[21:56] And there are so many fun elements to this game that I can't wait for you people to experience.

[22:03] I love it when you go into different dimensions.

[22:06] And there's little things, little details that I notice every time.

[22:10] When you're in the Roy mode, I didn't even know this.

[22:12] The clock on the top by the scoop, you know, the numbers indicate the age of Roy.

[22:18] I'm like, little stuff like that is just so cool.

[22:21] We went into the dimension in which the pop bumper sling doesn't work anymore.

[22:26] And it's like the whole game is covered and it's like reddish pink color.

[22:30] Super cool.

[22:31] And the pop bumper is glowing.

[22:33] This game, I really think it's going to really win a lot of people over because of the personality of the game.

[22:41] Now that being said, after going back and playing again, I will say this,

[22:46] this is not the easiest game.

[22:48] This is not a game where people who have no pinball skills will get very far.

[22:54] Because not just the upper right flipper shots,

[22:58] a lot of the shots in this game require a decent skill at pinball to hit the shots.

[23:05] Because a lot of the shots are pretty tight.

[23:08] Even on the right side, you're going to see it's not super, super easy to hit these ramps

[23:13] time and time again.

[23:14] You know, I'm coming from Batman 66 where either one of those ramps was really easy to go back and forth,

[23:20] back and forth.

[23:21] The one thing about Rick and Morty, I noticed too, on my second playing of the game,

[23:26] it's not a game that has a lot of combos.

[23:29] And if you're used to comboing a game and love the sort of shot to shot, the shot, the shot,

[23:35] back and forth comboing, I don't think you're going to see a lot of combos in this game.

[23:39] That's okay. It's just the way the game is.

[23:41] I just want to let you guys know.

[23:42] Because again, one of the most favorite things in Batman was going back and forth between the ramps

[23:47] and you can keep comboing them.

[23:49] I think the most combos I did in Batman were 12 on the ramp combos, the Catwoman combo.

[23:54] Not going to see that kind of comboing in Rick and Morty, okay.

[23:58] Now, the other thing is this, the other thing I noticed, and this game, it's very sensitive

[24:04] to flipper power.

[24:06] It's weird how sometimes you cradle the ball with the right flipper and you fire up that left ramp,

[24:12] which is really steep.

[24:14] Sometimes it goes up the ramp, sometimes it doesn't.

[24:17] And I never understand that.

[24:18] How come sometimes when you're cradling the ball and you fire it, it goes all the way up?

[24:23] Sometimes when you're cradling the ball and you fire it, it goes halfway up.

[24:27] Is it power surges?

[24:29] Is it just because there's a lot of games on?

[24:31] Do the coils heat up?

[24:32] I know the coils heat up, but I did notice that that maybe increasing the flipper power might be useful

[24:38] in this game to consistently get up that left ramp because it is a steep one.

[24:44] But it is also satisfying when you make it all the way up to the top.

[24:48] I love this game.

[24:49] I loved playing it again.

[24:51] I can't wait to get it.

[24:52] I'm glad there's a solv and a tweak that makes it more enjoyable.

[24:58] And I apologize if some of you heard my initial review and felt that I was just crapping on the game

[25:04] and Scott's design.

[25:05] And I think Scott's a little anxious.

[25:07] I talked to him yesterday.

[25:08] I think he is.

[25:09] He really, really wants people to enjoy this game.

[25:12] And it is a tough game though.

[25:14] There's no way around it.

[25:16] It is a difficult game.

[25:18] The good news is it's going to make everybody better at Pimball.

[25:22] The bad news is if you have someone who doesn't want to get better at Pimball,

[25:28] they might not get very far.

[25:29] They're not going to get the kind of satisfaction in this game they would if they played a stern machine.

[25:34] Most stern machines, even if you're just flailing and throwing the ball up the play field,

[25:40] you will probably start something.

[25:42] In Rick and Morty, that's not the case.

[25:44] You're not going to be able to start in adventure because you do have to get up one of the ramps first

[25:50] before you go into the scoop to start an adventure.

[25:52] I can't see someone who's just flailing, activating that.

[25:56] There's no multi ball to get by just flailing.

[25:58] You have to be somewhat decent.

[26:01] And I think the majority of people buying this game understand that.

[26:04] The majority of people buying this game are decent Pimball players.

[26:08] So I just want to thank Scott Dinesi for reaching out.

[26:12] I want to thank John at Jack Bar for opening up Jack Bar for me early in the morning to play with Brenda.

[26:18] I want to thank him for inviting me back in today.

[26:21] And I want to just thank everyone who's been writing on Facebook,

[26:25] you know who you are, who's been making tweaks to their game and sharing what they've been doing

[26:30] and getting to this point.

[26:32] This is what I love about Pimball.

[26:35] It is a community effort.

[26:36] And I want to say this is how it should be.

[26:38] It shouldn't be Hilton calling me a moron and just trying to discredit me 100%

[26:44] because the changes we made to the game today,

[26:46] these were further changes than anything Hilton had told people to do.

[26:51] And I think the changes we made to the game,

[26:53] we have photographs of them.

[26:55] I'm going to share them on Facebook.

[26:57] And we're helping people out.

[26:58] And I think calling me names and saying I'm an idiot and how can anyone listen?

[27:02] It's why why I play a game.

[27:05] And those were my feelings on it.

[27:07] The designer heard me and he reached out.

[27:09] And then the operator heard the designer and made the changes.

[27:14] And then I went back and enjoyed the game.

[27:16] Now I hope my game is ready to ship this week because with all of us working from home

[27:22] for it's crazy like the governor of New York said it might be six months of this.

[27:26] So I really, really can't wait to get a machine into Canade's bedroom.

[27:30] So everyone, I hope this is a nice sort of conclusion

[27:34] to the Rick and Morty trilogy of this week.

[27:38] Obviously I will give much more in-depth gameplay reviews as I own the game

[27:44] and play the game much more frequently.

[27:47] But I hope a lot of you who are in on this game can be rest assured

[27:51] that this shot can be made more effective.

[27:55] But you will have to time it right.

[27:58] And the shots in the game are more difficult than say in Elvira or a stranger things.

[28:05] Stern knows how to make games for beginners.

[28:08] This is not necessarily a beginner's game.

[28:11] But if you have a little bit of skill, this game is going to open up for most people.

[28:15] And I think people are going to enjoy this more than a stern machine that might be too easy

[28:20] and get boring over time.

[28:22] All right, so that's it.

[28:24] Episode three of Canade's Rick and Morty journey comes to a conclusion right now.

[28:29] I guess two out of three of these podcasts were pretty positive and glowing about Rick and Morty.

[28:36] And you know what they say, two out of three ain't bad.
