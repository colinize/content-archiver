[00:00] I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller, I wish I had a girl who look good, I would call her, I wish I had a rabbit and a hat with a pack of 6-4-4.

[00:13] Welcome everybody to Canatus Pinball Podcast, how's everybody doing?

[00:19] We get to see on Pinside now, people are actually putting up for sale Beatlejuice games we're seeing the prices people are getting.

[00:27] Distros are getting $500 for transfer fees.

[00:31] What exactly does that mean?

[00:33] What does it take?

[00:35] How much effort does it take to move one guy's name

[00:39] over to another guy's name?

[00:41] $500, the price of an Xbox,

[00:47] 500 bucks for just changing a name?

[00:51] Everybody, we're gonna see some game change

[00:53] in coming in this whole space pretty soon, baby.

[00:56] We got maybe the never-ending story by Barrels of Fun.

[01:01] Let's talk about that.

[01:03] We've got Harry Potter, the number one game

[01:05] in the world right now on the Pinside 100

[01:08] with about 387 reviews.

[01:12] Still very early on.

[01:13] This always happens, then the stern army comes in

[01:16] and basically dive bombs those reviews

[01:19] to push a stern machine back to number one.

[01:22] I think Evil Dead was number one for a while,

[01:24] but it's all good.

[01:25] It's all good.

[01:26] You know, nobody takes this list very seriously

[01:30] just by what you love, but I will say this.

[01:33] No game has ever gone to number one that really sucks.

[01:39] And no game has gone to number one

[01:41] and stayed there for a while.

[01:43] I mean, if you stay in the top 10

[01:45] over like a thousand reviews or more,

[01:48] then it's somewhat legitimate.

[01:50] But right now, it's still early.

[01:52] If you think about it, like 387 reviews for Potter,

[01:55] most of them are coming from Harry Potter owners.

[01:58] So what are they gonna say?

[01:59] What are they gonna say?

[02:00] But I don't think anyone would really deny the fact

[02:03] that Harry Potter has done really well.

[02:06] It is most likely the best shooting Jersey Jack game

[02:09] to date that and Elton John.

[02:12] It's easily their biggest theme ever.

[02:14] It's got so much in it.

[02:16] And the game's doing phenomenally well for Jersey Jack.

[02:20] If you ask me the number one thing I think

[02:23] they need to figure out now as a strategy moving forward.

[02:27] I don't think Jersey Jack can do this unlimited CE thing

[02:31] ever again.

[02:33] I know it's like great that none of you got burned

[02:36] and none of you had to pay over for Harry Potter CEs.

[02:40] We're gonna talk about Beetlejuice

[02:42] now that the prices are up.

[02:43] But here's the thing.

[02:45] You know, it's great that everybody got their Harry Potter

[02:48] in the exact trim they wanted.

[02:50] And I heard over 3,000 people ordered a CE for $15,000.

[02:57] And I know it feels good right now that you got one.

[03:00] And you know, maybe you're never gonna sell it.

[03:02] And that's the idea, right?

[03:04] It's like we want this to be in as many homes as possible.

[03:07] And people are not gonna wanna sell these games.

[03:10] But we all know that there are gonna be people

[03:13] that wanna sell their Harry Potter CE down the road.

[03:17] And we all know good luck getting anywhere close to $15,000

[03:23] if there's 3,000 of these out in the world.

[03:26] And then all of those wizard editions and arcade editions,

[03:29] because remember, every single version of Harry Potter

[03:33] is the exact same game.

[03:35] Same layout, same mechs, same code.

[03:38] I think you're gonna see a huge depreciation in this game

[03:41] over the years.

[03:43] And it's gonna be a lot like GNR,

[03:45] where you're gonna see them for sale all over the place.

[03:48] Cause I do think people are gonna want Sonic the Hedgehog,

[03:51] maybe Matrix.

[03:53] I don't know exactly what's after Sonic.

[03:55] There's the rumor of Ghostbusters.

[03:57] Not sure I believe that one.

[03:59] But anyway, you know, I think Jersey Jack's next game,

[04:02] they need to go back and bake in some scarcity,

[04:07] some FOMO, and some secondhand value

[04:10] on the Sonic the Hedgehog Collector's Edition.

[04:13] That will be my recommendation to Brett

[04:16] when I talk to him.

[04:17] You can't have it like this forever now,

[04:20] because if you do it, you're just gonna completely lose

[04:23] the secondhand value on your products.

[04:26] And Spooky's got the opposite approach right now.

[04:29] Everyone's banging on their door

[04:30] to make more Beetlejuice games.

[04:32] The demand is insane.

[04:35] We are now seeing games listed for, I think,

[04:38] around like $7,800

[04:42] if you wanna buy someone's Beetlejuice spot.

[04:44] Now that includes the $2,000 deposit,

[04:49] maybe the topper, the butter cabinet, net net.

[04:52] People are getting around $5,000 over for this game.

[04:56] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[04:58] I think that this is a good price

[05:01] because it's gonna get even worse.

[05:04] And let me explain why I think it's gonna get even worse

[05:07] for people trying to get this game down the road.

[05:10] The demand for this game is not going south ever.

[05:14] And most people who are into pinball,

[05:17] who are casual pinball buyers

[05:19] that want a really nice game based on a theme they love,

[05:23] most people still have not seen this game.

[05:26] They are not aware this game is even out.

[05:28] This game was sold out

[05:30] before it even hit the public eye

[05:33] to the diehard enthusiasts who are on pinside,

[05:37] who are following pinside content creators,

[05:39] who are not pinside pinball content creators,

[05:41] they knew this game was coming out.

[05:43] Now look, for everybody else out there,

[05:46] they have no idea this game exists.

[05:48] So think about it like this.

[05:50] Imagine when those 10 show games go down to Florida

[05:55] for pinball at the beach.

[05:56] And a bunch of rich guys with their Florida mansions,

[06:00] they roll in there and they see this game

[06:03] and this game is amazing and they want one.

[06:06] What are you gonna tell those guys

[06:07] who live in a three, four million dollar mansion

[06:10] that the game's not available,

[06:11] what price do you think they would pay?

[06:13] I mean, these are gentlemen who buy their wise

[06:16] $50,000 Rolexes, they've got $100,000 cars in the garage

[06:20] and they really want this Beetlejuice game in their house.

[06:24] You can see what I mean.

[06:26] The more people play this game, also TPF,

[06:29] the more the public sees this game at shows,

[06:32] the demand is gonna go up, not down, right?

[06:36] That's the whole principle of supply and demand.

[06:39] The supply is always gonna be finite

[06:41] and it's gonna be very low and the demand for this game

[06:44] is just gonna keep going up and up and up.

[06:47] And I've predicted, I think it's gonna go near $18,000

[06:51] to $20,000 is what it's gonna require

[06:54] to get one of these games down the road.

[06:56] Now look, once they start making games

[06:59] and it's a real tangible item

[07:01] and there are hundreds of them out in the world,

[07:04] yes, that does seem by conventional wisdom

[07:07] that there will be a period where demand will start

[07:10] to go down a little bit because the supply is out

[07:13] in the world.

[07:14] Right now there's like zero supply, nobody has the game.

[07:17] So you could argue that right now is when FOMO is the highest

[07:21] and people that cash out now are gonna cash out

[07:24] at the highest, I don't agree with this game.

[07:26] And I also know that the next title they have coming out

[07:30] is also as big, if not a bigger banger than this.

[07:35] So there's almost like a frenzy to get on the list

[07:37] for the next game, but it's way too early.

[07:40] I know Kerry's been talking about getting on the list

[07:43] for the next game, leave these guys alone.

[07:45] They need a year to make this game.

[07:47] They've never had a game this popular.

[07:49] They've never had like to distribute these games

[07:53] across the variety of dealers

[07:55] and everyone's got a different approach

[07:57] on how they do their lists.

[07:58] I think this is gonna be a wake up call for everybody

[08:01] who's got like spooky products.

[08:03] How are you gonna handle your list?

[08:05] How are you gonna put people on that list?

[08:07] Do you wanna make it fair?

[08:09] Are you gonna allow people to transfer spots?

[08:12] Some companies don't.

[08:13] Brian Savage just said on the record,

[08:16] they don't allow anybody to transfer spots

[08:19] of Winchester's mystery house.

[08:21] So like what does that mean?

[08:22] How can you stop somebody in a free market society

[08:27] from transferring their ownership to somebody else?

[08:30] You can't really do it.

[08:32] You can make it difficult.

[08:33] You can make it so that person has to actually

[08:36] receive the game, but they're still gonna scalp it.

[08:39] You're just adding in a necessary step.

[08:41] I get it's a headache.

[08:42] Like nobody wants to have a 350 pound pinball machine

[08:47] arrive at their house and then you have to schedule pickup

[08:50] from your house to the new buyer.

[08:52] So that's kind of annoying.

[08:54] That's why people like Joe Newhart

[08:56] have the $500 transfer fee.

[08:58] If you wanna do it and you wanna sell your spot

[09:00] to somebody else, that's 500 bucks.

[09:03] That's kind of trying to prevent scalping,

[09:05] but is it really?

[09:07] If you're seeing people get $5,000 over,

[09:11] what does $500 do?

[09:12] Of course you're gonna pay that

[09:14] because then you're still making 4,500 bucks.

[09:16] And I bet it's kinda hard for these dealers

[09:18] because this is where the pressure is for dealers.

[09:21] Cause think about it, if you're a dealer,

[09:22] you're in business and you gave this guy a spot

[09:26] and you made maybe a $1,000 margin on the game.

[09:29] And all of a sudden a dude who comes in,

[09:31] who did no work is gonna just flip his spot

[09:34] to somebody else and make $5,000 overnight.

[09:37] And he's just gonna pocket that money.

[09:39] You know these people are not paying taxes on it.

[09:41] He's just gonna pocket that money

[09:43] and he made five times what you make

[09:46] simply because you got him a spot.

[09:48] And I'm here to tell you right now,

[09:50] would people just lose their minds

[09:52] if a distro just sold all of their allotment

[09:56] at the market value of the game?

[09:59] What do you think would happen?

[10:00] Would everybody never buy from that person again?

[10:02] Why are we like this?

[10:03] You know right now here's the thing,

[10:05] there's not a single dealer or distro on their website

[10:09] that has a Beetlejuice spot for sale.

[10:13] Why don't dealers do this?

[10:14] Are they allowed to auction it?

[10:16] Think about it, like would that not be fair?

[10:19] If everything's spoken for and no one can get a single spot,

[10:22] what if a dealer said,

[10:23] hey, we're gonna list our five Beetlejuices for auction

[10:28] and you get to bid and whoever bids the highest

[10:31] gets the machine?

[10:32] How is that not fair?

[10:34] Let the market set the value.

[10:37] You know meanwhile you can have like Project Pimbo,

[10:39] I know they're a charity for a good cause.

[10:41] They're raffling these things off

[10:42] for like three times what they're worth.

[10:44] Nobody's waving the red flag there.

[10:47] Why do they get to make $30,000 per machine

[10:50] and then a dealer can't just auction it off

[10:54] and let the person who wants it the most have it?

[10:57] Would that be so problematic?

[10:59] You know we really do look at all of these like higher prices.

[11:02] It's weird, I'd rather games demand more.

[11:06] You know what that means?

[11:07] It means the game's great.

[11:09] It means there's not many of them.

[11:11] Would you rather live in a Pimbo world?

[11:12] If I gave you the option,

[11:14] would you rather live in a Pimbo world

[11:16] where every single stern Oli is losing $3,000 to $5,000?

[11:20] Or would you rather live in a Pimbo world

[11:23] where every single spooky is going up $5,000 in value?

[11:27] Now we heard from Luke yesterday on the live,

[11:29] they are absolutely raising prices on the next game.

[11:32] They're not dummies, they see what's happening.

[11:35] It's probably gonna be somewhere around $11,500.

[11:38] I think they're gonna be right where barrels is.

[11:41] So $11,500 plus the butter, plus the top for everybody,

[11:46] all of a sudden, baby, all in.

[11:49] A spooky game is $15,000.

[11:53] But if you were to look at all the Pimbo companies

[11:56] out there in the world right now,

[11:58] who actually feels like they are in a position

[12:02] where that price kind of makes sense?

[12:06] If every single Beetlejuice is selling right now

[12:09] in the second hand market for $15,000 to $17,000,

[12:13] they're absolutely not gonna be ripping us off.

[12:16] If they raise their prices by $15,000.

[12:19] But there's gonna be a point where they're gonna have to stop.

[12:21] There's gonna be a point, and that's the hard point to reach.

[12:25] Stern didn't do it.

[12:26] Stern's LE at 10.5 was where they should have stopped.

[12:31] And they didn't, they kept raising it and raising it

[12:34] to the point now where no Stern looks like a $13,000 machine.

[12:40] We saw the walking dead yesterday at IAPA.

[12:43] We got the first footage of the code over the shoulder,

[12:48] crappy cell phone footage.

[12:50] I'm just here to tell you this right now.

[12:51] This is all on them.

[12:54] I love George Gomez and I enjoy talking to him,

[12:57] but this is inexcusable.

[12:59] This is Mickey Mouse Marketing at its finest.

[13:03] How do you reveal a game before you have permission

[13:06] to show the game in its final light?

[13:08] That is Mickey Mouse Marketing.

[13:10] None of my clients would ever do this.

[13:13] This whole excuse we're waiting on license or approval, fine.

[13:17] Then get all of the license or approval

[13:20] before you release the game.

[13:23] This is inexcusable.

[13:25] The world premiere of a code of your game

[13:27] should be from you in your factory, in your studio,

[13:31] with your content creators.

[13:33] We have to see the world premiere of this game,

[13:36] half baked, not ready yet for prime time,

[13:39] get it out on a show floor.

[13:41] It's Mickey Mouse Marketing.

[13:43] You need to know what your timeline is.

[13:46] You need to know what your deadlines are

[13:47] and you should hit them.

[13:49] There's no excuse.

[13:51] This whole thing is just so lame.

[13:54] And so yeah, the game looks better in real life.

[13:57] Duh, did anyone think it wouldn't look better

[14:01] in real life than photos?

[14:03] Is there a single pinball machine in the history of pinball

[14:06] that looks better in photos than in real life?

[14:09] But what's funny to me about this Walking Dead game

[14:12] is we have this new Spike 3 system

[14:15] and they've been touting the big difference

[14:18] that you're gonna notice is the bigger screen.

[14:22] And yet once again, the damn clips are tiny.

[14:27] They basically squish them to look like the same ratio

[14:31] as a DMD.

[14:32] This is so comical to me, Stern.

[14:34] What's wrong with you guys?

[14:36] Seriously, does nobody over there have common freaking sense?

[14:40] If we're gonna go bigger on the screen,

[14:43] we need a game that shows that off.

[14:45] Star Wars put all the clips into a smaller box

[14:49] so it didn't utilize the big screen.

[14:51] And now we've got this Walking Dead words,

[14:53] just this tiny sort of middle section of the screen

[14:56] is where the animations are.

[14:58] It looks stupid.

[14:59] It looks bad.

[15:00] It looks like letter box.

[15:02] Like what is this gang?

[15:04] It seems like cheap.

[15:05] Why did they do it this way?

[15:07] Why didn't they utilize the full screen?

[15:10] If Jersey Jack did this,

[15:12] if Jersey Jack on its big screen

[15:15] created animations that only use

[15:17] like a quarter of the screen like that,

[15:20] we'd all be like banging down the door.

[15:23] It's just so weird to me.

[15:25] It's so weird to me that Stern continues

[15:27] to just make these boneheaded mistakes.

[15:29] And then did you see the art package on the game?

[15:31] Carrie Hardy pointed it out.

[15:33] It's on my Facebook page.

[15:34] They use the same exact image three times in a row

[15:39] on the apron twice and then on the play field.

[15:42] And you're telling me that there's an art director

[15:45] looking over this stuff and saying,

[15:46] hey, we can't recycle this stuff.

[15:48] You're just gonna keep dropping the same image

[15:51] three times on the game.

[15:52] And I love it too because on the left side of the apron,

[15:55] they're just anticipating the apron card will block it.

[15:59] But we see it, man.

[16:00] We see it, Jeremy.

[16:02] I'm expecting a text message at 12.45 this morning

[16:07] telling me how I've destroyed your life again, brother.

[16:10] You can't come out, Canadian blame in me, bro.

[16:13] Guys, wake up, open your eyes.

[16:15] Those slingshot heads look really corny and lame.

[16:20] But the game looks better, but the question now is this,

[16:23] does it look like a $13,000 game?

[16:26] Does it look like it has enough?

[16:28] And I think the part that Stern doesn't get

[16:31] because George is like, everything's fine,

[16:33] everything's fine, everything is not fine.

[16:35] The problem with Stern is this, it's not about volume,

[16:38] it's about quality.

[16:40] It's not about volume, it's about value.

[16:44] It's not about volume and manufacturing,

[16:47] efficiency, and speed.

[16:49] It's about what looks like it's worth it

[16:52] and has the passion and has the details.

[16:55] And because here's the problem that George doesn't get.

[16:58] Every single Stern premium is the same price as Beetlejuice.

[17:03] And when you put every single Stern premium

[17:06] next to what you get with Beetlejuice,

[17:09] I don't care if George is like,

[17:11] I can't live on those margins.

[17:12] Well, I can, you can, as a customer,

[17:16] do you care what the margins are

[17:18] between these two companies?

[17:20] No, what you see as a customer,

[17:23] and this is what George doesn't get,

[17:24] what you see as a customer is this item is $10,000.

[17:29] And this item is $10,000.

[17:32] I can't unsee that.

[17:34] I can't not compare and cross shop those two games.

[17:39] See, Stern doesn't care,

[17:40] because they're like, well, we're gonna make thousands.

[17:41] And like, they're only make, it doesn't matter,

[17:43] but what's happening more and more now

[17:45] is everybody's putting what you've got for 10,000

[17:49] versus what they have for 10,000.

[17:51] And heck, you could put a $13,000 walking dead LE

[17:56] next to a $10,000 Beetlejuice.

[17:59] It's 30% more money the Stern machine.

[18:02] The Stern machine is 30% more expensive,

[18:06] and it looks 60% cheaper as a game.

[18:09] And so George and Stern, you know,

[18:12] I don't think you get it yet.

[18:14] I really don't think you get it.

[18:16] And I do not believe that Stern sales are great right now.

[18:21] I don't believe it.

[18:23] I don't see it.

[18:24] I don't see the threads blowing up the way they used to.

[18:27] I don't see the unboxings happening the way they used to.

[18:31] Unless there's all these people in the world

[18:33] that are new to pinball, maybe, I don't know, maybe,

[18:36] maybe they've been clobbering people with Facebook ads,

[18:39] and they have like half a million, I think,

[18:41] or more Facebook fans.

[18:43] Maybe they've just been clobbering people

[18:45] and all these newbies have been buying games left and right.

[18:48] I just don't see it.

[18:49] But I will say this, I would never count Stern out.

[18:53] You can't count them out.

[18:54] They've got tremendous talent.

[18:57] They've got the resources to do it.

[18:59] And I think everybody here just wants them

[19:01] to put it together better.

[19:02] That's it.

[19:03] That's it, Stern.

[19:03] We just want you to put the pinball puzzle

[19:05] together better.

[19:07] Theme, integration, mechanical magic, layout.

[19:11] You know, I don't even know where the foiled cabinets go.

[19:14] Are there foiled cabinets on this walking dead?

[19:17] I don't think so, maybe.

[19:18] It's just not enough.

[19:20] It's just not enough.

[19:21] And they've got to revisit what an Ellie means.

[19:23] They should all be 500.

[19:25] They should all have a topper.

[19:27] And they should all have exclusive modes.

[19:28] And heck, I would go one step further

[19:30] if I'm Stern right now.

[19:31] I think Ellie should have an exclusive mech.

[19:33] I just do.

[19:34] I know it's harder, a little bit harder.

[19:35] So what?

[19:36] And also, did you see what they're doing now?

[19:38] And this is just testament that the Ellie's are not selling.

[19:40] They're running the premiums first.

[19:43] They're gonna run the premiums first.

[19:45] And then you got these Stern apologists who are like,

[19:47] well, that doesn't mean the Ellie's didn't sell.

[19:49] I'm happy because this means

[19:51] they're just gonna iron out the kinks.

[19:53] Iron out the kinks?

[19:55] Why do we keep giving this company so many excuses?

[19:59] Why should there be any kinks?

[20:02] They've got so many people, so much time to quality test.

[20:07] Why should there be kinks?

[20:09] Why should Star Wars ship

[20:11] where the Death Star shot doesn't work?

[20:14] What is this?

[20:15] Why are we the guinea pigs?

[20:16] Like they didn't catch that at the factory?

[20:18] That all of those great pinball players,

[20:20] Mr. Sharp, Mr. Danger, Mr. Gomez, all of them,

[20:24] all these guys, Mr. Elwin,

[20:25] you're not gonna have Keith Elwin

[20:27] bang on the game for a weekend and come back and say,

[20:29] hey, the Death Star shot doesn't work.

[20:31] So I just don't get it.

[20:32] You know, I just don't get it.

[20:33] I think this is a sign that the Ellie's did not sell very well.

[20:37] And this is bad, people.

[20:38] They can't even sell 500 Ellie's of a game that,

[20:41] you know, is a Lyman Sheets game.

[20:43] From what I saw at the IOPA stream,

[20:46] it didn't really look like, wow, take my money now, 13,000.

[20:50] It definitely didn't excite me the way Beetlejuice did.

[20:54] And so here we are.

[20:55] Speaking of exciting,

[20:57] do you think Barrels of Fun's next game

[20:59] is the never-ending story?

[21:02] Yeah, I don't know, man.

[21:03] Like, I think it might be.

[21:04] I think it might be.

[21:05] The reason why I think it might be

[21:07] is I didn't hear anything from them.

[21:09] Normally, if I guess a theme and it's wrong,

[21:11] I will hear that it's not that.

[21:14] So I do think that the never-ending story

[21:16] seems like something David would make.

[21:18] I don't feel like David and I have the same upbringing.

[21:22] I think I was raised on Hulk Hogan

[21:25] and Jean-Claude von Damme and Arnold

[21:29] and Back to the Future, like the cool stuff.

[21:32] You know, David keeps making stuff that's like,

[21:35] you know, kind of like the kids

[21:37] that were inside the locker throughout high school.

[21:39] You know what I'm saying?

[21:40] Like Labyrinth, Dune, Timothy Chamoledune

[21:43] and never-ending story.

[21:46] I don't know, you know?

[21:48] These are like the kinds of themes

[21:49] that would get you a wedgie.

[21:51] You know what I'm saying?

[21:52] Like a wedgie.

[21:53] Like I kind of want to give David a wedgie

[21:54] and be like, what are we doing here, bro?

[21:55] Man up, man up.

[21:57] And look, I know Winchester's Mystery House

[22:00] has sold all 525, but I've been saying it.

[22:03] I think it's a little bit of a blessing and a curse

[22:05] because you guys were all just starving

[22:07] for something different and a haunted house theme.

[22:09] But even that, it's like, I just don't know, man.

[22:12] I don't know.

[22:13] And never-ending story.

[22:15] How many of those could they sell if that is the theme?

[22:19] You know, and I've been questioning

[22:20] whether or not Winchester was on the line

[22:22] and Todd Tucky's like, watch my video.

[22:24] It's on the line.

[22:25] So I watched the video.

[22:26] Look, and I don't think anyone is not gonna

[22:29] get their Winchester.

[22:30] It's just a question of when.

[22:31] It's just a question of when.

[22:32] And so I watched Todd's video and Todd's like,

[22:35] it's on the line.

[22:36] Okay, so I watched the video and there it is.

[22:39] Like four Winchester playfields,

[22:42] on a rotisserie with nothing screwed into them.

[22:46] Have we not learned that that is not the game is on the line?

[22:50] That is a staged representation

[22:53] of what a pinball line is.

[22:55] That's not on the line.

[22:57] It's not like today there's a bunch of stuff

[23:00] screwed into those games.

[23:01] If those games are on the line and they make 15 games a week,

[23:06] then by the end of this week, Todd,

[23:08] those games should be complete.

[23:10] They're not on the line.

[23:12] They just put playfields in a line on rotisseries

[23:17] and are telling us the game's on the line.

[23:19] I don't understand why even do it.

[23:20] Like why even do it?

[23:21] Here's the question I have.

[23:23] When is Winchester going on the line?

[23:24] Do you know?

[23:26] Do you know when you're gonna get your game?

[23:28] The thing is this,

[23:29] everybody knows that they are most likely

[23:31] not gonna be done building these games

[23:33] until like October, November.

[23:36] And so the wait's gonna be long.

[23:38] Same thing with Beetlejuice.

[23:39] I mean, I'm at the end of the line.

[23:40] I'm game number 999.

[23:42] I'm gonna get my Beetlejuice sometime

[23:45] like in December of next year.

[23:49] So part of me is like, cool.

[23:50] Like by the time I get my game,

[23:52] I don't think demand is gonna be south at all.

[23:55] I'm gonna be putting my order in for Goonies, most likely.

[23:59] Yeah, Goonies.

[24:00] If you think Beetlejuice was crazy,

[24:02] get ready for Goonies, man.

[24:04] It's gonna be PsychoNuts.

[24:05] PsychoNuts, is that even a term?

[24:07] It's gonna be PsychoNuts trying to get on a list.

[24:10] And if you thought people were complaining

[24:11] about getting a Beetlejuice,

[24:13] wait till you see what happens to Goonies.

[24:15] But anyway, gang, look,

[24:16] it's an exciting time in Pinball.

[24:19] Stern Pinball is definitely in trouble.

[24:21] They need a hit.

[24:22] They know this.

[24:23] I don't believe any of their spin.

[24:25] And they've passed on too many losses to their customers.

[24:29] That is a problem.

[24:31] Beetlejuice is a huge hit.

[24:33] I think the prices are gonna go all the way up to 20,000.

[24:36] I think there's a lot of good pinball at good prices

[24:39] that people are gonna be able to get.

[24:41] Jaws 50th, man.

[24:42] If I'm buying a Stern,

[24:43] that's the only one I would really consider right now

[24:46] is a Jaws 50th.

[24:47] It's got the assets.

[24:49] It's got the layout.

[24:50] It is funny though that Stern made a Jaws game

[24:54] that doesn't eat the ball.

[24:56] And Spooky Pinball makes a Beetlejuice game

[25:00] where the Beetlejuice worm eats the ball.

[25:02] That's comical to me.

[25:04] It's comical to me.

[25:05] Again, this company and Benton that built this game

[25:07] in a barn has more creativity in it

[25:11] than this huge company with four or 500 employees.

[25:14] Stern, you gotta step up now.

[25:16] It's just that simple.

[25:18] And hey, this is what makes this hobby fun.

[25:20] There's gonna be highs and lows.

[25:22] And right now Stern is at a real low.

[25:24] And they need a game that takes them high again.

[25:26] Will it be Pokemon?

[25:28] Will it be Transformers?

[25:30] Will it be Fallout?

[25:31] I don't know.

[25:32] I haven't seen any of these games.

[25:33] I look forward to seeing them.

[25:34] I know this.

[25:35] The Spooky Crew, they've got their next year

[25:38] already sold out.

[25:39] They get to wake up every day and build

[25:42] one of the most highly anticipated games of the year.

[25:44] That's amazing.

[25:45] The Crew over at Barrels, same thing.

[25:47] They get to spend the next eight months

[25:49] building a game that's sold out in two days.

[25:52] That's a great thing.

[25:53] Whether or not the game's on the line right now,

[25:55] that's up for debate.

[25:56] I don't think it is.

[25:57] I think it's a little lame to stage that line.

[26:00] I do.

[26:01] David, you know I love you, man, but come on, man.

[26:03] We've seen this too many times.

[26:05] I was looking in that video, trying to see

[26:07] if Marty's shoes were in the corner, bro.

[26:10] This is not the game being on the line.

[26:12] Oh, we're quality testing.

[26:13] What does that mean?

[26:14] Is someone coming in there every day

[26:15] dusting the play field for a month?

[26:17] Oh, man, I'm gonna keep touching it.

[26:19] Will it dimple?

[26:19] Will it dimple?

[26:21] Come on, it's not on the line.

[26:22] And that wall of labyrinths unsold, not a good look, bro.

[26:26] Not a good look.

[26:27] Move those things somewhere else.

[26:29] Like if I was doing a factory tour,

[26:31] don't let them shoot that wall filled

[26:33] with unsold labyrinth machines, okay?

[26:36] Public relations, baby, marketing, everything matters.

[26:39] Kaneda loves you, Kaneda out.

[26:41] I wish I was a little bit taller.

[26:42] I wish I was a baller.

[26:43] I wish I had a girl with a good, I would call her.

[26:46] I wish I had a rabbit and a hat with a bat and six-four-four.

[26:50] I wish I was a little bit taller.

[26:52] I wish I was a baller.

[26:53] I wish I had a girl with a good, I would call her.

[26:56] I wish I had a rabbit and a hat with a bat and six-four-four.
