[00:00] I don't get it. I don't get these services.

[00:05] Like everything was working fine.

[00:09] Sorry for the delay.

[00:10] I don't, like it's all of a sudden

[00:12] it turned off super chats.

[00:15] You're working fine.

[00:16] Now it's like you need to verify your address.

[00:18] Like so, all this stupid tech, man.

[00:24] All this stupid tech just like the fact that

[00:28] I can't even get.

[00:30] I can't like super chats just turned off.

[00:33] I'm sorry for the delay.

[00:34] Like I don't understand

[00:36] how any of this garbage works.

[00:39] Like on Facebook, they don't let you mirror the image now.

[00:43] Like it's just idiotic.

[00:45] So you have to like,

[00:47] like, like, why not?

[00:49] It was working fine for years.

[00:51] And all of a sudden you can't mirror the image.

[00:53] So you have to read Dodger's backwards.

[00:56] On YouTube, I had super chats going perfectly now.

[00:58] It's like, oh, you have to verify it.

[01:00] Like what? What?

[01:01] It was all working fine.

[01:02] I verified everything.

[01:03] It's like they don't want to pay you out.

[01:05] I mean, that's all that comes down to is these damn tech companies

[01:08] are so greedy.

[01:09] They do no work.

[01:11] And then they make it hard for you to just like monetize

[01:14] your own damn content.

[01:16] It absolutely is so annoying on every level.

[01:23] But why? Why all of a sudden?

[01:26] I'll figure this out later.

[01:28] But now I can't make any money on YouTube because it's like

[01:30] shut off my ability to like have super chats.

[01:32] Why? When I was doing super chats perfectly for weeks.

[01:36] Great. Awesome. Thank you, YouTube.

[01:41] Unbelievable.

[01:42] How's everybody doing? Happy Halloween.

[01:46] Happy Halloween.

[02:24] Kind of annoys me.

[02:25] Kind of just like, yes, just so stupid.

[02:30] Like what is up with this?

[02:35] It's like you haven't completed the verification process

[02:39] for checking verifying now.

[02:42] Let's do this.

[02:47] I don't understand.

[02:52] Clicking the button, nothing happens.

[08:39] Dodgers baby.

[08:40] Dodgers can't stop.

[08:42] I'll pitch her last night.

[08:43] I fell asleep.

[08:44] I got to be honest.

[08:45] I fell asleep last night.

[08:46] So exhausting.

[08:47] The whole lead up to Halloween.

[08:50] Walking around with the kids.

[08:53] Beautiful.

[08:54] We had it was windy but we had a nice weather.

[08:56] It wasn't raining.

[08:57] But like I don't know what it was.

[08:59] But at like seven o'clock at night.

[09:01] I just like my whole system just shut off.

[09:04] It was like you dude you are done.

[09:06] You are done.

[09:07] You are not staying up.

[09:08] And I just crashed.

[09:13] Yeah.

[09:14] It's just trying to make the super chats turned off for some reason.

[09:16] I got to ask Carrie how to do all this because it's just.

[09:19] It's just silly.

[09:23] I was.

[09:24] I was a baby Sasha from a demon hunters.

[09:30] Again, if you guys haven't seen demon hunters go check it out.

[09:33] Go check it out.

[09:34] All right.

[09:35] So we look let's talk all about what's about to happen in pinball.

[09:41] We've got crazy crazy stuff about to hit.

[09:45] So let's start with what's going to happen first.

[09:48] The walking dead remastered Ellie is coming out on Tuesday.

[09:53] I'm traveling to Atlanta on Tuesday.

[09:56] So I probably packed my gear.

[09:59] But I'm not going to be home.

[10:01] All right.

[10:07] Nice Robert doing great got my taste back.

[10:11] Awesome man cancer free.

[10:14] Robert I'm so happy to hear that brother.

[10:19] For those of you say you're not going to watch kpop demon hunters.

[10:22] It's like really weird.

[10:23] It's just it's an amazing movie.

[10:24] Like I don't understand like I'm a 49 year old man that grew up.

[10:28] Love and lots of movies and films.

[10:30] It is one of the greatest like musical movies animated films.

[10:35] I've seen it just it is that great like just you could.

[10:41] You could say you're not going to watch it for some.

[10:43] I don't know like ignorant reason or you could watch it.

[10:46] It's actually terrific.

[10:54] No, no, no, no, I don't even have an eight year old.

[10:58] Anyway, so we've got first things first we've got the walking dead coming out Tuesday.

[11:05] It is coming out from stern and there's only 500 L.E.s and I've said it and I'll say it again.

[11:11] The L.E.s are going to sell out.

[11:13] Simply because there's 500 500 was always the magic number for a stern L.E.

[11:19] And there are so many new people in the hobby.

[11:23] That I've been buying these 1000 stern L.E. games and losing a fortune on this game is going to sell out just as fast as Metallica remastered sold out.

[11:35] Without a doubt.

[11:36] Without a doubt.

[11:37] Yes, everybody.

[11:38] A huge congrats to Rob.

[11:43] You know, look, nobody's going to want the old walking dead.

[11:48] Unlike Metallica because people forget this Metallica actually had with the dirty Donnie art package was like probably the first fully illustrated stern machine that they ever did before that it was all Photoshop drag and drop crap.

[12:02] And Gary didn't even want to do the dirty Donnie art package.

[12:05] So Metallica.

[12:07] The original still has like some uniqueness to it the original walking dead art package is horrendous.

[12:14] I want to say the walking dead came out I want to say before Metallica, but it was still like crappy drag and drop art.

[12:23] And I think if we see a stunning art package on the new walking dead.

[12:29] It's just going to sell out so fast because I think it's going to trump the original in so many more ways than one.

[12:37] And I think you know, I don't know like you could listen to canada if I were you I'm telling you the scalper a scalper's move would just be the scalp walking dead.

[12:45] Ali and we're going to talk a little bit about speculators and scalpers and flipping games for money and how this hobby is ruined by it.

[12:53] No, what's going to ruin this hobby is not people scalping for money.

[12:56] What will ruin this hobby is people losing three to five thousand dollars on every game.

[13:00] That is what will destroy pinball not the other way around.

[13:04] Scalping and secondhand value is healthy for a hobby.

[13:08] It doesn't ruin any hobby.

[13:10] How does it ruin it explain to me how that ruins the hobby that games actually go up in value.

[13:16] That holding on to your games.

[13:18] You know becomes a financial success for everybody that everybody who bought a stern Ali from two thousand eight to like twenty twenty one made money on their L's.

[13:32] The original john what's up brother the original walking dead art made it look like a dirty ash tray after a cook field all night or yeah it was bad.

[13:43] Why does everyone get so annoyed about reselling games is free market absolutely like you know look it's it's it's just like comical to me but here's the thing.

[13:52] I'm just going to tell you right now I think the walking dead remastered sells out instantly in day one.

[13:58] I think they're going to go.

[14:01] I think you know there's less of them than Winchester's mystery house right and when it comes to these remasters it's like people don't only you know look I think what's going to be interesting about the remastered on this one is is how nice.

[14:15] And how close to the Ellie is the premium because on Metallica I think the premium kind of sucked like that green premium was kind of crappy so everyone just wanted the Ellie.

[14:26] Now what's interesting about walking dead is you know will the premium be nicer than the Metallica premium will you feel no.

[14:37] A phone motive to trade up and spend three thousand more on the Ali.

[14:42] That the whole thing though and look I'm not I'm not ignorant to the fact that a stern Ali now means nothing.

[14:49] That they've made a stern Ali mean nothing so I don't really think it's going to.

[14:57] You know it's not going to have the same wow especially with Beetlejuice and Winchester and everything happening in the pinball world lately.

[15:04] The thing they can't shake is how their games just look and feel cheap.

[15:11] And that's it you know even it's getting harder for them to be put next to other games in a lineup and to look like they're worth that much money because remember like ostensibly it's going to be the same walking dead game that we once got for five to six thousand dollars it's not going to like play better.

[15:28] There's actually an opposite concern that they're going to make the game easier that part of what made the walking dead so great was the gameplay and was the challenge to the gameplay.

[15:39] It had a little bit of that holding on to survive a zombie apocalypse and will they make it easier.

[15:48] We shall see but I think a lot is riding on this game in terms of like will stern be able to get enough excitement to create a bridge between this and transformers which is next I don't think Pokemon is next I think we're going to see Elliott eyesman's transformer.

[16:05] And then we're going to see Pokemon from George Gomez and Jack danger.

[16:11] And mark my words so like let's let's speculate 13,000 for walking dead Ali are more than 500 people going to want one when they see it on Tuesday yes.

[16:23] And so do I think there's going to be an ability to flip of walking dead remastered Ali for a few thousand dollars over sticker I do but I think you're looking at.

[16:34] You know 13 get you on I think you're looking more 15 16 at most I don't think we're looking at like metallic as we're going for like 18 right away.

[16:42] So that's just that are you scalping J are giving away five of your pre-orders.

[16:48] Jad you mean K.

[16:51] I don't are you talking to me.

[16:55] Well I'm not scalping the games that spooky is giving me for for the Canadian club members I mean come on like that that would be like total loser move.

[17:05] That's not that's not that's not what's happening there.

[17:10] What I need to figure out from the folks at spooky is you know where we are and getting them and how we want to do it I'm going to have some fun with those five.

[17:23] It's it's going to be great there's going to be a you know I think they're all going to be spoken for so the Canadian five will become a little bit of a special thing.

[17:33] Maybe I asked for five show games.

[17:37] Look the fact that Luke and and again I'm not going to be a dead horse over these show games but the fact that Luke said he's no longer doing show games in the future leads me to believe that he knows 100%.

[17:47] It was a little bit of a weird move and it was like yeah we're just making more like to come on like all the rationale for it was bogus guys like oh we need to you know make sure that shows have like come on what what what what even the business now of like of show attendance matters like come on they could

[18:04] have sold every single beetle juice without even going to a show they don't need to have a presence at a show they don't need dealers to have five extra each to bring the shows like all that is BS everybody knows it.

[18:16] Luke knows it like the whole like well we did it in the past like all of it it was all spin it was all look and again like it just no one wants to see this I just don't want show games to become part of the

[18:28] pinball worlds vernacular like David Vaness is not making 50 show games because Winchester sold out in two days and it's just it's because the owner is because the dealers and the distros were crying like babies and they want it more games that is the only reason why they're making more move

[18:45] like that screws over the actual consumer who's thinking he's getting one of a thousand or 999 it's absolutely a ridiculous like oh we'll just make a few more that's not how it works in any collectable world okay

[19:00] and it's that and it's just that and like again like it was their decision it's another hundreds of thousands of dollars in their pocket

[19:09] and it dilutes a little bit of the nice because think about it like you have this clean 999 for 9999 dollars like that's the narrative 80 over here like my stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid and look I'm friends with these guys and I told them I thought it was stupid and now they're not doing it again so if it was smart they do it again

[19:33] no and I told this to them like that you built your you built your empire now on goodwill and transparency and that that was like a shady thing to do anyway

[19:52] but no I don't think the 80 show games are going to be like SLE's I don't know it's going to like care for a plaque because I think what spooky will end up just doing is like sending everybody else a show game plaque you know I'm saying like it's it's not like that like there's no difference like there's a difference between a batman SLE and the rest of the L is there's a difference between you know this and that this and that I'm going to tell you right now what's going to be bonkers and everybody better start saving up our

[20:20] back to the future's super limited edition

[20:24] so let's let's just pivot there for a second if you want to talk about an SLE let me tell you about what's coming there's 88 batman not sorry what I say batman 88 back to the future super limited editions

[20:37] now I know the idea behind like what what's been percolating behind the scenes but if you if you want to talk about what's going to be the hardest to get game it's going to be that and you know they're going to be expensive there's going to be 88

[20:52] there might be more than 88 but when you see what they're doing there might only be 88 where you okay I'm not going to say anymore but you know in that happens that's going to be like wow moment

[21:05] and it's going to be crazy to see what people do to try to get one it's also going to be fun to see what you know Dutch and you know coin taker and whoever else is offering them are going to do to get that game

[21:21] so I look forward to it it's like a year from now it's not you know it's literally like a year from now so it's not happening anytime soon but yeah

[21:33] no way I'm buying a pinball machine from a European company that's hanging on by a thread well Matthew who's that who's hanging on by a threat

[21:47] I don't I don't which company is that because you're not hanging on by a thread if you have back to the future you know I'm saying bro

[21:56] they're not hanging on by a thread they're about to just you know the dams going to break and they're going to have a they're going to be a cash cow

[22:04] Oh pinball brothers yeah I mean I look yeah I don't I don't even like I mean I don't even know how to like approach the pinball brothers with any true enthusiasm I really don't I don't

[22:19] look I think the pinball brothers bet big on a game and it didn't work out how much is the tariff on Alice is the same tariff that's on everything I think it is a 20% something like that

[22:36] you know look but Alice just got everybody a ticket to back to the future 500 of them first 500 back to the future regular additions will be Alice owners

[22:51] Okay so did anybody here anyone here in on a walking dead remastered at least simply because you love the game

[23:04] what do you guys think of the walking dead I'd love to hear from you guys what you think of the walking dead because I hear mixed things about the game I went on the top 100 it's not it's not that high up

[23:15] but the top 100 also is pretty pointless because it's like the top 40 games are like like 8.3 8.31 8.32 8.3 it's like whoa okay

[23:30] do you really even want the first 500 of a new machine won't the latter ones be built better I mean I don't know

[23:39] just played it this week it's a good game next great game challenging good tournament game code is great shoots crap

[23:49] bash target in a bad place yeah that well walkers always in a bad place literally one of my favorite games of all time I will die on that hill

[23:58] art sucked hard game and satisfying to get to hoard yeah I keep hearing like the hoard multi balls amazing I'm in and once is Paul it's lineman love the pin yeah I mean there are people that claim that this is lineman's best coded game ever I would argue it's Batman 66 is lineman's best coded game ever

[24:22] just because of what that man did still to this day is the greatest theme integration ever I think in pinball I think lineman's code in Batman is the greatest theme integration ever in pinball

[24:34] and I think the approach ability of Batman 66 and how fun it is to get through that code is so good and it's so campy and it's so fun and it's so rewarding I don't think I've ever yeah

[24:51] you know I really do think you know Stern is going to make a 60th anniversary of Batman and I think they're going to bring it back with the big screen I think they should do another run of like 90 s L is just you know at this point Stern just screw it like you've been even f and over everybody anyway you might as well keep doing it

[25:16] good morning everybody

[25:22] I don't think you're in the minority for not liking walking dead I think it's a polarizing theme I don't think everybody loves it

[25:35] did uh did people get winchesters before Halloween I think the four show games

[25:46] I think the four show games are those show games are those part of the five 25 I think they went out to customers

[25:58] you know look I um like I saw barrels doing a factory tour the day after spooky launches Beetlejuice

[26:07] um and I just like I don't know I feel like these guys these two companies they're funny to me they're just like back and forth with each other so

[26:16] the spooky is going to release Beetlejuice on Friday the 14th and then barrels has its factory tour on the 15th and I don't know man like I guess I don't know why you would time it then

[26:32] but it is what it is I think what's going to be next for David is is just getting games out so when we see the factory tour on the 15th at barrels what I hope to see you see here's the thing is when you do these factory tours on a

[26:51] Saturday like the line's not going it's more of like turning the where you know the factory into sort of a a

[27:01] showroom if you will for your company so I you know I just as I said I just really want to see these games go out I also think

[27:10] I'm like watching my inflatables it's so windy just below all over the place is funny

[27:16] um I'm just excited for people to get their Winchester's I think both of these companies hit hit it out of the park and I think barrels and spooky on top of each other both had very successful launches I definitely think

[27:32] Winchester probably was the more successful launch considering if I told you six months ago Winchester's mystery castle or mystery house

[27:45] would um would sell out in two days flat you would have been like your crazy so I think that one was more surprising the beetle juice like we knew it was

[27:56] and beetle juice is kind of like we are now right because we um we don't really know yet what the reality is with the you know with the market value and how hard it's going to be to get a beetle juice just yet like it it's like

[28:14] they're all spoken for it's weird right it's weird to me that like a game is sold out and we have to wait two weeks for the reveal

[28:21] I mean I don't I think we're what's what's why like what's gonna what happens on the 14th that I think both of them Stern and spooky drop the ball by not having a fried you have a Friday Halloween you have a Friday Halloween everyone's kind of off work everyone

[28:44] is chilling with their family and kids you have a Friday Halloween for the first time in a long time and neither Stern or spooky could reveal a game on Halloween

[28:58] like there was nothing new from spooky yesterday and I know they wanted to announce Beetle juice midnight at Halloween and then they went early for some reason maybe they were

[29:10] worried about walking I don't there's nothing to worry about you know you're gonna sell these games and all those show games but the fact that nobody had anything on Halloween was really disappointing from a marketing standpoint just it's just disappointing in general like we are all home we're all like in our costumes it would have been so much fun to have something to chew on

[29:39] yeah like like they they both they they both have done great things you know what what I love is I love competition I love competition and I think spooky and barrels are in direct competition with each other and it's funny because they they will only push each other to make each other's games better

[30:06] and I think if I were to look at both games right now like if we were to look at Dune and Winchester next to evil dead and soon to be Beetle juice you know I think they're both I don't think either platform or company is you know fully like on I think they're I think they're on a pretty even playing field

[30:31] you know I do I think spooky probably has the edge in mechanisms the Dune mech is cool but you know it's like I don't know like other than that there's really not anything that interesting happening in the Dune game

[30:44] am I wrong like other than the warm mech which you know I hear from players slows the game down a little bit it's it's it's cool but like after 50 times is there another mech in the Dune game that's really cool I think evil dead just load it with way more

[30:59] I think the you know they artwork is better on this francey game for sure but you know spooky still using like servos and you know some of the quality issues on spooky games are are not as nice as I think some of the build quality on the barrels so it's like you know they both have

[31:19] a little like pros and cons if you will but they're both looking really nice I you know like I wish if Dune had come out of the gate and I mean is with the different translate I just don't think people want to see Timothy Shammily really every mech slows the game down been saying that for yeah but John but John here's the thing you can't just have like you can't just have like wide open games John with no mechs and charge

[31:46] like 10 to 15 thousand dollars John because because John then what the water people paying for like you know I'm saying John like you can't you can't charge this much money if there's no mechanical engineering in the game you can't

[32:03] you can't what is the running rumor for what spooky game arrives after beetle juice I think they're going to do a small run of that motorhead game and I think they're going to ask I think next is going to be gremlins

[32:23] spooky games play like a carnival game pure fun whereas the barrels it's a progression play that holds up as well fall of the empire has no mechs I'm not saying no mechs I just don't use them as a gauge for game quality no but John I mean what we do is we definitely have to

[32:47] sort of evaluate a game's value on how many mechs are in it and do we feel like you know the engineering went in to justify the cost of the game you know look Harry Potter is a game without a lot of mechs you know I would say Harry Potter to me the most you know it's a game that doesn't have I I would like to see more mechanical wow and Harry Potter just I just the one thing I'm missing

[33:16] from Potter is the one like wow moment mechanically and whether you know I would love to have seen more of like the quidditch be more of a dramatic flying around hog wars I would love to have seen a castle with candles in the window and draw bridges opening up or something I just you know I don't know I I think Potter shoots great I think it's a wonderful shooter I think it's all about flow

[33:45] but when it comes to magic and the ball doing something magical I I don't feel it in that game no the code is great the code of Potter is great and that's the thing right it's like they really put a lot into the code I was just hoping for one more mechanical item in the game that would have done something like that was like you know ball disappears or something

[34:09] so now you need to file your financial all you just I don't know it okay Fizzy's like deleting comments

[34:19] comments what's the run okay a new South Park by spooky I don't know I don't know I definitely think spooky with the you know with the Rick and Morty success

[34:48] and then the sort of adult theme cartoon would be a territory I would explore for them again

[34:55] pinball needs to stay below 10,000 you think francey is hitting spooky will do Batman 89 I hope so but I don't see Batman as a spooky theme title

[35:13] I see goonies and gremlins as spooky themes I'm just gonna say it man like I don't know spooky could sell probably it could probably sell 500 focus focuses you know

[35:27] when I think about how little like you think about 525 games for an entire world of pinball buyers you ever just you ever just like think about that what's up

[35:41] jangas do you ever think about how like tiny that is for boutique to only to only have to sell 500 games to a global hobby buyer base that is consisting of men who have millions of dollars for the most part

[36:03] or at least like men who have at least like a hundred grand in disposable income sitting in their checking accounts

[36:10] you know I'm saying like like around the world I don't understand why it would be hard to hit the right theme to create that kind of demand

[36:25] and that's why like the you know the dune the dune games inability to sell even 500 games in six months you know I just think it's it's a it was a terrible idea to make dune

[36:41] and I know there's there always mad at me when I say that but it was a terrible idea and you get guess who thinks it's a bad idea the pinball buying community that still is not bought 500 of those games

[36:52] you know other than Wayne or he's saying oh yeah they're selling I've sold the whole container you sold eight or twelve at most

[36:59] you know if if David Van S announced GI Joe instant sell out if he announced he man masses of the universe instant sell out if he announced transformers instant sell out if he announced big trouble in little china instant sell out if he announced die heart

[37:13] fifth element instant sell out if he announced fairs builders day off instant sell out if he announced karate kid instant sell out if he announced matrix instant sell out if he announced rocky for which is having its anniversary this year

[37:26] rocky for instant sell out you would sell a thousand rocky for like that with that soundtrack instant sell out no grown man 40 to 60 is like Timothy

[37:42] shaman lays dune but again no market research what so ever you see I look I believe it when I say this I believe it when I say this the Winchester's mystery house is gonna be a blessing and a curse for David

[38:07] because I think it's going, I think it's gonna like reinforce that he knows what he's doing,

[38:19] but clearly he doesn't fully understand the themes people want.

[38:24] Because you know what I'm saying?

[38:25] Like when you're a boutique at you can't have a miss.

[38:31] And I'm just curious if like Winchester will make up for the lack of success of Dune or

[38:44] does it like, is it like a wash for them?

[38:48] I don't know.

[38:52] Well, yeah, I mean, people would just rather have a campy haunted house game that doesn't

[39:03] bring any, you know, Gen Z kids into the mix.

[39:09] Well, here is the thing, gang.

[39:15] Here is the thing.

[39:16] And again, I just really want to encourage everybody to play it.

[39:20] But Carl's game layout wise, I think is going to create, you know, I think it's going

[39:31] to be a little bit divisive.

[39:32] I don't think people are going to, I think people, some people are going to love it,

[39:36] some people are going to find it challenging.

[39:38] And again, like I just don't know yet.

[39:42] That's all I think that's like the fairest way for it to think about.

[39:45] I think more people are going to have to play it before we get a sense of, you know, what

[39:53] the gameplay is really like.

[39:55] But I don't know either.

[39:56] Like I just, I just talked to a lot of people at the show and I just got a mixed bag from

[40:03] people saying they really enjoyed it, from people saying it was too hard.

[40:07] Personally, I didn't find it like hard in the sense that it was just draining a lot.

[40:12] I just found, you know, the shots were just not as easy to find as they are on some other

[40:19] games.

[40:21] And then that's all like I'm absolutely super happy for them to sell those 525 like they

[40:26] did.

[40:27] I'm absolutely super happy that they showed everybody that you can come out with such

[40:33] a game and find such sales success so quickly.

[40:37] I think it's a really good thing.

[40:39] I think it's going to make more of these boutiques realize like you think about like

[40:43] Winchester's mystery house can just run circles around predator.

[40:48] Like when you think about that, right?

[40:51] Now there's the, there's all the obvious reasons why people stayed away from predator.

[40:55] But I mean, it's embarrassing for the pinball brothers to do what they did and it's hugely

[41:02] rewarding for the folks at barrels to bring that Winchester game to market because everything,

[41:09] everything they did, they did it right with that game.

[41:13] You have to have a special kind of stupid to screw up a license like Star Wars.

[41:18] Hey, Bill, how you doing?

[41:22] You know, Bill, I think that's stern, stern fumbling of Star Wars again.

[41:28] I don't think they realize the long tail impact and reputation harm that game will cause

[41:38] their organization.

[41:39] And in fact, Bill, I would argue that over the last four years, the management at Stern

[41:46] has made so many stupid decisions that have really hurt that company's reputation and

[41:54] they continue to make stupid decisions one after another.

[41:59] And I don't feel like anybody's accountable and I don't feel like they're taking their

[42:04] time to get it right.

[42:06] I think they have, you know, they've got the same playbook with the same approach, the

[42:12] same mediocrity, the same level of like cheap feeling platform and it's like they really

[42:18] just seem silly.

[42:21] But Star Wars, the biggest IP they will ever have next to Pokemon maybe, but it's the

[42:28] biggest IP for this audience.

[42:30] If they had made, finally made a magical Star Wars machine, if I'm just going to say this

[42:38] right now, the decision to not have Keith L. when makes Star Wars, F you stern.

[42:49] You've got the best designer in the world and you've got the IP that is the biggest

[42:55] IP that all of your pinball buying fans are into like Star Wars is it.

[43:02] You give Keith L. when King Kong, if Star Wars had the King Kong layout, we are not having

[43:14] this conversation about how Stern messed up Star Wars again.

[43:19] It just goes to show you the kind of company Stern pinball has become.

[43:24] A company of politics, a company of committees, a company that doesn't all rally around the

[43:32] opportunity they have with the theme they have.

[43:36] And I don't care what anybody says, what a dumb move and wake the F up, George, new CMO guy,

[43:46] Gary, what are you doing?

[43:48] You've got all the Star Wars assets in the world, all the clips, everything you can use.

[43:54] And you've got the best designer in pinball and you need a hit game and you give this

[44:00] dude King Kong with no F in assets and you make a King Kong game look like a kids comic

[44:06] book.

[44:08] And you don't, so you have the money to get Star Wars and all of the assets and you don't

[44:14] have the money to go get clips from King Kong movies that are much cheaper than the old

[44:20] ones have no celebrities inside them.

[44:23] And then you make the art package look like a book I buy for Killian that I get at the

[44:27] pharmacy.

[44:30] And then you think you're the, what do you want, what do you want us to do?

[44:34] How did you want us to respond to this?

[44:36] And then everybody who bought a King Kong LE has now lost thousands of dollars in value.

[44:42] And then you follow it up with what?

[44:44] With what was after King Kong?

[44:47] It wasn't there another game like with Star Wars the next game?

[44:51] No, I'm missing a game.

[44:53] What was after King Kong?

[44:55] Was it, wasn't, it wasn't D&D.

[44:58] That was before King Kong.

[45:00] Help me out here because I'm so like, I'm so used to the mediocrity of these games.

[45:06] Joe, okay, so jaws 50.

[45:08] So back to the well again and jaws is a good game.

[45:13] You know why jaws is a really good game because Keith L.

[45:16] When made it.

[45:17] But you literally been doing this crap over and over and over again.

[45:21] Everyone's tired of it.

[45:23] And like whatever, I mean, cool, cool remake walking dead.

[45:27] And then, you know, it's all going to come down.

[45:31] It's all going to come down to Elliot, Iseman's, Transformers.

[45:35] And you know, don't mess it up.

[45:37] Don't mess it up.

[45:38] What was the last great Stern game?

[45:41] What was the last great Stern game?

[45:45] I would say jaws.

[45:47] And I would say it's not even great.

[45:50] Like it's good, but I don't find the jaws layout to be great.

[45:55] Because I actually think that King Kong layout is better than jaws.

[45:59] I do.

[46:02] I do.

[46:02] I think that King Kong layout is more rewarding to shoot than jaws.

[46:13] Play it more.

[46:24] I just, I'm frustrated because like, I don't want Keith L.

[46:30] I don't want them to work on fall out next.

[46:33] Fall out.

[46:36] Bring his home already.

[46:37] Fall out.

[46:38] Soccer's too cold out there to play soccer.

[46:43] Joe says incredible theme integration.

[46:50] Incredible.

[46:53] Does Jersey Jack Pimble have Ghostbusters?

[46:55] I'll find out.

[46:57] I'll find out if they do.

[47:00] I don't know.

[47:01] Maybe the thing about J.J.P. having Ghostbusters gang is like, you know, you know, like far away.

[47:10] That is like two years away.

[47:14] I love that people are now trying to be like, Avatar is good, man.

[47:16] Avatar is good.

[47:17] Avatar owners trying to convince us that game is great is like, I can't.

[47:21] I can't.

[47:23] I can't.

[47:24] It's just too soulless, man.

[47:25] It's too soulless of a gate.

[47:27] Sorry.

[47:27] Too soulless of a game.

[47:30] Yes.

[47:31] Sonic the Hedgehog is next.

[47:34] How many of you guys?

[47:35] Hey, anybody here want a Beetlejuice that didn't get one?

[47:44] Anybody here?

[47:45] I still think that Ghostbusters is Zambi Eddy's best art package for any Stern ever.

[47:51] I do.

[47:53] I still think it's his best art package ever.

[48:00] G and R is the you want a G and R bro.

[48:02] I got one right here.

[48:05] Oh, man, every time I turn on my G and R, it's like, I love looking at the lights.

[48:12] I just hard.

[48:15] I wish they would have like music videos in it.

[48:18] You know, I get kind of tired of seeing.

[48:21] Because I mean, Axel weighs about like 40 pounds less now than he did when he, the footage

[48:26] we have in this game.

[48:29] G and R is the only.

[48:34] Matthew got shut out on BJ.

[48:36] But Matthew, are you going to, why don't you try, are you going to try to get one by

[48:40] call, here's the deal game.

[48:43] Don't try to go on spooky's website.

[48:45] Call them.

[48:47] Call them them.

[48:48] Like just keep ringing the phone.

[48:52] When the game goes on sale.

[48:57] Food fighters is the best yeti art.

[48:59] I don't, I don't think so.

[49:00] I like food fighters.

[49:01] Don't get me wrong.

[49:02] I like a lot of Yeti stuff.

[49:03] I do.

[49:04] I just don't like Yeti's King Kong.

[49:05] I also don't like the fact that King Kong's got two artists on it.

[49:09] I don't like the play field.

[49:10] I did the play field.

[49:11] It's just a disaster.

[49:12] I mean, I think, it's not even like Yeti's cabinet artwork that it's like that orange,

[49:17] the orange green, like the rainbow puke on the King Kong play field is just so embarrassing.

[49:26] I was embarrassed for them.

[49:28] How is that King Kong?

[49:31] Who thought that would be a good idea?

[49:35] And again, I just think Yeti as the art director at Stern, you know, he just needs to like look

[49:40] over this.

[49:41] And I look, he was like, you know, he was mad that people were like complaining about

[49:44] it because he's like, you know, I guess it was the artist who did the, you know, was

[49:49] it Congo or original King Kong play field?

[49:52] But man, it's like Jeremy, Jeremy, like what matters is people, people don't like it.

[49:59] You know what I'm saying?

[50:00] Like they have this sense of like people should be showing respect to the people who like

[50:04] no, bro, it's like you're making a very expensive product.

[50:08] And you know, you need to figure out a way to like connect with the people that want to

[50:12] buy it, bro.

[50:14] Which means maybe bring in some focus groups and show them a few options of what you're

[50:18] thinking.

[50:19] See this whole thing of like you guys are going to make these games in a vacuum, then

[50:22] charge us all this money.

[50:24] And then we're not allowed to not like it.

[50:26] We're not allowed to like think it's not great.

[50:29] You know, Kevin O'Connor, whatever, who cares, like nobody cares.

[50:32] Nobody cares.

[50:33] It Kevin O'Connor did the artwork.

[50:35] What they want is a King Kong game that looks like the King Kong they know.

[50:40] They don't care.

[50:41] They don't care.

[50:44] So, y'all, it's a f Person.

[50:57] And actually, whether I press this button for, I don't want to give a F tengan cul.

[51:04] Um Yeah, I'm going to go now, um ha, we're doing a castle, uh, so whats 6,

[51:12] 8 or 8.

[51:13] It teleports you right away into the movie and the world and the universe you love

[51:21] That is what a great pin does and it like and even just like the way like Roy's like getting into his Jeep

[51:28] You know his truck in the in the village

[51:32] It's it's so beautifully done where Star Wars is lazy garbage code

[51:38] The moment you hit start on Star Wars

[51:41] It feels

[51:43] instantly cheap

[51:44] It there's no there's no

[51:47] That the reason why everybody loves Star Wars is there was a romanticism to the story

[51:54] there was a

[51:57] grittiness

[51:59] Rowness to it that when you for some reason when I play Stern Star Wars, I feel like they've missed

[52:06] Completely everything that pulled us in the Star Wars as children

[52:11] like that game should start

[52:13] And it should be like you should be like on Tatooine

[52:16] Like staring up at the moons, you know

[52:20] Like you should they should have like figured out a way to make you feel

[52:24] Like Luke going on this epic you should play as Luke

[52:29] going on this epic journey

[52:32] to like

[52:34] Save your father like that's the story of Star Wars

[52:39] You know what when you hit start on Stern Star Wars

[52:43] it's just

[52:45] It's just a blender of of BS of everything just like all of a sudden you know glowworm job

[52:51] I like this and that like there's just no romance to any of it

[52:56] It just feels like a

[52:59] Star Wars slot machine in in a way like it just it doesn't capture any of the

[53:04] Emotion it doesn't build to any of the moments in the movies

[53:10] It's just kind of like just a slot machine feel

[53:16] What people call me when they know I'm doing my show hold on

[53:21] And

[53:24] Anything is like when you turn on Godzilla. It's the opposite you feel like you're in that Star Wars world

[53:35] You know you're telling me

[53:39] You know they they should have had a lightsaber under the glass when you finally learn how to like use your lightsaber. It should light up

[53:49] Game is so cheap it looks so bad the spinner sounds are sweet. You guys like our expectations are rock bottom if we're if we're impressed by spinner sounds

[53:59] Again, can we talk about Damien?

[54:06] Can we talk about Damien Harden

[54:10] Can we talk about his comeback?

[54:12] Can we can we talk about can we talk about this? Let me um

[54:18] I you know because for just for like I was just curious. I'm like I wonder if this guy I like

[54:24] All I did was Google his name and

[54:32] I right away

[54:35] There he is

[54:37] And he's got a new website up in when she talks about

[54:43] Yeah, I really I'm just shocked. I'm shocked that he would even have the audacity

[54:54] To even you know just to put in the final paragraph like I understand that he's a man

[54:59] He's got a family. He's trying to make a living and he had an unsuccessful pinball venture. That's fine

[55:05] That's fine, but man did you read that final paragraph like hold on let's let's go look at this. I'm gonna share screen on on YouTube

[55:17] I mean like baby he's back

[55:21] He's back

[55:24] You know Damien Harden transforming enterprise technology for three decades as a veteran technology leader and innovator

[55:33] I've spent 30 years

[55:36] Driving digital transformation across multiple industries sounds a lot like Andrew highway

[55:42] You know these guys are always like they're always like a jack of all trades or just for 30 years

[55:47] I've been so successful at everything I've done right

[55:50] But I want to just go down. I mean first of all

[55:54] This is just amazing this this this new Damien suit and tie

[55:59] Long gone is the rock star hair

[56:02] Long gone is you know all the you know the look now he's back. Let's just do this him. He's back

[56:10] He's a

[56:12] He's a change man. He's a change man

[56:15] But I want to read the cuz like all this

[56:18] To me the entrepreneurial chapter of my life this part

[56:27] Where he talks about how he's the owner and CTO of a manufacturing company I

[56:35] Have seamlessly integrated modern technology and traditional manufacturing processes

[56:42] Establishing a successful export operation serving markets across northern USA

[56:49] Canada Europe and Australia our facility managed sustain production across three

[56:55] District distinct product lines. Well, is that is that pinball or something else?

[57:01] So I don't even make if that's pinball or something else, but when when did he do that?

[57:06] When did you do that was that before or after pinball?

[57:13] I mean, I just like I can't I

[57:16] Can't you know like like literally the dude stole like I think a couple of like I don't even steal it

[57:23] But he like deep like he took like two thousand dollar or two million dollars almost

[57:29] I feel like in company in customer money, but here's the part I don't get

[57:34] Here's the part I don't get I

[57:36] Just don't know how you wake up and you look in the mirror

[57:41] Knowing that hundreds of thousands if not a couple million dollars in customer money that you

[57:50] You took and then never delivered pro and then you're gonna put up a website that you've been successful for 30 years

[57:59] I just don't get it. I just don't get it

[58:03] like you know in the end

[58:05] There is like this this you know like because here's what I think happens with these people

[58:11] I think they justify I think they rationalize their failures as like some ventures work out some don't right LLC's like we're entrepreneurs

[58:20] Like not everything we do is gonna be successful

[58:23] but like you know, but I don't understand how you wake up

[58:30] In such a like such a small niche community that you burned

[58:35] And you don't do whatever it takes

[58:38] To make those customers whole and pay them back

[58:41] And you know what I'm saying like you sell your load is you sell your sports car like you take out a second mortgage on your house

[58:47] Like whatever you do like you go work two jobs like whatever you do

[58:51] How do you wake up and look yourself in the mirror and how do you like?

[58:58] How do you like

[58:59] Remark it yourself like this how do you reintroduce yourself to the world as a success?

[59:04] When you still owe all these people money

[59:11] I mean that's just I wouldn't be able to do it. I

[59:15] Would I be working three jobs? I be I?

[59:18] Be eating peanut butter sandwiches until I figured out a way to get those people you know whole again

[59:26] Bill said he's one of those chameleons that sounds like a CEO when really they are nothing more than a failure

[59:33] You know it's funny bill is like when you read his website. I

[59:40] Mean Andrew highway used to talk the same way he was CEO CEO like he had a board of directors and like CEO like

[59:47] Andrew highway was accepting business awards for being the most successful

[59:52] British pinball manufacturing company like all like it's amazing to me because what you'll never see me do

[59:58] And again, I I know I'm good at marketing

[01:00:03] I've some awards. I don't

[01:00:05] But I'm a I'm a member of a company and a member of a team and I'm only as good as

[01:00:12] Sometimes the team around me and I'm only you know everything that I do requires a group effort to get to good execution

[01:00:18] And it's not just me. It's a there's always you know a lot of people around me that are good and and I

[01:00:25] Just I just you know, I don't have like a website like I would I don't

[01:00:30] I don't know who they're talking to like who what is this website even like who's it even trying to like reach

[01:00:41] You know, I just don't get it's almost like it's almost like they're just trying

[01:00:47] To have something so when they start their next scam

[01:00:53] Something pops up on the internet

[01:00:56] Now when you Google my name on the internet you get my bedroom arcade you get my pinball podcast

[01:01:01] You know get all the gaming stuff I've been doing for a while and that's fine. It's who I am

[01:01:05] You know, there's never gonna be like oh like this guy claims he's in the pinball this guy claims

[01:01:09] He's like in the gaming like I this who I am I'm not trying to and I'm not asking anybody for for any money to do anything

[01:01:15] I

[01:01:24] Don't know I don't know like I'm just happy I found that page because like it's you know

[01:01:29] What's what's great about the internet?

[01:01:31] This is like the one good thing about like the internet it has a long tail like you you can't

[01:01:36] Like when Andrew highway tried to start his remember when he bought that hydrophoil like that boat

[01:01:42] And he was gonna like try to scam people in Australia or New Zealand to

[01:01:48] To sort of like

[01:01:49] Rejuvenate this super expensive boat and you know, I don't I he almost would have got away with it if it wasn't for people being able to search and find

[01:01:58] All the pinball people that were like this guys are fraud

[01:02:08] You know, it's just it is what it is

[01:02:11] I mean if there's one thing I'm not I'm not a fraud. I'm not a fraud

[01:02:14] I will never tell you I can do something I can't do for you

[01:02:17] I will never take your money and then not deliver what I promised on it in fact I'm the opposite

[01:02:25] You get way more for your money than five dollars a month

[01:02:29] Way more for those of you who subscribe at just five dollars a month the amount of content you get is

[01:02:35] It's insane how little and how much you get

[01:02:40] But as I said I would not raise my rates and I haven't through this whole as the world gets way more expensive

[01:02:48] Not gonna do it now look I may be exploring in the future. I've said this before I may be exploring

[01:02:54] new ways to sort of

[01:02:57] monetize my connection to pinball because after 12 years of doing this I do think

[01:03:04] it's time and

[01:03:07] Hopefully there'll be more to come on that

[01:03:09] In the near future, but it's time like it's just it's silly. It's silly like I have all these people

[01:03:15] They love can a dispimble podcast, but they love the personality and you know, it's about time

[01:03:21] I get into the game a little bit differently and you're you're never gonna

[01:03:25] I'm just telling this right now. You're never gonna lose the podcast

[01:03:27] The podcast is never gonna lose its integrity the podcast is never gonna hold back the podcast is never gonna stop telling you how I feel about all these games

[01:03:36] It's just not and you'll see what what I mean when it when it happens, but it's just gonna be

[01:03:41] It's gonna be the best of both worlds

[01:03:43] best of both worlds and

[01:03:46] You know, that's it. That's it

[01:03:49] I just know this hobby too well and I want to give you guys another way to like engage with with me and my family and help me out

[01:03:56] And I'll help you out and we all win. It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fun

[01:04:00] It's gonna be fun at

[01:04:03] Yeah more to come on that

[01:04:07] It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fun. It's gonna be fun. It's all I'm gonna say. I'm gonna have me some fun

[01:04:13] I'm gonna have me some fun

[01:04:15] 30 years of technological expertise

[01:04:20] First of all

[01:04:22] There's no like there's only like a few distros

[01:04:25] Okay, distros are like big big organizations

[01:04:29] All right, most people are dealers out there like Zack's a dealer. He sells a ton of games

[01:04:34] We still a dealer. I don't think it matters. I don't think anyone cares like nobody cares. Nobody cares

[01:04:42] I still don't understand why you don't have a job in market. Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing

[01:04:48] I

[01:04:49] Two things I don't think any marketing job in this industry pays even remotely close to what

[01:05:00] Marketing salaries are in my industry. So there's that right so like cool

[01:05:04] I could have my dream pinball marketing job and take a 60% pay cut. So there's that then

[01:05:14] The company that I

[01:05:17] Want it to work for

[01:05:21] At a year ago was stern and I may know I may know

[01:05:26] I

[01:05:30] Was direct with them

[01:05:32] Now let me just ask you a year ago

[01:05:34] When I when I presented the stern and said hey like you need help

[01:05:38] I know the audience better than you guys do because I

[01:05:42] Interact with the I said this to their faces. I interact

[01:05:46] With pinball collectors and buyers of your LEDs way more than you do

[01:05:51] You don't interact with them

[01:05:53] You I know your audience of that side of your business better than you do you might know your locations and you might know how to sell the

[01:06:01] Distros and you might have your you know mr. Sharper in around with the stern army, but you don't know collectors like I do and

[01:06:10] What you need to do from a chief marketing officer role is you need to reestablish this companies

[01:06:18] Affinity with those individuals and and you need to build bridges back to those individuals and

[01:06:23] After a year and stern hiring a new CMO. Let me again. I just I asked this question every week

[01:06:30] Have you heard anything from the stern CMO ever?

[01:06:36] ever

[01:06:39] I just don't think you can be the chief marketing officer at a pinball company that is a community driven industry and

[01:06:47] Be behind the scenes

[01:06:49] And

[01:06:51] And that's just my feeling on it now look

[01:06:55] Did I think they were gonna hire me no?

[01:06:58] Do I know all of the baggage I come with yes?

[01:07:02] Would I have been would they have would they have?

[01:07:04] Would they have had people like complain and backlash if they hired me?

[01:07:09] Absolutely, but I also do know that in the end

[01:07:14] They would have been better off with someone of my nature not you know whether it's me or not

[01:07:19] I just think they need it a

[01:07:21] Jolt of something and they needed a disruptive hire like myself. I

[01:07:27] I believe that I

[01:07:29] Believe they would have been better off with me than without me

[01:07:34] And that's it well because I told them Josh as like look the majority of

[01:07:39] The information you need to be successful as a CMO its stern pinball that knowledge is

[01:07:45] It's you can't just acquire it you have to live it and

[01:07:51] You know, I was 12 years into their industry that guy doesn't have any experience in pinball again

[01:07:57] But this is how it works in business people just transfer over they have their MBAs. I like I see it every day

[01:08:03] They they they have MBAs

[01:08:05] They're successful over here then they go over here, you know, they come from they might come from Disney

[01:08:10] They come over to pinball. It's so different. They go from WWE to pinball. They go from video games to pinball

[01:08:15] But you know what they had was

[01:08:18] someone with 25 years of marketing and

[01:08:22] 12 years of those was pinball

[01:08:25] expertise because and if I think about my pinball expertise it literally was

[01:08:32] Passion on the job like I mean I'm on the job every week like following their industry

[01:08:39] religiously and I bet that they're

[01:08:42] You know, I bet that the people they've brought in from the outside barely thought about pinball ever

[01:08:47] They just wanted a different job

[01:08:49] And so and you so like you get what you pay for you can't even put a price tag on the institutional knowledge

[01:08:57] I have of the pinball community

[01:09:03] And they just you know, they just didn't take the risk

[01:09:09] And look I don't wake up and like regret anything. I mean I I love my life

[01:09:13] I love my family. I love my house. I you know, I love where I'm at, you know, I'll do it as long as I can

[01:09:19] But it's nice to know that if I need to figure out like another career option

[01:09:23] That there's absolutely opportunities within pinball from for me the same way there are opportunities for Zach

[01:09:30] Many for Ken Cromwell

[01:09:33] You know opportunities for Donald Garrison opportunities for a lot of people man like a lot of people have like other jobs

[01:09:39] And they pivot and find you know a successful whether it's side gig or new career in pinball

[01:09:47] There's there's enough money to be made in this hobby

[01:09:50] For people to have livelihoods in it a lot of dealers and distors are making a lot of money a lot of manufacturers are making a lot of money

[01:10:01] And it's a beautiful little hobby. It's a beautiful little industry. It's it's just big enough to really fully understand it from A to Z

[01:10:11] You know

[01:10:13] Manufacturing is obviously the hardest part

[01:10:16] Can a to DM me at some point Josh. Yeah sure just just DM me. I don't just I don't just can you DM me just easier?

[01:10:22] I don't know where to find your DM

[01:10:26] But yeah, no, it's good. It's good. I'm happy

[01:10:31] How refreshing you are a

[01:10:43] Let's say I'm just reading canator that dude came from the video game. Okay

[01:10:51] Yeah, I mean Greg Greg I mean obviously Zach is doing great for flipping out, you know

[01:10:57] I mean

[01:10:58] Everyone but that's look people should help each other out

[01:11:03] You know here is the truth about life

[01:11:06] Here's a truth about life

[01:11:10] You will you will find happiness in life not because of what you studied

[01:11:15] Not because of where you went to school. You will find success in life

[01:11:20] Nine out of ten times it will come from

[01:11:24] People you meet

[01:11:26] People you meet

[01:11:28] The network you make the community you get in you invest in that is where success will happen in life my father

[01:11:38] Was you know he worked at a big company, but early in his career

[01:11:43] He got connected through work

[01:11:47] To an individual that became the CEO of Bristol Myers Squibb so as

[01:11:55] You know and my dad worked hard to impress that gentleman to the point where that man wanted my dad on his team

[01:12:02] There are a lot of other people working in the same

[01:12:05] Field that didn't build that relationship that didn't make that connection happen so when

[01:12:12] That gentleman ascended he brought with him the people

[01:12:17] That he wanted and this is what Gen Z and the kids don't get they they think

[01:12:23] Like none of that matters they don't they don't put in the time the effort for the relationships

[01:12:29] They don't go to the happy hours they don't

[01:12:31] Instigate relationship building moments with anybody senior they simply sit back and

[01:12:37] Complain about the way the world is how expensive everything is and how they don't want to work is as hard and it's like

[01:12:43] You know many times like I'm the senior most creative person in my department in New York, right?

[01:12:49] How many times I invite people out they say no how many times do they actually?

[01:12:54] Like try to build bridges with me. They don't okay cool and then I know all the senior leaders at my company and we get along great and it's

[01:13:02] Personal it's and professional, but it's personal too I go out of my way

[01:13:07] To ask people to go out to grab a drink to talk about family talk about life like and so when it comes to pinball

[01:13:15] This is the way it should be

[01:13:17] You know, we should help each other out. We should help each other find success if if someone's not happy in their day job

[01:13:23] And they can have a career in pinball

[01:13:25] What a beautiful thing I never look

[01:13:29] Down on any of that like that's the way life should work

[01:13:32] But yeah, you're gonna find success in who you know and what's cool about pinball is

[01:13:36] We've all met really interesting people in this hobby that amongst just our network

[01:13:44] I think everybody here would always like help out and make sure everybody you know could land on their feet regardless of what happens to them in life

[01:13:59] Yeah, no fizzy I

[01:14:01] Fizzy

[01:14:03] The the amount you know what gents you know what the kids now consider happy hour they think it's creepy

[01:14:10] They think inviting them out for a drink is creepy. They think it's an invasion on their free time

[01:14:18] They they actually

[01:14:21] Relish and enjoy saying no

[01:14:23] The amount of like they think the way it works is that the senior people have to win them over

[01:14:31] I think this is this is actually how things happen now and it's funny like I said someone

[01:14:38] A few times I was trying to just like get to know better like you know

[01:14:42] I'm a senior executive in the organization and you know they we were working on some things together

[01:14:49] I just want to get to know them a little bit better

[01:14:51] You know outside of the transactions of the job and

[01:14:56] Three four times like

[01:14:58] Hey like and I'm like why am I doing this?

[01:15:01] Why am I constantly trying to manage down and and when when people

[01:15:08] Over that are doing like none of them are trying to win me over none of them are trying to impress me with anything

[01:15:13] None of them are trying to like it's like they don't even care like that's what I don't get you working corporate America

[01:15:18] Don't you want like that job? Don't you want that salary?

[01:15:22] Don't you want to live in that town? Don't you want to drive that car?

[01:15:25] Don't you want to have like those vacations? Don't you want to have your airline seat?

[01:15:29] Like I don't understand like what do you want?

[01:15:31] What do you think is gonna happen? You think like

[01:15:34] It's just like you're just gonna get a

[01:15:38] You know a raise every year and then it's just gonna be given to you

[01:15:41] Well, you don't know anybody like no one's gonna go to bat who's going to bat for you?

[01:15:46] I look again

[01:15:48] I feel blessed to have been in my industry when I was in you know as long as I've been and and through periods of time

[01:15:56] Where things were different?

[01:15:57] Things were different man

[01:15:59] We used to travel the sea clients more often. I used to go down and would land at a visit co

[01:16:04] We'd stay at the four seasons hotel. We'd take the clients out for dinner for all four a one hour meeting the next day

[01:16:10] We we we we met it we like we like bond it

[01:16:14] And I I mean, I do feel bad for these kids like they all they do is like they come in a work and they go on their computer

[01:16:19] And they sit and they do these kinds of like calls all day long on a computer like what okay?

[01:16:23] So the clients down the block we literally have clients down the block. Have you invited them to lunch ever?

[01:16:31] Have you invited them to the Japanese jazz bar like I do all the time?

[01:16:34] Have you have you just asked to pop by and spend the day working there instead of just coming in here shoulder shrugging like

[01:16:41] You know when they leave us for a competitive agency because nobody's nobody's building those bridges

[01:16:49] You know, look in the end of the day the only way that people are gonna like survive what AI is gonna do is through

[01:16:56] interpersonal relationships

[01:16:58] Because AI will never replace a relationship. It just won't and

[01:17:03] Look, they're just gonna turn it on and find efficiencies and the first people that always will go are the people that have no

[01:17:09] relationships

[01:17:10] They're the first ones to get cut no relationships

[01:17:15] It's harder to like let people go when you when you know them

[01:17:19] You know what I'm saying it's harder because you want them you want to walk through the door and see them every day

[01:17:29] Now look I know there's always like oh well we're gonna be their boss one day and we're just gonna use AI

[01:17:35] And we're gonna use AI to build apps and build this and make money like it's I don't know maybe who knows

[01:17:42] Who knows six seven you guys know the six seven me are we all six seven six seven

[01:17:49] It's a by you know it's been one of my new ideas I'm bringing

[01:17:52] of

[01:17:54] But look there's a lot of cool kids out there too and coolness trickles up

[01:18:00] It doesn't trickle down and so you know

[01:18:02] I I've got some people at work that are just awesome and they're young and they're junior and they're hungry and

[01:18:08] They're sarcastic and they're smart and they're in it and

[01:18:13] You know I'll do everything I can to ensure that they have great careers and that these are the people that stick around

[01:18:19] I mean, there's just the way it goes

[01:18:22] You know, and then there's the people that you sit next to for freaking years

[01:18:26] They don't say two words to you like you walk in is like I don't understand they were all like we're not big

[01:18:38] Yeah, no, it's it's like it's it's it's a weird thing it's a weird thing

[01:18:45] Interpersonal relationships

[01:18:48] You know the

[01:18:50] When you look at the numbers of I someone just shared a story around the other day

[01:19:28] This is like the thoughts they're putting into like kids heads, but like having a boyfriend's embarrassing and that you should you don't need

[01:19:37] You don't need anybody else. You don't need a partner in life. You don't need

[01:19:42] Yeah, yeah, okay, keep keep going down that road and we're gonna you know fill in with AI bots and virtual girlfriends and boyfriend

[01:20:10] Where it's all about you as the individual and see see what where you end up

[01:20:16] miserable

[01:20:17] lonely the press

[01:20:20] Nobody to talk to nobody to go on vacation with like it's funny. I just but again like this is like for some reason

[01:20:28] For some reason we're sort of selling the youth

[01:20:34] on this like isolationism is like the

[01:20:38] It is is a sign of like

[01:20:41] freedom and empowerment

[01:20:44] Now look I'm all four in your 20s just have fun like I'm all four of that like but there comes a point where you gotta like

[01:20:51] You gotta start having some different kinds of goals and different, you know

[01:20:56] Figure stuff out

[01:21:02] Mizra

[01:21:04] Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't know anyway

[01:21:10] Anything you guys want to cover before we end the show today. Who's a good one?

[01:21:13] Sorry for the weird beginning, but I got to figure out the monetization of this thing

[01:21:19] The world's gonna be all right. I just want to say that we're all gonna be all right like

[01:21:24] I've been I've been getting really into this like flat earth

[01:21:28] Have you had have you guys got you guys need to go like just listen to the flat earth conspiracy

[01:21:34] About how Aunt Arctica is sort of the

[01:21:38] The the like the crust around our entire planet and how

[01:21:44] The Sun is actually right next to us. It's not

[01:21:48] Millions of miles away and it's it's local. It's it's amazing like I

[01:21:53] I love I love like diving in to certain things like this because it's to me like flat earth theory is

[01:22:00] Is kind of like Winchester's mystery house and I'll explain what I mean by that

[01:22:06] sometimes

[01:22:07] The best way to be entertaining and get people engaged is just to come out of nowhere with something they were never expecting right so if I

[01:22:17] if I

[01:22:18] If I is sort of like

[01:22:21] Deliver another mediocre Star Wars and you knew Star Wars was coming and you knew it was gonna suck and then it came out and it did suck

[01:22:27] You're like yeah, like you're like you're already over it

[01:22:31] But if I come in with like Winchester's mystery house you didn't even know it was coming and now it's available and it looks pretty interesting

[01:22:37] And I've got you like it's like I didn't expect that to come out of your mouth

[01:22:40] They're pretty even like know anything about this and now you you're learning about this new mystery house

[01:22:45] That's real and it's got some evidence of like some supernatural

[01:22:49] Elements and it's the Winchester like you know

[01:22:52] Gun company and rifle company and it's like all it's like wow you like you can't stop getting enough

[01:22:59] That's what happens when someone's like yo bro like the earth is flat and

[01:23:04] Beyond Antarctica is a continent twice the size of the United States were in

[01:23:09] Intelligent race of people is living and watching the rest of us and that the moon landing was fake and there were no dinosaurs and the moon is not even real like you literally

[01:23:20] What you know, it's like what I

[01:23:23] Never saw this coming and all of a sudden it's like really interesting to hear all about it now

[01:23:29] Having they're all saying the same thing and you know, it's like

[01:23:33] It's kind of like they they can't disprove like they they can't prove any of it and the things they say are not real are

[01:23:40] So strangely the like approach like the earth is not round because of this and you know, it's amazing

[01:23:47] Like they literally have a weird

[01:23:51] Rationale for everything happening

[01:23:57] Yeah, no, I'm all for the flat earth theory like I think the world needs crazy

[01:24:02] We need more crazy. We need more weird. It doesn't hurt anybody to think the world is flat

[01:24:07] It as long as we treat each other with respect and

[01:24:10] We you know, we raise our kids the question things and and that's kind of what's good about the flat earth theory that it kind of

[01:24:18] instills in each and every one of us that we should be

[01:24:22] Conspiracy analyst like we should look at the world and

[01:24:27] Analyze it a little bit more and wonder what's real what's not especially now in a world of

[01:24:32] fake everywhere and deep fakes and AI like we really have to teach our kids

[01:24:38] To don't take everything at surface value and really you know only truly

[01:24:45] Truly believe at what six inches in front of your face and what your hands can feel in your eyes can see

[01:24:51] You know because you know, it's even that's like gonna be hard
