[00:00] I've got another confession to make, I'm gonna feel, Everyone's got the chains to break, Holding you.

[00:15] Ah, Happy Monday everybody, welcome to Canada's Pinball Podcast, what a week it's gonna be for Pinball, we are going to see Foo Fighters from Stern Pinball, and all of a sudden, Canada's starting to talk positively about this game and about this band, and I just want to say this for the record.

[00:36] I did not grow up a Foo Fighter fan, and when I saw the teaser trailer for this game, I got really excited, cause I think they really made a great teaser for the game and for the band, and I think this is how it's done.

[00:50] Normally Stern Pinball just reveals like the logo of the property at the end of the teaser, but this teaser gave us much much more than a normal Stern teaser, and I'm looking forward, and I mean it when I say it, I'm looking forward to getting into some of this Foo Fighter music.

[01:05] And I don't understand why people get mad at me, not everybody likes every single band, not everybody opens up their musical taste to all artists that are out there.

[01:17] There are so many artists that sell millions of albums that you've never listened to, and you don't know their catalog of work.

[01:25] Like look the Foo Fighters, I know of them, I just don't listen to them all the time. It's like I don't listen to Green Day, I don't listen to Limp Bizkit every single day, and there are so many great musical acts from the 90s, and I think people are just excited that we're finally getting a 90s musical act in Pinball form.

[01:44] I think everybody's very excited that Jack Danger and Zombieetti are going to put their heart and soul into this game, and I'm looking at right now the week of like Foo Fighter activities we're about to see.

[01:56] They're going to drop the set list of what's in the game musically today, and then tomorrow we get the official game trailer, and then the all access Ellie's Go On sale at 11am Central Standard Time, and I'm just going to tell you this right now ladies and gentlemen,

[02:11] please wait and see. Don't buy the game directly from Stern, you're going to spend more money than you probably will have to if you just wait.

[02:21] The big question mark is, is Stern going to raise the price by 500 bucks? Are they going to make a thousand Ellie's? If they make a thousand Ellie's of Foo Fighters, I don't care how beautiful it is, how jam-packed it is.

[02:35] I still don't think it's going to sell out immediately. I think at these prices and that volume of game, there's just going to be more and more people who are going to wait and see.

[02:45] And the other reason why you should probably wait it out just a few weeks is you're going to get to see Galactic Tank Force, and you're going to get to see Jersey Jack number 8 any day now.

[02:55] If I had money burning a hole in my pocket this March, I would probably pull the trigger at the end of the month, and I think if you wait until the end of the month, all of these things will still be available.

[03:05] Okay, so we're going to see that all access sale at 11am Central Standard Time on like tomorrow, and then we're going to see the game features video on March 1st, so that's three days later.

[03:17] So I think that's Friday. You're going to see limited edition photos on Friday as well. Now here's what's weird about this right now.

[03:23] If they're going to sell the LE to us all access on the 28th of February, are we not going to see the LE package on that date?

[03:32] I don't like it when Stern tries to sell us anything before we get to see it. Hello James Bond 60th people right now crying in the corner, because not only did they pay for a game before they saw it streamed,

[03:45] they also had to wait like months before they got to see the game, and this thing is all happening in one week.

[03:51] We're also going to get a live stream of the game on Friday at 6pm Central Standard Time. I mean this is Jack Danger's game.

[03:59] Jack Danger is the king of streaming, and so he's going to get people excited about his game, and it's all going to happen in just one week.

[04:06] We are then going to see, this is kind of weird, we're going to see the pro model shots on Saturday, and then we're going to get a Stern Insider Pinball podcast on Saturday,

[04:16] and then we're going to stream the pro on Saturday, and then we're going to show people the premium model on Sunday.

[04:23] Are you confused by all of this? I'm a little bit confused, because normally when Stern does their videos, they show us all three models in the official game trailer video.

[04:33] So maybe they're doing it a little bit differently this time, and I think some of this might be set up to create some FOMO, right?

[04:40] They're going to try to sell all of these LEs before they show you the other models of the game, and look, as a marketer, I get it.

[04:48] As a pinball fan, I don't like it, because I want to be able to see what's the pro premium NLE before I pull a trigger on the game.

[04:57] It's almost like they don't want LE buyers to know that the pro might be good enough.

[05:01] It's like they don't want LE buyers to know that maybe the premium is fine, and doing it this way is really trying to get people through that LE door.

[05:09] And this leads me to believe that they are going to make a thousand LEs, they are going to charge $13,000 for it, and this will be the greatest example of testing the market on where pinball is at in 2023.

[05:22] Every single pinball game coming out now is really testing the market to see where the ceiling is.

[05:27] None of these games are selling out immediately anymore, they're just not going to do it.

[05:32] And I think that's good, I think for all of us pinball buyers out there, this is better for us, because we can actually wait and see.

[05:38] We can see the game, we can see it streamed before we pull the trigger on making our decision, right?

[05:44] Because now when you're giving a non-refundable deposit, and you're on the hook for a $13,000 game with shipping and taxes people,

[05:51] that's $14,500 for a Foo Fighters LE.

[05:55] And if they make a thousand of them, I'm not sure how rare they're going to be.

[05:59] But I'm also predicting this game is going to be really awesome.

[06:02] I do love the fact that they're going on this narrative and this journey of saving the earth from aliens, and you play as the Foo Fighters in a van.

[06:10] It's very Scooby-Doo-like, it's almost like this is a Scooby-Doo episode featuring the Foo Fighters.

[06:15] And I think Zombie Eddie's art package, it's not just going to be on the game and on the cabinet, on the play field,

[06:20] it's going to be on the damn code of the game, and I think this is going to be one of Stern's best animations to date.

[06:26] And I think other company games coming out this month, they're going to compare those animations to these animations.

[06:32] And I would hate to compete with Zombie Eddie doing comic book style artwork Foo Fighter as animations in a game.

[06:40] I would hate to compete with Zombie Eddie artwork on a play field like this.

[06:44] When I look at Foo Fighters, it reminds me a lot like Rush.

[06:47] You've got these die-hard fans, but the good news for Foo Fighter fans is your game is going to be gorgeous.

[06:53] Rush Pinball is still ugly. It will always be ugly.

[06:57] The artwork on Rush just is not that good.

[07:00] And so I expect this game not only to be very creative from a design standpoint, but I expect the artwork to be phenomenal.

[07:07] Alright, so as I said in my previous show, I think no one expected Stern to come out early.

[07:12] No one expected Stern to control the narrative in freaking March.

[07:16] And all of this money that goes towards Foo Fighters, guess where it's not going to go?

[07:20] It's not going to go towards Jersey Jack number eight, and it's not going to go towards Galactic Tank Force,

[07:25] and it's not going to go towards Scott Denise's new game.

[07:28] So I think this was a brilliant move by Stern. I think nobody saw it coming.

[07:32] Okay, so speaking of Galactic Tank Force, if you've been living under a rock, you haven't seen any of Canada's information I've been sharing with people.

[07:39] They did not want a photo of the game to leak. A photo of the game leaked.

[07:43] A photo was given to Canada. I have the photo with the playfield, with the translate, with those tank tracks.

[07:49] And I just want to say this right now. The reason why I did not share the full playfield image I have is I'm still debating whether or not I want to spoil that part of their launch.

[08:00] And I mean it. I don't feel great when I do stuff like that.

[08:03] But the reason why I shared the tank tracks on the Ellie cabinet of the game, and that's how the Ellie is supposed to come with those tank tracks bolted to the legs of the machine.

[08:13] I think it's a bad idea. I don't think it looks good. I think they should have asked Canadian to come in under NDA and take one look at that thing and tell them,

[08:22] no, this is not what we're doing. You should be carrying over the beautiful, frangy artwork from the translate and put that on the side of the game.

[08:29] And I think these tank tracks like open up all sorts of issues for people who love pinball machines, who want to put pinball machines in their houses,

[08:37] for people who nudge their games and rest their legs near the pinball legs. Like this is not smart.

[08:42] There is no reason why you should be thinking about re-engineering the basics of pinball.

[08:48] And I think they're trying too hard to differentiate this offering. It's an original IP so they don't have to spend as much money on licensing.

[08:56] So they're applying more of this money to stuff like this, but it doesn't look good. And there's no way around it.

[09:01] And I'm not getting trolled by Christopher Franchi. This isn't a made up photo. And if you look at the photo I gave everybody, yes,

[09:08] I photoshopped into the game a play field from WWE from Stern Pinball. That is not the play field.

[09:15] And I'm just making a joke. It is amazing to me how so many people just don't get the joke.

[09:20] And the other reason why I put Napsarcade logos all throughout my photos is I've been giving people news rumors and speculations for the last seven years.

[09:30] And even when I break some news and share something exclusively for the world, there's only one pinball news site that will never give me any credit

[09:39] or even mention my name. And I know he doesn't like me and that's fine. But as the world's best pinball news site, which Napsarcade is,

[09:47] how can you operate and just act like Canadian doesn't even exist, the one guy that gives people scoops more than anybody else?

[09:54] And let's talk about scoops because I think Napsarcade actually put up a story that is hurting pinball more than my scoop

[10:01] because my scoop's trying to get American Pinball to make the right move and remove these hideous looking tank treads from the cabinets.

[10:08] But Napsarcade puts up a story about Jack Winari posing in front of Harry Potter and now everyone thinks Harry Potter is going to be J.J.P. number eight.

[10:18] And I'm here to tell you right now, it is not going to be J.J.P. number eight. Harry Potter is not coming out. It is not coming out this year.

[10:25] And we know that Joe Kamikaw has the relationship with the Harry Potter people and it's not Jack Winari.

[10:31] And for Jack Winari to pose in front of that picture on the eve of Godfather coming out and then Napsarcade puts up this story and all these people think it's true and now think about it.

[10:41] They're all excited thinking it's going to be Harry Potter and what's going to happen when you show them Godfather.

[10:47] You're going to disappoint everybody. Jack, you need to wake up.

[10:51] Like this isn't the time to play jokes or have fun or play games. Your company is in a little bit of a tailspin.

[10:57] You've got no more swagger and excitement right now.

[11:01] Coming off of Toy Story, a game in which anyone who bought your product has lost thousands of dollars on their purchase.

[11:09] A Toy Story game with no toys in it. Jack, you need to do damage control with this next game and you need to launch this next game the right way.

[11:18] And smiling smugly in front of a Harry Potter picture is going to do nothing but hurt your brand and hurt your company and it's going to do nothing but disappoint people when you show them the truth that it's going to be Godfather.

[11:32] And we're going to get this Godfather game in the next three weeks.

[11:35] And doesn't it feel like Jersey Jack is just sleeping at the wheel right now? Like they're doing nothing to get us excited.

[11:42] And I already know that straight down the middle, film their video, they went over there.

[11:46] We know that Christopher franchise on artwork. We know Eric Minier designed the game. And we know it's Godfather.

[11:52] The only thing left now is to show us the game and then everyone's going to ask ourselves. I know we're all asking one question.

[11:58] How many Corleone loops are going to be in this game? I hope it's in there.

[12:02] I hope there's an upper flipper that hits a Corleone loop.

[12:05] Oh man, that Corleone loop just felt so good to hit over and over and over again.

[12:09] And look, I heard this game is going to be fast. I heard it's going to show that Eric can really design great flow.

[12:15] I heard there's one major mech in the game. We shall see.

[12:18] I have low expectations for this game and I'll tell you why because I still think this game was designed while Pat Lawler was calling the shots and Pat Lawler was yanking stuff out of games.

[12:30] He was not about fully featured games.

[12:32] Now here's a prediction I want to make because I still don't think that Steve Richie's game is Elton John.

[12:38] And I think they're using the codename Rocket Man as Steve Richie's game.

[12:44] And here's what I think Steve Richie's game is going to be.

[12:47] And I know they have the license for this movie and it is the original film that everybody loves, everybody grew up with.

[12:55] And even though the second movie is also incredible, if they just make the first film in pinball format, I'm here to tell you right now I would buy one immediately.

[13:05] So I think Steve Richie's Rocket Man game is actually a codename for a guy that gets into an F-16 rocket and saves the day and it is Tom Cruise and it is Maverick.

[13:20] And I think Top Gun is the game that Steve Richie is working on.

[13:25] And I think they know it. I think they're excited about it.

[13:29] And there is no way Steve Richie is going to come out of the gate and give us freaking Elton John.

[13:35] That is not going to be the game that saves Jersey Jack Pinball.

[13:39] And if you think about Top Gun, how awesome would it be like an aircraft carrier, upper play field, and it fires the ball off the aircraft carrier.

[13:48] And then you've got like all the different moments from that film that would be perfect for pinball.

[13:53] And my gosh, if they do make Top Gun, they better get the rights to use the name, image, and likeness of all the characters in it because you cannot make a Top Gun movie.

[14:04] A movie famous for all of its one-liners and jokes and all of the dialogue, you cannot make Top Gun if you're going to just show the movie with muted clips.

[14:16] Jersey Jack, listen to me right now.

[14:18] If you make another game with muted clips, then you need to stop your strategy. It's not working.

[14:24] If you can't afford to get everything you need to make the game right, then don't make it at all. Okay?

[14:30] No more muted clips. We'll see. But man, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, this like March Madness and Pinball in which we're going to get Foo Fighters.

[14:38] We're going to get Godfather. We're going to get Galactic Tank Force. And I want to say this about Galactic Tank Force.

[14:44] When I look at the playfield, it is loaded. It looks awesome. I think there's a lot in this game people are going to like.

[14:51] I do have a lot of questions, though, about whether or not American Pinball waited too long to get this game out.

[14:58] Dropping this original IP game into a crowded space when you've got James Bond, you've got Scooby-Doo, you've got Foo Fighters, you've got Godfather,

[15:08] you've got all of these major licensed properties that everyone is aware of.

[15:14] And then you're going to ask people to spend $10,500 on an original IP space battle with tanks based on a 1950s sci-fi campy theme.

[15:25] And I'm just not sure that that's going to connect with everybody because most of us grown men, we're not really into 1950s campy sci-fi movies.

[15:36] Because you're making a big bank that that kind of theme is going to resonate with people.

[15:41] In their trailer this week, they said they're making a game for the whole family.

[15:45] But man, what family in 2023 is into any of this stuff? It makes no sense.

[15:51] If you want to make a game for the whole family in 2023, Scooby-Doo is better.

[15:56] Freakin' Pokemon. Make Mickey Mouse. Make Super Mario Brothers.

[16:01] I just don't think there's any relevance to your wife or your children with a 1950s space theme.

[16:09] And here's what I'm worried about. I just think like Dennis Norman, David Ficks, I think they're stuck in the 90s.

[16:14] I really do. I think they're stuck with what people wanted in the 1990s.

[16:19] They have the actress from Mortal Kombat 3 in the game.

[16:23] And I'm like, whoa, who cares? Like, how is that even like a thing?

[16:27] When's the last time you even cared about the actors who were in Mortal Kombat games?

[16:32] And I think a lot of this is just them frozen a little bit in the 90s, and they're trying to get people excited in 2023.

[16:40] But they're using like outdated approaches. And I don't know if you've ever been to like a Chiller Theater,

[16:45] but that's it man. I feel like these guys hang out too much in places like Chiller Theater,

[16:49] where it's all about like Elvira, you know, X-Playboy bunnies, and like all these weird campy BC movies.

[16:56] Like that's what happens at a Chiller Theater, like all the horror fanatics. And I get it. I get it.

[17:01] But man, the stuff people still really love is the licensed stuff.

[17:06] So this is one of the biggest gambles of the year.

[17:09] And Pimball, Ken Dennis Norman and Christopher Franchi come together with the game, right?

[17:14] And Christopher Franchi is going to be competing with Christopher Franchi.

[17:18] And I know they never thought this was going to happen time frame-wise,

[17:21] but Godfather and Galactic Tank Force are going to come out like the same week.

[17:25] And I want to give you guys an exclusive here on Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[17:28] I know the release date of Galactic Tank Force.

[17:31] The game is going to be revealed and released this Saturday before Texas Pimball Festival.

[17:38] So I think that's March 17th. Is that Saturday? Oh, no, 18th. March 18th.

[17:43] So you're going to see Galactic Tank Force March 18th.

[17:47] And the way they're releasing the game is they're going to ship this game to operators around the country.

[17:54] So you're probably going to see one in New York, one in Chicago, one in Vegas.

[17:58] So they're going to do another one of these. It's just out in the world.

[18:02] And you can order it today. I don't dislike that strategy.

[18:06] I also just think using the internet is an easier way to get people excited

[18:11] and get people introduced to the product.

[18:13] But they'll probably drop it all at once, right?

[18:15] They'll have the games out on location.

[18:17] And they'll also have videos and HD assets to share.

[18:21] But that is happening in just like a little less than three weeks, everybody.

[18:25] So I'm excited to see the way all of this nets out.

[18:28] I think there are going to be winners and losers.

[18:31] There is no room for six brand new Pimball machines in six weeks.

[18:37] There is no room for all of these companies to have success.

[18:41] And we're talking Foo Fighters. We're talking Godfather.

[18:44] We're talking Scott Denise's game. We're talking Queen Pimball.

[18:48] We're talking Scooby Doo. And we're talking there's one more I'm missing.

[18:51] Galactic Tank Force. Okay. There's too many games.

[18:54] And the big winners are going to be Scooby Doo and Stern Pimball

[18:58] because they got their products to market first.

[19:01] Their games are on the line right now.

[19:04] And I heard from people who went to Joe Newhart's Scooby Doo launch party yesterday.

[19:08] And I heard nothing but great things about the game.

[19:12] So I think for you Scooby Doo owners out there, you're going to feel good

[19:16] because I'm hearing some stuff from some very critical people

[19:19] that this game is a home run. It's a lot of fun.

[19:23] And anyone who gets a Scooby Doo is going to have a good time.

[19:26] And you know if you listen to Canada, you also can have a Scooby Doo.

[19:29] And I think you could get it for less money if you just wait and see.

[19:32] It's a great time to be in Pimball.

[19:34] We've got TPF coming up. We've got all these machines.

[19:37] We've got a new Stern coming out this week from a brand new Stern designer.

[19:42] And this is going to be a fun moment.

[19:44] And I'm going to predict that Mr. Jack Danger is going to have more creativity

[19:49] in this game than we see in games like James Bond.

[19:53] And I'm happy to report that nobody really cares about James Bond anymore.

[19:57] The hype for James Bond is gone.

[19:59] It's been a four to five month debacle launching James Bond.

[20:04] In four to five days, we will know everything we need to know about Foo Fighters.

[20:09] That is how you do it.

[20:11] The only shot at FOMO is if you keep everything condensed in a short window of time

[20:17] and I look forward to seeing Jack Danger's game.

[20:20] And for those of you out there saying I'm a hypocrite, I'm now telling people to buy,

[20:23] I'm still not telling you to just buy it immediately.

[20:26] I wouldn't buy it early access.

[20:29] I would wait to see all three models of the game.

[20:33] There is no way distributors are going to sell out of a thousand of these games anymore at 13.5.

[20:38] Just wait and see.

[20:40] And you're going to be able to play this game on location over the next few weeks

[20:45] and then make up your mind.

[20:47] Now if you're a die hard Foo Fighter fan, of course you're going to buy it.

[20:50] And of course you'll buy an LE without even seeing it.

[20:53] And that's what music pins do.

[20:56] I would buy a Top Gun machine from Jersey Jack without even seeing it.

[21:01] I don't care because I love Top Gun so much.

[21:04] You can't say that about a Galactic Tank Force game or a Scott Denisi Carbon game.

[21:10] There is just no way to replicate the emotional connection we have to some of these themes.

[21:16] And I'm happy to see Foo Fighter fans happy.

[21:19] I am so happy.

[21:20] That is what Pinball is supposed to do.

[21:23] It is supposed to make us happy.

[21:25] Everybody have a great day.

[21:26] We'll talk to you soon.

[21:27] A lot more coverage coming this week as we see more on Foo Fighters later.
