[00:00] Oh, don't you dare look back, just keep your eyes on me, I said you're holding back.

[00:05] She said, shout out, Eddens and me, this woman is my destiny.

[00:11] She said, ooo ooo, shout out, Eddens and me.

[00:16] C'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la, c'est la.

[00:19] Ah, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:23] It's a Thursday.

[00:24] The sun is shining and it is Brenda's birthday.

[00:28] I'm really, really happy to be alive and to have married this Galwegian princess who has decided that I'm good enough for her.

[00:37] And I think many of us out there can relate that the wives are definitely the better haves,

[00:43] and they're the ones that are not collecting pinball machines or spending this much money on now,

[00:49] the most depreciating asset, maybe, in the entire hobbyist world.

[00:54] Alright, so let's talk about what's around the corner, what's about to happen in this Marvel Month, right?

[00:59] It's coming.

[01:00] You know, we've heard the rumors for so many months, we've heard X-Men 97, you know, I blew up that whole thing that it's not gonna be X-Men 97.

[01:08] You're not gonna see X-Men 97 on a translate.

[01:11] I know people are speculating like, well, the show's not really X-Men 97, it's a continuation of a show from back in the 90s,

[01:19] and that's why it's called X-Men 97.

[01:22] But no, the show is called X-Men 97.

[01:24] I don't understand what people are saying, like nobody talks about it like that.

[01:28] It is labeled something.

[01:30] So we know that Stern has built this as the month of Marvel, and we know that something is coming out in August.

[01:36] Now, there's only two more weeks to go, so I can't tell you exactly what it is, but let me just say this,

[01:45] and I know everyone's been guessing.

[01:47] I will give you the best hint anyone's ever given, and here it is.

[01:52] Stern has already made this game.

[01:55] So if you are wondering what it's gonna be, it's not gonna be some Marvel theme we have not seen before.

[02:03] Now look, within the themes they've made in the Marvel Universe, there might be some expanded elements of those themes that we haven't seen yet.

[02:13] So is it gonna be something like that?

[02:15] I can see people guessing about Into the Spider-Verse stuff like that.

[02:20] We've seen the Avengers, right?

[02:22] Is it gonna be some new Avenger game?

[02:24] Is it gonna be another X-Men game?

[02:27] Is it gonna be another Spider-Man game?

[02:30] Is it gonna be another Deadpool game?

[02:32] I see people speculating maybe it's Deadpool and Wolverine.

[02:36] Maybe it's a new version of that game.

[02:38] I will say this, it is not a remake.

[02:40] It is not a vault.

[02:41] It is gonna be an all original new game.

[02:45] Now, if it's based on Marvel, I am gonna tell you right now, I think 100% you're gonna see Jeremy Packer, Zambietti on the art package on this game.

[02:53] And his art style is absolutely phenomenal.

[02:56] I still think Deadpool is the nicest pinball machine he's ever done.

[03:01] I think the second on his repertoire might be Ghostbusters, but I really do think that Deadpool, that whole game, like the cabinet, the playfield artwork, it's just perfectly laid out.

[03:11] And I love that it's just got that big Deadpool smack dab in the middle.

[03:16] So I am really looking forward to a Jack Danger Marvel game with Zambietti on artwork.

[03:24] Look, and I think the reaction to this game is gonna be very interesting because I do hear people be like, you know, they just keep making Marvel.

[03:31] They keep making Marvel games.

[03:33] And the truth is, yeah, they've made a decent amount of Marvel games, but not that many.

[03:39] I would say like 80% of what Stern puts out there is not Marvel.

[03:44] The other thing is this, if you want to make AAA themes that are culturally relevant, that are out there in the world, I mean, Marvel is Marvel, right?

[03:53] It's huge.

[03:54] Like Marvel's been doing much more than DC.

[03:58] I think the Marvel stuff has been much better than the stuff happening in the Star Wars universe.

[04:04] So, you know, it's not surprising that if Stern's gonna pick something, they're gonna pick a Marvel theme.

[04:09] Now, here's the problem.

[04:11] And there is a problem.

[04:12] The problem is simply this.

[04:14] I just think a lot of people have a Marvel Stern game, and they're also really good games.

[04:20] I mean, the original Spider-Man is phenomenal.

[04:23] The old X-Men's not the greatest, but it's also like a really fun game with a lot of toys.

[04:28] If you've played it, it's really fun.

[04:30] There's also like an original Avengers game, which is not the best.

[04:34] It's crazy when you go look at the original Avengers game with like the Hulk smash and all those drop targets.

[04:41] It's really interesting because if you put that next to John Wick, that game looks loaded.

[04:47] So, I really do think if Stern's gonna attract customers to another Marvel theme that they've already done, they're gonna have to load it up.

[04:58] Like, this can't be a game where the artwork is disguising a lack of mechanisms.

[05:03] So, if this game isn't loaded with mechanisms, I'm gonna be disappointed.

[05:07] I think this game needs to come with the Expression Lighting Kit, and you know, I'm really curious to see what Stern's gonna do to make an LE worth $13,000.

[05:18] I mean, that's the big question too.

[05:19] It's like, and I'm curious to see if they make a thousand LEs.

[05:22] And if they're gonna make Marvel again, and they're gonna make LEs,

[05:27] if it is a Marvel game, like maybe, and I think Stern needs to think about this.

[05:33] If they're gonna make a thousand LEs, I think they need to split it.

[05:37] I think they need to have 500 with one art package and 500 with another.

[05:43] That way, you've got a thousand total LEs, but 500 of them are unique to themselves.

[05:50] And I think that would really be an interesting way to go.

[05:53] And look, Zambietti is the artist to do this with.

[05:56] The guy's so prolific, he makes stuff amazing.

[05:58] Like, look at Deadpool.

[05:59] You know, those Deadpool cabinets are amazing.

[06:02] I think they should just start doing it like that.

[06:05] And then the premium and the pro should have the same cabinet.

[06:09] And then the premium should just have the fully loaded playfield like the LE.

[06:14] That's what I would do.

[06:16] If you really want to sell a thousand games at $13,000 a pop,

[06:21] I would make two different art packages for two different LEs.

[06:24] And then each owner feels special.

[06:26] Like they got one of 500.

[06:27] You're not gonna see it.

[06:28] Like it's not everywhere the way the LEs are now.

[06:31] They don't feel special.

[06:32] And I'm sorry, but like if you want a premium, you know, for $10,000,

[06:35] you know, you just make the premium and pro cabinet really nice.

[06:39] Remember the good old days when Christopher Franchi used to make the pro cabinet,

[06:42] the nicest cabinet?

[06:43] Because he was like, well, that's the one you're gonna see on location.

[06:46] And that's the one most people are gonna see.

[06:48] So they get the nicest.

[06:49] I mean, it doesn't make sense.

[06:51] The LE should be the nicest.

[06:52] But you can make a damn nice premium and pro cabinet.

[06:56] You know, but they don't listen to Canada.

[06:57] I had a great conversation with George Gomez.

[06:59] I wish I worked at the marketing department over at Stern.

[07:03] I could walk in there and in just a week, really make impactful changes

[07:08] that all of you would be celebrating.

[07:10] And they would be celebrating because there's a way to make money

[07:13] and also make people happy.

[07:15] And I think what Stern's done is they found a way to make money

[07:18] that makes everybody unhappy except for the newbies.

[07:22] And that is not how you're gonna future proof the business.

[07:25] If you turn off all the people that have been celebrating your brand

[07:29] for the last 10, 15 years, just to attract the new guys who are clueless

[07:34] and they're just excited to have a new version of a game,

[07:37] you're not gonna survive very long.

[07:39] All right, so that's what's gonna happen first in August.

[07:43] And then after that, we're gonna get Metallica.

[07:46] Now, the Metallica rumor has been floating around,

[07:49] but I'm here to confirm for you 100%.

[07:52] It's gonna be Metallica.

[07:53] Now, we've all known this.

[07:55] It's gonna be the first game on Spike 3.

[07:57] That's another thing that's gonna work against this Marvel game

[08:00] is if you know that the new Stern platform is right around the corner,

[08:06] are you gonna go in on the last game on the old platform?

[08:11] It's weird. They did this with Ghostbusters.

[08:14] Weird that Ghostbusters should have been the first LCD game.

[08:17] And now we're gonna get it here.

[08:19] Now, I'm curious with this Spike 3

[08:21] if Stern makes the screen a little bit larger.

[08:24] I don't think they're going to.

[08:25] I think they still wanna have that lineup of games look really good.

[08:30] And if they go to a 27-inch screen like JJP,

[08:33] I just don't see them doing it.

[08:35] I also don't see them doing it

[08:37] because we all know Stern is pretty cheap.

[08:39] I don't think they're gonna really increase their bomb that much.

[08:43] So I think we're gonna see Metallica on Spike 3.

[08:46] Now, this is gonna be a 100% remake of the John Borg game.

[08:52] Now, when I say remake, I say it with an asterisk

[08:56] because it's gonna be the same layout,

[08:58] but I don't think it's gonna be the same art package.

[09:01] I think we're gonna see Zambietti on this game as well.

[09:05] I also think it's gonna have all new lighting.

[09:08] I think it's gonna have new speakers.

[09:10] I think it's gonna have new everything other than the layout.

[09:14] Now, will they add any new toys to the game?

[09:17] They don't need to because Metallica was a game

[09:21] in which they actually put toys into it back in the day.

[09:24] 12 years ago, a Stern machine had more in it than it does today.

[09:30] And now the machine is almost...

[09:31] I mean, this is crazy, people.

[09:33] A Stern only fully loaded with a topper

[09:35] is almost three times the price that Metallica was when it came out.

[09:40] Metallica was like 5,500 bucks.

[09:43] Maybe the LE was 6,500.

[09:45] It's at least double the price of what you get now in an LE.

[09:49] And we know that this game is only gonna come in

[09:51] like premium and LE format, probably just premium.

[09:55] I think they're just gonna call it one thing and that's that.

[09:58] Now, what you don't know,

[10:00] and I told you I was gonna give you a gift on Brenda's birthday,

[10:05] you don't know the name of the game.

[10:07] I'm gonna tell you what the name is right now.

[10:09] It's gonna be called Metallica Remastered.

[10:12] Okay?

[10:13] Remastered.

[10:14] And I kinda like that titling.

[10:16] I like that marketing and that branding from Stern Pinball

[10:20] because now it opens the door for a whole line

[10:24] of the old stuff Remastered.

[10:26] Tron Remastered sounds cool.

[10:28] Lord of the Rings Remastered doesn't sound great.

[10:30] And now that I think about it,

[10:32] maybe Remastered is a term used in the music industry

[10:36] so they probably won't use it for other themes

[10:39] where that doesn't make sense.

[10:41] But Metallica Remastered, John Borg, Spike Three, coming out.

[10:45] Now, here's the thing.

[10:46] Here's the thing.

[10:47] This game is coming out sooner than you think.

[10:50] This Metallica game is coming out sometime

[10:53] in end of September, October.

[10:55] It's gonna be out before expo.

[10:58] So that's another thing when you think about it.

[11:01] Are you gonna rush and go buy this Marvel game in August?

[11:06] When you know in just six weeks to eight weeks,

[11:10] there's gonna be another game that comes out.

[11:13] So you know me.

[11:15] You might as well just wait and see.

[11:17] Because if you wait and see,

[11:19] by then you're also gonna be able to see

[11:21] Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[11:24] There's only gonna be 500 of those.

[11:26] We also know Spooky Pinball has its next game

[11:28] coming out very soon.

[11:30] You know, we're gonna get new games

[11:31] from Jersey Jack Pinball probably before expo.

[11:34] It's been a year since Elton John.

[11:36] And so is it gonna be Margaritaville

[11:38] or is it gonna be Matrix?

[11:39] Now look, I still think there's a 90% chance

[11:42] it's gonna be Matrix.

[11:44] And there's people out there that are like,

[11:45] ''Canada's an idiot.''

[11:46] He said it was gonna be a banger and it's Margaritaville.

[11:49] Of course I don't think Margaritaville is a banger people.

[11:53] Come on, how stupid do you think I am?

[11:55] I'm pretty dumb to do a Pinball podcast for 10 years.

[11:58] But the thing is, I know that Margaritaville

[12:01] and a Jimmy Buffett theme is not a banger.

[12:03] But if there's any guy who I think thinks it's a banger,

[12:06] it's Jack Guinari, the guy that thought Toy Story 4 was good.

[12:11] The guy that thought the Godfather would sell.

[12:14] So it doesn't surprise me, right?

[12:16] All of you, when you hear Margaritaville from Jack Guinari,

[12:19] a lot of you are like, ''I could see it.''

[12:21] I could actually see Jack thinking that's a good theme.

[12:25] Now I think it's Matrix.

[12:26] The problem I hear with Matrix

[12:28] is that Lawrence Fishburne won't give his likeness.

[12:31] How can you make a Matrix game without Morpheus?

[12:33] Like that is essential to this game being done the right way.

[12:39] You know, Brenda's birthday was in 1986

[12:41] and she just read for me like the top movies of 1986.

[12:45] And I kept thinking to myself,

[12:46] man, there's a lot that needs to be done in Pinball.

[12:49] It's like Top Gun, Ferris Bueller's Day Off,

[12:53] like just right there.

[12:54] Those are two themes we need in Pinball.

[12:57] And it was Aliens.

[12:59] We've got that.

[13:00] I would love someone to do Aliens right.

[13:02] I mean it, like Aliens is all right,

[13:04] but I wanna see Aliens done by like,

[13:07] imagine Jersey Jack making Aliens.

[13:09] I wonder how long a license can be held exclusively

[13:13] by a manufacturer.

[13:15] Can Stern even make Toy Story One?

[13:18] Why isn't Jersey Jack just freaking make Toy Story One?

[13:20] Like, hey guys, we made Toy Story Four.

[13:23] Can we now make Toy Story One?

[13:25] That seems like a really smart move.

[13:27] Why doesn't anybody make up?

[13:28] Like how awesome would up be

[13:30] with the balloons attached to the topper?

[13:33] People, there's so many amazing themes we want.

[13:36] Now look, wait and see.

[13:37] Back to the Future's also coming next year.

[13:40] For me, that's the big one, right?

[13:41] Out of all the ones I'm waiting for,

[13:43] I'm not a Die Hard Harry Potter fan.

[13:46] I am a Die Hard Matrix fan.

[13:48] I love that movie.

[13:49] Like if JJP does the Matrix and does it right,

[13:53] I have to own that machine.

[13:56] It's gonna happen.

[13:57] Where I put it, that's another question.

[13:59] But man, Top Gun, Karate Kid, Transformers, Akira,

[14:04] you know me, you know the ones I want.

[14:06] Big trouble in Little China and Fifth Element.

[14:09] There's like this handful of games

[14:11] where if they were made and not made by Homepin

[14:14] and some of the other companies out there

[14:16] that I don't love their product or their platform,

[14:19] I'm not gonna name names because then they get mad at me.

[14:22] You know who they are.

[14:24] I'm just gonna say this.

[14:25] I hope my dream theme is made by Jersey Jack

[14:30] or Stern Pinball or Dutch Pinball.

[14:33] Right now, those are the three companies

[14:35] that I want to make my dream themes

[14:38] because they'll do it right.

[14:40] I think Spooky can get there.

[14:42] You know, they can get there.

[14:43] You know, I would just be nervous right now

[14:45] with Spooky that the mechanisms

[14:47] wouldn't do the theme justice.

[14:49] I hope on their next games, we see more mechanical.

[14:53] Wow, I also think Barrels of Fun

[14:54] is another company that can get there.

[14:56] They haven't wowed me with Labyrinth

[14:58] simply because the theme doesn't speak to me,

[15:01] but I want to see what they do

[15:03] with a theme that really pops.

[15:05] Before I end this show,

[15:07] because I hear Cassie and starting to stir,

[15:09] I want to tell you what's next from CGC.

[15:11] It's gonna be Medieval Madness Remake.

[15:13] 500 of them are coming back

[15:15] and then they're making the Twilight Zone.

[15:17] That is 100% confirmed.

[15:19] I'm not sure why some content creators

[15:22] like Dance Around This just say it.

[15:24] It's the Twilight Zone, all right?

[15:25] We all know it's coming and it's coming from CGC.

[15:28] Nobody's gonna get any money back from Haggis.

[15:31] I think that's what's gonna happen over there.

[15:33] And I think all the momentum

[15:34] is gone from these Pulp Fiction LEDs.

[15:36] Because here's the thing.

[15:37] I also hear that Mark Ritchie is working on Gremlins

[15:41] as his game coming out after Pulp Fiction

[15:44] and after all of these remakes.

[15:46] I don't even know where you slot in

[15:48] the next Mark Ritchie license game

[15:51] when it takes this company forever.

[15:53] It was like if they announced Twilight Zone,

[15:54] we're gonna wait like three years

[15:56] before it actually comes out.

[15:57] I'm so over CGC.

[15:59] I don't really care anymore about them.

[16:00] I think their quality has also slipped.

[16:03] It doesn't seem fun to like be in

[16:05] to Chicago Gaming Company and they've done it to themselves.

[16:09] They've absolutely allowed that brand

[16:12] to be rudderless for so many years.

[16:14] I mean, they're the company I should knock on Doug's door

[16:16] and say, hey, you need a marketing guy.

[16:18] You need a communications guy.

[16:20] How about I help you out?

[16:21] Because I'm still shocked

[16:23] like Mr. Sharp doesn't really talk much.

[16:25] None of them do.

[16:26] There's absolutely no communication over there.

[16:28] I'm not surprised like Butch Peale left

[16:30] because there's just no communication.

[16:31] There's like nothing to do on a daily basis

[16:34] in a company that just goes dark.

[16:36] It's not the way you're supposed to run a pinball company.

[16:39] Everybody have a great day.

[16:41] I love that you're a member of the show.

[16:43] And hey, if you know anybody that wants to be a member

[16:46] who has an Apple product,

[16:48] they should sign up now in like just a week.

[16:51] Patreon is gonna make me charge more than $5

[16:56] for anyone on an Apple device

[16:58] because Apple's gonna take a cut now,

[17:01] those greedy bastards.

[17:02] So just tell your friends, hey, if you canceled Canada

[17:06] or you know someone who wants to join,

[17:08] they should join now.

[17:10] Later, everybody.

[17:11] 700 people can't be wrong.

[17:13] Canada out.

[17:14] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:16] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:18] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:20] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:22] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:24] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:26] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:28] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:30] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:32] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:34] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:36] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:38] I'm not gonna be wrong.

[17:40] I'm not gonna be wrong.
