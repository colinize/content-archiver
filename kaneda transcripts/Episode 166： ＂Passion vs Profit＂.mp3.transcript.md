[00:00] Music

[00:21] And we are back in New York City after the most amazing and magical trip I've

[00:29] Really been on with the most amazing person Brenda we got engaged in New York City about almost two weeks ago

[00:36] We went to celebrate we went to Athens we went to Santorini

[00:41] We just were in London for a few days with her family and the whole thing was just amazing

[00:46] It honestly I am in such a good mood. I'm so excited and optimistic about the life we have in front of us

[00:55] I'm also super excited about the Pimbal world that is in front of all of us and I have a lot of thoughts

[01:02] I obviously when you go away and you sort of

[01:06] You don't think about Pimbal as much you go out into the real world and you realize I don't think like anyone even in Athens

[01:11] It's a crazy even knows what Pimbal is there's probably is not even a single Pimbal machine on the island of Santorini

[01:19] It's nice to sort of unplug, but as some of you know out there I couldn't completely unplug from what was going on in the hobby because of

[01:28] Of the developments we finally got to see Thunderbirds we finally got to see

[01:33] Pirates of the Caribbean we got expo

[01:36] Which just landed on our lap over the past few days

[01:39] So I want to share my thoughts on what I think has happened in the Pimbal world since I've been gone

[01:45] This is episode 166 of Canadian Pimbal podcast and look I think the best way I want to theme this podcast and

[01:53] It's just something we've been talking about for a while

[01:56] It's something that's been on all of our minds for a really long time and that is this whole notion of

[02:02] Passion versus profit

[02:05] Right, and I think what we've seen transpire over the last few days has been a clear indication

[02:12] That there is one major player out there that is driven by profit and there's another that's driven by passion and

[02:20] For all of us who buy Pimbal machines or want to buy Pimbal machines or just want to get excited by new Pimbal machines coming out

[02:29] We would love for each game to possess both to be a game that is a

[02:35] Passion project

[02:36] But also makes money for the company so the company can survive right because you can't have one without the other right?

[02:42] These aren't mutually exclusive things

[02:45] And so we're gonna that's gonna be a common thread as we talk about what happened at expo

[02:52] What what are the results from what happened at expo and where I think the market's gonna go in the near future?

[02:57] Are you guys ready? Okay, I hope you've missed me a little bit just a little bit. So let's just start out with

[03:04] With

[03:05] Jersey Jack Pimbal, okay, because

[03:08] Everything we talk about on this episode is gonna be through the lens of what they just dropped on us with pirates of a Caribbean

[03:14] And I have to say like all of you out there. I was skeptical of the pirate's theme

[03:20] I do think it is a theme when it comes to a film franchise that is a bit a little bit long in the tooth right?

[03:26] It's it's the last movie wasn't reviewed very well the box office numbers weren't that great

[03:32] Five installments five installments. Okay

[03:36] Throw all of that out the window when we saw what Jersey Jack showed us on

[03:42] What was the Thursday night at expo because what he and Eric the designer have accomplished with this game is

[03:49] Nothing short of phenomenal and and and here's why because what what is the point?

[03:54] I've always been making about Pimbal is that Pimbal needs to be a world under glass

[04:00] It needs to feel like when you look down at that game that that theme that world is coming to life in such a magical

[04:10] An amazing way and and the best way the best way to bring that theme the life is with a lot of stuff

[04:18] From that world a lot of toys that interact with the ball a lot of sculptures a lot of

[04:24] You know artwork everything, you know

[04:26] It just becomes this physical three-dimensional world we're looking at that is bringing to life that theme and I

[04:34] I really do I believe that for many many years we have been without a

[04:40] Pimbal machine that really brought that world to life under glass and I think that's why there's just been this overwhelming

[04:48] Sort of disappointment that has been in this hobby for a real long time for for people buying these new inbox games

[04:55] It always has felt like we've had to compromise something okay now that being said

[05:02] What do I love about pirates? I mean I love the fact that pirates is designed by a 28-year-old

[05:09] new designer that

[05:12] Is is an engineer?

[05:14] He's he's an he's a he knows how to build things he is

[05:20] Studied in the art of engineering. I believe it's a mechanical engineer and Jack hired him right before he graduated school

[05:28] Because Jack wanted his young talents

[05:31] Inside JJP. I just love that this is not the same old sort of designer where we're

[05:39] Expecting certain elements and we get those elements and it's so easy to tell who designed it because that person does the same thing over and over and over again

[05:48] I love that about Eric alright. I love that he

[05:53] When he talks about how he designed this game. I love how he just

[05:58] Clearly driven by passion right it's he's watched every movie five times

[06:03] He wrote down all the elements from the films that he really wanted to build into the game

[06:07] And what I love the most about Eric and his approach to Pimbal is when he basically says

[06:13] It all starts with the toys and what the ball interacts with like that is

[06:19] The foundation for making a magical pinball machine the toys the things that will make the ball do stuff that just are like wow

[06:31] Right didn't I feel like I feel like there was a collective sort of like

[06:36] Smile that appeared on everybody's face when we got to see the game and it was just this like

[06:43] This is what pinball should be this is what pinball can be and and and it's happening at a moment

[06:50] That's really interesting because I think it's kind of incredible that Jersey Jack is putting out dialed in and pirates of the Caribbean

[07:00] Those two worlds under glass that are completely amazing at the same time we're getting what we're getting from Stern

[07:06] And we're gonna talk about this juxtaposition because there's no way to avoid it like there's no way to avoid saying I love this

[07:13] Imagine what Star Wars would have been like if J.J.P had done it

[07:17] I can't believe I just spend around $9,000 on Star Wars

[07:21] Ellie when I can get this machine for pretty much the same price and it's laughable

[07:27] It's totally laughable even Beasel Boob the biggest Star Wars of polygist out there is

[07:33] Finally realizing what I've been saying on this podcast and what many of you out there who have who've decided not to go in on Star Wars

[07:41] Ellie you you you have finally realized what I've been saying all this time

[07:46] It's it's that you're not getting your money's worth with Stern

[07:52] You're get your you're simply not

[07:55] Jersey Jack pinball

[07:57] Is delivering the best pinball machines by far right now by far now

[08:03] We will talk about the pricing of these machines now and then they're getting not really really expensive

[08:10] And that means the market for each of these new machines is much much smaller than it was just a few years ago

[08:17] The fact that that a collector's edition from Jersey Jack pinball is pretty much twice the price

[08:25] What people paid for a full featured wizard of Oz when Wizard of Oz was revealed

[08:32] But we all know that at that price Jack was losing money in every game and the company went under

[08:37] Went under pretty much twice and now these are the prices where it needs to be to make the games the way they are

[08:44] And so that's just you know, that's another

[08:47] Issue for a lot of people, but we'll talk a little bit more about that. So anyway, so long story short you guys have all seen the game

[08:53] It's got the world pool. It's got the black pearl

[08:55] You know, it's got two magnets. It's got all the RGB LEDs. It's got starry night

[09:00] It's got this the three spinning discs in the middle that are incredible

[09:06] Incredible anyone who complains about that cool feature

[09:09] It is a tournament player. I love it only my tournament friends were like well people are gonna have a problem with the

[09:15] These are these dis spinning because it randomizes the ball so close to the flippers. Yeah, that's fun

[09:21] It's fun pinball when the ball does random stuff when you're up in the black pearl and it's shaking back and forth like it's on the ocean

[09:28] That's fun. I don't I don't care if you tournament players are upset that there's a random thing going on

[09:34] That's what makes pinball fun the chaos the randomness

[09:37] How cool is that black pearl how freaking cool is it?

[09:41] It has a cannon shot that shoot across the playfield into another ship

[09:46] It rocks back and forth like it's on water. It's the first upper plate field to do that on its own

[09:53] And it's so much cooler when people told me oh, it's like Indiana Jones

[09:56] It's nothing like Indiana Jones the Indiana Jones upper playfield is pretty pissed poor. This thing is incredible

[10:03] Let's talk about the sculpting on these toys how cool does that ship look?

[10:09] My favorite part is the lanterns the little lanterns on the ship that flicker

[10:15] Like they would if they were period correct lanterns on a ship from that error

[10:21] It's that it's that kind of detail

[10:24] It's that kind of passion and love for making pinball and creating a world-rener glass that is just

[10:32] Blows me away it blew me away you literally all you need to do is look at those lanterns on

[10:39] That ship and then go look at the tithe fighter on a spring and you tell me who's driven by passion and who's driven by profit

[10:51] And it couldn't be any more laughable

[10:56] What you guys got with Star Wars

[10:59] Ellie and premium versus this machine. I am so happy

[11:03] I'm so happy for Jersey Jack and and and the family over there and the team over there because it's clear that they did

[11:11] Incredible like things with this machine. They took risk. They put so much into it

[11:16] They let a new designer have his way they invested in him and in return. He gave them back

[11:23] An amazing thing

[11:25] It's like anything like forget pinball for a moment when you believe in someone and you trust them and you allow them to do

[11:33] You know allow their creative mind to run free they come back with amazing things and you know

[11:39] I love about it because Eric is brand new to the hobby

[11:42] He wants to make a name for himself. He's got something that I don't think a lot of these

[11:48] You know old designers that Stern don't have he has hunger

[11:53] All right, he's hungry to make a name for himself

[11:56] He's hungry to do something that hasn't been done before in pinball

[11:59] He's not designing down to a price point. He's not being told by a bunch of bean counters what to take out of the game

[12:07] He clearly is was able to build the machine he wanted to build

[12:12] Look, he might have had to take some stuff out

[12:14] I don't know but what's in there is freaking incredible and I can't say enough about it

[12:20] In fact, I'm going to reveal to the world right now

[12:24] That I have gone in on a pirate to the Caribbean because I'm sick and tired of

[12:32] Staring at broken magic girl. I'm sick and tired of waiting for like stern themes that I love to have completed code

[12:39] I'm sick and tired of all these other dangleberry companies out there

[12:43] They can't get their act together. I want to support a company that makes the best pinball machines

[12:49] Stands behind that product and doesn't have any issues

[12:54] Releasing machines when they're done when they're finished or near finished and then it doesn't take long for them to be finished

[13:01] I think it's absolutely

[13:04] Beyond laughable that a year went by since Batman 66 was revealed to the world and those owners

[13:13] Have just been absolutely abused in such a terrible way by stern with the weight and the fact that code didn't drop

[13:22] Remember I said it's it's got it

[13:23] There's no way stern can show their face at expo and not drop code for Batman 66

[13:28] Well, guess what they did so let's switch gears right now and talk about the other side of the coin the profit-driven company

[13:36] That is stern right now these guys look like they are on the ropes getting pummeled

[13:43] by a better fighter I mean don't they?

[13:47] It's it's in their body language. It's in their expressions. It's in the way they talk

[13:53] It's in the the panel discussion that they did you know the fact that stern got up there and

[14:00] Basically now is claiming that their market is the location market right operator market like beer plus pinball equals money

[14:09] When just a few years ago their whole thing was it's the collector that is driving the

[14:17] Resurgence in pinball and we are going to tailor our games to that collector to the new inbox home use only

[14:25] buyer because we know that that person has a set of needs that are different than an operator

[14:31] Stuff like they want the game to work right stuff like they

[14:37] They they want complete code they don't want play fields to chip they want quality to be there

[14:41] They want there to you know they want to keep their games looking as pristine as possible for as long as possible

[14:48] So stern was going to change the company to tailor to those individuals fast forward a few years later

[14:54] Look how they're changing their tune now look how they're almost like giving up on

[15:00] On even carrying what those collectors want and now it's all about operators on location making games for distributors the pro model

[15:09] Look everyone has been saying it

[15:11] Stern should just make stern pro games make one edition of each game make it a pro between five and six thousand dollars and

[15:19] Just sell those games based upon big themes because they really can't compete

[15:25] anymore in the full featured Ellie marketplace because no one's buying it anymore

[15:30] It's it's it's over it's over and the tipping point was Batman the tipping point was Batman

[15:37] Followed up by Star Wars they

[15:40] Literally you have to step back and think about the context of these machines

[15:45] Batman 66

[15:47] was Stern's

[15:48] Birthday present to itself it was their

[15:52] 30th anniversary game to celebrate

[15:55] 30 years of Stern Pimball and it's been a complete joke

[16:00] Okay, so this is how you celebrate it's like giving someone a gift with nothing inside the box

[16:06] It's got really pretty rapper and a bow and a card right and all that stuff they did

[16:14] Making people jump through hoops of fire to get the super LEDs remember all that and we forgot in what they did

[16:21] You know the chest beating moment that that was I can just see Jodie

[16:25] You know in a room thinking that's a great idea and then what do they do?

[16:28] They screwed over the 30 people who really want it one by adding 50 more and then what happened?

[16:35] 80 people out there and I think we can fairly say it now 80

[16:40] Freaking idiots out there and I get it because I'm an idiot too. I own a match

[16:46] I'm the biggest idiot can we just start there but

[16:49] 80 idiots out there

[16:51] Gabe Stern

[16:52] $15,000

[16:55] Without even seeing anything so more money than brains people

[17:01] We're all victim of that like almost everyone who's in on these expensive games falls into that category

[17:07] I get it. It was your dream theme. You didn't want to miss out on it. You want to have the best version of it now

[17:13] Where are you now? Where are you?

[17:15] You paid 15,000 dollars the Ellie was ten thousand dollars the most expensive machine ever a year

[17:25] 365 days the code is not done

[17:28] It's not even done and now what we're hearing is it's gonna be like point eight two or some I I can't keep up with all these points

[17:36] The only number that matters is number one one point oh the game should have been finished by now

[17:43] So Stern shows up at Expo announces the code's coming in a few weeks and all like the rumors

[17:48] Oh, it's gonna blow people away. Come on. It's gonna blow people away. We always hear this hype

[17:53] It's like Stern just they live off of this like hype that never materializes

[17:59] we all

[18:00] You know, we're all sick of it and and so like there's no code and

[18:05] And like here's what's gonna happen. I don't care what happens with Batman code

[18:11] It's too late the ship has sailed the ship has sailed the ship that is now selling that people want to be on is the black pearl

[18:19] People don't care anymore. I don't care what Lyman does with the code. It's too late people

[18:25] It's too late. He can make it a good game. Will it ever be a 15,000 dollar game?

[18:31] Will it ever be a 10,000 dollar Stern no matter what he does what he can't do is when I look down at that game

[18:39] He can't put better features into the game. Let me ask you a question look at the features in that game

[18:44] Look at look at the look at what you shoot at in Batman

[18:48] What is so amazing about it the fact is they re-skinned

[18:53] Batman the dark night into this game

[18:56] Why would you ever do that if you wanted to make the Adam West Batman world come to life?

[19:02] You would start with a blank piece of paper the reason they did it is because they're profit driven not passion driven

[19:09] You would not if you are passionate about Batman 66 have a damn penguin operating a crane

[19:18] It makes absolutely no sense nobody passionate about that universe would recognize that and then you go look at that

[19:26] Big rotating mech there is nothing about the Batman world that would say that's what you should build

[19:33] How is there no lower play field batcave? I mean it's like like again like imagine if you handed Batman 66 to Eric and said Eric

[19:45] From you know make me a Batman 66 pen. Do you think that's what Jersey Jack would do?

[19:51] Okay, so that's tipping point number one the embarrassment of Batman 66 and the ultimate tipping point that happened recently

[19:59] Was just Star Wars two years in development the biggest theme of all time and stern

[20:07] Fuck it up puts a tie fighter on a spring

[20:11] Steve Richie is out of ideas the whole game is built around this hyperdrive

[20:18] That's not even a real important part of the Star Wars universe all those different planets and all those different

[20:26] Environments and the force using the force grabbing the ball none of it is in the game

[20:31] We've labored this the game is a total failure in my book and the people who come on and try to say oh no

[20:40] Wait just wait you played I've played it many times

[20:44] It's a failure from a theme integration standpoint. It's a failure from what's up on that LCD

[20:49] It's it's a it's a convoluted mess up there. They have no idea how to integrate a game from a movie yet onto a screen

[20:57] They don't have any idea yet

[21:00] It is Star Wars our expectations were through the roof and look how disappointed we are we had super low

[21:08] Expectations for pirates the Caribbean as a theme and look how excited we are and that's where we are today in

[21:16] Pimbal profit versus passion Jersey Jack is just

[21:21] Clobbering stern by making much better games if I were stern I

[21:26] Wouldn't get up there on stage and say you know what we don't want to make wide-body is because of this and that right

[21:33] Profit driven reasons why we're not going to make a wide-body and then two hours later the world sees

[21:40] One of the coolest pinball machines it's ever seen and it's a wide-body

[21:45] I mean every time Stern talks now they just look tone deaf and they look like

[21:51] You know has been they look like a has been and like but here's the thing

[21:57] Because I've been thinking about this for a while

[21:59] You know last 48 hours and when I say wow

[22:02] Stern's not done like don't get me wrong like they have like they still have like 90% of the market like they still

[22:08] You know sell games at a much lower price and they have the ace up the sleeve which they have the best themes

[22:15] You know Stern's not gonna stop with themes. We know Stern's got Deadpool Stern's got

[22:22] You know they've got gardens the galaxy coming all Stern has to do is say we're making jaws

[22:27] Right all Stern has to do is say we're making a new back to the future title

[22:31] So Stern's gonna continue to invest in

[22:35] theme and theme and theme

[22:38] But will they

[22:40] Invest in the quality the game and what sucks is this?

[22:44] I think Stern is going to corner some of the greatest pinball themes ever and we are gonna get games

[22:50] That are not nearly as good as they could have been if Jersey Jack made them and all of a sudden

[22:56] It just feels like history is repeating itself and we have Valley Williams in one corner and

[23:02] Data East and Sega in the other and that nothing is really ever

[23:07] Changed right we're back to where it used to be and I don't have a problem with that

[23:13] I mean, there's just more options for buyers out there

[23:17] So it's a really good time to be in pinball and I know it it's it look it feels like I'm really punched in Stern and kicking them

[23:23] When they're down, but I do believe that

[23:27] Stern bashing right now is

[23:29] Deservedly so and because I have friends out there who have just been burned on Batman friends out there

[23:35] Who just deserved a better Star Wars game and I think they're all starting to realize it now

[23:39] And I you know and I feel bad for the dudes like frolic if you asked me the real guys who just got

[23:45] screwed and really made the dumbest moves

[23:48] It's the guys who collect it like all the new and box terms from like what like circle like

[23:54] 2012 on yeah, there's a few good games in there

[23:58] Right few ones, but man, there's also a lot of stuff that's just never completed never finished and just a half a half-assed effort

[24:07] Like they like literally they fucked up game of thrones and Star Wars

[24:13] Those are two of the greatest themes ever how do you F those up? I just don't get it. I don't get it

[24:21] So where does Stern go from here because this is what's interesting?

[24:24] They they completely like bailed on on expo like nothing was shown that was new

[24:30] But from what I'm hearing is Guardians of the galaxy is going to ship in November December, you know

[24:36] So Stern's gonna have this game ready to go

[24:39] What will the code be is the game done? I don't know what state it's in

[24:44] But I would just wait I would wait, but here's the thing when they can reveal this game

[24:49] And it's not gonna get the reveal it deserve I do feel bad for my friends who have worked on this game

[24:55] I know them they've worked really hard. They tell me the game is awesome, but again, that's all they ever hear

[25:01] I but you know everyone at stern always just says the next game is the best game and you know, I don't know

[25:07] I think compared to pirates

[25:09] It's gonna be really hard for this game to impress people for this game to blow people away for this game to like

[25:15] Like really like be like wow, I have to have it

[25:18] But again pirates of the Caribbean when it comes to theme is nowhere near as popular or

[25:26] In demand as Guardians of the galaxy. I love Guardians of the galaxy way more than I love pirates of the Caribbean

[25:31] Pirates of the Caribbean is a franchise. I haven't thought about in years

[25:35] Guardians of the galaxy is a movie I just saw last summer that I absolutely freaking loved

[25:41] Loved I would much rather have a Guardians of the galaxy game than a pirate to the Caribbean game

[25:47] But there's a much better chance of me wanting to own

[25:51] Pirates versus own guardians unless stern really makes a magical game

[25:56] And I just haven't seen them invest a lot in these games recently because they rely so much on the theme

[26:03] So that's where rat that's where rat. It's it's daddy's

[26:07] Sega versus Valley Williams and you get to decide where you want to spend your money

[26:13] And I think it's a great time to be in pinball. I'm so freaking excited for what is coming out

[26:18] I'm excited to see Guardians. Don't get me wrong guys. I really want to see it

[26:23] I think that our package is gonna be stellar John Borgman's great games

[26:27] Not sure how the code's gonna be. I hope it's done or near done

[26:31] But I'm excited. I'm excited for every new pinball machine. We all are there's nothing there's nothing that comes out that we're not excited to see

[26:40] You know, I was excited to see thunderbirds. Let's talk about that for a little bit

[26:43] Let's change gears a little bit because that happened right before

[26:47] Expo haven't given you my thoughts on thunderbirds. I'm gonna keep it really short

[26:51] Because you know how I feel about Mike over there. You know, I feel about home pin. I think thunderbirds is a joke

[26:58] It's a joke and I think a lot of you guys feel the same way

[27:01] I think it's not the game you wanted it to be I think it shows that

[27:06] They have a lot to learn when it comes to design and I think a lot of the elements of the game are really neat

[27:11] I think a lot of the elements look really cheap and

[27:15] You know, I just don't think people are gonna be buying that game

[27:18] I with what's coming out if you were to put on a list of paper

[27:23] All the new games that are coming out like I would assume that thunderbirds is at that bottom of the list for most people

[27:31] And the problem with being at the bottom of the list right now. It doesn't matter if you're $6,000

[27:35] $5,000 or $8,000 if you're at the bottom of a list

[27:40] There's so many more games to get through before people land and say you know what now

[27:46] It's time to get thunderbirds. So you know, that's the reality and you know making matters worse

[27:51] Is all those shenanigans Mike has been doing in terms of the public image of his company this man needs

[27:59] As many allies and advocates as he can get and yet he's done the complete opposite and is alienating everybody with his BS

[28:09] It's it almost reminds me a little bit like this like spooky

[28:13] spooky

[28:14] Used goodwill to build up a customer base so people would invest in their company and give them a chance

[28:21] Thunderbirds is in the same boat as them and yet they're the biggest

[28:26] Jerks right now in the industry with with their approach and I think I think Mike needs to do a meek Kopa

[28:32] I think he needs to fall in his sword. I think he needs to sort of

[28:37] Ask for forgiveness apologize make the changes he needs to make to that game

[28:41] But in terms of the game itself like my god like who puts a flipper gap that big in a game after reading all the feedback

[28:49] From how much people hated that with ghost busters. It looks even bigger than ghost busters

[28:55] I think the art package is completely weird and uninspiring that big head

[29:01] Drawn on the art from the playfield to the right is strange looking

[29:05] That LED strip on the center ramp just looks really bad like really bad and tacky like we don't know what else to do

[29:14] Like oh this will give it some much needed bling. It looks really sad. I mean like look

[29:19] If you put pirates next to thunderbirds look at what a well thought out design is

[29:26] Versus something that just looks like they threw everything down in a random way and it doesn't really work

[29:33] And then you got these these fake plastic trees on there that look like they're like 50 cents each

[29:39] It's just not gonna work. You know the bar has been raised and it doesn't matter about really price the bar has been raised and

[29:47] You know I really think that the thunderbirds fan base is gonna

[29:53] Pass this one up. I really do. I don't think home pins gonna make it

[29:58] I really don't in terms of making many more pinball machines into the future

[30:02] Good luck. I just good luck with these guys. I don't even want to talk about them

[30:05] I don't want to give them airtime, right?

[30:07] So I'm gonna adopt the same approaches head to head pinball and just say you know what Mike you don't you don't deserve any

[30:12] Promotion from anybody until you change your ways all right, so let's let's talk about a little interesting thing

[30:19] That happened with pirates so right before a couple hours before the

[30:24] The seminar in which Jersey Jack was gonna reveal the fourth game to the world

[30:30] a

[30:31] Pinside member who I also interviewed Neil McCray

[30:35] Niels a good guy. All right. Niels a good guy. He posted a picture of it on pin sight and people were like

[30:42] Given them shit. Neil got the image from Jersey Jack's website. It was put up by mistake early and quickly taken down

[30:50] Look for the people out there who were like that's an asshole thing to do. You're spoiling their reveal

[30:55] You're spoiling their moment yada yada yada. It's not his fault. All right. Let's not all pretend like you know

[31:02] We all live in a world where like

[31:05] If we have information, we're not gonna go tell people almost everybody I know in this hobby is a blabber mouth

[31:12] Almost everybody I know in this hobby tells me things they probably shouldn't and I probably tell people things

[31:18] I probably shouldn't and we all get told things by someone

[31:22] And in which we're instructed to do don't tell anybody but I'm gonna tell you this thing that you're that you're not even supposed to know

[31:30] That's pinball that's pinball like the way people were passing around all those ghost buster leaks

[31:35] What what about that everyone knew about the game? Everyone had the CAD drawing everyone was passing it around and

[31:41] Cares two hours early it didn't it didn't disrupt anything their reveal went off great

[31:49] You know part of me is like I probably would have leaked the image to it's it's I mean

[31:54] I I consider myself a little bit of a media outlet

[31:57] I mean I am if someone gives me something early and I can scoop everybody with something I'm gonna do it

[32:02] It's like when um

[32:04] When I when I knew that it was gonna be Alice Cooper's nightmare castle because multiple people were talking about it

[32:10] Charlie gets all mad at me that I like announced the title before his seminar

[32:15] But here's the thing if you don't want people to know about something then it's your company's responsibility to keep it secret

[32:22] But they don't they don't like the people in the company

[32:27] Talk to their good buddy this or their good buddy that I bet Ed Robertson knows probably the next eight-stern games

[32:33] Now Ed keeps it a secret because he never tells me anything

[32:36] But you know I'm saying there's people out there that are actually good with these secrets

[32:40] You know, I know Jack tells people what what the next game is there might be a game in between

[32:45] This and toy story and Jack has told people what that might be those people won't tell me they keep their secrets

[32:54] But but Jack's telling people and that puts a lot of that

[32:59] In jeopardy and so it's Jack's fault if that leaks. It's not the person's fault

[33:03] All right, let's keep going down or a little like what's been going on in in pinball after expo

[33:10] So I think you I think I've made my points on pirates versus stern

[33:14] You know, I think we're gonna see Guardians real soon

[33:18] We'll see I still expect it to be just another stern. I can't imagine they've they've this is the game where they all decide and put the quality back into it

[33:26] I just can't I just I just believe it when I see it, but I don't believe it's gonna happen

[33:33] Let's talk about pirates pricing for us before I move on because I didn't even get into that

[33:38] So Jack's sticking with the model of the

[33:41] $12,500 or

[33:43] Collectors edition, but Jack listened to me

[33:45] He listened to me and now the collector's edition actually looks different

[33:49] I think that is the big mistake on the collector's edition for dialed in eyes why I bailed on it

[33:55] This game actually has different armor that's much different it has different play field artwork

[34:00] It has different cabinet artwork. It's a fully different art package

[34:06] Congratulations Jack. That is what you need to do the the collector's edition is basically his version of an limited edition and the

[34:13] Ellie is basically a premium and then you know the standard is a pro so that you know when you have three model system

[34:20] The top one is your limited. They're only making 200. I say only I you know

[34:25] Do well I will they will they sell out 200 collectors editions. I don't know

[34:30] I think more people are excited to own this than dialed in if I didn't make a hunch

[34:35] I would say dialed in sales are probably slowing down right now

[34:38] That's why we were shown pirates at expo

[34:43] Jack just needs to keep you know keep the gravy flowing

[34:47] 12,500 for the collector's edition the limited edition

[34:52] I don't know if he announced how many limits there will be I doubt there will be a limited number of limit it

[34:58] It's 9,500 so we're seeing a $500 price increase over dialed in and then the standard is

[35:06] $8,500 so expensive games guys these are expensive games

[35:10] And you know, I know people have been saying this is it fair to compare a stern to this I mean Star Wars

[35:17] Pro is what like 50 400 bucks out the door and so this thing is almost

[35:23] $3,000 more

[35:26] Out the door, you know, it's it's that's a huge huge increase in price

[35:31] But you get so much more so you know

[35:35] This is the Mercedes Benz over here and this is the Honda over here and

[35:41] You know, I think the battle lines have been drawn. I think all this is gonna do it just it really is

[35:46] It's gonna make it so much harder for stern to sell LEDs and sell them out and get people to buy the LED before they even see it

[35:52] I think those days are over

[35:55] Because now people are like shit if I'm really gonna own a game

[35:59] Why not own the best why not just get isn't one Jersey Jack game worth two sturns if you want to have an impressive collection

[36:10] How much more impressive would it be to have

[36:13] Diled in next to pirate to the Caribbean so let's just take those two games

[36:18] Let's say you spend $9,000 each that's $18,000

[36:22] Let's say that's typically the price of like what like three sturns two and a half sturns

[36:28] I'd rather have that then aero smith and Batman 66

[36:34] and

[36:35] You know like

[36:38] Ghostbusters, all right, but here's the thing right and again

[36:42] This is why stern always has a fighting chance because those three themes if I were to ask someone without saying the pinball machine

[36:48] What theme gets you the most excited Ghostbusters Batman and Star Wars?

[36:52] I mean they just thought the themes are just so much better with stern. It's like it's like it's the only fighting chance they got

[36:59] Are those themes so all right so the pricing is higher so look

[37:03] I think what's gonna happen now is this and this is canada's prediction for where this market is going I

[37:10] Think the pinball stall that the black knight and I have talked about for a long time. It's here

[37:16] People are gonna want to sell their old games to get these new games

[37:20] They are gonna want to unload stuff the problem is

[37:24] unloading games for what people think their worth is gonna take forever because news flash everybody your stuff

[37:31] Ain't worth that much anymore

[37:33] It's losing value and it's losing value fast because people are not excited to go on the old machines anymore

[37:42] I'm sorry, but these new machines are so freaking cool by Jersey Jack that they even make wanting to own

[37:50] Valley Williams machines questionable

[37:53] What would you rather pay play right now Indiana Jones or

[37:57] Pirates the Caribbean from Jersey Jack and when I say India I mean the Valley Williams one

[38:02] Now look those games were great in their time

[38:05] But we're in a new time with new designers new toys new max new features new everything

[38:11] These games will be better. They will play better. They will last longer. They will have much better code

[38:18] They will have deeper rule sets. They'll have much better lighting effects and sound and everything about it will be better and

[38:25] Because of that and and I also think because it feels like Jersey Jack will be around for a few years now

[38:32] At least making great games and and so all you know stern and some other boutiques

[38:38] That there's no longer the need to look back

[38:41] I think if someone is really probably gonna get hurt the most I think remakes are gonna start to be sort of silly

[38:50] propositions I as much as I love attack from Mars L.E. all of a sudden man when I saw Pirates

[38:56] I was like who gives this shit about looking back anymore the future in pinball so bright that I just would not look back

[39:03] You may want to grab all titles that they're not gonna remake again, but if I were Chicago gaming I'd be worried I'd be worried that Jack

[39:11] Is gonna be the one that makes selling the old games difficult

[39:16] You know, but again, it's like if Jack just had the theme that would get all these older buyers

[39:22] I think he'd be much better off

[39:24] Because they're not really into pirates. That's the hard part for Jack. It's like it's like oh if you imagine if this was back to the future

[39:31] Or imagine if it was the matrix or imagine if it was something like predator right something that like

[39:37] the like

[39:39] 40 to 60 year old demo like love these guys don't love pirates

[39:44] But they love pinball so they're they have to go in if they want the best pinball machine

[39:50] So like I think that's gonna happen

[39:52] I think people are gonna need to free up room and free up cash and those are gonna be two things

[39:56] They're gonna be hard to do unless you sell your games for less and so what does that do to the market right?

[40:03] It starts to make people think twice because now all of a sudden

[40:07] You know when you buy a new pinball machine or you buy a pinball machine

[40:10] It might lose a lot more value than you expect and this people have been spoiled

[40:16] They've been able to buy a game played for years sell it home

[40:19] You's only only lose a you know a few hundred dollars here and there maybe a thousand dollars at most

[40:24] But what if you lose two thousand dollars?

[40:27] What if you lose three thousand dollars?

[40:29] What's a Star Wars Ellie worth used to somebody right what if the game is just crap?

[40:34] Wait, what if it was never worth like nine thousand dollars?

[40:38] What's a Batman 66 worth if the code's not amazing?

[40:42] What is it worth to people right that you have some limited version of a game? That's not even that great

[40:48] With all these new great games coming out right go. I'm saving my money for toy store him save him my money for this

[40:53] I'm saving my money for that

[40:55] That's the problem is we are at a point now of saturation of

[41:01] Availability of games it is no longer difficult to find new games

[41:06] It's no longer difficult to find old games. It's it's there's so many games that are out there

[41:12] Unless you're chasing after the really rare obscure titles

[41:17] People are gonna be holding on to their money until it's a dream game

[41:21] Now that being said, you know people have said this because it have to be a dream theme to spend like

[41:26] 9,000 dollars and I think it does and I think it does and I think that's gonna be

[41:32] The thing that always keeps Jack from just having like the damn break moment where like

[41:37] Like he just gets inundated with tons of orders is the theme

[41:43] How will pirates do I don't know I think it will do well. I think pirates outsells dialed in for sure

[41:49] I would think this could potentially be his best selling pin

[41:55] I do I do I think was is by far that

[42:00] But Wizard of Oz is timeless. You know, it's hard because that's generations grew up loving that it's one movie

[42:08] It's so familiar it appeals to people of all ages. I'm not sure pirates has the same

[42:15] Generational appeal right so we'll see but it's a much I think pirates looks like a better game than was it looks better

[42:21] Design than was looks like it's to me looks like it's much better layout than was but we'll we'll see we'll see

[42:29] All right

[42:30] Sorry guys, I'm like I know I'm like a ramming a little bit, but it's laid on it

[42:34] I think you just want to hear my voice it's been 10 days

[42:37] No, let me talk about some else other developments

[42:40] Because you know, I think this I think pirates is gonna do a lot to the entire market the other thing

[42:45] I think pirates are gonna do it's gonna make it harder for the other players in the game

[42:51] Something after I saw pirates the excitement I had I basically was like who gives a shit anymore about alien or the big Lebowski

[43:01] You know or these companies that are just like constantly like

[43:05] Faltering and trying for years to you know to do good on their promise to actually make the games people paid for

[43:12] Like who gives a shit about deep root pinball right now and their promise to remake Magic Girl

[43:18] Magic Girl doesn't need to be remade

[43:21] Magic Girl is broken

[43:22] Magic Girl will always be broken

[43:25] Magic Girl was designed in a way that is is

[43:29] Lunacy and it it should be because John's crazy. He's crazy. He can't figure this stuff out

[43:37] I am just like so happy that we have a real company with a real game that's freaking amazing and there won't be any

[43:43] Drama this time around you'll get your game

[43:46] You know

[43:47] Highway pinball wasn't even able to get their pins to coin taker in time to bring them to expo to make some sort of statement that they've arrived

[43:56] I think the games arrived this week, but here's the thing highway pinball is a joke

[44:01] I've been saying it it's still a joke. They've been what what they've been they've been

[44:07] Taking over the company since May and what they've trickled out

[44:10] 21 games are now shipping 21 games since May

[44:19] May

[44:20] June, July

[44:22] August, September, October it's six months

[44:25] We're the averaging like was that like less than four games a month. They've built so far

[44:32] It's a joke. It's a joke and who cares about this game anymore

[44:37] After seeing the new stuff who cares again

[44:43] Looking back on these titles that launched years ago and then had nothing but issues

[44:49] I don't think the buyers are there nobody gives this shit

[44:53] There's like a there's like I've just a handful of people I get people love alien

[44:57] But again looking at alien wouldn't you rather have Jersey Jack Pimball make you an alien pinball machine

[45:05] Versus highway pinball the alien game next to pirates again looks like a laughable joke

[45:13] It just does is I get this is all subjective and I'm just I'm man

[45:19] I'm really bullish on Jersey Jack right now, but look at the two compared to each other and then look at the other game

[45:26] The one that's not the one that I still think is a great game

[45:29] But the guys behind it are a complete joke is Dutch pinball

[45:33] I mean Barry was there and yeah, I don't know Barry was there

[45:37] Yop was there with the new contract manufacturer at expo not sure if you guys caught it

[45:42] But ultimately look the game is now gonna be made in China

[45:47] There's new contract manufacturer

[45:49] But the problem is still this

[45:51] Then the math doesn't work so they now want to sell

[45:57] new

[45:58] Games to people and they want those people to sort of cut the line to get their games first

[46:04] So that way if they can bring in new money those people are pushed ahead of the early achievers

[46:09] So they're like the new achievers or the older achievers, right?

[46:13] So but here's the problem with this whole thing if you just say like wait a minute

[46:19] Why can't you just build the people's games who've already paid for it?

[46:25] Like why isn't there the money to do that?

[46:28] So it just doesn't make sense to me

[46:32] Because they're robbing Peter to pay Paul it's a Ponzi scheme payment plan where new money

[46:38] Will new money will go to turn on the contract manufacturer to build the new machines

[46:44] But still then there's still no money to

[46:48] Build the older people's machines the only way there the right here is the only thing I can think of that would make it work

[46:55] So let's say they make one thousand dollars profit on each machine

[47:00] Okay, that means they need to sell

[47:04] nine machines

[47:06] To make enough money to then pay for the machine of the person who already gave them nine thousand dollars

[47:15] So that's a lot of machines they have to sell to new people

[47:19] To then have the money necessary to build the old people's games in my

[47:25] Calculating that wrong isn't that what they're trying to do is

[47:29] Just get the ball rolling with new dollars, but here's a deal

[47:34] Why would anyone give these guys money after what's happened? I just I can't see it working out

[47:41] Again, I've hit this point a million times. I've said I don't think Dutch and highway make it when I hear these guys talk and I hear their

[47:50] excuses and their approach

[47:53] Why would you ever invest in people like this?

[47:56] Why would you ever give someone like Mike from home pin your money?

[47:59] Why would you ever give deep root pinball your money? I just don't get it all right?

[48:05] I would just like stick a fork and all three of those like attempts because I just don't think

[48:11] All right stick a fork in highway. I stick a fork in home pin. I stick a fork in Dutch and I stick a fork in

[48:18] Deep roots chances of getting games out all right those four forget it if they're around and strong and healthy next year

[48:26] I will I will happily apologize

[48:30] But I doubt it. I doubt it all right. Let's last but not least

[48:35] American pinball

[48:37] They made some changes to Houdini and I have to say you know, I was looking through the thread

[48:43] Really happy with all of the changes they've made to the game

[48:48] I think they listened to feedback. I think they made the game better. They made it brighter. They made it more colorful

[48:55] They added spotlights that are even molded to look like period correct

[49:00] Like like stage lights. I loved how they changed the orientation of the LCD screen to look like a theater now

[49:10] Looks much better like that

[49:13] What else did they change on it? I'm missing a few things here

[49:18] They they changed some of the toys I think where it's just sculpted a little bit differently

[49:24] And you know look who Dini is looking like it could be a fun pin

[49:28] I mean might might only gripe with the pin with the design of it originally when I played it is or there are some

[49:34] Really tight shots on that right side of that play film and go look at some of the openings on the right side there and some of those shots are

[49:42] brick city tight

[49:44] Okay, but I'll say this for the money

[49:48] I think who Dini is a good buy. I think it has like some really cool stuff. It does

[49:54] Haven't played it with the new code

[49:56] I think it's a cool game

[49:58] It it just is gonna have a lot of stiff competition

[50:03] If American pinball can make them and manufacture them quick enough

[50:07] And people start getting them in their home and start being wowed by them

[50:12] You know, I think they're gonna get people to buy it. I really do I mean I I I love the inner art blade decals that are in the game now

[50:20] All those little touches the details they've added have done nothing but make the game look really really good

[50:26] It looks so much better now than it did when they first showed it so I'm happy

[50:31] I think I think who Dini has that world under glass look to it. I really do

[50:37] Yes, I'd love the Matt Andrews art, but I actually like where they've taken this game. I

[50:44] I'm impressed

[50:46] Congratulations guys now they need to get the game out though

[50:50] And that's you know can they get to manufacturing sooner than later because I think for the company like this

[50:56] Marketing it and getting it helped the door at the right time is critical for them

[51:01] Because they you know again as we saw like people are just holding under their money because they want

[51:06] They want something special and I think you know

[51:10] Like again put who Dini just put to me for everyone put who Dini next to Star Wars Ellie

[51:16] Just do it put who Dini next to Batman 66 and

[51:20] Tell me which one is is packed with stuff which one's got like something amazing the ball does

[51:27] You know which one's got more bells and whistles

[51:30] So like again, it's there it's there a inaugural effort. They want to make a statement American pinball is

[51:37] Hungry to put themselves on the map with something. I think we're seeing that again the people with passion and are hungry to make a point

[51:45] They're gonna fucking make the best pinball machines and the old

[51:49] Cromogen guys who need to retire they need to get out of the way

[51:53] They need to bring any young designers and they need to bring in like new thinking

[51:59] I think Jersey Jack has a freaking

[52:02] Killer designer lineup now with with Eric and Pat Lawler sort of bouncing ideas off each other and each making different games

[52:11] I think those two guys are gonna push each other to the limit to make games even better

[52:17] You can't tell me Pat Lawler's not looking at all this excitement and being like man the young kids got it

[52:23] The young kid actually got way more fun there than I did and I'd been working on dialed in for far longer than he was

[52:29] I need to like blow it out the water with toy story because that's what competition does

[52:35] Even healthy competition amongst

[52:37] designers in house and I think you know stern between John Trudeau's arrest and

[52:43] Steve Richie's inability to think creatively

[52:46] You know, I think stern just looks really really really dated all of a sudden

[52:53] What should we call them dated east is should that be the new nickname for stern?

[52:57] They need to wake up this better be a wake up call for stern

[53:02] I've seen companies lose

[53:05] ginormous market share when they get lazy they get toned up and they stop making quality products

[53:14] Stern like they're smug about it and that smugness that they have

[53:20] It's all going to

[53:22] To do nothing other than lose them market share quickly

[53:27] quickly

[53:28] But they have the themes and they have the distributor model

[53:31] We don't even really talk about that much but the stern distributor model really is what gets them most of the sales and what other

[53:38] Companies fail to have

[53:40] They're just in more places, you know, it's like it's like Bud Light we sell 20,000 Bud lights a minute

[53:48] Our distribution is incredible

[53:50] Do we really care about like little craft beers nipping at us? I don't know Jersey Jack is not a little little craft beer

[53:58] So that's it. I'm super exhausted. I'm so tired

[54:05] Bubb is sleeping right next to me right now. Bren has been in bed for an hour

[54:08] I hope I haven't woken her. I'm glad to be back

[54:11] I'm gonna talk to rare here soon. Hopefully tomorrow

[54:14] We'll get that interview up for you guys this week talking to Ben Hack

[54:19] I want to talk about Mike from home pins dealing his system

[54:22] I want to get the full story out and here in his words what went down

[54:27] um

[54:28] And did I miss anything that I miss any games before I go because I'm not at the exact hour yet

[54:35] I didn't talk about total nuclear annihilation

[54:38] It wasn't at expo

[54:40] It was actually it did make it it did make a quick journey to expo

[54:45] Look I've talked about TNA. I've talked to Scott about it. They're almost at the 200 mark

[54:52] I a lot of people are like wow. I'm surprised it is an over 200 by now

[54:55] And I think that just goes to show like the pin-side hype is

[55:00] Always greater than the actual sales of games

[55:04] You have to really really really

[55:06] You know want a TNA to get it but the more people that play it

[55:11] I think though that's what will increase sales like you know because remember like most people having

[55:16] Played in unless they went to a show and

[55:19] You know, it's not a theme that everyone's familiar with so I'm not surprised. It's not flying off the shelves

[55:26] The way a theme to pinball machine would but I love that TNA is out there

[55:31] You know, I love that that option is out there

[55:33] I love the passion again behind that project that is led people the fact that it went from a being a basement passion

[55:40] project

[55:41] To going around to shows to Charlie saying hey kid like let's build your passion project and put it in a production

[55:48] That's cool. That's pinball. That's what I love to see. I would love to see more of it

[55:54] You know, so we're in a great time in pinball

[55:57] We're in a great time if I've been negative

[55:59] It's simply because I've been waiting for more games to deliver that world under glass

[56:03] And I've been really mad at what Stern has been doing to customers and what Stern has been putting out there because

[56:10] Stern's like to me like Stern is like Michael Bay like they're ruining the best themes ever with these like

[56:16] Like half-ass attempts at them like Michael Bay is ruined my childhood

[56:21] They ruined Transformers Ninja Turtles everything he touches. He's ruining. I don't want Stern to ruin the themes

[56:28] I love my I don't want my dream theme to be some compromise

[56:33] cutting corner

[56:35] sort of profit driven

[56:38] Exercise I want my dream themes to be something that looks like

[56:42] Someone's heart and soul went into it and that is pirate to the Caribbean people

[56:47] I think anyone who loves pinball who can just accept the theme should buy one

[56:53] It is the greatest modern pinball reveal I've seen since I've been following this hobby

[56:58] Name me another pin that when we first saw it was like oh my god

[57:02] Wow the other only other one was probably ghost busters because of the art package

[57:07] But that was all zombie Yeti and once we flipped that machine we realized what a hardly designed brutal game it was

[57:15] and people have been

[57:17] But been been glowing about how much fun it is to shoot pirates

[57:21] So hopefully that enthusiasm lasts I can't see anything detracting from it

[57:27] Congratulations again to Eric and to Jersey Jack. I hope to get Eric on the show soon

[57:31] It's fun being back. I'm glad you guys are living in this era of pinball

[57:37] There are so many good options

[57:39] Enjoy it while it lasts because it ain't gonna last forever

[57:43] And we are not gonna live forever

[57:45] So only buy things that you love to play and waiting for code is the dumbest way to enjoy this hobby

[57:54] Absolutely stupid

[57:56] Good night
