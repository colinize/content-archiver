[00:00] Yeah.

[00:01] Hey here records on my demo.

[00:07] Did ya boys not get the memo?

[00:09] I do not stay at the intercontinental.

[00:12] And anything I got is not a reference.

[00:22] We're gonna call this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast, Rumors and Realities.

[00:29] When you do a pinball podcast like this, my goal has always been to bring you the listener,

[00:36] information and news and rumors about what's going on in pinball and to get it to you in

[00:43] a timely fashion.

[00:44] I think that's what separates this podcast from all the other pinball podcasts out there.

[00:50] We don't have normal scheduling, right?

[00:53] This podcast will reflect the activity that is going on in the pinball world.

[00:59] So if there's not much going on, you might get a podcast or two in an interview from

[01:03] Canada.

[01:04] But I'm gonna tell you right now, the reality is that the next couple of weeks will be

[01:11] some of the most talked about a couple of weeks in pinball that will occur all year.

[01:17] And I think a lot of you know what the rumors are and why I am saying that the next two

[01:22] weeks will be some of the most talked about in pinball.

[01:25] And we're gonna jump right into it right now with a rumor that I'm hearing that feels

[01:31] like it is going to become a reality very, very soon.

[01:35] And when we last talked, we talked a lot about highway pinball and Andrew highway's big

[01:41] announcement that he would be sharing with the pinball world any day now.

[01:46] Now I have heard from multiple people that this is what that announcement is going to be.

[01:54] That Andrew highway's company, highway pinball, will be getting new investors.

[02:00] I don't know if they're buyers or investors, but there will be new money coming in to take

[02:05] over the reins of highway pinball.

[02:08] Now what does that mean?

[02:11] That means Andrew is getting what he so desperately needs and that is money.

[02:19] We've said it all along on this podcast.

[02:21] The only reason why production can't ramp up is because there's no money to ramp up production.

[02:29] And that is why we have seen over the past couple of months this sort of terrible scenario

[02:35] where people can't get refunds, where people are not being responded to, where games are

[02:41] not going out, where it's really sketchy about whether Ellie parts were ordered.

[02:47] The whole thing has been real cluster.

[02:50] It has been a real cluster F. Cluster fuck.

[02:52] We'll say, we'll curse on this episode.

[02:55] The whole thing has been painful and stressful for people who have waited years for alien pinball.

[03:02] So this news that investors and buyers are coming on board to take the reins from highway

[03:08] pinball is good news from a business perspective.

[03:13] A lot of people have said Andrew highway needs what Jersey Jack got.

[03:18] And we all remember when Jack was struggling to get the hobbit into production, he really

[03:24] needed a new influx in cash to get the company back on track.

[03:30] Now what does this mean for highway pinball?

[03:32] What does this mean for the future of Andrew highway within the company?

[03:36] Will Andrew highway become sort of still the figurehead of highway pinball?

[03:45] Sort of the way Jack is, what's Jersey Jack?

[03:47] Right when Jack got an investor, Jack no longer owns Jersey Jack pinball fully, but he's

[03:54] still the main figure who is driving Jersey Jack pinball.

[03:59] So I don't know what this means for Andrew highway.

[04:02] I don't know if he will absorb a role that is very similar to Jack's, but that is the

[04:08] word on the street.

[04:10] It's the word I'm hearing from multiple sources.

[04:13] And there's nothing to indicate that I don't think that news is going to come to fruition.

[04:20] What does this mean for your games?

[04:22] That is the big other part of the puzzle.

[04:25] How long will this take for production to ramp up if this is true?

[04:31] I don't think it will be an immediate fix.

[04:34] I don't think you can walk into a pinball company that's had the kinds of struggles and

[04:40] the kinds of problems getting to production the way Andrew has and just throw money at

[04:46] it and have an immediate fix.

[04:49] What will happen though is there will be money to order parts.

[04:54] There will be money to actually go physically get the things that Andrew needs to make

[05:00] alien pinball.

[05:01] Now here's a thing that I'm curious about.

[05:07] Do these investors know the whole story?

[05:09] Do they know what they're walking into?

[05:12] And we've seen this happen before with pinball.

[05:14] I think if there's one thing you need to become an investor in pinball, you need a lot

[05:20] of patience because I don't think you can turn a pinball company that is struggling financially,

[05:28] struggling from a manufacturing standpoint.

[05:31] I don't think you can turn that ship around fairly quickly.

[05:36] I think this is going to take a while for them to look at the situation, to look at what's

[05:42] needed to make alien pinball a game that's ready for mass production.

[05:47] Because remember this isn't a boutique company.

[05:50] Andrew never established highway pinball to only make 200 games here, 300 games here.

[05:57] This whole operation was designed to compete with Stern at a mass production level, which

[06:03] means a thousand aliens, two thousand alien machines, to get to that point.

[06:11] They're going to need to make sure that this game is ready for that kind of production,

[06:15] that this game is ready to order a thousand parts.

[06:20] And right now, I think we all can honestly say by what we've seen from reports of people

[06:27] who have these beta games, is that they're not there yet, that tweaks need to happen to

[06:33] the game.

[06:34] And I'm hearing that the first step that these investors are taking is going to be to fix

[06:39] all the issues with the game before they get into production.

[06:44] Now the other part that I'm really curious about is do these investors know the full story

[06:50] around the refund request and really just what they're walking into, the climate of what

[06:56] they're walking into.

[06:59] I tend to believe that Andrew's a salesman and Andrew has a way of spinning things to

[07:04] get people on board.

[07:05] He's done it with the community for a few years now.

[07:10] But this is a deal between them and him and I don't know any of the details of the deal.

[07:16] So I'm not going to speculate on those details.

[07:19] But I think you're hearing and hearing first on Canadian's pinball podcast that Andrew has

[07:24] some sort of financial help.

[07:27] His role in the company is uncertain.

[07:30] That will probably arrive when they announce this deal.

[07:33] Now I don't see this as like exciting news and I'll explain why.

[07:38] It's the right move.

[07:39] That's what he needed.

[07:42] But getting to this point, getting to this point where you need sort of like a bailout,

[07:47] it's not really exciting.

[07:49] It is the final efforts to keep this whole company from collapsing.

[07:55] And if highway pinball collapses, that would be a calamity for the pinball hobby.

[08:01] It would be a horrible thing.

[08:03] It would have been a horrible thing if Jersey Jack pinball went under during Hobbit production.

[08:09] Because these companies have really, you know, they've captured the imagination of pinball

[08:17] hobbyists.

[08:18] They've taken the money of so many individuals.

[08:22] And if they were to go under, the money would evaporate.

[08:27] The people who lost money, their enthusiasm, their enthusiasm for the hobby would evaporate.

[08:34] They would probably leave the hobby.

[08:37] And not only that.

[08:38] I thought a lot about this.

[08:39] What sucks so much about people who got burned by predator.

[08:44] What would suck so much if people got burned by alien?

[08:48] It's not just the money they would lose on the machine.

[08:53] It's that they would lose their love affair a little bit with the theme of alien that they

[08:57] love so much.

[08:58] And that's, I was thinking about that.

[09:00] And that's almost like more painful than just losing your six to eight thousand dollars.

[09:06] These guys, these guys who have stuck with Andrew all these months and all these years,

[09:11] they are die hard alien fans.

[09:14] And for them to lose out on this game, it would mean that every time they thought of alien

[09:20] and that property that they love, if there would be a dark cloud over it, they would feel

[09:25] bad about it.

[09:26] They would not be that excited about it.

[09:28] And that would suck.

[09:30] And that would really suck.

[09:32] So I don't know when you're going to get your game.

[09:36] I do know that having new people in charge of this company that is proven and I've said

[09:41] it on this show, they've proven, they can't meet deadlines, they don't know how to manufacture

[09:46] pinball and mass production.

[09:49] Do the people coming on board know how to do it?

[09:51] I sure hope so.

[09:53] Because if we've learned one lesson over the last few years in this entire hobby, it's

[09:59] that making pinball is hard.

[10:01] And most people don't really understand that.

[10:05] That showing a prototype here and there, that's not what it takes to actually get a game

[10:11] on a production line.

[10:13] That is where the real challenge lies and that is where most companies continue to stumble

[10:19] and to fail.

[10:21] Now the other part of this, so rumors and reality.

[10:23] So that's like sort of the rumor, which I think is going to be a reality.

[10:27] The other reality is this.

[10:30] We're on the eve of Star Wars.

[10:32] Over the next couple of weeks, I think it's all been confirmed that Star Wars is going

[10:38] to be announced.

[10:39] And I can't think of a worst time for highway pinball to be announcing this restructuring

[10:46] while at the same time, Stern is dropping an atom bomb theme out into the world and

[10:54] showing people their juggernaut title.

[10:58] You really couldn't get worlds apart of one company that consistently delivers stellar

[11:05] theme pinball machines with great coding and games that are available, a company that

[11:12] does have the best customer service, even though some people try to deny that on pin

[11:17] slide, which is absolutely ludicrous.

[11:19] A company that picks up the phone when you call.

[11:22] A company that has a customer service division.

[11:27] So as Stern's about to show the world Star Wars, highway pinball is asking you for more

[11:33] patience to hang in there, to stick with it.

[11:38] And I think you're going to come upon this unlikely and unique scenario where people are

[11:46] going to see what their money can go get within a few weeks with Star Wars, or they can

[11:51] decide to stick it out and not ask for refunds.

[11:56] Now I think it's only going to be natural that certain people are going to ask for refunds

[12:03] from highway pinball to go buy Star Wars.

[12:06] Like that is going to happen.

[12:09] I hope these investors are okay with that.

[12:12] I hope Andrew has been honest with them about the realities of what's going on in the pinball

[12:17] world, that these people could wake up in as little as a few days and see a bunch of emails

[12:23] from buyers asking for refunds.

[12:26] I do think highway will probably start communicating in a manner that is somewhat begging or encouraging

[12:34] people not to bail.

[12:38] Because I think a lot of money is going to want to go to Star Wars.

[12:42] And as we start to learn more about Star Wars and what's going on with this game, you

[12:48] know, I'll say this, from a rumor standpoint, and I know some stuff I cannot share on this

[12:54] podcast.

[12:55] It's like one of these dilemmas.

[12:57] I know some things about this game.

[12:59] I've heard it through the grapevine and certain people.

[13:03] All I'm going to say is this.

[13:05] Star Wars sounds like an epic game.

[13:09] And it sounds like Stern went all in with some amazing toys and features and elements

[13:16] of this game that I think are going to make every single Star Wars person super happy.

[13:22] I don't know anyone who's not really a Star Wars person.

[13:25] I really don't.

[13:26] There's a few of you out there, but I don't get what's wrong with you people.

[13:29] And I think that, you know, as people start to see this game, you're going to really

[13:34] have a hard time putting your money elsewhere.

[13:37] And that leads me to my next sort of like rumors and realities.

[13:41] So a reality for Jersey Jack Pimball, as we again are on the eve of dialed in about

[13:49] the ship.

[13:50] I think it's shipping any day now.

[13:53] The reality is Star Wars hurts Jersey Jack's ability to create that kind of launch hype

[14:03] for dialed in.

[14:05] And I mean, it's almost crazy, right?

[14:08] It's almost crazy to have Star Wars and dialed in and almost being revealed or not revealed.

[14:17] That's the wrong word.

[14:19] To have dialed in in Star Wars, sort of battling it out for hype and excitement in the same

[14:25] few weeks is crazy when you think about it, right?

[14:29] Pimball companies, all they do is miss deadlines.

[14:32] They stall.

[14:34] Things never happen when planned.

[14:36] The fact that both of these titles are colliding at the same time.

[14:40] And more of that is because Star Wars was the delay, not really dialed in.

[14:45] Star Wars is the one that we all knew was supposed to come out earlier and in May and align

[14:51] with more of the Star Wars fandom dates like May 4th or the 40th anniversary date last

[14:56] week.

[14:57] But the reality is it got delayed and Stern's had some delays.

[15:02] Now the fact that it's landing right on top of the moment where Jack wants people to see

[15:08] dialed in going out and to get word of mouth as big as he can get it, he's got Star Wars.

[15:19] Star Wars is like this game.

[15:22] It really is like this game to me that metaphorically feels like this death star hovering over

[15:28] highway Pimball, this death star hovering over Jersey Jack Pimball, this death star, maybe

[15:34] even hovering over spooky Pimball.

[15:37] And it's about to fire.

[15:39] It's green, tractor beam and laser and destroy the competition.

[15:46] And I've said it before and we've said it on this podcast many times.

[15:51] There is not room for all of these Pimball manufacturers to overlap too close to each

[15:59] other.

[16:00] There just isn't.

[16:01] There's not enough money in the hobby to ask people to buy two, three games within

[16:10] a one or two month period.

[16:12] Games need a shelf life to breathe.

[16:15] They need moments where people can actually buy one, played for a few months, decide if

[16:20] they want to keep it, decide if they want to get something new.

[16:23] Stern almost positions its launches as if there's no other competition.

[16:28] The reason why is because there usually is no other competition.

[16:33] But now there is the competition trying hard, desperately hard to get sales at the same

[16:43] exact time that Star Wars is launching.

[16:45] Now I think this is going to be a really interesting couple of weeks to see how this whole

[16:50] thing shakes out.

[16:51] As I've said before, I don't think everyone's going to come out of this a winner.

[16:56] I really don't think there's room for everybody.

[16:58] I don't think the world needs four or five Pimball machines all at once.

[17:03] I mean, let's just count the number of games that are going to be available over the next

[17:09] two weeks to order.

[17:11] Star Wars, alien.

[17:13] Right, alien if CoinTaker puts it back on its site.

[17:16] You see that?

[17:17] They removed it for sale on their site.

[17:19] What does that tell you?

[17:21] Star Wars, alien, Erasmith, Batman, Ghostbusters, ACDC, dialed in.

[17:30] You can go get Rob Zombie Newinbox from PimballStar.

[17:34] You can go get dialed in, I'm going to put P3.

[17:39] I'm just going to put all the titles that are currently like, should be available.

[17:44] Right there guys, I'm at nine titles.

[17:47] Nine.

[17:48] Let's still think there are some more sturns I'm forgetting that are available.

[17:52] That is ridiculous.

[17:53] That is ridiculous.

[17:54] That's more titles than are available for Nintendo Switch.

[17:59] Here we are in this moment where all these games are entering this vortex asking for your

[18:07] money and it's, where's your money going to go?

[18:10] Where's your money going to go?

[18:12] How can you say that quantum city is going to be where people's money go versus like

[18:21] Dagobah or Tatooine or the Death Star?

[18:25] Right?

[18:26] You got Bob versus Luke Skywalker.

[18:30] Okay.

[18:31] I think when people see Star Wars, I think they're going to look over at the alien play field

[18:35] and realize what I've been saying for a long time.

[18:38] I think the alien light show is great.

[18:41] I think the music is great, but I think Alien Pinball is one of the most barren playfields

[18:46] I've ever seen.

[18:48] Tell me what the ball interacts with that's magical or awesome.

[18:52] I really don't see it.

[18:54] There's like, there's nothing in the bash.

[18:56] There's like, you don't even hit the alien head and there's nothing else that's really

[19:02] reflective of the alien universe that is on that play field.

[19:07] I think the game relies far too much on LCD screens that take up so much of the real estate.

[19:13] I don't think the game should ever have been a wide body.

[19:16] There's absolutely nothing about alien being a wide body that looks like it utilizes a

[19:22] wide body or even needed to be a wide body.

[19:26] So I think that is again, again, because not many people have alien and not many people

[19:31] are comparing it to anything.

[19:33] I think when you have alien next to Star Wars, there's going to be a lot more of that

[19:37] comparison of just looking at both and saying, which one do I want?

[19:42] Now the big Achilles heel in Star Wars and the rumor that's just going around is that

[19:47] the art's not going to be that spectacular.

[19:50] That once again, we're not going to get a game that was drawn from the ground up.

[19:56] We're going to get more of that Batman 66 style where Stern is going to use other artist's

[20:02] hand drawn artwork and put it down.

[20:05] That's not what people want, but I also think it's not the end of the world if we get

[20:12] a nice arrangement of hand drawn Star Wars art because I think the Star Wars theme is so

[20:17] powerful that it doesn't need.

[20:21] Star Wars doesn't need like a zombie Yeti to make the game hand drawn.

[20:26] Star Wars is not about like all that, like tons of details like what you'd want from

[20:31] a dirty donny in an aerospace myth.

[20:34] I do think Star Wars, if what I'm hearing is correct, I think it's going to excite people

[20:41] a lot like Lord of the Rings did where you could argue Lord of the Rings art is not the

[20:46] best, but I think Star Wars is going to immerse people in the Star Wars universe so well

[20:54] that it's just going to be so much fun to play.

[20:57] All right, so again, that's rumors.

[20:58] I haven't played it.

[20:59] I haven't talked to anyone who's played it.

[21:02] So I don't know, but I do know that we're really close.

[21:07] And I had to say this, I was reading another email or looking at another thread about

[21:11] P3 and Jerry and how they're still struggling to get production off the ground.

[21:18] And here we are almost in June and games are not going out.

[21:23] And again, P3's ability to survive, to generate hype in this climate.

[21:30] What do you think?

[21:31] I mean, it couldn't be a worse time to release P3 Lexi light speed against Star Wars.

[21:39] And I know and I respect Jerry and I don't think you can.

[21:45] He would say it's not Lexi light speed versus Star Wars.

[21:48] It's a platform.

[21:49] It's a new platform versus an old platform.

[21:53] And I get that and you could look at it that way, but consumers won't look at it that way.

[21:58] They will look at it as a pinball experience versus a pinball experience.

[22:03] And which one do I would rather have?

[22:05] Which one emotionally pulls me in?

[22:07] The experience I can have on your platform right now is Lexi light speed.

[22:11] The experience I can have on Stern's platform right now is Star Wars.

[22:16] That's all people are going to do.

[22:18] You know, this whole notion that pinball people will buy a platform thinking about what

[22:23] titles could come down the road is absolutely silly in today's environment because people

[22:30] are really thinking about today.

[22:32] There's so much available today.

[22:35] So much so I have to say for the first time ever, I really think I'm going to sell my

[22:39] tails of the Arabian Knights.

[22:41] And the reason why, even though I love it, even though my machine is beautiful and it's

[22:44] restored, these new games are so exciting and they're bringing so much to the table that

[22:50] I feel like old pinball is starting to feel really old.

[22:54] And I feel when I look at dialed in, I feel like that game makes every other pat-law or

[22:58] game look really old, feel really old.

[23:03] And I would rather have the new game.

[23:06] I would rather have the new stuff.

[23:09] I mean, put dialed in next to Twilight Zone and don't tell me Twilight Zone doesn't

[23:13] feel really dated all of the sudden.

[23:15] Don't tell me that Adam's family doesn't feel really dated or the fun house doesn't feel

[23:22] really dated.

[23:24] Roadshow, all of these games, these things feel really dated next to dialed in.

[23:30] I'm still rooting for dialed in.

[23:33] And I'll say why?

[23:34] Because it's an original theme.

[23:35] I still think when you put all the games next to each other, I think when you put Star Wars

[23:40] dialed in, Alien, Big Lebowski, do we even talk about Big Lebowski?

[23:45] We'll get there in a second.

[23:46] When you put all these games next to each other, I still think dialed in is going to be the

[23:50] best quality machine.

[23:52] The best quality machine.

[23:54] It's just going to have such an uphill battle taking down the juggernaut theme that is

[23:59] Star Wars.

[24:00] But I think the quality is going to be there.

[24:02] And I think the game is going to fight it out in terms of Richie's, will this be Richie's

[24:09] finest, will this be Pat Lawler's finest?

[24:11] We're going to see.

[24:13] The exciting thing is, within two weeks, we'll be able to see both games side by side and

[24:18] make up our own minds.

[24:19] And I'm sure when Star Wars is revealed, Stern will have a dead flip, you know, and

[24:25] something else where they let someone twitch stream how it plays.

[24:29] You know, but again, how do you compete against pressing the start button and the John Williams

[24:34] theme song to Star Wars welcomes you to the game?

[24:38] I don't understand how you compete with that.

[24:42] You can't compete with that with the alien theme song.

[24:45] You can't compete with that with the dialed in music.

[24:48] So there's like just never been a modern John Williams score, pinball machine ever.

[24:57] We have the Indian and Jones game and that music was shit.

[25:00] You know, it just sounded like crap compared to like what is possible with the new technology.

[25:05] So we, you know, as we talk again about this theme of the rumor versus the reality.

[25:11] So the rumor that I'm hearing too with Dutch pinball, the rumor is this that they haven't

[25:16] worked it out yet with ARA and that it's going to take a long time.

[25:21] So that's all I'm hearing is that this is not going to be a quick fix.

[25:25] And again, in this climate, patience, how long are you going to wait to get your big

[25:31] Lebowski?

[25:32] By the time you get your big Lebowski, who's going to care?

[25:36] Who's going to care?

[25:38] I mean, I know it's probably a great game, but I think there's just, there's just going

[25:43] to be an exodus from all these companies that have done nothing but make it painful for

[25:51] all those people that pre-ordered the game.

[25:53] And by the way, if you go into the alien thread, read, read Hilton and Ysnow's, read his

[26:01] explanation of how he doesn't pre-order even though he put money down early on alien.

[26:07] And someone's like, dude, that is what a pre-order is.

[26:10] When you put money down before the games are made, you're pre-ordering it.

[26:16] I love this Bill Clinton sort of like, it depends on what your definition of is is.

[26:21] Like that's sort of like, he's still shilling to the very end.

[26:24] Hilton will shill to the very end.

[26:26] I wonder if he'll finally admit now that Andrew's not a great businessman.

[26:30] I wonder if he'll finally just utter those words.

[26:34] This is not normal.

[26:36] This whole hobby, I really feel, and I say this from the bottom of my heart because I

[26:42] really care about your money and I care about your ability to enjoy this hobby.

[26:49] I'm going to say this.

[26:51] I really think this industry is headed for an extreme consolidation and it's going to

[26:57] happen.

[26:58] And just because Andrew gets some investors doesn't mean he's going to survive.

[27:02] He doesn't need to just sell a couple hundred aliens or make the couple hundred that he

[27:06] already sold.

[27:07] He needs to make probably a couple thousand to stay in business.

[27:11] And by Andrew saying, we're not even thinking about developing game number two, we're focusing

[27:17] primarily on alien.

[27:19] I'll tell you, that admission by him is pretty much a game over for his company if you ask

[27:25] me.

[27:26] I'll tell you why.

[27:27] Now he's just stuck making one title.

[27:30] So he needs that one title to survive for a really long time to keep his company afloat.

[27:37] And meanwhile, Stern will throw at you stuff.

[27:39] We're hearing rumors like Guardians of the Galaxy, rumors like Deadpool, rumors like Pulp

[27:45] Fiction, rumors like, okay, so Stern's going to have all these titles constantly rolling

[27:49] out and you're stuck with one title.

[27:52] We know Jack has got his act together and we'll most likely showcase another title at

[27:57] Expo.

[27:58] I'm not sure, but if his promise of increased cadence comes true, I expect to see that,

[28:06] but there's just no way Highway Pimball can survive only on alien.

[28:10] There's just no way.

[28:12] You can't run a major pinball company and only have one game on the line forever.

[28:18] If Andrew wanted to make a boutique pinball company, more along the lines of Dutch, then

[28:23] that business model might be viable, but that's not what he built his company for.

[28:28] Okay, so and also for all you guys out there who really were expecting this swappable play

[28:34] field model that he promised you, would you finally admit that that promise is never going

[28:41] to happen?

[28:42] You're never going to get this company that's going to release three to four games a year

[28:47] that you're going to be swapping things in and out of your highway cabinet.

[28:51] So his whole dream, his whole vision will never really come true.

[28:58] And I think the guys who are waiting for alien kids who bought full throttles are going

[29:02] to be waiting a really long time if they ever even get a kit offered to them.

[29:08] I think if Andrew were smart, he'd absolutely remove the fiber optic cables and he'd simplify

[29:15] the LED package so he can actually get production going on it.

[29:19] But Dutch pinball, Dutch pinball is going to move really slow.

[29:23] And so I just don't want to see pinball the next six months of pinball shaking up into

[29:32] two camps.

[29:34] One camp of people who just go by what's available, go by Star Wars premium or an LED when it's

[29:40] available, go by Alice Cooper when it's available, go by Rob Zombie when it's in a box, go

[29:48] by Dial Dyn when a distributor will ship it to you that week.

[29:51] That's what you should do.

[29:53] And then you're going to have those people who do that and they're going to love pinball

[29:56] and they're going to enjoy all the things that they're playing and they're going to have

[30:00] so many great options.

[30:01] And on the other side, you're going to have all these people who still have their money

[30:06] locked in to these companies who can't figure their shit out.

[30:10] And those people, I'm telling you, they're going to turn bitter, they're going to turn

[30:15] defensive if they're not already there.

[30:18] And they're going to just keep saying that people should stick it out, they should wait

[30:22] it out.

[30:24] And you know, for those people, it's more about a pride issue than a pinball issue.

[30:28] You know, a lot of them like, they just won't leave because they've been in it so long.

[30:34] It's the same reason why, you know, Zidware buyers, when they finally got their magic girls

[30:39] and they couldn't even enjoy it.

[30:41] They just been beaten down so much by the time it arrived.

[30:44] I mean, given the game that arrived like it did, but it doesn't matter, right?

[30:48] So it's like, there's so many months and years of negative emotions attached to these

[30:53] companies that I don't know if those people are ever going to be satisfied with what they

[30:57] finally get because I still think right now, games like Alien, they're getting a pass,

[31:05] they're getting a pass.

[31:06] People aren't like authentically reviewing it because people are nervous that Andrew

[31:11] won't send them a game if they share how they really feel.

[31:15] And there's just a lot I've never seen.

[31:16] I've never seen more leeway and rope given to a single manufacturer than has been given

[31:22] to Andrew highway.

[31:23] And it looks like he's gotten some more rope that he's going to be announcing soon.

[31:28] So I want to close on this note.

[31:30] I want to close by saying, I think by this time next year, you are going to see half

[31:35] as many pinball manufacturers in business.

[31:38] It's not because I want pinball companies to fail, but it's because I think so many pinball

[31:43] manufacturers out there don't understand marketing.

[31:47] I think they've all failed to understand how they can enter the pinball category and be successful.

[31:55] I think most pinball companies go about it all wrong.

[31:59] I think they're unsure of what themes they should create that will create demand.

[32:06] I think most new pinball companies have absolutely no idea how to manufacture.

[32:11] I think the one pinball company that showed all of the new guys how to do it, spooky pinball

[32:18] has been ignored by all the other new startups.

[32:22] And I'll explain why.

[32:24] But spooky pinball has done, which is the one singular thing you need to do to guarantee

[32:32] you will give yourself a chance to succeed is you fully develop a game.

[32:37] You fully develop it and you don't show it until it's finished and you don't price it

[32:43] until you understand the total cost of a fully developed game.

[32:50] We haven't seen anyone else do that.

[32:53] They didn't do it.

[32:55] They developed like a beta, but they reengineered the whole thing and they'd already set the price.

[33:02] We definitely didn't see that with Alien.

[33:07] I mean, Andrews had the price for Alien down now for two years and you can't tell me now

[33:13] the actual cost to make each one of those machines must have increased by a few thousand

[33:19] dollars just based on the R&D time and based on the material cost.

[33:24] But now we can't change the price.

[33:27] We didn't see that with Houdini.

[33:29] They haven't fully finished developing Houdini and they've already set the price arbitrarily.

[33:35] They don't even know how many they're going to make.

[33:38] All these companies fail because they don't do the market research.

[33:44] I'm not just saying that because I work in marketing.

[33:47] The other thing that I think is this absolutely boggles my mind as a marketer.

[33:51] There's one company making millions and that's Stern Pimble.

[33:56] They're making money.

[33:58] They know how to do it.

[34:00] And why is it that every other company that tries to compete with Stern, they try to change

[34:06] so much of the game to compete with Stern, but all those changes and all those innovations,

[34:12] all it does is it makes it that much harder for that company to just get it.

[34:16] Get a game out and all they need to do and spooky has proven this.

[34:20] It's just get a game out.

[34:22] Get a game out.

[34:23] Andrew, you don't have to reinvent the back box.

[34:26] Re-invent the play field.

[34:27] Re-invent this.

[34:28] Re-invent that.

[34:29] Re-invent all these things that keeps you from getting a game out.

[34:33] I mean, spooky has put out two games that are both below a Stern pro in terms of quality

[34:41] and in terms of gameplay.

[34:43] You know, they're not there yet.

[34:46] But what?

[34:47] They've sold out on both of their titles and they took baby steps.

[34:50] Now the next game for spooky means everything.

[34:53] They know that.

[34:54] They know that because again, Alice Cooper, Nightmare Castle versus Guardians of the Galaxy.

[35:03] Who's gonna get the money?

[35:04] Right?

[35:05] They're going up against some juggernaut themes.

[35:07] And again, I'll say this.

[35:09] Marketing.

[35:10] I think Charlie picks themes that he wants to make.

[35:15] Did research, Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is what you should make?

[35:19] I don't know.

[35:20] I don't know.

[35:22] I don't think so.

[35:23] But he's taking baby steps.

[35:25] He's biting off what they can chew and we'll see what happens.

[35:28] But a year from now, this hobby is going to be completely different.

[35:33] Completely different.

[35:35] Enjoy the next two weeks of these reveals, of these announcements, of all this stuff

[35:40] going on in Pimball.

[35:42] It's going to make it really difficult for you to know where to spend your money.

[35:46] Personally, it's down to two games for me.

[35:49] It's down to Star Wars and it's down to Dial then.

[35:53] Those are the two games that I really can't make up my mind on.

[35:56] For obvious reasons, I don't know what Star Wars is yet.

[36:01] So I can't make up my mind there.

[36:03] I do know that Jersey Jack quality is just going to be better.

[36:08] That's just a no-brainer.

[36:10] I do know that an original theme with all the tech that's in Dial then is really appealing

[36:15] to me.

[36:16] But I know that the little boy in me is like, with Star Wars, Chris, what are you even

[36:23] like kidding right now that you wouldn't put Star Wars into the living room?

[36:29] Could I get both?

[36:31] That's a question that I think a lot of people also will be asking themselves, could I get

[36:36] both?

[36:38] The answer is yes.

[36:41] I could financially swing getting both games.

[36:44] I just don't want to get both at the same time.

[36:48] For some reason, it just feels like buying two cars at once.

[36:51] Even if you have a car collection, you kind of want to just get one at a time and then

[36:57] give yourself a few months to save up and get the next.

[37:02] I just don't want both at once.

[37:05] I don't know timing for both, but it seems like the Collector's Edition of Dial then

[37:11] and Star Wars LE will both most likely be somewhere around August releases.

[37:19] So I'm going to have to make up my mind.

[37:21] I mean, if I put those two together, that's over $20,000 probably for two pinball machines.

[37:30] I look forward to debating in my own head, which one I should get.

[37:34] I look forward to reading the conversations on Pinside about which one is the one to get.

[37:40] I can't wait.

[37:41] I love it when new pinball is revealed.

[37:44] I think Star Wars is going to create a dialogue and a debate like no other game.

[37:50] I really do.

[37:51] I think people are going to initially poo poo artwork on it.

[37:55] I think they're going to fall in love with the features of the game.

[37:58] I think they're going to hear the John Williams theme song and say take my money now.

[38:02] I think Dolden is going to be critically acclaimed.

[38:05] I think people are going to open it up and say how amazing the game is.

[38:10] And I think people are going to want both.

[38:11] I don't think people are going to crap on one or crap on the other or say like it's

[38:16] hands down ones the winner over the other.

[38:18] I don't think it's going to be that way.

[38:20] I think Alien is going to be a moment where people's patience will really be tested.

[38:26] I think the news that they have money to help bail them out is not going to be the immediate

[38:32] fix that people think because remember something when Jack needed money.

[38:37] Jack's production line was a well oiled machine.

[38:40] Jack had been making a lot of was machines and understood finally after so much financial

[38:48] trouble how to get the production line going.

[38:52] Andrew Highways company does not have the manufacturing and the production expertise

[38:59] or knowledge that Jack had when he got the money.

[39:03] I think Andrew's journey to get there is going to be a longer one.

[39:10] I really do.

[39:11] I don't think it's going to be this like oh yeah Ali's are all going to go out and

[39:14] June and July are like we're promise.

[39:16] I don't think that's going to be the case.

[39:17] I think those people's patience will be tried.

[39:20] I think Dutch pinball people's patience will be tried.

[39:24] I think P3 buyers there's only 2550 of them.

[39:29] I think those guys are going to be okay.

[39:31] I think they're going to really you know they're okay waiting for that different platform

[39:35] and what Jerry's promised.

[39:38] I think other than that you know I think it's going to be a six month period where again

[39:46] the whole hobby is going to start to question are any of these things really collectable.

[39:51] There's so many of them.

[39:53] There's such a supply now of new games.

[39:56] It's going to start to falter.

[39:59] The stall is going to start to come.

[40:02] The excitement of having all this new pinball is probably more exciting in the reality of

[40:08] too much new pinball will cause the market to stall and I think that's also going to

[40:13] happen but that will be another episode of Canadian pinball podcast.

[40:17] I fully expect to be back on the airwaves many times over the next few days because of

[40:23] what is going to transpire.

[40:27] I also may be going actually I am going to be going to Jersey Jack pinball on Thursday

[40:31] to talk to Jack.

[40:32] I'm super excited to get a tour and to sit down with him in his office and talk about

[40:37] JJP and dialed in and the future of his organization.

[40:41] I want to thank Jack for extending that offer to me.

[40:44] Very busy week.

[40:45] Very busy week for those guys out there who have been hitting me up to come on and be

[40:50] a guest on the show.

[40:52] We're going to make it happen.

[40:53] We're going to make it happen.

[40:54] I just have so much planned for the next couple of weeks.

[40:58] I'm even trying to get Steve Richie on the show.

[41:00] If you know Steve Richie, tell him to go on Canadian pinball podcast.

[41:05] I asked him and he said he may be come on.

[41:08] I got him maybe which is better than a no.

[41:10] It's better than I got from those girls when I was in high school.

[41:14] I hope you enjoy this episode.

[41:15] If you have any feedback, I will read your feedback or what you think is going to happen

[41:19] with all these rumors and these realities that are inundating the pinball world.

[41:24] That's it.

[41:25] This is an episode of I think 128 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[41:29] Have a great night everyone and I'm sure I'm going to talk to you probably within the

[41:32] next 48 hours.

[41:34] Good night.
