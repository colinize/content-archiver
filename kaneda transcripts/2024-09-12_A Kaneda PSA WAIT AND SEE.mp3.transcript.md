[00:00] If there ever was a moment in Pinball to justify the canada phrase I've been saying for the last

[00:26] few years, wait and see, it was last night's stream of X-Men Pinball by Stern Pinball. I'm

[00:34] not here to tell you like the game is gonna be horrible, it's not that bad. But what I saw last

[00:41] night and what I think a lot of people are picking up on is this is a game that's not quite ready

[00:47] for center stage. It's not quite ready to be in your home, it's not quite ready to be in game rooms,

[00:55] it's not quite ready to be out in the world. And here's the issue with everything now. At this

[01:01] much money, when you see a game where maybe the music is just driving people crazy and they need

[01:09] to work on that, and they maybe need to do that, maybe the callouts are really bad and they need

[01:16] to address the feedback on the callouts and maybe they need to do that. But Stern Pinball doesn't

[01:22] really do that. They don't really take this feedback into account and the reason why Stern

[01:26] Pinball normally doesn't make any of these changes because you've already given them your money.

[01:33] And if we go back a week from yesterday, people were already declaring this game to be the next

[01:41] greatest hit from Stern Pinball before you even saw the game. And I think we all have to just wake

[01:49] up. It's not just some people out there ordering Ellie's early, it's not people going to pinside

[01:54] proclaiming this to be the next great game since Godzilla. I think all of us need to understand

[01:59] some things and they're really easy to understand that a pinball machine is not great until you

[02:05] play it and realize that the sum of the parts are working together in a magical way to do a lot of

[02:12] stuff that needs to be done right for the game to be awesome. A game can look awesome, like Zombie

[02:19] Yeti can make anything look incredible. A game can have unique design. Jack Danger can design a unique

[02:25] layout like he did with X-Men. That doesn't mean the game is going to be great. It doesn't mean the

[02:31] game is going to be fun. It doesn't mean the code is going to be something you're going to want to

[02:36] jump on time and time again. And yet before any of you did that, you proclaimed it to be the game

[02:42] of the year. I saw this on pinside. People were saying this is going to win the game of the year

[02:46] without even seeing it. We are judging a book by its cover instantly and we're declaring X-Men

[02:53] the greatest game ever and Jersey Jack Pinball is in trouble and X-Men just destroyed Avatar.

[02:58] Like we were hearing that for an entire week and now look at the tune. And you know what's

[03:03] going to happen tonight? Jersey Jack is going to stream a fully featured game that is done. It's not

[03:10] going to have incomplete code. I think it's going to have like a fully fleshed out rule system.

[03:16] It's going to have moments. It's going to have clips and audio from the movie. It's going to have

[03:20] callouts. It's going to have music. Now look, I don't know if it's good or not. I'm going to see it

[03:25] tonight like the rest of you, but I'm going to make an early prediction. I think Avatar is going

[03:29] to stream 10 times better than X-Men did. And I think all of the mood and all of the vibe is going

[03:35] to teach everybody a very important lesson. You can't judge a pinball machine until you see it.

[03:41] See it being played until you jump on it, until you feel what it's going to feel like in your own hands.

[03:46] And I think there's no reason to buy any of these games early. Neither game should be bought early.

[03:50] Neither game should be ordered this week. If you ordered X-Men early, think how stupid that order

[03:56] feels right now because here's the thing. Here's the thing. And we all know this. X-Men is a game

[04:00] that needs at least six months to get better. Okay, so here's what's going to happen. In six months,

[04:06] when X-Men finally gets the polish it needs, Keith Elwin's new game will be out, right? Probably.

[04:12] Well, probably going to have another game from Metallica remastered. Spike 3 is going to drop

[04:17] in the world. I'm just going to say this right now. A $13,000 X-Men LE in six months will be $10,000.

[04:26] And you'll easily be able to get one. And the way things look last night, I don't think there's

[04:31] going to be like a huge demand to get one because remember everybody, you all think every game's

[04:36] going to end up being coded by the team that codes Keith Elwin's games and the team that has coded

[04:41] like games in the past. Remember when Lyman's Sheets took forever, but it was Lyman's Sheets.

[04:45] You knew he was going to end up with a masterpiece. Keith Johnson Kiefer is a great coder and he's

[04:50] coding Avatar. And as long as one switch doesn't equal multi-balls all throughout the gameplay,

[04:56] I mean, I think you're going to see something tonight that's going to run circles around

[05:00] what we saw in that X-Men stream last night. And not only just the code or the music or the call

[05:05] out. I'm just going to say this. I was watching gameplay and it looks really, really hard. These

[05:10] guys were draining left and right, draining, draining, draining. And these are really good

[05:15] pinball players that work at a pinball company. So what's going to happen to all these fat cat

[05:21] millionaires who barely turn their games on, who want to jump on and just have some fun and they're

[05:25] getting brutal gameplay from X-Men, right? And they're not having any fun. They're not going to be

[05:30] able to get the ball out of the danger room very often. They're not used to playing with the center

[05:35] post and there's a center post there for a reason, which means the game was damn brutally hard without

[05:39] it put there. And so all of a sudden, right, all of a sudden, everyone's learning that we all need

[05:45] to wait and see. We need to stop prematurely declaring these games amazing until they actually

[05:51] are amazing. The only thing amazing in pinball right now on day one is the pricing. That's the

[05:56] only thing that's amazing. Every game is priced as if it's the greatest game ever. And that is what

[06:02] is destroyed new in box for me. It's absolutely stupid. Before you even know if the game is good

[06:09] in invoice is inside your email for $12,999. That same game is going to be $9,999 in three months.

[06:21] And we've seen this before. There's only very few times in which any game can buck that trend

[06:28] of your game is going to plummet. The instant it comes out and that cardboard box is the same price

[06:34] as the bomb on the game, people. You all need to listen to Canada. The cardboard box

[06:41] in these games is the freaking bomb on the game. If you think Stern is putting more than $4,000

[06:49] into these games, you're wrong. If you think a Jersey Jack game has more than what, maybe five at

[06:54] the most, you're wrong. And those CEs are all going to lose five grand. And all we really want is either

[07:01] the prices to go down or the magic to go through the roof. Now the problem is that these prices,

[07:07] every game needs to be as good as the top 10 games on pin side. And they're not. And we're

[07:12] watching two B theme games battle it out. We don't know any other way to behave, right? We've got to

[07:19] like make some huge hyperbolic declaration about these games. We've got Bond on the Patreon chat

[07:26] of Canada saying X-Men's Amazing. No, it's not. It's a dude who bought Venom L. E. who just lost $4,000

[07:33] on a game saying it's the greatest game of all time. And you got to just understand the delusion

[07:38] of people like that. You're saying a game is the greatest of all time. And yet it lost four to $5,000

[07:47] in value in a year. Why? Because nobody else sees what you see. You're within your prerogative to

[07:52] like something. But man, at these prices, these games need to be more universally impressive,

[07:58] universally loved. And I'll just say this, after watching last night's stream, the game looks

[08:04] beautiful. I thought the stream didn't do the game any justice because the way it was shot top down,

[08:10] it flattened everything. And Zambietti's artwork doesn't really connote the ball trajectory. So

[08:16] when you're looking at it, it just looks kind of strange, you know, watching it, it did look like

[08:21] it had good flow and they were going back and forth on those ramps. That was really nice. But

[08:26] I'm just going to say this, like you didn't get any sense of like the Sentinel. I didn't get any

[08:31] feeling of the Magneto magnet didn't really do anything magical. I think that's my main takeaway.

[08:36] I just didn't see a single moment of wow, even when they went into the future, right? And the game

[08:43] goes dark. It just didn't feel like in Stern's current platform, right? It's like their lighting

[08:49] system is 10 years old, nothing about a Stern machine, atmospherically is creating a wow. It

[08:57] wasn't doing it for me. The Sentinel breaking up the ramps, I don't know, Magneto grabbing the ball,

[09:02] like it just didn't have that moment, like the head popping up and just bashing it didn't have the

[09:09] same like wow as like ballerogs swinging out and he's changing colors, you know, and then he opens

[09:17] up the pathway to the ring. There just wasn't this connective wow happening in the game. I felt like

[09:23] I saw Wolverine versus Sabertooth a thousand times over and this is it now, right? I'm excited to

[09:32] play the game. I'm going to jump on it. But how many of you out there need to have it now when

[09:38] it's incomplete for $13,000? So look, everybody, here's the deal. I think Avatar is going to run

[09:45] circles around X-Men when it comes to the stream and it's also, no matter what I see tonight,

[09:51] do you need a $15,000 or $12,000 Avatar this week? It's shipping this week and even though it's going

[09:57] to be really cool, this is the problem with all of Pimbal. If Avatar was $12,500 for a CE and $9,500

[10:03] for an LE, how many more of you would be keen on putting it in your game room? Because if you spend

[10:09] $12,500 at most it might go down to like 10 or 11, but if you spend $15,000, history has shown us

[10:19] with these Jersey Jack CEs. You're most likely, unless it's incredible, you're most likely going

[10:26] to take a humongous hit for rushing in early. I'm just so tired of all of the price being the

[10:31] conversation and they did it to themselves. They made us look at this stuff this way. They did it.

[10:36] Not us. This isn't us overreacting. It's us just put in a box by these companies.

[10:43] And I'm just going to tell everybody right now, look at Avatar with an open mind, but also just

[10:49] wait it out. Absolutely wait it out. We know Harry Potter's next. We know Keith Elwin is coming out

[10:57] with something in 2025. We know back to the futures coming out. Alice is coming out. We know Spooky

[11:03] Pimball is going to sneak in this December with something. I said it to someone last night,

[11:08] if you just wait until December, you will be able to get an X-Men LE for much less than 13

[11:15] after what we saw last night. You'll be able to get an Avatar CE for much less than 15 just by

[11:22] looking at history. You'll also be able to decide if you like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.

[11:28] You'll also get a new game from Spooky Pimball and you also are going to get Metallica remastered.

[11:34] So if you just wait three months, there will be five new Pimball machines that you will be able

[11:41] to get. Most of them you will be able to get for less than they came out for at MSRP New and Box.

[11:49] Three months. Can you do that? Can you spend 90 days getting in shape? P90X people, trust me,

[11:56] spend the next 90 days taking care of your bodies, your mind, upping your subscription from $5 to

[12:04] Canada to $10 to Canada now that the Saturday morning spectacular is back. Just a reminder,

[12:10] I'm taking the first couple weeks of October off so I hope you don't leave. People are crazy.

[12:16] I do so much content and I need to just take a couple of weeks off break and people are,

[12:21] I'm done. I'm done. I'm not, are you not getting your money's worth people? Come on. Come on.

[12:26] This isn't even an episode. It's a PSA. Everybody have a great day. Tomorrow I head to Jersey Jack.

[12:33] I'm going to see Avatar in person. We will see if Kerry Hardy is right and they installed extra UV

[12:40] lights on the ceiling to make that game pop. Do you see he's convinced that they had especially

[12:46] shooted that they're faking the amount of UV glow in the game? I will know when I get there.

[12:52] I just think the reason they did that is if you hit all the lights off, you can't shoot in complete

[12:57] darkness. I'm fully confident that a Jersey Jack machine when all the lights are turned off is

[13:03] going to glow, glow, glow. If there's one thing those games do well is really create impressive

[13:09] light shows and I just want to also say this. I'm so tired of people saying it's a negative

[13:15] that Jersey Jack has the greatest light show in the history of pinball as if that's a negative.

[13:22] If you think that lights don't equal an amazing pinball experience, what the heck do you think

[13:28] pinball was for like 70 years people? It was switches and lights that made people excited.

[13:35] They wanted to see the game light up and now we have a company that makes the game light up better

[13:40] than all pinball in history and you want to knock them for it? Go stand over in Elton John. It's the

[13:47] greatest like GI light experience in pinball history and Guns N' Roses is the greatest

[13:54] code light show in the history of all pinball and it's not a negative. You all wish, all you

[14:00] Stern fanboys wish that you were able to implement the Jersey Jack lighting system into your stern

[14:06] machines because it would have created much more atmosphere in X-Men last night. When they were going

[14:12] from the future to the present to the past, that transition in the game isn't very impressive with

[14:18] Stern's archaic lighting system. If it was a Jersey Jack game, they would have been able to make that

[14:24] game, talk to you and telegraph and come at you in a much more impressive way and yes, I'm going to

[14:30] end this by saying it, you need to get the X-Men theme song into this game. What's going on?

[14:36] You can't start X-Men and the X-Men theme song is not coming at you, Stern. I don't know what's

[14:41] going on here people. We need to change the music. We need to change the call outs and we need to all,

[14:46] all just remember, Canada's Pinball Podcast is going to give you an honest and objective opinion

[14:52] about Avatar when I go out there. They might be paying for my flight and my hotel room,

[14:58] but they're not paying for my opinions. I guarantee you that everybody. I'll talk to you soon.

[15:03] Canada out.
