[00:00] Welcome everybody to episode 1127 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, half-punch.

[00:29] Happy Monday morning.

[00:31] I hope each and every one of you has been outside during these summer months and is really

[00:37] enjoying the summer weather.

[00:40] So here's what we're going to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:44] We're going to talk about Star Wars, the game from Stern Pinball.

[00:49] It is maybe getting teased tomorrow.

[00:53] It might be Friday.

[00:55] If we look at how Stern historically does it.

[00:57] They tend to sort of do the teaser on a Friday and then the dealer distro call is the following

[01:04] Tuesday.

[01:06] Now it is August 25th.

[01:08] We know they want to have this game out on the line in September.

[01:13] There's been some weird rumor that it's not Star Wars, that Star Wars is the codename and

[01:19] it's going to be something else.

[01:21] I don't think that's the case.

[01:23] It's going to be Star Wars episode four, five and six.

[01:27] Is it going to be episode one through three?

[01:30] We're going to find out this week.

[01:33] But what I want to talk about on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast is what we want

[01:38] to see in the Star Wars game.

[01:41] We've had so much speculation about the theme itself, but what should be under the glass?

[01:48] If we think about the Steve Ritchie game, what was so disappointing about that game?

[01:54] Remember, it was based on the original trilogy.

[01:59] What a golden opportunity to have a freaking world under glass.

[02:04] You've got three iconic movies that are so packed with airplanes and death stars and

[02:12] X-wings and lightsabers and all these things, Millennium Falcons, all these things, sand

[02:19] people.

[02:20] I don't even know, you can keep going down a list and we're going to go into it.

[02:23] We're going to look at the top 10 moments from those Star Wars movies and we're going

[02:29] to see is there a way to incorporate this in a physical way into the Star Wars pinball

[02:36] experience?

[02:38] What did Steve Ritchie put into the game?

[02:41] He put in what is probably one of the most trivial things in all of the Star Wars storyline.

[02:48] The Hyperdrive is the main feature in the game.

[02:53] Then we had a TIE Fighter on a spring and then we had a Death Star that opened up.

[02:58] That was a really difficult shot and that was kind of it.

[03:03] There was no lightsaber, there was no adat, there was no X-wing, there was no real Millennium

[03:09] Falcon.

[03:11] There was nothing, nothing, there was no forcing the ball to be grabbed by the force.

[03:17] How do you not have force powers in a Star Wars pinball machine?

[03:22] We know that when he was designing the game, he wanted to put magnets underneath the center

[03:29] of that game because if you look at Star Wars, it is so empty.

[03:35] Here's my thing.

[03:36] I think these iconic movies that everybody loves, that is jam-packed with toys.

[03:42] Think about it.

[03:43] Think about when you were a kid.

[03:44] How many different Star Wars toys?

[03:48] Sorry, I'm going to just do this live.

[03:49] I'm going to keep the mistakes in on this episode because I don't feel like going back

[03:53] and re-editing it.

[03:54] I'm looking at myself on Patreon live right now.

[03:57] If you think about all the Star Wars toys that you owned as a child, how many of those

[04:03] could work as an under-the-glass mechanism in a Star Wars pinball machine?

[04:11] When I look at Harry Potter and it's selling very well, I still don't see the Harry Potter

[04:18] world under glass.

[04:20] There's no Hogwarts, the Quidditch in the upper left doesn't really feel like you're

[04:25] flying around the school like it does in the movie.

[04:30] Everyone's saying it's packed.

[04:31] I get it.

[04:32] It's modern, gas-lit pinball community now.

[04:35] Everybody says everything is packed when there's nothing really in the game at all.

[04:42] As I think about Star Wars and I dream about the possibilities of what can be in Star Wars,

[04:48] I'm hoping for more.

[04:50] I think Stern Pinball has to put more in this game.

[04:55] By the way, I could see on my audacity that it is absolutely, for some reason, it moves

[05:00] around the volume levels.

[05:02] I don't know how to fix that, but we'll fix it when I go into post-editing for this show.

[05:06] You're not even going to notice it because I'm going to have to raise it.

[05:09] I don't know.

[05:10] How many times do you have to do it?

[05:12] Here's the thing.

[05:13] Here's the thing.

[05:14] Let's think about the original trilogy and what we want in it.

[05:19] I'm going to pull up a little website I was looking at called the 10 Best Scenes in the

[05:23] Original Star Wars Trilogy.

[05:26] Let's ask ourselves, could this moment be recreated somehow?

[05:31] As a pinball moment of wow physically under the world of the glass, or are they going

[05:36] to do it all on the LCD screen?

[05:39] Luke, Han, Leia, and Chewbacca escaped the Death Star in a new hope.

[05:45] That is number 10.

[05:47] That scene where Obi-Wan fights Darth Vader and allows them to get out of the Death Star.

[05:53] Now look, I think it goes without saying that we definitely need the Death Star in this game.

[06:00] But we've never seen in a pinball game, and I think we need it for this game.

[06:05] We've never seen anyone have a physical Death Star where you could actually have a real

[06:12] green laser actually build up and shoot.

[06:17] I mean, just like a damn green light beam needs to shoot out of that Death Star, and

[06:24] that would be super cool.

[06:26] Do you think we're going to get some sort of really awesome interactive Death Star that

[06:31] just creates a moment?

[06:33] You know when the Death Star is charging up that sound?

[06:38] I want to feel the machine shake.

[06:41] I want to feel that Death Star powering up, and then I want to see it fire a green beam.

[06:47] It would be so awesome.

[06:50] So yes, that is one thing I would love to see in this John Borg Star Wars game.

[06:56] So number nine, the Battle of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back.

[07:03] A rebel defeat set the tone for the darkest chapter in the original trilogy.

[07:08] So yes, I think everybody wants to see that Adat Walker walking through the snow.

[07:15] And I think we're going to get it.

[07:16] I think we're going to see the Adat Walker, and I think there's going to be an orbit around

[07:20] his legs, and he's going to fall down.

[07:23] But I want to see it move.

[07:25] I want to see it shoot those lasers from its head like in the movie.

[07:30] So an Adat Walker under the glass, aps a freaking lute leaf.

[07:35] All right, the number eight scene is Leia witnessing the destruction of Alderaan in

[07:41] a new hope.

[07:42] Okay.

[07:43] So like going back to the first idea, if we have a Death Star, it should physically power

[07:50] up underneath the freaking glass.

[07:54] And yes, have it shoot that green beam and make that a moment in which Alderaan gets

[08:00] destroyed.

[08:02] Number seven, the rescue of Han Solo on Tatooine in Return of the Jedi.

[08:08] An adventurous scene that pushed Star Wars forward.

[08:11] Okay.

[08:12] So that's a good moment, I believe.

[08:14] Like Boba Fett has him and he's in Carbonite.

[08:17] So let's just think about that.

[08:18] Like I mean, maybe that's another scene I'm not going to see or I'm reading it in order.

[08:23] So Han Solo in Carbonite, has that ever been done in a Star Wars video game?

[08:31] No, why did I say video game in a pinball machine in the right way?

[08:35] Now how awesome would it be to lock the balls in Han frozen in Carbonite?

[08:44] It kind of makes sense, right?

[08:46] Freeze the balls, lock them in a Han Carbonite thing.

[08:50] And then he's sort of like, you know, turns up or moves up in the balls fall out and that

[08:55] starts Han in Carbonite multi-ball.

[08:59] That could be really cool.

[09:00] You know, I would love to see those like ships in the Jabba the Hudson that are flying over

[09:06] the sand to save Han Solo.

[09:09] So I definitely think that Han in Carbonite is something that should be in this game.

[09:14] Now the next one is where I get really excited.

[09:17] You think about pinball, you think about magnets, you think about moments of wow.

[09:23] Like could they figure out a way to do that?

[09:26] The training Luke in the Force in Empire Strikes Back.

[09:31] You know, how many of us just love that scene where he goes to Dagobah and he's looking

[09:38] for this great Jedi master and he sees little Yoda and doesn't feel like this little green

[09:45] creature could be that master.

[09:48] And he is and he teaches Luke how to use the Force.

[09:51] And of course, the iconic scene of raising that X-Wing fighter from the swamp to go help

[10:00] and save his friends.

[10:02] How do you not in a physical pinball game figure out a way to have an X-Wing sort of

[10:10] rise up slowly in that scene with that music?

[10:16] Super awesome.

[10:17] Another great example of something that physically could make sense in a pinball version of Star

[10:23] Wars episodes four, five and six.

[10:26] Number five, Darth Vader boarding the Tantive 4 in A New Hope.

[10:33] Alright, I didn't realize that's the name of the ship.

[10:35] I think it's when he gets on.

[10:37] The Vader's first scene is when he gets on like the big starship.

[10:42] You know, look, I think it's hard to have one of those big Star Destroyers in the game

[10:46] itself.

[10:47] They're huge.

[10:48] You know, they would just take up so much.

[10:51] So I don't really think that would work.

[10:53] It wouldn't be the best thing to put under a glass in a pinball machine.

[10:58] Number four, I knew this would come up.

[11:01] Darth Vader freezing Han Solo in Carbonite in An Empire Strikes Back.

[11:05] Absolutely.

[11:06] As I was saying, I think the whole Carbonite Chamber is something really, really amazing.

[11:13] And I would say like maybe, I don't know, just maybe a Carbonite Chamber as a lower

[11:20] play field could be really cool to create that sort of smoky effect when you're locking

[11:25] balls in that chamber.

[11:27] I don't know.

[11:28] You know, it's always like, I'm always like, I don't want to recommend lower play fields,

[11:33] but there might be some way to connect freezing in Carbonite and a lower play field into this

[11:39] game.

[11:40] Let's see.

[11:41] Number three, the destruction of the Death Star in a new hope.

[11:44] Okay.

[11:45] So you know how I feel.

[11:46] You know how I feel.

[11:47] The entire first movie is about shooting the sort of like firing the, I don't know, like

[11:55] the laser shot from the fighter, the X-Wing into that little chamber on the Death Star,

[12:03] which is like the way they blow it up.

[12:06] Right?

[12:07] I mean, that's like, that's like the whole thing about Rogue One is stealing the plans

[12:09] to the Death Star to know the weakness of the greatest sort of weapon that is in the

[12:15] galaxy.

[12:16] And so Luke makes his first run or the first group makes their run and they're, they shoot

[12:21] it in, but it's unsuccessful.

[12:23] And we all know the scene that Luke turns off his guidance system and Obi-Wan tells

[12:29] him to use the force.

[12:31] Now how do you not in a pinball game in which you are firing a silver ball into holes and

[12:41] scoops and you could easily create a single shot needed to blow up the Death Star.

[12:49] But you know how I feel about how they need to execute this.

[12:52] A pinball machine is always lit up.

[12:54] It's always trying to guide you.

[12:56] It's always trying to help you know what to shoot.

[12:59] Now I think it would just be one of the most magical moments in the history of pinball

[13:05] if when you had a fire that one shot, like it should ask you to cradle the ball, right?

[13:13] Then the whole machine should turn off.

[13:16] And all you should hear from the speakers is Obi-Wan talking to you like he talks to

[13:23] Luke on that final run to blow up the Death Star.

[13:28] And it's like, let go of everything.

[13:31] Use the force Luke.

[13:33] Turn off your guidance system.

[13:35] That's what they should use the machine to create that sense and that sort of magical

[13:41] moment in the pinball game.

[13:44] So all the lights should go out and then you should have just one chance with that cradle

[13:49] ball to fire it and try to blow up the Death Star.

[13:55] I think that would just be an OMG moment and I would love it.

[14:00] I would love it if they thought about how to creatively bring that scene to life using

[14:05] the software and the physical game and actually just turning it off.

[14:10] So look, this is why everybody I really do feel like sometimes there's just a disconnect

[14:17] from the emotional moments of these films and what pinball is doing and so few games

[14:24] have ever done it right.

[14:25] That's why people love Lord of the Rings so much.

[14:29] Lord of the Rings in so many like amazing ways comes at you with those like eight amazing

[14:36] moments from those three movies.

[14:39] And you feel it.

[14:40] Like they found a way to make you feel like you're in those battles.

[14:45] You're in those like moments and like they recreated them in pinball format in such a

[14:51] genius way.

[14:53] And that is why I don't like the Steve Ritchie Star Wars because I don't think it recreates

[14:58] any of the magic of Star Wars in a genius way.

[15:02] It's why I'm skeptical about Harry Potter.

[15:05] I'm not sure.

[15:06] But I get the game shoots really well.

[15:09] I'm just not sure it recreates the moments in a magical way that just again you're not

[15:16] going to be able to wait to get back to it again and again and again.

[15:19] The way you are in Lord of the Rings when you destroy that ring when you go through

[15:24] those multi balls when you get to there and back again.

[15:28] What a magical moment it makes you feel.

[15:30] All right.

[15:31] So let's see what else is number two is the Emperor's Throne Room.

[15:36] In return of the Jedi.

[15:39] It explored everything from Luke invaders relationship to the nature of Jedi and the

[15:44] force.

[15:46] So we all remember this right where the the Emperor's Throne Room that battle between

[15:52] Luke and Darth and the iconic sort of darkness of that scene and the clashing of what it

[16:00] was at the red and the green lightsabers.

[16:04] Now here's a thing that's I don't know how you do it but I would really really really

[16:10] love it if they could figure it out.

[16:12] Right.

[16:13] These you know it's funny right these pinball companies for seven to fifteen thousand dollars

[16:17] should be able to figure out some of this stuff that make us go wow and it shouldn't

[16:22] all fall on us.

[16:23] But how do you actually in a world under glass bring a lightsaber battle to life in

[16:30] an amazing way.

[16:31] The Ritchie game did not do it.

[16:34] You know you could have a lightsaber going up the side of the shooter lane like they

[16:37] do in that pinball two thousand or three thousand John Papadou came but I don't feel like that's

[16:43] it.

[16:44] I don't feel like that's it.

[16:45] You know I don't you can't really have characters clashing.

[16:48] It's probably the hardest thing to do.

[16:51] But I do think what would be amazing.

[16:54] Again this is like I don't know like Star Wars would probably make most sense to be

[16:57] a wide body if you ask me and you'd have lightsabers on each side the light side and

[17:02] the dark side and both them lighting up when you get into that battle would be kind of

[17:08] amazing not going to happen.

[17:10] Stern's never doing a wide body.

[17:12] But you know I'm curious to see how they recreate the energy and the magic of those

[17:19] iconic lightsaber battles.

[17:22] And then number one moment Luke invaders dual above Bespin and the Empire Strikes Back.

[17:29] The most iconic scene from the most iconic Star Wars movie.

[17:34] That is you know their battle that's right after they I think Freeze Han and Luke and

[17:40] invader are fighting.

[17:41] So you see like the lightsaber battles are sort of really the two most iconic scenes.

[17:46] And obviously when Vader takes off his helmet and stares at Luke for the first time there's

[17:52] so many more scenes right.

[17:53] I mean this is just scratching the surface but I think what we're getting in this like

[17:57] sort of top 10 is you know the moments we remember the physical moments.

[18:02] Now I would argue there's other iconic moments that might make sense for pinball like when

[18:08] the Millennium Falcon is hiding on the asteroid and there's really the big creature in there

[18:14] that tries to you know bite them because they didn't realize they're inside a creature's

[18:19] belly if you will.

[18:20] That was iconic.

[18:22] You notice how what's not in here are any of the Ewoks and the Ewok Village.

[18:27] You know that might make for an interesting upper play field but I think the Ewoks kind

[18:32] of annoyed people.

[18:33] They were sort of like at the tail end of the third movie and it wasn't really like what

[18:38] people loved.

[18:39] It seemed a little bit like childlike but man it's just like a lot of it when we think

[18:44] about it a lot of it is sort of you know bringing the battle happening between good

[18:50] and evil to life.

[18:52] So you know that's where I'm at.

[18:54] I want if I had to choose really the things I want to see in this movie I want to sorry

[18:59] in this movie in this pinball machine I want to see interesting use of magnets to create

[19:05] some sort of sense that the force is alive in this game.

[19:11] I want the Adat Walker.

[19:13] I want an orbit shot around the feet of the Adat Walker acting like you're harpooning

[19:19] its legs like in the movie and I want that Adat to fall down.

[19:23] I want a Death Star that really charges up and fires a green beam under the glass of

[19:31] the game.

[19:32] Maybe make it a topper that could be the other solution if you had an awesome Death Star

[19:37] topper that actually fired a green beam from the top of the game down onto the playfield

[19:42] somehow could be super cool.

[19:45] And then I want to feel really that excitement when those lightsaber battles happen.

[19:51] And I think finally you know really that Han in carbonite moment could be a really great

[19:57] way to lock to physically lock the balls in the game.

[20:01] So that's what I would love to see in Star Wars.

[20:04] I'm curious what some of you might say.

[20:06] Hey this is a time now because I've got a live chat going.

[20:09] It'd be interesting to see what people say in the live chat as we do this episode of

[20:13] Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[20:15] But I think in the end game like this is it for Stern.

[20:19] Like I don't mean like this is I mean I shouldn't say it so dramatically but they need to nail

[20:23] this game.

[20:24] They really need to make Star Wars a representation of what Stern is capable of moving forward.

[20:32] We're going to get like Spike 3.

[20:34] We're going to get the new big screen.

[20:36] We're going to get the new speaker system.

[20:38] We're going to get some of the new lighting.

[20:39] Not all of the new lighting.

[20:41] But for me Stern needs a big hit.

[20:44] The competition has caught up to them and even surpassed them.

[20:48] Spooky Pinball is making nicer games nicer looking games with more mechs in it than what

[20:54] Stern is selling us right now.

[20:56] And they're doing it on a really limited nature.

[20:59] They're only going to make 888 evil deads and then they're never making more.

[21:04] Stern is stuck right now because you know they're making volume but they've destroyed

[21:09] all of the collectability.

[21:11] And if they come out with Walking Dead after Star Wars everyone just feels like why go

[21:16] in on these Sterns anymore.

[21:17] Why at these new in box prices when they're just going to keep making more.

[21:22] And if the game is successful because think about it next year is the 50th anniversary

[21:27] of Star Wars.

[21:29] So we know much like Jaws they're going to make all these Star Wars games.

[21:35] And if you go in on the version you think is going to be the collectible one they're

[21:39] going to make another one next year.

[21:42] So you know this is it to me.

[21:45] This is it.

[21:46] This is the biggest property in this age demographic and they really need to nail it.

[21:52] We're going to see it in the next couple of weeks.

[21:55] A lot of people are looking at this game and you know we're going to see if the rumors

[21:59] are true and you know the rumors are that over at Stern not everybody's happy.

[22:04] The work environment is a little toxic.

[22:07] People are saying Keith Elwin is not happy.

[22:08] John Borg is not happy.

[22:09] I don't know.

[22:10] We'll see.

[22:11] We'll see.

[22:12] If this game crushes and it feels like as an entire organization and I mean this Stern

[22:18] pinball has Star Wars.

[22:20] They want to bring it back and make a statement.

[22:23] In my honest opinion it shouldn't all fall on to John Borg.

[22:27] This should have been a game and I don't think it's going to be but it should have been a

[22:30] game where Stern pulled all of its resources and made a statement.

[22:35] They need a statement game.

[22:37] They should have had everybody weigh in on how do we make this the greatest statement

[22:42] of what Stern pinball is capable of because you can't keep going back to the Star Wars

[22:47] well.

[22:48] And this is it.

[22:49] Like if this just feels like John Borg designed this in a siloed way and didn't get input

[22:54] from Elwin on geometry and Gomez didn't chime in and the best software people over there

[23:00] didn't like help out and it's just like they just made it in a silo then I think it's going

[23:05] to be a compromise.

[23:07] But I think if Stern as an organization realized the magnitude of this game after passing on

[23:14] back to the future after allowing companies like Spooky to grab Beetlejuice, grab Goonies,

[23:21] all these like Jody was asleep at the wheel he basically let all these other companies

[23:25] grab nostalgic properties that people want and they made so many bad licensing decisions.

[23:32] This is it.

[23:34] This is it.

[23:35] This is retribution time for the biggest company in the world that makes pinball and let's

[23:39] see if they deliver.

[23:41] Everybody happy Monday.

[23:42] This was fun doing it on Patreon live as you can see I didn't make many mistakes.

[23:46] I can go live.

[23:47] I can go real time and we can do it and we can have a lot of fun.

[23:51] I'm going to get this audio uploaded right now and then it's nine o'clock.

[23:55] I got to go to work.

[23:56] This is how canada does it kids go to school.

[23:58] I do a show.

[23:59] I do it two three times a week.

[24:00] I hope you guys enjoy this and we'll be back this week with more episodes of canada's pinball

[24:06] podcast.
