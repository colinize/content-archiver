[00:00] Welcome to episode 323 of Canada's Pinball Podcast where coming at you from a burger

[00:20] king.

[00:21] That's where we're gonna do the big reveal of the Black Knight.

[00:24] Ha ha ha.

[00:25] Stern Pinball.

[00:27] The biggest pinball company in the world.

[00:28] What a funny April fools joke.

[00:30] I mean, I have a sense of humor.

[00:32] I do.

[00:33] But I just found that to be pretty lame.

[00:35] I mean, I get it.

[00:36] I get it.

[00:37] But look, here's the thing.

[00:39] I do feel.

[00:40] I do feel this like arrogance that is sort of emanating from Stern Pinball lately and I'm

[00:45] kind of getting annoyed by it and I kind of want someone out there to pick up a sort

[00:51] of rage and I want them to slay the Black Knight.

[00:55] And now here's the funny part.

[00:56] The ironic thing to me is the Black Knight, the Dark Castle, you know, the evil kingdom

[01:02] in pinball, I'm starting to feel a little bit like it might be Stern Pinball that they

[01:06] might be, you know, the Sauron and the evil empire a little bit.

[01:12] And I don't know.

[01:13] I don't know.

[01:14] I'm just feeling this sense of arrogance.

[01:16] That's kind of annoying me the last few days and as I've been away from the pinball

[01:19] scene, you know, not reading pin side.

[01:21] Here's what I mean by that.

[01:23] I really was just annoyed that the Black Knight didn't get revealed at TPS.

[01:28] I can't shake this feeling that Stern Pinball just didn't bring that game or even allow

[01:34] Steve Richie to talk about that game at TPS and they just held the news for two days to

[01:39] just do a stupid IGN story.

[01:41] I mean, Zach, Jody, do you guys really think IGN sells you one more pinball game?

[01:47] Let me break it down for you right now.

[01:49] Nobody gives a shit about IGN pinball stories.

[01:52] It doesn't even hit your demographic.

[01:55] It doesn't hit your target and your target is on the forums.

[01:59] Your target is on Facebook.

[02:00] Your target is at TPS.

[02:02] And I just find that that just reeks of arrogance that we're too good for the biggest pinball

[02:08] show in Texas.

[02:10] We'll send Steve Richie and we won't allow him to talk about his new game.

[02:15] We'll do it two days later on an inconsequential website to your target.

[02:19] I mean, how annoying is that?

[02:21] And how arrogant is that?

[02:23] And I've been reaching out to people, you know, distributors being like, why are they doing

[02:26] this?

[02:27] Like why wouldn't they bring it to the show?

[02:29] Why wouldn't they just reveal it at the show?

[02:32] And people are like, well, that's how Stern does it now.

[02:34] And are we just supposed to say, yeah, that's cool.

[02:37] Well, I don't know.

[02:38] I kind of think Stern always doing this.

[02:40] They blow off Expo.

[02:41] They blow off TPS.

[02:42] I don't think it's like we should applaud that.

[02:45] I think it's them beating their chest and saying, we're better than you.

[02:49] We're better than you TPS.

[02:51] We're better than you, Expo.

[02:52] We don't need to go where you're at, where the fans are at.

[02:56] And I am here to tell Stern Pimble.

[02:58] And I know they listen to this show.

[03:00] I think that reeks of arrogance because the people that are buying your $9,000 machines,

[03:05] the people that are spending their hard-earned money on your games, which we all know, we all

[03:10] know Stern.

[03:11] We've revealed this on this show.

[03:13] We know these games aren't worth anywhere close to $9,000 or $7,500.

[03:17] But we still buy them because you do put out a fun Pimble product.

[03:22] We know we're getting ripped off, but we support you, Stern, and we go in on your games.

[03:26] For you to then constantly avoid the community at the different shows is just, I think, is

[03:32] fucked up.

[03:33] And I do.

[03:34] And you know what I'm talking about.

[03:35] It's not about Marco coming with all the monsters.

[03:38] I get that.

[03:39] And your presence at the show is felt.

[03:42] But when it comes to your complete avoidance of shows, when it comes to reveals, because

[03:47] you know that so many people go to these shows for reveals, and then you stick it to them.

[03:52] You give them nothing.

[03:53] And Steve Richie gets up there and is like, I'm going to reveal some surprises.

[03:56] And it's just a bullshit one hour seminar where he says nothing.

[03:59] Why?

[04:00] I'm just annoyed.

[04:01] I'm annoyed that Stern thinks they're better than the community when it comes to these

[04:05] shows.

[04:06] And they don't really care to give you anything of value.

[04:10] And I think it's going to bite them in the ass a little bit.

[04:12] And I'm starting to root more against them lately because I don't think they should behave

[04:18] that way.

[04:19] Not after so many people who pay and travel to go to these shows, so many of those people

[04:25] deserve more from Stern.

[04:28] And Stern should really give them more information and value and presence and not make it all

[04:34] just one big joke like we're just a bunch of suckers who no matter when you reveal, no

[04:39] matter when you put a product out there, it's going to be successful.

[04:43] Because I start, I'm even starting to think that Stern doesn't even have much of a strategy

[04:46] anymore when it's like title on top of title on top of title.

[04:50] I mean, think about it.

[04:52] How old news now is the monster?

[04:53] It's like who the monster feels like it came out two years ago now.

[04:57] I mean, who's even like in on it still?

[05:00] There's no conversation around it anymore.

[05:02] It's like it's yesterday's news.

[05:03] Now everyone's on to black night.

[05:05] We're waiting to see when that game's going to be flipped next week.

[05:07] How it's going to play.

[05:09] It's like it's unbelievable.

[05:11] It's like a movie studio putting out one movie a week and you can't even figure out when

[05:16] you're going to go see the first one, let alone the fact that the second one's already

[05:20] out.

[05:21] And that's what it feels like.

[05:22] They're just dropping stuff on top of stuff and nothing's starting to feel special anymore.

[05:27] It's just on to the next.

[05:29] All right.

[05:30] Now look, what I hope Stern does moving forward and I mean this Stern, I think you need

[05:34] to stop fucking over the shows.

[05:36] I think you need to stop avoiding the shows and look, we're about to get the black night

[05:41] at Midwest gaming classics.

[05:43] So look, Stern is not saying fuck you to every show, right?

[05:46] They're going to be there.

[05:47] They're going to bring the black night there.

[05:50] My whole point was why didn't they just reveal it at T.P.F. and give all those people who

[05:55] travel to Texas and give all of those Stern fans who were at Texas and give Steve Richie

[06:00] who was also at Texas a great moment to show the game to the world for the first time

[06:06] because I got to be honest, it wasn't a great moment just to have a stupid IGN story

[06:12] go up.

[06:13] I mean why?

[06:14] Why?

[06:15] And that story was so like whatever, the interview, like the last question was like how

[06:19] easy is it to remove and clean the upper plate?

[06:22] It's like what fucking question is that in a pinball story where you're trying to get people

[06:26] excited about the game, all right?

[06:29] IGN.

[06:30] Like 10 years ago, 15 years ago in terms of it doesn't even hit the target.

[06:34] If I were to put together a media list, all right, where should we go out with the news

[06:37] to get pinball buyers excited?

[06:39] IGN.

[06:40] Yeah, you guys really go to IGN on a daily basis.

[06:42] Nobody does who's into pinball.

[06:44] Nobody.

[06:45] Nobody.

[06:46] I get the writers into pinball, but that's not where you go.

[06:49] More people will get excited if you just go to pinball machines for sale on Facebook

[06:53] or you go to pinside or you reveal it on this week in pinball.

[06:56] Why not give Jeff who has a pinball website dedicated to pinball who I bet more people,

[07:04] more people will read this week in pinball who are into pinball than will read IGN who

[07:09] are into pinball.

[07:10] Okay, I guarantee you the traffic is higher and this is where we are with modern media.

[07:15] It's more important to go to where there's real influence than it is to go to just a broad

[07:20] site that covers way more stuff than just your focus.

[07:24] And most people who go to IGN can give two shits about pinball.

[07:27] All right, what else is going on in the pinball world?

[07:30] So I'm really excited because this week, this week, and when I say this week, I mean

[07:36] tomorrow, I might be able to get my hands on the next game from Jersey Jack pinball.

[07:43] And I'm hearing, so this is why I said I thought they were going to reveal this week because

[07:46] I'm scheduled to go to Jersey Jack pinball tomorrow on Friday to play the next game from

[07:53] Jersey Jack pinball.

[07:54] Now, I'm told someone's been telling me they're also going to be talking to some people

[07:58] at JJP and the meeting or the interviews will be in bargoed until next week.

[08:04] Now, here's what I don't want to do.

[08:05] I don't want to like spoil any plans Jersey Jack pinball has for the launch of their next

[08:12] title.

[08:13] Okay, but what I won't do is just wake up today and sound like an ignorant fool who doesn't

[08:18] know what's going on in the Jersey Jack world.

[08:21] It's Willy Wonka.

[08:22] And I think it's absolutely ridiculous that they might be asking people not to reveal

[08:26] what the title is.

[08:27] It's Willy Wonka.

[08:29] It's on Jersey Jack's own Facebook page.

[08:32] Their new videos have the never ending gobstoppers as the pinballs.

[08:38] It's Willy Wonka.

[08:39] We've been saying it now for weeks.

[08:41] We all know it's going to be Willy Wonka.

[08:43] Okay, but what I won't do, what I won't do, if I go over there tomorrow and I play the

[08:48] game and I talk to Jack and interview Jack about the game, I'm not going to like spoil

[08:56] what is on the game for you because I do want to respect all the hard work that they put

[09:01] into the game and I want them to reveal it for you for the first time.

[09:05] And I also think it's really shitty to sort of spoil maybe some of the mechanisms or the

[09:10] toys or the layouts with a podcast like what a crappy way to like, you know, think about

[09:17] what's going to be in that game.

[09:18] I still want the game to live on in your imaginations until you see it until the curtain is pulled

[09:24] back.

[09:25] Right?

[09:26] It'd be like trying to describe to someone what a great song sounds like using a podcast.

[09:30] I think it'd be terrible.

[09:31] All right.

[09:32] So I'm really excited.

[09:34] That's the plan.

[09:35] I'm supposed to go over there tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. and play the game.

[09:38] I will also be carrying with me a check for $12,500 made out to Jersey Jack pinball because

[09:48] if I like what I see and I like what I play, I am putting down a check for a collector's

[09:54] edition of Willy Wonka.

[09:57] And that is how much I like this theme.

[10:00] It is how excited I am for a pat-lawler game that's not based on a theme that makes me

[10:05] want to blow my head off.

[10:07] It's how excited I am for a Jersey Jack standard body game.

[10:10] I don't like wide body pinball.

[10:13] That's how excited I am for a Jersey Jack game based on a classic movie where they have

[10:18] the entire assets to the game.

[10:21] Now here's what I know a little bit about the game and I'm going to give you some news

[10:24] right now.

[10:25] This is not spoiling anything.

[10:26] I hear there are four songs from the original movie that are in the pinball machine, which

[10:31] is great.

[10:33] There aren't that many songs in the movie itself.

[10:36] I think there's like five or six.

[10:38] They're probably not going to do the, you know, the Charlie, the one the mom sings.

[10:42] Is it the mom even singing it?

[10:43] But there's like a couple sappy songs.

[10:45] But if there's four songs from Willy Wonka in the game, I think you're going to get like

[10:50] the candy man song.

[10:51] I think you're going to get the world of imagination.

[10:55] I forget all the titles of the songs.

[10:56] You're going to get the good ones.

[10:57] You're going to get the Oompa Loompah song.

[10:59] It's going to have to be in there.

[11:00] So it's going to be great.

[11:01] I'm also hearing that there is going to be a physical ball lock on the limited edition

[11:08] game.

[11:09] So Jack is starting to remove some parts from the games when he's thinking about the standard

[11:16] editions of Jersey Jack games.

[11:18] Now does that mean he's trying to adopt a little bit of a pro model?

[11:22] Maybe.

[11:23] Maybe.

[11:24] But here's the thing.

[11:25] You can't charge $8,500 and remove mechanisms and call it a pro.

[11:30] The reason why Stern is able to have that gap between the pro and the premium is it's

[11:35] only like $5,500, right?

[11:38] Or $6,000.

[11:39] But the street price is like $5,500 on a Stern pro.

[11:42] It'd be really hard to sort of spend $8,500 and get stuff removed from a game.

[11:49] I still think Jack is sort of struggling to find his way in the three tiered system of

[11:55] games.

[11:56] And if I were to recommend something to Jack, it would be, you've got to go one way or

[12:01] the other.

[12:02] You've got to go one way or the other.

[12:03] You really got to strip it down and get it around like $6,500 or you stay premium and

[12:10] you don't yank stuff out and you don't have so many variations of the game and you set

[12:14] a limit on day one and say we're only going to make $1,500 Willy Wonkas.

[12:19] You know, we're going to make $500 collectors editions and $1,000 premium editions and that's

[12:24] it.

[12:25] And you stay premium.

[12:26] But I think Jack's still trying to figure this out as they go.

[12:30] I'm going to actually talk to him about that when I'm there.

[12:32] I think they need to figure this stuff out.

[12:34] It just feels like they're marketing strategy and they're plan about how they're positioning

[12:39] these games.

[12:40] It like changes every single launch and I don't think that's good.

[12:44] I think he has a great product.

[12:46] I think he needs to make up his mind.

[12:48] Are you the Rolls Royce of Pimball?

[12:50] And if that's the case, you can't just remove the headrest from a Rolls Royce and try

[12:55] to get people to still pay Rolls Royce prices.

[12:58] And now they have a car without headrest, which is my metaphor for physical ball lock.

[13:03] Now, I really hope the quality is there because I have to say this.

[13:07] All of you pired to the Caribbean fanboys out there.

[13:11] Do me a favor.

[13:12] Open up the pin side thread and tell me.

[13:15] Tell me that this game is not the biggest mechanical disaster when it comes to quality

[13:21] control of any Pimball machine I've ever seen.

[13:25] And I've been covering this hobby for a enough time.

[13:28] This is the worst quality controlled modern Pimball experience I've ever seen.

[13:33] Some guy opened it up new in box and there was like 12 things wrong with the game out

[13:38] of the box.

[13:39] And so the question becomes, who's to blame for all these quality issues?

[13:44] Is it Eric's engineering or is it the people on the line?

[13:49] Which one's which, right?

[13:50] And I'm trying to figure this out because what stuff just engineered in a way that wouldn't

[13:55] hold up over time that they should have caught during that entire year they had to test

[14:00] the game.

[14:01] What's going on here?

[14:03] Or are the games screwed together in a way that just aren't properly assembled?

[14:08] And so when you get it, there's just stuff broken.

[14:10] Now, it's probably a little bit of both, right?

[14:13] Because there's stuff people are opening up at a box where it's just like the switch is

[14:16] not working.

[14:18] And that just means like the switch isn't either installed correctly or it's a bad switch.

[14:23] But that means to be caught at the factory before the game goes into a box.

[14:27] And I just, I don't even feel like they're testing these games.

[14:30] There's no way that like 12 things should go haywire between, you know, the completion

[14:36] of, of, of, of, of, of manufacturing and in a box and you open it up.

[14:41] There's no way during shipment that all that stuff is going crazy.

[14:43] So look, Pirates of the Caribbean, I'm telling you, a week from now, a week from now, Pirates

[14:48] of the Caribbean is about to become a distant memory.

[14:51] It is not going to be the greatest game of all time.

[14:54] It is not going to be so sought after.

[14:56] It's not going to be that game.

[14:57] I think when you see Pat Lawler's Willy Wonka and you see a standard body Jersey Jack

[15:03] game with all of the assets, you're going to see what real theme integration looks like.

[15:08] And people are going to be reminded because I think that Hobbit had it in spade, but

[15:12] the Hobbit was just a, you know, lackluster design.

[15:15] I think this is this, this kind of has to be the game that makes us all believe in Jersey

[15:20] Jack.

[15:21] You know this, they have to know this.

[15:23] I'm so excited to go over there within 24 hours from now.

[15:26] Hopefully I will see the game in front of me for the first time.

[15:30] The other thing I'm hearing is the, the standard edition artwork is the big Willy Wonka logo.

[15:37] And the Ellie artwork is supposed to be phenomenal.

[15:40] No word on what the collector's edition will be and what kind of stuff is going to be

[15:43] in that game.

[15:44] So that's what we know.

[15:45] The pricing is the same as, as Pirates of the Caribbean.

[15:48] All right.

[15:49] What else is going on in Pimball?

[15:50] If you are a spooky pinball fan and you are waiting for your Alice Cooper's nightmare

[15:55] castle, they are going out the door.

[15:57] I just saw the other day that yesterday or today, spooky is now offering target decals for

[16:04] their games.

[16:05] So if you want to put target decals on your spooky machine, they will either install them

[16:09] for you at the factory.

[16:11] So if your Alice Cooper has not been manufactured yet, give them a little email or note and

[16:17] they will happily put them on.

[16:18] I also think this is just so basically simple ways to make additional revenue for Pimball.

[16:24] Right.

[16:25] Giving people the chance to upgrade their games with different things after they buy it is

[16:30] really easy.

[16:31] Right.

[16:32] And there's like high profit margins on stuff like stickers and toppers and inner art

[16:37] blades and armor.

[16:39] Like this is where the real profit is because we know that a lot of these collectors, they

[16:45] love to dress these games up.

[16:46] And I'm still surprised that the modding world is still outside of the manufacturers for

[16:53] the most part.

[16:54] I'm still shocked by that.

[16:56] That there's still so many great mods that the money and the revenue is not going to

[17:00] the manufacturer.

[17:01] It's going to the mod, the mod folks.

[17:04] But it's also like I like that too though.

[17:06] I do like people outside of these companies having the creative freedom to make all the

[17:12] coolest mods for these Pim.

[17:14] So it is cool that we get the choose from both.

[17:17] And we got like Mezzel mods.

[17:19] We've got the mod couple.

[17:20] We've got Penn State and a lot of great modding out there that's going on.

[17:24] That's really, really cool.

[17:26] I love modding in Pimball.

[17:28] One of my favorite things was dressing up my Batman 66 and dressing up my Lord the Rings

[17:33] which is some of the coolest mods.

[17:34] I mean you can't really stand over a Batman 66 unless it has all those available mods

[17:40] that the mod couple created in Yilo Bird.

[17:43] I mean he changed the game.

[17:45] He absolutely changed the game and made it look like a premium game.

[17:48] All right.

[17:49] I know some people are wondering whether or not my Batman 66 prediction that another art

[17:54] package is coming will be true or not.

[17:56] We're going to see if that happens.

[17:58] That's the rumor I'm hearing.

[17:59] No, it's not going to be a new play field artwork.

[18:02] It's Cabin artwork.

[18:03] It's a new cabinet theme if you will.

[18:06] So we'll see if that comes to fruition.

[18:08] I would just wait.

[18:09] I mean why by one now?

[18:11] We're not going to stop making Batman.

[18:13] I think it's worth waiting.

[18:14] But if you get one now and you get a signed Adam West card, that's cool.

[18:18] You lucked out.

[18:19] I know a lot of people are sort of bummed out that they ordered their Batman premiums

[18:22] a while ago and stern didn't give signed Adam West cards and now they're putting them

[18:27] back in.

[18:28] Whatever, what are they going to do?

[18:29] You win some of your loose some.

[18:30] I mean I don't blame them for that.

[18:32] I mean whatever.

[18:33] They're drumming up excitement later on in the game's run and that's a good way to do

[18:36] it.

[18:37] So you know, well I would do the same thing.

[18:39] All right.

[18:41] Anything else, anything else?

[18:43] Yes.

[18:44] Yes.

[18:45] So I'm waiting to get Josh Kugler back on the show.

[18:47] I have to say I saw this.

[18:49] I saw this correspondence between, let's see, Josh was in the October fest threat and

[18:56] games like October fest.

[18:57] And this is why again, you listen to the show and I say this all the time.

[19:01] This is why marketing matters as all these games are getting announced and all this stuff

[19:05] and all this hype and all this all the availability of these games are becoming present.

[19:11] How much harder is it now to convince people to go by, you know, games like October fest

[19:17] and the game has been revealed now for over six months and people are waiting to get them

[19:23] and they had a good showing at T.P.F.

[19:25] But you know, as we say all the time, the more time you give people to think about it

[19:31] that usually works against you in the pinball world.

[19:34] I'm even surprised, Stern showed black night so early and the game's not really on the

[19:38] line yet.

[19:39] I mean, I did see some cabinets, so maybe it is on the line.

[19:42] But you know, they didn't even give monsters premium a chance to go out the door and they

[19:46] have got a new game.

[19:47] But I saw some correspondence and I want to just read something because you know me on

[19:51] this podcast.

[19:53] I give everyone a fair shot.

[19:55] But sometimes I read stuff and sometimes I see how the pinball community responds to

[20:00] things in these games.

[20:01] And these are expensive toys.

[20:03] Let's not forget that.

[20:04] A $7,500 toy you don't need.

[20:08] And one of the new things that is in every pinball experience now are the animations on

[20:13] the LCD screen.

[20:15] And we have seen animations from Jersey Jack, Stern pinball, October fest, sorry, you know,

[20:22] American pinball with Houdini and October fest, spooky pinball, you know, so the LCD screen,

[20:28] it's now become a really important piece of real estate to fill up with stuff on a pinball

[20:34] machine.

[20:35] We saw it on highway pinballs, alien did a great job with it.

[20:38] And so all these companies, all these companies have invested in making that LCD screen part

[20:44] of the pinball experience, you know, even even seeing, you know, companies like Chicago

[20:47] Gaming where they kind of go halfway, which still DMD, but they're, you know, making

[20:51] it larger.

[20:52] But here's the thing.

[20:54] You can't look at animations in pinball in a vacuum anymore.

[20:59] And you can't look at the animations and say, hey, that's really great because here's

[21:03] what I think the problem in pinball is, it's 2019.

[21:06] And it took pinball so freaking long to go from DMD to LCD.

[21:11] It's a joke.

[21:12] It was like going from a rotary phone, right, to a new Apple like iPhone X.

[21:18] That's the equivalent of pinball and how, how in, in, in like, we were so outdated and

[21:26] using obsolete technology.

[21:29] So like all the way up to Ghostbusters, we were still using DMD.

[21:33] And that is the equivalent of giving someone a rotary phone as a gift in the year, what,

[21:38] like 2016 that we were using 30, 40 year old technology, even older in these modern

[21:45] games that we're selling for, for $8,000, $9,000.

[21:49] What a joke, right?

[21:50] All right.

[21:51] So now there's parody.

[21:52] There's parody in the pinball world in which almost every game that's new has the LCD.

[21:58] Now, the biggest complaint we've seen around October fest revolves around two things.

[22:03] It revolves around the artwork in the game.

[22:06] People have complained that it's too busy.

[22:08] It's, you know, there's too much going on.

[22:10] You know, there, there's just, it doesn't seem like there's a cohesive art direction.

[22:14] But the biggest complaint if you hear from people, because I do think people like the,

[22:18] you know, the shots in the game, I think they like the uniqueness of it.

[22:20] I think they like the mechanisms.

[22:22] One of the biggest complaints in this also carried over from Houdini were the animations

[22:27] in October fest and in Houdini.

[22:30] And so Josh, I, I think they have someone doing the animations.

[22:34] I know Josh is working on the coding, but I think Josh is also connected to the animations

[22:39] on the game.

[22:40] And Josh said something.

[22:41] I read it.

[22:42] He said this on Pinside.

[22:44] He said, I've had animators from multiple companies comment to me that they feel the criticism

[22:52] of our animations is out of line with what we have done.

[22:57] There's a lot of good stuff on our display.

[23:00] All right.

[23:01] Now, look, I want to get Josh on the show.

[23:03] I do.

[23:04] I want you to come on, Josh.

[23:05] I think it's the perfect time to come on and sell October fest to my listeners.

[23:10] 2000 people listen to Canadian's pinball podcast.

[23:14] 2000 people who are pinball collectors.

[23:16] All right.

[23:17] How many Houdini's were sold?

[23:19] I guarantee you not 2000.

[23:21] So we can even get like, you know, a half of my listener base to consider October fest.

[23:26] I think that's a really important thing to do.

[23:29] So let's come on the show.

[23:30] But here's the thing, Josh.

[23:31] Look, I, I don't think, I don't think the LCD is as important as all these companies

[23:36] make it out to be.

[23:37] So I want to start with that.

[23:38] Too many companies are placing too much emphasis on the screen.

[23:42] And I think you guys have done a great job in packing the play field with awesome toys.

[23:48] And I think that to me, that is where the important part of pinball should be beneath

[23:52] the glass.

[23:53] Okay.

[23:54] Now, that being said, you can't tell me that animators out there in 2019 took a look at October

[24:01] fest animations and were like, you don't deserve criticism that you guys actually have

[24:06] some good stuff going on there.

[24:08] I just have to say, come on, come on.

[24:11] There's the animations are rudimentary at best.

[24:17] This stuff looks like stuff I had on my PC computer like 25 years ago.

[24:23] I don't understand.

[24:25] I don't understand.

[24:26] I don't think we can look at this stuff and pretend like we're not seeing animations

[24:30] happen on mobile games, on cell phones, and it's not that expensive to get good animations.

[24:36] This doesn't look like there's much effort or much talent being applied to these animations.

[24:43] I'm sorry.

[24:44] I'm sorry.

[24:45] I work with animators all the time.

[24:47] I actually grew up in the beginning of my career in the video game industry.

[24:52] And I saw people's mobile games like 15 years ago that were far better than the animations

[24:58] we're seeing now in these games.

[25:00] And video game animations have been better for like 20 years than what we're seeing in

[25:04] these pinball machines.

[25:05] So no, no, like just I think American pinball needs to rethink their entire animation process.

[25:15] And here's the thing, October Fest is $1,000 more per game than Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[25:21] Castle.

[25:22] And I can see why because the money was clearly spent on what's on the play field.

[25:27] There's far more on the play field of October Fest than Alice Cooper's.

[25:31] But Alice Cooper's animations blow away.

[25:34] October Fest animations.

[25:38] And so I just want to say for the record, I want Josh to come on the show.

[25:43] But I will tell him if he comes on the show, I think these animations are piss poor.

[25:47] I don't think they should be celebrated.

[25:49] I don't think they show any talent in animation.

[25:51] I think they're embarrassing.

[25:53] I would be embarrassed to put up those animations next to what we're seeing in the other games.

[25:58] If you can't get the animations right or to look good, then don't do it that way.

[26:05] It feels like, you know what it feels like to me?

[26:07] It's like wearing a tuxedo.

[26:09] And everyone's going to like a formal party.

[26:12] Let's say everyone's going to this pinball party, right?

[26:14] And it's a formal party.

[26:15] And that's a metaphor for all the games coming out this year.

[26:18] It's like wearing a tuxedo and you got a big fucking gravy stain on your white shirt.

[26:23] And you're still at the party thinking like no one's going to notice.

[26:26] Like we're not going to notice these animations are so bad in comparison.

[26:30] And I think, Dovel and Normal, I have to say this.

[26:33] I have to say this.

[26:34] I don't know what they're doing when it comes to this kind of stuff.

[26:37] How do they stand over this and say it's a good game?

[26:41] And I'm going to say something that other people won't say on pinball podcasts.

[26:44] I don't think Dovel and Normal are pinball people.

[26:47] I don't think they have a pinball vision or a pinball plan.

[26:51] I mean, they're the children of a guy who made the chips and the board sets.

[26:57] That's where they come from.

[26:59] They don't come from the pinball world.

[27:02] It's really, I don't know.

[27:04] I just don't get the sense that they have a creative vision for the company.

[27:09] So then the question becomes is this, I'm okay with that, right?

[27:12] It's nothing against them.

[27:13] I mean, I wish my dad had like a multi-million dollar board chip company that I was the, you

[27:17] know, inheriting one day and I was a son of.

[27:20] But here's the question then, who is creatively directing American pinball?

[27:24] Who is it?

[27:25] Who's the visionary of that company?

[27:27] I mean, they hire John Papaduke.

[27:29] They let him do nothing for a year.

[27:31] So who's the creative visionary?

[27:32] Is it Josh?

[27:33] Is it Joe?

[27:34] Like, who stands over the game and says that's the right art package?

[27:37] That's the right animations.

[27:39] I just, I don't know.

[27:40] Am I being unfair?

[27:42] I feel like sometimes I say these things, but is nobody else feeling this stuff or are

[27:47] you feeling this?

[27:48] That's my whole thing.

[27:50] If you're going to go and make a pinball game, you just can't do it where like some of

[27:56] it's good and some of it's mediocre and survive in 2019.

[27:59] I mean, I saw some of the animations for Black Knight sort of rage and they look really

[28:04] cool.

[28:05] I mean, Stern's getting there.

[28:06] But again, even when people were praising the Black Knight animation, it was like this

[28:09] sort of like, wintry like, like figure.

[28:12] You know, it was like a, like a white walker king, right?

[28:15] Kind of figure I saw.

[28:16] Even when I see that, when I see the animations in Iron Maiden, these aren't,

[28:20] really great animations happening.

[28:23] I mean, they're not.

[28:24] And anyone who works in the animation field, anyone who works in the video game industry,

[28:30] anyone who works with mobile games, like as Joe Kamakawa, if he thinks these are great

[28:33] animations, they're not.

[28:35] These are not, these are, it's a real piss poor, it's real piss poor stuff.

[28:40] A lot of the animations we've been getting in pinball, but we look at the game like Deadpool

[28:44] more like, oh, wow, are you kidding me?

[28:48] It's like 16 bit.

[28:50] I know they're saying that's what they were doing intentionally and I get it.

[28:53] I totally get it.

[28:55] But, but man, it's like for this much money, I do think what we see on these screens and

[28:59] the animations on them should be far superior than what they are.

[29:03] And so that's all I'm going to say is this, I just wound in if I were American pinball,

[29:08] sort of defend this stuff.

[29:10] What I would be saying is this, look, there's far too much emphasis on the LCD.

[29:14] And we decided to put the majority of our money into the world under the glass.

[29:19] And I agree with that.

[29:20] And I have to say this, I have to say this.

[29:22] I think, look, as much as I think the animations on October fest are pretty piss poor, what

[29:27] I do like about it is this.

[29:29] I think what's on their screen, what's on their screen is very simple and it's easy to

[29:35] understand.

[29:36] And I think that is what's most important on a pinball LCD screen.

[29:41] I don't want there to be a ton of animations and movement.

[29:45] I don't want to be looking up at the LCD screen very much.

[29:48] And I do like that about the October fest LCD.

[29:51] I do like that one.

[29:52] I'm in a mode.

[29:53] I know exactly what mode I'm in, whether it's someone juggling, whether it's sort of tossing

[29:57] a ring onto a bottle, whether it's picking a beerstein, I'm never confused about what

[30:02] I'm looking at.

[30:04] And then I go to the Pirates of the Caribbean LCD and I'm like, what the fuck is this?

[30:08] What is on the screen?

[30:10] There's so much stuff.

[30:12] And I don't want a road map and I don't want to have to sit down with Keith for four

[30:15] hours to explain to me how to look at it.

[30:18] I don't want little X's everywhere.

[30:19] I don't want five different chapters everywhere.

[30:21] I don't want like all these different quadrants.

[30:22] I don't want like a huge map where I'm not sure what.

[30:24] No, I just want to see like a beerstein with points and I want to see what my competitors

[30:30] points are.

[30:31] And I want to be looking down at the game as much as possible.

[30:35] And I think that's why I love Batman because I think Lyman Sheet is the master of knowing

[30:40] just how much to put on the screen to keep it going.

[30:44] But for the majority of the time, you're looking down.

[30:46] And then when you want to look up in Batman, it's because the ball has stopped moving so

[30:51] you can enjoy what's on the screen.

[30:53] But it takes an art form to get that balance right.

[30:57] All right.

[30:58] What else do I want to talk about on this episode?

[30:59] Josh, if you're listening to this brother, come on the show.

[31:02] I mean, look, the invite is there.

[31:04] I think it would be a great talk.

[31:06] And again, I think you guys are doing a lot right.

[31:08] I think there's just a few things now that become the two do list for American Pimball.

[31:13] Get the art better and rethink the way you're using the screen.

[31:17] And I think American Pimball will hit it out of the park if they give us all these toys

[31:24] and all these mechs and unique designs and then get the theme right.

[31:27] Those three things, get your theme right, get your art right and get your animations right.

[31:32] And that's what you need to focus on.

[31:33] If I'm dovel and I'm normal, that's what I'm saying.

[31:36] But again, I just don't think they, I really, I just don't think they have the passion to drive it.

[31:42] I think they're more of like the business and the financial side of it.

[31:45] But I think they need someone who's got an eye for this.

[31:48] Do you think John Papaduc would ever let a game that looked like Houdini or Octobr Fesco out the door?

[31:55] Do you think he would?

[31:56] And here's what I think AP's biggest mistake was.

[31:58] They actually own the rights to Houdini, all of John's art, John's cabinet design.

[32:04] The biggest fail that American Pimball did is they let go of the most valuable assets they had.

[32:12] They let go of the Zidware cabinet design and John Papaduc's sort of Zidware vision

[32:19] for what a Pimball machine would look like.

[32:21] They had that.

[32:23] And instead of understanding how incredible John Papaduc's design was,

[32:28] it's, you know, when you look at his Houdini, I don't, I don't, don't worry about the shot layout.

[32:33] Instead of saying we should make our games look as sexy as the Zidware games.

[32:38] You know what they did?

[32:39] They brought in Joe.

[32:40] He scrapped everything John was about.

[32:43] They should have made their games with the screen under the glass like in Circus Voltaire.

[32:49] They should have made their cabinets, the steep looking cabinets with the John Papaduc design,

[32:53] with, you know, the entire back glass being artwork.

[32:57] They had it all.

[32:58] That was all them that they all, they had that all in house.

[33:01] They own that IP, that direction, that design scheme.

[33:05] And they should, that's, that's where the value was with John.

[33:09] Joe Ballsor should have came in and should have made John Papaduc's creative vision for Houdini work.

[33:16] Instead, they scrapped it all.

[33:18] And in doing so, I think they threw out the most valuable thing they had.

[33:23] And that was John Papaduc's vision for the way a beautiful and sexy Pimball machine could look in the modern day.

[33:30] And now you look at the cabinets.

[33:32] And that's the other thing I hear.

[33:32] The cabinet design on the AP machines.

[33:35] Look at those next to Zidware games.

[33:37] Tell me which one is sexier.

[33:39] Tell me which one would look better in your lineup.

[33:41] Tell me which one you would rather buy.

[33:43] I still would rather buy the Matt Andrews Houdini and the way that looked and the stylized version of it

[33:51] versus what American Pimball put out.

[33:53] And I remember Josh Kugler said this.

[33:55] He's like, well, we wanted to make it.

[33:56] We didn't, they didn't like the John Papaduc Houdini.

[33:59] They thought it was too cartoony and too like not realistic enough for Houdini.

[34:04] And so look at what we got in comparison.

[34:07] And I really do think you should go Google John Papaduc's Houdini and put it next to what actually came out.

[34:13] And see, that's the problem.

[34:15] Is you actually have like Josh Kugler saying, we don't think John Papaduc's design looked good enough.

[34:21] And we thought we could improve upon it.

[34:22] And I'm here to tell you, John Papaduc for all of his, you know, mishaps.

[34:27] He has more creative direction and more creativity when it comes to design than Joe does,

[34:33] than Josh does, than Nermal and Dovel does, and they threw it away.

[34:37] And what they should have done is they should have let John creatively design stuff for them,

[34:41] but they should have then built a team around him that could bring it to life in a way that worked.

[34:47] That's, that's, I mean, they had him.

[34:49] They had him.

[34:50] And I think we're going to see Robert Mueller and Deeproot take advantage of that.

[34:55] And I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Deeproot games have the screen below the glass.

[35:00] I wouldn't be surprised if Robert Mueller actually utilizes a lot of what John brought to the table

[35:06] and doesn't disregard it.

[35:08] Because that's the challenge with J-pop.

[35:10] Is he, yes, he does so much wrong.

[35:12] But when you harness what he does right, he does it really right.

[35:17] And he's so much better than almost everybody else in the industry

[35:21] at making games look fucking incredible and magical.

[35:24] And he, so you have to like, it's almost like you have to just like utilize the 20% of him

[35:29] that's actually really effective and disregard the 80% of him that's delusional

[35:34] and things he can make it on his own, right?

[35:35] And, and, and scrap the ideas that just will never work.

[35:38] An AP had it and they, they, they, they let it go.

[35:41] And they let it, and I'm not sure they've improved upon anything we've seen

[35:45] from a visual and artistic and creative standpoint that John Papadu gave them.

[35:49] All right.

[35:50] So speaking of Robert Mueller, then I'm a couple of things.

[35:53] Well, I want to close with this thing.

[35:54] So because we're in a space now where we're talking a lot about themes,

[35:58] I want to talk a little bit about what Robert shared with me in terms of getting a theme

[36:01] and getting a license.

[36:01] I think it's really interesting.

[36:03] But before I do that, I have to kind of bring up the most ridiculous item of the day.

[36:08] And that is that Barry, of Barry and Yopps,

[36:11] Dutch pinball, they are starting to sell

[36:15] bride of pinbott 2.0 kits again.

[36:18] So this was from yesterday.

[36:19] This was the email and it says, hi.

[36:21] Please let me know if you're still interested in buying a kit.

[36:25] We're taking orders right now for a new batch.

[36:28] The updated price is 2250.

[36:31] I think it's pounds or euros, including VatX shipping.

[36:35] Please let me know ASAP so we can start building a kit for you too.

[36:39] Thanks Barry.

[36:40] Holy shit.

[36:41] So like, what's going on?

[36:43] They're building bride of pinbott 2.0 kits again.

[36:46] Is this company dead or alive?

[36:47] Which one is it?

[36:48] What is happening?

[36:50] I don't know.

[36:51] I don't even want to speculate.

[36:52] I don't even want to go into the whole like alien is coming back.

[36:55] I keep hearing it's coming back.

[36:56] I mean, I know I took down those episodes.

[36:59] But if alien does come back, you best believe that episode is going right back up.

[37:03] All right, I'm going to close this episode.

[37:04] I went Robert Shed with me about licensing because I think it's really interesting.

[37:09] So he wrote the following and I'm going to paraphrase some of this.

[37:12] So he wrote, often you are told that the license isn't available period.

[37:18] It's not available.

[37:19] Back to the future, most video game titles, toy titles, Harry Potter, anything Christopher

[37:24] Nolan, or that it isn't available due to not being on the list.

[37:29] Studios push certain licenses from time to time.

[37:33] If the vault isn't on that list, you get told no.

[37:36] Example, karate kid, you are told that someone else has it even if you think they might be

[37:42] lying or someone else already got something similar and they won't license a derivative.

[37:48] Example, Beatles, Pulp Fiction, Godzilla.

[37:51] Sometimes, the vault title has multiple owners and trying to get the rights isn't worth it.

[37:57] Example, he-man, and space balls.

[38:00] Contracts were not standardized back then and studios often refuse to find it and figure

[38:05] out what can be licensed or not.

[38:08] Or in the above, the legal cost to do so or to shore up rights when compared to the minimum

[38:13] guarantee is not worth it to the studio.

[38:16] Being able to use video is hit or miss, as well as use of stills.

[38:22] Is it worth it to move forward with a $500,000 to a million dollar in development costs

[38:26] if you can't use the video scenes buyers expect or the cost of reproducing them with the

[38:32] Nazi creative approvals process worth it?

[38:35] Sometimes video is restricted as to only those clips with full rights of all actors in

[38:40] the scene.

[38:41] Most vault movies, most memorable scenes, don't always work like that.

[38:47] Video often must be chosen and approved prior to licensing.

[38:51] For example, you are told to pick clips before development has gotten far enough to pick

[38:56] clips.

[38:58] And that costs a lot of money to lock that down before a white would.

[39:02] Rules set or art is figured out.

[39:05] On the other hand, if you want weight to license until after the development, you've got

[39:09] 50K, 150K development that could be wasted if the license isn't granted.

[39:16] That's really interesting.

[39:17] That point there, you don't know if you're damned if you're doing it.

[39:21] Imagine designing a game like JAWS and you're like, okay, here's what we need.

[39:24] We need this.

[39:25] We're going to shoot the shark and the shark is going to blow up.

[39:28] Then you go and you realize you can't use that clip in which the shark blows up on the

[39:32] screen and then you're kind of fucked.

[39:35] That's really interesting.

[39:36] He goes on to say, most of the actors had

[39:39] time lapses in rights which makes using them impossible.

[39:44] The studios often refuse to renegotiate them just for you and they refuse to let you

[39:49] try to negotiate them on your own.

[39:52] When you do have to go after actors separately, you are forced into negotiating with agents

[39:56] who don't get pinball and don't care about anything other than maximizing their client's

[40:02] pocketbook.

[40:05] When you have to go after actors separately, MFN crap is almost always a non-negotiable which

[40:14] passes off the studio and blows the budget.

[40:17] I'm not sure what MFN is.

[40:19] That is what killed the big trouble deal.

[40:24] Nearly all music has to be licensed separately.

[40:27] Lastly, these studios and actors think a lot more of these vault titles than they're often

[40:32] worth to guarantee.

[40:33] Up front money or minimum guarantees are often way out of line with projected revenues

[40:45] and profits.

[40:46] A lot of these movies, the actors who are part of them and the studios, they think there

[40:54] were so much more money than they really are and that you wouldn't be able to make enough

[40:57] money or sell as many as you would need to justify the cost the studios would want you

[41:03] to pay them or the actors would want you to pay them for their likeness or their usage

[41:06] in the games.

[41:07] I think there's a lot of interesting stuff there.

[41:10] I was really appreciative of Robert of sharing that.

[41:13] We don't normally get let into what a company goes through when it comes to licensing and

[41:17] merchandising and trying to trademark and get assets for games.

[41:21] It's a devil's work.

[41:22] It is the devil's work.

[41:23] It is not fun.

[41:24] It is not enjoyable.

[41:25] I'm sure there are so many titles that we would love to see in pinball that just can't

[41:29] make it out there because there might just be one actor who won't go in on it.

[41:35] Imagine you have everyone lined up and I'm sure Kurt Russell and Kim Kertrell are just

[41:39] such, they're so expensive which wouldn't make doing a game like big trouble in little

[41:44] China worth it because how are you going to pay them all that money?

[41:48] It's still a very niche cult classic movie.

[41:51] It's not going to be worth it.

[41:55] It's a battleground too.

[41:56] The other part is like all these companies trying to battle it out behind the scenes.

[41:59] It's interesting too that he said if you secure one version of Godzilla or one version

[42:04] of Beatles that might preclude you from securing another version.

[42:08] If Stern has this like Beatles 1964, does that mean no one can do Beatles yellow submarine?

[42:14] If Jersey Jack does guns and roses, does that mean only one guns and roses pinball

[42:19] machine can be made?

[42:21] It really feels like a battleground.

[42:25] It feels like there's a lot of money at stake.

[42:28] It also feels like you have to make the right bet when it comes to what theme you license.

[42:34] It's so important to get it right because if you get it wrong and you spend a lot of money

[42:39] on a license and it doesn't pan out, you're going to lose a lot of money.

[42:43] I think we saw that with the Hobbit.

[42:46] I think we saw that.

[42:48] I think we didn't see that with Wizard of Oz.

[42:50] I think that is why Jack is going back to Warner Brothers and doing Wonka because Waz was

[42:54] such a success and I bet you.

[42:56] I bet you Wizard of Oz was much cheaper for him to do than the Hobbit was in terms

[43:02] of the license.

[43:05] I think if I were to pick one theme that I think someone should go figure out how to make

[43:10] it right, it's King Kong.

[43:12] How much King Kong cost?

[43:14] How much?

[43:15] Go after the old Black and White movie.

[43:17] Make King Kong somebody please.

[43:21] Please let it be Jersey Jack pinball or deep rude or someone who knows that I do it right.

[43:24] Imagine John Papadu designing a King Kong game with his crazy ideas in a deep root cabinet

[43:32] with a screen under the glass and incredible artwork that John would art direct.

[43:37] Imagine that.

[43:38] How cool would that be?

[43:39] Anyway, everybody.

[43:40] Thank you for tuning in.

[43:42] Tomorrow could be the day in which I tell you I have played Willy Wonka and I will give

[43:47] you as much as I can without spoiling the reveal of Jersey Jack pinball.

[43:50] Exciting week.

[43:51] Regardless, this game is going to be revealed next Friday at MGC.

[43:55] So get your checkbook ready because if this thing is hot, I think you're going to see

[43:58] Wonka's CE sell out like within a day.

[44:02] I really hope Jack has a day in which things sell out immediately for him.

[44:06] He deserves it.

[44:07] He does deserve it and I hope it's that great.

[44:09] Part of me is like, oh, fuck man.

[44:11] I hope if I get there and it's just a re-skin of the Hobbit layout, I'm going to be like,

[44:15] oh, fuck.

[44:16] No, it's not going to be that.

[44:17] I've been told they will never re-skin games at Jersey Jack, which is good news.

[44:21] Sorry to everyone.

[44:22] Have a great day and we might be talking to you tomorrow.

[44:25] Awesome.

[44:26] Later.

[44:51] I'm going to be like, oh, fuck.

[44:58] I'm going to be like, oh, fuck.
