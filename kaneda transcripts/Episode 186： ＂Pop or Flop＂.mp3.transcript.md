[00:00] And now the

[00:15] Welcome to episode 186 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[00:35] No, I have not gone away.

[00:36] I know we took a little bit of a break this week.

[00:39] I love that I got some emails from people being like, is everything alright?

[00:43] I sort of spoiled you guys with the level of cadence with this podcast doing about three

[00:48] to four a week.

[00:50] But I have to say this, there's really only one reason why I took out a delay this week

[00:56] because I've been super, super depressed this week and for only one reason and I'm going

[01:02] to say it, spoiler alert, if you are going to go see Star Wars you might want to close

[01:08] your ears right now but the reason I'm depressed is I thought the last Jedi was one of the worst

[01:15] movies of all time.

[01:18] Well, maybe not of all time but probably one of the worst Star Wars movies I have ever

[01:22] seen.

[01:23] And I'm so bummed out because I'm the biggest Star Wars fan and this movie challenges

[01:29] your intelligence like no other sci-fi movie I've ever seen.

[01:34] And the fact that Luke Skywalker, this is his like send off film, this is how they're

[01:40] ending the character of Luke Skywalker has made me so upset and mad.

[01:45] I went Thursday night to a double feature with a bunch of people from work, ten of us,

[01:51] all ten of us.

[01:52] We saw Force Awakens and then the last Jedi and we walked out of the last Jedi being like,

[01:58] what the fuck was that?

[02:01] What the hell did this director do?

[02:04] Even JJ Abrams teed up so nicely in the Force Awakens, this guy destroyed, destroyed

[02:11] and there's just so much that makes absolutely no sense.

[02:14] Okay, I'm not going to go into specifics.

[02:18] I'm not going to spoil the movie other than I thought it was horrible.

[02:22] If you disagree, email me at canadapimbal at gmail.com.

[02:26] So here's what we're going to do.

[02:28] We're going to do some news.

[02:30] We're going to do some listener feedback.

[02:34] We're going to talk about the industry and we're going to go manufacture by manufacture

[02:40] and just talk about what's going on in pinball.

[02:42] How's that sound?

[02:43] Okay.

[02:44] I want to start off with Batman 66.

[02:47] I want to tell you guys a quick update.

[02:49] The game is playing great.

[02:51] The game is playing great.

[02:53] I got to a point where I jailed all the villains and I didn't realize how to activate villain

[02:59] escape mode.

[03:01] Awesome, awesome game.

[03:02] It's so much fun putting up 1.2 billion points.

[03:06] I think the game is awesome.

[03:07] I'm having no issues with it.

[03:09] I just put a piece of PDI glass into the machine and I had to say I had the stern anti-glare

[03:17] glass and then I put the PDI glass in.

[03:21] There's no comparison really.

[03:23] The stern glass is all right.

[03:26] It's all right.

[03:27] It's convenient.

[03:28] But the PDI glass is just so much better.

[03:31] I basically had one sheet of PDI glass that was in my toe-din so I put my stern glass

[03:37] into my toe-din and there we are.

[03:40] Batman is now.

[03:41] I'm done.

[03:42] I'm done modding this thing.

[03:43] I think I've got everything you can possibly put into the game that it needs and now it's

[03:47] just enjoyment.

[03:48] It's pure enjoyment.

[03:49] I'm loving the game and I think those of you out there are also loving the game.

[03:54] Okay.

[03:55] I'll say this.

[03:56] There's one shot in Batman.

[03:58] There's one shot that is the difficult shot for me to hit and that is the right orbit

[04:04] shot.

[04:05] The right orbit shot is underneath the penguin crane and maybe it's because the penguin

[04:10] crane blocks the view of that shot.

[04:13] The only way I can consistently hit that shot is if I cradle the ball with the left flipper

[04:19] and I sort of lean over the machine and I'm sort of like my head is just a few inches

[04:24] above the glass and I'm sort of I have to look at the clear path of that shot and that's

[04:30] when I can hit it pretty consistently but I can never seem to time it right if I'm just

[04:36] standing over the machine normally and that's a problem.

[04:40] It's a problem for me because that's what starts multiple.

[04:44] I want to give a thanks and a shout out to someone who helped me figure out how to fix

[04:50] the vertical upkick in the upper right corner of the game.

[04:53] I was having a problem where the ball was getting hung up there and canada pinball podcast

[05:00] listener.

[05:01] I want to call him out by name.

[05:04] Sorry, I'm like in my other email right now.

[05:06] I want to say thank you so much to to Shiler Lane who said he was having a similar problem

[05:15] with someone that had the game and that the answer was to take a piece of dead bounce

[05:21] foam and stick it in the metal scoop.

[05:23] So basically behind the vertical upkick there's like a metal scoop sort of like an L shape

[05:30] bracket that's there and I just put a bunch of that dead bounce foam and put enough to

[05:36] the point where now the ball bounces onto the vertical upkick every time.

[05:41] So I'm no longer getting it hung up there.

[05:43] The only place that I'm still getting a ball hang up on this machine is the bad cave.

[05:50] Sometimes when the bad cave spins it's not completely level and the ball gets hung up

[05:55] behind the bad cave.

[05:56] I don't know what to do with that.

[05:58] If you fix that problem with your Batman 66 let me know.

[06:02] The last thing I'll say about Batman 66 and then I'll move on.

[06:07] How do you adjust the treble and the bass with the game?

[06:12] I have a super Ellie and I'm not sure if there's any way to adjust the speakers in the

[06:17] machine.

[06:18] If you know how to do that can you please email me at canadapimball at gmail.com.

[06:25] You see these like simple questions I have I just can't I can't get quick answers because

[06:30] this is where like a place like Pinside is great for people to help out.

[06:34] Thank you for banning me for life Pinside.

[06:37] I appreciate it.

[06:39] Okay.

[06:40] So what's going on in this hobby of Pimball?

[06:42] Is this hobby of ours?

[06:43] Let's go down a list of my episode 186 news.

[06:49] So Stern has released new code for Guardians of the Galaxy and they are on code 0.80 and

[06:58] it's a pretty significant code updated.

[07:00] Looks like there's a lot of callouts that are being added.

[07:03] A lot of other features being added to the game.

[07:06] I don't really know how it plays because if you go into the Guardians threat it's

[07:12] kind of crickets right now.

[07:15] And is it too early and this is just a question for you guys out there.

[07:19] Is it too early to put a fork in this game?

[07:23] And I've been thinking about this for the last week is the Guardians of the Galaxy launch

[07:28] to me has just landed with absolutely no impact or no oomph.

[07:35] And this game isn't captivating people's imagination and I don't feel like people are

[07:40] going to run to buy this game.

[07:42] I really don't.

[07:44] And it's nothing against the beautiful artwork that Christopher Franci did.

[07:48] But I think there's just something about this game that just isn't clicking with people.

[07:53] It just isn't making people say I have to go buy that game.

[07:58] Maybe it's because the layout is very similar to Metallica and Iron Man.

[08:03] Maybe it's because they launched it with such shitty code and this was like the final

[08:08] straw for people.

[08:09] They're just not going to be stern beta testers anymore.

[08:13] They just don't they they'll just wait to see if the game is any good.

[08:18] Maybe people are not rushing to buy this game because there's really nothing that's special

[08:22] about the limited edition right.

[08:24] They don't give you anything that's truly truly limited that you're going to want.

[08:30] It's everything that is on there you can easily put on a premium.

[08:34] But I think the real reasons Guardians of the Galaxy is kind of just I don't know for

[08:40] me it's falling into that kind of Game of Thrones bucket.

[08:43] You know, Stern's got their A titles that people run to and everyone has to own and this

[08:49] is sort of like that middle ground where I don't think it's ever going to be the game

[08:55] people talk about.

[08:56] Right.

[08:57] I mean how many people even talk about Game of Thrones anymore?

[09:01] How many people talk about playing that game the experience of owning it?

[09:04] They don't.

[09:06] And they're because Stern releases so many games there's like this really small window

[09:11] to create that hype that makes people want to go run and buy the machine.

[09:16] I think the real reason that Guardians is just like this miss.

[09:22] Partially partially because I just don't think it's a theme that speaks well to the pinball

[09:27] buyer to the pinball collector.

[09:29] I don't.

[09:30] I think this is kind of like one of those themes that people are a little lukewarm about.

[09:37] The movies are good.

[09:38] The movies are definitely good.

[09:39] But this isn't like I have to own this machine for the buyer of pinball.

[09:43] You know, the mail in his 40s, 50s and 60s.

[09:48] I don't think this is the one.

[09:50] I also think Stern has done a really bad job at containing the rumors of what's coming

[09:57] next.

[09:58] People, we're going to talk a little bit about that later on in this podcast.

[10:02] But because people know there's so much coming and not just even from Stern, right?

[10:07] From the other competitors out there, it's kind of like, I don't really want to spend

[10:14] $7,000 right now on a game that's not complete.

[10:21] With a theme I'm not fully in love with, I might as well just wait.

[10:26] And I think what's happening now is something that's, you know, was bound to happen because

[10:32] there's oversaturation in the market.

[10:35] A game is either going to be a hit or it's going to be a total miss.

[10:39] I really don't think there's much room anymore for like, you know, an average launch.

[10:45] I think things are going to either pop or flop.

[10:49] And that's, I'm going to call this podcast pop or flop.

[10:52] And it sounds kind of weird, but I think that's where we're at.

[10:56] Is you're either going to have a hit or a miss.

[10:59] Something's going to pop or it's going to flop.

[11:01] And I want to go down some of the manufacturers and sort of, you know, sort of give my opinions

[11:06] about how I think their titles will do as we go into 2018.

[11:11] But I think Guardians of the Galaxy is going to be a little bit of a flop.

[11:15] And I, you know, I think it's because it's only the first movie.

[11:20] I think the LCD integration is kind of weird.

[11:23] I think the voice actors is kind of strange.

[11:25] I think the layout has been seen before.

[11:28] You know, I just, I just don't think it's there.

[11:31] And I don't know if you're like me, but here's, here's my overall assessment of Guardians

[11:35] and Star Wars.

[11:37] If Stern had just combined the elements of each machine into one machine, that would have

[11:43] been a hit.

[11:44] I, I think people who have Star Wars, wish they had more like the magnets and some of

[11:49] the other stuff in Guardians and Guardians people, which the game had, you know, maybe

[11:54] more of the flow or maybe more of like the, you know, the integration of the theme, the

[11:59] way Bat with Star Wars does, right?

[12:01] Star Wars has got all the original actors.

[12:03] I don't know.

[12:04] Both of them seem to be like these compromising pens.

[12:06] And I think, you know, at the end of the day, people are probably having more fun though

[12:11] with Star Wars right now.

[12:12] And I've been reading the forum.

[12:13] And you know, I've sort of removed myself from my personal opinion.

[12:18] But, but Star Wars seems to be the one that people are enjoying more.

[12:21] Maybe it's too early to call it, call it a day with Game of Thrones, or Game of Thrones

[12:25] Guardians of the Galaxy.

[12:27] Is it too early?

[12:28] I don't think so.

[12:29] I don't think this game is going to have a second life.

[12:31] I really don't because I think Stern's going to show something new in a couple months.

[12:36] And I think this is going to be the one that just came out at a weird time.

[12:40] They didn't show it at Expo.

[12:42] It never really had the right launch.

[12:45] They fumbled the early release of the game with the bad code.

[12:50] And I think it's hard to climb out of a bad launch now when it comes to Pimbal.

[12:54] I really do.

[12:56] So we'll see what happens.

[12:58] We'll see what happens.

[13:00] Speaking of Stern and I keep saying Game of Thrones, the color DMD is now available for

[13:05] Game of Thrones.

[13:07] Who cares?

[13:08] Right?

[13:09] It's like, cool.

[13:10] The ugliest Pimbal machine of all time look a little bit better with dots.

[13:16] Color DMD to me now.

[13:18] They're great.

[13:19] Don't get me wrong.

[13:20] When I put a color DMD in my lower the range, they looked amazing.

[13:24] But dots can't hold the candle to the new LCD systems in the Stern games.

[13:30] It can hold a candle to what's going on with Houdini.

[13:33] Definitely not with what's going on with Jersey Jack or Highways screen.

[13:37] I mean, LCD is just better.

[13:38] I think companies are struggling finding the right size.

[13:41] I think Stern size and Houdini size is the right way to go.

[13:45] I think that Jersey Jack is probably too big and the aliens is definitely, you know,

[13:49] also too big.

[13:50] You can't look at that when you're playing.

[13:53] But I think Stern size is perfect.

[13:56] All right.

[13:57] What else is going on?

[13:58] So there is a new way.

[14:01] And this hobby has produced many of these things.

[14:03] But there is now a new way for you not to get laid in the world.

[14:08] What I mean by that, a pinball generates many ways not to get laid.

[14:14] Like if you go into a bar and start talking about how the scoop eject is setting the ball

[14:20] straight down the middle, you're never going to go straight down the middle with a woman.

[14:24] Like you're just not going to get laid.

[14:26] So the new reason or the new, the new pinball thing that will never get you laid

[14:31] is if you put on your collector's edition dialed in jacket.

[14:37] That is now shipping to the 150 dialed in collector's edition owners.

[14:44] We got to see Richie Rension is jacket with his nice skinny legs.

[14:49] Look, $12,500 for dialed in collector's edition.

[14:55] It's funny when you finally get to see the actual items that were part of that package

[15:02] to justify the price.

[15:03] I've said it before, I don't think all 150 shipped.

[15:08] Someone should create on pin side a thread or maybe do it within the dialed in collector's

[15:15] edition thread.

[15:16] But it would be great if people would actually count who's got what number.

[15:20] Remember when people did this for aliens, they were writing down, I've got number this,

[15:25] number that, number that.

[15:26] And then everyone ended up getting nothing.

[15:28] But it would be interesting to see how many actual collector's editions went out to

[15:33] consumers.

[15:34] Because maybe it's in Jack's best interest to say, hey, we only made 75 and now your game

[15:38] is rare.

[15:40] I don't think collector's edition dialed in will ever, ever be worth much simply because

[15:45] the game looks too similar.

[15:47] And Jack learned the lesson, the artwork is all the same.

[15:50] He needed to change more in the game and not enough was changed.

[15:53] And the top is not even that special.

[15:56] But for those guys who have it, they probably enjoy it.

[16:00] You have to just be a Pat Lawler, fanatic to go in on that game.

[16:05] Let's see, we're going to talk about J.J.P. in a little bit.

[16:09] I want to talk about highway.

[16:11] Because highway pimbal has finally showed what a version of the alien pimbal, Ellie

[16:20] game is going to look like.

[16:21] On their Facebook page, they showed the Ellie with the blue trim and they had the art

[16:29] package on it.

[16:31] And so now we finally, finally, finally get to see after all these months, after all these

[16:37] years, what the Ellie version of alien pimbal will be.

[16:42] And I want to give my thoughts on it.

[16:44] So I don't know about you.

[16:48] This is only my personal opinion.

[16:50] But I think that blue armor, that bright blue, almost like smurf Bugatti blue, looks

[16:58] terrible on black.

[17:00] It's not even the dark blue from the alien franchise.

[17:06] It's so mind-boggling to me that they continue to go down this road of making the game look

[17:14] worse.

[17:16] Alien is a dark theme.

[17:18] It is a very dark theme.

[17:20] It is not meant to have a bright color that pops.

[17:24] I'm sorry.

[17:25] Even the green looks bad on that machine.

[17:31] We know because was it Eric Katz, my boy down there in Florida, he painted his green.

[17:36] It doesn't look good.

[17:39] It just doesn't.

[17:40] And maybe it's because of the way the different parts on the highway machine are.

[17:45] You've got to paint that, the metal around the flipper bud.

[17:49] You've got to paint the metal around the shooter rod.

[17:53] And on the other side with the start button, it just looks bad.

[17:57] Astetically, it looks really bad.

[18:01] And the one thing I just don't understand for the life of me is why can't highway pinball

[18:06] ever, ever paint the screws, the same color as the armor that is beneath it.

[18:16] Still these cheap silver screws that stand out like a sore thumb.

[18:20] So that, I mean, look, it's all subjective.

[18:23] You might like it.

[18:24] You might get excited by it.

[18:26] I think it looks kind of hideous.

[18:28] And I'm just going to say it.

[18:29] I think it looks hideous.

[18:31] I think they should just offer the LE in a really nice glossy black.

[18:37] And call it a day.

[18:38] It looks best in black.

[18:41] Why are they offering three different armor trims?

[18:46] Again, it shows that they haven't learned a lesson.

[18:49] It's so much harder now when you build these games to have to like go like, you know, fulfill

[18:56] customer orders on three different colors of trim.

[19:00] Because then you have to wait to order the trim based upon the actual customer orders.

[19:06] If you were making 500 LEDs and they were all glossy black, then you could just order

[19:10] the glossy black, trim, make your 500 LEDs and ship them to distributors and get people

[19:14] their games and be done.

[19:16] It's faster.

[19:17] It's faster.

[19:18] The other interesting part, if you look closely at their machine, they have, they have

[19:25] scrapped the amazing artwork that Brian Allen did.

[19:30] The artwork that is on the machine now, the LE artwork in the back box area.

[19:35] And it's hard to see this because the stupid screen blocks the entire art package.

[19:40] They have now gone with Orrick Lawson's LE Backglass and not Brian Allen's.

[19:46] Now you should ask yourself, why do they do this?

[19:49] And I think this is another just example of how Andrew Highway lied to us.

[19:56] Why wouldn't they use the Brian Allen artwork that is so much nicer?

[20:00] This guy's amazing artist.

[20:01] It's so much nicer than Orrick's Backglass.

[20:04] Why didn't they go with it?

[20:06] Here's why, because Andrew Highway lied about Fox approving it for the game.

[20:13] They never approved it.

[20:15] And because of that, the new management probably didn't have the rights to use it and didn't

[20:20] want to wait and submit it and have to go through that whole process again.

[20:24] So you're getting the old artwork.

[20:27] You're not getting the better artwork.

[20:29] And it's kind of weird, right?

[20:30] Because Brian Allen sold people all these prints of, here's the alien LE Backglass.

[20:36] But mentioning my friend Mr. Katz down there in Florida, now he has the only Brian Allen

[20:44] Backglass alien LE in the world.

[20:47] And he asked me, Chris, what do you think that's worth?

[20:51] And I said to him, nothing.

[20:54] Nobody cares.

[20:55] No, I mean, it's probably worth something, but it's just this whole thing continues to

[21:00] be a boondoggle.

[21:03] If you look at the Facebook posts where they show the machine, read the comments in that

[21:07] post.

[21:08] There's still a ton of people asking for refunds, wondering where their game is, wondering

[21:13] why they're not getting their emails responded to.

[21:16] And so look, I know we talk about this all the time, but these guys have to get games out.

[21:24] Now I know I heard from Coin Takeer this week a bunch of games arrived and went out.

[21:28] And that's great.

[21:29] That is great.

[21:30] Games need to go out.

[21:32] When you read 10 side, the game's going out.

[21:36] They're still having issues.

[21:39] And maybe it's not a ton of issues, but there are a lot of issues that are plaguing this

[21:42] game.

[21:43] Lightboards going out, problems with the Zeno head.

[21:46] And the big apologists, Mr. Hilton himself.

[21:50] If you read the thread, it's amazing.

[21:52] Because he's always like, oh yeah, when you open up a new inbox, it's totally normal

[21:56] that you have to change 18 million things on a game to dial it in.

[22:00] And that's totally normal.

[22:01] That's totally normal.

[22:02] Like, it's like, no bro, stop, stop it.

[22:07] This company had so many more months to fix a lot of these issues.

[22:11] And I think the reality is setting in that quality control is going to be a huge issue with

[22:18] this game.

[22:19] And it's, you're just rolling the dice.

[22:21] You're rolling the dice.

[22:22] And so I hope people get their games.

[22:25] But I continue to say that I think Alien Pimball, Miss, Miss is, is, is, is a day late in a

[22:31] dollar short.

[22:32] It, it, it is just not worth it anymore.

[22:35] The amount of like holding on people are doing.

[22:39] And I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this, when you look at what's coming out next year,

[22:44] these guys are done.

[22:45] They're so done.

[22:46] They're so much coming out.

[22:49] There's so many companies that have amazing Pimball machines.

[22:52] They have their shit together.

[22:54] And they're not named after a dude that completely like drove a company into the ground.

[22:59] And they're not named after a dude whose innovations in Pimball all proved to be failures.

[23:05] So keep going, highway Pimball.

[23:08] You're running on fumes.

[23:10] And I don't get these guys more than like six months.

[23:13] And we'll talk more about this when my year in prediction show with Ryan and Marty.

[23:16] But I think these guys are not going to make it in the long term.

[23:21] But that's just my opinion.

[23:22] They proved me wrong.

[23:24] Cool.

[23:25] I'm not a buyer though.

[23:26] All right.

[23:27] What else is going on?

[23:28] What else is going on?

[23:29] So I also heard the last point about Alien is when you're an ambush multi-ball.

[23:35] Okay.

[23:36] So in the game you collect weapons.

[23:37] You can collect up to five weapons, I think.

[23:40] And one of the owners said when I start ambush multi-ball, I can't tell which weapon I'm

[23:45] using, which is really frustrating.

[23:47] And he says you would think because there are three screens in the game that one of those

[23:51] screens could be used to communicate to the player what weapon they're currently using.

[23:58] And the perfect screen for that would be the screen to the left of the xenomorph head.

[24:03] And Orrick Lawson chimed it and said that is exactly what we intended to be on that screen.

[24:09] But nobody's programmed it.

[24:11] Nobody's coded it.

[24:14] He's still bitter because he didn't get his game.

[24:15] I still can't believe they haven't sent Orrick his game.

[24:18] I mean, I'm just still flabbergasted that this guy worked on the game.

[24:23] Like he made all the artwork get him the game.

[24:26] Like you have Canada on Orrick's side for I just don't understand this.

[24:33] Everyone should be emailing Highway Pimball to send Orrick Lawson his game.

[24:39] I come on.

[24:42] For Christmas, get him his game.

[24:44] All right.

[24:46] Let's move on.

[24:47] Jersey Jack Pimball.

[24:48] So Jersey Jack Pimball was Wizard of Oz has new code code 6.60.

[24:56] How the hell are these guys on code 6.6?

[24:59] When like Stern code is like completed around one, I don't understand this.

[25:04] Is it like it's like kind of weird, right?

[25:06] Is it just an arbitrary number point number code?

[25:11] I don't know.

[25:12] How do you how?

[25:13] It's like six times complete compared to a Stern code.

[25:16] But anyway, you know what has been out for years?

[25:19] This new code dropped.

[25:20] It's mostly to fix some lighting issues.

[25:23] Maybe I don't know, some call out issues.

[25:25] But for the most part, if you have a waz, go update it.

[25:29] Dialed in.

[25:30] I've been reading about dialed in.

[25:32] And this is kind of funny.

[25:34] This is like the irony of dialed in.

[25:37] Is a lot of people are having a really hard time dialing the game in.

[25:42] And by that, I mean, they're having a hard time setting up the game so that the game plays

[25:47] right.

[25:48] And I don't think I've seen a thread where more people are trying to figure out how

[25:52] to level a game so that the ball returns to the flipper and not straight down the middle

[25:57] when it's coming out of certain parts of the play field.

[26:01] And people are saying, well, Pat Lawler intended the casters to be all the way screwed in on

[26:08] the front of the machine and the machine to sit flat on the floor.

[26:13] But then people chime in and they're like, well, yeah, but does Pat Lawler not realize

[26:18] that floors aren't usually completely flat?

[26:21] So if you do that, the machine casters might be in the same position, but the machine

[26:27] will be crooked because of the flooring.

[26:30] Of course, setting up a pinball machine is not always the simplest thing in getting the

[26:37] balance right so that the ball doesn't cheaply drain on you is something that's important.

[26:45] Right?

[26:46] What I've never understood is this.

[26:47] I've never understood why anyone would design a pinball machine.

[26:51] The level where the games like the games level has to be so precise or else the ball drains

[26:59] cheaply all the time.

[27:01] Like why?

[27:02] Like why do you have to make it that precise?

[27:06] I mean, you got this big, you got a big ball bouncing around a play field that has so

[27:13] many different pathways and trajectories and all it has to do is hit between two

[27:21] flippers and not go into that big hole in the middle.

[27:25] But there's way more flipper surface area than the hole in the middle and you can't design

[27:29] it so that it just returns to the flipper.

[27:33] So look, I don't know what to tell you.

[27:35] I think everyone's homes are different.

[27:38] Everyone's flooring is different.

[27:40] Everyone's games are different, right?

[27:44] When you're even like screwing a game in, it's probably impossible to make sure every

[27:47] single dialed in scoop is facing exactly in the same direction.

[27:52] I mean, there might be times where one person's scoop might be a little bit off and needs

[27:56] to be adjusted.

[27:57] But here's the thing, that's just pinball.

[28:00] Pinball requires adjustment.

[28:03] My Batman, I don't really, you know, I don't have any cheap drains.

[28:06] The only thing on Batman that I'll say is like what?

[28:10] The slingshots are so strong that the ball gets caught in them and it just fires it into

[28:15] the left out lane.

[28:16] Like fires it straight across.

[28:18] Like almost it's brutal when you get caught in the slings.

[28:22] And so what can you do as a player?

[28:24] You can, I lowered the slingshot power a little bit from like 32 to 28.

[28:30] But I'm tempted to move that left pose to the bottom position on the out lane because

[28:36] even in the middle position, it doesn't do anything.

[28:39] I still feel like the ball doesn't even come close to touching it.

[28:42] And I always like just setting up a game to be fun in a home environment.

[28:45] This isn't, there's no tournament going on in my home every day.

[28:50] All right.

[28:51] So we'll see if people can get their dialed in's dialed in.

[28:55] What do you guys think dialed in sales are like right now?

[28:59] And I've been wondering this.

[29:01] Do you think sales have started to like fall off after they showed pirates of the Caribbean?

[29:07] I'm not sure.

[29:08] I'm not sure.

[29:10] How many total dialed in's do you think Jersey Jack is sold?

[29:14] I'd love to hear from you guys on this because what is a successful Jersey Jack machine do

[29:20] in terms of numbers?

[29:22] Stern doesn't talk numbers.

[29:25] We always speculate that a successful machine in 2017 might be what?

[29:32] Like 5,000 total sold?

[29:35] 3,500?

[29:36] It's hard to tell, right?

[29:37] Because success, in terms of how much did it cost you to make the game?

[29:42] How much was the license for the game?

[29:45] And then that will, you know, the build the materials and then that will determine how

[29:50] many you need to sell to make a profit.

[29:53] Do you think they sold a thousand dialed in's?

[29:57] Do you think they sold more?

[29:59] Email me at canadapimbaladgmail.com.

[30:01] I would love to hear what you guys think.

[30:04] If I had a guess, I mean, I can't imagine.

[30:08] It's hard for me to imagine that this game is outselling a license theme.

[30:16] It's hard to imagine.

[30:17] I don't even know if it's outselling the hobbit.

[30:20] And I'll explain why because outside of your diehards on pin-side, you need to get into

[30:27] like, you know, to get to that period where you're selling thousands of pinball machines,

[30:32] you need to sell through distributors and you need to sell to more of the casual buyer

[30:38] who's not, you know, the hyper like, pin-side user, the guy who might not know exactly who

[30:44] Pat Loller is.

[30:46] And I'm just not sure if a guy who walks into a pinball distributor showroom and sees a

[30:52] bunch of pinball machines lined up, he's going to say, you know what, I'm going to pass

[30:57] on Ghostbusters or Batman or Star Wars and I'm going to go with dialed in.

[31:03] I think it's hard to, it's such a good game and I think the theme, I don't know, I don't

[31:09] know how many units are going to sell.

[31:12] And I have to imagine that announcing pirates so early and pirates getting such a positive

[31:18] reception has to put, has to put a dent in dialed in sales.

[31:25] But I'm going to talk maybe a little bit later about even the marketing around pirates

[31:29] the Caribbean being the next theme with what's coming out.

[31:33] I don't know, I don't know.

[31:35] American pinball, what's going on over an American pinball?

[31:39] American pinball is close to production, we keep hearing their close.

[31:43] We kept hearing games we're going to ship in December.

[31:46] You know, the problem now is, it's December 16th.

[31:49] I mean, next week is pretty much the holidays.

[31:53] You know, everything starts to shut down like a week from now.

[31:57] No games have gone out yet.

[31:59] And what's the deal?

[32:01] What's the latest?

[32:02] We know there is one on location at level 257.

[32:06] There is a great, there is a terrific Houdini review by this week in pinball.

[32:15] So if you want to know all there is to know about this game, go to this week in pinball

[32:19] and read all about Houdini.

[32:23] Now there's something else you should do.

[32:25] And I want everyone who listens to this podcast to please do this for me.

[32:30] Please do this.

[32:31] We might not win, we might not win.

[32:34] And this might not be your favorite pinball podcast.

[32:38] But this week in pinball is doing an annual award show.

[32:43] And one of the categories they have is the best pinball podcast.

[32:48] And we all know that this isn't that show.

[32:51] But I would really appreciate it if you would, if you do enjoy this show, if you would

[32:57] vote for a Canadian pinball podcast on this week in pinball.

[33:01] So if you go to thisweekinpinball.com, there is scroll down, there is a section for it,

[33:05] they're called the Trippie Awards.

[33:07] Please vote for a Canadian pinball podcast.

[33:09] Who knows, we might get like an honorable mention or something, right?

[33:13] I bet Nate Schivers wins and he's done like two podcasts in like a year.

[33:18] Oh my god.

[33:20] Anyway, so they've got this good review of who Dini.

[33:23] Now the thing with who Dini, I think it's ready, it's at the point now, we're on ready

[33:29] for who Dini to be reviewed by people who own it.

[33:32] I want to know if their thoughts are on the machine.

[33:35] I only have two concerns for who Dini.

[33:39] One is, and one continues to be how tight the shots are.

[33:44] Every time I see the play field, and I see sort of the, you know, when they take a shot

[33:51] from sort of like if you put your camera on the lockdown bar and you took a shot of what

[33:56] the ball's perspective is as it's going up the play field, those shots are so tight.

[34:02] They're tight to begin with, and then there's targets that surround each shot which makes

[34:09] them even tighter.

[34:11] And I get that if you don't hit the shot, you hit the target.

[34:15] The problem is that's not fun because the ball keeps breaking off of targets and coming

[34:21] back and you're not hitting the shot you want to.

[34:24] I never understand making a machine too tight.

[34:28] I never understand it.

[34:30] You know, I've got the super tight shot on Batman, the right orbit to lock multi balls.

[34:37] And you know, the problem with that shot is it's blocked by the penguin crane and I have

[34:42] to like lean over to get that shot.

[34:44] And it's difficult.

[34:45] It's tight.

[34:46] It's almost too tight.

[34:48] And if it was any tighter, it would make the game really frustrating.

[34:51] The same is true with Star Wars.

[34:54] I think you'll hear from people all the time.

[34:56] They made the death star shot way too tight.

[34:59] And because of that, it really hamper people's ability to beat the game or just blow up the

[35:07] death star.

[35:08] Like they made this thing that everyone wants to do really hard.

[35:12] And I don't think that's fun.

[35:14] I don't think it's rewarding if it's too frustrating.

[35:17] So will Houdini be too frustrating for people?

[35:20] That's yet to be seen.

[35:23] The other thing, and this is just subjective, is the art package.

[35:30] I'm just, there's something about like the steampunk and Houdini's face that just seems

[35:35] a little, I don't know.

[35:37] I like the rest of the art package around the machine.

[35:40] Not a big complaint.

[35:42] I still think the overall game looks good.

[35:44] And then when I look at the price, I'm like, Chris, shut the fuck up.

[35:46] This game is like fully featured.

[35:49] It comes with all this stuff.

[35:51] And there's no bullshit around L.E.'s and S.L.E.'s and collectors additions.

[35:56] For seven grand, I don't think you can beat Houdini.

[35:59] I mean, I'm not right now with what.

[36:05] But here's a challenge for these guys at American Pimball.

[36:09] It's production.

[36:11] And how many are they going to get out?

[36:14] And how long are people going to wait to get their machines?

[36:16] Now if you go on to American Pimball and you go to BioHoudini, it tells you a list of

[36:23] distributors.

[36:25] Here's where I think their problem is going to lie.

[36:27] They have like 20 distributors selling Houdini.

[36:31] And the problem with that, if you have 20 distributors and your production is going to start

[36:37] really, really slow, like you might only make maybe 10 games a week, 20 games a week to

[36:43] begin.

[36:45] If that, right?

[36:46] And look, we all know delays and issues happen when you actually go into mass production.

[36:50] This is the first Pimball machine they're ever going to make on an assembly line.

[36:54] You can't count magic, girl.

[36:56] That was a joke.

[36:58] But you have 20 distributors taking orders from people all over the country and in Canada

[37:04] probably.

[37:06] The problem then becomes it's like, how do you allocate?

[37:09] How do people know where they are on the list?

[37:12] And I think that could create a scenario where people are going to get impatient and distributors

[37:19] are not going to get games fast enough.

[37:21] And they need to start getting games out.

[37:23] And the reason why is we are heading into 2018, which is going to see, I think, some

[37:30] of the greatest Pimball in the last five years.

[37:33] I think the games coming out next year are going to really blow away the games that came

[37:37] out over the last couple years.

[37:40] I do.

[37:41] If the rumors are true, if what we're hearing is true, and from what I'm hearing in the

[37:46] rumor mill within some of the companies, you ain't seen nothing yet.

[37:49] You really haven't.

[37:50] I think you just start to see Stern waking up, Stern listening to more feedback, Stern getting

[37:57] great artists on board.

[37:59] You know, George Gomez, you're going to get to see more of Gomez's touches on games.

[38:04] Keith LWIN is going to be crushing it.

[38:06] I hear like, stuff is coming.

[38:09] Stuff is coming that is going to like be incredible.

[38:12] And because of that, because of that, the competition, the competition is going to be so stiff next

[38:20] year that it is just going to be like game over for people that don't have games coming

[38:24] out in volume.

[38:26] And if the games aren't rock solid, it's just going to be that simple.

[38:30] I would hate to be competing with Stern.

[38:34] That's all I'm going to say.

[38:36] I would hate it.

[38:37] Because, man, it's like, my next topic was, what is the next game from Stern?

[38:45] And you know, there's someone started that question on Pinside.

[38:48] And it's like, if you look at the, let's just go down the rumored titles of Next year for

[38:52] Stern.

[38:53] Okay?

[38:54] You've got Iron Maiden.

[38:57] You've got Deadpool.

[38:59] You've got Jurassic World.

[39:01] You've got Elvira.

[39:03] You've got Munsters.

[39:04] You've got Beatles.

[39:07] What else is there?

[39:08] I'm trying to think some of the Stern rumors in Bon Jovi.

[39:13] But even there, even there when you take those titles and those games, you know, it's, those

[39:20] are like some really big themes.

[39:23] And there are also some really fun themes.

[39:26] And when you look at the artist that they have working on this stuff and the designers,

[39:30] Christopher Franchi, it's Dirty Donny doing another game.

[39:34] Donny Yeti doing a bunch of games for them.

[39:37] He's been working hard over there.

[39:39] Gomez is going to start taking over for like stuff that Trudeau is working on.

[39:45] It's going to be in, in Avalanche of games coming out from Stern.

[39:52] And I don't even think that includes the next Kepowed title.

[39:56] And it's just how can you compete against these guys?

[39:58] Now look, I, the only people, the only one that can hurt Stern at this point is Stern

[40:02] themselves.

[40:04] Stern's quality, Stern's lack of code, Stern fumbling launches.

[40:08] That is the thing that is going to keep people from going in on some of these titles.

[40:13] But if you're launching a company against this, against this, I mean, you've got to, you've

[40:19] got to have a hit, right?

[40:21] You need to say that pops or it's going to flop.

[40:24] I'm going back to our podcast theme.

[40:26] Now is Houdini, Ken Houdini as a theme pop against Deadpool Jurassic World?

[40:34] Iron Maiden, Elvira, Monsters, Ken it.

[40:38] Ken it.

[40:39] Will it, when we talked to Josh Kugler, you know, he made it sound like they need to sell

[40:43] a lot of these, which is why they're putting so much into the machine.

[40:46] And I think that's great.

[40:48] But will it come down to just theme and theme alone?

[40:53] And because again, like I'm just not sure how well machines sell when the themes aren't

[41:01] amazing.

[41:02] You know, it's so hard.

[41:04] We're all just speculating.

[41:06] You know, you could then say like, well, what's better as a game dialed in or Houdini from

[41:13] a pure design standpoint?

[41:14] I would have to say Lawler's design is superior.

[41:18] But I would argue that Houdini is a more marketable theme than dialed in, right?

[41:25] So interesting, interesting.

[41:29] In terms of what I think the next turn is going to be, I would guess probably Deadpool,

[41:35] because the Deadpool movie is coming out in February, I would go Deadpool, then Iron Maiden,

[41:42] then Jurassic World, and then I would probably say Elvira's last monsters, you know, towards

[41:50] like Halloween expo time a year.

[41:52] How cool would it be if they came out with two like spooky themed kind of games?

[41:57] Obviously none of this is confirmed.

[41:59] Elvira was confirmed.

[42:02] Monsters was put up in some sort of sort of list of what game would you like to see next.

[42:09] But those are the ones we're hearing rumors about.

[42:11] So I'm not sure like none of those could come out.

[42:15] Some of those could come out.

[42:16] Who's designing them?

[42:17] Who's coding them?

[42:19] Nobody really knows.

[42:20] I mean, the real rumor is that Lyman is on Elvira.

[42:24] And you know, there are a lot of people out there now that keep telling me, I'll only

[42:28] buy a machine that Lyman does.

[42:30] I mean, that's, he's the only one that really knows how to do it right.

[42:35] I don't want to do Lonnie and play chess with Pimball anymore.

[42:40] So yeah, it's going to be a crazy year.

[42:45] There was another Pinside thread.

[42:47] I'm going to go back to marketing and themes in a second.

[42:49] But there was another Pinside thread that basically asked the question, who is the

[42:54] best Pimball artist?

[42:57] And they put up a bunch of Pimball artists that have worked on games over the decades.

[43:03] And I want to read them out.

[43:04] You got John Yousey.

[43:07] You got Gordon Morrison.

[43:10] You've got Greg Ferris, Kevin O'Connor, Dave Christensen, Paul Ferris, Doug Watson,

[43:16] Roy Parker, Margaret Hudson.

[43:19] Look, all these artists are good and have made great games.

[43:23] You know, who should be on this list?

[43:25] Jeremy Packer, Christopher Franchie, and Dirty Donnie.

[43:31] Because I'll tell you this.

[43:32] And Brian Allen even.

[43:35] I wish Brian Allen had a game.

[43:36] He needs one.

[43:37] I'll tell you this.

[43:38] Yeti, Franchie, Donnie.

[43:41] They blow all these guys out of the water.

[43:46] I mean, it's nothing against these guys, but the talent level that Stern has now in

[43:51] its art department is to be reckoned with.

[43:54] To be reckoned with.

[43:57] You are going to see nothing but the best Pimball art ever in the next few years ever.

[44:04] And that's super exciting.

[44:06] Super, super exciting.

[44:09] What else is going on?

[44:10] Anything else I want to talk about?

[44:12] The last point I want to make of this 186 sort of canadas return after six days off.

[44:17] You guys wanted it.

[44:18] You got it.

[44:20] I really think we're going to have an interesting 2018.

[44:26] And we're going to talk more about it in our prediction for our next year.

[44:30] But I think people are starting to realize, and I'm realizing this.

[44:34] You just can't keep running after every machine.

[44:37] They're too expensive.

[44:38] The games cost way too much, and if you don't find them satisfying, what is the point?

[44:44] Someone told me a story of a friend of theirs.

[44:47] They bought Guardians of the Galaxy, and they are selling it after two weeks later.

[44:53] And I literally was like, why the hell did he even buy it?

[44:58] Like did he play it?

[44:59] And the answer was no.

[45:00] He didn't play it.

[45:01] He got it.

[45:02] He didn't like it so he's selling it.

[45:04] And I just think it's ridiculous.

[45:06] But people are going to bring in these 300 pound machines, and then have to repackage

[45:12] them up.

[45:13] Why even buy it?

[45:15] And there's something inside some people out there that just they just have to open up

[45:21] a box.

[45:22] They just have to have that getting this of something new arriving.

[45:25] And then they get it.

[45:27] And the thrill of owning it expires in just a matter of days or weeks, and then they want

[45:35] to get rid of it.

[45:37] And there are so many pinball machines for sale that it's just getting to the point out.

[45:43] I think we're going to start to see another period where you just take another $1,000 or

[45:49] $2,000 off a lot of these recent machines.

[45:52] I think so many of those like Stern era machines, the X-Men's, this, that, everyone's

[45:58] though, everyone thinks like everything should be worth like $5,500, right?

[46:02] 5,000.

[46:03] You're going to start to see these machines dipping into like the $3,000 range.

[46:07] No one's going to want them at that price.

[46:09] No one's going to want them.

[46:10] There's just too many new machines that are available.

[46:13] And you know, it's, it's, it's, it's play the, play the pinball.

[46:18] Play the pinball.

[46:19] Make sure you love it.

[46:20] Make sure it's for you.

[46:22] And you'll have a much better experience.

[46:24] You know, people love total nuclear annihilation because they got to play it.

[46:28] They got to play it.

[46:29] You know, I, I think the people who bought TNA played it during its tour of different

[46:36] shows and they, they had fun playing it and then they ordered one.

[46:41] You know, if you're just going to, and now that there's a lot of good word of mouth, like

[46:45] maybe some people are buying it because of the good word of mouth, but I'm not really

[46:49] seeing any TNA is going up for sale a week later, two weeks later.

[46:54] And that's got to be a great sign for, for Scott and team.

[46:58] You know, it's, it's, it's a different unique layout and people are enjoying it.

[47:02] And that's how pinball should be.

[47:03] I mean, that's my new sort of approach.

[47:06] And speaking of for sale, I'll end this podcast by saying, I've got three things for sale

[47:12] right now.

[47:13] And I'm going to, I'm going to do something, you know, I wasn't going to do this, but

[47:17] my, my tails is for sale.

[47:19] I'm actually going to lower the price, like a holiday special in my tails.

[47:22] I know this thing will sell.

[47:23] It's beautiful.

[47:24] I went to see it today.

[47:25] I'm going to show you the features of underneath the game.

[47:27] So for you guys who, who want to see more of what Eddie did to the game, I've got more

[47:32] photos.

[47:33] I'm going to sell my tails of the rear, the tails of the Arabian Knights fully brass

[47:39] played it.

[47:40] Mike Chestnut brass played a job.

[47:43] It's got the color DMD, it's got the laser rific topper, it's got a CPR gold play field.

[47:49] It's got a new genie, it's got a new lamp, it's got everything you could want.

[47:53] It's got a brass played it coin door, which is 500 bucks by itself.

[47:57] There's probably three to four thousand dollars I have into this machine.

[48:01] And then with the work Eddie did to it, even more.

[48:06] I think a fair price, and this is a fair price.

[48:09] This isn't like, I'm giving you this price and come in low.

[48:12] I've had it for sale for 12,000, 10,000 dollars.

[48:15] I will send someone, someone will get one of the nicest, just playing tails.

[48:20] I mean, this is not a complete, hepp restored job.

[48:23] Like don't get me wrong.

[48:25] It's still, you know, there's still got some age in it.

[48:27] But all the major mechs have been gone over.

[48:30] All the boards have been resorted.

[48:32] Everything works on the game.

[48:33] Everything is beautiful.

[48:35] Nine thousand dollars.

[48:36] And even as it stood over today, asking nine thousand dollars for a tails in this condition

[48:43] feels like I'm giving it away.

[48:45] If a Guardians of the Galaxy, Ellie is nine thousand dollars.

[48:48] The belly William stuff is just so nice.

[48:52] I don't want to get rid of it.

[48:54] I just don't have room for it.

[48:56] The other thing I have for sale is I have two magic girl items.

[49:01] I alluded to this, but I'll let you know what they are.

[49:03] I have the magic girl.

[49:04] I have a new old stock play field for magic girl.

[49:09] I was lucky enough to get one when they were sort of getting rid of everything from American

[49:13] pinball.

[49:15] I have a new old stock magic girl play field.

[49:17] That is just absolutely gorgeous.

[49:19] It's actually up on eBay right now.

[49:21] I think I have it for like six thousand or four thousand dollars.

[49:25] Just whatever.

[49:26] How do you price a unicorn like that?

[49:28] There's no other ones have ever gone up for sale.

[49:32] I'm actually going to start an eBay auction for that magic girl play field on Sunday

[49:38] night.

[49:39] So look for that to go up on eBay.

[49:42] Magic girl play field new old stock.

[49:45] And then I also have the prototype translate from magic girl that Jeremy Packer auctioned

[49:52] off on eBay like a year ago.

[49:54] I have a letter of authenticity from Jeremy Packer on it that's really cool saying this

[49:59] is a one of one prototype magic girl.

[50:03] Translate.

[50:04] It's so much better than the translate John put in the machines with American pinball.

[50:08] The colors are much better like magic girls got like flesh tone.

[50:11] She's not purple looking.

[50:13] It's gorgeous.

[50:15] Gorgeous.

[50:16] And you know the reason I had these things is I was going to make my bedroom a shrine

[50:20] to magic girl and I started acquiring these really sort of rare sought after items.

[50:26] Now I don't need them.

[50:27] So if you are interested in them, look for them.

[50:30] You can also email me at canada pinballadgmail.com.

[50:35] That is it.

[50:36] That is it.

[50:37] I hope this tale finds an amazing home because it's just so nice and you do not see nice

[50:44] totans come up for sale very often.

[50:45] You just don't.

[50:47] And I think it's one of the smoothest flowing games.

[50:49] I still think it's J-pop's coolest game and it's got real magic in it.

[50:54] There's just the shooting star ball saves on the out lanes.

[50:58] I think the coolest freaking thing that I've ever seen in a pinball game.

[51:03] That's it.

[51:04] I'm going to go maybe see Star Wars again tonight.

[51:06] I'm trying to change my mind on it but I thought it sucked.

[51:10] Like so bad.

[51:13] Like what the f- I'm not going to spoil it but like it just, oh we have to- I'm going

[51:19] to talk about it more like a week from now.

[51:21] You all have one week statue of limitations to see the film and then I have to just rip

[51:26] on some of the scenes.

[51:28] That's episode 186.

[51:29] We'll talk to you real soon.
