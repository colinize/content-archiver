[00:00] It's my love, don't you forget.

[00:07] It's my love, and never run.

[00:15] CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA CELESA

[00:19] Aw, welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:22] Two shows in a row.

[00:24] I want to welcome Jason from the Pinball Party,

[00:27] our latest club member.

[00:29] We just set a new record, 721 subscribers.

[00:33] Everybody out there, bring a friend.

[00:35] Let's get to 800.

[00:37] It annoys everybody else out there.

[00:39] I wanted to just ask a little off the cuff question,

[00:42] and this is just gonna be a little bit

[00:43] of a tangent podcast from Canada.

[00:46] I want to ask a very simple question.

[00:48] Why does pinball need to grow so much, right?

[00:52] We've heard it all these years.

[00:53] I've been in this hobby for 10 years.

[00:55] You always hear the line, like,

[00:56] it's kind of like the excuse, we need to grow pinball.

[00:59] And you're like, okay, cool.

[01:00] Like, what does that really mean?

[01:02] Well, we need to bring more people in.

[01:05] Why?

[01:05] Why do we need to bring a lot more people in?

[01:08] Well, we need to create more passion and enthusiasm

[01:11] for the hobby we love.

[01:12] So I get it on that front,

[01:14] but I just go back to like 10 years ago.

[01:17] 10 years ago, there were Stale Stern Pinball.

[01:20] There was Jersey Jack.

[01:22] There was Dutch Pinball.

[01:23] There was Spooky Pinball.

[01:25] We had about like six pinball companies making games.

[01:29] Now we have 14 pinball companies in the mix.

[01:33] 10 years ago, the price of a game was much more affordable

[01:37] in relation to where things are today.

[01:39] And now things have gotten really expensive,

[01:42] even when you adjust for inflation.

[01:44] It's not crazy.

[01:46] I will say this, in some defense to the pinball companies,

[01:49] it's not as bad as you think.

[01:51] Like we can always harp and say,

[01:53] look, they've doubled the prices of these LEs.

[01:56] And yeah, they might have,

[01:58] but everybody out there knows

[01:59] that there is something called inflation.

[02:02] But I think a lot more people have come into the pinball

[02:05] hobby over the last 10 years.

[02:07] I don't think anybody would argue that point.

[02:09] But I wanna ask each and every one of you this.

[02:12] Is this a niche hobby, where at a certain point,

[02:16] if its target is to just grow,

[02:19] that this hobby might lose some of its enthusiasm with you,

[02:23] if the focus is primarily on growth.

[02:26] Cause think about it, bringing more people

[02:28] into the pinball hobby will do one thing.

[02:31] It will create more demand.

[02:33] Ostensibly, that is the case, right?

[02:34] If we grow more, we are gonna create more pinheads

[02:38] and they're gonna wanna buy more products.

[02:40] Now that is what Stern Pinball wants absolutely.

[02:43] Every single for-profit company wants growth.

[02:46] I mean, that is the job of the CFO.

[02:49] It is the job of the marketing department.

[02:52] We want to attract more people to our brand

[02:55] and to our products.

[02:57] And so over the last 10 years,

[02:59] I would say that Stern Pinball has done a great job

[03:02] in growing the amount of people on a global level

[03:05] that love pinball.

[03:07] There's been a lot of great efforts happening

[03:09] at the location and tournament levels

[03:11] with all these league nights

[03:12] and all this Stern Army activity.

[03:15] I've seen a lot more people come into this hobby

[03:17] over the last like five years, especially during COVID

[03:20] when everyone was stuck at home

[03:22] and didn't spend their money on vacations and other things.

[03:26] But now we're at a point, it's 2024

[03:29] and I'm just wondering, I just wanna ask you guys,

[03:31] where does pinball go from here?

[03:33] Is there gonna be continuous growth in pinball

[03:37] at these prices?

[03:39] As the world gets really expensive,

[03:41] are we gonna see people start to push back?

[03:44] And should we reach a point in pinball

[03:46] where it's not about growth anymore?

[03:48] We don't need to keep inviting more people into pinball

[03:51] because pinball will always be a very niche hobby.

[03:55] It is a subculture within a subculture.

[03:58] Like gaming is the much larger subculture

[04:01] and then pinball is a subculture within that.

[04:03] I would even argue it's maybe even a subculture

[04:06] within a subculture within a subculture

[04:08] because of what it is.

[04:10] I mean, this is not like a video game.

[04:12] This is a 400 pound box of blinking lights

[04:16] where there really hasn't been much innovation

[04:19] happening in pinball at all.

[04:21] Think about it, in 2024, a device that costs you

[04:25] $6,000 to $15,000, the majority of them

[04:29] are not even connected to the internet.

[04:31] Now, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing

[04:34] because I don't necessarily think pinball needs to be

[04:37] this overly connected device.

[04:39] I think what we all still wanna get

[04:42] is a modern version of what we love about pinball

[04:46] which is a world under glass.

[04:48] Here's my concern about the whole thing

[04:50] about we need to grow pinball

[04:52] and we hear it from the distributors.

[04:54] Of course, because if they grow pinball,

[04:57] they have more people to sell games to

[04:59] and if Stern grows pinball, same thing,

[05:01] more people to sell games to.

[05:02] I was just looking around at the business definition

[05:06] of why a company needs to keep growing

[05:08] and the reason I wanted to talk about this today

[05:10] is I wanna really address this rumor

[05:13] that is seemingly true.

[05:15] That Stern pinball has thousands of unsold games

[05:19] sitting new in box at a warehouse in Chicago.

[05:23] And if you think about it, let's just be like conservative.

[05:26] Let's just say on a conservative level,

[05:29] Stern pinball is making 600 pinball machines a week.

[05:33] That's 2600 games a month just from Stern pinball.

[05:38] Now, here's the part that gets kinda scary.

[05:41] If that's what they need to keep that line on

[05:43] in this huge factory of theirs,

[05:45] between cornerstone games,

[05:47] because cornerstone games are every four months,

[05:50] between cornerstone games,

[05:52] that means Stern pinball is putting 10,400 pinball machines

[05:58] into the world between cornerstones.

[06:02] So what happens when you have a game like John Wick

[06:05] that's not selling and you need to make like 600 games a week

[06:09] and you're gonna make them,

[06:10] they're just gonna keep making them

[06:12] and then between John Wick and your next cornerstone,

[06:15] you've got 10,000 more games that you're piling onto

[06:19] that warehouse that already has

[06:22] thousands of Stern machines unsold.

[06:25] And I'm a little bit worried that this is sort of like

[06:28] the real danger to our entire hobby.

[06:31] It just seems like Stern pinball is overproducing now

[06:34] and the demand is not there.

[06:37] And their desires to grow pinball

[06:39] have scaled them up to a level now.

[06:41] That's really not sustainable.

[06:43] And look, they obviously have a better line of sight

[06:46] to their business than I do.

[06:47] But when I look around this world

[06:49] and I see what's happening to the auto industry,

[06:52] to the luxury industry, to the food industry,

[06:55] every other industry that's scaled up big during COVID

[06:59] is now feeling it.

[07:00] And you're telling me that the one industry

[07:03] that's immune to all the market forces

[07:05] is the pinball industry.

[07:07] And I'm just here to tell you right now,

[07:09] as I'm buying a house right now

[07:11] and buying a few cars and paying for daycare

[07:13] and all this stuff, the last thing my money

[07:17] is gonna go to now is a pinball machine.

[07:19] And it's the easiest thing to cut,

[07:21] because I don't need it.

[07:22] I gotta get Brenda a car.

[07:24] I gotta get myself a car.

[07:26] I gotta get my kids educated.

[07:28] I gotta take my kids on vacation.

[07:30] Do I need another pinball machine?

[07:32] And many of you out there are probably saying

[07:34] the same thing.

[07:35] The other interesting thing about growth

[07:37] is that normally companies need to grow

[07:40] to stay ahead of the competition.

[07:42] So let me read for you on this great Reddit thread

[07:45] about the definition for company growth.

[07:49] And let's think about this through the lens of pinball

[07:52] and ask ourselves, is pinball a normal category or industry

[07:57] or does it operate outside of the normal rules of business?

[08:01] So in business, being dynamic and adaptable is the key.

[08:05] No market or technology is going to stay the same forever.

[08:10] Now that is true, but I would argue that pinball

[08:13] is not a product that really has innovated much

[08:18] over the last like 30 to 40 years.

[08:21] And I think we've actually gone in the wrong direction.

[08:23] We've taken a lot of the mechanical innovation out

[08:27] and we've replaced it with much cheaper stuff, right?

[08:31] We have, everybody knows this.

[08:32] Like look down at Elton John.

[08:35] There's not much in that game.

[08:37] Look down at John Wick, not much in that game.

[08:40] All right, this goes on to say,

[08:41] the items and services that your customers want

[08:44] can change on a whim.

[08:46] The things that your competition is offering will change.

[08:50] Sometimes disruptive technology will come along

[08:53] and completely alter your business model.

[08:56] When digital photography became the norm,

[08:59] the companies that were producing film

[09:01] had to either change everything or go broke.

[09:04] All right, well, good news for pinball companies is

[09:06] there's only one real way to do pinball.

[09:09] Nobody's found a better way to do it.

[09:12] Virtual pinball, no.

[09:14] No innovation will ever replicate the analog joy

[09:18] of what pinball has been for all these decades.

[09:20] So that's a good news for these companies, right?

[09:22] And it's also a reason why these pinball companies,

[09:24] I think, get somewhat lazy and are not that creative

[09:29] because they know no one's going to invent something

[09:32] that makes their way of making pinball obsolete.

[09:35] And I think that is one of the reasons

[09:38] why these companies truly have become a little bit lazy

[09:41] is they're not worried about that.

[09:43] They think if they just make pinball

[09:45] the way pinball has always been made,

[09:47] they will be successful and maybe so.

[09:49] All right, when planning a business high level strategy,

[09:52] you always want to be proactive, never reactive.

[09:56] All right, so do we feel that's true in pinball?

[09:59] Are all of these companies being proactive?

[10:01] I don't know, I really don't know, maybe.

[10:05] But I think what's happened recently in pinball

[10:07] is like Stern has tried to do some proactive moves,

[10:10] you know, like remaking more LEDs and anniversary additions

[10:14] and the reaction to some of the proactive moves

[10:17] by these companies has not been welcomed.

[10:20] All right, this article goes on to say,

[10:21] let's say that we are people in charge of Kodak

[10:24] in the 90s and the 2000s.

[10:26] We see the digital cameras are just hitting the market

[10:29] because of our expertise in the photography industry.

[10:32] We believe that film is going to become obsolete

[10:34] in the near future.

[10:35] It is time for us to make a change.

[10:37] If we've always been the same size,

[10:39] it means there is no extra money in our budget.

[10:42] In order to start researching

[10:44] and developing our own digital cameras,

[10:47] we are going to have to shrink down other departments

[10:50] to have extra money.

[10:51] Maybe we cut back on manufacturing or marketing

[10:54] or customer support.

[10:56] No matter what we do,

[10:57] we are going to have to lose some people

[10:59] or some market share or some quality.

[11:02] Now, what's interesting when you think about

[11:04] this application to Pimball,

[11:06] have we seen in modern Pimball times,

[11:10] these companies cut back on certain areas of the game

[11:14] so that they can make more money,

[11:16] generate more money to grow the company?

[11:19] Yes, we've seen them cut back significantly

[11:23] on the mechanical engineering stuff

[11:25] that used to go into Pimball machines.

[11:27] There's no doubt about it.

[11:29] If you put Adam's family next to John Wick

[11:33] and you look at both of those games

[11:35] and you say, hey, which company put more mechanical magic

[11:38] under the glass?

[11:39] It's Adam's family and that's it.

[11:41] It's like the main thing they've been cutting recently

[11:44] is the mechanical side of Pimball

[11:46] and they've been taking the money

[11:48] that they've been saving on that, especially Stern.

[11:50] And they've heavily invested it in Insider Connected

[11:54] and online capabilities.

[11:56] I mean, think about it.

[11:57] Stern is really the only company

[11:59] that's going all in on this Insider Connected.

[12:02] And I think when we see Spike 3,

[12:04] I don't think you're gonna see this

[12:06] like significant increase in the platform

[12:09] and the mechanical wow in a Spike 3 game.

[12:12] I think it's gonna be more about the internet connectivity.

[12:16] I think it's gonna be more about

[12:17] how it can drive the software of the game

[12:20] but not really improve the hardware of the Stern machine.

[12:24] And also the word that we don't talk about a lot

[12:26] on this podcast is quality.

[12:28] I keep hearing from a lot of people

[12:30] that these games coming out of the new Stern factory,

[12:33] that the quality is not as good as it used to be.

[12:37] So, maybe they're cutting back there.

[12:39] Do you really think if they're making 2,600 games a month,

[12:43] 10,000 games between cornerstones

[12:46] that each of those games is being properly tested,

[12:49] that they're looking over each of those games the right way?

[12:52] I highly doubt it, even though the prices are going up,

[12:56] the quality is seemingly going down.

[12:58] Few more paragraphs here.

[12:59] On the other hand, if we've been growing

[13:02] for the past few years, we have options.

[13:04] We can funnel that extra money into R&D.

[13:07] We can acquire another company

[13:09] that is already researching digital photography

[13:12] if our growth has been substantial.

[13:14] We can borrow money knowing that the future growth

[13:16] will outpace the interest of our loans.

[13:19] Overall, companies grow for the same reason

[13:21] that people grow their careers.

[13:23] They want more stuff and profit.

[13:25] They want to be better suited for emergencies

[13:28] and they want to have money on hand

[13:30] to take advantage of opportunities when they arrive.

[13:33] It makes total sense.

[13:34] And look, if you've been in this hobby for a while now,

[13:36] you've seen tremendous growth

[13:38] by some of these pinball companies.

[13:40] I mean, Stern Pinball has grown tremendously.

[13:42] Jersey Jack has seemingly remained sort of the same size.

[13:46] I don't think their output

[13:47] has changed significantly over the years.

[13:50] And also Jersey Jack,

[13:51] I mean, one of my big complaints about Jersey Jack

[13:53] is they kind of came in early on with a lot of innovation

[13:58] and they really haven't done much since other than lights.

[14:01] I mean, think about it.

[14:02] If you think about the early Jersey Jack games,

[14:04] they were loaded with mechanical stuff.

[14:07] They were beautiful.

[14:08] They had the big screen.

[14:10] They had all this stuff in their games.

[14:12] And now you look at a modern JJP game,

[14:15] the artwork is better.

[14:17] The lights are significantly better,

[14:19] but the mechanics are not better.

[14:21] So they've taken a step back

[14:22] on loading their games with mechanical wow,

[14:25] and they've sort of just relied on really cheap LED lights

[14:30] that is eye-popping, but much cheaper to make.

[14:32] And everybody knows that.

[14:33] And they haven't done any innovation whatsoever.

[14:36] This is kind of embarrassing for Jersey Jack.

[14:38] Zero innovation when it comes to online connectivity.

[14:42] In fact, they removed score bit from all of their games

[14:45] and they haven't replaced it with anything.

[14:47] It is really shocking to me

[14:49] that Jersey Jack has failed to invest properly

[14:52] in the software department

[14:54] and get their games better connected.

[14:56] Because I do believe if you think about Stern owners

[14:59] and Jersey Jack owners,

[15:00] they both have like occult following.

[15:03] Like they really have their die-hard fans

[15:06] and Stern does a great job of rewarding their die-hard fans

[15:10] with internet connected,

[15:12] whereas Jersey Jack pinball does not.

[15:15] And I think we're seeing that right now more so than ever,

[15:18] where if you buy a Stern machine,

[15:20] they're gonna constantly be dropping

[15:22] all of these achievements and these badges

[15:24] and just things for you to do

[15:27] that make your machine fun again every single month.

[15:30] Where Jersey Jack pinball,

[15:32] they launched their game with pretty much code complete.

[15:35] What you see is what you get.

[15:36] Then they don't polish the code at all.

[15:39] And then they have no other thing they do with those games

[15:41] for years while all of these owners

[15:44] are just getting bored of their games.

[15:45] And then they just wanna sell them

[15:47] because Jersey Jack has seemingly cut bait

[15:50] on the product they bought.

[15:51] I think that's why Stern's strategy of growth

[15:54] all has to do with internet connectivity,

[15:56] more than anything,

[15:57] because you gotta think about it like this.

[15:59] Imagine Stern has like a quarter million

[16:01] pinball machines out in the world.

[16:03] They probably have more,

[16:04] but let's just say they have 250,000 machines

[16:07] out there in the world,

[16:08] and all of those machines are internet connected.

[16:11] What's the fastest way for them to generate revenue?

[16:14] Simply connect all those machines

[16:16] and charge all of those owners a monthly subscription

[16:20] to do different things with those games.

[16:22] And there are micro transactions.

[16:23] And I'm here to tell you people, it's gonna work.

[16:26] The average Stern buyer probably has spent

[16:29] like 20 to $50,000 with Stern pinball, right?

[16:32] So if you're spending that much money on pinball machines,

[16:35] are you gonna tell me that you're not gonna fork over

[16:38] five or $10 a month to get access to different things?

[16:42] That's just a few more millions of dollars

[16:44] into the pocket of Stern pinball

[16:46] every single month.

[16:47] That's revenue that Jersey Jack does not have.

[16:50] And it's always amazed me when I see these pinball companies

[16:53] how much unrealized profit they're leaving on the table.

[16:57] I think they went about it the wrong way.

[16:59] I really do.

[16:59] I think the mistake they all made,

[17:01] the mistake they all made,

[17:02] they made the base level of the product way too expensive.

[17:05] They're just charging way too much

[17:07] to get the machine itself.

[17:09] What they should be doing,

[17:11] and I don't know why they didn't think this through,

[17:13] they should not have raised the MSRP of the games so much

[17:17] where they should have made the additional revenue

[17:20] is with stuff like mods

[17:22] and then you can sell new software,

[17:24] you can have accessories.

[17:25] I mean, I'm watching the pinballed accessory market now

[17:29] is blowing up.

[17:30] I mean, it's exploding.

[17:32] People are making like half a million dollars a year.

[17:34] People are making more money than Keith Elwyn

[17:38] by making mods for Keith Elwyn's games.

[17:41] I mean, and Stern Pinball is not doing anything about that.

[17:44] It's crazy to me.

[17:45] Imagine if Stern like made Godzilla

[17:48] and then actually made like official accessories

[17:51] to go with the games.

[17:52] And I know we would complain about it.

[17:54] I know we would all be like,

[17:55] well, why doesn't this just come with the game?

[17:57] Well, look, if a Stern LE was $10,000,

[18:01] then I wouldn't mind spending another $500 on accessories.

[18:05] But when you charge me $13,000

[18:08] and the games got flat plastics,

[18:11] yeah, then it sucks

[18:12] because you don't wanna have to spend that much money

[18:14] then another $1,000 to make it look like it should.

[18:18] And then another $2,000 on a topper.

[18:21] But back to my original question on this show,

[18:24] does pinball need to keep growing?

[18:27] Is there more growth in pinball?

[18:28] Well, in the world of economics,

[18:30] if you raise your prices, you're gonna shrink your growth.

[18:34] And I think that's where we're at right now.

[18:36] I think all the dealers are feeling it.

[18:38] I think Stern is feeling it.

[18:40] I think they did that panic media tour for a reason.

[18:43] I think they've gone over the edge, right?

[18:45] They've hit that tipping point

[18:47] and now they're at the point of diminishing returns.

[18:50] And I don't think there's more growth, not at these prices.

[18:53] I don't think there's more growth,

[18:54] not if these are the themes.

[18:56] I don't think there's more growth

[18:58] if this is how much mechanical magic

[19:00] you're gonna put into the games.

[19:02] I think we're gonna see an explosion in used pin sales.

[19:05] I think that's where all the deals are gonna be.

[19:08] I think New and Box is gonna continue

[19:10] to decline every single month.

[19:12] I think those who buy New and Box

[19:14] are basically gonna be the people

[19:16] that don't have a problem with lighting money on fire.

[19:20] But for everybody else, you might as well just wait, right?

[19:23] This is not a used car.

[19:24] There's no chance it's gonna get into a car accident.

[19:27] People don't beat on these machines.

[19:29] People buy these things, barely play them,

[19:32] and they actually tweak them so they work right.

[19:35] And then you can buy one and save like two to $3,000.

[19:38] So if you ask me where the growth is gonna be,

[19:41] are the used pin dealers?

[19:43] Like if you're a dealer that just deals

[19:45] in used pinball machines,

[19:47] I'm surprised we don't see more of those pop up, right?

[19:50] I mean, we've got new car dealerships

[19:51] and we've got used car dealerships.

[19:53] I think that's where growth is gonna happen.

[19:56] The used pinball salesman is the place I would wanna be.

[19:59] All right, everybody, thank you

[20:00] for just this random tangent thought.

[20:03] I don't even know if I brought this back

[20:04] to a total conclusion.

[20:05] All I know is I love just doing this show every week

[20:08] and giving you guys content and being on Paternity Leave

[20:11] hasn't really disrupted our normal scheduling.

[20:14] Join me tomorrow for the Saturday morning spectacular

[20:17] at 10 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Facebook.

[20:21] Everybody be good, we'll talk to you soon.

[20:23] I will still you

[20:29] Come at yourself

[20:32] It's my love

[20:35] Don't you forget

[20:39] Cut in the crown

[20:43] In the blue rain

[20:47] It's my love

[20:50] Don't you forget

[20:54] Cut in the crown

[20:58] In the blue rain

[21:01] It's my love

[21:05] Don't you forget

[21:09] Cut in the crown

[21:13] In the blue rain
