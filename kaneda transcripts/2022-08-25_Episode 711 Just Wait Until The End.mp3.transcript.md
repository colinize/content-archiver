[00:00] If David Fix were to write a song for American Pinball, it would be this song right now.

[00:14] Sing it, Dave.

[00:19] Original IPA.

[00:20] J-pop.

[00:21] J-pop.

[03:52] Oh, yeah.

[03:57] Oh, yeah.

[04:02] Oh, yeah.

[04:07] Oh, yeah.

[04:12] Oh, yeah.

[04:17] Oh, yeah.

[04:22] Oh, yeah.

[04:27] Oh, yeah.

[04:32] Oh, yeah.

[04:37] Oh, yeah.

[04:42] Oh, yeah.

[04:47] Oh, yeah.

[04:52] Oh, yeah.

[04:57] Oh, yeah.

[05:02] Oh, yeah.

[05:07] Oh, yeah.

[05:12] Oh, yeah.

[05:17] Oh, yeah.

[05:22] Oh, yeah.

[05:27] Oh, yeah.

[05:32] Oh, yeah.

[05:37] Oh, yeah.

[05:41] Oh, yeah.

[05:46] Oh, yeah.

[05:51] Oh, yeah.

[05:57] Oh, yeah.

[06:02] Oh, yeah.

[06:07] He's on the left side and then you slap this like candy coat it red plate

[06:11] And then you have all these people sign it like I just don't get it come on Jersey Jack

[06:16] You need to innovate you need to listen to the feedback

[06:20] You need to make a better effort, but as I've said and I'll say it again

[06:23] I think this is just Pat Loller get out of here game

[06:27] I think they're glad to see him go and I think they're finally gonna implement good changes moving forward now that Pat is no

[06:34] Longer overseeing operations there because Pat never really cared about the collector's editions

[06:39] He didn't care about it on dialed in he didn't care about it on Willy Wonka and again

[06:44] I don't think he really cared about it on Toy Story 4. There's just not enough different to see

[06:51] $3,000 more in the price of this one versus the le

[06:54] I mean you're gonna be able to get like a shooter rod for like a hundred bucks and someone's gonna make a better

[06:59] Topper than the one that's up on the machine

[07:01] I can't wait to see

[07:02] Unboxings of this game and they need to get these out there now the question becomes how many of you out there who have a

[07:09] Nonrefundable deposit of 2,500 bucks are going to write that additional check for 12 5

[07:15] I'm really curious to see how the market responds now that the games are being made here is my guess

[07:21] I don't think they're gonna make a thousand there is no way they're gonna make a thousand right now

[07:26] I think they must have had feedback from distributors like even like Zach many is like

[07:31] We have some available which means that

[07:35] Distributors have cut a check for a thousand of these games

[07:38] So let's say 900 of these games have been allocated to distributors and distributors have paid the deposit on the game

[07:46] So how does it work then before Jersey Jack pinball sends the distributor the product are they gonna require the distributor to make up the

[07:53] Difference so that the distributor is basically giving Jersey Jack pinball like this much money for the game now look distributors

[08:00] Don't have to spend retail on the game. I bet like a distributor makes about

[08:04] 1500 to

[08:05] 2000 on every single CE they buy which means the balance to the distributors not

[08:12] 12 5 it's probably something like 10 5 and it gives them a nice room to make a little bit of profit on everyone sold

[08:18] But they still got to sell it right even if they don't sell it that's still what like

[08:23] $13,000 in merchandise they have sitting in their warehouse and they need to find someone to buy it

[08:30] It's kind of a hard sell because now people know they can get like an elli of toy story for a thousand off

[08:36] But as I've said now that the games are shipping we will know for sure

[08:41] Where the demand is at a couple sales on pinside does not signify where the true demand for the game is

[08:49] There are a lot of people off of pinside buying this game

[08:53] There are a lot of people unaware of pinside, you know

[08:56] If you go on Facebook and you go on eBay and people just stumble into a distributor

[09:01] There is going to be people that have no clue whatsoever that there is even a website called pinside where I can save a

[09:09] $1,000 and I've got a sign up and I've got to make a deal with someone

[09:12] I don't know a lot of people are gonna feel a lot better buying from a distributor who has it in a box

[09:19] And you can have it tomorrow if you spend $15,000 and absolutely they're gonna sell some games that way

[09:25] But I just think this package just looks exactly like Willy Wonka

[09:28] I can't wait to someone puts this next to Willy Wonka and we get to see is this the exact same red

[09:35] Candycoat armor as Willy Wonka. It looks exactly the same. So then the question becomes this people

[09:42] Did they even make 500 Willy Wonka collectors editions? Do you think they did?

[09:47] See, I don't think they made all 500 Wonka CEs and if they didn't maybe they are carrying over

[09:54] Some of those parts for these games. Who knows like we've seen Stern do this before

[09:59] Didn't Stern take like leftover armor from WWE and then use it for Guardians of the Galaxy

[10:05] Like we've seen this before this isn't the first time a pinball company is just taking parts off the shelf and putting it into a

[10:12] Future title. Alright, so we got that going on. What else is going on in pinball?

[10:17] Well, look the most ridiculous item of the day

[10:21] American pinball putting out an announcement that Magic Girl is back people. Did you miss it?

[10:27] Did you miss playing Magic Girl the most broken pinball machine of all time?

[10:31] John Papadouk's

[10:33] disastrous game that took him like 10 years to make and it was completely unfinished now our friends in the

[10:40] Netherlands have spent a few years

[10:43] Fixing a lot of the issues on the Magic Girl and they've turned this broken machine into a somewhat not even somewhat like a working

[10:52] Machine, is it a machine? That's gonna give you the level of depth. You're used to in a game

[10:56] No, is it a machine in which the artwork on the playfield signifies?

[11:01] What's gonna happen in the gameplay experience? No, but they made all the mechs work. They made all the shots

[11:09] Makeable they made all the ball locks activate. They made like the magnetic flipper area

[11:14] Activate like all the stuff now works and there's a lot in it

[11:18] Like there's a lot they did like they spent three years

[11:22] Mechanically fixing a lot of the issues in the game and they spent three years coding the game and

[11:28] Utilizing a lot of the stuff that was recorded for the game that never made its way into the initial version

[11:35] American pinball put out in the world even with all that being said if I asked you one simple question

[11:41] Do you even care about Magic Girl the answer by like 99% of the community is no

[11:49] Nobody cares about these John Papadou games anymore

[11:53] Absolutely not. Are they beautiful? Are they works of art? Yes. Are they super rare? Yes

[11:58] Was this a crazy venture to go down this road of like fixing this game over three years?

[12:04] Yes, and guess what guess how much money our friends in the Netherlands were charging for the right to own one of these

[12:13] Fixed Magic Girl machines. Are you sitting down? They were selling it for fifty five

[12:19] thousand euros

[12:21] fifty five

[12:23] Thousand euros now when they did this work getting a Magic Girl you could get one for like

[12:29] $20,000 as a nice work of art so they're charging

[12:33] $35,000 over the price of a base Magic Girl machine to just wake it up and

[12:41] Make it a game that is at least playable. I mean, it's crazy. The whole thing is crazy

[12:46] I mean this game appeals to the person that wants the ultra rare and wants something completely unique that not everybody else gets a

[12:53] chance to play or experience and on that front it

[12:56] Succeeds like I can't wait to play this game at pinball expo

[13:01] But the real question is this why would David fix and why would anyone at American pinball?

[13:08] Celebrate this game. Why would anyone over there put out an announcement that they're part of this games like

[13:16] Resurrection and they help these people in the Netherlands get this game in working order

[13:20] See here's what I think is happening and I think people are reading a little bit too much into this

[13:25] I think David fix as an organizer of pinball expo like this is his show

[13:32] I think he's just looking for more reasons why you should come to expo like they are using this as an

[13:40] Attraction like if you come to pinball expo you can play a working Magic Girl

[13:45] Which is like okay like you could swim with the mythological Moby Dick of pinball

[13:50] It's known as Magic Girl and you know what on that front

[13:53] I think it's a great sideshow attraction to bring to a pinball show because that's what Magic Girl is

[14:00] That's what Magic Girl will always be in anyone's collection a sideshow attraction

[14:07] It's never gonna be a good game. It's never gonna be a great game

[14:11] It's just a conversation piece and I'm excited to play it

[14:16] And I know the hard work that went into fixing the game

[14:19] And I can't wait to see how they turned it on because nobody knows how broken Magic Girl was

[14:26] More than me I had one and it was the weirdest thing to own

[14:30] Like it looks so cool, and then you walk up to it and there's no magic in the game whatsoever

[14:36] So I can't wait to see it, but I think American pinball you need to not have your brand

[14:43] Associated anymore with Magic Girl they know all too well that John Papadouk took advantage of American pinball

[14:50] He almost bankrupted another pinball company that you guys gave Papadouk like

[14:57] 350,000 plus dollars

[14:59] To tinker in the back room of American pinball for a year and then he released this crappy pinball machine

[15:05] Like just stay away American pinball stay away from Magic Girl stay away from hyping it

[15:11] I just think they should have put out this announcement that this game was going to be at expo

[15:16] Come by and enjoy it

[15:18] Don't say it's coming on behalf of American pinball because now you've got the Dingleberries all wondering if

[15:25] American pinball is actually gonna rerun this game or produce it one day and in a world in which David Fixx has gone on the record and

[15:33] Say hey, we're gonna make homebrew games, and we're gonna see what you guys want

[15:37] Who knows maybe he is crazy enough to actually see if the demand for this game is pretty high at the show and then

[15:45] Put this thing into production

[15:46] I don't think he's gonna do it and the guys in the Netherlands are not gonna hand over their work to American pinball

[15:51] And I also don't think he's gonna do it because I don't think there's any market for it

[15:56] Nobody wants this game. Can you hear my frustration?

[15:59] I just can't wait till we get to a place in pinball in which John Papadouk and his Frankenstein

[16:06] Hack job creations have no place in pinball anymore in which we don't talk about them

[16:12] We don't try to fix them. We don't try to bail out his idiotic creations

[16:17] We just stick a fork in J-pop. He's done as Chris and Melissa's

[16:22] License plate says on their truck because he burned them for a hundred thousand plus dollars as their license plate reads on the coin

[16:31] Take your truck J-pop sucks. It's time to move on. Canada. What are you doing? What else is going on in pinball?

[16:38] Well, look, there's not much we're waiting

[16:40] I'm so bored that I am in this pinside thread about great witch John and his trailer park game

[16:47] Now look this thread has spiraled into

[16:51] Absolute craziness. It is like a soap opera in that thread. You've got discussions about how many drinks a day

[16:59] Constitutes an alcoholic you've got Ben Hex saying this project is dead before it even gets started

[17:05] You got Iceman financing this thing

[17:08] You've got all these people on the sidelines either rooting for John to succeed or rooting for him to fail

[17:15] You got everybody questioning whether or not he has the skills necessary to make it happen

[17:20] But I will say this somewhere amongst all of this. I just feel bad for him

[17:25] I feel bad for everybody in that thread clearly. He needs some money

[17:31] Clearly he needs some help clearly he finds some sense of belonging in this community

[17:36] And that is why he's on pinside every day

[17:40] Like so many times a day connecting with each and every one of you in a lot of ways pinside sometimes

[17:46] acts as like a therapist chair for people out there who are just in need of some connection

[17:52] They might be lonely. They might need some money

[17:55] They might need some support and they probably just need some attention

[17:59] I will say having eight beers on a random Tuesday probably not the best idea

[18:05] Probably not something I would say if I were trying to lure investors into my project, but this thing is not even about John

[18:12] It's not even about the people in the thread

[18:14] It's all about how hard it is to make pinball and for some reason even if you're like a

[18:20] Restorer or you're someone who's like made play fields

[18:23] There's a lot of people who have been in this hobby for many years and they might have done full builds and tear downs

[18:29] And I think what happens in pinball when you're frequently close to it

[18:33] You start to think it's easy to make a game like you look at it. You're like well, there's a cabinet

[18:38] There's a play field. There's some wires and there's some mechs

[18:41] How hard can it be to put all these elements together if I have like an entire year to do it

[18:47] And if I have like enough money to do it, but people remember Robert Mueller had 61 million dollars

[18:53] And couldn't get one game out the door. He only made two prototypes with

[18:58] 61 million dollars and as much as like people think they can streamline it as much as they think they can use a

[19:05] CNC machine in their house as much as they think they have a friend who can code it for them as

[19:10] Much as they feel like it's easy to get an artist to make art for the play field. It's really hard

[19:16] You know pinball really attracts dreamers in such a unique way

[19:19] I don't think I've ever seen a hobby where the end product is a device that requires very complex

[19:27] Manufacturing that has basically

[19:29] Attracted

[19:30] Individuals who think they can do it all themselves. It's the weirdest thing like J-pop thought

[19:37] He could do what a team of people at Bali Williams did on his own

[19:42] He thought he could orchestrate the production of a game

[19:46] You know what I'm gonna do to end this podcast because I do want to bury magic girl and J-pop and all these dreamers

[19:52] Once and for all who have no idea what they're doing. I want to share with you a phone call

[19:56] I had with Robert Mueller. This is the actual first phone call

[20:00] I had with Robert Mueller when I heard that deep root pinball was

[20:05] Remaking magic girl and I had a magic girl and I just wanted to know from him

[20:10] What's up because I was seeing all this conversation and I just wanted to record the phone call because I thought it would be

[20:16] Important to capture, you know what he said as someone who was

[20:21] $23,000 at the time invested in magic girl

[20:23] I'm gonna leave you with this little treat no one's ever heard this before

[20:27] Robert probably doesn't even remember having this conversation

[20:30] He's got a lot more issues to worry about now than me airing this for you right now

[20:35] Enjoy everybody. Thank you for subscribing to the canada club. We'll be back. Hopefully soon with Stern's next title any week now later

[20:59] Welcome to deep root innovative investment fund design with safety in mind

[21:05] You may dial the three digit extension of the person you wish to reach at any time

[21:09] Name menu press one for fund customer service

[21:13] Press two for sales or general fund information

[21:17] Press three for deep root pinball

[21:22] Thank you for calling deep root pinball

[21:30] Deep roots Robert. Oh, hey Robert. This is Chris. How's it going?

[21:34] Okay, have a question for you. I'm an owner of a John Papa Duke magic girl machine

[21:40] And I want I just been hearing a bunch of stuff. I wanted to call you guys and see if they're like what's going on

[21:47] Yeah, I'm sorry Chris. What is your last name?

[21:49] Kulores K double O

[21:51] L U R I S

[21:54] Okay

[21:55] And are you a part of the litigation or?

[21:58] You know, I own Kim Mitchell's machine. I know he is part of the litigation

[22:04] Okay, and

[22:07] Yeah, I just wanted to see like if you know, I'm hearing like rumors like you guys are remaking magic girl

[22:12] Like this and that I just wanted to like call you guys and not listen to like all the internet forum on the jumbo

[22:18] Yeah, that's that's probably a good thing these days. However, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to help you very much

[22:23] We're right now prohibited by law and agreement from disclosing anything to anybody

[22:29] this this leak that came out was unfortunate and untimely and

[22:35] It's making it very difficult for you know nice

[22:39] Persons like you who have a legitimate and sincere interest and figuring out what's going on

[22:43] To for us to be able to give you the information that you're looking for so I hope you understand

[22:50] Sort of the bind we're in right you guys have a time frame when more information will be disclosed for people like myself

[22:57] it is

[22:58] It is very unfortunate that this came out when it did

[23:02] I hope that it's not going to harm anything that's

[23:06] being worked on but

[23:09] Because of that it would be very hard for me right now to give you a time frame at all

[23:13] I would hope it sooner rather than later, but you know, it's

[23:18] It is what it is

[23:20] So when that happens, so you're welcome to

[23:23] To call back and perhaps we could have a little bit more of a discussion about what's gonna happen

[23:28] We're very sincere. We know I

[23:33] Know business and I know pinball probably better than anyone else

[23:37] That's even bothering to run a pinball company and everything is intentional

[23:41] so we have

[23:43] We have the sincerest

[23:46] desire

[23:47] To make this go away and to just have fun with pinball again, so

[23:53] You have my my wording guarantee on that

[23:56] Okay, well like when you say when you say like make it go away like just the drama around like John or just like you guys are gonna

[24:02] Get into pinball differently or I

[24:05] Would say all of the above

[24:07] Right, okay

[24:08] I mean because I guess so you guys didn't plan like the website to go because that's what everyone's like talking about is just him

[24:13] His name on the website is like making people freak out

[24:16] Yeah, I really I really don't mind if they freak out

[24:21] It's unfortunate that people who do have legitimate issues with J-pop

[24:27] Are caught in the middle, right?

[24:30] but you know we

[24:33] We run our business like a business and that means that we don't really pay attention to most of the people who

[24:41] Who don't have a stake in the game and will likely never be a customer of ours anyway, so

[24:47] I understand that you know it's a little different from where you're at

[24:51] But I would hope that you would you would understand that we were professionals

[24:56] We're gonna continue conducting like a business and like a business would in this particular situation

[25:02] So what's it Robert? What's your are you is your background in pinball or is it in?

[25:07] I'm a little bit of everything. I have a legal background financial background. I have a tech background

[25:14] so I

[25:17] Do a little bit of everything right

[25:20] All right. Well, I appreciate it. Yeah, I mean just to give you my story

[25:24] I mean I purchased a magic girl like a lot of guys and we paid a lot of money for him, right?

[25:28] so there's obviously a lot of

[25:31] angst around any news about around John because just so you know as an owner

[25:35] He shipped the machines that he made and with American pinball and then he sort of just like ghosted all of us

[25:42] Like he doesn't return our calls. He doesn't respond and you probably know

[25:46] The games he shipped weren't in fully functioning order

[25:51] And we're just trying to get a sense of like is he ever gonna give us additional support?

[25:56] Is he our new magic girls gonna be made and then what do we do with ours?

[26:00] You know because people have a lot of money riding on these things and I I just think that um

[26:05] It's unfortunate that

[26:07] This is all happening right now because it's like reopening wounds for a lot of people

[26:11] I mean at least I have a magical all the rasa guys are still like

[26:14] Just in pain so

[26:17] So I I'm not gonna excuse anything John has done right I

[26:23] Understand completely where you're coming from

[26:25] and

[26:27] I will tell you that those are the very issues that we're working on behind the scenes and I hope at some point in the

[26:34] Future that will be able to make things a little clear for you. Okay, but that would that work?

[26:39] Yeah, so the rumor I'm hearing and you can you don't have to answer you probably can answer

[26:43] But that you guys are making magic girl and we'll swap out

[26:47] Existing magic girls for ones that are working. Is there any truth to that? I?

[26:51] Can't discuss that at all. Okay

[26:53] All right

[26:55] All right. Well, I guess we'll wait and see how things go. I

[27:00] Wish you guys the best of luck. I I am anxious

[27:03] When I see John's name on a company's you know list of because he just brings a lot of toxicity

[27:10] So hopefully you guys can figure that part out, but actually we haven't had any toxicity whatsoever with John

[27:15] he's been a pleasure to work with and I wouldn't have I

[27:21] Wouldn't be in the situation where I am in knowing the toxicity out there unless I knew that John was the right person

[27:29] to to step up admit his faults and

[27:33] take the consequences as they come and and

[27:36] There's no one including us that are going to

[27:40] spare him of consequences that will come from some bad decisions, right?

[27:44] But I'm not gonna treat him like a monster like anyone else. No, I just you know online and admitted to your queen is going to do

[27:50] I'm gonna do that. I met with him. I've worked with him. I've met with his family

[27:56] I see I've seen a personal side of John that most people have not seen of course, you know with that said

[28:03] I'm I have a personal stake and out of my own pocket and and and trying to make things right

[28:12] So if anyone wants to fault me for my my view of John then they don't have to you know, accept

[28:19] You know some of the things we're trying to do to make things right for people

[28:22] I mean it's it comes down to something simple like that, right? Yeah, no, I hope you guys can make you know

[28:27] Everyone whole I mean that's like what everyone's that's all anyone's ever wanted with this whole situation is to get the games

[28:32] They paid for you know, it's it's a toy

[28:35] Frolic online was was very helpful in posting a posting

[28:39] I said a couple of years ago when I got a little frustrated with John at the time and it still stands today that
