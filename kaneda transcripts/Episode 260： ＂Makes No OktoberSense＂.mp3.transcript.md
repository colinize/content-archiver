[00:00] We are here, we are here, we are here, we are here, we are here, we are here, we are here in here, we are here, we are here, we are here in here, we are here in here.

[00:12] Let's

[00:13] . . .

[00:20] Welcome to Episode 266 of Canadas Pimbal Podcast, I'm your host, Canada.

[00:25] We've got a lot to talk about on this episode of Canatus Pimbal Podcast.

[00:29] I'm sorry that Tony hijacked the last show.

[00:33] He may come back every once in a while.

[00:35] Maybe just as a guest, we might not do whole episodes with him, but there's a lot going

[00:39] on in the Pimbal world.

[00:41] You might know by the music we played at the beginning of this show that we're definitely

[00:46] going to jump into the confirmation that happened this weekend at the Vancouver show by American

[00:54] Pimbal.

[00:55] We've got to just find some irony in this sort of strategy.

[01:00] Let me just tell you what goes on inside my little marketing head.

[01:06] Let's just get this straight.

[01:08] I'm going to break it down in one simple sentence.

[01:11] American Pimbal announces in Canada their next title is about your P. and Festival nobody

[01:21] in America cares about.

[01:23] You can't write this stuff any better than this.

[01:27] I mean, it's just too funny.

[01:30] It's too comical.

[01:31] We finally got confirmation about American Pimbal's soft morick title, October fest.

[01:39] It's probably one of the worst kept secrets in Pimbal next to the Beatles and Monsters.

[01:46] Let's talk about that.

[01:48] I do find it funny that we're getting confirmation way before a game is even shown.

[01:57] But as Joe said, people uncovered the fact that they were filing for the trademark months

[02:04] ago and that's how it got out.

[02:06] Now let me ask you guys a question because I'm curious about this.

[02:10] Why is it that nobody knows what Stern's next titles are?

[02:17] The filings for trademark are they more secretive when how Stern does it?

[02:23] But for the most part, it just feels like we're in a complete dark space when it comes to

[02:29] Stern's 2019 titles.

[02:31] So does that mean they haven't filed for trademarks or to stern file for lots of trademarks that

[02:38] you just don't know what's next?

[02:39] I don't know.

[02:40] I don't know.

[02:41] I think if you dug a little deeper, people might find out what is coming from Stern.

[02:46] Here's how I want to tackle Octoberfest.

[02:48] You know me.

[02:49] I've been down on this title and this theme for a long time and I'll tell you why.

[02:54] And I look and I only know what I know, which is what you know, which is just the theme

[03:00] of the game.

[03:01] And so, yes, there is something completely missing for my assessment and my opinion about

[03:06] it and that's the actual game itself.

[03:08] So we're going to say that, of course, I can't wait to see what they put together.

[03:16] Of course, I will look at the game with open eyes.

[03:23] But that doesn't mean this is a theme I want.

[03:26] And you don't have to celebrate and welcome every new pinball theme that gets announced

[03:33] in the world.

[03:34] Okay.

[03:35] And yes, a game can go in a million different directions.

[03:37] So we know absolutely nothing.

[03:40] We do know this.

[03:41] What we do know is that American pinball does put a lot into their games.

[03:45] Okay.

[03:46] I make fun of Houdini because I think it shoots poorly and I think a lot of you agree.

[03:50] I think the shots are really tight.

[03:52] Now the reason why shows like this, we tell the truth about how a game shoots is because

[03:57] I hope Joe and Josh, who probably listen to this show when they design Octoberfest, they

[04:05] realize that don't make the game too tight, don't make the game frustrating because that

[04:11] takes away from the enjoyment of the game itself.

[04:15] So I hope that they design Octoberfest to have shots that aren't completely frustrating

[04:20] to hit because I think Houdini is a terrible brickfest and I've said it from the first

[04:25] moment I plunged it to having put about 50 games on Houdini.

[04:29] I still think the layout was rushed and I think they had to rush it.

[04:33] Now they didn't have to rush Octoberfest.

[04:36] But here's the thing and we're going to talk about why I believe theme is so critically

[04:41] important for a pinball company to succeed and especially for new pinball companies that

[04:47] are trying to make it, theme is almost everything and I want to explain why that is.

[04:53] And so first of all, if you have to start convincing people that it's a good theme that it

[04:58] could work, then you've probably picked a bad theme.

[05:02] Right from the get go, if I put 15 themes up on a wall and you were to tell me which

[05:08] one would make a great pinball machine, I highly doubt that Octoberfest would come to

[05:13] the top of the list.

[05:14] And the other thing that I find completely comical about this theme is people post links

[05:20] to Octoberfest Wikipedia page where it talks about the popularity of the festival and then

[05:28] people will be like, well, it's nothing to sneeze at that.

[05:30] All these millions of people enjoy Octoberfest.

[05:33] All right, here's the problem when you do stuff like that.

[05:37] Is your failing to realize the context by which your main buyer base you believe in?

[05:45] Okay, what I mean by that is like, I'll do, I'll say it in a different way.

[05:50] Do you know what the number one selling fruit is in the world?

[05:54] The number one selling fruit in the entire world, if you were going to base a pinball machine

[05:59] around a fruit, the number one in the world is the mango, okay?

[06:05] The mango.

[06:06] Do you know what mango's position in popularity is in the United States?

[06:12] It is the 22nd most popular fruit.

[06:16] The reason I know that is we do the PR for the mango board.

[06:20] You see, that's the problem with Octoberfest and making this a theme in America.

[06:26] Is that this is the number one pinball buying market.

[06:31] It is by far the number one pinball buying market way more than Europe, okay?

[06:36] And so because of that, you're basically making a theme that most people who live in the

[06:42] predominant buying market of your products are not fans of.

[06:49] So why would you make a game based on something that doesn't resonate with the main audience

[06:57] of pinball?

[06:58] Okay, so literally, like I just don't understand why you would make it harder on yourself

[07:05] versus something that is easier on yourself.

[07:09] So let's say you want to make a pinball machine about beer and carnival rides and drinking

[07:14] and roller coasters and all the stuff that I think I see in these photos of Octoberfest

[07:19] and women with their cleavage hanging out, all the things you see when you Google Octoberfest,

[07:26] could you not come up with a different, more relatable American themed version of those

[07:33] elements?

[07:34] I don't know.

[07:35] I mean, it's kind of strange to me that you pick a festival that's not big here unless

[07:41] you only want to sell your games in Cincinnati, which apparently is a city that celebrates

[07:47] Octoberfest.

[07:48] All right.

[07:49] The other thing, you know, when they show the title and I just don't, I know they had

[07:55] to show it early, but it's just a shame because I just still can't for the life of me get

[08:01] over the fact that Stern Pinball is the most profitable pinball company in the world and

[08:09] they have shown us time and time again how to properly reveal, release and make money

[08:17] in the pinball industry and then every boutique which tries to take some of that money and

[08:24] market share from Stern, they always fumble how they announce and reveal and release their

[08:30] games and it's just kind of head scratching like how many times are people going to try

[08:36] and do it differently and ultimately end up failing to create the kind of hype and the

[08:43] kind of fear of missing out and the kind of like I have to buy it now sort of environment

[08:49] that Stern masterfully creates with each of their launches.

[08:53] Now here's the thing.

[08:55] When are we going to see Octoberfest?

[08:58] We hear that the reveal is going to happen at Expo of 2018 in October.

[09:06] Alright, so what does that mean?

[09:08] Does that mean we're going to see the game or does that mean the game is going to be ready

[09:14] for production?

[09:15] Now I heard they're going to come with maybe two or three examples of Octoberfest to be

[09:20] on the floor.

[09:22] But here again, are they falling into the same trap that these boutique manufacturers always

[09:30] fall into and if you're listening to me Josh and you're listening to me Joe because

[09:34] you must listen to this show.

[09:37] You should not reveal your game at Expo, bring it to Expo if this game is not ready to

[09:45] go into immediate production.

[09:48] It absolutely makes no sense to do it that way and I highly doubt that they are all

[09:55] tooled up that they are all ready to go to put this game into production.

[10:00] The reason why I think they're going to make a mistake is first and foremost I think

[10:03] Pinball Expo and you guys have probably seen the Threadon Pinside with Mike and 35 years

[10:11] of putting on Expo and all the drama surrounding Expo.

[10:15] I don't even want to get into it but I want to say this Pinball Expo is no longer the

[10:21] show anymore.

[10:22] It is probably I think one of the worst pinball shows that happens in the country.

[10:28] There's so many better shows in Pittsburgh, T.P.F., Allentown, Vancouver, so many better

[10:36] places, so many so much more positive vibes and energy going on and yet Chicago Expo still

[10:45] remains in people's minds as like the place to reveal games and that is all leftover

[10:53] baggage, not baggage but it's just leftover prominence from the show of yesterday years

[10:59] that it used to be which is where people would reveal their games so that operators and

[11:04] distributors could see what's coming out next and place their orders.

[11:09] This was at a time when games like Adams Family would sell 20,000 units and it would be

[11:14] shown at Pinball Expo beforehand and I think a lot of people have a lot of stars in their

[11:20] eyes about what that show was.

[11:23] That show is no longer around.

[11:25] That show no longer means that.

[11:27] That show is now I think probably the worst place to reveal your game.

[11:33] Also the show is irrelevant.

[11:36] Let's be honest, the majority of people who are buying these games are home collectors.

[11:41] They everyone now has access to something called the internet that you could reveal or

[11:49] tease or talk about or release your product in 2018 using this new medium called a computer

[11:57] and using this new distribution channel called the internet to actually get people excited

[12:04] about your game and you can actually get more eyeballs on whatever your new product is

[12:10] using this great new invention called the internet and the computer.

[12:15] It's funny how these companies show up at these shows and I was going to talk a little

[12:21] bit about this with Jersey Jack but they show up at these shows with probably the worst

[12:29] PowerPoint presentations I've ever seen.

[12:32] It's funny to me and it was laughing when I saw a picture of Jack with his PowerPoint

[12:37] behind them and it's sort of like the basic PowerPoint slides.

[12:41] Here's the irony in that.

[12:43] These companies don't even understand how to make PowerPoint wide.

[12:48] They don't know how to make the slides wide so it fills the whole screen and yet Jack

[12:52] all he does is make wide body pins but he can't figure out how to make a wide screen

[12:58] version of PowerPoint which by the way looks so much nicer.

[13:02] It's like going from the normal TV frame to the wide screen view that we watch TV now.

[13:08] These companies PowerPoint presentations are so embarrassingly bad that I just don't

[13:13] get it.

[13:14] But anyway my point is this, you got this game Octoberfest.

[13:18] You want to get people excited.

[13:20] You want to get people into the theme.

[13:23] You know you've got some hurdles to overcome because it's not the most popular theme.

[13:27] I just hope they utilize some better marketing tools to get people excited about the game

[13:34] versus the same old boring model of launching games where you go to Expo with 2-3, you do

[13:41] a boring S seminar, you pull the curtain off it, nobody in the room can even see the game.

[13:48] People are struggling to take photos.

[13:50] You don't have high-res images ready.

[13:52] You don't have high-res video ready for the internet.

[13:55] And the first time people see your product that you've worked on for a really long time comes

[14:00] to the world via crappy cell phone videos and crappy cell phone photographs.

[14:06] Okay.

[14:07] See that's the problem.

[14:09] What is the problem is like these companies, they literally don't utilize the easiest

[14:16] way to get people excited about their games.

[14:19] Okay.

[14:20] So what else do I want to talk about when it comes to Octoberfest?

[14:23] So if you think theme doesn't matter and you think theme can be overcome by a great shooting

[14:29] pinball machine.

[14:31] I want everyone to realize that I am not necessarily sure that if the game is good that

[14:39] that will override a bad theme.

[14:42] Okay.

[14:43] And here's the best example of that.

[14:46] You take the best pinball designer in the history of pinball.

[14:52] Okay.

[14:53] He's the guy that designed the game that is sold the most ever.

[14:57] And I think people would not argue that he is probably the greatest pinball designer ever.

[15:05] I know Steve Richie might have sold the most in volume, but I don't think you'd get

[15:09] many people that would argue against the fact that Pat Lawler is one of the greatest, if

[15:15] not the greatest pinball designer ever.

[15:18] That he does everything from licensed themes to original themes.

[15:22] He's designs are always unique and creative and interesting and he knows how to give good

[15:27] flow.

[15:28] He's got great toys and mechs and he has a mind for pinball that I think we all agree on.

[15:33] Okay.

[15:34] Now Pat Lawler gets picked up by Jersey Jack Pinball.

[15:38] All right.

[15:39] Spence five years making a game.

[15:42] Five years making a game.

[15:44] Gets to do whatever he wants.

[15:46] Jack does not chain him to a bomb or to anything put whatever you want in this game.

[15:52] This is like his opus.

[15:54] His magnum opus and what happens?

[16:01] The game flops because it's dialed in because it's a theme that just doesn't resonate.

[16:09] Now let me, we're going to talk about Jersey Jack Pinball volume of sales, but I'll just

[16:14] say this.

[16:16] Dialed in has not too date even sold near 2000 units.

[16:22] Now here's the problem with that is Pat Lawler and with his new game that everyone was

[16:28] waiting for ever for in a climate in which people are buying way more way more than that

[16:34] Stern games and we all know dialed in is got more in it than any Stern any Stern and

[16:42] yet Stern is running circles around that game in sales.

[16:45] Stern will sell more.

[16:47] They will sell more Deadpool pros than dialed in ever sold and it was not designed over

[16:54] five years.

[16:55] It doesn't have the same design as like you know a Pat Lawler machine, but it's just again,

[17:01] you guys all have to agree that theme is so much more important than people realize and

[17:07] I do think that when this game comes out, it's going to have to be absolutely amazing

[17:14] and magical to overcome the theme issue.

[17:18] And I look forward to seeing it.

[17:21] I think revealing it at Expo will be a humongous mistake if the game is not on the line.

[17:27] I don't think you can show a game and then tell people, oh it's going to ship in six months.

[17:32] I think that's silly.

[17:34] What they need to do is show the game when it's ready to go in a box.

[17:38] I think this is also probably happening because Houdini sales have probably flat line

[17:42] completely.

[17:43] I still see Houdini's inbox at distributors ready to ship tomorrow.

[17:50] I think that game was another, you know, didn't take off as much as they thought it would.

[17:56] Alright, anything else I want to talk about?

[17:59] Nope, I think that's it.

[18:01] So we look forward to seeing the game in a couple months, but if they were smart and

[18:05] the game's not ready to be made, they should hold back.

[18:07] Alright, let's move on to spooky pinball.

[18:09] Get a lot of news to talk about.

[18:11] So look, spooky pinball is really an interesting place right now and there's a lot going on.

[18:17] They're coming to the end of total nuclear annihilation.

[18:21] There's something like 550 that I think will be made before Charlie says we're not making

[18:29] anymore for a while, but we might make them again.

[18:34] It's going to be a bit of humble pie that Scott Denise's game has sold the most by

[18:42] far out of any spooky title.

[18:45] And it just kind of begs the question, would in spooky pinball be better if Scott Denise

[18:51] were in charge of game design and not Charlie?

[18:56] But because this is not a spooky game, I mean let's really be honest.

[19:00] This is not a spooky game.

[19:02] This wasn't a game that was designed by spooky.

[19:06] It wasn't a game that they made.

[19:07] It wasn't a game.

[19:08] And this is Scott Denise's game.

[19:10] They simply manufactured it.

[19:12] This is a Scott Denise game manufactured by spooky.

[19:15] And the reason I say that it's still yet to be seen if spooky can make a game that there

[19:21] is enough demand to sell 500 or more.

[19:26] And Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle is that test for Charlie.

[19:30] Now, there's one thing that just keeps on sort of sticking out like an indicator, a red

[19:37] flag, a warning sign about the demand for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[19:43] And that is the fact that gentleman who's trying to sell his 66 spot in line for Alice Cooper's

[19:52] Nightmare Castle cannot find a single person to take it off his hands.

[19:59] Which means there's nobody that wants the game early or can cut the line and get it.

[20:07] It's kind of a bad indicator that you could have this game much earlier than others and

[20:15] nobody wants it.

[20:17] So what does that mean?

[20:18] Does that mean there's not one person on the fence who now has an easier way to get it

[20:24] who's willing to make the plunge?

[20:25] And I think what's going to happen, and I've said it before, is we're about to embark

[20:34] on a journey of 18 months to make all of these games.

[20:40] 18 months between production begins and the production ends.

[20:46] A year and a half of them making Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[20:51] And look, I just think demand for the game is already starting to dissipate and excitement

[20:59] for this title is not where it needs to be going into production.

[21:04] And this is nobody's fault.

[21:06] Again, nobody's fault.

[21:08] But chucks.

[21:09] And explain why.

[21:11] Again, back to my earlier point about how you market and sell a pinball machine.

[21:16] Why did Charlie show this game?

[21:18] Let me ask you a question.

[21:19] Why did he show this game seven months ago?

[21:22] Seven months ago.

[21:24] He showed this game with pretty much incomplete code.

[21:27] Why?

[21:28] Why?

[21:29] Did he need to lock in those $1,000 or non-refundable deposits?

[21:34] Then did he need to do that?

[21:36] I think he did it because he probably was afraid that at that same show, we were also supposed

[21:43] to see Monster Bash remake, which we didn't.

[21:47] And I think he didn't want to get lost in the sea of new titles.

[21:52] And so he wanted to get out early.

[21:54] Now here's the problem.

[21:56] He showed his cards seven months early.

[21:59] And luckily for him, luckily, which I think he, look, it's like Charlie got lucky and got

[22:06] an interception, but then fumbled the ball on the run back.

[22:09] This is where they fumbled everything.

[22:11] He got so lucky that Monster Bash remake was not revealed at TPS.

[22:17] He also got seven months where he had no Monster Bash remake out there in the world.

[22:25] Nothing available, nothing seen.

[22:27] So he could have been shipping games and taking orders and basically, like, during a window

[22:34] in which people wouldn't want their money back because they didn't see an alternative

[22:40] to spending their money.

[22:41] Now, look, how do you not put Monster Bash remake and Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[22:49] in a little bit of a similar theme set, in a little bit of a similar category of pinball?

[22:55] And we know, we know when you put Monster Bash remake next to Alice Cooper's Nightmare

[23:02] Castle, we know which is going to be the better game.

[23:05] It's not really a fair competition, but it's just going to be really difficult for people

[23:11] to still want to stay in on.

[23:14] I believe Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle when they see Monster Bash remake.

[23:19] And Chuck had it, and he had seven months, seven freaking months Chuck had to get people

[23:24] their Alice Cooper's and be well into production.

[23:29] And here we are.

[23:30] Here we are.

[23:31] It's September.

[23:32] All right.

[23:33] Almost the middle of September, and how many people have opened up their Alice Cooper

[23:38] Nightmare castles?

[23:39] How many?

[23:40] I don't think anyone has one in their home yet.

[23:44] And so that is why Spot Number 66 is not selling, and that is where Chuck is at.

[23:50] And hopefully he's learned a lesson again.

[23:54] Stop showing these games so early.

[23:56] You have, and you're always going to get hype.

[23:59] You look even me, man.

[24:01] And I saw, when I saw Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle for the first time, I went up and

[24:06] I shake Charlie's hand and said he had a beautiful game, and I was excited to see it and this

[24:10] and that.

[24:11] That's what Pimbal does to us.

[24:13] All right.

[24:14] There is like a two to three week period of complete excitement and enthusiasm for every

[24:21] new pin.

[24:22] And then we think about it.

[24:23] We second guest the game, and then we start to sort of look at it more critically, and

[24:28] then we start to like get more judgmental because as it becomes clear that this might be

[24:34] something that we're going to buy, we're a lot more critical of a pinball machine when

[24:39] it's now time to pay up.

[24:41] You know, and I do, I think just $1,000 or lock in your deposit, non-refundable thing,

[24:46] it's going to totally backfire on Chuck.

[24:48] It's going to absolutely backfire.

[24:50] He's going to end up with people who want out, and no one's going to buy their spots.

[24:57] Some people might want out, and they might lose their money.

[25:01] Do you think Charlie is really, because I don't think he's going to, I don't think he wants

[25:05] to be in this position, because I do think Charlie is a nice guy.

[25:08] I don't think he wants to be in a position where he basically keeps someone's money and

[25:13] doesn't send them a game.

[25:16] But that's the agreement and the contract he's put himself and his customers in.

[25:22] I mean, imagine he has to tell someone, sorry, you lose your money.

[25:26] So what happens then?

[25:27] You've got to piss off, and disappoint it, and they're not going to really be, it's

[25:35] not like they're pissed at Chuck.

[25:37] They agree to it.

[25:38] They knew it was non-refundable, so it's not like he changed the game on people, but they're

[25:43] just going to be pissed at themselves that they went in early on a game, that they never

[25:47] played, and now they don't want, or something happened in their life financially, and they

[25:51] can't afford it, and they lose the money.

[25:54] And I just don't think those negative vibes will do this company any good.

[25:58] All right, it's just not going to, I don't think it's going to work out.

[26:01] I really don't.

[26:02] If Chuck were smart, smarter about this situation, I think he would have just made one version

[26:08] of the game, and the only thing you can customize maybe is the butter cabinet decals, but you

[26:14] know, that's it.

[26:15] But for the most part, if you make one version of the game without a lot of options, then

[26:20] people don't have to customize, and you don't get stuck holding someone's custom order.

[26:26] But we'll see what happens.

[26:27] I just want people to get this game, because more than anything, I want people to let

[26:33] us know how good it is or not.

[26:35] And real, you know, honest people, I want a crazy levy to tell me how it shoots.

[26:39] All right, all right.

[26:41] Well, look, let's talk about Godzilla for a second, because I don't get this part of

[26:46] the whole spooky narrative, because I was reading this.

[26:49] And look, you have to ask yourself, how did Stern know about Toto Godzilla, whatever

[26:57] the company is?

[26:58] Like the obscure Godzilla license that Stern went in and took from Charlie.

[27:03] How did they know he wanted to make that game?

[27:08] How did they know he was going after it?

[27:09] Right?

[27:10] So here's how they knew, because Charlie spoke about it.

[27:14] Like he talks.

[27:16] And it's like he doesn't understand that he's actually in a competitive business.

[27:22] That his competition, if they know his intentions, will hurt him.

[27:28] Will use that information to screw him.

[27:30] And look, he lost his dream theme.

[27:34] Because of that, it's like he couldn't keep his mouth shut about it and go get the license.

[27:39] Instead, he told people, and what happened?

[27:42] The license is gone now.

[27:44] And not only that, Stern's making it.

[27:47] It must be like the biggest slap in the face, kick to the gut.

[27:52] I mean, imagine losing your dream theme to this big competitor, all because you couldn't

[28:00] just go get it without speaking up.

[28:03] And that's what happens with, and such is Charlie that does this.

[28:07] So many people talk and blab and speak.

[28:11] So they go to shows, they go to people's parties, they drink, and they open their mouth about

[28:16] the next titles.

[28:18] Jack does it all the time.

[28:20] He does it all the time.

[28:22] Charlie does it all the time.

[28:24] You know, they always have to like share with who they think are their confidants, the

[28:29] news.

[28:30] But here's a problem.

[28:31] Nothing ever remains a secret in this hobby.

[28:34] And Terry at Pimball Life knows everybody's secrets.

[28:37] Do you want to go to a source who knows what's happening everywhere?

[28:42] It's him because he gets everybody their parts for the most part.

[28:45] And he knows what they're working on.

[28:48] And look, you should make people sign non-disclosure agreements.

[28:51] Everyone who works for a Pimball Company should be under NDA.

[28:54] And you've got to take those NDA seriously.

[28:57] I mean, they are ironclad.

[28:59] They can help a company.

[29:02] And for these smaller boutiques, they can almost put a Pimball Company out of business.

[29:07] If it costs them titles that would have been huge hits for them, especially if you lose

[29:12] it to a competitor.

[29:13] But here's the part about Charlie.

[29:15] I just don't get.

[29:16] I just don't get.

[29:18] He said something on his podcast that he knows who's making God's Zilla Pimball.

[29:23] And he was sort of waving that around like it's some badge of honor.

[29:26] And he's like, I bet other Pimball podcasts would love to know who's making God's Zilla

[29:31] Pimball.

[29:32] And Charlie, I hate to break it to you.

[29:34] That's like kind of saying, hey man, I know who's going to bang my girlfriend.

[29:39] I know who's going to bang her.

[29:40] And I bet you would love to know too.

[29:43] It's like, man, that's not really something you should be boasting about.

[29:49] It's actually kind of sad that Stern is making your dream theme.

[29:54] All right, Noah.

[29:55] Maybe you have to spin it in your head somehow to feel better about it.

[29:59] But it's a humongous blow.

[30:01] And I think it hopefully will wake Charlie up to the fact that nobody out there who's

[30:06] trying to sell games at the same time he is wants him to succeed over them.

[30:13] It's competition.

[30:15] All right, it's competition.

[30:17] The fact that he offered to help Stern make this game.

[30:21] I think that says what you need to know about where his mindset is in this world.

[30:29] This is not, we are the world, Charlie.

[30:31] This is not like everyone band together to help third world countries.

[30:36] You're trying to sell a Pimball machine, Charlie, to white or upper middle class wealthy

[30:43] men who have money to burn.

[30:46] This is not charity work.

[30:48] All right, you have to understand that.

[30:50] Okay.

[30:51] Now speaking of rumors and spooky though, so maybe the reason why Chuck is saying he's

[30:55] not devastated completely about the loss of God.

[30:57] Zilla is I'm hearing that the theme they secured, which is the theme they want it that I'm

[31:04] pretty, you know, I hear they're going to make this game.

[31:07] If he says otherwise, but I heard that spooky Pimball is going to be making stranger things

[31:15] Pimball, stranger things.

[31:17] So that is the rumor I'm hearing that that spooky Pimball has secured the license to

[31:22] stranger things.

[31:24] I may be wrong, but that is what I'm hearing in Pimball.

[31:28] All right, let's see.

[31:31] I was going to talk about how Hilton considers Charlie to be like this amazing son of a

[31:39] I just I'm not even going to give the guy airtime.

[31:41] All right, let's go to Jersey Jack Pimball.

[31:43] So at the Vancouver show, I heard that Jersey Jack asked Jack danger to stream pirates

[31:50] of the Caribbean.

[31:51] And he asked Jack to do it.

[31:52] He knows Jack's popularity.

[31:54] He knows a lot of people watch Dead Flip.

[31:56] I want to say that when Jack streamed Deadpool, he had 9,000 people watching live, which is

[32:03] incredible.

[32:04] It's probably the most amount of people watching Pimball live at one time.

[32:09] It's also a very, very low number when you look at major video game streams and it's like

[32:15] in the millions.

[32:16] But anyway, anyway, we won't go there.

[32:17] We'll let you guys feel like Pimball's back.

[32:20] I know you have this desire to feel like Pimball is like relevant and back in 2018.

[32:24] I hate to break it to you.

[32:26] It's not.

[32:27] All right, anyway, so he streams the show at the Vancouver show.

[32:30] I was watching the stream from the very beginning.

[32:33] And what happens?

[32:34] What happens?

[32:35] Okay, so let's let's talk about this from the perspective of Jack is doing Jack at Jersey

[32:41] Jack.

[32:42] How many Jacks can I say in one sentence?

[32:44] A game about Jack Sparrow.

[32:46] He's doing him a favor by doing the stream.

[32:48] Okay.

[32:50] So here's what happens when Jack danger goes to start playing the game.

[32:54] What happens?

[32:55] There's absolute total confusion on what to do in the game, which is all right.

[32:59] It's a new Pimball machine.

[33:02] But nothing.

[33:03] All right, when you walk up to this game, nothing about how to play the game is intuitive.

[33:07] You just don't know what to do.

[33:10] And it's kind of comical because Jack was surrounded by a few people.

[33:13] He was playing a four person game.

[33:15] And everyone was sort of chiming in and trying to explain what to do.

[33:20] But I still, you could see it on Jack's face.

[33:22] He was just kind of confused as to what to do.

[33:25] Now here's the part I don't get.

[33:26] If you're Jersey Jack and you want him to stream your game live for people, remember,

[33:32] these videos go live.

[33:33] But then they also live forever on the internet.

[33:35] You would think Jack would have gone over with Jack danger and explained to him how to play

[33:43] the game.

[33:44] All right, that's what you do.

[33:46] That's called the marketing.

[33:47] You don't let the media go off and try to figure it out on their own.

[33:53] And now you've got a stream that's all about reinforcing what I've been saying on this

[33:58] podcast.

[33:59] What others have said that Pirates the Caribbean isn't overly complex sort of mess.

[34:06] That there's just too much going on in the game.

[34:09] And it's too hard to figure out how to play this Pimball machine.

[34:12] Nothing about it is intuitive.

[34:14] And so then Jack danger goes and basically reinforces all of that because you left him to go figure

[34:21] it out on his own.

[34:23] And that's the problem.

[34:24] Then you've got this chat screen open where everyone's trying to explain what to do.

[34:30] But it's just not intuitive.

[34:33] All right.

[34:34] I mean, and if anyone's going to figure out or should be able to figure out how to play

[34:38] a game without needing an instruction booklet, you'd think it'd be Jack.

[34:42] Jack danger since he plays Pimball basically for a living and think about it like this.

[34:48] If the game is inherently confusing to him, what do you think it will be like to a stranger

[34:55] who walks up to that game on location?

[34:57] All right.

[34:58] The other part that just like ridiculous and this just goes to show.

[35:02] I just can't get over this part of the game.

[35:05] The 22 character selection screen when you're playing with four people at a Pimball show

[35:12] is the biggest buzzkill ever.

[35:15] Ever.

[35:16] I've never seen a game have a more long winded way to get into the game.

[35:22] And the reason why it's so stupid is this.

[35:24] You've got 22 characters.

[35:26] It's not like when you play Street Fighter.

[35:27] All right.

[35:28] Think about a video game where there's character selection.

[35:30] Okay.

[35:31] There's usually a clock that counts down for like 10 seconds.

[35:34] You got to pick your character.

[35:35] When you go over your character in a Street Fighter game, does it tell you like the benefits

[35:41] of each character?

[35:42] No.

[35:43] You just, you know how each character's fighting style is R and what their moves are.

[35:47] You just know that.

[35:49] And so they literally don't have a countdown clock on the character select screen because

[35:54] you have to go over each and every one of them and read the benefits.

[35:59] And then you have to memorize 22 different benefits for characters.

[36:04] I literally, I think that one thing to me shows how ridiculous the concept was of

[36:11] of the coding of this game.

[36:13] And I think it's a complete failure.

[36:14] An absolute failure to code 22 character selects into a game.

[36:19] I mean, you play Deadpool, you're Deadpool, you play Batman and Robin, you're Batman and

[36:22] Robin.

[36:23] I don't understand this concept of a movie about Jack Sparrow.

[36:27] He's the main character.

[36:28] There's a main character.

[36:30] So you add 22 other characters to select from.

[36:33] And it's like so many of them are just obscure.

[36:35] I mean, these aren't even characters people will even remember or know about.

[36:39] You know, I just, look, I'll say something nice about the game.

[36:42] The game looks beautiful.

[36:44] The game looks absolutely gorgeous.

[36:46] It films so nice.

[36:48] The light show is incredible.

[36:51] It makes a stern light show embarrassing in comparison.

[36:54] The game looks great.

[36:56] It looks great.

[36:57] And that's why I'm saying the game's issue is not like what Eric did.

[37:03] All right, it's not.

[37:05] I mean, yes, I wish there was three spinning this, but the game is gorgeous looking.

[37:09] And the game's issue is Keith just went overboard.

[37:13] All right, every time I see the ball roll off the top of the upper play field to the right,

[37:19] I just, I just like, it's like a metaphor for there's too much in this game.

[37:24] The other part that I just like, it's like the compass on the apron to me is another

[37:28] example of just this game going overboard.

[37:30] It's like, they just felt like they had to keep putting stuff in.

[37:34] Like, first of all, if that's a compass, why is it a rectangle?

[37:38] Like, I don't get it.

[37:40] I don't get it.

[37:41] A compass is round.

[37:42] Like it's just little things like that, little details like that are just, they just,

[37:46] it just seems so poor to me to like not, like you don't need it either.

[37:51] Like you could take out that little compass on the apron and I keep asking people, why

[37:56] why isn't even there?

[37:57] Like I play the game so much and you don't, you don't really have time to look at it.

[38:02] The only time you can look at it is if you're trapping the ball.

[38:06] Okay, but then if your ball's trapped and you want something to indicate to you, what

[38:11] the best shot in the game is to hit.

[38:14] Okay, well, you know, lucky for us in Pimball, there's something called inserts and lights

[38:21] that could indicate to you, which shot is the best one.

[38:25] So why do you need a compass on the apron that's telling you what to shoot at when the

[38:31] lights and the inserts could do that?

[38:34] Well, maybe you need that because you've got like 250 inserts that are all blanking at

[38:38] once in this game.

[38:39] Okay, but if the ball's trapped, couldn't you also put that on the big LCD screen?

[38:46] Do you really need another screen?

[38:48] You see what I'm saying?

[38:49] Or you could do the other thing that's that happens in Pimball.

[38:52] You could do a call out, which tells you, you're best shot maybe is this, whatever.

[38:59] You know what I'm saying?

[39:00] It's just too much.

[39:02] It's like they keep thinking the more we put into a game, the more we code into the game,

[39:07] the more inserts we put into the game, the more this, the more that, more, more, more,

[39:10] more, more, more equals a better Pimball experience.

[39:13] And I'm sorry, but this game has too much in it.

[39:18] They went overboard and it doesn't add up, all right, to a better experience.

[39:24] Speaking of the sales of JJP and where I think this game will fall, Jersey Jack for some

[39:32] unknown reason, announced sales numbers at the Vancouver show.

[39:38] Now if there's another practice that Stern Pimball never does, never does, you'll never

[39:44] see them do this.

[39:46] If this, this is, and this is another practice coming from the most successful Pimball company

[39:54] in the world.

[39:55] And why would you do something like reveal your numbers?

[40:00] There's a reason Stern doesn't reveal its numbers, but Jersey Jack reveals his numbers.

[40:05] And it doesn't make any sense why he would do this because here's why it makes no sense.

[40:10] He basically said we sold 4,000 Wizard of Oz Pimball machines.

[40:17] We sold 2,000 hobbits.

[40:22] We sold 1,600 dialed in.

[40:27] Now here's Pirates of the Caribbean.

[40:29] Okay, so what Jack is basically saying is that with every game they keep going down in

[40:39] sales, demand for his product keeps shrinking.

[40:44] All right, why would you tell people that?

[40:47] Why would you tell people that?

[40:49] You went from being successful to like basically, if basically saying hobbit was a flop, dialed

[40:58] in is the biggest flop in this company's history.

[41:01] We need to talk about the fact that you can't, this is why I say October Fest is going to

[41:06] flop too because it doesn't matter how good your Pimball machine is.

[41:09] Dialed in is one of the greatest Pimball machines ever designed.

[41:12] It flopped completely.

[41:16] I would argue that dialed in didn't just flop because of the theme.

[41:20] I think dialed in flopped because the game is not funny enough.

[41:24] The sense of humor in that game is just not there.

[41:27] I think they missed integrating it right.

[41:31] The theme is what it is.

[41:34] But whenever I play dialed in, it just feels flat.

[41:36] It just feels emotionless.

[41:37] It feels soulless.

[41:38] There's something about that game that just doesn't connect.

[41:41] It doesn't pull you in with the call outs and with what's going on and the characters

[41:46] and all that stuff.

[41:47] Okay.

[41:48] But basically, the theme is really important.

[41:51] The fact that they spent five years and spent God knows how much money making dialed in

[41:57] ordered God knows how many parts for dialed in.

[42:00] How many parts do you think Jack ordered?

[42:02] Do you think he thought I've got Pat Lawler.

[42:05] I'm going to let him make a machine for five years.

[42:08] I'm going to let him do dialed in.

[42:10] I'm not going to tell him the change of theme.

[42:12] I'm not going to ask him to make Toy Story first.

[42:14] I'm not going to do anything that makes sense.

[42:16] I'm going to let him go off on his own and release a game that's going to be a total

[42:21] sales flop.

[42:23] The reason why it's a flop is, again, Pat Lawler, five years in the making, Standard

[42:28] Body Jersey Jack Pin.

[42:30] He had the pinball world waiting to throw money at this game.

[42:35] He had the pinball world waiting to buy it and they passed.

[42:39] I think that Pirates of the Caribbean is going to end up somewhere around Hobbit dialed in.

[42:47] I don't think it's going to be successful.

[42:49] I don't think it's going to get anywhere near Wizard of Oz sales.

[42:53] It's not just about a time thing.

[42:54] I think Wizard of Oz, if you look at all their games, to date, it's still the best theme

[43:02] integration pinball machine he's ever released.

[43:06] I'll say this.

[43:07] You play Wizard of Oz.

[43:09] You see clips from the Wizard of Oz movie.

[43:13] All the callouts are from the movie.

[43:15] It doesn't feel one dimension on the way Pirates is going to feel.

[43:18] You don't really feel like you're playing the movies.

[43:21] You don't.

[43:24] It's just not going to.

[43:25] You can't do that.

[43:26] The LCD, the way it is, Hobbit has great theme integration too.

[43:32] Hobbit's failure was that the movie sucked.

[43:35] People won't admit this, but the Hobbit films were terrible.

[43:38] They left the bad taste in everyone's mouth who liked Lord of the Rings franchise.

[43:43] Terrible films.

[43:44] That goes a long way.

[43:45] They're making a game based on movies that people just don't like.

[43:49] When you see clips from the Hobbit movies, they don't move you the way clips from the Lord

[43:54] of the Rings films move you.

[43:56] I also think Hobbit's design is pretty atrocious.

[44:00] Let's be honest.

[44:01] All of that world coming to life, and they literally gave us a puppet head dragon.

[44:10] I think Smog was the main reason.

[44:12] People saw that dragon, and Jack had been boasting about how people were going to be blown

[44:18] away by the Smog toy.

[44:20] The fact that it wasn't even a bash toy and it was just like a little talking puppet head,

[44:26] I think once people saw that, the air left the room, the wind left the sails.

[44:33] People's enthusiasm for Hobbit just dissipated.

[44:37] The game was just not a very good shooter.

[44:40] It's not very interesting layout.

[44:43] But still, it's sold better than dialed in, which is probably one of the greatest pinball

[44:47] designs we've seen in a long time.

[44:50] It just goes to show how important theme is.

[44:53] I think, look, Pirates of the Caribbean, again, if you think about how important theme is,

[44:57] this is not a movie franchise.

[45:00] People love anymore.

[45:02] There's no enthusiasm for it.

[45:03] It won't go down the first couple films, maybe.

[45:07] But even so, Johnny Depp's popularity is at an all time low.

[45:11] People don't talk about this game.

[45:14] These movies won't go down as classics for much longer, maybe only the first film.

[45:19] And again, if they only made the first film into a pinball game again, but in a modern

[45:25] spin, that would have been better.

[45:27] I think trying to make a game based on five movies is too much, and that's why we got

[45:32] this overly complex mess.

[45:35] And that's my opinion about the game.

[45:36] Now if you like the game, go buy it.

[45:39] We all want Jersey Jack to succeed.

[45:42] We do.

[45:43] All of us do, because we know they're going to make such amazing games.

[45:46] Like, yeah, we're all always excited for the next game.

[45:49] The next Jersey Jack game is always the one we really want.

[45:52] I just want the future games that we imagine to be as good as the present games they deliver.

[46:00] And that's always been my problem with Jersey Jack.

[46:03] Because they always fail to meet our high expectations of the company.

[46:10] You know, will he want to better be fucking amazing because we expect it to be, but nothing.

[46:15] And I mean this, nothing.

[46:17] I think has people more excited than Pat Lawler making toy story.

[46:23] And I think it was really bad news when they decided to switch the two releases.

[46:30] And I think the reason they switched it, and I'm hearing this, is they don't have the

[46:33] license for toy story the way they do for Wanka.

[46:38] And Jack is fearful to launch another game without the voices from the actors and the clips

[46:43] from the movie.

[46:44] Because imagine a clip from a toy story movie.

[46:47] Okay, imagine that without Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.

[46:54] I mean, imagine that.

[46:56] It just won't.

[46:59] You can't do that.

[47:00] You can't take an iconic movie scene and change the voices in it.

[47:04] It would just be horrible.

[47:05] And I think he's up against that again with toy story.

[47:08] So I just, I just get worried.

[47:11] I'm worried, but you know, as we said, he's got the billionaire investor and all that.

[47:15] And nothing really matters because Jersey Jack can keep losing money on every game.

[47:19] And they're going to be okay.

[47:20] Here's the thing though, if I was this billionaire investor and I'm looking at these sales

[47:24] numbers.

[47:25] Because think about when this guy got on board.

[47:26] He got on board to bail them out to get to a habit, right?

[47:31] Because we were not going to see Hobbit.

[47:33] Everyone needs to understand that this company should have gone out of business after just

[47:39] one title.

[47:41] One title.

[47:42] They lost.

[47:43] They were out of money.

[47:44] They could not afford to make the Hobbit.

[47:45] So this guy bails them out and then sees that the Hobbit didn't sell well.

[47:51] Okay.

[47:53] He goes on to get them financially ready to release dialed in.

[47:58] It flops for the most part.

[48:00] And this is why Jack had to show pirates early because the guy was just getting fed up

[48:05] because the Hobbit, you know, dialed in sales aren't through the roof.

[48:08] Hobbit sales aren't great.

[48:09] And then okay, but we're going to show pirates the Caribbean and Jack shows it almost a year

[48:13] early and now sales demand for that game is all but dried up.

[48:18] And so I just think again, it's kind of comical.

[48:21] Now you know what's even more funny is that during his seminar, Jack said to the crowd

[48:27] and I'm paraphrasing.

[48:28] He said, we're at the point now where we reveal a game and then ship it.

[48:33] That's where Jersey Jack Pimball is at.

[48:36] And our good friend Jonathan Justin from Pimball Magazine stood up and asked him, then why

[48:42] haven't you shipped the pirates?

[48:43] It's been almost a year, okay?

[48:47] So it's like is Jack just like living in La La Land?

[48:51] Is he like delusional?

[48:53] Does he not understand how badly he fucked up the pirates of the Caribbean revealed and

[48:58] launch?

[48:59] He fucked it up.

[49:00] Meanwhile Stern is there selling deadpools, making money hand over fist.

[49:06] And you know Gary Stern and George Gomez will profit more off deadpool than these guys

[49:12] will ever profit off of pirates of the Caribbean.

[49:16] And it's just like, if I was his billionaire, if I was his billionaire and I had all this

[49:20] money, all this money to spend, you know where I would spend it?

[49:24] I would go get George Gomez to run my company.

[49:30] I almost feel like Jack needs to be replaced at the top of this company as the creative visionary

[49:35] leader of this company.

[49:36] I just don't think he gets it.

[49:39] And I think he, I mean I love Jack as a person.

[49:42] Don't get me wrong.

[49:43] I love Jack as a person.

[49:45] He started this company.

[49:47] This is his company's vision.

[49:48] All right, but it's at the point now where I feel like this company would be much more

[49:53] successful with someone else at the helm.

[49:57] They've established the kind of games they want to make.

[50:00] And let me tell you this, it's the kind of games we all want.

[50:03] You know minus the wide body.

[50:04] I think that's another bad marketing decision.

[50:06] But the Jersey Jack quality and caliber of games, right?

[50:10] What they're willing to put into these games.

[50:12] That's what all of us want.

[50:14] This is the modern version of Valley Williams Pimbaugh.

[50:18] And it's what we all want.

[50:20] It's just being led astray with poor management and poor decision making.

[50:25] It is poor decision making.

[50:27] When Jack walks into a room and Keith is like, I'm going to let you select between 22 characters.

[50:32] Who the fuck says yes, go with that?

[50:34] You think George Gomez would say go with that?

[50:37] Do you really think he would?

[50:39] It's like, it's like Keith's motto is, you know, whenever I decide, I'm going to

[50:42] decide to code a game.

[50:43] I'm going to make it so it alienates 95% of the Pimbaugh buying community.

[50:49] No, you can't make these games sort of like the road o' devs and the 1% of people

[50:54] can actually figure it all out and want to like memorize like incredibly long like

[50:59] rule books.

[51:00] Stupid.

[51:01] It's the genius of Lyman Sheets.

[51:03] How much better does Lyman Sheets look than Keith right now?

[51:07] I mean, Lyman's Batman.

[51:09] The genius of Lyman is he makes a game.

[51:12] That within the first couple minutes intuitive things pop out to the casual player who doesn't

[51:18] know a lot about Pimbaugh and you can enjoy his game on a very surface level, very simply

[51:23] immediately.

[51:24] You'll get to stuff immediately, things will happen immediately, it's enjoyable.

[51:29] I mean, think about how quickly you can get the penguin crane going.

[51:32] All right, just two shots.

[51:33] It's moving and you answer the phone.

[51:35] It's moving.

[51:36] That's it.

[51:37] That's all you need to do.

[51:38] Try to explain to people like, how do you fire the cannon?

[51:41] When I was watching Jersey Jack and Jack Danger stream this thing, like no one ever got

[51:46] the cannon shot.

[51:47] So you've got this thing in there that is like, it's so hard to get to.

[51:50] It's so hard to get to.

[51:51] So anyway, look, I just think, you know, like I hope they figure it out.

[51:57] And I'm getting tired of hoping they figured out how many titles do they get to make before

[52:04] they make a great game that people want that flies off the shelves.

[52:08] That is like a sales bananza.

[52:10] They need it.

[52:11] They need it.

[52:12] But I think they need to put a new creative lead in charge of the company that gets it.

[52:17] All right.

[52:18] Let's go on the storm pimple.

[52:19] I'm hearing a little bit of mixed reviews about Deadpool.

[52:23] Some people are saying it's clunky.

[52:25] Some people saying it's not.

[52:27] Jack Danger streamed the premium the other day.

[52:30] And I have to say, you know, I just don't see the reason to get anything other than a

[52:36] Deadpool pro on this one.

[52:39] Actually there's a little bit more in the premium li's that make you want it.

[52:43] But Stern is really starting to do something interesting.

[52:46] They're really starting.

[52:47] It's not interesting.

[52:48] It's just a reality.

[52:49] I think they're really starting to make these games pretty similar between pro and li

[52:54] and premium.

[52:56] And they're taking more and more out of the games to the point where, you know, I think

[53:02] it's, to me, it's not about, to me, this is what's happening.

[53:05] It's not about the pro having more.

[53:08] It actually is about the premium and li's have so much less exciting stuff being put

[53:15] into them.

[53:16] To me, that's what's happening.

[53:18] And when I look at what they're putting into the more expensive versions, it's like they're

[53:23] taking so much stuff out.

[53:25] And I think they're doing that because, you know, they realize it's a lot cheaper.

[53:31] It's a lot easier to get people to go in when the only thing you have to do differently

[53:35] is change the art or change the piece of glass or put a shaker motor in it like the side

[53:41] art blade.

[53:42] It's kind of sucks.

[53:45] It's, you know, there used to be a time when the Ellie's really had like Ellie features.

[53:51] We're not there anymore.

[53:52] And I think because of that, I just see no reason to buy a Deadpool premium or Ellie.

[53:58] I just don't.

[53:59] And I think the art package on the pro looks phenomenal, puts some new armor on it and

[54:02] you're good to go.

[54:03] You'll be enjoying the same game.

[54:06] You know, coding.

[54:08] And I noticed this.

[54:09] It's like how far along is this game?

[54:13] Because, you know, you get like the marketing spin, which is like, well, it's 0.82 or 8.3.

[54:19] Now I think what Stern's doing also is they're using the code number as total marketing spin

[54:25] these days.

[54:26] When you see something that's like, you think it's like, oh, it's 83% done, which means

[54:31] it's like almost there.

[54:32] It's not complete.

[54:34] There's some polish to be done, but it's still a very playable and enjoyable game.

[54:39] But I'm not so sure anymore.

[54:40] I'm not so sure.

[54:41] I start.

[54:42] I'm starting to think that that number is very, very misleading.

[54:46] And the reason why it's misleading is is basically, you know, nowadays when they do code updates,

[54:52] it's only an increment of like 0.01, right?

[54:57] So it goes from 0.83 to 0.84.

[55:01] So if you go that route, that means there could possibly be almost 20 code updates for

[55:08] this game before it's done.

[55:10] Now how long would that many code updates take?

[55:13] That could take two years before Deadpool's finally finished.

[55:18] And it really is, you look, all joking aside, I think it's kind of sad that products are

[55:26] sold to consumers before they're totally finished.

[55:30] And it just, it makes absolutely no sense that consumers have to get these games unfinished,

[55:36] wait years from then to be complete.

[55:39] And by the time they are complete, you're already fatigued about it.

[55:42] And here's why, here's why.

[55:44] Because a pinball machine, you will get tired of shooting it.

[55:49] You will get bored of shooting it.

[55:51] And it's not because you've got through the code.

[55:53] It's just, you know, there's only so much you can play a pinball machine before you've

[55:56] played it enough.

[55:58] And it just sucks that the majority of time, a lot of people own these stern games, a

[56:02] majority of the time, people are not even playing the final version of the game.

[56:08] And they're waiting for it.

[56:09] I mean, as Ghostbuster owners, what it feels like, I mean, with two, three years later,

[56:15] they're going to get around to working on the code again.

[56:17] And you really think there's going to be a lot of focus on that code.

[56:21] So I think stern continues to do this.

[56:25] And you know what, the only people we have to blame for that are the buyers.

[56:32] Because people keep buying, they'll keep doing it.

[56:36] The other thing is, there's no competitor out there that is releasing games frequently

[56:40] enough with completed code to really make stern change its business model.

[56:46] Because they're still making these games the way they did for the arcade owner or the

[56:50] operator, right?

[56:51] Because who cares if you put a Deadpool on location and it's like half done code-wise?

[56:55] Like people are still going to put a bucket in it, play it, drain and move on.

[56:58] I mean, that's the casual arcade pinball player.

[57:02] It's when you get to the home environment where it's really much more apparent that the

[57:07] game is not complete and that there's a lot to go to make it a rewarding thing to own,

[57:13] right?

[57:14] You're owning the fact that you could own a $9,000 toy that doesn't work properly for two

[57:19] years is so stupid.

[57:22] And that's why I do make fun of this hobby a lot because I do think we are all kind

[57:26] of dumb that we buy these toys incomplete.

[57:29] All right, people have said there might be some clunkiness in Deadpool.

[57:33] You know, like I think the word clunkiness is thrown around a lot in pinball and pinball

[57:38] is a clunky toy to begin with.

[57:41] I mean, literally, it's like saying, hey, basketball is a clunky sport.

[57:44] Yeah, it's clunky unless you swish the ball, but the ball rattles around the rim and this

[57:49] and that.

[57:50] I think some games are much clunkier than others though.

[57:52] I do agree that the, you know, it's when the, it's seemingly when the ball like is rattling

[57:57] back and forth, you know, when it, when you hit a good shot, but like the ball doesn't go

[58:02] smoothly through an area of the game.

[58:04] And I think we're hearing that with the, the shot up to that to lock the ball in the ramp,

[58:10] sorry, in the sword.

[58:12] So, all right, what else is going on in the stern world?

[58:15] Lots of monsters speculation going on.

[58:18] We know monsters is happening.

[58:19] The artwork that you're seeing that leaked from Franchise world of art is, is the game.

[58:28] I don't know if they made changes or not that is really, those are really old images.

[58:32] So those probably changes that might happen.

[58:35] A game looks great.

[58:36] We know nothing else.

[58:38] We know it's Dwight on there and Borg.

[58:41] I'm concerned about the Dwight part.

[58:43] I think Borg and Franchise have me really excited.

[58:47] I think Dwight has me really nervous.

[58:50] You know why?

[58:51] Because I heard that Dwight considers Star Wars to be his greatest masterpiece.

[58:55] And I think Star Wars, again, is one of the most poorly conceived game codes of all time.

[59:02] I wish it were Lyman Sheets.

[59:04] I think Batman and Monsters go together because of the Franchise art and it's like the old

[59:09] sort of TV shows and they're going to have all the clips.

[59:13] And I think they would be perfect together.

[59:15] I don't think Monsters is going to be anywhere nearly the game that Batman is due to the

[59:20] coding.

[59:21] Now, I hope Borg goes to town on the design.

[59:25] I think he will.

[59:27] And there has to be a staircase somewhere in the game with a dragon under the stairs.

[59:33] I keep hearing there's a lower playfield in this game.

[59:35] I hope that's true because isn't it time to turn wind back to some upper and lower

[59:40] playfields that were kind of awesome?

[59:41] I think these single layer games are to just not worth the money when you want to charge

[59:46] with their charging.

[59:47] All right.

[59:48] The Beatles.

[59:50] Nothing new there.

[59:51] Nothing the report.

[59:53] There will be a Star Wars topper coming.

[59:56] And you could just add in the sound of crickets around that one.

[01:00:01] Apparently they've sent it over for final approval.

[01:00:05] Congratulations, Stern.

[01:00:07] It's been a while since I've been here.

[01:00:14] I've been here for about 18 months to get a goddamn topper made.

[01:00:19] I can't believe it's taken so long.

[01:00:21] It's absolutely comical.

[01:00:23] Batman 66.

[01:00:24] There's a rumor that they're going to stop making it.

[01:00:27] And I want to tell you guys, do not believe that rumor.

[01:00:31] Don't believe that kind of bullshit.

[01:00:33] That's just marketing hype to sell more games.

[01:00:35] But telling people, hey, we're going to stop making Batman's bullshit.

[01:00:40] You know what?

[01:00:41] It's bullshit.

[01:00:42] Stern is not in the business where they ever stop making anything.

[01:00:45] They'll just rerun it again.

[01:00:47] They'll just make a backgirl version of it and rerun it like Lucy.

[01:00:50] They'll just remake it.

[01:00:52] So I just wouldn't fall into that trap.

[01:00:54] I think you should play the game if you haven't in a long time.

[01:00:58] But I wouldn't buy into that kind of bullshit.

[01:01:00] All right.

[01:01:01] Deep root pinball.

[01:01:02] Our friend Iceman drove by the facility and said it's really big.

[01:01:06] Okay.

[01:01:07] So there's a lot going on size wise with the size of the deep root factory.

[01:01:13] And then you go into the deep root pin side thread.

[01:01:16] And there's just a lot of bickering, trolling, and nonsensitivity, nonsensical stuff.

[01:01:21] Sorry guys, it's like six in the morning or nonsensical conversation going on.

[01:01:26] And I just want to say, I wish Robert would actually get some moderation from the pin side

[01:01:31] moderator staff in his own thread because I just don't think it's fair.

[01:01:35] I think these guys deserve a chance to be successful.

[01:01:39] I think they deserve a chance to show us what they're working on.

[01:01:42] And I think they deserve that because they haven't taken anyone's money.

[01:01:46] And they're doing stuff the right way.

[01:01:48] They're staying quiet.

[01:01:49] They're keeping things secret.

[01:01:51] Nobody knows what the titles are that everyone's working on.

[01:01:54] That's how you run a pinball company.

[01:01:56] I have to give Robert credit for keeping his people in line and in order.

[01:02:01] And that's probably because of the threat of NDA.

[01:02:05] And that's how it should be.

[01:02:08] That's how grown up men work in companies where trade secrets are really important to keep

[01:02:15] secret.

[01:02:17] If I told like, cores or Miller what our plans were for Budweiser Super Bowl, I'd be fired

[01:02:25] tomorrow.

[01:02:27] All right.

[01:02:28] So look, I also think like there's a lot of bickering about deep root funds and Robert.

[01:02:33] And just, you know, people just need to wait and see what these guys do.

[01:02:38] All right, I just think we're going to see stuff soon.

[01:02:42] Tpf, the five days of deep root are going to come up faster than you think.

[01:02:48] But I know a little stuff might be shown at Expo.

[01:02:52] But then if I were Robert and I was him, I would stay secret.

[01:02:57] I don't think there's any benefit of showing anything at Expo.

[01:03:00] I think you wait to show your hand when it's time to make games.

[01:03:06] I don't think early teases matter at all in the pinball hobby.

[01:03:13] They just don't.

[01:03:14] They don't.

[01:03:15] Not if you're going to make unlimited numbers of games.

[01:03:18] I think early teases work if you're only going to make a very limited number of a machine.

[01:03:23] All right.

[01:03:24] And I think that's the only time I would go early.

[01:03:28] All right.

[01:03:29] Dutch pinball.

[01:03:30] There's no news.

[01:03:32] Other than the news we talked about before, I think people are starting to realize that

[01:03:36] it's over.

[01:03:37] Like when the only people trying to work on a solution to your company's problem are the

[01:03:44] lawyers, you're fucked.

[01:03:47] The lawyers will love to give you false hope so that they can keep building you for their

[01:03:52] legal time.

[01:03:54] That's what lawyers do.

[01:03:55] They're like consultants.

[01:03:57] They realize there's more money in prolonging the problem than actually solving it.

[01:04:02] Now, here's what's going to happen.

[01:04:03] The ARA lawyer and the Dutch pinball lawyer are going to go out to lunch.

[01:04:07] Right.

[01:04:08] And what's going to happen?

[01:04:09] They have a very simple conversation.

[01:04:11] So the ARA lawyer is going to say, look, thank you for taking the time.

[01:04:16] This is great.

[01:04:17] Here's the thing.

[01:04:18] We can work things out.

[01:04:19] The only issue is we need $500,000 for past games that we've built and money that is owed

[01:04:26] to us.

[01:04:27] So we'd be happy to move forward if we can get a check for that.

[01:04:30] And then the Dutch pinball lawyer says, okay, I've got 50 bucks.

[01:04:34] That's all this company's got.

[01:04:36] They're done.

[01:04:37] They're out of money.

[01:04:39] And then the Dutch pinball lawyer says, hey, waiter, how many martinis can I get for

[01:04:43] $50?

[01:04:44] And that's it.

[01:04:46] It's shit.

[01:04:46] You're not getting your games.

[01:04:48] You're not getting your games.

[01:04:49] This thing is the biggest joke in pinball.

[01:04:52] Chicago gaming company, Monster Bash remake, are we going to see it September 15th?

[01:04:58] That's the rumor.

[01:04:59] Maybe it's the 14th, which would make more sense, which is next Friday or this coming Friday.

[01:05:04] I don't know what they're waiting for.

[01:05:06] I don't really care.

[01:05:07] I'm excited to see it.

[01:05:08] I think it's going to sell well.

[01:05:11] But I also think that they waited really, really long time.

[01:05:15] Now also to their benefit, we don't talk about the flip side of this.

[01:05:18] It's to their benefit that Charlie and Jack also fumbled their freaking launches so poorly.

[01:05:26] It's amazing.

[01:05:27] It's like Chicago gaming company, Jersey Jack pinball and spooky pinball are all in a race

[01:05:34] with each other to see who can ship their game fucking last.

[01:05:38] Who can fumble the reveal and launch the worst?

[01:05:42] Unbelievable.

[01:05:43] Meanwhile, Stern pinball is putting games in boxes, shipping games, two customers who

[01:05:50] are happy with what they buy and they're on to the next.

[01:05:55] It is unreal.

[01:05:57] What Stern has done.

[01:05:59] Iron Maiden, Deadpool, Monsters, Beetle.

[01:06:04] Just those four games alone.

[01:06:06] Just those four games alone.

[01:06:08] We will see in like an eighth month period.

[01:06:12] Four games in eighth months that you're going to be able to see and buy, touch, feel, make

[01:06:20] love to, sleep inside the cabinet.

[01:06:24] Four games.

[01:06:26] How many years has it taken Jersey Jack pinball to make four games?

[01:06:32] The other part that's magical, you can buy all four of those games when they're all

[01:06:35] out at the same time.

[01:06:37] They're all available and then what happens from there is we're then excited about the

[01:06:42] next four games.

[01:06:43] Stern will show in 2019 and it goes on and on and on and you start to realize why Stern

[01:06:51] pinball has no competition.

[01:06:53] While these other manufacturers continue to do it all wrong, they will show the game early,

[01:06:59] it won't be ready, they'll try to do too much and they don't understand that theme means

[01:07:06] everything.

[01:07:07] Stern gets a theme in art, theme in art.

[01:07:09] If you can nail those, you know, you're in a good place.

[01:07:14] Everything else is gravy.

[01:07:15] Alright, everyone, that was my Sunday morning, episode 260 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[01:07:22] Thank you for listening.

[01:07:24] I do appreciate everything that you guys share with me about pinball.

[01:07:31] I do appreciate all the friends I've made in this hobby.

[01:07:34] I do want to say our thoughts and prayers go out to Marty.

[01:07:37] I didn't know this when I did my last podcast but I heard from Ryan that Marty had a loss

[01:07:42] in the family overhead head to head pinball and I didn't see it anywhere.

[01:07:46] I didn't hear it about it on the show, I didn't see it on the pin side thread and it sucks

[01:07:52] when you lose someone you love and it puts a lot of stuff in perspective.

[01:07:56] I know that's why they didn't record an episode so Marty just want to say, you know, you're

[01:08:01] in our thoughts and prayers brother and I hope you guys are doing okay.

[01:08:06] I mean, that sucks, man.

[01:08:08] I really, I'm sorry.

[01:08:11] Trying to think what else.

[01:08:12] I will be donating next week the money that I said I would donate to the cervical cancer

[01:08:20] for Dahlia again, want to keep her in our thoughts and prayers as she struggles with what

[01:08:28] she's going through.

[01:08:29] That's terrible but listen to that episode because I want to at least give like 200 bucks

[01:08:35] if we get to 2000 listens.

[01:08:37] So please, if you know, support that good cause and what else do we got here?

[01:08:44] Let's just, let's call it a day.

[01:08:46] Enjoy football today.

[01:08:48] Again everyone, it's just pinball.

[01:08:51] It's a fun thing to think about, fun thing to play, fun thing to talk about but you know,

[01:08:56] life is more important and I mean it when I say this, take care of yourselves.

[01:08:59] All of you guys out there, take care of yourselves.

[01:09:02] We'll talk to you real soon but we have to end this episode with this is what the song

[01:09:07] I think that's going to be playing at American pinball when they realized they made the biggest

[01:09:12] mistake and it's just picture the scene.

[01:09:14] It's like Dovel, Joe Balser and Josh Cougler playing this song dancing around in a circle

[01:09:19] as they realize that they basically sunk their own company by picking October fest.
