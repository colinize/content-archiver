[00:00] The internet got everybody going out they mind

[00:02] recording everything just to put it online

[00:04] It isn't on Facebook I guess it ain't official

[00:07] It ain't the public eye then I guess I ain't rich

[00:09] Yes

[00:16] Welcome to episode I think it's like 167 of Canadian Spinball Podcasts

[00:21] I've lost total track of where we are

[00:24] I know that about 160 of them are pretty bad

[00:27] but there's like six or seven good ones in there right?

[00:30] So before I air the interview I have on this podcast

[00:34] I talk to Rare Hero Greg Colton

[00:37] Man of Family Guy fame

[00:39] Awesome Pinball Collector, awesome dude

[00:42] He's one of the individuals who was the first early achievers in on the Big Lebowski

[00:49] He had machine number 56

[00:52] And if you remember about 50 of them got on a boat

[00:55] So he missed the boat, never got his machine

[00:58] And then he got dragged into the shit storm that surrounded Dutch Pinball

[01:03] There collapsed them lying about the board issue

[01:06] They're drumming with ARA

[01:08] All that shit happened around Greg

[01:10] And he basically said I'm done

[01:12] I want out, I want a refund

[01:14] Now most people who tried to get a refund from burying up never did

[01:19] But Greg got a refund

[01:21] So he's going to share the story about how that went down

[01:24] I want you to hear it from the man who got the money back

[01:26] Which I applaud because a lot of people are still waiting for their games

[01:31] And you know you might have seen recently

[01:34] This happened just yesterday

[01:36] I put up my magic role for sale

[01:38] And I want to explain why because you don't get everything in an ebay post

[01:43] And I can't post anymore on Pinside

[01:45] And I saw that Robin took down my ebay link from Pinside

[01:48] Once again Robin goes out of his way to protect Hilton

[01:53] But here's why I want to get rid of my magic role

[01:56] I have a woken to the reality

[02:00] And I've seen things so much differently in the past six months

[02:03] than I did a year ago

[02:05] I only want to enjoy Pinball

[02:08] I only want to have a Pinball machine that I can play

[02:11] That I can enjoy that I can go through the modes

[02:14] And just have a damn good time with a Pinball machine

[02:18] I've always been obsessed with Magic Girl since the day I heard about it

[02:22] The whole notion of the super rare exclusive game

[02:25] Made by this designer who is known for making some of the best games ever

[02:29] And then when the art package was shown

[02:31] I just still feel like Magic Girl is visually the most stunning Pinball machine ever

[02:35] It still is

[02:36] It still is to this day

[02:39] And when I went in on it

[02:41] I thought it was gonna work

[02:43] I thought that John had spent the last year with American Pinball

[02:48] Fixing Magic Girl so that when it came out

[02:50] I would have one of only 20 so games

[02:53] Ultra Rare working John Papaduke titles

[02:56] And as you guys all saw

[02:59] Who is the first one to rip open the box and say

[03:02] This thing doesn't work at all

[03:04] Who is the first one to reveal to the world

[03:07] Um that John and American Pinball sent owners a game that was kind of a joke

[03:13] The functionality wasn't there

[03:14] It was me

[03:16] And I wasn't showing the game

[03:18] I wasn't trying to hype up the price

[03:21] Do I still think Magic Girl is worth a lot of money

[03:24] Of course I do

[03:24] There's still only 22 of them that were ever made in the world

[03:29] So I'm not gonna sell this game for $10,000 and just be done with it

[03:33] But I've listed it for a buy it now price of $25,000

[03:37] Why did I listed at that price?

[03:38] Well a few of them sold for that much money

[03:41] Even after people knew they didn't work

[03:43] And so I still think for the rare Pinball collector out there

[03:48] This game has value

[03:50] How much value that's up to the person who wants to buy it for me

[03:54] I'm also accepting best offers

[03:57] Okay

[03:58] If it doesn't sell I'm totally cool keeping it

[04:00] I don't need the money

[04:02] This isn't something like

[04:03] I gotta have a surgery or I need to pay for a wedding

[04:06] Or I need to pay for my car

[04:07] No, I don't need the money

[04:09] It's up there

[04:10] If another collector would like to have it

[04:12] I would happily give them the chance

[04:14] And the opportunity to buy a Magic Girl

[04:16] Because remember

[04:18] Right now there are no other Magic Girls listed for sale

[04:21] So it's up there

[04:24] I also, again as I was saying

[04:26] I just want to enjoy Pinball

[04:27] And I sat down with Brenda and I said

[04:29] You know as fun as it is to look at this game

[04:32] And I may regret selling Magic Girl one day

[04:34] What was the most fun we ever had playing Pinball

[04:37] What was the most fun

[04:39] What was the game that we came home and we just loved

[04:42] constantly playing it

[04:43] And getting through the modes

[04:45] And getting to scenes and just enjoying the game

[04:47] And the answer was simple

[04:49] It was Lord of the Rings Pinball

[04:51] I was spoiled

[04:52] I got into this hobby in my first game ever

[04:55] Was probably the best Stern game of all time

[04:58] Probably the best Pinball theme integrated pin of all time

[05:02] The Lord of the Rings

[05:03] It's crazy to think that that game shipped

[05:06] With all of those features

[05:08] For what

[05:08] Like $3,800 when it first came out

[05:11] There was nothing missing

[05:13] From the pro versus the

[05:15] There was just one game right

[05:16] There was just Lord of the Rings

[05:17] It wasn't like pro premium Ellie yet

[05:19] The Ellie came later

[05:21] I had an Ellie but there was nothing functionally different

[05:24] The rumors of an extra clear code all that bullshit

[05:27] Same game

[05:28] Amazing, amazing game

[05:30] And so

[05:32] You know I just want to get back there

[05:34] Where I have a game in my home that I enjoy

[05:36] Playing, I enjoy flipping

[05:38] That is why I went in on a Pirate to the Caribbean

[05:40] Now you might say Kinayde

[05:41] You don't even know if you like Pirates to the Caribbean

[05:43] You haven't played it

[05:44] And I agree with you

[05:46] But the thing is this

[05:48] I definitely know that

[05:50] From what I'm seeing with Pirates

[05:51] And from what I've seen from Jersey Jack

[05:53] That Jersey Jack is the company I will be buying

[05:55] I won't be buying any Sterns

[05:57] Until Stern shows me

[05:59] They can make games that have the quality

[06:01] I'm looking for in a pinball machine

[06:03] They definitely have the themes I'm looking for

[06:05] But not the quality

[06:07] I really think that the next two games

[06:09] That enter my apartment

[06:11] Will be

[06:12] Jersey Jack pinballs Pirates to the Caribbean

[06:15] And Jersey Jack pinballs toy story

[06:17] I would love to have those be the only two machines I have

[06:20] In my apartment

[06:22] I get a full featured wide body Jersey Jack machine

[06:25] Based upon a theme that people know and people love

[06:28] And that I enjoy

[06:29] And then toy story my dream theme

[06:31] And that is how I see the next

[06:33] Maybe two years going in terms of things I will purchase

[06:37] If I had more room

[06:38] Of course I would consider buying more pinball machines

[06:40] If Stern makes a game that blows us all away

[06:43] Of course I would consider going in on one of those

[06:46] But my days of just being this curator

[06:50] Of an ultra rare exclusive game

[06:52] That doesn't really function properly

[06:54] I want those days to come to an end

[06:56] If you are interested in buying a magic girl

[07:00] You can hit me up at canada pinballadgmail.com

[07:03] And maybe we can work out a deal

[07:04] That's a win-win for both people

[07:07] My game is meant it's gorgeous

[07:09] Everything that does function

[07:10] That shift functioning on it does function

[07:14] I think I have one of the better playing magic girls

[07:17] I've talked to other owners

[07:18] Other owners don't have the diverter working on the ramps

[07:22] Mine works

[07:23] Other owners don't have the magnet-save magnet working

[07:26] Mine works

[07:28] We've sorted through the lightboard issues with my machine

[07:31] Now they work

[07:31] Now we have a reflashed Arduino and hard drive

[07:34] So it shouldn't crap out again

[07:36] We also can make copies of the Arduino and the hard drive for you

[07:40] If you want it so you have backups

[07:42] So that's why magic girls up for sale

[07:45] I am turning a new page in pinball

[07:48] I am no longer obsessed with chasing after these rare versions of machines

[07:53] That come with nothing but headaches

[07:55] Because at the end of the day

[07:58] If you stop enjoying pinball

[08:00] Because you gave money on a machine that never shipped

[08:03] Or you paid more than you should have for something that you got

[08:07] The quality shitty

[08:09] Or you paid money on a machine that you never even got

[08:11] You've just been spending sleepless nights waiting for something to happen

[08:15] It ruins the hobby

[08:17] And I'm here to tell you all of you out there

[08:20] That magic girl

[08:21] That John Papaduke

[08:22] That all of the stories surrounding this whole fiasco

[08:26] Has done nothing but hurt the hobby

[08:29] Hurt people in the hobby

[08:30] And made people feel like shit

[08:33] You know I was talking to another magic girl owner

[08:35] Earlier today

[08:36] And we were just like

[08:36] You know I'm just tired

[08:37] I'm just tired of feeling this way

[08:39] With this machine

[08:40] I'm tired of John not answering us

[08:42] Not talking to us

[08:43] Not explaining anything to us

[08:45] And you know what the ultimate kicker is

[08:48] So there was a party they had

[08:49] I believe it Expo

[08:50] An honor of John Papaduke

[08:52] But it was a party to make fun of him

[08:54] And John was corresponding back with another magic girl owner

[08:58] About this

[08:59] And he asked John Papaduke

[09:01] What do you think of pirates of the Caribbean

[09:03] You know what John said

[09:05] He said I think it looks great

[09:06] But I think the price might be too much

[09:09] John Papaduke

[09:10] Saying the price on a fully featured

[09:13] Full functioning pirates of the Caribbean

[09:15] Might be too expensive

[09:17] What is it?

[09:17] $8,500

[09:19] Where John Papaduke sold people

[09:22] $16,000 magic girls that don't even freaking work

[09:25] That nothing on it works

[09:27] That is all you need to know about John Papaduke

[09:30] I'm sick of the man

[09:31] I want nothing more to do with him

[09:33] I'm tired of his excuses

[09:35] The fact that he hasn't reached out to owners

[09:37] And helped us figure out how to fix the game

[09:40] You would have thought by now

[09:41] It's been almost, it'll be a year in February

[09:43] These games shipped

[09:44] That he would have said

[09:46] You know what

[09:47] Here's the elements you need to get

[09:48] Like the enchanted hair magnet working

[09:50] Here's how we get the center mechanism working

[09:52] And he's, and he was working away on these things over the last like year

[09:56] He hasn't done shit

[09:57] And now Deeproot wants to bail him out

[09:59] And say they know how to make magic girl work

[10:02] You know what? You guys can have it all

[10:04] You can have it all

[10:04] You can have your John Papaduke

[10:06] It's the pinball community that threw money at this guy

[10:09] That created the monster

[10:10] That now has like caused so much pain and agony

[10:13] For hundreds of people

[10:15] Hundreds of people

[10:15] So I'm done

[10:16] I want out

[10:17] I want to support people like Jersey Jack

[10:19] I want to support people that are actually putting passion into this hobby

[10:23] Okay

[10:24] And that's that

[10:25] You can't blame me

[10:26] I've had a little bit of a convalescence and a meacopa

[10:29] And it feels good

[10:31] I feel liberated

[10:32] And I'm happy to join pinball in the proper way

[10:35] And that is

[10:36] Maximize the amount of hours I enjoy playing pinball

[10:40] And stop giving a shit about chasing after

[10:44] Some shiny fear of missing out

[10:47] Limited version of something that's not even really limited

[10:50] That only 50 guys I'm playing at earth give a shit about

[10:52] Like I'm done

[10:54] I'm done

[10:55] Alright

[10:55] Let's air the interview

[10:56] I hope you enjoy it

[10:58] Any feedback or anything you want to send to me or be a guest on the show

[11:02] Canada pinball at gmail.com

[11:04] Have a great day everybody

[11:05] Alright ladies and gentlemen I want to welcome back

[11:08] To Canada's pinball podcast

[11:10] A man who is definitely a rare hero

[11:14] Because he got a rare refund on a game that nobody's been able to get a refund on

[11:20] We're going to talk to Greg Colton our friend about that

[11:23] And what else has been going on in the pinball world

[11:25] Greg welcome back to the show

[11:27] Hey man what's going on

[11:29] Ah you know not much I'm still adjusting to New York time

[11:33] I'm definitely jet lagged

[11:35] I watch the jets lose

[11:37] But I'm a trooper you know I do this for pinball

[11:40] Nice

[11:41] Yeah I mean I don't think I've ever experienced jet lagged what you are right now

[11:45] Because I I think the furthest I've traveled is Jamaica

[11:50] So I've never actually been I've never been to Europe

[11:52] I've never been to you know there's places I kind of want to go

[11:56] You know I wouldn't mind going to Japan I wouldn't mind going to Australia

[11:59] New Zealand there's some places I kind of want to travel to

[12:01] But the thought of being on a plane that long kind of always just makes me uh

[12:05] Just sit in my couch and do know

[12:07] So it seems Greg that your money has traveled further than you

[12:11] Because your money went all the way to the Netherlands about

[12:14] Right

[12:15] How many years ago and we talked a little bit about this last time you were on the show

[12:19] But you were one of the first early achievers to go in on the Big Lebowski

[12:23] Am I correct?

[12:24] Right so and not only that remember uh I was I was an

[12:29] Order number one on bright pinball 2.0 so I've sort of

[12:34] You know I was kind of an early supporter of Dutch but with Lebowski I was number 56

[12:40] Okay, so you just missed the bow

[12:43] Literally yeah the the last

[12:46] From what I remember the last shipment that came to the US full of Lebowski machines

[12:51] Was up to number 51 and uh there were a few others because I know there's someone in europe who has 57

[12:58] Um, you know because there's buyers here buyers there so the numbers aren't

[13:02] You know exactly the numbers are a little bit mix and match so

[13:06] Yeah, so

[13:08] My mine got lost in the shuffle there during the whole

[13:11] debacle okay, so for those listening to the show when we spoke to Greg last we have to just have to rewind like

[13:18] Like maybe it was like six months or more ago

[13:20] Um, that was when a ray the contract manufacturer for Dutch pinball had just fired the director of operations and there was all this sort of

[13:29] Sort of enthusiasm that that meant that a ray and Dutch would work things out and none of that really transpired now

[13:37] Between that period and now Greg

[13:40] You were able to get a refund from these guys which a lot of people who had money down

[13:46] We're unable to can I want to let's let's tell that story of how that all went down. I just want to hear from you

[13:51] I don't even want to like really interrupt. I just want to know how did you

[13:55] Get money back from guys who claim they had no refund money

[13:59] Yeah, so

[14:01] You know, I mean we could even go back you know, I you know, I was

[14:04] You know, I'm the the hype train and the Lebowski train to 100% I even threw all the the bullshit. I was kind of hanging in there

[14:14] Um, but even within that I would sort of jokingly every so often be like very just giving every fun

[14:19] Just let me get out of this like just let me go

[14:21] Let me get out of this and he would write me back or call me back and say oh no, we can't we can't you know

[14:27] We're gonna figure it out

[14:29] Even going back to you know after expo 2014 when remember when Phil gave that big bombastic presentation and then

[14:37] It's maybe a month later he left the company right the big whistle blowing moment where he was like these guys in

[14:43] Even even have permission to show the game their business practices are kind of shady. I'm out

[14:49] right and when and when he got out he

[14:52] He was in control of dutch there was dutch usa at that point news and control of their paypal account

[14:58] And he basically hit the bomb button

[15:01] bomb not bill materials

[15:04] and

[15:05] Sent a bunch of refunds out randomly to a bunch of people who

[15:09] Had paid for the game and I wasn't one of those people who got a refund

[15:12] So when I saw everyone was getting refunds

[15:14] I was like what the fuck what the fuck is going on here right and and I was I was texting Phil

[15:18] I was like Phil like fucking hit the bomb button on me just give me a refund too and

[15:23] And I don't know what happened why I didn't get a refund, but I didn't so even from that moment. I was like

[15:28] Yeah, just give me a refund and I'll jump back in later when shit gets figured out anyway. So fast forward to the whole

[15:35] You know debacle that happened recently with

[15:37] a Ra

[15:40] You know, so last time we spoke I was get you know

[15:43] I was pissed but optimistic that things were gonna get figured out and then of course that didn't happen

[15:48] Talk shut down. They went and said they were gonna find a new manufacturer

[15:52] a Ra

[15:53] Still had the games hostage and so I would still kind of every so often email berry and say just give me a refund

[16:00] Dude just let me get out of this, you know

[16:03] um

[16:04] And I had already at that point gone to

[16:06] I forgot we talked about this last time, but I went and talked to the licensing people at Universal

[16:10] Just to see if I could get some clarity from

[16:13] Another party that's involved with the situation and you know a lot of people didn't want me to do that

[16:17] Because they thought I would blow up the whole project, but look everyone's blowing up this project

[16:21] It's it's the people buying the project that's on me. They were worried about this would be predators to point out right?

[16:26] Right that they would catch wind to this and they would just hold the plug

[16:30] Right now what's funny is a lot of people were saying oh a universal they deal with billion dollar franchises like

[16:36] Fast in the furious. They're not gonna give us shit what you have to say

[16:39] They got back to me right away

[16:41] And they were very concerned and

[16:43] And then berry got back to me right away because they forwarded my email to him

[16:47] I mean, he's like Greg we got this email from Universal with your email attached

[16:51] Could you go and tell them that

[16:53] Should's gonna be cool and

[16:55] You know

[16:56] Calm this down and then and of course this was when I thought talks were gonna go well

[17:00] So I told Universal I'm satisfied with what I've heard so far. It's a cool. We hope everything works out

[17:06] Your games soon

[17:08] I've talked broke down. I started asking for refunds again berry starts ignoring my emails

[17:13] I start sort of talking about how I'm gonna go back to universal again

[17:16] um

[17:17] And then I sort of casually on the inside. I just said hey anyone want to buy my number 56

[17:23] Hit me up because I want out. I don't give a shit like I just I

[17:26] Basically hit that point where right where I just didn't care anymore like even if I had received the game

[17:31] I probably would have just sold it. I just didn't care just the the the taint of the whole thing was

[17:37] It just kind of it just ruined any

[17:40] possible fun or

[17:42] You know positive endgame for this thing

[17:45] um

[17:46] So a few people were actually casually

[17:49] um

[17:50] Expressing interest in buying my spot and one of my friends who has family in another one

[17:54] He said if I buy your spot

[17:56] Can I send my like his cousin or something? Can I send my cousin over to aria to pick it up?

[18:00] And I'm like, I don't know so I emailed berry who had been ignoring my last few emails

[18:04] I said hey berry if I get a buyer for my spot can they come pick it up?

[18:07] And he wrote back to me where I mean, oh sure absolutely

[18:10] We'll we'll transfer the name and everything and I said oh wait. Well, okay. How about this if you're so

[18:15] If it's so easy for you to get back to me and transfer the name how about just just give me a fucking refund

[18:20] Yeah, right. It was it was kind of like half joking at this point already because I didn't think you would ever give me

[18:24] um

[18:25] And then all of a sudden he says oh, let me talk to

[18:28] Yep about it and

[18:29] And he got back to me said we found someone to buy your spot

[18:33] Um, well, why are you back the money? And I was like holy shit. This is really happening. Is this for real?

[18:39] um, you know long story short

[18:41] They why are you back the money and I'm out so according to them

[18:46] someone bought my spot

[18:49] What was the same person that you

[18:52] No, no, no, no

[18:55] Yeah, no that person it just sort of led me to asking those questions which sort of got them emailing me again, which

[19:01] It got me to sort of jokingly after a refund again, which actually then resulted in a refund

[19:06] So to this day Greg the the buyer of your spot still remains a mystery correct like no one's ever come forth and said

[19:14] I'm the guy who bought number 26. I have no idea so make me so I don't know if someone bought my spot

[19:19] One of the things I kept saying the very just like sort of trying

[19:23] Like logic him into giving me this refund. I said look

[19:27] If you truly believe in this project and you guys are going to follow it through to the end

[19:31] Um, if you really fun me the 8500 I spent on this game

[19:36] Like in your mind if you know this is all going to work out and now you're selling the game for 10,000

[19:41] You can easily sell my name to someone for 10,000 especially since it's number 56 and it's built already

[19:46] You know like that was sort of my logic of like

[19:50] Just give me a refund because if you believe in this project so much that's extra profit for you and you get rid of me

[19:55] And we should all be happy right so whether that's actually what happened on their end or someone actually did

[20:02] claim my spot. I have no idea all I know is

[20:06] I got a refund. I couldn't believe it

[20:09] And I was like all right. I'm done. I'm out

[20:12] So to this day, they're still right. They're still a little air of mystery of whether or not

[20:18] Giving you money back might have just been a

[20:21] A move to get you off their back versus there's an actual guy right and

[20:27] Nope, there's no idea and it's it's not your fault. I mean look you did the smart thing like I want my money back

[20:32] Take the money and run after everything these guys have gone through

[20:37] Um, I think it's your cell phone Greg if you want to oh sounds that puppy

[20:42] um

[20:43] So what's interesting is spot number 56

[20:48] Is built and sitting at a or a now that game probably will never ever

[20:54] Be picked up or sold or transferred to somebody uh, uh, I

[20:58] Who knows that's like the big mystery now with uh

[21:03] You know, they just showed up at expo, you know, you talked about that a little bit in your last podcast

[21:07] They showed up at expo they gave the new plan with the new

[21:11] manufacturer

[21:14] But you know nobody's talking about a array like they're still there they still have

[21:19] Money invested in this project. They still have inventory. They have all these games in and they're plus tons of parts

[21:25] You know, what the fuck are they gonna do with that stuff? They're just gonna throw in the garbage and and eat the cost

[21:30] I mean

[21:32] They're still part of this equation and I find it kind of shocking that nobody's really talking about it right the

[21:38] The ability for a array to jump back into the ring with some sort of lawsuits suit or season to cis on duchess new plan

[21:46] It's unclear right and so yeah, while burying yop would love everyone to just

[21:53] Re-focus on the new contract manufacturer the reality is I don't think they're out of the a array woods just yet now

[22:01] Let's talk about expo because I was like why are these guys coming like what are they gonna say?

[22:06] What's the plan gonna be yeah, they're they're not refunding everyone's money yet. They're spending money now

[22:12] We heard the plan. I mean the plan is basically to sell new

[22:16] Right, it's basically a it's like a Kickstarter or

[22:20] You know, it's a crowdfunding thing technically, you know

[22:25] Yeah, they basically need new orders

[22:27] to

[22:29] Get the thing rolling again and to pay for the

[22:32] Original people to get their to build their games to build new games for the original

[22:37] early buyers and get their games

[22:40] um, so it kind of hinges on

[22:43] Can they get 100 or 200 or whatever

[22:46] amount of people?

[22:48] to

[22:50] Commit to buying this thing at this point, right? So basically where they're at is kind of where Jersey Jack was at when he hit a wall with

[22:58] Was production and he couldn't afford

[23:01] To make the games unless new money came in to build the old orders which he ordered money on

[23:07] The problem is this is there's no way to skin this cat where the numbers work out what they need is an investor

[23:17] Who sees the potential in and getting this thing up and running again

[23:22] Consumers should not be the investors that bail out

[23:27] The company because history is proven that that never works. It will never work

[23:33] And I know when you read the thread

[23:35] It's amazing how people immediately get optimistic again and believe that this kind of business model can work

[23:44] It has proven to fail every time and pimple

[23:47] And you know and I can't I can't be grossed the people who are still optimistic

[23:50] I mean, I'm in a weird unique situation

[23:53] And you know and after I got that refund I sort of

[23:56] I I stopped writing in that thread for the most part

[24:00] Although I did make a comment about what just happened at Expo and of course, you know, I get

[24:05] mix of up votes and downvotes

[24:07] um

[24:08] But I mean these people have to be positive

[24:10] I mean if they have if they have their money in on it, what are they gonna do?

[24:13] Right, there's stop they can yeah, I mean they what else are they gonna do they they have to hope they're gonna get their game

[24:19] And they have to hope it's all gonna work out and I can't blame them for that

[24:22] Do you think there's enough people because they were very vague at Expo

[24:26] In terms of how many new orders do they need to actually get this thing going

[24:32] And they're very

[24:34] They're very vague about that

[24:36] Right, I have no idea man. I mean it's such that you know

[24:40] We're in such a different world, you know, it's funny

[24:42] Just if you think about like almost any pinball project that has started up whether it's p3 or

[24:48] Jersey Jack or whatever by the time the games actually come out

[24:52] The scene has changed so much, you know, I mean even going back to whenever p3 announced that their game was gonna be

[24:58] $10,000 and we were all like what the fuck and now we just saw you know

[25:04] Pirates is what 95 hundred and twelve thousand for the you know, it's almost like

[25:10] now that time has

[25:12] You know, they've caught up to I don't know what I'm trying to say you know, well we're like de-sensitize

[25:16] It's almost to this high pricing like we it's a

[25:18] We're normal now. Yeah, we've run these years ago. We've run accepted. I was was half the price

[25:25] As a collector's edition Jersey Jack game is in 2017. Yeah

[25:30] Um, you know, and we're we're all starting to like just accept the fact that new inbox games for quality game is

[25:37] $8,000 plus now

[25:39] Yeah, I mean, you know, whether we accept it or not as customers that's that's another story, but I guess you

[25:45] They're all the prices are sort of relative to what anyone else is doing at any given time, you know when wizard of buzz was

[25:50] 6,500 there were people who were like what because

[25:54] That's when stern games were about 4,000

[25:58] You know, so and those were full featured stern games now granted, you know wizard of buzz. We all know

[26:03] Was doing a lot of stuff that stern wasn't with the LCD and wide body etc etc

[26:09] Um, but that was the point of comparison at the time

[26:12] So, you know, now our point of comparison is I mean, you know, let's just take the the pirates um

[26:21] Limited edition that's you know, 9,500 compared to a stern

[26:25] limited edition which are one now like 8,500 or whatever so

[26:29] Yeah, 9,000 compared to the street price around it. There you go. So yeah, so I mean

[26:34] You know, I still sort of have sticker shock looking at these things, but if you

[26:39] If you compare to what else is on the market, it's not

[26:43] Too crazy like you can't blame Jersey to act for charging this present

[26:47] Well, he went out of basically went out of business at $60,000 a pop so it's a lot more expensive than people realize

[26:54] Um now it's interesting because with Lebowski, you know, the game's been the game's old now

[27:01] It's the it's the newest oldest game out there. It's been shown for three years

[27:07] And now it's been nothing but a dramatic escape now. I think

[27:11] The real question is this like who in their right mind

[27:15] Gives these guys money like after all. Yeah, so how do you feel good about that deposit? Well if if you're all here's the thing

[27:23] Like if you're in the pinball scene, which is pretty much who they've been focused on and you know quote-unquote marketing to

[27:30] I can't imagine anyone would now we always have to keep in mind that

[27:35] You know

[27:36] These pinball companies they're not necessarily just selling to the pinball

[27:41] You know hardcore enthusiast, you know like

[27:44] You know stern with ghost busters or star wars, you know

[27:47] Yeah, of course pinball people are gonna get excited, but with those themes they're trying to appeal to

[27:52] The random person who has room in their house for a game

[27:57] You know, I can't tell you how many of my non

[28:00] Pinball friends hit me up when ghost busters was announced because they you know they advertise it on

[28:05] You know all the all the like gaming and tech websites they pick it up and start talking about it

[28:10] So these people find out from non pinball

[28:12] News sources and I had so many friends who were like oh my god ghost busters ghost busters because they're big ghost busters fans

[28:18] They're not necessarily big pinball people, but if they're gonna buy a game that's gonna be the one so there might still be

[28:24] You know Lebowski people who get you know big Lebowski fans

[28:29] Who get wind of this and maybe we'll want to just buy it on theme and not know the drama behind it, but

[28:35] Are they even marketing to those right? I think at 10 grand it's hard right? I think we're a lot of the casual buyers of pinball

[28:43] They might be in around five or six thousand to them might be it's it's definitely an easier pill to swallow

[28:49] So you know, it's it's look if you just google search for this game

[28:53] You're gonna come up on the drama pretty quickly if you're someone who does a little bit of research on it

[28:58] Yeah, I mean the internet's forever, so I mean yeah when you're when you're about to spend that much you

[29:03] All you have to do is google Lebowski pinball and you'll you'll see some of the

[29:07] The drama for sure, but you're ultimate prediction on how this goes down over the next like because they're saying this game is gonna

[29:12] Go into production in December. Wait. Is this just another

[29:16] Disappointing Christmas again that Dutch pinball produces for the world?

[29:21] I mean who knows man. I mean you know we've with this project. We've speculated and speculated and speculated

[29:27] um

[29:28] I can't imagine the ship them this year

[29:29] I mean now they're gonna be making them in China. I mean just imagine if like one thing is out spec and they have to you know

[29:35] remake parts

[29:37] You know just imagine if if a Ra pops their heads out of the

[29:41] You know pops their heads back out again and there's some kind of legal action

[29:45] um

[29:47] Who knows who knows I don't think it'll ship this year. I can't imagine. I just yeah, I just look I don't see any

[29:54] I've never seen a struggling and they have a factory, you know what?

[29:58] We'll talk about them in a second, but I like I agree. I just don't think

[30:03] I think it's all been a bunch of words and and when I watch the seminar

[30:07] I mean what always makes me cringe a little bit when I watch the seminars is the amount of laughter that takes place

[30:14] When these guys talk like I didn't watch it, but there's just this level of smugness and like this weird

[30:22] laughter and just

[30:24] Hey, we're all here to have a good time pinball supposed to be fun

[30:27] Like you lost people's money, man like

[30:30] Well, you're talking laughter on on their end. I don't know and like they're always telling jokes

[30:35] They're only they're trying to make it they're trying to make it more of a I get it like light in the mood a little bit in the room

[30:41] But just go away

[30:44] Build a game and tell people exactly how many pre-orders you need to make and what they also need to do if they want to succeed

[30:52] Is say we're only gonna make this many games the biggest

[30:56] Weapon they can wield is the fear of missing out and that it will ultimately be a collectible that might be worth

[31:04] 15,000 dollars one day because we're only gonna make 300

[31:08] Wave that in front of people to sell those new pre-order spots

[31:12] But they're not they're not really sure because they don't really have a plan because this wasn't the plan

[31:18] And they're making it up as they go and I think it's gonna go down and flames again

[31:24] That's my prediction. I don't think we're gonna see more. I think you're right a raise gonna get back involved and be like wait a minute

[31:30] You can't do this

[31:32] Um, and I also don't think anyone's gonna pre-order to get the thing started again

[31:36] Well, if you think about it remember when they announced the the super expensive super limited edition bright of pinbottain at

[31:44] At Texas pinball festival

[31:46] Jesus was that this year? That was this year right? It was this last tp. I feel so so if you think about it that was in a sense

[31:52] A slight variation on what they just did in Chicago. That was basically the

[31:58] We need to sell these so we can afford to build the Lebowskis

[32:03] That went down in flames and now they're essentially doing the same thing but with Lebowskis

[32:07] It's like instead of we need to sell these right of pinbottain to make a Lebowskis

[32:10] We need we need to sell these Lebowskis to make the Lebowskis

[32:12] You know what wait wait

[32:15] Trying the same experiment over and over again expecting a different result

[32:20] That is what all these boutiques that fail do

[32:23] so

[32:24] I think we look I think Dutch pinballs the name we're not gonna be talking about much in 2018

[32:28] I really do I think it's gonna be one of these like, uh, you know great game they gave it a try

[32:33] But they really needed they needed to find an investor to to pull through and they couldn't do it

[32:40] You you guys out there who listen to this show pinball fans

[32:43] You should not be the investors to bail out bad businessmen

[32:47] It's not what customers are supposed to do. All right, so let's let's go into a company that made it through the fire

[32:55] Made it through a period of financial turmoil

[32:59] Because he got his angel investor now we're seeing

[33:03] What I believe to be like probably the best games coming out nowadays just in terms of

[33:08] Passion and putting everything into it and that's Jersey jack

[33:11] So what were your thoughts when you saw pirates the Caribbean?

[33:14] Is it a theme you like was it a game you're a wild by like when you first saw this week?

[33:18] What yeah, I mean I I have mixed opinions on it overall. It's very positive

[33:23] um

[33:24] Let's see should I start with the start with my like what you like this?

[33:28] Okay, so I mean first of all I mean the theme I don't really care about you know

[33:32] Of course most of us were pretty skeptical like why do this team again the movies aren't really big hits anymore

[33:37] Who really cares?

[33:38] But I could sort of see the logic of why they did it, you know the original pirates pinball did really well sold great to home

[33:44] Home buyers and operators and did really well on location

[33:48] So I could see the sort of marketing logic behind that where you know

[33:51] Hey operators remember that game that did really well for you. Here's like a new super cool version of it and hey, you know

[33:57] Home owners remember that really cool game. Well, here's the you know sell that one and buy this one

[34:01] All right, so I can kind of see why they did that

[34:04] Um when I first saw the the leaked pictures of it

[34:06] um, I

[34:08] I didn't think it looked that hot but that's usually the case with when you see these fully lit

[34:13] promo pictures versus how the game looks in its actual

[34:17] lighting um

[34:19] You know, I still don't think the art is that great um, let's just get that out of the way it sort of has that mix of styles

[34:24] Almost like the original acdc pro where you had the hand drawn angus, but then everything else was photoshop

[34:30] Um because as far as I can tell and I could be wrong, but to my eye

[34:34] for instance the

[34:36] You know the captain jack by the flippers is kind of a hand drawn comic book sort of style and everyone else on the play field

[34:43] To me looks like a photoshop

[34:45] You know real-life picture, so there's kind of this right mix mix and match of styles

[34:50] They said they would all eventually be hand drawn um, but okay. Was it a like proto art? I don't you know

[34:58] I I don't know like because I agree when I look at it when I first saw I did look like the rest of them were more photoshop

[35:06] um

[35:07] But yeah, so yeah, so I mean I think what for me when I look at the art I think we're

[35:12] I just wish they I wish there was more detail even just around the characters if you look at it

[35:18] There's just like like a sea of red it just like yeah, it's just monochromatic like just a bold color and I I don't think jack puts details

[35:27] Where there's gonna be mechanisms sitting over it um, but I do prefer playfields that are more like hand drawn in a lot of little details and easter egg items drawn into

[35:38] The background. I just don't see that in this game

[35:42] So part of me want part of me wonders if that's intentional because with the uh

[35:46] With all the lighting effects they can do with the you know color changing GI and all the color changing

[35:51] inserts I want I part of me wonders if that's intentional because again when you just look at it as it is

[35:56] It doesn't look that great, but when you look at it in action with that like choreography right then it comes to life and and

[36:04] Just art as a static thing

[36:07] Isn't you know you look at it in context and uh and it's a lot more impressive. So when I did see the game in action

[36:14] Um it looked really cool. I mean

[36:16] You know, I'm not gonna buy one uh at least not new, but um I can't wait to play it

[36:22] You know, there's a location near me that that I'm sure we'll get it now is um is price the main thing keeping you away?

[36:28] Is it the combo of that in the theme of the game?

[36:31] I mean it's a whole bunch of things. It's sort of like where I am right now with this as a hobby. I just um

[36:38] You know, I mean I came up buying

[36:41] You know my main thing was buying used games and uh making them nice uh, you know fixing them myself and making them nice

[36:47] Um, you know, and then I started dabbling in the new games when

[36:50] You know they they you know, I think I sort of

[36:54] The last Ellie stern that I still have is Metallica and that Ellie was uh, I think I pitched 68

[37:00] 100 for it and even that then I was like man, I really want to be paying this much for these games. So the price is kind of bonkers um

[37:08] Although at the end of the day, it's all relative. You know, I know a bunch of my friends who they're still super excited

[37:13] They they all ordered one already um some people just they figure half I buy it. I don't like it

[37:18] I can sell it no big deal. Um, I know a lot of people who rotate games a lot. So it's no big deal

[37:22] Um usually when I buy a game it's with the idea that it's gonna be more of a keeper

[37:26] Right and for me this theme really isn't

[37:29] Something I'm interested in to be a keeper

[37:31] But you never know once I play it I might change my mind like for instance. I don't really care for the Tron

[37:36] Uh, legacy movie, but that's one of my favorite games now. Uh, right. So you never know

[37:42] I might buy it in the future, but I'm not gonna pre-order. I'll wait till it comes out. I'll wait till I'm be able to play it

[37:47] Well, but uh, it's interesting that people so many people do

[37:51] And I fall victim to this is

[37:53] You want to get an order in because all the deposits are refundable right so you see a game you get excited

[38:00] Well, I haven't even played it, but I might as well just get on the list

[38:05] Uh, well if well, did you did you get on the collector list or the Ellie? Oh, I'm on I'm on the collector's edition

[38:12] Okay, next to magic are everything's a bargain

[38:15] But you know, I'm looking at the collector's edition and I love the topper

[38:19] I'm I'm not sure I like looking at this guy's squid face though. He's really freaking the Davy Jones do like

[38:26] If if I would as if I could go back and I I offer jack my marketing assistance all the time uh as do I do to every company

[38:36] I would have done a black pearl edition as the collector's edition and I would have made like an awesome like hand drawn big pirate ship on the side

[38:43] I would have made the whole thing

[38:45] You know imagine sculpting into the armor and the legs like sort of like the look of the Victorian

[38:50] Error ships that or the pirate ship error that

[38:53] Uh was was period correct. I would have made it all about the black pearl

[38:57] Um, but that being said I think I'm glad that jack made the collector's edition a completely different looking game versus the Ellie

[39:05] Which isn't the case on dialed in which is why I think the dialed in collector's edition

[39:10] Is the ultimate cash grab because it just looks the same in fact

[39:14] I don't think it looks good as the Ellie

[39:17] Well, I probably realized that that they needed some hook for the collector's edition. It should be

[39:22] Um, you know, I'm I mean look I mean yeah that topper is cool. I'm not necessarily fan of the barnacles all over

[39:26] I think that's kind of silly um

[39:29] So yeah, I mean, you know, but I've always been more practical with my pinball purchases like I don't mind not getting

[39:34] Like with the stern games. I don't mind not getting an Ellie as long as there's a premium available because to me it's the same game

[39:39] Right um, you know, so like I have an acd supremeium and I'm totally cool with that. I don't care that it's not the Ellie

[39:45] So if I ever did get pirates

[39:47] I would be fine with the uh with the LA version because it still has all the the cool features

[39:53] You know the star field and all that stuff

[39:55] Um, but going back to the game I really do think that it's really great that they've implemented all these really

[40:01] Unique and new features. I mean those concentric rings are really cool and and I like I like any feature that has a dual purpose

[40:07] I like that it randomizes the ball, but it also it it's like a

[40:13] You know each ring it has a phrase on it. So wherever it stops it can give you a

[40:19] Bonus like it spells out, you know, I'm not looking at it right now, but it's like the first ring says

[40:24] who?

[40:26] Oh, okay, I'll edit that out

[40:28] So the uh, yeah, so like the the rings have phrases on it where it'll say

[40:34] I don't know it says some stuff and it's like all the different things can sync up

[40:37] You different type of

[40:39] bonuses and what have you so that's really cool

[40:42] um, you know the moving up or play field looks really cool with all the the spinners and the the little flickering lights in the

[40:48] In the lanterns. I mean, that's really cool

[40:51] um

[40:52] It's yeah, it looks like a it's packed with like awesome toys that are very original right and and some of them are us all

[40:59] You know they're borrowed from other games from from the past but

[41:03] Never quite like this and I love the engineering in it if you look at

[41:07] I'm Eric who's the designer the game. He's also a mechanical engineer

[41:11] He showed what the underside of the the concentric rings looks like and it's like super but it's like it's actually like super simple

[41:21] It's just three motors next to each other and I was expecting you know when stern shows you the rotating meck on Batman

[41:28] It's like this all right just ginormous like eight inch

[41:32] Vic like a million parts to go wrong kind of thing. Yeah, that thing is insane. Yeah, this thing is like

[41:40] This mechanism is engineered in such a streamlined efficient way

[41:44] Um, it's great. Which is yeah, which is awesome because I'm like this is the right guy you want making mechs for pinball because

[41:51] He's making them so they're efficient and and you know easily swappable if anything looks like it goes wrong with it

[41:58] Um, so yeah, well he said the uh, he said the upper play field comes off with one screw. So that's great

[42:04] So you can so operators could even like just remove it if if anything goes wrong with it and I would not be surprised if um

[42:11] If uh, you know Keith Johnson's doing the rules. I would not be surprised if if he collaborated pretty closely with Eric on this design because um

[42:19] You know, I've read one thing that Keith really likes in games is randomization

[42:23] So obviously those rings offer that but even the upper play field like the way it tilts and stuff it affects the gravity of the ball in really interesting ways

[42:31] Um for for you know, you think the ball is gonna go to one flipper, but the tilts and kind of does some weird shit

[42:37] um

[42:38] So so I think you know, that's just me guessing, but I wouldn't be surprised there was definitely some collaboration there

[42:43] And I really like what I heard about the rules in this game where you've got like a hundred something modes, but he's broken them down

[42:51] in a

[42:52] unique way that every time you play the game each movie will have five modes randomly assigned to it

[42:57] So every time you play the game you're gonna get

[43:00] randomization of content and it'll be a unique experience every time you play also with whatever character you pick will change things

[43:07] So you've got all this crazy customization which I think will make the game really um

[43:13] You know, it'll really have a replay value for location players, but even for home players because every time you play it is gonna be a little bit different

[43:19] Right in a way, it's it's almost like the anti ghostbusters right away where you know every time you play ghostbusters

[43:24] It's just the same goddamn thing every time

[43:26] Yes, someone someone put up

[43:28] You know the modes and also the 22 different characters you can choose from

[43:33] The the variations are within like the trillions I think or billion yeah, so you're never gonna have the same two games twice

[43:41] I think the other but the flip side might be well what if you just love certain modes and you can't like pick it

[43:49] Or you know you have to wait to it comes up randomly is that gonna be appealing because you know

[43:53] Keith did Lord the Rings. I think that's a game where

[43:57] I think it had the perfect amount of modes and things to select and also objectives and also felt like you were

[44:05] Progressing through the films in a way that was digestible

[44:08] I think to me Keith is a blessing in a curse because I also think he adds a level of complexity sometimes to games

[44:16] Well, I think he's he's kind of going insane. I think what he's doing is

[44:20] He's sort of trying to find a middle ground which which I think is cool and I think people will like you know

[44:26] You know hobbit is huge in terms of content and you know, I know hobbit gets a lot of shit

[44:30] I like hobbit a lot and I think programming is really really good

[44:34] but it is very

[44:37] There's there's a lot to get through like you you literally can play all those modes

[44:42] In one game if you can keep the game going long enough and you know some people don't want all times that long

[44:47] So I think what's cool about pirates is he's

[44:51] He's putting that depth in the game and he's putting that content in the game, but he's not

[44:55] forcing all that content into one particular

[44:59] Gameplay session and I think that's smart. I think he's

[45:03] he's he's he's making

[45:05] depth and

[45:07] quicker ball time kind of

[45:10] Work right and I think it'll be I think it'll be cool in that respect

[45:13] Yeah, we'll see and it's gonna be interesting to see how much they said the code was around 20% of expo

[45:20] With all those variations and all those different modes

[45:24] You know how much can he get through third planning to ship in q1 2018?

[45:29] You know is he is this too much right or is he gonna have to like make a lot of the modes sort of

[45:37] Simple and not that interesting to get that many coded for for release

[45:43] I'm not sure I think um, you know, I mean I guess it depends on how long he's been working on it. I mean

[45:49] Again, it's just a theory, but if he's been collaborating with the designers since the beginning

[45:54] He could have had this thing mapped out way early, which would sort of get it

[45:59] Pretty much where it would need to be on launch and I think

[46:02] That's something that um

[46:04] I think that's the problem that Stern has with code is that the the

[46:08] The programmers and the designers don't collaborate early on

[46:12] So you'll have the design finished and the programmer will get it and they're like all right you have

[46:17] Three months make a game out of this and what yeah, right and then they have to like you know play it come up with ideas go back and forth and

[46:26] So if there was a really good sense of collaboration early on that could explain why this game seems

[46:31] Really well fleshed out even if this really stayed

[46:34] Okay, so it seems that there's a lot to love about this game like anything else that you just don't like in your first observations about pirates

[46:43] Well from what I've heard they're not going to have film clips of the uh of the characters, you know the actors with

[46:50] You know lines from the characters and stuff and to to me that's a little bit of a detriment especially when they're so specifically basing it on

[46:58] All the entire movie series and having all these

[47:01] Characters that you can pick from and you have the character likenesses

[47:04] It seems like it would be missing a little bit of personality by not having

[47:08] clips of those characters doing things and and you know

[47:13] Johnny Depp saying stuff and you know the original stern one they didn't they didn't get any film clips from the movie either

[47:19] Um, but they did have a Johnny Depp sound alike which sort of gave the game

[47:23] Uh some personality now they did get a custom voice um, I forget the actor's name, but uh one of the

[47:29] Characters from the movies so they do have a custom voice

[47:32] guiding you through the game and telling you what to do, but I feel like it'll it'll miss some of the

[47:36] The humor and adventure and whatnot if uh if they don't have those clips in there so that would be kind of a shame, but um

[47:44] You know my friends were at expo they've been texting me all weekend and they're like it doesn't matter

[47:48] The game is awesome the stuff on the display is awesome the transitions and the maps and it all makes sense

[47:54] I got some like mixed feedback from people at expo that I that I trust and

[47:59] the main feedback I got was

[48:02] You can't look at the jersey jack lcd in the back box when you're playing the game like there's that's true

[48:09] Right so like whatever's going on on that screen as cool as it is for a spectator to observe

[48:16] It it becomes irrelevant stuff for the guy playing and I think there's a little bit

[48:22] Too much always going on up there. There was like this emphasis on it like that something that is

[48:28] Part of the gameplay, but it really isn't it really isn't the game is below the glass

[48:32] Um, that's true, and I think you know sometimes

[48:36] Jersey jack is still trying to find what's the right amount to put up there to guide you

[48:41] I do see I much prefer just having like I love the compass idea to me that was with the coolest feature

[48:47] Because I forgot about that. Yeah, that's that's great for new players. Yeah, it's perfect. It just tells you where to shoot

[48:52] I mean, it's like I mean

[48:54] I think with with the game that has like so many lights and so much stuff going on

[48:58] I love that that compass is going to move around and and the ways they can implement that with with coding to make

[49:06] You know to add some in it's pace to the game and add some sort of frantic chaos is going to be awesome

[49:13] Um, I also think you know when I heard tournament players complaining about the randomness of the of the concentric rings

[49:19] being so close to the flippers

[49:22] I'm like sorry guys like pinball is meant to be fun. It's not meant to be these like hour long tournaments that

[49:28] You know you guys rest rest out about and you want to you want you want each shot to be predictable because

[49:34] Well, you think does a tennis player complain because the guy on the other side of the net could hit a bunch of random different shots to disrupt

[49:42] What he's anticipating and that is the reality of when pinball gets more fun

[49:47] I think is when there's random elements. You don't know what I mean everyone loves uh

[49:51] Everyone loves the the disc on tron because it flings the ball out. You don't know where it's gonna go

[49:55] And I mean discs are nothing new. I mean no good gofers whirlwind

[50:00] Um tons of games have discs on the play field that that fling the ball around and I don't know are those games not

[50:06] Internaments because of the discs. Yeah, no, I don't know cares

[50:10] He's trying to get it never gonna buy this game anyway like let's let's be honest um

[50:15] Okay, cool. So look pirates is it's interesting because it's gonna go on sale q1

[50:19] It's an expensive game. It's it's Jersey jack's most expensive

[50:23] When we look at the the Ellie and the standard pricing. How do you think it's gonna do for them?

[50:29] Well from what I've heard the the collectors

[50:31] editions of already almost completely sold out so at least from the pinball crowd

[50:37] I think it's gonna do pretty well

[50:40] Again, this goes to the whole sort of like marketing to the

[50:43] The not usual pinball people will people who want to game for their game room be excited about this

[50:49] They might not care about this theme, but then again if the

[50:52] If the reputation is once the game comes out and the reputation is really good. I mean that could

[50:57] That could go a long way um

[51:00] Yeah, I don't know. I mean

[51:02] I'm curious where the world where the prices are are so

[51:06] High it turns away certain people, but then people who want to buy a game

[51:10] It's all kind of relative so if they're looking at a sternly and it costs

[51:15] eight nine thousand

[51:16] They're gonna look at this and be like oh shit. Well, I'm gonna spend this much money. I should get that I think

[51:21] Everything looks like a goodbye when you look at stern as the base

[51:26] Point you know, it's like I don't even know the base points like a term, but like when you prepare to stern

[51:33] It's really hard to say well

[51:36] Why not just spend another thousand or two and and look what you can get if if Batman and Star Wars Ellie's

[51:43] If Star Wars Ellie is is eight thousand six hundred dollars and you put it next to pirates or next to dial then

[51:51] How do you not

[51:53] gravitate more towards the Jersey jack side of fans and I think exactly let's talk about stern because they're they're

[51:59] Expo showing was I think a complete opposite of the fanfare that jjp received what yeah, something going on at stern these days

[52:09] I don't know man. I mean well look obviously they had this huge

[52:14] Probably you know the whole jantrida thing is a huge problem and that's still weighing on them

[52:18] So I mean, I think that not only personally like put them in a funk, but also

[52:24] You know altered their their release plans

[52:26] um, I think

[52:29] um, you know, just just all the quality control stuff the code stuff. I think it's finally catching up with them

[52:35] um

[52:37] Because you know a lot of the usual suspects who would normally buy stern games all the time including myself

[52:42] Just don't want to anymore

[52:44] You know, I'm just not going to I mean even even with themes I like I mean granted the last few games or well

[52:48] I mean Ghostbusters was a theme I like but I passed on that um

[52:52] You know Star Wars. I don't care about so that could have been the coolest game ever. I still wouldn't have bought it

[52:56] Um, but like guardians is something I'm interested in I like the theme, but I sort of

[53:01] I'm not I mean, I definitely wouldn't pre-order it

[53:04] You know, yeah, and like well guardians is interesting because

[53:09] It's coming out like in the next couple months and yeah, they're just can it's gonna just drop on us

[53:14] I think it's gonna they're gonna reveal like in two or three weeks. That's my annoying guess

[53:18] But they still got this Batman thing hanging over them and I don't know if that really affects guardians

[53:22] But I mean if they have plans for other like big like from what I understand and like you know could be wrong

[53:29] We're often speculating and going off rumors

[53:32] From whatever that Elvira is gonna be another sort of Batman situation where it sells for a little bit more money

[53:36] um

[53:38] You know and if Batman doesn't get fixed before that comes out

[53:42] you know

[53:44] The previous games always affect the later games and some people say well this game didn't sell that well

[53:49] So they're just gonna move on and you can't do that because

[53:54] the reputation of

[53:56] One game that means any game could get the the treatment of

[54:00] Being unfinished and being abandoned right so they have to finish these games they have to

[54:04] Yeah, but I think the thing is and and this is where pinside I think creates a false sense of reality for people

[54:12] I still believe that the pinside

[54:16] user and the hyper buyer

[54:18] Is such a small percentage of the stern customer base

[54:23] Because I still believe that there's like probably a lot of people out there who have Batman that don't even know there's something called like code updates

[54:32] Right no of course, but I mean at the end of the day they're a game company

[54:37] So they're they're

[54:39] Talent and pride should be in making a game and a game needs to be complete now of course you can have people on pinside who

[54:46] They look at a game and they say I wish it had this I wish it did this it should do this and those are just opinions

[54:52] And that's fine, but stern doesn't have to you know, they don't have to listen to those they

[54:55] To those people but when a game is full on missing a feature or has a bug that

[55:01] Can can detract from the experience that's something that needs to be taken care of I mean that's that's not just an opinion thing that's

[55:08] Right that's something the game needs um

[55:11] And that's a problem and there's some people who may not notice it

[55:14] But there's gonna be people who do notice it and at the end of the day you're making a game like there's people who play Street Fighter

[55:19] You know, let's talk about Street Fighter because you like Street Fighter

[55:20] There's people play Street Fighter who maybe just press like punch the whole time right they never press the other buttons

[55:26] But those other buttons do stuff right and that's important to other people right so they have they have to be functional right

[55:31] well look and

[55:33] I agree I mean but I'm more disappointed in the buyer than I am in the seller and because

[55:42] How many times does history have to repeat itself with

[55:45] All right, and all these guys just throw money at them like if ster if sterant tomorrow

[55:53] Was like here's jaws the codes 5% done, but you can buy it today

[56:00] They would collect all the money on day one and then there'd be no

[56:05] um

[56:06] There'd be no reason why they'd have to like work hard after that to to finish it because they've already got your money

[56:13] Gary's store bank of million dollars on

[56:18] S.L.E. Batman you think he cares that money's in the bank

[56:22] Gaming interest for a year the problem is he may not care

[56:26] But the people making those games do care and they don't have the schedule and the time to do what they want to do

[56:33] um

[56:34] So unfortunately they kind of get

[56:37] So why not that and I'm gonna cheat communicate better what he's doing

[56:41] That's the corporate culture there. It's not his place to do so um

[56:47] And people are tired of this right they're tired of this always being in the black

[56:51] Not knowing yeah, I mean I am I mean look for me

[56:55] Stern's year last year

[56:58] You know, I've always been a big Stern supporter. I mean I know I've been really negative about Stern lately

[57:02] But you know, I used to buy stern games and tell people stern games were super fun way back when collectors

[57:08] All thought stern games were pieces of shit and I'd say no you should try this game. It's really fun

[57:12] Um, and even when the simpler games came out like iron man and trunk people were saying look at these games

[57:17] They're totally stripped down what pieces of crap and it'd be like you guys should play these games

[57:20] They're really fun. So I've always been on in in Stern's corner

[57:24] But last year just showed me a different side of the company where they where they they got a little too arrogant a little too cocky

[57:30] um

[57:31] You know with cut cutting the quality on ghost busters and the playfields having the ghosting issues

[57:36] Amongst many other issues that that game had and then going into the Batman thing asking that much money

[57:43] for

[57:44] What that game offers and asking people to send them videos to you know beg us to buy this for this much

[57:49] I mean that just showed me a different side of the company that completely changed my opinion of them and

[57:55] It until they turn around from that. I can't see myself buying their games anymore

[58:00] The people begged and people bought them you know, and some weird level. It's like

[58:05] But 80 people did how many you know how many premiums did they sell so they sold it to the maniacs who are gonna

[58:12] Buy that type of game anyway, but

[58:15] You know long-term prospects for that game. I mean how how many are really out there?

[58:19] Right

[58:20] Well, the thing with Stern I think what their new model now is as long as the line is going they don't care what's on the line

[58:26] So if if that mean premiums are selling like let's just announce acdc remake if

[58:33] You know Star Wars is delayed. Let's just keep

[58:36] Aerosmith going you know they date. They've got so many titles and true again a game sold as a game sold

[58:44] Yeah, actually let me just go back to the Jersey Jack thing a little bit

[58:47] I've heard some people saying that pirates is gonna cut you know quote-unquote cut into the sales of dialed in

[58:52] Um, I don't think that logic makes sense. It's you know again, they're manufacturing if you buy a game from them

[58:58] You're buying a game from them. Um, it just gives them more options to for the for the any potential customer

[59:05] To buy a game if someone wants to out in they're gonna buy dialed in if someone's into pirates they'll buy pirates

[59:09] um

[59:10] A sold game is a sold game and the great thing about dialed in whether it's I don't know whether it's sold well or not

[59:15] I've heard it's selling pretty well, but uh, you know, it's their own IP. They can make that game forever

[59:22] Like that game can always be there to be

[59:24] manufactured and sold

[59:26] Forever as long as Jersey Jack exists

[59:29] So it's interesting with pinball. It's and I know it's different than the auto industry

[59:34] but

[59:35] When you buy a car the first model year it's out usually pay MSRP maybe sometimes even over sticker

[59:42] But the third or fourth model year those things sit on dealer lots and the dealerships will offer you discounts

[59:50] um to get

[59:52] The car and you know

[59:54] What if what if you know Jersey Jack

[59:57] Took a thousand dollars off the price of dialed in like a year from now because they've got toy story and pirates going

[01:00:03] And it's just if you want it you can have it for a little bit less than it was when it first came out

[01:00:08] They probably won't do that because then everyone would just like be pissed off and wait

[01:00:13] Well, they they they all technically make games to or like if a dealership is trying to move something

[01:00:18] It's because

[01:00:19] They bought it they own it they need the space for the next game coming yeah

[01:00:23] I distribute or give that discount but probably not from jack himself

[01:00:27] Um, it's gonna be interesting. So like I don't look I don't think that

[01:00:32] Starry is too worried about what's going on at Jersey Jack. I really don't I think they have so many themes coming out

[01:00:37] With that they know that they're gonna be okay

[01:00:41] Uh, I definitely think they're gonna lose

[01:00:43] Buyers in the premium side of the market, but that's not even where their volumes at so

[01:00:49] Nothing really had that confidence with they have that confidence of Star Wars and I don't think Star Wars are flying off the shelf

[01:00:56] I think a lot of people are passing that idea. Gary just said it's their best selling game of all time

[01:01:00] So that's where I'm conflicted I I I feel like Ghostbusters had to sell more than Star Wars or had more orders coming in initially

[01:01:10] I also think the you know, it's the 800 Star Wars LEDs that were

[01:01:15] I think those were sold through to distributors

[01:01:18] I you can still find them at distributors right completely sold out a lot of people dropped out of their Ellie Star Wars orders

[01:01:27] Yeah, I mean, I mean, maybe they're selling tons and tons of pros then I don't know, huh? You know, look

[01:01:33] It's I look if it's their best selling game then I'm then I'm an idiot and they keep doing what they're doing

[01:01:38] First of all, I think it's that's got to be BS because there hasn't even been enough time that's

[01:01:43] Past for it to be their best selling game like there's no way it's outsold ECDC already. There's just no way right?

[01:01:50] That's what I would that's that's where my brain goes, but you know, Gary's gonna say what Gary wants to say

[01:01:56] I think X-code to a lot of people on Pinside

[01:02:01] I think they like to think X-Bode is this like big meaningful show and it's just it's really not anymore

[01:02:08] Yeah, really it's it's more of just like a honestly, it's just kind of like a Chicago

[01:02:12] tradition at this point like

[01:02:15] It's just for all the industry guys get together and all the

[01:02:19] Sort of local fans can show up or people within the Midwest, you know, a lot of people drive drive there from

[01:02:26] You know Wisconsin, Minnesota. What have you?

[01:02:30] But yeah, I'm not sure

[01:02:32] I'm not sure they've ever really like marketed it to the

[01:02:36] The public so much like you know like the Texas pinball festival

[01:02:40] That's like the public knows more about that. It's it's more of a you know, bring your family and stuff like that, right?

[01:02:46] Because I mean I grew up in Chicago

[01:02:48] I grew up it was it was more expo is it was I never knew it existed. Yeah, it was it was engineered

[01:02:54] For back in the day when

[01:02:55] It's our case where everywhere and operators were in the thousands and it was all about showing operators

[01:03:01] What they should be ordering next to put on location

[01:03:04] That's where the shift has happened like that's no longer the case

[01:03:07] It's not like the people own the expel or like owners of like David Buster's and big barcade owners are going there to figure out

[01:03:13] No to get they don't get a shit like those enthusiasts are going. Yeah, it's all consumer-facing

[01:03:19] Or consumer-facing so let's let's talk about a couple other manufacturers going on and like what your thoughts are with them

[01:03:25] So American pinball who Dini they've made some changes made the game look you know

[01:03:31] Better now than it did when they first showed it

[01:03:33] They're coming out at $7,000 and in a very crowded marketplace. What do you think you think they're going to make it?

[01:03:41] I don't know well. I mean again, I think the it seems like the people in the hobby

[01:03:47] Uh, who've had a chance to look at it and play it are pretty positive about it

[01:03:49] So you've you've got a few of those people hooked um

[01:03:53] But do we know if they really have a marketing plan outside of

[01:03:57] The enthusiast crowd are they gonna are they gonna get the word out there to you know like Stern does to you know

[01:04:03] IGN and all these other

[01:04:05] Polygon and whatever to do stories about this thing and get people to know about it

[01:04:10] Um, I don't know. I'm a little I mean my whole thing with them

[01:04:15] Was weird from the start where they you know the whole another jpop debacle

[01:04:19] Um, I mean it seems like they've gotten past that and they've hired some good people. I mean I really like

[01:04:24] Uh, you know Josh Kugler. He's a great guy and and and I like how um

[01:04:30] You know open and honest. He's been about the the whole process

[01:04:33] Um from the pictures I've seen it looks like they've got a decent factory and they're they're starting to make uh make these games

[01:04:40] right, but um

[01:04:42] Yeah, I don't know look the proof is in the gameplay. I mean I haven't played one so I can't really say whether it

[01:04:47] I mean, I'm not really excited about it, but I mean, I think that's more just

[01:04:51] Probably due to my feelings about how this company started. I mean look I wish them the best, but I mean it looks okay

[01:04:57] I mean it basically looks kind of like a sort of a steam punky version of a theater of magic

[01:05:03] Um, right, you know to me the art's not that exciting. I mean, it's cohesive. It's fine, but it just it kind of has this sterile

[01:05:10] Sort of 90s Sega look to it

[01:05:12] Um, yeah, the arts a little flat

[01:05:14] Um, it definitely looks better now that they they brightened up the art a lot and they also

[01:05:20] Added more lighting to the game. So I think that's gonna help

[01:05:22] I think people who saw the game earlier on it was much darker than it is now

[01:05:26] Um, look I think it's got some fun

[01:05:29] Etoys in it for sure. I think there's some stuff in it that like

[01:05:33] Eh, you know, you got like chains on top of pop bumpers. I don't really do much or interact with the ball

[01:05:38] Yeah, it's just eye candy

[01:05:41] But but it sounds like it sounds like the they're it sounds like they're committed to to quality from what I could tell so far

[01:05:46] Mark I think I read that Mirko is making the play fields and those play fields always look great

[01:05:51] Churchill's making the cabinets so that should be fine

[01:05:53] um

[01:05:55] So hey look I wish them the best I just I just don't know

[01:05:58] Like you said, it's a crowded marketplace and there's a lot for people to be excited about

[01:06:02] um

[01:06:03] Will pee you know and especially as we've like even if they've got all their ducks in a row and and everything's legit

[01:06:09] I think a lot of enthusiasts still have a bad taste in their mouth just from all these

[01:06:13] sort of startups who have

[01:06:16] You know

[01:06:17] Just crashed and burned um, but to their credit. They're they're not taking

[01:06:22] You know, they're they're not taking pre-orders years ahead of time. They're they're gonna take money and ship them

[01:06:27] So yeah, I I think timing

[01:06:31] You got to get your game out before Christmas. You just have to like people spend so much money on the holidays

[01:06:39] And after the holidays people

[01:06:41] Keep their money closer to the vest and they cut back on spending

[01:06:45] Well that get that that get that that that gets back to the whole tough thing about pinball like any of these guys

[01:06:50] You try to get into pinball as a business

[01:06:53] Many it's manufacturing you've got to keep that thing moving so

[01:06:57] Yeah, if this thing ships after New Year's and sales are slow

[01:07:03] Can't can they can they sit for a while, you know can can they hang until

[01:07:08] People feel like buying it

[01:07:10] Yeah, I don't know I don't know you yeah with all these new companies

[01:07:14] You got to come out of the gate with something hot. I don't think there's like

[01:07:19] Because once the hype is over like once you you're you're in theaters, right your movies out

[01:07:25] How many times can you ask people will come back come back like

[01:07:29] It's still this game this this game definitely looks more palatable to a mass market than

[01:07:35] Full throttle as far as a actually little game goes. Absolutely, but so they've got that going for them people like magic

[01:07:40] People you know people who like pinball

[01:07:43] Magic goes well with it and especially because a lot of people I might concern with the game and I've said it from day one

[01:07:49] I think the shots are too tight for a casual audience the right side if you look at some of those shots on the right side of that playfield

[01:07:57] Look at the opening size. It's the same thing with ghost busters. It's like you take a theme

[01:08:03] That's pretty universally well-known people want to jump in and have fun go play theater of magic and tell me like like

[01:08:10] Easy is to hit the shots in theater of magic right? Oh, yeah

[01:08:14] And it's super fast and flowy and satisfying and you know the hardcore people go oh it's so easy

[01:08:20] I got rid of that game in a month, but like most people love that game most people especially casual people

[01:08:25] I mean that's one of those games where again when I talk to 95% of pinball players

[01:08:31] They want to be able to hit the shots without a thing too difficult and they want to see stuff happen and I think

[01:08:37] Who do you do is who do you have does who do you have kind of like a

[01:08:43] Like kind of you know what they call a dummy shot like does it have kind of a few

[01:08:47] Satisfying shots that that a new type of player could just jam on and have a good time

[01:08:52] I mean, maybe it's I think there is a shot to hit where the theater is where that LCD is where they turned it sideways

[01:09:00] I but but to me a dummy shot is the is the magic box in theater magic. It's the genius coding like it doesn't

[01:09:07] It doesn't have that. Oh, I know I need to just bash that

[01:09:10] Right and and I think that's just a big issue with all a lot of the new pinball games out there is

[01:09:17] They're a little bit like too complex in terms of unknowing what to do and because for example like if I'm making

[01:09:24] Houdini

[01:09:26] I want to make sure that anyone who jumps on during there's three balls that they play

[01:09:30] They see that ball catapult from

[01:09:34] You know shoot across the play field in that awesome toy on the left side that fires the ball into the box

[01:09:40] I it right you don't want people walking away not seeing

[01:09:44] Like the coolest feature say thing with Star Wars. It's like

[01:09:47] People will jump on Star Wars and never get a single ball into the hyperdrive

[01:09:51] We know or will they even know how to get a ball into the hyperdrive?

[01:09:54] Exactly. That's a problem. That's your main toy and it yeah, you need you know, I'm a man. Well

[01:10:00] Yeah, you don't want your main toy to be

[01:10:02] Locked away for experts only

[01:10:06] Yeah, that's not the way to go. I'm the video's I've seen of Houdini

[01:10:10] I've definitely seen people hit that shot over and over again and the the ball fly through the air

[01:10:14] So so hopefully that's not too difficult of a shot. It seems like it's something that's active

[01:10:19] Yeah, I mean even at like Adam's family, you know thing grabbing the ball that's kind of like the big gimmick

[01:10:24] And that's not a total gimme that's not super easy for for everyone to do right off the bat

[01:10:27] so you know if Houdini is

[01:10:30] You know, it seems easier than that. So that's probably a good sign for new players

[01:10:34] You know, it's funny as when you read Pinside I feel like I always read people being like yeah, man

[01:10:39] Houdini's cool. Yeah, definitely want one. Yeah, total nuclear annihilation's cool. I definitely want one

[01:10:44] Yeah, pirates like I'm gonna totally get it

[01:10:46] It's like people are putting their order in on a hungry stomach and then they look at the bill at the end

[01:10:50] And it's like wait a minute. I just

[01:10:52] Mentally have committed to spending like 30,000 dollars on pinnacle runs

[01:10:57] Well, and that's where I'm kind of at where I'm sort of you know, I sort you know

[01:11:00] We've talked about this. I've sort of just gotten back more into video games

[01:11:04] I've been playing in Tendo switch a ton and just the fact that that system was 300 dollars and the a title games are

[01:11:10] 60 bucks, you know, but I can see there's there's games on the e-shop for five dollars ten dollars

[01:11:15] I'm spending so much time on that and compared to pinball it costs nothing

[01:11:20] So you know, I really haven't had blank pinball that much I've been playing I've been playing Splatoon and Mario Kart

[01:11:26] In Zelda and you know Mario Odyssey comes out next week. So I mean I always remember like whatever

[01:11:32] Tell me right I was remind people

[01:11:35] Greg that you know the best selling pinball machine of all time

[01:11:39] Is like 20,000 units

[01:11:41] Street fighter to alone sold 800,000 cabinets and how many home system

[01:11:49] Million and millions and millions so part part I was actually joking with my friend today

[01:11:53] Like man, when you just look at the numbers. It's like maybe pinball in general. It's not even that good

[01:11:58] You know, you don't wait to spread your story. No, it's just a it's just a very focused

[01:12:04] Look, it's a coin operated device

[01:12:05] So people are either going to enjoy it in that context and arcades just aren't a thing like that used to be

[01:12:12] um or it's a thing for

[01:12:15] You know people who want a big retro

[01:12:19] mechanical thing in their house

[01:12:21] Uh to collect

[01:12:24] That's where it's going to be. It is what it is like pinball is not a mass market product

[01:12:28] It just isn't and really never can be

[01:12:30] What do you so 2018 it's just around the corner

[01:12:35] Do you see this market just oversaturated next year and it's going to be

[01:12:40] Winners in losers. We're gonna all these companies can't possibly succeed

[01:12:44] I mean where we haven't even talked about like

[01:12:46] Newfoundation spookies new games you got yeah right

[01:12:50] Hago gaming is going to show monster bash remake like all these games are going to be like

[01:12:54] Where's the money to support all of these offerings?

[01:12:59] Yeah, I mean at least for people who are already the usual suspects

[01:13:03] You know, even if money doesn't run out space runs out

[01:13:06] You know

[01:13:08] But are you know for a while it seems like a lot of new people were coming into the hobby

[01:13:11] You know from what was it like 2011 or 12 that was sort of the big explosion of

[01:13:16] People really taking an interest in pinball and and sales kind of going through the roof

[01:13:22] um

[01:13:23] Are there more new people coming or if we kind of tapped out? Well if a recession hits and

[01:13:31] From what I'm seeing in my industry and what I'm hearing from financial advisors

[01:13:37] We're we're do right yeah if that happens the non-essential toys are the first things to go

[01:13:45] That will affect the new the new market for sure because um

[01:13:48] Yeah back when the last recession hit that's when stern almost went under

[01:13:51] um

[01:13:52] But what's interesting is you know and I always tell people this there's a difference between the pinball business and the pinball hobby

[01:13:59] The hobby won't vanish you know when when stern almost went under

[01:14:04] Um prices of of the classic and used games they kept going up

[01:14:09] um

[01:14:10] Because you know even though people were being affected by the economy

[01:14:13] The people who collected pinball machines for whatever reason they weren't liquidating their collection

[01:14:17] You know that's really the only thing that makes

[01:14:19] Prices go down is if everyone gets out at once

[01:14:23] Right and and that didn't happen last time

[01:14:25] But stern almost had to shut their doors

[01:14:28] So uh

[01:14:30] Yeah, if if uh another recession hits i mean you've already got these companies sort of teetering you know

[01:14:36] I can't imagine highway

[01:14:38] Making another game after alien. I can't imagine um

[01:14:42] You know even if dutch gets through this labowski thing. I can't imagine them making another game um

[01:14:48] So I think you're gonna see

[01:14:50] A few of these guys go away um

[01:14:53] And then it'll be really interesting to see if if

[01:14:56] You know stern and jack it's still kind of exist together. Yeah, the thing is spooky

[01:15:01] I mean we're not even talking about so right

[01:15:02] I think honestly like I almost think spooky will be fine since they

[01:15:05] They operate really lean and have a real loyal sort of uh

[01:15:10] Like they don't need the numbers that stern and jack

[01:15:12] They've one dollar rent among and they yeah, I think they'll be fine

[01:15:17] They do the only people out there that

[01:15:20] They figure out how much it costs to make the machine before they set the price and then they're not

[01:15:26] You know stockpiling parts and they they're not gonna they can never get caught with like

[01:15:32] With a bad forecasting because they they let the customers set the forecast for how many they'll build

[01:15:38] They'll set a number yeah, we're gonna build 500 Alice Cooperist

[01:15:41] But Charlie won't build or order 500 parts and he'll

[01:15:46] He'll order them as they're ordered and non-refundable deposits coming so someone bails

[01:15:50] He's got that person's thousand dollars locked

[01:15:53] Yeah, and they're and they're doing these interesting

[01:15:56] You know just to keep uh

[01:15:58] Just to to make some money and make some games. I mean whether we like the games or not. I think like doing

[01:16:03] Domino's and Jetsons and whatever. I think those are interesting

[01:16:06] Abinneuse of making smaller batch

[01:16:10] Games that paid for that right. He's not losing money on these these these games are

[01:16:16] Like the diehards will look at those games and be like those games suck their terrible

[01:16:21] Spooky's crap he was commissioned to make those games

[01:16:26] Yeah, exactly to make money. It's a business movie fools. It wasn't this these aren't the games to win pinball awards

[01:16:32] They're not supposed to be

[01:16:34] Well, even with TN even with TNA just you know, this is just something Scott dreamt up and created and they're like

[01:16:42] Yeah, we'll build that it's it's so it's not your usual

[01:16:46] You know, they definitely have their employees and people who uh kind of are their mainstays

[01:16:50] But the fact that they do all these like little side

[01:16:53] Projects in between their main games. I think is really interesting and that's the type of thing that will keep them going

[01:16:58] And I think TNA actually looks really cool like it was sort of off my radar and I sort of

[01:17:02] Didn't care but I was watching some some videos of it and uh, you know, I've always thought Scott was a genius and and very creative

[01:17:11] And I think he's made a really really cool game. I uh, you know, I have some friends who are getting it swap

[01:17:16] I'll play it when they get it but uh the like the music and the lights and you know usually I don't just gush about

[01:17:23] Light shows for the sake about gushing about light shows, but holy crap the stuff that he's

[01:17:27] The the choreography it looks like a like a you're a dance club or something

[01:17:32] And someone is actually like controlling the lighting live like it animates the lights animate

[01:17:37] It's like a gimbal rave and it's it's

[01:17:41] It's fun to be in front of it, you know, it's yeah, it looks super fun. Yeah, it's it's like some people might look at it like

[01:17:50] A casual player who's just looking for like a lot of toys and a lot of like

[01:17:54] You know

[01:17:55] Elements might walk right by it, but I think once you start shooting it you understand like what the whole purpose of tna is and it's also supposed to break up the monotony of

[01:18:05] Of people's collections, which I think it does. So yeah, I mean I like games of all different styles

[01:18:10] I like deep games with tons of toys. I like simple games that are quick and brutal. I think as long as a game

[01:18:17] Is cohesive and accomplishes what it sets out to do and does it well

[01:18:22] That's great. That's all it needs to like tna it doesn't need toys and ramps

[01:18:27] It's it's it's a very cohesive interesting dynamic experience within

[01:18:33] What it has?

[01:18:34] Right, and I think that that's just a testament to Scott and the fact that he did everything, you know designed it programmed it did the music

[01:18:43] um, it's truly his vision and

[01:18:47] You know, when I was talking about how I think it's it's best when uh, you know designers and programmers collaborate

[01:18:52] I mean, it's him he collaborated with himself to make this thing and it's and and I think that's uh, you know

[01:18:57] probably why it's so cool, right?

[01:18:59] Yeah, no, it's you know those those should be shipping

[01:19:02] I think those are shipping in x like a couple months to I think they gave like ed roberton one

[01:19:08] I don't think anyone else has has received theirs yet

[01:19:11] uh, yeah, but it's look it's gonna be and it's gonna be even hard for spooky though with alas Cooper n tna and

[01:19:18] I think Ben Heck's working on another game

[01:19:20] There's just there's so many projects in the works uh, where it's exciting to be

[01:19:25] A consumer and an aspectator to the hobby because I don't think we've ever seen a period with so much coming out

[01:19:32] Uh, and everyone's got better. I mean even in the

[01:19:36] Even in the heyday. I mean even with I mean we're there even this many games coming out one of the

[01:19:41] I don't think they use the William facturers. I mean no

[01:19:45] It's crazy, you know, and they're definitely weren't like dingo berries like

[01:19:50] You know all these other companies coming out being like we're also making a pinball machine

[01:19:54] Like they're supposed to be pinball machines and I'm not saying this

[01:19:57] I'm not including these guys all in the dingo bear category, but I know fast pinballs working on something

[01:20:02] Oh, yeah pinball circus is supposed to be coming out deep

[01:20:05] I totally forgot about that stuff. I think deep

[01:20:07] Yeah, deep room forget it. They're never gonna fuck them. They're never gonna make that's nothing like that's irrelevant

[01:20:12] I mean I played magic girl for an hour tonight

[01:20:15] And you were talking about falling out of love with the big Lebowski

[01:20:20] And I'm at the point now where like magic girl is it is the most visually stunning game

[01:20:24] You know, Brendan I stood back in the lights and the colors and the art

[01:20:28] But then when I'm playing it, I'm like I just I can't really live with this much longer

[01:20:33] Because I don't have any other games if I had like 20 games and it was like a conversation piece in my lineup

[01:20:38] I would definitely have a magic girl if I was a collector that wanted high-end stuff

[01:20:42] But I can't just live with a magic girl. I can't anymore. I'm done. Yeah, I mean it's it's just it's a madman's box of whatever. I mean

[01:20:52] You know, I was telling you the other day. I have I have a friend who has a lot of

[01:20:56] prototypes and one-offs, but even those games

[01:20:59] Like they're way more playable than magic or like I played wizard blocks

[01:21:02] I played the whitewood prototype wizard blocks and it's great like it's not a finished game, but like everything

[01:21:09] Works all the toys work the everything

[01:21:12] Everything does what it kind of is supposed to do at least so far at that point in production

[01:21:16] um

[01:21:18] Yeah, magic girl just is is

[01:21:20] I don't know it's a whole other. It's stupid like you play it and you're just kind of like

[01:21:25] I don't understand how they could shift this game to customers who the hell

[01:21:30] said

[01:21:32] It's ready on any level. Well, that's why I'm still a little skeptical with American pinball if

[01:21:38] If they thought that was okay to ship out to people

[01:21:40] I mean, that's just that's a whole not a whole other story, but uh, we played Hedini and it works

[01:21:45] We've seen it work. We see right. I know it's it's clearly a different production is like

[01:21:49] Yeah, magic girl was clearly clearly like man. We fucked up. I was like

[01:21:54] You know, I talked to people over there John was like in the back room being his mad scientist self and

[01:22:00] When he gave them his version of Hedini and they realized that it just you know literally

[01:22:06] had

[01:22:08] impossible

[01:22:10] Design elements geometrical mistakes they quickly pulled the plug and I think rightfully so they

[01:22:17] Yeah, they hadn't they John would still be tinkering with magic girl

[01:22:22] Who Dini would be off to the side and he'd have a million pieces of artwork hanging on the wall and not one working game

[01:22:29] Ready to sell to customers. That's John pop it up go. Yeah. No. He doesn't know how to he doesn't know how to work in

[01:22:37] You know commercial art or or manufacturing like he he he doesn't understand

[01:22:43] All these things need to work together for a business to make sense

[01:22:47] um

[01:22:48] Yeah, you would tinker forever. You would tinker forever. I mean there's there's people like that in my business too. We don't understand

[01:22:54] You have a deadline shows got to get on the air. You got to start your next show

[01:22:58] Um, yeah

[01:23:00] So

[01:23:04] Pinball mine before we air this for the

[01:23:09] The Canadian pinball podcast fans to listen to and

[01:23:13] I mean not really I think we covered most of it. Uh like I said, it's kind of fun

[01:23:16] You've got two guys here who almost have their foot out the door

[01:23:20] But we're still passionately talking about this stuff

[01:23:22] Um, you know like I said, I haven't really been playing

[01:23:25] Thanval that much um

[01:23:27] But I've been playing a little bit this weekend actually

[01:23:29] I sold my I sold my bride of thin bot which had the two point out kit in it

[01:23:34] Um, so then I'm I'm completely dutch free, you know, I wipe my hands at them completely

[01:23:39] um, and you know, I sold that game so I had to rearrange my game room a little bit and I started playing some stuff this weekend and you know

[01:23:45] I still like my games. I'm never going to be completely out but um

[01:23:49] You know, I think you know my

[01:23:52] My situation shows that

[01:23:54] You can still love the pinball and be in the hobby

[01:23:56] But you might not buy new games, you know, new games aren't

[01:24:00] The be all end all uh even though it's the focus of what we're talking about in the focus of your podcast

[01:24:05] It's not to be the be all end all of this hobby. I'll say this. I think I've been in this hobby

[01:24:11] Gosh, I think like three years now. I think what I'm chasing after and I was spoiled my first game

[01:24:19] In my apartment

[01:24:20] Was Lord of the Rings Ellie with final code

[01:24:25] Uh, completely blinged out

[01:24:28] I love that game. I mean, I love playing that game every time I turned it on I love knowing

[01:24:34] What I was trying to accomplish. I love destroying the ring. I love getting to their back again

[01:24:39] I love the shots. I love the magnetic center ramp ring. I love the wraparound arrogant sword the legalists

[01:24:46] Everything about the game I love you know, you know what it's it's it's the best five hundred dollars I've ever spent

[01:24:51] Yeah, I bought a Lord of the Rings for five hundred

[01:24:53] Unleavable and since then I've spent three years just sort of surveying the whole pinball market

[01:25:01] I I have yet to see a game come out from Stern that has been anywhere near as good as that game

[01:25:08] I also think

[01:25:10] You know companies like Jersey Jack and these other companies that are raising the bar

[01:25:14] They still have yet to hit the right game with the right theme with the right sort of feeling like there's like this

[01:25:22] Feeling you get when you play a game like Lord of the Rings. I know some people get that with like walking dead and they get it with Tron

[01:25:28] There's that feeling that I just haven't found in any of these new games and that's what I'm chasing when I get

[01:25:34] Well, I'll be happy. I have a feeling. I have a feeling and again

[01:25:38] I'm just speculating but if the rumors are true and the next Jersey Jack is

[01:25:43] Pat Waller doing toy story. I think both of us are gonna

[01:25:47] Feel that magic because I really like what you even if I don't you know, I don't think I'm gonna buy wizard or boss

[01:25:51] I'm probably not gonna buy a pirates. I'm probably not gonna buy dialed in but I really like I really like what they've accomplished as a company

[01:25:58] I really like what they're doing with designs and code and I sort of feel like

[01:26:03] If it's a law or toy story if that's the next game. I feel like that's gonna hit

[01:26:07] That's gonna hit all the buttons we want to see in a game right

[01:26:10] I agree I mean like and when people say that they don't like toy story as a theme and it's a mess

[01:26:16] I'm like can we just align on people and shoot them like what what like toy story one is

[01:26:22] Best movie ever

[01:26:24] Toy story will hit on all

[01:26:27] cylinders because you know, yeah, the people were like, ah, it's a kid who's cartoon for five year olds

[01:26:31] They don't understand that this is a beloved movie franchise. It's not for babies. It's not

[01:26:37] Fucking door the explorer. It's a movie that

[01:26:40] It's a film, you know, people make this uh

[01:26:43] You know, they they they see something's animated some people go. Oh, that's for babies. But Pixar

[01:26:48] Uh, is a company that's definitely proven that animation is just the medium

[01:26:53] Um, but their films can be enjoyed by anyone and toy stories be loved it. It's evergreen. It it's it's timeless

[01:27:02] Um, and it's gotten a nostalgia attached to it now because it's

[01:27:05] What 2020? 20 years old now? Yeah

[01:27:08] Um, and a big part of pinball themes that really

[01:27:13] Work well are ones that have massive a tall nostalgia attached to them

[01:27:17] Um, so toy toy story if true is

[01:27:20] phenomenal and I love that lawyer and uh, they need to have you know, they just need to but maybe it would be a good top idea

[01:27:30] They need to have a claw that you have to then like a minichord and you operate to then pick up a little alien

[01:27:36] Three-eyed guy and drop him into like a slot. They need they need it like

[01:27:41] Well, that could even be a play field toy. I mean, that could be like a ball lock where you know

[01:27:44] Cloth picks up the ball and puts it in the

[01:27:49] You know, I hope they can put some kind of uh

[01:27:52] Some kind of loop de loop type ramp, you know sort of an infinity to infinity and beyond you know when buzz went on the toy race track

[01:27:58] Uh, you know, there's been games in the past that have little loops like that so that would be really cool to see if they could

[01:28:03] Not only true or toy story is that

[01:28:07] How much of the fourth movie

[01:28:10] Is going to be incorporated in the game because I think they could just make a pinball machine

[01:28:14] Based on and even just like toy story

[01:28:17] You know, I'm like I get those three movies. No, I don't think they would even need to um, I mean they might

[01:28:21] But I don't really think they would need to I think toy stories one of those things where

[01:28:26] There's so much there's so many characters and memorable iconic moments and content that they could base it on one and two or one two and three

[01:28:35] And not they they wouldn't even have to do the thing that like you know on pirates it says

[01:28:38] Each mode is a movie or something like that they wouldn't even have to

[01:28:42] Break it up like that if they didn't want to they could just kind of you know, I mean, I hate to I hate to

[01:28:47] Tell anyone to use ghost busters for a example, but like ghost busters. It's the movie with elements of two in there, you know, it's not

[01:28:55] It has the elements you want to see so toy story could just be

[01:29:00] Kind of generic in a sense actually spider-man is a good example spider-man is based on one two and three

[01:29:04] But it's just called spider-man

[01:29:06] And it's got the villains from all the movies all over the play field you can attack them at any given time

[01:29:11] It doesn't necessarily need to go in order. It just gives you all the iconic stuff you love about spider-man in one game

[01:29:17] So they could do that with toy story

[01:29:19] It wouldn't have to be based on the new movie

[01:29:21] I don't think at all and it would still be awesome. I don't think anyone

[01:29:24] Would even remotely care if it contains nothing from the new movie right? Yeah, now I mean

[01:29:30] Jersey jacks on a roll and toy story lawler

[01:29:34] Take my money now. They know they they they they can just get to that title that

[01:29:40] It's gonna be the moment where they they just hit

[01:29:45] Bunker sales. Yeah, it will happen and the people love the characters

[01:29:51] Even if you know if they get some custom, I mean granite some people have passed away

[01:29:55] We don't have Don Rickles anymore, but let's say they got a Don Rickles sound alike and he was you know calling you a hockey puck or whatever if you missed a shot

[01:30:02] Stuff like that could be really really funny having those characters talk to you and interact with you

[01:30:07] Well, you know, just like the art we love colorful

[01:30:11] Pinball right and yep and the art package for toy story

[01:30:15] It's just gonna pop like no other in any game room

[01:30:19] And what's great is you know, we always have this discussion about you know Photoshop versus hand drawn

[01:30:24] Well toy stories interesting in the sense that it's all CG and

[01:30:29] I'm sure

[01:30:30] Pixar will give them all the different all the assets of the characters and they could

[01:30:34] You know technically it'll be you know

[01:30:37] Photoshop like if they get the CG characters and compose them anyway

[01:30:40] They want and put them on the art package

[01:30:42] But because they're animated characters and are colorful it won't have that you know human Photoshop look to it

[01:30:47] And it'll still look really good. Right. So I think I think all the

[01:30:52] All the elements are there for a phenomenal game if this rumor is true

[01:30:56] In terms of timing

[01:30:58] We would probably see that game

[01:31:02] What it probably what expo

[01:31:05] 2018 would probably be when the unveil it yeah, it seems like they're kind of doing a one game a year thing

[01:31:12] Which I think I think for them is really good and uh, I heard there might be a game in between

[01:31:19] Yeah, no one really knows about that is being worked on so because Pat might get a longer development timeline in everyone else

[01:31:28] Because of who he is

[01:31:30] So we'll see I think I think Jersey Jack you know they can

[01:31:35] They do keep it up. I think they're gonna corner the high-end premium market of pinball collective

[01:31:40] Yeah, well at least for me you know like I said I've sort of been out of

[01:31:45] The market in a sense. I really haven't bought any new games in a while and really wasn't planning on it

[01:31:49] But if I was going to

[01:31:52] Waller toy story would be it I could see myself

[01:31:54] Buckling and getting that

[01:31:57] You know even at the high price when when the prices at high I have a lot of expectations and I think

[01:32:02] With toy story on waller those expectations could be met

[01:32:06] Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. I mean put me in for a collector's edition toy story tomorrow

[01:32:11] Brenda would love to play it everyone all my friends know the franchise like it's just one of those games where

[01:32:16] It has a magnetic quality that

[01:32:19] People would be lying it for that game

[01:32:22] Yeah, not to put a smile on your face playing it. Yeah, not so much blade runner. I mean come on guys

[01:32:26] Let's be honest like yeah those movies like I the most overrated show them of all time is probably blade runner

[01:32:31] Like I even when I watch them like where when am I supposed to love this movie like it

[01:32:37] Yeah, that was kind of lost on me. I know it's it's of people of our age really really love that movie

[01:32:42] But I never I never saw it back in the 80s and you know, I watched it maybe

[01:32:46] Five or six years ago and honestly, I don't remember a thing about

[01:32:50] So boring that movie. Anyway Greg thank you. I had a comment on the show on a Sunday night

[01:32:54] I really appreciate it. We're gonna get this up this week

[01:32:57] Um, and we'll keep talking I mean there's a lot's gonna be going on over the next few months and staying touch and you know you and I will

[01:33:03] Talk off the record all the time about this hobby, which is probably my favorite part is just all the people I get to chat with on a daily basis about this obscure hobby

[01:33:12] Yeah, and that's really what it's all about at the end of the day. I mean, I have so many great friends that I've met through this hobby

[01:33:18] You know, either just locally or at the shows

[01:33:21] You know, and like you know, even though I'm kind of

[01:33:24] Like I'm not out, but I'm not as

[01:33:26] In as I was those people are all still great. They'll always be my friends and it's still it's still always fun to talk to people about this stuff

[01:33:33] Because you know at the end of the day, it's were bunch of nerds and this type of nerdy shit is uh, it's interesting to us

[01:33:39] Right, right. Well Greg have a great

[01:33:43] Sunday evening there in California and keep flipping and we'll talk to you soon man. All right, man. Take care. All right later

[01:33:49] Well, there you have it

[01:33:51] You know Greg getting a refund on Lebowski. It's still it's still a really really really shady deal

[01:33:57] Did you expect anything else from Barry and you up when it comes to this whole title?

[01:34:03] I'll say this in closing. I do think the big Lebowski is a great game

[01:34:08] But it's just not worth it and it saddens me to see a guy like Greg who's so passionate about the theme

[01:34:15] Ultimately get to a point where he just doesn't give a shit anymore

[01:34:18] And I hate that I hate it. I hate it when people's dreams are raked over the coals because of bad management

[01:34:26] and lies and deception and all those things and so

[01:34:30] For Barry and Yacht to turn a corner on this whole fiasco

[01:34:34] They need to make games get them in boxes and get them to people soon

[01:34:39] This can't be another thing that's gonna drag on for years

[01:34:42] I don't have faith that they'll deliver and I don't care

[01:34:46] I'm tired of trying to see these things through the lens of the manufacturers because if you didn't know how to make

[01:34:54] Pinball machines then you shouldn't have taken people's money and promised them something

[01:34:59] That's it only spend your money with companies and know what the fuck they're doing

[01:35:04] We should all take that lesson and enjoy this hobby as much as we can while there still is a pinball hobby and new inbox machines

[01:35:12] I'll talk to you real soon

[01:35:15] To waste to be here

[01:35:18] Or we run out of time

[01:35:22] Who's you and me

[01:35:24] You'll be all back, you'll be all back

[01:35:27] When we go back

[01:35:29] Run out of time

[01:35:31] Who's you and me
