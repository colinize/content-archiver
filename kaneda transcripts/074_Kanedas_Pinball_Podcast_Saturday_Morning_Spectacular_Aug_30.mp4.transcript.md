[00:56] Do do do we're gonna do it anyway?

[01:02] Sad boy

[01:04] hitting right away with the

[01:07] $20

[01:10] Super chat becoming a weekly tradition here

[01:14] With um, please tell me this isn't an original story like Kong and they're using the actual films as

[01:22] Content alright, let me pin this to the top

[01:26] Do do do I'm gonna start you know when you do the super chats we're gonna give you guys a lot more love in

[01:35] um

[01:38] Let's see

[01:42] I know I pin it hmm

[01:46] Oh here we go

[01:49] Do do do I can't pin super chat they just go to the top um

[01:56] So here's the deal first of all welcome everybody happy Saturday morning

[02:01] Hope everyone's doing well. We're gonna just move this over just a little bit so I can see you

[02:05] Uh-oh my connection is unstable is it choppy?

[02:10] Is it choppy

[02:13] Did we pause man? I might be too far from the

[02:18] There we go I I don't know it's good on mine is a good is a good is a good on your end

[02:25] Answering sad boys commentary first and foremost

[02:29] That's the answer is

[02:32] Is this the

[02:34] Game is not gonna be an all-original Star Wars game. It is based on four five and six

[02:38] There are movie assets in it from those four or three movies. I have confirmation on that so

[02:44] This is believe me. I think this is gonna be all the major moments from the first three movies we love the fall of the Empire

[02:54] Sort of strangely titled that by storm pimple who that could be the joke of this company if this game doesn't like become a sale success

[03:02] I you know, I think you're gonna be playing all the major battles and I think that's how the game is gonna be and

[03:08] It's if they do it right could be awesome. I haven't seen it

[03:12] We're gonna see it in less than two weeks

[03:16] So I think it's gonna be probably revealed maybe next week

[03:21] Because the media day is the following Wednesday they got to give people time to travel I they normally

[03:26] Reveal the game before the media day, don't they?

[03:30] I don't know so

[03:32] It's interesting that they were they teased it so early and then had nothing to follow it up with

[03:37] Because now you know, they just kind of killed sales of anything just yours are holding on you right now

[03:45] What's up Jeremy? What's up Keith? We got Anthony? We got you guys say hi

[03:50] I'll say hi back who did I miss who's in the house right now? We got 35 people

[03:55] Yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know people aren't waiting around at 10 am like I'm we got six people on

[04:00] Facebook, you know, I would notice this is the last Saturday basically in summer

[04:05] And

[04:07] People are traveling they're out and about that's how it should be this beautiful beach town

[04:12] I live in is amazing this time of year if you've ever been to Rowan in Connecticut

[04:16] It is heaven on earth. I absolutely love it Brenda sisters in from Ireland for the next like week

[04:23] We've been having such a good time so I think everyone's in a good mood and you know the last thing

[04:27] I really want to do is spend 13 to 15,000 dollars on a pit mall machine. It's true. It's true

[04:35] So from what I heard

[04:39] From what I heard from my source at Stern is that Star Wars is okay and

[04:45] I'm like oh which means like I think what's coming

[04:49] Here's a thing I

[04:51] Think Jack Danger and Keith L. Win

[04:54] Took design to a whole new level right and they made games that were just so creative layouts like they were just so much more creative

[05:03] Borg's more traditional

[05:05] Right borg's more fan layout. He's more traditional. He's not like

[05:11] He doesn't design like he their danger, right? And so I think that is when people say like Star Wars is okay

[05:19] It might be a game that's designed even to just appeal to more mainstream

[05:26] Casual pinball player. I don't think we're gonna get like a crazy insane layout

[05:31] And I think

[05:33] Coming off of like some of the recent games

[05:37] It it might feel a little bit more pedestrian if you will in terms of the design of Star Wars

[05:43] so

[05:44] But where Star Wars needs to win in my book is moments of magic

[05:49] If that's the brief, you know Richie's game didn't have it. It just it just did not have it and my brief for this game

[05:56] would have been

[05:58] John I want you to watch these three movies and I want you to create moments of magic the way

[06:06] And I would call out a few games that have it like I want that kind of feeling we gave people with Lord of the Rings right the way we captured

[06:15] All of those moments of magic and I want you to do it for Star Wars

[06:20] And I think that should have been the brief

[06:23] So we'll see what we get you know look it's always fun a new pin week

[06:27] 97 modes like Harry Potter right

[06:30] um

[06:31] I just think like it's gonna be a the the way we're gonna look at this launch

[06:37] With it being Star Wars the biggest theme in all of pinball

[06:42] Spike three right the

[06:45] The next platform or spike two and a half right because it's not the new cabinet first and foremost I'm annoyed by that

[06:52] How did you not have all your stuff ready to go?

[06:55] How did you not have spike three in its totality ready to go you know why they're not doing that

[07:03] Any guesses I guarantee this is why

[07:05] Because Stern wants to use up existing cabinets. They simply want to use up existing cabinets

[07:12] They have because they didn't use those cabinets

[07:15] Probably for X-Men games and and dnd like the orders were not there

[07:19] They didn't use them up in King Kong

[07:20] I bet we're just getting leftover cabinets

[07:23] And because of that we're not going to get the full spike three platform that is that is that is annoying

[07:29] That is that that sucks and it's like

[07:32] Again like why because again when you buy a 13,000 dollar Star Wars

[07:37] Like you might like own it you want to own it forever

[07:39] You don't want it like why do you don't have like the end of the old platform

[07:44] Star Wars spike three should have been then the beginning of everything new that's amazing from your platform

[07:50] So

[07:53] You know we're not going to get it. We're not going to get it

[07:55] And so there's always going to be like what we could have been if if we gave it everything

[07:59] They've had spike three ready to go forever gang spike three was supposed to come out with the metallica remaster was supposed to be all new spike three

[08:12] The 50th will have it you're not wrong chance. I mean there's going to be the 50th anniversary of Star Wars in in a year and a half a year and a half

[08:19] It's not really me. We're almost at 2026 and then you know

[08:22] I think they're going to bring out the 50th right away right January 2027 and we're going to get it in less

[08:29] You know, it's kind of same with jaws jaws like a year and a half and then the anniversary edition came out

[08:35] Um

[08:37] I don't think like Stern like cares less. I don't think anything they do is with malicious intent

[08:42] I think a lot of it is just to like financially like survive

[08:46] You know they go really big operation going on and you know they've been they've been releasing some real duds

[08:57] And I think they I think they slept on too many other themes

[09:03] And you know, it's just not really working out

[09:07] I you know I have to imagine their projections for King Kong sales and the actual con sales

[09:14] We're not that they weren't even close

[09:18] Fall spike three is Pokemon

[09:21] It's just funny to me man like it's so funny. None of you like Pokemon none of you

[09:27] New any of you like Pokemon

[09:29] Hey, you don't dislike it, but you're not into Pokemon

[09:32] Like who here is like into Pokemon like you trade you play Pokemon go you have the cards any of you any of you

[09:40] You're all you're all you might be fatigued by it, but you've all seen the Star Wars movies many many times

[09:49] It's just like I don't know Pokemon is not it's the biggest IP in the world

[09:52] It is and I'm not denying it. It's just like I don't just don't know. I don't know what the crossover is gonna be like

[10:02] Like I've seen all the Harry Potter movies. I have not like seen any Pokemon TV shows

[10:10] I never saw the Pokemon movie like I just I just don't know

[10:20] Um

[10:22] Kids these days who what what kids are buying pinball machines nobody

[10:30] Ah Jack danger what so I don't you know I don't know I miss Jack being

[10:35] I don't want him not to design. I don't want him to you know like

[10:40] Now that we know what he's capable of

[10:42] His design career can't end after like two and a half games

[10:48] It just can't mark Ron YouTube as well welcome

[10:53] I don't know if I can keep doing either we only got one super chat

[10:57] And I'm gonna call you guys out when when you guys super chat

[11:01] It can even just be a dollar you know, it doesn't have to be a lot. It doesn't have to be 20 like sad boy

[11:05] But all the super chats are gonna get special shout out. So we're gonna you can you can ask

[11:11] Anything in super chat and just like we'll focus on that question and I you know maybe 50 bucks super chat who's making big bang bar

[11:18] I might tell you might not

[11:21] Yeah, it's coming back though. I've seen pictures of it

[11:24] um

[11:26] Can't share the photos

[11:27] But um it looks cool looks cool. Don't like how they're putting the company name on the artwork

[11:33] Like I wouldn't do that

[11:35] It should it should always be you're always because here's the thing you're always making capcom's big bang bar

[11:43] It is an idiotic move and hopefully they change this it is an idiotic move to slap your company logo

[11:51] over

[11:54] Like I don't want it like it's your remaking capcom's big bang bar

[11:59] Even if you like

[12:01] Change the artwork. It doesn't matter like don't now say it's your game

[12:07] It's not

[12:10] You know what I'm saying it's not

[12:15] Picked up a wick premium for 6500 wow mark good good pickup

[12:21] Right that's a $3,000 loss on a premium

[12:26] It's funny man. I'm loving it all

[12:29] Um

[12:30] Still they sold thousands of cons mostly their

[12:34] Composers are like I don't think they've sold thousands of cong. I mean they might have sold like

[12:41] What do you think they sold of King Kong like like honestly? What do you think the sales of conworth three at most?

[12:46] Which is a failure though for stern

[12:50] Sold way more hairy potters way more hairy potters got sold

[12:59] If elwin moves to Jersey jack do you think sternas to move jack back into designer role um

[13:07] Yeah, I do

[13:10] Yeah

[13:13] I think you know

[13:14] What elwin's exposed is stern's vulnerability to

[13:19] losing

[13:21] You know their marquee designer

[13:23] Chance hammer with the 10 bucks chance. Thank you so much. Let me star this. Let me heart it

[13:31] I mean let me like this

[13:34] With Jersey jack have executed Star Wars better. Oh wow. That's a great question chance

[13:41] With Jersey jack have executed Star Wars better

[13:46] It's talk about that. I mean, it's a full hypothetical

[13:49] I can tell you right now Brian Coss. Thank you for the 99 cents brother

[13:53] Um really appreciated. I'll tell you this

[13:56] Star Wars with the big LCD on jjp the jjp platform the hot rose imagine the hot rails like going into the hyperdrive or the you

[14:04] You could with the RGB LEDs like you can make it seem like you're you're you're and you're going into hyperspace

[14:10] 100% Jersey jack would execute Star Wars way better than stern

[14:14] Like the things Jersey jack could do with like the the like just the overall presentation of the theme

[14:20] Is gonna blow away anything's turns gonna give us

[14:23] blow away

[14:24] So 100% I think Jersey jack would have executed Star Wars better the thing is and and I I mean this when I say this

[14:32] I mean this when I say this

[14:34] I haven't seen

[14:36] an impressive mech

[14:38] from either company

[14:41] in

[14:42] Years

[14:43] Let me repeat that

[14:44] I have not seen an

[14:46] impressive mechanism

[14:48] from both Jersey jack and stern pinball in

[14:53] years

[14:55] I think both companies mechanically are

[14:58] Kind of mailing it in

[15:00] our kind of cost cutting

[15:02] our kind of

[15:04] D&D's mech the dragon mech nah

[15:08] It's not like it's okay

[15:10] It just fires balls back. It's okay. It's not it could have done way more

[15:16] I will say D&D's probably like going to the cooler mech yes, but like think about it though like nothing in jaws

[15:24] Nothing really I mean maybe X-Men's sent it all had it had a shot at it, but it was kind of like you know

[15:29] It's kind of kind of mess. It didn't really work very well

[15:33] Um

[15:35] Nothing in King Kong is really impressive

[15:38] Nothing in um

[15:40] Venom or John Wick nothing in James Bond nothing in

[15:47] jaws I already said nothing in

[15:50] Yeah, it's just been all nothing Metallica remastered like nothing

[15:54] Like and Jersey Jack like nothing in potters a wow nothing in

[16:00] Avatar was a wow nothing in gnr was a wow nothing in a godfather was a wow

[16:06] Nothing in Elton John was a wow. I mean the Elton John piano mech probably the coolest

[16:13] Right, I mean just just as an overall physical thing to put in a game that was really cool and the spider and King Kong

[16:19] But you know what I mean gang

[16:21] You know what I mean? It's like it's like both companies

[16:25] I think spooky has way better mechs than both companies right now

[16:29] Spooky's put better mechs in evil dead

[16:33] They might use servos. I don't care. I just more stuff that interacts with the ball. That's fun

[16:39] Ah

[16:41] The staircase is cool the staircase is cool, but it's you know, it's um it's a it's a diverter

[16:46] It's a it's a it's a it's not really like wow. It's cool. I

[16:51] I

[16:56] Not just the building in Godzilla like the magnet that grabs the ball and Godzilla is super cool

[17:01] You know, I really want to see more of that

[17:04] So um let's talk spooky

[17:08] Do you guys want to hear um the news?
