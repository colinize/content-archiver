[00:00] Chicago Chicago that tunnel in town Chicago Chicago I will show you around

[00:19] Is there anything going on in the pinball world this week? Oh, that's right pinball expo

[00:24] So 2018 in Chicago always an exciting time of year when we get to see new pinball machines for the first time ever

[00:35] On this episode of Canadian pinball podcast we are going to give my impressions and my feelings on October fest

[00:43] We finally get to see it and also my thoughts on monster bash remake and also talk about some of the other new things that have happened in the pinball hobby

[00:54] This week because we know that no matter where you are in the pinball manufacturing world

[00:59] There always seems to be some sort of happenings that occur within each company around expo

[01:06] So let's get right to it October fest alright this has been a theme that you know I have been

[01:14] Panning on this show for the longest time right I harp on the fact that

[01:19] Marketing matters and themes really really matter and if you make October fest American pinball remember what I'd say as like you guys are

[01:27] Heading for obsolescence and bankruptcy if you make this your second title

[01:32] So how do I feel now after seeing October fest for the first time?

[01:37] Well, I'm going to go through the good and the bad on the game and I'm going to share my opinions about the game

[01:45] From what I saw yesterday and it's a little bit of a mixed bag and I think I'm going to give a pretty fair assessment of this title

[01:52] And how I think it will do okay and again this is my opinion and the one thing I haven't done before we get going

[02:00] I haven't played it which as we all know is the most important thing when it comes to pinball

[02:06] Have you played it and do you like it okay all I can do is go off of what I've seen and what others are saying to me

[02:13] Alright, let's do it this way. Let's talk first about how they launched the game and I want to give American pinball about like an A to an A plus on how they launched this game

[02:26] And here's why even though some dingbats scooped them a little bit on pinside they did it right and by that I mean they had their seminar at 830 at Expo

[02:38] And immediately after the seminar right they pulled the curtain off the game they had Jack Danger doing an hour and a half video of flipping the game for the first time

[02:49] And I thought that was really awesome that we went right from reveal to gameplay in the right way right with HD footage with Jack's camera on Twitch

[03:00] So you could see from anywhere in the world. I thought that was incredible. It was also great that they had other pinball content ready to go

[03:08] So right when they were like revealing the game we got a straight down the middle interview with Josh Kugler

[03:15] It was about eight minutes long incredible interview by Zach and I loved it. It was very highly produced and it explained the game

[03:23] I mean what a novel concept to have high definition video of your game explaining the way the game works when you reveal it

[03:34] So I thought that was terrific. There was also an hour interview with Josh Kugler and head to head pinball that was already in the can

[03:41] That was great. That went live pretty immediately after the reveal

[03:45] This week in pinball put up a big story about it as well. So Jeff over there did a great story talking about all the things going on in the game

[03:54] So that's a great way to do it right and they also had high-res images and HD video around the game

[04:03] So everything we saw when we first saw it was in living color it looked great it sounded great and it was the right way to reveal a game

[04:12] And I think they deserve to be applauded for launching the game the right way. So gentlemen good good job

[04:20] Now there's only one thing they need to do next time and this irks me whenever this happens if Jack danger is going to flip your game for the first time ever

[04:30] In front of you know a few thousand people watching all around the world please American pinball make sure you have someone from your team standing next to Jack to answer his questions

[04:43] It was so silly it's like everyone kept asking about stuff in the game

[04:48] How do you do this? How do you lower the ramp? How much is it going to cost? When is it going to ship this this this and nobody was there to help answer his questions

[04:56] And Jack is always like turning around like asking these questions into the air and there was nobody to help answer his questions

[05:02] So next time whenever you have Jack danger flipping your machine you need to treat him like a VIP media person

[05:10] And you need to make sure that you have someone on the American pinball team or the Stern team or the Jersey Jack team

[05:15] You need to have someone standing next to Jack so that he knows not just how to play your game but how to answer the questions of people that are watching

[05:23] Alright so let's dive right in let's talk about design first because I think the first thing that excites us is what is like the layout of a pinball game

[05:34] Right how is the design of this game and I have to say I

[05:37] Really got excited when I saw the design of this game right I think the game itself has a lot of fun stuff happening when you're just standing over and looking down at the game

[05:50] And on some level on some level a pinball machine should just look really fun to shoot before you've ever even shot it

[06:00] And I think the design is really really neat and interesting and you know the stuff that pops out the ramps the habit trails

[06:08] That big roller coaster habit trail that goes you know all the way from the left ramp around and then you know swirls down and zigzags and all that stuff

[06:18] Very very cool to see those wire form ramps in that shape right very like non traditional and you know you got the big keg you got the big auto face

[06:31] You've got like all this color popping out of you but we're gonna talk about art later but from a design standpoint what I was happy to see is that none of the shots looked tight and frustrating like Houdini

[06:44] Alright none of them so it seems like this is going to be a much more rewarding game to shoot than Houdini which is good

[06:52] When you think about this game and you look at the sheer amount of stuff that's in this game I mean I want to go down the list of everything that they put into

[07:03] The first time I've ever seen a photographer because it's really impressive and you know me I bitch all the time about the lack of mechanisms and toys and things inside

[07:12] Stern games right I usually complain about stern when I'm talking about that stuff this game has a lot in it

[07:20] I'm going to read what they say on their their gameplay features it has multiple wire form ramps including the awesome corkscrew roller coaster

[07:30] Twin loops and zigzag a roller coaster shack and beer barrel three ball lock mechanisms RGB lighting for both feature inserts and general play field illumination

[07:41] Auto the bartender interactive target and ball lock assembly three flippers three bumper car pop bumpers three slingshots four magnets two of which are player controlled via Magnav

[07:55] Cabinet button ramp that raises and lowers alright look that's a lot that is a lot that they put into this game and if you compare that that feature

[08:09] Matrix next to like Deadpool for example I mean it's you know it's it's kind of comical rate how much more is in this game but again

[08:19] We're going to talk at the end of this what makes pinball great and makes you want to buy it is the sum of the parts of a pinball machine but from a design standpoint and what they put in this game

[08:29] You have to give American pinball credit for jamming a lot of fun stuff into this game and for being creative and that's the other thing too

[08:38] What I give Joe ball so credit for in the team in American pinball is when I look down at this game it doesn't remind me of any other game that I've seen out in the wild

[08:50] It doesn't feel like it you know what I like about what Joe does is his designs they do feel like pretty much radically different than the one before like there's nothing really that feels similar to anything that was on Houdini from a design standpoint

[09:06] There's a mech I'm going to talk about in a minute that is a complete carry over from who you can probably guess which one it is all right okay so kudos to them on that right kudos some of the things that I just like if I were to give a little bit of advice auto the auto the big German dude you know that's that's sitting above like the who Dini stage door they rest that's the part that they recycle you bash him

[09:34] and they literally just moved over the who Dini theater as that bash item but that's okay to you know I saw some people complaining about that and at the end of the day if American pinball has these mechanisms and it's a fun mech I'm not going to fault them for reusing it in this way because it's a fun thing it's a bash door that opens up and captures the balls like so cool I much rather than reuse a really fun toy like that or mech like that

[10:03] then just you know constantly recycle the same ramps and what not and and always have the same sort of stuff in every game right so all right so there's that that advice I'd give is that auto auto his face his 3D sculpted face this kind of annoys me it doesn't look like the auto that's on the cabinet in the back class you know it doesn't look close enough to him so I hope they can get that sculpt to be a little bit looking more like auto all right

[10:32] all right let's see what else the roller coaster is really really cool so I love the way the ramp lowers down I love the way that you have to light the October fest targets to lower the ramp and then that's where you lock three balls and then the roller coaster takes off and the three balls are sent down the fun wire forms I think that's really really cool what I like about it too

[10:57] I like the fact that that roller coaster is there it's in plain sight but you don't get to enjoy the fun of the roller coaster right away I love the fact that you have to accomplish something to then ride the coaster and I think that's a really really smart move you know I've complained before about the upper playfield empire to the Caribbean how I think it's silly that it's just immediately accessible it's a fun area of the of the game

[11:26] but by making it immediately accessible I feel like it took away the reward that would have happened if you had something like this where you know you had to like do something to unlock the ability to get on board that ship in Pirates of the Caribbean so very very unique interesting design I think everyone is excited by the design of the game

[11:47] all right now now we start to get to like where people are starting to nit pick and this is also something that I'm going to just have the nit pick at because the other thing you see we we our eyes see two things when we see a pinball machine for the first time we see the layout and we see the art and it's impossible to see one without the other because there is a complete synergy between the two one is on top of the other right okay so when I first saw this game

[12:17] I was like my I was like was like what whoa I was like it was like overload of colors of of imagery of shapes of inserts of art of art styles you know it was a lot like a lot to process like I didn't know where to look at first it was very very busy very very cluttered feeling artwork and there's just almost too much you know I think this hobby is

[12:46] is now going overboard with the artwork on the games and I think a lot of the desire to show detail and and and let your artists go crazy and to make you know things

[13:00] plentiful and colorful and have you know details all over a play field has really overcrowded the play field and when you go too much on art I think it's just as bad as as being too little I do and I think there's a very middle ground

[13:17] when there's just enough art because to me art should not it should not drown the inserts and when I look at this game and I look down at the art and I just feel like all those inserts that are in the middle of the play field right all the tents all the fonts all the different like you've got all these tents I don't know how many there's like 12 or something tents or 14 tents right they've all got a fun sort of

[13:47] image next to the tent with font and you know they light up and it's like they're lost in this like sea of overly detailed green grass and it's just hard it's hard because everything also just feels flat like the fonts and the text have no shadowing on them so it's like they don't really stand out and when you've got everything just laid flat all over the place it gets really crowded looking

[14:16] and I think they could fix that and I do I think they could fix it by probably toning down the amount of detail on that grass I think if it were just even more like a simpler green with less stuff going everywhere like you know it's like it's too many lines in the grass like they need to like remove some of that line work

[14:37] and I think it would make the inserts pop a lot more will they do that do they have time to do that I don't know right that's the big question it felt to me when I'm saying like all these little characters and everything it and and correct me if you think I'm wrong at canada pinball at gmail.com but when I look at the game it felt a little bit like I was looking at a wears Waldo book you know wears Waldo all the little figures all the little things going on every day

[15:07] where it's like I'm it's like I was searching the the October fest play field to find little Waldo somewhere and you know it just has that kind of clutter that I think would be better off if they simplified it a little bit right all right what else did I took notes on what I wanted to talk about so the okay so the I doesn't know what to look at I think that's another thing too right there's too many different styles of art happening in the game too and this is something that is really really good

[15:37] really you know really just it's just it just reeks that these guys need better art direction and I think we're going to see this awesome when we talk about the the animations and the display but on the play field art you you have like competing styles of art right you've got your sort of CGI computerized auto and the lady that are on the cabinet and the back glass and then I'll also appear on the play field and stuff

[16:05] then you've got what look like real life photos of people from October fest that are also on the play field and then you also have like cartoony like really cartoony like images as well drawn you know it's it's almost like three different art styles that are competing and thrown together and that doesn't work you know it just it doesn't feel cohesive and it's like it literally is just like there are like almost like vomiting three different types of styles and all

[16:35] this stuff and all this detail on to the play field and it doesn't have a cohesiveness you know I'm looking right now at Christopher French's Batman you can look at zombie Yeti or dirty donnies work and all of the art that ends up on those guys games it all comes from the hand of one artist this feels like some of this came from the artist who did

[16:57] who Deanie who also did like the art on the side of the game and the translate some of this feels like it's clip art that they bought some of this feels like other like images that they found on the internet right it feels like they sourced the stuff from three separate places and and and that you know that might just be the case right they just might not have the money do I've done it all like the way

[17:22] Stern does it and pay one artist to do everything but it doesn't feel as cohesive as even who Deanie did and I think the art is it's really really difficult to to make excuses if the art doesn't hit right because art should be

[17:39] something that you just nail and you nail right all right let's talk about the cabinet art the cabinet art is also very colorful I applaud the color in the game

[17:51] I mean I thought who Deanie was dark and jury and not fun to look at I don't like the steam punk who Deanie but I really do like the color palette in October fest I think it's much more cheerful approachable much more colorful

[18:06] you know you've got auto on one side and you got the lady on the other side and you got the big October fest banner I think it is a little strange that they are covering the October fest banner

[18:21] I think again they should put auto behind the banner with maybe the beer in his hand hanging over it but I think it's layered wrong

[18:31] and it he should not be covering the title of the game and same with the woman on the other side I think it would look better if they were maybe behind the banner

[18:40] but again it's because these are images that were done for you know I guess this is these guys are primarily on the on the back box but I mean sorry in the cabinets in this pose

[18:54] but it just feels a little bit like strange that it covers the name just you just see like October right and then other side or fest

[19:01] and I guess that they were going for right is like you have half on one side half on the other okay well it is what it is

[19:08] you know I do like the sort of like the wood panel roof that matches the wood the brown armor on the game I you know it's fun seeing those two flipper buttons on the right side I don't like I absolutely don't like the American pinball logo where it is on the cabinet I think they need to remove that from the cabinet it looks really distracting they should probably put like a big rubber ducky there or something else something fun

[19:37] but the reason it just looks bad there is no you know it I don't know any other company that puts like JJP real the imagine the JJP logo there or the big stern logo there it just feels off and it doesn't look good there so I think they should just remove that that actually should be something easy for them to remove by the time they ship the game

[19:57] but I think it just looks completely out of place and they should they should scrap it alright alright what else about the art let me reach you would Benheck said about the art good old Benheck he writes a hand drawn art package is easily obtained for ten thousand dollars there is no excuse for a company with this much money behind it to release an art package this bad

[20:21] alright that's what Benheck said about the art kind of funny coming from Benheck who was in charge of the art for America's most honate which is quite possibly the ugliest pinball machine of all time to shave Mr. Heck but to Ben's defense they didn't have money the way American pinball has money

[20:41] so they they that's what I think he's hiding behind but also Ben had some stuff to say about the LCD but I'll talk about that later alright so let's go on the music

[20:50] the music in the game is another thing people are talking a lot about there is a lot of controversy it seems around the use of more of a rock and roll sort of heavy metal guitar sort of inspired octoberfest soundtrack versus the traditional octoberfest music or the polka music that people are used to with octoberfest and you know look I I I I don't know how you win here because I feel like the traditional polka music

[21:19] would get really really old really really fast and be like headache inducing but then the the rock and roll guitar stuff just feels like a little out of place for this like festival right this is because you're looking down at this like German festival this world under glass that I think they hit

[21:36] and then you get this more like your like a head banger's ball so I'm you know I think I think it is a little off and I be okay if that was part of the mode but that seems to be like the

[21:48] you know the the soundtrack for the game like when you plunge like it's that that is like what you're going to hear most of the time so curious to see if they hear that feedback and make any changes to the music of the game but that has a lot of people polarize and divide it I don't mind it per se I think the game sounds good I I you know has a kind of like that upbeat energetic sound to it which I think you need in pimpal alright

[22:16] so the call outs another thing people are like starting to nip a cat sounds like an Irish American guys trying to sound German and he also sounds way younger than how auto looks in the game and with games like this you know when you do an original IP or you know this not original IP but when you do a game that's really all about having fun and sense humor and like sort of like this jolly journey through this pimpal world

[22:44] it's super super important that you nail the call outs and the call outs are awesome and they're fun and they're hysterical because you you're going to hear those for the rest of your life you know when a game is done with call outs it's done with call outs you know call outs I still believe call outs are the number one reason why dialed in failed to resonate with people I think it had really sterile and boring call outs and and that's why that game that was designed to be fun was kind of sterile and boring in a way that was done by the game and I think it was a really good idea.

[23:14] And I think that's really a lot of ways because of the call outs now look this game is not finished there are probably a lot more call outs to come I you know look I yeah I would have like them to get a better voice actor to do this stuff and that's just me you know I think if you're going to make a pinball game and you want a voice actor get a good one because it is I think it's un people underestimate the the importance of call outs in pinball and getting good call out and I think that's the most important thing to do is to get the best answer.

[23:44] So I think you know make it can take a game from being good to great it can take an experience from being like okay to super hilarious right there's a lot of stuff that call outs can accomplish and I think investing in them it's just something I like to see more these companies do across the board and I hate to see companies fall down on call outs because they they could it could just get it right right it feels like really hard to design a pinball machine to make the design fun it seems really easy just to hire the right voice actors to make the call out.

[24:14] And really animate those call outs right all right now this is where we get to I think is shaping up to be the Achilles heel of American pinball and that's the LCD and the animations in the game and much like in Houdini I I really think this company needs to rethink what they do with the LCD I think it looks very very good

[24:44] very amateur hour and you you cannot put an LCD in your game and try to do animations and have them end up this poor right I'll read what Benheck said first then I'll jump back into animations Benheck said the LCD is even worse looks like a shareware AOL game from 1996 who looked at this and said this is fine

[25:14] clearly no one and for the love of God put some strokes or drop shadows on text your average graffiti artist knows better than this back okay so look lots of shade there about the animations and I think across the board when you watch this game being played lots of fun stuff happening on the play field when you look up at the screen

[25:39] I kind of feel like embarrassed for them you know like this is really we're back here again with this and I want to give them some advice and I think this would help them and I think companies need to stop thinking that just because you have an LCD screen that you have to have all this stuff going on on that screen to make the pinball experience fun

[26:04] and I was actually talking to a friend about like magic girl had a screen that was really cool and was really beautiful and it fit really nicely other than being blocked by the entire center mechanism but if you go back and look at magic girl videos it's just the stylized artwork of mad Andrews is all over the screen in static form this beautiful static artwork on the screen and then the screens use for just giving you the score or for you know broadcasting what mode you're in the screen

[26:34] and what's happening with the game but it's not like really animated and that's okay it still looks beautiful and I think I think these companies are falling down thinking they need all this animation to happen and I think they should just not do animations unless they can do animations at the level they need to be to not be embarrassing in a pinball machine in 2018 because we're going to compare this to Jersey Jack animations and Stern animations and you know look how good Alice Cooper nightmare castle animations

[27:04] are they're phenomenal phenomenal animations in that game and then you look at this and it feels home brew and you know I hate to say it but like I just think that American pinball needs to look past Josh to do these animations and it's nothing personal Josh I mean look if this is your skill level with animations and what you can do then maybe stick to coding and coming up with the concepts and all that stuff because I think you're good at that stuff but if this isn't your

[27:34] strong suit that I think American pinball needs to like move past this approach because I do think they need to sell games and they can't have elements of the game be this concerning to potential buyers all right so in summary what do we think of October fest like what do we think and you know I think it's a little bit of a mix bag for me and it's a mix bag I think

[28:04] for a lot of people out there I think there's so much to like and I think there's also so much not to like happening at the same time you know I think you look down at the machine and you love the layout you love the mechanisms you love the magnets you love the roller coaster it looks like a fun

[28:21] pin to shoot right isn't that what's isn't that what matters is that it's a fun pin to shoot but then you look down at the artwork and it's like not fun to look at because of how cluttered it is and then you look at the LCD screen and it's not fun to look at because of how poor the animations are I mean whenever you hit a jackpot when you're in roller coaster

[28:39] multi-ball like the animations for that roller coaster going across the track on the jackpot when you know it's like just a zoom in of the car with like the green grass it's just so bad it's so it doesn't need to be that like they literally could just they could just stay on the image of the roller coaster going up and down right and then just put a fun jackpot and the score just go over that screen we don't want the cut to this crappy animation and I you know like the woman juggling the balls or like

[29:09] you know throwing the the rings around the bottles like all those animations just look like they were pissed poor and they were purchased on like a website for like 20 bucks and I just think there's a better way to do it you know there's a better way to do it all right so that leads me to this like final conclusion that this feels like a really fun pin to shoot it feels like a game that artistically I want redone in a lot of ways and it feels like

[29:39] it's a hard game to say after what I've seen I want to buy it okay and that is like something I just kept thinking about over the last 48 hours with all these new pinball machines coming out were always going to be excited when they pulled a curtain off a new machine right it's really exciting when a company shows us their new game for the first time and you know that excitement you know leads us to want to want to play the thing right I can't wait to flip it

[30:07] way to flip it. But with so many new games coming out, there is another achievement a company

[30:15] like American Pimball needs to do. They don't need to show you something you're curious

[30:19] to flip and something that looks fun. They need to show you something that you want to own.

[30:26] And that is where the hurdle still lies for companies like American Pimball I feel.

[30:32] Do you want to own this game? Like own it. Do you want to own those callouts? Do you want

[30:38] to own that artwork? Do you want to own this and have this be played over and over and

[30:44] over again in your home for like $7,500 or do you want to just take 20 bucks and go play

[30:52] and have fun and then go home and play pins that you really want to own. And that is where

[30:59] we are at in the Pimball market. You can't have weak elements anymore. A Pimball machine is only

[31:09] going to sell and it's only going to succeed based on the sum of its parts. And if you have a

[31:18] weak link that is like a glaringly weak link like the animations on the LCD or like the overcrowded

[31:25] art on the play field. Like if it's really really really like kind of rubbing people the wrong

[31:30] way, you're going to have a hard time selling. We know that when we see the monsters the art

[31:36] package is going to be amazing. Stern knows that there's nothing visually that will turn you off

[31:43] from any of their new games ever. Like they just won't. Like they will always have sex with your

[31:50] eyes with Stern Pimball machines. You might not get the designs and the mechs you want but they

[31:54] will be beautiful. They will be beautiful. And I think it's hard to say you can look down at

[31:59] October fest and say it's beautiful. But here's the thing. I think it's there. I do. I really think

[32:06] a beautiful game is sitting right in front of us and they just need to take another swing at

[32:11] the artwork. I think they should take a page from Jersey Jack Pimball who showed us the Hobbit artwork.

[32:19] Remember what happened? They got a lot of criticism and constructive feedback on how to make it

[32:25] better and they went back and they re-did the entire play field artwork and it looks so much better.

[32:32] It looks so much better. Of course then they made people wait two years and that didn't help but

[32:36] anyway. I think American Pimball should do this. Now here's the problem I said a couple of podcasts

[32:42] ago. Now because they want to ship in December do they have time to do that? And I think the answer

[32:49] is yes. We saw Christopher Franchi what he did in two weeks to save Batman 66. So I think within like

[32:57] the next six weeks before they go into production American Pimball should spend all of their efforts

[33:04] addressing the animations and the play field artwork of this game because I think there's a winning

[33:11] game there if they can get those things in line. I think that's a fair assessment of the game. I

[33:17] don't think it's negative. I'm not taking personal shots. I think Joe Balser's design just

[33:24] deserves better art and doesn't need to be overcrowded with too much going on. All right.

[33:31] God guys that was like half hour of October fest. You've never heard me talk about October

[33:36] fest for half hour but the game is out and I also just want to say this. In closing I want to say

[33:41] congratulations to everyone in American Pimball for achieving this. We all know making Pimball is not

[33:46] easy. We all know that designing a Pimball game in secrecy is also not easy and I want to say that

[33:52] everyone who worked on this game give yourselves a pat on the back like you did what most of the

[33:57] boutique companies could never do and you're still around and you're still making Pimball.

[34:03] But if you're going to succeed there's still work to be done right and you guys know that and

[34:08] this is a sophomore effort and they're you know you're going to keep getting better and I think

[34:14] you're getting good feedback and each game is going to get better. Okay. All right. Let's go on

[34:19] to a game that doesn't need to get better because it's one of the best games of all time and it

[34:24] just got even better and that is Monster Bash Remake. So we finally saw Monster Bash Remake.

[34:29] You know it's a little like underwhelming in the sense of you know who didn't you know sorry

[34:34] October fest is all new and so we kind of already knew that Monster Bash Remake would be guess

[34:40] what Monster Bash which we've seen for 20 years but even knowing that even knowing that I want

[34:47] to say that Chicago gaming company has blown this out of the park or blown not knocked it out of

[34:54] the fucking park. This game is amazing and I don't own a Monster Bash. I feel like this game if

[35:04] you do not own a Monster Bash will make you want to go get a Monster Bash. I have heard from people

[35:10] at the floor who have seen this with the full RGB LED lighting with the display. Let's go down

[35:17] the list of everything you get with the Ellie. You get the topper. Yep not as cool as the attack

[35:22] from Mars Ellie topper but still okay fine. We've made this company all about toppers they're more

[35:29] than that. You get the front molding which they it's a weird thing they call that but you get this

[35:36] stunning electric blue metallic front molding adorned with a one of a kind photo engraved stainless

[35:42] steel piece of artwork that was created just for the Monster Bash Remake limited edition.

[35:48] Here's the thing I haven't seen this in person. Out of all the stuff I love everything they've done

[35:53] I don't like this plaque. I don't. I think it's too big and it takes up too much room on that

[36:00] apron and it just looks a little strange to me. That's the only thing I don't like. Okay then we

[36:05] get to all the stuff I love. You got the interactive RGB illumination. You've got the improved play

[36:11] field monsters that look awesome. You've got the LED lit poppers. You got the LED lit moving

[36:16] targets. You got the plasma disc. You got the LED drag coffin. You got the premium enhanced sound

[36:22] and then you get to what I think is a stand up and just clap your hands ovation for the dots

[36:33] that they did in this game and I think the takeaway for me is this. It just goes to show. You don't

[36:39] need these ginormous LCD animations. You can just do really awesome dots like this and it looks

[36:45] awesome like it fits in pinball. It feels like to me the perfect balance between retro pinball

[36:51] and modern tech working together to still feel like an awesome pinball experience. Okay now they

[36:59] put up on the website the old dots on the left side and then the new dots and it is without a doubt

[37:07] a work of art what they've done to this game. Okay and so that being said we have a little bit more

[37:12] details on monster bash remake. We don't know all the details. We know that there's going to be 12

[37:17] 150 LEDs so there's going to be 250 more than they did for attack from Mars and Medieval madness

[37:26] and the LED gets the top or in the blue armor and then the this there's like what is this called?

[37:32] The special edition gets the stainless steel and it looks like the classic edition also the big

[37:38] difference between the classic and the special is the classic just has the old orange dots.

[37:43] If you must have your monster bash exactly the way it was in the mid 90s or the special edition

[37:50] has the nicer display. Very very nice packages here. Not going to be hard to get one. You don't

[37:57] have to have a fear of missing out on these LEDs which is you know at first I was like well these

[38:01] guys like well don't they want to sell out and just keep it like an exclusive thing and I guess

[38:06] that's not what they want to do. They just want to get as many monster bash as into homes and into

[38:12] arcades as they can. They're not they don't get they don't care about probably the resale on the

[38:16] LED or selling out of the LED and disappointing people who wanted the LED. If you want an LED of

[38:21] monster bash the good news is you'll be able to get one with no drama no fanfare. Canada can't flip

[38:26] one on you. You're going to be able to get one and I think that is what they want to do and who

[38:32] am I to complain that a company actually wants you to have the game you want in the trim you want

[38:38] without all of the BS drama and I think it also shows that you know pinball really shouldn't be like

[38:44] a collectible it should just be a game that you play because you have fun. Now that being said

[38:50] I do think there should be games that are designed as collectors items but you know 121250 you know

[38:59] is not a collector item. Neither is a 1000 you know pirates the Caribbean LED it's just not none of

[39:06] those games are collectors items. Games only to me a collectible if there's only like 20 in the

[39:10] world and that's it or 15 in the world and that's it or 8 in the world and that's it all right so

[39:15] kudos to Chicago gaming company they've added another game for you to be able to buy that

[39:21] creates an even more dilemma for those of you out there who are trying to figure out what to buy

[39:27] okay okay what else is going on this week during expo so let me ask a question because you see

[39:34] monster bash remake and maybe you want one but maybe your money is locked in with spook and you

[39:38] gave Charlie a thousand dollars for for Alice Cooper's nightmare castle Alice Cooper I believe

[39:44] it's at the show I've been hearing from people you know it is what it is where people are still waiting

[39:50] for the game to be made and there hasn't been a ton of communication between Charlie and his buyers

[39:54] on exactly when their games are going to get to them and so but here's my thing here's my question

[40:00] for Chuck and spooky people so you took a thousand dollars from people and you gave them a time frame

[40:07] right by which the games would start to be manufactured but what if Chuck missed that time frame

[40:13] what if the delays pushed that back a few months and those people now want their money back because

[40:19] they wanted a game you know by maybe Halloween or they they were the front of the line or they

[40:23] needed a game by here or there we'll Chuck give you your thousand dollars back if the company you

[40:29] had delays they couldn't foresee and you know sort of broke the verbal contract they had with the

[40:34] people who put their deposit down I don't know do you want your thousand dollars back so you can go buy

[40:40] a monster bash it's kind of crazy you can get them I heard the monster bash like the regular

[40:43] or the classic edition is like five thousand nine hundred ninety five dollars the fact that it's

[40:48] that cheap is incredible the fact that it's that is fifteen hundred dollars cheaper than that mafia

[40:55] game from those pin the pinball people the pinball company the ma I mean seriously I you know I

[41:00] was going to send Jack danger or joke I didn't want to do this because it was kind of mean but Jack

[41:04] danger uploaded a picture of them unboxing the mafia game and I wanted to write on Facebook this

[41:12] is the only time you're ever going to see this game unboxed ever and I didn't because it was kind

[41:18] of mean even though I just said it on my podcast but no I mean come on that game has no place in the

[41:22] market there's no place for it no one's going to buy it at that price when you can go get a monster

[41:27] bash you know the like the premium monster bash edition where you can go get like October fest

[41:32] look look at October fest is the same price as the mafia look at everything that's in it there's

[41:37] just no way Jose will that game sell to anybody all right unless that person might be blind or

[41:44] something I don't know all right let's go down stern some news from stern this week stern

[41:49] released code for Batman 66 and for Deadpool we're at the when you're in the end of Batman people

[41:56] it's point nine eight there's really not much left in Batman I think if you have a Batman now I think

[42:03] you can feel pretty good that you've got the game the way it's going to be for a very long time

[42:08] of course Lyman will polish it there's still stuff missing that I think people want I mean I want

[42:14] there to be more use of the penguin crane I really wish that they would let you know how many

[42:21] gadgets you have I wish when you got a gadget like it popped up on the bottom of the screen and you

[42:25] could just see you know because you've got all those cool like images for the bat gadgets but when

[42:29] you collect a gadget it just doesn't tell you which one you have and you know I think that could

[42:34] have been like an icon on the screen they made bookworm easier to beat but otherwise like this

[42:41] game's coming to the end and it's a phenomenal game and I think people are enjoying it but I think

[42:46] you know now that it's like near in the end you'll probably start to see some of the LEDs and

[42:49] maybe super LEDs start to go up for sale because I think people might feel like it's been fun but

[42:55] I'm I've sort of seen everything I'm gonna see here I just wish they would get more of the call

[43:00] outs from Adam Weston Bert Warden there too as it seems like they recorded a lot more all right

[43:04] what else happened at stern we saw the Star Wars topper after all these years we saw the top

[43:11] of us for Star Wars and Iron Maiden and it's like R2D2 sitting on this really boring like white

[43:16] base and everyone kind of looked at it like it took almost like what like a year and a half to get

[43:22] that approved like what it looks pretty basic you know I think that is not going to be the base

[43:31] I think there has to be something that that goes inside ever on on top of where it looks more like

[43:39] he's on an X-wing fighter you know that just looks terrible but with that base the way it is

[43:44] the Iron Maiden topper is cool it's like head on of Eddie and the airplane I think there's

[43:49] going to be two toppers for Maiden there's going to be an Ellie one which will be that one and

[43:52] there'll be a Pharaoh one that'll be available as well but I think that Pharaoh one is out already

[43:57] I'm not sure about that anything else going on at Stern John Borg fucked up during the stern tour

[44:04] and said monsters is next and will be out in mid-November will be revealed then so that's fun I

[44:09] always love it when we do a stern factory tour and they let something slip which kind of means

[44:15] that my Elvira 3 prediction is not accurate but monsters will be next and then probably Beatles

[44:21] as well this year and then there's a third game Stern is coming out with I believe the third

[44:27] game Stern is coming out with this year before the year is over will be Primus and I know we saw

[44:32] Jeremy Packer talk about a pinball or primus did or it was either Primus or Packer Zambietti talked

[44:39] about working on something and it was Primus artwork for pinball so that has let that cat out of the

[44:47] bag I I I literally have no desire to own a Primus pinball machine on any level so but if you're

[44:57] a fan of Primus cool you're gonna be excited because that's coming all right what else is going on

[45:02] real quick I want to say congratulations for doing one of the greatest moves ever and that's to

[45:08] Jerry at p3 multi-morphic for finally changing the artwork on lexelite speed and the other games

[45:18] he is now offering new art packages and they look awesome they do the new lexelite speed art

[45:26] looks great it is so much better than the existing lexelite speed art and I think that has always

[45:32] been one of the most annoying easily fixable things that is I think plagued people's desire

[45:40] to sort of have that thing in the game room because of how damn ugly the original lexelite speed

[45:44] artwork was now it looks super cool will that help drive sales I don't know right there's a lot

[45:50] going on in a p3 platform that you need to want to own it's $10,000 it's very expensive

[45:57] but you know look if you want something different at least now you'll have something different

[46:02] with nice art and and I just want to congratulate them on doing that I think it was long overdue

[46:06] and I think there's another game that needs you know little art overhaul and that's October fast

[46:11] all right what else is going on I think we're getting towards the end you know Jersey Jack

[46:18] and Pirates the Caribbean and I've just heard from friends at the show that you know the hype

[46:23] around pirates is probably at the you know there is like no hype anymore and doesn't mean look it

[46:32] doesn't mean you don't think the game is great doesn't mean you don't think the game is fun

[46:35] but man what a missed opportunity what a missed opportunity for Jack to have shown the game so early

[46:42] and now that it's finally going into production you know other games are getting the spotlight other

[46:47] games feel new other games are stealing you know the limelight and and and that is all on Jack

[46:54] it is all on Jack now here is the thing I know Jack's next titles and and a lot of people do

[47:03] because Jack has told many people and I've heard these from many people and you've heard these titles

[47:06] this is not new but I'm here to tell you today here is the order of Jersey Jack pinball machines

[47:13] unless they change it but here is the order as of today that you should expect to see

[47:20] in terms of the next J.J.P games the next game will be Toy Story from Pat Lawler

[47:28] Jack knows lots of people are just waiting for Lawler's next game Toy Story it is

[47:34] amazing theme can't wait after that guns and roses slashes working on it with them amazing

[47:41] and then wonka and that's a that's a stellar you know lineup coming if they can get there it's always

[47:49] an if they can get there you know it's talking to someone in the industry I won't name names

[47:55] they work at another pinball company and they basically said you know Jack just hasn't figured it

[48:01] out by now and it's really a shame but it's really at the point now where his entire company all it is

[48:10] is a billionaire that is just playing with someone else's toys and it's just a matter of time

[48:17] when he gets tired of losing money on those toys and those toys aren't lighting the world on fire

[48:23] like he thought they would and you know that's it you know that billionaire can snap his fingers

[48:28] tomorrow and Jersey Jack pinball is out of business completely out of business nobody would buy them up

[48:32] nobody can afford to buy them up you know stern wouldn't buy them up and you know Jack really

[48:39] hasn't made money on these games and and it's it's a shame you know I hope we get to those titles

[48:44] I do I hope the billionaire has you has you know luckily everyone who's got that much money

[48:49] has made a lot more money in the market and in other areas of the world financially that he could

[48:54] probably absorb the pinball loss but what makes people billionaires is the fact that they don't

[48:59] like losing money they don't like being lied to they don't like failing right they don't like failing

[49:06] you know if pirates that care of being it doesn't sell like two to three thousand units like

[49:10] it's a failure same thing with like the hobbit and dialed in the games if they don't sell

[49:17] enough their failures they're you know they need to sell a certain number to make money for the

[49:22] company to justify all the cost to justify that warehouse to keep the employees paid you know all

[49:27] that stuff cost money it all cost money okay all right there is more news coming from extra which

[49:34] means there will probably be more shows for me every other day now or every day now curious to see

[49:39] what the deep route panel is I think we're done with reveals though I don't think there's any new

[49:43] reveals happening I think everyone got out early in front of the show with their reveals so

[49:48] their games could be on the floor for people to play and talk about here's what I hope doesn't happen

[49:55] I hope the conversation around October Fest doesn't get too nasty because I you know the pinball

[50:02] community and the more the pinside community has a tendency to to going from loving a game one day

[50:11] sleep on it wake up and completely tear the fucking game apart I mean it is like a pinside phenomenon

[50:18] mainly because the people on there are addicted to the site and when you're on that site all day long

[50:25] you have a tendency to become more negative and when you say something negative it gets a reaction

[50:29] it's a it's a never ending cycle there of contempt all right so just let's see what they do they got

[50:35] some very good feedback from a lot of people you know who you are a lot of pinciters gave them good

[50:40] feedback people the show are probably probably giving them good feedback I hope to talk to their

[50:45] marketing director hopefully this week and we will share also some of this feedback and see what's

[50:52] feasible see what's possible and also talk about the future of American pinball and what is next for

[50:57] the company all right everyone have a great day enjoy your Friday drive safe eat pretzels and

[51:05] beer and play pinball with one hand thanks to October Fest we'll talk to you real soon

[51:27] you
