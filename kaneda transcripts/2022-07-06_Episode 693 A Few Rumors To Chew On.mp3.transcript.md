[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canadian Pinball Podcast.

[00:13] Yup, you got two shows in two days, so next time you think about cancelling your subscription,

[00:18] remember who gives you the most pinball content.

[00:21] So first and foremost, there's a really good interview with Ryan McQuade and David Fix

[00:25] over at the super awesome pinball show, so if you haven't heard it yet, go listen to

[00:28] lots of great information there.

[00:30] But what I'm going to do, because no one will come on Canadian Pinball Podcast, because

[00:34] none of the manufacturers want to step into this ring, I'm going to tell you some rumors

[00:39] that I am hearing are some of the stories behind the stories.

[00:44] Because when someone does a podcast, they won't tell you the real, real truth about

[00:48] what went on behind the scenes.

[00:51] Now this is all sort of rumor and speculation because I haven't heard this stuff firsthand,

[00:57] or was I a fly on the wall at these companies, but I'm going to tell you why Josh Coogler

[01:03] I'm hearing is no longer at American Pinball.

[01:06] I'm going to give you a little bit of a rumor I'm hearing about Joe Balser and what happened

[01:09] to him at the end of American Pinball.

[01:11] I'm also going to tell you what I'm hearing Dennis Nordman's next game is based on, okay?

[01:16] I don't know the exact title, but I think we can figure it out together.

[01:20] Also some rumors over at Jersey Jack Pinball about Eric's next game, about Pat Lawler,

[01:26] about where JJP is going.

[01:28] I love doing these shows because this is the stuff that's really exciting to me because

[01:32] nobody wants to have these conversations because when you do this, you don't get the interviews,

[01:37] but I'd rather get this stuff.

[01:38] And Canadian Spinball Podcast has always been about saying stuff that the manufacturers

[01:43] don't want you to know.

[01:45] So here's where I want to start.

[01:46] So here's what I'm hearing happen to Joe Balser.

[01:48] Again, these are all rumors and speculation that Joe Balser was working on a licensed

[01:53] theme game over at American Pinball and the game was packed and the license would have

[01:58] been a smash hit for AP.

[02:01] But then something happened with the license and the deal and so they asked Joe to stop

[02:07] working on that game and to support Dennis Nordman's game.

[02:10] Now again, this is all rumor.

[02:12] Like I don't know if Dennis Nordman needs help from Joe Balser, but I'm hearing that

[02:15] is the reason why Joe Balser was like nope and they sort of parted ways.

[02:20] A source is telling me that Balser had a shooting whitewood and it was his best work.

[02:26] Awesome sculpts and mechs and great shots.

[02:28] So he was pissed at being scrubbed and being second fiddle to Nordman.

[02:33] And this is what led them to letting Joe Balser go.

[02:37] Now poor Joe Balser when you think about it, I mean when he came on board over at American

[02:40] Pinball, they made him sort of second fiddle to John Papaduke.

[02:44] He had a fixed John Papaduke's Houdini.

[02:47] So I can imagine how he would be upset, but look, Joe Balser had his shot.

[02:52] He had his shot.

[02:53] He got to make the game he wanted to make and his suggestion was Octoberfest.

[02:59] So as much as Joe might be pissed off, you can't blame American Pinball for not handing

[03:04] over the reins to Joe Balser after Octoberfest.

[03:08] If you asked me, Joe Balser should have made sure that he picked the right theme and the

[03:12] right game with the right artwork and he needed that game to be a sales success.

[03:18] The funny part is this.

[03:19] Toy Story is a game that's based on a carnival.

[03:22] Octoberfest is actually a much, much better carnival game than Toy Story and it has a

[03:29] lot more in it.

[03:30] The funny thing is if you reskinned Octoberfest into Toy Story 4, it would have made people

[03:36] a lot happier because it actually has carnival rides in the game itself.

[03:41] I'm also hearing that when David Fixed hired Ryan, he knew that the Sonic license was already

[03:47] taken and did it as a PR stunt which also might have upset some of the people at American

[03:53] Pinball.

[03:54] The Legends of Vahala launch I'm hearing was a bit of a disaster because they didn't have

[03:58] enough parts to make 100 games and they also had orders for 200 Hot Wheels, 100 to 125

[04:09] and 75 to 100 Octoberfest.

[04:12] Those orders for Hot Wheels, Houdini and Octoberfest, those were unfulfilled orders

[04:17] that American Pinball needed to make.

[04:20] Now it makes total sense when you read the NAPS News story yesterday that American Pinball

[04:24] is going to go back and make these games.

[04:27] Here's what I'm hearing the climate was like.

[04:29] They've got to make all these old games but Fix really wants to move on to making Dennis

[04:33] Nordman's game.

[04:35] Now Josh Coogler, the man who put the code into those games, was very vocal against releasing

[04:42] a new title before all the open orders were fulfilled.

[04:47] And the reason why he wanted to make the old games first is he knew that if you put out

[04:52] Dennis Nordman's game all of those orders would be cancelled.

[04:56] And the rumor I'm hearing is that Josh was very vocal in meetings about this.

[05:01] And basically I'm hearing because Josh was upset about that, that that's the reason why

[05:05] he was let go.

[05:06] And he was also told on the way out the door not to say anything by a pinball veteran.

[05:12] You can guess who that might be but he hasn't said anything.

[05:15] Josh Coogler has left American Pinball and not really said anything.

[05:20] The other rumor I'm hearing is he's trying to get his homebrew game mass produced.

[05:25] I don't think anyone wants it.

[05:27] So here's another bit of information I'm hearing that Nordman's game is a sequel to

[05:32] his greatest hit.

[05:34] Okay and he's going to be packed and have a great art package and animation.

[05:39] So here's the thing people.

[05:40] So if Dennis Nordman's next game is a sequel and going to have great art and be packed,

[05:44] well we know Christopher Franci is working on the art package.

[05:48] So which game is it?

[05:49] Alright so let's see what Dennis Nordman's games were and how many were produced.

[05:53] So Rapid Fire 5000 produced, Special Force 2750, Party Animal 2250, Blackwooder 3000,

[06:03] Elvira and the Party Monsters 4000, Doctor Dude 4000, Party Zone 4000, Whitewooder 7000

[06:13] produced, Devilish and Man 7000, Indianapolis 52200, Scared Stiff 4000, Pirates 6000, Wheel

[06:22] of Fortune 1000, then we got Woeneli, Lexi Lightspeed, Primus and then Elvira's House of Horrors.

[06:31] So if we're going by Dennis Nordman's older catalog, it's either going to be the sequel

[06:36] to Whitewooder or another Elvira game.

[06:39] I doubt it's going to be Elvira because Stern is still making that game.

[06:43] So you're hearing it right now on Canadian Pinball Podcast people that Dennis Nordman's

[06:47] game is going to be, I'm hearing, this is a rumor, but I'm hearing it is going to be

[06:52] the follow up to Whitewooder, which means it's probably the game he was working on over

[06:58] at Deeproot because he was working on that game for a while.

[07:03] And now we have David Fix saying he's going to make Barry O's Deeproot game.

[07:07] So I fully expect the big game coming from American Pinball that's going to blow us all

[07:12] away is going to be the follow up to Whitewooder.

[07:16] Now, look, Whitewooder is an amazing world under glass.

[07:19] And if done right, I think it could be really cool, but you heard it here.

[07:24] This is going to be most likely the follow up to Whitewooder.

[07:28] And if you go look at the Yukon Yeti game that Deeproot was selling to people like the

[07:32] Whitewood of it, it looks like Whitewooder 2.0.

[07:36] I mean, it's got the same ramps, the same upper play field.

[07:39] It's like that game in just modern form.

[07:42] So you heard it here on Canadian Pinball Podcast and nobody will give me any credit for saying

[07:46] this rumor, but that's the rumor.

[07:48] It makes total sense to do that because if you're going to make a game with Dennis Nordman

[07:52] and you want to do something with an original IP, you might as well fish where the fish

[07:56] are.

[07:57] Now, the only thing is these kinds of themes only appeal to the older Pinball demographic.

[08:02] The new people don't care.

[08:04] Like they don't even know what Whitewooder is.

[08:06] They didn't play these games growing up as much as people think.

[08:09] And so you're not going to nearly get as many buyers as like Venom or a game like James

[08:13] Bond or a game with any licensed theme.

[08:16] But look, if American Pinball can make a packed sequel to Whitewooder, I think that could be

[08:20] an interesting game to put into the marketplace right now.

[08:23] I'm also hearing that the build capacity, you ready for this?

[08:26] Because if you look at the photos over at American Pinball and there's some on Naps

[08:29] Archive, the build capacity is about five games a day, but they still don't have parts

[08:35] to build the rest of their legends of Vahala orders.

[08:38] The problem I'm hearing over at American Pinball is they just don't have enough skilled people

[08:42] to keep the line going for eight hours a day.

[08:45] But hopefully they're turning a corner because I think skilled laborers are something that's

[08:49] hurting everybody.

[08:50] It's not just American Pinball.

[08:52] It's also hurting multimorphic.

[08:53] It's obviously hurting Haggis Pinball.

[08:56] For all of these boutique companies, getting skilled workers on the line has been a huge,

[09:01] huge issue.

[09:03] And I think that's the number one job to be done with all these boutiques over the next

[09:07] six months.

[09:08] They've got to hire people.

[09:10] And I know that means they're going to have to cut into some of their profits, but you

[09:13] can't just trickle out games this slowly because if you get hundreds of orders of like the

[09:19] Whitewater sequel, you can't make people wait like two years to get it.

[09:24] But if you're going to make people wait two years to get it, you've got to be more transparent

[09:28] the way Spooky did it and say, look, we're going to build all these, but it's going to

[09:32] take 18 months.

[09:34] Some rumors over at Jersey Jack Pinball, Pat Lawler was not fired.

[09:38] His contract was up.

[09:40] So this was the final game he was contracted to make.

[09:44] He dragged on Toy Story 4 way too long.

[09:47] And I'm hearing it really did upset the management over at JJP that they waited forever for this

[09:53] game.

[09:54] I'm also hearing that they knew this game wasn't going to like be the smash hit Toy Story

[09:59] game.

[10:00] Everybody wanted, but they saw the pinball market and knew if you just put a lot of beautiful

[10:05] lights in a box, it's going to sell in this crazy marketplace.

[10:10] Pat Lawler is no longer officially with Jersey Jack Pinball and Lawler's had his foot out

[10:16] the door for over a year now.

[10:18] And this was just the final thing they needed to do was get this Toy Story to market.

[10:22] I'm also hearing this rumor and this is upsetting me and I hope this rumor is wrong.

[10:26] I'm hearing that Jersey Jack Pinball is not going to offer replacement playfields for

[10:32] Guns N' Roses.

[10:35] They knew that the playfield issues wouldn't affect sales of Guns N' Roses or Toy Story,

[10:39] so they've scrapped the idea to offer us replacement playfields at cost.

[10:44] Again, this is just a rumor.

[10:46] When I talked to Ken last week, he said he was looking into this, but Jersey Jack said

[10:50] they would offer us replacement playfields.

[10:53] And if they cut bait on that offer, I think that's going to upset a lot of people.

[10:58] And you best believe that Canada is not going to let up on this because a lot of us have

[11:04] playfields with issues and we were told we would be able to buy a replacement.

[11:09] And I think the reason why they're going to scrap it is if you look at Toy Story, they

[11:13] removed the art from around the post areas and added washers.

[11:17] So I bet they don't want to redo the art package on G&R and remove that art near the post,

[11:23] but that's probably what they're going to need to do to ensure that the new playfields

[11:27] don't pool and chip.

[11:29] So do the work.

[11:31] Why can't they just do the work?

[11:32] We spend so much money on these games, I want my replacement collector's edition playfield.

[11:38] All right.

[11:38] And my source also is someone who spent a lot of time on Eric's next game, which is contractually

[11:45] obligated to be out in 2022.

[11:49] So you're hearing it here.

[11:50] This game is coming out in 2022.

[11:52] My source would not confirm what the title is, but Godfather seems like the best bet.

[11:59] It is less packed than his other games, but still has a lot in it.

[12:03] And it has a really neat mech.

[12:05] Much better shots and no multi-balls every two seconds.

[12:10] But I'm also hearing that the theme integration is just weird.

[12:14] The theme isn't really a pinball theme.

[12:17] The assets don't make sense and the game is just weird.

[12:21] Okay.

[12:22] So this makes me believe that it is Godfather because that is the weirdest theme to turn

[12:27] into pinball.

[12:29] And I also will say this.

[12:30] The rumor I'm hearing is that Eric's following game is a complete mystery.

[12:34] And Jersey Jack Pinball is really trying to clamp down on all of the leaks because this

[12:41] company has been plagued by nothing but people knowing what's coming before they even want

[12:46] you to know it.

[12:47] So I think they're going to do a better job of keeping everything secret the way Stern

[12:52] does.

[12:52] Well, we kind of know Stern's titles too.

[12:54] So that's just it.

[12:55] You know, a few rumors to share with all of you guys.

[12:58] I love doing this show.

[12:59] I don't have to do like 30 minute shows or hour long shows.

[13:03] I can just give you what I'm hearing and what's happening behind the scenes and all this seems

[13:07] to hold up.

[13:08] All of this seems like it has some truth to it.

[13:10] Josh Coogler leaves.

[13:12] We never hear anything from him.

[13:13] We haven't seen Legends of Ahala's being unboxed.

[13:16] We know they have to go back and make the old orders of the older games, you know, but

[13:20] there's a real drive to get Dennis Norman's game out the door.

[13:24] And if Dennis Norman was working on this game at Deeproot for like a couple years or a year,

[13:29] why not do it?

[13:31] So that's the thing.

[13:31] I think we're going to see Dennis Norman as a Whitewater sequel.

[13:35] The other thing that's crazy is this is like we've never seen Jersey Jack release two games

[13:39] in a year.

[13:40] So if Godfather comes out this year, what is that going to do to Toy Story orders and

[13:45] Toy Story builds?

[13:47] I don't know.

[13:47] It's a really interesting second half of the year, if you ask me.

[13:51] All of these companies with the recession happening, with the pinball prices going through

[13:56] the roof, but I think the biggest failure at American Pinball, they need to get all of

[14:00] these legends of Ahala's to customers because who's going to want to own one when Whitewater

[14:05] too comes out at the same price?

[14:08] That's got more in it.

[14:09] That's a better game.

[14:11] You know, and Coogler is right.

[14:12] If they release Dennis Norman's game, everyone's going to cancel Houdini, Oktoberfest and Hot Wheels.

[14:19] I don't even know what Ryan McQuade is working on, but American Pinball just needs to get

[14:22] their stuff together.

[14:23] I mean, every time I hear them talk, it's all talk, all talk, all talk.

[14:27] They need to show us they can make a great game.

[14:30] We haven't seen it yet.

[14:31] Everybody have a great day.

[14:32] I'll talk to you soon.

[14:33] Wow.

[14:34] It was good.

[14:35] Wow.

[14:36] Wow.

[14:37] Wow.

[14:38] Yeah, you were so good.

[14:39] Yeah, you were so good.

[14:40] That's right.

[14:41] That's right.

[14:42] That's right.

[14:43] That's right.

[14:44] That's right.

[14:45] That's right.

[14:46] That's right.

[14:47] That's right.

[14:48] That's right.

[14:49] That's right.

[14:50] That's right.

[14:51] That's right.

[14:52] That's right.

[14:53] That's right.

[14:54] That's right.

[14:55] That's right.

[14:56] That's right.

[14:58] That's right.

[14:59] That's right.

[15:00] That's right.

[15:01] That's right.

[15:02] That's right.

[15:03] That's right.

[15:04] That's right.

[15:05] That's right.

[15:06] That's right.

[15:07] That's right.

[15:08] That's right.

[15:09] That's right.

[15:10] That's right.

[15:11] That's right.

[15:12] That's right.

[15:13] That's right.

[15:14] That's right.

[15:15] That's right.

[15:16] That's right.

[15:17] That's right.

[15:18] That's right.

[15:19] That's right.

[15:20] That's right.

[15:21] That's right.

[15:22] That's right.

[15:23] That's right.

[15:24] That's right.

[15:25] That's right.

[15:26] That's right.
