[00:00] I'm sitting at a ball on the inside

[00:03] We can pull my ride on the outside

[00:06] She stole my heart in the trailer park

[00:10] So I tracked the keys to her fucking cart

[00:13] And crashed that piece of shit then stepped away

[00:25] Isn't it a glorious, glorious week in Pimball

[00:28] When we know we're gonna get to see a brand new Pimball machine for the first time out in the world

[00:35] And that is what it's like this week

[00:38] As we prepare for the stern reveal of Deadpool Pimball

[00:43] It could happen today

[00:45] It could happen tomorrow

[00:47] I think the most likely times we'll see this game will either be Tuesday

[00:54] Which is today or Friday

[00:56] I think those are my bets for when we will see the reveal of Stern's Deadpool Pimball machine

[01:01] Now the problem in the past is this

[01:03] And this is what I miss about stern reveals

[01:06] It would normally go down something like this

[01:09] I would hear from some of my friends at Stern when the game would be revealed

[01:13] And I would say on my podcast when you could expect the reveal to happen

[01:18] And then Zach would get pissed off and hold the reveal

[01:20] To prove once again that Canadian Pimball podcast

[01:23] Is not the legitimate source for Pimball news

[01:26] But anyway, I think we're going to see it very very soon

[01:29] And I'm excited and I want to talk a little bit about

[01:33] This sort of the excitement before singing you Pimball machine

[01:37] And how Stern delivers this excitement to us time and time again

[01:42] Because I think if most of us are honest

[01:45] We get really giddy

[01:46] I mean we get really really giddy before we see a new Pimball machine

[01:50] There's something about this hobby

[01:51] And I've never really been in another hobby that's quite like Pimball

[01:55] Where there's a cycle of excitement and hype and expectation

[02:01] That just seems to trip over each other

[02:06] As we wait for a new Pimball machine

[02:07] And I also think there's an excitement and a hype and an enthusiasm

[02:12] That only comes when you reveal and release Pimball machines the right way

[02:19] And here we go again

[02:20] Right Stern showed us a teaser of Deadpool Pimball

[02:26] Like a few days ago

[02:28] And now we're going to see the final product in just a few days

[02:32] And guess what?

[02:33] In a matter of like a week or two

[02:36] Not only are you going to see Jack Danger flipping the machine

[02:39] But you're going to be able to order it

[02:41] And I guarantee you

[02:43] Within a week or two

[02:45] There will be Deadpool's that are already on the line at Stern

[02:49] Going into the homes of customers and out into the hands of operators around the world

[02:55] And all of that being known

[02:58] How dare we even ask the question is Stern an evil company

[03:02] Right so let's talk about Deadpool

[03:05] Alright because I have a little bet going

[03:08] I have a bet with Marty over at Head to Head Pimball

[03:11] Where we have a bet about the Bobblehead teaser video that Stern put out there

[03:16] So I am here to tell you that my bet is that that Bobblehead is 100% fake

[03:23] That there's no way that's going into the game

[03:26] That Stern is totally taking the piss out of all of the jokes around the tie fighter on a spring

[03:33] And they are basically using Deadpool marketing to take the piss out of everybody

[03:39] And we saw it also George Gomez uploaded a funny picture of them designing the game

[03:45] And it was like a little Deadpool action figure that was drawing with a sharpie marker

[03:49] This is how Deadpool the film marketed itself

[03:53] It made fun of traditional movie marketing

[03:56] I think Stern is taking the piss out of us

[03:58] Now here's my bet with Ryan

[04:01] Did I say Marty?

[04:02] It's with Ryan over at Head to Head Pimball

[04:04] So Ryan and I have a bet

[04:06] He doesn't think that's going to be in the game

[04:09] And his rationale is that he's like look at it Chris

[04:12] It's sculpted, someone would have to make this

[04:14] Like there's no way it's got to be in the game

[04:16] And I said to him, Ryan what are you talking about man?

[04:19] Like that Stern Pimball

[04:21] They think it easily make a sculpt like this in one day

[04:26] And take the piss out of people with this

[04:29] And I love the way the video like lingers on the head Bobbling

[04:32] Yeah, so okay, so here's the bet

[04:34] If he's right, if he's right

[04:37] And this thing makes its way into the game

[04:40] All right, here's what I'm going to do

[04:42] I have to if I lose the bet

[04:44] I have to appear on Head to Head Pimball

[04:48] And be their guest

[04:49] And all I'm allowed to do though is laugh in the background

[04:53] So they have basically commissioned me to be a background laugh track

[04:56] Which I will happily do

[04:58] I'm going to start practicing a laugh that makes me sound like

[05:02] I'm about to die any second

[05:04] And if I'm right, if I'm right

[05:07] Then Ryan's scene needs to come on to the show and be a guest again

[05:11] Because I know you guys loved it when Ryan was on the show

[05:13] And we actually kind of kicked off his Pimball podcast in career

[05:17] Right here on Canatus Pimball podcast

[05:20] So we would love to have Ryan return as a guest

[05:22] Okay, so let's talk about Pimball

[05:24] So here's what I'm hearing

[05:25] And this is also what I love about Stern

[05:28] Is they know perfectly how to drum a pipe

[05:30] So I was talking to a friend who has seen the game

[05:34] Right he has seen the game and I asked him and said

[05:37] Hey, like I know you can't tell me much

[05:39] But like what's your overall opinions about Deadpool

[05:43] And here's what he told me he said look

[05:45] I wasn't that interested in Deadpool as a theme

[05:49] I wasn't expecting to want this game

[05:52] But after seeing the game

[05:54] And seeing what zombie Yeti has done with this game

[05:57] I am now on board and I am saving up to get one

[06:02] And he basically said to me

[06:04] That this is the best art package that zombie Yeti has ever done

[06:09] Okay, he's just like wait you see it

[06:11] Wait you see it

[06:12] And so I, you know, of course

[06:14] Like when someone tells you stuff like that

[06:16] You're like oh my god, I gotta go get an L.E.

[06:19] Like that's like the first thing I know he's pops into my mind

[06:21] Is like this fear of missing out

[06:23] And so

[06:24] You know do I think this is gonna be zombie Yeti's finest art creation at Stern Pimbal

[06:29] To date and I actually do and here's why I think comic book style

[06:34] Deadpool art style actually fits his kind of illustrations perfectly

[06:41] Perfectly and I bet he was given a little bit more freedom than he was on iron maiden

[06:46] And then he was on ghost busters

[06:48] And so we even saw like in the leaked image of what we saw in terms of just the line drawn

[06:54] Of what he was doing with Deadpool

[06:56] That it looks freaking awesome. So yes, I do expect this to be incredible

[07:00] I also expect zombie Yeti to deliver

[07:04] Three stellar art packages and I think we saw this with iron maiden is we're not gonna get

[07:09] Just like subtle little changes to the differing kinds of games

[07:14] Where you know, it's almost like when you look at

[07:16] Guardians of the galaxy and how those three different cabinet packages were delivered to us

[07:22] It doesn't feel like they were like radically like completely redrawn with different themes in mind

[07:29] It kind of feels like

[07:30] Christopher francey like drew different elements of the game and they just positioned them differently for the three different cabinets

[07:36] They also made the colossal mistake of making the Ellie cabinet the least striking and visually appealing

[07:45] Right and we heard from francey wise he he put the best art package on the pro cabinet

[07:49] Because he thought most people would see that and even admits that he learned his lesson and the Ellie needs to be the nicest

[07:55] Oh my god, I have to have that so I think zombie Yeti

[07:59] Clearly understands and we saw this with iron maiden how to deliver three distinct

[08:04] Incredible art packages and just like in iron maiden though right what excites me is

[08:09] I don't think anyone who got any version of iron maiden feels like they made a compromise in the art package

[08:16] They're getting they were all great like they could have substituted

[08:20] The pro for the premium the premium for the Ellie and people still would have been extremely extremely happy with what they got so

[08:27] We know

[08:28] We know that zombie Yeti is gonna knock this game out of the park so from a visual standpoint

[08:34] Deadpool is just gonna be incredible all right. There's there's no denying that

[08:39] My big question is this and this is what if if you were to ask me what do I wish for when I think about dead?

[08:46] Pool pinball

[08:47] You know, I think we all know the basic layout what we got in that leak is going to be the basic layout

[08:53] What I'm hoping for is this

[08:56] I really hope that there is a mechanism or two that is in this game that really

[09:02] Sort of sets the game apart that doesn't just feel like we're using the same you know same cookie cutter ramps

[09:09] That we're getting in in Batman that we're not getting the same sort of sword lock

[09:14] You know philosophy from Lord of the Rings which we see the sword the saber blade on on the right which is really cool

[09:19] But where are the mechs like where are the mechs at stern pinball?

[09:24] Where are the days when they would design like the Batman crane toy to go into Batman dark night like where are there gonna be

[09:31] Mechs in this game are there gonna be things that the ball interacts with

[09:36] That are special that are magical that are awesome and I'm not sure like I'm not sure of what we're seeing

[09:42] And that very early whitewood. I'm not sure if we're seeing the pro

[09:46] Or if we're seeing the premium Ellie version of the game, but that's just what I'm hoping for

[09:51] That we get a really cool mech in this game

[09:54] There's also a lot of conversation running who's coding the game, you know, is it Lonnie? Is it Dwight?

[09:59] I think the consensus is that Dwight is doing

[10:03] The monsters with Borg so he's probably not designed as so is this Lonnie

[10:08] I also think stern is moving into an error now

[10:12] Where the coding for their games is not gonna just be penned by one individual we know they've hired a whole

[10:21] Group of people to help with coding moving forward

[10:24] So that they avoid releasing games with embarrassingly spartan code like Batman and Guardians the galaxy because as we know like

[10:33] There's nothing worse than a game shipping and people opening it up and and being disappointed and having to wait a year

[10:39] So I think stern probably has a bunch of coders on this that you might not even know who they are

[10:46] And though they're probably being guided if I had to guess

[10:49] By Lonnie on this game

[10:51] But it's a George Gomez designed game which he took over from John Trudeau

[10:57] And I think we see some quintessential

[10:59] Gomez elements on this machine now what excites me is this is

[11:03] I don't know about you guys, but I've always felt that George's games

[11:07] Always shoot really well, you know some of them have a little clonkiness, but not terrible not

[11:13] It's never a brickfest

[11:15] And I think in this error where like a lot of new games are coming out which I believe to have poor design

[11:21] I would rather have a George Gomez

[11:24] We're even if some of the elements are borrowed or lifted from some of his previous games

[11:29] I would rather shoot a game that shoots well

[11:33] Even if it has things that are reminiscent of previous games versus a completely new layout that's a brickfest

[11:40] You know and I read on Pinside a lot of people out there who try to cheerly the new companies

[11:45] I think they try to make excuses for poor design

[11:49] You know every time I remember when I was at Sunshine that this like moment

[11:54] Where I you know I've always been pooping on Star Wars and whatnot

[11:57] And then I jumped on Houdini and it was just like brick brick brick brick

[12:02] And I was having absolutely no fun

[12:04] And then I walked over to Star Wars a game that I had been making fun of on this show for a really long time

[12:09] And guess what the ball was in play

[12:11] The ball was in play for a while the ball's looping around the ball's moving all over the place

[12:15] I'm having fun because the ball's in play

[12:18] And that's the thing is like these stupid brickfest games

[12:22] I just don't think um are fun at all all right

[12:25] So I fully expect Deadpool to shoot to shoot well all right

[12:30] Uh

[12:31] So will there be in R-rated mode in Deadpool

[12:36] And that's another big question I have because we all know this is an R-rated pinball theme

[12:41] And I don't have we ever had an R-rated Stern pinball game

[12:45] And I I don't know I don't the walking dead is not R-rated

[12:51] I just don't think we've ever had a game

[12:54] That literally needs to curse at you and literally needs to have adult jokes and comedy come at

[13:00] you um what I'm hoping they do is have an R-rated mode

[13:04] Uh now that would mean they would have to code it separately to turn that mode on and it will

[13:09] Stern put the resources behind that uh because Deadpool is an R-rated movie

[13:14] It's an R-rated comic so it would only make sense if you're gonna give the fans of dead pool

[13:21] What they expect that the game would be R-rated so more to come on that but that's another thing

[13:25] I'm wondering about

[13:27] Wonder learning about like what's going on with me this morning

[13:30] All right another question I have about deadpool is what will the Ellie package have now we saw

[13:36] Stern

[13:38] Turn the corner with iron made in Ellie. We saw them put into iron made in Ellie

[13:43] The metallic decals on the cabinets. We saw them put in the upgraded speakers

[13:48] We saw them put in the shaker motor. We saw them put in all this stuff

[13:53] Uh, you know the side decals inside the cabinet it came fully loaded as an Ellie for for $9,000

[14:00] They basically gave people pretty much what people got in Batman S-L-E

[14:06] For the reduced cost of $9,000 now my question is will this trend of fully upgrading the Ellie's continue

[14:17] Onto iron made in Ellie. I don't did it

[14:20] I think it also came with the non-reflective glass and and that is the thing

[14:23] It's it's gonna be hard for them to now go back and not give you the upgraded sound system not give you the upgraded decals

[14:30] You know not do those things. I had speculated that Stern jam pack those items into

[14:37] Iron made in Ellie because they didn't have to pay

[14:41] For the full R&D cost of iron made in because that game was already designed by Keith as archer

[14:48] So that is another thing. I'm I'm hoping we see

[14:51] That the features that we got in iron made and we'll carry over into deadpool all right

[14:56] All right anything else other than we just are really in a holding pattern to see when Stern pulls the kernen off of this game and

[15:05] I guess the final question I'll ask on this show is do I think the Ellie's of deadpool will sell out

[15:12] And do I think there's gonna be a run on the game and so here's here's the thing

[15:17] I don't think it's already sold out in fact. I know it's not already sold out you can go to game exchange and

[15:22] JJ over there is accepting

[15:25] $1,000 deposits on an on a on a deadpool Ellie now they've changed their policy a bit and I was talking to JJ about this

[15:32] They've changed their policy that you have to give a thousand dollar deposit now and once the game is revealed you owe an additional

[15:40] $1,000 and then you're committed so that I think at that point the money doesn't become refundable and here's why they had to do that

[15:47] It's because two titles that had a lot of hype that people went in on early

[15:53] Two titles really failed to sort of capture the imagination of people and people bailed and those two titles

[16:00] were Star Wars Ellie which Stern made way too many at 800 and Guardians of the Galaxy Ellie and I think both of those titles

[16:09] they really struggled

[16:11] To secure buyers

[16:12] I think they they easily got people on the waiting list for it

[16:16] And so by the time the game was revealed there was already like 400 people to buy Guardians of the Galaxy or 600 however many it was and then Batman was 800

[16:26] But I think if Stern were smart. I would set the deadpool limited edition number at 400

[16:32] 500 max

[16:34] If it says amazing as I'm hearing I think this game will

[16:40] Will probably sell out and remember there's not

[16:43] 500 people is

[16:45] Sounds like a lot

[16:46] But here's why Stern Ellie sell out because people will get the game in within a month or two

[16:52] And I then I think money burns a hole in the pocket of pinball people now

[16:57] Speaking of Stern one final note I want to make on this episode of canate is pinball pod gets episode

[17:02] 254 which I was wrong when I called last episode 243

[17:07] Where are the Stern toppers lately like what's going on in topper land over at Stern

[17:13] So we never ever got the topper for Star Wars. I don't know what's going on

[17:18] I can't possibly imagine it would take them a year to make a topper for a game

[17:23] Whoever is on that topper what and where where are the toppers for iron maiden and I also know they're working on those toppers

[17:30] So I'm just curious because as a pinball collector

[17:35] Uh, I love toppers and I think a lot of you out there do love to put toppers on your pinball machines

[17:41] And I always think these games arrive a little naked when they arrive without toppers

[17:46] I mean just look at a company like Chicago gaming company the topper becomes so much of the excitement around getting

[17:53] The Ellie versions of their games and we fully expect monster bash remake to come with the most stellar topper possible

[18:00] Look at the amazing topper jackas put on top of pirates the car being collectors edition

[18:05] There's just something that always feels like the game is naked when it arrives without a topper

[18:11] Especially when you're buying the premium version of the game

[18:14] So I'm just curious to see where maidens topper is at um

[18:17] I'm also curious to see if there will be a deadpool topper that we will get all right. Let's move on to

[18:23] Jerseyjack pinball

[18:25] So there is literally nothing but silence and the thread is like buried about pirates of the Caribbean

[18:33] Production and the games are on the line which is interesting to me that we're just in that calm before the storm

[18:41] People are waiting for their games. They're waiting patiently

[18:44] Once again, we are just we're in august of 2018 and we saw this game in october

[18:51] Of 2017 so I I just want people to get the game

[18:56] I also think it couldn't happen at a worse time

[19:01] Because look I don't think pirates of the Caribbean has like a thousand game sold

[19:05] I don't think it it does and I think that

[19:08] Once the game starts shipping people are going to wait to see

[19:12] What the reaction is before they go in on one?

[19:15] I think if jack had done what stern has done with deadpool imagine this

[19:20] Imagine if jack had revealed

[19:23] Pirates of the Caribbean a week ago and imagine if he said the game is gonna ship in a way

[19:31] Imagine if he could actually just take a page from stern

[19:35] And pull the curtain off that game because if you go back and you look at the hype he had

[19:40] When he pulled the curtain off of that game people were throwing money at that game like throwing money at it

[19:47] People where I think like the collectors editions with 250

[19:51] We're almost like sold out. I think Ellie's were being ordered like left and right and what has happened since then

[19:58] Here's what's happened since then

[20:00] Nobody knew is going in on it the only thing that's happened is people are pulling their orders and waiting

[20:07] Why wouldn't you why would you lock your money up for a year that

[20:12] Give a refundable deposit on a game that is never even gonna be that limited to begin with

[20:17] So I you know again, I just think that like

[20:21] It's so unfortunate that it's so easy

[20:24] What you need to do to have the most hype when you sell your game?

[20:28] I mean the same thing with spooky like why did Charlie show it at tpf

[20:33] Like he sees the way you do it

[20:36] He didn't need the money because he's got t and a on the line

[20:40] And it's just a head scratcher the way these companies

[20:45] Just don't get it like show your product when it's ready like don't show it early like there's there's no benefit

[20:52] To doing that unless you really need the money

[20:56] But you know, I just it continues to boggle my mind and I really wish pirates would have been

[21:03] Released into the world

[21:05] In the right way and and again like I was in on one like and the thing is too is this is when you do it the way Stern does it

[21:13] You remove people's ability to second guess and overthink it you tap into their fear of missing out

[21:20] You tap into the hype and they're super you know excited and you capture them at that moment

[21:27] When that moment's gone you can't recreate it you can't recreate it

[21:31] So we wait to see when pirates will go out the door

[21:35] All right, what else do I want to talk about on this episode of canada's pinball podcast?

[21:39] There are a couple

[21:41] Total nuclear annihilations for sale these are used games. Let me tell you how much people want for their tna's used

[21:49] One one is being sold for $7,250

[21:53] The other one which is fully loaded with a butter cabinet they want $7,800 for it

[22:00] So that indicates to me that these games

[22:03] people are

[22:05] Trying to sell them for as much if not more than they paid for them because

[22:11] They know there's a line to get the game

[22:14] So they're trying to ask a little bit of a premium or dollar to dollar on the game

[22:19] Because they know you'd have to wait now

[22:21] I heard that spooky has sold someone of like I think like 455

[22:27] Total nuclear annihilations and I just want to congratulate

[22:31] Scott Denise on giving Charlie this savior of of spooky pinball in 2018 because

[22:40] Think about it without tna there's nothing on the line for the all those months

[22:44] So and now it is the most successful by far

[22:49] Spooky game of all time, you know how many jetzins and how many how many did they make like you I never see anyone

[22:57] Opening up the jetzins and even saying they bought one like did they is it the rarest pinball machine ever like are we like 20 years from now

[23:05] When this whole hobby is dead and gone and people are trying to collect the rare pinball machines

[23:09] Is the jetzins gonna be the the king Kong of the future?

[23:14] Is it gonna be the the kingpin? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think so but anyway

[23:20] Something I want to talk about and this has sort of been like on Pinside and and we talked about it on the last episode

[23:27] I want to talk about the whole godzilla

[23:29] You know and spooky and and stern and I got a chance to read Charlie's

[23:35] Interview that he did on or he did his own podcast or he interviewed with this week in pinball about it

[23:40] And I just want to say that

[23:43] This is a really really interesting topic to read up on to to to to dive into

[23:49] Because there are a lot of emotions and there's a lot of different opinions about what went down and so just to recap for everybody

[23:59] Toho which is a

[24:02] License of godzilla which makes more of like the Japanese godzilla movies

[24:06] I think I saw the last toho godzilla movie which was really weird

[24:09] It was like all these guys in a conference room like figuring out how to like beat godzilla and I took my I took Brenda

[24:17] And our friends to it and they were like what the fuck is this man like I'm like, I don't know man like

[24:22] Bunch of dudes talking Japanese with PowerPoint trying to save freaking tokyo

[24:26] But but trust me like godzilla is gonna fucking appear at some point

[24:30] He appears like so late into the movie anyway, but chucking bug are like the biggest godzilla fans

[24:36] Like they've got godzilla memorabilia covering an entire wall of their of their home

[24:42] They they are like they're like to godzilla what what guns and roses was to me like they know it

[24:48] Like they know the nuances they know everything about it

[24:51] And this was like a dream theme for them and apparently

[24:56] They went to get the license and they found out later on that somebody wanted that license more than them

[25:02] And that company was stern pimpal now

[25:06] You can imagine how pissed off you would be to find out that stern swooped in and took the license that was your dream

[25:14] And also because there's the belief that stern will not make a toho godzilla game because it's too small of a property for them to bother with

[25:24] There is speculation that if stern went after the major motion picture godzilla franchise coming out

[25:29] That they would simply also acquire the toho license as a means to block any other version of godzilla from coming out

[25:39] Hence

[25:40] Cornering the godzilla marketplace now that's a smart business move if you ask me

[25:45] I mean there's a lot of talk of like stern's just evil and how could they do this and

[25:50] I

[25:51] Here's how I want to talk about this because I also read something that Charlie said and it literally made me do a face palm

[25:58] because I really think that

[26:01] Charlie needs to wake up and join the modern world of business and stop thinking that pinball is all about like

[26:12] Making the pinball community happy and like yes

[26:16] You know who makes the pinball community the most happy? Let's just all stop like

[26:21] Pretending it's not them. It's stern pinball. I mean who has done the most for the pinball community

[26:27] It's the company that continually delivers the most popular themes in pinball gives everyone four to six games a year to choose from

[26:37] Has the best customer service? You know, I mean it look

[26:40] It's just it's so annoying to me that stern always gets positioned as like well

[26:44] They didn't do it for the community but you I can't even go into any barcade going go into any people's homes where they have collections

[26:52] And you tell me which company is is making games that that help grow the pinball community

[26:59] All right, it's not the company making a hundred fifty games or 300

[27:02] It's the game. It's the company selling 10,000 games a year 15,000 games a year all right

[27:08] But I want to read what Charlie said and again like I get it like he's emotional like I understand

[27:14] Where he's coming from

[27:16] But I also think Charlie needs to like wake up a little bit and realize that these companies are not his friends

[27:23] Like they're not out there to help him sell games

[27:26] So he wrote this he wrote

[27:29] So to all our friends at stern George Gomez you're a good dude

[27:34] And I did offer I shouldn't say this but what the hell I'm feeling feisty today

[27:39] I offered to consult on the game

[27:42] Stern's toho Godzilla with bug for free

[27:46] I offered as I put it to George. Let's change the culture a little bit

[27:52] Okay, I want to stop there. I want to stop there and talk about that offer

[27:57] I really do because are you kidding me Charlie like you literally I get it

[28:04] But you run a company that makes pinball machines that is also trying to get money from

[28:10] The same customers that buy stern pinball machines and I'm gonna read later on where Charlie thinks they're not the same customers

[28:17] I don't agree with that

[28:18] But you don't offer to help your competitor make a product

[28:23] Okay, okay, in what world does that happen now there are instances where companies might collaborate on a product

[28:31] Which is much different but do you really think?

[28:34] Do you really think that if I do marketing for Coca-Cola and I

[28:39] And we really want to get Beyonce and we're the biggest Beyonce fans and Beyonce signs up with Pepsi that we would offer

[28:48] To help Pepsi with their activities because we're such big fans. I mean, it's just it's

[28:54] Charlie do you ever think they would help you do you think

[28:59] Jersey Jack is gonna help these guys like what?

[29:03] I just I mean I get it. I get where you're coming from

[29:06] But I think you need to wake up and realize that you're in a business that is competing

[29:12] With these people he then goes on to say

[29:16] He um he said there is no point in pinball companies attacking each other in this day and age

[29:22] The market is too small the customers are all the same

[29:27] You'll have your stern fans and your spooky fans and your Jersey Jack fans and your American fans and all other pinball companies that are out there

[29:35] So I kind of think Charlie looks at pinball like

[29:40] You know one company is the Yankees one company is the Metz you know one company is like the nationals one company is the Cardinals

[29:48] And it's like they're all gonna have their fans and can't we all just like get along in a sport called baseball and it's

[29:54] It's not like that in pinball, you know in pinball if if if we were to use sport as a metaphor

[30:03] You know i'm only gonna go to one game this year and I have to pick which game I go to

[30:10] And I'll go to any teams game if they have the best

[30:14] Team on the field right? I do think that people will cross shop these machines all the time if the machines are good enough

[30:23] and you know

[30:24] I think that pinball it's small in the sense that I think people who frequently buy pinball machines

[30:31] They're well aware of all the options that they have you know if I have

[30:36] $8,000 and $9,000 to buy a game

[30:38] I don't think most people are like I'm only gonna buy a Jersey Jack or I'm only gonna buy a stern

[30:42] I'm only gonna buy a spookier. I'm only gonna buy American pinball. I think people say I'm gonna buy the best game

[30:48] That is available

[30:50] That I like I do I think for the most part people will throw money at themes without even thinking about it that much

[30:57] You know, I just reading frolic on pinside. He's like he's like I don't even know anything about deadpool

[31:02] But if it looks good, I'm gonna buy it like it's like it's so it's like you know

[31:06] You've got some of these people that will just buy buy buy

[31:09] You've got some people like rodo Dave and like the hilton's of the world who will simply support anybody but stern

[31:15] And they'll always go in on like you know the spooky games the American pinball games

[31:19] You've got those guys who cheerly the boutique companies always claiming that the games are great regardless if they are or not

[31:25] But I don't think

[31:27] You know pinball is this world Charlie where like stern pinball is like we want eight competitors

[31:35] You know because here's what Chuck thinks I and Chuck I'm I would happily have you come on the show to to talk about this

[31:42] But I do think that Chuck and some of the boutique guys out there they just have this mentality that

[31:47] More pinball companies equals more pinball out in the world which equals more pinball buyers and community and players and tournament players

[31:54] And we're growing the hobby and and and my response to that is this

[31:59] um stern pinball

[32:01] sells thousands of games a year the pinball hobby will grow

[32:06] Simply if they continue to make great games nobody else is growing the community like none of these boutiques are even making a dent when it comes to pinball growth

[32:16] Uh, they they aren't they are simply they're like those fish that

[32:21] Glow on the sharks that you know clean the you know the clean the shark like yes

[32:26] They're part of the ecosystem of pinball like a lot of these smaller boutiques are part of the pinball ecosystem

[32:31] But they aren't growing pinball. They aren't bringing in tons of new buyers or players. It's stern that's doing that

[32:39] You know, and then we go down the list of like only when you have volume of production are you growing pinball?

[32:45] And so I think when Charlie says like there's room for all of us

[32:50] Of course there is of course there is I'm not saying there's not Charlie

[32:53] But I think you need to realize

[32:55] That stern probably would rather see

[32:58] Competition go out of business versus helping the competition out and you saw it yourself man like when they walk into a room

[33:07] They must have been jody who did this no one ever says names. It's funny. We're like who could it be like Zach is a really nice guy

[33:14] So must have been jody

[33:16] When you were having a licensure agreement Charlie tells the story the stern marketing guy walks into the room

[33:22] In the middle of Chuck's meeting and tells the guy I'll call you

[33:27] Like yeah, like that's kind of a dick move, but you know what that's business

[33:32] You know, I literally I can't for the life of me

[33:35] Understand why the world of business and and and jockeying for better position than your competition

[33:42] Is in abnormality it is what goes on in the world of business

[33:46] It's all that happens in in business

[33:49] You know Brenda works for a seafood company that is it has tons of competition now that they would never they would never call up a competitor

[33:57] And be like hey can we really help you guys like we've got some ideas on how you could better position your company

[34:03] No, it doesn't happen all right

[34:06] So look Charlie I just want to say like I know your hearts in the right place. I do and I know that

[34:11] I think you know Charlie position spooky as a company that is always gonna do what's best for pinball

[34:17] Regardless of profit like I was reading in the pin-side thread and you know the one guy who every time he talks

[34:24] We just all get stupider and dumber um hilton chimes in with his you know

[34:30] This this really idiotic statement and he goes you know you guys like

[34:35] Charlie's doing everything for the best of the community

[34:37] They worked really hard to get the bomb as low as they could on total nuclear annihilation

[34:43] And they're making the least amount of money on each TNA compared to the other games

[34:48] They've made all for the betterment of the community and I'm just like first of all hilton

[34:54] Like are you stupid man? Like you should not have said that like you're why are you like devolging

[35:00] Um Charlie's business practices and letting us know that they're not making much money on TNA

[35:06] Um, I also think you know Charlie needs to start focusing on as much profit as possible because look

[35:14] Like Charlie like his games like him or not the only thing that will keep spooky around is profit

[35:20] And that's the thing that ultimately

[35:23] A lot of these people on pin-side and fans don't get is profit keeps you in business

[35:30] um profit equals pinball

[35:32] Goodwill and doing what's right for the community and being a nice guy doesn't matter

[35:37] At the end of the day the balance sheet is what will keep companies around and if you want your companies to stick around

[35:44] Um, you know, I think they need to make games that are worthy of you buying them and this is the other part that

[35:50] I again, I've just always felt this way. I think a lot of these boutiques they rely on the goodwill

[35:57] and and the charity of people to support someone who's not a big company to survive and again

[36:05] I think that goodwill runs out at some point and it has to be a great game

[36:10] And I'm not saying they're not trying to make great games

[36:12] But if you want to sell a game that costs more than a stern pro and stern pros giving me like one of the biggest themes in the world

[36:20] With some of the best artists in the world with some of the best code in the world and your game cost a thousand dollars more

[36:26] And it's not as good how you gonna survive how you gonna survive

[36:30] You're gonna have to you know develop a fanbase and look I think Charlie has it. I think spooky has

[36:36] Very loyal spooky customers

[36:39] Uh, are there 500 of them? I don't know we'll find out will they sell every Alice Cooper at Nightmare Castle

[36:45] But I just want to close this podcast and saying a few things

[36:48] I think that it is an amazing new golden air of pinball. There are so many options out there

[36:54] I think that pinball companies that make games for the betterment of the community is a silly target

[37:01] You make games that that should just be a great pinball game because when you make a great game

[37:06] You know what will happen money

[37:09] You know when you create something of value the money will come

[37:12] When you make something that's not really great and you just hope the money comes because you want people to support pinball

[37:19] I don't think that's gonna last and and I think that

[37:23] There's a lot of competition out there right now and I think a lot of you guys realize this

[37:27] It's like holy shit like we're gonna get monster bash remake soon

[37:29] We're gonna get like pirates the Caribbean we have Deadpool now is a reality. We know monsters is right around the corner

[37:37] You know we've got Alice Cooper's nightmare castle. We've got total nuclear annihilation

[37:40] We've got iron maiden. You know, there's just so much. There's so much and you know to the victors

[37:48] We'll go the spoils and and and again

[37:50] I think that that this is gonna be another year

[37:54] That's not gonna be easy for anyone who's trying to compete with the big companies

[38:00] That have the big themes and can release those games quickly

[38:05] I you know are people gonna wait 18 months to get

[38:09] In Alice Cooper

[38:10] Can they can they might have to speed up production you might have to get games out in 12 months

[38:15] And then get on to the next it's it's it's it's stern won't stop Chicago gaming will not stop

[38:21] Jersey jack won't stop

[38:24] The the stakes are are really high there's gonna be as I've always said winners and losers

[38:29] winners and losers and you know all we can hope for is that you know

[38:34] We get the best games from each manufacturer and they put their best foot forward and

[38:38] And I think Charlie is probably realizing

[38:43] After they stole they didn't steal the license they went and got it like right they didn't steal it from them

[38:47] I think he's realizing that this welcome to the world of pinball business

[38:52] And this is just how it is in every single industry

[38:56] And it actually does one thing and here's why I think it's good and I and Chuck

[38:59] I hope you know like I'm saying this because you know

[39:03] I want you to like do good in the pinball industry

[39:07] I think this is gonna make Chuck and bug and the spooky people

[39:11] I think it's gonna piss them the fuck off and I think anger

[39:16] And being disappointed and mad at your competitors makes you want to make a better product

[39:22] And I see it all over the industry

[39:25] Do you think like Dodge was happy that like Ford and Chevy were shitting all over them?

[39:30] No, they were pissed off

[39:32] And they went and then they went and made the hell cats and the demons

[39:36] And they they took back

[39:38] The crown of the baddest muscle cars on the road and same thing with spooky like this

[39:43] I hope this lights a fire

[39:45] That sends a signal that we need to stop pretending that we're all holding

[39:50] In hands in this industry and we're gonna like

[39:53] You know, we're gonna go to war and make the best pinball machines possible

[39:58] Okay, it's just the way it is doesn't mean you have to be throwing punches and drinks and people's faces like canada

[40:03] It just means you need to realize you should never offer to help your competitor make a product

[40:09] Regardless if they took the theme from you and you should focus on making the games that you can make the best possible games

[40:14] All right, I'm gonna get off my soapbox

[40:16] I'm gonna work out guys. I haven't mentioned this workout

[40:20] You should be doing more exercise and eating healthy than playing pinball machine

[40:24] I want to come to tpf and I want to see all of you guys

[40:29] Freakin jacked and shredded. I heard Nate, you know, we heard that Nate actually broke up with Teresa

[40:34] Which we were sad to hear

[40:36] I heard he's getting jacked because that's what happens when we get our life back. We want to get our life in order

[40:42] Um, I was sad to hear that but I'm glad to hear he's like working out and he's like, you know

[40:47] He's pumpin iron

[40:49] Life is short. You got to take care of yourself pinball machines will never make you healthy. I promise to do that

[40:55] Have a great day everybody

[40:58] Is a ship

[41:09] You know I crashed that piece of shit
