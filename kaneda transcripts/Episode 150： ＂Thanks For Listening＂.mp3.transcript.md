[00:00] Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers, the most important of you

[00:03] The customer, the rock boys, and the building tonight

[00:06] Oh, what a villain, how villain life

[00:09] You only got to bring your paper out

[00:11] Even though boys are the year, drinks is on the house

[00:20] We've made it to 150 episodes of Canada's Pimball Podcast

[00:27] I think when this podcast started, a lot of people labeled me as a pin-side troll

[00:32] who would just go away, who wouldn't add any value to the pinball community

[00:38] and I think we've done anything but that

[00:42] which is just be an idiot, be a troll, add no value

[00:47] and I say we because it's me and you

[00:49] It's myself with the headset, it's the listeners out there

[00:54] that make this show possible and it's all the great individuals that I've interviewed

[00:59] over the years that have really contributed it to Canada's Pimball Podcast

[01:04] and just some quick numbers since we've started this show

[01:09] This is episode 150, now give or take we've done a little bit more than that

[01:14] We've deleted some drunken rant episodes over the years

[01:18] But as of this morning there have been 171,639 people who have played and listened to Canada's Pimball Podcast

[01:32] Well that's the total plays of the podcast

[01:34] Now only like 170,000 of those are coming from my mother

[01:39] So there's like a thousand guys out there that have listened to this podcast

[01:42] But no, on average we get about a thousand listens per show

[01:47] and I think that's a great number

[01:49] I'm glad that I have so many of you out there who tune into this show every week to hear what I have to say about Pimball

[01:55] And let's get right to it because I think this show has established itself

[01:59] as the go-to podcast where you're not going to hear me talk about tournaments

[02:04] what I did over the weekend, what I'm having for breakfast

[02:07] and we're not going to go and start talking about old machines

[02:11] and how I feel about this machine and that machine from 20 years ago

[02:16] On this episode let's get right to the news

[02:18] I wanted to create a shorter snackable podcast for you guys because they've been going over an hour

[02:22] Which is my rule of thumb as I never want a podcast to be as long as a movie

[02:28] And they shouldn't they should never be close to two hours

[02:30] All right, so let's talk about before I get into Star Wars again and this and that

[02:36] Because we have to keep talking about it because it's a topic that keeps popping up every single day for people

[02:41] Let's talk about Alien

[02:43] The news right now is that Alien Ellie

[02:47] They're removing the fiber optic ramp lighting that was supposed to be part of the Alien Ellie package

[02:55] And that was a $600 value that was going into the Ellie game

[03:00] Now what happens if you were in on an Alien Ellie and you paid in full

[03:07] For your product that was supposed to have that fiber optic

[03:11] Lighting it's been removed

[03:14] So the big question now becomes are they going to give Alien Ellie buyers anything in place of that

[03:23] $600 item

[03:25] Will they give you the the pdi glass that's supposed to be an option with the game

[03:30] Will they give you the

[03:32] 26 27 inch LCD screen

[03:36] for free

[03:37] Or will it just go away?

[03:39] Will they just say we're not putting this in the game?

[03:42] It was one of Andrew's last-minute efforts

[03:46] It doesn't really go with Alien and we've said that on this show

[03:49] I don't understand why it's in the game to begin with

[03:52] But it was a feature that was promised now

[03:55] I've said from the very

[03:57] Beginning of looking at the Ellie versus the SC with Alien is that Andrew really just

[04:03] tried to use the Ellie

[04:06] As a way to get a little bit more money and get some revenue into the company

[04:10] But Alien standard edition really looks awesome

[04:14] There's not much more you need to put in that game to make that game pop

[04:20] And I've always said that they should just make one version of Alien

[04:24] I think the Ellie if they're going to make an Ellie should be

[04:29] One Ellie which by that I mean one trim collar

[04:33] I think this whole like option out your game the way you want it

[04:36] Is still going to be a logistical nightmare for these guys and I'm kind of happy to see them

[04:41] Removing some of the stupid stuff that was put into the game

[04:44] But I also think they need to give consumers something for that you just can't take out an item now

[04:50] The

[04:52] overarching argument is can anyone really complain because

[04:58] They were going to get nothing no game no alien no pinball machine nothing if these investors didn't come in

[05:06] There would be no alien pinball shipping there would be no highway pinball

[05:10] And so you kind of have to juggle

[05:13] Well, they're taking this out but at least I'm getting a pinball machine. I should just be happy

[05:18] I'm going to get aliens. I think that's how a lot of people are thinking about this but

[05:24] I would still just get the standard edition alien because you can add

[05:28] You can add all the stuff that really makes in Ellie in Ellie and we all know that the Ellie artwork

[05:35] Will not really be very visible if you put that big LCD screen there

[05:40] And also for you alien fans out there

[05:43] There is a new video that is up that shows two hours of gameplay footage of the latest code and the latest version of the game

[05:52] So go check that out

[05:54] I'm not going to talk about two hours of a of a YouTube video of someone playing pinball

[06:00] game looks

[06:01] Bright colorful it looks really I think they might have changed the brightness on the video itself to make it more bright than the other videos of alien

[06:09] I've seen but the code is coming along the music's great and it's up to you now

[06:14] It's up to you

[06:15] I would still wait to see if these guys can get their act together remember they said they're going to be shipping aliens on

[06:20] August 14th, which is this coming Monday this coming Monday

[06:24] We expect to see aliens shipping out the door all right. So what else is going on in the pinball world

[06:30] Home pin if you guys have been following home pin

[06:34] Really really some development starting to surface with the home pin thunderbirds game

[06:41] Mike over there in China is starting to reveal more and more of what's going to be in the game

[06:46] We got to see two things this week. We got to see the back glass artwork which is hand-drawn

[06:53] And we got to see the front of the coin box area where

[06:58] Right now he's shared an image that has a single

[07:02] Single coin slot with a dollar bill acceptor

[07:06] Or a bill acceptor to the left of it and that's what we have so far

[07:11] So there's been you know some feedback back and forth the artwork

[07:14] You know, it doesn't look bad. I I'm not a fan of thunderbirds. So again me

[07:20] Reviewing thunderbirds. I have absolutely zero context for that theme

[07:26] I have said before as in an inaugural theme

[07:30] I think thunderbirds is really bad because

[07:34] It's not going to appeal to the main markets of pinball being the United States number one and then Europe number two

[07:43] Why would you build a machine where the theme itself doesn't appeal to the two?

[07:49] Biggest buyers of pinball. Okay, so that to me again. Why start your company off

[07:57] With already two strikes against it. So and also the way Mike is revealing the game

[08:04] We've talked about this before

[08:06] I just don't think you should reveal a game like this piece by piece by piece. I look Mike's behind schedule

[08:12] We know this

[08:14] I would love Mike to come on the show and talk to us

[08:18] About what's going on? I you know, I see Mike all day long active on the Aussie arcade forums

[08:24] Mike is active on pinside

[08:26] No one's really heard from Mike

[08:28] I know there's some seminars coming up at some shows

[08:31] But I really do think this podcast is a great platform for Mike to come on the show and talk explain what's going on

[08:39] this is the best medium for

[08:43] For pinball manufacturers and designers to talk about their vision. I think so much of what they

[08:49] Had planned or or wanted to put into a game and all the story the story of their machine is told best

[08:57] Like this on a format like this so Mike if you're listening and I know other people who know you are or you might be

[09:04] Come on the show tell us about home pin tell us about Thunderbirds

[09:07] In terms of when we're going to see the game I believe

[09:12] October I believe we're going to see some sort of game in October now

[09:17] Here's a couple of things I heard I heard he doesn't want to pay for air freight

[09:22] So he's putting the machine on a boat to get to where it needs to go and so he has to put the game on the boat soon

[09:30] So there's that part of it

[09:31] I also heard from someone in the industry that I know that they saw the whitewood of the game

[09:37] They saw the whitewood of home pins thunderbird and I just asked like what is it like like is it is it

[09:44] Got a ton of stuff under the play field is it got this is it got that

[09:48] And the game they compared it to was dominoes

[09:52] so

[09:53] I'm

[09:55] But again whitewood I don't know like is it going to be that Baron is it going to have a lot more in it

[10:02] The price point he's looking to hit will be very competitive it will be very competitive

[10:07] I think it's going to be around us during pro or less

[10:11] We know the screen is going to be dots, you know, I think regular maybe red dots or color dots

[10:17] But it's not going to have an hd LCD screen back there. So there's a lot of

[10:23] Question marks about this pinball machine now in the last episode we talked about the number of games coming out

[10:29] The number of games that are currently available in box somewhere around 20 and more are coming

[10:36] I don't think this game can come out in a more competitive environment remember might have this idea to create this company to go after

[10:45] Stern and make every single part in the game

[10:49] Years ago and look at how much the market has shifted in just those few years

[10:55] And I think that's going to be the challenge is there's just not enough money in room for all of these games to survive

[11:02] But until I see more on thunderbirds I can't say more

[11:06] I want Mike to come on and talk about the game itself. All right

[11:10] What else is going on we we we uh we I think we rightfully criticize

[11:15] The big Lebowski and Dutch pinball last podcast

[11:19] I just don't think they can go on vacation

[11:21] I want to say something because I was reading pinside

[11:23] And one of my friends is in on a big Lebowski that is mr. Bill Brandis

[11:28] For those of you who know Bill you know he's an amazing dude

[11:31] You know he's very successful in business. He's a very smart man

[11:35] And whenever he chimes in about the business decisions of these pinball manufacturers

[11:40] I think people should pay attention and I saw someone being like oh you're just in it for profit like

[11:47] Like ha ha you're not you don't have your game. I have a Lebowski this and that you're just gonna sell it

[11:52] And I just want to tell the people who criticize Bill and say stupid stuff like that

[11:56] That you guys are idiots if you think Bill is not passionate about pinball

[12:02] If you think Bill doesn't want his big Lebowski Bill wants the game he paid for he wants to put it in his collection

[12:11] He wants to play it

[12:13] If you think Bill Brandis needs to make profit on pinball machines your dead wrong

[12:20] Because mr. Bill Brandis makes profit in other areas of his life and pinball is not his main focus

[12:28] So I just think some of you are really really

[12:32] Blind to some of the individuals that you're criticizing and nobody should criticize a man who gave Dutch pinball

[12:41] His $8500 his $9,000 and has received jack shit from them

[12:48] And then has to read how they're going on vacation for two weeks

[12:52] How they're building this new game on the backs of Bill's money where's Bill's money

[12:58] Who how are they are gonna pay to the build Bill's game Bill's money is evaporated and now that money is being used

[13:07] Well, who's paying for their vacation?

[13:09] Where are they getting that money from what other income do these guys have when people want refunds and they're going on vacation

[13:17] Mark my words

[13:19] Dutch pinball will not make it this company has built up so much ill will has made so many missteps and communicates

[13:30] It is such a tone deaf manner that with all the other manufacturers out there all the other products that are available

[13:38] These guys are headed for obsolescence, okay, and I just I get mad because

[13:45] They're doing stupid things and then the damn buyers who deserve respect keep getting shit on

[13:52] By the smug nature of Dutch pinball and if you can't see it the way these guys make videos and they don't seem to be really that

[14:02] Heartbroken over what's going on

[14:04] Because you don't take vacations and you don't tell people you're gonna take vacations all right. Let's move on

[14:09] Let's move on from Dutch I'm getting riled up here in the morning. Bubba's looking at me like what are you doing?

[14:13] What are you doing?

[14:15] All right, so

[14:17] Let's go to everybody's favorite topic recently and this this this topic it won't go away

[14:25] It won't go away because it's 40 years in the making and star wars pinball and there's so I've never seen so much

[14:33] Debate I've never seen so many pages

[14:38] Talking about a game that so few people have played so far

[14:44] So many pages about a game that isn't complete

[14:49] So many pages about a game that's not even shipping their premium or their elis

[14:54] But it's star wars so it's not surprising. It's not surprising look

[14:57] You could go in the pinside and look at p3 multi-morphic is shipping and I think they're like maybe

[15:04] Two pages. I think they're on just one page of that news that they're shipping

[15:11] Where star wars has like I think 170 pages or something crazy like that so

[15:16] Here's what I think we all need to do here's what we all need to do

[15:19] We need to realize that this is just the star wars game. We're gonna get

[15:23] People are excited for it and people are

[15:27] hugely disappointed by it at the same time and when you have an environment like that

[15:32] Where there's excitement and disappointment

[15:34] colliding it becomes

[15:37] perfect fodder

[15:39] For talk shows like this for pinball forms for people to battle it out because it really becomes this

[15:45] subjective battle ground where you're an idiot if you're gonna go in on the Ellie and what are you talking about like

[15:51] I'm super excited stop raining on my parade right we've seen

[15:55] That battle take place and I've been in the middle of the battle because I am hugely disappointed with star wars

[16:02] I don't I do not think that you can look at that game and say man

[16:07] It really looks like stern put everything they could into the game

[16:10] It's more about it looks like they took so much out of the game to get the game to market

[16:16] And then you know we we have gone back and forth on there is no value in the Ellie you can't justify it

[16:22] And I've I've heard from many many people many people

[16:26] Uh

[16:27] That they are canceling their Ellie orders

[16:30] And maybe going with the pro or the premium and I think that's the smart way to go

[16:35] I read on pins that I think some people out there who are in on Ellie's I saw someone say you know

[16:40] They're gonna sell out of the Ellie's I'm not so sure

[16:44] That star wars Ellie is going to sell out

[16:47] Quickly all right. I don't even think it's ever gonna fully

[16:52] Sell out. Oh, I mean it's hard to tell right

[16:55] I think distributors are gonna have them in box for a while

[16:59] I do think if they don't sell these Ellie's before expo in October

[17:05] I do not think people are gonna rush to go get them because with 800 of them

[17:10] There is gonna be plenty of them that come up for sale for less money

[17:15] Then uh, they were new in box the this game is not gonna go up in value

[17:20] And if you look at the other juggernaut themes that stern released recently

[17:25] Ghostbusters and Batman both sold for more than their MSRP

[17:32] Even before the games shipped. How do I know this because I flipped both of those games

[17:38] For more money than I paid for them and

[17:43] Star Wars is a title which is more popular than Ghostbusters and Batman 66 which has just sat

[17:50] It has sat on eBay for prices around 85 89 hundred no one's no one's running to buy if you want a star wars

[17:59] Ellie a this week this week in august you can call around to distributors and you can get one because people are bailin on it

[18:08] Um, I also want to just talk about

[18:11] The tone of some of the people out there who think that it's a crime

[18:16] To air your disappointment about Star Wars and I'm looking at the guys again

[18:21] I'm gonna call some of these dudes out like Beasel Boo

[18:24] Who who wants to sort of compare

[18:27] Star Wars is fun and ironman and and Tron were fun and

[18:32] How much was iron man and iron man was made when stern was out of money right ironman was a pin

[18:40] That yeah, there's hardly anything in it

[18:44] But at least it still has the awesome bash toy that pops up from underneath the playfield even just that

[18:52] Has more interactivity and more creativity than any of the stuff you hit in Star Wars and Tron forget it

[19:00] Tron is is a great game

[19:02] It's it's it's not the best art package

[19:05] But Tron is Tron

[19:07] And the integration of the theme Tron comes to life beautifully in that game with with the light at ramps

[19:15] The recognizer the spinning disc the the bank of targets that drop to enter the spinning disc

[19:22] See Tron when you stand over it and I was just at sunshine with my friend who doesn't play pinball very often

[19:28] He was sort of like wow when we stood over Tron just because it looked like Tron

[19:34] And I think when you stand over Star Wars you just don't get it you just don't get that and so

[19:40] I'm happy to see people are starting to get smart here

[19:44] They're starting to realize there's only one way stern is going to change and that is if people speak up

[19:52] That is if people don't rush to buy every single Ellie the day release and and and and people

[20:02] Spend their money elsewhere or they wait they wait to see what stern has next. I've been saying this on the Aussie forms

[20:10] All right, and this is from some reliable sources. I have constantly been told to wait to see what's next from stern

[20:19] This is coming from people who have seen what's next from stern and they have said to me

[20:25] I'm not getting Star Wars because I've seen what's down the road and it blows

[20:31] Star Wars way

[20:32] Star Wars is a pinball machine that is full of compromises

[20:38] It's full of compromises whether it's Disney restrictions whether it's George Gomez letting it slip that Gary stern

[20:47] Hates to spend money or is allergic to spending money whatever he said the quote was and he quickly backtracked

[20:52] But at the end of the day

[20:54] Star Wars is a machine that they tried

[20:59] To make as much profit on by taking stuff out people have seen the original white woods that Steve had designed and there were

[21:08] There were

[21:09] Magnets in it that aren't there anymore. There was something

[21:13] Where that LCD screen is with those targets on the right side. There was something else there

[21:18] They clearly yanked stuff out now you could say

[21:24] Whatever just accepted it is what it is and true that is the case but

[21:29] But what what good will come if we just accept this as a Star Wars pin as the best it can be

[21:37] Um, will it still be fun? Will people buy it and enjoy it? Yes every pinball machine on some level is fun

[21:45] I was playing indie 500. I've never really played that game and I looked down at it

[21:50] I'm like well there's a lot of cool stuff in here. It's fun to flip and for the price

[21:55] It's probably a good time with pinball and that is why stern pinball

[22:02] Again, I'll keep saying this there they make the best

[22:05] $6,000 machines and they make the worst

[22:08] $9,000 machines and I'm sorry, but I don't agree with people that say our

[22:14] Expectations are the problem

[22:17] We expect it in

[22:19] Amazing machine in Star Wars and stern how to know what people's expectations would be and on some level

[22:28] This does not look like they gave us their all they gave us their all

[22:34] It doesn't the one machine the one machine in the last

[22:40] Oh, I want to say like five years the one machine that really look like they gave us

[22:45] The best they could that they were turning the corner was ghost busters

[22:49] Ghost busters in barris's

[22:52] Star Wars ghost busters pro in barris's star wars pro

[22:56] Ghost busters is that game and I'm telling you right now don't give up on stern though. I

[23:02] I've given up on stern star wars. I have I would never buy that game

[23:05] I would never ever ever ever buy that game

[23:08] But don't give up on stern because I'll tell you this Keith Llan

[23:12] John Borg

[23:13] Zambietti dirty Donnie they're not done. They're not done

[23:18] They're gonna make amazing games. They're gonna put incredible art packages into games

[23:23] They're gonna have amazing toys and mechanisms coming. I've heard it from people who have seen it

[23:27] It's coming you know who needs to take a break and rethink things is Steve Richie

[23:33] Steve Richie's designs leave a lot to be inspired. He is not the best designer stern has and

[23:40] And stern needs to stop handing Steve Richie their top tier titles

[23:45] How many times is he gonna drop the ball in terms of integrating those themes into pinball machines

[23:52] We've got enough Steve risk Steve Richie fast machines. We don't need another one

[23:56] What we need is the best god damn star wars pinball machine to be out while we're alive and now we have to wait

[24:03] Now we have to wait how many years before it's revisited probably ten

[24:09] It sucks by the time it comes out there won't be

[24:14] All these manufacturers pinball is not gonna last 20 years from now in terms of manufacturing new machines

[24:19] This might be the last damn star wars machine we ever get and it sucks that we have to accept what was put in front of us

[24:27] All right, let's talk about some listener feedback to the show

[24:32] Uh, I if you want to email me it's canada pinball at gmail.com

[24:36] I got an email from Stephen callister. Stephen. Thank you for listening to the show

[24:41] Stephen wrote what do you think about the hyperdrive and star wars premium?

[24:45] Do you think it justifies the higher price based on what we saw in the twitch stream from dead flip?

[24:50] Um, yeah, it's a good question because a lot of people are looking at the proverse of the premium and saying the two main differences are

[24:57] The death star and the hyperdrive. Uh, I'll say this. I thought the hyperdrive was cool

[25:03] I do think if I was gonna get star wars. I would want it

[25:07] I think the balls whizzing around it's something really cool to show people and it's something really cool to watch

[25:15] Will it get boring over time maybe?

[25:19] But I also think the death star opening up and splitting and the light going off as crappy as it looks

[25:26] It's still more fun than just seeing the death star sitting there

[25:30] So I think star wars is in dire need of things that show off something cool happening with the ball

[25:39] Because remember if you remove those two things the ball doesn't interact with anything

[25:44] It's just hitting lights and targets and and stand up tar you know

[25:49] There's a couple drop targets on the left side and some stand up targets and a tie fighter on a spring

[25:54] But there's really nothing to go wow look at the what the ball just did

[25:59] And and I think every pinball machine needs a few of those shots

[26:02] And so that's why if I were getting a star wars I would get a star wars

[26:08] Premium I think it's the way to go and I think the price is not terrible because it's in line with where the other star wars premiums are at

[26:16] All right, I got an email from a gentleman in Australia who wishes to remain

[26:22] Anonymous but I'll give his initials js you know who you are js

[26:27] I agree with a lot of what you say and can't believe stern in relation to their latest game star wars

[26:32] Steve richi seems to be getting lazy

[26:35] But unfortunately seems to be a common thing and amaze at a game like star wars pro and then ghost brushes pro cost the same

[26:42] I think we are due for new blood and design and art on the game

[26:46] I also can't believe that stern sneaking a comment in their manual will cover them for ghosting

[26:52] Keep up the great work. Don't mention my name. Okay

[26:56] All right, well here's the thing here's the thing js in australia

[27:00] Um, it look it's new blood is coming new blood is coming but I also agree that

[27:06] Stern needs to hire more new blood not just on the design level but also on the code level

[27:13] I do think the coders are

[27:16] are

[27:17] Out of ideas too, you know

[27:19] You could look at Dwight's code on star wars and say he's just porting over

[27:24] What he did on game of thrones and adjusting it for star wars, but I don't I think the coder and the designer need to come together

[27:32] In in a symphony and in a harmonious way to bring the theme to life and I think we need new coders as well

[27:41] I saw Nate shivers podcasts

[27:43] He said if if if he was stern he would hire scott denisi tomorrow and

[27:48] And scott is a he's got total nuclear annihilation. He's got a fun new game coming out that there's a lot of hype around

[27:56] When I heard Nate say that though, I was like man

[27:58] Stern might be the last place. I want scott to end up because I don't want scott to have to compromise

[28:05] His vision because of stern's desire to like cut cost

[28:09] I think spooky was the right place to go in terms of letting scott do what scott wanted to do

[28:16] I don't think he would have got the same

[28:19] Reception at stern and I also like if you I think great creativity great ideas

[28:26] They don't happen when there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen

[28:30] I think the problem at stern is that there's it's committee

[28:34] It's got to be decision by committee if Keith L one has an ideal let's make this mechanism

[28:41] You can't tell me that the accountants that Gary that the investors don't huddle and say well, how much is that gonna cost?

[28:48] And then they realize well, we're paying this much for the theme do we really need it to sell it if not yank it out

[28:54] I really feel like Star Wars is probably the ultimate the ultimate game designed by committee

[29:00] Designed by fear of what you know the Disney license that designed in a way that

[29:06] You know just wasn't like one dreamers idea

[29:11] One you know and when I look at games where the designers allowed to do whatever he wants to do in the game

[29:16] I think a game is that game is called dialed in all right look at dialed in and tell me that it looks like

[29:23] Jack told Pat that he had to take stuff out

[29:26] No, it's the other way around they just put everything in and they give you great value

[29:31] And I think that's what people want to see from stern and I I don't think stern is the place for these young creatives to go

[29:38] Until stern proves they'll let these young creatives flourish

[29:43] Under their watch, okay? All right. What else is going on who else did I get emails from so I got an email from David

[29:50] Slaymaker David

[29:52] Thank you for listening to can eat his pinball podcast David wrote what's up man David slaymaker here?

[29:58] Hey maker on pinside I greatly

[30:01] Slowed down my pinball stuff in the summer

[30:04] But I've been listening to the podcast and checking in on pinside here and there anyway

[30:09] I'm just here to see this oric alien Ellie artwork. You were talking about is this a joke or serious

[30:16] Can't wait to find out anyway. Keep up the good work. Well, David

[30:20] Thank you so much for listening to the podcast. I appreciate having you as a listener of the show

[30:26] And guess what David got he got

[30:29] The alien Ellie artwork side-by-side image everybody got it who emailed me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[30:36] It was real there is artwork that oric submitted that was of the alien Ellie back glass

[30:44] And I have put it next to Brian Allen's and you guys decide I mean it looks not terrible

[30:50] It's not hand drawn the way Brian Allen's is um, but I I delivered on my promise and I've let people see

[30:58] What those two look like side-by-side

[31:02] All right, I want to say thank you to Andre who is

[31:06] Arcus ARKUZ on pinside

[31:11] Andre thank you for listening to the kindi's pinball podcast he wrote

[31:14] Okay, I'll bite let's have a look

[31:16] I have nothing against oric and I consider his alien playfield art to be perfectly competent and appropriate for a more

[31:23] technical look instead of

[31:25] the

[31:26] Mechano organic approach maybe not the thing most fans wanted though

[31:30] I'm in complete agreement about your views about pinball art and I have my very specific and serious taste

[31:36] But definitely consider zombie yeti's work on magic girl the pinnacle of modern

[31:41] Theming I own ghostbusters Ellie because of his art the real back glass and the world under glass

[31:47] That seems to be the last of its kind from stern

[31:50] Your conversation with black knight was also fun

[31:53] Keep up the good reporting nice to have a weekly or better podcast that keeps up with the real news in the industry

[32:00] Well Andre thank you so much. I mean the black knight is awesome. I mean I I could talk to him

[32:06] Every week about something going on in pinball about the history of all these amazing games

[32:11] You guys love and he's been in it for decades and he's off pinside, you know, I mean it's it's it's incredible

[32:17] The more people like him

[32:19] Leavesights like pinside the less

[32:23] You're gonna learn the less you're gonna learn the less informed you'll be when you make your next decision

[32:29] And also less fun the hobby is because the stories of these games the stories of the history of pinball the stories of

[32:36] Of all the manufacturers to get to where we are today

[32:40] I think those are important stories to tell now. We're not gonna always tell

[32:44] Those stories on this podcast because we try to look at the current market of pinball

[32:50] Where things are headed and the news it's happening

[32:53] But there's also so much that you should know

[32:57] About pinball's past if you want to

[33:00] predict what's gonna happen in the future

[33:02] And also just know if you're getting good value because I think bang for the buck is really on everyone's mind lately when it comes to the world of pinball

[33:11] All right, that's episode 150 of canada's pinball podcast

[33:16] Here's some shows we have coming up. We're talking to a gentleman

[33:20] Neil McCray on Friday. Neil's all the way over in the UK. So we're gonna be interviewing him

[33:26] Scott Denise is supposed to come on the show. I'm trying to track scott down to talk about total nuclear annihilation

[33:33] I also did an interview with straight down the middle

[33:37] They have a great show on YouTube about pinball and

[33:42] For some reason the video didn't didn't capture quite right so they aired the audio on YouTube

[33:47] But but since it's the audio it's it's also perfect for a podcast. So I'm gonna actually air

[33:53] That interview that they did with me on this show so you can listen to it

[33:57] So it's it's actually gonna be kind of funny. You're gonna hear them interviewing me

[34:01] But I'll air it on my show

[34:03] We're just changing the roles of how how I do interviews

[34:08] But I think you'll really enjoy because there's a really good talk

[34:10] We the whole show is about reviewing Star Wars Pro

[34:12] So I think you'll enjoy it

[34:14] And that's it episode 150 look look for more fun episodes in the future
