[00:00] Just like a child again, heaven can wait And all I've done is time until you leave the town

[00:15] I'll hold the back, I won't look back, but the Lord shall shine

[00:27] Set us set us set us set us set us set us set us set us set us set us

[00:32] He was the greatest pinball coder of all time, one of the greatest pinball players of all time, one of the greatest people of all time.

[00:45] Mr. Lyman Sheets, Jr. at just the age of 55, passed away yesterday.

[00:51] And all of us out there in this community, when we heard the news, it was so sad, so devastating, probably the biggest loss in all of pinball that I've ever felt being a part of this hobby.

[01:04] And I wanted to do a quick podcast explaining why all of us out there and me personally have such an appreciation for Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[01:14] And what he contributed to the pinball community, what he left behind with his legacy of games, which are arguably the best coded games ever.

[01:24] And I want to talk about this man's impact, I want to talk about the genius that was Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[01:30] And then I want to leave us with a song and a little bit of a moment of silence before that song, as we all reflect upon this man and his incredible contributions to pinball because without him,

[01:42] pinball would not be what it is today. Without him, many of us probably wouldn't be where we are because we never would have fallen in love with pinball the way we have if it were not for Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[01:57] And what was so sad about yesterday's news is he was only 55 years old.

[02:02] I mean, that is way too young to be taken from all of us, from his family, from his loved ones, from his passion, from his future.

[02:11] And as all of us get older and all of us stare down the ultimate finality of life, we can't help but reflect on our own lives and our own journeys and how short and how precious life really is and every day is a blessing.

[02:25] And every day we're above ground is a blessing. And we really need to appreciate every single minute we have with each other, with these toys we love, but with the connections we've made with each other.

[02:38] And I don't think any man out there in the pinball world has made more people excited and connected more people than Lyman Sheets.

[02:47] I cover this industry on a weekly basis and I tell you what I love and what I don't love about pinball.

[02:54] And I don't think I've ever seen anything touched by Lyman Sheets that I didn't absolutely love.

[03:01] And that is the true genius of Lyman is we always had that phrase in Lyman we trust. And when you really break down what that means, it means that he had the mightest touch.

[03:12] Anything he touched in the pinball world got better. He never made anything worse. He never made anyone nervous. Whenever we knew that Lyman Sheets was going to work on a game, we knew that game was going to be great.

[03:27] And there is no other pinball coder out there. There is no other figure out there that we can say the same.

[03:35] And what Lyman put into these games and games like Metallica, ACDC, Spider-Man, Tron, Elvira, Batman 66, Medieval Madness, Revenge from Mars, Monster Bash, I mean the list goes on and on and on in terms of his accolades.

[03:57] And what he put into these games, it wasn't just sounds and lights and modes. He put soul into all of these games.

[04:08] And I've said it from the very beginning. These machines are an extension of the coder's personality.

[04:15] In a lot of ways Lyman Sheets gave us a little bit of him with every game he coded. But the genius of Lyman, in a world that's getting very complex, in a world that's very hard to understand.

[04:28] I mean look at modern pinball machines. You stand over them and you have no idea what to do. And a lot of these new games, they're so overly complex.

[04:38] There's all these complex rule sets of stacking this and stacking that. It's like trying to figure out calculus to play a pinball machine. But what Lyman was always able to do.

[04:50] He was always able to make his games appealing to both the casual player who could walk up and play his games and have some stuff happen that was very rewarding.

[05:01] But he also knew how to make his games deep for the tournament players, for the better skill set players. And he knew how to make the game appealing to both the casual and the expert player.

[05:12] And it requires such genius talent to do that. I've always compared Lyman Sheets to sort of the conductor of an orchestra.

[05:20] That he's up there waving his hands and he's making the entire game come alive. He's bringing all of the different elements of a pinball machine to life.

[05:30] Remember because without code, a pinball machine is just a static item. Nothing is happening. The coder has to tell that like to go off or that call out to happen or that clip to appear on the screen or that mechanism defy or all that has to be coded.

[05:47] And it was all inside his head and he put it into each of his games in such a masterful way.

[05:54] And the other part about Lyman Sheets that I absolutely love. One of the greatest lessons he's leaving behind in the pinball world and for all of us in life is a very simple lesson.

[06:06] Is that when you want to make something great and you want to aim for perfection and you want to do something that will be remembered 10 years from now, 20 years from now.

[06:17] When you want to put your heart and soul into a project, it takes time. And in a world in which we're rushing to get games out, in a world in which we just want to get the next game on the line, Lyman Sheets knew that it would take time to make the games the right way.

[06:35] And it was kind of like that interesting battle between him and Stern all of those years where Stern just wanted to rush games out, but Lyman needed more than a year to make a game great.

[06:46] And we all love the fact that years down the road, right? Lyman wasn't just like the conductor of an orchestra. He was like the architect of a cathedral.

[06:55] And if you know the story of cathedrals out there in the world, they're never complete. They're always trying to get taller and taller as they reach towards the heavens.

[07:04] And that was like Lyman Sheets on code. He would always revisit it and make it just a little bit better. Add a little bit more polish.

[07:12] He kept aiming to get that code to its heavenly state. And years could go by, right? He could revisit games years later and awaken them in new ways.

[07:21] And I saw him do it with games like Metallica and the Walking Dead. And I don't think I've ever heard anybody ever say a single bad word about Lyman Sheets, Jr.

[07:33] And in a world in which everyone is hyper critical, myself included in a world in which we try to find fault in everything because it makes it more entertaining.

[07:43] It makes for clickbait. It makes it more exciting to listen to someone say that's horrible versus that's great. Lyman Sheets, he unanimously and universally never had any complaints about what he put into games.

[07:56] Now we might have complained that we had a wait. And that was always something fun to see how long would it take for Lyman Sheets to finish a code.

[08:03] But man, when he finished a code, man, when he put everything into a game, when you look at a game like Batman 66 and what he did with all of those clips,

[08:12] you want to know why we don't like the monsters and we'll never love the monsters. It's because we played Batman 66 and he showed us what's possible in a pinball machine.

[08:24] And when you see what's possible and you experience a Lyman Sheets game, it's hard to go back and accept something else.

[08:32] You know, there are people out there who only collect Lyman Sheets games and I've always said it, if you're going to collect pinball machines, I would collect Lyman Sheets games.

[08:42] And I fully expect people to realize that real soon that if you're going to spend a lot of money on stuff, don't just chase the latest, chase the greatest.

[08:51] And he was the greatest pinball coder ever. It is a horrible loss for the community. It's a horrible loss for pinball, for his family, for his friends, for everyone out there.

[09:02] 55 years old, I mean he's only 10 years older than me and it hits all of us in different ways. And I hope this weekend everybody raises a glass to Lyman that we get into his unique stance, right, leaning over the machine and just play pinball and enjoy what he left us.

[09:20] And what a legacy he has left behind he will live on forever in these games. There will never be another coder like him.

[09:27] We will always wish that he coded everything. It's the truth. Deep down inside, if we had to pick the most valuable person in all of pinball, I can't think of someone more valuable than Lyman Sheets Jr.

[09:39] I used this analogy yesterday on my Facebook live that if you were choosing like your dodgeball teams, imagine if you wanted to make the greatest pinball machine of all time.

[09:49] And you had everyone lined up in the pinball industry, the best coders, the best designers, the best artist. And you had to make your first pick.

[09:58] Your first pick out of the greatest talent in all of pinball. How do you not pick Lyman Sheets Jr. first? There are many great designers out there. There are many great artists out there. But there's only one Lyman. And nobody can make a game the way Lyman Sheets Jr. did.

[10:16] For me personally, I'll never forget having dinner with Lyman and Penny and Brenda and this amazing talented man. If you were me, I'd be bragging how good I am at pinball coding. He was so humble.

[10:29] You wouldn't even have known you're in the presence of someone who has created the greatest pinball machines. You wouldn't even know it. He would absolutely give off no indication of the amazing talent inside his head.

[10:42] And that's the most amazing part about Lyman is he's just so likable. And everyone who came in contact with him felt that way. And we need more of that in the world today. We absolutely need more of that.

[10:53] And the reason why I say that so many of us probably wouldn't be in love with this hobby if it were not for Lyman Sheets Jr. is he made games fun. He made people happy.

[11:06] I don't think I've seen a single pinball personality that is added more happiness to this hobby than Lyman. Right? I mean, who's owned his games out there? How happy are you with his titles with his games? And the ultimate skill set that he had, he could take a game that didn't even shoot well.

[11:24] Walking dead. Batman 66 anyone. And he could make it amazing. And I love it today because as we look at games today, right?

[11:32] I'm thinking about these new spooky games and everyone's like the code is going to make it better. The game's going to come alive. No, it's not because the whole reason why we look at games now and say, well, when the code's done, it's going to be awesome.

[11:44] No, that only happens when Lyman is on it. And I think he spoiled so many of us by doing that. Like we've sort of ingrained in our heads that eventually a year from now, every bad game will get good because of code. That's never going to happen anymore because the guy who did that was Lyman Sheets Jr.

[12:03] And he is the reason why we think code can save everything, but no, it can't. The only one that could save everything was Lyman. And he did it and he did it time and time again.

[12:12] But he also had so many amazing games. And that is why we're going to miss him so much because I wanted 20 more years of Lyman Sheets games. I wanted to see what he was going to do with cactus Canyon. I know PPS had big plans for Lyman to revisit all of the old classic Valley Williams games and add his touch to them.

[12:31] And now we're never going to see that. And that sucks. And I know we all just want to like punch the wall knowing that we're not going to have any more Lyman Sheets Jr. games.

[12:41] What we can do is jump on his machines and smile and enjoy what he gave us. The most soulful, the most passionate and the most alive Pimball experiences on planet Earth.

[12:55] It's something to be said for that. This man put more soul into Pimball than anybody. For those young designers and coders out there, you should play all of his games.

[13:06] You should study him relentlessly because he had it and he had that intangible, right? He had that intangible thing that just made it all work. It just clicked. Everything he touched.

[13:18] He was able to assemble all of the parts of a game in a way that just worked. And there's really nothing else to say. And I'm doing this podcast for everybody.

[13:27] I know I've taken my show behind the Canadian Club walls and I'm not coming back to the main airwaves. But I just wanted to do this for everybody because how I feel about Lyman, I wanted to share with all of you, not just the club members, okay?

[13:41] Now I want to take a 30 second moment of silence for Lyman Sheets, raise a glass, close your eyes, think about the man in his family and all he gave us.

[13:51] And then I want to play a complete song that just captures how I feel about Lyman and his contribution to Pimball that he really created a chain reaction that went through the entire Pimball hobby and will always go through the entire Pimball hobby.

[14:06] And he's united more of us and brought more of us joy than any figure in Pimball. Lyman, we're going to miss you. We love you and we'll see you on the other side, brother.
