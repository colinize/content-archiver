[00:00] I will talk to John, get the money, motherfucker, and say that.

[00:03] No more patience.

[00:05] I will talk to my guy.

[00:07] No more patience.

[00:09] Man.

[00:11] I can't believe I have to do this show again.

[00:17] I can't believe I have to turn on this microphone and talk to all of you out there and I'm going

[00:22] to start at the end of this story and I'm going to start with what you all need to do

[00:28] right now.

[00:29] And we need to do it as a community because we have to send a message to these companies

[00:34] that we will not tolerate products that are defective.

[00:39] And I would give you this advice whether it was the car you bought or the bottle of wine

[00:44] you opened up if you went into McDonald's, okay?

[00:48] And you ordered a hamburger and your friend's hamburger tasted great and your hamburger

[00:54] tasted like crap with that burger joint stay in business.

[00:59] So how is it that we get more consistency at McDonald's than we do at Jersey Jack Pimble?

[01:07] And the time has come.

[01:08] I can't believe I have to do a show like this.

[01:10] I can't believe I have to once again tell all of you out there that right now as of today

[01:17] I would not buy a Jersey Jack game until this problem is fixed.

[01:22] And we're going to talk about how I am completely flabbergasted that we are here again.

[01:28] And I'm saying this because it's upsetting because not only is this my dream theme, not

[01:33] only is this a company with incredible people over there, but I'm here to tell you right

[01:37] now this is going to be a very candid episode of Canatus Pimble podcast because it doesn't

[01:42] matter how many awards you win.

[01:45] It doesn't matter how amazingly exciting your launch video is.

[01:49] It doesn't matter how many assets slash gave you.

[01:53] It doesn't matter that you spent 40 hours coding, live and let die and got Paul McCartney

[01:59] to give you the rights.

[02:00] It doesn't matter that Keith Johnson is doing all this hard work that day and gave this

[02:04] incredible art package that all of this stuff is wrapped up into one of the greatest

[02:09] Pimble masterpieces of all time because ultimately it comes down to one simple thing.

[02:15] The Pimble play field is the foundation of the product that we love.

[02:21] It is the foundation of the product that we buy.

[02:25] If you do not figure out play field quality, you will, you will collapse whatever thing

[02:32] you put on top of it, whatever masterpiece you create, all of the hard work, all of the

[02:37] energy, all of the excitement of the actual game will dissipate and be destroyed and be

[02:44] torpedoed if the foundation of the actual physical game itself is defective.

[02:51] If you build a house on a defective foundation, what happens to it?

[02:56] And I can't believe we're here again because the problem has been identified for years.

[03:03] This is an inexcusable thing right now because if you know what the problem is and you've

[03:07] been having the same problem for years and you're a company that doesn't even put out

[03:13] two games a year, you put out one game every 18 months.

[03:18] Your entire organization builds itself as high end premium Pimble.

[03:24] You have everybody focused on making sure the next game is perfect.

[03:29] You're not making four to five games a year.

[03:31] You're not making vaults of stuff.

[03:33] You have one job and that is to make sure each next release is an improvement upon the

[03:39] game before it.

[03:40] And if you have a major quality control issue like play field issues that you saw on Pirates

[03:46] of the Caribbean, that you saw on Willy Wonka and that you promised everybody when you first

[03:53] showed guns and roses and those first 100 games had play field issues, you went and you

[04:00] told your customers that you fixed the problem.

[04:03] You told your distributors that you fixed the problem.

[04:07] You told the Pimble media that you fixed the problem and guess what we did because we

[04:12] are all good human beings and human beings are wired to be good.

[04:17] We trusted you.

[04:18] We trusted you when you told us that you solved the problem.

[04:22] We trusted you Mirko when you put your little quality control thing in the lower left corner

[04:27] of every play field that Jersey Jack and you had solved this problem.

[04:32] So why is it that this week and the week's prior I am seeing guns and roses collectors

[04:39] edition owners share photos of their play fields falling apart.

[04:44] And I don't mean just a little bit of pooling.

[04:47] I mean the entire artwork and clear coat is lifting up and wrinkling like Christmas paper

[04:54] on top of these play fields.

[04:57] And that's with post that have the washers underneath them that they said was the

[05:02] solve for this problem.

[05:04] So because I'm seeing this because I'm seeing this problem persist on play fields built

[05:10] as late as April 21st.

[05:13] You have not solved the problem.

[05:15] You did not stand up to your side of the agreement with customers.

[05:19] So that is why I am not buying a Jersey Jack Pimble machine ever again until they fixed

[05:25] this problem.

[05:27] If I had an order on a guns and roses Pimble machine right now, I would ask for a refund

[05:33] until this problem is fixed unless you want to roll the dice and play roulette with your

[05:39] money.

[05:40] How can you feel good about unboxing a game because if you do unbox your game and there

[05:46] is an issue with it, you are not going to get a solution that will satisfy you.

[05:52] Now you could be on the camp that's in this community that says just open up your games,

[05:57] flip them, have fun, don't worry about this.

[06:00] If you're one of those people, that's fine.

[06:03] That's not me and that's not most of you.

[06:05] And I don't think anyone out there should turn a blind's eye to a defective quality control

[06:12] issue.

[06:13] This isn't cratering.

[06:14] This isn't dimpling.

[06:16] We all agree that play field dimpling is inevitable.

[06:20] This is not that.

[06:21] This is defective.

[06:22] Okay, and you have to separate those two things.

[06:24] Not all play field issues are the same.

[06:27] This is a defective thing.

[06:29] When the artwork in the clear coat is lifting off a game in less than 50 plays, 100 plays,

[06:35] it's pathetic.

[06:36] I could point out games from the 1990s, Adams families, medieval madness, all these

[06:40] value Williams games people own and they can't find anything like this on the game.

[06:45] And you might be saying, well, they changed the process.

[06:48] They changed how they did the artwork.

[06:50] They changed.

[06:51] I don't care what's changed.

[06:53] It's not my job and it's not your job to become experts on play fields and what to do

[06:59] with play fields or government regulations on water based or oil based.

[07:03] It doesn't matter what matters is this.

[07:06] They hired a vendor to supply their play fields.

[07:10] That vendor is Mirko play fields.

[07:12] They've messed up the play fields on three games in a row.

[07:15] It's Mirko's job to figure out what the solution is.

[07:18] He should be up at night trying new things, experimenting with new solutions to this issue.

[07:23] He should also be looking at the industry.

[07:26] And the industry has shown us that if you remove the artwork from the post areas, it will

[07:30] solve this problem.

[07:32] We saw it with spooky.

[07:33] We saw it with Stern.

[07:34] Stern Pimbal.

[07:35] The biggest Pimbal company in the world had artwork underneath the post when they were

[07:40] making Jurassic Park and they were experiencing issues and what did Stern Pimbal do?

[07:45] They walked over to the big red button on the manufacturing line and slammed their fist

[07:50] into it and they stopped the production and they changed the artwork on the games and

[07:54] they fixed the problem.

[07:55] You know much money it must have cost them to do that but they did it.

[07:59] They did it.

[08:00] They solved the problem and it was a nightmare for them and they also did it in a company

[08:06] that has so much more scale than Jersey Jack that makes so many more games than Jersey

[08:10] Jack that has so much more to focus on than just one product and they still did it.

[08:16] And spooky Pimbal, this little company in Benton, Wisconsin, they figured it out.

[08:21] They're using beta playfields.

[08:23] Why is it that Jersey Jack Pimbal who has all this focus didn't stop production?

[08:29] You have a billionaire backing your company.

[08:32] Your product has all this money supporting it from the back end.

[08:37] Why is it that you didn't halt production even after those first 100 games were all

[08:43] problematic?

[08:44] And we were told it was fixed and now we're seeing the problem on the collectors editions.

[08:53] And now the question becomes this, what do you do?

[08:57] What do you do?

[08:58] Now I want to talk about this from two different points of view.

[09:00] What do you do if you're a customer of Jersey Jack Pimbal or someone who has an order

[09:04] in and I'm going to give you my opinion about what I would do and what do you do if you're

[09:08] Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[09:09] How do you dig yourself out of this hole?

[09:11] This is issues in crisis is something that I handled too with public relations and this

[09:15] is a public relations issue now.

[09:17] This is a public relations issue.

[09:19] It's a disaster.

[09:20] It's not where they want to be and I'm going to go right now and tell you what I would

[09:23] do.

[09:24] Now I told you what I would do if I was a customer.

[09:26] I would not order a game right now.

[09:27] I would get a refund and I know you signed up and it's a no refund policy and that's

[09:32] hogwash.

[09:33] I would fight that and I would challenge that.

[09:36] I would call my credit card company and say, look, you know, I bought this game.

[09:40] They said no refund but the games are having issues and I want my money back.

[09:43] I think all of you out there understand now why it's so important to use a distributor

[09:47] to buy these games because the distributor is the middle man between you and the company

[09:51] and so I would call up my distributor and say, uh-uh, uh-uh.

[09:55] I'm not rolling in the dice with this.

[09:57] I'm not spending 10.5 for this.

[09:59] I'm not spending 12.5 for this.

[10:01] I want my money back or you can give me credit on another title.

[10:04] Go buy a mandalorian.

[10:05] Go buy something else.

[10:06] Go buy something you trust by Spooky Pimbal's next game.

[10:09] Whatever it is, I'm telling my distributor, uh-uh.

[10:12] This sale is not going through and I want a refund because this is just where it's at.

[10:16] Like that's me.

[10:17] This is me personally because and I know I'm a little bit charged around this but I had

[10:20] so much faith and I took their word for it that they had solved the problem and I would

[10:25] just feel like I have no trust left between me and Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[10:31] I have no faith in Jersey Jack Pimbal that they know what they're doing to solve this

[10:35] problem.

[10:36] I just wouldn't have any faith and it doesn't mean I don't love their games.

[10:41] It doesn't mean I don't want their games.

[10:43] This is why the pain stings so badly.

[10:47] If this problem was happening on Thunderbirds and Black Knights sort of rage, nobody would

[10:53] care.

[10:54] This is the nicest Pimbal machine we've seen in a decade.

[10:59] There's a reason why it won all these awards.

[11:01] This is why it's so much more annoying for all of you out there because this was your

[11:06] Pimbal masterpiece and it is a masterpiece and this is why it sucks.

[11:11] I have collectors edition owners who are showing me pictures and last night I was talking

[11:16] to one of them and just the frustration in his voice is Chris.

[11:21] I love this game and I can't believe that this is happening.

[11:25] He said Chris I saw the pictures on the internet and I said this isn't happening to my game.

[11:29] He's like I've barely played my game.

[11:31] I've been traveling for work and all this stuff and I looked down at my game and there

[11:35] it was.

[11:36] One of the posts had completely taken up the artwork and I couldn't believe what I was

[11:41] seeing.

[11:42] It was being like punched in the gut and I've got one of the bad ones and it shouldn't

[11:47] be like there's good or bad batches either.

[11:49] Every game should be good.

[11:50] So if I'm a customer, I want to refund and I'm going to wait.

[11:54] It doesn't mean I don't like your products but I'm not putting up with this and I don't

[11:58] trust you anymore.

[11:59] If I'm Jersey Jack Pimbal, what do you do?

[12:01] Well you got to stop production.

[12:03] You got to stop production and fix this problem.

[12:05] You can't keep sending out games like this.

[12:07] You can't be playing Russian roulette with your company's reputation.

[12:12] So you got to hit that big button on the wall and say stop.

[12:15] We need to evaluate this.

[12:17] Now you're in a really bad situation now because you knew there was a problem with Willy

[12:20] Wonka.

[12:21] You knew there was a problem with Willy Wonka.

[12:23] You knew there was a problem with Pirates of the Caribbean.

[12:25] You knew there was a problem with Mirko Playfields and you stuck with Mirko and the definition

[12:30] of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.

[12:36] So your business decision to stick with Mirko was an insane one now and I completely mean

[12:40] it when I say this.

[12:42] Your decision to stick with Mirko has put all of your hard work and all of the efforts

[12:47] of everybody at that company in jeopardy.

[12:50] A huge quality issue like this can torpedo a company, it can sink in operation, it can

[12:55] ruin you.

[12:56] It can absolutely ruin you.

[12:59] And how this was not priority number one boggles my mind.

[13:03] What were you doing Jersey Jack Pimbal?

[13:06] What were you doing those six to eight months when you moved from New Jersey to Chicago

[13:11] and you weren't even making anything?

[13:13] You could have tested your play field quality.

[13:16] You could have tested all of these things for months and these customers are experiencing

[13:21] these issues right out of the box.

[13:23] So Jersey Jack Pimbal, what were you doing?

[13:26] Were you even quality testing these things?

[13:29] Probably not.

[13:30] The first 100 games had problems.

[13:31] Then you said you fixed it.

[13:33] The collectors edition games have problems.

[13:35] Clearly not fixed.

[13:36] So what do you do if you're Jersey Jack now?

[13:38] So let's imagine we walk into the Jersey Jack boardroom today.

[13:41] You got Ken Cromwell, marketing guy, love you Ken, love you guys and I love these guys

[13:45] and this is what sucks is I love all these guys.

[13:47] They're just I just I don't know what you do.

[13:49] You walk into the boardroom there's Ken.

[13:51] There's Barry, you know the guy who's getting all the tickets when everyone says they

[13:54] want a solution.

[13:55] If you've got Pat Lawler, you got Eric Minier.

[13:58] Jersey Jack's on Skype because you know it's not his company anymore.

[14:01] You've got Leonard, you've got Brett, you've got everybody in this room who's a decision

[14:04] maker with Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[14:06] You've got HR, you've got everybody there and you say what do we do?

[14:10] What do we do now that we have all of these customers who are opening up tickets?

[14:15] What do we do?

[14:16] Look at this damage.

[14:18] You've got Mirko.

[14:19] I mean, how do you not call Mirko up and be like you're going to listen to this?

[14:23] What's the solution?

[14:25] The washers are not the solution.

[14:27] That's been their solution.

[14:28] Let's just mail them out washers and have them put them under these posts and that will

[14:31] be the solution.

[14:33] Nobody is going to accept that.

[14:35] So you can't do that.

[14:36] You can't do the cheap fix, which is the thing they've been trying to do.

[14:39] All right, well, can we mail people unpopulated playfields?

[14:42] Well, who's going to accept that?

[14:44] Because if the playfields are the issue, how is it a solution to have Mirko make you

[14:48] another one?

[14:49] That's not a solution.

[14:50] Well, we can't afford to give people fully populated playfields.

[14:53] That's not a solution.

[14:55] We may have been doing behind the scenes and this is part of what their problem is.

[15:00] Is Barry and some of the customer service folks over at Jersey Jack Pimble have been telling

[15:06] some customers that they would buy their games back?

[15:11] It's not official.

[15:12] It's not in writing anywhere.

[15:14] They don't want to leave a paper trail of this, but they have been telling certain customers

[15:19] if your game is bad, we will give you a refund.

[15:22] Of course, that refund will be at your original purchase price of $9,500, which means if you

[15:27] want to go buy your game back, you now owe them $10,500, we won't even talk about that

[15:32] part of it.

[15:33] They didn't do it though.

[15:34] That's the thing.

[15:35] Is they didn't buy people's games back?

[15:37] They made a promise or an offer that they did not stand behind because clearly they

[15:41] realized that there are far more games that are problematic and they can't afford to refund

[15:48] people's games.

[15:50] Think about all the money associated with that.

[15:52] All the money going back out to customers, all the money for shipping, the headache for

[15:57] distributors to coordinate all of this.

[16:00] This is not a simple product.

[16:02] It's crazy.

[16:04] You have to get Pimble right at the beginning.

[16:07] You have to put these games on location to test their quality for months.

[16:11] That's what they used to do in the Valley Williams days.

[16:14] If you don't get it right by the time you've made $500,000, you're screwed.

[16:20] You really are screwed.

[16:22] The only thing that's going to happen, I'm telling you this, there's no solution because

[16:25] the only real solution here for all of you listening to this, is that they get rid of

[16:31] Mirko and they say moving forward, we are going to make play fields with a new vendor

[16:36] and we have a new process.

[16:38] Then down the road, because you can't do it right now, I think down the road, they're

[16:44] going to have to do something where they mail everybody who's got a problematic playfield,

[16:49] a new playfield made by a new playfield manufacturer or vendor that doesn't have this issue.

[16:57] It's just like something to give you peace of mind.

[17:00] It's not a solve for the game you're playing, but at least you know if you ever want to swap

[17:04] the new playfield in, you can and you can bring your game to perfect condition.

[17:10] That's something that everyone would want.

[17:11] The problem there is they've just made too many games now.

[17:15] You can't send 1500 people replacement playfields, it would tank them.

[17:20] It would absolutely tank them and it would absolutely eat away at all the money they've

[17:24] made on this hit title.

[17:26] Guns and Roes is so damn popular and they have so many orders for it that it's not like

[17:31] pirates of the Caribbean where even though pirates had issues, only a thousand people

[17:35] have pirates of the Caribbean and this is much more widespread.

[17:40] Maybe it took a problem and now like five times the amount of people are going to have

[17:44] the headaches as opposed to just a smaller group of people to become so much harder than

[17:49] to create resolution.

[17:51] So what do you do if you're Jersey Jack Pimble?

[17:53] What do you do?

[17:54] Do you finally come out and actually admit there's a problem?

[17:58] Do you finally ask the community for forgiveness?

[18:02] But I think they need, they need to find a new playfield vendor because Mirko, you're tanking

[18:08] this company, you're torpedoing all the hard work of the Jersey Jack Pimble folks.

[18:14] Now I don't know the dynamics, I don't know the behind the scenes, I'll tell you this,

[18:17] I tried to reach out to Mirko playfields a few times and he won't respond, he won't

[18:22] answer any questions about the quality of his own product.

[18:26] I mean let's talk about that for a second.

[18:29] How much faith do we have in a guy who's running a business who refuses to talk to you

[18:35] about his own product?

[18:37] Can we just stop there?

[18:38] Is that the kind of vendor you would sign a contract with and put your entire brand

[18:44] reputation in that man's hands over in Germany?

[18:49] And I don't care how many videos he makes of him over torquing posts into these games

[18:53] and showing how great his quality is because Mirko, what am I looking at right now brother?

[18:58] Think about that.

[18:59] Mirko, I would love to just sit Mirko down and be like, okay, you showed us that video,

[19:04] you say you have this new quality thing in your play field indicator, then what the hell

[19:09] is this man?

[19:10] What is this?

[19:11] Who's lying?

[19:12] Who's lying man?

[19:13] You're lying about your quality if this is the problem.

[19:18] Now is the problem there over torquing stuff?

[19:20] I doubt it, it's affecting areas of the play field all over the play field.

[19:24] Here's the problem, the only solution Jersey Jack can do right now I think is ask for forgiveness.

[19:31] Say they're going to remedy the situation moving forward.

[19:34] Maybe they give some of these buyers of these collectors additions, some credit towards

[19:38] the next collectors addition as a way to say like we're sorry, they're not going to be

[19:43] able to do anything that's very tangible and physical for you because they will go

[19:48] out of business if they have to address all of the games with problems and look we don't

[19:53] want Jersey Jack to go out of business.

[19:56] They are bringing the most exciting pinball to the marketplace, but this is the problem.

[20:01] You can't bring the most exciting and the most full featured games and then have a problem

[20:07] with the foundation of your product itself.

[20:10] What sucks is this is that they're not even making the play fields.

[20:14] This is why like even last night as I was thinking about this is like where should your

[20:19] anger lie and my I mean I'm mad at Mirko.

[20:23] I'm very mad at Mirko because Mirko all he's doing is painting wood and clearing it.

[20:30] And that is not as much hard work as the months and months and years of R&D being done by

[20:37] Keith Johnson and Eric and slash and all of the hard work that actually goes into the pinball

[20:43] machine itself.

[20:45] You don't even want a notice clear coat.

[20:47] It just it just should be there.

[20:48] It should work and it shouldn't lift and it shouldn't pull up the artwork.

[20:52] All of the hard work by everybody else is actually being a race by this one guy who

[20:59] can't figure out what he's supposed to be the expert on.

[21:03] Can you imagine in any other scenario in life in which you know you're building a car let's

[21:07] say in every single part of the car needs to work together to be a successful driving

[21:11] experience and then the guy who's making the tires which is like really what the game's

[21:16] running on the tires just keep exploding.

[21:20] So as much fun as the car is how would you own a car if every time you went like 500

[21:25] miles the tire is exploded and that's what's happening here.

[21:28] It's these damn playfields are exploding right in front of customers and and there's no

[21:33] excuse.

[21:34] There's absolutely no excuse.

[21:35] So I'm here to tell you on this episode of Canadian Spinball Podcast on the day in which

[21:39] we're about to see the Mandalorian and about to see what Stern has put into this game.

[21:44] I'm here to tell you on the other side of the fence your biggest fan of Guns and Rose

[21:48] is pinball machine is telling all of you out there to don't buy this game right now

[21:54] and to call up your distributors and tell them you want your money back until they fix

[21:58] this problem because I think the only way they're going to learn is if we stop buying these

[22:04] products and here we are we're still buying them.

[22:07] We saw this problem on pirates we saw it on Willy Wonka and we all ran in in box guns

[22:12] and roses because we have stars in our eyes because the game was so amazing but now we

[22:17] realize that this thing is going to be a headache for those of you out there who want to have

[22:23] a collectible game or a game in which you just want the game to be in good condition

[22:28] because it will hurt your resale value.

[22:30] It will hurt your peace of mind and it will hurt your enjoyment in this hobby.

[22:36] It just will.

[22:37] If you have a choice of a game that has no issues or playfield issues which would you choose.

[22:42] If you're buying a collector's edition and we know this that collectors are more

[22:46] OCD and they want to keep their stuff in great condition.

[22:49] If you're an OCD collector you have faith that Jersey Jack solved this problem and you're

[22:54] looking down at your collector's edition and it's fallen apart and the whole definition

[22:59] of things that are worth collecting we take better care of collectibles.

[23:04] If you have a collectible toy it's up on a shelf in a in a in a acrylic box.

[23:09] If you have a Michael Jordan rookie card and it's a collectible what gives it its real

[23:13] value is the condition of the card.

[23:16] Imagine if someone was bending it up and not creasing it and then saying oh you should

[23:19] still be happy because you still own a Michael Jordan rookie card it's like no I want

[23:24] to own it but I want to own it in great condition and that's what's happening with these games.

[23:29] Everyone was so happy they got one of the 500 and now all of those owners are looking

[23:34] down at their games nervously hoping they don't see an issue and unfortunately for a lot

[23:40] of them right now they're starting to see issues and here's the thing is that a lot of

[23:44] people won't share it they won't share it but my whole thing is this if we're seeing

[23:49] this many problems on Pinside it's not just a select few there is no way this is a ticking

[23:55] time bomb that is going to hit so many more of these games and I just would not go in

[24:00] on a game right now and this is why Jersey Jack Pimball doesn't like me this is why

[24:04] Jack Gwynari won't talk to me anymore because I told people to stop buying Willy Wonka

[24:09] because of the play field issues and they actually stopped production and apparently they

[24:14] fixed it but they didn't because there's also a lot of Willy Wonka collectors additions

[24:18] out there with the same issues the problem is Mirko but Jersey Jack Pimball continues to

[24:24] work with Mirko and so on this episode I just want to sign off by saying this you got

[24:29] to speak with your wallet you got to stand up you got to put on your big boy pants and

[24:33] be an adult and if your game is having issues do me a favor share your problem with the

[24:39] community show your pictures to Pinside to Facebook get the word out there that you

[24:46] too are having an issue if you keep it quiet if you bury what's going on with your game

[24:53] you're hurting the rest of us because the more people that speak up the more people

[24:58] that say something the faster they're going to have to respond the faster they're going

[25:04] to have to fix the issue and the best way we can do this I mean it's the best way we can

[25:09] respond to them is by not buying their games and why should you trust a company that's

[25:16] had three times in a row to solve this problem and they're listening to this right now they're

[25:22] all listening to this I know my friends over there J.J.P. listening to Canadian Spinball

[25:25] Podcasts and I'm still personally I'm friends with all of them but there's no point there's

[25:30] no point in me asking them what they're doing because they'll never tell me there's a mistake

[25:35] they won't be able to tell me what the solution is because they don't know they don't know

[25:40] this is why this podcast exists I'm on your side I'm not a shield for anybody I wouldn't

[25:47] buy this game the way this condition is right now it's still a better game than a lot

[25:51] of other games out there but all of this has to work together pinball is an expensive

[25:56] product you shouldn't have to sacrifice quality if I were to summarize I think the most

[26:01] annoying thing about the pinball hobby it's it's always been one big compromise it's like

[26:07] the company that consistently makes the most games with the best themes has the worst stuff

[26:13] in them like stern pinball is lazy with mechanisms and magic and they've fallen back on artwork

[26:19] and LCD and but they're the most consistent makers of the greatest pinball themes ever and yet there's

[26:25] not as much magic under the glass you've got to put up with that compromise Jersey Jack pinball

[26:30] the company that is putting the most into their games has quality control issues that they can't

[26:35] solve even if it's the same issue over and over again they just keep running into the wall over

[26:40] and over again I don't understand it and they tell their customers the punch sand when they have

[26:45] an issue and I think people are sick of it and they're over it so you have that you can't get

[26:50] good quality and a JJP machine you've got to always have to figure out like what is it worth it

[26:55] to put up with those headaches to have that kind of experience and then you got spooky pinball

[26:59] who ultimately ultimately the one company that doesn't really make you compromise much is spooky

[27:06] pinball and I don't see any issues over there I don't see people like complaining about stuff and

[27:11] spookies has had their issues with playfield quality and now they're making the best playfields

[27:16] in the marketplace so if you're over at spooky pinball take it bow so I'll tell you right now

[27:21] whether it's Halloween or not I think it might be I might be wrong I don't really care whatever

[27:26] their next game is it doesn't matter everyone is gonna buy that game confident that they're not

[27:31] gonna have any issues with quality and yeah there might be some rattling in this and that but they'll

[27:36] improve that stuff and it's easier to fix those things than it is a playfield but I tell you

[27:42] right now when it comes to playfield confidence the small little company in Benton Wisconsin is

[27:48] showing Stern and Jersey Jack how it's done congratulations spooky I love you guys even though you

[27:55] probably hate me right now but you're doing something right and I just may maybe I'll buy your next

[27:59] game we'll see what the theme is but it's always a compromise it's always a compromise and it shouldn't

[28:05] be at these prices so that's it that's it enjoy this podcast and speak with your wallets and put

[28:13] your big boy pants on and share with the rest of us what your experience is if you think I'm going

[28:19] too far by telling people not to buy games right now hit me up at canada pinballadgemo.com if you're

[28:25] having issues with your game share photos to me at canada pinballadgemo.com and I will share them

[28:30] on my Facebook page I just told 2 to 3,000 people to stop buying products until a problem is solved

[28:39] I don't know how anyone can have a problem with me saying that and for all my other pinball media

[28:43] out there I mean this it's about time all of you stop ignoring this problem as well you have a

[28:49] responsibility to the people in this community and in this hobby to not run away from this I get that

[28:57] you want to get these people on your shows I get that your friends with people in the pinball

[29:01] community but this is something that we should all rally behind okay where are the other shows

[29:08] talking about this where is the other coverage about this there's so few and far between this

[29:13] should be front page news on this week in pinball like when this happens jersey jack pinball lies

[29:21] about fixing play field quality issues as guns and roses machines start to disintegrate where's

[29:26] that on this week in pinball where are all the podcast talking about this and I don't mean to like

[29:32] really pick on you guys but I'm picking on you guys because what is the point of doing a pinball

[29:37] podcast we are here to talk about the topics that matter it's just the same stuff over and over

[29:44] and over again but what's happening over here is you have hundreds of pinball buyers that are

[29:49] frustrated right now and in pain and we owe them we owe them our channels as a place to highlight

[29:57] what they're going through to bring positive change to pinball you know when people say

[30:01] can it your toxic your negative I'm here trying to get positive change in the hobby I'm here trying

[30:09] to stand up for you and that is important so I do encourage all of you other podcasters out there

[30:15] and pinball media let's not let this go don't just be like that's canada off in the corner

[30:21] ranting and raving this problem needs to be solved and you should be telling all of your listeners

[30:26] as well I wouldn't buy until they fix the problem simple common sense the problem is we've lost

[30:32] common sense in today's world everyone wants to just like pretend like everything is roses

[30:37] but we need to hold on to our guns as customers and tell them nope we're not buying until you fix

[30:43] this problem and to miracle playfields I just want to say this to you Mirko you've been hiding for

[30:48] years you haven't solved this problem you refuse to talk to people about your own products I do think

[30:55] you should be ashamed that you've done this year after year after year this is your livelihood

[31:00] this is your craft this is your expertise there is no excuse that you have no idea what you're doing

[31:07] you should not be offering playfields to companies if you can't figure it out and you serve do

[31:13] deserve the lion's share of the blame all of those hardworking people over at Jersey Jack all those

[31:20] people we saw in the video at the Twippy Awards you know all those people that are going into that

[31:25] company every day Mirko they rely on you to give them a quality product every time you mail them

[31:33] a defective playfield you are letting all of those people down and your company over in Germany

[31:40] has the ability to tank and torpedo Jersey Jack Pimble and you're doing it and you're succeeding at

[31:47] failing and I think you need to say I'm not mailing you another game until I figure it out you know

[31:55] much money Mirko is making his bank account is through the roof because he's mailing us his defective

[32:01] products and for all of us out there we're left holding the bag but no more no more this has been

[32:08] episode 582 of Canada's Pimble podcast I look forward to seeing Mandalorian today look forward to

[32:14] seeing of Halloween is the next spooky title I'm always going to be an advocate for all of you out

[32:19] there I'm always going to be a thorn in the side to all the companies that are mailing us defective

[32:23] products but I'm not going to stop that's why I do this it's why I'm here because without Canada

[32:29] no one else does this so don't forget that don't forget that I always got your back

[32:34] we're not going to buy these companies double talking jive later
