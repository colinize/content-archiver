[00:00] If you're listening to this right now and you're not a member of the Canadian Club,

[00:04] you're missing the greatest pinball podcast ever.

[00:07] The show is better than it's ever been and I know it's only $5 to get through the door

[00:13] as the minimum.

[00:14] But I'm going to get all of you and here's what you've been missing right now.

[00:17] Just go over to Patreon and give in.

[00:20] Now people might be wondering who is Jennifer because you are not a name that comes up in

[00:25] the pinball world.

[00:26] Jennifer, what's your connection to pinball?

[00:28] I worked at Deeproot in 2019.

[00:31] I was one of the technical writers there.

[00:34] I mean, many of us talked about like, what in the world is going on here?

[00:39] How is this happening financially and why?

[00:43] Like, what does this have to do with anything?

[00:45] What we're just doing everything now, you know?

[00:47] How do you make up for a year of no fathoms on the line?

[00:52] There's no way they made enough money from Keltz to fund all of this.

[00:57] The only man I've ever seen get a standing ovation at the Twippies, Mr. Todd Tucky,

[01:03] Todd, welcome to the show.

[01:04] Hey, thanks, Chris.

[01:06] I wish I was in shock.

[01:08] I bet the Toy Story game is contractually obligated to be out by the time the Buzz Light

[01:14] Your Movie comes out in June.

[01:16] Put Knai to Down.

[01:17] I'm a betting man.

[01:18] Put me down for Jack Danger making Knai Masters of the Universe.

[01:23] I think the most beautiful pinball machine to stand over is the Monsters.

[01:28] I mean, it's just so beautiful.

[01:32] And now, just two days later, he is sending out invoices for people to pay their invoices

[01:39] in full to get their fathoms get ready for it in eight weeks.

[01:44] He's now promising games will be on the line in eight weeks.

[01:47] There are many of you in the pinball world that consider Weird Al to be a dream theme.

[01:53] And so moving 227 Weird Al games, all of a sudden doesn't really seem like it's that

[02:01] hard to do, right?

[02:02] What do you think about Todd Toy Story for?

[02:04] That's the room over Jersey Jack.

[02:06] Oh, my God.

[02:11] They're never going to make enough.

[02:13] Oh, wow.

[02:14] Okay, I agree.

[02:15] They're never going to make enough.

[02:16] I mean, think about how crazy that is.

[02:18] Stern could fulfill the Weird Al Ellie orders in three days.

[02:23] And so the rumor I'm hearing in August, we are going to get jaws from Stern Pinball.

[02:29] Jaws the big shark, right?

[02:30] Not jaws as a codename for James Bond.

[02:33] That Jersey Jack Pinball is contractually obligated to send out two games this year.

[02:39] And here's why I think they are contractually obligated to get two games out.

[02:43] So here's the ultimate question I want to ask.

[02:46] And I'm asking this of myself every day.

[02:49] You've got $2,000 deposit on this game.

[02:52] Are you really going to cut them a check for $7,000 or $8,000 more to get it?

[02:57] Like really?

[02:58] How do you do that?

[02:59] How do you willingly, knowingly, send more money in on a game you know has lost a lot of

[03:06] value.

[03:07] You're just throwing more money in the fire.

[03:10] That was it, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:12] Just a little example of Canadian Spinball Podcast.

[03:14] I'm doing new shows at least two times a week.

[03:18] And every single one of my club members is super happy with the content.

[03:22] The show is better than it's ever been.

[03:24] The show is absolutely directly to the point.

[03:28] You get like 20 to 30 minutes of all you need to know about what's happening in the pinball

[03:33] world.

[03:34] Thank you so much for all my club members.

[03:35] And if you're not a club member, I'm going to get you.

[03:38] We're going to get to 1,000 club members one day.

[03:40] Have a great day everybody.
