[00:00] Pump up the jam, pump it up, why your feet are stumping?

[00:04] And the jam is pumping, look ahead, the crowd are jumping.

[00:07] Pump it up a little more, get the party going on the dance floor.

[00:11] See, cause that's where the party's at and you find out if you do that.

[00:15] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:19] Uh, welcome everybody to Canatus Pinball Podcast, my first show after Pinball Expo 2025, and it is no mystery.

[00:29] The Winchester Mystery House was the talk of the show.

[00:34] I want to talk about what we're going through right now.

[00:37] We are post expo, we have 525 spots for this game that have been sold to customers.

[00:45] You cannot find one.

[00:47] It is the hot game in town.

[00:50] There are thousands of Star Wars games that will be made, thousands of Harry Potter's,

[00:56] thousands upon thousands and yet a 525 unit game has everybody on pin side talking.

[01:06] It's got the pinball community talking and it had the longest lines at the show.

[01:12] Now, I've covered this hobby for a really long time and I've seen the different stages that people go through.

[01:19] Whenever a game comes out that has FOMO and this definitely is one of those games.

[01:27] I've been thinking a lot about this over the last like 48 hours, how I want to talk about this game right now.

[01:34] In a way that's using a little bit of common sense because I'm in the hype thread and for some weird reason,

[01:40] it's like that thread should not be called the hype thread.

[01:44] It should just be called like the Winchester Mystery House discussion thread.

[01:49] Because you know your job going into that thread isn't to hype the game.

[01:54] They don't need any hype.

[01:55] They've sold everyone and when you try to have a little bit of a discussion,

[02:00] you are sometimes kicked out of the room.

[02:03] And then what happens is the naysayers love to go into those hype threads and troll the thread.

[02:10] And then you know you'll get the owner's thread eventually when someone gets a game.

[02:14] And we've seen this time and time again.

[02:16] There's always a lot of excitement and then there's also like a small group of people

[02:21] that always tries to ruin everybody's excitement and goes into these threads

[02:26] and starts to talk smack about a game that they've never played.

[02:30] But here's the truth.

[02:31] The truth is this.

[02:33] The majority of people who have put down a deposit to buy this game

[02:39] have never played a single game on it.

[02:44] The other truth is this.

[02:45] The people who have played this game, the majority of them,

[02:49] played the game at Pinball Expo maybe, maybe three to five times max.

[02:57] That's how long it took to wait online to get on it.

[03:02] So everybody giving their opinions about this game right now,

[03:07] everybody's proclamations of whether it's great, whether it's brutal,

[03:12] if the animations are better than stern animations,

[03:16] if the callouts are good or bad, if the music is good or bad,

[03:19] if the lights are atmospheric or could use some work.

[03:23] Everybody's observations of what it's like to play this game are very, very premature.

[03:32] Nobody's had this game in a home environment, in an intimate setting.

[03:38] Nobody's put an hour uninterrupted on this game.

[03:43] Nobody can give you a real opinion about whether or not it has that one more game feel.

[03:49] We're just excited that there's a new game in the Pinball world that's not a stern.

[03:57] I mean, if you have to really distill it down to why there's so much excitement for this game,

[04:04] it is a combination of a few simple things.

[04:08] We are finally getting a limited game that feeds the exact thing that collectors are starving for.

[04:17] And when you're starving for something, you will eat something that is off the ground.

[04:24] I'm not saying this game is food off the ground,

[04:27] but you know what I'm saying?

[04:28] It's like all these collectors out there that have been burned by all of these stern elites,

[04:34] all these collectors out there that don't have anything special if you bought a Harry Potter CE

[04:39] because everybody has one, all of these collectors that would never buy a Pinball Brothers game

[04:45] or a Pedretti game, all of these collectors that don't want Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,

[04:51] what are your options?

[04:53] And all of these collectors who might not like the Evil Dead movies, you know what I'm saying?

[04:57] It's like this game was just something different, something unique, something we didn't see coming.

[05:07] It caught lightning in a bottle.

[05:10] And so you serve it up to a Pinball collector community that's been starving for anything different,

[05:17] anything to make them feel like they got something that other people didn't get.

[05:22] They're in on something unique.

[05:24] They're excited to get it in the crazy Pinball pricing world.

[05:28] The price is kind of right, $11,600 in a world in which you can go spend $15,000 left and right

[05:35] on more mass produced machines.

[05:38] And so it hit, it hit.

[05:41] And that is absolutely what has happened in the Pinball world.

[05:45] Now here's the other part.

[05:47] Nobody knows if the game is great or not.

[05:50] This game is not a jump on it and you're going to have a kinetic connection with it the way

[05:58] you might have with the Keith Elwyn game.

[06:00] You are not going to hop on this game and have a kinetic connection the way you felt

[06:06] when you played Elton John or Harry Potter.

[06:08] Trust me, it doesn't shoot that well.

[06:11] Now my observation from my own gameplay and watching other people play it is a little interesting.

[06:18] Two things are happening at once.

[06:20] My ball times were not short.

[06:23] Okay, so it's not brutal in the sense of when I first hopped on Ghostbusters and it's like

[06:30] drain, drain, drain.

[06:32] When I first hopped on Ninja Turtles, it's like drain, drain, drain.

[06:36] It's not like that.

[06:37] You're not just going to get served up a whole bunch of unfair drains and it's going to frustrate

[06:43] you like that.

[06:43] What's going to happen when you first play this game is the shots are just hard to find.

[06:49] So it's kind of like long ball times, but you might not be hitting much that frequently

[06:56] when you play the game.

[06:57] And when a game is like that, when there are tight shots that are not like instantly gratifying,

[07:03] it comes down to like two camps will form.

[07:07] Those who say, well, you just got to find the shots and once you find the shots, the game

[07:12] is amazing.

[07:12] Like there's going to be that camp.

[07:14] And then there might be a camp of people that just say, hey, I don't find the

[07:18] design that rewarding.

[07:20] I would much rather jump on a game that has a lot more immediate kinetic satisfaction

[07:27] and gameplay.

[07:28] Look, I've played a lot of pinball machines.

[07:31] I remember playing Foo Fighters for the first time and it's shot like butter.

[07:35] I remember playing X-Men for the first time and the shots were incredible.

[07:39] I remember playing Godzilla, even playing games like Venom games like Star Trek.

[07:44] I mean, there's certain games when you jump on it for the first time,

[07:48] you just feel this connection with it.

[07:51] You know, there's always going to be a little bit of a learning curve on something that's

[07:55] not a stern as well, because we are for the most part so used to the stern flipper feel,

[08:02] the stern flipper angle, the stern flipper power.

[08:06] And when you jump on this game, the mystery house, it's not the same.

[08:10] The geometry is not the same.

[08:12] The flipper feels not the same.

[08:13] So there's going to be a learning curve and nobody who's giving any impressions

[08:19] really knows how they're even going to feel after they put like two hours onto this game.

[08:25] So two things are occurring right now in our community.

[08:27] There are 525 people who are very excited and in on a game that is absolutely sold out.

[08:35] Now that is awesome.

[08:36] That is awesome for those people that are excited.

[08:39] It is awesome for Barrels of Fun to have brought this game out of nowhere

[08:44] and got that kind of response from the community.

[08:47] If you don't think that's awesome and you want to march in and slam these people

[08:53] and make fun of these people and say it's this or that, I think something's wrong with you.

[08:59] You need to remember we're in this hobby because we want to be excited.

[09:04] We're in this hobby because we want to see our friends in this hobby excited.

[09:09] We're not in this hobby to root against these companies.

[09:13] And when a company comes out with something that hits like this,

[09:17] we all should be excited.

[09:19] I want more stuff like this in pinball.

[09:21] Now the other side of the coin is this.

[09:23] It's way too early.

[09:25] It's way too early to know if this is going to be a great game.

[09:29] It's way too early to know if this game is going to have replay value.

[09:34] If this game can hold its own against other machines in your lineup.

[09:41] And what's going to happen next is this.

[09:44] Once this game gets made and gets sent out to customers,

[09:50] then we enter the next chapter of this game's history or lifespan, if you will.

[09:57] Then it's going to come down to the game.

[09:59] Then the game is going to have to deliver on the tremendous hype and excitement

[10:06] that it generated in the community.

[10:08] Because we know that 90% of our enthusiasm in pinball, 90% of the conversation and the energy

[10:16] is all about the chase to find the next great thing.

[10:21] We're like kids on Christmas morning.

[10:23] We just can't wait to unbox the new game.

[10:25] But once you unbox it and once you set it up, then it's all about the game.

[10:31] Because what's going to happen next is streamers are going to get it.

[10:35] And we're going to see way more of this game than we even can handle.

[10:40] And that's the thing.

[10:41] It's like at the show, you're just getting little bits, little morsels are getting served up to people.

[10:47] Again, a starving pinball collecting community is getting served up.

[10:52] Just tiny morsels of the game.

[10:54] And watching Carl stream it will not change anybody's mind because he's so good.

[11:03] It's not Carl playing the game that's going to win people over.

[11:07] I want to see how retro Ralph plays the game.

[11:11] Or someone like me or someone like Kerry Hardy.

[11:14] Like how is an average pinball player?

[11:18] How are they going to feel after banging on this game for an hour or two or for a week or two?

[11:26] And so we're going to find all that out.

[11:28] None of it matters to barrels.

[11:30] They're sold out.

[11:30] They've done their job.

[11:31] Once a manufacturer hits the right chord with the community, their job is done.

[11:37] They now have to make the game.

[11:38] They now have to finish the code.

[11:40] But that's all they need to worry about now.

[11:42] Because you got to remember like whether or not the code becomes amazing or not,

[11:46] does not put one more dollar now into the pocket of barrels of fun.

[11:52] And you know, the game's 11-6.

[11:54] I also think they're going to reveal an amazing topper for the game

[11:58] that's got like holographic spirits and they're going to sell every one of those.

[12:02] Because anyone who buys this game will topper it up.

[12:06] So now we're at October 21st.

[12:09] And so when will the first games make it out?

[12:12] I heard it was end of this month, which means we're only going to have to wait another week or so.

[12:18] And then we're going to start to see more about this game.

[12:22] I do think, and again, it's almost November.

[12:25] I do think they are not going to be able to make like 200 of these by January.

[12:31] The moment we see Beetlejuice, everybody knows the hype will shift to that game.

[12:38] There won't even be two times as many Beetlejuice games available for a starving pinball community.

[12:48] And there is at least 10 times the demand for Beetlejuice as a theme.

[12:55] As there is for Winchester.

[12:58] And that's my only question about this game is after you own it and after you've gone down those

[13:03] hallways and explored those rooms and heard the call outs and the jokes many, many times,

[13:10] will you still want to keep jumping in?

[13:14] There's something about truly licensed themes where it's like based on movies you love,

[13:20] you're not going to get tired of it because you love it so much.

[13:23] And these are movies like Beetlejuice that have lasted like almost four decades of fandom.

[13:30] And so, you know, this Winchester, it's brand new.

[13:33] It hasn't even lasted four weeks of excitement or hype.

[13:38] So there is still a lot of mystery surrounding this mystery game on how us as a community

[13:46] will respond to this game over time.

[13:50] I hope it delivers on the hype.

[13:52] I hope the code and everything in the game is satisfying.

[13:57] My one big worry about the game is the gameplay.

[14:01] That is my one big worry about the game itself.

[14:05] I'm worried about the upper right flipper shop the most.

[14:09] I do think when you have places on the play field that you want to get to,

[14:13] like that upper left ramp looks super fun, the staircase to nowhere.

[14:17] If you make it really, really too challenging to hit,

[14:22] that is a design mistake.

[14:25] There should not be a ramp in a game.

[14:28] And I mean this, there should not be any ramp in any pinball machine ever made that is difficult to hit.

[14:36] I don't like that.

[14:38] What should make a pinball machine difficult is the code, not the layout.

[14:44] A pinball machine's layout should be buttery smooth.

[14:48] And the shots that you need to hit and want to hit should not be too difficult to find.

[14:54] I think that's always been a little bit of an apologist position when people say you have to find this shot.

[15:00] It's such BS.

[15:01] You know what I'm saying?

[15:02] It's like a pinball machine should be designed in a way where the difficulty is in comboing the shots.

[15:08] Because here's the thing, when shots are really hard and really difficult,

[15:12] like they were telling me you got to hit it way on the tip of the upper right flipper,

[15:17] it's like why?

[15:18] Like why would you design it to be such a difficult way to get the ball from A to B?

[15:25] Imagine if it's like easy to hit those shots and combo it into something.

[15:30] That's what brings real satisfaction in pinball.

[15:33] Being able to combo up, enjoy the flow, like ripped shot after shot after shot.

[15:40] And the real challenge comes from getting through the modes and the code in a way that lets you unlock.

[15:47] A lot of magical moments in the game.

[15:49] If you're struggling to find shots and things are bricking left and right, nobody likes a brick fest.

[15:55] I think it's too early to tell whether or not this game is going to have that kinetic satisfaction or not.

[16:02] Because if you read people's feedback, everybody's saying the same thing.

[16:06] There's a lot to shoot at in the game.

[16:08] There's a lot you want to shoot at in the game.

[16:11] But will it be satisfying to shoot at all those things in the game?

[16:17] Or will it be frustrating?

[16:19] And I think that's going to be determined over the next few weeks as more and more people and normal people get on the game.

[16:26] Alright, so Winchester Mystery House sold out.

[16:29] I just leaked an image of the Cuphead game from American Pinball.

[16:34] A lot of yellow in there.

[16:36] It does look like an interesting pin.

[16:38] It also feels like if American Pinball surprised everybody and showed this game at Expo and just gauged people's interest in it,

[16:47] I think they would have got a lot of orders for it.

[16:51] And I think it would have maybe convinced them to turn back on their pinball division.

[16:56] But I don't think we're ever going to see it.

[16:58] But I do know this.

[16:59] There is video floating around of gameplay of this game.

[17:03] I don't have it.

[17:04] Someone else who I know has it.

[17:06] I'm not going to mention his name.

[17:08] But it's out there and it's going to leak someday soon.

[17:11] Alright, we also heard this week that Stern Pinball is planning to reveal the Walking Dead.

[17:16] This is so silly.

[17:18] The Walking Dead before Halloween.

[17:20] So great job Stern.

[17:22] You had everybody at Pinball Expo.

[17:25] You had thousands of people at Pinball Expo.

[17:29] And your plan was to shove a mediocre Star Wars game down everybody's throat instead of getting orders

[17:37] for the Walking Dead.

[17:39] Your strategy is not going to work.

[17:41] Star Wars is terrible.

[17:43] I don't frequently say a Stern machine is terrible.

[17:46] But Star Wars is absolutely terrible.

[17:49] And I don't think this Walking Dead remaster now,

[17:52] where you're going to reveal it over the internet.

[17:55] It's not going to be at any show.

[17:58] And people are just tired of Stern's antics and here we go again.

[18:03] And I think there is a large growing part of this community that just doesn't care anymore

[18:11] to support Stern and its same old strategy and tactics.

[18:16] I think a lot of us want to send Stern a message by not buying their games.

[18:22] By not rewarding their lazy strategy.

[18:26] Where's their mystery game?

[18:28] Where's their surprise and delight?

[18:30] Where's their game we didn't see coming?

[18:33] Where's their game with a lot of magic?

[18:35] Where's their game with a new artist that's exciting us?

[18:38] Where's their game with mechanisms we haven't seen before?

[18:41] Where's their game with a really cool ghost pepper effect that's happening in that Winchester game?

[18:47] Where's their game with sculpts not flat plastics?

[18:50] It's over Stern.

[18:52] We see right through you.

[18:53] You made great games for so many years but they look damn cheap.

[18:58] And it's not going to work anymore.

[19:00] And they've got to step up and everybody feels that way.

[19:04] I mean that everybody feels that way.

[19:06] I just saw a Star Wars premium game is brand new like $1,000 off more than that like $8,400

[19:12] right away in Unboxed Game losing $1,000.

[19:15] So for all you guys who just bought Star Wars premium congratulations.

[19:20] In less than two weeks you lost $1,000.

[19:22] This is how it is now.

[19:23] These games are just rolling out and they're already hugely depreciating.

[19:28] I think the community is over it.

[19:30] I think Stern needs a wake up call and I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.

[19:36] I think the pressure on them is insane and I think they bit off more than they can chew.

[19:41] And I don't know how they start to behave again like a boutique company that's hungry.

[19:46] Because they really are acting like the humongous company that just wants to make volume product.

[19:51] Get it into Costco and turn its back on collectors and this is where we're at.

[19:56] This is where we're at.

[19:57] Who over there at Stern do you think is giving them ideas about how to win back collectors?

[20:02] You think the new CMO is? Still hasn't said hi.

[20:06] He was at Expo. Was he even part of the panel discussion?

[20:09] You know what I'm saying? Like all these people, they don't have anyone listening to them.

[20:13] They're not even trying to get our attention.

[20:16] They simply think they can make stuff like Star Wars and we're going to buy it.

[20:19] It's over. It's absolutely over and I love it.

[20:22] I love that each and every one of you is over it.

[20:25] I can see it in everyone's responses.

[20:27] Nobody is excited to run anymore and buy a Stern new inbox.

[20:32] You're excited for Winchester. You're excited for your Harry Potter.

[20:36] You're excited for Beetlejuice.

[20:38] Everything else has got you way more excited and it's awesome.

[20:42] And it's only going to force Stern to get better.

[20:44] This is why competition is a good thing.

[20:46] And I'm rooting for everybody to step up because when you step up, everything's going to get better.

[20:51] Every product will get better.

[20:53] If we stop buying the mediocre crap, everyone's going to have to get better.

[20:57] Everyone's going to have to improve what they put into the market.

[21:01] Everybody happy Tuesday. More to come.

[21:03] I can't wait to see more gameplay on Winchester.

[21:06] I can't wait to see if the game delivers on the extraordinary hype.

[21:11] It has coming out of Pinball Expo.

[21:13] We shall see. And you know, Canada, I'm always going to call it as I see it.

[21:18] I think this game is still very much a mystery.

[21:21] I think nobody knows now if it's going to go down as a great game, a decent game, or a masterpiece.

[21:28] So we shall see. Everybody be good. We'll talk to you soon.

[21:48] Oh, I'm blessed to say, get your booty on the board tonight. Make my day.

[21:54] Oh, I'm blessed to say, get your booty on the board tonight. Make my day.
