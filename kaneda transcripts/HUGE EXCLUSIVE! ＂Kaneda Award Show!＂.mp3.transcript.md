[00:00] It started with the Twippies, and then we had the Pimball Industry Awards.

[00:10] But I heard loud and clear from everyone out there in the Pimball world that we weren't

[00:15] going deep enough into this hobby.

[00:18] This is more important than politics.

[00:20] This is more important than motion pictures.

[00:23] This is way more important than the music industry.

[00:26] We need to recognize the finest and the greatest in Pimball, so I am here today to officially

[00:33] announce the third Pimball award show, posted by yours truly, Canada.

[00:39] This Pimball award show is actually going to dive one layer deeper into this incredible

[00:43] hobby.

[00:45] We are going to recognize areas of Pimball that are often overlooked, but often the most

[00:49] important elements in Pimball machines.

[00:53] Voting will take place solely by me.

[00:56] An individual who hasn't owned barely any machines.

[01:00] I might not even pronounce half of the Pimball words correctly, and I sure as hell haven't

[01:05] played half of the games that came out in 2020.

[01:09] So who is more qualified to bring you the ultimate in Pimball award shows?

[01:15] I'm not sure when this show is going to take place, but chances are it might happen

[01:19] before the other two shows, because that's how we do things around here.

[01:23] You might be asking yourself, what are the categories for the Canada awards of Pimball

[01:28] Excellence voted on by one man who hasn't played half of the games in 2020?

[01:33] Well, I'm here to tell you, these are the categories that we are going to recognize,

[01:38] and we're not going to be like the other shows, treading over the same path, recognizing

[01:43] greatest Pimball machine of the year, greatest designer, greatest artwork on the cabinet,

[01:48] on the play field underneath the cabinet.

[01:50] No, we're not going to go down that road.

[01:53] We are going to call out the things that truly matter in Pimball.

[01:56] For example, here are the categories we will be recognizing in this third and greatest

[02:02] Pimball award show.

[02:03] The first category we're going to recognize is the most satisfying plunge in Pimball,

[02:08] and we're going to look at every element of that plunge.

[02:11] We're going to look at the spring, the shooter rod, how the ball whips around, how the

[02:16] ball makes you go WE when you start a game.

[02:19] We can't wait to recognize the most satisfying plunge.

[02:23] The second category is going to be the smoothest ramp.

[02:26] We hear it all the time, the ramps are so smooth, it's so satisfying to hit those ramps.

[02:32] So which ramp did it this year?

[02:34] Which one made that ball whip around and go up and made your brains say yes?

[02:39] That's a great Pimball ramp.

[02:42] The third category is one of the most overlooked categories in all of Pimball, and without this,

[02:48] you would never be able to even enjoy a single Pimball game.

[02:52] We are going to recognize the most creative start button in Pimball.

[02:58] The placement of the start button does it say something other than start?

[03:03] Is there a cute phrase on that start button?

[03:06] How often does it flash?

[03:07] What color is it?

[03:08] The criteria we'll look at all of these factors when we determine who has the most creative

[03:14] start button in a Pimball machine.

[03:17] What's the greatest sling action in a Pimball game?

[03:20] You know that time when the ball gets down there and it's going back and forth between

[03:23] the sling shots and you get all excited and you get all nervous that it might shoot it

[03:27] into the out lane.

[03:29] Well, which Pimball machine has the greatest sling action?

[03:32] We're going to find out in the Canadian Awards.

[03:35] The next category is the most unique use of pop bumpers.

[03:39] You know those three things that Stern puts in the same place in every game?

[03:44] Why can't they put them somewhere else?

[03:46] Why do we always have to have three together?

[03:48] Maybe Rick and Morty will take it this year with one pop bumper in the sling shot area.

[03:53] And here's a category we've never seen recognize and yet this is something that is so important

[03:57] in Pimball.

[03:59] Who has the best born on date sticker that's on the back of the back box?

[04:03] You know that sticker that tells you your game was made just a few weeks ago, wasn't

[04:08] given enough time to cure, the play field has issues and the mechs are falling apart

[04:12] but it makes you feel good.

[04:14] Knowing that your game was built in December, you're born on date, it's the birth certificate

[04:19] of every Pimball machine.

[04:22] Who's got the nicest font?

[04:23] Where's the location on that back box area?

[04:26] We're going to find out.

[04:27] Here's one for you operators out there who's got the nicest coin box in Pimball.

[04:32] Why does every coin box have to be the same?

[04:35] We're going to look at the coin box itself.

[04:37] Is it silver?

[04:38] Is it chrome?

[04:39] Is it got a black tray underneath it?

[04:41] What's the pin like that keeps that coin box in place?

[04:45] This is where the money falls.

[04:47] This is where the money is made.

[04:48] That moment, that joyous moment where operators open up the game and see that there's no

[04:53] quarters in there because no one uses coins anymore to play Pimball.

[04:57] They use dollar bill acceptors so let's keep putting coin boxes in every single game.

[05:03] That's really smart.

[05:05] It's not the 1990s anymore.

[05:08] And let's face it, this next category has never been recognized.

[05:12] Your Pimball machines wouldn't even be able to stand on their four feet without the next

[05:17] thing we're going to recognize.

[05:19] And you know what it is right now.

[05:21] And for some reason, these things are never really focused on.

[05:25] And for some reason, these things are often overlooked but they are the most important

[05:28] thing when your Pimball machine ships.

[05:31] If these are not in the box, you are not playing Pimball.

[05:34] You guessed it ladies and gentlemen, only on the most important and third most irrelevant

[05:39] Pimball awards show are we going to recognize the importance of the most beautiful leg bolts.

[05:46] Who ships with the eight most beautiful leg bolts?

[05:49] They could be any color.

[05:50] How quickly do they screw in?

[05:52] Oh my god, I can't wait to recognize the most beautiful leg bolts in a Pimball machine.

[05:57] Number nine, when you lift that game up, who's got the nicest wiring harness?

[06:03] How did they make all those wires travel from north to south?

[06:07] Did they use zip ties?

[06:08] Did they use hot glue guns?

[06:10] How is that wiring harness in the game?

[06:12] We're going to look at that.

[06:14] We're going to study the game when it's flipped up and it's not even playing because we need

[06:18] to recognize this stuff.

[06:19] There needs to be more award shows in Pimball.

[06:22] We have to.

[06:23] We have to.

[06:25] What will this industry become if we don't positively cheerlead every single thing multiple

[06:31] times over and over again?

[06:34] And the Pimball award show we're also going to recognize those of you out there in the

[06:37] Pimball media.

[06:39] And it shouldn't be subjective.

[06:41] It really should not be subjective.

[06:43] So we've determined two categories that we are going to recognize that will be the most

[06:48] objective way to recognize excellence in the Pimball media.

[06:54] And for Pimball podcasting, it's really simple.

[06:57] We are going to give an award for the longest Pimball podcast.

[07:01] Why does it have to end?

[07:03] Who said a show should end after like 30 minutes or an hour or two hours or three hours?

[07:08] And you're hearing it first on Canadian Pimball podcast.

[07:11] This award will be a cash prize.

[07:14] One hundred dollars to the Pimball podcast that goes the longest anytime between now and

[07:22] the award show.

[07:23] So don't stop at two hours or three hours.

[07:26] Don't cut that interview short.

[07:28] We can hear from Roger Sharp again.

[07:30] He can keep on going.

[07:31] You can get three or four hours at least out of that man.

[07:36] So let's see who can go the longest.

[07:39] And let's also recognize the shortest Pimball podcast.

[07:42] It could just be a burp.

[07:43] It could be over in a few seconds.

[07:45] But can you deliver the Pimball news quickest?

[07:48] So it's a sprint and it's a marathon.

[07:52] Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a lot of criticism that this show is not positive

[07:56] enough.

[07:57] That we are not expanding Pimball to the next generation of kids who could give two

[08:01] craps about this hobby.

[08:04] Kids who just want to look at cell phones and play Xboxes.

[08:07] Kids who if you told them kids who can barely afford college tuition, they really need to

[08:12] learn about the importance of buying Pimball machines.

[08:16] What greater motivation is it for the youth of tomorrow than to dangle in front of them

[08:21] a $9,000 unnecessary toy as a symbol of success in life.

[08:27] And the more Pimball machines you can put in your house, the greater you are as an individual.

[08:32] That is the truth.

[08:34] And you're hearing it here first.

[08:36] And we should not even stop at three award shows.

[08:39] We should have at least 17 in this hobby.

[08:42] We need to recognize everybody.

[08:44] We will not stop until every single person in the Pimball industry has been awarded some

[08:51] recognition of excellence because it is excellent because it's really important that we don't

[08:57] leave out counts this year.

[08:59] There has to be something that we can do.

[09:02] Strongest Pimball Playfield.

[09:04] It's about time we recognize this game.

[09:07] So tune in ladies and gentlemen to the only Pimball award show voted on by one man who

[09:12] hasn't played half of the games this year who doesn't have any sponsors who doesn't

[09:17] have anyone to blast email out begging for votes for a silly piece of plastic.

[09:22] We are here.

[09:23] It is going to be the greatest evening in the history of Pimball with the lowest production

[09:29] value imaginable.

[09:31] Thank you so much for your time and for your consideration as you welcome the third greatest

[09:37] least relevant Pimball award show of all time.

[09:40] Thank you and have a great day.
