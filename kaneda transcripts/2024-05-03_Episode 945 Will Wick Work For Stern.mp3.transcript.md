[00:00] Alright, so John Wick, the man, the hitman, the murder dog, the Avenger, that is the most

[00:28] badass Keanu Reeves film we've seen since The Matrix. It is now official. Stern Pinball

[00:36] is making John Wick. And on this episode of Canadian Pinball Podcast, I want to tell

[00:41] you right now, the baby is not here. So I'm going to be doing episodes until the baby

[00:46] arrives. But I just want to talk to you about this theme. Let's stay on this theme on this

[00:52] episode and ask ourselves one simple question. Will John Wick be a successful pinball machine?

[01:02] Is this a theme that is going to work well in the current landscape of pinball? Where

[01:08] limited edition machines are $13,000? Where Jersey Jack won $15,000 for an Elton John

[01:17] game? John Wick, the hitman, the badass movies. John Wick, a franchise that has grossed over

[01:26] a billion dollars at the box office. Will this be a theme that the pinball buying demographic

[01:33] will warm up to and will support? And also remember this, this game is going to be a

[01:39] brand new designer that we've never heard of, right? Following a Keith Elwyn game in

[01:46] Jaws. Now, let's talk about it. All right. So first and foremost, how are we going to dissect

[01:51] this? We're not going to see the game until Tuesday. But let's just talk about the theme,

[01:57] the theme of John Wick. Now look, if you've seen these movies and you're a man that grew up

[02:05] in the 80s and the 90s, and you grew up on action movies, and you love the Matrix, and you love

[02:11] Schwarzenegger, and you love John Woo films like The Killer, like this is John Wick. It's a movie in

[02:19] which a guy is a retired hitman and they kill his dog. And it's like the Russian mafia. And he hides

[02:28] his weaponry under the concrete floor of his garage. And if I'm spoiling anything right now,

[02:37] you're not going to buy this game. This movie's been out for so many years that the statue of

[02:43] limitations on spoiling the theme of John Wick is well past due. The movies are super awesome.

[02:51] They're super fun. They are literally like John Woo meets the Matrix meets Keanu Reeves meets a guy

[03:00] that can only kill you with a headshot. And they're a lot of fun. They're high energy. They're shot in

[03:07] a way that's really cool. And I just don't know. See, here's my thing about John Wick as a theme.

[03:15] Is this a theme that most of you have been waiting for? I don't think so. But that being said,

[03:22] think about the pinball landscape right now, where most of the pinball buying demographic

[03:29] is men 40 to 60. And you're hitting them right now, just right now in the pinball world.

[03:37] You're hitting them with Jaws, which is a slow movie from the 1970s about a shark that eats a few

[03:47] people. You're hitting people with looney tunes. You're hitting people with Texas chainsaw massacre,

[03:54] which really only appeals to the people making the game. You're hitting people with the Princess

[04:01] Bride. You're hitting people with Pulp Fiction, but not really that game doesn't have any clips from

[04:07] the movies. It doesn't have any of the scenes from the movies coming at you. It's more just like call

[04:15] outs and only five songs. It's not really like a modern pinball game where you're playing through

[04:21] the Pulp Fiction movie and then you're coming at us with stuff like Abba. You're coming at us with

[04:28] stuff like what else is right now new in the pinball world, Bario's barbecue challenge. You're

[04:34] coming at us with Ninja Clips. You're coming at us with all these other games, Elemental.

[04:41] Seriously, when you think about it, it's like, thank you, Stern Pinball, for bringing out a game

[04:47] that's geared towards men that like action movies. Now, will John Wick work first Stern

[04:55] Pinball? Will this game be enough to get people to plop down money? That's what I'm going to talk

[05:02] about on this short episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast. Billion dollar franchise, four movies.

[05:09] There's going to be a fifth movie. It's one of the only franchises where the sequels have all

[05:17] individually earned more money than the original movie. The original movie made like 80 million at

[05:25] the box office and the last John Wick movie alone globally made over 400 million dollars. Now,

[05:34] here's the thing. I still don't think John Wick though has enough nostalgia, like has enough of a

[05:42] fan base, has enough of like a community around this property. Sure, I've seen every movie. I've

[05:50] enjoyed them. They're fun. But John Wick hasn't made its way into our souls. It hasn't made its way

[05:59] into our veins. It's not the kind of movie that you dream about that you can't wait to watch again.

[06:07] It's the kind of movie where like maybe you've seen it once and that's it. You're not going to see

[06:14] each of them like multiple times. And even though it appeals more to like modern men than Elton John,

[06:22] I'm just not sure that Stern Pinball will be successful in selling a John Wick game

[06:31] if they're going to make a thousand Ellie's at $13,000 a pop and they want people to buy

[06:37] premiums for like $9,500. That's what has me concerned about John Wick. And I know we're going

[06:45] to see a lot about this game on Tuesday. We're going to see who's designing it, what mechs are in it,

[06:51] and the music in the trailer. When I heard the music, right, like that techno music and like the

[06:57] dark city, I was like, aw man, like Stern Pinball is the last company that could really do justice

[07:06] to music like this, to a theme like this, because this should have been made. I feel like Jersey

[07:13] Jack Pinball has the only light show that would do this sort of techno rave hitman music justice.

[07:21] It's not going to work with Stern Pinball. And I think what's going to happen is this, and this is

[07:26] just Canadian's prediction. I think this game is going to come out. I don't think it's going to have

[07:31] a lot of wow mechanisms in it. And I also just don't think people are going to like be won over

[07:38] by a Stern John Wick game for this much money. And I think this is going to be the ultimate test

[07:45] of Stern Pinball is because I feel like when I think about it, this is going to be their next

[07:51] venom. It's not going to be bad. Trust me, it's not going to be bad. It's going to be fun like every

[07:57] Stern machine. But I just don't think there's going to be enough there. And that's my thing is like

[08:03] now that these games are so expensive, and now that everybody's looking at each of these games,

[08:09] like I need to move a game out of my game room. If I'm to bring this game into my game room,

[08:16] I don't think John Wick has it. I don't think John Wick as a theme is going to make you want to

[08:22] remove a game from your game room. I also don't think John Wick is a game that's going to crush

[08:27] it on location. I just think this is like a B level theme for Stern. I feel like this is going to be

[08:34] another venom pinball machine. And now that there's rumors that there's going to be a Pokemon game,

[08:41] and there's going to be another Metallica game, I think this is going to be a very, very short

[08:49] live Stern machine. I think they're going to struggle to sell 1000 LEs if they make 1000 of

[08:56] them, especially at $13,000. And I mean this when I say it, I think this could be the hardest selling

[09:04] game Stern has had to sell in a really long time. I don't think this is the kind of theme that is

[09:13] going to make people like have to have it. I think people are going to be curious about it.

[09:18] I think we're going to play it on location. But I don't think John Wick is the game people really

[09:25] want right now. And that's just my two cents. And I just want to say this right now. I don't think

[09:31] John Wick is going to be a super successful game for Stern. I just don't think there's enough nostalgia.

[09:38] I just don't think there's enough, right? And John Wick as a property, it just doesn't check the boxes

[09:45] people want checked for pinball. And I think there's just a lot more coming around the corner

[09:52] that is going to make people want to wait for that. I still think we're going to get a matrix

[09:56] pinball machine. We're going to get a Harry Potter pinball machine. We're going to get back to the

[10:02] future. And again, as much as I love these movies, just because I love a movie doesn't mean it's right

[10:09] for pinball. And that's the other part is as I think about John Wick pinball, it's not the kind

[10:15] of theme that screams out like world under glass, like these would be the mechanisms, these would

[10:24] be the things I'd want to see in a John Wick game. And that's the thing. And I think what Stern's

[10:31] going to do, I think they're going to make a game with a lot of flow. I think they're going to make

[10:37] a game with a lot of software. But I don't think you're going to see a game with a lot of mechanical

[10:42] wow in it. I just don't. And we're probably going to get like a cheap Mustang. We're going to get a

[10:49] cheap way to like load balls into the chamber of the gun. We're probably not going to get any lower

[10:57] or upper play fields in this game. We're going to get a cheap sculpt or plastic of the continental.

[11:04] And that's the thing about John Wick pinball is like to me, when I think about the John Wick

[11:10] movies, it's all about Keanu Reeves going berserk chasing down this like Russian,

[11:16] Arabian mafia shooting a hundred guys in the head with his gun. How do you recreate that in

[11:24] pinball format? And I just don't think it's going to work. So this is going to be a little bit of a

[11:30] short episode of Canadian pinball podcast. I'm waiting for the baby to come. But this is just my

[11:36] prediction. John Wick pinball from Stern will be the next venom in the lineup of Stern games. You

[11:45] are not going to see the Ellie sell out instantly. You're not going to see people clamoring for this

[11:51] game. And I haven't even seen it yet. But I just know what we want. And I know what's around the

[11:58] corner. And John Wick, albeit a curious theme, a contemporary theme in pinball, it's just not

[12:06] going to be a game that's going to separate you from 13,000 or $10,000. And everybody's just going

[12:14] to wait and see on this title. Because we all know if Stern makes 1000 John Wick, Ellie's at

[12:21] 13,000 a pop. They're all going to be worth like $9,000 in just like eight months. Everybody wait

[12:29] and see. Canada loves you. John Wick. I can't wait to see what they do. But it's just going to be

[12:36] the next venom from Stern. Canada out.
