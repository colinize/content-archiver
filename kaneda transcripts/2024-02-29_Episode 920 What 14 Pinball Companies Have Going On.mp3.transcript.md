[00:00] Open fire, I'm a burning horse, I've never been here long, Motherfell's is a dope, a kiss or a proud, I can't survive on my own.

[00:13] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:30] Thanks for being a club member, what's going on?

[00:32] Let's do what we always do best, let's go around the horn and let's talk about everything

[00:37] happening in the pinball industry with each of these companies.

[00:40] Is it going to be a March Madness like last year?

[00:43] I do not think so.

[00:44] I think we're going to get the game that we laugh at more than any other game ever.

[00:48] Come March 15th at 7 o'clock at night at Texas Pinball Festival, we're going to talk about

[00:53] that, but let's just go down the horn.

[00:56] Let's start with Stern Pinball.

[00:57] So Stern Pinball, Jaws LE is still somewhat delayed over there at Stern.

[01:02] Now look, I don't think this is some conspiracy, I don't think Stern doesn't want you to get

[01:07] your $13,000 overpriced Jaws machine, trust me.

[01:12] They want to make sure you get that machine as quickly as possible, they don't want anyone

[01:17] to cancel orders on those LE machines, that's why they make the LEs right after the pros.

[01:23] And obviously if there's a delay, it's because it's something cosmetic that's different from

[01:29] the premium.

[01:30] It's not going to be a playfield part, it's going to be something cosmetic they're waiting

[01:34] on, the rumor is it's those foil decals on the side of the cabinet.

[01:39] So Jaws is going out the door, can I ask a question for all you Jaws owners?

[01:44] What's the most iconic scene in the movie?

[01:46] The shark fin is coming at you.

[01:48] You hear dun-un, dun-un, dun-un, right?

[01:51] The suspense, the anxiety as Jaws is coming towards you.

[01:56] Does that even happen in the game?

[01:58] I mean seriously, I mean everyone's talking about this and about that and is the single

[02:02] most iconic scene in Jaws even translated into the pinball experience?

[02:08] I don't know, I haven't seen anything, I haven't played that much of this game but

[02:12] let me know if that's actually something that happens in the game.

[02:15] And also it's funny how the shark fin, did you notice this?

[02:18] I mean everyone's been making fun of this but it only goes in one direction, it's only

[02:22] going from left to right and then the shark apparently swims backwards to start over again.

[02:28] Stern pinball really crushing it with their mechanisms people.

[02:31] Alright, so here's the other thing about Stern pinball.

[02:34] It's like what game is going to be next?

[02:35] So like a week ago, I was telling everybody it's going to be Indiana Jones and that was

[02:40] one of the rumored games from like last year that John Borg was working on Indiana Jones.

[02:45] Now I'm hearing that Indiana Jones was like scraped.

[02:49] I'm hearing that Indiana Jones was shelved, that Stern's not going to make an Indiana

[02:53] Jones pinball machine.

[02:54] I really don't know who to believe on this one but if Dial of Destiny was a huge flop

[02:59] and it was a flop and it was a failure, do you really think Stern pinball is going to

[03:03] come out with a Dial of Destiny pinball machine?

[03:07] I can't see it happening and that begs the question then, if Indiana Jones is not next,

[03:12] then what is next from Stern pinball?

[03:15] The other rumor I'm hearing is this, that the next two Stern machines are pretty underwhelming

[03:20] and mediocre.

[03:21] And man, it's going to get really interesting if Stern pinball has two mediocre games in

[03:26] a row with that huge factory and needing to make like 800 games a week.

[03:31] So let's just talk about the rumors, right?

[03:33] We've got Indiana Jones which I am hearing is now not going to happen and then we've

[03:37] got John Wick.

[03:39] So who's doing John Wick?

[03:41] Now another rumor I heard is John Wick might be a George Gomez game because they shelved

[03:46] what John Borg was working on.

[03:48] George Gomez might step in and make John Wick.

[03:51] I can see John Wick being either a John Borg game or a George Gomez game and then we're

[03:57] going to get the next game hopefully from Jack Danger.

[04:00] The rumor is that he's working on Pokemon.

[04:03] Is it going to be Pokemon?

[04:05] Is it going to be He-Man Masters of the Universe?

[04:08] I think Pokemon's the one that has the most attention but maybe Jack Danger's doing John

[04:13] Wick.

[04:14] I mean, I really don't feel like Stern has a juggernaut like Pokemon.

[04:17] I just don't feel it.

[04:19] I think the order might go Jaws, John Wick and then Metallica and I think that might

[04:25] be it for the year from Stern Pinball.

[04:27] And I think that's why people are like, you know, it's not going to be two juggernauts

[04:31] in a row.

[04:33] It's going to be two mediocre things.

[04:35] And if Metallica is just new artwork on Spike 3 and not an entirely new game, is that really

[04:42] going to excite people or just piss off the 6,000 people that already have a Metallica

[04:47] machine?

[04:48] And what do we really think Spike 3 is going to be?

[04:51] Do we think Spike 3 is going to make a Stern as nice as a Jersey Jack?

[04:55] Like they're going to add modern lighting and all this modern stuff?

[04:58] I really don't.

[04:59] I think Spike 3 is going to be all about internet connectivity and I think Stern Pinball

[05:04] is waiting until they flip the switch and have like hundreds of thousands of machines

[05:09] out there with internet connected and then guess what's going to happen?

[05:13] They're going to want each and every one of you to do micro transactions to get new modes

[05:17] in your game.

[05:18] I mean, it is absolutely coming people.

[05:20] You are going to start spending $5 more a month, $10 more a month to unlock the game.

[05:26] All right, so that's what's happening at Stern Pinball.

[05:29] What's over at Jersey Jack?

[05:30] So Jersey Jack, the big story now at Jersey Jack is really when are they going to run

[05:35] the next game?

[05:36] Elton John is a great shooting game.

[05:38] The more people play it, the more they're going to like it.

[05:41] I'm seeing more and more of the discussion around Elton John though, be about the fact

[05:45] that it's really not a mode based game.

[05:48] You don't really feel like you're journeying through the storyline of Elton John, right?

[05:53] It's so radically different than Foo Fighters in which you feel like you're going from city

[05:58] to city and there's all these missions and minor quests.

[06:01] I don't think people are feeling that way when they play Elton John.

[06:05] Now, that being said, it is easily the best shooting game in Jersey Jack's lineup.

[06:10] That being said, it's finally a Jersey Jack game in which you have to work for your multi-balls

[06:14] and they're very rewarding to get to, but it can get a little bit repetitive.

[06:19] Krakatal Rock, multi-ball over and over again.

[06:22] The Rocket Man multi-ball is amazing.

[06:24] I don't think seeing that multi-ball start will ever get old whenever you play Elton

[06:29] John.

[06:30] I think a lot of you are where I'm at.

[06:33] You would happily buy this game if you can knock $3,000 to $4,000 off the price and I

[06:39] think now the conversation becomes what's next from Jersey Jack and let's talk about

[06:44] that real quick.

[06:45] The two big rumors are Matrix and Harry Potter.

[06:48] Now we know we're going to get Mark Siden's first game and everybody is thinking it might

[06:53] be the Matrix and that would put Eric Minier onto Harry Potter, which gets really exciting.

[06:59] I'm also hearing another rumor that it might be based on the Harry Potter movies.

[07:04] Now here's the big issue for Jersey Jack moving forward.

[07:07] If they do another movie pin and it doesn't have the voices and the video clips synced

[07:13] up, Jerry Overt Multimorph got everything in the Princess Bride and I don't think people

[07:18] are going to be paying these premium prices for Jersey Jack machines if they don't sync

[07:23] up the assets in the right way.

[07:25] And so if they make either of these games and they're both based on the movies of Harry

[07:29] Potter and the Matrix, if they don't do them right, I think Jersey Jack, you know, it's

[07:35] just so disappointing and let's face it, we haven't seen them do the assets right since

[07:39] Guns N' Roses.

[07:41] They did not do it right with Toy Story.

[07:43] I guess Godfather was kind of right.

[07:45] I think those clips synced up and it's a really old movie.

[07:48] They kind of did Godfather right where Godfather messed up is when they started putting the

[07:52] company staff into the game itself.

[07:55] That was the biggest bonehead it moved ever.

[07:58] And a moment of silence for Godfather LE owners out there, my friend Derek bought his for 12

[08:03] grand.

[08:04] I think the best offer he has on the table for the game is like 6,500 or 5,500.

[08:11] You cannot sell a Godfather LE for anything.

[08:15] So when will we see Jersey Jack's next game?

[08:17] I don't think we're going to see it before June or July.

[08:20] I think we got a lot of time where this company is going to make more Elton John Platinum's.

[08:25] I can't see them making a thousand Elton John CEs.

[08:28] I think they're going to make more like 500.

[08:30] I don't think they made a thousand Godfather CEs or Toy Story CEs.

[08:35] I just don't think there's a thousand out there.

[08:37] So that's the news over at Jersey Jack.

[08:39] Look, I'm really bullish about the future of Jersey Jack and I'm hearing it from everybody

[08:44] who's over there now.

[08:46] Now that Pat Lawler is gone, the vibe over at JJP is great and I've been saying it for

[08:52] years.

[08:53] That man was a dark cloud over the company.

[08:56] He was not a collaborator.

[08:58] He was not a nice man.

[08:59] And I don't know why anyone would defend him because he created a cantankerous culture

[09:04] over at Jersey Jack.

[09:06] And I'm happy he's gone and so should you.

[09:08] He never delivered for Jack and that's the bottom line.

[09:11] That's the reason why Jack had to go get money and had to get bailed out because he

[09:16] took forever to get stuff done and Jack couldn't get games to market fast enough.

[09:21] Alright, what else is on Canadian's list?

[09:23] Let's start with Barrel's a fun here.

[09:24] So this company just pulled off what people are heralding as the greatest customer service

[09:30] in the history of Pimball.

[09:32] A gentleman with about 600 plays on his labyrinth noticed that the playfield chipped.

[09:38] So instead of telling him to put down mylar, Jersey Jack would have sent him a sticker,

[09:43] Jersey Jack would have made him buy an unpopulated playfield for $500.

[09:49] This company told this gentleman, we will pick up your game for free, mail it back to

[09:55] us for free, fix your game with a new playfield, basically repopulating his game with a new

[10:02] playfield without a chip and mail it back to this gentleman for free.

[10:07] And even though this guy is like, well, you don't really have to do all of that.

[10:10] Like maybe I can meet you in the middle somewhere when we do a swap then.

[10:14] They were like, nope, we insist on doing it this way.

[10:18] And he got a nice letter from David Vaness.

[10:21] And I don't even know how to respond to this.

[10:23] Like I've never seen a Pimball company do customer service on this level.

[10:28] That's absolutely amazing.

[10:30] Now look, I also hope that Barrel's a fun does not have 1100 games where they might have

[10:34] chipped playfields because there's no way they could afford to do this for 1100 customers.

[10:39] Here's the thing though, like once you do something like this for one person, it can't

[10:44] just be a one time PR stunt.

[10:46] I really hope they don't have to do this that often, but it's a great sign of a new company

[10:51] doing things right.

[10:53] And isn't it refreshing a Pimball company coming out, not asking for your money to fund their

[10:58] operation, not making you give non refundable deposits for eight months and lying to your

[11:04] face about it, not telling you to pound sand when something happens with their playfields

[11:09] the way Jersey Jack did.

[11:10] I mean, this is how you do it.

[11:12] And once this company makes a theme that excites me, I can't wait to give my money to Barrel's

[11:18] a fund because I believe in companies that act like this and treat their customers like

[11:23] this.

[11:24] And we need to see more of this in Pimball.

[11:26] I guarantee you David Vaness is praying to the Pimball gods.

[11:29] He does not have to do this 1100 times.

[11:32] All right.

[11:33] Who else is on our list?

[11:34] It's a Lego gaming company.

[11:35] Pulp Fictions are making their way out the door.

[11:37] I am hearing Ellie's are going to be available sometime in June.

[11:41] Now they have to make a thousand Ellie's.

[11:43] And so, you know, I mean, how long is that going to take?

[11:46] The early reviews on this game are really good.

[11:49] My gosh, though, did you see when someone popped the hood on a Pulp Fiction?

[11:53] This thing has a board that's bigger than a skateboard.

[11:56] It's like a single ginormous board on this game, the size of like a boogie board.

[12:01] Like I was like, oh my gosh.

[12:03] I've never seen in my history of Pimball a single board set that is ginormous like

[12:09] that.

[12:10] And it's like, what happens if one light goes out?

[12:13] You have to repair that humongous thing and take that humongous thing out of the game.

[12:17] I think it's really weird.

[12:19] It's engineered that way, you know, but the good news is this is that Chicago gaming

[12:23] company stands behind their products.

[12:26] And if anything happens with a board, they will repair it for you.

[12:30] Still a mixed bag on whether or not the callouts sound good or not.

[12:34] I think they're just lifted right from the movie.

[12:37] And I think all of us have to go back and watch Pulp Fiction, hear how the callouts

[12:41] are in the film, and I bet they're not super clear.

[12:45] I bet they're not super clean.

[12:47] I bet they're a little bit scratchy.

[12:49] And I think that's what we're getting in the game itself.

[12:52] So I'm not worried about that.

[12:53] I think anyone who's in on an LE is still very happy because you bought a Pimball machine

[12:59] that was less than $10,000 and it's already gone up in value.

[13:04] And we're never going to see that again in the history of Pimball.

[13:07] All right, who else is next on our list?

[13:09] All right, American Pimball.

[13:11] This is who I was talking about.

[13:13] This company is going to be the laughing stock of the entire Pimball world.

[13:18] Saturday, March 15th at 7 o'clock at night at Texas Pimball Festival

[13:24] when David Fix gets up there with Maurice.

[13:29] And unveils to the world the secret sauce of American Pimball,

[13:35] which is going to be their barbecue themed Pimball machine.

[13:39] It's happening.

[13:40] It is a barbecue themed game and it's barrio designed.

[13:44] And when we see this, this could be the end of American Pimball.

[13:48] I think it could be.

[13:49] I think this is going to be a game that gets a worse reception than dialed in

[13:52] and games like Full Throttle.

[13:54] I think David Fix has no idea what he's doing.

[13:58] And I think this is the final decision that he's going to get to make at American Pimball.

[14:02] I think he knows it.

[14:04] And I think there's another reason why we're seeing social media blitz nonstop with Galactic Tank Force.

[14:10] Have you seen like all the blitzing of social media happening around like Galactic Tank Force launch parties and events

[14:18] and cosplay things going on with the actress from the game?

[14:22] None of this is going to help him sell more Galactic Tank Force games.

[14:25] And I don't care how much they scream from the rooftops about that game and this barbecue game.

[14:31] Trust me, Stick of Fork in American Pimball, 7 o'clock, March 15th, Saturday night at Texas Pimball Festival.

[14:39] I will be at my Jameson St. Patrick's Eve party.

[14:43] But trust me, you're going to want to hear my take on this game when I just go off.

[14:48] And I know I'm going to be going off on this game.

[14:50] There is no way this game is going to be great.

[14:53] There is no way this game is going to be what you want.

[14:55] There is no way this game is going to survive in a modern Pimball marketplace with the themes we have.

[15:01] It's game over fix and he has driven his company off the tracks into the ocean.

[15:06] He is basically making the worst decisions I've ever seen a Pimball leader make.

[15:11] Alright, that's American Pimball.

[15:13] Let's go on the Dutch Pimball over in the Netherlands.

[15:16] Not a lot of news in Dutchland.

[15:18] They've got the early achiever games are going out the door.

[15:21] I think Barry is done with them.

[15:23] And then it's Alice in Wonderland sometime in May, June.

[15:27] And then it should be back to the future at the end of the year.

[15:30] That's what's happening with Dutch.

[15:32] I think once they start making back to the future, they're going to make it for the rest of their lives.

[15:37] And I really hope it's amazing.

[15:39] I hope Alice in Wonderland is amazing.

[15:41] You know, and there's nothing else to really say.

[15:43] I think they're quietly getting it done.

[15:45] And I don't think anybody's nervous anymore about supporting Dutch Pimball.

[15:50] And I think the next chapter in Dutch Pimball begins this year.

[15:53] And I'm happy to see Barry crawl out of that gutter and get it done.

[15:57] I wish I could say the same about this next company, Haggis Pimball.

[16:02] Oh man, this company, there is no way anyone is going to be giving these guys money moving forward.

[16:08] I think they're screwed.

[16:09] I think their distributors are screwed.

[16:12] I saw Carrie Hardy put up a video and people are saying it was a softball video.

[16:17] Look, I don't blame Carrie Hardy.

[16:19] I don't blame Zach Many.

[16:21] I don't blame the distributors.

[16:22] I don't blame anybody but Damien.

[16:25] And he's blaming COVID.

[16:26] But the bottom line is this.

[16:28] He's been misleading people now for two years.

[16:31] And I don't care what anybody says.

[16:33] When Damien is telling people, if you pay in full, you'll have your game in eight weeks.

[16:39] He's flat out lying to people.

[16:42] He knows that's not possible.

[16:44] When he asked people to pay in full for Centaur in January, people,

[16:48] last month he asked people to pay in full for January.

[16:52] When he knew he needed to recapitalize, he's lying to you.

[16:56] He knows he can't survive unless you help him recapitalize.

[17:01] It is not going to work.

[17:03] I think American Pimball and I think Haggis Pimball are going to be done in 2024.

[17:09] And I would be pleasantly surprised if they both survived.

[17:12] The one that has a much easier time surviving is American Pimball.

[17:16] Because Mukesh is financing this company with the money from AIMtron.

[17:20] Damien doesn't have that annuity.

[17:23] He doesn't have a big backer.

[17:24] He doesn't have an abyss family marching in and saving his ass.

[17:28] The thing is this, no one's going to.

[17:30] Because he doesn't have a product people want.

[17:32] He doesn't have a product thousands of people want like Jersey Jack did.

[17:36] He doesn't.

[17:37] He's got a product where he's struggling to sell a few hundred units.

[17:41] And because of that, no big whale rich man is going to march in there and save his ass.

[17:46] It's not going to happen because he's not making any money.

[17:49] Like if you were to march in to Haggis and ask to see the books, you're seeing nothing but red.

[17:54] I think they're done.

[17:55] All right, home pin number eight.

[17:57] I don't even know how to talk about home pin.

[17:59] I don't even know if Spinal Tap's going out.

[18:01] I'm not going to waste any airtime on these guys.

[18:03] If you ordered a Spinal Tap, congratulations.

[18:06] You got a really rare pin that nobody else wants.

[18:09] All right, let's go on to Multimorphic, the Princess Bride.

[18:13] I think they're going to have a good showing at TPF.

[18:16] I think the stream the other day was fun to see the game.

[18:19] It was fun to see them get all the assets for the Princess Bride.

[18:22] The game looks really fun to play.

[18:24] It's just expensive.

[18:25] I could see everyone who owns a Multimorphic buying the kit.

[18:29] I just can't see a lot of new people like opening up their wallets for like 12 to $14,000 basically

[18:36] to get a full game of the Princess Bride.

[18:38] I don't see it happening.

[18:40] I just think there's too much out there and everything is so expensive.

[18:44] And I think you're curious.

[18:45] I think you'll play it.

[18:47] I don't know.

[18:47] I think if Jerry gets a few more games people really want, then people might make the plunge.

[18:52] But right now, he doesn't have enough amazing games to get people to spend this much money on the entire platform.

[19:00] Number 10 on my list, we've got so many companies.

[19:03] We've got pinball adventures.

[19:04] I'm not even going to waste my time.

[19:06] I think they're going to be done this year.

[19:08] I'm pretty fatalistic as you can tell because we have 14 pinball companies people.

[19:13] 14.

[19:14] All right.

[19:15] After pinball adventures is pinball brothers.

[19:17] So look, these guys in Petretti Gaming, everybody is waiting for pinball brothers next game,

[19:23] which is going to be a music pin.

[19:25] I don't know what it is.

[19:26] I heard it might be scorpions.

[19:28] And who knows?

[19:29] But that game should be out soon because Queen was announced like well over a year ago.

[19:34] Like a year and a half ago.

[19:36] And so we've got that game coming out.

[19:38] And then we've got the Bally Williams Remake Games that are coming out by Petretti Gaming

[19:43] and the European Pinball Company, whatever it's called.

[19:46] And so when is that going to happen?

[19:48] I thought that was going to happen at TPF.

[19:50] I thought TPF was going to be the big reveal.

[19:52] They still might show up there and do a mystery reveal of their game.

[19:57] But I don't think they're going to announce it before TPF.

[20:00] Here's the good news.

[20:01] TPF isn't two weeks.

[20:02] So in just like two weeks, we are going to see whatever happens at Texas Pinball Festival.

[20:07] I do think the show is going to be a little underwhelming this year, even though I'm not

[20:11] going and I'm not bitter that I'm not going.

[20:14] But trust me, not having the Twippies there on that Saturday night is a huge mistake.

[20:19] And that was always the culminating event at Texas Pinball Festival.

[20:23] And you have nobody else to thank other than Colin and Will for destroying what brought

[20:29] hundreds of people joy and happiness at Texas Pinball Festival.

[20:33] And I'm happy I'm not going to be there this year.

[20:35] I'm going to have fun with my Jameson party.

[20:38] The only thing that makes me sad is I won't be doing my Perry Steakhouse happy hour.

[20:42] A lot of you who are listening right now, we used to hang out there.

[20:46] It was a lot of fun and I'm going to miss my fans.

[20:48] I mean, of course I'm going to miss you.

[20:50] I'm not going to miss seeing all those BS people that ruin TPF and they're going to be there.

[20:54] What else is going on in pinball?

[20:56] So spooky pinball.

[20:58] So spooky pinball.

[20:59] They've got looney tunes.

[21:00] They've got Texas Chainsaw going out the door.

[21:03] Games look great.

[21:04] Games look beautiful.

[21:06] They're getting it done.

[21:07] I'm seeing like more and more people buying both games at the same time.

[21:10] I don't know what that's about.

[21:12] No, no real questions here.

[21:13] You know, I think they're going to be making these games for the next six to eight months.

[21:17] And I guess the only question is, are they going to adjust looney tunes to make it more?

[21:21] Choose your own adventure and less about randomizing the mode.

[21:25] So we'll see if Luke listens to Canada and implements that into the game.

[21:30] But I'm not seeing any out of box issues.

[21:33] Everyone seems to be unboxing their games and having a good time.

[21:36] And that's what we want to see.

[21:38] You know, it's really easy.

[21:39] Like when people really execute well, there's not that much for me to say.

[21:43] So I'm really happy that most of these pinball companies have no idea what they're doing.

[21:47] It's going to keep me gamefully employed in this pinball podcasting space.

[21:51] All right, the last two companies, right?

[21:53] 13 and 14 on my list.

[21:54] Turner pinball is going to show up at Texas pinball with a new version of Ninja Eclipse.

[22:01] Yeah, I don't even know what to say, right?

[22:03] I don't know who this guy thinks is going to buy this game.

[22:06] It doesn't make any sense to me.

[22:08] And Chris Turner, if you're listening to this and you bought the Raza games and you have the right to Raza,

[22:14] stop wasting your time with Ninja Eclipse.

[22:18] Just make 200 Razas, charge 20 grand for them, and you'd sell everyone.

[22:25] Trust me, there's enough silly collectors that would want one if there was only 200 Razas in the world.

[22:31] And finally, out of France, I believe, Hexa Pinball with their Space Hunt game.

[22:38] It is shipping to customers.

[22:39] They are executing better than Haggis Pinball.

[22:42] You know, it's so sad.

[22:43] Haggis Pinball just got lapped by Hexa Pinball.

[22:47] And 99% of you are like, who the heck is Hexa Pinball?

[22:51] Exactly.

[22:52] Everybody, happy leap day again.

[22:55] Thank you for being a member of the Canadian Club.

[22:57] I know I made you wait a couple more days for a show.

[23:00] Work has just been crazy, but we're going to get way more episodes going.

[23:04] And there's going to be so much to talk about as we go into March and as TPF happens

[23:09] and these companies try to steal our attention at the show.

[23:12] I can't wait to talk about this barbecue game.

[23:16] Stick a fork in David Fix and Maurice, because they're done.

[23:19] Some people call me Maurice.
