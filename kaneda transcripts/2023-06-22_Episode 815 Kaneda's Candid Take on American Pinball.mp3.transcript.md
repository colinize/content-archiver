[00:00] I am a real American, Fight for the rights of every man, I am a real American, Fight for

[00:14] what's right, Fight for your life!

[00:18] Welcome everybody to day four of Canada's Can It Take on the pinball industry.

[00:29] This day is going to be really easy and it's going to be really strident and I'm going

[00:34] to start today with the letter grade of this company, American Pinball.

[00:38] What grade would you give American Pinball?

[00:41] A company that has made Houdini, Oktoberfest, Hot Wheels with no ramps, no jumps, no car

[00:50] washes, a company that made Legends of Valhalla, a game that nobody wanted when they could

[00:56] have it, like when Riot Games said who wants a hundred of these games, nobody wanted it

[01:03] and now they've made Galactic Tank Force.

[01:06] Dennis Nordman's game, he wanted to make a game based on a tank.

[01:11] I'm just going to say this right now, American Pinball is a company that is being run by

[01:16] people that have absolutely no clue what people want in pinball and that is why Canada's

[01:23] Pinball podcast is giving American Pinball a D grading D, right?

[01:30] Not a C, not a B, not an A, but a D. Is a D a failing grade?

[01:37] I think it is.

[01:38] I'm going to give this company a failing grade in pinball.

[01:42] This company has now been around for like six years and after six years and after all

[01:48] of their attempts to make a hit pinball machine, they still have not made a single game that

[01:56] a thousand people want.

[01:58] They have not sold a thousand of any game.

[02:01] They have not sold a thousand Houdinis.

[02:04] They have not sold a thousand Oktoberfest.

[02:07] They have not sold a thousand Legends of Ahala.

[02:10] They have not sold a thousand Hot Wheels or Galactic Tank Force.

[02:14] And now look, this whole company when it got taken over by David Fix, that was the moment.

[02:20] Remember when David Fix went on like the super awesome pinball podcast?

[02:26] He talked about Dennis Nordman, Zofia Ryan, they were going to come back with a game that

[02:32] was going to win everybody over.

[02:35] And then what happened?

[02:36] They came out with a game that had a major mechanism in the middle of the game that your

[02:42] entire objective as the player is to avoid the damn mechanism because it sends the ball

[02:48] straight down the middle.

[02:50] The ball jumps over the flippers.

[02:52] The freaking targets bend backwards and they didn't realize this until they released the

[02:58] game to the public.

[03:00] But I don't even want to talk about Galactic Tank Force because I think it's a Galactic

[03:03] Tank disaster.

[03:05] I just want to be completely candid about this company right now.

[03:08] American Pinball is a company that has never made a hit game.

[03:13] And the reason why they've never made a hit game, the reason why nothing they do has ever

[03:18] been successful is they have no creative visionary over there.

[03:23] They're being run by somebody who has no idea what pinball wants.

[03:27] And I'm not saying it's David Fix.

[03:29] They're being run and they're being financed by Mukesh who's a guy that makes chips for

[03:35] like the US government.

[03:37] Like AIMtron is a chip company.

[03:39] And if you go back and look at the history of this company, who ran American Pinball?

[03:43] It was like Deval.

[03:45] He's no longer there.

[03:46] And guess who Deval hired on day one?

[03:49] He hired John Papadook.

[03:52] Do people forget the fact that when John Papadook couldn't find another sucker and pinball to

[03:58] finance his operation, guess who's the one sucker he could find to finance his operation?

[04:05] He found American Pinball.

[04:07] And this company has never really recovered from that decision.

[04:11] They gave John Papadook over $300,000 to try to finish his Magic Girl Pinball machines.

[04:19] And for a lot of you people who have not been around this hobby for the last six years,

[04:24] you need to go back and look at the history of American Pinball and who was calling the

[04:30] shots because back then when Deval and all those people, it was like Scott Goldberg was

[04:36] involved with the company and John Papadook.

[04:39] And then they had like Matt Andrews make the artwork on the Houdini machine and they brought

[04:44] that whole play field to like Texas Pinball Festival.

[04:48] Do people forget the history of this company?

[04:52] And then they brought on Joe Ballser to fix John Papadook's Houdini.

[04:57] And then Joe Ballser made the game without even a white wood.

[05:01] And that's why Houdini shot so poorly because the shots were so damn tight because they

[05:07] didn't even test the game out.

[05:09] It's been a never ending sequence of bad decisions by American Pinball.

[05:16] The only good thing that American Pinball ever did was get Josh Kugler on board and

[05:22] Josh Kugler gave his heart to this company.

[05:26] He tried to code Houdini and Oktoberfest in a way that was exciting for users.

[05:31] And then what did American Pinball do to Josh Kugler?

[05:35] How did they pay back Josh Kugler?

[05:38] They let him go, right?

[05:40] They let him go.

[05:41] They let him go.

[05:42] He's no longer with American Pinball.

[05:44] And look, this company gets a D rating because everything they do, they seemingly do with

[05:52] absolutely no market research in mind.

[05:56] I mean, Galactic Tank Force is easily the worst move a pinball company has done in 2023.

[06:06] It's worse than The Godfather.

[06:09] It's worse than Spinal Tap.

[06:11] I mean, how many people out there are actually buying this game?

[06:16] I mean, it's one of these games where like certain people want to defend it.

[06:20] And people want to like make excuses for it.

[06:22] But how many people out there are actually plunking down 8000 to freaking 11000 for the

[06:30] LE and then take this $17,500 for the signature edition of this game?

[06:38] I mean, this game is an absolute joke.

[06:41] I'm going to be candid right now.

[06:43] I'm going to be very strident right now.

[06:45] This game is a joke.

[06:46] Does it shoot?

[06:47] All right.

[06:48] Sure.

[06:49] I'm terrible about the layout.

[06:52] But in 2023, American Pinball, do you really think there is anybody out there in the pinball

[06:59] buying world that wants this game?

[07:03] There is nothing about this game that is creative.

[07:07] There is nothing about this game that is interesting.

[07:10] There is nothing about this game that is unique.

[07:12] And this game is already dead on arrival.

[07:15] I've been speaking to distributors.

[07:18] Everybody is buying this game.

[07:20] They are not going to sell 250 LEs of this game.

[07:24] They are not going to sell the signature editions of this game.

[07:27] This game is going to not sell even close to 1000 units.

[07:32] And then what's going to happen?

[07:34] How are they going to spin it?

[07:35] What are they going to do?

[07:36] And the only thing you need to know about this game is this.

[07:39] Have you seen Dennis Nordman, the game's designer, even try to do anything to get anybody in

[07:47] pinball excited about this game?

[07:50] Where is he?

[07:51] Where's Steve Bowden?

[07:52] Is he doing anything?

[07:54] Is he streaming this game every single week trying to get people excited about this game?

[07:59] They are doing absolutely nothing.

[08:03] And the other thing, people, I'm just giving you the honest truth.

[08:07] The reason why American Pinball is not doing a factory tour and walking you through production

[08:14] of this game, it's a skeleton crew over there.

[08:18] So I hope all of you get your game, but the word on the street is there's not many people

[08:23] left over at American Pinball.

[08:26] I heard Steve Bowden is going in every day and watching YouTube videos.

[08:31] And Ryan McQuaid, I know he's really smug.

[08:34] He thinks he's somebody important in pinball, but I'm here to burst his bubble a little bit.

[08:39] Ryan McQuaid, you've done nothing, my friend.

[08:42] You made Sonic the Hedgehog Pinball.

[08:44] And American Pinball didn't even secure the license.

[08:48] And I don't have much faith that Ryan McQuaid's going to be the next dancer in the pinball

[08:52] designing space.

[08:54] Like what's he going to do?

[08:55] Like this game's not selling.

[08:57] You know what I heard is happening is David Fix is going around to different distributors

[09:01] and telling them like our next game is going to be based on a video game license.

[09:07] And you're going to want to get it on it and you need to order Galactic Tank Force if you

[09:11] want to get allocations of Ryan McQuaid's video game game.

[09:16] You know what?

[09:17] It's a day late and a dollar short.

[09:19] This company in my mind, if it did not have AIMTRON's money, this company would have gone

[09:26] out of business after Houdini.

[09:29] They would have gone out of business after Oktoberfest.

[09:34] They would have gone out of business after Hot Wheels.

[09:38] They would have gone out of business after Legends of the Hala and they absolutely would

[09:44] go out of business after freaking Galactic Tank Force.

[09:48] And if you remove the AIMTRON money, there is no way this company has ever made enough

[09:55] money off of its pinball games to support its future pinball games.

[10:01] And I'm going to be very strident right now.

[10:04] What is the point of a company like this?

[10:07] David Fix says a lot.

[10:09] He makes a lot of promises.

[10:12] He said something like, we're going to have four lines going at American Pinball.

[10:18] Four lines going.

[10:20] To make what?

[10:22] Who is ordering games where they need four different lines?

[10:26] You know what he also said?

[10:28] We're going to be able to implement into Hot Wheels additional items into the game like

[10:34] a ramp or a loop to loop or a jump.

[10:38] Remember when he said that?

[10:39] We might be able to actually add accessories that bring the Hot Wheels fun into the game.

[10:46] Has that happened?

[10:47] Absolutely not.

[10:49] He says all of this stuff.

[10:51] He said he got twice as many orders for Legends of the Hala standard edition as he did for

[10:58] Ellie.

[10:59] That never happened.

[11:00] And then the rumor was they got 2,000 orders of Galactic Tank Force, which also did not

[11:07] happen.

[11:08] And then David Fix recently said that Galactic Tank Force earns more on location than the

[11:15] Foo Fighters.

[11:16] I don't know what location that is.

[11:18] I don't know where he's getting this information, but I find it hard to believe that anything

[11:24] coming from American Pinball is getting more plays out in the world than the Foo Fighters

[11:30] or any Stern machine.

[11:32] This company is misguided.

[11:35] This company has no vision.

[11:37] This company has no direction that seemingly connects to anything that Pinball buying

[11:43] community wants.

[11:44] Now look, I don't want American Pinball to fail.

[11:48] I think David Fix is a good person personally.

[11:52] When it comes to the professional decisions that are being made over at American Pinball,

[11:58] how could anybody say this is what I would do to make a successful Pinball company?

[12:07] Nothing they've done to date has been successful.

[12:11] There are some fanboys that will argue that American Pinball makes a great product, that

[12:17] the quality is there.

[12:19] Who cares about quality if the freaking thing is not great?

[12:25] Right?

[12:26] It's built great, but nobody wants it.

[12:29] What good is that?

[12:30] You're going to build something to a high standard, but it's something that nobody really

[12:36] wants.

[12:38] This is where I'm at with American Pinball.

[12:40] You got us all excited about Galactic Tank Force.

[12:43] You went all in on this Dennis Nordman tank game, and then you did not deliver a product

[12:50] that people want.

[12:51] I look all over Pinside.

[12:53] You can get this game easily.

[12:55] Easily.

[12:56] They're not sold out.

[12:57] There's no way they're going to ever sell these games out, and we're not seeing many

[13:02] of them even get out the door to customers.

[13:05] Like what's up with American Pinball?

[13:08] What is up?

[13:09] Is this it?

[13:10] Is this the best you got?

[13:11] Because if Galactic Tank Force is the best you got, we don't want it.

[13:16] If Houdini is the best you got, or Oktoberfest, or Hot Wheels, or Legends of Ahala, the majority

[13:22] of the pinball buying public says we don't want it.

[13:26] This company would be more successful if they connect it with Rick over at Planetary Pinball

[13:32] and they should remake Big Bang Bar.

[13:35] They should remake Twilight Zone.

[13:37] Like why does an American Pinball just actually use its manufacturing ability and make games

[13:43] people actually want?

[13:45] But they're making games that nobody really wants, and there's absolutely no enthusiasm

[13:51] around this company.

[13:52] And out of all the pinball companies that have been out there over the last four to five

[13:57] to six years, American Pinball is the one single company that has really dropped the

[14:04] ball more than anybody because they have the money.

[14:09] They have the manufacturing know-how.

[14:11] They know how to make pinball machines.

[14:14] They know how to build a quality pinball machine.

[14:17] But they're building a quality pinball machine that nobody freaking wants.

[14:24] And so American Pinball, Canada's Pinball Podcast is giving you a D. I would not own

[14:30] any of your games.

[14:31] I don't want any of your games.

[14:33] I don't want any of your rhetoric.

[14:36] I don't want any of your excuses.

[14:39] I don't want any of your podcast interviews.

[14:42] What I want you to do, American Pinball, is actually make a game that people want.

[14:48] I want you to make a game where you can sell 2,000 units easily.

[14:54] You've never done it.

[14:55] You made decisions like Galactic Tank Force that show me that not only do you not have

[15:01] a George Gomez over there, but you absolutely have no idea what the pinball buying public

[15:07] wants.

[15:08] And I think the jig is up.

[15:10] I think there's no more excuses.

[15:12] I think Mukesh gave David Fix a mandate to make their company sing.

[15:19] And I think David Fix has failed to deliver on Mukesh's mandate to make a product people

[15:27] want.

[15:28] Where is the magic?

[15:30] I mean, think about this.

[15:31] They did this whole victory lap with Dennis Norman and Zofia Ryan.

[15:35] Look at Galactic Tank Force.

[15:37] There's nothing engineered in that game that's very interesting at all.

[15:42] There's more interesting mechs in Houdini and Oktoberfest.

[15:47] There's more stuff in both of those games than Galactic Tank Force.

[15:52] Same thing with Jersey Jack.

[15:53] It's another company where the games have not gotten better.

[15:58] And here's the thing.

[15:59] If you're going to continue to make pinball machines and you want people to spend money

[16:03] on your pinball machines and your pinball machines progressively keep getting worse and

[16:09] not better, then you are going to go out of business.

[16:14] And I think American Pinball is a company in which one day Mukesh is going to wake up

[16:21] and get tired of the pinball division.

[16:24] If the pinball division were left on its own accord and there was no ancillary money supporting

[16:31] the pinball division, this company would be out of business.

[16:36] And so Galactic Tank Force dead on arrival.

[16:40] Nobody wants more legends of the Hala.

[16:43] Nobody wants more Oktoberfest or Houdinis or Hot Wheels.

[16:47] And so the ball is in your court.

[16:49] Will we see if Ryan McQuade's smug attitude is going to pay off with a hit video game

[16:55] or arcade version of a pinball machine?

[16:58] But I'm just here to tell you right now.

[17:00] I think a year from now, if American Pinball doesn't get something out by the end of the

[17:06] year, that's better than Galactic Tank Force.

[17:10] This company is done.

[17:13] They're done.

[17:14] They're finito.

[17:15] We don't need any more American Pinball games if this is what they're going to bring out

[17:20] into the market.

[17:22] And look, I would love for you to disagree with me, but I really don't see a bunch of

[17:26] people saying like American Pinball is doing anything right in the pinball space.

[17:32] And again, they've been around for a long time.

[17:36] They've got multi-millions of dollars backing them.

[17:39] They've worked with some iconic designers.

[17:42] They've had enough on the plate to make it work and they haven't made it work.

[17:48] They don't have a single hit game.

[17:51] They don't have one game that sold more than 2000 units, not even 1000 units of any game.

[17:56] Canada's Pinball Podcast is giving American Pinball a D rating.

[18:02] I wouldn't buy any of their games.

[18:05] I would never buy any of their games new in box.

[18:08] If you wait on their games, you'll be able to buy them for thousands of dollars less

[18:13] than brand new.

[18:15] Galactic Tank Force LE is sitting on Pinside Marketplace, embarrassingly easy to get any

[18:23] single version of the game you want.

[18:25] Nobody wants this game.

[18:27] Nobody wants this game.

[18:28] And how are they going to get excited about this game?

[18:31] What are they going to do to reignite people's excitement about this game?

[18:35] This game was launched in one of the worst possible ways.

[18:39] They did not make a good launch video and now they've got nothing left.

[18:44] I know they're going to give this game to Zach Mani and straight down the middle.

[18:48] That's not going to solve the problem.

[18:50] It's dead on arrival.

[18:53] They never should have made this game.

[18:56] If they've got Ryan McQuade with a video game license, they should have made that game.

[19:02] But American Pinball, I don't think you've got much of a future unless you can make a

[19:08] hit game in the next six months and this game is dead on arrival.

[19:13] And that's my take on American Pinball.

[19:16] They've never made a game that anybody really, really wants.

[19:21] And why would you buy one when we've got all of these games from Stern, from Jersey Jack,

[19:27] from Spooky, from Chicago Gaming Company?

[19:30] What is the need for American Pinball?

[19:34] And I know there's some people on this hobby that just think everything is awesome and

[19:38] every company is awesome, but no.

[19:41] If you're going to make a game, then you need to make a game better than what the competition

[19:47] is making.

[19:48] And American Pinball is not making anything better.

[19:52] In fact, they're making a game that almost nobody wants.

[19:55] And it's not me who's saying that.

[19:58] It's the consumers.

[19:59] A D rating.

[20:01] They get a D. They don't understand this market and they are failing at it.

[20:07] Horribly, Canada out.

[20:09] Hit me up, David Fix.

[20:10] Hit me from Expo, but this is the truth later.
