[00:00] BABY BABY

[00:01] WILL BE BABY

[00:03] BABY

[00:04] IF IT'S NOT TO GOOOOO

[00:05] SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT, SIT

[00:09] Well, now everybody in the pinball world knows why stern pinball does not sell you games directly

[00:15] and why stern pinball does not engage with people on pinside

[00:19] because we have in this hobby, the biggest fucking babies on planet Earth

[00:26] my fucking god

[00:27] I mean I came back from Star Wars

[00:29] and I thought I'm done. I'm done Pimball Podcasting for the weekend and Star Wars was awesome.

[00:34] And I turn on Pinside. I see this Rick and Morty thread is blowing up and will low and be

[00:39] hold. A bunch of fucking whining about what number people are in the Rick and Morty build

[00:48] order. And it's like people didn't fucking, did you guys not listen to how this was going

[00:53] to work? And let me explain it to you. Your order number was never the order you were going

[01:00] to get your fucking game. And these fucking people were trying to do like advanced mathematics

[01:05] trying to figure out, well, if I'm order number 1829 and he's number order number in like

[01:09] 1927 and he's number game number like 138. I should be game number one. No, shut the

[01:15] fuck up with that shit. It was never going to be like that. Now you might want to in

[01:22] your head feel like I got up in the morning and I put my pajamas on. Can you and I bought

[01:28] my machine with a cup of coffee and hand and I got my order in in eight minutes. So I

[01:32] thought I was going to be order number 65. Well, why did you think that motherfucker? Nobody

[01:38] told you you were going to be order number 95 because you checked out in eight minutes

[01:43] and got order number 1879. You stupid motherfucker. Seriously, if I was Chuck, you know what I

[01:50] would do. All your orders are fucking canceled. All of them. Gone. Gone. I'm going to sell

[01:56] these all to Rick and Morty fans who are actually fucking mature grown adults. Not these

[02:00] pinball people whining about it. My God, people are like, oh, Knai, it's not fair. If you

[02:06] bought from spooky's pin, you know, from spooky's website, they already had a hundred games

[02:12] allocated to distributors, to cartoon network, to VIPs and to pass customers. And to those

[02:19] people whining that the first hundred games are going to those people, shut the fuck up.

[02:27] Seriously, wake the fuck up to the modern world. It's how it works. It's not what you know,

[02:35] mother fuckers. It's who you know. That's the way the world works. I feel like these guys

[02:39] have never been to a club or a restaurant. That's hot. That's popular. When you go to

[02:43] a popular club, you know what happened? They put you online. You know what happens if you

[02:47] know the owner of that club, they let you right fucking in. You know what happens if you

[02:52] show up with beautiful women, they let you right in. But these pinball fucking losers who

[02:56] are complaining about how this worked. What the fuck did you think was going to happen?

[03:00] Do you think Scott Dinesi was not going to get a few games? Do you think adult swim was

[03:04] not going to get games? Do you think spooky's distributors who have bought every single

[03:08] game from spooky weren't going to get some of the low numbers? Do you think they were not

[03:12] going to give games to people who have bought every single spooky game to date? Like, what

[03:16] the fuck? What the fuck? And that's a thing is like the people who are bitching are clearly,

[03:22] clearly first time spooky customers. Because if they weren't, they would have distributors.

[03:28] They would know people. They would call up Charlie. The other thing that these people are so fucking

[03:33] stupid about, pick up the fucking phone if you have a question about how it's going to work.

[03:39] And just ask Chuck. You know what I did? I called Chuck. I talked to Chuck. I asked Chuck how it's

[03:45] going to work. And he told me everything, right? And look, he doesn't owe us every single fucking

[03:52] detail about how this thing was going to fucking roll out. Like I let when people are like,

[03:56] well, I wish I knew that the first 100 games were going to those people. And then what?

[04:01] Then what? Would you have not ordered it? What would you have done? Motherfucker, if you are you

[04:05] still a Rick and Morty fan? If 100 games went in front of yours? Please tell me. Tell me

[04:11] fucking Pinside Babies who are whining about this shit. What the fuck would you have done?

[04:15] Like does that change the fact that you love the theme? Does anything change the fact that

[04:20] everybody fucking knew it was going to take 18 months to build these games? Everybody knew that.

[04:26] Everybody knew there was going to be a wait. And for some stupid fucking reason,

[04:31] people thought they would be early just because they got their pajamas on and fucking ordered by like,

[04:35] you know, I had my breakfast, Canadian, or I ordered it in eight minutes. Shut the f- who cares?

[04:41] So did fucking hundreds of other people probably. Have you never fucking been on an internet

[04:46] for a sales site when a hot item goes up for sale? How fast it sells out? I think we sold

[04:52] fucking 4,500 Pepsi Perfix in like five minutes. So don't tell me you're fucking order number 675

[04:58] and your fucking your life is over. That you can't go on anymore because you're fucking

[05:02] after wait for a pinball machine. Who by the way, you know, who you don't even have to fucking

[05:07] pay for most of it until that day comes. So so what? So what? And here's the other part too that

[05:13] people are I'm just I fucking want to punch my computer screen. They said that if you order a

[05:18] blood sucker edition, we are building those first. Alright, so people were like, wait a minute,

[05:22] I ordered a blood sucker edition. So I thought I was going to be early on. If everybody of the 750

[05:28] orders a blood sucker edition, you stupid motherfuckers, then there is no building blood sucker edition

[05:35] first. They're only building blood sucker fucking editions. And I don't know if my calculations are

[05:40] correct, but I think about 700 of these games are blood sucker editions because you are a stupid

[05:46] motherfucker sucker. If you didn't order a blood sucker edition, because it's the way to go on this

[05:50] game. So then ostensibly that did not put anyone in front of the line or it doesn't mean you're

[05:56] going to get your game any faster now. Now look, what do I think? Chuck should have maybe been a

[06:01] little bit clear on that whole thing about joining the fang club to maybe get in early. Yeah,

[06:07] probably. And I think they learned a lesson here, but who gives a fuck? Who gives a fuck? You knew

[06:14] you were going to have to wait. So what is two months, four months, six months, so fucking what?

[06:20] You're going to get your precious little Rick and Morty game. This company is going to

[06:23] fucking make it. They're going to fucking put it in a box. They're going to ship it to you.

[06:28] And your life is still going to be fucking miserable if you're the kind of person who wakes up

[06:32] and moans and groans about like you're fucking pinball spot online. What the fuck did you think was

[06:38] going to happen? And no, but you know what the biggest fucking these people, even worse than the

[06:45] motherfuckers who are trying to do like fucking advanced mathematics from another dimension to figure

[06:50] out how fucking e-commerce number equals an order number. Those people are special fucking breed,

[06:55] but the fucking assholes that are trying to sell their early spots now for three to five thousand

[07:01] dollars. These people should fucking burn burn and pinball hell because I'll tell you right now.

[07:07] This is not like flipping an Ellie spot and don't you fucking call canada hypocrite because I've

[07:12] flipped stern Ellie's before for money. No, it's not the same. I'll explain you why it's not the

[07:16] fucking same. Stern pinball gets all of their Ellie games out to people within a month. All right,

[07:22] not even a month usually, right? So it's not like it's not like you're screwing someone who has a

[07:26] long weight. These motherfuckers know that people are in excruciating pain because they might have to

[07:31] wait a year and a half to get their beloved machine and they have an early number and they're flipping

[07:37] their spot. You know what that says to everybody? It says you're a fucking asshole. It also says you

[07:42] don't fucking even want the game and it also says you don't even fucking like the theme that much.

[07:46] So you're the fucking dick who got online knowing people are going to have to wait a year and a half.

[07:50] See, I would not flip Ellie's if I knew it would take 18 months for people to get the game

[07:56] and I was just in there to cut the line and be a complete turd like these motherfuckers trying to

[08:02] sell it for a profit right now. If you're doing that right now, you're a fucking loser and those

[08:08] people should be banned. You want a ban canada? Fine, I'm banned. I did reprehensible behavior on

[08:14] Pinside four years ago that we can't forgive. These people should be banned, sight unseen. Get the

[08:20] fuck out of this hobby if you're trying to flip a Rick and Morty spot, all right. And can the

[08:26] moderation staff please wake the fuck up? Just wake the fuck up and moderate this fucking thread.

[08:33] This guy, this one guy in here, he's keep saying so last time I'm gonna post. It's the last time

[08:37] I'm gonna post. It's the last time I'm gonna post and he post fucking 18 more times.

[08:42] Donka, Dalek, who the fuck this guy? Somebody get this guy a fucking refund. If I'm Chuck

[08:47] and this guy won't stop and I saw they were like look at Spooky there, they've chimed in. They're like

[08:52] we will give you a fucking refund. Just leave. Leave this company alone. Leave Pinside alone. Stop

[09:00] moaning about your fucking spot. If it means that much do you go buy the fucking spot for $3,000

[09:07] dollars more from that asshole who's trying to flip it. If you really need Rick and Morty in

[09:11] your life that badly and you need to get it immediately, I don't understand it. I don't fucking

[09:16] understand it. This is why this is why companies are not transparent. This is why companies are not

[09:22] on Pinside. See the problem is this. The problem is this. Pinsides not the problem. Spooky's not

[09:28] the problem. It's really not. This community is fucking amazing. It's great. It's like five

[09:33] fucking losers complaining. Five fucking losers who won't stop complaining. Out of 750 people who are

[09:40] probably like 745 people who are fucking cool with it. You should just feel lucky for a few things.

[09:46] You should feel lucky you're gonna get a game. You got in and you're gonna pay all of you who have a

[09:52] number. You're gonna pay the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the game. This second hand

[09:59] market on this game clearly might be more than that. I don't think it will because over 18

[10:05] months so many exciting games are gonna come out. Fucking stranger things is coming out in

[10:09] fucking two days. I'm gonna have to do another fucking stranger things reveal episode. I was gonna

[10:14] do it this morning but because of this bullshit I now have to do two podcasts. I have to do a

[10:19] babies podcast and a fucking real quick. Here's how stranger things is gonna roll out podcast.

[10:24] So fuck you babies for making me do two episodes because I'm fucking tired too. I don't want to have

[10:30] to do these episodes. Okay but you should be lucky you got a game. You should be lucky you're dealing

[10:35] with a company that is very transparent and has been very transparent to date. You should be lucky

[10:40] you're dealing with fucking distributors who are straight shooters. Nobody is trying to rip you off.

[10:45] Nobody's trying to screw you. You woke up one day you fucking babies and in your mind you thought

[10:52] you knew what your fucking spot was. Okay in your mind you thought you knew and it was and then you

[10:56] woke up to be shocked to learn that a hundred of those games went to people who were VIPs and

[11:02] distributors and to longtime customers friends and family and the fucking show creators and you

[11:08] thought you should be in front of those people explaining me why you should be in front of those people.

[11:13] Chuck should not have had to tell you that online orders would start at 100. He doesn't he just

[11:19] because here's the thing they didn't know how they were doing the whole thing they didn't. I'm not

[11:23] saying they'd they handled it poorly but they were figuring it out. They're a small family run

[11:28] business you fucking assholes like cut them some slack. You're gonna get your fucking game. You

[11:34] think you're in pain go fucking talk to some Dutch pinball highway pinball fucking skit skit

[11:39] bee owners and fucking zidware buyers about how fucking painful it is to pay in full and never get

[11:45] your fucking game. What did you pay 1500 bucks and now you have to wait? Cool. Cool. If you don't

[11:51] want to wait get the fuck off the line because they will happily there are probably 50 to 100 people

[11:57] that will happily take your fucking spot from you. So I get your upset I get you want your game

[12:03] but there's nothing you can fucking do about it. It's over they did it they've learned a lesson

[12:08] probably from this whole experience but please shut the fuck up about how you did the math with

[12:13] your stupid fucking e-commerce order number for fucks sakes. This shit makes the Star Wars

[12:19] topper look like a goodbye. This shit makes the fucking Elvira couch look like a great purchase.

[12:25] You see what you're doing you're moaning about the wrong shit in the hobby. This game is gonna be

[12:31] fun it's gonna be awesome and you're gonna fucking get it you knew there was gonna be a fucking

[12:36] wait alright you showed up at the club you didn't know the owner you didn't have hot chicks with

[12:43] you you didn't even fucking have any money to grease the guy at the door hey everything works

[12:48] greasing the guy at the door the club is equivalent to buying that asshole's early spot for $2,000

[12:55] or $3,000 more you got to pay to play and let me tell you something there are rich mother fuckers

[13:01] in this hobby that that means nothing to and if they want to rick and Morty before they're like

[13:06] this happens before Valentine's Day before fucking a birthday before what they will fucking go buy it

[13:12] so there will be flipping but trust me if you flip this pin early and you flip your spot people are

[13:20] gonna think you're a fucking asshole so you just got to know that going in and look I know people

[13:24] that have no problem with people thinking they're a fucking asshole but you are fucking assholes

[13:29] and people are gonna call you out on it alright everybody do me a favor go see fucking star wars

[13:36] it was awesome go have a great dinner enjoy your fucking holidays tis the season right this is the

[13:43] time of year when you should be thankful for all you fucking have you should be giving back to those

[13:50] who are less fortunate than you have you lost fucking perspective you fucking babies on

[13:55] pin side oh my fucking pinball game go up to anybody in life and tell them that your $7 to $8,000

[14:03] pinball machine is secure you're going to get it you just have to wait because the manufacturer

[14:08] can only build a certain amount in a certain amount of time and see what all of your friends do

[14:14] they're gonna be like what the fuck are you complaining about you know real issues in life your

[14:18] health issues maybe you get laid off at work maybe your relationship is in trouble maybe your wife

[14:57] I love you guys I understand why you babies are moaning but just fucking relax give this company

[15:04] a break it's the hottest game they've ever made they're not used to handling this kind of high

[15:12] hype game they're not used to handling that this this many people have never tried to get through

[15:18] the door of spooky pinball ever and they're all trying to get through at once in four hours 750

[15:24] people they're doing their best they're fucking manually inputting each order one at a time trying

[15:30] to figure the fucking shit out but I can tell you this I know they care about each and every one of you

[15:37] even you fucking babies bitching they care about you they don't want you to be upset if but there

[15:43] might not be something they can do sorry you're not going to bitch your way to the front of the line

[15:47] it is what it is alright so cut them some fucking slack go make a fucking pinball company if you

[15:53] think you can do better than they're doing right now I think they're doing a great job and the

[15:57] fucking babies are just pin-side noise that's gonna go away in like 48 hours because then we're

[16:03] gonna start believe me we're all gonna start bitching about stranger things you're gonna have to
