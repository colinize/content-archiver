[00:00] We are going to curse on this episode of Canatus Pimbal podcast. I feel like as a

[00:06] communicator I've just been holding back a little bit in fully expressing how I

[00:10] feel about some stuff that I read in this hobby so I need to let it out. I need to

[00:15] vent in the right way possible. So you've been warned on episode 382 of Canatus

[00:22] Pimbal podcast. This will feature graphic language alright so put your kids to

[00:28] bed close their ears. Let's get episode 382 going right now.

[00:33] Alright, strap in kids welcome to an explicit version of Canatus Pimbal podcast.

[01:00] What ridiculous stuff is going on in the Pimbal world that makes me want to

[01:04] swear to you today this Friday morning. Well this is not really ridiculous but I

[01:08] want to just put things in context of something that I got yesterday. I got

[01:12] about like two emails about this and and it was this proclamation that this

[01:17] big groundbreaking moment is happening Pimbal. This glorious like miracle has

[01:23] occurred to expand Pimbal to the masses. Oh yeah it's no other than Dave and

[01:28] Busters has put two two P3 multi-morphic machines in one Dave and Busters

[01:36] location and I got this note from Jerry it goes multi-morphic incorporated the

[01:41] maker of the revolutionary P3 Pimbal platform is proud to announce that Dave

[01:48] and Busters is now featuring P3 machines in its Austin Texas location. This is a

[01:55] groundbreaking accomplishment that highlights a resurgence in the popularity of

[02:02] Pimbal and helps multi-morphic achieve its goal of bringing modern Pimbal

[02:08] experiences to gamers of all ages and interests a groundbreaking moment. First I

[02:16] just want to say Jerry congratulations on getting two machines inside a Dave and

[02:21] Busters. I think that's really awesome. I know that getting Pimbal into Dave

[02:25] and Busters has been something that people out there have wanted. It's in our

[02:29] K chain in America but let's just stop for a freaking minute and let's not fool

[02:35] our fucking self. I'm just gonna curse. Let me just tell you how I feel. We've got

[02:39] to be you got to be fucking kidding me that this is a groundbreaking moment for

[02:45] Pimbal. Can we for a moment? Can we for a moment ask one question? Have any of you

[02:50] ever been in a Dave and fucking Busters? Like go into one. It is filled with

[02:56] redemption machines. These ginormous versions of Pac-Man and like these

[03:01] arcade machines that are just huge huge screens and shooters. They've got like a

[03:06] halo with like six guns. It's loud. It's it's beyond bright. It's a seizure-inducing

[03:12] environment in which all these kids are just running around just trying to win

[03:17] tickets to cash in for crappy prizes. Like that's Dave and Busters. There is

[03:23] nothing about Dave and Busters that connects at all to the Pimbal

[03:29] demographic the 40 to 50 year old men even like 30 to 50 year old men. There is

[03:34] nothing. There is nothing. Pimbal in that environment is absolutely inane. It

[03:39] makes absolutely no fucking sense. So I just failed to understand how getting

[03:45] Pimbal machines to with them into a Dave and Busters is a fucking historic

[03:51] groundbreaking moment for the expansion of Pimbal. And I just want to like say

[03:56] like it's just like are we fucking at this point now? We're literally

[04:01] pretending like this is going to expand Pimbal like some eight year old who

[04:06] just know what the fuck he's walking up on is like have you seen kids in a

[04:10] Dave and Busters? It's like 80-D on crack. Like these kids are just running around

[04:15] screaming like going from machine to machine just slapping big flappy bird

[04:19] buttons and shit they don't know what the fuck they're doing. They're just

[04:22] they're it's like sensory overload. It's like the last place on planet Earth in

[04:26] which fucking Pimbal should be. And yet like for some reason people look at

[04:32] this place like it's a like Pimbal needs to get in there and if it gets in

[04:36] there that validates Pimbal. And let me just do a little bit of a news flash

[04:40] because when I see stuff like this is like really important for it shows the

[04:45] popularity of Pimbal. I mean let's just stop fucking pretending like Pimbal

[04:49] hasn't had a resurgence over the last five fucking years and it's grown

[04:53] tremendously well and companies like Stern are blowing up in sales. Like are we

[04:58] really clapping? Like we're standing up and being like yeah we got two machines

[05:03] in one fucking location out of 100 and like five Dave and Buster's are 130

[05:11] locations around American Canada. It's in one location. One fucking location and

[05:17] this is a groundbreaking moment. I don't fucking get it. Is it just me? Am I just

[05:22] some like stride in asshole who like can't appreciate this? You've got to be

[05:27] fucking kidding me. Stern Pimbal machines are in bars in probably hundreds if

[05:33] not a few thousand bars around the world every day giving people Pimbal

[05:38] enjoyment. How many like breweries have Pimbal machines in them and how many

[05:42] bars and how many people's homes have like there's fucking Pimbal machines

[05:46] thousands of them out there in thousands of locations and one location of

[05:53] Dave and Busters now has Pimbal machines and that's groundbreaking. Do you

[05:58] really think that Dave and Buster's audience gives a shit about Pimbal? Will

[06:02] be the audience that latches on and expands Pimbal? I just don't fucking get

[06:07] like look look. Emo me at CanadianPimbal at gmail.com. You think I'm being a jerk

[06:11] about this topic but come on come on and then and then it's like I love it. It's

[06:16] like let me read the other part of this which is really funny. It's like hey

[06:19] it's like let me just read this. There is this is not only in an excellent

[06:24] opportunity for multi-morphic but for the entire Pimbal industry to grow. Are

[06:30] you fucking kidding me? This is where I'm just like this is just having machines

[06:35] in Dave and Buster is an opportunity for the entire Pimbal industry to grow.

[06:39] Like I've said the fucking industry has been growing exponentially the only

[06:45] company that hasn't been growing exponentially is P3. You know it's like I'm

[06:51] not being a jerk it's just like everyone is everyone's sales have increased

[06:55] spooky Pimbal sales have doubled and tripled. Stern Pimbal sales have

[06:59] increased tremendously. Jersey Jack sales you know I think they're gonna

[07:03] increase tremendously. It's like what why does having two games in Dave and

[07:08] Busters? How does that grow the Pimbal hobby? So we just explain that to me.

[07:12] Sit me down and explain to me how the kinds of people who go into Dave and Buster's

[07:17] are gonna now like expand the Pimbal industry. I think it's I think it's bullshit

[07:23] and then it goes to seize this opportunity. We have to seize this opportunity. This

[07:28] is all their communication. We must have people in the Austin area go play these

[07:34] games. Get out and play these games to make this venture a success. If the

[07:40] Pimbal community proves to Dave and Busters that Pimbal machines can be

[07:44] successful this could be the tip of the fucking iceberg. I would love to go

[07:50] into my local Dave and Busters and see a row of Pimbal machines. Alright and then

[07:54] I love it we get this call to action. You know I work in marketing it's all

[07:57] about what's the consumer call to action. I love this. Here's here here are ways

[08:02] you can help people if you love Pimbal here are ways you can help the Pimbal

[08:06] industry grow. Number one if you live near Austin go play these games.

[08:12] Exclamation mark. Go play these games. Show that local manager at that one

[08:17] Dave and Busters. How popular Pimbal will be. How their revenue will just skyrocket

[08:22] if they put more Pimbal machines into each Dave and Busters. Number two contact

[08:28] Dave and Busters and tell them something like I would love to see Pimbal in

[08:34] your arcade and would visit your establishment more often if I could play

[08:39] some more Pimbal. Yes and here is the link to their contact. Let me tell you

[08:43] something. If you email Dave and Busters and said hey I would come by more often

[08:49] if I could play more Pimbal they're gonna be like fuck you like what are you

[08:54] talking about. Seriously like Jerry was asking people to call the management

[08:58] call the local managers at Dave and Busters and ask them for more Pimbal. What

[09:03] the fuck are we doing. Like what what the fuck is like what is this. Are you

[09:08] gonna call every local McDonald's and tell them you want more like lobster

[09:12] rolls because you like lobster and hey if the lobster rolls can get into

[09:16] McDonald's it's a breakthrough tipping point for lobster rolls. I mean what

[09:20] why are we pretending like Dave and Busters is a great venue for Pimbal

[09:26] machines. It's you know and actually the only Pimbal that really might work in

[09:30] the Dave and Busters is the P3 platform that is connected like the heads up

[09:35] game actually works well because it's not it's it's very visual and the games

[09:41] are connected and that makes sense at Dave and Busters there's no other Pimball

[09:44] that would actually make sense to put inside a Dave and Busters and here's the

[09:48] major thing. This is like the major like thing about why Pimbal is not in Dave

[09:53] and Busters because Pimbal machines fucking break and they break all the time

[09:59] and there is no way that Dave and Busters that is filled with games that are

[10:04] mostly raw thrills arcade games that don't break there's no way that they

[10:10] want to bring into their establishment a product that's as finicky and likely to

[10:16] break as a fucking Pimball machine and they don't need to I mean seriously there's

[10:20] like a you got a Pimball machine next to a fucking three-story Pac-Man game

[10:25] next to these huge Halo games next to these huge like basketball and ski

[10:29] ball like it's it's it's so funny me now look I will say I do like the outer

[10:34] cabinet lighting on the P3 machines those are cool those are cool let's put that

[10:38] on more Pimball machines right I think that looks really cool but this notion

[10:43] that you should go harass your local Dave and Busters manager to get more

[10:48] Pimball on location is a fucking joke it's a joke it's a joke and Pimball has been

[10:54] growing for the last five years Pimball has been expanding for the last five

[10:59] years Dave and Busters will do nothing to get Pimball expansion it will it won't

[11:05] do anything you know who's expanding Pimball Stern fucking Pimball they're the

[11:11] only ones that are expanding Pimball they're the only company that is built to

[11:16] expand Pimball they're the only company that can ship hundreds of games a

[11:20] week to locations all over the world and like it's funny to me it's like Jerry

[11:24] sold what on total less than a hundred games in in a few years Stern makes a

[11:29] fucking hundred games in two days that are going out on location going out into

[11:34] people's homes going out into breweries going out into Barcai's what the I

[11:39] mean this is what's frustrating to me and it's like this this like we're

[11:43] cheerleading stuff that is it's it's it's it's not that significant it's not

[11:48] that significant you know what would be significant you know what would be

[11:52] significant if someone would actually make network play between the games or

[11:55] in people's homes maybe connect those things maybe make these fucking expensive

[11:59] toys actually have the level of connection we've had for video games for

[12:02] last 15 years but nope let's put one Dave and Busters with machines and and say

[12:09] to Groundbrook breaking moment all right am I being a jerk tell me tell me and

[12:13] Jerry like I know you listen to the podcast I'm just saying I'm glad you're

[12:15] there but I don't understand here's me I'm the marketer if you know what we'll

[12:20] get more of these into more Dave and Busters if the games on that location

[12:25] actually generate revenue revenue for for like the business right isn't that

[12:31] why they would incorporate new machines because it makes them money it's very

[12:35] basic economics now I do agree if you go play it in Austin Texas area and it's

[12:41] doing really well fine you know but the notion for me to call the you know

[12:45] what Dave and Busters is it's in Times Square for me the notion of me calling

[12:50] them up and telling a guy the manager there that I would come by more often if

[12:54] they put pinball there I mean he should tell me to go fuck off like what the

[12:59] fuck and he'd be like who the fuck are you like I'm in Times Square I get a ton

[13:04] of traffic every day because I'm in time fucking Square and he's gonna have a

[13:09] bunch of fucking pinball people barrage him with fucking requests and here's why

[13:14] I wouldn't call that motherfucker up because I don't need to go to Dave and

[13:17] fucking Busters which is the worst environment on planet earth to play pinball

[13:21] in when I can go to sunshine and I can go to like two bits and I can go to like

[13:26] all the other locations you know pioneer bar there like I can go to like

[13:31] Adams pinball off then try Becca like there are so many locations that are so

[13:35] much better to play pinball in I just think this whole thing about Dave and

[13:39] Busters being the you know the final frontier of pinball expansion if we can

[13:43] get into game Dave and Busters then it proves pinball has is back fuck that it's

[13:48] fucking stupid Dave and Busters is meant for little fucking snotty nose kids

[13:52] running around slapping big buttons these games all suck to this Dave and Busters

[13:56] being a modern arcade is garbage it's garbage there's no games there that

[14:00] take any skill anymore there's no skill required in any of that shit no more

[14:05] ain't no street fighter in there like these kids don't know how to like grow up

[14:08] and actually get good at a game like play a game consistently and then play

[14:13] against someone next to you like we grew up we grew up with games like

[14:17] street fighter mortal combat like Donkey Kong like Pac-Man you know like Neo

[14:21] Geo shit like real shit in an arcade where you had to be good and you were elbow

[14:26] to elbow with a guy that was trying to fucking hot duke in your ass and fucking

[14:31] embarrass you in front of the high school girl that you thought was cute that's

[14:35] fucking video game arcade playing for me not the Dave and Busters bullshit like

[14:40] fuck like you can go in there all day long and trying to win tickets all right

[14:44] fuck Friday fucking canada he's back the fucking canada's unhinged all right the

[14:50] other thing that I was laughing at and I just have to say this like I love Jeff

[14:54] at this week in pinball I think this week in pinball is an amazing amazing

[14:58] site I think Jeff gives us some of the best pinball news out there but I have

[15:03] to say this I have to say this Jeff my man your site is the best go to for

[15:10] pinball news you don't have to explain yourself when you are going to

[15:15] incorporate some ads into your site in fact I don't think people really give a

[15:20] shit that you're gonna put some ads on your site here's why because on the

[15:25] internet on every single site we know and love there's fucking ads and we

[15:29] don't really care or even notice them and I just saw this like long

[15:33] explanation from him about why there are going to be some ads on twip you know

[15:40] every week and it's Jeff I just have to say you need to just do shit you don't

[15:46] have to explain yourself at every single move you don't owe an explanation to

[15:51] everybody you don't have to also you don't share this is the thing you don't do

[15:56] you don't share with everybody what the advertising cost is on your site to

[16:03] like the reader of this site like you don't do that like I work with you know

[16:08] he keeps saying like I'm not a journalist we're not professional you're a

[16:10] fucking journalist now bro you've got a website you're a fucking journalist I

[16:15] studied journalism in college all right I'm not it this the moment I decide to

[16:20] have a website I'm now a journalist I'm making a journal about some topic it's

[16:25] okay everyone's there are so many fucking citizen journalists out there right

[16:29] now it's fine that's the modern world like that's called like the internet of

[16:33] today you don't need to explain yourself but you don't fucking share with the

[16:38] reader what your advertisers are paying you don't do like and I saw that I'm like

[16:43] why you do it's like it's like he almost feels guilty that he has to monetize

[16:47] the site a little bit and I'll tell you this right now if you don't if you

[16:52] don't agree with Jeff making money then fuck you because this guy puts so much

[16:56] work into that site and he deserves to monetize the site but he doesn't have

[17:01] to do it in a way in which he's so fucking defensive Jeff and I know this

[17:06] like you know Jeff got really been out of shape when Jersey Jack lied to him

[17:11] about Willie Wonka and I kept telling him like dude who cares it's like yeah

[17:15] Jack yeah maybe Jack lied to you maybe he did right and and sometimes you

[17:20] know business owners will lie or mislead media because they they're they're

[17:25] nervous or they want they have their own plans he didn't have to do it the way

[17:28] he did I don't even think Jack meant it to be malicious at all I think it was

[17:33] just you know he was just probably being playful and by doing that he he told

[17:38] you it wasn't shipping when it was gonna ship or something like that or the

[17:41] release day whatever it was right but here's the thing you know Jeff was like

[17:45] oh I'm gonna lose credibility like again if you have a website and you have a

[17:50] podcast about fucking pinball right fucking pinball like something that nobody

[17:54] really cares that much about except a handful of people right right when Jeff

[17:58] says the numbers like two thousand three thousand I think it's about right I

[18:01] think there's about two to three thousand people out there in the world maybe

[18:04] four thousand at most out of like seven and a half billion people that actually

[18:09] give a shit on a weekly daily basis about reading and absorbing pinball news

[18:14] okay and he's got a great audience pin sides got a great audience this podcast has

[18:19] a great audience other podcasts out there have a great audience but if you for a

[18:23] fucking moment don't sit back and realize we are making content that most of

[18:29] the world doesn't give a shit about I think you're off base already okay so you

[18:34] have to understand like it doesn't matter if you get pinball news wrong what

[18:38] fucking happens if you get pinball news wrong how many times have I been wrong on

[18:42] this podcast about something who who cares like you're here for one reason and

[18:46] one reason only to be entertained by my antics and my point of view on the

[18:50] pinball hobby now look I also get a lot right I get some wrong but for the most

[18:54] part we're all just a bunch of jerk offs speculating about pinball every day

[18:59] spending way too much time thinking about pinball every day way too much time on

[19:04] pinside reading stupid fucking threads about nothing stupid fucking threads like

[19:09] oh my god you got to go through 50 pages to figure out how to fucking fix the

[19:13] simple issue on a game right so I think Jeff gets like he's kind of like really

[19:20] about the credibility of it all and I keep telling him like man it's okay like if

[19:23] you get something wrong or or misreport something you're not gonna lose an

[19:27] audience but here's what happens a few people a few people will hit Jeff up and

[19:32] say you know how could you report this wrong like you know he gets a few

[19:36] people upset and a few people might hit him up and say he's losing credibility

[19:41] and I'm here to tell you Jeff if I were to listen to a few of the people that I

[19:46] upset on every fucking podcast I would have hung it up years ago right you have

[19:51] to have a little bit of a thick skin in this industry because people as I was

[19:55] saying like they're way too into it and you're gonna get that kind of feedback

[19:58] now look the other thing is this Jeff I don't think anyone thinks you putting

[20:03] ads on your site means that your site is no longer gonna be objective in fact

[20:07] if you've read this week in pinball from day one which I have this site is 100

[20:13] percent objective it's objective Jeff barely if ever injects his own opinion

[20:20] other than he's excited about stuff he's not giving like reviews of games

[20:25] he's not doing what I do on the show he's not saying nobody's gonna buy

[20:29] October fest in August which is true by the way that actually is like an

[20:32] objective fact he's not giving opinions like that he's just telling you the

[20:37] news and and and when you look at his site like that I don't think anyone thinks

[20:42] if he takes advertisements from certain companies that he's gonna give more

[20:47] favorable opinions of those companies I don't think that's ever gonna be the

[20:50] case I also don't think that he's gonna increase his coverage of those

[20:54] companies because people pay for him on the site so I just think Jeff man I

[20:59] don't think you have to explain yourself I don't know if this is coming

[21:01] cross in this little bit of a tirade but what I'm saying is he's got the best

[21:05] fucking pinball news website he deserves to make fucking money on it and he

[21:09] doesn't have to explain himself right he then writes for the love of pinball for

[21:13] the love of pinball he goes this is where the conflict arises not just for

[21:19] this week in pinball but for all of the pinball websites podcast twitch stream

[21:24] ers youtubers and other creative content providers he could summarize all of

[21:29] those people as for the other pinball jerk offs if you accept sponsors your

[21:33] content will be questioned your opinions and motives will be questioned as they

[21:40] should be but if you are spending the time and money on your content

[21:44] eventually most will try to find some support and at least to offset the money

[21:50] you're spending he I love this he writes note there are a few exceptions to this

[21:54] right there's a few exceptions a few creative content providers that can

[21:58] produce great content for years but never take on sponsors or ask for financial

[22:02] support a few notables include pinball news fun with bonus for your amusement

[22:08] only this flipping podcast electric gamers podcast and pinball profile etc well

[22:13] you know I love I'm not on this list because I guess I took the money I

[22:17] asked I took the money guys I sold out I'm now like a shell for pinquest I took

[22:21] their money I you know I asked for patreon I have not been able to maintain

[22:27] objective and an imbalance because I've asked for finance no no like look

[22:32] Jeff the bottom line the bottom line with all of this bullshit is simply nobody

[22:38] who who cares who gives a shit if someone questions what you write on a pinball

[22:47] who gives a shit really why do you care why do you care I don't get it I don't

[22:52] get it I close the loop on this whole thing by saying this Jeff's got the best

[22:56] site Jeff needs to just like come on Jeff you need a little bit thicker skin

[23:00] there and don't have to explain yourself if people woke up the next day and

[23:03] there are ads on this week in pinball I bet like only five people would be like

[23:07] we're a minute why are we seeing this at and you know what fuck those five people

[23:10] fuck them you don't need them you got two to three thousand people who come into

[23:14] your site every week for news who gives a shit if ten crybabies you know see

[23:19] some ads I mean we're fucking bombarded with ads I think you should use a

[23:23] one I think you should just only run pinstadium ads man fuck it go all in on

[23:27] that strategy I bet Scott would donate way more than a fucking hundred bucks a

[23:32] month and seriously let's talk about that for a minute a hundred bucks a month

[23:35] is all these asking and I I don't get it this is the other part you know I just

[23:41] went out to dinner last night I mean fucking lunch like yesterday I went to

[23:44] Hillsstone which is Houston's everywhere else in America I had a fucking beer

[23:49] a cheeseburger Brenda had some sushi and a kale salad and a glass of wine and it

[23:54] was a hundred and twenty fucking dollars and and all we had to do was sit there

[23:58] and fucking eat all right and eat the amount of work this guy puts into this

[24:03] site and he's asking for a hundred bucks a month and fucking

[24:08] bulls twenty five dollars a week from these major pinball companies to sponsor

[24:13] one of the most popular pinball websites how silly does that start to look right

[24:18] it's bullshit it's bullshit now you know I don't know how you quite monetize that's

[24:22] the problem though is the ultimate problem with all of this is it all is

[24:27] monetarily not valuable information like you know when Jeff talks about like the

[24:33] integrity and this and that and getting it right and you're gonna come into

[24:35] question we're not talking about news about you know trade wars in Europe and

[24:41] nuclear weapons and conflict with North Korea it's fucking pinball news it has a

[24:47] monetary value of fucking zero zero now I know he's trying to add monetary value to a

[24:54] bit but you're like oh you know we'll have insider info that we'll sell to you

[24:58] and he's not the only one doing that shit stern selling information to you too

[25:02] right the stern insider club look at that club what do you pay like ten bucks a

[25:05] month and get a stupid fucking t-shirt and dumbass news that everyone already has

[25:09] like there's absolutely no reason to be a stern insider and stern like I know you

[25:14] listen to this podcast but you gotta be fucking kidding me man that t-shirt is a

[25:18] fucking joke you look like a fucking clown about to paint a house if you join that

[25:23] club I mean who said it's like it's like they almost as a joke say hey how can we

[25:27] make an insider program and have the ugliest fucking t-shirt and and oh here here it is

[25:32] let's do this now let's not get yeti or france you're any of our talented artists to make an

[25:37] awesome t-shirt let's just do this piece of shit anyway all right look can it on friday morning

[25:42] some excited it's the weekend I'm gonna go driving the demon I'm gonna go pick up the type R

[25:47] from the body shop I'm gonna have a long lunch today and look support Jeff at this weekend pinball

[25:55] Jeff I think people should just donate to your site I think you should set up a patreon like I

[26:00] have and just do patreon donations and you guys who love this site should donate and we should stop

[26:05] having to explain ourselves all right let me get on until the final topic today I'm on a roll

[26:09] here people let me just end this podcast where I'm cursing with with something I've been wanting to

[26:14] curse about for a while let me take a little drink of coffee and get some more energy in me

[26:19] oh see no editing there you're gonna have to listen to that pause while I sip the coffee here's

[26:23] the thing I want all of you who have been following this big Lebowski thread for the last few weeks

[26:29] I want all of you who have been posting in that thread I want all of you who have just been thinking

[26:33] about this whole thing to sit down and listen to me right now because what I'm about to tell you

[26:40] is all you ever need to know and you probably should just stop trying to do what you've been trying

[26:45] to do for the last few days there is no fucking money it's gone the numbers will never fucking add up

[26:54] watching you guys trying to add up the numbers or figure out scenarios in which this shit can get

[27:02] going again is so fucking stupid you all look stupid it's over the numbers will never add up you

[27:11] guys look like you're trying to do two plus two equals five for for like weeks and the ultimate

[27:17] thing is this when you start saying well you know in angel we need to stop welcome to the real world

[27:24] when you go fucking bankrupt and you rob your fucking customers of the games they already bought

[27:31] and then you take those games that other people paid for and you sell them to new people you know

[27:38] where you should be you should be in fucking jail you should be in fucking jail there is no way

[27:46] there is no way that after that occurs anything good is going to come out of this and I don't understand

[27:53] why people are hoping for that I don't understand why people aren't suing the fuck out of Barry

[27:59] it like why where are the eAs where are they they sued John pop it up they got his ass in the court

[28:06] they dragged his ass into court and he had a face to fucking music yeah him being bailed out by

[28:12] Robert Mueller that was Robert Mueller's decision to do all right but John pop it you don't for a minute

[28:18] think that John pop it was ever out of you know issues and and and had a pay for a lawyer had to go

[28:24] into court he at least they fucking held him accountable on some level do I like John pop it

[28:31] you being bailed out no does anybody know watching Barry almost ostensibly get out of this situation

[28:40] get out of it without any accountability is a fucking tragedy it should be something that all of

[28:48] you all of you should be up in arms over and there's more up in arms over pin stadium spamming

[28:54] the marketplace then there is over Barry reselling customer games to new buyers that has never happened

[29:03] I've never seen this happen before in the history of pinball and it is fucking incredible that you

[29:10] idiots out there who are trying to put the numbers together are trying to put the numbers together

[29:14] don't be an idiot I don't think you're stupid I don't think you want to be idiots what I think most

[29:20] of you who are doing this want and I say this sincerely I think you just want the game you paid for

[29:26] and I think you still have hope and I still think a lot of you are EA's or no EA's and you know

[29:33] early achievers and you don't want them to lose out and you want to see a scenario in which they

[29:39] do get their games and I also want to see them get their games and I but I just I just don't ever

[29:45] see it happening because this is criminal behavior it won't lead to a new company that will do

[29:53] things right every opportunity he had to do the right thing he was selfish him and Yop were

[30:00] selfish they treated this company like the money coming in was theirs and not yours and it was yours

[30:08] it was always your money it was your money that you gave them for a product you didn't give it to

[30:16] them in the form of a salary for them you didn't give it to them to travel around the world you didn't

[30:22] give it to them to rent out pen houses and have parties you didn't give it to them for anything

[30:27] else other than to give you the game they wanted and when the moment came when apparently they

[30:33] needed more money to make each game they did not give you any of you the opportunity to save

[30:41] them and save your your purchase of that game they never allowed you to pay more for the game

[30:46] instead they spun a bunch of lies and excuses and missed truths they did they never gave you a

[30:53] chance to pay a thousand euro more per game and and and so what happened ARA said we want 51%

[31:00] of the company and we'll keep making these games we'll get the EA's their games and here's the

[31:06] moment and here's the moment where I think all of you need to just understand that this is the

[31:11] real character of the two founders of Dutch Pimbal they could have stepped aside and allowed you

[31:19] to get your game and given ARA control but they cared more selfishly about not letting their

[31:27] dream go and in the process of maintaining their dream they screwed over all of you and instead of

[31:35] just and even when they screwed you over and even when you know that they lost the lawsuit the

[31:41] ultimate fuck you to everybody has always been one simple thing they will never just say we failed

[31:48] we failed and we can't do it no they will always keep that door open that there's some glimmer of

[31:55] hope that you're gonna one day get your game and if we sell them for 12000 and if we sell them for 15,000

[32:00] if we sell a hundred new games at 12,500 that will give us enough money to then remake the

[32:06] it's never gonna fucking add up it will never add up this is a fucking Ponzi scheme approach

[32:14] and you're not stupid people you guys are smart enough you know that this is criminal behavior

[32:20] it's what lands people like Bernie made off in jail it's what he's doing he's taking new money

[32:27] and he needs to get enough new money to pay out the old investors how is that not the very

[32:32] definition of a fucking Ponzi business scheme and so I think these 40 games will go to people

[32:39] I'm one of them I don't like fucking the whole scenario at all but it's over it's over like it's

[32:46] over and the you know the only way out yes the only way always out in life is if a miracle angel

[32:52] investors swoops in but that is the dumbest like to be bailed out to wish for a bailout in a

[32:59] pinball proposition that is lost a few million dollars that requires another few million dollars

[33:05] to get it back on track why the fuck would a rich successful person who think about it if you're

[33:12] rich and you really want a big Lebowski why the fuck would you jump start this fucking monstrosity

[33:19] when you can just go buy a game for $12,500 or go buy a game for $20,000 versus sinking $2 million

[33:26] because the ultimate I think the ultimate irresponsible not it just is like the ultimate this is what

[33:32] makes me the maddest is for him to succeed Barry and the guilt that he's weighing on like you know

[33:39] for EA's to get their game and for their hope to be fulfilled he basically needs a super wealthy

[33:44] person that feels guilty that these guys are not going to get their games so that super wealthy

[33:50] person has to come in and like clean up his entire fucking mess why why why should that rich person

[33:57] have the burden of cleaning up the fucking monstrosity that is Dutch pinball why why why is it their

[34:06] obligation they it's not their responsibility and I felt the same way about the pinball brothers

[34:11] I have nothing but sympathy and empathy for the pinball brothers they they trusted Andrew highway

[34:17] they trusted him they invested millions in him they invested time energy and passion in him and they

[34:26] kept giving him money and they kept believing his lies and look what happened to them look what

[34:32] happened to them and they took over the company and only then did they realize how deep how deep

[34:39] the troubles were with highway pinball and here we are again all right here we are again all right

[34:46] so the whole thing is this the numbers are never gonna add up and I think you guys should be more

[34:51] angry than you are and I think you should fucking sue sue sue sue sue sue sue you should he should

[34:57] not be allowed to get a check for half a million dollars and walk off into the sunset and again

[35:03] he's gonna keep that door open well the only hope of you getting your games is if you don't sue I've

[35:08] heard that shit time and time again I heard it from Andrew I heard it from fucking John Papadu we

[35:13] hear it from Barry now why is it why is it that all these failed companies always always end up at

[35:19] the same thing it's like well if you really want your games like then don't come after me with lawsuits

[35:24] then then don't bring heat on me then don't listen to canada saying get a refund from Andrew highway

[35:29] when he was lying to you about all this stuff he was doing you know it's like bullshit

[35:33] let me tell you something there's there's a one word there's one word that's a common denominator

[35:39] for all of these guys who take your money for a product then don't give it to you and that word is

[35:44] they're fucking crux they're crux it is you're a crook when you can't finish game number one and

[35:52] then you take game number then you start taking money for game number two and three hello John

[35:57] Papadu you're a crook when you start selling other people's games to new buyers you're a crook

[36:03] someone else bought this but I'm gonna sell to you that's a crook all right you're a crook when

[36:08] you're not paying your rent and moving on to another you know factory and leaving your first

[36:14] factory to deal with the bills and not pay people you're a crook when you're not paying your employees

[36:20] all right you want you want me mean a lot of these guys are not talking because they sign NDAs

[36:23] but he view here the truth about like how some of those highway employees were treated he

[36:28] crook it's a crook all right you know you know and so you know he knew he's not a crook

[36:35] it Jersey Jack's not a crook when Jersey Jack's angel investor came in and helped them out

[36:39] uh here's the difference this is a big difference Jersey Jack had a fucking company he had games

[36:43] in development he had a family business or you need it help he got an influx and cash

[36:50] if you if you're an investor and you look at Dutch Pimbo right now well what do you got you got

[36:53] you got one dude Barry with a fucking you know a bunch of games in parts in a you know he's

[36:59] gonna have him in storage he's got no factory he's got no line workers he's got no he's got no

[37:04] company there is no Dutch Pimbo all you'd just be investing in him and then you'd have to go down

[37:10] the same charade again of reestablishing a contract manufacturing of these games you'd have to set

[37:16] you'd have to set up a Pimbole company from zilch from zero from the ground up who the fuck wants to do

[37:23] that who the fuck wants to do that all right oh guys sorry sorry for this and you know look it's

[37:29] only 38 minutes into this podcast and I think I'm done I think I'm done I just want to get all

[37:35] that this off of my chest these are just things that I've been like I just been like I can't all

[37:40] right look I think it's great that jerry's in to Dave and busters but I don't think Dave and busters

[37:46] is ever gonna expand Pimbole let's not fucking fool ourselves I think this weekend Pimbole is the

[37:51] best Pimbole website out there it's got no drama in all of the news I don't think Jeff has to

[37:55] explain himself why he's putting ads and I think you should donate to Jeff site right if you donate

[38:00] to canada please donate to him all right and Jeff I just think you should set up a patreon and ask

[38:04] people that way all right the other thing is this the other thing is this you know there has been a

[38:09] crook this whole thing it's this is criminal behavior and I and I think you guys should should not

[38:14] stand for it and I think it's just the reality of the whole situation I hope big Lebowski's get made

[38:21] again one day but it only will happen when dutch Pimbole is bankrupted and is over and the game

[38:27] is taken from them and that is the only that would be the only glimmer of hope for people that it's

[38:34] gone all right as long as they're around it's gonna be the same bullshit and you know it and the

[38:39] final thing is this let's like let's let's the reason why I just want to do like this sort of stride

[38:44] in podcast it's not really stride in podcast I mean but there's so much good happening there's

[38:49] so much good about to happen in Pimbole and Pimbole has expanded and Pimbole is in more places

[38:54] than ever before and and that is because of companies like Stern of companies like spooky of

[39:00] Jersey Jack Chicago gaming American Pimbole right there's a lot of companies out there suncoast

[39:08] Pimbole that you know P3 multi-morphic every company out there that has taken consumer money

[39:15] and given people a game in a timely manner please take a fucking bow because we love all of you

[39:23] as companies we might have strong opinions about your games we might critique your games on this

[39:28] podcast we might not love every game itself but I love all of you manufacturers because you are

[39:34] keeping Pimbole alive and well you are expanding Pimbole in your own ways and you are real companies

[39:42] you are not ripping people off you are not crooks you're not lying and if you ever have the idea

[39:48] to create a Pimbole company then good but just make sure you're not going to rip your customers off

[39:54] and if you go down the other road and you screw people over and you you you you you rob people's

[40:00] money and you lie to them and you keep them hanging on for years and you're like engaging in

[40:04] criminal behavior then then you're an asshole and you've done nothing but hurt the hobby okay

[40:10] and this is just a Pimbole podcast that's trying to call them out when they do that stuff all right

[40:15] everyone have a great Friday have a great week and I hope you enjoyed this podcast I enjoy doing

[40:19] it I enjoy doing this show I mean I'm not going to do these kind of shows very often but I hope
