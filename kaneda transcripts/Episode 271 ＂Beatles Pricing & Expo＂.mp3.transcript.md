[00:00] Welcome to episode 271 of Canada's Pinball Podcast, your only chance at getting the

[00:59] winner.

[01:29] if we didn't talk about more rumors and speculation.

[01:33] And one of the most speculated things going on

[01:36] in the pinball world is the Beatles.

[01:39] All right, so we broke the news on this show

[01:42] that they are going to add spinning discs

[01:44] to the Beatles, see which reskin play field.

[01:48] Now, here's the new thing I'm hearing,

[01:51] because I've been hearing a lot of rumors

[01:53] about the pricing of these machines.

[01:56] I am now hearing the following price schematic

[02:00] for the Beatles.

[02:01] Okay, are you sitting down?

[02:04] I'm hearing that the cheapest Beatles edition

[02:08] will be $10,000, okay?

[02:12] So that's your Beatles premium.

[02:14] I'm then hearing the next price up

[02:18] will be $18,000 for the limited edition of the Beatles.

[02:24] And then the diamond edition will be known

[02:28] as the diamond 35.

[02:30] They are going to make $100 of them

[02:32] at the price of $35,000.

[02:38] Holy crap, that's the same exact price

[02:41] as a Honda Civic Type R.

[02:43] So what do we think about this pricing?

[02:45] Now look, these price rumors about the Beatles

[02:49] have been all over the map.

[02:51] Everywhere from Joe Kamikaw telling people

[02:54] that it's not going to be as expensive as Batman 66,

[02:58] all the way up to people saying it's going to be $50,000.

[03:03] I find it hard to believe that any brand new pinball machine

[03:09] could actually have enough inside it

[03:12] to be the same price as a Honda Civic Type R, okay?

[03:16] I just, I can't for the life of me fathom

[03:20] spending that much on a pinball machine,

[03:22] but we've seen crazier things

[03:24] because all you have to do is zoom out of the pinball hobby

[03:30] and start zooming into some other collectible hobbies.

[03:34] And all of a sudden $35,000 doesn't even seem like a lot

[03:40] when you start looking at things like watches and wine

[03:44] and automobiles and you name it, classic movie posters

[03:49] if Ted was on the show, he'd be talking about

[03:51] classic movie posters.

[03:53] So do you think that there will be a $35,000

[03:58] Stern pinball machine?

[04:00] Look, I think most people hope not.

[04:03] So here's the thing that I want to talk about

[04:05] when it comes to this because I think there's a lot of ways

[04:07] to skin this whole thing.

[04:09] Do we feel that Beatles collectors, right?

[04:13] Those who collect it, Beatles memorabilia will be attracted

[04:19] to a pinball machine that cost $35,000.

[04:24] We're just gonna use that as a hypothetical cost.

[04:27] We didn't really see Star Wars fans go nuts

[04:30] for the Star Wars pinball machine.

[04:32] Now someone said to me, well, that's because there's already been

[04:36] a few Star Wars pinball machines and this will be the only,

[04:40] I believe the only Beatles pinball machine

[04:43] that has ever come out.

[04:45] So it's got that sort of rarity going forward or exclusivity.

[04:49] Now here's the thing though.

[04:51] I think people collect memorabilia based on franchises

[04:57] and bands and movies that they absolutely love

[05:00] and there's some nostalgia associated

[05:04] with the actual item they collect, okay?

[05:08] So when you look at the definition of memorabilia,

[05:13] it is defined as the following.

[05:16] Objects kept or collected because of their historical interest,

[05:21] especially those associated with memorable people or events,

[05:26] all right?

[05:28] Okay, now my whole thing is this.

[05:31] It's one thing to spend a fortune on,

[05:34] let's say a leather jacket worn by John Lennon

[05:38] or John Lennon's piano or Paul McCartney's guitar.

[05:42] Those things have historical prominence

[05:46] that equals their value,

[05:49] but a brand new pinball machine that comes out in 2018

[05:54] based on the Beatles, you know,

[05:56] paying homage to the Beatles

[05:59] has no historical prominence within the band, okay?

[06:03] This wasn't John Lennon or Paul McCartney

[06:05] or Ringo Star's pinball machine.

[06:08] It's just a brand new item that features the Beatles music.

[06:14] Now that is why I still do not think that people

[06:18] who eat up everything Beatles will run after this item

[06:23] as a piece of Beatles memorabilia

[06:26] and I think it is much different the Beatles

[06:29] and a Beatles pinball machine than what we saw with Supreme

[06:34] and the Supreme pinball machine

[06:35] because Supreme is much different.

[06:37] The entire Supreme fan base that collects Supreme items,

[06:43] they are all about buying the latest

[06:47] and greatest new thing that Supreme puts out in the world.

[06:52] So Supreme is very much a modern phenomenon

[06:55] around collectability.

[06:57] And you know, Supreme puts its name on a Metro card,

[07:00] a Louis Vuitton piece of luggage,

[07:03] a boxing glove, a sneaker, a sweatshirt,

[07:07] a pinball machine, it doesn't matter to Supreme collectors.

[07:11] They literally will collect any of it

[07:13] just to have the rare items.

[07:16] I don't think we're gonna see the level of crossover

[07:21] from Beatles fanatics and collectors

[07:23] to have to have these machines.

[07:26] And again, I think Star Wars is more of an indication

[07:29] of that is Stern overshot with 800 LEs

[07:32] and there really wasn't that kind of interest in it.

[07:36] Also because the game wasn't very good.

[07:39] How many people are talking about playing Star Wars

[07:41] these days?

[07:42] Nobody.

[07:43] There's like this whole thing,

[07:44] I'll talk a little bit later about it,

[07:45] but it's all about how the Stern games

[07:48] that are pretty recent games that you never hear anybody talk

[07:51] about, well let's just talk about it now.

[07:53] When's the last time you heard anyone say anything

[07:56] about Aerosmith?

[07:57] When was the last time you heard anyone say

[07:59] Peep about Kiss?

[08:02] When was the last time you heard anyone even say anything

[08:04] about Guardians of the Galaxy?

[08:07] It is amazing to me.

[08:09] How Stern so effectively creates these small little

[08:13] windows of hype that make everyone

[08:15] rushed to the flame to buy and then a few months later,

[08:19] you never hear anything about the game.

[08:22] They're just forgotten and we're on to the next.

[08:24] Incredible marketing, a super genius approach

[08:28] and they do it time and time again.

[08:30] Will it work for them on the Beatles?

[08:32] Will they be able to do this?

[08:34] Now the other question is, if this is true,

[08:38] if there is a $35,000 version,

[08:42] how do you make a game worth $17,000 more than the $18,000

[08:49] Ellie?

[08:50] So that's the challenge.

[08:52] It's because once you stop redesigning the game,

[08:56] if nothing on the Playfield is changing,

[08:58] let's take Batman Super Ali, for example.

[09:01] If you're not changing the actual game,

[09:03] like there's no difference in code,

[09:04] there's no difference in gameplay,

[09:06] then you have to put thousands of dollars in value

[09:11] or perceived value in things like artwork

[09:14] and things like the speakers and things like the topper

[09:18] and things like the cabinet and things like the armor,

[09:22] all cosmetic stuff.

[09:24] And unless they put super, super expensive,

[09:27] $15,000 speakers in the game, like BMW or Hanson speakers,

[09:33] how are they ever gonna justify that price?

[09:37] And the other thing, ultimately,

[09:40] if you buy a $35,000 pinball machine,

[09:43] there literally will never be room for that machine

[09:46] to go up in value.

[09:47] I just, you're never gonna see this thing appreciate

[09:50] like a rare 9.11 Porsche.

[09:53] Uh, now, now I might seem like a little bit of a hypocrite

[09:57] because I've been saying for a really long time,

[10:00] I don't think anyone has tapped into the premium pinball market.

[10:06] I don't think anyone has fully understood

[10:10] the amount of millionaires out there

[10:12] who do just want the best pinball machine,

[10:15] who do want the greatest pinball machine.

[10:17] The thing is this, and if we're all honest with ourselves,

[10:22] we all know that Stern pinball is not the company capable

[10:28] of making that super high end machine.

[10:34] They just aren't, we saw it with Batman 66.

[10:37] As an owner of the SLE, I can say firsthand,

[10:41] it was absolutely comical.

[10:44] What they put in that machine for $15,000.

[10:48] Now my machine now looks great

[10:49] because I yanked out all the janky Stern toys

[10:52] that they bought off the shell from Walmart.

[10:55] But for the most part, you know, they literally,

[10:59] it went really cheap on a lot of the items

[11:03] and still were able to sell out.

[11:04] And I think that shows one thing.

[11:07] To me, that doesn't, it doesn't prove to me

[11:09] that Stern knows how to make a great premium product.

[11:12] It proves to me that pinball collectors want

[11:15] something expensive and rare, and they were willing to pay for it

[11:19] even if the value wasn't there.

[11:21] So if you're Joe Chemekow and you're George Gomez

[11:24] and you're Gary Stern, you look at that

[11:26] and you say, wow, like we've got a bunch of suckers out there

[11:30] that will buy even if we haven't put in the value.

[11:33] And it always makes me sad to see Stern sell these things.

[11:37] Like really, really, like sell their L.E.s at $9,000.

[11:42] And Jersey Jack is putting so much more into the games

[11:47] and he's pricing them at the same amounts.

[11:51] It's so fucking weird to me that we have people

[11:57] aiming much higher and yet Stern,

[12:00] simply because they can manufacture it,

[12:02] will win and get the money.

[12:05] Because here's the ultimate thing I've learned

[12:07] in this hobby over the last three to four years.

[12:10] Is that this product is an impulse buy that nobody needs

[12:15] and rich men, rich men who have money to burn,

[12:20] they don't wanna wait, they don't want you to string them along.

[12:24] They will go buy something else that they can have tomorrow.

[12:28] If Stern showed up at Expo or at TPS

[12:34] with like 100 beetles, S.L.E.s for $35,000,

[12:40] they would probably sell a lot of them at the show

[12:44] if you could throw them in your truck and take it home.

[12:47] And they said this is the only place you could buy it.

[12:49] We would have people phoning their friends

[12:52] from all over the world, pick me up one.

[12:55] Can you get me one?

[12:57] I mean, literally, that is what would happen

[13:00] simply because you would tell a rich pinball collector

[13:04] you can have it tomorrow and we're not gonna make it

[13:08] and we're not gonna make more than this many.

[13:10] And for some reason, that just triggers I have to have it.

[13:14] All right, okay.

[13:16] But let me also come back to Planet Earth right now.

[13:19] Let me come back to reality.

[13:21] A $35,000 pinball machine is fucking stupid.

[13:24] Okay, let's just stop playing games here.

[13:27] Let's stop being idiots.

[13:29] A $35,000 pinball machine.

[13:32] I mean, it's stupid.

[13:34] It's stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

[13:36] There's no way that game for $35,000 will be a better pinball

[13:41] experience than a $5,000 stern pro.

[13:45] Just no way, a re-skin of seawitch, not gonna do it.

[13:49] Sure, it's gonna have Beatles music,

[13:51] but here's what you could do.

[13:52] You could go buy all the Beatles music.

[13:54] Isn't it also free to listen to?

[13:57] I mean, literally, you could go buy a $35,000 speaker system

[14:03] that would play the Beatles music

[14:05] in the best audio format possible.

[14:08] You'd be better off doing that

[14:11] and then just playing your walking dead

[14:12] as the Beatles music was playing

[14:14] and you turned the sound off and pretended

[14:16] you're playing a Beatles pinball machine.

[14:18] I mean, literally, it's stupid, it's assing in.

[14:21] But also, it's gonna be fun to see

[14:24] where Stern finally prices this game.

[14:28] Personally, I think $35,000 sounds ludicrous,

[14:33] when I see those numbers, when I see those numbers,

[14:37] I would guess, again, we're speculating on the show.

[14:40] I would guess the super-eally of Beatles

[14:43] will be $18,000.

[14:44] I think they take it up a little bit from Batman

[14:47] because it's the Beatles and I would say $18,000

[14:52] for the super-eally, then I think we're gonna see

[14:55] an ELE for like $12,000, like $13,000 or $12,000.

[15:00] And I think we're gonna see the premium at $10.

[15:03] That is my guess.

[15:04] And there's gonna be three art packages

[15:07] and we are gonna, I don't know when we're gonna find this out

[15:10] because if you saw my last show or listen to it,

[15:13] is Elvira 3 gonna be next?

[15:15] Is Stern just fucking with us?

[15:16] And that's gonna be the case.

[15:18] Or will it be Monsters?

[15:20] Or, you know, we know the next three-stern games.

[15:23] Hopefully, maybe, who knows, right?

[15:26] We know Beatles and Monsters for sure.

[15:28] Elvira is the wild card.

[15:30] That's gonna happen in front of those.

[15:33] Okay, so let's go on to our Pinball Expo speculation.

[15:40] Now, I'm not gonna belabor a lot of this

[15:42] because we're gonna go over Expo in a short period of time.

[15:46] In the next few days, we're gonna have a lot of Expo

[15:47] episodes going up.

[15:49] Let's go down the list.

[15:50] I'm gonna open up Pinside and I'm gonna go down

[15:52] the list of manufacturers and I'm gonna tell you

[15:54] what I think is gonna be the show for them.

[15:58] And I also wanna tell you, like,

[16:00] do I think they should even go to the show or not?

[16:02] Because I also think, as you've heard on the show before,

[16:05] going to every show is kind of a waste of money at times

[16:08] if you don't have a reason to be there.

[16:10] All right, so let's start, I'm gonna start

[16:13] with American Pinball because I think American Pinball

[16:16] is probably the main attraction at this year's show.

[16:20] They are coming with October Fest.

[16:22] They are gonna show a brand new game

[16:25] that no one has seen anything on other than

[16:28] a few images of artwork.

[16:30] I love the fact that people called out

[16:33] that the guy in the art package

[16:36] looks just like Todd Tucky from TNT Amusements

[16:39] and people were photoshopping his face onto the image

[16:42] and it looks uncanny.

[16:44] It's kind of incredible.

[16:46] This is gonna be a very big show for American Pinball.

[16:49] We know that Houdini was rushed.

[16:52] They made Houdini as sort of a way to salvage

[16:54] their partnership with J-Pop.

[16:57] Joe Bossard, you know, Josh Kugler,

[16:59] this game has a lot riding on it.

[17:03] I don't think this can be a game that they, you know,

[17:07] missed the mark on.

[17:08] I think they heard the feedback from everyone on Houdini

[17:11] that the game shot too tight,

[17:13] that the game was frustrating more than fun.

[17:16] And I think we see that.

[17:17] I think we see people selling Houdini's already

[17:20] for around $6,000 and see that's the problem.

[17:23] If your game's a myth and people start unloading it,

[17:26] the problem is now distributors will stop ordering new

[17:30] Houdinis because there are still Houdinis sitting new in box.

[17:34] But why would I go buy one of those

[17:35] when I can get a low-play one for,

[17:37] and save myself a thousand, 1500 bucks,

[17:40] and that price is gonna keep going down.

[17:42] And we know that once October Fest comes out,

[17:45] if it has what they've been saying it will have,

[17:48] which is even more magic and more cool shit in it,

[17:51] then Houdini and it will shoot better.

[17:54] The prices on Houdini are gonna absolutely tank.

[17:58] So that's just the nature of improvement.

[18:02] People want the new thing.

[18:04] I still think the title is gonna be a difficult one

[18:08] to win people over, so the game's gonna have to be incredible.

[18:11] But a very big show for them.

[18:13] The other thing that I'm gonna be curious to see they talk about,

[18:17] and I think this was a mistake to reveal this,

[18:20] is they revealed to the world

[18:22] that they are gonna set up another line

[18:25] where they can make other people's home-brew games

[18:29] and distribute them from American Pimball.

[18:31] Very much like Charlie set up another line

[18:33] to make total annihilation.

[18:36] Now the reason why I think this is a mistake,

[18:38] and I hope all Pimball companies out there

[18:40] listen to this advice right now.

[18:43] There is a reason why Stern Pimball

[18:47] has like over 90% of the market.

[18:49] There is a reason why Stern Pimball

[18:52] creates the hype they do during each and every launch.

[18:56] There's a reason why Stern Pimball is so successful,

[18:59] and it's not just their manufacturing.

[19:01] It's also the fact that Stern Pimball

[19:04] keeps their trade secrets to themselves.

[19:09] They don't reveal their business plans

[19:12] to the rest of the world early on.

[19:15] They don't talk, they don't tell you jack shit.

[19:19] They understand that this industry

[19:23] has become very competitive,

[19:25] and if you let people know your plans too early on,

[19:30] it will destroy your ability to create hype

[19:34] and surprise and curiosity,

[19:37] which are the things you need to grab people's money

[19:41] in this hobby because it is an impulse by,

[19:46] I don't really need it kind of item.

[19:48] And everyone keeps fucking up.

[19:50] There is no reason why American Pimball

[19:52] should have told anybody they were doing this

[19:54] until they had built that game that they were gonna build

[19:59] and revealed it right before the game was ready to ship.

[20:02] Because now I'm already hearing,

[20:04] I'm already hearing that American Pimball

[20:07] has secured the rights to make a nightmare before Christmas

[20:13] and is going to make that their first homebrew game

[20:16] that they release.

[20:18] And I'm not sure if that's true or not,

[20:20] but see now the problem is this.

[20:22] Now the problem is that they showed their cards

[20:25] on that second line.

[20:26] It's not hard for people to go look at the homebrew games

[20:29] that have been shopped around

[20:30] and look at the ones that are the most complete

[20:32] and then make a very educated guess

[20:36] on which one it's gonna be.

[20:38] And I think people need to learn this lesson.

[20:41] And then person who started doing this all wrong was Chuck.

[20:45] You know Chuck's funny to me

[20:47] because he thinks everyone should just be collaborative.

[20:49] Like he thinks like competing companies

[20:52] should be collaborative in Pimball

[20:55] because they should work together to get more people

[20:58] to play Pimball.

[20:58] And you know what happened to Chuck and that belief

[21:02] is Chuck went around telling everyone

[21:04] that he was gonna do Godzilla

[21:06] and because he kept running his mouth about Godzilla

[21:10] stern went and fucking stole it from him.

[21:13] Stole it right out from underneath him.

[21:16] They probably did the same thing with monsters

[21:18] because Charlie talks,

[21:20] there is no way in a million years

[21:23] that stern ever wanted to make some obscure Godzilla license

[21:27] but they knew because Charlie was talking

[21:30] that their competitor was gonna make it.

[21:32] And then they flex their marketing muscle

[21:35] and yanked it right away from him.

[21:37] That's how business works.

[21:40] Look, I like it when Pimball companies

[21:43] are competing to beat each other.

[21:45] When they're competing to send each other out of business

[21:49] because that's how you get to better products Charlie.

[21:51] It's how you get to better products Jack.

[21:54] It's how you get to better products George.

[21:56] It is a good thing that stern should be nervous

[22:00] that someone's gonna make a game better than them.

[22:02] That someone can figure out manufacturing as well as them.

[22:05] Okay, that just leads to better Pimball.

[22:07] It leads to better products.

[22:09] Okay, all right, a little bit of a tangent there.

[22:13] So big show for American Pimball.

[22:15] Will they talk about the separate line?

[22:17] I don't think so.

[22:18] All lives are gonna be on October fest.

[22:20] I look forward to seeing it.

[22:21] All right, let's go to our next company.

[22:23] Let's go to, do, do, do, do, do, do.

[22:26] Let's go to stern.

[22:27] Okay, so stern is going to make this show all about Deadpool.

[22:32] And I heard from someone over at stern

[22:34] and here's why.

[22:35] Deadpool premiums are just hitting the line right now.

[22:40] Stern cannot show up at Expo with any other title

[22:45] but Deadpool to talk about because the way Stern operates,

[22:50] they have a production line where they need orders

[22:56] and they need manufacturing to align at the same time.

[22:59] And right now they need to fulfill

[23:02] all the Deadpool orders for distributors

[23:04] that have come in and they need to keep the focus 100% on that.

[23:08] They can't have people seeing something new

[23:10] and canceling Deadpool orders.

[23:12] So you will see nothing new from Stern at Expo.

[23:15] Nothing, nothing.

[23:17] They can't do it.

[23:18] They're manufacturing the people who run the company

[23:21] would kill them if they took the wind out

[23:24] of the Deadpool order sales right now.

[23:26] So we're gonna see nothing.

[23:28] I wouldn't expect to see anything from Stern, all right?

[23:31] Anything.

[23:32] Until probably I would say like,

[23:37] I mean I was guessing Halloween but that's close.

[23:39] I would say like,

[23:42] you know, early in November to mid-November,

[23:44] maybe like a month from now.

[23:46] So expect this to be a little bit of a letdown from Stern

[23:49] if you're expecting to see something on monsters,

[23:51] beetles, or Elvira.

[23:53] They might tease something but I doubt it.

[23:55] I just don't think you're gonna see anything.

[23:57] And it's kind of crazy to me that Stern has like four hours,

[24:01] four hours of seminar time blocked out

[24:04] to talk about what?

[24:06] Why do we have to hear from Steve Richie again?

[24:10] You know, it's like, I get it.

[24:12] You're making high speed three, we get it,

[24:15] or they get away, whatever.

[24:16] You're making your third version,

[24:18] or is it black night 3000, I get it.

[24:19] You're gonna make a sequel to one of your original titles.

[24:24] It still will never make up for Star Wars.

[24:26] No, I kid.

[24:27] Look, look, these are pinball designers.

[24:29] It's a pinball show.

[24:30] I'm actually joking with you guys when I say,

[24:32] like, I don't wanna hear from these designers.

[24:35] It is always nice to hear from them,

[24:38] but we're just not gonna hear new stuff from Stern, all right?

[24:41] All right, let's go on to multi-morphic.

[24:45] Jerry will be there because Jerry is at every show

[24:48] for the last seven years.

[24:52] You know, still curious to see how manufacturing's going.

[24:56] He's gotta be looking at this whole pinball market

[24:59] and being like, fuck, like, fuck.

[25:02] I spent seven years rethinking pinball

[25:08] and total nuclear annihilation, a single level game,

[25:13] sold 550 units, and I'm on unit number 50,

[25:19] seven years.

[25:21] Seven years from now, Scott Denithi will be on game number

[25:24] like four and keep making money.

[25:29] Jerry, gotta get the theme on that thing that moves it.

[25:33] You know it, you know I love you, brother.

[25:34] I love people who are ambitious, but man,

[25:39] gotta get a title that finally gets that game moving

[25:42] and everything everyone agrees with that.

[25:44] All right, all right, what else is spooky pinball?

[25:48] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle at Expo.

[25:51] I'm not, it's Chuck Goen at Expo.

[25:53] Sometimes they don't always go.

[25:55] I think Charlie, if he goes, it'll be to let people play

[25:58] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[26:00] You know, I don't really know why most of the spots

[26:02] are probably spoken for.

[26:04] People are finally starting to get some games,

[26:07] but I think most of these games are going to operators

[26:10] right now.

[26:12] You know, and look, we're gonna get the obligatory.

[26:16] I just got at my Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[26:18] and it's the greatest game ever.

[26:20] I don't know what people are talking about.

[26:21] Every shot is makeable.

[26:22] Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

[26:24] Look, look.

[26:25] We hear the same thing from everyone who's a new buyer.

[26:29] Everyone who bought Deadpool, it's the greatest game ever.

[26:31] Everyone who bought pirates, it's the greatest game ever.

[26:33] Everyone who's gonna buy Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle

[26:35] is gonna justify that's the greatest game ever.

[26:37] Then two months go by and you see,

[26:39] hey, Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle for sale, 37 plays.

[26:42] I'm so hesitant to list it for sale,

[26:44] but hey, you know, I hardly played it, it's great.

[26:47] I need to make space for something else.

[26:48] Yeah, it's the same fucking cycle in this hobby every time.

[26:53] I've played Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[26:55] I want you to play it.

[26:57] I hope to get more people's feedback on it.

[26:59] I don't think there's any denying the fact

[27:02] that there's a lot of shots that are tight.

[27:03] There's a lot of bricks in the game.

[27:06] You know, it's all, everything's like a post.

[27:08] They're not targets.

[27:10] Everything, like every time you're a little bit off

[27:12] on a shot, post, back.

[27:13] And that's why it bricks.

[27:15] That's why it bricks.

[27:17] I love the castle, gray skull looking castle.

[27:20] It does cover a lot of the play field.

[27:22] Like the ball disappears in the top,

[27:25] you know, one third of the play field

[27:27] because of that monster castle.

[27:29] It is cool looking.

[27:31] I'm not gonna get on this show and say like

[27:34] this whole game is a miss for Chuck.

[27:36] I mean, I think the game is really cool looking.

[27:38] You know, are there 500 Alice Cooper

[27:40] and Nightmare Castle fans out there?

[27:42] I mean, apparently it seems there is.

[27:46] I still think people are not gonna wanna wait 18 months

[27:50] to get these games.

[27:51] I think the delay did not help them at all.

[27:53] I think revealing it at Expo was absolutely ass night

[27:57] because think about it like this.

[27:58] Imagine if Charlie didn't reveal

[28:00] Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle at T.P.F.

[28:03] Okay, let's imagine a world where he doesn't do that.

[28:05] And then he shows up at Expo, right?

[28:10] He's got TNA in the line the whole time.

[28:13] All summer long, he's making money on TNAs.

[28:15] He shows up at Expo with Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[28:19] done in box has 25 of them and says the first 25 are here

[28:25] to go, these are founders, additions, whatever.

[28:27] And then they're on the line.

[28:29] So place your order now, non-refundable 1000

[28:31] and we're gonna build yours.

[28:32] He would sell, he would sell them.

[28:35] He would sell them.

[28:36] And he would also sell them without making

[28:38] people wait eight months.

[28:39] He would have a better reveal.

[28:41] The reveal at T.P.F. was so bad.

[28:43] The game was barely even, there's no code in it.

[28:47] Why would you show your game so incomplete?

[28:52] What's the point?

[28:53] Like he didn't need to lock in those deposits

[28:55] because he had TNA sales left and right.

[28:57] So it just made no sense.

[28:59] I think he's learned the lesson.

[29:00] I think we're all gonna learn lessons in this hobby.

[29:03] Show your game when you're ready to ship your game.

[29:06] If you don't do it that way, you're stupid.

[29:10] Like it said, Tony Montana, you're stupid

[29:12] in terms of marketing if you do it any other way, all right?

[29:16] So are we gonna see anything from Scott Dinesi game number two?

[29:19] Maybe he teases something.

[29:22] He can tease something.

[29:23] The thing is, Scott doesn't need to be like worry

[29:25] that he's gonna cannibalize Alice Cooper sales

[29:27] because Chuck locked people in.

[29:29] So I think there's gonna be a little bit more freedom there.

[29:31] All right, let's go on to Jersey Jack Pimball.

[29:37] Jersey Jack is gonna be at the show.

[29:40] He's gonna do his presentation with Eric

[29:42] and the team at Jersey Jack.

[29:44] And look, Pirates is just shipping.

[29:46] And unlike Alice Cooper's nightmare,

[29:48] Castle Jack needs to sell a lot of pirates to the caribans

[29:52] and he's going to be able to,

[29:55] you know, he's gonna, he doesn't have a limited run.

[29:59] You know, he's only making 250 collectors additions

[30:02] but then he's got a thousand LEDs

[30:04] and then he's got the standards

[30:05] and we all know Jack is gonna make another addition

[30:08] once the LEDs sell out.

[30:10] If they do sell out,

[30:12] I just don't see this game selling out

[30:15] and I'll tell you why.

[30:16] And this just hurt Jack.

[30:19] Is unlike Stern, you know, Jack's delay was just crippling.

[30:22] It's been 12 months since he revealed this game.

[30:25] The hype is kind of dead.

[30:27] This doesn't mean it's not a great game for people.

[30:30] I'm hearing from owners that they love the game.

[30:33] And that's great, but it doesn't matter

[30:37] if your game is great a year after reveal.

[30:41] Like there's another game that I'm hearing

[30:45] is so fucking good right now

[30:48] that everyone needs to rethink it.

[30:50] And I have to say this,

[30:52] I've never had so many people come to me and say,

[30:56] look, I get it and you were right

[30:59] when you talked about this game at the beginning

[31:01] but if you play this game now,

[31:04] this game has sort of like under the radar,

[31:08] constantly been polished and improved

[31:10] to the fact where it is probably now.

[31:13] One of the greatest theme integrated pins of all time.

[31:17] And if you look at the price they're selling for now,

[31:20] it is unfuckin' believable

[31:23] that you can go get a Hobbit limited edition

[31:27] or smalg edition for roughly around $6 to $6,500.

[31:32] That game knew it was $8,500.

[31:36] And a Hobbit, if you put a Hobbit

[31:39] next to a Deadpool premium

[31:42] or put a Hobbit next to a total nuclear annihilation,

[31:46] right, put a Hobbit next to a TNA

[31:48] and say you could get these for the same price right now.

[31:52] It's unbelievable.

[31:54] To the point now,

[31:56] we're all even thinking to myself,

[32:00] maybe it's time to get a Hobbit.

[32:02] And literally, now what sucks for Jack

[32:06] is no one's gonna go buy an $8,500 Black Arrow edition.

[32:09] Like he's not gonna sell more new Hobbits

[32:12] because there are so many pristine

[32:15] and beautiful Hobbits out there

[32:17] that you can get for sale.

[32:19] And it just goes to show

[32:20] when you don't make the game magical.

[32:25] And you make people wait too long.

[32:28] A game can become amazing,

[32:31] but it'll never equate to more sales down the road.

[32:34] I don't think a lot of people

[32:35] are buying Batman 66s.

[32:37] I don't.

[32:38] I think the bad taste that left in people's mouths

[32:41] have led to a freeze on sales.

[32:43] And people are just like, yeah, cool, fine.

[32:45] They still approach it with negative sentiment.

[32:49] The same thing will happen to pirates the Caribbean.

[32:52] I'm sure it's gonna turn out to be a great game.

[32:55] I'm sure people in a home environment

[32:58] are gonna play that game and absolutely love it

[33:02] because it's got the kind of depth

[33:03] that you can only appreciate in a home environment.

[33:07] And you really need to study the rules and it's complex.

[33:09] It's not a game you can walk up

[33:11] and have immediate fun or know what you're doing.

[33:13] And that's the thing that ails me when I play it.

[33:16] Is I go to a bar with 20 bucks

[33:17] and I'm like, I just feel it's so confusing to me.

[33:20] And I'm sorry, I just don't want to tutorial

[33:22] or like a novel to figure a game out.

[33:25] I also don't care about the theme.

[33:27] I don't love the animations on it

[33:29] compared to the animations on the Hobbit

[33:31] and on Dialed In.

[33:33] And so I just think it's a miss for me.

[33:35] And just theme alone.

[33:36] I just don't care about the theme.

[33:38] And theme is very important.

[33:41] So I just don't think Hobbit's gonna be that successful.

[33:43] And the other thing that's gonna really make sales hard

[33:46] is everybody knows that Willy Wonka is next.

[33:50] And that's the problem that Jack has is

[33:53] his secrets have been let out.

[33:55] And the reason why a lot of them got out

[33:57] is he just waited too long.

[33:59] People left the company, people talked.

[34:01] But you know who talks the most?

[34:03] You know who talks the most?

[34:05] Jack himself.

[34:07] Jack tells people when he goes over their houses

[34:11] or has parties or travels to Australia,

[34:14] he tells people what he's making.

[34:17] I know Jersey Jack's next games.

[34:19] I've heard them all from like a variety of people.

[34:21] And you all know them too.

[34:22] We'll do a separate what's next from JJP show.

[34:25] But all that does is freeze people from jumping in

[34:30] with each new title.

[34:32] Okay, and that's not smart.

[34:34] All right, let's go on.

[34:35] So Jersey Jack's gonna have pirates there.

[34:37] We're not gonna see anything on Willy Wonka.

[34:40] Expect to see it be all about pirates of the Caribbean.

[34:43] All right, all right, what do we got?

[34:45] We've got Chicago gaming company.

[34:47] Monster Bash remake, will it be there?

[34:50] It has to fucking be there.

[34:52] This game is the worst kept secret ever.

[34:55] It has to be there.

[34:57] This is, it's their backyard.

[34:59] They're called Chicago Gaming Company.

[35:02] It's Chicago Expo 2018.

[35:05] All right, if they don't show up with their game

[35:09] after the huge delay from TPS,

[35:12] I mean, let's, it's gonna happen.

[35:15] I also think this game is going to,

[35:18] it's gonna be received, I think Luke Warmer at this stage.

[35:22] I do.

[35:23] I think people will be like, cool, Monster Bash is great.

[35:26] It is a great game.

[35:27] There is nothing they have to do differently.

[35:31] The game is great.

[35:32] They remade a great game.

[35:34] You are never gonna hear me say Monster Bash isn't good.

[35:37] Don't ever let the other podcast,

[35:40] because I've been letting some of these other dingbats

[35:42] like get into my head who say like,

[35:43] the game is no depth, the game is no depth.

[35:45] The game is perfectly balanced.

[35:47] It is perfectly balanced.

[35:49] And everyone who appreciates Pimbal knows that.

[35:53] It might be boring to a few tournament players

[35:57] who can get through it quicker than others,

[36:00] but how many of you out there are that good?

[36:02] Okay, so that's my point.

[36:05] But I also think this game's coming out

[36:08] and people have played it for 20 years.

[36:11] And a lot of the collectors, I know they already have a Monster Bash.

[36:14] So are they really gonna sell their Monster Bash

[36:16] as to go get the new one?

[36:18] I don't know.

[36:19] And a lot of the new guys, I just think they're into the new stuff.

[36:22] So I think Monster Bash is gonna be a cool game.

[36:24] I just don't think it's going to sell

[36:27] as well as medieval mannested or attacked from Mars.

[36:31] Because again, I just think there's more games out there now

[36:36] than there was when this company thought they could just be

[36:39] like a thorn and stern side.

[36:41] And now I think they have a lot more competition.

[36:44] And people will always want the new games.

[36:46] All right, who am I missing?

[36:47] We got, let's see.

[36:50] Let's go to Deeproot Pimbal.

[36:53] Deeproot Pimbal will be there.

[36:55] I've got nine minutes left on my battery life.

[36:58] So you're gonna get nine more minutes of a podcast or less.

[37:02] So the thing with Deeproot is they're coming there.

[37:04] Roberts moderating the panel and they're gonna talk.

[37:08] It's gonna be the first time we see J-Pop there

[37:10] in a long time.

[37:11] I think we're gonna not see people bring out the pitch forks

[37:15] like they always threaten to do.

[37:18] It's probably smart that Roberts moderating this.

[37:20] He'll keep the peace.

[37:22] Here's my advice for Deeproot.

[37:25] And I really hope they take this advice.

[37:29] I just wouldn't show anything.

[37:31] I don't even know why they're there to be honest.

[37:34] And if I'm a Robert, why show up to Expo?

[37:38] You've got your five days of Deeproot.

[37:41] You are now going up on stage to do what?

[37:44] You're gonna talk about something

[37:47] that you should not reveal this early.

[37:50] You're not doing pre-order dollars.

[37:52] You don't need people's money.

[37:56] You have this air of curiosity around your company

[38:01] that is super valuable to maintain.

[38:04] And also, I think the biggest mistake

[38:08] is bringing John Papaduke out in public.

[38:10] And I'll explain why.

[38:12] What good does that do your company?

[38:15] Nobody needs to forgive him.

[38:17] Nobody needs to like see him.

[38:19] Nobody needs to hear from him.

[38:21] And again, this is not me being mean to John.

[38:24] I mean, maybe make a spectacle of it

[38:26] and you could wheel him out like he's Hannibal Lecter,

[38:29] like in a straight jacket on a dolly.

[38:33] But the thing is this,

[38:35] everyone knows why J. Pop failed.

[38:38] Everyone is willing to forgive John

[38:42] if people are made whole on the games and the money he took.

[38:46] But the thing, the other part is, look,

[38:49] he doesn't do any good for your publicly facing

[38:51] company.

[38:52] I work for companies all the time, Robert,

[38:53] multi-billion dollar companies where if their executive

[38:56] is not good or might say stuff that people don't want

[38:58] or it is like a vitriolic or bipolar individual,

[39:02] you don't put him out there in public.

[39:05] I think it's more valuable for DeepRuch

[39:07] to just tell the world, we've got a John Papaduke.

[39:10] It's like we've got a cave troll.

[39:11] Like you've got J. Pop and he's locked

[39:13] in the basement of DeepRuch in Texas

[39:15] and his whole job is to come up with crazy ideas.

[39:18] To me, that's the way I would tell people

[39:20] you have a J. Pop.

[39:21] I just wouldn't have him out there.

[39:23] And so I know they're excited.

[39:26] I know there's a lot of enthusiasm at DeepRuch

[39:29] and I'm excited for these guys.

[39:30] I can't wait to see these guys.

[39:32] But I would just caution them not to talk too much too soon.

[39:38] Maybe this is day one of the five days of DeepRuch.

[39:41] I don't know.

[39:42] But I think they should really figure out

[39:48] how they're gonna get manufacturing of these exciting titles

[39:52] are working on because I think the day they show you a game

[39:56] is the day that game should be in a box

[39:58] ready to go to somebody.

[40:00] I think if they do a reveal that is months

[40:05] ahead of manufacturing, they're gonna fall

[40:08] into the same trap that everyone falls into.

[40:12] It's one thing to make a prototype

[40:14] that you're excited about.

[40:16] It's another thing.

[40:18] When you get 500 orders for that prototype

[40:21] and you have to actually get people their games, okay?

[40:25] I'm rooting for these companies.

[40:27] I'm deep rooting for them.

[40:28] But I want them to do it right.

[40:30] And I think there's enough examples

[40:32] of how to do it right.

[40:34] But I think what cripples all of these new companies.

[40:38] It's one thing.

[40:39] It's one thing that makes Chuck get up there

[40:42] at T.P.F. eight months before he knows his game is ready.

[40:45] It's one thing that makes Jack get up there

[40:48] 12 months before it's ready.

[40:51] 12 months, he knew he had engineering issues.

[40:54] He knew the line wasn't anywhere near ready.

[40:57] You know, it's one thing that had J-Pop

[40:59] taking everyone's dollars.

[41:00] It's one thing, okay?

[41:04] It's ego.

[41:06] Ego is the most dangerous thing in this hobby.

[41:09] Ego leads these men to feel like they need to be on stage

[41:15] with a mic telling you all the great things they're going to do

[41:19] because they love the attention

[41:22] and they love the paths on the back they get

[41:25] and they love the limelight.

[41:27] A barriany op.

[41:28] Ego driven people.

[41:30] Andrew Highway, Ego driven.

[41:32] Andrew Highway told people he was going to make 500 games a month

[41:35] before he ever made a single game.

[41:38] He announced alien before he even had a white wood.

[41:41] Ego because everyone's like you're amazing, Andrew.

[41:44] You're incredible.

[41:46] Can't wait to see it.

[41:47] Awesome job.

[41:49] You know who doesn't?

[41:51] Flash Ego?

[41:53] Gary Stern.

[41:54] When's the last time you saw Gary Stern

[41:58] trying to get accolades and limelight and the mic.

[42:03] You know where Gary Stern is at?

[42:05] He's at the bank, caching checks for millions of dollars, Chico.

[42:11] You know George Gomez, hear him talk.

[42:13] It's never Ego.

[42:15] He's never over promising.

[42:18] I mean, as I say that of someone's going to be like,

[42:20] well, George Gomez promised custom call outs in Batman SLE.

[42:25] But look, I think George Gomez to me

[42:29] has the right mindset for this business

[42:32] because yes, you need a little bit of Ego

[42:35] and you need to have some desire to bury your competition

[42:38] in any business.

[42:39] But I think what George does right,

[42:42] and I think what he does right with his team at Stern,

[42:46] is he cracks the whip and makes sure

[42:49] that his company is locked down, keeps their trade secrets tight,

[42:55] focuses on the schedule, focuses on the bomb,

[42:59] focuses on getting the game made when we need to get it made,

[43:03] to get it out the door to move on to the next game

[43:06] that we're excited to make.

[43:07] And he drives that machine and you gotta be impressed by that.

[43:12] Everyone else, you know, takes credit

[43:14] for being so creative and collaborative,

[43:16] and then what happens?

[43:18] They string you along for months and years,

[43:20] games come out, yada, yada, yada.

[43:23] The Stern do everything perfect, absolutely not.

[43:27] But you gotta give them credit.

[43:29] Without them, none of these other companies

[43:31] would even be around, all right?

[43:34] So the Ego is the killer man.

[43:35] It kills people in this hobby.

[43:38] Am I missing anybody?

[43:39] Let's see, I think I've hit everybody.

[43:41] My battery's about to die.

[43:44] Multi-mortar fishery gaming dutch.

[43:45] There's no dutch news.

[43:46] Come on guys, it's over.

[43:48] Stick a fork in it.

[43:49] I hope Barry and Yop will sell the game

[43:53] to American Pinball to make on their line.

[43:56] I think that would be a smart move.

[44:00] Do do do do do do do do do do do.

[44:03] I feel like I'm gonna like forget someone

[44:04] and they're gonna get mad at me.

[44:06] I, you know, like we got like the pinball circus guys

[44:09] making King Pin, what a great reveal they did.

[44:13] Five years from now, we'll probably get

[44:15] one of those games out the door.

[44:17] Two guys in a garage, cool, you're making it.

[44:19] Why'd you tell people about it?

[44:21] Makes no sense.

[44:22] Cool, pointless, bad marketing.

[44:25] Once again, in the pinball world.

[44:27] You know, guys, super simple.

[44:30] Make your fucking game, okay?

[44:32] Make your game.

[44:33] Then show it, then take money.

[44:35] Then profit.

[44:36] That's how you do it.

[44:37] Have a good day, everybody.

[44:38] We'll talk to you real soon.

[44:39] ???
