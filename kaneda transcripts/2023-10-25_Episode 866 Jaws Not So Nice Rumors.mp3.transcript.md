[00:00] Say it ain't so.

[00:05] Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it.

[00:30] I'm hearing that the art package on the game is not great.

[00:37] And I'm hearing that when people saw the artwork they asked Stern Pimbal, is this the final

[00:42] or is this just like a prototype of what you're thinking about doing and it is the final art package on the game.

[00:49] So you're hearing it here first.

[00:51] Now who did the art package for this game?

[00:53] Is it Randy Martinez or is it the artist that did Rush Pimbal?

[00:57] Either way, Randy's specialty is Star Wars.

[01:01] I know he did one picture of Jaws and go look at that picture with Jaws and the Orca, the boat that's in the movie,

[01:08] and that picture like it's just kind of flat.

[01:11] And that's my thing is like, is Stern Pimbal once again going to just assign these games to who's up on the roster?

[01:20] Or did they pick an artist that's right for the game?

[01:23] Well, I'm telling you right now, I'm hearing the art package is not good.

[01:26] And now this is kind of unfortunate.

[01:28] We're going to get a Keith Elwyn game that everybody is super excited to get and the art package could be let down.

[01:35] And look, we all know this, that the artwork is really important to get right.

[01:40] And we've had so much beautiful artwork from Zambietti, from Christopher Franchi, Guns N' Roses looks beautiful.

[01:46] There's been a lot of great artwork.

[01:48] And then we got stuff like Rush.

[01:50] It was like, eh, that looks pretty bad.

[01:52] Star Wars was alright, but I don't think Randy Martinez is the right artist for Jaws.

[01:57] We all know who the right artist is.

[01:59] It's Christopher Franchi, who by the way I heard at the Expo panel, is still blaming me for his termination at Stern Pimbal.

[02:07] Oh, you know, I don't know, it wasn't really me who started selling artwork he wasn't supposed to at the shows.

[02:13] And Gary Stern saw him and flipped out.

[02:15] He was selling Beatles artwork.

[02:17] He seems to forget that.

[02:18] Everybody blame Canada.

[02:20] He's the big, bad, toxic guy in the hobby.

[02:22] The other thing I'm hearing about Jaws Pimbal is it doesn't have any of the major assets from the movie.

[02:28] You're not going to get Roy Schneider's character from the movie.

[02:31] And that whole movie revolves around him.

[02:33] And so if you remove him and all of those iconic scenes that he's in, and all you get is maybe call-outs from Richard Dreyfus.

[02:42] I don't think they're going to show any movie clips on that LCD screen.

[02:47] And now think about it.

[02:49] You want Jaws Pimbal if it's like Jurassic Park.

[02:52] It's a lot easier in Jurassic Park to do what they did because you're dealing with mostly dinosaurs.

[02:57] But Jaws is mostly a story about humans, not the shark.

[03:02] So if they remove all of those scenes, I keep thinking about the scenes where he's on the beach and he sees the shark fin

[03:08] and you zoom in on his face and all that tension is building as he's running through the beach

[03:13] and telling everybody to get out of the water and all those scenes in the boat.

[03:16] How are you going to make Jaws Pimbal without Roy Schneider saying,

[03:19] Smile you son of a B-I-T-C-H?

[03:22] And we heard from Jersey Jack years ago that the reason he passed on Jaws

[03:26] was the fact that there are no assets available to make the game the right way.

[03:31] It's funny that Jack said that because he makes so many games without the right assets and doesn't make them the right way.

[03:36] But you know what I mean.

[03:38] So now we might have a Jaws game with no assets and terrible artwork.

[03:43] Can Keith Elwin's layout save a game that might not be living up to our expectations?

[03:49] And the thing about it is this people remember, when Godzilla came out it was $10,500.

[03:55] It was the first $10,500 game and it was loaded.

[03:59] It had every single asset and our expectations of Godzilla were very low.

[04:04] So when the game came out, it's not like all these Godzilla fans were mad

[04:08] and they didn't see the assets they wanted to see.

[04:11] They saw every single asset they wanted in that Godzilla machine.

[04:15] So then you take Jaws which is now $13,000 for an LE

[04:20] and supposedly there's going to be an SLE for like $20,000

[04:24] and are you going to be able to charge that much money without movie assets,

[04:28] without the talent from the movie doing call outs?

[04:31] How are you going to charge that much money if the artwork is not up to snuff

[04:35] with where we're seeing Pimbal machines these days?

[04:37] I mean look at the beautiful artwork on Elton John and they can't even sell that game.

[04:42] And so this is going to be a very interesting moment for Stern Pimbal

[04:46] if Jaws comes out and is not like an instant sell out.

[04:50] If Jaws comes out and everyone is like,

[04:52] well I'm not going to buy it right now,

[04:54] if I just wait the price will go down,

[04:56] which has been the case for every single Pimbal machine that has come out after Godzilla.

[05:01] So we shall see what happens.

[05:03] I also think Stern is burning its consumer base.

[05:06] I think people are watching Stern remake all these games.

[05:09] All that's going to do is make people hesitant to jump back in to Stern Pimbal.

[05:14] And this is the problem with all of Pimbal these days.

[05:16] If these companies keep burning all of the consumers that kept these companies in business

[05:21] all of these years, there's going to be nobody left.

[05:24] And if all of the second hand games become the better buy,

[05:27] then who's going to buy new and box?

[05:29] Everyone's just going to wait for a game to take a depreciative hit

[05:32] and then you swoop in and you buy the game for $2,000 to $3,000 less.

[05:35] The same year the game came out.

[05:37] Let me repeat that. The same year the game came out.

[05:40] It's not like you have to wait four or five years to get a good deal.

[05:43] You're going to get a great deal in four or five months.

[05:46] And if you just go to the gym three days a week for 20 minutes a day,

[05:49] you're going to live much longer and you'll be able to survive

[05:52] and buy these games for less money.

[05:54] Another crazy thing I heard from Pimbal Expo, and it wasn't it funny?

[05:57] It's like, Canada's Pimbal podcast covered Pimbal Expo more

[06:01] than the Pimbal podcasters who were at the freaking show.

[06:04] Like maybe I just hang back now and just cover this hobby

[06:07] and do everybody's job for them.

[06:09] I heard from a very reliable source who's tapped into all the distributors.

[06:13] I heard that Barrels of Fun's Labyrinth sold two to one over Elton John.

[06:18] Two to one. The Labyrinth beat out Elton John orders two to one.

[06:24] And we know they sold all 150 of those games directly.

[06:28] And I'm hearing nothing but great things about this company

[06:31] and the game and the sales of this game.

[06:33] And I also heard that this game is just beginning

[06:36] what they're going to put into this game from a code standpoint

[06:39] and a light show standpoint and an experiential standpoint.

[06:42] So congratulations again to Barrels of Fun,

[06:45] a brand new company who marches into Pimbal Expo with machines in boxes

[06:50] and shows Jersey Jack Pimbal how to do it.

[06:53] They freaking won up Jersey Jack Pimbal,

[06:55] who's been in Pimbal for over a decade,

[06:57] who got beat by a startup company

[07:00] that is embarrassing.

[07:02] This startup company beat a billionaire at his own game, embarrassing.

[07:06] So where does Elton John go now?

[07:08] I was wondering about this the last like 48 hours.

[07:11] I've been reading the thread.

[07:12] Iceman is backing the game big time now,

[07:15] which is a recipe for disasters.

[07:16] I mean, every time he backs a game, it always ends up being a failure.

[07:19] I don't think this game is ever going to have a sales turnaround.

[07:22] And I talked to more people at the show and they said, Chris,

[07:25] look, the game is beautiful.

[07:26] The game shoots really well.

[07:28] But the main problem in the game, we haven't even talked about the code.

[07:31] Someone said to me, the main problem in this game is there's no objective.

[07:35] There's no storyline.

[07:36] There's nothing to do in the game.

[07:38] The objectives of the game are not really there.

[07:41] They're not drawn out.

[07:42] Like if you love Foo Fighters, you're not going to like this game.

[07:45] If you like Iron Maiden, you're not going to like this game.

[07:48] And I think it's more about like a glorified jukebox.

[07:51] It's like that's Jersey Jack's new strategy

[07:53] and all the Elton John clips mashed up with photos.

[07:57] It's all over the place.

[07:58] And I heard from someone who's very, very, very, very much in love with Jersey Jack.

[08:02] And he said, when you play the game, it's like John Paul to win

[08:06] just through all this stuff together and it doesn't really have any meaning.

[08:10] It doesn't really make any sense.

[08:12] It's like all of these Elton John assets just coming at you in this kaleidoscope way.

[08:17] And that's it.

[08:18] Like that's it.

[08:19] And look, we know it makes for like a spectacular first impression,

[08:23] but will owning this game be a lot of long term fun for people?

[08:26] I don't know.

[08:27] And I don't know where they go now.

[08:28] Like what's next?

[08:29] How are they going to get hype back into this game?

[08:32] Speaking about what's next, here's the other thing.

[08:35] David Fix is in big trouble.

[08:36] I've been hearing that American Pinball will not make its next game,

[08:40] which I rumored it to be Cuphead.

[08:42] They will not be making Ryan McQuade's game

[08:45] unless David Fix sells all of the galactic tank forces.

[08:50] And here's the other rumor.

[08:51] There are 300 left to be sold.

[08:54] I think they've sold 200 to date because they ordered 500 parts for galactic tank forces first run.

[09:01] And that is why you are seeing on the walls at American Pinball,

[09:05] the 300 banner from the movie,

[09:07] because that's a rally cry for this company to sell 300 more games.

[09:12] And I heard they have to do this by January 1st,

[09:15] but I think American Pinball is hanging on by a thread.

[09:19] I think if there's any company that could go under in the next six months,

[09:22] it is American Pinball.

[09:24] And with all these new games that just came out,

[09:26] how are they ever going to get people interested in this old game

[09:29] that didn't excite people when it originally came out?

[09:32] Gang, it's going to get real brutal.

[09:34] The battleground is now set.

[09:36] All of these games are overpriced.

[09:38] Only the games that are great themes that you really want to own will you buy Newenbox.

[09:43] Otherwise, you're going to wait and see.

[09:45] Smaller distributors are going to get clobbered.

[09:48] They're going to be out of the business within a year.

[09:50] Companies that don't give you the thing you want,

[09:52] they're going to be out of business any year.

[09:54] I think companies like American Pinball are in trouble.

[09:57] Companies like Haggis are in trouble.

[09:59] They were nowhere near Pinball Expo.

[10:01] How are they going to sell these expensive Centaurs?

[10:03] It's just not going to happen.

[10:05] And if Stern Pinball just keeps flooding the market with older titles

[10:09] and new versions of everything,

[10:11] even their buyers are going to walk away.

[10:13] The only thing that's not going to be greedy,

[10:15] the only thing that's not going to fleece you,

[10:17] the only thing that's not going to oversaturate you well,

[10:19] Canada might oversaturate you with shows because I know you love it

[10:22] and I'm giving you the best bang for the buck,

[10:24] is Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[10:26] I love covering this hobby and I think there's no better time

[10:29] in pinball history than to just wait and see.

[10:33] Why buy now?

[10:35] Buy, buy, buy error is over.

[10:37] And I actually think this Keith Elwin game,

[10:39] if it's not pretty, it doesn't look good and it doesn't have assets.

[10:43] I think more and more people are going to be sitting on the sideline

[10:47] and saying, hey, you didn't give me everything I wanted.

[10:50] Now you want so much money from me.

[10:53] I haven't forgotten the days when you put all the assets into the games.

[10:57] I haven't forgotten the days when the artwork was absolutely stunning.

[11:01] And for this much money, there can't be any compromises.

[11:05] It's just that simple.

[11:07] We are now living in an upside down pinball marketplace.

[11:11] A company called Barrels of Fun beat Jersey Jack Pinball at its own game.

[11:16] Everybody have an amazing Wednesday.

[11:19] It is hump day.

[11:20] Also just for the record, Saturday morning spectacular.

[11:23] I'm going to have to move the time probably or just cancel it

[11:26] because I'm traveling this Saturday more to come on that.

[11:29] Everybody have a great day and thank you so much for the support.

[11:32] We are now at the most amount of club members ever, ever.

[11:36] The haters can't figure it out as they do all their giveaways

[11:40] and chill all their products.

[11:42] We're here with no endorsement dollars, no shilling.

[11:45] Just the world's most entertaining pinball podcast.

[11:48] I'll talk to you soon.

[11:49] Canada out.
