[00:00] It's not time to make a change. Just relax. Take it easy. You're still young. That's your fault. There's so much you have to know.

[00:14] Relax and take it easy. That's going to be the theme of episode 126 of Canadian Pimball Podcast. I want to thank all of you guys out there.

[00:32] Again, a weekly basis you guys tune in and you listen to this podcast. I think it's great. I think Pimball is something that we're so passionate about.

[00:42] That sometimes just relaxing and taking it easy is the hardest thing for people in this hobby to do.

[00:50] As I look at the Pimball landscape right now and I look at what's about to occur. I see a lot of people in certain threads fighting each other, battling each other. I see people in other threads super excited talking about Pimball.

[01:06] I want to really discuss what I think is an important part of this hobby. That is not letting this hobby completely overtake your life. I know it sounds a little bit ironic coming from me that I would say that. Someone who fills the airwaves three days a week normally doing a podcast about Pimball.

[01:32] I spent many hours reading and thinking about Pimball. I know you guys do too. I have to say when you step back a little bit and think about this hobby, there really is no reason why people should ever insult each other, argue with each other, scream at each other, lob insults at each other.

[01:58] Because when you do step back, the thing that all of us are into is something that 99.9% of the planet doesn't give two shits about. Most people don't care about Pimball. You can go up and have a Pimball conversation with most people you know. You can't have it with your coworkers. You can't have it with your family members.

[02:24] You get all the people that actually do care about Pimball in one place at one time. What do they do? A lot of them bicker and moan and complain, but the reality is this. Most people are not that way.

[02:40] The only places where most of the fighting occurs is with new inbox Pimball machines, but not even new inbox Pimball machines. The most bickering occurs in threads that have to deal with companies that are trying to release new inbox Pimball machines.

[03:05] We see it all the time, the dramas and the Dutch thread, the dramas in the highway Pimball thread. The drama can be in the medieval man's remake thread. The drama could be in the ACDC Vault Edition thread.

[03:22] There's just so much back and forth bickering and fighting and I get it. It's like everyone's got an opinion. Everyone's got their point of view on what just happened in the Pimball world.

[03:36] I'm here to tell you guys that I've been in the middle of the drama. I've been in the middle of the drama. I've been at the center of controversy. I've been a potster. I've been a troll. I've been a person who used to go into a habit thread when I didn't like the habit and I would talk shit about the habit. Even though I knew I would never buy a habit.

[04:04] I look back on that behavior with a lot of shame and regret because I think about it now and how idiotic is it to go into a thread about a game I don't even like just to constantly remind people I don't like it.

[04:24] You could say it once, maybe even say it twice. But to repeat over and over again, you're disdain for a game. It gets kind of ridiculous.

[04:36] But I also think that the flip side is, if you have concerns about a Pimball manufacturer, even if you're not going to buy that manufacturer's game, I do think it's important that people do. They do search for truth in these Pimball manufacturers.

[04:59] I want to talk a little bit about that on this episode of Cananda's Pimball Podcast. But what I want to start out by saying is this, I have never been in a community where people are so quick to help each other out, to lend some advice, to send out an email or a Facebook private message, trying to help out any problem you might have when it comes to Pimball.

[05:28] And I want to say thank you to the individuals who, by me mentioning the issues I was having with Magic Girl, reached out to me immediately and offered their help.

[05:41] And so I want to say thank you to Mike, Mike Meetzker, Mike Thank you. Mike reached out right away and was like, I might be able to help you with your Magic Girl boards.

[05:53] He's been working with Arduino boards for years and I say Mike, I really appreciate the help. I may take you up on it. I need to see what's the verdict from CoinTaker.

[06:04] I also want to say thank you to Parnell. Parnell also emailed me and said he might be able to help as well with the board. So Parnell, thank you very much. I really, really appreciate it.

[06:20] I also want to say thank you to Gabriel who also offered to help with my Magic Girl. He asked me to bring the game up to Fantastic in Boston.

[06:30] Here's a thing about my Magic Girl. It's not, it can't leave my home and go all the way up to Boston for a potential fix. It's just such an arduous and laborious thing to take this game out of my apartment.

[06:44] It's not easy. I have to remove the front door from the apartment. I have to use the freight elevator. It's God, it's, it's, it's the last resort to ship this game out of here to make it, to make it better.

[06:58] But here's a thing. All right. This week I got an email and some other people out there got emails and the gist of the email was this.

[07:10] Star Wars is coming and it's coming very, very soon. And it's the moment we've all been waiting for. And it's the moment that I think is going to create a lot of joy and a lot of frustration at the same time.

[07:29] Because we know what's going to happen, right? We already know what's going to happen when Stern reveals Star Wars. You're going to have a polarizing response to it.

[07:40] Why do I know this? Because everything, everything that gets revealed in this hobby is received with both love and hate. And that's fine. Right. Everyone's going to have their opinions.

[07:54] But Star Wars is going to be one that brings out the extreme sides of people's opinions. And when that happens, when that happens, I just hope that people kind of shut up until they play it. Right. I mean, that's, that's like a hard ask.

[08:13] But what what typically happens whenever Stern shows a new game is we're going to get people who criticize the artwork. We're going to get people who criticize the layout. We're going to get people who criticize the toys. We're going to get people who criticize the originality of it. You name it. There's going to be a critic.

[08:33] We're also going to get people that love all those things. And it's exciting. Right. Because I do believe what separates Pimball from anything else out there in terms of, you know, coin operated devices is Pimball, new Pimball provokes a dialogue and a conversation that's just not found with brand new arcade games coming out. Right.

[09:00] And it's not like forms talking about all these modern new versions of arcade games because no one buys or collects these new arcade games. But Pimball has a completely different following. And, you know, anything I say about Star Wars is going to be pure speculation.

[09:19] I say this. I'll say this about Star Wars. I think Star Wars is a killer theme. I really do. I think it's a killer theme. I think it's the beginning of Stern's next chapter in terms of a consistent run of just absolutely knock out themes. And I think Stern has had really good themes in the past. But I really think we haven't seen anything yet.

[09:44] I want to talk a little bit about my last podcast with Christopher Franci and my conversation with him. Right. And I don't know about you guys, but I truly love the fact that Chris was very honest and very candid about the fact that it wasn't really easy for him to make the Batman machine that he had very little time to get the whole thing together.

[10:11] I got an email. I got an email from a frequent listener of the show Todd Anderson and Todd, thank you for the very sort of well thought out email about the Christopher Franci interview. And Todd basically to sort of summarize said he enjoyed the interview.

[10:31] He was really, you know, he was he really enjoyed the fact that Chris was very honest about Batman 66. But Todd also said, you know, at the end of the day though, at the end of the day, Stern charged the most amount of money for this pinball machine.

[10:48] Stern should have delivered a product that was their best ever. Stern should have delivered a product that was their most premium product. It should have had more attention to detail, more quality control testing, more love than any other Stern machine before it.

[11:11] And I think we all know that that wasn't the case. Right. And so then it's easy to say that this was a quasi cash grab because Stern, you know, how can you rush a machine out and also charge the most amount of money ever. Right.

[11:31] And I think too, you know, Todd made a good point when you asked Chris Franci, you know, could you have done it? Would you have done something differently? And he says, yes, like I would have done the villains differently. And I would have I would have done this a little bit differently.

[11:44] On a machine that Stern is billing as its greatest machine ever, as its most special machine ever, you don't want to hear that things would have been done differently. Right. You want to know that what you got was the end result of countless hours of passion and precision going into that product.

[12:07] And I just don't think people see it. I don't think they see it. And look, the verdicts still out on whether or not, whether or not Lyman can make the game that great. But when you when we know the truth, when we know the story behind Batman 66, it is, it is always going to go down in history. I believe as a game that, you know, Stern sort of rushed out.

[12:37] And thank God for Chris Franci. Thank God for his artwork were at least the package that people have in their home arcades. It looks really nice. It does. It looks really nice.

[12:50] But when Stern says stuff like we were designing this game all summer, and here it is, here's what I've been working on. You know, I just don't think the details are there in that game.

[13:02] That warrants what they ultimately build it as and what they ultimately charge for the machine. Okay. But that's Batman. Right. That's Batman. And because Stern doesn't just stop. Right. Stern's not like Jersey Jack.

[13:17] They're not like Andrew highway. They're not like home pin. Right. They're not like Dutch pinball. Stern, Stern doesn't rest on its laurels. It also doesn't allow its last title to rock them too badly. Right. They're on to the next. They're on to the next. They're on to the next. They're on, you know, they're on to Erasmith. They're on to Star Wars.

[13:44] And for what I'm hearing from people over at Stern, what's going to happen after Star Wars is just going to continue this series of games that are just going to be killer license and blow people away. Right. Okay.

[13:58] And you know, Stern's got the next like few years probably mapped out in terms of what the themes are, who's designing what, who's doing the art for what. I mean, how can you not get excited knowing who's who's on the Stern roster now? You know, Zambietti. You know, we got Chris Franchi. We've got Dirty Donny. Got Lyman Sheets. Greg Ferris. You know, you've got his Dennis Normans. I'll buy you some.

[14:28] I know a lot of them are going to be made by Stern. Who knows, right. But that's the thing. It's like it's a really exciting time to see where Stern goes with it. But the flip side of the coin. The flip side of the coin that I know has everyone sort of excited but not excited.

[14:46] Because deep down everyone wishes they wish that they could combine the Stern themes with the quality of Jersey Jack machines. Right. You really wish that you could have the killer theme with the solid feeling sort of built like a tank.

[15:07] It feels like a Williams machine that only Jersey Jack is sort of bringing to the table. And it's that quality compromise that is really the Achilles heel of Stern Pimble. Right. It won't stop them from selling games. It won't stop them from selling out everything.

[15:26] And the only reason why it won't stop that sell out is that they're the only ones who consistently ship. And we all agree with that. Right.

[15:36] And so on the eve of Star Wars on the eve of Star Wars. I hope people manage their expectations around this pin. Right. It's going to be a killer theme. We know that right. You don't know. You don't have to even worry about that.

[15:51] But the real question mark for me and you probably shared as well is will it have the quality. Right. It's like the same way we can expect Andrew highway to just do a 180 and be able to ramp up production quickly.

[16:09] The same concerns I have of how quickly can Stern turn back on premium quality. Right. They're charging a premium price. But the premium quality just isn't there yet. It just is not there yet.

[16:26] Stuff like the splitting cabinet stuff like the play field issues. Stuff like using $5 toys in a $15,000 game.

[16:38] You know, these are all things that you know, you really wish they would think about it a little bit differently. And you really wish they would not cut any quality corners when it comes to the final product.

[16:52] And so and I think that's why on the eve of a new sort of Stern release, we all sort of are our emotions and our expectations are pulled in opposite directions. Right. And on the flip side. Right. It's because it's like it's hard to root for for only one house.

[17:12] It's hard to root for only one company because I know Stern's going to give me the themes, but I know Jersey Jack's going to give me the quality. Now the problem with Jersey Jack is I just can't get the themes right. Right. I just don't get why Jack can't get that killer theme out at the right time.

[17:33] And I say that because I love dialed in I absolutely love dialed in, but there is no way there is no way as a theme dialed in can compete with Star Wars.

[17:47] You know, there's no way dialed in can even compete with Batman 66 or Ghostbusters. It's such a harder sell. And I think the pinball die hard purist out there who get who Pat Lawler is. And I've heard people tell me time and time again that Pat Lawler is the theme. Right. This is a Pat Lawler themed pinball machine. That's all fine and dandy, but that don't mean did Lee Squad.

[18:14] To all the people out there who don't know pinball history and majority of people I would assume that the majority of people who buy, you know, a lot of storm pinball machines every year don't know who pinball designers are.

[18:34] These guys don't carry the cloud that a lot of people on pinside think, you know, these aren't. Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino might be household names, but Pat Lawler and Dennis Nordman and George Gomez and Steve Richie.

[18:50] Most people who walk into a distributor by a pinball machine or something fun for the home game room, they don't know who these people are.

[18:58] So if you walk in, you a distributor and you see Ghostbusters, Batman, Star Wars, dialed in, which one are you going to pick? I mean, it's just that simple. It is just that simple.

[19:09] Even after you play each of them, we all know what it's like. When you play pinball for the first five to ten minutes, there's just even no way that dialed in is going to pull you into the game as quickly as hearing that John Williams theme song or the Ghostbusters theme song.

[19:27] So I as much as I love the quality and like how Jack is building this sturdy machine, I really have to question the themes because if what we're hearing is true, the rumor that the next Jersey Jack pinball machine is pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:45] And the new pirates movie, by the way, is getting panned by the media, panned. Right. This franchise has long been irrelevant. And I think this final movie is going to leave people once again with like a bad taste in their mouth over the franchise.

[20:03] It's like the Hobbit all over again. And I think Jack is like, and things are not synced up, right. He's going after another movie property that seemingly should be big.

[20:14] But culturally, it's kind of irrelevant and people have moved on. The Hobbit as a movie franchise failed to capture sort of like that cultural relevance and become part of the cultural zeitgeist that Lord the Rings captured.

[20:31] People love Lord the Rings. They can't stand the Hobbit. They can't stand it. And I think Pirates of the Caribbean is very similar in that sense that it's not relevant anymore.

[20:45] And I think the hard part for Jack is also this. It's just timing. Like when is Pirates of the Caribbean, the game coming out, the movie is coming out this week.

[20:58] And so by earliest, we're not going to see a Pirates of the Caribbean game for another year. And will people care. And so that's that's Jack's last sort of Rubicon to cross.

[21:15] You know, he needs to get his themes lined up with the stellar sort of quality and premium nature of his games. And I think Jack has yet he's yet to hit it out of the park.

[21:31] He doesn't yet have that game that just everybody wants. And there's no part of the game that is disputable or questioned. And it's almost like, you know, the Jersey Jack pinball machine that we know is going to be a timeless classic even 20 years from now.

[21:54] And look, I think dialed in as a good chance to be a game that remains popular with pinball fans over the years because it's a launder machine and it shoots great. And it's got a ton of stuff in it. And it's a standard body game.

[22:11] I think it's going to sat to satisfy and satiate on that level. But the theme might not age well, right, especially when your theme has to do with selfies and cell phones and drones.

[22:25] These things while currently trendy might be seen as really outdated 10, 20 years from now, right. It's like putting a rotary phone as the main item in a game 20 years ago.

[22:41] So maybe 30 years ago, right. So, but look, I think it's really exciting that Jersey Jack and Stern are both about to ship their most highly anticipated titles in a long time.

[22:57] And it's sort of crazy that they're both coming out around the same time. June, July is going to be one of the most exciting months in pinball. And I don't know about you guys out there, but I can't wait to see what happens between these two companies.

[23:15] And it's going to be it's not going to be close in terms of volume. It's not going to be close in terms of sales. It's not going to be close in terms of hype. There is no there is no denying the fact that Star Wars is just going to own it this summer.

[23:32] Good luck. Good luck going against Star Wars. And it doesn't mean Star Wars is going to be better. I didn't say that. It doesn't mean I think Star Wars is going to be a better build quality. I didn't say that either. I'm a huge Star Wars fan.

[23:45] And I have to be honest, I would rather have Jersey Jack make my Star Wars pinball machine in 2017. And I only say that because I'm nervous of the quality of the Stern machine.

[24:01] And I also like I'm still not quite sure why Stern has not given certain upgrade options to people who love these themes. So for example, when I buy a Jersey Jack game, I like the fact that I can go get rad cows.

[24:19] Right. They're awesome decals that go on the sides of the cabinets in the back box. Those things are incredible. That's like just a simple innovation from like that's available to any manufacturer.

[24:33] Jack didn't eat pad in that thicker decal that's glossy. You can go get that. And I just you know, Stern's got the cool sort of decal on the Batman super le but I don't even think that's going to be like the standard of what's on the le for Star Wars.

[24:52] And so you know, I just wish I could dress up my Stern machines a little bit more than I currently can. And I know I know when I stand over a Star Wars, it's not going to feel nearly as rock solid as a dial then.

[25:09] But look, these are all as I say, relax and take it easy. These are all like these are all like first world problems, right of which one's going to be better and more exciting. And I'm looking forward to playing both of them.

[25:23] I have deposits down on both games like I know many of you do. And I will ultimately put the one that I think is the best in my living room.

[25:34] And that is that is going to be a pretty interesting sort of battle to see which one becomes the one that makes its way into Canadian's living room.

[25:45] Okay. Now when I say like relax and take it easy, I know it's hard to really relax and take it easy in some of the more contentious threads that are on pin side.

[25:58] And there's no more contentious of a thread right now than the alien thread. And it's gotten to the point now where people inside that thread are so angry, they're so provocative, they're so contentious that it's sort of derailed the thread.

[26:21] And I don't know, I think what people need, I think what people really need. And I don't know if Andrew still listens to this podcast, I kind of feel like they do. I know he should be reading his own thread on pin side.

[26:35] But people need an update. They really are in an in desperate need of a production update on alien. Right. And what's what's difficult for people who are in on that game is you can't just say,

[26:50] you can't deny this sort of skepticism and cynicism that has started to develop around highway pimples ability to deliver these games.

[27:05] And I on this podcast have been skeptical. I am cynical of the repeated missed dates and deadlines that have been put forward by highway pimple.

[27:20] And I am really nervous for you guys who are in on this game. And I think that the next couple months are really going to be a period where you're either going to see agony or ecstasy.

[27:38] I don't think you're going to see apathy. I don't think you're going to see patience. I don't think you're going to see any more leniency. I think people are fed up. And I think people are wanting answers.

[27:58] And I really wish there would be an update. But here's what I here's the thing about updates is what do updates mean anymore like a written update means nothing.

[28:11] I think there needs to be some visual proof that production is really ramping up. And if there is a problem, if there is a problem, I do think Ted's advice is always the most sound advice.

[28:27] Which is I think it's time to come clean on what what actually is happening here. Like what is going on? What is going on? Because the next update we do get needs to be a good one.

[28:40] It needs to be that productions begun. Right. I just saw a photo tonight of about 10 dialed in lined up in a row for quality control testing of the first production line.

[28:55] I emailed Jack. He sent me the image. I put it on my Facebook. If you're friends with me on Facebook, you can see it. And and and again, this is like this is what production looks like.

[29:07] We've seen what production looks like from spooky from Stern from Jack. All we've ever seen with alien production are these videos that are late at night when there's like nobody really in the shop.

[29:20] And it's at the point now where if production is really beginning, there should be workers there. There should be games moving on the line. There should be games at different stations.

[29:32] There should be multiple multiple workers there assembling these games. And because we don't see that. Because we don't see that. I don't know how you draw any other conclusion.

[29:47] Then that's not occurring over there. But that's not happening. And I know people who are in on it. They really have a.

[29:58] It's just sort of like this. Desire not to face the truth. They have a desire to sort of see what they want to see.

[30:08] They've they've they they're not just drinking the Kool-Aid. They drink it months. If not years ago. They just have a reluctancy to see what's right in front of them.

[30:21] And I really think that reluctancy could be a dangerous thing for these individuals. And I think enough information has been put forward.

[30:31] And enough questions have been asked that if if people get burned it this I really mean this. The buyers and the people that are shilling the these games.

[30:47] There's really nobody to blame anymore. There really isn't. And I and I say this to this is this is like really coming from the heart. If you have requested a refund and you haven't got you haven't received your refund.

[31:04] Keep saying it. Keep asking publicly to to be made whole. Because as much as certain individuals in that thread and you guys know who they are.

[31:17] Want to silence those people want to try and blame those people for bringing companies down. I really think as a community we need to stop standing up for the manufacturers who who have misled and and and taken people down a road that has taken their money and not delivered the product when they said it would be delivered.

[31:44] Step away from Pimball for a minute guys imagine if you ordered a product from Amazon.com and you paid for the products and it said it was going to be delivered on a certain date.

[31:56] A week goes by you don't get it. A month goes by you don't get it. Six months go by you don't get it. A year goes by you don't get it.

[32:07] What would you do? What would you do? Would you go on and say well you know Amazon is just making my product better that's why it's taken so long. You know shipping that product is hard.

[32:20] You wouldn't make excuses right? You would flip out. You would actually flip out if your Amazon product wasn't delivered on the exact day it was promised.

[32:31] We even have people in the thread saying they'll just be happy if they get the game any time this year.

[32:37] Whenever you start to see that extreme defeatist attitude it's never a good sign.

[32:43] I think there's just a few other signs in the alien thread that just speak volumes to me.

[32:48] One of the things that speaks volumes to me is that Oric who worked on the artwork is part of the highway team for a really long time who was up on the stage

[33:00] who was really excited to be a part of this project. He's nowhere to be found.

[33:06] And he loves to give his opinion. He loves to talk about pinball. He's nowhere to be found.

[33:15] Nowhere in the thread. That's not a good sign. That is not a good sign.

[33:21] I also think the other person that's nowhere to be found in the highway thread is Andrew Highway.

[33:28] And when people say like, you know, he's probably busy making games. I don't care what anybody says.

[33:34] This is his company. He's got one thread where the majority of his customers live.

[33:43] The majority of people who know about highway pinball are on the pinside. Remember, these guys aren't.

[33:49] They don't have mass distribution. They don't have distributors all over the country all over the world.

[33:54] The majority of people who are keeping his company going, who are buying his machinery, they're on pinside.

[34:03] And so for pinside to be ignored with no updates, it's just not a good sign. It's not a good sign.

[34:11] Now look, again, all of this, all of this goes away if they share a video of full production.

[34:20] And they share some proof that games are really shipping and quantity.

[34:25] But the more we read stories about games going out without Xeno heads, games going out where there's like a lot of issues,

[34:34] the more people are going to be skeptical about whether or not it's the right time to stay in on the game.

[34:40] And the final point I'll make is this. And I think this is the most ridiculous thing I see in the thread.

[34:46] It's when people list out like 10 things that need to be adjusted or 10 issues wrong with the game, new in box.

[34:56] And then you get the shills who say, well, that's just pinball. You have to do all these things. That's a bunch of BS.

[35:03] There might be like a switch here or there, but the amount of items you have to then go fix right out of the box with this game.

[35:13] I've never seen so much sort of leeway and such like an apologetic approach to a machine as I have with Alien.

[35:25] And like the one thing I always look at is the LCD on the play field that owners have to go and figure out a way to level that LCD on the play field.

[35:38] And it doesn't, how is that even like possible? That is like one of the main features of highway pinball is that LCD on the play field.

[35:49] And why isn't that thing leaving the factory perfectly level with the play field in a way that won't move, that won't adjust.

[35:58] And I think it goes down to one simple thing is that hardly anybody, hardly anybody bought full throttle, like hardly anyone, hardly anyone played full throttle, hardly anyone had full throttles in their home.

[36:15] So all of the issues that might have plagued full throttle, whether it's lighting issues or that LCD screen moving around, they were never really talked about in volume because nobody has it.

[36:29] So most people think highway pinball is the best quality machine ever. Most people don't think that but most people are being told that by people like Hilton.

[36:41] There's like a few people there that just want to say that you see what Hilton said, it's the best quality machine, it's got the full throttle and Alien are the two greatest, he said the two greatest flowing pinball machines of all time.

[36:56] So we have this incredible affirmation of the quality and by just the minority of people.

[37:08] But the reality now is starting to sink in is that they never made a lot of games.

[37:15] The quality of these games has never fully been tested. And now it's like aliens are going out and it's clear, it's clear that even after a two year delay, there's just a lot of stuff wrong with it.

[37:30] And that's catastrophic for a company that can't afford another delay.

[37:36] Now let's talk about Dutch. I don't know if they're going to take the deal or not. I think they need to but we still have no update on them.

[37:47] And how long, how long before like nobody cares anymore. I mean big Lebowski's turned into a really big joke, right?

[37:58] It sucks. I know people, man, I know I have friends who are in on this game. I have friends who are far into the 140 plus, you know.

[38:10] It's an ironic too that they call these people, are they the early adopters? What are they called? Nothing early about them.

[38:20] It's like ironic that they're getting the game so late, right? The irony of this year in Pimbal, it kills me. All these ironic things happening.

[38:29] Did you guys find it ironic that Orrick did the artwork illegally for games like ACDC and games like the shadow?

[38:40] Remember he sold all these things, he like Star Trek. He made all these like non-licens, translides and plastics.

[38:49] They were great. They made the games look better. This is not a knock against Orrick making those things.

[38:54] But he made them like illegally in a way. And now that he was legally allowed to make the alien back glass for the LA, he had legal permission.

[39:06] He gets snubbed by Andrew and Andrew brings in a new artist. I mean that's ironic. That Orrick finally gets the chance to make the illegally approved IP approved back glass for one of the biggest themes in Pimbal history.

[39:22] And his translides gets shelved. The irony is too much. But it's all going to come to an end this year for people.

[39:33] If you guys disagree, email me at canadapimbal.com. I think this is it. I think the shake up, it is about to happen. I feel this calm before the storm. I really do.

[39:48] I think what's about to happen in June and July is you're going to see big winners and big losers.

[39:54] And I think you're going to see people ripping open dialed in boxes and having a blast. I think you're going to see people having a blast with Star Wars.

[40:03] I think you're going to see Batman people get a little bit happier because the code's going to get even better.

[40:09] I think you're going to see attack from Mars remake going into homes and people are going to be excited.

[40:15] And I think you're going to see the ecstasy of those people. And then I think you're going to see the people who have waited for years, who lock their money up with manufacturers, who have done nothing but flounder.

[40:29] And I think those guys are going to fail. Why would I think they're going to succeed? Why would I think it's not that I want them to fail though guys.

[40:37] But why would I think looking at all of the information in front of me. Why would I think that all of a sudden these companies will just do a 180 and survive.

[40:51] And I think most of you guys point at Jersey Jack as a company that did that. We all know that Jack was at the brink of disaster like Midway into developing the Hobbit.

[41:04] He basically ran out of money that he had to take Hobbit money to finish the Wars orders. And he couldn't get Hobbit into production.

[41:14] And then Jack found his billionaire angel investor. But Jack also, here's the thing about Jack.

[41:23] Jack also, the difference between Jack and Andrew, it's night and day simply because Jack had a product, the initial product that was really successful.

[41:37] I could go to an investor and say, I sold like one or two thousand or three thousand wizard of oses. How can Andrew go to an investor and say, I sold this many full throttles and get someone to give him like a big bill out.

[41:55] And I don't know how you do it. I think Jack's product was there. And Jack also highly connected individual in the Pimball world.

[42:06] And so I think everyone's waiting for Andrew to get this influxing cash to get him to do the 180 that Jack was able to do. I don't know if he's going to be able to do it.

[42:16] I don't know if he's going to be able to do it. I don't know what's going to happen with Dutch Pimball.

[42:21] But both organizations are stalling on giving people refunds. And I don't like that. I think that's going to be a disastrous thing if these companies keep making people wait.

[42:35] Because all that's going to happen when people see all the ecstasy from people opening up those new games is they're going to say, I want my money back. And I want to go buy what's available.

[42:45] I want to go buy a Star Wars premium. I want to go buy a dial then. I want to go buy an attack from arms remaking. I'm sick of my money waiting for years with you guys. I'm sick of it. I'm done with it.

[42:55] If you guys get your shit together, I'll happily be a customer. And I think that's the case for a lot of people. You almost got to be like a fool at this point.

[43:04] A fool to just keep your money locked in a place that doesn't make any sense. Like you got it. Like only a fool would go pre-order Houdini.

[43:14] Like, why would you go put a deposit on Houdini now? You don't need to. They're going to make Houdini if they get it made. Right? They're going to make as many as people order.

[43:26] There's no limited number. Alien. You can put everything that's on the Ellie. You can put everything onto that machine. If you buy the standard and they're going to make the standard forever.

[43:40] Big Lebowski, who the hell knows they're only going to make 300. They've only made 40. Right? It's two years since they showed that game.

[43:50] So, wow. I name this podcast like Relax and take it easy. I think I've done anything but relax. But I am calm about it all.

[44:02] And I really do think that this summer is going to be the summer where things excite and the summer where things depress people.

[44:14] And it's just the way pinball goes these days. You just got to decide which feeling do you want to have. Like you can decide. You guys out there. You buyers out there.

[44:25] You can decide what kind of pinball experience do you want to have. And when I look at this hobby, the people who have preordered and waited and speculated they've experienced nothing but pain.

[44:41] The people who have gone and given money to distributors when games were available, when games were real, when games were coming off a real assembly line.

[44:54] Those people have enjoyed pinball. And they enjoy it. And they play a game. And if they get tired of it, they sell it and they get another one.

[45:02] And that's how the cycle of pinball should work. And I hope this year, I hope this year shakes everybody out of this hobby who has no business being in it, has no business creating so much of the negative energy that's in the hobby.

[45:19] And everyone, everyone, do me a favor. Just relax. Don't attack everybody on these threads. I would do nothing other than demand answers from the manufacturers. Don't beat each other up.

[45:38] It's not Hilton's fault that Andrew Highway is not shipping games. It's not rare heroes fault that Big Lebowski's not going out. It's nobody's fault but the manufacturers. It's nobody's fault that Jay Popp.

[45:56] So being nicer to each other, just remember that. It's not your fellow hobbyist that is to blame for any of this stuff.

[46:07] But again, the exception to that are the people who show for these manufacturers and are trying to mislead people. And that cannot be tolerated.

[46:22] So look, I got to just probably say the most honest thing I've said in a while. I think dialed in and star wars are going to be two juggernauts this summer. And I'd hate to go up against them no matter what else is out there. I'd hate to go up against them.

[46:43] I think they're both going to bring something completely different to the table. But I think they're both going to be knockouts in their own way. I really do. And I think after that, I think after that, it's going to be really interesting to see how anybody, anybody stays competitive with Stern and JJP.

[47:06] And I mean that. I mean that. It's yet to be seen if spooky can up their game and make a game as good as a Stern pro hasn't happened yet. I hope they can get there.

[47:17] You know, attack from Mars remake. I don't really care about the remakes. I got to be honest. Cool. It's cool. You're remaking something that we know is good.

[47:27] But the excitement level will never be there. These remakes will come and go. And yeah, you can change the displays and put awesome toppers on them. But I still don't think there's going to be the same level of interest in a remake.

[47:39] Home pin. I've invited Mike on the show. I look forward to seeing what home pin is all about. Again, I've just I've never seen anyone try to go at a large scale production and be very successful. So we'll see if they can make it.

[47:56] P3, you know, again, like P3 up against Star Wars up against Star Wars up against a pat wall or game.

[48:08] I don't know how you know Jerry's going to Jerry needs a theme. He needs a theme to get the audience where he needs it to be. He knows it. He knows that.

[48:18] All right. You know, who Dini God by the time who Dini comes out by the time who Dini actually ships. What what's the landscape going to look like? I wouldn't have shown the game so early. I wouldn't they've shown almost all of the tricks nine months early.

[48:35] I wouldn't have done it. But I you know, look forward to talking to those guys soon. But it's going to be really competitive landscape come expo 20 2017. We said this every year though right then expose always disappoint.

[48:50] But that's it. I look forward to this summer. I look forward to being your pinball podcasts host throughout this summer because I think it's going to be just one hell of a pinball summer.

[49:04] I'm about to go on a new business venture to New Jersey Thursday. So I want to get this up now because I think tomorrow is going to be just hell for me.

[49:15] And I've sort of settled into a little bit of like a Monday Wednesday for high day sort of deal not always going to be that way. I don't I kind of do these when I just feel like I know you guys love the interviews.

[49:27] I also love doing these and just talking to you guys without having always interview someone every time. I want to get more host on this show that are hobbyist like Ryan over there in Australia. I thought that was really awesome.

[49:41] I would talk into someone all the way across the world like that. It doesn't matter where he is in the world that he's got the same exact interest that I have here.

[49:51] The same exact interest that someone has in like England or Germany or Netherlands or you know California. That's what's amazing about pinball. It doesn't matter where you are.

[50:02] Like you get all of us in a room and we could talk about it and we can understand it.

[50:09] You know unlike unlike unlike if you love a sport you go over to another part of the world they don't give a shit about like the NFL.

[50:19] You know it's crazy the way pinball brings people together in such a specific way.

[50:25] So everyone have a good hump day. Enjoy this podcast. We'll be back with more interviews. We'll be back with more news.

[50:33] We'll see if Star Wars happens like this week or next. It's happening soon.

[50:40] But until then I think it's just going to be a little bit of just like a waiting for that. Waiting for that ball to drop is everything.

[50:48] So have a great day and shoot me any feedback. If you agree with me, if you disagree with me.

[50:54] Canate a pinball at gmail.com. I've got some of my listeners have sent me emails. I'm going to do a better job of calling out some of those emails.

[51:05] Now it would help me guys if you actually write in your email that it's okay for me to read on air what you're saying.

[51:14] I don't know. I get a little nervous. People write me these long emails. I don't know if they're comfortable with me sharing everything.

[51:21] They think it's just like a private message with canada. So I do implore you that you're just let me know if you're cool with me sharing what you say.

[51:30] Okay, that's it. Have a great Wednesday. Enjoy pinball and we'll talk to you real soon.

[51:37] All the times that I cry keeping all the things I knew inside it's hard but it's hard to ignore it.

[51:49] If they write you I'd agree that it's them they know not me. Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.

[52:04] I know I have to go.
