[00:00] This day in the car.

[00:02] Day in the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm.

[00:05] Heavy meals and bagwits.

[00:07] Heavy pay check and fortune.

[00:09] Heavy formation and parade. I love the Corps.

[00:12] This floor is freezing.

[00:14] What do you want me to do? Fetch a slipus for you?

[00:16] Jean, would you, sir? I'd like that.

[00:19] I'm looking to my eyes.

[00:22] I really wanted to get this podcast in on Alien Day April 26th, but I have gone past that.

[00:37] But for good reason, I was at Alamo Drafthouse tonight watching back-to-back movies of Alien,

[00:45] then a limited break in an Alien.

[00:48] So, a little bit tired.

[00:50] I've been wanting to record another podcast the past few days.

[00:54] It's just been busy with work.

[00:55] So, I want to welcome everyone to episode 33 of Canadian Pimball Podcast.

[01:00] Let's go!

[01:15] Two hundred thousand miles I'm looking at you.

[01:20] In the Marine Corps, I let you.

[01:25] I let you.

[01:28] I let you.

[01:32] So, I was all excited for Alien Day.

[01:35] And not because I was waiting for new footage from Highway Pimball.

[01:41] I was somewhat optimistic we'd see something today, but I didn't think we would.

[01:45] So, I wasn't shocked when I saw that.

[01:47] There was nothing was released by Highway to celebrate Alien Day.

[01:53] It seems like they've got a video that they're waiting on approval.

[01:56] And that just seems to be the entire story for this game is them waiting for approval to show stuff.

[02:02] And it's a shame.

[02:04] I think it was a golden opportunity missed.

[02:07] I think, you know, just even being a part of this day or having information about the Pimball machine out and around the country where people are seeing the movie would have been a great opportunity.

[02:20] But, you know, it is what it is.

[02:22] And I think we've already belabored that fact.

[02:25] But I was most excited about Alien Day today because I wanted to get those sagorney weaver alien stomper sneakers.

[02:33] And it was almost worse than Pepsi perfect all over again in terms of trying to snag one of these things.

[02:40] I don't know if any of you tried to get some, but I was refreshing the Reebok site at noon, Eastern Time.

[02:47] And finally, you get through and it allows you to put in all your information to buy them.

[02:52] And then when you go to check out, it won't let you check out.

[02:55] And I just found that so annoying that they let everyone get to that point where after doing all this work, they're just sold out.

[03:03] I also thought it was absolutely ridiculous that they only offered them in men sizes considering the fact that sagorney weaver wears them in the movie and there is no women sizes available.

[03:15] Because I really wanted to get a pair for Brenda because they honestly would like ten times cooler on her than me.

[03:22] I didn't get a chance to play the Zen Pimbal Alien games that got released today, but I did hear good things from a few people who had a chance to download them and play them.

[03:35] So that's exciting. I mean, there at least there was some Alien Pimbal being played on an Alien Day.

[03:41] But I think all of us out there just want to, we just want to see this game revealed sooner than later.

[03:49] And as I was watching the movies, I kept thinking about what it will be like to try and recreate the world of Alien and Aliens in a Pimbal machine.

[04:00] And I think it's going to be interesting to see how it all comes together.

[04:05] The movies are so much about the characters and not having them front and center on the Pimbal machine.

[04:11] I think it's going to be a hurdle to overcome, but we'll see what they deliver when that game is finally time to be revealed.

[04:19] All right. Let's talk about what's been going on in the Pimbal world.

[04:24] So Ghostbusters pros are shipping. And I think this is a glorious, glorious moment whenever a new Pimbal machine ships.

[04:34] It's how it should be. We, there's so much speculation about games and what they're going to be like.

[04:41] And I think Stern once again has gone from reveal to shipping in what, two months.

[04:50] And people are now unboxing games. It's incredible where everyone else makes people wait two years.

[04:56] So congratulations, Stern on getting Ghostbusters pros out there.

[05:01] And it seems there's been a lot of conversation about the game itself taking place, which is fun to finally see it in the hands of people and having people like Levy out there in the community.

[05:14] And give his review of the game and and and Levy's a great resource to the community and is a great player.

[05:22] So a review from him carries a lot of weight with with people. And it's, you know, it's it's fun to see an experienced player weigh in on a title like this.

[05:34] And I've been doing my best to sort of read through the threads. And again, sorry that it's late at night.

[05:40] So you're not going to get like the high energy, canada and also sorry that I'm able to read everything going on just because it's been crazy at work.

[05:46] But I wanted to get this podcast out there. My takeaway from what I've been reading in the thread is that people are concerned that the game plays really difficult.

[05:57] That the game is drain happy. And especially the left out lane drains pretty frequently. Now I did notice that when I played Ghostbusters Pro at Texas Pimball Festival, that left out lane always seems to sort of sort of roll off that post, that the metal railing and drain pretty frequently.

[06:18] And the game is fast. It's fast and it's furious and it has a tendency to create airballs and it's a little, shall we say the word can be brutal.

[06:28] But I think as people were saying, give it a chance. And with all new pinball machines, we sort of tend to look at them.

[06:39] Almost looking for the problems more than we're looking to have fun on them. I think a lot of people would agree with that.

[06:48] And I hear a lot that every new penalty seems to have this criticism that it's drain happier.

[06:58] There's a shot that creates a straight down the middle drain or an out lane drain. And when we saw Rob Zombie a few months ago, everyone said it was the most brutal game.

[07:08] And then when I played it at Texas Pimball Festival, it didn't play that way for me at all. But I think what's hard is you can play a pinball machine maybe five times in a row and draining all the time on you. And then you might play it five more times and you have long ball times.

[07:25] Because so much of it is learning the shots. And I think people have been saying that it takes time on any new machine to learn the shots and get good at the game.

[07:34] Learn the game. Learn the game. And I think that's the thing that is hard for all of us as we give our initial first impressions of games.

[07:43] And I've been really guilty of this is it's so hard to give a review and assessment of a game right away.

[07:52] Now I think guys like levy are good because again they're really experienced players so they can talk a lot about which shots are tight, which shots are easy.

[08:01] What what he's experienced I think a lot of people will eventually experience because of his skill level.

[08:07] So look it's it seems to be a game where there is a lot of draining going on. Now I I tend to think that the premiums and the LEDs are going to not drain so much with magnetic slings.

[08:21] And it seems to be that you know the slings are kicking out to the outlands a lot with the pro.

[08:30] I don't think you're going to get that same type of behavior on the LEDs and the premiums. And if we believe what we are told and that is that this game was designed designed to play with the magnetic slings and design for the premium and Ellie first.

[08:45] And the pro what came last then I tend to want to wait to see how this game plays before making some sort of claim that it's it's a really difficult frustrating game.

[08:59] The other thing that people are talking about is the linear nature of the mode so that you're playing the modes in the same linear fashion versus being able to select the modes the way you would in some other games like Lord of the Rings.

[09:14] And and the fear there is that if you're not really good you're not going to progress too far into the game especially if it's a drain happy game.

[09:22] And most people will only see a few modes they won't get to some of the modes that are down the line. And I understand that and again I think again it's all way too early to determine if that's going to be the case and if it's going to be really hard.

[09:36] And I think people are still learning how to how to play the game. It's really with this is what week one where we're really getting the public out on to a ghostbusters pro.

[09:47] So let's see how people think a week from now. But what's amazing is that people have it they have it. I really really really love that this game is now being unboxed and I wish I could say that about a lot of other games that were revealed far before ghostbusters was even a rumor.

[10:08] And those games are still waiting to ship. So it's it's always a good thing that we even can have criticisms of what it's like to play a pinball machine versus just speculation or what a pinball machine is going to be.

[10:21] So let's see how it goes.

[10:23] When when he is stirring going to let people though play the premium and I think that has got a lot of people sort of scratching their heads.

[10:32] Now I'm also sort of scratching my head at this point. If if the game was designed with premium and Ellie in mind first, then I tend to believe that the code for the premium Ellie's are further along and that everything should be working properly.

[10:50] I am a little I am a little I don't want to say concern, but I'm just a little perplexed as to why the Ellie and the premium hasn't found its way into a review or some sort of Jack danger type of event where it's it's being played.

[11:11] And is it just going to ship one day or we actually going to get a gameplay video so people can see it.

[11:17] It's it's a it doesn't matter to Ellie buyers who already bought out the pin it sold out for Ellie's I think within a couple days of being announced.

[11:30] And I think the premium orders are also incredibly high for this game.

[11:35] So it's interesting that Stern has all these people going in on a game where they haven't really experienced what it's like with the slings.

[11:42] I think it's going to be amazing. I do I think it's going to be super fun.

[11:46] I even think that people shouldn't worry so much about the ball times like Ghostbusters because I think Ghostbusters is designed to be the way Pimball used to be.

[11:58] And that is you jump on it and you're having a blast right away.

[12:02] I don't think the ball times are going to be necessarily super long.

[12:06] But I think it's going to always be rewarding to play and to jump on and play another game.

[12:11] And I think that's a good thing. Sometimes when I hear people complain it's like I it's almost like there's like a no win scenario where people hate long ball times.

[12:20] They hate slow pinball machines. They hate not having stuff to shoot for.

[12:25] I think you put Ghostbusters next to the hobbit and you look at the difference in gameplay, the difference in ball time, the difference in things to shoot at.

[12:36] And those two games to me are on opposite ends of the spectrum.

[12:40] So it's nice to know that Pimball gives you one or the other. You can have both. You can have one. You can have the other.

[12:47] But I think Ghostbusters is really going to end up being one of the most celebrated Pimball machines in a long time.

[12:56] And I know the jury still out on that. But I think it's got the it's just got all the elements there to be the complete package.

[13:04] The one thing I'll say about Levy, the Ghostbusters theme song is great.

[13:09] If you're going to play a Ghostbusters theme song, expect to hear or sorry a Ghostbusters Pimball machine, expect to hear the theme song.

[13:16] And don't get annoyed by it. And I think the other music in the pen is absolutely incredible.

[13:20] So can't wait to see people get their premiums in their L.E. soon. And I think it's going to be a great six months watching people enjoy this pen and getting better at it and seeing where the code goes on Ghostbusters.

[13:32] And speaking of where the code is going to go on Stern Games, let's talk now about KISS.

[13:40] Now I haven't played KISS version 1.28, which is the new code that just came out.

[13:45] So I can't give my thoughts on what that code update is. Now guys, I wish I had a row of Pimball machines and I could play them and give you guys first hand accounts of everything.

[13:56] But what I can do is sort of give my opinions about how some of these things are launched and released and what I think about them.

[14:06] Here's my thoughts on this. So I think it took way too long to get this code update and I think everybody agrees.

[14:13] I think the people who went in on KISS were treated too much too long of a weight because KISS when it came out, it was so hyped.

[14:26] It had such beautiful art. There was so much promise when that Pimball machine was released.

[14:32] And then it was just nothing. It was crickets for eight to nine months as these guys waited patiently to have their games wake up.

[14:41] Really, when you get a game with really early code, you're literally stared at it and are waiting for it to come out of it. It's like Comatose State.

[14:50] And I'm not saying it was that bad, but it may have been that bad because I definitely heard nothing but bad things about the state of the game.

[15:01] So there's a lot of expectations on what this code update would bring.

[15:06] And universally, reading people who updated it, it just still seems like it didn't deliver what people were expecting from it.

[15:18] They still seem a bit disappointed in what they're getting with the code update.

[15:23] But before I even talk more about that, I think just in general, a few things I want to address here.

[15:29] I think a game has a window when it's super hyped when people are super excited to get it.

[15:36] There's a window where you need to get code updates to those buyers quicker or people fall out of love with the pen.

[15:46] There's only so long you can wait on a pinball machine before you just move on to the next.

[15:54] And not just the owners, but just the communities moved on to the next title, to the next title.

[16:00] And I think Kiss was a lot like that. It sort of never really got any traction with people because even though it was beautiful to look at,

[16:12] it's still from a gameplay standpoint, always seemed like a game that just wasn't quite polished and wasn't worth talking about right at all.

[16:24] And then right from there, you had Game of Thrones come in and sort of take the spotlight away.

[16:31] You had Spider-Man VE being revealed.

[16:34] And all of a sudden, it started to become like a distant memory kind of pen.

[16:39] It really faded fast in terms of the hype around this pen.

[16:44] And then Ghostbusters rumors started happening and the leaks started happening.

[16:48] And all of a sudden you had three stirrings that were newer ahead of it.

[16:54] And it just seemed like it was this forgotten title. It really did.

[16:59] And I think that sucked. I think it sucked for the owners of Kiss. I think it sucks for fans of the band.

[17:04] I think it sucks for people who really went in on it and sort of invested in this machine.

[17:13] And so I hate to see them wait eight to nine months because that's just a long freaking time to have that thing sitting in your game room or your living room

[17:22] and just staring at it waiting for it to come alive. I think that's too long.

[17:25] I don't think that should ever happen again. Okay, that's I want to say that.

[17:29] And then even when the code finally did come out, it was very hard to read all the different issues people were having with the code update.

[17:39] It seemed to be just updating the damn code wasn't easy for people that it was buggy that there were certain things with like SD cards to update it.

[17:47] Certain people tried to do updates and all of a sudden it wasn't detecting balls.

[17:52] Certain people were having problems with their vertical up kicks.

[17:56] So it's just I just it's to add lemon to the wound.

[18:03] It's just annoying that people are spending like their hard-earned money, they're getting these machines.

[18:08] And then they have to like update it with code and then even then that's creating issues and more headaches for people.

[18:15] I really really really hope that KISS can get the due diligence it deserves.

[18:22] And I think my final point on this machine is I think what makes it painful for KISS fans is not just the fact that you know selecting the city still does nothing.

[18:32] Yeah, like I think that's kind of like why would you have this thing to do that does nothing but whatever.

[18:40] I think what's hard for KISS fans is that they are following the footsteps of two musical pins that are phenomenal.

[18:49] Phenomenal and ACDC and Metallica.

[18:52] I think those two pinball machines when it comes to musical pins have been really home runs for Stern.

[18:59] And I'm not the biggest fan of either one of those machines in the sense of I just don't love musical pins.

[19:07] I like more sort of story-based games and themes from movies that I can relate to the storylines.

[19:13] But that being said, I do like ACDC and Metallica music and you know I watch people play ACDC and God help me if I try to understand people when they explain the code and what they do in that game.

[19:25] But people love it and it is really like a very very popular game and it's bringing people a lot of joy.

[19:31] And same with Metallica people love Metallica and I understand why it's very rewarding both those games every wording shots have a lot to do.

[19:40] And I think KISS has just been like sort of like the music pin that time forgot.

[19:44] And I think it's got to be frustrating for KISS owners to look and see their game be half of the child that Metallica and ACDC are.

[19:54] So hopefully Stern will keep improving it and get it to the point where the code can be pretty final.

[20:02] And I guess my last point is what's the finishing number for a code?

[20:07] When I see version 1.28, like what does that mean?

[20:12] Like are we is to the goal? Is 1.75 the goal? Is 3.0 the goal?

[20:18] I don't think these random numbers 1.28, like what was the code before? Was it 1.27? I don't think so.

[20:26] I don't know, it just feels like all this like weird marketing spin that just doesn't really mean much.

[20:31] So that's all I got to say is you can't wait nine months to update code and then not deliver a code that's going to blow people away.

[20:39] So hopefully we get that fix real soon.

[20:43] Why are people still trying to speculate what happened with J-pop? That thread just will not die.

[20:51] And it's the same conversation now for months. It's got over 18,000 comments.

[21:00] John doesn't know how to manufacture a pinball machine.

[21:04] How many different ways can can frolic and iceman and different members of the community chime in?

[21:11] And they're all saying the same thing and they're all right. The guy is a creative, I think genius.

[21:18] And he's the worst businessman on the planet. And he doesn't know how to manufacture anything.

[21:25] But we keep saying it. Can we just like close that thread or lock it until there's an actual update?

[21:32] No one's going to see their money back. And no one's going to see their pinball machines.

[21:37] I think everyone who's in on Ranz and Magical just needs to accept that needs to chuck it off as a loss.

[21:43] We've all gone in on investments in life that didn't pin out. This one is not going to pin out.

[21:50] So we're about to see Rob Zombies go out the door from spooky and I am begging everyone who's in on that game to please just order the $200 LED toys that he's offering.

[22:04] This game is super limited. You might as well get it with all the bells and whistles that they're going to offer you.

[22:12] I see some people are always whining about the fact that he's offering these options.

[22:19] Everyone's always like, well why don't you just include it with the game.

[22:22] Work goes into making a lot of these mods as much as people think they're just bought off of eBay and drilled with some LEDs.

[22:32] So that's what I'm asking everyone. This game is super limited.

[22:38] Everyone is going to hold its value with only 300 coming out. You might as well pack it with everything spooky offers and have peace of mind

[22:49] versus trying to install this stuff later. And if you're gripping about the price, I kind of feel like you're not even in on the game

[22:57] because you know that this game is going to go up in price for sure. So please, LED it out.

[23:05] So on 4, 15, 2016, which was what 12 days ago, the Big Lebowski was announced to be shipping by Dutch Pimble.

[23:23] And I wonder where those three are going and if there's more than three going out. But I'm really curious to see how long it takes from that date for those Pimble machines to land in people's homes.

[23:38] I know there's a lot of speculation on how they're really going to handle the overseas shipping. Is it going to require these like a bulk of 40 to go out at a time and if that's the case, what does that mean?

[23:53] What does that mean for people who order these games? And I think for all the guys in the states who collect Pimble machines and buy Pimble machines.

[24:03] But most of everyone here has probably usually bought from Stern or bought from other owners in the US and shipping games hasn't been too difficult.

[24:16] But with highway and Dutch coming from overseas, how will that be? Will it work out?

[24:23] And I still think it's a little uncertain to see how these companies can convivably do this and keep consumers happy.

[24:33] I'm still perplexed at how highway has an air freight charge that's almost a third cheaper than Dutch is. So not sure how that's even possible.

[24:44] But it seems that some of these companies, I've just given up even questioning any of the financial moves a lot of these companies make.

[24:54] And I've sort of just conceded to the fact that the Pimble world is in odd world where you have individuals who may be self-financing their companies and losing tons of money to make it work.

[25:09] You might have individuals who are doing unethical things to make the numbers work. You may have companies that are fleecing their customers and making huge profits to make it work.

[25:21] And who knows and everything in between. So it's I can't really speculate what's going on. But let's start a countdown.

[25:29] So we're 12 days since they said it's now shipping. Let's see how many days until the Big Lebowski actually gets opened up and played by somebody. So let the countdown begin.

[25:39] Something that I haven't really talked much about on the show is my new pen, my tales of the Arabian Knights.

[25:47] And the reason why I haven't talked much about it is I only played it for two games before taking apart some of the pieces to send out to Mike Chestnut to get brass played it.

[26:01] And I realized after I did it that that was a huge mistake. I waited about almost two weeks to get the game shipped from Canada to New York City.

[26:13] It finally arrived and I spent almost the entire day and tonight putting some mods into the game.

[26:23] So stuff like what did I do? I put mirror blades, put a topper on it. The mirror blades were paying to put into that game. What else did I do?

[26:37] Now that I think about it like it might wait I did more than just that. The brass door, some mylar. So just different things. I spent like the day sort of like just tinkering with the things.

[26:49] Then taking the parts off to get brass. Now I did realize after I bought this game that it's beautiful. It has a CPR gold play field. It has, it looks brand new on the top.

[27:03] And then I noticed that underneath it underneath the play field nothing was restored at all. And it was look like it was a...

[27:13] ... a route it pin that was really neat as TLC underneath. So just a few things that I'm getting done initially is the the Ball Tro having Eddie Kramer took it and polished it up.

[27:23] things that I'm getting done initially is the ball tro having Eddie Kramer took it and

[27:31] polished it up and got it back to like sort of like a pretty new looking appearance because

[27:36] I just wanted to make sure that the parts where the ball would interact would would be nice and

[27:41] polished this way the ball wouldn't get scratched up and scratched the new play field.

[27:48] I something that annoyed me though is this game was rebuilt the guy repopulate the play field

[27:55] and he did a beautiful job but he didn't put plastic protectors on any of the plastics and

[28:01] it's like if you're going to go through all the trouble to repopulate a play field like Toden which

[28:06] is a pain in the ass to repopulate why wouldn't you put plastic protectors because there are

[28:13] definitely some plastics on the machine that are very vulnerable to breaking because of their

[28:18] position. Now so I took it upon myself to install plastic protectors but for anyone who has

[28:26] the tails of the Arabian Knights that is not an easy thing to do after everything has been

[28:31] repopulated and you have to almost take off all of the ramps and do a lot of work so I decided

[28:39] to install them in areas that I could get to pretty easily which is taking off the left and the

[28:43] right ramp but any further disassembly of the machine I sort of just left it at that I didn't

[28:51] want to pull the whole thing apart but just advice out there for anyone who's ever rebuilding or

[28:57] repopulating a play field put down your mylar and put down your plastic protectors before you finish

[29:07] because even just going back and trying to put mylar around some of the the magnet circles

[29:13] by the pop bumpers with such a pain in the ass and I did as best as I could but I also just

[29:19] threw up my arms and were like I'm not dealing as I'm not taking apart the whole game to

[29:24] to bullet proof it so that was how I spent my last weekend with my tails the Arabian Knights

[29:31] and I'm hoping to get back the parts from Mike Chestnut in a hopefully within like a week or two

[29:39] so I can actually play the game it's it's just been sitting here it's beautiful but I haven't

[29:45] played it and I'll say this if anyone has a tails the Arabian Knights and is looking for

[29:51] the laserific topper they only made 26 hit me up at canada pinball at gmail.com and we can talk

[30:01] all right so let's see one I want to sort of close today's episode just something that I noticed

[30:07] recently and that is there's a lot of pinball machines sort of high-end pinball machines I see going

[30:14] up for sale and I think we're going to see a lot more of this I see a big bang bar just went up for

[30:22] sale four hours ago for 19,500 dollars there's a there's a tron elite that's recently on the market

[30:34] there's a bunch of iron man there's a bunch of since sims pinball parties there's just a lot

[30:41] there seems to be a little bit more going up for sale recently and is a wizard vase emerald

[30:48] sitting limited edition they went up eight hours ago and I think we're just going to start to see a

[30:54] lot more pinball machines go on the market and we all know why there is a lot of new pinball

[31:01] machines coming out that people want and that's a good thing and if anyone thinks that the pinball

[31:07] market is not going to decrease though because of the increase in supply of of games and new inbox

[31:14] games I think they're dead wrong and I think it's going to be very interesting this next year to

[31:19] see where stuff nets out and tiger law said it best when I interviewed tiger law months ago he said

[31:26] something that was interesting he said you got to look at the pinball top 100 much differently in the

[31:33] next year or two because with the new pinball machines coming out that have new new technology new

[31:40] innovation they're just new right there they're they're more exciting and appealing to players

[31:47] because they're new you're going to start to see if a teeks that end with games like Adams family

[31:53] lore the rings twilight zone medieval madness attack from Mars you it's just it's just natural

[32:05] you don't see people playing the same video game over and over and over again for for for decades

[32:12] and I think the same is going to be true with pinball there was a time when there wasn't

[32:18] there wasn't any new pinball coming out that was really that spectacular and I think during that

[32:23] window people looked backwards they looked to see what were the games that were once great that

[32:29] would be amazing to own in my home and that's where sort of the love affairs with the

[32:34] Adams family is the medieval madness is the things that people could bring into their homes just

[32:39] remember there weren't many of those machines back in the day that were home use only

[32:44] but now and I'll say this after getting a tells the Arabian Knights and lifting open the play field

[32:50] and you know seeing a game from 1996 and seeing what condition those games are in and

[32:57] and what's going on in a machine like that it's it makes me want to have a brand new in box ghost

[33:06] busters more than anything because there's just something about a home use only pin that you can

[33:11] never really replicate with these machines from yesterday I was like yes I know you can restore

[33:16] these older machines and you can make them as good as new again that's a lot of work and it's

[33:23] still the components and what's in the machine it's just not going to be as good as the newer

[33:29] stuff that's coming out so I think we're going to see a lot more pinball machines up for sale

[33:35] I think a lot of people that think they're going to get close to a one-to-one return on their

[33:39] investment are going to be in for a root awakening in 2016 I really do and I think things we're

[33:45] going to settle down maybe in a year or two but again we'll see but I think you're going to see

[33:51] a lot more people throwing up their $12,000 trying alleys and their $18,000 $19,000 big bang bars

[34:00] and other other high-priced titles so that they can go grab a ghost busters premium or a hobby

[34:07] or or try and offer a little bit you know more money to snack someone's rob zombie I think you're

[34:12] going to see that happening and then with the big Lebowski with Alien with you know what else is

[34:21] coming out to share it's it's there's just going to be a lot more freeing up of capital to get

[34:27] into these machines and that's fine I think you know it's the market's going to have to go down a

[34:32] little bit because all these use games just can't keep going for a $7,000 $8,000 it's just not going

[34:39] to keep happening all right ladies and gentlemen well that's it I am thank you for for being patient
