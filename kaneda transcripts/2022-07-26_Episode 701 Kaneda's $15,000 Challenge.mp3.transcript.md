[00:00] What's wrong with the world, mama?

[00:01] People never like them, God, no mama.

[00:04] I think the whole world's addicted to the drama.

[00:06] Only attracted to things that bring the trauma.

[00:13] Welcome, everybody, to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the world's number one pinball reviewer and

[00:18] your favorite pinball podcast.

[00:20] What are we doing?

[00:21] Two shows, two days in a row, episode 701.

[00:24] Thank you to all the new club members.

[00:26] We're at, what, 528 club members.

[00:30] So here's what I want to do on this episode.

[00:31] I want to talk about what's happening in pinball because we didn't talk about all the news.

[00:36] I want to talk about how I think there is just fear permeating through the pinball distributor

[00:42] landscape.

[00:43] They know they all overbought, but I actually have a lot of empathy for my dealers and distributor

[00:48] friends because it's hard.

[00:49] Like, when you think about it, let's just start there right now.

[00:51] Let's just start on that topic.

[00:53] It's really hard being a dealer and a distributor and knowing how much product to buy right

[00:59] now, right?

[01:00] We've got maybe a recession coming.

[01:02] There's no guarantee it's coming, but it seems like it is going to come.

[01:06] There's a lot of fear in the media about it, but that's what the media does, right?

[01:10] They make us afraid of everything, like shark attacks, recessions.

[01:14] You can't go on an amusement ride unless you're going to fear death.

[01:17] Like, everything is fear-mongering to get you to click on the stories, so I don't know,

[01:22] is the economy going to go down?

[01:23] Probably.

[01:24] We've been printing free money for a really long time.

[01:27] People have been taking all these loans with 1% interest rates.

[01:31] You can't just give people free money and then not have inflation.

[01:34] Then when you have inflation, people stop spending as much.

[01:37] And look, in a world in which everything is more expensive, who hasn't gone to the gas

[01:41] station and all of a sudden it's like 4 to 6 bucks a gallon?

[01:45] And so now, if it's a couple hundred bucks to fill up your SUV, maybe $300, are you going

[01:49] to buy a $10,000 pinball machine?

[01:51] The thing about this is, look, I know we went through the 2008 recession and pinball survived

[01:57] barely, but back then, remember people, we didn't have 9 pinball companies trying to

[02:01] sell games.

[02:03] Like Stern held on by a hair's breath and made it through.

[02:07] Now Stern made it through, but there wasn't like 9 companies trying to survive.

[02:11] See, I always have said this.

[02:13] If a recession hits, I think Stern will be fine.

[02:16] I think Jersey Jack will be fine.

[02:18] I think CGC will be fine.

[02:20] I think it's all of the little boutique companies that are going to be in trouble.

[02:24] But also the dealers and distributors with inventory.

[02:28] This is a really interesting topic and I would love to get a dealer on to talk.

[02:32] Maybe I'll get Joe Newhart to come on.

[02:34] I would love Zach Many to join the show and talk about this.

[02:37] Because if you're a dealer or a distributor, think about if you're in their shoes.

[02:41] How many games do you buy right now?

[02:44] How do you plan for the coming economic slowdown?

[02:48] A year ago, everything was flying off the shelf.

[02:51] A year ago, they couldn't keep inventory in stock.

[02:55] And they've seen people sort of spending over for the price of a pro, over sticker for premiums.

[03:01] And they've seen some of these LEs double in price.

[03:04] And the entire model of how distributors deal with manufacturers is they have to make some

[03:09] sort of number commitment.

[03:11] If they want to get this number of LEs, they've got to commit to buying this many pros and

[03:16] premiums.

[03:17] I'm not sure how it works with Jersey Jack.

[03:19] I'm not sure how it works with Chicago Gaming Company.

[03:22] But ultimately, you know, these distributors are writing pretty big checks to these manufacturers

[03:27] and they don't make their money until they find a customer for those games.

[03:31] And times have been great.

[03:32] Like it's been a great couple of years to be a pinball distributor.

[03:36] And obviously all of them would have loved to have had more inventory when times were

[03:41] hot.

[03:42] But remember, most of what Stern did in 2021-2022 was make up the back orders that all of these

[03:50] distributors had with them.

[03:51] And we haven't seen a new Stern game in a while.

[03:54] We just got Toy Story 4, which is not selling that well.

[03:57] Don't believe the hype people.

[03:58] A lot of these distributors now are starting to attack people who are saying the game isn't

[04:02] great.

[04:03] But ultimately, it doesn't matter what a podcaster says.

[04:06] It doesn't matter what a tournament player says.

[04:08] It doesn't matter what anybody says.

[04:11] The market will determine whether or not a game is great.

[04:15] The market will determine if the game's value is there.

[04:18] That's why I love covering the pinball market more than the rule sets or more than the pathway

[04:24] to scoring.

[04:25] Because it's just an interesting thing to see.

[04:28] Since I've been in this hobby, 701 episodes, I've seen Stern-Eli's almost double in price.

[04:34] I've seen Jersey Jack games double in price.

[04:36] I've seen all of these games go much higher in price.

[04:40] I've seen some of you spend crazy amounts of money on games they couldn't even give

[04:45] away when they came out.

[04:46] I mean, you could get a stranger things Ellie, new inbox for like eight months.

[04:50] Nobody wanted it.

[04:51] Now people want 16,000 for it.

[04:53] It's crazy.

[04:54] And I didn't see it coming.

[04:55] If I saw this coming, if I saw the pinflation of 2020-2021 coming, I would have stocked

[05:01] up on Pirates of the Caribbean CEs and so would you.

[05:05] You know, so when you see what's going on right now with Toy Story, it's a really interesting

[05:09] thing to watch.

[05:10] I mean, a lot of distributors are sitting on inventory.

[05:14] They don't have the physical inventory there yet.

[05:17] Like some people have Ellie's new inbox just sitting there.

[05:20] The real issue with Toy Story is going to be the collector's editions of these machines

[05:25] and they need to find a thousand buyers for this game at $15,000 a pop.

[05:32] And you and I both know what's going to happen.

[05:34] You and I both know what is already happening is that nobody sees $15,000 in value in this

[05:43] game and I challenge any pinball podcaster out there.

[05:46] I challenge any fanboy out there to explain to me why you see $15,000 in value in Toy

[05:55] Story for collector's edition.

[05:57] Nobody will say why because nobody wants to die on that hill.

[06:02] Nobody wants to lose their credibility and say I see $15,000 in value in this particular

[06:10] machine.

[06:11] What they will do is go to another machine and say, well, look what happened to Guns

[06:15] and Roses or look what happened to Iron Maiden LE or look what happened to Godzilla LE.

[06:20] But you can't do that.

[06:22] You got to look at this particular game.

[06:25] Other games went up in value because people thought the games were great or felt they

[06:30] were great or maybe the games were just great games.

[06:34] And the problem with this is on day one, the most expensive collector's edition in the

[06:39] history of Jersey Jack Pinball, nobody sees the value.

[06:42] The distributors know if they didn't want this game to be $15,000, why would they want

[06:47] this game to be $15,000?

[06:49] Why would they want to have less of a buyer base for this game?

[06:52] Now here's the problem.

[06:53] They've all committed to it.

[06:54] Like 900 of these collector's editions have been bought by distributors.

[06:59] And do you think they've sold every single one?

[07:02] And then what is going to happen?

[07:03] And this is what they're nervous about.

[07:05] What is going to happen when they start to see people sell their spots for less than

[07:09] $2,500, right?

[07:11] When you're able to get a discount on the machine.

[07:14] That's when it starts to collapse.

[07:16] That's when the bottom falls out on a game's value.

[07:19] We saw the exact same thing happen on Halloween and Ultraman.

[07:23] And we're already, before this game is even out, we're already seeing the same excuses.

[07:28] Well, maybe they can do something with the code.

[07:30] People, it's not the code.

[07:32] The code is not the reason why people don't see the value.

[07:35] It's $15,000.

[07:38] Wake up, people.

[07:39] If you put two Toy Story CEs next to each other, that's $30,000 in pinball excitement.

[07:46] And I get it.

[07:47] I get it.

[07:48] For all of these years, we were so spoiled.

[07:50] For all of these years, we bought pinball machines and they turned out to be worth more

[07:55] than we even bought them for.

[07:57] And that was a great thing.

[07:58] It was like this crazy economy in which you almost could never lose.

[08:03] You could never lose.

[08:04] Even if you went in on an L.E. or a C.E. and you wanted to transfer your spot, you could easily find

[08:09] someone to buy your spot for what you paid for it.

[08:12] But those days are over.

[08:13] And so now you're starting to see a lot of nervousness, a lot of people with a lot of inventory

[08:19] who are basically saying, he's wrong.

[08:21] The game is better than you think.

[08:23] And it's not just play, it's just play.

[08:25] I'm telling you right now, the game's fun to shoot.

[08:27] I played it again.

[08:28] I played it for like 30 more times.

[08:30] And I'm going to tell you again, it's a fun game to shoot, but there aren't that many

[08:34] interesting shots.

[08:35] And the story of the movie doesn't come through at all.

[08:38] And I'm going to ask everybody out there for $15,000, where is the value?

[08:42] Where is the value?

[08:43] What's the main mech they engineered?

[08:45] Where did all the money go?

[08:46] Like where did the money go?

[08:48] Does anyone want to ask that question about Canada?

[08:50] Come on, sit down.

[08:51] I want to sit Pat Lawler down and say, Pat, where is the $15,000 in this machine?

[08:56] Where?

[08:57] Where did you put it?

[08:58] How much did it cost?

[08:59] How many coils are on it?

[09:00] Do coils even cost that much money?

[09:01] Like where's the money?

[09:03] How much do you think it costs to make this machine?

[09:05] Does anyone want to ask that question?

[09:06] Does anyone even want to have this speculation?

[09:09] Like how much money do you think it costs Jersey Jack Pinball to make each toy story?

[09:15] Can they tell us that?

[09:16] They won't tell us that.

[09:17] They'll never tell us that.

[09:18] Nobody wants to tell you how much a machine costs, what the bomb is.

[09:22] Nobody wants to tell you how good sales are.

[09:24] Like every single person out there, not just me, everybody.

[09:28] Everybody is speculating on how good a game sells.

[09:31] I can tell you this right now.

[09:32] The only company out there where I'm like, okay, they sold everyone is Spooky.

[09:36] Spooky sold every single game or they sold through every single game.

[09:40] I don't know how many Toy Story LEs are ordered.

[09:43] I don't know how many CEs are sold and nobody else does.

[09:46] The only person who knows that are the people over at Jersey Jack.

[09:50] You don't know how many Godzilla's sold.

[09:52] You don't know how many Godzilla premium orders there are.

[09:55] You don't know how well Iron Maiden premium sold.

[09:58] You know how well Rush premium sold or how many pros are out there.

[10:01] Nobody knows.

[10:02] And the biggest thing made up ever was this, that half-stern games go overseas.

[10:06] That's not true.

[10:08] Half-Estearn's machines never went overseas.

[10:11] That was just a story they would cook up to create FOMO because then you thought that

[10:16] half of the LEs were going overseas.

[10:18] Oh, there's only going to be 250 Ghostbusters LEs in America.

[10:22] That's such hogwash.

[10:24] Half of the Ghostbusters LEs are not overseas.

[10:27] We've been fed these stories for so many years that I just love doing this show because

[10:31] I love calling BS on some of this.

[10:33] But here's what's not BS.

[10:35] Is that the pinball community right now is starting to look at all of this stuff a little

[10:40] bit differently.

[10:41] And that's good.

[10:42] Scalpers are getting driven out of the pinball marketplace and that's probably a good thing

[10:46] too.

[10:47] Distributors are getting a lot more cautious on what they order.

[10:52] And that's a good thing too.

[10:53] I'll tell you this right now.

[10:54] The ultimate power to tell a manufacturer this game is not good enough.

[10:58] We have power.

[10:59] But also think about all the dealers and distributors.

[11:02] If they don't place an order for like Galactic Tank Force or they don't place a huge order

[11:08] for Toy Story because they don't see the demand, that's going to make these manufacturers

[11:12] go back to the drawing board and come out with the game that has the level of demand

[11:18] and support from the distributors.

[11:20] I mean ultimately the distributors hold a lot of power with these manufacturers.

[11:24] They hold almost more power than we do as customers.

[11:27] But I think it's a really exciting time to be in pinball.

[11:30] It's a really exciting time to watch the way this market goes because everybody knows

[11:34] here's the thing we've never seen.

[11:36] We've never seen this in the history of pinball and I think we're going to see it over the

[11:40] next 12 months.

[11:41] We've never seen a company reduce the price of their game.

[11:46] They've always increased the price of their game.

[11:49] Yeah, but what happens if you come out with a game and it's priced too high and then the

[11:52] sales aren't there?

[11:53] How do you discount it?

[11:55] Do you then make your next game a little bit cheaper?

[11:57] I don't know.

[11:58] This is going to be really interesting.

[11:59] We haven't seen this in the history of pinball.

[12:01] A company reduce how much they want for a game.

[12:04] We've always seen them increase the price.

[12:06] But what if you went above the ceiling?

[12:08] What if you're asking for too much?

[12:09] What if you can't sustain a company with $12,000 and $15,000 products?

[12:15] Wizard of Oz was $6,500 people.

[12:18] Just remember that Wizard of Oz was $6,500 and it has twice as much in it as Toy Story.

[12:24] Twice as much in it as Toy Story and it was $6,500.

[12:28] You could argue it bankrupted Jersey Jack Pinball.

[12:30] Sure, it should have been more like $8,000, $9,000, but man, if Wizard of Oz came out

[12:36] today, think about it like this.

[12:38] If Toy Story CE is a $15,000 pinball machine, then Wizard of Oz CE would be $25,000.

[12:47] The whole thing is bonkers.

[12:49] Everybody knows it's crazy.

[12:50] Canadian pinball podcast just won't stop.

[12:53] Let's go on to Stern Pinball at Comic Con.

[12:55] I don't understand what happened there.

[12:58] Does anyone understand this?

[12:59] They went to Comic Con.

[13:00] They had Ozzy Osborn.

[13:02] They had Todd McFarlane, a huge drought Comic Con, and they set up a bunch of Mandalorians

[13:08] and I think some rushes, and then there was absolutely no news in the pinball world.

[13:13] What was the point of being there?

[13:15] Does someone know?

[13:16] Can someone let me know?

[13:17] Was this like a lifestyle brand move?

[13:19] Was it like, oh, we're just going to be here?

[13:21] Let's put two people here that people want to get autographs from and then have absolutely

[13:26] nothing to do with pinball.

[13:28] I don't know.

[13:29] It was really strange.

[13:30] I was waiting for a Venom announcement and here's what's crazy about it all.

[13:34] Is that Todd McFarlane created Venom.

[13:37] He's at your booth.

[13:38] You have a Venom machine coming.

[13:41] Ozzy Osborn was in a Venom comic book as the president.

[13:46] You have all of the elements to pull the curtain off of Venom and then you don't.

[13:51] Now look, I work in marketing.

[13:52] I don't need to give Jody and George advice, but this was just a pretty sad marketing move

[13:58] on their part.

[13:59] And here's why, because as much as Stern Pinball likes to think it's a lifestyle brand and

[14:04] people outside of pinball care about them, they don't.

[14:08] And they used all of their marketing channels to get us excited about Ozzy Osborn being

[14:13] at their booth, about Todd McFarlane being there, and then there was no payoff.

[14:18] The last thing you want to do in marketing is get people's expectations up that they're

[14:22] going to see something exciting and then it was just nothing.

[14:26] Noon on Friday at Comic Con.

[14:29] All they did was sign autographs.

[14:31] Wow, great job Stern.

[14:33] You came back and did absolutely nothing interesting.

[14:36] Now do I think there's going to be an Ozzy Osborn pinball machine down the road because

[14:40] of this?

[14:41] No.

[14:42] They've done this before with like Slayer and other things.

[14:45] I think this is just Jody Dankberg being like, I don't know, like we can do this.

[14:50] Let's just do it even if it doesn't make total sense.

[14:53] Is it a big deal?

[14:54] No.

[14:55] Do people care that much?

[14:56] Is it forgettable?

[14:57] Yes.

[14:58] Like a week later, no one will care that they were there.

[15:00] This won't sell them more pinball machines.

[15:02] And that's that.

[15:03] All right.

[15:04] So it begs the question, when are we going to see Venom?

[15:06] When are we going to see it?

[15:07] Are we going to see it in August?

[15:08] Hey, people, it's August next week.

[15:11] So Stern said like months ago, we are going to come back with our next Cornerstone game

[15:16] in August.

[15:17] So I fully expect us to see Stern's next game probably the end of this month, maybe early

[15:23] September.

[15:24] But it's coming.

[15:25] It's coming down the corner.

[15:26] And yes, it's going to be Brian Eddy's Venom.

[15:28] It's going to have Zambietti on artwork.

[15:31] And I think it's going to come out like any week now.

[15:34] The other thing too, like with it being August is I think this month is going to be pretty

[15:37] much a dead month.

[15:38] I don't think you're going to see any major announcements.

[15:41] I think you might see Cactus Canyon.

[15:43] Ellie's come out finally.

[15:45] I have no idea what's going on over there.

[15:48] Arguably the worst launch in pinball history.

[15:50] Arguably.

[15:51] It was a sloppiest launch ever.

[15:53] And the fact that he's making people wait almost a year to get their product, it's really

[15:57] lame.

[15:58] It really is lame.

[15:59] Think about it like this.

[16:00] It's August.

[16:01] They should have waited to Expo 2022 and then reveal the game and have like 500 of them

[16:06] built in boxes ready to go.

[16:08] And they all would have shipped out that weekend.

[16:10] Why did they reveal it a year ago?

[16:12] Makes absolutely no sense.

[16:13] All right.

[16:14] What else is going on?

[16:15] We're waiting on CGC.

[16:16] Spooky's finishing up the run of Ultraman and Halloween's.

[16:20] And then we're going to get some TNAs.

[16:21] And then we're on to Scooby-Doo.

[16:23] We know about that.

[16:25] What else is going on?

[16:26] Haggis.

[16:27] The lead programmer over at Haggis Pinball.

[16:29] I think it's Greg Selby.

[16:31] He's left the company.

[16:33] Now I know like you guys don't really care that much about Haggis, but the thing is this.

[16:37] Greg was one of the original founding partners with Damien.

[16:41] So him exiting the company is a big deal if you know the way the Haggis company is structured.

[16:47] Games are slowly trickling out.

[16:49] Like very slowly trickling out.

[16:52] And I've been speaking to some of the people who used to work over there.

[16:56] And I'm just going to say this.

[16:57] I hope you get your games.

[16:59] You can't get your money back.

[17:00] So I hope you get your games.

[17:02] From what I'm hearing, it's a very, very slow burn.

[17:06] And it's feeling eerily similar.

[17:08] I'm just going to say this.

[17:09] It's feeling very eerily similar to what happened with another boutique company.

[17:14] You know the name, but I'm not going to say anything more.

[17:17] Now I revealed on my last show that Marty's original theme might be the War of the Worlds.

[17:25] Will it be the Orson Welles War of the Worlds?

[17:27] The public domain theme that anybody can make.

[17:31] It's in public domain.

[17:32] He can use it.

[17:33] I don't know.

[17:34] Like Damien has said that Centaur is next.

[17:37] And then Marty's game would be after that.

[17:39] I would just be really nervous if I was one of you series ticket holders that gave like

[17:44] $4,500 for the next four or five games and it's non-refundable.

[17:48] I just don't know how they're going to make money doing it this way.

[17:52] They're still not transparent about how many games they're making a week.

[17:55] We don't even know how many fathoms they've made to date.

[17:58] Let me just ask them that.

[17:59] Marty and Damien, will you please tell the pinball community because you're over a year

[18:04] delayed on getting the games out?

[18:06] Will you please tell us how many fathoms to date you have made?

[18:11] If that is a secret, I think that is a huge red flag.

[18:15] Why is it a secret?

[18:17] Marty, you have a podcast.

[18:19] You go on your podcast and you hardly say anything about the company that you work for,

[18:27] the company that took non-refundable deposits from people.

[18:30] Can you please just tell us as of August of next week, how many fathoms have been made

[18:37] to date?

[18:38] That should not be a secret.

[18:41] People gave you money.

[18:42] You've been asking people to pay and fall for a while and I don't like the fact that

[18:47] they are keeping all of this a secret because it doesn't even matter Marty and Damien.

[18:52] Nobody can get their money back.

[18:54] So at least just come clean now and tell us the reality.

[18:57] Tell people what they can expect.

[18:59] I don't need to hear from the fanboys on Pinside who are spending 1700 bucks to air freight

[19:06] their games.

[19:07] That doesn't say anything.

[19:08] That doesn't symbolize anything because it might just be one or two games a week and

[19:12] if they have to make 250, do the math people.

[19:16] What else is going on in Pinball?

[19:17] I didn't want to talk about Deeproot again but my gosh, this thing just won't die.

[19:23] Deeproot is this entity that has not just nine lives, like 900 lives.

[19:28] So yesterday, the Deeproot.com had a countdown clock on it that ran out and it was revealed

[19:34] to the world that the person behind it and the person behind the puzzles was no other

[19:39] than Chris Turner of Turner Logic and Chris worked at Deeproot Pinball with Robert Mueller

[19:45] on all of these games.

[19:47] He's a software and a mechanical engineer guy and here's what he revealed to us.

[19:52] That he was here to tell us that he caught the Pinball bug while working with Deeproot

[19:56] Pinball and while he's sad nobody will get to see the fruits of his labor, that he is

[20:01] going to go on a journey to make his own Pinball machines.

[20:06] Have you fallen back in your chair yet?

[20:08] I tried to give him advice and he deleted my comments twice on his YouTube channel.

[20:13] He's off to a good start.

[20:14] The mistake number one you can make is try to avoid Canada's Pinball podcast when you're

[20:18] trying to launch your boutique company.

[20:20] But we all know one thing, that Chris Turner and his mission to make a Pinball company

[20:25] will not be successful.

[20:27] I'm not like the rest of you.

[20:28] I see people on YouTube being like, good luck.

[20:30] You've got my support.

[20:32] No people.

[20:33] Wake up.

[20:34] This guy is not going to be able to make a Pinball company.

[20:37] How many times do we have to see these people who know nothing about Pinball manufacturing

[20:43] thinking they can make a Pinball manufacturing company?

[20:46] And the advice I gave this guy is the most solid advice he'll ever get.

[20:51] He is into software and mechanical engineering.

[20:55] He has a skill set that one company who knows how to manufacture needs and that company

[21:01] is Spooky Pinball.

[21:02] And so Chris Turner, don't be silly, bro.

[21:06] Call up Charlie Emory and work with him on improving Spooky's software and improving

[21:12] their mechanical engineering because Charlie's got the hardest part figured out.

[21:17] He's got manufacturing figured out.

[21:19] If you want to go down a journey to make a Pinball manufacturing company, here's what's

[21:24] going to happen.

[21:25] You're going to lose your money.

[21:27] You're going to get your family to invest in it.

[21:29] And I love how these guys are all like, I'm not taking any money.

[21:32] Okay, cool.

[21:33] You're going to personally finance a Pinball manufacturing company.

[21:37] And that's been successful.

[21:38] How many times?

[21:40] Zero.

[21:41] Zero.

[21:42] Nobody personally has financed a Pinball endeavor that's ever worked.

[21:45] Stern Pinball has huge investors.

[21:48] Jersey Jack has huge investors.

[21:50] Someone else is bankrolled either by another part of the business or some ancillary business

[21:56] or they do pre-order dollars.

[21:58] I don't know how rich Chris Turner is, but bro, I'm telling you right now, starting a

[22:04] Pinball company is the fastest way to turn a few million into a few hundred dollars.

[22:09] And that's what's going to happen.

[22:11] And look, just watching the video of the guy like interviewing the dude who solved the

[22:14] puzzle, I just kind of felt bad for all of them.

[22:18] It's like he doesn't understand.

[22:19] Why would he do this?

[22:20] Like why would he play a game with the deep root URL as a way to launch his initiative?

[22:26] I'm going to hear it tell you right now.

[22:27] I don't find it funny.

[22:28] So many people lost money with deep root and Chris Turner, guess who paid your salary all

[22:33] of those years you were working at deep root.

[22:35] It was stolen money from old ladies who were investing in deep root funds.

[22:40] They didn't know who you were.

[22:42] They didn't know what Pinball was.

[22:43] And I think everyone involved with deep root Pinball, not just Chris Turner, but anyone

[22:48] over there.

[22:49] Shut up.

[22:50] Go away.

[22:51] We don't want to hear from you.

[22:52] We don't think it's funny.

[22:54] We don't want to be playful with the deep root URL.

[22:57] I think everyone needs to show respect to the people who got their lives savings burned

[23:01] by Robert Mueller.

[23:03] He was a fraud.

[23:04] He was a charlatan.

[23:05] He was a criminal.

[23:06] And you all worked for a criminal.

[23:08] And I'm not asking you to take the same blame as him, but I don't want to play games with

[23:13] the deep root URL as a cute way to announce your pinball journey that you think is going

[23:19] to be fun.

[23:20] It's not going to be fun, Chris Turner.

[23:22] It's going to crash and burn like every other pinball venture that is created by people

[23:27] like this.

[23:28] They're delusional.

[23:29] I don't know what it is about Pinball that gets people who make a few dollars in another

[23:34] industry that makes them think they can open a manufacturing company.

[23:38] It is a blue collar job that requires decades of experience.

[23:43] If Chris Turner wants to know how to manufacture, then go take a job on the line at Stern Pinball.

[23:49] You don't know what you're talking about, bro.

[23:51] You have never manufactured anything.

[23:53] And yeah, I might be a little stride in here because you deleted my comments, but

[23:56] Canada won and Turner Pinball zero.

[23:59] All right, I'm all fired up.

[24:01] Wow.

[24:01] Canada, you're not championing a new pinball venture.

[24:04] Well, that's everyone else's job.

[24:06] Everyone else just loves everything happening in pinball, but I'm just a realist people.

[24:10] It's a joke.

[24:11] And I don't ever want to talk about deep root or Turner pinball again.

[24:14] Like, when are we going to hear from him?

[24:15] Like five years from now?

[24:16] When he tries to bring out Raza and food truck?

[24:19] All right, everybody, we're back.

[24:21] Canada's back.

[24:22] John's still not talking to me.

[24:24] Are we going to see the illegal topper from Godzilla today?

[24:27] Who knows?

[24:28] Who knows?

[24:29] I'll make it up with him.

[24:30] He know you can't stay mad at Canada forever.

[24:32] I mean, that's the thing.

[24:33] You just, you can't.

[24:34] You can't do it.

[24:35] I'll eventually wear you down.

[24:36] What's the phrase?

[24:37] I'll grow on you again.

[24:38] Like I will.

[24:39] Like this shows a lot of fun.

[24:40] I want to thank you guys for the support.

[24:41] I enjoy doing it every week.

[24:43] I know you enjoy listening.

[24:44] We'll be back.

[24:45] We'll be back with more episodes of Canada's pinball podcast.

[24:49] I think it's going to be a little bit of a slow August.

[24:51] It's going to be everyone begging you to buy toy stories.

[24:54] Like that's going to be the story of August.

[24:56] Like all the dealers begging you to buy their toy stories.

[24:59] And then we're going to see Venom and then we're going to see Galactic Tank Force or

[25:03] whatever David Fix has coming down the pipeline.

[25:05] And that's it.

[25:06] Like nothing happening right now.

[25:08] Let's focus on, you know, getting value from these manufacturers.

[25:11] I think that's the key.

[25:12] I think everyone's woken up.

[25:13] I think it's a brand new community out there.

[25:15] Like once you start charging over $10,000, people wake up more.

[25:19] They start to pay more attention and they start to demand more in these games.

[25:24] And that's a good thing.

[25:25] And that's the drum we all should be beating.

[25:27] We will pay this money manufacturers, but you got to give us more.

[25:31] You can't just give us a game like that.

[25:33] Everybody have a great day.

[25:34] I'll talk to you soon.

[25:35] Thank you.

[25:36] Thank you.

[25:37] Thank you.

[25:38] Thank you.

[25:39] Thank you.

[25:40] Thank you.

[25:41] Thank you.

[25:42] Thank you.

[25:43] Thank you.

[25:44] Thank you.

[25:45] Thank you.

[25:46] Thank you.

[25:47] Thank you.

[25:48] Thank you.

[25:49] Thank you.

[25:50] Thank you.

[25:51] Thank you.

[25:52] Thank you.

[25:53] Thank you.

[25:54] Thank you.

[25:55] Thank you.

[25:56] Thank you.

[25:57] Thank you.

[25:58] Thank you.

[25:59] Thank you.

[26:00] Thank you.

[26:01] Thank you.

[26:02] Thank you.

[26:03] Thank you.
