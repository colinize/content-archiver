[00:00] Happy Saturday morning people, welcome!

[00:22] To episode 452 of Canadian Pimball Podcast, it feels lonely now.

[00:26] I feel like there's just not as many Pimball Podcasts on the airwaves.

[00:31] Can't wait do they come back just like they were before!

[00:35] So what are we going to talk about on this episode of Canadian Pimball Podcast?

[00:38] Well, I want to talk about the news, I want to talk about some rumors, but I also want to bring up,

[00:43] and I'm going to start with it on this episode.

[00:46] I want to talk about what I think has been the biggest news, the biggest innovation,

[00:52] the most important thing we've seen with our own eyes in all of Pimball that happened over the

[00:59] past few days, and it's gotten some conversation, but it really hasn't been talked about and

[01:06] discussed the way it should be talked about.

[01:08] And I've invited these guys to come on the show to talk about this innovation, because I think

[01:14] without a doubt, if you're someone who buys modern Pimball machines and you're someone who spends

[01:19] a lot of money on Pimball, it is unbelievable to me that a few gentlemen in Australia by the

[01:27] name of Haggis Pimball have shown us how to make a Pimball play field strong enough to withstand

[01:37] a hit from a sledgehammer, a hit from a metal hammer, and this is it, like this is what all of you

[01:45] out there who are opening new inbox stern games and trying to make excuses for all those craters

[01:51] and dimples, and all you guys who have bought Jersey Jack games and have pooling around the post

[01:57] and have chipped artwork, and now have a spare play field under the bed that you're never going

[02:03] to ever do a play field swap because that costs $2,000. This is what, this is what real innovation

[02:12] looks like, and I want to talk about that first because I think this should become the thing that

[02:18] all of us that are buying new inbox Pimball machines. This is the kind of innovation that we should

[02:25] be asking the manufacturers to implement in all games moving forward. I mean, this is sort of like

[02:34] the invention of ABS brakes, power steering, flat screen TVs, the DVD, you know, the networks,

[02:44] you know, streaming services, this is the kind of innovation if you're to ask yourself that every

[02:52] single home buyer wants in their game, an indestructible play field, and it's not hard, and the

[03:01] scary part is this, it's not even that innovative. This method of using a polycarbonate or some sort

[03:09] of, you know, hard plastic that is clear, that is where the artwork is reverse printed onto it,

[03:17] and that sits over the wood of the game. Okay, here's, and then, and then all of a sudden,

[03:22] it's indestructible. You're never going to get a single dimple ever. You're never going to get

[03:28] it cracking. You're never going to get artwork to wear through. You're never going to get clear

[03:33] code issues ever, ever again, and the game will play exactly the same if not better, and I don't

[03:40] buy the excuse that a Pimball is meant to roll over wood. A Pimball is, come on. It's meant to

[03:45] roll over a flat surface. It's, if you design it with this in mind, and these are your white

[03:51] woods, like what's, you know, I don't know, it's, it's going to play fine. I mean, I know there's

[03:55] always those arguments, while you're adding a little bit of height, BS. All right, so here's a deal.

[03:59] Here's a deal. Haggis Pimball in Australia, they've shown us that this thing is indestructible.

[04:04] Now, here's my, here's my thing on this. What happens now? What happens now? I mean, this is pretty,

[04:11] they, first of all, they stole deep roots thunder. I don't know what deep root has planned. I don't know

[04:16] if it's this similar type of process, but this was everything that Robert was promising, and it just

[04:22] goes to show when you wait too long, someone else can come in and do it what you were planning to do.

[04:28] Now, deep root might have a whole different method of making play fields indestructible. All right,

[04:32] we'll see if they can even, you know, do what Haggis has shown us. But here's a thing. This is not new.

[04:38] This was, this was considered in the 1990s, and there are interviews that talk about this,

[04:44] that the Pimball industry back in the 1990s was exploring a similar method to make Pimball

[04:51] Machines indestructible. And the reason why they did not implement this approach into Pimball

[04:58] is very simple is that the manufacturers wanted the games to wear out. They wanted the games to

[05:07] fall apart so that operators would buy the next game. This reminds me so much of a company I used

[05:15] to work for, and that's Dyson. When he invented the bagless vacuum cleaners, guess what happened?

[05:21] Nobody, Hoover, all the big companies didn't want to adopt that technology because they wanted to

[05:27] sell you the bags. Now, look, here's what's weird about Pimball is right now the way the Pimball

[05:33] industry is. I don't think Stern wants your games to wear out. I don't think Jersey Jack wants your

[05:39] games to wear out. I don't think Spooky wants your games to wear out. I think that they understand

[05:44] that the home buyer wants something to remain perfect because to them all these wear and tear

[05:51] issues are headaches. There are annoyances. There are not something that creates loyalty and repeat

[05:57] customers. So I don't think that that's the case anymore, which even makes it more ridiculous.

[06:04] That in 2020, knowing that this can be implemented, knowing that this approach and this method is

[06:11] available, it makes it even more crazy to me that none of these big manufacturers have figured this

[06:17] out, have implemented this into modern Pimball, and we're still making games 30, 40-year-old methods

[06:25] in terms of how they're making these play fields. They're still going to Miracle Playfields.

[06:30] When clearly, clearly, there's an issue and people want to keep making excuses for it.

[06:37] I don't even want to talk about the past anymore because it almost feels like we've been shown

[06:43] what the future of Pimball can be. So I am here talking to you, the listener of Canadian Pimball

[06:49] podcast, and many of you are buying these expensive new inbox games. Many of you have home collections

[06:55] in which you want to keep your games as perfect as possible. I'm here to tell you that this is the

[07:01] single biggest thing that we should be asking our manufacturers to implement into their games

[07:08] moving forward. Don't just sit back and moaning grown about it on Pinside,

[07:15] right to your manufacturers, reach out to them, share with them the video, say, hey, you should

[07:23] be putting these into your games. Here's the other thing you should do. This is why I like distributors

[07:27] will never probably say this. Maybe you should stop buying these games until this technology and

[07:34] until this approach is implemented into the new games. Because think about it like this. If people

[07:40] just stopped buying these old outdated methods of making Pimball machines, the manufacturers would

[07:47] update and give consumers the things that they're asking for. And it's why I always get annoyed when

[07:54] I read on Pinside like, oh, people are just so negative here. They're just never happy. It's just more

[08:00] of the Canadian vitriol. They're spewing here. And the moderators should do their jobs and stop these

[08:06] people from complaining about things. And I to those people, you're the problem. You're the

[08:12] apathetic person who just accepts whatever is put in front of you from these companies. You're buying

[08:18] games that are inferior, that have known quality control issues. And we're going to talk after this

[08:25] about the quality control issues on stranger things and how the dam apologists and keep making excuses

[08:34] for what comes out of these boxes for $9,000. We're going to talk about that. But this

[08:39] this should be a great, glorious thing like we've been shown. We've been shown a new way

[08:46] so that we can get games that don't fall apart. Ever. Ever. Your play field will never fall apart.

[08:53] What a glorious thing. Now, here's my suggestion for these friends over at Haggis. And I'm inviting

[08:59] them on the show, trying to get that synced up. But here's my suggestion for this company. And I'm

[09:03] just going to say it from a marketing standpoint. First and foremost, I hope they've patented this

[09:08] approach and this method. I don't know if you can or not. But if I were them, I would pat in this

[09:14] yesterday five weeks ago. I would not allow that this approach and this method for someone else

[09:22] to just steal it from you. Okay. That number one, protect your business innovation that you created.

[09:28] Number two, I think Haggis Pimball should stop making Pimball machines and go into play field

[09:35] manufacturing and take down Mirko and become the go to company to supply play fields for these

[09:43] companies. Because for a few reasons, the Celts game, let's be honest, who's buying that? You're not

[09:50] buying it. It's just, it's just they can't compete on the Pimball level. They can't right now. They

[09:56] can't. And I get it's their first game. But that's okay. They might make their games better. They,

[10:01] you know, they want to do that fine. But the real, the real value of them right now is this,

[10:06] is this method of making play fields. And I would, I would change course and I would become a Pimball

[10:12] play field manufacturer. Maybe they can make older play fields in this new method. Imagine that.

[10:18] We'll sell you an indestructible pie to the Caribbean ship is your game. We'll repopulate it with

[10:24] this method. You know, I don't know. That seems like a lot of work. I don't think you'd want to do

[10:28] that. I think moving forward, they should make play fields. Okay. And here's the other thing, guys.

[10:34] What do we always hear from Stern Pimball? Oh, we're so busy. We're so busy. We have so many orders

[10:38] that we can allow the cure coat. Sorry, the cure coat. We can allow the clear coat to cure. Because of

[10:45] all the orders we're get, we're rushing it. We've heard that, right? Three coats of clear. They

[10:50] rush the process now because of all the orders. Well, imagine doing this method. You don't have to

[10:56] wait for the damn clear coat to cure. Imagine that. If you do this method, it completely seems

[11:03] more efficient and you don't have to wait and you don't have to have all those issues with the

[11:07] harmful chemicals. Like, who cares now that it went from to a water-based solvent in all of these

[11:14] long, hard to understand explanations as to why the modern play fields are crappy. You don't

[11:21] have to remove artwork from around the post. You don't have to do all these things. You can

[11:26] actually make a game indestructible. So that is what I think we should ask for in Pimball moving

[11:32] forward. Is it too much to ask? Let's talk about quality. Let's talk about one of the issues that

[11:39] we talk about a lot on this show. And for some reason, I think Pimball is falling into a few cams.

[11:46] I think the Pimball community gets divided on this. And I want to say, to me, this is like,

[11:54] it's like gun control. It's like, it's like a topic where there should be no division. And there

[12:00] shouldn't be bickering about it. There shouldn't be fighting about it. I think we all should be on the

[12:04] same page. It's like human rights. It's like freedom of speech. You should not have to open up a

[12:12] $9,000 Pimball machine and start taking it apart. I mean, if we can just all agree on that,

[12:20] it's not me being negative. It's not me trying to like, oh, create a cancerous movement within

[12:26] Pinside. No, you spent $9,000 on a stranger things, Ellie. And you should not have to use a rubber

[12:34] band to reposition the demo gorgon toy because until because it's sitting too far back. And people

[12:42] are playing 10 cent rubber bands to move it forward. You shouldn't have to do that. You shouldn't

[12:51] have to start playing your brand new game and where they sold you on the telekinesis magnetic ball

[12:58] lock feature. It's one of the only reasons why you would get an Ellie over the pro. You shouldn't

[13:03] have to play your game. Have your friends come over. Have your kids jump on it. The first time

[13:10] you're playing your brand new game for $9,100. And the telekinesis ball lock doesn't work.

[13:19] And then so you have to take your game apart. You have to release the mechanism, loosen it up,

[13:27] use your finger to move this diverter. Try to figure out how to say no. That is not what people

[13:35] should have to do out of the box. There's no excuses for this. And I read people trying to say like

[13:43] it's just pinball. It's not pinball. It's design flaws at stern pinball. It's lack of quality

[13:53] control testing before they are shipping these games to you. Stern has been making stranger things

[14:00] for a long time. Why is it that they didn't realize these two things before mailing games to

[14:09] customers? And it's not like just one game here and there. That's a dirt there is always going to

[14:16] be within any new product launch. You know a small percentage of games that might have some issues.

[14:22] This is not that. Everybody's ball lock rod was flying out of their stranger things pro. When are

[14:29] we going to start actually blaming Stern and not placing the blame on the victims of people

[14:37] who buy these games that aren't being built properly. And it's amazing to me. And it's the reason

[14:45] why this podcast is number one. Because people don't want to hear me say that. The apologists,

[14:52] the stern army. And I get it. Some of you might be really handy with a screwdriver and love this

[14:58] stuff. You might love popping the hood on your pinball machine and tinkering with it and finding

[15:04] a solution. I added more washers to the demi-gorgon and there's a gap on the ramp and I did this to

[15:10] chain. I don't want to have to rebuild a god damn game I bought for $9,100. I don't. This isn't like a

[15:19] plug fell out of a connector. I understand if something jostled loose during shipping. This is not

[15:27] that. These are games that weren't tested properly. You are now the guinea pig. You now have to

[15:33] pop the hood on your game on day one. Your family's on the machine and it's not working right.

[15:39] And we make excuses and we buy the next game and we buy the next game. They can't sell you play

[15:45] fields that don't crater and chip and you buy the next game. They sell you games with incomplete

[15:51] code. You have to wait for two years for it to finally be finished. You buy the next game.

[15:56] What's what what are we missing here? This is not acceptable. This is not me being a negative

[16:04] Nancy. It's not the sky is falling. It's just garbage. It's garbage that new inbox games have

[16:11] these many issues. It's garbage. You shouldn't have to do this. You shouldn't have to do this.

[16:17] Now look, it's the power is all in your court. You can listen to the distributors being like,

[16:26] isn't this community great? How we all came together and fixed Stern's problems? That's what they're

[16:31] saying. That's what the distributors are saying. And you know who I'm talking about. This great

[16:36] community we came together and figured out how to solve Stern's problems. They can say that.

[16:41] I'm going to say this. It's freaking embarrassing that Stern Pimball sells you a $9,100

[16:47] game with those issues out of the box. You shouldn't have to fix that. Unacceptable. It's embarrassing

[16:55] that a company with a number of employees Stern Pimball has. All these innovators. All this room.

[17:02] Tens of thousands of square feet. Multi-millions of dollars of capital every year. It's embarrassing

[17:08] that Jersey Jack with billionaire investor. Those two big companies. They have all those resources

[17:15] and three dudes in Australia. Innovated something that they couldn't. Where is the innovation? How are

[17:22] we not embarrassed that these companies continue to sell you, outdated and inferior tech that they

[17:30] should be approaching differently? I mean Gary Stern said it himself. Our new buyer is the home buyer,

[17:37] which means we have to approach how we make these games differently. And they've done, look,

[17:41] Stern has done a lot of great advancements in that territory. They have. They have done a lot

[17:50] to make the games more friendly for the home user. But this game, stranger things. We look at it

[17:57] specifically. It feels rushed. It feels rushed out the door. It feels incomplete. And it feels like

[18:05] they really just had to get the game on the line. That they really didn't make sure that everything

[18:10] was working properly before they took your money. And that, I don't care. It's Stern who does that?

[18:18] I don't care if it's Chicago gaming. I don't care if it's spooky. It doesn't matter. Anyone who does

[18:23] that to you, the customer, that company is wrong. So as much as the distributor cheerleading that

[18:30] wants to just praise the community, let's, we figured it out. Chris, we went to home deep home. We

[18:35] got a new set of washers and we put those washers in the game. And now it works well. A guy has a

[18:41] damn rubber band, a rubber band on his demaglorgan trying to make the shot work in bearish sing.

[18:54] Okay. What else is going on? Pimball. How do you like this Pimball podcast? You know, I love

[19:00] doing Canada's Pimball podcast because this stuff, you know, people asked me, I was traveling with

[19:04] co-workers like, how do you do 400 and like 50 episodes of Pimball? And this is how we do it. We

[19:11] just talk about what's going on in Pimball. All right. All right. Are we entertaining you?

[19:15] All right. I hope so. So let's talk about spooky Pimball going on that weird adult swim show,

[19:22] the morning BS show. Okay. So I watched some of the stream. Now I told you this. I didn't really

[19:29] want to watch a lot of Rick and Morty because I don't want to spoil the fun of the show and I don't

[19:35] want to hear all the jokes before I get my machine. Now I'm hearing more jokes like Rick said,

[19:41] he's like, oh yeah, lock his lip like me. And I'm like, oh, that's funny. But you know, it's like so.

[19:46] But every time I see the stream, I get more and more excited. I think a lot of people feel the

[19:52] same way. The adult swim show was really weird. I knew it right away when they walked out there.

[19:58] It's like this quirky woman who's the host of the show and there was like Boeing. I think it was

[20:03] bug and Chuck. And I was like, oh my god. Here we go. We've got like Gen Z sort of weird ass programming

[20:12] meets sort of the old cramudge in stereotypical pinball company people except for bugs young. But

[20:20] still like bug, you know, it seemed a little nervous. Like it was I could just tell right away. And then

[20:24] I knew that the audience of that show because there was a chat going, you're going to have this

[20:29] collision of their normal fan base with the pinball crowd. And this to me, what I loved about this

[20:37] whole thing is this. I think this is a lesson to so many people out there that they need to

[20:44] understand how niche pinball is that the majority of people out there look at pinball people like

[20:53] where losers and where nerds. And if they heard how much these games were, they would also think

[21:00] we're morons. Okay. So this whole notion of we need to expand pinball that we need to get more

[21:06] people. It's not happening. Okay. Pinball will grow slowly, but it will always be such a tremendously

[21:13] niche hobby. And there's nothing more awkward than combining like Gen Z kids who are into this with

[21:22] like the pinball crowd. I mean, go to a pinball show. And imagine those people at something where

[21:31] 18 to 22 year olds are hanging out doing something or 15 to 22 year olds. Imagine combining

[21:37] two conventions. And it's just like it wouldn't work. There isn't the desire to coexist together.

[21:46] So it's just funny to see that. And if I have to give any advice, I mean, you know,

[21:52] we're pinball guys walking in there. I think Bowen had like the collared shirt like tucked into

[21:57] the jeans with the belt. I mean, to me, that's just that's just the look that says pinball guy.

[22:05] You tuck a shirt into jeans with the belt. I think it reminds me of the guy on the dialed in guy

[22:13] holding up the phone. But look, it's it's good exposure for the game. But again, the game is sold out.

[22:20] They don't need more exposure. Nobody who watches that adult swim shows going to go wake up and

[22:25] buy a pinball machine. You can't even buy this one. And so I just think there's this weird

[22:31] desire to always like expand this hobby. And the other part I see that lately is just streaming

[22:37] pinball in general. And I say that because, you know, I've been watching all the streamers joining

[22:42] up together and all these things. Do you ever go on a pinball stream? Do you ever go on one and

[22:48] look how many people are actually watching a pinball stream while you're watching it?

[22:55] I mean, sometimes it's like five people, 30 people, 100 people, very rarely unless it's a new

[23:02] game stream, unless it's a new release. Other than new game releases, pinball streams are only

[23:09] being watched by like 50 people at a time at most, hardly ever, like maybe 100, 200. I know Jack

[23:16] Danger gets a much larger audience at times because he's built up a big audience. Yeah, I will say

[23:21] this. I do find it funny that what you're you're aggregating the best pinball content in the world

[23:27] is all aggregating itself together. You'll leave out the number one streamer and the number one

[23:32] podcaster, but it is it is what it is. But you know what I'm saying? It's just like watching pinball

[23:36] to me is boring as f it is the most boring thing you could spend what little time we have on planet

[23:45] earth doing the only reason people watch any of these streams. It's not for the games really.

[23:51] It's for the personalities. You know, Jack Danger's he's got a magnetic personality. I look,

[23:57] I did a little stream. I'm going to do more streaming. I'm going to do more Facebook live streaming.

[24:02] You know what I'll do a Twitch channel. I'll do a Canadian pinball podcast, Twitch channel. And for

[24:06] those of you who are friends of mine on Facebook on the Canadian pinball podcast page, you saw my

[24:12] stream last week. I went live. I played a little piano. I played a little guns and roses estranged.

[24:19] But I don't even have a pinball machine. But here's the funny part. It's like streaming is it's fun

[24:25] for the streamer. I get why people do it. But I just don't think it's expanding this hobby at all.

[24:30] I think it's this weird notion. Like like people wake up and want to watch pinball content. Like like

[24:35] the no, they don't. And it's not hard to find the pinball content and putting it all in one place.

[24:40] It's just there's just a finite amount of people that think this stuff is interesting.

[24:45] All right. So the spooky stream happened. Still no games have gone out. Still no games are out there

[24:51] in the wild. And so it is it is February now. Where are they? I thought for sure when I was number 50,

[24:59] I'd have it by Valentine's Day. So I think this was the final obligation for them was to do this

[25:08] at adult swim. I also think they want to get the code as far along as they can before they ship

[25:13] the games. But here's what I think is happening. They're not stopping their manufacturing of these

[25:19] games. So the moment the moment in which they say go I think 40 to 50 games. I think 40 games

[25:27] are going to leave spooky pinball on day one of shipment. And it's going to be this glorious day.

[25:34] And then from there, I think it's just going to be a steady drumbeat of games going out. So I think

[25:40] everyone looks forward to it. This game is not perfect. This game is it's not the second coming

[25:47] of pinball. But it has something that I think a lot of people are recognizing. It has a lot of

[25:53] personality. And a pinball machine ultimately is just supposed to be really fun and and do something

[26:00] that moves us and and have a lot of personality. And if you ask me again, the big reason why

[26:07] I think there's enthusiasm for for Rick and Morty and there's a lack of love for stranger things

[26:14] right now. The most important element I think is missing from stranger things. I just don't think

[26:20] it has the personality. I just don't. I get that it has clips from the show. I'm not inspired by the

[26:27] layout. I'm not super inspired by the layout of Rick and Morty either. I mean, I would argue that

[26:33] there's nothing radically amazing about the Rick and Morty layout. I don't even see people going

[26:39] into the garage. I don't I you know that loop with the upper flipper seems really hard. There's

[26:43] nothing about the layout of Rick and Morty that has me doing back flips. But the personality of it.

[26:49] It's just I don't think I've seen a pin that's been streamed. That was actually fun to watch. It's

[26:54] fun to watch the stream of Rick and Morty where stranger things just doesn't have personality.

[27:01] It just feels dull. It just does. The callouts are dull. The way the whole game comes at you. It's

[27:09] just it's fun to flip because it's a fan layout and the shots are rewarding to hit. They are.

[27:16] But they're just lacks personality. And so here's the here's the thing. Why was medieval man

[27:21] is so great. The toys yes all that stuff attack from Mars. Those two games medieval man is an

[27:27] attack from Mars are two of the greatest pinball machines in terms of the personality of those

[27:34] games. Those games have so much sense of humor. They just really pull you in. And I just think if

[27:42] you put those two games next to stranger things stranger things just feels like a dud on the

[27:48] personality scale compared to those other games. And that's why I think Rick and Morty has people

[27:53] so excited. Okay. And look you could disagree with me. That's fine. We don't all have to agree on

[27:59] everything. But I just think that stranger things to me is the callouts. What is why is it hard to

[28:06] get good callouts and pinball machines. Alright. What else is going on in pinball? American pinball.

[28:12] So here's the thing. Here's the thing. American pinball is going to possibly bring two games

[28:17] not one game to T.P.F. They have two games that are now pretty much complete pretty interesting.

[28:26] So that's that's hot wheels and something else. What the other thing is is a mystery to me.

[28:32] If you know email me at canada pinball at gmail.com and I'll happily spoil their second title along

[28:38] with the first one. Alright. Alright. What else is going on? Dutch pinball. Dutch pinball. Brenna. Hey

[28:43] Brenna. Brenna just walked in. Say hi to the listeners Brenna. They love a little

[28:48] little Brenda on the show. Brenna Camille. Okay. She's look like. Brenna, I'm just going to ask

[28:54] your question. Do you come here? Do you think the early achievers at Dutch pinball are going to

[29:01] get their games who already paid for their games years ago? Is the game made? Is it ready to go?

[29:07] Well, they showed an apron of the metal apron of the early achievers. But I don't know. That's

[29:13] about it. So there's no game. Now there's a game. But no one's seen the game. We've seen the game.

[29:19] Is it ready to ship? That we don't know. Alright. I'll let you go to the gym. She's looking at me like

[29:24] I don't she doesn't okay. Alright. We're not editing that out. We don't edit the show.

[29:28] Alright. So here's the deal. They showed an image of playfields being made. They showed an

[29:32] image of the metal apron that's that achiever early achiever edition. So those are only available

[29:39] to people who already bought the game. And those are also only going to people who buy their game

[29:45] again. So every single early achiever that they went to had a pay 12.5 on top of the eight.

[29:53] So they're basically in $21,000 on a game. So here's the thing. I hope these people eventually

[30:00] get that free one. I think Barry has figured out some sort of manufacturing. I just don't know

[30:07] what to think. I just don't think they're going to make hundreds of them. I think the excitement

[30:12] and hype around the big Lebowski is declining week after week. It's not you know now that it's back.

[30:19] It's it's back. Where's the is code going to be updated? Is code going to like you know give this

[30:25] game a new reason to for people to want it? I don't know. It's still an amazing game. It really is.

[30:32] It's just I just think it just leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. And I hope those people

[30:39] are made whole. You know look on this show I will call manufacturers out. But you know I hope

[30:44] Dutch figure is this out. I just I'm still very skeptical that they're going to be able to do it

[30:50] and that the demand for this game is going to continue to be there like a year or two from now.

[30:55] I just that's how I feel. All right. What else is going on? So this is the weird item of the days.

[31:01] So someone listed a Jersey Jack Pimball Pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition for sale

[31:07] for $20,500. Now that's crazy amount of money. But that's not the crazy part. The crazy part

[31:17] is that this is Pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition ready for it? Number 203. Now how is it

[31:26] number 203 when Jersey Jack Pimball was only supposed to make 200 Pirates of the Caribbean games?

[31:35] So I'll let that sink in for a little bit. Only supposed to be 200. This is game number 203. The only

[31:41] thing I can guess happened is that maybe three or four games got damaged in shipping and had to be

[31:48] remade. But I don't think so because these things were made on the assembly line next to each other

[31:55] because this guy had two of them and one was like number 32 and then the other was number 203.

[32:01] So I'm not sure if he was able to ask for that specific number. But at once again,

[32:08] always makes me scratch my head of what are they doing over at Jersey Jack Pimball when it comes to

[32:14] numbering these damn games. You know, first you can't set a limit on the number of yellow brick roads.

[32:20] Then you tell people there's going to be 5,000 Willy Wonka limited editions. It's always so

[32:24] wonky. You know, remember when Jack was like, we're only going to make the number of dialed in

[32:28] collectors edition orders we get by midnight on January 1st by midnight. All right. And then what

[32:35] happens? We're making 250. It was like some stupidly exact number. You got that many exactly,

[32:43] Jack. Anyway, but here's the thing. Here's my advice for Jersey Jack Pimball. Please, Jack, please

[32:50] call me. Call me. Let me help you set your guns and roses marketing strategy. Please don't

[33:00] do something stupid. Don't, don't release too many collectors editions. Don't release too many

[33:09] limited editions. Check. 5,000 Willy Wonka limited edition games is the dumbest thing you could do.

[33:17] 5,000 ain't limited, Jack. 5,000 would make it one of the best selling Pimball machines of all time.

[33:23] You're not going to make 5,000 Willy Wonka LEDs ever. You always want to make one less than there

[33:33] is demand for. That's the rule of marketing. These guys, they don't get it. They don't get it.

[33:40] 5,000. Why would you say that? Why? Why would you say 500 collectors editions? Why? You're not

[33:48] going to sell off 500 CE's. Where's Iceman CE? Keeps waiting for it. Someone get Iceman is

[33:55] damn collector's edition of Willy Wonka. I think he's also waiting on a collector's edition of

[34:01] pirates. I don't know what's going on with ice. I don't know what's going on with his games.

[34:05] Somebody get this man his games. Iceman, I got to say. You've got to stop.

[34:12] Like saying everything Stern does is amazing. Come on man. I'll tell you this. This is amazing.

[34:17] Keith L. Win. Keith L. Win has updated the code to Jurassic Park. I love what he's done.

[34:23] He's added an ability to start the final wizard mode right when you start the game. Any player

[34:30] regardless of skill set can enjoy one of the coolest modes in his game without having to go

[34:38] through the whole game. I love that Keith did this. I've been saying this on the show for years.

[34:46] If you have really fun elements in your game that people would enjoy. You've got to find a way to

[34:52] let beginners and casuals enjoy some of that magic. I've said this with Willy Wonka. It's so silly.

[34:59] You've got these amazing modes that they put in this game that nobody will ever see. Great job.

[35:04] Jack. Come on. Wake up. Jack. Look. Learn from Keith. I love it. And I love how like some of like

[35:11] the you know the hardcore players are like well this is this. I don't like this. I don't like this.

[35:17] I have to play right. And you know and this this is what I I own the game for is to make it through

[35:23] to one day experience it. And I don't like that there's a shortcut. Well you don't have to take the

[35:28] shortcut yet. Jack asses. You can still play your game and get through all the modes to get to

[35:34] that final wizard mode. Or you could start the game there. Oh my god. Let me cry that we have

[35:40] options. Let me cry that we have choices. Get out of here. I'm going right there right from the

[35:45] beginning. I don't care. I'd rather just get off the dam island and escape the dinosaurs than

[35:50] then go through your dam modes. Sonnet boys. What else? What else am I missing anything? Anything big

[35:56] going on in the pinball world. There's new code for games like Elvira. I don't really care about

[36:01] new code updates other than the fact that owners will be happy. I covered that covered that.

[36:08] I think I've covered it all. Such a good show. Can it is pinball podcasts? It really is great.

[36:13] You really are lucky. All of you out there. All two to three thousand people who get to you know

[36:20] see that there's a new canadus pinball podcast updated again. What do I mean? What do I get for this?

[36:26] What am I doing this for guys? Well look you can donate to my Patreon. You can. I want to thank

[36:33] all of you who donate to canadus pinball podcasts on Patreon. If I was on Twitch I see you guys

[36:38] throwing money at these Twitch streams and I'm like what? I mean I do way more episodes. I

[36:44] also want to thank someone who asked me. I want to thank this guy straight out. He asked me for

[36:50] my PayPal so he could send me money via PayPal because he doesn't want to use Patreon and I

[36:56] appreciate that and so hold on a second. Hold on. I want to call him out by name. I got a PayPal

[37:03] donation from Devon Maldien. Devon thank you so much for donating to canadus pinball podcasts. You

[37:12] get a special shout out on the show. I think someone else also did. Let me look real quick. Hold on

[37:19] a second. Alright I also want to give a shout out to my man. My main man, Garrison Tarno who also

[37:27] donated to canadus pinball podcast. Garrison thank you so much. You know I'm really going to get some

[37:33] merchandise and swag going for you guys as well because I know some of you just want to wear merchandise.

[37:43] do limited edition collectors edition t-shirts. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. Anyway

[37:47] guys have a great weekend. Enjoy your pinball machines and don't forget don't forget we should be

[37:54] hitting these manufacturers hard over the next few weeks that we want indestructible playfield

[38:01] technology implemented into games moving forward. We need to put a stake in the ground. Stop

[38:09] buying your games. Stop just running at every new release. Make sure this gets implemented into

[38:16] pinball and I mean across the board. I want to see spooky do it. CGC do it. This is what we want.

[38:21] I don't want my game to fall apart. If I can have a game that would look perfect forever.

[38:26] So be it and we all can have a great weekend guys. We'll talk to you soon.
