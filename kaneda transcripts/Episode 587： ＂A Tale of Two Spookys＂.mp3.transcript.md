[00:00] If you'll get jealous, this will always stay together.

[00:04] Yeah baby, I guess I really wanna love that you remind me.

[00:12] Together forever.

[00:18] Welcome to episode 587 of the world's favorite pinball podcast.

[00:23] Now not everybody's favorite pinball podcast, but you know what?

[00:27] You can't win over everybody.

[00:29] So on this episode, I'm gonna talk to you about spooky pinball.

[00:33] And I think I finally figured out what is happening over at spooky pinball.

[00:37] And I know I've been back and forth on this, but you have to remember, when you're trying

[00:41] to get information from companies, they do not want you to have.

[00:46] It's not that easy.

[00:47] It's not like I can just hit a bent heck or knock on the door over in Benton, Wisconsin.

[00:52] And remember this everybody, is there any other pinball podcast on planet Earth right now

[00:57] that is actually doing this work and trying to give you what we believe are the next titles

[01:05] from these companies so you can be well informed on whether or not you wanna buy the current

[01:11] stuff or wait for the games that are coming down the road.

[01:14] That's what we're trying to do here.

[01:16] And here's the thing, it's fun to try to find out what is happening over at these pinball

[01:22] companies.

[01:23] You'll never understand why other people try to protect this information because they're

[01:28] just pinball machines.

[01:30] And these are just pinball companies.

[01:33] And ultimately, you know what cars are coming out next, you know what video games are coming

[01:37] out next, you know what movies are coming out next, you know what Rolex watches are coming

[01:41] out next.

[01:42] But when it comes to pinball, we have to allow these companies to be super secret so they

[01:47] can create the ultimate window of FOMO.

[01:51] So they can force you to spend money that you don't need to spend on pinball machines

[01:55] because you and I both know deep down inside.

[01:58] This stuff is not gonna change your life or make you a more interesting person, it's

[02:02] just gonna provide you hours of fun.

[02:05] And so it should and it's a toy.

[02:07] So who cares if we spoil a toy that's coming out in the near future for very wealthy men?

[02:13] Oh my god, the tragedy of that.

[02:16] I also wanna speculate on what I think John Borg's next game is because John Borg is

[02:21] after Keith L. and that's gonna be the one to punch at the end of this year.

[02:26] John Borg, Keith L. and it's gonna be the reverse order Keith L. and then John Borg.

[02:31] There's a new pinball machine from pinball adventures coming out.

[02:35] Okay, deep root pinball's refunds happened on June 1st.

[02:38] Did anyone take their razor refund?

[02:40] I don't know at this point, why bother?

[02:43] We're gonna talk a little bit about that.

[02:44] We're still waiting for cactus canyon remake, no news there.

[02:48] But before we get started, I wanna thank a listener of this show and his name is Cliff Albert

[02:53] and Cliff is a really cool guy.

[02:55] And Cliff came to me and he said, Chris, you know what?

[02:57] Your show's just been a little negative lately and I don't wanna listen to your show if

[03:03] it's too negative because I just want to enjoy pinball.

[03:06] And you know, I really respect when people give me feedback like that because I said,

[03:10] you know what Cliff, you're right.

[03:12] I've been a little down and out.

[03:14] Lots of things have been going on that none of you are fully aware of.

[03:18] Some of the stuff you're aware of, like losing my best friend in Bubba, like COVID and being

[03:22] locked up inside of one bedroom apartment for over a year, not going into work, not talking

[03:28] to coworkers, not having happy hours, having killing and popping to the world.

[03:32] And for all of you parents out there, you know how tiring that is to be a new parent.

[03:37] So you put all this together.

[03:38] And then also, you know, just the average daily sort of people that always come out

[03:42] to Canada for being Canada.

[03:44] I get that every freaking day and you add it all together.

[03:48] You add it all together and then I've never had a vacation in almost two years.

[03:52] And then we're trying to find a house and the real estate market is ridiculous.

[03:56] If you live in the Northeast, the real estate market is like 30% higher than it was a year

[04:00] ago.

[04:01] And as a family like ours, where we worked really hard and we've been responsible and

[04:05] you look at the world and you look at how expensive everything is.

[04:10] And then you look at like, oh, if I just put $10,000 in AMC stock a year ago, you see

[04:15] this a year ago, $10,000 in AMC stock is now worth $289,000.

[04:22] It's just like at some point all this stuff just collides on you and you get stressed out,

[04:28] you get anxious, you get frustrated.

[04:31] And you know what, I want to tell you right now, I'm turning a page.

[04:34] I do this because I enjoy this.

[04:36] This is probably my most enjoyable creative outlet and I tell this to people all the time.

[04:41] The reason why I do this show is because I can create it.

[04:45] I'm allowed to say whatever I want on Canadian Spinball podcast, I don't have to ask permission.

[04:51] Everything else I do in life, I mean this like almost everything else I do in life either

[04:55] requires money or I have to ask permission or I have to use time that I'd rather be using

[05:01] for something else.

[05:02] But when I do Canadian Spinball podcast, I mean this.

[05:05] The time I spend doing this is time I really enjoy.

[05:08] The time I spend doing my Facebook lives is time I really enjoy doing it.

[05:13] And that's the other part about my Facebook lives is some of you don't understand as I do

[05:17] some of those in between meetings in which I'm working all day long on stuff that's not

[05:22] pinball.

[05:23] And even though you might think I'm thinking about pinball all day long during all those

[05:28] hours, I'm not.

[05:29] I have other really important responsibilities going on and so many things that I'm accountable

[05:34] for that you just don't know about.

[05:36] And I talk to you about some of it and some of my marketing career and this and that.

[05:40] And I'm a very transparent person.

[05:42] I've always been very transparent.

[05:44] You know who I am.

[05:46] You probably know where I work.

[05:47] You know the brands I work on.

[05:48] You know some of the things I've done.

[05:50] You know where I live.

[05:52] You know so much about me and I don't hide any of it because I think if you listen to

[05:57] this show, the biggest appeal of Canadian Spinball podcast is that transparency.

[06:02] And we're always going to be that way.

[06:04] And that's the way I want it.

[06:05] Now the other part is this.

[06:07] I run what I think is one of the most active and engaging and fun Facebook live pages.

[06:13] But here's the thing everybody.

[06:15] It's my page.

[06:16] I can do what I want with it.

[06:17] I'm not going to let someone run up in my house and complain and whine constantly on

[06:23] my Facebook live page.

[06:25] No, no, we're there to have fun and we have fun on our Facebook lives.

[06:29] And you know when it's not fun is when people run into someone's house party and start

[06:33] insulting the guest of the party.

[06:36] And I think we have the best Facebook fan page going and I think it's very engaging.

[06:41] And I think there's a reason why there's a lot of engagement with all the different content.

[06:45] And it's going to stay that way.

[06:47] And anyone who wants to jump in there and try to troll the good time we're all having,

[06:51] they're just going to get banned and guess what?

[06:53] We're not going to miss them because we're going to keep doing what we do.

[06:56] And this is why this is why this is the favorite pinball podcast.

[06:59] This is why for a lot of you, it's some of your favorite Facebook live content when it

[07:03] comes to pinball because here's the funny part about it all.

[07:06] We're talking pinball.

[07:07] We're not even playing pinball.

[07:08] We're just talking about the hobby and there's a lot of fun in that and it doesn't cost

[07:12] you anything.

[07:13] And the last point I want to make is for all those who contribute to the page and support

[07:17] canate his pinball podcast on Patreon and PayPal, thank you very much.

[07:21] I'm seeing people insult people for contributing and donating to this.

[07:27] Nobody who makes content should be insulting other people who make content that people

[07:32] are contributing to because they want to say, I like what you do, I support what you do,

[07:38] and I know how much time and effort it takes to do it.

[07:41] So speaking of time and effort, let's get right to it.

[07:43] So here's the main thing.

[07:45] Here's the main thing on this podcast.

[07:47] This podcast is called a tale of two spookies for a reason.

[07:51] And the reason why I'm saying that is I've been digging up what is the next spooky pinball

[07:56] title and I got the first one wrong.

[07:59] I'm going to admit it.

[08:00] I always admit when I'm wrong.

[08:01] Don't I?

[08:02] That's part of being canada.

[08:03] Halloween I'm hearing is not it.

[08:05] It is not Scooby Doo.

[08:07] Here's what I'm here to tell you right now on canada's pinball podcast.

[08:10] That spooky pinball has two titles that are designed and ready to go.

[08:15] Not just one.

[08:16] So you can imagine when you have two titles ready to go and not one, how that could create

[08:23] a ton of confusion for a dude like me who's trying to tell you what the next title is.

[08:30] I could be hearing two different things and I could be saying to myself what has to be

[08:35] one of them because no pinball company that I've known recently has ever released two titles

[08:41] or had two titles ready to go back to back.

[08:44] But as we've seen over in Benton, Wisconsin, spooky pinball is expanding its operation.

[08:50] Now they're expanding their operation to have two lines to make two games simultaneously

[08:57] is what I'm hearing.

[08:58] Did I say that weird simultaneously?

[09:00] Now I don't know if they're both going to go on the line at the exact same time but I'm

[09:04] here to tell you right now that spooky pinball within the next few months is going to have

[09:09] more than just one title ready to go.

[09:12] Now here are the two titles that I am hearing are going to be the spooky pinball title.

[09:18] And believe me, I don't have confirmation.

[09:21] I haven't seen either of these titles.

[09:24] So let's call these rumors.

[09:26] Canada is predicting.

[09:27] Okay, we'll call it a prediction.

[09:29] How about that?

[09:30] My prediction could be right.

[09:31] It could be wrong.

[09:32] Here are the two titles.

[09:33] Number one is Nightmare on Elm Street.

[09:36] And the artist, which I think might be doing both of these games because this guy's art

[09:40] is insane and he did the art for Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle.

[09:43] His name is Jeff Zarno.

[09:45] Now Zorno, Z-O-R-N-O-W.

[09:48] Now if you google this guy and you see his artwork on Godzilla, it is some of the best

[09:53] artwork I've seen.

[09:54] It would be the best artwork on any pinball machine ever if Jeff did the kind of Godzilla

[09:59] artwork that he has done in the comic world.

[10:02] And this is why spooky is probably so upset that Stern stole Godzilla from them because

[10:06] they would have made that and they should have made that.

[10:09] If you look at Jeff's work, he's got an incredible Nightmare on Elm Street work of art that

[10:15] is up on my Facebook page.

[10:17] So that I'm hearing his title number one will be Nightmare on Elm Street.

[10:20] Now what's the second title?

[10:22] Well here we go.

[10:23] You ready for it?

[10:24] A lot of you people are going to be really happy when I heard this.

[10:27] Now again this is just a rumor so if this doesn't come true, don't be mad at me.

[10:31] I didn't make the decision not to make this.

[10:33] The second title that I'm hearing will be part of spooky pinball's duo of titles is Army

[10:40] of Darkness.

[10:42] Now I have to admit I've never seen Army of Darkness.

[10:44] I just started watching Evil Dead with Brenda and she got scared within like 25 minutes

[10:50] so we turned it off.

[10:51] Somehow you go into the woods and the woods sexually assaults you was too much for the

[10:56] wife.

[10:57] So Army of Darkness and this ash character.

[11:00] Now I need to watch these movies.

[11:02] I just for some reason I just never saw these movies growing up but when I see people talk

[11:07] about Army of Darkness, they go bonkers for it.

[11:10] So that is one I'm hearing could possibly be coming from spooky pinball.

[11:15] Let me earn Elm Street with Freddy Krueger and all of his hilarity.

[11:19] And ash and Army of Darkness which apparently I hear is like one of the campiest, funniest

[11:24] and like amazing like spoof on like horror movie genre and which would be perfect for pinball.

[11:30] So how do you like them apples?

[11:31] That spooky pinball could have two titles ready to go and if what I'm hearing also makes

[11:35] sense, line one would be 750 or a thousand and line two would be 750 games.

[11:41] So I'm hearing they're making a total of 1,750 games.

[11:46] So possibly what if they're splitting it up like one title we're going to make a thousand

[11:51] of and one title we're going to make 750 of.

[11:54] Now if you were going to do that split between these two themes, I would have to imagine

[12:00] that Nightmare on Elm Street would be the one you'd make more of but there was already

[12:04] a Nightmare on Elm Street game so maybe Army of Darkness is the one that's brand new

[12:09] never been done before.

[12:11] So that is what I'm hearing on Gnatus Pinball podcast take it with a little bit of a grain

[12:16] of salt and when I'm wrong, I'm sure everybody in the world will let you know how I'm always

[12:22] wrong and I always contradict myself and he's a narcissistic bipolar maniac.

[12:27] How does he survive a single day in his own skin?

[12:30] Alright, let's move on to Stern Pinball.

[12:33] So John Borg is following Keith Elwin.

[12:37] Now I keep going back and forth on Elwin's Godzilla is probably the worst kept secret

[12:42] in Pinball.

[12:43] If it's not Godzilla, I would be the most surprised person on planet Earth.

[12:47] That is coming out sometime in the end of summer early fall so we're seeing I believe

[12:53] October will most likely be when we see Godzilla.

[12:57] There is a shortage of parts.

[12:59] There's a backlog of orders.

[13:02] Stern Pinball is going to have a hard time getting all these Mandalorians out the doors

[13:06] as fast as they normally do.

[13:08] There's just so much backlog over at Stern.

[13:12] So I think this might slow down their release schedule but you don't care about that.

[13:16] What is John Borg's game?

[13:19] Now I'm hearing two titles.

[13:22] Two titles.

[13:23] It's a music theme.

[13:24] Now I said on my private show that I did earlier this week.

[13:27] For those of you who donate, you get a private show from Canada but I heard that Motley

[13:33] crew is a license that someone has.

[13:35] Now if anyone has the Motley crew license, I would assume it's Stern Pinball.

[13:39] Now that is always in the running.

[13:42] Stern is a company that locks up at least 10 titles at a time.

[13:48] Stern understands that they could lock up a license and have that license for a while before

[13:54] they ever make a game.

[13:55] And a lot of that behavior is to create a strategic advantage for them.

[13:59] So their competitors can't go get certain things because Stern Pinball has already inked

[14:03] a deal to make the game eventually.

[14:05] It's very smart.

[14:06] Now Motley crew is a band that hates Guns and Roses so I do think Motley crew has the kind

[14:12] of high energy punch that would be the perfect kind of pin to compete with a game like Guns

[14:17] and Roses.

[14:18] We will never see a game like Guns and Roses from Stern.

[14:20] We all know that.

[14:21] Stern will never put that kind of magic inside a game.

[14:24] They're just not capable of it with how much money they put into their games.

[14:27] We all know that.

[14:28] And Stern's a Stern's a Stern.

[14:29] But Stern's formula works so well.

[14:31] So here's what I'm hearing the two titles could be that John Borg and Lyman Sheets would

[14:36] be working on together.

[14:37] The titles are this.

[14:39] One of them is Rush.

[14:40] Now I'm not that excited by that.

[14:43] I don't think Rush would be a huge seller for them.

[14:45] I know people are probably screaming at me that I'm wrong.

[14:48] But come on, Rush is like underneath the caliber where some of these bands have been recently.

[14:55] But I get that some of you love Rush and that's great.

[14:57] I'm not here to argue music.

[14:59] It's the most subjective thing on the planet.

[15:01] The other one that I'm hearing, which is obviously a bigger band and whose music has

[15:07] stayed around in the cultural zeitgeist far more than Rush's music, is Journey.

[15:13] So would you like a Journey pin with John Borg and Lyman Sheets doing it?

[15:19] That seems to make more sense to me is Journey.

[15:22] Now I will say this.

[15:23] There is a point now and I think a lot of you are feeling this.

[15:27] The same way you felt like Marvel fatigue.

[15:30] That there is just enough.

[15:32] It's just enough.

[15:34] Just enough of these older bands that haven't been around for so many decades.

[15:39] Enough.

[15:40] If you had to choose between stuff like the Mandalorian and Journey, you would choose Mandalorian.

[15:45] If you had to choose between Matrix and Journey, you would choose Matrix.

[15:50] If you had to choose between Big Trouble and Little China or Journey, you probably would

[15:55] choose Big Trouble.

[15:57] It's just like at the point now where yes, you could make music pins for every single

[16:03] artist that's ever been popular and they will be somewhat successful for anyone who

[16:07] does this.

[16:08] We still know that Pinball Brothers has the Queen license, but why not make Michael Jackson?

[16:14] Why not make Madonna?

[16:15] Why not make M&M?

[16:17] At least do something in a different genre.

[16:20] I would love an Abba Pinball machine.

[16:22] Then I still would love a Phantom of the Opera, Android Weber machine because it's always

[16:26] the same classic rock category.

[16:29] I think that just goes to show the lack of diversity, not just over at Stern or with these

[16:35] Pinball companies, but also there's also this perception that there's a lack of diversity

[16:40] by those people who buy Pinball.

[16:42] But I think they're wrong because if you made a Madonna Pinball machine every single person

[16:47] out there is probably a fan of her music.

[16:49] I am, Brenda is.

[16:51] I mean, a Spice Girls Pinball machine to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

[16:55] That would sell like hotcakes.

[16:58] And I know people will be like, what are you talking about?

[17:00] Spice Girls, it's like, yes, you don't understand.

[17:02] There's other genres of music.

[17:05] It doesn't only have to be classic rock or hair metal as the only two musical genres

[17:11] Pinball can pay respect to.

[17:13] So be it as it may, we're probably never going to see musical stuff that's not hair metal

[17:19] or classic rock.

[17:20] All right, what else is going on?

[17:21] So June 1st has come and gone and Robert Mueller and the folks over at Deeproot, they did

[17:28] offer a first come first serve refund on retroatomic zombie adventure land for those people

[17:35] out there who are tired of waiting 11 years for this game.

[17:38] Now I go back and forth on this on at this point, would you take the money and run or would

[17:44] you just wait it out?

[17:45] And I think at this point, honestly, if I just had $1,500 down, I would just let it

[17:51] ride because as much as people want to deny the thing I'm about to say, we know it will

[17:56] come true.

[17:57] If they figure out a way to make these games and they make only a hundred and like 30

[18:03] razes and that's it.

[18:05] Regardless if the game is any good, regardless of anything else, these games will be worth

[18:10] way more than the $9,000 people spent on them simply because they will be an instant

[18:16] collectible for the collectible community.

[18:19] And I know people are being like, what are you talking about this and that?

[18:22] Look, on some level, people who collect pinball machines, they will chase after things

[18:27] just because they are rare.

[18:29] It doesn't mean the game is good.

[18:31] It doesn't mean the code is deep.

[18:33] It doesn't mean the artwork is the best.

[18:35] It doesn't mean the play fields don't chip simply because the game is rare.

[18:39] There will be more than 130 pinball collectors out there that will want to have this in their

[18:46] collection and we saw this with magic girl prices because this company has been somewhat

[18:52] of a disaster.

[18:53] It actually makes this stuff even more collectible because it's a conversation and the conversation

[19:00] will be around how the hell did it take John pop a Duke 11 years to come out with this

[19:06] title.

[19:07] It's so not worth it.

[19:08] That will be the conversation.

[19:10] Why the hell did they put the pinball here?

[19:12] How the hell did this company think that they were going to sell more games than stern pinball?

[19:17] All of that will be the conversation and all you have to do is go to the deep root thread

[19:23] and look how many hundreds of pages the deep root thread is to realize that like this company

[19:31] or not, they've been very successful in driving conversation.

[19:35] Now albeit the wrong kind of conversation if you want to be a financially successful pinball

[19:41] company but they've created controversy.

[19:44] They've created drama.

[19:47] They've told people stuff that didn't come true.

[19:49] They sound a lot like an eight-spinball podcast, right?

[19:52] But you see what I'm saying is this company will be something that collectors will throw

[19:57] dumb money at.

[19:59] Now Vyre you and as an owner of a magic girl that didn't really work well, I would take

[20:04] the dumb money and run and cash out on your investment because I think the likelihood

[20:09] of this machine being amazing and playing incredibly well and we know if there's any

[20:15] quality issues with a deep root pinball game.

[20:19] Do you really expect to be taken care of?

[20:21] I mean look what's happening right now over at JJP and I want to say this, I've covered

[20:26] the JJP quality issue as much as I'm going to cover it.

[20:29] I think I've been the one who's been the most prevalent, the most present and the most

[20:34] consistent with my coverage of this thing.

[20:38] I've held them accountable, even though I love guns and roses, I don't think that gives

[20:42] them a pass to not communicate to their customers.

[20:46] This has been one of the reasons why fans of the show like Cliff have said I've been really

[20:50] negative because it sucks covering these negative topics like play field quality.

[20:55] Here is what I think is going to happen, they're not going to say anything to us.

[20:59] They've had weeks to say stuff to us, but I want to ask all of you out there a favor

[21:03] because I heard from a few distributor friends.

[21:06] If you have a guns and roses and it's having issues, please do not do a credit card charge

[21:13] back and screw over your distributor.

[21:16] It is not your distributor's fault that this happened.

[21:20] Distributors work so hard and there's so much they can't control and if you charge back

[21:26] your credit card, that's not fair.

[21:29] If you want to get a refund on this game and Jersey Jack Pimball told you they will

[21:34] refund you then you have to keep them accountable for owning up to that refund.

[21:40] I think where there's a lot of misinformation and there's a lot of confusion right now

[21:45] is that Jersey Jack Pimball behind the scenes is telling some people they will refund their

[21:51] games but they have not externally, officially said that and that is why you're getting all

[21:59] this misinformation and I don't think it's right.

[22:02] I just want to put a pin on this and say Ken and Brett and everybody over there, you

[22:08] have to officially come out and say what you're going to do for customers or at least

[22:14] announce the refund thing you're doing that will buy back your CE or your Ellie if you're

[22:18] not happy with the game.

[22:20] But until it's externally official, this is where we're at.

[22:23] Everyone's just guessing what's happening and I just don't want to see distributors

[22:28] being blamed or distributors getting hurt by this because they didn't create this

[22:33] issue.

[22:34] They've worked hard all these years to line up customers for Jersey Jack and I think it

[22:38] also hurts distributors when JJP doesn't officially give the distributors their official

[22:45] stance on this whole thing.

[22:47] So I don't know what's going to happen.

[22:48] Kerry Hardy's video is pretty funny.

[22:50] I think you guys have seen it.

[22:52] If you haven't check out Kerry Hardy's Illinois Jack video on YouTube you'll get a good

[22:56] kick out of that.

[22:57] All right.

[22:58] What else is going on in the pinball world with his pinball adventures game to see this

[23:02] trailer.

[23:03] There's like five minute trailer of this new game from pinball adventures.

[23:07] I mean, it looks cool.

[23:09] There's a lot of neat stuff going on it.

[23:11] Really weird though to release the digital CAD gameplay footage of it as a way to get

[23:17] people excited.

[23:19] Not really sure I would do that.

[23:20] As a marketer, I kind of watched that video.

[23:23] The audio is not even synced up with the video.

[23:26] Everything about it looked pretty amateur hour.

[23:29] I'm not sure if that's what they were going for.

[23:32] I don't even have these guys on the radar as potential games people want.

[23:37] I don't understand why we have so many pinball companies that just can't reveal a product

[23:44] when it's ready to be bought.

[23:46] And so we'll see what comes with this.

[23:48] But you know, check it out.

[23:50] It's on YouTube and really doing.

[23:52] Do you even have more room people?

[23:54] Do you even have more room?

[23:55] Are you out of money yet?

[23:57] I've said it before and I'll say it again.

[23:59] And then I'm going to close out this show is we all know that we're in a little bit of

[24:03] a bubble right now.

[24:04] We're in a little bit of a bubble where prices are really skyrocketing where demand is

[24:09] through the roof where manufacturing is harder and harder nowadays because of supply chain

[24:15] issues.

[24:16] And there's a lot of people who have made a lot of money in other areas of life.

[24:20] And a lot of people now are bored.

[24:22] I mean, boredom is the greatest climate to create when you're selling a non-essential

[24:27] toy.

[24:28] Let me just think about it.

[24:29] If I'm a pinball company, I would love it if society became bored because they were

[24:35] stuck at home forever, especially if I'm selling a product that goes in your home and

[24:40] it's a toy.

[24:41] And so we're in a little bit of a bubble.

[24:43] And people are throwing ridiculous amounts of money at games.

[24:46] And my recommendation to everyone is always been this.

[24:49] Just wait it out, wait it out.

[24:52] I would really only jump in if you saw a game at a good price, which is nowhere to be

[24:57] found.

[24:58] I would really only jump in unless it was a dream theme that you had to have.

[25:02] And I think that's why we saw Mandalorian selling so well.

[25:05] And I think that's why we're seeing Mandalorian flip for well over $9,000.

[25:10] But there's a downside to this behavior.

[25:12] And the downside is this.

[25:15] The two factors are going to keep increasing their prices because they see where everything

[25:20] has had it.

[25:21] Distributors are going to have to start doing market adjusted prices because they're seeing

[25:25] all this as well.

[25:26] People are easily flipping man nose at $13,000, $14,000, $15,000.

[25:31] They're easily flipping guns and roses at $18,000, $20,000 for the CEs.

[25:37] These distributors are working so hard.

[25:38] They're seeing all this.

[25:40] Something's going to have to give eventually.

[25:42] There is no way it's going to go on like this forever.

[25:45] Now unfortunately what's going to happen next and then I'll end with this little bit of

[25:49] a rumor is that I hear that Stern Pimball is raising the prices on all of its titles

[25:54] by $500.

[25:56] That's coming next.

[25:57] Are we surprised?

[25:59] We are going to be at the point pretty soon where a Stern Ely is $12,500.

[26:06] It's just going to get to that point very soon.

[26:08] And it's sort of sad to me because when you think about it, we all love this hobby.

[26:12] But we loved it a lot more when Wizard of Oz fully packed from Jersey Jack Pimball with

[26:17] $6,500 and Stern machines were like $4,700.

[26:22] It's at the point now.

[26:24] It's hard to ignore the complete elevation in prices across the board.

[26:29] And you know and I know that there hasn't been that same level of elevation in mechanical

[26:35] magic in these games.

[26:36] There just hasn't.

[26:37] The artwork's gotten better.

[26:39] The code has gotten better.

[26:41] Now there's LCD screens, but there's still just not as much magical worlds under glass

[26:47] that there should be for these prices.

[26:50] And I don't mean that cliff to be negative.

[26:52] I'm talking right to cliff.

[26:53] It's just at these prices, I think we should ask for more and we should get more.

[26:58] And certain companies want to give us more and other companies don't.

[27:02] I think spooky Pimball's next titles are really exciting because I think they're going

[27:05] to jam a lot into these games.

[27:08] And I think if they can do that and make these games shoot tremendously well, I think it's

[27:14] going to be really fun to finally see a company like spooky release a super sexy Pimball machine

[27:20] that's packed.

[27:21] And I heard the art package on these new games is going to be the best art package possibly

[27:25] ever.

[27:26] And this artist go look at his stuff.

[27:27] I mean he's up there with Yeti.

[27:29] I mean this guy has some incredibly detailed artwork.

[27:33] It's going to be fun to see these games.

[27:35] Now I didn't tell you when I think we should see these spooky games sometime end of June

[27:39] early July.

[27:40] So they're coming soon.

[27:42] They're coming soon.

[27:43] All right, everybody.

[27:44] This has been episode 587 of Canada's Pimball Podcast.

[27:49] Thank you for listening and sticking with me.

[27:52] I know at times.

[27:53] I know at times it seems like supporting Canada is like supporting the villain.

[27:58] But trust me, I'm not a bad guy.

[28:01] It's just Pimball.

[28:02] I'm not here to harm anybody.

[28:04] I would never do anything to cause anybody harm.

[28:07] I'm just here to talk about the games, the companies, and these products that are so much

[28:13] fun, that are so expensive, but also can be enjoyed for pretty much nothing.

[28:20] If you just go play them at your friends' houses and on location and in tournaments,

[28:26] that it doesn't cost a lot of money to love Pimball.

[28:31] And you have to understand if I were to recommend one direction of your lives, it would be

[28:36] to find that pathway.

[28:39] And this isn't the pathway that distributors want you to hear.

[28:41] It isn't the pathway that companies want you to hear, but there is so much happiness

[28:46] waiting for you if you find out how to love Pimball without breaking the bank and you

[28:52] find out how to enjoy games without needing to own it.

[28:55] I mean, I can't go to Hertz and drive a Ferrari, but I could walk to my friends' apartment

[29:00] and go play all these rare games, and that's good enough for me, because I don't need

[29:04] to play at three in the morning and I don't need to own everything if I can enjoy it some

[29:09] other way.

[29:10] And that's it, find it, and find what works for you.

[29:13] You know, I'm trying to find what works for my life, it's not easy, I'm trying to find

[29:16] the balance in my own world, and so are you, and that's why this show is more interesting

[29:20] than just only talking about Pimball in the same way, because we want to talk about it

[29:25] as it fits into our lives, which are so much more dynamic and complex than any code Keith

[29:32] Johnson could create.

[29:34] Have a great day, everybody.

[29:35] We'll talk to you soon.
