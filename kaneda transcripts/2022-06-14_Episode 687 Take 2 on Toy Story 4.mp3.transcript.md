[00:00] I feel like we've all been holding our breath all day long watching all of this Toy Story content.

[00:05] I'm gonna give you my take two on Toy Story 4 right now.

[00:09] ["Celestia of the Year," by Jack Pinball plays.]

[00:13] ["Celestia of the Year," by Jack Pinball plays.]

[00:13] Ugh, you know I don't know about you but I just need to just exhale.

[00:17] It's been about four years we've been waiting for this game.

[00:21] We've known that Jersey Jack Pinball has been working on Toy Story for a very long time, right?

[00:27] So our expectations of this game have been very high.

[00:30] For many of you out there you love Toy Story as a theme so your expectations are even higher.

[00:35] And now that we've seen so much

[00:38] in such a short period of time,

[00:41] I wanna try to tackle this from a few angles.

[00:44] Like what is it like waiting for a game for years,

[00:48] getting your expectations up,

[00:50] and then seeing everything in just a one day window

[00:54] in which you're shown leaked images,

[00:57] and then you get to see a little bit of a two minute video,

[01:00] and then you're asked to buy the thing

[01:02] for 12,000 or $15,000,

[01:05] then you find out it's sold out,

[01:07] and then you find a 20 minute video that Zach does

[01:10] where he interviews the people who made the game,

[01:12] and then you watch another video of Joe Katz

[01:14] and the rule sets of the game,

[01:16] and all of this is happening

[01:17] while you're reading Pinside throughout the day

[01:20] as everyone is complaining left and right about the game.

[01:23] All of this is happening in one day,

[01:25] and I have to be honest, it is exhausting.

[01:28] It is absolutely exhausting.

[01:30] It's not fun, it's not fun reading all of that, vitriol.

[01:34] It's not fun hearing the company try to convince us

[01:36] this is the most innovative game in the 21st century.

[01:40] Something about today just felt like a big miss in my book,

[01:45] and I want to explain why I'm gonna talk about it.

[01:47] I also want to talk about the fact that none of us,

[01:49] not me, not you, nobody on this show,

[01:53] no one who's listening right now,

[01:55] well maybe Zach and a few other people,

[01:57] but nobody has played the game,

[01:59] and yet we are coming to finite conclusions on this game,

[02:03] and I don't want to write this game off,

[02:05] but I also don't want to just write a check for $15,000

[02:09] and hand it over to Jersey Jack Pinball

[02:11] or to a distributor without asking some questions

[02:14] about whether or not the value is there,

[02:16] whether or not we're getting what we're paying for,

[02:18] because I think that is part of this hobby right now.

[02:21] We have to ask ourselves, are we getting what we pay for,

[02:25] and then the bleak reality is this,

[02:27] it doesn't matter, the game's sold out.

[02:28] So even if this company didn't put everything in it

[02:31] that we wanted, it's sold out.

[02:33] Even if it's not based on Toy Story 1, 2, or 3, it's sold out.

[02:37] And it didn't just sell out in like an hour,

[02:40] it's sold out on JJP in like three minutes, three minutes.

[02:45] Now look, that doesn't mean every game is spoken for.

[02:48] We all know that distributors are going to have many,

[02:51] many, many of these games available for sale

[02:53] for more than $15,000.

[02:56] This is just the beginning of what happens next,

[02:58] the markups, we're gonna talk about that as well.

[03:01] But I think the main thing is this,

[03:03] I think it's taking people more than a day

[03:07] to just accept the fact that we got Toy Story 4.

[03:11] We didn't get Toy Story 1 through 3, we got Toy Story 4.

[03:15] And that's a hard pill for so many people to swallow.

[03:19] It is like saying,

[03:20] we are gonna make back to the future pinball,

[03:22] back to the future's coming, all right, awesome.

[03:25] Yeah, and then you get back to the future three.

[03:27] It's like saying, we're gonna make the matrix,

[03:29] and you make matrix resurrections.

[03:31] It's like saying, hey, we're gonna make Lord of the Rings

[03:33] and you only make the third movie.

[03:35] I would really love to know how they landed

[03:38] on just the fourth film.

[03:41] I would love to know why there was no discussion

[03:44] about putting all four movies into one pinball experience.

[03:48] They put all five Pirates of the Caribbean movies

[03:51] into one pinball machine.

[03:52] So why did we get just Toy Story 4?

[03:55] But I can't change that, right?

[03:57] I mean, I could complain about that,

[03:59] but I'm not gonna change it.

[04:00] It is what it is.

[04:00] The game is what it is.

[04:01] Here's the part I just can't figure out,

[04:03] because Toy Story 4 is not a movie about a carnival.

[04:08] It's not, like that is not the main part of the movie.

[04:12] Sure, there is a carnival there.

[04:15] There's a carnival that's across the street,

[04:16] I believe, from the antique shop,

[04:18] but this isn't a movie about moving these characters

[04:22] through a carnival.

[04:24] And yet that is what this entire game is.

[04:26] And I am listening to the rule sets,

[04:28] and it's like collect tickets to go on carnival rides.

[04:32] And I'm like, wait, what is this?

[04:33] Like, why is this the rule set for this game?

[04:37] This is a movie about a girl that loses her toy

[04:42] and the journey to go find the toy.

[04:46] It's not a movie about going on carnival rides

[04:49] and collecting tickets.

[04:51] What is it with Pat Lawler and collecting tickets, right?

[04:54] That was like the rule set for Willy Wonka.

[04:56] Now that made sense, because that's a movie

[04:59] about collecting five golden tickets

[05:02] to go through the Wonka factory.

[05:04] But Toy Story is not a movie about collecting tickets,

[05:07] but here we are again.

[05:08] I mean, this rule set is actually a lot like

[05:10] retro atomic zombie adventure land.

[05:12] It's all about collecting tickets

[05:14] and exchanging them to go on carnival rides.

[05:16] That's exactly what Raza was.

[05:18] But I don't know, like, when I hear them talk about it,

[05:20] and I think about the movie,

[05:21] I just keep feeling like, what's going on?

[05:24] Like, how are these themes being translated this way?

[05:28] Is it Disney?

[05:29] Are they pressuring them to do it this way?

[05:31] When you watch the video,

[05:32] when you watch the JJP team being interviewed,

[05:35] you can tell that they are absolutely flabbergasted

[05:39] that they get to make this Pixar game.

[05:42] Pixar is one of the most creative institutions

[05:44] on planet Earth, and I think Jersey Jack Pinball

[05:47] felt honored that they were making

[05:49] a Toy Story Pixar pinball machine.

[05:52] That's great, right?

[05:53] I love the fact that they felt this obligation

[05:55] to do this theme justice.

[05:58] So you've got that side of it, right?

[06:00] That this company that we know

[06:01] can do so much amazing stuff in pinball

[06:04] feels an obligation to make the greatest

[06:06] creative pinball machine of all time for Pixar.

[06:10] And then on the other side of the coin,

[06:12] you're putting in what look like,

[06:13] people are showing this, it's like,

[06:15] cake toppers are the figures

[06:17] that are just being dropped all over this game.

[06:19] Like, these aren't original sculpts for the machine,

[06:21] and these cake toppers are like 20 bucks.

[06:24] So you're gonna sell people a $15,000 machine,

[06:28] and it doesn't even have original scopes of Toy Story

[06:32] for the machine.

[06:33] It's off the shelf parts or figures.

[06:36] And we know this has been done before,

[06:38] but not on machines that cost $15,000.

[06:42] I feel like I need more than a day to process all of this.

[06:45] I also feel like this launch was really sloppy.

[06:49] I feel like something about it,

[06:50] it was just not well orchestrated.

[06:54] It just wasn't well executed.

[06:56] It was almost like they needed to not do this

[06:59] the way they normally do it.

[07:01] It just felt like there was too much we were trying

[07:03] to absorb all at once,

[07:05] and it started with bad news,

[07:07] that it was Toy Story 4 only.

[07:09] And I do think they needed to get in front of that.

[07:11] I think they needed to rip that bandaid off,

[07:14] and then you look down at the game,

[07:15] and look, everybody, come on.

[07:17] Like, have we lost all ability

[07:19] to sort of think about all the different

[07:21] major mechanisms in pinball machines,

[07:23] even when Jersey Jack talks about this game.

[07:27] They say the major mech in the game is the Duke ramp.

[07:31] It's just a little pop-up flap ramp in the game.

[07:34] That's the major mechanism in the game.

[07:37] And they said it, I didn't say it, they said it.

[07:40] I just get this overwhelming sense

[07:42] that like Jersey Jack pinball is trying to convince us

[07:47] that this thing is the most innovative game.

[07:50] It's the most fun pinball machine,

[07:52] that it's doing justice for the Toy Story property,

[07:55] that it was an honor to work with Pixar,

[07:57] and there's so much magic in this game.

[07:59] I just feel like they're trying to convince us,

[08:01] and even trying to convince themselves

[08:04] that that's the case.

[08:05] And in the greatest pinball machines

[08:07] we've all loved over the years,

[08:09] I just don't feel like there needed to be

[08:11] so much of a hard sell on what we're seeing,

[08:14] on what we're getting.

[08:16] And I don't know, maybe the game's gonna deliver, right?

[08:18] Maybe you're gonna play this game

[08:20] and you're gonna feel all of that excitement

[08:22] and all of that energy and all of that magic

[08:24] when you play this machine.

[08:26] But when I was watching the video,

[08:28] I feel like you can still tell

[08:30] that the mushy flipper feel is still around.

[08:32] Like you could see it, like the ball is not snapping up

[08:35] that play field the way it would in a stern machine.

[08:37] So I don't think that's gone away.

[08:40] I just can't get over the fact

[08:41] that we're not gonna go back to Andy's room,

[08:44] that we're not gonna go to Pizza Planet,

[08:46] that we're not gonna go to Al's Toy Barn,

[08:48] we're not gonna have lots of like disrupt our plans

[08:51] with Ken and Barbie and where's Mr. Potato Head,

[08:53] where's Etch-a-Sketch, where's Slinky?

[08:55] Like all of these things, all of these iconic characters,

[08:58] part of me was just hoping that after they revealed this game

[09:02] that it wouldn't sell out right away.

[09:04] Because I knew it, if this game sells out right away

[09:07] with what's in it, then as a community,

[09:09] we're heading in the wrong direction.

[09:11] We're heading in the wrong direction.

[09:13] This is not a $15,000 machine.

[09:15] This is not a $12,000 machine,

[09:18] but because it sold so well immediately,

[09:21] what message is that gonna send to Jersey Jack?

[09:24] What message is it gonna send the stern pinball?

[09:26] What message is it gonna send the spooky pinball?

[09:29] It's basically telling them if the theme is right,

[09:32] take my money now, regardless of what really is in the machine.

[09:36] So I just feel like a little deflated, I feel tired,

[09:39] I feel uncertain about this game.

[09:42] When I saw Guns N' Roses for the first time,

[09:44] I was certain it was awesome.

[09:46] You know, after watching the Toy Story video,

[09:48] I went and watched the Guns N' Roses launch video.

[09:51] I mean, it's night and day, it's night and day.

[09:53] The Guns N' Roses launch was spectacular, it was amazing.

[09:57] If it weren't for the playfield issues,

[09:59] Guns N' Roses would still be talked about

[10:02] as being the greatest pinball launch

[10:05] and one of the greatest pinball experiences,

[10:08] but we know it happened with all of the playfield issues.

[10:11] The other part no one wants to talk about

[10:12] is where are our replacement playfields for Guns N' Roses?

[10:16] I hope they announce that sometime soon

[10:18] because the Guns N' Roses line is done

[10:20] and I want my backup Collectors Edition playfield.

[10:23] But this is it now, right?

[10:25] This is it, it does feel like this hobby has jumped the shark.

[10:29] And I think many of you out there feel this way.

[10:32] There's just no way around it.

[10:34] I watched the stream with Joe Katz, I'm watching this game

[10:37] and I don't know like 12, $15,000

[10:40] and the game still does sound like a slot machine.

[10:44] Like they need to get David Thiel back.

[10:46] Like the game just doesn't have that rich sound

[10:49] that Jersey Jack pinball machines used to have.

[10:51] It's got all these bells, whistles, chimes

[10:53] and all these things that sound like you're walking around

[10:56] in a casino.

[10:58] And look, I know Jersey Jack wants to put a lot

[11:00] into their games and also make their games simple

[11:02] at the same time, but I just think something's missing.

[11:06] I just can't quite put my finger on it right now

[11:09] and I need more time to think about it.

[11:11] There's just something so similar about this game

[11:13] in Willy Wonka that just feels like some of the heart

[11:16] and the soul of these two properties.

[11:18] And I mean that, both Willy Wonka and Toy Story

[11:21] are two franchises that have a ton of heart and soul.

[11:24] And I'm just feeling like the pins aren't translating

[11:28] what we love about both of those properties

[11:31] in the right way.

[11:32] I think Willy Wonka has turned a corner

[11:34] and they made the game easier

[11:35] and now you're seeing more of the game.

[11:37] I mean, Pat Lawler talked about how it's a waste

[11:39] if only three people get to see fun stuff

[11:42] in the pinball machine.

[11:43] It's ironic that he said that because when he made Willy Wonka

[11:46] he buried so much of that game for the first year

[11:50] behind such a difficult rule set

[11:52] that almost nobody saw so much of the game.

[11:55] Like the last one third of that game nobody saw

[11:58] and now he's changing his tune, which is good,

[12:01] which is how it should be.

[12:02] A pinball machine shouldn't be something.

[12:03] You shouldn't make Willy Wonka

[12:05] where like after a year people only collect

[12:07] like two golden tickets.

[12:08] But I don't know, ladies and gentlemen,

[12:10] I don't know what happens here.

[12:11] Like what happens next?

[12:13] So I do know that this game is going to be at Pintastic

[12:17] at the end of June.

[12:18] So if you wanna play this game,

[12:20] if you wanna play Toy Story,

[12:22] you are gonna be able to play it at Pintastic.

[12:24] I saw Zach Mani getting a lot of heat

[12:27] because apparently I guess they were deleting

[12:29] some negative comments about this game.

[12:31] And obviously, you know,

[12:33] Zach went over to JJP and he recorded this game

[12:36] with his friends over at JJP.

[12:39] I don't think Zach should get any flak.

[12:41] This wasn't a review of the game.

[12:43] I mean, he just interviewed the people behind the game.

[12:45] And I thought the video was well done.

[12:47] I thought it was well shot.

[12:49] The only thing with the video, I was like,

[12:50] can we just play the game a little bit?

[12:52] You know, it was so much of interviewing Ken

[12:54] and Joe and Pat.

[12:56] And then like when the angles switch,

[12:58] it's kind of weird.

[12:59] Like these aren't like the most dynamic figures

[13:01] where we need to see different camera angles.

[13:03] But I was really hoping we were gonna see that video

[13:06] before people were asked to buy the game.

[13:09] I really can't figure out how they all sold out so fast.

[13:11] How did so many games sell so quickly at $15,000?

[13:16] That's it.

[13:17] That's the story of today.

[13:18] Nothing else really matters, right?

[13:20] My opinion about it, your opinion about it doesn't matter.

[13:24] Nothing really matters.

[13:25] The moment that they decided to make Toy Story,

[13:28] even if it was the least popular Toy Story version,

[13:32] it didn't even matter.

[13:34] The game sold like hotcakes.

[13:35] And I reached out to some of the distributors

[13:37] that I'm friends with and they were like,

[13:39] these things are gone.

[13:40] Like I've got a waiting list to get more of them.

[13:42] And the CEs are all spoken for.

[13:44] We're already seeing people list the CE on Pinside

[13:47] for $25,000.

[13:49] It's absolutely bonkers.

[13:51] And that just goes to show the power of the brand,

[13:54] the power of this franchise.

[13:56] I mean, Toy Story is a multi-billion dollar franchise.

[13:59] It is an amazing theme for Pinball.

[14:02] I just don't think it got the treatment it deserved.

[14:05] I don't think it got the right installment it deserved.

[14:08] And that's it.

[14:09] I mean, that's the story of today.

[14:10] That's my second take,

[14:11] is I think today was completely exhausting.

[14:14] It is exhausting hearing so many people be so negative

[14:18] about a game they've never, ever played.

[14:20] And I'm sorry if you think I overhyped it.

[14:23] Remember, I never saw this game.

[14:25] People were mad at me with Wonka because I played Wonka

[14:28] and I was excited about Wonka.

[14:30] And then I changed my tune on it.

[14:32] Now I never played this game.

[14:34] You can't fault me for saying that I'm somewhat underwhelmed

[14:37] by what I saw because I was seeing it for the first time

[14:40] with all of you.

[14:41] But it's been a long day.

[14:43] It's been a long day.

[14:44] I'm in Ireland.

[14:45] I woke up before all of you.

[14:47] And I saw photos of this game.

[14:49] Like I think someone probably in Australia

[14:51] hacked the website.

[14:52] I mean, let's talk about that for a minute.

[14:54] Like how are they using WordPress to launch this game?

[14:56] Like someone just hacked the WordPress JJP site

[15:00] and everything was out there well before they wanted it

[15:03] out there.

[15:04] And that spoiled a lot of it.

[15:05] Not that Zach's video would have erased that

[15:08] and not that the video with the guy and the girl

[15:10] playing it would have erased it.

[15:12] I just haven't seen anything yet.

[15:14] Everything I'm seeing on this game,

[15:16] it makes me curious to play it,

[15:18] but nothing really is selling me on the fact

[15:21] that this is gonna be like an incredible

[15:22] magical pinball experience.

[15:24] And I don't know where else to go emotionally with it.

[15:27] I don't know where else to go physically with it.

[15:29] I can't wait to play it.

[15:30] I did not get rid of my CE deposit.

[15:33] Why would I give up my CE deposit?

[15:35] I mean, it's just a deposit.

[15:37] And I wanna see which way the market goes on it.

[15:39] But for now, I'm still in on it.

[15:42] I heard they're not making the CEs until the fall.

[15:44] So that's good.

[15:45] It gives me more time to save up for it.

[15:47] And by the time I have to fully pay

[15:49] for my collector's edition,

[15:51] I will have ample time on the game.

[15:53] So I figured like, why not?

[15:55] Just keep it.

[15:55] Like I'm not gonna send them a message

[15:57] if I cancel my CE and declare

[16:00] that you didn't give us enough jersey jack pinball.

[16:02] Then great, some other guys just gonna go grab my spot

[16:04] and flip it for like $5,000 profit.

[16:06] Damn it, if anyone's gonna flip it for profit,

[16:08] it's gonna be me.

[16:09] No, I don't know.

[16:10] I don't know where the secondary market is.

[16:12] I don't know if people are still trying to get one.

[16:14] I don't think FOMO is gonna last very long on this game.

[16:17] I think there are so many of them made

[16:20] that I think you're gonna see a lot of distributors

[16:23] listing them for sale over the next few weeks.

[16:26] The other thing I just can't understand

[16:27] is I was reading stories of people who went on the website

[16:31] and it sold out in like two or three minutes

[16:34] and then they got frustrated and bought in LE.

[16:36] Really?

[16:37] I mean, you couldn't wait to see

[16:39] if some distributor would have a spot that would open up.

[16:42] I think these things got sold through

[16:44] to distributors mostly.

[16:46] And I think with a thousand of them out there,

[16:49] your chance of finding one for a decent price,

[16:51] I don't think it's gonna be too hard.

[16:53] I really don't because I don't think there's anything

[16:55] in the CE that really makes it that much better

[16:59] than the LE.

[17:00] I would be patient.

[17:01] Don't fall into the FOMO bucket on this one.

[17:03] This game is not gonna be the next Godzilla.

[17:06] This game is not.

[17:07] This doesn't feel like it's gonna be the next like

[17:09] Tron LE or Lord of the Rings.

[17:11] I just don't think this pin's gonna end up

[17:13] like in the top 10 on pin side.

[17:14] I don't.

[17:15] I don't know how this pin like overrides all the negativity

[17:19] and my gosh, you guys have been brutal.

[17:23] Brutal.

[17:24] But I think the brutality is somewhat deserved

[17:26] because I think the brutality comes from a place

[17:29] that's very simple.

[17:30] You guys love Toy Story.

[17:33] You love pinball.

[17:35] You wanted to see the greatest example of Toy Story pinball.

[17:39] And I think what you got was Pat Lawler's final game.

[17:43] And I do think this is gonna be Pat Lawler's final game.

[17:46] And I think it's gonna be his final game

[17:47] because I think he's out of ideas.

[17:49] And I think everyone is recognizing that.

[17:51] I'm not seeing all these original ideas.

[17:54] I'm seeing a lot of recycled thinking.

[17:56] I'm seeing stuff that'll probably shoot well.

[17:59] You know, I have good gameplay.

[18:01] The code'll save it, right?

[18:02] The code is more interesting than the layout looks.

[18:05] But ultimately, I think we're at the point now

[18:08] where Eric Minier and Keith are the two best designers

[18:11] in pinball.

[18:12] I'm seeing the two most creative designers

[18:14] in all of pinball, Keith Elwin and Eric Minier.

[18:17] And I think everybody else is chasing those two.

[18:20] Those two, every time they make a pin, they've been special.

[18:24] They have.

[18:25] Pire to a special when it launched.

[18:26] And so is Guns N' Roses.

[18:28] And I'm not feeling the same way from these games.

[18:31] You know, Pat's games all have this like similar feel to it.

[18:34] There's something about it.

[18:35] It doesn't feel like he throws out the playbook

[18:37] when he starts a game.

[18:38] It doesn't feel like he watches the movie.

[18:40] And then his creative brain

[18:42] just makes all this crazy stuff

[18:43] we never could think of before.

[18:44] It's almost like he's got a parts list

[18:46] of all the things he's done before.

[18:47] And he's like, how can I take this from No Good Govers?

[18:50] How can I take this from Worldwin?

[18:51] How can I take this from that?

[18:53] And he just puts it in the game.

[18:54] That's it, ladies and gentlemen.

[18:55] My voice is tired.

[18:56] I'm tired.

[18:57] I would love to know what you think about this game.

[18:59] I would love to know if you think I'm being too soft

[19:01] and if I'm being too apathetic,

[19:03] if you want me to scream about it.

[19:05] But I just would love to hear from you

[19:07] right in the comments section on the Patreon page.

[19:09] I wanna know what you think of Toy Story.

[19:11] If you bought one, why did you buy one?

[19:13] If you passed on one, why did you pass on one?

[19:16] I would love to just see what your thoughts are on this game.

[19:19] Everybody, let's get some sleep.

[19:21] Let's get some rest.

[19:23] This wasn't the day we expected.

[19:25] I thought we were gonna get a game

[19:26] that was absolutely gonna just blow everybody away.

[19:30] We didn't get it.

[19:31] We absolutely didn't get it.

[19:33] I think we got a game that's more of a head scratcher

[19:35] than a fist bump.

[19:36] And I think by making it Toy Story 4,

[19:39] this game was never really set up

[19:41] to be hugely popular with the pin side crowd.

[19:44] But somebody's buying these games.

[19:47] Like somebody out there is gobbling up these games.

[19:50] I don't know if it's Leonard.

[19:51] Like Leonard's got enough money

[19:53] to buy all of his own pinball machines.

[19:55] But how did they sell out in three minutes?

[19:58] That's the part.

[19:59] When I go to bed tonight,

[20:00] how did they sell so many in three minutes?

[20:02] And how many did they even have for sale?

[20:05] That's the other part.

[20:06] We don't know how many they sold on JGAP directly.

[20:10] I did feel bad for Ken

[20:11] because he made that video being like,

[20:13] here's your best chance at getting a CE.

[20:15] And there was no chance at all.

[20:16] Like hardly anybody got one.

[20:18] Anyway, we will see what happens.

[20:20] The debate is going to rage on.

[20:22] This game is gonna be polarizing people.

[20:25] It is gonna be a very polarizing pin.

[20:27] And I think the future of Jersey Jack pinball

[20:31] is now moving in a direction of more simplified games.

[20:35] LCD screens where there should be mechanisms

[20:38] and they are going to rely on lights and screens

[20:42] to get people attracted to their machines.

[20:44] And these things are gonna be easier for them to make.

[20:47] They wanna be like Stern.

[20:49] They wanna be able to make multiple games a year.

[20:52] And their approach to doing that is to simplify the games.

[20:55] The problem is, as they're taking stuff out,

[20:58] they're raising the price.

[20:59] And I think each and every one of us saw that today.

[21:02] And I think it underwhelmed us.

[21:04] And I think we felt the burn.

[21:06] But yet again, it sold out.

[21:09] So nothing we say seemingly matters.

[21:12] This hobby has jumped the shark.

[21:14] And it is now just theme, take my money.

[21:17] I don't even need to see much.

[21:18] I will buy stuff regardless of the price.

[21:21] Crazy times in pinball people.

[21:23] You'd think the stock market was doing great right now,

[21:25] but it's not.

[21:26] Canada out, I'll talk to you later.

[21:28] Doody, baby.

[21:28] Sipping on the goose like boozy, baby.
