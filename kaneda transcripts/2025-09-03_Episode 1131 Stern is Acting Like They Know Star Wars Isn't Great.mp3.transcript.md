[00:00] Alright, I'm just gonna say it.

[00:26] I think Star Wars is gonna be a bust.

[00:30] I'm gonna explain why.

[00:32] I think I'm wrong.

[00:33] I don't think it's gonna go to $18,000 for the Ellie of the Game.

[00:38] I've been just thinking about the fact that this game is coming out in one week's time.

[00:44] Think about that for a minute.

[00:45] In one week, Stern Pimble is gonna bring out the biggest IP in all of Pimble.

[00:52] In one week, Stern is gonna unveil to us their newest platform.

[00:57] In one week, after we got the little teaser, this is the moment that this company is gonna

[01:04] drop into the world a game it needs to be its biggest hit since Godzilla.

[01:11] And the expectations for Star Wars are bigger than anything they've come out with ever.

[01:19] And we've all been waiting for a great Star Wars machine forever.

[01:24] People who say they're fatigued by another Star Wars game have forgotten there's only

[01:29] really been two Star Wars games in the history of Stern Pimble.

[01:36] I don't count the Star Wars game at Costco as a game.

[01:40] Neither do you.

[01:42] You don't know anyone who owns it.

[01:44] So it's just the Steve Richie game that was eight years ago and the Mandalorian.

[01:50] And that's it.

[01:51] So I don't have Star Wars fatigue, do you?

[01:55] And so they're going back to the well, the original trilogy, Jon Borg, you got Ray Day

[02:02] on Code, you got Spike 3, the games a week away.

[02:07] This is the biggest IP in all of Pimble, bigger than Harry Potter, not as big as Pokemon

[02:11] in terms of IP sales, but it's bigger than Pokemon in terms of this target audience's

[02:18] affinity for the theme.

[02:21] And we're seven days away and nothing.

[02:25] No hype, no energy, no enthusiasm.

[02:29] Nobody's speaking about how they can't wait for us to see the game.

[02:34] Nothing.

[02:35] In fact, what we are hearing and what is trickling out from the Stern Factory is a lot of mediocrity.

[02:41] The game is okay is what I heard directly from someone who's over there.

[02:47] Okay.

[02:49] How does she look?

[02:50] She looks okay.

[02:52] Is the car fast?

[02:54] It's okay.

[02:55] You know, are you happy with like your house?

[02:58] It's okay.

[02:59] That is like the ultimate way to say something is mediocre.

[03:03] Not hearing stuff like, can't wait to see this man.

[03:07] Canada, wait, do you see what the ball is going to do when you go there?

[03:10] Or wait, do you see this toy or this mech or wait, do you hear this thing in all of our

[03:14] new spike three glory?

[03:16] Nothing.

[03:17] Nothing.

[03:18] Now look, are they purposely sandbagging it because they want to blow us away?

[03:22] Or is the latter what I'm about to say, I think the truth that this company, even though

[03:29] it's Star Wars, even though it's like the biggest movie franchise of our childhoods,

[03:36] this company is just going to release it like it's another game.

[03:40] Nothing different.

[03:41] Did they invite the Star Wars fan sites in early to see this game so they could start

[03:48] hyping it?

[03:49] No.

[03:50] When are the media going to see this game?

[03:51] And this tells me everything.

[03:52] When are you going to see it?

[03:54] After the game has already been revealed, they want you to book travel to go there next Wednesday.

[04:02] Why?

[04:03] You're not going to get any exclusive.

[04:05] The whole world is going to see this game beforehand.

[04:08] By the time you know what's in this game, your plane tickets will have been purchased.

[04:14] Your hotel rooms will have been paid for.

[04:17] You're not going to be able to like turn around and change your mind.

[04:21] You have to now schedule a trip to Sturm Pinball, break up your work week because nobody's doing

[04:26] this for a living, and by the time you know what the game is, it's too late.

[04:31] There's nothing they're giving you.

[04:33] A media person wants to get in early and get their content created beforehand so when they

[04:40] reveal the game on Monday or Tuesday, you have everything ready to go live.

[04:45] That's not going to be the case.

[04:47] So no, I'm not going out there.

[04:49] I'm not taking the free dinner, but I'm just not hearing anything from anyone over there

[04:56] that indicates to me anything other than the fact that they have everything asset wise

[05:00] in it.

[05:01] You've got everything asset wise in it.

[05:04] You had it the last time you made the game, so none of that is surprising to me.

[05:09] What's really concerning to me is the lack of doing anything different.

[05:17] This to me speaks about one thing and one thing only.

[05:21] Sturm Pinball has a formula and no matter what the theme is, no matter what the climate

[05:29] is in the pinball community, no matter anything, no other factors change what they do.

[05:34] They just always drop everything into the world the same exact way.

[05:41] My thing with Sturm and the way they're making games, and you can hear the way they talk about

[05:46] it.

[05:47] You can hear it in the designers and now the rumors that Keith Elwin's not happy, Jack

[05:53] Danger had a quit designing.

[05:57] What?

[05:58] Why?

[05:59] What a red flag that is about what it's like to make games over there.

[06:04] And now look, he looks a little bit like a wounded tiger just making his, I love Jack's

[06:08] content.

[06:09] You know I love his content, but man it like destroyed him and you could see it like it

[06:14] really was taken over his life.

[06:17] So like the thing is this, it feels like a really big company that's incapable of adapting

[06:25] a little bit, of being more flexible, of reminding itself why they do this in the first place.

[06:33] And I understand, you know I just listened to an interview with David Vaness over at

[06:39] Gonzo Pinball.

[06:40] It's like an hour and a half interview, right?

[06:43] And it's just like look, say what you will.

[06:45] Like I've got issues with the Dune theme.

[06:47] I understand why they made it.

[06:50] You know I understand that it's not everybody's cup of tea, but it was nice to hear the enthusiasm

[06:56] he has for making these games.

[06:58] Like I don't think they're firing on all cylinders just yet.

[07:01] I think when they get a better theme and they understand the community a little bit more

[07:06] and you know they pay someone like Canadian to come in there and give the company a little

[07:10] swagger and a jolt that it needs, they're going to be fine.

[07:13] But at least you know I feel this like desire to get better and keep improving.

[07:20] You feel that desire over at Spooky Pinball to keep improving.

[07:25] We're going to see that when we look at Dutch Pinball, X's, Raza, keep improving, keep making

[07:31] stuff better.

[07:33] Jersey Jack originally said every game is going to be better than Wizard of Oz.

[07:37] That wasn't always the case, but now they have improved the gameplay and the fun factor

[07:43] of Jersey Jack games.

[07:46] And the thing that's hard for Stern is they do make the most fun games in Pinball.

[07:52] They're the most successful company for a reason.

[07:56] They're not at the top of the mountain because they made crappy game after crappy game.

[08:03] They're not at the top of the mountain because they picked bad themes.

[08:07] They're at the top of the mountain because they consistently deliver the greatest Pinball

[08:12] fun in the history of Pinball.

[08:15] There's a reason why on the top 100 list most of those top games are Stern, even though

[08:21] now Dungeons & Dragons is number three and Dune is number two on that list.

[08:27] People kept sending me that.

[08:28] No one takes that list seriously when a new game enters the list because being new on

[08:33] that list, all it is is the early buyers of the game just trying to pump up the game.

[08:41] It doesn't mean they're going to sell more because someone up the street is going to

[08:45] see the top 10 list and be like, oh, Dungeons really the second greatest Pinball machine

[08:49] of all time.

[08:50] It's silly to have a game with like 57 reviews.

[08:53] Number two in the world.

[08:54] I mean, I guess you could look at it more like the billboard, but then it should be like

[08:58] that.

[08:59] It should be more about the top games of 2025.

[09:04] But again, billboard is not based on reviews of people who listen to the album.

[09:10] You enter the top billboard list based on sales and that is something that all of these

[09:17] pinball companies are afraid of.

[09:20] Releasing their actual sales numbers.

[09:23] They all hide it.

[09:24] All of them.

[09:25] Nobody is honest.

[09:26] The only ones we can actually figure out are the ones like Spooky who sell out.

[09:30] So if you're making 888 games and you're sold out, I could take a real easy guess.

[09:37] How many games you sold?

[09:39] Okay.

[09:40] So Star Wars a week away, this big company that's been so successful.

[09:44] Why does it feel like they are struggling to get us excited about Star Wars?

[09:50] Didn't they just hire a new chief marketing officer?

[09:57] He's now been over there for months.

[10:00] The first major release under his new tenure is Star Wars.

[10:07] What are we going to do?

[10:08] Let's just do what we've always done.

[10:11] We'll do the same launch as if it's Venom, as if it's John Wick.

[10:16] So I'm here to tell you right now.

[10:18] I'm going to make a complete 180 on this game.

[10:21] I haven't seen it and I know this is not fair to the team that worked on it, but I think

[10:26] I'm reading the room.

[10:28] The silence is speaking volumes for me on this game.

[10:32] I think it's going to be just another stern.

[10:36] I don't think it's going to be the next Godzilla.

[10:40] I don't think Borg with a two flipper game is going to give you the next Godzilla.

[10:45] You're more likely going to get a game that's more like his data East game, a more of a

[10:51] fan layout with some mechs.

[10:54] I actually now believe the rumor that it's not going to be the big at at Walker.

[11:00] It's going to be the smaller at ST Walker, which nobody ever talks about.

[11:05] Yeah, it plays a role in Return of the Jedi, but now I feel like it's going to be that.

[11:10] And he's going to recycle the mech from Avatar and it's just going to fall over when you

[11:16] kill it or, you know, knock it out of commission, which is what it does in the movie, but it's

[11:21] not going to be a wow.

[11:24] If you're a Star Wars fanatic and you're going to put a mech into the game, it's not going

[11:30] to be the AT ST, which none of us long for.

[11:36] It's more the at at is the iconic one.

[11:39] And so this is the thing.

[11:41] I think Stern pinball is just in a place now where the machine got so big, the company

[11:48] got so big, the need to keep the line moving got so big.

[11:53] And clearly, I think we can say this with confidence, they got greedy.

[11:59] They did get greedy and they got cheap.

[12:01] They got really cheap.

[12:02] Once you started selling people $2,000 toppers, it was a middle finger to the community.

[12:10] And we haven't forgotten that.

[12:12] And, you know, while the really wealthy fanboys want to keep apologizing, I think many of

[12:18] us are tired of that.

[12:19] And not only that, so you got the $2,000 ripoff toppers and then you charge the price

[12:25] of your game the highest it's ever been.

[12:27] And you don't even make them special.

[12:29] You're giving people $13,000 that don't even come with an exclusive topper.

[12:35] They don't come with even artwork that makes the game look much better.

[12:39] And so what have you done to your community, Stern?

[12:42] You've absolutely treated the community over the last five years like anything you make

[12:49] will sell like hotcakes.

[12:50] And we talk about it.

[12:52] They legitimately built up this new company as if the demand for their product would be

[12:58] the way it was during COVID.

[12:59] It has been anything but that.

[13:02] And then the competition since that time period has continued to get better, be

[13:08] friendlier, more transparent and, you know, give you more bang for the buck.

[13:13] Now look, it's a hard balance to find.

[13:16] When Spooky Pinball is selling $450 shotgun shooter handles that cost a lot more than

[13:24] a real shotgun, you know, they're going to start getting some of those questions.

[13:30] The same that Stern does.

[13:32] Like, should it be this much?

[13:34] Sure, you can make the money, but are you getting a little greedy on this?

[13:39] And you start to see what success does.

[13:43] It starts to make you think like they love us so we can get away with it.

[13:48] And that's what happened to Stern.

[13:51] And the problem is, is we don't love you that much, Stern.

[13:55] We don't love pinball that much.

[13:58] Most people out there who love pinball, I love pinball.

[14:02] Most of you love pinball.

[14:03] Why would you be here?

[14:04] Right?

[14:04] Most of us who love pinball don't love spending $39,000 on three L.E.s.

[14:14] that don't look special.

[14:16] We don't love it enough to lose $10,000 on those three L.E.s.

[14:21] because you sold us a product that was marked up.

[14:25] And listen to me when I say this, these products coming from the factory are

[14:31] priced way higher than people value them at.

[14:36] That's not good.

[14:39] And you know, the argument or the car argument that, well, that's what happens

[14:42] with new cars.

[14:43] Yeah, those car companies would be out of business if they were in a category

[14:49] as small as pinball, because pinball is a very small category and does rely on

[14:55] collector confidence.

[14:58] If you destroy that, there's a reason why Stern, you know, for all the years,

[15:03] people forget this, the reason why they sold so many pros and premiums to distros

[15:07] and dealers is so those distros and dealers could secure their allotments of L.E.s.

[15:15] Now that means nothing.

[15:17] That has no value.

[15:19] And so I said on a previous show, only 770 Star Wars L.E.s.

[15:24] they're going to sell out instantly and they're going to go up to $18,000.

[15:29] The hell was I smoking?

[15:32] Now a week later, I don't feel the same way.

[15:36] I feel no hype.

[15:38] I feel no enthusiasm.

[15:40] John Borg's doing what?

[15:42] Streaming his old games?

[15:43] What's that about?

[15:45] How is that going to get me excited?

[15:46] Holding up a job of the hut figurine that looks like it cost five bucks.

[15:54] Holding that up to a camera and telling me this is going to be just what?

[15:59] Hot glue gun or screwed into my $13,000 game.

[16:05] It's not going to be a job of the hut that talks, that has any animation that moves,

[16:11] that does anything.

[16:13] I could walk into a Walmart and I could go down a toy aisle and I could see toys

[16:20] that cost $30 that will have more movement and more magic than what I'm going to get

[16:28] inside a machine for $13,000.

[16:33] And the fatigue is real.

[16:35] The lack of passion.

[16:37] It just feels like it.

[16:39] The they seem like an exhausted institution.

[16:42] And I mean that in exhausted institution has a Star Wars game.

[16:49] Has a new CMO and does nothing.

[16:53] Now, again, I could be 100% wrong right now.

[16:58] They could be purposely sandbagging it and just want to blow us away with Spike 3.

[17:05] But I don't think that's going to happen.

[17:08] Even in my conversations with them over there, like a year ago about Spike 3, you know, it

[17:16] was more of like a new sort of like evolution, not a revolution.

[17:23] And so I think we've seen a lot of Spike 3 already in recent games.

[17:28] And believe me, I've stood over the machine at Jack Bar that has the bigger screen in

[17:32] that Godzilla.

[17:34] It's not going to change much.

[17:36] It's not as wow as like the Jersey Jack screen.

[17:40] So, you know, if that's all it is, and then the cabinets don't have like the newer

[17:45] lighting system in it, it's a halfway Spike 3 introduction.

[17:50] No one's out there screaming.

[17:51] This is the next Godzilla.

[17:53] This is the next big hit.

[17:54] Stern is finally going to answer all of our Star Wars prayers.

[17:58] Nobody's talking like that.

[18:00] Nobody.

[18:01] And so, you know, maybe this is good news for everybody else making games.

[18:06] The giant is vulnerable more than it's ever been.

[18:10] And, you know, when I think about this hobby and why we're all here, it's like,

[18:14] I really want every game to be great.

[18:16] I do.

[18:17] I want every game to be amazing.

[18:19] I want every game to kind of connect with me.

[18:22] I want games to make us giddy.

[18:24] I want games to make us feel like little kids again.

[18:27] I think everybody wants that.

[18:29] I just don't think people are delivering much of that.

[18:32] I really don't.

[18:33] And I think some games get it right.

[18:35] But I think we've been gaslit.

[18:37] I think so much creativity has come out of these games.

[18:41] It is absolutely incredible to me.

[18:44] What people consider to be a packed world under glass.

[18:49] Putting artwork down is not a world.

[18:53] That is a poster.

[18:55] A lot of the emptiness is hidden with artwork and plastic and shots.

[19:03] But there's not much to say, hey, I wonder how to get over there.

[19:08] I wonder what that does.

[19:10] I wonder like how all, you know, I mean, again, like,

[19:13] go look at some of these games that were loaded, truly loaded with really creative,

[19:19] physical things the ball interacts with.

[19:23] And then you look at certain new games.

[19:25] And I'm sorry, but I just don't see it.

[19:28] And, you know, those games when they originally came out, I'm talking

[19:31] about the Williams now originally came out were $2,500 games.

[19:36] You adjust that for inflation.

[19:38] Yeah, we're kind of around where we are now.

[19:40] Right.

[19:41] And that's my point.

[19:42] Yeah.

[19:43] So for inflation, they might be around like $6,000 to $7,000 now for that game.

[19:48] Even if it was $10,000.

[19:50] All right, cool.

[19:51] Put a $10,000 twilight zone.

[19:54] Star Trek, the next generation, Theater of Magic, Toten, put these games,

[19:59] Adams family, put them next to them with modern coding, put them next to what we have now.

[20:06] And that's the point is all this stuff now is $10,000 to $15,000.

[20:13] And it's just one after another after another.

[20:15] And it's just starting to feel like modern pinball has its work cut out for it.

[20:21] And I feel like a lot of people are starting to feel if I'm going to buy something and

[20:28] I'm going to commit this much money.

[20:30] I'm not going to be an idiot now and just chase everything new in box because

[20:34] that's just a recipe for losing so much money.

[20:37] It's stupid, right?

[20:38] It's almost like you got a mark on your head that you're a dodo if you're buying

[20:42] every single new in box game that comes out.

[20:45] The new bar is these games really need to feel like they are the product and the outcome

[20:53] of a great idea, execute it with tremendous passion.

[20:57] So much so the company can't wait for you to see it and can't stop talking about it.

[21:05] And I think the old world of pinball, and I mean this, the old world is you remain

[21:10] dead silent about what you're doing, what you're working on.

[21:14] You know, I'm just going to say this, like I was talking to someone at Jersey,

[21:17] Jack, they're like, we don't care that people know that Steve Ritchie is making

[21:23] Sonic the hedgehog.

[21:24] They said that to me.

[21:25] We don't care.

[21:26] The rumors out there, it's true.

[21:28] We're so confident in Harry Potter.

[21:31] We're so confident in Steve's next game.

[21:34] We're so confident in the game after that, that we don't need to rely on this old

[21:40] world model of absolute silence, FOMO on day one, try to get everybody to fight

[21:48] claw over each other to get an LE.

[21:50] Those days are over.

[21:52] Jersey Jack's not even limiting Harry Potter CE and it's selling phenomenally well.

[21:58] Okay.

[21:59] Stern Pinball, it's like, they think it's still like 2021.

[22:04] They really do.

[22:05] They're like stuck in 2021.

[22:09] And I'm just here to tell you right now, because of the silence, because this game

[22:14] is Star Wars and a week away and read the room, read the vibes.

[22:20] Silence is speaking volumes.

[22:23] They need to wake up.

[22:25] I'm going to just say it.

[22:26] I think the game is going to be mediocre.

[22:28] I don't think it's going to blow us away now.

[22:31] I'm just that.

[22:32] And again, I hope I'm wrong.

[22:34] I hope a week from now, I am like, wow.

[22:39] Wow, they did it.

[22:40] Like they finally made the Star Wars game we've been waiting for.

[22:46] But man, I don't know if it's just like coming off of like a long holiday weekend

[22:51] and having to go back to work has got me in a little bit of a, you know, a mood.

[22:56] You know, I by live yesterday talked about how a friend is a little, you know,

[23:00] she wants me to pull more weight.

[23:01] She's not wrong.

[23:03] It's it's just sometimes like it's easy to sort of.

[23:07] Well, it's not easy, right?

[23:09] I mean, for those of you who have partners and wives and children and I had

[23:13] children later in life, like it's not easy.

[23:16] Like I'm going to be 49 years old in three weeks.

[23:21] I might not look it.

[23:22] I might not always feel it, but I am and I'm tired, you know, and I'm not getting

[23:27] I don't have the energy if I had the little kids when I was in my 20s.

[23:30] So it's like on top of that, on top of that,

[23:34] it's trying to keep this whole ship in the ocean, you know, and it's

[23:38] it's not always easy because, you know, as you get to middle age in life,

[23:41] working for somebody, it's difficult.

[23:44] It's difficult.

[23:45] Like I literally am almost 50 and I still have homework every night.

[23:51] And it's it's difficult because it's not homework I always want to be doing.

[23:55] In fact, the older you get, it gets more difficult to keep turning in homework.

[23:59] And in my industry, imagine doing homework every night

[24:03] and the majority of it because I'm creating ideas for clients.

[24:07] The majority of the thinking gets torn up in your face.

[24:12] They just don't exit.

[24:13] You know, they just don't execute much.

[24:16] Clients have become more risk adverse.

[24:19] AI is going to blow up my industry real soon.

[24:22] And I'm worried about the world.

[24:24] I am. I mean, look, as much as I'm not really that worried about

[24:27] Star Wars, because the best it's like it's like a win win for us.

[24:31] If the game is great, we get a great Star Wars game.

[24:34] That's a win.

[24:35] If the game is terrible, we save, you know, seven to $13,000.

[24:41] That's a win.

[24:43] It really is.

[24:43] It is such a buyer's world now in pinball where everything's a win win.

[24:48] Only go in on something if it's an amazing pin.

[24:51] You know, the things I'm really worried about in life is I worry that like

[24:55] society is just turning on all this social media, ruining the happiness of

[25:00] children, messing with kids heads, like all the stuff going on there.

[25:04] And I'm just worried that we've just turned on AI that's going to blow up

[25:09] so many people's jobs that they need.

[25:13] And what it's going to end up doing is forcing society and culture to become

[25:19] socialist because everyone's going to need a government wage to survive.

[25:26] If we blow up so many jobs with technology, and is that what we need?

[25:32] Why do we need all of this like advancing towards what?

[25:37] It's like the goal of humanity is not happiness anymore.

[25:41] It's efficiencies and corporate profit.

[25:45] And you know, to bring it back to pinball, kind of feel like that's more

[25:49] what's driving Stern now than passion.

[25:53] Does it feel like the entire Stern organization came together to collaborate,

[25:59] to make Star Wars the greatest Star Wars pinball machine of all time?

[26:04] No, it doesn't.

[26:06] It probably was more like, oh, John Borg lost Indiana Jones.

[26:09] We got to give him something.

[26:11] You know, we'll give him this.

[26:12] You know, it feels more like that.

[26:14] And if John's working on it, I don't know, it doesn't feel like, oh, you know,

[26:18] Keith Owens helping them, Jack Danger's helping them.

[26:20] They're all jumping on and giving ideas.

[26:22] No, it's like, this is mine.

[26:24] Like that's what it feels like.

[26:25] And I can say this as someone who's an older creative.

[26:29] As you get older, the hardest thing to do as a creative is actually realize you

[26:34] need more help now than ever.

[26:37] That if you just go off solo and you make Chinese democracy like Axel, it's not

[26:43] going to be nearly as good because you're going to, you're going to think you did

[26:46] it all and you were the, you were the genius, like inspiration behind all the

[26:49] great songs.

[26:50] And then you realize it was more like you were young, you were hungry, you were

[26:55] broke and you had your friends around you and you all collaborated to make

[27:00] appetite for destruction.

[27:02] And I think that's the thing.

[27:03] And that's why Jack Danger is more important to me than any of these older

[27:08] designers.

[27:09] You need young, new creative teams over in these pinball companies that are

[27:15] hungry to make a name for themselves and not, you know, the old guard that's

[27:21] really just making games because they've got a chip on their shoulder about all

[27:26] the internal politics that probably happen at a pinball company.

[27:31] Everybody, it's September 3rd.

[27:34] In five days, we will know if I was right or wrong.

[27:40] It's funny too.

[27:40] You notice how Canadian does this because now I've done two shows.

[27:44] Star Wars is going to be amazing.

[27:46] It's going to be worth $18,000.

[27:48] Star Wars is going to be terrible.

[27:50] There's a reason why they're not hyping it.

[27:52] They know it's not good.

[27:53] Okay.

[27:53] So now I've taken both sides.

[27:56] This is how, this is how you do it.

[27:58] Then you can't be wrong.

[28:00] You know, people call me bipolar.

[28:02] I don't know.

[28:02] Is this bipolar?

[28:03] No, I just think it's like you wake up some days and just change your mind.

[28:06] I've changed my mind on Star Wars and it's because we're a week out and this

[28:11] company has nothing for us.

[28:13] Everybody, we're going to find out real soon.
