[00:00] I have to use the MacBook microphone for this little teaser intro

[00:03] But the show itself that I just put up today is really awesome and done properly

[00:07] But all episodes this week are gonna be exclusive for Canadian club members

[00:11] So if you are a member look out for it if you're not you should join the club

[00:15] You've been listening to the show for like five years. It's time the time has come

[00:19] We are almost at 250 club members super exciting. We're gonna get the 300 by Tpf

[00:24] This is a really fun episode where I talk about the new games their prices and what it means for collectors little teaser for you guys to chew on

[00:36] I love seeing it. I love seeing some of my rich friends throw stupid money at games that don't make them any happier

[00:43] At games that they're now afraid to play when you unbox an Elvira 40th guess what you're not gonna want to play it

[00:50] You're not gonna want to beat on it. You might as well just buy a regular Elvira and play that every day

[00:57] Next to your 40th anniversary edition because why would you want to put wear and tear on this ultra rare

[01:05] Only

[01:06] 199 in the world for

[01:08] $24,000. Why would you beat on it? Why would you play it?

[01:12] Isn't it just a work of art? That's the only thing you paid more for think about it

[01:17] The only thing you paid more for was the artwork and the armor and things you look at

[01:24] It's the same game for $8,000

[01:27] So why would you beat on this stuff? That is the artwork just let the game sit and smile because that's what it is a

[01:35] $25,000 work of art now where does this leave the pinball collector?

[01:39] I've been thinking about it. Let's also just say for the record

[01:47] Oh
