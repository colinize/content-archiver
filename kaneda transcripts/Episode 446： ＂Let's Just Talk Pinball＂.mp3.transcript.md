[00:00] Maybe you could be my intern intern I said you had cook up summer in the winter

[00:05] Aaron Lutter, Raldon, when will he learn call something on us at your read the lady

[00:14] You know I have a revolutionary idea for this episode of Canadian Spinball podcast

[00:19] How about we all just go back to talking about pinball right so what I want to do is I want to share with you

[00:26] It's just been in my mind in the pinball world with the pinball companies and the pinball games

[00:32] We're all thinking about waiting for and dreaming of how's that sound on this episode of Canadian Spinball podcast

[00:39] So here's where my mind has really been thinking about lately

[00:43] I've been thinking about Rick and Morty a lot and maybe it's because today when I walked into my building

[00:50] I received my Fang Club

[00:54] membership tube now I already know it's inside it

[00:58] I know there's two cozy's and there's a poster which weirdly because I've seen it

[01:05] Tells you to join the Fang Club

[01:09] It's just the weirdest thing like you've joined the Fang Club and you get a poster that tells you that you should join

[01:16] The Fang Club now

[01:18] I think a lot of people out there would have liked to have got in something that is more worthy of

[01:26] Hanging on your wall in your game room

[01:28] I'm not gonna hang this thing up, but I can't complain because let's be honest people all of us

[01:35] Join the Fang Club to be able to get a Rick and Morty pinball machine

[01:40] The Fang Club was around a lot longer than Rick and Morty sales were we members then but we're members now now remember

[01:48] Your payment to the Fang Club auto

[01:51] Suscribes you so if you are not interested in a Rick and Morty or didn't get one you might want to go and not

[01:59] Automatically re-subscribed next year for the Fang Club now chucking company. I mean two cozy's

[02:06] An a poster and they made like thirty something thousand dollars on all those Fang Club subscriptions, which is great great marketing

[02:14] I think a lot of people feel like they didn't really get to cut the line

[02:17] It didn't really give them a better shot at getting a game

[02:22] But I think everyone who wanted a Rick and Morty got one for the most part

[02:27] Unless you were living under a rock and didn't realize sales were happening that money. Here's the other thing

[02:32] I just keep thinking about and we haven't talked about this but we need to talk about this on Canadian Spinball podcast

[02:40] I'm in on a Rick and Morty. I can't wait to see it. I can't wait to play it

[02:44] I don't know if it's great. I don't know if it's bad. I don't know if it's fun. I don't know if it's shallow

[02:51] I don't know anything nobody really knows much. I know Scott Denise is making it and I know Scott Denise

[02:58] He did a great job with TNA

[03:01] But let me just tell you what's been sort of itching at the back of my mind with this game a little bit and I and I'm

[03:08] Curious what you guys think and email me at canada pinball at gmail.com here. Here's a few things that I just

[03:15] Are unavoidable as we think about this games arrival and it's got to be sometime soon

[03:21] The number one thing I keep thinking about

[03:23] And I don't know how this quite happened and and this sort of

[03:27] maybe just was a slow build of

[03:30] Additional things you could do to your game and additional accessories you could order from spooky pinball

[03:36] But you can literally

[03:38] in

[03:39] 2020

[03:40] Fill out in order form for a spooky pinball game and that game can come in

[03:47] At $9,000 a

[03:50] spooky pinball machine you can option out to being

[03:55] 9,000 bucks. I mean let that sink in for a little bit a

[04:01] $9,000 spooky machine

[04:03] Put it next to a $9,000

[04:07] Jjp and a $9,000 stern machine

[04:11] Obviously, it's much closer. I think in what you get from stern than it is Jjp

[04:16] Oh, and this is always why I tell you guys

[04:20] Jjp is

[04:21] Embarrassingly underpriced in this hobby you might hate me for saying that

[04:26] But you're all getting your Jersey Jack machines at an absolute steal of a price at where Jack has his machines price

[04:35] It's embarrassingly low

[04:37] Now obviously the major upgrade that gets a spooky machine to $9,000 is the

[04:44] unnecessary but ultra beautiful

[04:46] Butter cabinet which is a thousand dollar upgrade now

[04:50] I don't know about you, but I

[04:52] Given the chance to check all the boxes

[04:56] When I get a pinball machine I check them all because I am a guy that wants the nicest version of something

[05:03] I'm going to get like what's the point of getting I don't you know, I don't get premiums

[05:08] I don't I don't I don't the LEDs are usually nicer they look nicer and I like the aesthetics of pinball

[05:14] obviously does not change gameplay

[05:16] And and so you can get a rick and morty all the way up to $9,000

[05:21] Now is it worth it and we have this debate a lot and and

[05:27] Obviously the value is in the hands and the eyes of the of the buyer for a lot of people out there if this is a dream theme

[05:36] Then you want maybe the nicest version and

[05:39] If it's if it's not you're you're able to get it for less than $9,000

[05:44] But there's no such thing as like an Ellie or a non Ellie, right?

[05:48] There's no premium and pros in Chuck's world

[05:51] Every game's the same except for the blood sucker edition which comes with the nicer armor

[05:56] You know the artwork is the same on both editions the translates the same and so it it's ostensibly the same game and

[06:04] So do I think a spooky pinball machine is worth $9,000?

[06:09] Now I'm gonna be fully honest when I say I don't and I think they know that too

[06:15] I think the this stuff is cosmetic

[06:18] You're paying for these cosmetic differences and the butter cabinet while unnecessary

[06:25] It is gorgeous if you've seen a butter cabinet in person. It is gorgeous. It also is

[06:31] Extremely fragile and if you mess up your butter cabinet

[06:35] Well, that's all folks ain't no replacing it with another decal and the spooky decals are also really nice

[06:43] So you I think you you get a butter cabinet if it's a game that you want to keep for a long time

[06:49] I think you also get a butter cabinet if it's a game that's going to be

[06:54] In your lineup in a way in which you can see the cabinet

[06:57] I always laugh when guys like you know when guys get like Stern Ali's and they they go all in and they

[07:03] Rave about the art package and then it's like game number four in a row of like 10 games and you can't even see the side art

[07:09] I am a side cabinet artwork

[07:12] Fan I I'd never like

[07:15] Pimball machines when you can't see the cabinet artwork. I just don't I I think

[07:20] Once you're cramming games in so tightly

[07:23] I think you lose a lot of the artistic appeal of a game

[07:28] All right, so the other question people are having is if you get the butter edition

[07:33] Will it hold its value or will it not when if you go to resell the game

[07:39] What will you get back for for upgrading the machine by a thousand dollars for a butter cabinet now?

[07:45] Look, I don't think you're gonna get one to one dollars back

[07:48] But I also don't think you get nothing back. It's a nicer version. It's a nicer cabinet

[07:53] It's a nicer polish on the machine. I I would a if I were selling my game and

[08:00] I'm not but if I were I

[08:03] Would definitely

[08:05] Charge someone more because I'm going off of what my invoice was if they want if they're machine to look this nice

[08:11] This is what they would have had to have spent and I don't think you lose on a butter cabinet the way you lose

[08:18] On mods that you put into the game

[08:21] After the fact because nothing that comes from the factory is a mod and you you ordered it in

[08:29] In the highest trim level possible and I think that holds more value than if you were to add

[08:36] Additional armor from from like pinball refinery when when outside

[08:42] Companies mod your game you never get that back the way you would if those items came as factory options

[08:50] Sounds a lot like the car world when you're thinking about you know, which options actually hold value

[08:56] And I would also argue if you mod too much a game like if you custom powder coat your game a

[09:03] Different color than the factory. I actually think that significantly can decrease the value

[09:09] Versus adding to the value because now you've gone and you've made it look completely different than the manufacturer

[09:15] You know and they're designed and they're vision for the game

[09:18] So $9,000 butter cabinet. I'm gonna order the butter cabinet because it's gonna be the only game in my living room

[09:25] Now the other thing I keep thinking about with Rick and Morty is when are we gonna see this game?

[09:29] You know, there's a lot of people that are all curious what this game's gonna be like and

[09:35] The more I think about it. Do you think that spooky is stalling a little bit?

[09:40] They don't really need to stall because they sold every one

[09:43] But now that they've sold every one there they are 100%

[09:48] 1,000 1 million percent they're in the driver's seat

[09:52] There's absolutely no rush for them to show people anything and we all know this. This is the truth

[10:00] That as long as they don't show this game in

[10:04] Everyone's head the game is terrific. I mean look at stranger things right now

[10:08] We're gonna talk a little bit about that in a second

[10:11] But once the game is shown all the sudden Brian Eddie and stranger things if I just told you Brian Eddie was making stranger things

[10:19] With this amazing projector and it's gonna do all these things and all we had was like a teaser video

[10:24] You might still think the game is great and you might have high hopes for it

[10:28] It's not great by the way spoiler alert. It's good. It's not great

[10:32] But you know what I'm saying is long as spooky delays showing the game

[10:36] Everyone is using their imagination and already already

[10:41] attributing

[10:42] Nothing but positivity to this game now

[10:46] What will happen when they finally show the game? What do you think is gonna happen?

[10:50] Do you think once they show it a lot of the luster is gonna wear off and people are gonna see

[10:56] It's just another pinball machine with some neat things and some funny callouts

[11:01] But other than that

[11:03] Are you expecting to see a lot of radically amazing stuff happening on the play field?

[11:10] Do you think the pop bumper as a sling is gonna work or is it gonna create chaos?

[11:16] For game you know for for pinball players. There's a lot of question marks

[11:21] It's very cool. You know when you hear Scott talk about the game

[11:25] But there's no denying the fact that this isn't a game jam packed with toys

[11:31] This isn't a game in which you're gonna see a lot of wow

[11:35] happening to the ball

[11:38] But I do think when you've seen Scott's other games and you know other game singular

[11:45] He's able to create an environment and an atmosphere with his games. That's that's awesome

[11:50] That even though it's not as much going on on the play field

[11:54] You know TNA didn't have much at all

[11:56] But with the music and the lights and the energy and the vibe he creates with his games

[12:02] It pulled people in

[12:04] But here's the other thing that again keeps it's like this little devil on my shoulder poking me with a pitch fork

[12:11] When you listen to Scott talk about this game

[12:14] He keeps saying over and over again. It is also a very

[12:19] Challenging game

[12:21] It's a tough game

[12:23] TNA is very tough for a lot of people. It's not very easy not a lot of guys are going through eight reactors

[12:30] But Rick and Morty is different you it's it's a you know a cartoon by nature is very

[12:37] Approachable and if you watch Rick and Morty you get a lot of fun in like 22 minutes of a single episode and I know people are going to want to see

[12:46] You know how many of Morty's adventures they can go on

[12:49] But is it going to be brutally hard to go on a lot of adventures?

[12:53] Are people going to have really short ball times in this game which for many of you out there?

[12:59] But short ball times might be frustrating for you

[13:03] Because you know when you listen to people talk about TNA they always say this

[13:07] It's a great game when you have four players because it's brutally fast and hard and it's the perfect game for

[13:14] For high skill level players because you don't have to sit there and wait a long time and watch your friends complete a ball

[13:20] But for those of you out there who aren't that good at pinball who don't have a lot of pinball friends coming over

[13:27] And you want a game that you can get into and get deep into the game

[13:32] Will this game satisfy you?

[13:34] I think that's got to be something that's on a lot of people's minds and

[13:38] I'm curious is just how this game's gonna play it like you know

[13:42] We see stranger things and we pick it apart. We say that it's like another fan layout

[13:46] We say that it's like cookie cutter

[13:49] We say that like while the shots are like re like rewarding and fun to shoot. There's nothing innovative

[13:54] There's nothing you know in terms of like new design

[13:57] But there's a reason why

[13:59] Stern rinses and repeats that formula. There's a reason why

[14:03] Stern makes games like Elvira with you know traditional layouts and wide open playfields

[14:09] And it's easy to hit every shot. There's a reason why Stern does that

[14:14] Because Stern wants to make the games

[14:17] Immediately approachable and immediately fun for people who hop on not immediately

[14:23] Fustrating and there are a lot of people who have played TNA that I've spoken to you who are more frustrated

[14:29] By the experience than then they are having fun

[14:32] Now Scott's a good player and Scott also likes very challenging games and I know that challenging

[14:40] Can always be corrected in the code if if something's too hard like you could do that like look what they did with ghost busters

[14:47] But here is the thing you know

[14:50] I'm curious if it's gonna be also very challenging to shoot and to and to progress through the game with the kinds of shots that are gonna be required

[14:59] To go on all those Morty adventures

[15:02] So I'm wondering how that's gonna all pan out. I mean that's what I've been thinking about over the last few weeks because we've been in a little bit of a law

[15:09] And at some point at some point they just need to pull the curtain off this game and let people see what Rick and Morty is

[15:17] Where they're at with code and how the game plays and I've heard from some people that have played it

[15:24] I have I heard from I won't say their names

[15:27] But I've heard a few

[15:29] Mixed things about the white wood that some people jumped on and a lot of it had to do with the pop bumper and how that works in the game now

[15:37] When you listen to Scott he loves it

[15:40] I mean he's also the designer of the game

[15:42] Of course he's gonna appreciate it because he finds it really satisfying and maybe he loves that chaos that ensues with that pop bumper

[15:51] Is it going to be for everybody time will tell now?

[15:56] I hope that time is sooner than later, but again because we all bought it. There's no rush. All right now speaking of

[16:03] Speaking of like you know giving our impressions on games and and talking about a game and giving reviews of games

[16:10] You know there's been a new development that this week in pinball has done that I thought is really smart and

[16:18] Jeff over there

[16:19] He's invited people to give their

[16:23] Thor their reviews or their early impressions of a pinball machine when it's first shown to the world

[16:31] So this is not a review by people who have played the game

[16:36] It's more of a combination of some people who have played it other people who might have seen

[16:42] Streams of the game and just your first impressions of the of the pinball machine

[16:48] He's calling it first takes and he did one with stranger things premium and and when I when I gave my feedback on stranger things premium

[16:58] Where did I land right I told you?

[17:01] It looks like it's a fun game to shoot the projector looks neat

[17:05] I don't think the projector is a problem, but there's just nothing about the game that really wowes me

[17:11] And I don't think the projector adds anything to the physical gameplay experience of the game

[17:18] And I think they played it really safe and I said it's a game that's fun to play

[17:23] It's a game that will pull you into the stranger things world because of the music

[17:28] I feel like but I feel like it's a little bit of a mediocre experience overall and I feel like when you play the game

[17:38] You don't really know what your purpose is you don't really know what character you are

[17:43] It's a little bit of a rudderless stranger things experience to me and I said it's fun

[17:48] You're definitely gonna want to play it, but there's nothing about stranger things that makes me want to own it

[17:54] I don't put it up there as like an instant hit like Jurassic Park would be right like even like I think Elvira is even more of an instant hit

[18:03] Now I want to read to you the scores that these reviewers gave the game

[18:07] I'm not gonna read all of their comments which he he also shares the comments when it comes to game design and layout

[18:15] People scored the game a seven at a ten when it comes to artwork

[18:20] People scored it a six out of ten when it comes to current rules

[18:25] People scored it a five point seven out of ten when it comes to displays and animations a seven out of ten

[18:34] Toys and gimmicks a six point six out of ten

[18:38] theme and theme integration six point six out of ten the light show a six point nine out of ten the music a seven point six out of ten

[18:48] Call out a five point five out of ten for an overall score of

[18:55] Six point five out of ten and I kind of agree with that and let me read the overall feedback that people gave this game reviewer number four

[19:05] Anonymous reviewer number four said overall it is a familiar layout that has the potential

[19:11] Of been something great, but with such a familiar layout the code projector and

[19:17] Theme integration is going to be the maker break point of this pinball machine reviewer 65 says I guess I would just simply say it's okay

[19:28] I'll play it on location, but from what I've seen it isn't something I would consider purchasing

[19:34] Given the talent of Brian Eddie and the team he had to work with I was hoping for something more special now

[19:41] That sounds a lot like something I would say I am not reviewer number 65 people

[19:48] Reviewer number 44 said Brian Eddie has been

[19:51] Thrusted back into a different era of pinball that requires wowing with less

[19:57] Effective designers have avoided budget pitfalls with alternative shot layouts and creative use of the space

[20:04] They are afforded Brian will have to change his design focus if he will add to his incredible legacy using modern games

[20:13] This is fun, but not next level incredible

[20:17] You know that's a really smart point and I love this reviewers assessment of it all

[20:24] If you look at what Keith L. Wynn did with Jurassic Park

[20:29] Keith L. Wynn, you know, he really found creative new ways to work with his budget to still put so much

[20:37] uniqueness creativity and even like a fun Mac like I still think the T-Rex is way cooler than the demigorgan

[20:46] Plastic arti choke, you know what that you shoot way cooler

[20:51] You know Eddie put the money into the projector and it just doesn't really

[20:56] Feel like it's working there needed to be more in the game and lastly reviewer 125 said overall

[21:02] This looks like a great game that will get dialed in with code updates and tweaks to the game the issues with the demigorgan

[21:08] Stuckballs and rejections will have to be addressed somehow if that happens the game is solid all right

[21:15] So I think you know a lot of people are in the middle of the road with this game

[21:19] And that's where I've been now. I don't know about you, but let's let's listen or the show

[21:25] Let's be honest doesn't it feel like stranger things hype has come in gone and is like dead like I just feel like it's completely dead now

[21:34] Nobody it's just it's amazing the window by which we retain excitement in this hobby and once we see something

[21:42] We know we don't need to buy our

[21:46] Enthusiasm for it evaporates in a matter of weeks if not days like enthusiasm for this game

[21:54] It's like it's gone

[21:56] You know and I saw a guy this is funny I saw a guy who's sort of like encapsulates

[22:01] You know what everything is wrong with like modern pinball buyers this guy is like I'm not really feeling the game

[22:08] I think I might be rolling the dice

[22:09] But I just had to send a check for $9,000 to my distributor and we'll see what the game becomes

[22:16] You know and then rare hero

[22:18] Responded to him and I love that he's like dude

[22:20] He's like you're all that's wrong in this hobby like you're not even excited by this game

[22:25] And you just cut a check for $9,000 for it like isn't $9,000 like shouldn't we be cutting checks for nine grand when we know

[22:34] It's something that excites us that we want to have it right and then oh no think about Rick and Morty now

[22:39] People are like can tip a $9,000 our game. They don't even know if they're gonna like it if it's any good right

[22:47] Rick and Morty sales it made hypocrites of all of us it made hypocrites of myself

[22:52] We all kind of had to go in because if you didn't you were locked out and they played it right they showed

[22:59] I mean Chuck showed everybody you don't even need to play a game to make money on a game

[23:05] That's incredible that you can you know and Stern's been doing that for a really long time

[23:10] I mean Stern's been selling out of

[23:12] Certain Ellie models before people even saw a single image of the game

[23:17] So I'm not surprised that you know Chuck found it you know found the the secret sauce

[23:23] You pick a theme people love that has a powerful fan base

[23:28] You you know give enough of that theme in the game and you limit the number of games you're gonna make and that equal

[23:35] Sold out sold out in four hours all right now look do I think stranger things can have a second life isn't it crazy

[23:43] It's like it's not even the end of January and we're already talking about Ken stranger things recapture some sort of glory

[23:50] And I think the answer I'm gonna be honest. I think the answer is no

[23:54] I think this game goes down as another like guardians of the galaxy game

[23:59] We're like like nine months from now. You're gonna hear people say oh yeah

[24:03] Remember Jimmy stranger things while they you know codes finally at 1.0 now and it's actually a pretty decent game

[24:10] And eight nine months from now known gives a crap and people are selling stranger things

[24:15] Ellie's used for like 7500 bucks and premiums are going for like

[24:20] 6500 6200 I mean we're headed there people the prices of these games if the games don't

[24:28] have great

[24:30] accolades or great reviews

[24:33] The prices of these games are gonna keep going down and down and down and there's just like even as great as like Jurassic Park is

[24:39] Like you you could still probably go find a Jurassic Park Ellie new in box

[24:44] We we are now in a new period in which we know there's just so much coming

[24:50] Guns and roses toy story, you know deep root

[24:54] CG sees next game hot wheels, you know American pinball. I mean they're not stopping

[24:59] American pinball is working hard on their next game and look

[25:03] I hope American pinball finally has like a decent game because they throw a lot in it now if this game come if hot wheels comes out

[25:11] And it doesn't like a have an incredible art package doesn't have like the most insane

[25:17] Playfield ramps and loop de loops and jumps. I mean it needs to really

[25:22] Really have some wow stuff going on in hot wheels

[25:26] To break through because as a theme

[25:29] It's starting out again. Once again American pinball blows me away

[25:34] I would say that where October fest didn't start with two strikes

[25:39] October fest started with three strikes that theme was dead on arrival

[25:45] Houdini I would say you're starting with two strikes now is hot wheels

[25:50] Starting with two strikes and I'm gonna say this I think it is as much as people are like hot wheels

[25:57] I just I it's not a it's not a theme pinball buyers need to have

[26:03] It's not a theme we hear people talk about it's not like I would have argued even like six months ago four months ago

[26:09] If you told me Rick and Morty is a game that's gonna sell out in four hours

[26:14] I might have told you you're crazy. I didn't realize there's that level

[26:20] Of enthusiasm for it, but here's the difference between Rick and Morty and hot wheels

[26:24] It's real simple adults are into Rick and Morty

[26:29] Adults watch Rick and Morty and here's the final part Rick and Morty is four adults and guess who buys

[26:38] Pimball machines adults now. I know that hot wheels has adult collectors out there

[26:44] But the majority of people who engage with hot wheels on a weekly basis are children and children

[26:52] Don't buy pinball machines, okay?

[26:54] So will that theme cross over into pinball buying?

[26:59] I don't think it's going to as well as they think but if they launch a game with insane

[27:06] Magic in it and crazy it needs to be crazy

[27:08] It needs to be crazy. I mean I expect you know need you need things jump in you need to

[27:14] Things loop to looping you need speed you need a game. That's just like just so freaking fun to flip and then you need artwork

[27:22] That is great and you need animations that don't look like clip art from windows 96, okay?

[27:29] We need we need all that stuff in there, all right, but this is also remember hot wheels is not the final game that American pinball is working on

[27:36] They're working on other games as well

[27:40] So it's a it's a great time

[27:42] We say this like it's a great time to sit back and like see what these people do

[27:46] I mean in mid-March

[27:48] We're gonna see what deep root is all about

[27:50] And I hope they show us more than just raza

[27:54] You know can raza recapture some hype. I still think this. I'm gonna tell you this

[27:59] I still think I still think raza is Robert's sandbag game. I do I think he knows what's coming

[28:07] I think they're working on stuff that blows raza away

[28:10] I think raza was made to just make all the the zidware customers whole again get that damn

[28:18] Negative story off of their plate and start afresh with other games because remember all those other designers are working on things

[28:25] Jay pop included and I think raza is just like you know the end of an old chapter

[28:32] I don't think raza is the beginning the true beginning of the chapter that deep root wants to create

[28:40] I think it's gonna be you know when you see here's the thing to go look again because I think people forget this go look again

[28:47] At Rick and Morty and say you can option Rick and Morty to eight nine thousand dollars now go look at everything that's in raza and

[28:55] And it's it's kind of

[28:58] Inverishing on some level the amount more

[29:03] That is in raza and yet the excitement for Rick and Morty is a thousand times greater

[29:10] And I think it goes to show something

[29:11] Theme is everything. It's just it's just theme is everything

[29:15] raza doesn't do anything for people now if

[29:18] Razah with all that stuff and it was themed as Rick and Morty and all those toys were Rick and Morty themed toys with portals and garages and houses and

[29:27] Spaceships and all you know all the molds that are gonna be in the game

[29:32] Yeah, then you get the excitement level. There's just something about

[29:37] How do you get excited for retro atomic zombie adventure land? How how is it gonna pull you in?

[29:44] Is it gonna be similar to dialed in like dialed in's jam packed dialed in?

[29:49] It's got one of the most amazing animations in any game ever dialed in

[29:54] You could argue is the best bang for the fucking pinball history with everything you get and yet dialed in

[30:00] Does absolutely nothing for most pinball players? It's a sterile?

[30:06] Experience it just doesn't have personality

[30:09] It leaves you just like wanting it to be more than it actually is and

[30:15] That's the problem is Rick and Morty when you're playing as Morty and Rick is cursing you out

[30:23] It's gonna I think it's gonna win people over even if it doesn't have as much physical stuff in the game and

[30:29] And personality it's like it's like women and and your partner in life, right?

[30:36] Personality goes a really long way you want to end up with someone who's got an incredible personality

[30:42] It means more than how they look

[30:44] Because personality is something that is magnetic that pulls you in looks come and go right but personality

[30:52] You know last a lifetime and I think that's that's somewhat true of pinball

[30:56] You know look how beautiful magic girl was but the game at night it didn't work

[31:00] So you couldn't own it you couldn't keep it even if it was sexy right all right. What else is going on?

[31:05] Where we have people

[31:07] Where we at oh, we're not gonna talk about the other stuff going on that everyone's like oh

[31:13] You know pinball is not the platform to start talking about

[31:18] Social issues and all these other issues. It's we should have those conversations in the right way and in the right

[31:26] Environments but man, we're here to talk about pinball, you know life is short life is stressful life is filled with anxiety

[31:34] You don't want to listen to a pinball podcast and be like oh crap, you know

[31:38] And I apologize if some of the shows go in that direction, but we're back

[31:42] We're back in the saddle. We're gonna keep doing this we're gonna keep giving you the pinball news

[31:46] So we didn't talk about

[31:49] Christopher franchise

[31:51] Jaws translate now I feel like we're at the point now

[31:57] Where Christopher francey could whip up a

[32:00] pinball translate in a matter of

[32:03] Hours maybe a day or two and set everyone's expectations on fire because you know once you see it in

[32:12] Pinball form it somehow starts to feel real

[32:16] Right, it's like when Jack danger mocks up those cabinets and shows people hey, what do you think of this?

[32:21] What do you think of that and at first you're like oh my god like Pokemon?

[32:25] Looks awesome. Oh my god masters of the universe looks incredible. Oh my god like you know these these things are they

[32:31] Excite us because it's like it's like we're so close. We're right there and imagine there could be a world under glass

[32:39] Inside that cabinet of a theme that we really love and it's exciting now

[32:44] Do I think there's gonna be a Jaws pinball? Absolutely not do I think this does anything other than sell artwork at shows for my friend mr.

[32:52] Franchie no and I think it's cool

[32:55] It's cool to hang some of this stuff on the wall. I think you know the Superman stuff was really neat the Wonder Woman

[33:00] I mean, but they're not real

[33:02] they these are

[33:04] Things that might have been potential games

[33:08] Because people forget that you know Chris franchie, you know, he works for Joe Kamikaw and

[33:15] Joe Kamikaw is a very very smart man a very successful man a man with a lot of connections in the entertainment industry

[33:22] And I feel like if there's anyone who can ink a deal for a property. It's Kamikaw and that's why

[33:28] The rumors of Harry Potter are are through Joe

[33:32] Kamikaw acquiring that to make the pinball game, you know, he's calling up from Zingha and he's got clout and

[33:41] They've made a lot of people a lot of money and you know, they they've marked they make more money than Stern

[33:46] I mean they're publicly traded company so I just think that these things are fun to see

[33:53] I just wouldn't get your hopes up the other thing about Jaws is it's a Steven Spielberg movie

[33:58] So the odds of Spielberg giving them any rights to any of his footage is like slim to none

[34:03] Now that being said I just would like cut off an arm to get a fifth element pinball machine

[34:08] I would cut off a leg to get G1 Transformers. I would cut off an ear to get he man masters of the universe

[34:15] There's so many eighties

[34:17] Things I grew up with that are just iconic that could get the pinball treatment. I don't want

[34:24] Elvira I don't I don't want

[34:27] Monsters I don't want

[34:31] You know Led Zeppelin. I don't I don't want what Gary wants

[34:35] I don't I don't want what old man Gary wants to make a pinball machine based on I don't I want stuff that's from the eighties and

[34:43] Nineties and I and I want it now

[34:46] You know Ninja Turtles is an interesting one because it's like a theme that some people really love

[34:52] It's a theme that

[34:54] Everyone knows about it's a theme we grew up with but if I'm gonna be honest again

[34:58] I I seen into Turtles a lot like hot wheels in which you should you you

[35:05] Graduate out of your love for Ninja Turtles a little bit at least I think most grown adults do

[35:11] It's not something that you still play around with or think about or watch the cartoons on do you

[35:18] Unless your name is Jared and you work at Stern and you wear Ninja Turtles like box or shorts and you know

[35:25] Sleep in an Ninja Turtles bed. You're not thinking about Ninja Turtles as a grown adult and I'm just wondering

[35:33] Because I hear a lot of people say that Ninja Turtles is also a theme that they just does nothing for them

[35:38] And then I hear some people say it's a it's a it's a dream theme

[35:41] I think it to me. I think Ninja Turtles is gonna fall in the little bit of like

[35:47] It's not a dream theme, but if it's like incredible then I'll consider it and the art package is gonna be phenomenal

[35:53] But I'm saying I'm saying this now too. I'm already hearing from some of my people that have seen it

[36:00] They're starting to backtrack a little bit. I think they're I think they're be asking me

[36:05] I think they might have heard

[36:07] That stranger things might not be like flying off the shelves as much as Stern might want it to and

[36:13] Stern can't like the fact that I'm telling people wait for Ninja Turtles

[36:17] Stern can't like the fact that Ninja Turtles artistically is gonna blow this you know stranger things away

[36:24] Stern can't like the fact that I'm telling people that

[36:27] You know when you put the two next to each other it's just gonna be embarrassing

[36:31] How much cooler stuff is in Ninja Turtles?

[36:33] They're just they don't want they don't want to hear that and yet

[36:37] You heard it here and and I think that's going to be the case and you know

[36:41] Like distributors don't want you to hear that bye-bye. Bye. What's available now? That's like that's the

[36:47] The way it goes nowadays all right

[36:49] Let's end this podcast with a little I think I talked about this rumor

[36:54] But if Alien Pimball comes back I'm hearing it doesn't have the screen on the play field now is that is that a is that like a big deal for some of you

[37:03] Is it not does that add a lot to the gameplay? I?

[37:07] Don't know all I know is this it's almost February February February

[37:14] How do you say it Brenda?

[37:17] February it's a weird word I can't enunciate today. It's almost February and

[37:24] Where are the games? Where are all these aliens that people told me were in route to America and

[37:31] I heard they were gonna be at T.P.F

[37:33] Now I'm here and they're not gonna be a T.P.F

[37:35] I don't know I don't you know between this and Lebowski these two games

[37:41] Aren't they starting to lose luster for a lot of people too?

[37:44] You know, I'm seeing Lebowski sales

[37:47] They're really starting to like bottom out around like 14 15 grand and I think what people are realizing with Lebowski

[37:54] Is that the game isn't there?

[37:56] It's a beautiful game. There's a lot in it the code is the problem

[38:01] It really is it's such a simple game if you're good at pinball that

[38:07] Game doesn't really offer you a lot of different ways to play it and

[38:11] Couple that with the fear if anything breaks in this game. I'm screwed. I mean you know what I'm not saying

[38:17] Where are people opening up spare parts?

[38:20] Go go into the Lebowski threads have people been able to buy spare rugmex and bowling alley mex and

[38:27] replacement ramps I have not

[38:30] seen anybody

[38:32] Share their boxes spare parts arriving and I would not want to play that game on a daily basis

[38:40] If I didn't have backups for everything

[38:43] Do you really think that these early achievers who bought a new game because some people have they pay

[38:50] 21,000 and they got one of the new games

[38:52] Do you really think these people are ever gonna get their second game that berries actually gonna make

[38:59] 400 plus of these games at 12 5

[39:03] By the time I mean where's the production?

[39:06] Where is it? Why can't Barry

[39:09] Upload a video or go Facebook live this week next week just show us Barry

[39:15] What production looks like I'm the big Lebowski why haven't we seen anything?

[39:20] Wouldn't that put people's

[39:23] Anxiety to bed a little bit just seeing you know a row of like 20 big Lebowski cabinets

[39:31] You know playfields going into them

[39:33] I

[39:34] Still believe they're just piecing together stuff with the spare parts they had and and I just I don't think they're gonna

[39:41] Have the capital to like order enough parts to finish that run. I really don't I really don't

[39:47] All right ladies and gentlemen anything else going on pirates of the Caribbean code is

[39:51] Getting a wizard mode that no one's gonna be able to get to I always find it funny when these guys like when you get a finish the game

[40:00] I've only I've only had the game for like eight months and I've only gotten through like 40% of it

[40:05] But I'm not happy until you put a wizard mode in that I'll never ever see like I never understand that complaining

[40:11] You know look at look at look at wonka people can't even get past two golden tickets show of hands out there guys

[40:16] How many of you who own willy Wonka

[40:20] Over the last nine to ten months how many of you

[40:24] Have received more than two golden tickets and watch like four people's hands go up

[40:30] They got to make that game easier. That's just stupid

[40:33] You like I keep talking to my friend Derek about it. I'm like it's just like a gluttony for punishment

[40:38] It's like you're he's like you're never gonna see pure imagination ever

[40:43] Like you've seen wonka's office once in nine months

[40:47] They stoop it. It's like the whole game is a wizard mode to get to all those cool

[40:53] Modes in the game you have to be like so good at pinball that it's just it just feels like

[40:59] Unfulfilling to hop on that machine because here's about me. Here's my thing about wonka

[41:04] Besides the assets. I do think those modes are really radical and cool

[41:08] But I don't want to own that game and never see any of it and for a lot of people. That's the case

[41:14] Gotta make it easier. I fully expect at some point

[41:19] Joe Katz is gonna sit down and be like maybe I should just make maybe I should just make the buyers

[41:26] More satisfied than they currently are and just let them see more of what's in this game

[41:32] Anyway, ladies and gentlemen welcome back to Canadian pinball podcast in which we will talk

[41:38] About pinball and nothing other than that none of the stupid drama in the hobby, right?

[41:44] And so you might be wondering why I have not had an interview in a while my software on my computer is broken

[42:12] We'll see Larry. I think Larry should do his own show with crazy levy

[42:24] You know grab a mic and do a podcast and I look forward to it all right everybody have a great day have a great weekend

[42:32] I doubt there's gonna be any news in pinball over the weekend

[42:35] Do me a favor everybody take a big deep breath

[42:39] We're all in this hobby together. We all love pinball

[42:44] Pinball is a toy for enjoyment

[42:47] It's not a thing you want to play or a community you want to go to

[42:52] To run into the same stresses and anxieties and fighting and bickering and division that we find out in the real world

[43:01] That kind of sucks in a lot of ways lately, right?

[43:05] It's a toy now like if we're gonna get divided let's get divided over the projector

[43:09] Let's get divided over the code in willy wonka

[43:12] Let's get divided over the art package in a game

[43:15] Let's get divided in whether or not a spooky machine is worth $9,000 and let's let's let's keep our debates

[43:22] In that realm and all respect each other

[43:25] Respect the hobby and respect the fact that you're listening to the world's number one pinball podcast have a great day everybody

[43:34] Flip sides like Anakin you will sell everything including the mannequin

[43:39] They got a new bitch now you're gonna for an instant hold on. I handle it. Don't stop panicking stay calm
