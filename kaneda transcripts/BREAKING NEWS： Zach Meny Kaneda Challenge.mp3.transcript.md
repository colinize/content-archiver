[00:00] Oh no, Zach Manny just sent me a note saying that my last podcast, if I keep podcasting

[00:12] like that, he said I'm going to be handing the Twippy to somebody else this year.

[00:18] And I said to him, Zach, what are you talking about bro?

[00:20] It shows like that, that put the Twippy in Canadian pocket.

[00:25] And he said my last show was so bad that he had 10 different counterpoints to things I

[00:32] said on that show.

[00:33] And I said, bro, come at me.

[00:35] Let's do a little debate.

[00:36] Tell me what I said that was wrong.

[00:38] You know what he said?

[00:39] He said, nobody.

[00:40] Nobody can beat Zach Manny in a pinball debate.

[00:44] And I said to him, look, you name the time and let's make it happen.

[00:48] So here's the thing.

[00:49] I'm not the one avoiding Zach Manny.

[00:52] Manny is the one who's too chicken to get into the ring with Canada.

[00:57] And he knows that.

[00:58] And we're good friends and we talk all the time and I think Zach is an awesome guy.

[01:02] But I told him, you'll never live it down man.

[01:05] You think Houdini is a great game.

[01:09] That is why you could never beat Canada in a pinball debate.

[01:13] But I know you want to hear it happen.

[01:15] I know you want to hear what Zach's 10 counterpoints are.

[01:18] But my statements that a $15,000 Elvira is a crash-grab disaster.

[01:24] So let's make it happen, people.

[01:26] See, I can't go on pin sign.

[01:28] But you can and you can call Zach into the ring.

[01:31] And I'll do it anytime, any place, anywhere.

[01:34] You know what he said to me?

[01:35] He's like, I got to look at some things and I got to plan some things.

[01:37] That plan, what out, Zach?

[01:40] What?

[01:41] We are grown men who spend way too much time thinking about pinball.

[01:45] You distribute pinballs for a living.

[01:48] We could do it tonight.

[01:49] We could do it tomorrow.

[01:50] You any day, any day Zach, many wants to man up and get in the ring with Canada and debate

[01:57] pinball.

[01:58] We'll make it happen.

[01:59] I'm not going to go, I'll go on your show, Zach.

[02:01] But we ain't going to do it for two hours.

[02:02] I don't do two hours shows.

[02:03] I don't need two hours of Dennis to win Twippies.

[02:06] All right?

[02:07] Well, you can come on my show.

[02:08] You name it.

[02:09] Any ring you want.

[02:10] You name the time.

[02:11] You name the place.

[02:12] I'll put the mic on and let's talk pinball.

[02:14] So let's see what happens.

[02:15] Ladies and gentlemen, now you all know.

[02:16] And I told them I'm going to put up a little teaser about this battle that's going to

[02:20] happen.

[02:21] This pinball battle debate.

[02:23] When's it going to happen?

[02:24] The ball is in Zach Manys Court.

[02:27] This week in pinball podcast, flipping out.

[02:29] So I don't even know what a vote for Zach even goes to straight down the middle.

[02:34] What is it, Zach?

[02:35] Let's get clear.

[02:37] One name.

[02:38] One name you've been dogging and dodging all these years.

[02:41] And it's pronounced Cunada.

[02:43] And we're going to win Twippies for life.

[02:46] Let's do this.

[02:49] People often say that I just rant and I say that I love something but I can sometimes

[02:53] not back it up.

[02:55] Yeah.

[02:56] I'm going to back it up, Greg, with why I enjoy prudini.

[03:01] Out of the box, it has flipper toppers.
