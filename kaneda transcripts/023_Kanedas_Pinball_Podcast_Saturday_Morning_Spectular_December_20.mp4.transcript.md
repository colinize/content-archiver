[00:00] Yeah, Saturday morning.

[00:07] I like that you like me.

[00:10] You got good taste.

[00:12] People I don't even want to do this on Facebook anymore.

[00:15] I'm just going to tell these Facebook people like come on like just come over.

[00:20] Come over to YouTube like it's annoying.

[00:24] Why don't you have YouTube better?

[00:26] Everything's better.

[00:27] The sound's better.

[00:28] I'm tired of whatever will go here for a little bit.

[00:32] But I think if you're on YouTube you should just come over baby.

[00:36] Sounds better.

[00:37] We rocking and rolling.

[00:39] Turn off the moderation.

[00:42] We don't need moderation do we?

[00:45] Moderation activity.

[00:47] Boom.

[00:49] Oh, moderation TV will not be shown.

[00:53] Who's going to show it?

[00:56] Oh, man.

[00:59] What?

[01:00] We're all ready for the holidays.

[01:04] What's up people?

[01:06] What's up?

[01:08] I don't know.

[01:09] Why do I still do this on Facebook?

[01:11] There's no stars anymore.

[01:14] We raised a lot of money last weekend for Brenda's alcohol consumption and she overconsumed.

[01:20] I ruined my machine gun Kelly concert.

[01:23] But fret not.

[01:24] I'm not a man that dwells in the past.

[01:27] I'm a man that finds solutions for the future.

[01:30] So we booked.

[01:31] We booked.

[01:33] A trip to Ireland baby to see him.

[01:37] Dublin baby.

[01:39] I don't know where I want to put this.

[01:43] But like I don't.

[01:46] You know, I just I just I'm tired of looking at two screens.

[01:49] Good morning everybody.

[01:52] Good morning.

[01:54] Welcome to the world's only pinball content creator that does not want to interview George Gomez right now.

[02:01] I just don't.

[02:02] I have no interest in interviewing George Gomez right now.

[02:06] I love George Gomez.

[02:08] I'm not I'm not impressed by any of their recent product.

[02:11] I don't want to talk to you.

[02:13] I don't want to hear about how the sausages made.

[02:15] I don't want to hear about all the challenges you face.

[02:18] It's garbage.

[02:21] It's garbage.

[02:22] The product is not there right now.

[02:23] And they know it.

[02:25] Star Wars is embarrassing.

[02:27] Walking dead is another flop.

[02:29] So like I don't want to talk to retro Django in the house.

[02:35] Dropship baby.

[02:36] Dropship in these games.

[02:42] You guys on Facebook.

[02:44] Why just come over to YouTube, baby.

[02:46] Why don't you come over to YouTube?

[02:49] Come over to YouTube.

[02:51] Sad boy in the house, baby.

[02:53] Always does it.

[02:55] Imagine making a backwards compatible topper that's somehow worse than the original.

[03:01] The company is such an F and joke.

[03:03] Stern will pander to smooth brain normies until the end of time.

[03:10] I'm talking about the walking dead topper.

[03:16] Look.

[03:17] Look.

[03:18] I just, I think it's a, I think the,

[03:23] the picture of where pinball is going in the next couple of years is crystal clear.

[03:31] And you know, Stern's always going to have the volume.

[03:35] The right, the, the, the, the, the product like to inbox ready to go.

[03:42] The problem is this.

[03:44] YouTube is laggy right now.

[03:46] Is, is this laggy guys?

[03:47] Is YouTube lagging for you guys?

[03:53] Let me know, let me know in the chat.

[03:55] Is this lag, it doesn't, it's not lagging for me.

[03:57] Is the lagging for you?

[04:02] YouTube is fine.

[04:04] Everyone says it's fine.

[04:06] I don't know what you're talking about.

[04:08] Dan, come on.

[04:10] Come on.

[04:13] Um, look, at least they got the Star Wars accessories.

[04:18] I, I,

[04:21] so wait a few minutes, but I just want to say like, I, I think the C3PO topper is,

[04:27] is just pretty, pretty trash.

[04:31] You know what I'm saying?

[04:33] Like, hold on, let me, um, let me share screen on, on YouTube and let's look at this thing.

[04:39] Let's watch the video.

[04:42] Of Stern's accessories.

[04:45] YouTube.

[04:46] Stern pinball.

[04:51] I mean,

[04:54] okay, I love.

[04:57] I'm going to show you the accessories trail.

[05:03] Okay, hold on.

[05:05] Let's share screen.

[05:11] Do, do, do.

[05:20] From a galaxy far away to your game.

[05:23] Look at that.

[05:24] The official Star Wars fall of him.

[05:27] I'm so stupid up there.

[05:29] It's just, it's just floating head.

[05:31] Man, the galaxy right from the bottom.

[05:33] Stormtrooper themed shooter.

[05:35] These shooter.

[05:36] And they couldn't even get the head.

[05:37] Look at that.

[05:38] Okay, Stern.

[05:39] You're filming this video, right?

[05:41] Is that, is that really, is that really the position that the stormtroopers head should

[05:48] get?

[05:49] Look at this.

[05:53] Wipe your off your camera lens.

[05:58] Hold on.

[06:02] Let me, let me do this.

[06:09] Is that better?

[06:11] Is that better people?

[06:19] Kind of dark in here now.

[06:21] Little light.

[06:22] I can't read now.

[06:23] Hold on.

[06:24] Got to increase the, the brightness.

[06:29] There we go.

[06:31] All right.

[06:32] Okay.

[06:35] Okay, so.

[06:37] Look at this gang.

[06:39] Like.

[06:43] Like, here's what I don't get.

[06:45] Like, it's not even centered.

[06:46] It's off to the side.

[06:47] And, you know, this is your marketing material.

[06:50] Like, they, like, I'm just tired of little pez head dispensers being shooter rides.

[06:55] All right.

[06:56] So, let's, let's keep going here.

[06:57] No, I've completed the look of you.

[07:00] Name.

[07:01] Name.

[07:02] Name.

[07:03] Name.

[07:04] Name.

[07:05] Name.

[07:06] Name.

[07:07] Name.

[07:08] Name.

[07:09] Name.

[07:10] Name.

[07:11] Name.

[07:13] For the premium edition, get immersed into the world of star war with the cabinet expression lighting accessory.

[07:20] With 96 intelligent RGB LEDs, the cabinet expression lighting system enables full color spectrum control.

[07:28] Positioned in pockets cut into the cabinet sides to provide color themed, full play field illumination.

[07:34] This integrated play field lighting system is so good to custom light shows and is dynamically responsive to game events.

[07:41] While featuring exclusive Battle of Hoth Handron artwork.

[07:46] For the Pro Edition, extend the Battle of Hoth theme

[07:49] Beyond the Playfield with the Star Wars fall of the Empire

[07:52] Inside Artplates.

[07:53] Like seriously.

[07:54] These stunning artplates feature Handron artwork depicting the iconic

[07:59] Battle of Hoth scene from the Empire Strikes Back.

[08:03] Protect your game with the Tie Fighter side armor.

[08:06] This dramatic side armor features laser cut tie fighters

[08:09] backed with reflective foil to enhance the look of your game.

[08:14] Okay.

[08:15] I mean, seriously.

[08:18] Seriously, this is a...

[08:21] What is this?

[08:24] Like, I just...

[08:27] I just don't even understand what happened, man.

[08:31] This is a company that used to make an effort.

[08:35] And this is just so lazy.

[08:39] Like, and I don't even like that this is Stern's new side armor strategy.

[08:43] It's just cheap.

[08:46] You know, instead of making like dynamic armor like Batman, right?

[08:50] That look like the Bat will be ill.

[08:52] Instead of making armor that reflects the theme.

[08:55] See, the reason why this is just so cheap.

[08:58] It means they can just take black armor and either laser cut tie fighters

[09:04] or walking deadheads or whatever the theme...

[09:07] Like, it's just looks so cheap.

[09:11] I know I'm nitpicking here, but man, it's like, what is...

[09:16] Like, what's going on at Stern?

[09:19] Like, what is happening?

[09:22] I wouldn't mind this stuff if the games were much cheaper.

[09:28] But look, they're expensive.

[09:32] Let's keep going.

[09:34] Get this topper.

[09:36] I think these are what these are called.

[09:40] I don't care about these.

[09:44] With intelligent RGB LED lighting,

[09:47] your speakers will light up and flash as you explore the character.

[09:51] And it's fully integrated and dynamically responsive to game events.

[09:55] To game events.

[09:57] Upgrade your gaming experience to see 3PO inspired armor.

[10:01] And you're glad to make your acquaintance.

[10:04] This animatronic topper features C3PO with exclusive animations, callouts.

[10:09] My type suggests using the Force, my friend.

[10:12] And RGB lights that react to your game play.

[10:15] What's behind them?

[10:16] This topper is compatible with Star Wars walls and higher.

[10:19] And the 2017 Star Wars game.

[10:22] It was so bad.

[10:23] It's like they ran, they didn't have enough to get Star Wars followers fall of the Empire.

[10:26] We'll have access.

[10:27] Like, what is it?

[10:29] Can someone answer me this?

[10:31] Like, what is C3PO in front of right here?

[10:34] What is that?

[10:36] Are those just like those look like Imperial?

[10:43] I don't know, panels.

[10:44] I don't what that looks like Darth Vader's chest or something.

[10:48] What is that?

[10:50] It's a control panel for the escape pods from the films.

[10:58] But why would he be floating in front of that?

[11:06] But I don't understand.

[11:07] Like, why would you have C3PO in front of that?

[11:18] It's supposed to be panels from that little room they're trapped in on the Death Star.

[11:25] It's just, but gang, like, my point is this.

[11:28] And why they put the Stern logo on the lights?

[11:31] You see that?

[11:32] Look at the light bar.

[11:33] Why did they put the Stern logo on that?

[11:36] Like, it's so tacky.

[11:45] You know, I just, I don't really understand this stuff.

[11:50] Like, who is making the decisions over there?

[11:53] Like, let's put a logo on the light strip.

[11:57] And look at the light, the light strips look so bad.

[12:00] Like, why do you want to see these LED lights?

[12:03] Just like, they don't, Stern just doesn't get it.

[12:12] I don't like any like, tick-tack-looking light strips like this.

[12:17] Like, they should be encased in something that doesn't make you feel like,

[12:22] you're seeing the tick-tacks of the LED panels.

[12:29] I mean, keep going.

[12:36] To software experience, in Star Wars Fall of the Empire, the Escape Best Challenge Mode.

[12:42] Well, this is the last time I'm visiting Best Men.

[12:45] May the Force be with you and your Star Wars Fall of the Empire Pim on the Sheen today.

[12:50] At SternPinball.com.

[13:00] The fact that they're like still branding, Psych 3, as like a, you know, a thing.

[13:07] Psych 3, baby.

[13:09] Nobody cares.

[13:11] Ah, nobody cares.

[13:18] Look, we all know, we all know Stern's next game needs to be like, wow.

[13:28] Like, right?

[13:29] Like, Pokemon needs to be, boom.

[13:32] And I'm hearing it's not.

[13:34] I'm just hearing it's not.

[13:37] You know, so you better get your Dune orders in by December 31st,

[13:40] or it's your last chance to get Dune new inbox.

[13:43] Let's talk about that.

[13:47] What do you guys think, man?

[13:49] Did anyone order Dune this week after that announcement?

[13:52] I'm just curious.

[13:53] Let me just ask you guys.

[13:54] Anybody out here, both on Facebook or YouTube, has anybody ordered Dune after they said,

[13:59] no more after December 31st orders?

[14:08] Anybody?

[14:10] No, no.

[14:12] Anyone?

[14:13] Come on.

[14:14] Somebody ordered it.

[14:15] Somebody felt victim to that.

[14:18] My Dune arrived this week.

[14:22] Somebody, anybody, Buler, Buler?

[14:25] I ordered a pizza.

[14:27] Said, Franci.

[14:30] You know, it's crazy when, as I see now, that even Josle is now lost $1,000.

[14:38] You know, I'm very worried about.

[14:41] I'm any western watches, whatever it's been about that I feel great today,

[14:46] definitely going into there with commitment to justice.

[14:49] Who even was on YouTube and then committed suicide,

[14:55] scandal and individuals, terroristBlade,

[14:56] who leave hard- kuin 저도 and partly we can't trust their family and organizations.

[15:06] Who?

[15:07] What did you have just discovered that you didn't,

[15:10] There's just too many games out there.

[15:12] There's just too many games out there.

[15:15] We don't need a new expensive game every four months now.

[15:21] It's at the point now where everyone is just

[15:24] inundated with so many good games that you just can't

[15:29] have eight new Pim-Mong machines a year, just keep dropping.

[15:32] These are not video games at 80 bucks.

[15:37] And so now it's like, I think everyone's going to just be pretty,

[15:42] again, like the only way out is if they keep bringing newbies

[15:45] into the hobby that are willing to buy like every new thing

[15:48] that comes out.

[15:53] Let's talk about it.

[15:56] Look, I think that, did you guys think I was too harsh?

[16:02] I'm barrels of fun.

[16:03] I always feel like they tell me I'm too harsh on them.

[16:08] I guess the part I'm still confused about is how they said they were

[16:12] expanding their manufacturing capabilities and they were going to be ready

[16:17] to do two lines.

[16:19] And now that's not the case.

[16:24] Look, gang, I'm harsh on Dune, not as a game.

[16:30] I am just harsh on Dune as being a theme that the community didn't want.

[16:36] And I think this is sometimes hard for people to separate those two things.

[16:42] It's like that, if they got the title of something that we want it more,

[16:49] David would have sold all thousand pretty much right away.

[16:54] And that's it.

[16:59] That's it.

[17:00] I think that people just didn't want the theme.

[17:09] I love the new games.

[17:11] I have four.

[17:11] It makes no sense to sell one of my games to lose again.

[17:14] Anthony, you're right.

[17:15] Dude, look, I just think this, but no, that makes no sense.

[17:21] Nobody wanted Winchester, but it sold out instantly.

[17:25] Brother, they absolutely wanted it.

[17:27] That's why it sold out instantly.

[17:30] You know, I absolutely that they people wanted a haunted house game that was a

[17:35] world under glass and they got it and it sold out.

[17:37] So you can't say nobody wanted it.

[17:40] It wasn't on anyone's radar.

[17:41] Sure.

[17:44] But people wanted it.

[17:47] No one, no.

[17:49] OK, so nobody asked for it is different than no one wants a haunted house theme

[17:55] pinball machine.

[17:58] It's not about the theme.

[18:02] It's about the launch.

[18:03] Dune had a bad launch.

[18:05] Now it has sold.

[18:10] Well, whose fault is that?

[18:11] Let me ask you guys that question.

[18:13] Whose fault is the bad Dune launch on?

[18:18] Why did it have a bad launch?

[18:26] Why did it have a bad launch?

[18:29] Why would you work on something for so long and then you control the launch?

[18:34] Why did you launch it poorly?

[18:37] There is no excuse for a game having a poor launch when the manufacturer can control

[18:44] that launch.

[18:45] See that the real secret game, the real reality is blame bad launch on like it wasn't licensing

[18:53] gang.

[18:55] The thing is this.

[18:59] I did not hear from David after my last show.

[19:01] The thing is, I think these companies, whenever they do things poorly or like launch prematurely,

[19:07] it's all one and one.

[19:09] It's all one thing only.

[19:12] It's all one thing only.

[19:13] It's all a cash flow issue.

[19:18] They can't admit it.

[19:20] There would be no reason to do it unless you needed the cash.

[19:26] There's no reason.

[19:27] If you're a cash flush and you don't need to rush out a game and you have more time to

[19:35] bake it and more time to do the code and more time to get the launch where you want to.

[19:41] But also not launch it on top of everything else.

[19:44] They were worried about, remember, you guys need to remember this.

[19:46] They were worried about Harry Potter and they were worried about King Kong.

[19:51] They should have let those two games come out because then there was that nice window

[19:56] where nothing was out and they should have launched then.

[20:03] Gang.

[20:04] Anyway, look.

[20:08] I just think Winchester is now the focus of the organization and the next game.

[20:15] Okay, let's ask this question.

[20:17] Do you think the game after Winchester is never ending story?

[20:22] Do you guys want a never ending story, Pimbal Machine?

[20:31] Anyone want never ending story?

[20:37] Someone, someone has to want it.

[20:44] See, like this is, oh man, nobody wants never ending story.

[20:57] One guy, they're selling one.

[21:01] Yeah, look, I don't think people want never ending story.

[21:06] Doonies is different.

[21:08] Gremlins is different.

[21:15] Tux wants one.

[21:17] Yeah, I mean, we definitely need a, well, look, a cure would be amazing.

[21:30] These companies, you know, easy, you know how fast 500 a cure Pimbal machines would sell.

[21:36] Like legit, if you put Neo Tokyo under glass and got the Akira license and the movie and

[21:42] the soundtrack and the Akira would sell like no tomorrow, man.

[21:50] Again, but don't take my word for it.

[21:52] What do I know?

[21:53] Let's make never ending story.

[22:00] David Vennes, Veggie, Mike, Pimbal.

[22:07] Well, you know, Beavis and Budhead, Stern, they, Stern passed on making it.

[22:18] Now you guys are like, add to your mind.

[22:21] You have no idea, you have no idea, Akira would sell 10 units.

[22:24] You think Akira would be a slow seller?

[22:32] You guys don't get it.

[22:33] You don't get it.

[22:35] Somebody, somebody, somebody make it and test my hypothesis.

[22:40] Anyway, I'm, I wanted to say this gang like I am so happy for each and every one of us.

[22:49] I am so psyched for the Pimbal community because it is a buyer's market.

[22:54] It is a buyer's market like there has never been a buyer's market in Pimbal.

[22:58] The prices are crashing back down, gang.

[23:02] Crashing back down.

[23:03] Remember when like, Monsters, Ellie was going for like 16, 17,000 during COVID.

[23:07] The guys got one like 9,000 crashing down.

[23:12] Jaws Ellie, 12 with no plays on it, crashing down.

[23:20] It's, it's going to be so funny to watch what happens.

[23:24] And again, I think stuff like, you know, Harry Potter is going to be the new benchmark for

[23:29] a lot of people's collections.

[23:32] Potter shoots amazingly well.

[23:34] It's freaking Harry Potter and it's a work of art.

[23:37] You know, when you walk into someone's house and you see Potter, Pimbal and then you walk

[23:40] over and you see star star machines look like, do they look like they cost a third of

[23:44] the price?

[23:46] That's the problem, you know, and now that Potter shoots great and it's just a really

[23:50] rewarding Pimbal shooting experience.

[23:52] How are you going to like have a Harry Potter in your house and then walk over to like the

[23:55] walking dead and be like, yeah, man, these are the same price.

[23:58] How are you going to do it?

[24:06] You know, look, it's so true, man.

[24:08] I remember when COVID hit, hit, remember, like we weren't going out, we weren't eating

[24:12] out, we weren't traveling.

[24:14] I remember basically having like no credit card bill for like months, every paycheck, bank.

[24:23] Now I feel like every time I open up my chase account, it's like $2,000,000, I don't know

[24:30] what I do.

[24:31] I bought a pair of socks, $3,000.

[24:33] You know, had a couple glasses of wine, $800 bucks.

[24:36] Like that's how it is in the world today.

[24:42] Potter's amazing.

[24:43] Potter's amazing.

[24:44] Absolute amazing game.

[24:49] And you know, I, if it wasn't for, is it Kira's music even good?

[24:57] Hold on a second, we're going to do something right now.

[25:00] You guys like really don't get it.

[25:02] You're telling me that this wouldn't be one of the most epic moments in pinball.

[25:09] Oh my God, you guys like don't get it on Facebook.

[25:19] Guys come over to come over to YouTube, man.

[25:28] We're going to watch this.

[25:29] I'm going to make you guys watch this.

[25:32] You tell me as a pinball experience, this wouldn't be amazing.

[25:39] If my goal was to lose my embarrassing, I didn't have a lot of time.

[25:48] I do these two things.

[25:49] First thing.

[25:50] I customized that by myself.

[25:51] Wow, you couldn't handle it.

[25:53] I don't see how you can ride something crazy like that.

[25:56] You can make a music good or Kira music.

[25:58] Listen to this.

[25:59] I could.

[26:00] If you want it so bad, then still want yourself.

[26:07] Imagine you took care of this whole new world in your glass.

[26:20] You have holograms and redness under glass.

[26:50] You could have the light in it.

[26:57] This is how you do it.

[27:04] And the light in it.

[27:09] Come on, please.

[27:12] Hey, guys.

[27:13] Hey, guys.

[27:15] I'm going to throw a coin back in.

[27:17] Get everybody to know that.

[27:18] This is illustrated.

[27:19] Every time I'm illustrated.

[27:21] This is a 90-80 sticks.

[27:26] Every single brain is illustrated.

[27:41] You guys are literally like that.

[27:48] I didn't want the greatest horse in this universe.

[27:55] This looks worse than I thought it would.

[28:00] This is held up as one of the greatest pieces of art worth of all time.

[28:08] This is a great piece of art.

[28:15] I'm going to throw a coin back in.

[28:22] I'm going to throw a coin back in.

[28:29] I'm going to throw a coin back in.

[28:37] This is the first one I bought.

[28:43] There it is.

[28:47] This unit 370.

[28:54] But I can't guarantee you a cure.

[29:01] not gonna happen. Cause you'd rather have burio's barbecue.

[29:13] Ever go to the casino. That's the market for an Akira pin.

[29:22] Anyway, well Blade Runner is just not gonna happen because you can't get

[29:27] Harrison Ford, but I know that like Blade Runner license, I believe Dutch has it.

[29:37] Or Melvin has it. I know that I think I think barrels was trying to get it from them.

[29:45] But you know, the problem is Harrison Ford.

[29:49] The, um, you know, I do think that barrels is probably working on that pinball circus

[29:57] game. And can we talk about spooky pinball has four titles on the line at once.

[30:04] Four. They have four titles on the line at once.

[30:18] Four. I mean, that's, that's impressive.

[30:27] See, French, she gets it. French Mclad you, um, French, she has an artist. See,

[30:31] French, she knows the cultural impact Akira had. And he understands as an artist,

[30:38] what Akira stands for. And they see that French, these guys don't get it. And what's sad is like

[30:43] the amount of you that said, I've never seen it. So go watch it. Go watch it and understand

[30:50] why it has such significant culture. Go watch K-pop demon hunters if you haven't seen it.

[30:55] The amount of like, cramuginery in pinball is amazing to me. It's like, you guys like,

[31:00] like, won't listen to an MGK album. If you hear it's amazing, you won't go watch Akira.

[31:05] You're like, you just want to be stuck. What? Listening to what?

[31:08] As the eyes born every day.

[31:13] You are too harsh on barrels of fun. They're a small new company compared to spooky. Look,

[31:19] gang, I am simply just trying to hold barrels of fun to the things they say.

[31:28] That's it. That's it. When, when, if David says they're expanding to have two lines

[31:38] and then they don't do that, look, I just, let me be candid here. I just want people to do what's

[31:48] smart. Like, rushing do now and having a bad launch wasn't smart. Picking do as a theme versus the

[31:55] stuff Brian Savage's connected to wasn't smart. Taking pre-orders on a topper that's not going to

[32:02] be finished for eight months. That's not smart. Has anyone else done that ever? Like, just,

[32:10] if it's not a cash flow issue, why would you not just finish the topper before you take orders?

[32:19] I guess that's my only thing, gang. It's my only thing.

[32:27] And I'm friends with those guys over at barrels. I want them to be successful.

[32:30] But I just sometimes I'm like, come on, guys. Come on. Just get it together a little bit more, man.

[32:37] I think, look, I'm going to say this right now and I've said this.

[32:43] I've said this before. I would rather have a dune than a star wars.

[32:48] I would rather have a dune than an uncanny X-Men. I'd rather have a dune than a walking dead.

[32:56] I actually, when you stand over the dune with the new Translite, it's a gorgeous machine.

[33:05] It's a gorgeous machine. And it's got the assets. It's got the music from the film. It's got,

[33:13] you know, it's a very beautiful atmospheric game. I've always said that.

[33:19] But what makes me so upset with them, I mean this, they never found a compelling way

[33:30] to introduce the game. They never showed the game in its proper light the way it should have been shown.

[33:40] And that's it. And look, gang, I'm not the first person to say you only get one chance to make

[33:45] a first impression. That's the problem. That phrase is true. And if you know that is, like,

[33:52] rule number one of marketing, you get one chance to make a first impression if you put a bad taste

[33:57] in people's mouth, the odds of winning people over is much harder. So instead of once you flop the

[34:06] launch, now you got like nine months of like, and you couldn't even sell half the allocation.

[34:15] Look, I absolutely, I absolutely think, you know, dune is a great pickup for people.

[34:24] In, you know, I think you'll be able to get one for like, you know, 9,500, 10.

[34:36] The one thing I think barrels needs to work on is that they need to get rid of the skittle,

[34:48] the tic tac lighting system on the sides. I think it completely,

[34:55] like, ruins the atmospheric vibe they're going for with games like, you know what I'm saying?

[35:00] They've got this very beautiful organic world of dune. And then those tic tac expression lights.

[35:10] To me, they really mess up the atmosphere. They feel very foreign and digital. They just feel

[35:24] the opposite of what you want. And I think once they solve that, I know they can. I think Melvin's

[35:29] trying to give David what he has an hour. Because if you look at Alice, the lighting is much more

[35:34] seamless and integrated, beautiful. You see them, man. You see them. Now you see them.

[35:44] You see them. It's an easy fix. It's an easy fix.

[35:49] Tux.

[35:55] Tux. I'd buy a nightmare before Xmas. Yeah. Well, yeah, of course.

[36:04] Zero stars, man. I'm telling you Facebook guys. I'm about to just pull the plug on Facebook.

[36:10] I don't, I don't know, man. I don't know, guys, just come over to YouTube.

[36:16] Come over to YouTube. That's where the party is. I mean, you're only hanging with 20 people. We have

[36:24] 111 on YouTube. We have such a more interesting chat going. We got franchi in the house.

[36:33] Can you please share your back to the future info you're talking about the other day?

[36:36] I don't know if this is true or not. I've got to get some confirmation on it. But what I'm hearing

[36:52] is there will be most likely be we'll see. All this is still up in the air. So don't kill me if

[37:01] it doesn't happen this way. There will most likely be 88 super limited edition games.

[37:09] But there will most likely be 88 for the European market and then 88 SLEs for the US market.

[37:18] And that's it. I think it's a smart move. I think it is a smart move. I think, obviously,

[37:25] they can make a lot more. But having 88 single coin door and 88 double coin door. But we'll see

[37:32] what happens. I mean, none of it is they've got time to figure all that stuff out.

[37:39] I know now I know people that have seen the game. And I think there's what's a joke.

[37:50] Canator sucks at pinball.

[38:05] I'm not bad at pinball gang. I'm not great, but I can play pinball. It's funny to me

[38:12] when people are like, you so get pinball. I mean, come on. I'm at the stage now. I've been playing

[38:17] this damn game for 15 years now. I can get through a game.

[38:37] Well, I think that the manufacturing, let's talk about Dutch.

[38:46] I think what worries everybody and I'm in the same camp as all of you.

[38:52] All I can go off of is the information I know. And I think Barry, what Barry's planning to do

[39:02] is obviously hire more people to amp up production of back to the future. So he's got the DPX

[39:11] building. He's got the DP building. I think right now, Alice's is not the,

[39:21] Alice can't even make, they didn't even make like 350 Alice's in a year. Okay. So like,

[39:30] but that is because he didn't bring on more people.

[39:33] I worry that if they only made 350 Alice's in a year and they're going to finish that run,

[39:45] it's going to take that's going to take them well into like early 2026 and then Raza,

[39:50] because back to the future is not ready. Like, Barry is holding on thanks to Melvin's

[39:57] buffer, if you will. And I just worry about what happens then when you take orders and you get

[40:05] 5,000 orders and you're making 15 games a week at best. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know

[40:13] how, if he's going to get that up, I don't know what the solve is. Other than charge a lot of money

[40:19] to minimize the demand and make high, high margin on the game.

[40:28] 100% people could be waiting years for back to the future. But I think Barry is okay with that.

[40:37] I do. I think in his head, he's okay with just making back to the future for the next five years.

[40:43] And that's it. Personally, I would get a little bored of that. I wouldn't want to only make the

[40:49] same game for five years. I would want to have more creative products in culture and in the market.

[40:57] But you know, what are you going to do? I mean, this is the, he's got this jug or not and it's

[41:05] going to keep the line going forever. Well, customers be okay with giving them 2K and waiting

[41:13] five years. Yeah, because you know why JC? Because customers gave him money for big Lebowski and

[41:19] waited 7 years. So I think they will. Okay, so we got a question here. My invoice for Alice is

[41:29] due. The tariff added in extra 1,000, 1,100 on top of that. I'm on the fence. If it's worth it.

[41:39] I mean, I guess the first question is, do you want to back to the future?

[41:44] Because if you don't want to back to the future, then I think it doesn't make much sense maybe to

[41:53] stay in on your Alice. I think the, the real golden goose is that you get back to the future spots first.

[42:00] In order to make it for five years, you would have to do a great launch. No gang, back to the future is

[42:19] back to the future doesn't need a launch. Back to the future launched when way back in 19,

[42:25] like what, like 85, 86 back to the future launch when the movie came out.

[42:32] It doesn't matter what they do. They're going to, they're going to, they're going to have enough of

[42:38] everything you want. It's going to be, it's going to sell like insanity. It's got, yes, it's got, yes,

[42:46] yes. It has all, it has Michael J. Fox, it has Christopher Lloyd, it has everybody in it.

[42:52] It has everybody in it. They have all the assets. They have everything you need.

[42:57] Michael J. Fox is on board. It's got Francia and artwork. It's a freaking no brainer.

[43:10] Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's stupid. I mean, Francia's seen the game. You can ask him about it.

[43:22] Oh, JC, what are you saying, man? JC is, JC, I use Zach, man. He, look at, look at what he just wrote.

[43:32] They're going to have to work with a very trusted distributor, like flipping out. If they're going to,

[43:36] what are you talking about, bro? What do you mean? Like you think coin takers going to steal people's

[43:42] money or automate it? I've never heard such a silly thing. Like you're going to have to work.

[43:47] Flipping out is not getting any back to the futures. You know, he knows, Zach knows that.

[43:53] He's not getting any, I mean, he can buy them from, he'd have to, he'd have to like buy them from

[43:59] Melissa, but he's not getting any allocated to him from Dutch pinball. So like, they're going to have

[44:07] to work with, like, look, flipping out does a great job with their, with their customers, but he's

[44:12] just not getting the title. And that wasn't my decision. That, that's been the decision of Dutch pinball.

[44:20] Also, like, come on, gang, it's like, the money to save Dutch was invested by Melissa at coin taker.

[44:26] Why, why, why would you need two distributors in America for this product? Why? You don't.

[44:38] Have you tried to get coin taker to answer an email? Let me, let me tell you something right now.

[44:42] Let me tell you something right now. I don't know why it takes him a long time, but I, they pick up the

[44:47] phone every time I call them, they pick up the phone. Why don't you just call them? Okay, they're,

[44:54] they're there every day. Have you called them? Come on, everybody.

[45:02] Melissa answers my calls every time.

[45:15] Yeah, there is no Dutch without coin taker. Let me tell you right now. I think

[45:18] Kenaeeta might have some, Kenaeeta might have some back to the future SLEs for you guys to grab.

[45:23] How about that? How about that? Kenaeeta, come in, baby. Kenaeeta, come in.

[45:33] I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do a little, I'm gonna do a little dealin' guys. I've already said this to you.

[45:38] I'm gonna do a little dealin'. The first five games I'm gonna deal to my club members are known as Beetlejuice.

[45:46] Beetlejuice. What if you're able to buy them?

[45:51] All right, well, maybe I can help coin taker with their customer service a little bit. How about that?

[46:06] I'll get you, I'll respond to all your emails. Look, I agree. There's no excuse not to get an email

[46:15] response. It's not like these people are getting thousands of emails a day.

[46:24] Where are the five allocations for Beetlejuice? Well, we're getting games 501 through 505,

[46:32] but I haven't opened up your ability to get them yet. Are you guys, don't worry,

[46:39] don't worry, they're going to Kenaeeta club members.

[46:46] No, it's not gonna just be like first come first serve and there's only five. We're gonna have to

[46:49] figure out a fair way to give someone the privilege to get one at MSRP.

[47:01] But, you know, I mean, I wanted to just auction off one to give everybody a chance and

[47:08] and that and everybody just went crazy. Like you guys like literally you went nuts on me. Like

[47:18] it's it's it's incredible.

[47:28] Fizzy would sub brother.

[47:31] You know what I'm getting a sense here. Like some people, Melissa's great. Some people,

[47:37] they need to help on their cousin. I will say this. This is all good feedback for them and,

[47:43] you know, I think I'm gonna talk to them about this as well because I think one of the things that

[47:50] you should never have is this level of inconsistency with your customer service. I agree with

[47:55] you guys. I'm not gonna sit here. If you've had a bad experience with a distributor and they didn't

[48:02] get back to your emails or you felt like they didn't take care of you the way you want it.

[48:08] I'm not I will never be like you're the problem. No, the customer is always right and

[48:13] and the and the distributors and dealers have a responsibility to make sure their customers are

[48:19] happy. I mean, it's just that simple. And if you've had a bad experience, you know, there's a lot

[48:24] of other customers out there. Yeah, I mean, I think Chris and Melissa are

[48:32] awesome. I mean, personally, I've had nothing but great interactions with them. I think they're

[48:37] incredible people. And, you know, I think if you didn't get a response from your email and then

[48:44] you call them and then you respond, you know, I would just say, look, you know, be a little

[48:53] little resourceful in trying to get an answer. I do tend to think that I maybe sometimes they

[49:00] don't respond to emails on things they don't have answers to yet and they don't want to say stuff,

[49:04] but you know, they should still respond. Like I'm also guilty this at times where I like I have a

[49:11] few emails waiting in my Patreon and I didn't get back to people and then I'm like, oh man,

[49:15] that's not my style, but I'm not always paying attention to that because I'm usually just in the chat.

[49:21] Yeah, French is a good judge of character.

[49:33] Now, and Chris is just like a big teddy bear, right? I mean, come on.

[49:43] Yeah, so, you know, it's going to be fun when it's coming down the pipeline.

[49:48] Anyone, did anyone, did anybody, did anyone watch the three hour George Gomez interview? I just,

[50:01] I just, I love George. I just don't need three hours of anybody in pinball being interviewed.

[50:12] I just don't, you know, I think George is doing a little bit of a of a damage control

[50:19] tour right now and it's not even George I want to hear from. I kind of think Seth is the one

[50:23] people need to interview. It was Jamie's Jamie Bushnell's pinball show and JBS, the Jamie Bushnell

[50:35] show or whatever he calls it, the round table with kale and Ralph. Look, I, in my opinion right now,

[50:46] I just think that it's, it's gotten to the point where the product needs to do the talking.

[50:55] And I don't want to hear from George about this issue or how putting flat plastics and making

[51:05] the product cheaper helps with the margins and that, that means they're being business savvy.

[51:10] Like, I just don't need to constantly hear why the product is worse today than it was four,

[51:17] five years ago. I mean, I think that's the only way I can look at this company is Star Wars is

[51:24] much worse than Godzilla and it costs more and it's got your new platform. I don't see Spike 3's

[51:30] enhancements. I don't see the value in their modern products. I think their accessory lines are

[51:37] overpriced and lazy and I think they are like trying to sell a product at a price that the product

[51:43] doesn't deliver at that price. And that's it for me. I mean until like I'm waiting for them to blow

[51:49] me away but I think they passed on too many nostalgic themes. I think, I think,

[51:54] Jody and whoever was doing the licensing for them completely, completely missed the mark.

[52:02] And I think they're really struggling. Yeah, but like, just 50th,

[52:08] okay, it is a great pin but it's, you know, it's another game that

[52:16] kind of still ships away at Stern just continues to burn its own customers. Like the jaws 50th

[52:24] is the one to have over the LE, right? They had a, you know, now you've got two special edition

[52:35] jaws machines and, you know, it's, I just so tired of them like burning their LE buyers and

[52:42] they did it again. Well, I think jaws is currently ranked.

[52:50] No, don't get the Star Wars top or don't even get Star Wars. Like if you could,

[52:54] if you bought Fall of the Empire, don't just, I don't know why you bought it. Why would you buy

[52:59] this game unless you got a huge discount on one? What, what, you need your head examine?

[53:05] I think jaws in Godzilla are, you know, Stern's two best modern games in the last like four,

[53:13] five years for sure. And again, like both of them say they have all the assets, they have all the

[53:21] everything you want.

[53:22] Well, I am, you know, whenever people ask me like, what's Stern should I buy this year? I always

[53:38] say jaws 50th. To me, that's the one to get. I don't think Stern at least even mean anything

[53:45] anymore. I just really don't. So, Tuck said he sold his jaws after 100 games.

[53:56] Tuck, so you a fan of the jaws movie though?

[54:05] I mean, Elvira is the game where there's just like so many versions of it that you know,

[54:10] you can't even like get your head around like which one is the one to have.

[54:15] The spike three cabinet with the, with the crappy corners and the brackets is better.

[54:30] Yeah, the, the jaws software is incredible like they nailed it.

[54:35] Can you wait until spring to get jaws 50th or would you buy now risk of sell out?

[54:50] I mean, that's a good question. The next cornerstone Eric is Pokemon.

[54:58] Here's my thing on jaws 50th. I don't think they're, you look, it, to me, it's a question of

[55:06] like, let me look real quick. What if anyone's selling one for use? Because I really don't see them

[55:12] pop up often used. And I think the most, so Melissa just wrote on Facebook. Please call me if you

[55:23] do not get a response via email. I try to get answered. But if you don't hear back, maybe I did.

[55:29] Let's see. Maybe I didn't receive it. I'm not saying I have never missed emails because I have,

[55:36] but please call. It's the best way to get in touch. Yeah, super simple. Thank you, Melissa.

[55:41] You see what I'm saying? It's like people.

[55:45] Chris and Melissa are the best. And I, I'm the same way as Melissa. Like I miss stuff on

[55:51] teams chats on emails. I have like 79,000 unread emails at my job. I always tell me it just text me.

[56:00] You know, it's my preferred method of communication. All right. All right, hold on. Let's see. Let's do

[56:08] jaws 50th. I'm in Pinside Market, please. Jaws 50th anniversary premium. All right, here we go.

[56:16] All right. So here's one inbox 93 99. Let's see.

[56:25] I don't. Is that a le? Let's see. Let me share a screen with you guys so you can see what I see right now.

[56:37] All right. So what? It was what? 95 hundred, right? So here's here's one in a box. You could probably

[56:50] get for nine. Let's go. I think this is an Ellie. This guy has it as 50th premium.

[57:00] What customer? Oh, no. It is a 50th. Wow. He like, who would do this? Why would you take the

[57:19] Jaws 50th red armor and put custom? Why would you do this? Why would you try to make it look like an

[57:26] Ellie? I don't hold on. Let's go back. Oh my god. This is so funny. Look at this one.

[57:44] Jaws 50th with Jaws Ellie play field. You know why that is? You know why that is?

[57:50] I'll tell you what that is. I'll tell you what this guy did. What he did was he loves Jaws so much. He has

[58:04] the Ellie that this guy bought the 50th to swap in the nicer play field into his Ellie and then put

[58:16] his Ellie and why would anybody buy this? Like and that's why he's only asking 8,000. Yeah, that's

[58:23] so funny. I wouldn't want it. Why? I just I wouldn't want it. I wouldn't I wouldn't buy that. That's

[58:32] just such a weird Frankenstein game now. Like to me, I would oh, it would always distract me.

[58:37] Having that says sale pending at 8. I mean that's an ex you know so basically swap play fields for

[58:46] $1,500. Yeah, JJP's tech support is great. I'm going to be seeing some of my friends at JJP

[59:03] over the next couple of days in a few days and I'm excited. Any questions you want me to ask of JJP

[59:08] leadership? Okay. Anything you want me to ask?

[59:26] Hmm, nothing.

[59:34] Yeah, I mean, like I've had times where I've had some issues with my game and like Eric will call

[59:41] me up Eric Minier like right away. And I always found that to be kind of incredible.

[59:51] Yeah, I think Sonic will be Steve's best game. Will they bring back the scram? What's that?

[59:59] Yeah, Sonic is based on the video game, not the movies. I already know that for a fact.

[01:00:06] Arcade edition for Sonic. Okay, I can ask that. More songs for Elton.

[01:00:11] When are they going to release their insider equivalent? Tell them to keep the great games coming.

[01:00:17] Sonic over Pokemon. So when I talk to them last and we're having some 21 year old

[01:00:28] Japanese whiskey and this gentleman looks at me and he's like Chris, I just saw Steve's latest

[01:00:38] and it is his goat and just the beaming smile on his face. And I was like, well, do you care if I

[01:00:48] tell people he's Sonic? He's like, I don't care. I'm like, it's going to sell like crazy.

[01:00:53] All right. Cool beans. You know, I always say this. There's never a bad time to release a great game

[01:01:03] with that's a great theme. There's never a good time to release a bad game.

[01:01:11] How is JJP FEC set up selling? What is that? What's FEC?

[01:01:23] Well, I don't think JJP has any. I don't know. I think you guys, the insider connected stuff.

[01:01:33] I don't think there's like an urgency to family entertainment center.

[01:01:41] Is that like the redemption ticket accessory that I'm sure Jack talked them into that that

[01:01:48] makes no sense? Yeah. You know, I love Jack, but some of his ideas are so like 1989.

[01:01:59] It like gang, I don't think they care about that. Michael, what's up brother? Come join us YouTube,

[01:02:07] Facebook. I love Jack, but man, he's got some bad ideas when it comes to modern marketing of his

[01:02:17] product. You don't think Sonic's going to sell on theme alone. I think you're wrong.

[01:02:30] I don't like it's not just theme alone. I think it's going to sell because it's going to be

[01:02:33] Steve Richie's coolest pin. I think you're wrong, man. Sonic is a pinball, bro. He's more of a

[01:02:42] pinball than Mario is. The pop bumpers, the speed, the loop, the loops. It's like it's like

[01:02:48] literally pinball in video game format.

[01:03:00] Did you see the spooky light upgrade? Yeah. The strip of lights in the back of the game for like

[01:03:08] $89. Yeah, I saw it. I saw it. I'm not in love with the light strip back there. It's in

[01:03:17] Predator. It's like staring you right in the face. Again, I think you can have better

[01:03:25] GI lighting in a game and not have a dark game. I think Evil Dead is really dark for people.

[01:03:31] I think you can figure out a way to have better GI instead of that. To me, that's a little like

[01:03:38] it's a little jarring to have that light strip facing the player.

[01:03:54] So I have a Anthony said I have a data E star wars, not one dimple on the play field. Why can't we

[01:03:59] get better play fields? Yeah, but here's the thing Anthony, I bet the clear code on your star wars

[01:04:03] DE is almost there's probably like no real clear. It's just kind of rougher art. You know,

[01:04:11] the surface run your hand over a data East game and it's there's no dimples, but there's no clear

[01:04:18] like what's dimpling is the thick clear code. It's not the wood dimpling. It's the clear.

[01:04:22] Bro, the cong toppers have cool. The light on Kong is almost nonexistent.

[01:04:36] You know, I still see people being like Kong is amazing. Kong Kong Kong Kong Kong.

[01:04:43] Dude, great. I have friends picking up Kong Ali's now for like nine.

[01:04:47] It's great. I'm glad another stern Ali that lost $4,000 in value is giving people excitement.

[01:05:03] I'm sure Kong is awesome. Then why don't people then juicy? Then why is it tanking in value?

[01:05:08] This is my question. Let's stay on juicies. If Kong is awesome, why is it tanking in value?

[01:05:14] Let's just stay on this topic. Let's just let's just unpack this.

[01:05:20] If Kong is so good, why is it tanking in value? Why haven't the sales been amazing?

[01:05:27] What happened? What happened?

[01:05:34] Kong is not selling great.

[01:05:43] You know,

[01:05:57] but the problem gang is when you, you know, stern's value proposition,

[01:06:03] there are three tiered model. I think this is what people don't get about marketing.

[01:06:07] The value of all of their models is contingent on the Ellie holding value.

[01:06:15] I'm saying, if the Ellie doesn't hold value, it doesn't stabilize the premiums and the pros.

[01:06:22] It's like a house of cards. Once that Ellie starts crashing down,

[01:06:28] it's slamming the demand for the other two down as well.

[01:06:33] And this is what, you know, stern geniusly implemented this three tiered model so many years ago.

[01:06:39] And they also stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly stupidly destroy their own model.

[01:06:53] Like they they they it had to be the dumbest move ever for them to not take care of their own business model of value.

[01:07:05] Right. It's not even about the games like if we don't hold this up here, the rest of it sinks.

[01:07:13] And that's it. When the Ellie comes crashing down, it crashes through people's demand to even own because that's

[01:07:19] what they like as buyers like again, you'd have to be an idiot or just so rich that you would spend

[01:07:29] $13,000 on something that will be nine in six months. You know what I'm saying? Like you just have

[01:07:34] to be an idiot. And last time I checked like rich people don't become rich because they idiotically overpay

[01:07:41] for everything. And that's the thing is now Stern's entire sort of the optics around all of their

[01:07:47] three tiered model is that new inbox prices of these games is an idiotic purchase. And if you buy

[01:07:53] at these prices, you are absolutely going to get hosed. And if you had just waited, you can get such a

[01:07:59] better price on all of it. And the thing is his con came out. And it did have like a rainbow puke play field.

[01:08:06] All the art looked the same on every model like they didn't differentiate enough. And then instantly it's

[01:08:12] like, well, I don't I don't want to take the risk. I don't want to take the financial risk. No one was saying

[01:08:17] the game wasn't fun. But I don't want to lose this much money. And this is the part that Stern

[01:08:22] Bimal has not had to deal with. They have not had to deal with like catastrophic second hand value

[01:08:31] losses that they've been handing their customers now for five years. Ever since they went to $15,000.

[01:08:38] It's been like four years now. Ever since they went to 13,000. But you fully accessorize a Stern

[01:08:43] LE you're at 15 grand. Let's let's not let's not pretend you're not. Ever since they handed the

[01:08:49] catastrophic loss and price to their own top top of the these are the cremdala crème. Like buyers. I

[01:08:56] mean, imagine getting first class plane tickets and your food sucks like you know and people back in

[01:09:02] coach are actually getting a better experience. The Stern Pro is holding value better than the

[01:09:08] LE. That was never the case. The fact that they still can't figure this out. The fact that they

[01:09:16] still can't figure out that we have a problem Houston. If our cheapest product is holding better

[01:09:22] value than our most expensive product. How do they not get that? And they've still not figured it out.

[01:09:32] Okay, let's read this guy. Perfect day. Bro, you're not wrong. But you are seriously looking at the

[01:09:37] pinball market like a commodity and trading market. You are a smart guy, but you completely missed the

[01:09:42] mark. These are leisure products. You have a perfect day. Perfect day. No, no, no, perfect day. How long

[01:09:49] have you been in pinball? How long have you been in this hobby? Because I can tell by your response,

[01:09:54] you've only been in this hobby. Probably the last like three, four years. You have not been in this

[01:09:58] hobby for 12 years because people need cars. Cars are a necessity.

[01:10:10] How, no, no, tell me how long you've been in this hobby. Don't tell me not, don't tell me how many years,

[01:10:15] don't tell me not 12. How many years have you been studying the pinball market?

[01:10:22] Two years. This proves my point. I love that you were like, hasn't it to say because you knew I was

[01:10:28] going to make fun of you a little bit. You don't know anything about the pinball market. For the

[01:10:32] majority of like people here, these were not games. These were not games that were like leisure

[01:10:40] items that had heavy depreciation. The only reason pinball is where it's at today is that you

[01:10:46] didn't lose a lot of money. In fact, if you bought every sternale from like 2000 and like 16 to 2021,

[01:10:55] you made money, bro, because the supply did not reach the demand.

[01:11:05] So like, yeah, so cool, but stern can survive if people look at their products like commoditized cars

[01:11:15] that are going to depreciate significantly. You do understand this, right?

[01:11:20] That I need my car. Do you need another pinball machine? Do you need to lose $4,000

[01:11:27] by the next sternale? You obsessed too much on the commodity and trading side of things.

[01:11:40] Bro, you've only been in this hobby for two years, man. I've been doing this show for 12. This is

[01:11:46] what I talk about. I talk about the pinball community and the pinball market and I talk about

[01:11:53] how these products are putting a world. Dude, what do you want to talk about? You want to talk

[01:11:57] about how to get to the wizard mode? You want to talk about the sound when you hit the spinner,

[01:12:02] when you're whipping them spinners? I talk exactly about this stuff that's actually

[01:12:08] entertaining and exciting to talk about every week. There are 20 other content creators that will

[01:12:15] put you to sleep talking about how much they love, how much they love figuring out the rules,

[01:12:21] it's, and going to tournaments, playing in leagues, winning trans lats.

[01:12:33] You're not, you look, you're not coming in with fresh eyes. You're coming in with no perspective.

[01:12:41] You know, bro, I've been where you are. When I started collecting arcade machines at the

[01:12:48] beginning, I was like, you man, I didn't know, I didn't know what I should be buying. I didn't

[01:12:53] know what things were worth. And I got, I got absolutely taken advantage of. And my point is this

[01:13:00] perfect day, one, three, one, three. Stern is taking advantage now of its loyal customer base

[01:13:09] by charging this much, by handing them significant, they've ripped off their own customers.

[01:13:15] They are charging the scalping price out of the box, bro. You're paying $4,000 for a cardboard box now.

[01:13:26] And once I learned in the arcade, see, when I got into arcade collecting, you know,

[01:13:30] you remember the guy like Richie Knuckles, man, like he was selling me like a tron. That wasn't even

[01:13:36] good condition for like $5,000. And I did because I didn't care, man, in me, I was like,

[01:13:40] five grand, that's nothing. It's my childhood. I grew up with this machine and I was overpaying

[01:13:45] and overpaying. And then when I told people what I paid, they're like, bro, you overpaid by like

[01:13:50] twice. And so when we see these games now, it's like, bro, 13,000, 14,600 dollars for a star

[01:14:00] wars with the top. This stupid, it's like the, that's what Batman SL Lee was with way more in it.

[01:14:14] And we complained about it then. You know, the problem with all of it.

[01:14:21] You know, the problem with all the, the newbies now, I'll tell you what the problem is, is

[01:14:27] every time you rush and buy, you're just making it worse for yourselves and you're all going to get burned.

[01:14:34] I mean, you can see it now already. You can see it now ready. Like all the newbies who came in two,

[01:14:38] three years ago and they bought up everything, whether you're just a content creator or a normal buy,

[01:14:43] you're all like, you're not, you're not ready for what's about to hit you if you want to move

[01:14:50] games out and move new ones in. You're absolutely going to get destroyed.

[01:14:56] And like, oh man, shoot, maybe I should have waited. Maybe I should have jiked, not ran and got that game.

[01:15:04] I look, and that's what's fun, bro. It's fun because I can entertain you for 90 minutes.

[01:15:10] This is more entertaining than any damn pinball machine. There it just is. Go to concerts better

[01:15:16] than any pinball machine eating omakase better than any pinball machine going in my Dodge demon

[01:15:23] better than any pinball experience. Like I love playing pinball. It's fun. It's fun. But it's not

[01:15:28] worth 13,000. It's not worth 15,000. You guys all know this. It used to me, man. It's not because

[01:15:34] there were better games for $5,000 10 years ago. And those games 10 years ago that were $5,000.

[01:15:41] They're still amazing today. Like pinball hasn't like dramatically advanced. It just hasn't.

[01:15:49] And I know that like, yeah, there's some nice new features and the screens nice and this and that.

[01:15:54] But man, the experience, the experience and the amount of excuses these people make now to

[01:16:02] like look at Star Wars in 2025 and look at the Adams family in 1995, bro.

[01:16:08] Just think about that for a minute. Look at Star Wars 13 grand. When Adams family came out,

[01:16:13] it was like $2,000, bro. What kills me is the lack of real value going into these games.

[01:16:23] They've taken everything out. They've replaced, they've replaced like mechs with flow and art.

[01:16:33] And then they charge you so much money. And then what? You get a game where there's one mech.

[01:16:45] And that's why Beetlejuice crushed. Look at Beetlejuice, man. A sculpted world under glass,

[01:16:51] bro, for 10 grand. Every time I go back and look at Beetlejuice, the artwork by franche,

[01:16:56] the mechanisms in it, the sculpts. No flat plastics here, bro.

[01:17:05] I look at Star Wars next to Beetlejuice and this is joke. This is joke.

[01:17:10] And they built that in a barn in Benton, Wisconsin. And Stern's got this ginormous factory with

[01:17:16] 600 or 450 500 employees. They can't build a better game than a few, a few bro, you know,

[01:17:23] dudes down in Benton, Wisconsin. There's more people that work at Stern than I think even live in

[01:17:29] Benton, Wisconsin. So it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. Now what's really embarrassing

[01:17:37] is that normally when you get these like bespoke boutique, you know, efforts, they charge you

[01:17:43] twice as much as the mass-produced company. And that's the part that's embarrassing for Stern.

[01:17:49] We're charging 30% more for Star Wars, Ellie than Beetlejuice cost.

[01:17:55] And we're the mass-produced commodity. And there, the passion-driven boutique bespoke product.

[01:18:04] Did you guys not like that is embarrassing? And I know George doesn't care because he's like,

[01:18:10] I do more in a week than they do near. Yeah, but George, what George doesn't get is the market

[01:18:16] is over-satcher. There's too many games out there. This is not going to last much longer.

[01:18:21] I would be shocked if they can successfully make it Stern two more years the way they're going.

[01:18:27] Shocked. You can't, you can't, you know, and carry asks are there 15,000 games? Yeah, what

[01:18:34] carry should have asked is more of the real question. Is it true that you have 3,000 Venoms and

[01:18:43] John Wicks in boxes, which is they do? 3,000, bro. Where those games are going to go?

[01:18:51] Millions of dollars in inventory. Yeah, I don't care about the size of the company.

[01:19:03] No, they made every mistake a company could make. The last four years, they made every marketing

[01:19:08] mistake a company can make. And you don't, you know what I'm saying? When you go, when you make

[01:19:13] those mistakes and then you don't pivot, you don't course correct, they haven't done anything

[01:19:19] to course correct. What have they done? Look, I love Stern machines when they were the right price.

[01:19:29] And I think they're, I think they're laughably overpriced.

[01:19:38] Yeah, it's three Stern LEs or my Toyota GR86. Just think about that for a minute.

[01:19:49] Three Stern LEs or my Toyota GR86.

[01:19:56] Stupid, stupid. Three Stern LEs used to be like 18,000, not 35,000, 40,000 with accessories.

[01:20:07] Stupid, stupid. Three Stern LEs with accessories are closer to 45,000 dollars now.

[01:20:17] You know, they don't want you to talk like that. Can they? They don't want you to say, how can you

[01:20:20] say that? You don't see 45,000 dollars in value in three fully accessorized Stern LEs.

[01:20:27] Hector, what's up, brother? Will JJP make a 30th anniversary Harry Potter in two years?

[01:20:45] No. I mean, I don't know for sure, but I will tell them when I have dinner with them this weekend,

[01:20:51] don't do that. They don't need to do that. They don't need to do that. That's a bad move.

[01:21:07] George is, George's, George's, let me, let me, let me be honest. George didn't, no, what George

[01:21:15] denied, and we get, it's very, you got to be very careful with the wording here. George denied that

[01:21:20] there's 15,000 games, and that's what Carrie asked them. Are there 15,000 games in storage?

[01:21:27] The real question is, George, are there, here's what I heard, that there are like 3000 Wixen

[01:21:34] Venoms in storage that Stern is paying 15 dollars a game on to which I'm hearing there. They are

[01:21:43] spending 50,000 a month in storage fees to hold the games. That's what I heard, whether that's true

[01:21:52] or not, I don't know. But it's really, come on, gang, you think they sold it? Mike, thank you, brother.

[01:22:03] I like that. Looking good.

[01:22:14] Someone who bought an Elton John Avatar and Godfather probably lost way more than someone who bought a

[01:22:20] Jaws, Metallic and Kong. First of all, I don't think anybody bought EJ Avatar and Godfather. I

[01:22:26] don't. And yeah, Godfather was one of the worst theme ideas of all time. Avatar was two.

[01:22:37] Avatar's have held better than Godfather. So have Elton's, look, Elton and Avatar's did not

[01:22:42] plummet in value. They didn't plummet. Elton's held the strongest. The thing is the Godfather

[01:22:49] losses are just the worst. Like Godfather's CE, you lost $7,000 on. If you actually want to move

[01:22:56] a Godfather's CE, you're like, you're looking at eight. I love the John Wick fanboys. Chris is

[01:23:05] the biggest of them all. Wick is very underrated. God to keep it underrated. John Wick is just

[01:23:15] something nobody wants. I'm glad. I don't want it. You know, they never got over the gungate.

[01:23:30] They literally never. I mean, I think Wick might have been the worst launch ever.

[01:23:41] No, what Stern doesn't get is nostalgia is where it's at. Nostalgia is where it's at. And

[01:23:48] they've nothing nostalgic. Transformers will be...

[01:23:51] I don't know. I think a 5K with pro is still a thousand overpriced.

[01:24:01] The thing about it is this. I always say this is not, I don't care how much you give me off

[01:24:07] on something I don't want. Right? If a pinball machine was a prostitute and you don't want to

[01:24:17] sleep with that woman, let's say her rates 100 bucks and you're not attracted to her.

[01:24:25] She's like, I'll sleep with you for 50. I still would you sleep with her?

[01:24:31] No, I don't want to sleep with any bad pinball machine. I don't want to sleep with... I don't want to

[01:24:38] buy any pinball machine I don't want at any price. You know what I'm saying? I wouldn't even buy a

[01:24:43] John Wick pro for a thousand dollars because I don't want it. Yeah, I can buy it for a thousand.

[01:24:49] So yeah, I guess I guess. I know what you're saying. You can flip it, but I'm just saying I don't

[01:24:52] want it. Like if someone pulled up to my house right now, I was like a thousand dollars,

[01:24:57] but it's John Wick problem. I don't want it. I just don't want it at any price.

[01:25:04] In your mind, every pin needs to increase in value. Otherwise, it's... No, that's not what I'm saying

[01:25:09] perfect day. But what I'm saying perfect day is in my... In my mind, a pinball machine should not

[01:25:17] depreciate in the first six months like they are now. There's a Rolex depreciate by 30% the moment

[01:25:26] you buy it. I see these more like Rolexes and less like cars. To your point, these are luxury items.

[01:25:36] Yeah, I... If I bought Brenda, you know, I don't... A Cartier bracelet. If I spent 15,000 dollars on

[01:25:45] a Cartier bracelet, it's not losing 30% of its value in like six months. In fact, it'll just hold.

[01:25:52] It'll go down a little bit because it's used, but just a little bit. And that's what pinball used to be,

[01:25:57] bro. I know you've only been in it two years, but bro, we used to lose just two to $500 in a year

[01:26:04] on a game. $500 at most. Now it's 5,000, bro. You have to understand the difference.

[01:26:09] That losing $7,000 on a... Like, literally, you can almost lose $6,000 on a modern sternalee.

[01:26:17] That is the most amount of depreciation in the history of pinball. James Bond's 60th is the biggest

[01:26:23] loss people have ever had. It was over $10,000. So you're like, you know what I'm saying? Like, you just

[01:26:28] don't get it, bro.

[01:26:35] Why can't I compare this to Rolex? Why? A lot of Rolexes lose money. Which Rolexes lose money?

[01:26:49] Omega's lose like 40% immediately. That's not a Rolex. No Rolex loses 49% immediately.

[01:26:57] Named me a Rolex that loses 20% the moment you buy it. Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Why you guys go find that one

[01:27:07] for me? Yeah. Like this omega, I think it was like nine. Yeah. I could probably easily get it for,

[01:27:14] I don't know, six or something. I didn't know that. You know, when I got into watches or bought

[01:27:21] these, I, you know, should have gone on watch recon and just grab one. Yeah, because it doesn't care.

[01:27:29] Fancy dress gold ones lose a ton. Yeah, but you know who buys those JC? Just super loaded people

[01:27:36] that don't care. Yeah, the whole point is emergency is said the best. The whole point is

[01:27:48] if it is so easy to find the pen you want for so much less money in just a few months, why wouldn't you wait?

[01:28:01] Anyway, look, it's not my look. I gang gang. Here's a deal. Here's the deal. Do you not find

[01:28:09] entertainment in talking about this side of the hobby? I mean, everyone else does the opposite,

[01:28:17] man. They all talk about how much they love their King Kong. Go listen to those guys.

[01:28:24] You know, I mean, it's like snooze fest content. You know that. You know that. That's why you're here.

[01:28:30] That's why we're the most subscribers. Let's see. Perfect. Are you, are you a Canadian club member?

[01:28:38] Are you a Canadian club member, my man?

[01:29:20] All right. Sign up. Join. Join the party.

[01:29:35] Look at you signing up now. Let's do it, guys.

[01:29:42] Number one show. Number one show. And look, gang, you know this. You're going to get three podcasts

[01:29:47] a week. And look, we go, we go, we go around the horn. We talk about all the different topics. And

[01:29:53] also, perfect day. What you're going to love about joining Canada club is the Patreon,

[01:29:59] chat, bro. Chris Ellsman there every day talking about how good John Wick is. We ignore him every

[01:30:03] day. Every day, he's still talking about it. But it's a really fun community. You know, look,

[01:30:10] we all have fun here. This is this is this is what makes the hobby amazing. It's the people. It's

[01:30:15] hanging out. It's having a good time. You know, we are we debate these games. We're right now in a

[01:30:22] little bit of a lull. We're waiting for those beetle juices to make their way out the door in

[01:30:25] January. It's going to get real exciting when beetle juices start landing. And then we're going to

[01:30:30] get yeah, I don't think Winchester until March. I'm just playing off of what they said about when

[01:30:36] the last two orders will be fulfilled. Yeah, paid $10 and we'll never get it. That's the one thing

[01:30:48] that never loses value. Canada's pinball podcast, Patreon, like trust me.

[01:30:57] I think Rolex is doing our absolutely comparable. Oh, man, you bought a predator.

[01:31:09] Well, you know, bond constantly hating on JJP is it's just part of like it's at the point now

[01:31:15] where it's just it's an entertaining evergreen distraction that nobody really pays attention to

[01:31:22] anymore. You know, I'm saying it's like he's still hating on Elton John where we're like so far

[01:31:27] beyond this. And Harry Potter is a great game. And bond just can't admit it. See, whenever you get

[01:31:36] a level of prejudice where nobody can do any good, then you really become one dimensional.

[01:31:43] And, and you know, it's still fun having bond there, but JJP made a great game in Harry Potter.

[01:31:50] I, you know, but he's got his bone to pick and he can come pick it with, you know, with the

[01:31:59] community every day. All right, everybody look. Oh, we just got we just Sean, is this you?

[01:32:06] Did he just Sean, did he just join? Is that you?

[01:32:17] Mr. Perfect day. Is that you Sean?

[01:32:22] I'm Sean.

[01:32:28] Everybody have a wonderful Saturday. Life is very short. All of us should be very happy we're above

[01:32:38] ground. I'm going to do this week my top like, Kaneda Kudos Awards podcast where I will, I might

[01:32:51] do it as a Patreon live. I think it'll be more fun for me to open up envelopes and announce

[01:32:57] who the winners are for each category. Let's do that. That'll be more fun. So,

[01:33:05] awesome brother. Happy to have you guys, man. So what's fun is I'll do a Facebook lot. I'll do a

[01:33:10] YouTube. Sorry, a Patreon live of Kaneda's best of 2025. We'll go over all the different categories.

[01:33:20] And I will announce who I give my Kaneda Kudos to. It's been a great year.

[01:33:26] Lots of amazing stuff is going to be happening. Yep, Mike, you got it. 2026 is going to be just

[01:33:31] going to be fun, man. And I encourage each and every one of you to just just be patient.

[01:33:37] Look, join my show move when I tell you to move, move fast, you know, when I tell you to get a

[01:33:41] beer, do spot, those of you who listen, everything else, you don't need to move fast. Just wait it out,

[01:33:49] wait it out. Pokemon. Pokemon's not going to do what people think.

[01:33:55] It is not going to do what people think. It was different. You might not have heard of Rick and

[01:33:59] Morty, but when Rick and Morty is adult, Pokemon's for kids and you guys didn't, most of you

[01:34:06] have no connection to Pokemon whatsoever. None. It's so funny to me. I think it's going to be

[01:34:13] such a rude awakening launch. And we're going to get it in just like two weeks. Literally,

[01:34:20] CES is Tuesday, January 6th. Everybody, be good. Love you. Thank you for being a club member.

[01:34:28] Thank you for the new guys who just signed up. You guys will get nice shout outs on the show.

[01:34:32] Mr. Franchie, thank you for all you do. Be kind. Be kind to each other and be kind to people in

[01:34:41] the world, the world's a crazy place. Do you anyone watch? I was so happy to see Jake Paul get

[01:34:47] his ass kicked last night. I was so happy that his jog got broken on each side because what a clown,

[01:34:54] what an idiot. He's a fraud. He's fake. He's not a real boxer. And he stepped into the ring with

[01:35:00] a real boxer. And unlike the Tyson fight in which he paid Mike Tyson not to hit him. And look,

[01:35:06] Joshua could have could have ended that fight in 30 seconds. He waited to the fifth round. And

[01:35:11] look what happened actually when he started letting his hands go broke his jaw on each side.

[01:35:17] I loved watching it happen. He'll never box again, Hector. You know, because this is the thing is

[01:35:22] like all of his hoop versus over. Like unless you know, no one's going to pay this because he looked

[01:35:27] like an idiot yesterday. He couldn't. He was running around like a baby. He couldn't even like,

[01:35:31] he kept falling over like a child to the whole time. We're going to we're going to talk. He didn't

[01:35:37] last six rounds. The guy didn't start fighting until the fifth round and he got knocked out in the

[01:35:42] fifth round. There's a difference between lasting and the guy's not even fighting you yet. It's like

[01:35:48] when Conor McGregor fought Mayweather. Do you remember that fight? Dude, Mayweather was just

[01:35:55] keeping him in it. There was there was a moment like in the first or second round where Mayweather

[01:36:00] hit some with an uppercut and then holds on the Conor to keep Conor from getting knocked out

[01:36:05] and falling down because that wasn't in the script. The real boxers will destroy any fake boxer that

[01:36:13] gets into the ring with them. Jigs got no talent. Everybody be good. We'll talk to you later.
