[00:00] All right kids this is not even an episode

[00:02] It's just gonna be how the reveal of stranger things is gonna roll out now that I know everything and I knew it all long

[00:10] But I just put the pieces together and I want to tell you exactly what to expect

[00:15] Over the weekend and into next week when it comes to stranger things

[00:18] I'm gonna tell you quickly what I've heard from people who have played the game

[00:23] And this is it okay no more until we see the game

[00:25] But I want to just give you how it's gonna roll out

[00:27] So here's what's going to happen you know in this is actually kind of interesting because in the midst of spooky

[00:32] Pimball dealing with all the issues with when I'm when I'm gonna get a game

[00:37] How is it gonna work like how long do I have to wait?

[00:41] Stern Pimball is about to do something

[00:44] That has never been done in the history of Pimball

[00:47] They are about to pull the Steve Jobs and they are about to announce a game and

[00:52] Make that game available not just to buy but also to pick up and take home the same exact day

[01:01] They announced the game this has never been done before in Pimball and this is an amazing feat in Pimball

[01:08] There is no way around it in a world in which Pimball manufacturing is the most difficult thing on the planet apparently

[01:15] The fact that Stern Pimball can announce a game on December 23rd

[01:20] Not only a show us the game not only show us the features

[01:25] But you know where the game is right now the game is at distributors already

[01:30] They're hiding them at distributors the game is on its way to Europe the game is in some barcades and

[01:39] That will be unboxed on December 23rd. They are going to have a blitz

[01:44] They are going to blitz us on December 23rd by not just showing the game but making it available for purchase and I think that is

[01:51] Honestly one of the most incredible feats in the history of Pimball manufacturing and my hat if I was wearing one

[01:58] Goes off to the team over there at Stern look. I know I give them shit

[02:03] Oops, I'm not supposed to curse. I know I give them crap for you know

[02:06] selling us cheap toppers and putting pieces of couch and games and look they do crappy stuff like that

[02:12] But there's no way around the fact that Stern Pimball has some of the hottest themes in the world and the their ability to

[02:19] Manufacture these things at scale is just unprecedented

[02:22] So congratulations to everyone over at Stern for being able to pull the Steve Jobs and have a game available

[02:30] Inbox for people to take home on the same exact day that the game is you know being revealed and the other part that's

[02:37] Amazing is they have no more leaks anymore. It's Stern Pimball like nothing is leaked

[02:40] I have not seen any images. I have not seen any gameplay videos. They have done an amazing job

[02:46] I mean think about how tight they are running stuff over there the game is on the line the games being made nobody who works there

[02:53] None of the line workers are taking photos nobody's sharing anything no artwork is being passed around by the artist who worked on the game

[03:00] None of the engineers have shared anything with their buddies. What an amazing tight job they've done on keeping this thing under wraps

[03:08] Okay, now we all know it's stranger things so that that it is stranger things

[03:13] So that is happening you're gonna see on Sunday what you're gonna get on Sunday

[03:18] You're gonna get a teaser video of the game so that teaser trailer will go out

[03:23] We've seen Stern do that before and then Monday morning it breaks

[03:27] I think it's gonna be like 9 a.m. I don't know if it's Eastern time or Western time

[03:30] You're gonna see media outlets right about it. You're gonna see videos

[03:35] You're also gonna probably have them stream the game as well on Monday as well

[03:40] So that's also what's gonna happen is they're gonna have it's probably gonna be mr. Jack Danger

[03:45] He's gonna do a stream of the game that afternoon

[03:47] So you're all gonna be able to see the game in motion as well

[03:51] I mean it's it's it's everything. It's the first ever

[03:55] Completely 360 launch of a pinball machine in the history of pinball the game will be revealed the game will be shown to you on a stream

[04:03] The game will be available to purchase the game will be available to take home the game will be available to play on location

[04:09] Holy crap when you think about all the things are about to do with this game

[04:14] All right now I guess the big question that is is the game any good is all of this worth it

[04:19] Well, it's stranger things so to juggernaut theme. Here's what I'm hearing

[04:22] Here's what I'm hearing I'm hearing it's a fan layout

[04:26] I also am told that I learned that a fan layout is simply it looks like a fan

[04:32] Like you would fan yourself when you're hot and that I I should have known that you would think off

[04:37] There all these years that I would know that that's what a fan layout is

[04:41] I'm sort of like embarrassingly laughing when when when Ed Robertson told me that he's like dude

[04:46] It doesn't mean that it's it's like people will be a fan of this layout you idiot and I'm like

[04:52] Oh, I'm like but my definition is so much cuter Ed and that's why I'm such a fun podcast anyway

[04:59] So it's gonna be a fan layout like attack from Mars and medieval madness

[05:03] So here's what I'm hearing the big thing and we speculated on this on the last show the big thing is the projector

[05:10] It is under the apron and it projects the upside down world into the game

[05:14] But here is what I'm hearing it does not work

[05:18] properly

[05:19] Unless you're in a very low lit room a pretty much a dark room like a pitch black room is

[05:25] Optimal to get this thing to work the right way now that's a problem because that won't work in so many different scenarios

[05:33] Locations and environments so that is what I hear has people really nervous about that game is that projector

[05:40] And if you take it out it's not in the pro version of the game

[05:44] So I'm hearing that you really only need to get the pro version of the game because the big feature

[05:50] That's in the premium and the Ali doesn't really I don't know it doesn't really work that great

[05:55] But we will see but that is what I'm hearing because the other stuff

[05:59] It's the projector and then the balls that get magnetized against the back wall of the cabinet

[06:05] That is what I'm hearing are the main features that are different than the pro

[06:10] I'm hearing the artwork is colorful. It's nice. It's beautiful. It's gonna look good. Game's gonna shoot good

[06:15] It just comes down to that main feature which we will see

[06:19] We will see and I think it's great. I think it's great that we're gonna see this entire thing

[06:24] Wambam, you know happen on on a Monday all 360 elements that we want with a game reveal

[06:30] So thank you Stern for doing it. I know it probably irks and why is Canada talking about what we were gonna surprise everybody with

[06:36] No, you know what maybe Stern maybe it'd be beneficial in the new year to forgive

[06:42] Canada and let's just face it when people want what's gonna happen in pinball they come to canada's pinball podcasts

[06:49] We're not always right, but I'm willing to bank my Twippy you're gonna see this stuff on Monday now

[06:55] It's funny because part of me is like oh man

[06:56] Don't say that because then like a Josh Sharp is gonna try to move it

[07:00] But he probably can't because they're locked in with the licensores and media outlets and embargoes and we and look

[07:05] We have our Cades out there and bar Cades showing us a box and being like guess what's in this box?

[07:10] So December 23rd it's gonna happen and I just want to say

[07:14] It's exciting. This is an exciting time to be in Pimbo

[07:17] I know I just ranted and raved about the Rick and Morty people on my Pinside babies today

[07:20] But like let's everybody just enjoy this hobby. Let's critique stuff. Let's see what comes out and I hear there's

[07:27] Amazing stuff coming from 2020 with Stern games

[07:30] So I'm really just curious to see what this whole projector thing is it's never been done before in Pimball like this and

[07:35] It's either gonna work or not and I don't know

[07:38] But here's the other good thing I heard I heard there are clips from the show with voice actors

[07:45] The actors from the show are in the clips with the voices synced up and there's a lot of those clips

[07:50] So that's great. I think Stern's gonna have the kind of assets we want in the game

[07:55] So that's exciting so looking forward to this

[07:58] Really can't congratulate Stern enough on on on releasing the game this way and I think it's phenomenal

[08:03] I think you guys are gonna enjoy it so everybody enjoy your weekends again

[08:07] Go see Star Wars get your mind off of Pimball Monday mornings when everything is gonna pop so have a good weekend

[08:13] We're not gonna do another show until we see stranger things goodbye everybody
