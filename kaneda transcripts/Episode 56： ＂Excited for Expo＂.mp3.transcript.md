[00:00] They'll never take me alive I'm getting high with my whole five

[00:03] I've done these suckers time and die Even as a youngster

[00:06] Causing rockets on the back of the bus I was a fool on the right school

[00:10] Giving up just for damn labeled as a trouble maker Who can you praise?

[00:14] Moking me down and take away the pain So I'm hopeless

[00:17] Falling down the freeway serving to know of I'm about to cross upon the curve

[00:21] Cause my business is blurry maybe if they try to understand me

[00:24] What's it I do? I had to feed my fucking family

[00:31] Oh

[00:33] Welcome to episode 56 of Canadian pinball podcast and I just love a little two-packsha corn the morning

[00:39] I don't know about you guys, but pinball's fun, but pinball can't even compare to a great song

[00:44] All right a great song never grows old for years and years and years

[00:48] On this episode I'm just really excited. I'm pumped up. I don't know about you guys

[00:53] But the next three weeks are probably the most

[00:57] Exciting three weeks that I think I've experienced being a part of this hobby in in almost three years now

[01:05] There is more stuff that's going to be revealed that this year's expo than ever before and we're gonna talk about that

[01:11] We're gonna talk about the news that Jersey Jack just dropped

[01:14] We're gonna talk about what this means for the industry. We're gonna talk about just the battle

[01:18] It's like a clash of the titans that's gonna happen in three weeks at expo

[01:22] Everyone is competing for dollars and so much is gonna be shown for the first time super exciting

[01:28] We're gonna talk a little bit about Batman 66

[01:31] I want to talk a little bit about where I think the flipping and secondhand market is gonna go

[01:36] And I'm gonna end this episode was something I've always wanted to do but never have done before

[01:42] I am going to give you a word from my master

[01:46] What most of you don't know and I'll explain this later

[01:49] But I am a mere padawan to an in more intelligent being in this hobby that I've been communicating with for years

[01:57] And I've been asking him to allow me to read his insights into this hobby on my podcast

[02:03] And he finally has conceded so you will hear a word from canada's master

[02:09] All right, so let's let's dive right in so the big news this week

[02:13] And we we were all speculating this and I got this wrong

[02:16] The news that Jjp number three Pat Lawler's game is going to be at expo now

[02:24] I miss call this I didn't think Jack would show it. I didn't think it'd be ready

[02:29] We found this news out and in a really weird sort of non glamorous way

[02:35] Todd Tucky TNT amusements was went to jacks open house this weekend and just asked him

[02:42] When are we going to see it and it's like 33 minutes into the video and jack's like yeah

[02:46] We're gonna bring game number three to expo and it's like

[02:49] You know the rest of the world doesn't give a shit

[02:52] But that's like a bombshell announcement for us pinball fanatics a little weird that that's how they sort of

[02:57] Announced it. I thought that was strange and and because like Jack is like going on to make fun of how little people like watch TNT

[03:04] amusement videos

[03:06] I kind of think they should have

[03:09] Surprised and delighted people with pulling the curtain off at the show, but I don't give a shit

[03:12] I'm not gonna complain. It's gonna be there

[03:14] It's great to know that in three weeks. We're gonna see Pat Lawler's game. This is this this game has been sort of the

[03:20] A big question mark in all of our heads is like what are we going to see so

[03:26] Here's my thing. I'm excited to see it

[03:28] I think you know if we look at the list of games are gonna be at expo this year it is going to be

[03:36] Incredible that we have four blockbuster

[03:40] Titles being revealed at the same time

[03:43] So I want to go down the list of what those are gonna be we're gonna see Batman 66 right?

[03:47] We're gonna see it and it's Ellie form probably in super Ellie form

[03:51] We are going to get alien Ellie and your highway has said that game is going into production probably like next week if we're

[03:59] Staying true to his timeline

[04:01] That is a highly anticipated reveal we are going to see Jersey Jack number three Pat Lawler game highly anticipated reveal

[04:09] So those three are juggernauts and then also we're being told that

[04:14] We're gonna see attack from Mars remake

[04:18] Not as much excitement about that one because we already know what attack from Mars is and we know what to expect with the remakes with a

[04:26] planetary pinball so

[04:28] Really incredible times and so let's let's let's dissect what I think this means for Jersey Jack so I

[04:35] Have gone on the record and I've been

[04:38] Speculating and I've questioned Jack's you know business model and what he's doing

[04:43] But if we look at all of the pinball manufacturers out there Jersey Jack is the one that if anyone's really gonna give

[04:51] Stern a run for the money or or sort of

[04:54] Force Stern to up its game and get competitive its Jersey Jack and and I think Jack is solely responsible for where pricing is at these days

[05:03] He showed Stern that the market can bear far more than Stern was charging at the time

[05:09] And so the fact that he's bringing game number three to expo so soon after hobbits have begun to ship

[05:17] It tells me a few things and it tells me that you know hobbits

[05:21] It's probably not the home run they needed it to be all right

[05:25] It I think we all can agree that hobbits are probably not flying off the shelves

[05:30] as fast as as they probably thought it would but but someone also sent me an email saying look if you look at Todd Tucki's video

[05:39] When he flips over the play field it's play field number 1147

[05:44] So that's you know 1147 hobbits at the price point they're selling it's not jump change

[05:50] But we all know for Jersey Jack to succeed he can't keep his business

[05:57] Shipping just one title every two to three years he needs to get multiple games on the line and he needs to be able to introduce

[06:03] I would say at least a new game every year

[06:07] At this point moving forward to really make Jersey Jack a

[06:12] viable competitor

[06:14] And compete with Stern and so we're getting that right hobbit is shipping and

[06:19] Jersey Jack number three is going to be revealed in the middle of October now

[06:23] Here's the main question I have though and this is this is my question that I hope Jack answers at expo

[06:29] I'm sure he will this is the one question. I think is on all of our minds

[06:33] How long is it going to take to ship this pen after they reveal it?

[06:38] I don't think Jack can show this pen off at expo in mid-October and then wait wait

[06:47] Like six months or a year to ship the pen. I don't think so and he's told us multiple times that he's not accepting pre-orders on this game

[06:56] Now if he reveals this at expo and people are like take my money I'm paying for it

[07:02] I think you shouldn't do that

[07:04] Everyone should keep their money in their pockets until

[07:08] The games are ready to ship because if you do

[07:14] Just hand Jack your money then what is the incentive for them to get the game out quicker?

[07:19] I think they need to hold true to the model of we're not gonna take your money until the game ships now look

[07:26] We're like in a new era now or even Stern accepted payments on ghost busters all the way back in I think even like March

[07:35] People were paying for ghost busters and I still haven't gotten my ghost busters

[07:40] Ellie and and so even Stern now has taken people's money distributors were saying games are about to ship and then we got these delays

[07:47] I think if Jersey Jack is gonna show this game at expo this game needs to ship to customers

[07:55] within

[07:56] Three months. I really do if he's not this close to shipping it

[08:01] Then I think revealing it at expo is a mistake if he's revealing it because he desperately needs people to not spend

[08:10] Their money on on a highway pen or a stern pen and he wants people to keep their money in their pocket because I know this is coming

[08:18] You could argue that's a smart move

[08:21] But I think we are in a new climate now where delays equal death

[08:27] The lays equal death when it comes to hype and if you want your hype to live and you want your hype to equal money

[08:34] Then you need to reveal closer to shipping than ever before

[08:38] Let's take a model from the most successful company in the world that sells products. Let's take a model

[08:44] Let's take Apple's model for example when they reveal iPhone 7 you can go buy it that week

[08:50] Right they are taking your money. It's not like here it is and now you have to wait eight months

[08:56] Another industry which I think does it all wrong is the auto industry

[09:00] They show you a hot car at a car show and then it's not available for a year a year and so what's the point you got all these people just like

[09:10] Waiting around forever and then if there are delays people just get more pissed off and that's sort of like where pinball is more

[09:16] I think we're done with delays

[09:18] I think we're done with delays if jack says he doesn't need your money to make the pen if he says there's

[09:25] Financial sound he doesn't want to take pre-orders and he wants you to take money when games are going into boxes

[09:30] Then let's see if that's true now a rumor we heard is that jack is going to bring 10

[09:35] Examples of

[09:37] Pat Lawler's game in box

[09:40] For people to buy and take home and so bring your money

[09:44] And I don't buy this rumor at all at all

[09:50] I don't think

[09:51] I don't think these games have been on the line. I don't think they've been tested

[09:55] I think people also want any new title to go through a period of quality control and testing and that means like

[10:03] Like even what they did with Hobbit

[10:05] Shipping out ten of them to some operators who can put them on location so they get played consistently for a few weeks to see

[10:12] What might break and to see what might have issues and they did that with hobbit and the ramps broke that got me banned from

[10:18] Inside but Jack reinforced the ramps the ramps are now not breaking and that is what people want to see some quality control testing

[10:26] We saw it with ghost busters if ghost busters was on location and played a lot for the first like few weeks before final production kicked off

[10:33] They would have fixed the rail problems. They would have fixed the slimer problems instead

[10:38] Customers were the guinea pigs and doing the quality control for them

[10:41] So I hope Jack ships his pen. I hope it I he gets it right. I'm super excited

[10:46] The other thing that I'm really curious about is to see how people react to the original theme

[10:52] We know nothing about this pin other than the fact that we're told it's an original theme

[10:57] I heard that Pat was like working on this game that it was pretty much complete when Jack walked in and saw it for the first time

[11:03] And Jack is like I want to make that title

[11:06] Again pure rumor

[11:08] But this game's been worked on and this game has been finessed for for a long time

[11:12] And I think we all have high expectations you have to pat lawler is

[11:18] He's he's a juggernaut designer and these juggernaut designers are like movie directors

[11:23] We expect big things every time they make something and look we know that Pat's had some misses during the the linear is at

[11:29] Stern but I'm sure his budgets during that time period were absolutely horrendous

[11:34] So it's really really really exciting to see like how a original theme will do when stacked up against

[11:41] themes like Ghostbusters Batman aliens

[11:44] You know it's it's

[11:46] We've we've seen that themes are everything like Star Wars by Stern is not even announced and it's pretty much already sold out

[11:53] So will it have innovation will it have technology all these questions will be answered

[11:58] But I just think if Jack's listening or anyone's a JJP fanboy

[12:01] I think they need to have this game ready to ship within three months of reveal or I think it's gonna be a mistake

[12:07] I think they cannot show this thing and make people wait a long time

[12:11] So what does this mean to for like the other?

[12:14] Manufacturers out there. I don't think Stern saw this coming. I think Stern sees Expo

[12:20] 2016 as the moment where like Stern takes over the world with their big party

[12:25] The pinball life party shut down like they are the main focus Friday night at Expo is really gonna be I think Stern's

[12:34] You know sticking a stake in the ground and saying nobody fucks with us

[12:38] Nobody can do what we can do and here we are. We're gonna show you Batman 66. We got Adam West

[12:43] We got fucking dancing monkeys. We got

[12:46] Bear naked ladies lead singer. We've got all this stuff going on. We've got the Biper room rented out

[12:51] We've got everything going look for paying to get into this party if the drinks aren't free

[12:58] Fuck you Stern seriously. I love you guys. I love my friends over there

[13:02] But you can't make me pay to go to a party to celebrate your birthday and then make me pay for drinks

[13:08] You motherfucker is those drinks better be free Jody Jarrett you hearing this the drinks better be free

[13:15] But I think Stern is looking at the show is like a moment to show the world

[13:19] What they can do you and they and they better for for fifteen thousand dollars Batman super early better be a

[13:27] Holy shit Batman like I've never seen anything like this moment when they pulled occurred and off of that thing

[13:33] And we have big expectations of what that game will be

[13:36] Something curious about that machine, you know, and you know, I think Stern is is gonna have to really show that they've up the game

[13:42] I asked my context. I was like look this is thinking to have like pdi glass or in busy glass or like rad cows

[13:49] Or it's gonna have like the cheap little decals they've been putting on machines that have been peeling I

[13:53] Hope they realize that for fifteen grand they better go up and down this thing and make sure everything is the best quality

[14:00] Possible and that means like I want rad cows on it. I mean those decals better be as good as the hobbit rad cows and

[14:07] The glass better be in busy glass or pdi glass ain't no regular glass going into a fifteen thousand on machine

[14:12] So if you want to charge the bucks of like a Ferrari or Bugatti

[14:16] You got to go through that thing and make sure everything is the highest possible material

[14:20] So are the other do you think Stern's worried? Do you guys think Stern is worried?

[14:25] So I I called up Gary Stern and said Gary are you worried about pat lawler's game being showed alongside of

[14:33] Ghostbusters and and here's what he said to me

[14:41] Yeah, so I don't think they're too worried about it

[14:45] The interesting thing too is gonna see what Jack prices this game at I am really curious

[14:52] It's not gonna be a wide body I heard that and I suppose to have a lot of innovation of it and it will have like this like sort of work with

[14:59] Your cell phone. I don't know but at the end of the day

[15:01] It's Jack and a price this thing around hobbit pricing. I don't think so I'm expecting this to be around ten grand

[15:08] I think the new Stern price model is gonna is gonna show Jack that there is more room to go up market with with these things and

[15:15] He's already got the quality there. He's already got the quality there

[15:18] So what are the other manufacturers probably thinking as they realize this is happening?

[15:23] I like I think one guy is probably a little nervous and I think the guy that's probably nervous right now is Andrew highway because

[15:31] Alien Ellie has been delayed a long time and

[15:36] He's you know, I think he showed people the play field artwork and was expecting that to create more hype and buzz and

[15:43] I don't think the orders flooded in the way he thought they would and and I'm sure

[15:48] He's really happy that orc is also in the Jersey Jack thread wishing that they sell a lot of pat lawler's original theme game

[15:58] Like I you know, I saw that I just like oh man like yeah

[16:02] Like let's just root on the competition who really could

[16:07] Is gonna impact highway's ability to survive as a company like and I get it as a fanboy

[16:13] You want to support Pimbal, but would you ever see Gary Stern going on and being like I really hope Jack sells as many games as he can and I really hope that

[16:21] Highway can get all those orders and no I

[16:25] Have said this you know, I wish I wish

[16:28] Orc would just realize he's a member of the highway team and and just behave that way

[16:33] I heard Andrew saw that post and and sent orc a voicemail and I was able to actually get a copy of it

[16:39] And this is what he said to him who stupid ignorant son of a bitch dumb bastard

[16:43] It's just been funny watching Andrew and Orc just never be on the same page throughout this entire process

[16:49] But look here's a deal I'm looking forward to seeing alien, but I think Andrew's nervous

[16:53] I think he's got to be nervous because he's put a timeframe in people's heads that you are gonna have your alien alien

[16:59] November or you're gonna have it and

[17:02] Expo is gonna show people pins that are going to raise the bar have a lot of innovation and

[17:08] Expectations are through the roof for all of these titles and

[17:13] Let's be honest. There is not room. I don't think for all of these titles

[17:18] And we're not even gonna talk about attack from Mars remake. There's not room for all of these titles to succeed

[17:24] There is no way collectors can jump at so many expensive new inboxes in such a short period of time

[17:30] There's gonna be winners and there's gonna be losers, okay?

[17:33] And that is a fact if everyone thinks that all these companies are gonna be around and be able to survive and be healthy

[17:41] With so much volume of new stuff that's that's all competing for the same dollars. You're dead wrong

[17:46] Okay, so aliens is a great theme though like the theme is there the

[17:51] The expectations for the pennies through the roof when they talk about what they're doing with the music and

[17:56] Emerson you and the alien world and sort of like this space horror game. I mean we're all excited to see what it's gonna be

[18:02] But the thing is this and I said it with with Pat Lawler's game delays equal death in this new climate of

[18:10] Chasing dollars and if Andrew shows alien Ellie and

[18:15] Says it's gonna be out in November it better be out in November and if it does in and if there's more delays

[18:22] Then I think they are going to be

[18:24] Focked if they make people wait into 2017

[18:28] Because the train is not gonna stop with stern games on it going towards people's homes and if Jack can swoop in with with

[18:38] Lawler's game and and get it and and get it assembled and get it to people I

[18:44] Think it's gonna be really really hard for Andrew highway to sort of survive with those two guys with their factories pumping out games

[18:52] Because let's be honest full throttles are not like flying out the door and Andrew's got a factory set up

[18:59] And we're not even gonna talk about home pin and that factory in China

[19:02] But all of these different companies popping up with overhead if you're not shipping

[19:08] You're failing you're losing money times are gonna get tough and

[19:13] And look we hope it ships. We're gonna hold Andrew to his word that in November

[19:18] I want to see people opening up alien pinball machines and if that happens I think

[19:25] It's awesome, right? I think people have waited long enough for this pin. I hope what we see is amazing at expo

[19:32] But again delays are gonna equal death and with the last thing I'll say about this

[19:38] Is I if we hear that the delay is because of Fox?

[19:43] I think that's a bullshit excuse. There's no way that Fox would hold this up and

[19:49] It's all about them getting enough money to put the games on the assembly line and order the parts because we've seen

[19:57] That it is really easy to reveal a game and really hard to ship a game

[20:02] Dutch pinball anybody all right now. Let's talk about

[20:05] Batman 66 a little bit

[20:07] I think we unanimously agree that the application process for Batman 66 is one of the most idiotic and

[20:16] Polarizing and disruptive things that has ever come out of stern pinball that has ever even happened in the entire world of pinball marketing

[20:24] That being said we know Jodi we know Jarrett we know Gary

[20:30] These guys love to fuck with us a little bit and this whole thing is

[20:35] meant to keep people talking they knew that this would in rage

[20:40] pinside and it's doing its job you guys can't stop talking about it and as much as you're like well

[20:48] It's into bad thing but but but that sold out of the L. These sold out of the super L. These the premiums are gonna fly out the shelves with this theme

[20:56] So that's a thing they're fucking with you guys

[21:01] They're trolling the community they're doing something smart the real

[21:07] Genesis of this whole thing is to collect consumer data so they know who's got money and who doesn't and they can they can start selling really high and pins

[21:16] To their to their customers with cheddar and let me tell you something and you might not want to believe this pinside

[21:23] but

[21:24] Since stern has dad at a back this pinside moaning and groaning complaining and a few pinside owners complaining don't mean shit to their business if

[21:34] pinside

[21:35] People are upset. It's not gonna

[21:37] Impact stern sales as much as people go on there like I'm not buying another stern new backs

[21:41] There are thousands of people who buy every stern pinball machine thousands and they're the same 50 dingbats on

[21:50] Pinside who debated every day you know who doesn't buy a stern new in box ever is crazy levy and yet he's on there with his opinions about it

[21:59] You think they give a shit about his opinion on machines?

[22:02] He still thinks stars is better than ghostbusters. Maybe it is. I'm not gonna get into that argument

[22:07] But that's the whole thing is like this application is stupid. It's silly. I

[22:11] Am I want to make a video? I wish I had more time. I want mine to be really funny

[22:16] But we'll see I I think it's going to be

[22:21] Fun saying people upload their odd their videos pleading and begging but we've heard we've heard from everybody that we think it's stupid

[22:28] Here's the thing. I'm in the Batman threat. I'm reading it and and stern leaked some of the artwork

[22:35] That's gonna be in the machine and it comes from the artist Chris Franchi who is by far

[22:42] One of the best Batman artists out there and his Batman 66 artwork is herald it as being

[22:48] Fucking amazing and what happens right first of all like stern leaks it and they're like here like leaks

[22:54] No, it's not a leak if you put it out

[22:57] I I just love stern marketing like they they try so hard to be so like sneaky and whoa look at we did

[23:05] But you did it like it's not a leak was like when the ghostbusters artwork leaked and it went everywhere and what did they do?

[23:11] They try to shut that down delete every thread with it. That's a leak

[23:15] This is you just releasing images. Okay, so the images come out and what happens at first people are like oh that's it looks great

[23:24] Because you know what it does look great Chris Franchi's Batman art is is fucking incredible

[23:29] But then people start bitching because they realize that these are images that were drawn before for other

[23:38] purposes and that they're using Photoshop to arrange the images

[23:44] to work with Pimbal and

[23:46] It got to the point where like people are like putting images side by side with with one of his the original drawing and how

[23:53] How stern is touched up a bit with with contours and shading and whatnot and people are complaining and they're saying for this much money

[24:00] We want original hand drawn art. We want original hand drawn art

[24:05] All right

[24:06] Shut up inside babies like nothing will satisfy you. I just feel like I wish I wasn't

[24:13] banned from

[24:15] Pinside so I can put up the Game of Thrones artwork next to what we're seeing with Batman

[24:20] Stern has learned it's less than you ding bats, right?

[24:23] They have understood that the game with a great theme needs a great art package and they're not gonna put something out there

[24:30] That sucks, but here's the thing too if there is tons of assets available from one of the greatest Batman artists ever

[24:38] And they can use them and they work perfectly for being on a pinball playfield

[24:43] Why not are you really gonna pay this guy tons of money to go redraw

[24:49] Stuff that can work perfectly

[24:52] For your purposes and look let's be honest. It's a fucking pinball machine. All right. You got back glass

[24:58] You got the cabinet you got the playfield and you got the plastics it it's not exactly like

[25:05] Pinball artwork is drawn to sink up perfectly with like the inserts and the plastics and all that shit

[25:13] I mean come on

[25:15] Look at look at um look at the hobbits playfield gorgeous. That's all

[25:21] Photo shopped or all of it

[25:24] None of that is drawn and look how amazing it looks

[25:28] Okay, so I think Photoshop gets this bad rap because we saw game of thrones. We've seen crappy Stern Photoshop jobs

[25:36] We've seen aliens Photoshop job which just literally looks like clip art dropped on a background of space not very

[25:44] Innovative not very sexy not very incredible

[25:47] But look let's let's give Stern the benefit of the doubt here and wait as we see the full package

[25:52] But the artworks incredible so they're taking artwork that was done for purpose a and they're putting it on purpose

[25:58] B and people are bitching and moaning and groaning and it just goes to show it's like

[26:03] Pinside people some of them are just joyless

[26:06] Joyless souls they're joyless adult they're joyless individuals who will find every single reason to complain

[26:12] And I love it too because all the people bitching about the art none of them are probably buying the game

[26:17] So let me just run into this thread

[26:19] Let me run into this party and just complain because I wasn't even invited or because I don't even want to be here

[26:26] And I think it's stupid and I think you guys look absolutely silly for bitching about this thing

[26:31] so I

[26:32] Think we have to wait and see the full package but from what we've seen so far it looks really good

[26:38] All right, so the other aspect of Batman 66 and we've talked about this. I'm not gonna be the dead horse

[26:44] You know we've all shared our thoughts on the pricing and Stern is baked in the the second hand market pricing into the game itself

[26:51] And so for that reason and that reason I am just going to make a proclamation that I think is a good one

[26:57] But flipping pinball machines is now dead it is dead

[27:00] There is no money to be made anywhere in this market now flipping pinball machines

[27:05] I even saw a Rob Zombie

[27:08] From spooky new inbox for like 6900 just sitting sitting unsolved and

[27:16] You know a year ago

[27:18] That game would have sold for 8 grand immediately 7 grand immediately it's sitting and

[27:24] This is the new market and I think it's a good one because here's why like we've all been idiots and we've all who have

[27:31] Those of us who collect and want to buy something new in box

[27:33] We all cannot help it think oh, I'll just get one and I'll buy it and I won't lose money on it and maybe I'll make money on it

[27:41] Right that's been sort of like the mindset and people got burned or they got burned on they got burned on X-Men

[27:46] Ellie they got burned on Transformers Ellie they got burned on

[27:51] Avengers you right they got burned on kiss I mean they have those are juggernaut themes that you and I almost went in on kiss

[27:57] Ellie because I saw the artwork. I'm like oh hand drawn art from the original artist

[28:01] Game looks amazing when it was just photos. How can I go wrong?

[28:04] I'll send it to pinball refinery they'll deck it out and I'll be able to sell it people are always gonna want this game

[28:09] It's gonna be so rare and Ellie kiss

[28:11] Yeah, look at today. I would have lost two grand

[28:14] But with the prices where they're at now. There's nowhere to go up. There's nowhere to go up on any of these things

[28:19] Mark my words in 18 months Batman super early is we'll be selling for $10,000 people who bought them will lose $5,000

[28:25] I do not think they're gonna be worth 20 25 30

[28:29] They would if they only made 30 Batman

[28:32] Super Ellie's or bat if they've turned only made 30 limited edition Batman games to celebrate their 30th anniversary in charge 15 grand

[28:41] And that's it no Ellie's no premiums just 30 examples of it. Yes, then you can charge 16 grand

[28:49] But the fact that they

[28:51] Are making two fifth 240 Ellie's and then unlimited premium which they confirmed on Facebook

[28:57] We will make these premiums as long as people want them which could be the next five years means the super Ellie will still be the same exact game

[29:05] As the premium good luck thinking that game is gonna hold its value and keep going up and up

[29:10] No, it's not and and we all see the way hype goes in this industry the hype is gonna die

[29:15] Well before that 18 month period is up so I think the the Ellie is probably the way to go on it

[29:23] I don't think the super Ellie is gonna hold its value, but I think for the people buying it

[29:27] It's gonna mean a lot to them. It's gonna be special to them

[29:31] It's gonna have a special story and they probably won't be selling them a lot

[29:35] I think you're not gonna see many super Ellie's on the second hand market

[29:39] So look here's what I'm gonna do because this podcast is at 30 minutes and I don't want to bury the message from my master at the end of this

[29:47] Podcast instead I want to I'm gonna put up a separate sort of like special edition podcast right after this that just goes into that

[29:55] So you guys can hear that I want to end this podcast with a couple thoughts

[30:00] one being

[30:02] the black night and

[30:04] When I interview Chris and when I talk to him about stuff it is really an incredible experience because the guy has been collecting machines for so long

[30:13] And out of all the people I interview and I always get good comments and feedback on the people I interview

[30:19] People always write in and just say I could listen to that guy talk about Pimball for hours

[30:24] And I love having a mom and I think podcasts is a great format for Chris to talk about Pimball because I see I'm

[30:31] Pinside he you know he tries to educate people

[30:34] He tries to tell people the reality of what's happening and oftentimes he is met with anger

[30:40] He is met with resentment he's met with down votes because people don't want to hear it

[30:45] Like when he comes in and says look if full throttle is not selling well and alien can't ship

[30:52] In a decent amount of time and isn't a home run. There's no way highway is gonna survive

[30:56] People are like fuck you

[30:58] Don't say that

[31:00] But it's like wouldn't shouldn't you be asking those tough questions of someone you're just handing

[31:07] Thousands of dollars to right people didn't ask those questions of J-pop

[31:12] So look we love talking to Chris and if you have topics that you would love to hear Chris talk about

[31:18] Please email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[31:22] And I'll happily discuss with him what our next episode could be because I think they're great

[31:28] And my goal is to hopefully do and at least like once a month where we can sort of just go down and talk about

[31:35] Interesting pinball stories from the past and even you know how it relates to what's going on in the future

[31:40] And I think he's gonna have some great opinions about what comes out of expo as will the rest of us

[31:45] And I'd love to sort of collect his thoughts on that and we will we will we love having them on the show

[31:50] Another email I got and I just want to pull this up because I want to I want to make sure that

[31:56] this person

[31:58] Gets credit for sort of waking me up to something that I've been doing that that I agree with is is a mistake that I've been making on this pinball podcast now

[32:08] Hold on one second. I'm just going into my thing hold on

[32:13] Okay, and this is from Aaron Nicholas who's a listener of the show Aaron. Thank you for writing to me

[32:20] And Aaron basically said to me is like look he's like Chris

[32:24] I love your podcast you talk a lot about the new games, but I got to say like I think it's a misstep on your part to constantly be like

[32:32] Crapping on the old titles like attack from Mars the Adams family twilight zone theater of magic

[32:39] Because those machines are incredible. They're the whole reason why we're at where we are today

[32:45] And I think you shouldn't dismiss them so much in your podcast and I do and I agree with I agree with Aaron

[32:51] There are points where I'm like no one gives a shit about those titles. No one's gonna care as all the new stuff is coming out

[32:58] And I think he's right and he even said he's like dude

[33:01] You're like a hypocrite you have a tales of the Arabian Knights with all of what's out there the game that really

[33:07] Called to you was towed in and you want it one and so

[33:13] Like he's like, you know, shouldn't do it

[33:15] I want to say Aaron. Thank you for that note and I will do

[33:20] my best to

[33:22] not

[33:23] Talk smack about games the past and also how to better incorporate these games from yesterday years into what we talk about on the show

[33:31] I will admit that most of what I focus on is what's new what's coming out and the collector market and yes

[33:39] Yes, I know that these games are highly sought after and I will say this

[33:43] As all of these new games sort of collide on top of each other and new collectors come into the hobby

[33:49] It's gonna be harder and harder and harder to find a nice condition

[33:53] Toden right a really nice condition

[33:57] Adams family these games are they're not making more of them and a lot of them were beat to shit and

[34:02] The amount of people out there with the knowledge and the skill set to fix these games to restore these games

[34:09] Is gonna get more and more limited as time goes on because these new guys?

[34:14] They don't even know how to change a switch right so

[34:17] Aaron thank you for that note and I want to end this podcast by saying

[34:22] When I asked you guys to go on iTunes and leave me some feedback

[34:27] I got one one and here I am with

[34:32] over 500 listeners per episode and I got one new review guys

[34:39] Fuck that give me some feedback alright if you have time do it

[34:45] I'm gonna be at expo I might even make some Canadian pinball podcast t-shirts if you guys want one email me at canada pinball at gmail.com

[34:53] All right, so that's it for episode

[34:56] 56 of Canadian pinball podcasts super excited to see what happens in the next three weeks and

[35:01] Look out for my special edition podcast to come out shortly after this one have a great Thursday everyone play some pinball

[35:08] Their toys oh I almost forgot there's a rumor that J-pop might bring his game magic girl finished to expo

[35:15] And I heard that he called up frolic after I heard that rumor and he left this message and we're gonna end this podcast on what John

[35:22] Papa Duke told the frolic when he heard that frolic is saying he might bring the game to expo

[35:30] Ladies first
