[00:00] The boys are back in town boys are back in town

[00:07] I'm so blown away. We started today with a 172 Patreon contributors. We are now at a

[00:16] 186 in just one day. We're getting close. And for those of you who are new, welcome to the

[00:24] Canadian Club. There are now 13 and a half episodes of Canadian Club waiting for you. So go

[00:30] enjoy them. And this is going to be a really short one because as you know, this is part two

[00:36] to the Chicago gaming company exclusive that I'm going to give you right now. On part one,

[00:42] we talked about Lyman Sheets. The greatest coder in Pimball history is joining CGC to work on as a

[00:50] consultant, the game Cactus Canyon. He's also going to make his own version of Cactus Canyon

[00:58] at a later date or some enhanced version of the game. Now I said there's going to be somebody

[01:04] out there in the Pimball world who is partnered up with Lyman Sheets on this endeavor.

[01:10] Someone else who you know by name who is going to be joining the Chicago gaming company family.

[01:18] And this company is getting ready. I think to be one of the biggest players in Pimball, I think

[01:24] they're going to be the biggest threat to Jersey Jack Pimball. Jersey Jack can have Steve Richie,

[01:29] a guy that has made a great game in a really long time. But this company, Chicago gaming company

[01:35] now has two very, very well known and notable figures in the world of gaming and Pimball. So

[01:44] the person who is joining Lyman Sheets to be his sort of like Batman and Robin. I'm not sure who's

[01:50] Batman. I'm not sure who's Robin in this analogy. The person who will also be much more involved

[01:56] in CGC moving forward is no other than the son of the man who saved Pimball. Mr. Josh Sharp.

[02:07] So Josh Sharp will be joining CGC as well. Now you know Josh Sharp. He's Zach Sharp's brother

[02:14] and he's Roger Sharp's son. And it's interesting, right? Because Stern Pimball has Zach as their

[02:20] sort of marketing manager. And Roger is working with I believe American Pimball on getting them

[02:27] licensed themes. And now we have Josh Sharp, who I believe is over at Roth Thrills and doing a

[02:34] lot with Roth Thrills. He is now going to be working with Chicago gaming company. And he has

[02:39] been working with Lyman Sheets and they've been consulting on the code for cactus canyon reme.

[02:45] He's working with Lyman Sheets and he's going to get much more involved in all things Chicago

[02:51] gaming company. There will be a press release that goes out Monday from Ryan White and CGC saying

[03:00] all this. But you heard it here first on Canadian Club that Josh Sharp, I always want to say Zach

[03:06] Sharp. Josh Sharp and Lyman Sheets are now part of the CGC family. Wow. It's going to be a really,

[03:14] really awesome 2022 for Chicago gaming company. I think they have Pulp Fiction. I think they've

[03:21] got cactus canyon right around the corner. They also have a Ben Heck game and Ben Heck keeps telling

[03:26] me that so much is going to be inside this machine. I'm also hearing that there might be a

[03:32] Kapow title that is a CGC game. Is that possible? Could we see a Kapow CGC title? We shall see.

[03:40] But you're not going to hear these news, rumors and speculation anywhere else. But Canadian

[03:46] Spinball podcast. I also said on the earlier show that I do know Eric Minier's next game. And maybe,

[03:53] if we hit 300 contributors, I will let everybody know. That's a long ways off. We're only at 186.

[04:01] But it is a good goal to aim for. I'm super exhausted, ladies and gentlemen. I do multiple Facebook

[04:08] lives almost a day. I do multiple pinball podcasts a week. I super love doing this. I love doing it

[04:15] for all you guys out there. I have a lot of fun merchandise coming. I'm going to be at Expo.

[04:21] And this is going to be a really short edition of Canadian Club. But for those of you who have

[04:26] been in the club, they're usually not this short. This is just part two to part one. Now, the reason

[04:32] why I broke it up. And I'm a little bit annoyed because Ryan White told me to not mention Josh

[04:38] Sharp today. And he's like, I will get you information by the late afternoon. It is now 8.54 PM.

[04:47] And he never sent me anything. And Ryan always does this to me. Remember, Ryan White said to me,

[04:54] Lyman Sheets is not working with CGC. I have it. I screen grabbed it. And now, what am I here to tell

[04:59] you that Lyman Sheets is working for CGC. So which one is it, Ryan? Which one is it? And I like

[05:06] him. He's a good guy. We will talk for a really long time. But sometimes when it comes to actually

[05:12] talking to Canada with journalistic integrity, he always seems to like go in these weird directions.

[05:18] Like don't tell me you're going to have information for me by late afternoon. And then you just never

[05:25] send anything. So maybe late afternoon is midnight in his book. But to me, late afternoon, Brenda,

[05:31] what's late afternoon? Like four o'clock, three o'clock? What? Three o'clock. I think three o'clock is

[05:37] late afternoon. It's definitely not 9 PM. Early, this is early evening, right? This would have been

[05:43] early evening. You're right. You're right. Absolutely right. Everybody, I love you. Thanks for

[05:48] contributing a lot more fun stuff coming to the club members. You guys are the best. We're going to

[05:53] smash past 300. And everyone's going to know what Eric Minier's next game is. Right now, Jersey

[05:58] Jack is having like a crisis meeting being like who told Canada? Who told Canada? And does he really

[06:04] know what it is? And they're going to know it. Expo because I'm going to whisper it in all of their

[06:08] ears when I see them in Chicago later, everybody.
