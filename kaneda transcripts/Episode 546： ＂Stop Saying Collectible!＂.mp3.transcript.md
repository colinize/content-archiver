[00:00] I believe in a big call up just a terrible call

[00:04] Cause the chance we can make it now

[00:06] In the business I guess too

[00:08] I believe in a big call up

[00:14] Welcome to episode 456 of Canada Spinball Podcast

[00:18] The one pinball podcast that guarantees it will grow on you

[00:22] Trust me, listen to Canada enough

[00:24] And I will start to grow on you

[00:26] So I want to talk about one specific thing

[00:28] On this episode of Canada Spinball Podcast

[00:30] I'm standing up right now because I'm so charged about this topic

[00:34] And the topic is this

[00:36] The word collectibility

[00:38] I want us in this hobby to stop throwing around this word so much

[00:42] That every single game that comes out that is scarce

[00:46] That is rare, that there won't be many of them

[00:48] Is going to be a collectible in the pinball world

[00:50] I don't think people even understand the pathway to collectibility

[00:56] To talk about that right now

[00:58] But first I want to read a post that someone put up

[01:00] That really just shows me that people don't get it

[01:04] Now don't fall victim to these manufacturers trying to convince you

[01:08] That if they just make a limited number of these games

[01:12] Today, that those games will be collectibles in the future

[01:16] It doesn't work that way

[01:18] And I want to read a post by Mr. Dave Peck

[01:20] And Dave ordered a Raza machine from Deeproot

[01:24] Following, I just ordered one of these

[01:26] I'm scared though

[01:28] Somebody hold me

[01:30] I'm always scared of the startups

[01:32] But I think it's pretty cool and innovative

[01:34] And they're going to stop taking orders December 30th

[01:36] And what is ordered by then

[01:38] With a max of 300

[01:40] Is all you will ever see of Raza after that

[01:44] So I think it's going to be pretty collectible

[01:48] Fingers crossed

[01:50] Now this mentality, it's not just shared by Dave

[01:52] There are people out there in the Pimbal collecting world that think this is accurate

[01:56] But if you only make a limited number of stuff

[02:00] It will be collectible and I'm here to tell you right now

[02:02] You are 100,000% wrong

[02:06] Mr. Dave Peck

[02:08] Anyone who thinks this is absolutely wrong

[02:10] If this were true

[02:12] Then Celts would be collectible

[02:14] Then Team Pimbal's the mafia would be collectible

[02:16] Then Cosmic Carnival would be collectible

[02:20] The full throttle would be collectible

[02:22] The list would go on and on and on

[02:24] Of limited run games

[02:26] That nobody cares about

[02:28] WWE, Ellie would be collectible

[02:30] Here's what makes something collectible

[02:32] It's not some arbitrary manufactured scarcity

[02:36] That these companies are trying to do

[02:38] If you think about the things in life that people collect

[02:40] Just think about your own life

[02:42] What you collect

[02:44] Let me tell you the things I collect

[02:46] I collect old school Japanese arcade cabinets right now

[02:48] I have a Capcom Mini-Cute and I have a Neo Geo SC-19

[02:52] These games came out in the 90s

[02:54] In arcades in Japan

[02:56] I'll tell you why they're collectible right now

[02:58] For a few reason

[03:00] First reason, most importantly

[03:02] Is they are based on stuff that people love

[03:04] That millions of people love

[03:06] Millions of people love the Capcom fighting games

[03:08] Millions of people love the Neo Geo system

[03:10] It's held up as one of the greatest arcade systems

[03:14] And greatest home consoles of all time

[03:16] And it has a huge fan base, okay?

[03:18] So the product itself is stellar and has a fan base

[03:22] It's like Star Wars, people collect Star Wars stuff

[03:34] Back from the 80s, you are going to have something that millions of people would love to have

[03:38] Because it reminds them of their childhood

[03:40] I used to collect Transformers same thing

[03:44] I now collect Akira stuff because I love Kaneda

[03:46] And guess what? Millions of people love Akira

[03:48] It is a property that has a fan base

[03:50] Now let me ask you a question

[03:52] Where's the Raza fan base?

[03:54] How many people love Raza?

[03:56] How many people love KELTS?

[03:58] How many people love Fault Rado

[04:00] Most of these games are based on things that people don't even care about from a theme level alone

[04:06] And right there you can end the conversation

[04:08] They won't be collectible

[04:10] Because there's no fan base built in

[04:12] Okay, but you don't need an IP to create a fan base

[04:16] If we think about some of the other pinball machines that are collectible

[04:20] That became collectible

[04:21] Games like Medieval Madness

[04:23] Games like Attack from Mars

[04:24] Games like Monster Bash

[04:26] Games like Cactus Canyon

[04:27] Why did those games become collectible?

[04:29] The answer is so simple

[04:31] Because they're amazing games

[04:33] They are amazing games that people who love pinball saw how incredible these pinball games are

[04:39] They were not collectible on day one

[04:42] When those machines came out

[04:43] There were not people ordering them

[04:45] Keeping them in box and waiting 20 years until the value went up

[04:49] Because they were collectible

[04:50] They were opened up by operators

[04:52] They were put on location

[04:53] And for so many years

[04:54] People played those games, enjoyed them

[04:57] And then threw them away

[04:58] They were thrown in dumpsters

[04:59] Nobody thought to collect them

[05:01] They were basically just meant to be

[05:03] A great game

[05:05] During a period of time in pinball in which they were released to the world in the 90s

[05:09] Now we started collecting them later on

[05:12] Like maybe a decade or more later

[05:15] When people realized a few things

[05:17] There weren't many of them in good condition left in the world

[05:20] Most of them were routed and beat up

[05:23] So if you had a great condition Medieval Madness

[05:26] It became collectible

[05:28] But all of these games were great

[05:30] They first had to prove that they were worth owning

[05:33] That they were worth playing

[05:35] They established themselves

[05:37] As something that is worth collecting

[05:39] What has Raza established itself as

[05:42] What has full throttle established itself as

[05:45] If you were to ask me

[05:46] This kind of mentality

[05:48] And this way to approach the hobby is all flawed

[05:51] And I'm telling you

[05:52] Stern also was trying to do this

[05:54] Stern wants people to believe

[05:55] That their LEDs of their stern machines

[05:58] Are going to be collectible

[05:59] And the truth is most of them will not be

[06:02] Most of you who are investing heavily in Stern LEDs

[06:05] And buying up every new stern machine they make

[06:07] The truth is there are so many of them

[06:09] There are a dime a dozen

[06:11] They're found everywhere

[06:12] And sure you might have an LED version of the game

[06:14] But as people have said it

[06:16] At $10,000 or $9,000

[06:19] 500 of these games at $10,000

[06:22] Is more than enough games

[06:23] If you want to find one you can find one

[06:25] Remember back in the day

[06:27] These pinball machines came out

[06:28] And they were like $2,000

[06:30] And nobody collected them

[06:32] And they got discarded

[06:33] And that's why you saw things like minival madness

[06:36] Get all the way up to like 12 to 15,000 dollars 10 years ago

[06:41] For a pristine example of the game

[06:43] Because just none of them existed

[06:45] Because nobody had the foresight

[06:47] To buy them and hold on to them

[06:49] For 10 plus years or 20 years

[06:50] And I think some of the companies nowadays

[06:52] Are trying to bank on this

[06:54] That if you buy a raza

[06:55] If you buy a big Lebowski

[06:57] If you buy a new alien pinball machine

[06:59] It's going to be a collectible

[07:02] It's going to be something that other people want

[07:04] That they're going to offer you more money than you paid for it

[07:06] And I'm here to tell you that's not the case

[07:08] I was looking on eBay last night

[07:10] A big Lebowski auction went up

[07:12] For $13,000

[07:13] That's only $1,000 more than you could buy it new from Dutch pinball

[07:17] And guess how many bids

[07:19] The big Lebowski got on that eBay auction when it ended

[07:22] It got zero bids

[07:24] People are waking up to this fact

[07:26] That these things are not what we think they are

[07:30] For a game to become collectible

[07:32] For a game to become special

[07:34] The first thing it has to do

[07:36] Is be amazing as a pinball game

[07:39] If you were to ask me

[07:40] The games that are going to be collectibles

[07:43] Are the games that are great

[07:44] Games like Pirates of the Caribbean

[07:46] Collector's Edition over at Jersey Jack

[07:49] They're never making more of them

[07:50] There's only 200 in the world

[07:53] Eric Minier has established himself

[07:55] He's one of the greatest pinball designers of our time right now

[07:58] So if you're going to collect something

[08:00] Chances are the things people are going to seek out

[08:03] If you think about it 10 years from now

[08:05] What games are people going to seek out

[08:07] They're probably going to seek out Eric Minier's games

[08:09] They're probably going to seek out Keith Ellwyn's games

[08:12] Why?

[08:13] Because those are the two greatest designers

[08:15] Happening in pinball right now

[08:16] The same way you seek out now

[08:19] Pat Lawler's games of yesteryears

[08:21] John Papaduke's games of yesteryears

[08:23] Some of these designers

[08:25] Their best stuff is well behind them

[08:27] And you know it and I know it

[08:29] And even they know it

[08:30] Okay

[08:31] So you look at a game like Guns n' Roses Collector's Edition

[08:34] There's only going to be 500

[08:35] Is that a game that's going to be collectible

[08:38] And I'm here to tell you

[08:39] Yes it will

[08:39] Because not because they're only making 500

[08:42] Here are the two reasons why

[08:43] Guns n' Roses Collector's Edition

[08:45] Is going to be something that people collect

[08:47] It's going to be something that goes up in value

[08:49] And it's going to be something that holds value

[08:52] And becomes an item of prestige

[08:55] For many many years to come

[08:56] And the answer is just two things

[08:58] One, it's a masterpiece

[09:00] The game is a freaking masterpiece

[09:02] Two, they're only making 500 of a Guns n' Roses pinball machine

[09:07] Guns n' Roses has hundreds of millions of fans around the world

[09:12] So they have this huge fan base

[09:14] That would love to own something

[09:15] And it's got the iconic music that's never going to grow old

[09:18] It's never going to grow old

[09:20] And the game itself is a masterpiece

[09:21] So you can buy those two things

[09:23] And there's never going to be a period in time

[09:26] In which Guns n' Roses Collector's Edition

[09:28] Ever sell for below 12-5

[09:30] There's never going to be a period in time

[09:32] In which the demand for GNR is less than the supply of it

[09:37] Okay? But again

[09:38] I wouldn't even buy Guns n' Roses right now

[09:41] With that mentality

[09:42] I would buy the game because you love Guns n' Roses

[09:45] That is the only reason for you to own a Guns n' Roses pinball machine

[09:50] Is if you love Guns n' Roses

[09:51] Not because you want a collectible

[09:53] Not because you want to make money in two years

[09:55] It's such a stupid way to do it

[09:57] Buy something because you love it

[09:59] Life is very very short

[10:01] It's very very short

[10:02] I am right now awaiting a Neo Geo Cabinet that is being created for me

[10:07] Or restored for me by an amazing guy over in France

[10:09] And he's suffering through a medical issue

[10:11] And I'm watching this guy

[10:13] He's a warrior

[10:13] He's battling through every day

[10:15] And he's still engaged in the things that he loves

[10:18] And I'm looking at this dude

[10:19] And I'm like this guy gets it

[10:21] Like he appreciates life

[10:22] Life is really short

[10:24] Why would you buy something

[10:26] Simply to make a quick buck on it

[10:28] If you're not going to enjoy it

[10:29] Because the money is going to go quickly

[10:31] Let me tell you how fast that thousand dollars would go

[10:33] It would go in one meal with me in New York City

[10:35] I would take you to an Omokassi restaurant

[10:37] We would order some expensive bottles of Saki

[10:39] And we would get the chef's tasting menu

[10:41] And your money would be gone in one meal

[10:44] That's how fast it goes

[10:45] But if you buy something you love

[10:47] And you buy a game that brings you happiness every day

[10:50] Here's what you can't do

[10:52] You can't put a price on that

[10:54] And nobody can take that from you

[10:56] So stop looking at games like Raza and saying

[10:59] Oh fingers crossed

[11:00] I hope it's going to be a collectible

[11:02] If that's the way you're going into a game like Raza

[11:05] You're broken already

[11:06] Your mentality is broken

[11:08] You should buy Raza because the game itself speaks to you

[11:12] Because the game itself looks like something you would love

[11:15] Because the game itself looks like something you will enjoy to play

[11:19] And when I'm hearing people talk about games like Raza

[11:21] I'm not hearing that

[11:22] I'm hearing this

[11:23] Oh it's going to be a rare J-pop game

[11:25] And it's going to be worth something

[11:26] As someone who spent 23 thousand dollars on a broken magic girl

[11:31] I can tell you right now

[11:32] I learned my lesson

[11:34] It's no fun

[11:35] Owning that rare game that's not any good to play

[11:38] It's no fun looking at that thing every day

[11:41] And being reminded that this guy

[11:43] Can never complete a project

[11:45] That this guy ripped off so many people

[11:47] It was no fun

[11:48] And I couldn't wait to the day came

[11:51] Where I could sell it to someone who would actually see the value in it

[11:54] Now it ended up going to a pinball museum

[11:57] And that makes sense

[11:58] That's where that game belongs

[12:00] It's a conversation piece

[12:01] Inside a museum of tons of titles

[12:04] In which you can stop and say

[12:06] Oh yeah look that's the magic girl

[12:08] Because it is a moment in pinball history

[12:10] But man I wouldn't want to own it

[12:11] And it brings no joy

[12:13] If you're owning that machine to play it

[12:15] And that's the thing is

[12:16] I don't even think people know

[12:18] With a lot of these new machines

[12:19] That they think are going to be collectibles

[12:21] They don't even know if the game's going to be enjoyable in six months

[12:24] There's no instant collectible

[12:25] There's just not

[12:26] Even Guns and Roses' history

[12:29] Is not yet determined

[12:30] We will see

[12:31] Will people get tired of it?

[12:32] Will people bore of it?

[12:34] If you love Guns and Roses

[12:35] There's nothing that would ever bore you

[12:37] Of GNR

[12:38] And I just think there's enough GNR fans

[12:40] To keep this game collectible

[12:41] So here's my final point

[12:42] Alright we're almost at Christmas time

[12:44] And I just saw this

[12:45] And I wanted to do a quick show about this word collectible

[12:48] Don't buy something in pinball

[12:50] Because you think it's going to be a collectible

[12:52] Buy a game because it's a game for you

[12:55] Buy a game because you love it

[12:57] If it happens to become collectible over the years

[12:59] Then great

[13:00] You won

[13:01] You won on two fronts

[13:02] You won because you got a game you love

[13:04] And it held its value

[13:05] So if you ever want to get rid of it

[13:07] You win win

[13:08] Okay great win win situation

[13:09] But what's going on right now

[13:11] Is this arbitrary manufactured scarcity

[13:14] Around games that haven't proven

[13:16] They're any good or not

[13:17] Around companies that we don't even know

[13:18] Are going to be around for a very long time

[13:20] And everyone's trying to pretend

[13:22] That they've got the next collectible

[13:24] We're only going to make 200 keels

[13:25] Do you hear that?

[13:26] In the marketing around keels

[13:28] We're only going to make 200

[13:29] Man you're not going to sell 200 keels

[13:31] You could say that all you want

[13:33] But you know

[13:34] That there's not enough demand

[13:35] To make 200 keels

[13:37] And marketing is easily see through

[13:40] When marketing seems too good to be true

[13:42] It is

[13:42] Here's the best marketing

[13:44] I know I always go on and on about marketing and pinball

[13:46] But here's the truth

[13:47] You don't need to do marketing and pinball

[13:50] The marketing and pinball is a great game

[13:52] If you make a great game

[13:53] It will market itself

[13:54] It will sell itself

[13:56] It will attract people

[13:57] If you make a short run of a great game

[14:00] Yes, chances are

[14:01] People will want it

[14:02] And it will go up in value

[14:03] And it might one day be a collectible

[14:05] But you can't determine that as the company

[14:07] Just because you say we're only going to make this

[14:09] Doesn't mean it's special

[14:11] And we've seen the majority of times

[14:13] People try to use that fancy language

[14:15] It just doesn't come true

[14:16] Ah, can I take a breath?

[14:18] Okay, so let's just end this podcast by saying

[14:20] Texas Pinball Festival has been canceled

[14:22] We're not surprised by this

[14:23] With what's going on in the world

[14:25] It was the smart thing to do by Ed

[14:26] It was the responsible thing to do by Ed

[14:28] And so we look forward to seeing TPS 2022

[14:32] It's crazy

[14:32] Now the one thing I will say

[14:34] And I've told this to Jeff

[14:35] I don't know why the Twippies

[14:36] Are it still aligned with the timing of TPS

[14:39] When there is no TPS

[14:41] It always feels like forever and a day

[14:44] Between the Twippy Voting opening up on January 1st

[14:47] And then the show itself is mid to late March

[14:50] It's just so long away

[14:51] By the time we get to the Twippy's Avengers

[14:53] Is an eight month old game

[14:55] That being said

[14:56] That being said

[14:57] Come January 1st

[14:59] January 2nd

[14:59] Don't forget to vote for

[15:01] Canadus Pinball Podcast

[15:02] For your favorite pinball podcast

[15:03] And I think the way we should vote

[15:05] And I didn't want to say this

[15:06] But whatever you can do what you want

[15:08] I'm not going to make you vote a certain way

[15:10] But with this new weighted system

[15:11] In which they're trying to make it easier

[15:14] For other people to get Canadus Trophy

[15:16] Here's what I would ask all of you to do

[15:18] Unless you absolutely want to put down your second and third

[15:21] Favorite pinball podcast

[15:22] Only one person is going to win

[15:24] So it's a vote for your favorite pinball podcast

[15:26] So I would vote for Canada

[15:28] And then that's it

[15:29] Because if you put two and three into your votes

[15:32] You are actually helping someone

[15:34] Who you don't want to be your favorite

[15:36] Win the favorite award

[15:38] And I get it

[15:39] It's a weighted system

[15:40] I don't know why they're doing it this year

[15:41] But that's what I would recommend

[15:43] If you're a fan of Canada's Pinball Podcast

[15:44] Just put me down

[15:45] I'm your favorite

[15:46] And that's it

[15:47] Leave it at that

[15:47] Because it's an award for favorite

[15:49] It's not an award for second place

[15:50] It's not an award for third place

[15:52] Okay

[15:53] So thank you everybody for listening to Canada's Pinball Podcast

[16:27] It's not just going to be Jurassic Park

[16:28] Running away with it again

[16:30] So exciting, exciting time
