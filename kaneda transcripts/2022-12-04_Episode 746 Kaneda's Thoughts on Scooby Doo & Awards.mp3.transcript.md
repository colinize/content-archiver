[00:00] Scooby-Doo-Bee-Doo, where are you? We got some work to do now.

[00:10] Aw, so, Spooky Pinball's rumor title of Scooby-Doo turned out to be Scooby-Scooby-Doo.

[00:16] So, we are going to get a Scooby-Doo Pinball machine from Spooky Pinball, and I want to tell you right now.

[00:22] I think this is a perfect theme for Spooky Pinball.

[00:24] I know there are some people out there that are saying,

[00:26] Canada, when was the last time you watched a Scooby-Doo show? I don't care. I'm going to tell you right now.

[00:31] I grew up watching Scooby-Doo. Me and my twin brother probably watched thousands and thousands of episodes of Scooby-Doo as children.

[00:41] And you just don't fall out of love with Scooby. It's Scooby-Scooby-Doo.

[00:46] I mean, look, I want to talk to you on this episode of Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:50] Why I think this is a home run theme for Spooky Pinball.

[00:54] I also want to tell you why I think every single person in the Pinball community is going to wait and see first.

[01:01] We're not going to fall victim to some pre-order, non-refundable way to get this game.

[01:07] Because I think anyone who wants a Scooby-Doo is going to be able to get a Scooby-Doo.

[01:11] R-Row if you go in with the pre-order.

[01:14] Okay, so here's the thing. On theme alone, from a company called Spooky Pinball,

[01:19] Scooby-Doo, I understand the connection. It makes total sense.

[01:24] This comic that came out, or this animated cartoon series, came out in the 1960s.

[01:29] I didn't even realize Scooby-Doo is that old.

[01:32] It sort of came out like around the same time period as Batman 66.

[01:36] You know, when all these creatives were doing a lot of drugs and they cooked up really weird stuff,

[01:41] like the mystery machine and the van and Scooby-Doo and Scooby Snacks and these weird kids,

[01:46] solving mysteries and pulling off people's masks at the end of each episode.

[01:51] So here's why I love this theme, because it's colorful, because it's funny, because it's campy.

[01:58] Sometimes I think people in this hobby have forgotten what a pinball machine is supposed

[02:05] to make you do. It is supposed to make you smile from ear to ear. You are supposed to see a theme

[02:13] that invites you, that draws you in. I fully expect this game to be a world under glass.

[02:19] I fully expect, because they're already boasting about the amount of scopes in this game,

[02:23] but I think they're going to have a mansion underneath the glass. I think they're going

[02:27] to have the mystery machine van. I think they're going to have all of the Scooby-Doo elements

[02:31] that people are familiar with. It almost lends itself to becoming like Spooky Pinball's version

[02:37] of Elvira's latest game that Stern put out, with the big mansion and everything in it.

[02:42] And we know that Spooky can make some really nice scopes, like Alice Cooper's Nightmare Castle

[02:49] looked a lot like He-Man Castle Grayskull and it was a very cool looking game.

[02:53] Okay, so I think on theme alone, you've got this colorful campy theme. Then they're working with

[02:59] like Frank Welker and the other people who did the voices for Scooby-Doo. Like Frank did the

[03:04] voice for Fred all of these years, and I think we're going to get some of the greatest custom

[03:10] call-outs in the history of Pinball. Now, say what you will about Spooky and their hot glue gun

[03:15] madness. What they do do really well besides making the best playfields in all of Pinball,

[03:21] is they know how to create amazing call-outs that connect you to the theme itself. Like we saw in

[03:28] Rick and Morty, the best call-outs in all of Pinball. I think we're going to see a lot of amazing

[03:33] call-outs from the world of Scooby-Doo that's going to connect you to the Pinball experience.

[03:38] You know, when it comes to call-outs, I think call-outs are one of the greatest ways a company

[03:43] can really connect you and create a really immersive experience with Pinball and the property

[03:50] itself. You know, and we saw it with like Rick and Morty. So here's what I think. I think Scooby-Doo

[03:55] is going to be like Rick and Morty, but actually shoot better than Rick and Morty. So I think we're

[04:01] going to get like all of these great call-outs. I think we're going to get like a lot of cool

[04:05] sculpts in the game. I don't know what the mechs will be. I want to talk about that right now.

[04:10] If there's one thing that Spooky Pinball has never done in the history of Spooky Pinball,

[04:15] they've never designed a great mech or toy. And they've been at this now for almost a decade.

[04:20] And so this is the big question mark I have. Are they going to be able to actually design

[04:26] an interactive toy that is actually creative, that is interesting, and is fun? I think they're

[04:32] going to have the mystery machine van that like the doors open and maybe you lock balls inside the

[04:37] van. But I don't know, right? We haven't even seen Spooky do that. Like we haven't even seen them

[04:41] create like a toy that locks balls in an interesting way. Will they even be able to do that? Like I'll

[04:47] take the damn van with the doors opening up. Like that's progress for Spooky Pinball. I don't think

[04:51] we're going to see something like a Godzilla building. I don't think we're going to see something

[04:55] like a Batman 66 crane. I don't think we're going to see something as good as the house in Elvira,

[05:00] but I do think this game lends itself to allowing Spooky Pinball to show us

[05:05] have they matured when it comes to engineering a mech or toy in a game. Now look, I'm going to

[05:12] say it right now. Coming off of Toy Story, right? A game that had absolutely no toys in it. This is

[05:17] Spooky's moment to show us what they can do. And I know they're really passionate about this theme.

[05:23] And that's the other thing I want to say is like Spooky Pinball is a company that has a lot of

[05:28] passion. Now I've said it over the years. The only thing I think they don't have to go alongside

[05:32] their passion is tremendous amounts of talent. And I mean that. I don't think they have the talent

[05:39] to make games as good as Stern or JJP or Chicago Gaming Company. Now look, they are somewhat getting

[05:45] better with each game. I think the last two games though, Halloween and Ultraman, were terrible

[05:51] shooting games. I don't like what they did with those games. I don't like the layout of those

[05:56] games. I don't like the upper playfields. I don't like the left side of those games where the ball

[06:01] keeps going into those scoops and then it feeds into the in lanes with that like rising mechanism.

[06:06] I don't like any of that. I think those games are poorly designed. So the big question mark I have

[06:11] with Scooby Doo, are they going to go in some radical new design direction? I hope they make

[06:16] it somewhat of a fan layout. I mean it. I don't think Spooky Pinball has the talent yet to really

[06:23] take bold design decisions and execute them properly. Every time they try to do it, every

[06:30] time they add a third flipper or try to have like an orbit shot, it's always clunky. It never really

[06:35] works out. Their ramps go from being too tight to too wide in Halloween, right? That Halloween ramp

[06:40] is ridiculous. You could sit there all day long, blindfold it and hit that ramp. So I hope the

[06:45] layout and the design is somewhat more of a traditional fan layout approach. And here's why.

[06:51] Because I just want this game to be fun to shoot. I am tired of always having either a brickfest or

[06:59] shots that are just not rewarding. Like we need to find that middle ground Spooky and maybe just

[07:04] start with what works and what works is a decent fan layout. So we will see what the design is.

[07:10] We will see what the geometry is and it's going to be interesting, right? Because they haven't

[07:15] really put a brand new team on the field here. This is the same design team that worked on

[07:20] Halloween in Ultraman. But I heard from people who saw this game that this is going to be a big

[07:25] improvement over those games. Now look, you could argue the bar is really low. So a big

[07:31] improvement is necessary to just get to a good shooting game. But we don't know what it looks

[07:37] like yet. And that's the other part. Like yesterday was kind of interesting. Like they reveal that

[07:41] the title was Scooby-Doo. I think everybody and their mother was rumoring it to be Scooby-Doo.

[07:46] I've been talking about it being Scooby-Doo for over a year now. So it's not a surprise.

[07:52] The surprise is going to be this. What does the game look like? How much is the game going to cost?

[07:58] I think this game is going to cost as much, not more than Halloween in Ultraman. Spooky has read

[08:04] the room people. They know people are not happy with these high prices. They know TNAs did not sell

[08:10] out when they charged like $9,000 for it. So I don't think you're going to see a price increase

[08:15] on this game. They know they're making enough money. Spooky Pimball machines cannot really be much

[08:21] more than $9,000 or $10,000. Now how many are they going to make? Here's my prediction. I think

[08:27] they're going to announce that they are making 1,250 Scooby-Doo's. But I also think Spooky Pimball is

[08:34] not going to say this is it forever. I don't think you're really going to ever hear that from them

[08:38] again saying we're never going to make any more ever. I think they might keep the window open on

[08:43] this game and they're probably going to do the same approach. If you're a Fang Club member,

[08:49] you get early access to the game. You get to pre-order the game before everybody else. But

[08:54] here's the main thing people. If you want a Scooby-Doo Pimball machine, if you're excited

[08:59] about this theme, because I'm excited about it, I'm not getting one. I'm going to tell you right

[09:02] now, I'm not getting one. My Pimball money is already tied up in some things happening in 2023,

[09:09] more to come on that. But I'm not getting this game. I got burned by Ultraman. I'm not doing it

[09:14] again. Here's my advice for each and every one of you. If you want this game, I would not pre-order

[09:20] this game with a non-refundable deposit. Here's why. I don't think you're ever going to have a hard

[09:26] time getting one of these machines. This is not Rick and Morty contemporary popular. Yes, there are

[09:33] die-hard Scooby-Doo fans, but the majority of the Pimball buying public is between the ages of 40

[09:40] and 60. So while we all grew up with Scooby-Doo, it's still not a take my money now for most grown

[09:47] men. I sort of put Scooby-Doo in the same category as Ninja Turtles. Like most of us grew up and grew

[09:54] past this kind of stuff. It doesn't mean we don't like it, but it's definitely not a take my money

[10:00] now theme for most people. I think there might be like two or three hundred people where maybe it's

[10:06] a take my money now kind of theme. But for the most part, I don't think you're going to see this thing

[10:11] like sell out day one. And the other reason why I don't think you're going to see it sell out day one

[10:16] is because of what happened with the other two games. The thing we're going to have to see with

[10:20] this game is you're going to have to make sure you like it, that you want it, and we're going to have

[10:26] to see people play it. And we need spooky pinball to prove to us that this is not another bait and

[10:32] switch scenario like it was with Ultraman and Halloween in which they take all your money,

[10:37] they don't show you gameplay, they don't show you the code. And then by the time you realize it's not

[10:42] what you want it, you're locked in. You can't get your money back. So to what benefit is it to non

[10:49] refundable preorder this game? I would stay a country mile away from that non refundable deposit.

[10:55] And I guarantee you right now, I put my entire shows reputation and credibility on the line.

[11:02] I guarantee you it will not be hard to get one of these games. You will be able to get one when

[11:09] it's in a box and it's sitting at a distributor. I think each and every one of us should use this

[11:15] as a great moment in pinball history to stop chasing with preorder money and simply let the

[11:21] distributors buy these games. Let the distributors take the risk. Don't you take the risk. We all

[11:28] took the risk on Ultraman and Halloween and we all lost thousands of dollars. And I'm saying that

[11:34] they need to start taking more risks. The distros need to start taking the risks. They should be

[11:39] populating their warehouses with inventory and when they have a Scooby-Doo new inbox, then go buy one

[11:46] when you can have it the next week and you'll know by then if the game is any good or not.

[11:51] You'll be able to play the game by then. So I just implore each and every one of you,

[11:56] don't forget what happened with history. History has shown us there's only been one game with

[12:00] spooky pinball. If you didn't get in right away, you ended up paying more money and that was Rick

[12:06] and Morty. And I don't think this is going to be another Rick and Morty situation just because

[12:10] they're going to make much more of these. Like there's going to be a lot more of these. If they

[12:14] actually turn every single line over at spooky into Scooby-Doo, remember they made 1750 games

[12:20] over the last 18 months. They're done with TNA production by the time this thing hits the line.

[12:25] So they might make 1500 Scooby-Doo's. Now while there's demand for the Scooby-Doo,

[12:30] is there demand for 1500? And also spooky doesn't play the three tier model really properly. They'll

[12:37] make as many collector's editions as people want. So the one with all the butter and all the bells

[12:42] and whistles is not going to be hard to get. But I'm rooting for spooky on this one I am and they've

[12:48] taken a lot of arrows in the back and I think their last two games were really mediocre. But I'm

[12:53] rooting for them. And I think this is their moment. I've been saying it. They are at a crossroads.

[12:59] They lost all of the goodwill with the last two games. They need to prove themselves with this

[13:05] game. They're very passionate about Scooby-Doo. And I think this is their moment. It would be silly

[13:10] for me to tell you right now that they're not going to make a great game. That they're not going

[13:14] to make a masterpiece. I have to wait and see. I'm not going to prematurely call it a spade because

[13:20] look, anything can happen in pinball. You're only as good as your last game. Like who thought

[13:24] Pat Lawler would come out with such an empty version of Toy Story? And yet Pat Lawler, one of the

[13:29] most popular designers of all time, he whiffed. So maybe spooky's going to hit a home run with

[13:34] Scooby-Doo. We'll have to wait and see. Alright so I'm going to go this week to Jack Barr to play

[13:40] James Bond. He has it at Jack Barr. I'm going to take one of my like 18 PTO days I got to use

[13:46] between now and the end of the year. And I'm going to spend an afternoon at Jack Barr. So look out

[13:51] for that people. I'm probably going to go on Facebook Live and share my opinions about James

[13:56] Bond maybe on Facebook Live. But you know me, I like giving my Patreon subscribers a first crack at

[14:02] what's going on inside my head. Now speaking of something that I didn't give you a first crack at,

[14:07] but you might have seen it on my Facebook page today. This morning I sat down with my wife Brenda

[14:13] and we were talking about life in general. We were talking about where we're going, what we're

[14:17] excited about. And one of the things we started talking about was the award shows. And was I going

[14:22] to go to Texas Pinball Festival for the Twippies? And I want each and every one of you to know a

[14:28] few things. First and foremost, I am so thankful that each and every one of you subscribes to

[14:33] Canadian Pinball Podcasts. This is the most successful thing that has ever happened in the

[14:39] Pinball podcasting space. Nobody has ever achieved this level of success. And by that I mean over

[14:47] 500 subscribers every single month are paying a little bit of money to tune in to what I believe

[14:54] is the most entertaining Pinball podcast ever created. Nobody else would ever even attempt this.

[15:00] Nobody else would even come close to these numbers of success. So I want you to pat all of

[15:05] yourselves on the back. For the last five years I've been voted the world's favorite Pinball

[15:10] podcast. I never cheated. I never bought votes. I never did anything other than make my show

[15:16] every single week, week in and week out for over the past like six years. And so I want to thank

[15:22] each and every one of you and some of you have been tuning in since episode one. We are almost over

[15:28] 750 episodes. I've done more than 750. I've taken down some drunken rants and some of them are not

[15:35] labeled like episode numbers. They're special edition shows. So I want to thank each and every

[15:40] one of you for being on the journey. Some of you are brand new to the show. I'm happy to have you.

[15:44] And I'm going to tell you this right now. I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to stop making

[15:48] Canadian Pinball Podcasts. I know there's a lot of haters out there that want me to go away,

[15:52] that want to accuse me of being a horrible person, that want to say like I cheated in the award shows.

[15:57] No, I didn't do any of that and I'm not a bad person and you know it and they know it. So here's

[16:02] the thing though. Every year I usually get really excited for the trippy awards. I get excited for

[16:07] the chance for all of us to show who we think is our favorite in the pinball world. It is supposed

[16:12] to be a celebration of what we love about pinball. It's supposed to be a moment in which the pinball

[16:18] fans each get a vote to say this is my favorite game. This is my favorite designer. This is my

[16:23] favorite podcaster and so on and so on. And over the last couple years the award shows have sort of

[16:28] gone down in quality. They just have. There's always that undercurrent of negativity I notice by the

[16:34] other content creators and I don't want any part of it anymore. I've won Farron Square for five years.

[16:40] I'm now doing this show and I'm now focusing my efforts for each and every one of you. If you

[16:45] want to vote for me in the trippies that's great. I'm never going to tell you not to vote for me.

[16:49] We still could possibly win it but what I'm going to tell you right now is I'm no longer going to

[16:54] actively participate in the trippies. I'm no longer going to ask for votes. I am not going to Texas.

[17:00] I'm not going to TPF. This is not an indictment of that show. Kim and Ed put on a great show.

[17:07] I just don't want to go through it again for a few reasons. I don't want to support these award

[17:12] shows anymore. I think both award shows that are happening in pinball right now are just not fun.

[17:17] I think the trippies, a lot of the fun is gone from the show. I think the trippies have really

[17:21] gone downhill since Greg and Zach stopped being the hosts of the show. It just has. It hasn't been

[17:26] as much fun and it was absolutely painful sitting through that show last year. Even though I wish Todd

[17:31] and Amodo the best this next year coming up, I just don't want to be a part of it. I don't like that

[17:36] it turned into this fractured award show now where we have two award shows. The other award show to

[17:41] me is also pretty ridiculous because it's just a handful of people who think their votes matter

[17:46] more than your vote and my vote. I don't understand that either. It's also weird. You've got people

[17:51] who create an award show and they're handing themselves their own awards. It became a participation

[17:56] award. Think about it. I was best pinball podcast five years in a row when the people got the vote

[18:01] and then when that committee that's supposed to be experts voted, I only got an honorable mention

[18:05] once. Some experts they are. No. I just want to say this. I'm just walking away from this

[18:11] very satisfied. Not in a million years did I think my show would become this successful.

[18:16] Not in a million years did I think we would go behind the paywall and get this level of support.

[18:22] Not in a million years did I think for five years in a row when the pinball community was asked to

[18:27] say who's your favorite podcaster and even though there's a lot of haters saying I'm toxic and

[18:31] negative, we won it five years in a row. And I say we because it's all of us. This community and my

[18:37] fans are the greatest fan base in all of pinball. I have the greatest fans. I mean it. The amount of

[18:44] camaraderie and community and I've met some of my best friends and amazing human beings through

[18:50] pinball and it's not about a five dollar trophy anymore for me. I won't lie to you. A lot of years,

[18:56] it did mean a lot because I took a lot of arrows. Like people forgot this. People tried to dox me.

[19:01] They tried to get me fired. I even had to shut my show down for months because people tried to get

[19:07] me fired. I mean they emailed people at my company trying to get me to lose my job. Okay. So there were

[19:14] years where I took it very personal. I wanted to win to show all the haters that you can't shut up

[19:20] Canada. That we need a pinball podcaster that looks at this hobby more objectively. That you just

[19:25] can't shill everything. That there is a separation between church and state. You can't sell a product

[19:31] and then review it. I mean nobody else does that. Anywhere else in the media landscape that's 100%

[19:36] unethical yet in pinball it doesn't really matter. Like I don't care. Like I'm happy with the amount

[19:41] of content we have and I want to say this right now because I really do just have two major

[19:47] competitors. I want to say right now I think Mr. Franchi makes probably the greatest pinball

[19:53] interviews of all time. I think the production value of his show is impeccable. The amount of

[19:59] work he does to get that show off the ground. You don't even want to know the tens and tens of hours

[20:05] he has to do to make his guests sound good. And you have no idea how much work it takes. And I had a

[20:11] great conversation with Mr. Franchi yesterday and we actually bond it in a really positive way.

[20:16] And this is another reason why I want to step aside. You know he's really wanted a trippy for

[20:21] all these years so let's see if he gets it. The other person who's been a competitor of mine when

[20:25] he think about the top three pinball podcasts has always been Zach and Dennis and the pinball show.

[20:31] And I just want to say to those two I'm really happy you guys are in pinball. I am really happy

[20:36] that you make shows every single Monday or Tuesday that goes over the pinball industry and the pinball

[20:42] community. I think you're as fair as you can be knowing all things considered and I appreciate

[20:48] your take and your point of view on pinball. We might not always see eye to eye but I think

[20:53] there's always been and there will always be a mutual respect between me, Zach and Mr. Franchi.

[20:59] We might be frenemies at times but let me tell you you take those three shows off the air and

[21:05] think about how stale pinball podcasting becomes and I mean it. And to all the other shows out there

[21:10] this is not an indictment of shows like Loser Kid and Poor Man's Pinball Podcast and Backbox

[21:16] Pinball Podcast and Slam Tilt and Silverball Chronicles and the list goes on and on and on.

[21:21] I can't mention all of them. It is a very thankless endeavor and I mean this. There is so much work

[21:27] that goes into doing this triple drain pinball podcast. You guys know who you are. You basically

[21:33] sit in front of a mic and you try to talk about a hobby in which there rarely is any news and then

[21:39] you also want to be somewhat critical and objective on a hobby in which the designers are your friends

[21:45] in which you just did a tour of the Stern factory and now you want to come out and tell people that

[21:50] James Bond is overpriced. It's hard to do. It is really hard to do and I've always been a little

[21:54] bit of a black sheep. I've always been outside of the industry, outside of the circle of trust.

[22:00] I've been banned from shows, banned from forums, banned from all these things and I'll tell you

[22:05] this. I wake up every day and there's no one I'd rather be than just me and I'm really happy that

[22:11] you believe in me. I'm really happy you support me and again if you want to vote for me that's cool.

[22:16] It would be funny if we win and I'm not there and they just have to play the canada intro music and

[22:21] then there's just silence. Maybe that might be the ultimate way to say goodbye canada at the award

[22:27] shows is to win number six and not even ask for votes. Everybody have a great weekend and I mean

[22:32] this when I say it. The most important thing to me if you want to show your support is just keep

[22:37] showing up here and take care of yourselves. I mean that to your health, to your happiness, to your

[22:42] family's health and happiness that means the most to me. These are just toys. These are just boxes

[22:49] with lights that we're supposed to play and have fun. The award shows aren't fun anymore.

[22:54] All the fun is happening right here and all the fun is happening on my Facebook live and you're

[22:59] part of that army and I love the canada army. I love it when people try to say it's a toxic thing.
