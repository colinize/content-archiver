[00:00] I know your ego is hurting just no one let all your fans discover behind

[00:03] You like damn he a younger me, except he dresses better and I'm ugly always making fun of me

[00:07] Stop all the thuggery Marshall you living in luxury

[00:09] Look what you've done on me dropping off of just because of me damn you and love of me

[00:12] Oh man, machine gun Kelly dissing

[00:17] M&M so bad this week. Why is there so much hate in the world?

[00:21] I know you didn't hear the typical Canadian intro here and that is because I'm not on my normal computer this morning

[00:29] It is at work. I'm on Brenda's old work computer and I still want to get you guys a pinball podcast

[00:35] And I didn't want to waste time having to re edit my little intro music

[00:39] So we're just gonna go right into episode 261 of Canadian pinball podcast

[00:45] I'm your host canada. What are we gonna talk about on this episode? Well first and foremost

[00:50] You know we live in a world where people are critical of

[00:54] Things out in the world and I think we all know that right we live in a world where things are reviewed

[01:00] Things are criticized things are praised things are given awards, okay?

[01:05] There's winners and losers. There's great films. There's bad films. There's incredible albums in the music world

[01:11] There's terrible albums in the music world and I also think that we're living in a world now that has become so

[01:19] Overly politically correct. We are living in a world where the

[01:23] The status quo is to only be nice all the time to only be kind at every step of the journey and you know

[01:33] I don't know about you guys

[01:34] But when I watch football and pizza hut is airing a TV commercial

[01:39] That's all about the lines in life

[01:43] metaphorically speaking about the lines on the football field as they

[01:46] relate to the lines in life around social equality and all this stuff and I'm like

[01:53] What happened to the world? We used to live in a world where used to be able to sell pizza because it was delicious

[01:59] Right and used to have like entertaining things going on in the commercials to excite kids to go want to have some pizza

[02:05] And now it's like my pizza needs to sell me on the fact that the company is all about social equality and it's all bullshit

[02:14] Like I look I work in the marketing world and is overly politically correct world

[02:18] We live in has completely over corrected and the only reason pizza hut is doing commercials like that is because

[02:26] Papa John's they got slam because the founders said something racist on a marketing call with his agency and

[02:33] That's why he's out, you know, and like I don't I think he's an idiot for what he said

[02:38] But the fact is do we live in a world now where everyone has a responsibility to always be nice to always be kind to never

[02:47] speak an opinion that people might disagree with that to not have a dialogue

[02:52] Where a conversation with those who might think differently than us and I think that mentality has sort of permeated all

[03:01] Areas of culture including pinball and I think one of the only reasons why

[03:06] This show exists and I have a following is I do think that we try to speak in a way that is different

[03:12] Then the typical approach to how we look at pinball, which is that all pinball is good pinball and that we should celebrate and welcome

[03:20] All new pinball manufacturers and all new pinball machines into the world and I'm here to say on this podcast that I don't

[03:28] believe that I don't

[03:30] Have the opinion that just more is better in life that more films equals better movies equals greater chance

[03:38] The theaters will stick around no I think that when you make something and when you create something in the world you should

[03:46] really

[03:48] Only ask people to buy stuff or go into a creation if you feel like you can make something better or add

[03:55] Innovation and look no one's gonna stop you from trying to make something no one's gonna stop you from trying to innovate

[04:00] No one's gonna stop you from trying to execute your ideas

[04:03] But if the ideas are not great you can't then expect people to be nice or not give their opinions or their reviews about pinball

[04:12] Okay, and look we all know on on a very certain level

[04:18] Pinball is an art form. It is a design. It is a creative toy

[04:23] It is a subjective product and what I mean by subjective you know you guys know what that means it means everyone's gonna react to pinball machines

[04:32] differently

[04:33] There's not one machine that everyone Harold is being great. There's not one machine that

[04:39] Everyone thinks is absolutely

[04:41] Atrocious other than WWE LE you know, so there is a

[04:46] Lot of opinions and that's what makes this hobby interesting though, right if if if pinball was all about something that we all agreed upon

[04:55] And every game everyone had the same opinion about it would be absolutely boring to collect them

[05:00] It would be absolutely boring to follow the hobby. It would be absolutely boring to be on the forums so

[05:07] Why am I leading off this podcast like this because I saw something that Charlie Emory wrote in the spooky pinball thread

[05:15] You know Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle spooky pinball game number three

[05:19] I mean I could tell you that this is not really spooky pinball game number three

[05:22] They would they would like it to be but it's it's not but anyway, so Charlie wrote this and I want to I want to read it

[05:28] I don't want to give my response because this always happens in spooky game launches and if you follow the pattern of

[05:35] The launch of America's most honoured of the launch of Rob Zombie and I'll go off of Charlie's own statement that this is their third game

[05:42] Even though it's also dominoes and it's also Jetsons

[05:46] But and you know, he should also put TNA in there

[05:49] It always follows the same pattern every single spooky release. I've ever followed goes something like this

[05:55] Game is revealed people

[05:58] Get really excited because they really want a new player in the pinball hobby and they want to support you know

[06:05] The young company and the small company of spooky so everyone's like awesome great. Yes, America's most honoured and then there's always this sort of like

[06:14] This sentiment that we we should support the small guys and we should buy this game now what happened

[06:20] You know not a hundred and fifty barely sold so then he shows Rob Zombie what happened there was interesting

[06:25] We were in a time where you know people were thinking everything that was limited in numbers would sell so people ran to buy Rob zombies

[06:32] But then people realized the games weren't that great and they started dumping them and they were losing money and people realized like this

[06:39] It was actually the same design as the the zombie game Charlie showed that nobody liked

[06:44] But just because he put the Rob Zombie theme and different art package on it all the sudden it was a different game

[06:51] No, it wasn't and that's what people found out the hard way that it's still shot like that

[06:56] Same thing I think is happening without a scuba but what happens on the form is always the same is there's like this

[07:02] Meet there's like this chapter one is always enthusiasm chapter two is a little bit of like the enthusiasm

[07:08] wears off chapter three is people start to get a little critical and cranky about the game

[07:14] You know and then what happens always always is Charlie chimes in and just you know

[07:22] Says the same old like we're doing our best we're just a small company we're making games either you like it or you don't take it or leave it

[07:29] Yada yada yada and everyone always up like votes it like here and then changes their tune and I think it's kind of funny because it is hard

[07:38] It is hard if you're reviewing or you want to give your opinion about let's say a song or a movie or a

[07:46] Pinball machine if you want to give your opinion in the presence of the creator

[07:53] Would you speak so stridently would you speak so candidly and would you speak so honestly?

[08:00] So it happens often on pins eyes so when Charlie comes in

[08:03] I think everyone is just like that their knees buckle and they just like immediately like go back on their feelings and then everyone's like oh

[08:11] We're on board man like yeah totally exactly what you said and I don't here's the thing

[08:16] I don't think Charlie's wrong in what he says and when he's trying to get across a hundred percent wrong or a hundred percent right

[08:23] He's okay. I'm I'm basically I'm gonna go through what he said

[08:26] But I don't think he's wrong in his sentiment and where he's coming from but I don't think what he says

[08:31] I don't think his words

[08:33] Change my opinions about his game. Okay. I they don't change for me the opinions

[08:39] I have both positive and negative about Alice Cooper's Nightmare Catholic

[08:43] I also think I'm entitled to have my opinion about his game whether or not

[08:48] I'm gonna buy it or not and that's always been a big area of contention on

[08:51] Pinside and in pinball in general, but let me read what he wrote and let me give my

[08:57] Feelings and opinions because that's what we do on the show about his sentiment. So he says here's my opinion

[09:02] People either like the game or don't reviews are about as accurate in pinball as they are in music

[09:09] Films etc. We've seen Tina called an empty refrigerator box plays like an EM one trick pony and on and on

[09:19] 2017 pinball news game of the year multiple best and show wins all over the country

[09:25] Game sucks overrated hype. All right. I want to just stop at each picker. Okay now look Charlie

[09:32] Total nuclear annihilation all right total nuclear annihilation is a game that I think surprised a lot of people

[09:39] But here's the thing that I don't think Chuck realizes about TNA and

[09:44] It's that the game always shot really well

[09:46] I if you think about the origins of total nuclear annihilation

[09:50] It was a white wood that went around to shows that had amazing

[09:56] Music amazing light show and was very simple and easy to understand all right

[10:01] Total nuclear annihilation the people who called it whatever this or that whatever

[10:06] Game is sold 500 those haters are gonna eat crow, okay now the issue

[10:13] With TNA was never that it didn't shoot well was never that the geometry was off was never that the design was

[10:20] Bad okay because if there's one thing you can't change in a game and you can't go back and redo

[10:27] It's a bad design or a poor design on on a geometrical level

[10:32] You know and so I think like

[10:35] I don't know saying this in an Alice Cooper threat as if Alice Cooper could go the same way as

[10:43] Poet nuclear annihilation I

[10:45] Don't think so and and I think it's for the reason I said I think if you think about the things people are saying

[10:50] The issues people have it's the design okay, and then he writes

[10:55] Why question mark why bash a game you clearly don't enjoy are you trying to prove to others at the game?

[11:02] They like they are wrong for liking it seems like a complete waste of time, but what you enjoy

[11:10] Or sorry buy what you enjoy and go have fun with it all right, and that's a fair point all right

[11:17] Why do people say they don't like something that they don't like I know even when I say that out loud

[11:24] It's like well. It's just called being human and having a brain that form lights opinions that shares those opinions out in the world

[11:30] It's also we do live in a time where you know pinbill share their opinions on stuff they like and stuff they don't like

[11:36] But I also I mean look Charlie I get what you're saying

[11:40] But I kind of got a welcome you to planet earth where like if I'm a Star Wars fan and I go see

[11:46] The last Jedi which I hated and I love Star Wars and

[11:51] You're basically saying why should I

[11:54] Bash the last Jedi when I talk to people about it because I didn't enjoy it

[12:00] I should go watch the Star Wars movies I enjoyed and only talk to people about those okay

[12:06] That's kind of what you're saying here and pinball is the same way because I think the big thing and I'm gonna get to this a little bit later is that

[12:16] And I'll get this after the next paragraph the Charlie writes, but the thing is this

[12:19] People are passionate about pinball and they want to share their opinion about games and you know

[12:24] Just as much as you're asking someone to buy your product without having played it in a way put down

[12:31] $100,000 non-refundable deposits

[12:33] You know wouldn't it be convenient to live in a world where people who create things

[12:38] Wouldn't it be convenient for them if people didn't share their opinions when they didn't like them and also

[12:44] I hate to say this, but James Dyson said this to me James Dyson Charlie

[12:47] He sold a little bit more vacuums than you guys have sold of

[12:50] Pimball machines James Dyson billionaire. He said look you know the only people that changed the world are people that are

[12:57] Unhappy with the way the products are in the marketplace and unless you get mad and angry and pissed off and think you can do it better

[13:06] What are you what are you really changing? What are you making better in the world? All right?

[13:11] Then Charlie goes on to say example. This is his example. I love music

[13:15] I spend zero minutes a day online bashing country music and trying to convince country fans that heavy fucking metal is the best

[13:24] All right, so this is where like

[13:27] Charlie that's not a good example and here's why it's not a good example is music is

[13:32] extremely broad

[13:34] music is

[13:36] humongously broad and

[13:38] Genre is a music in themselves are their own like universes

[13:43] Okay, for you to say you don't go into country music forms and bash it because you don't like it

[13:48] You have to understand Charlie you make a Pimball game

[13:52] Pimball is narrow it is not as broad as the music industry if you see your analogy is more like this

[13:59] You're like saying anyone who likes toys

[14:03] All right, I like toys and I really like video games, but I don't spend my time going in

[14:10] To the Pimball forms when I'm a video game guy and try to convince them that they should be playing video games not Pimball

[14:17] See that's what your music analogy is saying but Pimball's narrow you make a product in a very narrow category

[14:25] It's not like that

[14:26] I think what you're trying to say is like if you like Pimball and you're maybe a fan of

[14:32] Stern or Jersey Jack and you only buy those games and you don't like what spooky makes

[14:37] Then why are you wasting your time coming into spooky forms and talking shit?

[14:41] But the problem is it's too narrow of a category people who love Pimball they will share their opinions

[14:48] about

[14:49] Every single Pimball game that is made they will there's nothing you can do that will make them not want to share those

[14:56] opinions of those games and look we're also in a hobby where there's only what like in a good year

[15:04] 5 to 8 machines that come out a year which is a great year in Pimball

[15:09] All right, the music industry Chuck doesn't only release 5 to 8 songs a year the video game industry doesn't only release 5 to 8 songs a year

[15:18] The movie industry doesn't only release 5 to 8 movies a year the car industry doesn't release only 5 to 8 cars a year

[15:25] So you are in a tiny little box and everything that is created in the Pimball box will be critiqued and will be

[15:34] Analyzed and opinions will be shared about it now see that's a thing is Chuck would like to live in a world where this didn't happen

[15:42] Where people didn't share their opinions about spooky where he doesn't go into his thread and read people saying

[15:48] Disparaging things about his product

[15:51] But again Chuck I think if you look at what people are saying no one is being like outright cruel or mean or or just

[15:58] Just like you know angry for angry sake. I think the the criticisms of your games have been pretty

[16:04] Consistent and I think if you look at the criticisms of the games

[16:08] I think it you know you'd be a little bit hard pressed to say that

[16:12] Huh we're making the changes that you know that are needed because we're listening to the feedback

[16:19] And I think the thing is this and this is why this show doesn't get interviews

[16:24] Doesn't get everyone shaking hands at shows is that I've said it before is I think Charlie needs to take a back seat in the design

[16:32] Category and let somebody else design these games because the problem with Alice Cooper are the designs

[16:38] It's all the bricks. It's all the posts up and that's my opinion of the game

[16:41] And it's not gonna change you know Charlie did what?

[16:45] He saw Stern do he see he got better art and he got better themes if you could art

[16:50] You know he got he realized like you put a bunch of great artwork over it and it disguises

[16:56] What I believe to be still design problems and I think that's that just chucks issue right now

[17:02] I think that's facing all the pinball

[17:03] I mean I look at Deadpool like this this game is like pretty barren

[17:07] It's like wow. It's got the busiest art ever from zombie Eddie which looks amazing

[17:12] But it's disguising the fact that the design and what's in the game is just not there, you know, and so

[17:19] I think Charlie

[17:22] gets very sensitive to people who are calling out the fact that the big weakness in his games is

[17:30] His design it's it's not the art. It's not the code. It's not everything else in these spooky games is where it needs to be

[17:38] It's his designs that are the weakest point in the game and and and and again

[17:44] It's like but it's subjective you might like Charlie's designs you might like

[17:49] Tight shots you might like a game that is not a typical fan layout and that is where Charlie is right

[17:56] So it looked on this show of I say I don't like his designs because of the following reasons that is my opinion

[18:03] It is not fact and that's the thing that I think a lot of people on

[18:07] Pinside and I hope people who listen to this show realize is that nothing we say is a fact

[18:12] I can't call a game crap and that that that means it is

[18:16] You could love it you could love Alex Cooper's nightmare castle

[18:20] And I hope you do if you buy it, you know, you should you shouldn't buy anything you don't enjoy

[18:25] All right, so he goes on to say

[18:27] he goes on to say

[18:29] Let's have more fun and dig a little deeper on the ramp thing I just mentioned

[18:36] Here's the shiny new bit. Okay, so he shares the fact

[18:39] That they have a new building across the street where they're making better ramps for the game

[18:42] And that's kind of been what the holdup on the game has been all right, so I think that look like at the end of the day

[18:50] At the end of the day Charlie needs to sell 500 of these

[18:54] Alice Cooper nightmare castles he has embarked upon a non-refundable $1,000 deposit to get the game

[19:02] You know, I want to read something else because this is the other sign of the coin for me because I you know

[19:06] And I was given this my friend shit on on text matches last night about this

[19:10] I want to read iceman's response

[19:12] To what Charlie was saying because it's just it's just it shows the

[19:17] The back and forth nature of Pinside and how people react he writes

[19:22] I don't see how anybody can really evaluate the game and say it's a piece of shit when it hasn't been out there

[19:30] And the code is nowhere near complete and much farther along than anyone else has seen

[19:38] It I like difficult games and I can remember everybody hammering the walking dead at the outset calling it the walking dud clunky too hard

[19:46] Except myself, of course loved it from day one

[19:49] All right, so look here's the deal here's the deal

[19:53] Iceman has a point, but it's also speaks to the total hypocrisy of this hobby and that is it's we're not allowed to call a game of

[20:02] Piece of shit when we first see it, but we're allowed to call a game amazing and incredible when we first see it too

[20:09] You know, that's the issue I have is remember when pirates the Caribbean was shown

[20:14] Everybody was doing backflips saying how this was like the greatest game ever and they knocked it out of the park and no one ever even flipped it

[20:21] You know so like our eyes are able to tell us whether or not a pinball machine is great when we all know a

[20:28] Pinball machine is only great if you flip it and have fun and everything comes together and everything is cohesive and then for iceman to say

[20:36] That this is going to be the next walking dead and I texted him that I'm like dude you're out of your mind

[20:40] It is not going to be the next walking dead, right?

[20:43] And what's amazing is this imagine like if walking dead had the kind of art package

[20:48] All right, the kind of art package that Stern has put into his recent games

[20:53] Imagine if walking dead with its mechs. It's interesting layout with its code from Lyman

[20:58] Imagine if zombie Yeti did the artwork on the walking dead that game would be bolted to everyone's game room floor

[21:04] It just has crappy art like it came out during that crappy drag and drop photoshop art stage and

[21:10] So look it's too of course it's too early to say that Alice Cooper Nightmare Castle is good or bad

[21:17] The only thing people can judge it on right now probably is the geometry because they've been shooting it

[21:23] But more and more more and more I'm starting to realize that

[21:27] You know the most important person and this is why we celebrate these folks

[21:32] This is why we hold them up. This is why we call them the king. This is why we

[21:38] Want their signatures on the game itself the most important person

[21:44] Involved in a pinball game, you know

[21:47] There's two but they're in very close order. They are like the axle and slash of pinball

[21:53] The most important person that ever that that that touches a pinball machine is the designer the designer

[22:00] Is the key to getting the actual physical flow and the actual like design of that game down and not just from like how the ball is gonna

[22:11] Flow, you know to eliminate clunkenness to make sure the shots are rewarding to make sure there's fun stuff to shoot the designer

[22:16] Also has the creative vision for the game. Okay, what he wants where all right?

[22:22] How he wants to code to interact with the game?

[22:24] How he wants to call out to interact with the game?

[22:27] How he wants the art to complement the design that that is why these designers are so goddamn important and that is why

[22:35] You know when you get I think the geometrical design wrong I think you like you know

[22:42] You're never gonna be able to fix that you can almost fix everything else

[22:47] I mean remember that guy who is fixing the artwork on game of thrones because he loved it so much

[22:52] He actually commissioned someone to redo all the play field artwork

[22:56] I mean almost everything is fixable. We live in an era where you can fix bad code

[23:00] You know games like cactus Canyon people have worked with p-rock to upgrade the coding game

[23:05] But if there's something you can never do it you can never fix bad geometry

[23:10] It's why I sold magic girl and when you after a while you look at it and you're like you know what?

[23:15] It's not just about

[23:17] Getting the software to talk to the hardware in this game. It's just the design is off

[23:21] There's just geometry issues here that are just never gonna be fixed and because that it's it's never gonna be good

[23:28] It's never gonna work

[23:30] And so that's where I'm at with spooky. I mean I

[23:33] I always like I'm on the fence because I think Charlie knows his perception in the hobby

[23:38] And I think he plays the good guy card all the time

[23:41] But I also think Charlie has a little bit of an ego and a little bit of like an arrogance that you do need when you're a pinball designer

[23:49] That he kind of masks a little bit from everybody, but I can see it

[23:53] I can see like how he gets defensive and and writes posts like these that are very

[23:59] strategically designed from a communication standpoint to turn the tide

[24:03] But it doesn't matter Chuck you realize it doesn't matter

[24:06] You got you have people locked in to buying your game like what is it matter now?

[24:11] And and so like that's also the hypocrisy of this hobby is when you have guys like iceman saying like well

[24:17] It's too early to call a game of pieces shit early on but ice

[24:22] Chuck but it wasn't too early to take a thousand dollar deposit from people that you won't give back to them

[24:29] Knowing that they've never played the game knowing that all they have is like a crappy cell phone video of the gameplay

[24:36] Because remember Charlie didn't even give people a lot of good assets or video or anything to see the gameplay

[24:43] He didn't he didn't give people much to go on when he started taking deposits and so why not like why didn't he show more of the gameplay

[24:51] And so then it begs the question

[24:54] Did he not want people to see too much of the gameplay?

[24:58] You know, we saw Jack Danger flip it and now you know, it wasn't like the greatest stream ever

[25:03] And people are locked in now like they can't get their money out and again

[25:06] I just don't think that's a model that's gonna work very well. All right, but ultimately

[25:11] Ultimately, I think Chuck is half right. I think I'm half right. I think we're all half right

[25:16] I think we're all half right half wrong. I think we're all just human beings who want to share our opinions about pinball

[25:21] I don't think anyone's one opinion is correct and ultimately the only thing that matters and I get and we're gonna talk about a little bit about this on my next topic

[25:28] The only thing that matters you know, it's you know when you feel you know when you realize you're right and this is this is how I live my life

[25:35] This is how you should live your life you realize you're right normally when the results are there and the results are there in pinball

[25:43] When sales are there and so Charlie did the right thing in getting total nuclear annihilation on board because look at the sales

[25:52] Stern is doing something very very right when you look at the sales of Stern pinball and so you know

[25:58] I saw a lot of people moaning and groaning a lot of people applauding October fest as a theme for American pinball

[26:04] I want to talk about something that I kept seeing in the threads that again

[26:08] I think people like just don't get it. They don't get where we're at in pinball. All right. Here's what I mean by that

[26:15] Okay, so do I think October fest is a bad theme? Yes, I do do I think October fest will not sell well for American pinball

[26:24] Yes, I do do I think that this game could have a lot of amazing stuff and it could be extremely fun as a pinball machine

[26:32] Absolutely, I think Joe Ballswick and knock it out of the park as a pinball machine

[26:36] but because of theme I think this game is gonna have a really hard time

[26:41] Breaking through and selling in the current pinball landscape

[26:45] Do I think this is an original theme that people have been clamoring for and asking for no, it's not

[26:50] October fest is not original all right what it is is an unlicensed theme which is fine with me

[26:57] I saw a lot of people debating that well, it's not original. They didn't come up with this concept

[27:00] So it's not what people really wanted like a like a xenon or this or that let me tell you something if you go completely

[27:06] Original theme right like white water like is that even original theme? No, it's like you didn't invent white water

[27:12] Hefting or fish tails

[27:14] It's hard to come up with it a completely original concept, okay?

[27:20] That would be the hardest thing to sell

[27:23] Extremely hard to sell and so I think it's okay that they went after an unlicensed theme because that what that means is

[27:29] They don't have to ask anyone permission to do what they want to do with their game

[27:33] They simply make the game they want they make it as fun as they want they make it as like

[27:38] Revern as they want they do whatever they want and there's no license or that they have to submit stuff to to get approval

[27:44] So they have complete creative freedom which is great and

[27:49] Terrifying when you're creative. I'm a creative in my career because then it's all on you if you get it right

[27:55] You got it right if you fucked it up you fucked it up, but I saw a lot of people saying like

[28:03] Awesome theme guys like this is what pinball needs you know stuff like whitewood or stuff like fish tails

[28:09] You know those games would not have been made if assholes like canada were poo pooing themes like that and you couldn't tell me

[28:16] If someone said we're gonna make a game about fishing that everyone wouldn't go crazy

[28:20] You know and be like this sucks and look the thing is this

[28:23] Fish tail whitewater those two games if released in

[28:29] 2018 would bomb so fucking bad. It's not even funny

[28:34] I think what people failed to realize is those games came out

[28:40] Doring the arcade error and they were designed

[28:43] Okay, they were designed to do one thing to basically like

[28:48] Attract your attention to get you to put your quarter in in a very crowded arcade

[28:53] You got a fucking fish on a top or flapping its tail taunting you to play you've got this like

[28:59] Amazing amazing like world in their glass in whitewater that just looks so fucking fun to flip without even flipping it

[29:05] Um, and those games were designed to do that

[29:08] Okay, they were not designed to be in people's homes and be collected and and you know go deep into the wizard mode of whitewater

[29:16] No, not the case those were those games were designed for immediate gratification that had you know

[29:22] sort of like short repetitive gameplay features that like people would ultimately

[29:27] Like not go too deep into the game you wouldn't play the whitewater for 45 minutes

[29:31] I've watched people when you know and really good play those games like it's very very repetitive

[29:34] All right, it would get very very old owning one and also to think people forget about those games those fun quirky themes

[29:41] they sold for like

[29:42] 2000 to $3,000

[29:44] That's how much they were new in box two to three thousand dollars and even on the second-hand market

[29:50] That's what those games were selling for they were cheap cheap and cheerful

[29:54] I have a client that always says I want cheap and cheerful ideas

[29:57] That's what they were cheap and cheerful would you pay eight nine thousand dollars for a whitewater?

[30:01] Would you pay eight nine thousand dollars for a fish tails and that's the thing

[30:06] You have to look at these themes in the context of what they're charging if American Pimball wants you to pay seven eight thousand dollars for a

[30:13] Pimball machine you want that theme to be something that you fucking love that you never want to let go of that's a dream theme for you

[30:21] And nobody's dream theme was October fest. So they're making a theme that nobody want it

[30:28] But but they're doing it and they feel like they can make it into a fun Pimball machine and look this topic is dead until we see it

[30:36] I

[30:37] All I can do is say I don't think the theme is what I would have done

[30:41] It's what they've decided to do I look forward to seeing what Joe and and and Josh create

[30:47] um

[30:47] It wasn't it wouldn't have been my decision, but now we just have to wait okay and waiting is something we do very good in Pimball because

[30:55] How long do people have to wait for these pirates of the caribbean's that have been on the line since august like third to get the people like

[31:04] Is Jack actually putting these ships on pirate ships leaving from the caribbean and sending them to distributors via the caribbean

[31:12] I mean that's how fucking long it's taking I have no clue. Why does it always take Jersey Jack Pimball?

[31:17] So long to get production going you I think for a lot of us now we just have to admit this is just Jersey Jack Pimball

[31:25] It's not gonna get better. It's not gonna improve. It's not gonna get smoother

[31:31] You know, they're never gonna ever get to where stern is they're never gonna figure out production the way stern does

[31:37] They're never gonna get games as out as fast as stern does

[31:40] They're never gonna like

[31:41] Understand the right way to like release a game when it comes to reveal

[31:46] You know then production starting quickly. They're they're just this is just Jersey Jack Pimball

[31:52] It's the same story all the time. It's like these things just trickle out at a snail's pace and the problem is

[32:01] Again, I feel so bad for jack because the window of hype the window by which people want these things

[32:07] It's not as it's not that big. It's not eight months. It's not a year

[32:11] You know and it's just I think the reality is that they can only make when they're at

[32:17] full efficiency

[32:19] This company can only make maybe five games a day and stern makes 50 and I don't even think Jack is making five games a day

[32:29] I mean, I think it's more like you know, maybe

[32:34] um

[32:36] 20 a week. I mean, I you know, I don't know. Maybe it's a little bit more. I

[32:41] I just I don't see stuff going out, you know, I saw him do his cartwheel and I don't see many unboxings a few of them

[32:49] I think it's gonna start to happen, you know, it's it's a little bit of a damn breaking with these guys

[32:53] I think they start to make a bunch and then they start to ship them out

[32:58] But it's it's September 12th and we really still only have

[33:03] Maybe 10 pirates of the Caribbean's out in the world if last October when they revealed the game

[33:09] If Jack had said hey, we're not going to be shipping these games to September of 2018

[33:15] I mean people would have just been like what are you doing? Why are you showing it like what was the point of this?

[33:21] We've beat this into the ground a million times

[33:24] The other thing that again nobody learns from like this whole thing jacks never gonna change the model

[33:31] And then you got idiots on pinside thinking like well they have to get wonk out then maybe we'll see it at expo with production starting

[33:38] At tpf. Let me tell you something if you think willie wonka is gonna be shown at expo

[33:45] Please sit down

[33:47] Look in the mirror and say you sir are a fucking idiot. I'm serious. I don't I don't mean to curse because I know some kids listen to the show

[33:55] But you are fucking idiot if you think Jersey Jack is gonna show in like a month and a half

[34:02] His next title when this title is barely even beginning to ship when he needs orders to come in

[34:10] I mean are you fucking stupid? I can't even imagine

[34:14] Willie wonka being shown at tpf because of how delayed

[34:19] Pirates the Caribbean was remember pirate the Caribbean was supposed to be a q

[34:24] One title for Jack. It's basically a q4 title for Jack now

[34:30] So peace so peace six eight months delayed then everything else would be six to eight months delayed

[34:35] No, won't it because but the only way that won't happen

[34:40] Is if the following happens which shouldn't happen and Jack don't be fucking stupid again

[34:45] Don't show the game early if you show willie wonka if you show it really early

[34:51] And then it's eight months until it's made or whatever

[34:55] What you've you've done exactly what you did with pirates is which is you just fucked you fucked over dialed in sales

[35:03] Which like for no reason how many more dialed in's would they have sold if people didn't see pirates get excited and said I'm gonna wait for that

[35:13] Probably a lot

[35:14] Probably a lot because remember back then a year ago pirates hype was at an all-time high

[35:20] I think the game hype now is at an all-time low I I and and

[35:24] Every game is like that like how how excited are people to like start talking about iron made in or star wars or ghost buses now

[35:31] It's that it's not to say that the games got worse

[35:34] It's just to say the hype and enthusiasm by which you want to talk about them continues to diminish right how often you

[35:41] Talk to people about a song you heard three years ago or a movie you saw three years ago. No you it's like the the the the talk of the day

[35:51] Is around the stuff that's more present in the world all right, so I just think

[35:56] You know people have been patient and we'll see when it happens

[35:59] But I just think I hope they don't fumble the next launch

[36:02] But if I was a betting man, I think Jersey jack's gonna do the same shit again and fumble it all over again

[36:07] I think they're gonna show something early and it's gonna be another arduous weight

[36:12] And it's gonna be pointless and it makes no sense and I think jack is still like

[36:17] Wedded to the the importance of these shows when they really don't matter what it be so much more impactful

[36:23] If he could show up to a show and take orders and ship games in a couple weeks from then, you know

[36:28] That's that's how you do what Stern does right you don't you don't make people wait a year absolutely stupid all right

[36:34] Speaking of shows there's all this drama around pinball expo, which I don't care or like I don't understand it

[36:40] It's the same moaning and groaning every year about like people who bring games to shows should have incentives and be rewarded

[36:47] And I think that's true. It is true

[36:49] um

[36:50] I think pinball expo as a show sucks. I just do I've been doing it a couple times and compared to other shows

[36:55] It's total garbage

[36:57] I think launching a game there is idiotic. I think it makes no sense

[37:02] You can as I said like a good video on the internet

[37:05] Will attract more people than anything out of show like that

[37:10] So I don't think I'm gonna go this year. I say that every year. I always want to go to Chicago because it's close

[37:16] I just have more fun at tpf

[37:19] Way more fun

[37:20] So I'm think I'm gonna skip it this year. I think I'm gonna save the money and go buy another Gucci shoot

[37:25] Um, what else is going on the pinball world anything going on at let's see Chicago gaming company

[37:32] I don't know is the 15th of September when we're gonna see monster bash something's really weird with this delay

[37:37] I don't really get it. Um, I don't really care. They haven't really taken anyone's money

[37:42] It was strange the way they just kind of confirmed the title

[37:45] But and then they had the people coming in play it

[37:48] But something's holding it up and it's not I don't think it's the waiting for approval

[37:54] My guess would be

[37:56] They want to show it when they can ship it and I think they just need to wait probably for some vendors or some parts to be where they're at

[38:04] So I think that's my guess, but I think it's gonna be fun man. It's gonna be fun watching Alice Cooper

[38:11] The monsters and monster bash remake like battle it out

[38:15] Like that fucking battery out in the monster category this this fall winter is gonna be awesome to see

[38:21] There's gonna be winners and there's gonna be losers

[38:23] Um, if I had a bet in which order those will go I definitely think that um

[38:30] I mean, I'm gonna like like by volume. I think Stern's gonna sell a ton of the monsters. I do

[38:35] I think it's gonna be obviously gonna be between monster bash remake and the monsters

[38:40] I think that the monsters coming out now is great and here's why I think the monsters

[38:45] Sorry, well, yeah, I think the monsters coming out now is great

[38:48] But I think what's great about monster bash coming out next to it is I really am gonna love the fact that we're gonna be able to compare two games

[38:56] At a basically like an eight nine thousand dollar price point

[39:00] That are both monster themed

[39:02] Um, one is designed by George Gomez ironically who now is at the helm of Stern

[39:08] It's gonna be interesting to see what you get for your money because monster bash unlike attack from Mars remake is jam pack with stuff

[39:14] It's jam pack with toys. It's jam pack with mechanisms. It's one of the

[39:18] Fucking best games of all time right?

[39:21] So I think the pressure is on Stern

[39:25] To put stuff and enough into the monsters where it doesn't look

[39:29] embarrassingly empty next to monster bash remake. We all know the arts gonna be better on

[39:36] The monsters we all know that Borg is capable of greatness

[39:40] Dwight on code always has me a little nervous because he thinks Star Wars was great

[39:45] But that's gonna be a fun battle to watch and what's great about it? We're gonna be able to see that battle unfold

[39:50] over the next two months

[39:52] It's gonna happen. It's awesome. I'm that's what I'm most excited about

[39:55] I'm kind of over the rest of all the drama and all the waiting for stuff to come out stuff

[40:00] Um anything else than I'm missing

[40:03] Uh, I think those are the main things you know in the Stern world. We got a stern of the union address

[40:07] I think we guys we talked about that

[40:09] There's Ghostbusters code. There's new Batman code or Ghostbusters code is coming

[40:15] Star Wars topper, you know, Stern's in this interesting place right now. We're I think Deadpool is out. It's in the world

[40:21] You know, they're probably selling a lot of them. It's probably not selling a ton. I don't think Deadpool you know

[40:26] Deadpool L. Lee's have not sold out

[40:29] uh, uh, you know, I think the

[40:32] The feedback I've been getting from people on Deadpool has been mixed. I think the game looks great

[40:37] I would go with the Deadpool pro if I want it one

[40:40] I don't see enough in the L. Lee's to justify it

[40:43] I think if you wanted a Deadpool L. Lee

[40:46] Let's be honest. You could wait

[40:48] Just wait any year from now Deadpool L. Lee's will be selling for

[40:53] In the you know, 7,000 7500 dollar range. They just will this is this is not a sold out game

[40:58] This is one that's gonna be pretty easy to get and prices will decrease on it pretty quickly

[41:03] Uh, and then I know it's interesting too because I'm still noticing a lot

[41:06] of people are reluctant to realize

[41:09] That their DMD Error Stern games are just not worth that much anymore. I mean I saw a

[41:14] a tron pro with like

[41:17] fiber optic ramps for like 7500 dollars like what are people thinking?

[41:22] If you have a DMD Error Stern game, I'm sorry, but demand is probably the lowest it's ever been

[41:27] And everyone's games are gonna lose in additional one to two thousand dollars over the next couple years

[41:33] They just are there's no way around it and

[41:36] God forbid the economy dips for you can add another one to two thousand dollars on top of that because

[41:42] When when the economy crashes down and it's it the bubble's gonna burst

[41:47] And and people are like well, you know, I do have eighty five thousand dollars tied up in pinball machine

[41:53] You know stuff's gonna happen. We're we've been riding a gravy train for a decade

[41:57] You know people are getting like

[41:59] 10% or more back on their with their financial and you know advisors and

[42:04] That doesn't always happen and we're not seeing people lose money the only way you lose money

[42:09] And in the modern world is if you buy the big Lebowski from Dutch pinball and then man then you're eight grand

[42:15] That's gone you ain't never seeing that game know your money ever again. All right everyone. I gotta get to work

[42:21] I hope you enjoyed episode 261 of Canadian pinball podcast. We'll be back real soon

[42:29] You're being rich and you still mad let's talk about it

[42:32] But we're singing dance remember where we can talk about it or we can get go to your size up your body and put some white chalk around it
