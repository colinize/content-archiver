[00:00] I guess one of those decisions is they can order directly through your website or they

[00:14] can go through their distributor.

[00:16] And I say their distributor speaking from my perspective in the US, I can speak to Zach

[00:20] and flip it out pinball.

[00:22] And he's taken the deposits, but I'm also hearing murmurs that they're not non-refundable.

[00:28] I'm guessing he's taken some of the risks there because normally the deposits would

[00:31] go directly to you guys, correct?

[00:34] Correct me where I'm wrong here.

[00:35] Educate me.

[00:36] Well, the default is, yeah, correct.

[00:38] The default is that refunds are non-deposital.

[00:42] Deposits are non-refundable.

[00:43] Get that down.

[00:44] Which again, as we know, we're not setting a precedent on that.

[00:49] We're not the only company to do that.

[00:51] So the deposits, that's basically to hold your position, your spot, and the rest isn't

[00:56] due until the game is in a box.

[00:58] Yeah, again, so look, the intent always is when the game is sort of scheduled, basically

[01:04] when it's three weeks, two to three weeks out from being boxed, it's the same sort of

[01:08] scenario.

[01:09] You know, we get the final balance payment, we do the final part of the assembly and final

[01:13] testing, put it in a box and ship it.

[01:15] So that's the intent.

[01:17] Again, that was always the intent with Fathom.

[01:19] It's just things happen, I guess, and manufacturing is tough.

[01:23] And there's all these things that sort of impact our ability to do what we've needed

[01:26] to done.

[01:27] And so those timelines started to shift.

[01:29] It was never the plan, and it was just the way it went.

[01:33] And again, as I said, I feel very confident about where we are now, and I'm hopeful that

[01:37] that's going to be the case.

[01:40] My opinion on the whole thing is that, like you said, you're in a better position now,

[01:44] because we're getting out of the whole COVID-19 thing.

[01:46] So now you're able to start getting those parts, and now you're able to start pumping

[01:50] machines out.

[01:51] And I think over time, as you prove, especially if you can prove to your word that you're

[01:57] getting all your fathoms out by the end of this year, I think especially if you get that

[02:00] done, then there's going to be a lot more faith in your pocket right there from the

[02:04] public right there.

[02:05] Oh, official.

[02:06] Welcome, everybody.

[02:12] Happy Monday after the Super Bowl.

[02:14] I always feel like today should be a national holiday.

[02:17] Raise of hands.

[02:18] Who's exhausted?

[02:19] I felt like I was watching that game for an entire month.

[02:22] I think the better team won, you know, but I'm just exhausted by the whole thing.

[02:27] All the food, all the waiting, waiting for a halftime.

[02:30] You know what I'm also exhausted about?

[02:32] Haggis Pinball.

[02:33] We're going to talk about it right now on this episode.

[02:36] We're going to talk about what's going on with the company, with the people who have

[02:40] put the posits down on Centaur games.

[02:43] You know why I need to talk about this stuff?

[02:45] Because nobody else will.

[02:47] Just like seven months ago in July, every single media outlet gave Damien and gave Haggis

[02:54] Pinball the stage to talk about Centaur Revisited, a game that is $10,000 and $17,000 for the

[03:03] Orblivian Edition.

[03:05] Everybody gave him a platform.

[03:07] Everybody was waving some nervousness around, right?

[03:09] Why are you taking deposits on your next game when you haven't finished the Fathom games?

[03:16] And he said to every single media outlet that we are on track to finish all of the Fathom

[03:22] games by the end of the year.

[03:25] That is why I played that extended sound clip at the beginning of the show.

[03:29] Okay, so seven months ago, all these people interview you.

[03:33] You say all this stuff about things are going better.

[03:36] We're not going to run into the same delays we had with Fathom.

[03:40] And even Kaneda said, I'm going to fall on my sword if this company finishes the Fathom

[03:45] builds by the end of the year.

[03:47] It is now mid-February.

[03:49] Are they done with the Fathom builds?

[03:51] No, they are not.

[03:53] Did they say they were done with the Fathom builds?

[03:56] No, they have not.

[03:57] Are there still people who are waiting for their Fathom games?

[04:01] Yes, there are.

[04:02] Have any of the people that covered this company seven months ago, have they followed up?

[04:08] Let's use their own terminology.

[04:10] Have they revisited this story?

[04:12] Where is it?

[04:13] Everybody following up with all the promises that Damien's been making over the years.

[04:19] When you go back and you listen to him, right?

[04:21] How transparent he was when he was taking your money all over again.

[04:25] And so the reason why this is a show topic this week is simply this.

[04:30] There are people on Pinside who put deposits down with distributors.

[04:35] When they put those deposits down with the distributors, they were told that none of

[04:40] their money was going to haggis.

[04:43] That that deposit money was going to be held in escrow.

[04:46] I believe that is what they were told.

[04:49] Now look, I'm not absolutely sure because they also went in on these deposits knowing

[04:54] all too well that these were non-refundable deposits.

[04:58] I'm going to do a little bit of victim blaming right now.

[05:02] If you went in on a Centaur deposit seven months ago, you need to have your head examined.

[05:09] Even if you were a newbie in the pinball world, all you had to do was ask somebody, just ask

[05:14] somebody who's in the community, hey, I'm thinking about ordering this game in July of

[05:18] 2023 from a company in Australia called Haggis Pinball.

[05:23] What should I be aware of?

[05:25] And immediately anybody would have helped you out.

[05:28] And even if you just went on Pinside and read the threads, it is not been smooth sailing

[05:33] for this company.

[05:34] You better be prepared to wait a significantly long time, much longer than Damien keeps saying

[05:40] even in that interview with Kerry Hardy.

[05:43] For some reason, this guy just can't get over the fact that when he's saying things

[05:48] are going to take weeks, what he really means is months.

[05:51] You know, even in that clip he says, we're not going to ask for payment in fall until

[05:56] your game is ready to ship in the next few weeks, weeks people.

[06:00] And when he's asking people for FAB the money, he tells them you're going to have your game

[06:04] in eight weeks and people have waited longer than eight months.

[06:09] And so I keep wondering what's changed.

[06:12] Did he bring on more people?

[06:13] How did he create more efficiencies?

[06:16] Has he opened up the door to the company?

[06:18] Has he done a walkthrough like Dutch did, like Spooky's done, like heck, even Pimball Adventures

[06:23] did a walkthrough of their company.

[06:26] And still January came and went.

[06:28] They didn't open up the door.

[06:30] They didn't show you that Centaur production is happening.

[06:32] You have no clue if games are going out in Q1 of 2024.

[06:36] They might trickle out.

[06:37] I don't know.

[06:38] It shouldn't even be a question.

[06:40] If he finished production of Fathom at the end of the year, he should have made a statement.

[06:45] He should have said, we're all done and we're moving on to the next game.

[06:48] And here is the production line of Centaur.

[06:51] We didn't see that.

[06:52] Okay.

[06:53] So the reason why this threat is blowing up is there are people on pin side now who are

[06:56] tired of the wait.

[06:58] They went in on a deposit.

[07:00] And again, I'm going to victim blame.

[07:01] They never should have done it.

[07:03] They should have just waited, but they did it.

[07:05] Okay.

[07:05] So let's just go down the journey.

[07:07] These people have to go through now.

[07:09] So imagine if you're them, you gave a thousand dollar deposit on a Centaur like seven months

[07:14] ago, seven months have come and went.

[07:17] Now part of the reason why you gave that deposit is because you heard Damien being interviewed.

[07:22] You heard from your distributor friends.

[07:25] You heard stuff that felt promising that they were making a game a day.

[07:29] We're going to finish the fathoms by the end of the year.

[07:31] Okay.

[07:32] So I'm willing to give you a deposit.

[07:34] So you go in on the order and you also were hearing that your money is not going to go

[07:38] to Haggis and that's a really important part because the reason why people were giving

[07:43] deposits, feeling like it wasn't going to go to Haggis.

[07:46] They did not want to enter into a scenario where we're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

[07:51] There was a lot of concern and I still feel like, you know, we're never going to get the

[07:55] full truth here that they needed to get Centaur deposit money to get enough capital to finish

[08:01] the fathom builds.

[08:02] Why else would they ask for money so far in advance?

[08:06] Nobody else does this.

[08:07] Nobody else is asking for money on a game seven or eight months before it's on the line.

[08:13] Nobody is Dutch pinball asking for deposits right now on Alice in Wonderland.

[08:18] Are they the spooky pinball asked for money eight months in advance?

[08:22] No.

[08:23] The longest timeline we see is maybe some companies have a couple of months between

[08:27] reveal, you got to put your money in and then the game is going to go on the line.

[08:32] But the only companies that are doing that are companies that are reputable.

[08:35] And I know everyone's always saying, well, what about Chicago gaming company?

[08:38] Right.

[08:39] They asked for deposits on Pulp Fiction and they did.

[08:41] But here's the big difference people between giving Chicago gaming company your deposit

[08:46] and Haggis pinball.

[08:47] Well, the first difference is this company has shipped thousands of games.

[08:52] Thousands.

[08:53] Haggis pinball hasn't shipped thousands of games.

[08:55] And also you're not going to be asked to pay in fall for your Pulp Fiction until your

[09:01] game is ready to ship to the distributor.

[09:04] You are not going to have to pay in fall for your Pulp Fiction and wait eight months.

[09:08] I have a deposit in on a Pulp Fiction.

[09:10] I've had it for almost a year now.

[09:11] I'm not worried about it because I know they're not going to ask for any more money until

[09:16] my game is going to be mine.

[09:18] And when I pay the remaining balance, I'm not going to then go on an entire another

[09:23] eight month wait for the game.

[09:25] Do I like the fact that Chicago gaming company reveals a game a year in advance and takes

[09:30] money?

[09:31] No.

[09:32] Why do they need the deposit money a year in advance?

[09:34] I don't know.

[09:35] I can understand how small beauty companies might need to get a sense of how many orders

[09:40] they have so they can order parts because they're not ordering in bulk.

[09:44] I understand all of that.

[09:46] But through this entire process, people, the part I will never understand is why can't

[09:52] Damian just be honest?

[09:54] Why does he always have to spin these timelines?

[09:57] Like just tell people, I'm going to need your money in fall and the wait is going to be

[10:02] six to eight months.

[10:04] And this is just where we are at.

[10:06] He knows this.

[10:08] There's no reason why there's no reason why anybody should be making excuses that he is

[10:13] emailing people or he's looking them in the eye and saying, if you pay in full, you're

[10:19] going to have your game in eight weeks.

[10:21] Why would he say that?

[10:23] And at what point does that become completely misleading?

[10:27] And I don't know.

[10:28] Is that not a lie?

[10:29] So now you've got people who put the thousand dollars down.

[10:32] All right.

[10:33] Imagine you're these people seven months have gone by.

[10:36] You don't hear any statement about fathoms being done.

[10:39] In fact, you're hearing the opposite.

[10:41] You go on pin side and you're hearing from all these people that are still waiting for

[10:45] their game and it's mid February.

[10:48] And all of a sudden you're like, wait a minute, I gave money because this company said they

[10:53] were going to be done with fathom by the end of the year.

[10:56] They also said that Centars would be in production in January.

[11:00] Now all of a sudden I don't feel so good and I don't feel like waiting another eight months

[11:05] for my game because if they haven't even asked me for payment in fall and history has shown

[11:11] us that once you pay in fall, that just is the beginning of your eight month wait for

[11:15] your game.

[11:17] I don't want to be in on this anymore.

[11:19] Okay.

[11:20] So that's where these people are at.

[11:21] Now all of these people who want to refund, they also did sign an agreement that it was

[11:27] non refundable.

[11:28] So look, I'm somewhat torn on which side to be on here because on one level you had distros

[11:34] saying we're not going to send your money into haggis.

[11:37] All right.

[11:38] So you have a friend, you signed an agreement buyer, you were given this money over in a

[11:42] non refundable fashion and then you've got the manufacturer saying they're going to have

[11:47] all the old games done by the end of the year and then the new games are going to be on

[11:50] the line in January.

[11:52] So it's like all three of those things are colliding at once and then if you look at

[11:56] it from a distance, you're like, okay, well wait a minute here.

[11:59] Let's just apply some common sense.

[12:00] I get it.

[12:01] I get that these people signed a contract.

[12:04] I get that a lot of that contract and goodwill was based on what Damien was saying.

[12:09] I get that distributors were also trying to instill confidence in people to secure all

[12:14] that deposit money because you got to think what everyone's in this for.

[12:17] The distributors in this to make money.

[12:19] Like they want to make money.

[12:20] They want to secure as many deposits as possible.

[12:23] The manufacturer is in the same boat too.

[12:25] They need to sell as many deposit spots as they can because they need that capital to

[12:29] order parts, to pay vendors and yes, probably to finish some of those fathom builds.

[12:34] So they want your money too.

[12:36] If you're the buyer, if you're the consumer, I don't even understand why you put any money

[12:41] down.

[12:42] You know you don't need to rush and get the game.

[12:44] All you had to do is look at what's happening with fathom.

[12:47] You can go get them today, new in box for less money than they were new.

[12:51] Why would you lock in your money with a company that has a history of doing nothing but blowing

[12:56] by their estimated dates?

[12:58] So when I look at it like that, I'm kind of like shame on you.

[13:01] It's a little bit of victim blaming but you should have known better.

[13:04] Okay.

[13:05] But now we get to the current day.

[13:07] So someone's got a thousand dollars with a distro.

[13:10] The distro has said they're not sending any of the deposit money to Haggis.

[13:14] So then that begs the question, who's got the money?

[13:18] Who's got the Haggis deposit money right now?

[13:21] Did that money go from distro to Haggis or does the distributor still have it?

[13:27] And if the distributor still has someone's money, why won't they just refund them?

[13:32] Right?

[13:33] Damien has not held up his end of the bargain.

[13:35] Why then does the customer now have to be punished again?

[13:39] They believed what you said when you gave the timeline and you blew by it again.

[13:44] I've been saying this since July.

[13:45] I think this whole thing just reeks once again.

[13:49] We've seen this before.

[13:51] It's another robbing Peter to pay Paul financial business model for the company.

[13:56] I don't think it was a good move for any distributors to get in bed with this kind

[14:00] of company because all you're going to do is have upset customers.

[14:05] Everyone else who's selling new inbox games right now has figured out a way to get games

[14:09] made and get them to customers with much more transparency, much more efficiency and much

[14:16] less headaches.

[14:17] Because here we are.

[14:18] How soon until Damien starts asking for people to pay in fall when he hasn't shown us anything?

[14:24] He hasn't shown us how many games they're up to a week?

[14:26] He hasn't shown us or proven to us that fathoms are done?

[14:30] If I were any of these distros, right, you've got flippin' out, you've got Nitro and RS

[14:34] Pimbal, those are the three distributors for Damien's games.

[14:38] If I'm these gentlemen and I took someone's money and I still have the money, I would

[14:43] cancel the orders with Haggis and give the person his money back because at the end of

[14:48] the day, what's the point of holding on to it?

[14:51] It's almost like at the point now where it feels like everybody's in breach of contract

[14:54] with this company, everybody, nobody's staying true to their word, right?

[14:58] Even the customer asking for a refund is them not staying true to their word because when

[15:03] they signed the deal, they said, I'm not going to ask for a refund because I'm giving you

[15:08] money in a nonrefundable fashion.

[15:10] The distributor, if they sent the money to Haggis and I don't know if they have, but

[15:14] if they did, then they did not stay true to their word because that's the reason probably

[15:19] why they don't want to give you a refund.

[15:21] And Haggis, pinball just hasn't stayed true to their word ever in this entire process.

[15:25] And Canadian Spinball podcast has to be the only one talking about this stuff.

[15:29] And I get it.

[15:30] Most of you don't care.

[15:31] Most of you sometimes hate the fact that I go on these watchdog shows and I keep these

[15:35] companies accountable, but who else is going to do this?

[15:38] Who else is going to do this?

[15:40] There's just too many companies executing so much better than this.

[15:44] And look, I said it seven months ago.

[15:47] If Damien could stay true to his word, then we would have a new chapter in Haggis pinball

[15:53] and he would finally accomplish something he said he was going to accomplish.

[15:58] And that was finishing the fathoms by the end of the year.

[16:01] At what point, ladies and gentlemen, are we not allowed to say, okay, once again, you've

[16:07] failed.

[16:08] Once again, what you said didn't come true.

[16:11] And not only that, there's no more correspondence.

[16:14] He's not corresponding with people.

[16:16] There's no transparency whatsoever.

[16:19] He still refuses to open up the company door, walk around on Facebook live and just show

[16:24] us Damien.

[16:25] How many people are working there?

[16:27] How many people are your employees?

[16:29] What is the manufacturing capabilities look like?

[16:31] Everybody else who's asking for money and deposits and being paid in full can have the

[16:35] common courtesy to do that for their customers, but you can't do it.

[16:39] And Damien and all the distributors and all of you guys who are buying these products,

[16:43] shame on all of you.

[16:45] All of you deserve each other.

[16:47] And this is probably the last time I'm ever going to talk about Hag is pinball because

[16:50] you know how I feel.

[16:51] I think if they continue to do it like this, there is no way they're going to keep the

[16:55] lights on for much longer and they can't hide anymore.

[16:58] There's nowhere to hide anymore because that's why the threads are blowing up is because

[17:03] people are just fed up and more people are going to talk and share their stories and

[17:07] share their disappointment and how this whole thing is operating.

[17:11] And you best believe they did not sell a lot of centaurs.

[17:14] How are you going to sell centaurs at $10,000 to $17,000 with all the other stuff happening

[17:21] in the pinball world?

[17:22] There's just not enough demand.

[17:23] I don't see how they get this done.

[17:26] And look, if a few days from now we see some centaurs going out the door, I'll retract

[17:30] everything I just said.

[17:32] But until that day, I want to light this flame and not let this be buried under the rug.

[17:37] And that's it.

[17:38] I mean, look, I know 98% of you are like, canade and nobody cares about Hag is move on.

[17:43] The big news of the week, Spike 3 with Metallica, a brand new designed game.

[17:50] A lot of conversation around that.

[17:52] I think that's going to be an exciting moment for Sturm Pinball.

[17:55] Let's see what changes come in the Spike 3 format.

[17:58] A lot of debate on whether or not we need a new Metallica game.

[18:02] And it's a split camp people.

[18:04] Some people just want the old game made again with newer stuff and newer technology because

[18:08] it's such a good game.

[18:10] Some people are really excited for a brand new Metallica who don't own the old Metallica

[18:15] machine.

[18:16] So we'll see if this game is the next game or the game after next.

[18:19] We'll see if canade is even right.

[18:21] I mean, look, everything's a rumor until I see it before my own eyes.

[18:25] We're going to get Looney Tunes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre shipping to customers this

[18:29] week.

[18:30] Look at that Damien.

[18:31] People actually shipping games to their customers.

[18:34] People paying in fall and getting their product within a month.

[18:37] What a novel idea that is.

[18:39] We're going to get more people unboxing labyrinth machines.

[18:42] It was super awesome.

[18:43] Got to give him a shout out.

[18:44] David Van S joined our Saturday morning spectacular.

[18:48] That was a lot of fun.

[18:49] It was a lot of fun having everybody congratulate him and the company on how to launch properly

[18:55] and all the successes they've had so far this year.

[18:58] You know, we got all these pulp fictions being boxed up and making their way out the door.

[19:03] This is what we want to see.

[19:04] You know, these things are really expensive.

[19:07] Who wants to go on a nightmare ownership experience?

[19:10] The next few months are going to be like, whoever executing properly is going to get

[19:15] your money.

[19:17] Everyone else, it's not going to work.

[19:18] And there's just so many games, right?

[19:20] Elton John, Jaws, Pulp Fiction.

[19:24] Stern still got hundreds.

[19:26] Trust me, people.

[19:27] There are hundreds of Venoms sitting in boxes that need to find homes.

[19:32] There are a lot of Stern premiums sitting at distros without homes, people.

[19:37] Don't think everything is Jaws now.

[19:39] I mean, every day there are pinball boxes piling up.

[19:43] Every day more people are making pinball and all those games need to find a home.

[19:48] And at these prices, people, I'm telling you, the coolest seat in the house.
