[00:00] Big Bang Bar.

[00:30] 590 Club members, thank you for the support.

[00:33] We're gonna get back up over 600, I'm not worried about that.

[00:35] Happy 4th of July, everybody.

[00:37] You might hear Killian playing in the background,

[00:40] but I had to do a show this morning.

[00:41] We're gonna talk about He-Man Pinball.

[00:44] We've been hearing about He-Man now for a few years,

[00:47] so there's a really good chance this game is happening,

[00:49] but now what gets people really excited

[00:53] is that the game is not gonna be made

[00:55] by some boutique company that's gonna struggle

[00:57] to get He-Man out into the world.

[01:00] It's gonna be made by Stern Pinball.

[01:02] Now look, Stern Pinball getting a license like this

[01:06] is good news from a manufacturing standpoint.

[01:10] It's good news that they have great designers

[01:12] that grew up loving He-Man.

[01:15] We're gonna talk about the power of nostalgia,

[01:18] and we're gonna talk about,

[01:19] even though most of us have outgrown what we were into

[01:22] when we were kids, there's no denying the sheer power

[01:27] of nostalgia, and if you get it right

[01:30] and you hit nostalgia in the bullseye,

[01:32] this could be a very, very well-received pinball machine

[01:37] by the community, but you gotta do it right.

[01:39] I don't think they did it right

[01:40] with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

[01:42] We're gonna talk about how turtles got it wrong,

[01:45] but He-Man has an opportunity to get it right,

[01:48] and before I go on to He-Man

[01:50] and why I think it's a great theme for pinball,

[01:52] I got a little anonymous email that came into my inbox

[01:56] about Haggis Pinball.

[01:57] See, this is what happens.

[01:58] When you start to sort of kick the tires a little bit,

[02:01] when you start to poke the bear,

[02:03] when you start to ask some questions about what's going on

[02:06] in pinball and what's going on with these companies,

[02:09] and then you get a company like Haggis

[02:11] who struggle to make game number two,

[02:14] and they're now gonna want people

[02:15] to give money towards game number three.

[02:18] Once you start to kick that can down the road,

[02:21] people start to share some stuff,

[02:23] but again, all of this stuff comes to me anonymously,

[02:26] so you have to take it with a grain of salt,

[02:29] but there are documents attached to this email

[02:33] that explain what this email is all about,

[02:36] and it's two things that I got.

[02:37] I got the company structure,

[02:39] and then some known debts that are associated

[02:42] with Haggis Pinball.

[02:43] So let me just summarize it for you right now,

[02:46] and I'm more than happy to share these documents

[02:49] with anybody who's interested,

[02:51] but I can tell you right now,

[02:52] after we confirmed that Centaur

[02:54] is gonna be the next title from Haggis Pinball,

[02:56] nobody really cares.

[02:58] Nobody really cares.

[02:59] Nobody is clamoring for a $10,000 Centaur,

[03:03] and if I were Damien and I were Marty,

[03:06] I would read the room a little bit.

[03:07] I think they need to show something original,

[03:10] they need to show something new.

[03:11] They're not gonna get 250 orders for a game

[03:15] that you can go buy today for much less money than this.

[03:18] It doesn't matter how sexy you make the game,

[03:21] it doesn't matter what you do with the code.

[03:23] I think people are clamoring for an all original new game,

[03:26] and if you've got War of the Worlds,

[03:28] and you wanna show us what Marty can do,

[03:31] and you're gonna make a modern pinball machine

[03:33] with modern everything,

[03:35] I think that's the smart move to do next.

[03:38] The problem is with Haggis,

[03:39] they box themselves into a corner.

[03:41] Remember he sold those series tickets deposits

[03:44] that were good for the next five remake games?

[03:47] Five remake games?

[03:50] They barely can get game number one out the door,

[03:53] and they've already taken deposits

[03:55] on four additional titles.

[03:57] All of this from day one has been a red flag

[04:00] to anybody who's been following this hobby

[04:03] as long as I have.

[04:04] Most of you have seen this movie too.

[04:07] This happens, it's like these people,

[04:08] they love pinball, they take their own money,

[04:11] and they run in and they think it's gonna be easy

[04:14] to scale up pinball manufacturing.

[04:17] So let me summarize what these documents

[04:19] are saying about Haggis pinball.

[04:21] First bullet, Damien currently owns Haggis

[04:24] as a sole shareholder.

[04:26] This is strange that there aren't any other equity investors

[04:30] funding the company.

[04:32] Tied with the fact that Haggis doesn't have any debt secured

[04:35] against the company from an Australian bank,

[04:38] means that he has financed the creation

[04:41] and running of the company purely

[04:43] from his own cash reserves, which is pretty unusual.

[04:48] Right there you kinda understand now

[04:51] why everything has been turned off,

[04:54] why they have not been transparent,

[04:57] and look, all of us, we have to have a level of empathy.

[05:00] For Damien to start a company like this

[05:03] and put all of his passion and his love into pinball

[05:06] is an admirable thing.

[05:08] But what happens to all of these people

[05:11] who get stars in their eyes around pinball is simply this.

[05:15] Manufacturing kills everybody,

[05:18] especially when you try to scale up manufacturing.

[05:22] It is so expensive to get your arms around

[05:26] the overhead cost of becoming

[05:28] a decently sized pinball manufacturing company.

[05:31] Remember, Spooky Pinball wasn't paying

[05:34] for any costs associated with their warehouses

[05:37] because the town of Benton, Wisconsin

[05:39] was giving them the property for nothing

[05:42] or the buildings for nothing.

[05:43] And then remember, Spooky Pinball

[05:45] built their company with family, right?

[05:47] It's like their family and friends

[05:49] are who were putting these games together.

[05:50] I think it's still their family and friends.

[05:52] I mean, the entire population of Benton, Wisconsin

[05:55] is basically building Spooky Machines.

[05:57] But for Damien to go from building like 50 kelts machines

[06:01] to building 500 fathoms,

[06:04] you're then gonna have to hire people.

[06:06] You're then gonna have to do a lot more work

[06:08] and you're not used to it.

[06:09] And the fact that all of this is out of his own pocket

[06:13] is kinda scary.

[06:15] He's a father, he's a husband.

[06:17] I think he worked in IT or some other area

[06:20] and made some money.

[06:21] But as my friend, John at Jackbar, Owey says,

[06:24] the fastest way to make a million dollars in pinball

[06:27] is to start with five million dollars

[06:30] and you quickly lose everything

[06:32] as you try to become a pinball manufacturer.

[06:34] All right, so here's the other document I got about Haggis.

[06:37] It's the known debt stuff.

[06:39] And this is the part where like,

[06:40] it gets a little bit concerning,

[06:42] but it also makes total sense

[06:43] why they need to raise revenue.

[06:46] It says Haggis has a number of trade creditors,

[06:49] wood, plastics and printing,

[06:51] who have registered secured debt charges

[06:54] against the company because they have purchased goods

[06:57] for the production of pinball, but not paid them.

[07:01] The way these debts have been registered

[07:03] means that Haggis Pinball is selling pinball machines,

[07:06] which are constructed of parts

[07:07] that other companies currently have

[07:09] a registered security interest over.

[07:12] All right, so look,

[07:13] I don't know the ins and outs of pinball manufacturing.

[07:15] I don't know how you work with vendors.

[07:17] I don't understand why a vendor would send a company

[07:21] its goods or services if they weren't paid, right?

[07:24] If you're selling Haggis wood or plastics

[07:26] or printing stuff for them,

[07:28] why would you send them stuff

[07:30] if they didn't pay their invoices?

[07:32] But this is how the world works, right?

[07:33] A lot of times work is done

[07:35] and stuff is given to contractors

[07:37] before the invoice is paid.

[07:40] And so look, it's not a mystery to any of us

[07:43] that Haggis Pinball is probably in a situation financially

[07:47] that is not the best.

[07:48] And here's my advice for Damian and Marty

[07:51] and everybody associated with Haggis.

[07:53] You're not gonna claw your way out of where you are

[07:57] if you remain in secrecy.

[07:59] We've seen this before.

[08:00] You're not gonna claw your way out

[08:02] of this financial situation

[08:04] by announcing your next game

[08:06] before you finish production of the fathoms.

[08:09] The only way out, and I understand this,

[08:12] I know this is the hardest advice for them to take.

[08:15] The only way out for Haggis Pinball is to be honest,

[08:19] to be truthful with a community

[08:22] that will understand what you're going through.

[08:25] But if you continue to hide

[08:27] and hide your feet in the corner of a fake production room,

[08:31] if you continue to go radio silent

[08:34] and then you're gonna try to pull the wall

[08:36] over people's eyes by announcing another game

[08:39] when you still have 200 plus fathoms to build,

[08:42] nobody's gonna go in on it.

[08:44] And look, nobody wants to see any company fail.

[08:47] Nobody wants to see any company fail,

[08:49] but going about it this way,

[08:51] we've been burned too many times

[08:54] by boutique companies doing this.

[08:56] They robbed Peter to pay Paul

[08:58] and the red flags around this company are everywhere.

[09:01] And look, it's Damian's company.

[09:03] It's Marty's company.

[09:05] And look, if someone were speaking

[09:07] about my pinball company, right?

[09:09] If some blowhard in New York City had a podcast

[09:11] and he went on the airwaves to his subscribers

[09:14] and he said, hey, look,

[09:15] this company is in a little bit of trouble,

[09:17] they're self-financed

[09:19] and now they're gonna try to pull a fast one

[09:21] by selling another game

[09:22] when they haven't finished production of the current game.

[09:24] You think I would just sit back and take it

[09:27] if I knew what that person was saying was incorrect?

[09:30] No, and look, I get it,

[09:32] it's a horrible place to be

[09:34] and you're probably staring at the numbers

[09:36] if you're Damian and the numbers don't work out.

[09:39] Nobody made these companies grow as fast as they grew.

[09:42] And I think Haggis' biggest mistake is unlike Spooky,

[09:46] they didn't grow slowly.

[09:47] They barely sold any kelts machines

[09:50] and then instantly they had a big factory.

[09:53] Instantly they had all this room, all this overhead

[09:55] and then they also had nobody to build the games.

[09:58] So you got the orders,

[10:00] but then you couldn't build the games.

[10:03] Every day that factory is not turning out machines,

[10:06] you're losing money.

[10:07] And the more days you're in the red than the green,

[10:10] it's not gonna work out.

[10:11] So look, we'll see what happens,

[10:13] but as I say to everybody,

[10:14] be very cautious about giving deposits.

[10:17] Make sure they can make the games.

[10:19] Don't buy a game until it's in a box,

[10:21] especially from a company that is proven

[10:24] they are not gonna get you the game

[10:25] when they say the game will be ready.

[10:27] And I do challenge Marty and Damian to stop hiding,

[10:31] come out, defend your company,

[10:33] talk about your company.

[10:34] Nobody's gonna be fooled

[10:35] by some polished video you're gonna put out.

[10:38] Nobody's gonna be fooled anymore

[10:39] by some jovial tone of voice.

[10:41] We wanna see a factory tour of Haggis Pimball Damian.

[10:45] Come on Marty, you go on your own podcast

[10:47] and you deflect, deflect, deflect for a year.

[10:49] Enough deflecting, go on Facebook Live,

[10:52] you took people's money,

[10:53] you tell people you want new money,

[10:55] so simply go on Facebook Live,

[10:57] walk around Haggis Pimball

[10:59] and show us what's going on on a random day.

[11:02] If you can't do that, you don't deserve anybody's money.

[11:05] Oh man, Canadian's all heated.

[11:06] Let's talk about He-Man enough about Haggis, right?

[11:09] Stern is gonna sell more He-Man Pimball machines

[11:12] in one day, then Haggis Pimball

[11:15] will sell of Pimball machines ever.

[11:17] All right, so He-Man, do I love this theme for Pimball?

[11:20] 100% yes, I love He-Man.

[11:23] I'll tell you why.

[11:24] It's a cartoon show that anybody who was a kid

[11:27] in the 1980s grew up watching He-Man

[11:30] and Skeletor and Ram-Man and Battle Cat and She-Ra

[11:35] and Castle Freakin' Grayskull and I've Got the Power.

[11:38] The show is on air, I believe it was 1983 to 1985 or 87.

[11:44] I think it was 85, I think there's like three years

[11:46] of He-Man, so here's the crazy part.

[11:48] It is the 40th anniversary of He-Man.

[11:51] Now look, if we follow what we've been saying

[11:54] that Stern's gonna make anniversary editions of games,

[11:57] does this now maybe suggest that He-Man

[12:00] is gonna be what they show at Comic-Con

[12:03] and it's gonna be the 40th anniversary

[12:05] of He-Man shown at Comic-Con?

[12:07] I still think it's gonna be Venom,

[12:09] but let's talk about He-Man.

[12:11] We already know Venom is in the works.

[12:13] Let's talk about He-Man.

[12:14] Who is gonna be designing He-Man?

[12:16] Now Jason Knapp said it's probably not gonna be Jack Danger

[12:20] and Jack Danger's been teasing He-Man now for a while.

[12:24] Now after coming off of like Foo Fighters,

[12:26] I think people are very excited that the designer

[12:28] for any future Stern machine might be Jack Danger.

[12:32] Jason Knapp seems to think it's gonna be John Borg

[12:35] who takes He-Man because Jack Danger

[12:37] wants to do something else.

[12:38] Now I thought John Borg was gonna do Indiana Jones

[12:41] because he made the other Stern Indiana Jones game

[12:44] that wasn't very good and he wanted to make up

[12:46] for that failure and so look, I don't know.

[12:49] If you ask me, who would you rather have design He-Man,

[12:53] Jack Danger or John Borg?

[12:55] I mean, that's a tough one, people.

[12:57] Jack has one game, John's got many, many games.

[13:01] I mean, everyone would probably just want Keith Elwyn

[13:03] to design everything.

[13:05] If we were to be honest, like let's be honest for a minute.

[13:07] Like at some point, everyone would rather

[13:09] just have Keith Elwyn because he's just a level

[13:11] above everybody right now and that's a good thing

[13:14] because everyone else underneath him at Stern

[13:17] is learning from Keith Elwyn.

[13:18] Like this is how you get better.

[13:20] You have someone more talented on your team

[13:22] and they improve your gameplay.

[13:24] Like everyone else is Scotty Pippin

[13:26] and freaking Keith Elwyn is Michael Jordan, right?

[13:29] Scotty Pippin doesn't become Scotty Pippin

[13:30] without Michael Jordan.

[13:32] So in terms of who's designing it, I don't know.

[13:34] Now look, as a theme, this is the part where I'm like,

[13:37] is this a dream theme for me?

[13:40] Is this a dream theme for the pinball buying community?

[13:43] Now look, it's a subjective thing.

[13:45] For me personally, it's not a dream theme.

[13:48] Like I haven't been mentioning He-Man

[13:51] all throughout these years as a pinball machine

[13:53] I would love to see, but what this machine has going for it

[13:57] is the most powerful thing emotionally

[13:59] when you think about stuff that you click with

[14:02] on an emotional level and that is nostalgia.

[14:05] The power of nostalgia is extremely powerful

[14:09] and when you get it right, it's really hard to resist.

[14:13] And so if Stern Pinball can make a He-Man machine

[14:17] that needs to be loaded with toys,

[14:19] it needs Castle Grayskull, it needs to have I have the power.

[14:23] I was thinking about like the code in the moment

[14:25] when He-Man says I have the power

[14:28] and the lights are going crazy and you feel like

[14:30] you're going from Adam to He-Man, that transition

[14:34] and the game and the music and everything going on,

[14:36] it just is perfect for pinball

[14:39] because it's so much fun when that happens in the show.

[14:42] But it needs to have toys, it needs like a medieval madness

[14:44] kind of Castle Grayskull castle.

[14:46] Like if they make He-Man and there is not a drawbridge

[14:50] that comes down, then what are we even doing here in pinball?

[14:54] Right? But the most important part of getting this game right,

[14:57] unlike Ninja Turtles, is they need to get the clips

[15:00] from the original cartoon that we grew up with.

[15:04] I don't want to see some reanimated version.

[15:07] I don't want to see new voice actors.

[15:09] I want to hear the voices from the cartoon I grew up with.

[15:13] I want to see the show I grew up with.

[15:15] They need to get the original He-Man rights.

[15:18] If they can't do it that way,

[15:21] don't even bother making the game.

[15:23] It was really weird with Ninja Turtles.

[15:25] It's why a lot of us, when we saw the pinball machine,

[15:28] it just felt weird.

[15:29] It's like, why are they reanimating these classic scenes

[15:32] that already have the show animated

[15:35] and animated better than Stern could ever do?

[15:38] So I was disappointed in that in Ninja Turtles.

[15:40] The other thing about Ninja Turtles

[15:41] that nobody really wants to talk about,

[15:43] it didn't really feel like Ninja Turtles, right?

[15:45] You're not really battling the foot clan.

[15:47] There wasn't really that many interesting toys

[15:50] in Ninja Turtles.

[15:51] It just felt a little stale.

[15:53] And then the game itself was very hard.

[15:55] When you ask people why they really don't like Ninja Turtles,

[15:58] it's because it's too hard.

[16:00] Like John Borg made it way too hard.

[16:02] The ball drains on the left side of that game all day long.

[16:07] You never feel like you can get into the game.

[16:10] And I do think you need to make He-Man,

[16:12] Masters of the Freakin' Universe,

[16:14] you need to make it a game that's a little bit more inviting.

[16:17] I'm tired of themes that get ruined by brutal gameplay

[16:22] because brutality is bad design.

[16:25] I mean this when I say it.

[16:26] A brutal game is a bad design pinball machine.

[16:29] You can still make a pinball machine hard

[16:32] without making it brutal to play.

[16:34] Like Ghostbusters is brutal.

[16:36] It's not fun to shoot that game.

[16:39] And there are some games out there

[16:40] that are just ruined by brutality of gameplay.

[16:44] Games like Rick and Morty are like that.

[16:46] You're just holding on for dear life.

[16:48] You never can really get into the game.

[16:50] And I know if the excuse is like,

[16:52] I don't like long ball times.

[16:53] I want a fast game.

[16:55] It mixes up the monotony of my collection.

[16:57] And I get it.

[16:58] Yeah, if you have a huge collection,

[17:00] then you might not mind a game that plays like that.

[17:03] But I think He-Man needs to be a game

[17:05] that's a little bit more inviting.

[17:07] Dare I say it?

[17:08] I wouldn't even mind a damn fan layout.

[17:10] Who cares?

[17:11] There's a reason why a fan layout is so popular

[17:13] because it's damn fun to shoot.

[17:15] And you can get through the game and you can hit the shots

[17:17] and you know where the ball is at all times.

[17:19] A fan layout.

[17:20] It's why so many classic games have utilized it

[17:23] if they can do it right.

[17:25] The other thing is who's the artist gonna be on He-Man

[17:28] because He-Man has such a distinct art style.

[17:31] Now the rumor is it's gonna be Randy Martinez.

[17:34] And he said that next to Star Wars,

[17:36] He-Man is one of his favorite properties.

[17:39] Now if you go look at Randy Martinez artwork,

[17:42] I'm like a little bit of a mixed bag

[17:44] because he's done one He-Man thing that's kind of weird.

[17:46] I hope his style syncs up properly

[17:50] with the He-Man look and feel.

[17:52] And we haven't seen Randy Martinez do anything

[17:55] other than the Mandalorian.

[17:56] Arguably the Mandalorian is a nice looking game.

[17:59] So I don't wanna get too down on whether or not

[18:01] he's gonna crush it until I see it.

[18:03] But look, it's a save thing with all Stearns right now.

[18:06] It's like, who do you wanna design it?

[18:07] Keith Elwin.

[18:08] Who do you want to do the artwork?

[18:10] Most likely, Zambietti.

[18:11] And look, Zambietti's art style is perfect

[18:14] for comic books stuff.

[18:16] So it's like perfect for stuff like He-Man.

[18:18] I would argue his art style is better for He-Man

[18:22] than it would be for something like Jaws

[18:24] or something like Godzilla.

[18:26] So, He-Man from Sturm Pimball.

[18:29] Now look, when might we see this game?

[18:31] This is the other big question

[18:32] because I thought we were gonna get Venom in like two weeks

[18:35] which I still think it's gonna be Venom.

[18:37] Then what is next?

[18:38] Keith Elwin's game is gonna come out next February.

[18:41] The rumor there is that it's going to be Jaws.

[18:44] So who knows?

[18:45] But I'll say this, Stearn is moving

[18:47] into its new factory in August.

[18:50] So we all have to remember that.

[18:52] That Stearn was on a three cornerstone schedule

[18:55] when they were in their old factory.

[18:58] So what do you think is gonna happen

[19:00] when Stearn Pimball moves into its new factory

[19:04] with even more room and more ability to manufacture?

[19:08] Will they get to a point

[19:10] where they have four cornerstone games a year?

[19:13] Every three months, a new Stearn.

[19:15] It already feels like too much, right?

[19:17] Because there's only so many times you can ask people

[19:20] to spend like seven to $13,000

[19:24] before your own buyer base runs out of room and money.

[19:28] But I think because He-Man is a super fun property,

[19:32] I think because He-Man is campy and nostalgic,

[19:35] I think it's a great theme for Pimball.

[19:37] And it hits the core Pimball buying demographic

[19:40] on the bullseye.

[19:41] But here is the thing I think Stearn needs to do.

[19:44] I don't wanna see 1,000 LEDs that all look the same.

[19:49] Because He-Man is such a special property

[19:52] that has heroes and villains,

[19:54] I really hope Stearn makes 500 He-Man editions

[19:58] and 500 Skeletor editions.

[20:01] I think they need to do that.

[20:02] Make the Skeletor editions purple.

[20:05] Make the He-Man like the green and the red

[20:07] and really try to mix it up a little bit.

[20:10] Because for this much money,

[20:12] we need to see Stearn put more of an effort

[20:15] to make these LEDs truly special.

[20:17] Remember, they did stuff like this with transformers

[20:20] with like Autobots and Decepticons.

[20:22] We've seen them do multiple LEDs with games like ACDC

[20:26] and stuff like that.

[20:27] And now that these games are costing twice as much money

[20:30] as the transformers, they surely can make us

[20:34] a He-Man and Skeletor edition of this game.

[20:37] Okay, so that's my take on this.

[20:40] Stearn's just not gonna stop.

[20:41] And this is why Stearn is so successful.

[20:45] They are gonna give something for everybody.

[20:47] Think about the ends of the spectrum.

[20:50] Led Zeppelin on one end

[20:51] and He-Man masters of the universe on the other.

[20:54] Like if you like 80s cartoons,

[20:56] they're gonna give you stuff.

[20:58] If you like music,

[20:59] they're gonna give you a ton of music to select from.

[21:01] If you like movies,

[21:03] they got so many different iconic movies in pinball format,

[21:06] not to mention TV shows.

[21:08] They get all the big properties.

[21:10] And then reality starts to set in

[21:13] that almost every single property

[21:16] that you wanna see made into a pinball machine,

[21:19] Stearn pinball has first dibs probably at everything.

[21:23] Everyone else is just making the leftovers

[21:26] that Stearn doesn't want.

[21:28] If you wanna see G1 Transformers,

[21:30] who's gonna get it?

[21:31] It's not gonna be Jersey Jack.

[21:32] And that's why when we see Jersey Jack

[21:34] getting a property, think about it.

[21:36] They never get any assets.

[21:37] They never sync up the video with the voices.

[21:40] They never get everything.

[21:41] And it's like those are the deals that Stearn doesn't want.

[21:44] And remember, Stearn hasn't made a game ever

[21:46] the way Jersey Jack is making them.

[21:48] They don't show you clips from the movie

[21:50] that are just muted left and right.

[21:52] They at least get voice actors to go over the voices

[21:55] or they do an all original adventure like Jurassic Park.

[21:59] Like they kind of still know what people want

[22:02] and they still try to get as close to the source material

[22:05] as people remember.

[22:07] But He-Man for me, it's a non-negotiable.

[22:09] It has to be the original show.

[22:11] Has to be the original voices

[22:14] or I would never go in on this game.

[22:16] So we will see what they do.

[22:18] Will it come out in a few weeks?

[22:19] Will it be Venom?

[22:21] This is why I love pinball podcasting.

[22:23] I love all of your support.

[22:24] Thank you guys so much for being a member

[22:26] of the Canadian Club.

[22:27] More great episodes coming.

[22:29] And look, you got back to back episodes.

[22:31] No one else is doing it like this.

[22:32] Oh, my boy Don.

[22:33] He just interviewed Jason Knapp at the volume levels, Don.

[22:36] He got to get the volume levels up.

[22:38] It sounded like Jason Knapp was down the hallway

[22:40] when I was listening this morning to the show.

[22:43] Everybody, tons of great content out there.

[22:45] Tons of great reasons to be happy and alive in this world.

[22:48] Every day above ground is a really good day.

[22:51] We got some more bad news in the family this week.

[22:54] I don't want to go into details about it,

[22:55] but I'm going to say this right now.

[22:57] Your health and happiness are the most important thing.

[23:00] And every day we are above ground

[23:03] and we get to argue and complain

[23:05] and get excited about pinball is a blessing, people.

[23:09] It really is.

[23:10] Love all of you.

[23:11] Thank you so much.

[23:11] Later.
