[00:00] Welcome everybody to Canada's Pinball Podcast, the only Pinball Podcaster giving you three

[00:21] shows in a week.

[00:22] Are you getting your money's worth?

[00:23] So here's what I want to talk about.

[00:25] And I know I've been a little bit down and out on Pinball, and I've been trying to get

[00:29] to the source of this, I've been saying,

[00:30] Chris, why are you so sort of bummed out

[00:33] about the pinball scene in 2022?

[00:36] And then I did a little research and I started to dig.

[00:39] And I asked one simple question.

[00:41] How many games have been announced

[00:44] and are shipping new in box in 2022?

[00:48] Like what kind of year has this been

[00:51] as we go into November next week?

[00:54] How many games defined this year?

[00:57] And I wanna break it down for you.

[00:59] And when I give you this information,

[01:01] you're gonna understand why I came

[01:04] to the following conclusion.

[01:06] That 2022 has been the worst year

[01:10] in pinball new in box games that we've received

[01:15] in the five or six years I've been covering this hobby.

[01:18] And here's the thing that's crazy about all of this.

[01:21] Not only do I think this has been the worst year

[01:24] for like new in box games that got revealed

[01:27] and shipped to customers,

[01:28] it's also the most expensive pinball has ever been.

[01:33] And think about those two opposing forces.

[01:36] We're getting games that are underwhelming most people.

[01:39] And then we're charging more money for these games.

[01:43] So are we surprised that some people are starting

[01:46] to get a little bit uninterested

[01:49] and losing some of their enthusiasm for pinball?

[01:52] Now here's the thing, it's just been an off year.

[01:55] And I know there's supply shortages.

[01:57] I know the cost of goods has gone up.

[02:00] And I know that manufacturing is harder

[02:03] and harder and harder than it's ever been.

[02:05] But still it was a year in which demand

[02:09] for pinball went through the roof.

[02:11] And as an industry with all of these companies

[02:14] saying they are making pinball machines as an industry,

[02:18] the entire pinball industry failed to deliver new games

[02:24] that satiate it the extreme demand for pinball.

[02:28] And that is why we are seeing an explosion

[02:31] in used game prices.

[02:33] Because if you want something new,

[02:35] you can't really get what's new.

[02:38] You gotta go get something that is old

[02:40] and will be new in your home, okay?

[02:43] And I don't even wanna hear from operators out there

[02:46] who are gonna tell me something like,

[02:48] this game earns incredibly well.

[02:50] Let me state, and I've never done this before,

[02:52] let me state right now.

[02:54] This is not a podcast whose target audience is operators.

[02:59] Every single new pin for the most part

[03:01] is gonna do well on location.

[03:04] I have put so much money into Toy Story.

[03:07] I put money into Legends of Vahala.

[03:10] I will never own those games.

[03:12] It is like saying that a prostitute is a great lady

[03:17] because she gets so much action.

[03:19] Do you wanna marry her?

[03:21] That's the difference, everybody.

[03:22] And I know that's a little bit of a weird analogy,

[03:25] but it's true.

[03:26] I am looking at games.

[03:28] Are these games something you want to buy

[03:30] and put in your home?

[03:32] Because 98% of my audience

[03:35] are not operating pinball machines.

[03:37] Joe Abadi, I still love you,

[03:38] and I love every time you chime in on Facebook.

[03:41] Okay, so here's the data.

[03:42] Let's go down the list of what companies gave us in 2022.

[03:48] And when they announced the games

[03:49] that we are talking about in present day,

[03:52] we're gonna start with Stern Pinball.

[03:54] Now, Stern Pinball announced January 4th, 2022.

[03:59] So this year, that is when Rush Pinball was announced.

[04:03] Now, look, Rush Pinball is a game

[04:06] that I hear good things about,

[04:08] but I just wanna say this about Rush.

[04:10] I hear good stuff about John Borg's machine,

[04:13] but I still think this was not a game

[04:15] that became a mainstream hit.

[04:17] I don't think it's a game that excites

[04:19] the majority of the pinball buying community,

[04:23] and I think it's more of a wet dream for Rush fans,

[04:26] and that's fine, like that's okay, right?

[04:28] Then on June 21st, 2022,

[04:32] Stern Pinball announced their NFT game.

[04:35] You know, that Zambietti NFT machine,

[04:37] they made just one of them.

[04:39] I think they auctioned it off.

[04:41] It was a reskin of heavy metal game.

[04:43] Nobody cared about it.

[04:45] They didn't set the world on fire.

[04:47] It was a really weird move for Stern Pinball

[04:49] trying to jump into the NFT craze.

[04:52] So that happened.

[04:53] And then on September 22nd, 2022,

[04:57] Stern Pinball announced James Bond,

[05:00] one of the worst and weirdest and strangest rollout

[05:04] in Stern Pinball history,

[05:05] because here we are, and it is almost November,

[05:08] and these games are still not on the line.

[05:11] Now, what we are hearing is James Bond Pro

[05:14] is gonna be on the line sometime in November

[05:17] and Ellie's in December.

[05:19] But if you factor in shipping and actually getting a machine,

[05:23] I think it's safe to say that the majority of people

[05:27] who are waiting for a James Bond machine

[05:30] will not be unboxing it any time in 2022.

[05:34] So you gotta remember that, and that's it.

[05:36] That's it from Stern Pinball.

[05:38] There were not many machines being unboxed

[05:40] that were brand new.

[05:41] I'm not talking about Godzilla's or Mandalorians

[05:44] or Stranger Things or them rerunning premiums.

[05:47] I am simply talking about the new games

[05:50] that were revealed or announced around 2022.

[05:54] Then we get to Jersey Jack Pinball.

[05:56] On June 20th, 2022, Jersey Jack Pinball

[06:00] gave us the highly anticipated release

[06:03] of Pat Lawler's farewell game known as Toy Story.

[06:07] But it wasn't Toy Story, it was Toy Story 4.

[06:11] And it was impact with toys.

[06:13] It had absolutely no toys in it.

[06:15] And so this game, I think had a 24 hour huge hype window.

[06:21] Remember when Ken Cromwell was like,

[06:23] we're gonna give you the best shot

[06:25] at landing a collector's edition

[06:26] and here's how you're gonna be able to get one.

[06:28] And then what happened?

[06:30] Once we saw the game, once we saw how little was in it

[06:34] and it was based on the theme we didn't want

[06:36] and then it was ridiculously priced at 12,000

[06:40] for an unlimited LE basically

[06:42] and $15,000 for CEs in which they were gonna make

[06:46] a thousand of them and overnight

[06:49] the demand for this game went away.

[06:52] Overnight the enthusiasm for this game just dissipated.

[06:55] And as of today, if you bought this game,

[06:58] you lost $2,000 right away.

[07:01] And the price is gonna keep going down on this game.

[07:04] Greg Bone can't even sell his for 10 too.

[07:06] Nobody has the guts to offer an LE for sale

[07:10] below $10,000.

[07:12] But what we're looking at right now

[07:13] is the market for this game is below 10 Gs

[07:16] if you have an LE.

[07:18] All right, then we get to spooky pinball, right?

[07:20] So spooky pinball, you might be saying,

[07:21] hey, Halloween and Ultramans

[07:23] have been shipping throughout the year,

[07:25] but let's go back.

[07:26] Remember when these games were announced and revealed?

[07:28] You know what date it was?

[07:30] July 5th of 2021, right?

[07:34] These are not new games.

[07:35] These are just them making these games

[07:37] they announced a long time ago.

[07:40] Now they did announce a remake of TNA 2.0

[07:43] on September 5th of 2022,

[07:46] but it's a remake of TNA.

[07:48] And now a game that used to be $6,000 is now $9,000.

[07:54] Just think about that for a minute.

[07:55] A $6,000 game is being remade just a few years later

[08:00] and is now 50% more money.

[08:02] Okay, can you see why people might not be loving

[08:05] the state of affairs and current day pinball?

[08:07] Then we get the Chicago Gaming Company.

[08:10] They announced Cactus Canyon remake August 21st, 2021, right?

[08:17] They unveiled the game at Expo 2021.

[08:21] And here we are going into November

[08:23] and not one single Ellie of the game has shipped.

[08:27] We are now hearing that Ryan White is saying

[08:29] the excuse is the topper.

[08:31] Can you imagine this?

[08:33] How could it take you over a year

[08:35] to find a vendor to make that topper?

[08:39] Absolutely bonkers, inexcusable.

[08:41] They even revealed the game

[08:43] if they didn't have their vendors lined up.

[08:45] Is it Canada being too negative?

[08:47] Am I toxic?

[08:49] Or is this the only pinball podcast

[08:50] that will actually call this stuff out?

[08:53] That will actually go back and give you these dates?

[08:55] That will actually go back and remind everybody

[08:59] of all of the false promises we got from these companies.

[09:03] Remember when they took orders on Cactus Canyon, Ellie,

[09:06] they said the games would be shipping

[09:07] by the end of the year.

[09:09] I didn't say it, they did.

[09:11] And then I love it.

[09:12] It's like, these are not lies, Chris, they're not lies.

[09:14] You don't understand about what's going on in China.

[09:16] You don't understand about supply shortages.

[09:19] I do know this.

[09:20] If I tell my boss, I'm gonna have that report for you

[09:23] in six weeks and then I don't.

[09:25] What happens to me?

[09:26] Am I not held accountable?

[09:27] Was I not lying to them

[09:29] about when I would deliver the report?

[09:31] It's time we stop making excuses.

[09:34] Then don't reveal your game.

[09:36] Don't release your game.

[09:37] Don't announce your game.

[09:38] Don't take people's money

[09:39] if you don't have the games on the line.

[09:42] Now, speaking of having games on the line,

[09:44] let's go to Haggis Pinball next.

[09:46] They announced Fathom, are you waiting for it?

[09:49] April 26th of 2021.

[09:53] April 26th of 2021.

[09:56] How many Fathoms do you think they've shipped to date?

[10:00] I bet it's not even a hundred.

[10:02] I bet it's not even 50 games have been shipped to customers

[10:06] since April 26th of 2021.

[10:09] Legends of Vahala, American Pinball, right?

[10:12] Legends of Vahala, the game, everybody won it, right?

[10:15] The game everybody was clamoring for before AP made it.

[10:18] Yeah, okay, I'm making that up.

[10:19] I'm being sarcastic here.

[10:20] It's Friday and as you can tell, I'm in a good mood.

[10:24] American Pinball announced Legends of Vahala

[10:27] October 22nd, 2021.

[10:30] What did they deliver in 2022?

[10:32] No new games, no new announcements.

[10:35] Now, David Ficks did deliver some podcasts

[10:38] in which he said American Pinball

[10:39] is gonna have four lines of production going,

[10:42] four lines of production.

[10:43] And all they can do is remake a game

[10:46] that was made years ago

[10:47] before they announced Legends of Vahala.

[10:50] Can you tell why I think this industry is inefficient?

[10:53] Why this industry has lost a lot of people's enthusiasm

[10:57] in the new products?

[10:58] Because this stuff is just comical.

[10:59] Let's go to Multimorphic.

[11:01] Multimorphic, the company that we've been saying,

[11:03] Jerry, you need a license theme.

[11:05] And he finally did get a license theme.

[11:07] And he actually did announce his game this year.

[11:10] And Weird Owl, arguably, is the most in-demand

[11:14] Multimorphic P3 game to date.

[11:16] And it was announced February 22nd of 2022.

[11:21] So that is a game that was announced this year.

[11:24] They've made some this year and they've shipped some this year.

[11:27] But here's the problem.

[11:28] How many, how many has he actually shipped?

[11:32] I bet it's less than 25.

[11:33] He can come out and say, I'm wrong.

[11:35] I have not seen more than like 10 unboxings of this game.

[11:39] And hey, if you have this game,

[11:41] please unbox it and let us know.

[11:43] Then we get to the Pinball Brothers.

[11:45] The Pinball Brothers, they're not even brothers.

[11:47] The Pinball Brothers unraveled

[11:49] the mystery of Andrew Highway's alien.

[11:51] They remade that and then we knew

[11:53] they were gonna make Queen Pinball.

[11:55] Now Queen Pinball was officially announced July 21st, 2022.

[12:01] So that's another game that was part

[12:03] of this year's announcements and reveals.

[12:05] Now remember, when they announced this game,

[12:08] what did they say?

[12:09] We're gonna be making them this year.

[12:10] We saw some distributors taking money on the games,

[12:13] saying you're gonna be at the front of the line

[12:15] if you pay in full now.

[12:17] And these are non-refundable deposits

[12:19] and you're gonna get your game by the end of the year

[12:21] production starts in October.

[12:22] Okay, so what happens?

[12:24] Those distributors take that money,

[12:26] these guys go to Pinball Expo

[12:27] and then they announce we're delayed, we're delayed.

[12:31] We're not gonna be making games this year.

[12:32] The games are not gonna be shipping this year.

[12:34] Okay, so another game that was revealed

[12:37] way before it should have been another game

[12:40] that has underwhelmed us and so here we are.

[12:43] And last but not least on our list is Bitronik.

[12:46] Now you might be saying,

[12:47] Kaneda, who the heck is Bitronik?

[12:49] Well, these are the guys who made the Super Hoops game,

[12:52] which was announced January 28th of 2022

[12:56] and they actually made some of these games and shipped them

[12:59] out. I don't think anyone in America got one.

[13:01] Cengiz got one over in Denmark and then what happened?

[13:04] Their factory like burned down like a few weeks ago.

[13:08] So no one's getting any more Super Hoops.

[13:10] So in totality, if you remove James Bond

[13:14] because nobody has it yet,

[13:15] as we go into November of 2022,

[13:19] imagine being a pinball podcaster

[13:21] and your job is to cover the news

[13:23] and what's going on in pinball.

[13:25] Now you can tell why Kaneda deserves

[13:28] all of your $5 a month because I've made this year

[13:31] far more entertaining than these pinball companies

[13:34] have made it because as I go down this list,

[13:37] these are the games that are really gonna be battling

[13:40] and out at the Twippies for like best pinball machine,

[13:43] best design, best this, best that.

[13:45] Ready for it? Rush pinball, Toy Story 4,

[13:49] TNA 2, Weird Owl and Super Hoops and that's it.

[13:54] You could throw James Bond in just at the last 11th hour

[13:58] but that was the state of pinball in 2022.

[14:03] Super Hoops, Weird Owl, TNA remake, Toy Story 4 and Rush.

[14:08] And when these games came out,

[14:10] all of them came with a price increase

[14:13] and now we are paying more for pinball

[14:15] than we've ever spent before

[14:18] and this is the creativity we're getting.

[14:21] These are the themes we're getting.

[14:23] This is the imagination we're getting in pinball

[14:26] and pinball demand is through the roof.

[14:29] There are more people in the world

[14:31] that wanna buy these machines, that wanna collect them,

[14:34] that wanna spend their hard earned money on these games

[14:38] and so how can you disagree with Kaneda?

[14:42] That 2022 was one of the biggest whiffs

[14:46] in the history of pinball manufacturing,

[14:49] one of the biggest whiffs in terms of theme

[14:52] and theme integration.

[14:53] It was one of the most underwhelming years ever in pinball

[14:57] and I know what you're gonna say

[14:59] but Chris, I've enjoyed pinball

[15:01] because I've been playing my pins and of course you have.

[15:04] I'm not saying you haven't had fun in pinball.

[15:06] I'm not saying you didn't have a good time

[15:08] at the pinball shows.

[15:09] I'm not saying you haven't had a great time

[15:12] following podcasts like this.

[15:14] Of course we still love pinball.

[15:16] Of course we still are having a good time as a community

[15:19] but this is not about that.

[15:21] This show is about how these manufacturers

[15:24] have absolutely given us one of the most inefficient years

[15:29] in the history of pinball

[15:30] and so obviously outside forces had something to do with this.

[15:34] It is, like there was a supply chain issue.

[15:37] There's issues with getting chips.

[15:39] There's issues with vendors.

[15:40] I'm hearing that American Pinball's new game is delayed

[15:43] because they can't find a vendor to make the cabinets

[15:46] and it's not surprising, right?

[15:48] Because Dennis Norman has redesigned the cabinet.

[15:51] So now you can't go to standard cabinet makers

[15:54] who have been making pinball cabinet

[15:56] and you can't give them the order

[15:57] because Dennis Norman thinks it's important

[16:00] to make the cabinet look like a spaceship or a tank

[16:03] and cool, that's very ambitious

[16:05] but maybe they should have thought it through

[16:07] that if we do this, finding a vendor might be impossible

[16:11] or it might delay us by six months

[16:14] and if that happens, nobody's buying your damn legends

[16:17] of the Hala standard editions, David Fix.

[16:20] The only person ordering that game has two names,

[16:24] David and Fix and it's about time we all realize this.

[16:28] See, I love it because you know what?

[16:29] We're all on the same team.

[16:31] I mean, if you're listening to Canada right now,

[16:34] we are all on the same team.

[16:36] We are looking at our wallets.

[16:38] We're looking at these games.

[16:40] We're looking at all the failed promises

[16:42] and all the stupid fumbled launches that we keep getting.

[16:46] You mean how many times can a pinball company

[16:49] keep making the same mistake?

[16:50] Don't reveal your game until it's on the freaking line.

[16:55] You don't have to worry that there's gonna be buyers.

[16:57] Like do what Spooky did.

[16:59] They revealed TNA too as the game was on the line.

[17:03] People were unboxing it a few weeks later.

[17:06] Now what's gonna happen in the tail end of 2022?

[17:10] And I think what I just talked about indicates one thing.

[17:13] This year is up for grabs.

[17:15] This year is up for grabs.

[17:16] In the next two months, I think if any game comes out

[17:19] that actually has some magic,

[17:21] that actually has some creativity,

[17:23] that actually feels like it's worth the money,

[17:26] it's gonna attract people

[17:28] because this was one of the most unattractive years

[17:31] in pinball and the other thing is this.

[17:33] I'm gonna say this, I'll play devil's advocate.

[17:35] I know many of you out there

[17:37] have been waiting for your Stern premiums.

[17:39] Many of you out there ordered games like Elvira,

[17:43] Jurassic Park, Mandalorian, Godzilla,

[17:47] and Stern was on a backlog of all of those titles.

[17:50] So for a lot of you out there,

[17:52] you've been unboxing games,

[17:54] they just aren't games that came out this year.

[17:58] And that is what has satiated most of you.

[18:01] As you know, that doesn't satiate Canada

[18:04] because I don't unbox anything.

[18:06] I'm just here to comment on the industry

[18:09] and what's happening and the news, rumors, and speculation.

[18:13] So it's been a really rough year

[18:16] for pinball content creators

[18:18] and making this thing interesting.

[18:20] I wanna thank each and every one of you

[18:22] for tuning in every week to Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[18:25] We are over 540 club members.

[18:28] Every effort to cancel this show has failed.

[18:32] We are still here having a good time.

[18:34] Tomorrow I'm gonna do the Saturday morning spectacular.

[18:38] We are gonna see this Keith Elwyn James Bond.

[18:41] The new rumor is the game is gonna be $18,000.

[18:44] Like it's so stupid.

[18:45] Like it's absolutely stupid

[18:47] that you need to make $36,000 before taxes

[18:51] to buy a single level game from Stern Pinball.

[18:54] All because they wanna arbitrarily limit the number to 500.

[18:58] Great, Keith Elwyn is a man of the people.

[19:01] For them to do this and make a game

[19:03] that's only for rich dudes

[19:04] and all the tournament players who love Keith Elwyn

[19:08] are not gonna be able to buy one.

[19:10] What a great feel good story this is gonna be, right?

[19:13] I can't wait for this game to come out.

[19:15] I can't wait for the people to try to justify this.

[19:19] Even if it sells, it doesn't matter

[19:21] because if this thing sells out immediately at those prices,

[19:25] you know what that symbolizes?

[19:26] We're all screwed.

[19:28] Why are people rooting for these things

[19:30] that be successful?

[19:32] None of you are investors in Stern Pinball.

[19:34] You're absolutely cheerleading

[19:36] and supporting the very thing

[19:39] that is making this hobby less enjoyable.

[19:42] It's really strange to me.

[19:43] And it's just real simple now, right?

[19:45] It all comes down to one thing.

[19:47] The greatest bang for your buck in Pinball.

[19:50] The most exciting and entertaining thing in Pinball

[19:54] costs $5 a month.

[19:56] It's the Canada Club.

[19:58] And you all should go get some of your friends to join

[20:01] so we can get to 1,000.

[20:03] Everybody have a happy, happy Halloween.

[20:05] And I really do wanna say be happy, be healthy,

[20:08] and be safe.

[20:08] You know, don't be lighting fireworks

[20:10] or throwing M80s inside your Toy Story 4.

[20:13] I mean, that would be the only thing

[20:14] that would make Toy Story 4 exciting.

[20:16] If you threw a bunch of fireworks inside it

[20:18] and lit the fuse and say, hey, Pat Lawler,

[20:20] how could you do this, Pat?

[20:22] How could you think this is a $15,000 machine?

[20:24] I can't believe it.

[20:25] Everybody will talk to you soon, Canada Out.

[20:28] Night is all night.

[20:29] And you can try to change my mind.

[20:32] Tonight is where you're going.

[20:34] What's a girl gonna do?

[20:36] What's a girl gonna do?

[20:38] I'm far too shy tonight.

[20:39] I can't believe I'm still a bit too old.

[20:41] When I walk in the room, I can still make the whole

[20:44] vacation lie.
