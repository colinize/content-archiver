[00:00] I spend my whole day living in a material world.

[00:04] And I am a material girl.

[00:06] You know that we are living in a material world.

[00:10] And I am a material girl.

[00:17] Alright, Canadian Club Episode 9.

[00:21] I want to thank each and every one of you for your contributions.

[00:24] You get these special episodes on this episode.

[00:27] Here's what I want to talk about.

[00:29] I want to talk about Jersey Jack Pimball

[00:31] and how I think they're making a huge, huge miscalculation

[00:37] about their own company.

[00:39] I know I don't run them,

[00:40] but I really think Jersey Jack Pimball is at a crossroads

[00:45] in which they are either going to go in one direction

[00:48] and they're going to chase I think the wrong company

[00:51] or they can go in another direction.

[00:53] And I think be the Pimball Company,

[00:56] this company always should have been.

[00:58] But before I do that, I want to quickly talk about Stern's Godzilla.

[01:02] I'm here to confirm for you 1,000%.

[01:05] It is Godzilla.

[01:06] You are going to see the teaser probably today.

[01:09] I mean that.

[01:10] We're going to see the teaser by the end of this week.

[01:12] The teaser video will show you just the name Godzilla.

[01:16] Stern loves to do this, right?

[01:18] They sort of give you the confirmation that it's coming.

[01:21] And then the next week,

[01:22] we will get the full game reveal.

[01:25] It is Keith Ellwyn.

[01:26] It is Zombie Yeti.

[01:28] It is their team of coders that have worked with Ellwyn in the past.

[01:31] And here's what I'm hearing about Godzilla.

[01:33] This is the first time anyone's going to hear this

[01:35] and you're hearing it because you're a member of the Canadian Club.

[01:38] So I am hearing that this game has three flippers.

[01:42] Okay, that's not a shocking revelation

[01:44] considering Keith Ellwyn loves to have that upper flipper shot.

[01:47] I'm also hearing that this has one pop bumper.

[01:50] One pop bumper that's down low,

[01:52] Aala Circus Voltaire.

[01:54] So that is something new that we haven't seen

[01:57] in a Keith Ellwyn game before.

[01:59] I'm hearing that this is going to be Stern's nicest world

[02:04] under glass since Ghostbusters.

[02:06] That there are going to be sculpted buildings in this game.

[02:09] And when you look down, it's just a world exploding up off of that wood.

[02:14] The other thing I heard is there's not one major mechanism

[02:18] but there's a lot of ramps, a lot of wire forms.

[02:22] That is why I'm hearing this game is Ghostbusters meets Avengers

[02:26] Infinity Quest.

[02:27] And if you look at Avengers, right?

[02:29] If you look down at that game, there's a lot of ramps,

[02:32] there's a lot of wire forms.

[02:33] The ball's going up, it's going left, it's going right.

[02:36] It looks really, really cool.

[02:38] All of the metal wire form in Avengers.

[02:41] But here's something that I've been thinking about

[02:42] because doing those metal wire forms

[02:45] and having this sort of roller coaster kind of appearance

[02:48] to a pinball machine, it's very cool.

[02:50] You definitely want to jump on and see the ball whip around

[02:54] all those wire forms.

[02:55] But the truth is this, those wire forms are really cheap.

[03:00] It's really, really cheap for Stern to make metal ramps

[03:03] and wire forms take over most of the real estate of a pinball machine.

[03:08] And I'm a little bit worried that Stern is still not going to really push

[03:12] the envelope of toys and mechanisms.

[03:15] That there's still going to double down on stuff that doesn't break,

[03:19] stuff that's not hard to manufacture,

[03:21] and stuff that doesn't have really much mechanical movement.

[03:25] And I'm going to be somewhat sad if we see Godzilla

[03:27] and it doesn't have something like the T-Rex mech in this game.

[03:31] I mean, it's Godzilla battling all these monsters,

[03:35] stomping on tanks, walking through Tokyo.

[03:38] How can this game not have some big mechanical mech that's going to wow us?

[03:43] I don't think it's in it.

[03:44] I don't expect to see it now.

[03:46] The other thing I heard this game has is a rotating table,

[03:50] a la Batman 66.

[03:51] So will that be in the game?

[03:53] So that's what I'm hearing that there's a rotating section,

[03:55] a pop bumper, and the lower section of the game,

[03:57] three flippers, lots of metal ramps,

[04:00] and lots of wire forms weaving around all of these buildings.

[04:04] So we will see this game very soon next week.

[04:07] And I'm also hearing that the L.E. art package is stunning.

[04:11] All the art packages are nice,

[04:12] but Zombie Eddie went the extra mile on the L.E. of this game.

[04:17] I also heard that there's going to be artwork around the QR code area.

[04:21] So for those of you thinking it's going to be this ugly red,

[04:24] like scan your QR code here,

[04:26] nope, I think they've implemented it into the art package nicely.

[04:29] And Stern's going to use Godzilla as a way to launch all of their new innovations together.

[04:35] I do think this will be a statement game.

[04:37] I do think this game is going to sell out day one for the L.E.s.

[04:41] And unfortunately, I was looking on the pin-side marketplace yesterday.

[04:45] Unfortunately, where the market is at, I saw it.

[04:48] Someone listed Ghostbusters L.E. for $15,000.

[04:52] Everyone thinks every single pinball machine that Stern has made that's an L.E.

[04:55] is now worth over $10,000.

[04:57] The market is really stupid right now.

[04:59] And the problem with the market being so stupid right now

[05:02] is that nobody, nobody who can get their hands on an L.E.

[05:06] is ever going to give it up and let their neighbor buy it for MSRP.

[05:10] You would almost be stupid not to just get the game

[05:13] and sell it for $4,000 or $5,000 more than you paid for it.

[05:17] I mean, we are at the point now.

[05:19] We're a $10,000 pinball machine.

[05:21] We'll give you a 50% return on your investment on day one.

[05:26] Before anyone even flips this machine,

[05:28] we are probably going to see Godzilla pinball machines sell for $15,000.

[05:33] Even though Stern sold it to you for $10,000,

[05:35] the market is insane right now.

[05:38] Nothing I say will change that.

[05:40] It's disappointing to me seeing all of this happen

[05:42] because I would rather, and I mean this,

[05:45] I would rather buy the machine from Stern pinball for $15,000

[05:50] and they would put $5,000 more worth of stuff in the game.

[05:55] And that's the real tragedy of all of these inflated prices.

[05:58] Is Ghostbusters doesn't have $7,000 more in it now?

[06:02] They didn't fix the shot geometry in a Ghostbusters L.E.

[06:05] The game is still horrible.

[06:07] But the reason why I think Godzilla is going to do so well for Stern

[06:11] it's going to be as beautiful as Ghostbusters was.

[06:14] But shoot as good as a Keith L.E. pin.

[06:17] And I don't think we've had a Keith L.E. pin

[06:21] that has been as beautiful as Ghostbusters

[06:23] and shoots as good as a Keith L.E. pin.

[06:26] I think his best shooting game is still Iron Maiden,

[06:28] but that theme and that artwork is not as good as Ghostbusters

[06:32] and I think Jurassic Park was probably his best game,

[06:36] but the art package on it, not that great.

[06:38] And so I think this could be the one.

[06:40] Now what's going to be interesting about Godzilla

[06:42] when you think about it, are they going to use clips

[06:45] from the original Godzilla series?

[06:47] I'm not sure what's going to be up on that screen.

[06:50] I'm not sure what the mission of the game is.

[06:52] So we shall see, but everything in the pinball world

[06:55] is about to be taken over by Godzilla.

[06:58] Now Godzilla coming out right now is the worst news

[07:01] you could get if you're American pinball.

[07:04] David Fix made a colossal mistake.

[07:06] He waited too long.

[07:08] And their next game, I'm telling you, it's Legends of Vahala

[07:12] and he's going to release it after Godzilla

[07:14] and it's going to fall completely flat.

[07:16] He waited too long.

[07:18] If he launched it a few months ago,

[07:20] he would have got at least 500 I think sold.

[07:23] I think now nobody cares.

[07:25] I also think Godzilla is going to put a lot more pressure

[07:28] on cactus canyon remake.

[07:30] There's just no way that this hobby can absorb

[07:34] four to five titles, all priced around $10,000

[07:38] all at once.

[07:39] It's going to be more an issue of space than money even.

[07:42] It's just getting kind of nutty

[07:44] how this industry can't space itself out better

[07:47] than it is right now.

[07:48] All right, so that's Stern Godzilla coming next week.

[07:51] So Jersey Jack Pinball, this is the company

[07:54] as we're about to approach on the one year anniversary

[07:57] of guns and roses coming out.

[07:59] And all the times that Jersey Jack has told us

[08:02] he wants to ship two games a year.

[08:05] They have never been able to do that.

[08:07] They've never been able to even release

[08:09] or reveal two games in a year, let alone make two games a year.

[08:13] So guns and roses has obviously been a huge hit for them.

[08:17] They've sold over 5,000 guns and roses machines.

[08:21] We all know about the quality issues.

[08:23] We all know about that.

[08:24] So here is what I'm hearing and this is a rumor

[08:26] but this is what I'm hearing is the future direction

[08:29] of Jersey Jack Pinball.

[08:30] I'm hearing that Pat Lawler's last game will be Toy Story

[08:34] that he is looking to retire after Toy Story comes out.

[08:38] So this could be the final game of Pat Lawler

[08:41] that Steve Richie will step into that senior leadership role

[08:45] when Pat retires.

[08:47] I'm also hearing that Eric Minier's next game is completed.

[08:51] I'm hearing it's done.

[08:52] I'm hearing it's sitting next to Toy Story

[08:54] and I'm hearing they're playing it today.

[08:56] I'm hearing his next game is a game

[08:58] that's gonna be fast.

[08:59] It's a game that's designed to have speed

[09:01] and to have quick shots with a lot of flow

[09:04] which is really interesting, right?

[09:06] We're so used to Eric like loading up with mechanisms.

[09:10] So Will Erick's game be something

[09:11] that's much more wide open and have speed as the main element?

[09:14] I'm also, this is just me speculating.

[09:17] If it's a fast game with a lot of speed,

[09:19] I do think it's gonna be the Matrix.

[09:21] I think that's the title that makes the most sense

[09:24] and I think the Matrix, if you think about speed,

[09:26] I can see Matrix being this game

[09:28] that has a combination of speed and flow

[09:30] with a lot of magnets and doing really cool stuff

[09:33] with magnets and speed to bring that Matrix world to life

[09:37] because that's what the Matrix was all about.

[09:39] That sort of, you move fast,

[09:41] you're fighting all these enemies, you're doing Kung Fu

[09:44] and then all of a sudden it slows down and it rotates.

[09:47] So I'm curious to see if it's going to be the Matrix

[09:50] and if Eric's game's gonna be something

[09:52] that's much more speed focused.

[09:54] But here is the other thing that I'm hearing

[09:56] is that Steve Richie has also been brought into

[09:59] Jersey Jack Pimball to do a few things.

[10:02] He's been brought in to make their games easier to manufacture,

[10:07] to make it so it's not so difficult

[10:09] and not so complex to make Jersey Jack machines.

[10:13] If that's the case, it means Jersey Jack Pimball

[10:15] is trying to move in the direction of Stern Pimball.

[10:18] When you lift the play field on a Stern machine,

[10:21] you will see why Stern Pimball makes so much money

[10:27] they've figured out a way to really get the bomb

[10:31] to a low place and to really make the games look stunning

[10:35] without a lot of mechanical stuff in these games.

[10:38] You go and lift the hood on most modern Stern machines

[10:41] and there's not much under the play field.

[10:43] If you go and lift the hood on a hobbit

[10:46] or a wizard of Oz or a dialed in,

[10:49] you are gonna see so much under that play field,

[10:52] so much so that it's immediately apparent

[10:55] that Jersey Jack Pimball's profit margins

[10:57] are nowhere near what Sterns must be.

[11:00] So much so that it's apparent that making

[11:03] and manufacturing a Jersey Jack Pimball machine

[11:06] is 10 times the headache than it is over at Stern

[11:09] for their manufacturing line.

[11:11] And so Jersey Jack Pimball is a really interesting company

[11:14] to me because people want full featured games.

[11:17] People want these games with deep code.

[11:20] Home owners want this stuff.

[11:22] And I think Jersey Jack Pimball trying to move this company

[11:26] to be more like Sterns so they can get two games out of year.

[11:30] I think it's a mistake.

[11:31] I think Jersey Jack Pimball needs to behave more like Rolex

[11:36] and less like Stern.

[11:39] I think they're chasing the wrong thing.

[11:41] I think they need to think about themselves more like Rolex.

[11:45] They are making luxury Pimball machines

[11:48] for the discerning collector,

[11:50] for the person who wants quality,

[11:52] for the person that wants more complexity,

[11:55] for the person that wants craftsmanship.

[11:57] I think that's the best word.

[11:59] For the ultimate Pimball craftsmanship game of the year,

[12:02] I think a Jersey Jack Pimball machine

[12:04] should be levels above everything else in the industry.

[12:08] If they go after Stern and they try to make their games

[12:11] easier to make, if they try to make their games less complex,

[12:15] if they try to remove some of the craftsmanship

[12:17] from their games and they try to become more like Stern

[12:21] and get more volume at a year by making their games

[12:24] easier to manufacture, I do think they're moving

[12:28] in the wrong direction.

[12:29] Now how many watches does Rolex make a year?

[12:31] Now you could say this is a ton of watches.

[12:33] Rolex makes over a million watches a year.

[12:36] So you could say, Chris, what are you talking about?

[12:38] Rolex is selling a high-end product at volume,

[12:41] but Rolex is not the number one watch manufacturer

[12:44] in the world.

[12:45] The number one watch manufacturer in the world

[12:47] is fossil and they make 50 million watches a year.

[12:51] So Rolex is 50 times smaller than the largest watch manufacturer

[12:56] in the world.

[12:57] Now if we were to look at Stern Pimball

[12:59] as the largest Pimball manufacturer in the world

[13:01] because they are, why would Jersey Jack

[13:04] want to continue to try to compete with volume?

[13:07] Especially as we see all of these Pimball prices

[13:10] going through the roof, it's so apparent

[13:13] that Jersey Jack Pimball should be embracing

[13:16] a position in the marketplace as a luxury Pimball manufacturer.

[13:21] I don't know why that's so hard for them to embrace.

[13:24] I've been saying it for a while,

[13:26] but I think with Steve Richie coming in

[13:29] and with his Stern expertise,

[13:31] they're going to try to take Jersey Jack Pimball

[13:34] in a Stern direction.

[13:35] And I think it's gonna fail and here's why

[13:37] because I think what's gonna happen is

[13:40] Jersey Jack Pimball is gonna start to remove

[13:43] more and more from their games.

[13:44] I do.

[13:45] You can see it now.

[13:46] Like if you lift the hood, and I mean this,

[13:48] lift the hood on Guns and Roses.

[13:51] It is much simpler than any other Jersey Jack machine

[13:55] that has ever been made.

[13:57] Just go lift the hood on one

[13:58] and put it next to their previous machines.

[14:00] You'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

[14:02] It's still a beautiful machine.

[14:04] It's still got beautiful artwork.

[14:06] It's still got a lot to do.

[14:07] They yanked out stuff like a subway system.

[14:10] They yanked out stuff like a big drop bank.

[14:12] Now when you see Guns and Roses,

[14:14] you know where the entrance to the scoop is?

[14:16] That used to be a big drop target.

[14:18] The three piano keys was one big target

[14:21] that you hit that dropped down.

[14:23] So for people complaining that you always get into the scoop,

[14:26] it wasn't designed that way.

[14:28] So they removed that and they removed the subway system.

[14:31] And I think Toy Story is really going to be a telltale sign

[14:36] on which direction Jersey Jack is going in.

[14:39] Is it gonna be packed?

[14:40] Is it gonna be loaded?

[14:41] Now my guess is this.

[14:43] I'm telling you right now.

[14:43] Is it just Canadian guessing?

[14:45] I think Pat Lawler has been driving some of this simplification.

[14:49] And you know, Pat Lawler's the reason why they made

[14:51] Willy Wonka standard.

[14:53] And when you look at Willy Wonka,

[14:54] it's another game that doesn't really have a ton in it

[14:58] compared to Jersey Jack's earlier offerings.

[15:00] Now unfortunately for Jersey Jack Pinball,

[15:03] even as they've simplified stuff, right?

[15:05] The quality hasn't gone up.

[15:07] And they must be super frustrated

[15:09] because they're taking stuff out of their games

[15:11] and the quality has sort of remained problematic

[15:14] even to this day.

[15:16] This is why I say Jersey Jack Pinball needs to call timeout

[15:19] and ask themselves, what kind of company do we want to be?

[15:23] If we sell at volume, we're gonna have a hard time

[15:26] keeping the quality high.

[15:28] And we've seen it.

[15:29] We've seen it with guns and roses.

[15:30] We've seen it with every single machine they've had.

[15:33] For some reason, when it comes to the quality,

[15:36] when they start manufacturing these machines,

[15:38] there's just too many issues.

[15:40] And every time you open up a Jersey Jack Pinball thread,

[15:44] everything I'm seeing in it is issue after, issue after,

[15:48] issue, you can't have it like that, right?

[15:50] Rolex would not be Rolex if people's watches kept breaking down.

[15:54] And so if they're gonna study Rolex and not stern,

[15:58] how do we make a product that is pretty bulletproof?

[16:01] And I think the way you get there, I do.

[16:03] I think the way you get there is you've got to relieve

[16:06] some of the pressure on yourself

[16:08] to get the quality where you need it to be,

[16:10] a luxury pinball machine.

[16:12] You need to have really highly skilled workers

[16:16] putting every single game together, right?

[16:20] That's first and foremost.

[16:21] And we know that has not been the case

[16:22] with Jersey Jack Pinball over the years.

[16:24] Back in Jersey, they were using temp workers,

[16:27] temp workers to make these expensive machines,

[16:30] temp workers are not gonna cut it.

[16:32] So if you wanna get people who become highly skilled

[16:35] at making pinball, you need to make them salary employees.

[16:40] And you need to train them

[16:41] and they need to become experts at this by doing it

[16:44] for tens of thousands of hours.

[16:46] But you also want them to remain loyal,

[16:48] you want people to stay there for years.

[16:50] So you're not gonna get the quality there with temp workers.

[16:53] Now it's hard to pay people salaries on the line

[16:56] if your line's not always running.

[16:58] It's also hard to pay people salaries

[17:00] if it takes a long time for development.

[17:03] I think it'd be almost impossible to pay salaried employees

[17:06] to be your line workers, especially in pinball

[17:09] when there's delays and when you're waiting around,

[17:12] unless you do one thing,

[17:14] unless you set a limit to how many games

[17:16] you're going to make a year.

[17:18] And you price your games accordingly

[17:21] and you limit the supply of your luxury pinball machine

[17:24] so that you can make each game a year

[17:28] with your highly skilled workforce.

[17:30] And you will charge accordingly

[17:32] because your product will be levels above anything else

[17:36] in the marketplace.

[17:37] I'm talking about high end luxury pinball.

[17:41] When you stand over a Guns and Roses machine,

[17:44] when you look at that machine

[17:46] and when you see that machine all lit up

[17:48] and when you see how beautiful it is

[17:50] and you look at a Guns and Roses

[17:52] and it's the same price basically as a stern.

[17:56] It's not sterns fault.

[17:57] Stern is super smart.

[17:59] Why is Jersey Jack trying to sell these machines at volume?

[18:03] Why are they trying to sell 5,000 guns and roses machines?

[18:08] If we take where Rolex is

[18:10] compared to the number one watchmaker,

[18:12] they make 50 times less machines.

[18:15] Let's say Stern makes 20,000 pinball machines

[18:17] a year in a good year.

[18:19] Jersey Jack, if you want to be the luxury pinball maker

[18:22] in the world, how many games is that a year?

[18:25] Is it 5,000?

[18:26] I still think that's too many.

[18:28] That's only four times less than the number one.

[18:30] I think Jersey Jack pinball should only make 1,500 games a year.

[18:37] That's it. That's all we're making.

[18:40] And I think Jersey Jack should cap how many of each title

[18:44] they're gonna make from the very beginning

[18:46] and I think they should take this company

[18:48] into a more high end place.

[18:51] And I would, if I were them, say we're gonna make

[18:54] 500 collectors editions

[18:57] and 1,000 LEDs a year of this title and that's it.

[19:02] And that's it.

[19:03] That's all you're making of guns and roses.

[19:05] And if you wanna make 3,000 a year, right?

[19:08] And let's just play Devils Advocate

[19:09] like we wanna make more games.

[19:10] Okay, but then the other 1,500 is another title.

[19:14] It's not just the same game.

[19:16] You can't survive like this.

[19:18] So make 1,500 guns and roses

[19:20] and make 1,500 toy stories

[19:23] for a total of 3,000 games a year.

[19:25] But that's it.

[19:26] Don't keep trying to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.

[19:29] They clearly can't do it.

[19:31] They can't turn on a second line.

[19:32] How long have they been in Chicago?

[19:34] There's still no second line.

[19:36] And I think Jersey Jack Pimball continues

[19:38] to want to be Stern Pimball.

[19:41] And I think they bought a space that makes them capable

[19:44] of being big like Stern Pimball.

[19:46] It's like they have dreams of being big by volume.

[19:49] And I really think Jersey Jack Pimball

[19:51] should rethink this whole thing.

[19:53] Because the real thing is this.

[19:55] Jersey Jack Pimball leaves money on the table

[19:58] every single release.

[20:00] They could easily charge way more per machine.

[20:04] If they simply capped how many of those machines

[20:07] they would make in total.

[20:08] What if they said we're only gonna make 3,000 of each game ever?

[20:13] Ever.

[20:15] Yes, they might be able to make more money

[20:18] if they increase the volume and sell 6,000 guns and roses.

[20:22] But at what price are they paying for that?

[20:25] I'll tell you what price they're paying.

[20:27] Now they can't make another game.

[20:29] Is it worth it?

[20:30] That's my whole question for Jersey Jack Pimball.

[20:32] Is it worth it to go to scale and to try to get more volume?

[20:36] Why does Jersey Jack want to be a volume player

[20:40] in the Pimball space?

[20:41] We know the Abba's family doesn't really need the money.

[20:44] It's like they're chasing Stern.

[20:47] And I really don't think they should be chasing Stern.

[20:49] It's like they're chasing that.

[20:50] You know, they want to be competition for Stern.

[20:52] And I would just go in the other direction.

[20:55] I would just say if our goal is to be the most high end

[20:59] premium luxury Pimball, that's not for everybody.

[21:03] Stern is making Pimball for everybody.

[21:06] Stern has three to four to five titles a year.

[21:10] They are going to embarrass you with volume always.

[21:13] Always.

[21:14] What's really sad is that Stern is embarrassing JJP

[21:18] when it comes to quality.

[21:20] They're embarrassing JJP when it comes to number of titles.

[21:23] They're embarrassing JJP when it comes to customer service.

[21:27] Bomb Jersey Jack, I'm like, we need to hit pause

[21:30] and we need to rethink this entire thing.

[21:33] And I say this because I don't even know

[21:35] when they're going to show toy story.

[21:37] How many years will it take to get to Eric's next game?

[21:39] Now here's the really unpopular thing I'm about to say.

[21:42] Chris, so if you're only going to make 1,500 games a year,

[21:45] what are you going to charge for those machines?

[21:48] Are you ready?

[21:48] This is assuming that you get the quality

[21:51] where it needs to be.

[21:52] You kick Mirko to the curb.

[21:54] You've got the best play fields in Pimball.

[21:56] You have the most amazing mechanisms and worlds

[21:59] under glass and code in your game.

[22:01] And you give people just like the most high-end

[22:04] luxury Pimball experience.

[22:06] Are you ready for it?

[22:07] I think you only have two prices.

[22:09] And it's that simple.

[22:10] And it Jersey Jack, Ellie, is 15 grand.

[22:13] And it Jersey Jack, collector's edition is 20 grand.

[22:16] And that's it.

[22:17] That's it.

[22:18] And it's not for everybody.

[22:20] And if you want one, that's what it costs.

[22:22] And if you look at where the market is now.

[22:25] There's a reason why pirates of the Caribbean

[22:27] can now sell every day for $20 to $30,000.

[22:31] Why is that?

[22:32] Because they made 1,200 of them.

[22:34] That's why.

[22:35] And those prices are not going to go down.

[22:37] Those prices are not going to sink.

[22:38] And how they're not looking at that and saying,

[22:40] well, wait a minute.

[22:41] If we only made 250 guns and roses collectors editions,

[22:46] we could have sold each of them for $20,000.

[22:49] That's $8,000 more profit per machine than we got.

[22:53] And then we could have moved on to our next title.

[22:56] And let's say Jersey Jack Pimball only

[22:58] makes 1,500 of each game.

[23:01] It's one game a year.

[23:02] And this company has two designers.

[23:05] And they know that every other year, their big title will

[23:09] hit and without delay.

[23:11] And then you're giving these people enough time

[23:14] to design the magic into the games, to focus on the game.

[23:19] You give Keith enough time to focus on the code.

[23:21] And everybody over there can focus on making

[23:23] it the greatest thing ever.

[23:25] But with this new price increase too,

[23:27] you can go further.

[23:29] You can push it more.

[23:30] You can put more into the machines.

[23:32] You can make these things so spectacular.

[23:34] It's not even funny.

[23:36] No one's going to have to hear their word no

[23:37] that can't go in there.

[23:39] The only limit will be someone's imagination,

[23:42] not the material costs.

[23:44] But they're not going in this direction.

[23:45] This is just a dream of mine.

[23:46] I know you're saying Chris, it's crazy

[23:48] that you're even suggesting this.

[23:49] And here's why I'm suggesting this.

[23:51] Because we're going to end up paying $15,000 to $20,000

[23:54] anyway for these machines.

[23:56] And they're not going to have that much stuff in them.

[23:59] I would rather them load these games up from the factory.

[24:02] And I would rather own $120,000 machine

[24:07] than by two $10,000 machines that are stripped down.

[24:12] And that is where we are headed in Pimbal.

[24:13] People do not think that you are going to get

[24:16] loaded, loaded pins for $10,000.

[24:19] You're not.

[24:19] Look at Halloween and look at Ultraman.

[24:21] Very cool pins.

[24:22] But a loaded spooky machine, I don't mean load it

[24:25] like it's loaded with stuff.

[24:27] I just mean like if you option out a spooky machine,

[24:30] it's now $10,000.

[24:32] Big Lebowski is $12,500.

[24:35] That is loaded and I bet you Dutch Pimbal

[24:37] is kicking themselves right now because that's not enough money

[24:41] for how much they're putting into their games right now.

[24:43] But Sternelli is going to be over $10,000

[24:47] without a topper with an additional fee for internet.

[24:51] You're going to start spending $10,000 to $12,000

[24:55] to have a fully optioned out Sternelli.

[24:58] And you think they raise their bond by $4,000?

[25:01] Absolutely not.

[25:02] Now the sad thing is, even as I talk about this,

[25:05] I talk about Jersey Jack becoming more Rolex.

[25:09] Jersey Jack making their games purposely limited

[25:12] to make it easier on their staff and their manufacturing

[25:15] and on everybody.

[25:16] And also to make it more highly collectible in the future,

[25:19] it's unfortunate because all of this is taking Pimbal

[25:23] in a direction of being a collectible

[25:26] and not a toy to just bang on and enjoy.

[25:30] I would say if I'm Jersey Jack,

[25:31] let everybody else make the Pimbal

[25:34] that you're supposed to just bang on and enjoy

[25:36] and not care about collecting it.

[25:38] That's fine, but we're going to make the ones

[25:40] that people want to collect.

[25:42] We're going to make the ones that are the luxury high end items.

[25:45] The funny thing is this is they could have captured

[25:48] that market, they could have captured

[25:49] the high end luxury Pimbal market and they did and Sterne did.

[25:53] They let Sterne walk in and see the potential.

[25:57] They let Sterne walk in and see how much money

[26:00] these buyers really had.

[26:01] And here's the sad unfortunate truth.

[26:03] If you have $9,000 to spend on a Pimbal machine,

[26:08] Sterne knows that you have $15,000.

[26:11] They know that you have $20,000.

[26:15] It is such an unnecessary item

[26:18] that if you have that much to burn on it,

[26:21] they know that you're not going to be in dire straits

[26:24] if you buy one Pimbal machine a year.

[26:26] They know that you're the kind of person

[26:28] who could buy two.

[26:30] They don't care.

[26:31] They don't care because if they see the average Pimbal buyer

[26:34] buys more than one Pimbal machine a year,

[26:36] if they have that fact, especially the early guys,

[26:39] again, I'm talking about the high end collector market.

[26:41] If they see the average early buyer

[26:43] buys more than one Pimbal machine a year

[26:46] and the average early price is over $10,000.

[26:50] And they say, hey, why don't we just sell?

[26:52] Why don't we try and see if we can get them

[26:54] to buy each one for $20,000 and see if that works.

[26:57] Unfortunately, I would be right.

[26:59] They could easily SLE machines right now

[27:02] in charge 20 to $25,000 per machine

[27:06] and they would sell out on day one.

[27:08] I know this is annoying to hear,

[27:10] but if they said we're making SLE's of Godzilla only 50

[27:13] for 20 grand, sold out, immediately sold out.

[27:16] Because all the rich guys, the easiest way to get rich people

[27:19] to part with their money is to tell them

[27:21] they can't have something.

[27:22] It's an unbelievable psychological thing

[27:25] that marketers use.

[27:27] You simply tell them, sorry, there might not be enough

[27:30] for you and watch them show you how powerful

[27:34] they think they are and flex with their capital.

[27:36] So here we are.

[27:38] Here we are at the Crossroads of Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[27:41] I think Steve Richie is gonna head them in a direction

[27:43] to be more like Stern.

[27:45] I think they're gonna chase volume

[27:47] and I think that's gonna make manufacturing

[27:49] a nightmare for them.

[27:51] I think they're gonna yank more out of the games

[27:53] and I think they're doing it wrong.

[27:55] I think they should go lower volume, higher price,

[27:59] better quality, become the Rolex of Pimbal Jjp.

[28:04] I don't know why people are afraid to embrace the fact

[28:08] that there can be a company that tailors their Pimbal

[28:12] to the high end buyer.

[28:13] If any company could do this and pivot and move in that direction

[28:17] and needs to move in that direction,

[28:19] I believe it's Jersey Jack Pimbal.

[28:21] Now that being said, can't wait to get my Godzilla,

[28:24] I'll leave this week.

[28:25] Woohoo!

[28:26] It would be stupid of me not to get one.

[28:27] It is basically like saying,

[28:29] hey, I'm gonna take $10,000

[28:31] and I'm gonna have something that'll always be worth that

[28:35] and most likely be worth 50% more

[28:37] or I'll just give up my spot

[28:39] and let someone else have it.

[28:40] Nope, I'm getting one.

[28:42] Everybody, have a good day.

[28:43] I'll talk to you soon.

[28:44] Hey, we're in a material world.

[28:47] We're in a material world.

[28:48] We're in a material world.

[28:51] Hey, we're in a material world.

[28:54] We're in a material world.
