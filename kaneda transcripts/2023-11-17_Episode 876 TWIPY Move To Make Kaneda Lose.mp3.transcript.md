[00:00] And I said, welcome to New York.

[00:03] It's been waiting for you. Welcome to New York.

[00:06] Welcome to New York.

[00:08] Welcome to New York.

[00:11] It's been waiting for you. Welcome to New York.

[00:14] Welcome to New York.

[00:16] Sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

[00:19] Aw, welcome everybody. Happy Friday.

[00:22] Welcome to New York, Canada's Pinball Podcast.

[00:25] They're doing construction across the street.

[00:27] So if you hear some banging and you hear some honking,

[00:29] and this is just New York City on a Friday morning,

[00:31] here's what we're gonna do.

[00:32] We're gonna talk all about what's going on

[00:34] in the pinball industry.

[00:35] We're gonna go around the horn.

[00:36] We're just gonna go through every manufacturer.

[00:38] It's a fun Friday.

[00:39] Let's just go around the horn and talk about

[00:41] what's happening at each manufacturer,

[00:43] what we think is gonna come from each of these manufacturers.

[00:46] Next, you know, and we're closing in on the end of the year.

[00:49] Pretty soon, Twippy eligibility will be over

[00:52] if your game does not ship by the end of November.

[00:55] It's December 1st to December 1st.

[00:57] And we will talk a little bit about a Twippy criteria

[01:01] that they tried to put in place

[01:02] that would have eliminated

[01:04] Canada's Pinball Podcast from the running.

[01:06] Let's just start there.

[01:07] This is the most hysterical item I've ever heard.

[01:09] So Colin, you know, our friend Colin over at the Kinetis

[01:12] is he brought this to the Twippy committee.

[01:14] He wanted there to be a positivity criteria

[01:18] that content creators had to reach

[01:20] if they were to be eligible for the Twippies.

[01:22] Let me repeat that.

[01:23] If your content was deemed by him to not be positive,

[01:28] then you would be ineligible for a Twippy.

[01:31] Who do you think he was trying to eliminate?

[01:32] The guy who's won six years in a row

[01:34] for favorite pinball podcast.

[01:36] What a sad proposal, but I'm happy to report

[01:39] that when he brought it to the Twippy committee,

[01:41] they immediately shot it down.

[01:43] So I'm happy that the Twippy committee

[01:45] is not gonna be persuaded by censorship.

[01:47] I mean, think about a world in which the media

[01:49] are not allowed to say something negative about something.

[01:53] Really, how are you supposed to critique stuff objectively

[01:56] if you can't say this game sucks or this theme sucks?

[01:58] Is that spreading negativity?

[02:00] So let's just cheerlead everything

[02:02] and see how boring the world becomes, people.

[02:04] You only get better products.

[02:06] You only get better things in yourself.

[02:08] You only get better things at work

[02:10] if you're unhappy with the way things are currently going.

[02:13] That's how life works.

[02:15] Unhappy men and women, they change the world for the better.

[02:19] And I would like to believe, when I go to bed at night,

[02:21] that Canadian Pinball Podcast has been

[02:23] a positive impact on pinball.

[02:25] It has not been a negative impact on pinball.

[02:28] All right, so get your Twippy votes ready, people.

[02:30] We need five free shows to be eligible

[02:33] by the end of this month,

[02:34] and I'm gonna do something funny

[02:36] on this weekend Saturday morning spectacular.

[02:38] All right, so let's talk about these pinball companies, right?

[02:41] So let's start with Stern Pinball.

[02:42] Now look, I'm looking at this Elvira Blood Red Kiss Edition,

[02:46] whatever it's called.

[02:47] I saw the unboxing by straight down the middle.

[02:49] There's like a two minute video,

[02:51] and I'm just gonna say this right now.

[02:52] This is one of the most beautiful pinball machines

[02:55] I have ever seen.

[02:56] It is gorgeous.

[02:57] There is like nothing about this machine I would change,

[03:00] and it actually makes me want to buy one.

[03:03] It's just so beautiful.

[03:05] And it goes to show if Stern makes a little bit more

[03:07] of an effort, what they can do with the game.

[03:10] I think this Elvira for $13,000.

[03:13] If I were in the market for something right now

[03:15] and I wanted to spend this much money,

[03:17] this would be the game I would get.

[03:19] I also think the bottom line is this.

[03:21] There's only gonna be 500 of this version of Elvira,

[03:25] and it is by far the nicest version of the game.

[03:28] And I'm just gonna say this.

[03:30] I think this game is gonna hold value.

[03:32] I don't think this is gonna be one of those $13,000 games

[03:35] that immediately becomes worth $10,000 in a few weeks.

[03:38] There's a few reasons why.

[03:39] This game is filled with toys,

[03:41] unlike most Stern machines.

[03:43] This game also features Lyman Sheets,

[03:45] and it's also Lyman Sheets' last game he ever did,

[03:48] and he's the best coder in the history of pinball.

[03:51] And because of that, this game is always gonna hold value.

[03:54] It also has all the assets you want in a pinball machine.

[03:57] They got Elvira, they've got the movie clips,

[03:59] and Lyman Sheets was such a master

[04:01] in arranging all this kind of content on an LCD screen.

[04:05] And then you've got just the beauty

[04:07] of the damn machine itself.

[04:08] I mean, look at this thing.

[04:09] It's pure sex on a box, in a box.

[04:12] Everything happening with this game just screams like,

[04:14] oh my gosh, if you put this game in your lineup,

[04:17] it is gonna stand out more than almost

[04:19] any other Stern machine ever,

[04:21] and then I don't think people are gonna sell it very often

[04:23] because of that.

[04:24] You know, I think it's much nicer than Jurassic Park 30.

[04:27] If that version of the game,

[04:28] even though it's nicer than the older Ellie of Jurassic Park,

[04:31] it's still not nearly as nice as this Elvira machine.

[04:35] And I know there's debate on which game is better.

[04:37] I think it's just different strokes for different folks.

[04:40] For $13,000 though, I will say this.

[04:42] I mean, this game should come with the topper.

[04:44] You know, and the other thing is this.

[04:45] I wish Stern would say this is it.

[04:47] Like this is the final version of Elvira.

[04:50] I don't wanna send a message to Stern

[04:52] that they can just keep doing this on every single theme.

[04:55] Like just add more sparkle, change the color palette,

[04:58] and we're just gonna line up to buy them at $13,000.

[05:02] But man, this game is seductive.

[05:04] It is very seductive, so a beautiful game.

[05:06] And now after this, right,

[05:08] it's like what's next over at Stern?

[05:10] We're waiting for these Stranger Things premiums.

[05:12] We expect that game to be on the line sometime

[05:15] in like December, January.

[05:17] And then it's all about Keith Elwyn Jaws

[05:19] and how will Jaws be received by the pinball world.

[05:22] Now look, following this Elvira, which is so beautiful,

[05:25] if the rumors are true that Jaws pinball's art package

[05:28] is pretty terrible, it will be interesting to see

[05:31] if people line up for the LE knowing

[05:33] that there's a thousand of them.

[05:35] And that's the other thing too,

[05:36] is I think everybody wants to go back

[05:38] to just having 500 LEs.

[05:40] I'd rather have 500 LEs of any game in the world.

[05:43] And that's it.

[05:44] You know, and I don't even mind it

[05:45] if they make 500 of this version

[05:47] and 500 of that version as long as they are different.

[05:50] When you make 1,000 units of the same exact looking game,

[05:55] it's just not limited.

[05:56] It's just never going to be limited.

[05:59] If you're gonna make 1,000 Jaws LEs,

[06:01] maybe make like 500 featuring the shark on the cabinet

[06:05] and then maybe 500 featuring the boat

[06:07] or something else on the cabinet,

[06:09] but just break it up a little bit

[06:11] and then you have two versions.

[06:12] And then anyone who owns one version

[06:14] at least can sleep well at night

[06:16] knowing that they have one of 500.

[06:18] I just don't like one of a thousand being on any LE plaque.

[06:22] I think it means nothing.

[06:23] And by the way, you're probably hearing

[06:25] New York City behind me.

[06:26] It is ridiculous.

[06:27] They are putting up some scaffolding.

[06:29] They made a street that's already crowded,

[06:31] one lane now because of this damn construction.

[06:34] So I apologize if there's a lot of background noise.

[06:36] I hear some dude just blasting his music.

[06:39] That's normally me and the demon blasting ACDC

[06:41] and guns and roses.

[06:42] And then after Jaws had stern pinball,

[06:44] the rumor titles, just to remind everybody,

[06:47] are going to be Dungeons and Dragons.

[06:49] I don't know who's buying that game, John Wick.

[06:52] And then there is the rumor of Pokemon.

[06:54] So those are the three strongest rumors of games

[06:57] that might be coming out next year.

[06:59] If that sterns line up next year after Jaws,

[07:02] it's really not that strong people.

[07:04] I get it, Pokemon is huge,

[07:06] but I'm just not sure it's going to cross over

[07:08] with the pinball buying demographic.

[07:11] All right, then let's get to Spooky Pinball.

[07:13] They are busy making Scooby-Doo's.

[07:15] They put up a picture yesterday, which is awesome.

[07:18] It is the Mystery Machine Cabinet.

[07:19] Now we haven't seen this before,

[07:21] and I'm actually really digging it.

[07:23] It is really neat.

[07:24] And I think that's the cabinet you get

[07:26] if you order the standard version of the game.

[07:29] You know, I was thinking about this too,

[07:31] because Spooky Pinball is another company

[07:33] where none of the games are really limited,

[07:35] and they'll make as many collector's editions

[07:37] as people order, and then the majority

[07:39] of people order the collector's editions.

[07:41] So then ironically, the base version of the game

[07:44] actually becomes the rarest version of the game.

[07:48] I don't think it should be that way.

[07:49] I mean, think about it.

[07:50] It'd be like getting on an airplane,

[07:51] and the majority of the seats are first class seats,

[07:54] and then the most exclusive seats

[07:56] are at the back of the plane.

[07:57] It doesn't really make much sense.

[07:59] And so like, I think anyone who gets

[08:00] this Mystery Machine Cabinet version of the game

[08:03] is at least going to have something different

[08:04] than everybody else, and it just looks phenomenal.

[08:07] Now look, after this, the real question

[08:09] is what's next from Spooky?

[08:11] We've been getting some clues.

[08:12] There are three rumor titles that everyone is expecting,

[08:15] and it is Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[08:17] it is Evil Dead, and it is Looney Tunes.

[08:19] Like, which one doesn't fit, right?

[08:21] Looney Tunes.

[08:22] So we will see what happens.

[08:24] I'm still hearing that the next game

[08:25] is gonna be a single design where two themes

[08:28] will share the same design like they did

[08:30] with Ultraman and with Halloween.

[08:32] I'm not a fan of that.

[08:33] The reason I'm not a fan of that is it indicates

[08:35] that you did not design one of those games

[08:37] from the ground up with the theme in mind.

[08:40] I don't like it, I don't think they should keep doing this.

[08:42] I think they need to hire another designer.

[08:44] I think they need to get a little bit more

[08:46] mechanical magic into these spooky games.

[08:49] And now with Barrels of Fun in the world,

[08:50] which is basically made up of like ex-spooky people,

[08:53] they're gonna start to feel the competition,

[08:55] and they're not gonna be able to get

[08:56] 2,000 non-refundable deposits anymore.

[08:59] They're really gonna have to work hard

[09:00] for their sales moving forward,

[09:02] which is a good thing because it's gonna

[09:04] make them get better.

[09:05] All right, let's go on to Barrels of Fun

[09:07] because I just mentioned them.

[09:08] I think everyone who ordered a Labyrinth

[09:10] is patiently waiting.

[09:11] They have 500 or so games that have been ordered,

[09:14] maybe more by now.

[09:15] They brought the game to Houston Expo,

[09:17] so that will sell them more games.

[09:19] And now it becomes how many can they make, right?

[09:21] That's really the next step for this company

[09:23] because we're all excited.

[09:25] We're all excited by the rumors

[09:27] that they might have the fifth element.

[09:29] They might have Goonies, they might have Gremlins.

[09:32] You know, everyone's excited.

[09:33] They might have Beetlejuice.

[09:34] So this company's future is looking pretty good.

[09:37] What I hope we see from Barrels of Fun,

[09:39] the more I look at Labyrinth,

[09:40] I'm still not really seeing a lot

[09:42] of mechanical engineering in the game.

[09:45] And I wanna see more mechanical stuff.

[09:47] Basically, I wanna see more toys in the game.

[09:50] And the thing about Labyrinth,

[09:51] if you like the movie,

[09:52] I get why you're gonna like this pinball machine,

[09:55] but it's not pretty.

[09:56] It's just not pretty to me.

[09:57] Like these ugly ogres all over the game,

[10:00] the brown color palette.

[10:02] Like put this game next to Elvira and look people,

[10:05] if you load up this game with the topper

[10:07] and all the options, you're getting close to $13,000.

[10:11] To me, like I would have a hard time buying this game

[10:14] over Elvira, Blood Kiss Edition.

[10:16] But I'm glad these guys are here.

[10:18] It is exciting because they did it right.

[10:20] They did not reveal until games were on the line.

[10:24] They figured manufacturing out.

[10:26] They took no money from people

[10:28] before they got their business up and running.

[10:30] And that's how you do it.

[10:32] Now it's just gonna be,

[10:33] can they build these games consistently

[10:36] and get games out the door every single week?

[10:39] We shall see.

[10:40] Let's go on the Jersey Jack pinball.

[10:41] So here's the thing.

[10:42] I think unanimously,

[10:44] everyone's feedback is that Elton John

[10:46] is the best shooting Jersey Jack game ever.

[10:49] It is probably the most fun Jersey Jack game

[10:51] to shoot of all time.

[10:53] And this is where the dilemma lies.

[10:56] Is I bet most of us really would love

[10:59] to give Elton John a shot.

[11:00] We would love to put this game in our lineup

[11:03] if the price was right.

[11:05] And that's the thing about this game

[11:07] is they finally made a game that plays like a stern machine.

[11:10] They finally did it.

[11:12] It's not surprising because Steve Ritchie

[11:14] just brought over the same exact designs

[11:16] he's been putting on every stern machine

[11:18] into Jersey Jack format.

[11:19] But it's like stern pinball and Jersey Jack had a baby.

[11:22] I mean, that's what Elton John is.

[11:24] But it's just not a game that feels very enticing

[11:27] at $15,000.

[11:30] Like when you look at the CEO of the game,

[11:32] it just does not look like a $15,000 machine.

[11:36] And the Ellie is so much more beautiful.

[11:38] It's not even funny.

[11:39] And then you have that dilemma.

[11:41] Like do I buy a $12,000 Elton John machine

[11:45] in which we know the demand is not strong

[11:48] for the Ellie of the game, especially at 12K.

[11:51] And then we all have seen what happened

[11:53] to Godfather Ellie's and Toy Story Ellie's.

[11:55] Within a few months,

[11:56] they're gonna be trading for $10,000 or less.

[12:00] And so, you know, do you wanna take the early hit

[12:03] or do you just wait and wait for these distributors

[12:05] to take the product,

[12:07] not be able to find anyone to buy it at $12,000

[12:10] and then get a huge discount?

[12:12] And we're gonna see that.

[12:13] We are absolutely gonna see it

[12:15] because Elton John is not a take my money now theme

[12:18] for people.

[12:19] I also think the weakest part of this game

[12:21] is the code itself.

[12:22] When you look at the gameplay

[12:23] and it's that screensaver of just images of Elton,

[12:26] it's not really captivating.

[12:28] I don't think they did it right.

[12:29] You know, there's just something about this game

[12:31] that feels off to me.

[12:32] The shots are there.

[12:33] There's not a lot of toys,

[12:34] but man, just watching the game being played

[12:37] is not that enticing.

[12:38] I'm gonna apologize for the noise again

[12:40] because I can hear it,

[12:41] so I'm sure you can hear it again.

[12:42] I don't know what's going on out there,

[12:44] but it's New York City.

[12:44] So welcome to Canada, live from New York.

[12:47] All right, so that's Jersey Jack.

[12:48] And then we know that Matrix and Harry Potter

[12:50] are around the corner.

[12:51] And that's another reason why it's like,

[12:53] why jump in on a theme

[12:55] when you know there's much bigger themes coming.

[12:58] I don't think Jersey Jack's ever gonna lower the price.

[13:00] I think they're just trying to buy their time

[13:02] until they get to those bigger themes.

[13:04] All right, let's go on to Chicago Gaming Company.

[13:06] Chicago Gaming Company, where are the Pulp Fictions?

[13:10] You know, the Pulp Fiction game is not gonna be eligible

[13:13] for the Twippies this year

[13:14] because none will have shipped by the end of November.

[13:16] So I don't know if they're gonna try

[13:17] to get just one out the door to be eligible,

[13:20] but they're probably not gonna make the Twippy cut.

[13:23] You know, there's just something frustrating

[13:25] about this company, everyone feels it.

[13:27] There's nothing we can do.

[13:28] Complaining about it won't change any of it.

[13:30] They're gonna make a high quality product.

[13:33] They're gonna do it.

[13:34] Like this game will eventually make its way

[13:36] into people's game rooms,

[13:37] but man, it's probably gonna be another game

[13:40] where you wait a year longer than you thought.

[13:43] And because of that, I don't really feel like

[13:45] there's any momentum about what's next

[13:47] at CGC after Pulp Fiction.

[13:49] I don't feel like the Mark Richie game,

[13:51] which was rumored to be Gremlins.

[13:53] I don't feel like that is ever gonna happen.

[13:55] I thought these guys might remake Kingpin

[13:57] or help that project move to fruition.

[13:59] I don't think that's gonna happen.

[14:01] I don't think Rick over at Planetary

[14:03] is gonna give them another old game to remake.

[14:06] It just feels like CGC is in this weird place.

[14:10] So we shall see what happens,

[14:11] but once again, Chicago Gaming Company

[14:14] is more like Chicago Delaying Company.

[14:16] And they do nothing when it comes to like talking to us,

[14:19] right?

[14:20] There's no communication from Ryan White

[14:21] or anybody over there on a monthly basis

[14:24] about the status of that company.

[14:26] It's really strange.

[14:27] All right, so after CGC, we got American Pinball.

[14:30] David Ficks has now said that their goal

[14:32] was to make 300 galactic tank forces by the end of the year.

[14:36] The only problem is there are not 300 people

[14:39] who wanna own a galactic tank force on planet Earth.

[14:43] Just think about how sad that is for a moment.

[14:45] You've got this rich guy in Mukesh

[14:47] who's basically given you the ability

[14:49] to make a pinball machine.

[14:51] You've got Ametron backing you.

[14:53] And then you need to pick a game

[14:54] where you need to excite the thousands potential

[14:57] pinball buyers around the world.

[14:59] And you land on a theme that can successfully excite

[15:03] more than 300 people on a planet of around 9 billion people,

[15:09] about which maybe 10,000 people

[15:12] are pinball buyers and collectors.

[15:14] So out of 10,000 people, you can excite 300.

[15:18] The game is a failure, people.

[15:20] American Pinball is a failure, people.

[15:23] They need to change the team over there.

[15:25] David Ficks is not the right man for the job.

[15:28] And this is not a personal attack.

[15:31] He's had the helm over there now for how long?

[15:33] And he just doesn't have the answers.

[15:36] And if Cuphead is next by Ryan McQuade,

[15:38] just stick a fork in these guys.

[15:40] Nobody wants Cuphead other than Ryan McQuade.

[15:43] So I really hope that rumor is false.

[15:46] There's only one answer for this company.

[15:48] If they have He-Man, they need to make it next.

[15:53] And they need to load it with toys.

[15:55] It needs to have Castle Grayskull.

[15:57] You need to have this amazing moment

[15:58] when Adam raises his sword and turns into He-Man.

[16:01] If they have this property,

[16:03] why is this game not on the line?

[16:06] Nobody wants Dennis Norman's failed tank experiment.

[16:10] Nobody.

[16:10] All right, well, that's American Pinball.

[16:12] I'm just gonna say this.

[16:13] I think this company is in jeopardy of closing its doors.

[16:17] And I think Mukesh is gonna get tired

[16:19] of not making any money with the Pinball division.

[16:21] All right, after American Pinball,

[16:22] we got P3 Multimorphic.

[16:25] Jerry's not making any new games this year

[16:27] until they solve the problems with the old games.

[16:30] And look, there's nothing really new to talk about here.

[16:33] Not many people own this platform.

[16:35] If I talked a lot about Multimorphic P3,

[16:38] I wouldn't have 655 subscribers.

[16:41] So look, if you own one, great.

[16:43] Here's the thing that makes me sad.

[16:44] I do think Multimorphic has one

[16:47] of the greatest engineering departments in modern Pinball.

[16:50] They actually make these incredible mechanisms

[16:53] that nobody else is even coming close to.

[16:55] Like the crane in Heist is unreal.

[16:58] The mechs in Weird Owl are super cool.

[17:00] The only problem is, right, if you're a mechanical engineer,

[17:03] you have to work around the fact

[17:04] that there's a damn TV screen taking up the play field

[17:07] and you can't even put mechanisms on 75% of the play field.

[17:11] I just don't get it.

[17:12] I wanna challenge Jerry to do something.

[17:15] You know what, look, Jerry, keep making

[17:16] your Multimorphic P3s,

[17:18] but then have your engineers just make

[17:19] a normal Pinball machine.

[17:21] Just try it for once, Jerry, trust me.

[17:23] Try it for once, give them the entire piece of wood

[17:27] to fill up with amazing mechs, get a licensed theme,

[17:30] and watch that normal Pinball machine

[17:33] outsell your dream platform 10 to one.

[17:36] It would happen.

[17:37] It would absolutely happen.

[17:38] It's like he doesn't even wanna try it.

[17:40] He's just so all in on this platform

[17:43] and it's just never gonna catch on.

[17:45] And it's so much more difficult

[17:47] to have to fill up that screen

[17:48] because if you get a licensed theme,

[17:50] like look at Weird Owl,

[17:51] like you're not gonna be able to code

[17:53] and put stuff on that screen.

[17:55] And then the other screen,

[17:56] it's a nightmare for the software people.

[17:58] All right, the Pinball brothers,

[17:59] the rumor is that their next game

[18:01] is gonna be another music pin after Queen.

[18:05] I don't think a lot of people bought Queen or own Queen.

[18:08] Queen was kind of dead on arrival.

[18:10] It just felt like an old game

[18:11] that came out in a new time.

[18:13] We got the Ripley version of Alien,

[18:15] which was nice that they put that into the game.

[18:18] You know, but I'm just still waiting

[18:19] for the Pinball brothers to make a move.

[18:22] That is not a move that was started by Andrew Highway.

[18:25] That's what I wanna see if these guys really have it.

[18:28] Like, do they have a good designer?

[18:30] Are they gonna be able to bring a licensed theme out

[18:32] that people really, really want after Alien?

[18:35] And I think we don't want another music pin.

[18:37] I don't want any more music pins.

[18:39] I'm just so sick of music pins.

[18:41] So that's the Pinball brothers.

[18:43] Dutch Pinball, they're making these big Lebowski still.

[18:45] They're gonna make them for the rest of all of 2024.

[18:49] If we're lucky, we might get back to the future

[18:52] at the end of next year.

[18:54] All we can do is hope we're gonna get it.

[18:56] There's a rumor there might be something

[18:57] before back to the future, but we'll see if that happens.

[19:00] But I'm just happy these Lebowski's are being made.

[19:02] The machines are gorgeous.

[19:04] Every time I see a Lebowski in a game room,

[19:06] it still holds up after all these years,

[19:09] after 10 freaking years, this game is still more impressive

[19:13] than most modern games that cost a lot more money.

[19:15] It's like one of those games where it looks like

[19:17] it's worth the 13.5.

[19:19] I think that's the price for a machine.

[19:20] You know what I'm saying?

[19:21] Like you stand over Lebowski, you see the assets,

[19:23] you see the mechs, you see the artwork, everything in it.

[19:26] You feel like you're getting your money's worth.

[19:28] And that's all we want from all these other manufacturers.

[19:30] All right, home pin, there's shipping, spinal tap.

[19:33] Nobody cares.

[19:34] I'm not even gonna talk about home pin.

[19:36] Oh, the noise.

[19:37] All right, let's talk about Haggis.

[19:38] Pinball, so Haggis, it looks like they're gonna

[19:40] finish the fathoms.

[19:41] People are still unboxing them.

[19:43] So it looks like Damien might achieve his goal

[19:46] to move on to Centaur.

[19:47] The thing is this, I just don't think

[19:49] they're gonna sell many Centaur's.

[19:50] They're not gonna sell as many of those as they did Fathom.

[19:54] And look, the thing is this, are we ever gonna get

[19:56] to Marty Robbins' like original designed game?

[19:59] The game, by the way, if you don't know,

[20:01] is War of the Worlds, which is an open IP.

[20:05] It's probably gonna be based

[20:06] on the Orson Welles radio address.

[20:08] That's what I would do.

[20:10] But that is the game that Marty Robbins has designed.

[20:12] And remember, if you go back and listen

[20:14] to the Haggis interviews like three years ago,

[20:17] Marty's War of the Worlds was supposed to be out

[20:19] like two years ago.

[20:21] Yes, they could keep making these remakes

[20:23] and making them beautiful and add all these crazy toppers

[20:26] and lighting and all this stuff and under cabinet lighting

[20:29] that lights up your bathroom toilet.

[20:31] But I would rather these guys show us

[20:33] what can they do with a theme that they designed.

[20:36] I'm just bored with remakes and I'm bored with remakes

[20:39] from an era like this.

[20:40] I just don't think that many people want

[20:42] these old games right now.

[20:44] And I still can't believe that they charge like what?

[20:46] Like 17.5 for that Orblivian edition.

[20:49] Absolutely stupid.

[20:50] You know, speaking of stupid, by the way,

[20:52] did you see now the new low for James Bond 60th?

[20:55] $13,000.

[20:57] $13,000 for a James Bond 60th,

[21:00] which now means that every single one

[21:03] is basically worth $13,000.

[21:06] And I was given out to Neil McCray on my Facebook page

[21:09] because he said he bought four of them

[21:11] and flipped three to James Bond collectors in the UK

[21:14] and made enough money to pay for his 60th anniversary edition.

[21:18] You know, the reason I was given out to Neil

[21:19] is he does not contribute to Canada's pinball podcast.

[21:22] He does not subscribe.

[21:24] He's a very wealthy individual, flies all over the world.

[21:27] And I gave him crap because I was like, Neil, think about it.

[21:29] Neil, do you donate to Pinside?

[21:31] He know what he said.

[21:32] He's like, yeah, I donate to Pinside

[21:33] because I spend a lot of time there.

[21:35] And then I'm like, brother, you are on my page every day.

[21:38] You're watching every Saturday morning spectacular.

[21:41] You engage with me every single day

[21:42] and you're not gonna kick five bucks,

[21:44] yet he'll spend $80,000 on four James Bond 60th.

[21:48] It's so weird to me that some people's mamas

[21:50] just didn't raise them right.

[21:52] They didn't raise them right.

[21:53] I bet he tips real bad at restaurants.

[21:55] You should go out with Canada and New York City.

[21:56] See, when I go out to my restaurants,

[21:58] how happy all the staff are

[21:59] because I take care of people who take care of me.

[22:01] I take care of people who take care of me.

[22:03] That's how it's supposed to be.

[22:04] You know, and that's why I'm thankful

[22:06] for each and every one of you who subscribes to the show.

[22:08] You give me a little bit of money every month.

[22:10] I give you a lot more than you're paying for.

[22:12] You know that.

[22:13] I mean, heck, you walk into a Starbucks now

[22:15] and coffee is like $7.

[22:17] All right, let's go on.

[22:17] So we got Haggis.

[22:18] Who's next?

[22:19] Who's next on my list?

[22:20] Pinball Adventures?

[22:21] Are we gonna talk about this?

[22:23] Pony Factory being tossed off the roof?

[22:25] Look, Donald, I know you're listening.

[22:27] You gotta just take the grand

[22:29] and throw the machine off the roof

[22:30] because Donald, you gotta weigh your options here.

[22:33] You gotta weigh your options.

[22:34] You're never gonna sell this thing for $5,000.

[22:36] You're never, the one on pin side for five grand

[22:39] is never selling.

[22:40] All of my selling of this event and shilling of it

[22:42] to Kingdom Come is not gonna make people

[22:45] wanna hand you $5,000, brother.

[22:47] And also like the GoFundMe page has been taken down.

[22:50] You know why?

[22:51] Because Andrew McBain complained about it.

[22:52] Well, I'm not surprised.

[22:53] I don't know, like it's at a point now

[22:55] where I've told Donald, like you could be a hero

[22:58] and just give this game to Todd Tucky,

[22:59] toss it off the roof and give everybody

[23:01] the holiday pinball content they would love to see

[23:04] or it's just gonna sit in your game room,

[23:06] not really functioning properly.

[23:08] It's not gonna give you any peace of mind.

[23:10] You're gonna wanna get rid of it.

[23:11] I know you keep saying like, I can't let it go.

[23:13] You have no options, man.

[23:15] It's not worth any money.

[23:16] The game is just not worth any money.

[23:18] After knowing what we know, nobody wants this game.

[23:21] And that's where I'm at on it.

[23:22] It's not personal.

[23:23] I gotta tell it like it is and that's how it is.

[23:26] All right, I think we covered everybody.

[23:27] Turner pinball, and nobody's buying that game.

[23:30] We got about a month until Twippy voting opens up.

[23:33] We're gonna see what they do to try to make Canada lose

[23:36] because the last person Colin wants to see up on stage

[23:39] is Canada and this is why everybody,

[23:41] get everybody ready to vote for Canada.

[23:43] I mean, out of all the years,

[23:45] this is really the year where behind the scenes,

[23:47] they tried to make a move to make me lose.

[23:50] I mean, think about that for a minute.

[23:51] I'm the six time champion, six in a row

[23:55] and they tried to change the rules

[23:57] so that I would not be eligible.

[23:59] So what I really would love for each and every one

[24:02] of you to do, I want you each to vote Canada.

[24:04] I want you to get your wives or your partners

[24:06] to vote Canada, get your kids to vote Canada.

[24:09] Everybody can vote Canada.

[24:11] Let's send a message to the damn Twippy committee

[24:13] and Colin that we don't wanna live in a world

[24:16] that tries to censor people for speaking objectively

[24:19] about a hobby and censorship is so un-American.

[24:23] It's so weird to me.

[24:24] And that's why no one's taking his thing seriously.

[24:26] Like, does anyone take that site seriously?

[24:29] It reads like it's written by an AI bot

[24:31] who doesn't know anything about pinball.

[24:33] And also he's only been in this hobby for two years.

[24:35] He doesn't know anything yet.

[24:36] He absolutely doesn't know anything.

[24:38] Like, I really don't trust anybody

[24:40] who came into pinball during the COVID period of pinball

[24:43] and then tries to be a trusted media outlet

[24:46] about the hobby.

[24:47] They have no idea.

[24:48] They have no context for anything.

[24:50] You know, at least with Don,

[24:51] you're getting like his enthusiasm

[24:53] about getting into the hobby and that's his angle.

[24:55] And by the way, people, and by the way,

[24:58] just for the record, I sent Don a really nice note

[25:01] offering to bury the hatchet, congratulating him

[25:03] that the trippy category for favorite new pinball podcaster

[25:06] is gonna open the door for him.

[25:08] I said, look, we both said bad things about each other.

[25:11] Let's just bury the hatchet and move on.

[25:12] Let me know if you're open to that.

[25:14] And guess what?

[25:15] No response.

[25:16] I've said, Cheng is a bunch of notes too.

[25:17] No response.

[25:19] Unable to have a conversation.

[25:20] Unable to talk it out.

[25:22] Unable to forgive.

[25:23] Unable to work it out.

[25:25] And that's the part that's weird to me is

[25:26] why do people wanna wake up and hold on

[25:28] to their anger forever?

[25:29] And there's no greater example of what benefits happen

[25:32] when you actually get over the anger and work it out.

[25:35] Like me and Jason Knapp.

[25:36] Like there was a period where like nobody was more disgusted

[25:38] with me than Jason Knapp.

[25:40] And we just talked it out like grown adults.

[25:42] And we basically met on this common ground

[25:45] where life is too short.

[25:46] We've both lost people we love

[25:48] way before we should have.

[25:49] And holding on to anger over a pinball feud

[25:52] is absolutely stupid.

[25:54] And now we have a great relationship

[25:55] and we enjoy each other's company.

[25:57] And that's how it can be with me and Jengis,

[25:59] me and Don, me and Zach, me and everybody.

[26:01] But when Kanata extends the olive branch,

[26:03] some people just wanna turn their back and walk away

[26:05] and that's fine.

[26:06] You know, but I wake up every day

[26:07] and I try to measure my life

[26:08] and how many days do I wake up in a good mood?

[26:11] And most days I'm there.

[26:12] It is hard to measure life by that simple measurement.

[26:15] It is hard to measure the success of your life

[26:17] by that simple measurement.

[26:19] How many days do you wake up in a good mood?

[26:21] Everybody, I hope this show makes you wake up

[26:24] in a good mood every Monday, Wednesday, Friday

[26:26] when you get a new show.

[26:27] And I hope tomorrow you wake up in a good mood

[26:30] and join me for Kanata's Saturday morning spectacular.

[26:33] Have a great Friday, we'll talk to you soon.

[26:35] Welcome to New York.

[26:36] It's so bright.

[26:37] They never blind me.

[26:39] Welcome to New York.

[26:40] So bright.

[26:42] They never blind.

[26:43] Welcome to New York.

[26:46] Welcome to New York.
