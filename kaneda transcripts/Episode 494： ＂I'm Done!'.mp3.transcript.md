[00:00] I couldn't believe my ears yesterday.

[00:20] I was sitting on the couch.

[00:22] I was doing work.

[00:23] I was obviously reading some pin-side, probably chatting with some of you guys on Facebook.

[00:29] And all of a sudden I hear Brenda go into the bedroom, turn on, Rick and Morty, and

[00:35] start playing.

[00:37] And it was like this moment that has never happened ever in this apartment, whether it was a

[00:43] pinball machine or arcade games, my beautiful wife has never felt the urge to just go into

[00:50] the room and play a pinball machine.

[00:54] And so it was music to my ears to hear Brenda playing the game.

[00:58] And then today she said, I want to play some Rick and Morty and we jumped on the game

[01:03] and she got all the way to the end sequence of Pickle Rick, which is a three-part mode,

[01:10] which I'm like, how is my wife, who really never shows much interest in playing pinball?

[01:18] How is she advancing through this game where a lot of people are saying it's brutal, it's

[01:23] too hard, it's too difficult, and she's just enjoying it.

[01:27] And so I am really excited to report to you that my wife just kicked my ass at Rick and

[01:34] Morty Pinball and this game, after having it for a couple days, I'm a different kind

[01:40] of podcaster and I want to tell you some sort of transformation I've gone through and I

[01:46] mean this.

[01:47] And I know you listen to every episode and I'm not, don't worry, I'm not going to come

[01:50] here and say like spooky pinball is the greatest pinball on the planet.

[01:53] No, that's not what this is about.

[01:55] I want to explain to you the transformation I've gone through over the last 48 hours

[01:59] since owning Rick and Morty Pinball.

[02:02] When I first got this game, it was brand new, it was shiny, it was gorgeous and the first

[02:08] thing that popped into my head was, well how do I keep this brand new shiny pinball machine

[02:14] looking brand new and shiny?

[02:17] And I think for a lot of you out there, for a lot of you OCD guys and a lot of you collectors

[02:22] especially.

[02:24] There's like this desire to put a pinball machine in your home and then to fully bullet

[02:29] proof it to the point where you're not even able to just play it without worrying about

[02:37] where and tear and whatnot.

[02:39] And I've been one of those people and I've been one of those people that before a game

[02:43] even gets turned on, I put a play field protector on to Batman.

[02:48] You want to put something in the shooter lane, you want to put some this or that or my

[02:51] lard or cliffies.

[02:53] And so what happened to me with Rick and Morty was this.

[02:56] When I first got the game, I was having issues with the scoop and the scoop was rejecting

[03:02] the ball.

[03:03] So then I lowered the game using three washers on the front, two washers on the side and

[03:10] it lowered the mechanism deeper into the scoop hole.

[03:14] But then all of a sudden Charlie got back to me and said, well that was a conscious decision

[03:19] to raise it up to protect the play field and to keep the play field from wearing.

[03:25] And then all of a sudden and I felt like I was in this crossroads, this dilemma of like,

[03:30] what do I do?

[03:31] Do I make it so the game is more fun to play with less rejects or do I, or then sacrifice

[03:37] the play field or do I protect the play field at the cost of more rejects, which will

[03:43] eat away at the enjoyment of the game.

[03:46] So that was like a lot of my like yesterday was like, well, what do I do?

[03:49] Do I do this?

[03:50] Do I do that?

[03:51] And I'm happy to tell you after reading Pinside, after sharing a lot of this on Facebook

[03:56] and talking to a lot of people and some people were like, bend the hood down, bend the hood

[04:01] up, put some duct tape at the back of it, use one wash or use two washers.

[04:05] My head began to spin and I reached a point where I was just like, you know what I'm going

[04:10] to do?

[04:11] I'm going to spend an hour and I'm going to figure out what's the best way to both

[04:17] protect the play field and also have less rejects from the scoop.

[04:22] And so what I've landed on, which works perfectly now for my game, I'm hardly getting any

[04:28] rejects and the lip of the scoop is sitting a little bit above the wood.

[04:32] So it will protect the wood is simply putting one washer on the mechanism, which lowers

[04:38] it just a little bit and that just a little bit of lowering the mech I think is perfect

[04:43] for my game.

[04:44] Now if you get your game and there's no rejects and you're having a good time with it,

[04:49] leave it alone.

[04:50] Don't even worry about it, don't even bother with it, okay?

[04:53] So just play the game and enjoy it.

[04:56] And so I finally get the scoop working right and I'm like, great, you know, then I'm

[04:59] looking over the game and people are saying, well, you should do this, you should do that.

[05:03] You should put mylar down, you should wait for Cliffey to make something for the game.

[05:07] You should put something where the ball gets dropped from the left rail.

[05:12] You should put something here or something there.

[05:14] And I just reached a point and I mean this, I really mean this.

[05:18] I reached a point yesterday where I looked at this game and I looked at Rick and Morty climbing

[05:23] out of the dimension hole and I looked at the beautiful artwork and I looked at what this

[05:27] thing is.

[05:28] It's a damn pinball machine.

[05:30] And I said to myself, you know what, screw all of this.

[05:35] Just play the f in game.

[05:37] Just enjoy the f in game.

[05:39] Just turn it on, flip it and play it.

[05:43] If you wax it and you take care of it, it's going to last a very, very long time.

[05:48] It's, you're going to be able to play it for years and if any little where happens here

[05:53] and there is any of that really going to detract from your enjoyment of this game because

[05:59] if you don't, Chris, I was talking to myself in the third person.

[06:02] If you don't let go of some of this OCD behavior, you're going to be a slave to maintaining

[06:10] the perfection of the game which will eliminate your ability to just play and enjoy the game.

[06:16] Now I know for some of you out there, you're just OCD.

[06:19] Like you can't deal with anything that's not perfect and any little thing that happens

[06:26] will eat away.

[06:27] Like if you get a little chip, you're going to stare at that little chip forever until

[06:31] it's fixed.

[06:32] Get that.

[06:33] Like I used to be that way about a lot of stuff when I was collecting toys I was that way

[06:37] when I was collecting arcade games that had to be a perfectly restored game.

[06:42] But you know, I just literally looked at it and I said, I was looking at the shooter lane

[06:46] and I had this moment where I'm staring at the shooter lane and I kept thinking to myself,

[06:51] why do people say, share picks of the shooter lane?

[06:57] And I guess back in the day and a shooter lane is a good indication of how many actual

[07:01] plays are on a game.

[07:02] But it's like this little two inch, three inch section of wood where the ball just kicks

[07:08] out and you fired over that area of wood.

[07:10] For some reason, we've attributed a lot of value to that three inch slab of wood and for

[07:18] collectors and OCD people, it's like preserving that wood so that it's perfect.

[07:24] So what?

[07:25] So like one day down the road, you're going to yank off the mylar or the protector or

[07:30] what's the point?

[07:32] Like I just, I've lost, we've lost the narrative a little bit with trying to keep these games

[07:38] so picture perfect.

[07:39] And I want to explain another thing too is like between the dimples and the craters and

[07:46] this and that, I think we've gone through a period in pinball in which we've lost a

[07:53] little bit of the focus.

[07:55] And I've been a culprit in that and I fully admit that.

[07:57] I mean, I think that for the amount of money we spend on these games, there is a certain

[08:02] quality level that should be in these games.

[08:06] Now we have definitely, we have definitely received playfields from manufacturers with

[08:11] known defects like inserts lifting up with the posts that are like sinking into the clear

[08:17] coat with cracking of the clear coat with artwork chipping off.

[08:21] And we've covered those issues on this podcast and we got places like Jersey Jack pinball

[08:27] to listen to these defects and what's happening and to give people replacement playfields.

[08:33] But as I look at Rick and Morty and I went over to Jack Bar today, I actually went over

[08:37] there because that game has a thousand plus plays on it.

[08:41] And I went over there and I looked at a few things, I looked at the shooter lane and

[08:44] there's nowhere whatsoever.

[08:46] I looked at the scoop hole and there's absolutely no clear coat chipping or much wear at all

[08:52] if any.

[08:53] And then I did a little thing, I like angled my head.

[08:55] You know how to do this, right?

[08:57] You angle your head down and you try to look to see if there's dimples and of course

[09:00] like there are dimples on the game.

[09:03] But when you stand over the game and you look down at Rick and Morty, you can't see any

[09:09] of them.

[09:10] It's not cratering like I've seen on some stern games and there is a difference.

[09:15] There is a difference between a slight sort of dimple or indent into the clear coat and

[09:21] just like the entire play field looking like the crater of the moon.

[09:25] All right?

[09:26] And Rick and Morty and Stranger Things are right next to each other at Jack Bar and the

[09:30] Rick and Morty just looks much nicer when you stand over it.

[09:33] I just think it's a better clear coat process.

[09:36] Now, for those of you out there who are OCD and you might be thinking you want to get

[09:41] the cruise man play field for Rick and Morty, go for it.

[09:46] I know that his process is even better than the one Charlie does and you're going to pay

[09:51] for that premium process and I hear that his games do dimple much less.

[09:58] But is it worth it?

[09:59] And I keep asking myself this over the last couple days.

[10:02] Is it worth it to pay another guy like $700 or $1000 to do that for the game?

[10:09] Is it?

[10:10] See, here's the thing.

[10:11] And again, I know this isn't always the way I talk on this podcast but is that going

[10:15] to make the game any more fun?

[10:18] Is it going to make the game any more enjoyable?

[10:21] The way this game is right now is just a load of fun and I hope you can, I hope you can

[10:27] hear my enthusiasm and I'm just so happy to play the game, to play the game with Brenda

[10:32] and I talk to her about it.

[10:34] I'm like, why are you liking this game so much?

[10:36] And I asked her like, how do you compare this game to Batman?

[10:39] And she's like, I like this game so much more.

[10:42] And it's funny to me because I thought that Rick and Morty would be more brutal, have

[10:45] tougher shots than Batman and she wouldn't be able to get into it.

[10:49] And she's like, no, the game's really easy.

[10:51] I know what to do and it makes total sense like I hit the ramp and then I hit the scoop

[10:57] to start an adventure.

[10:59] And then when I'm in the adventure, like it's so clear what to shoot at.

[11:03] Like she's like, she's like the only mode I really liked in Batman was the Penguin because

[11:08] it was really clear to hit the crane when the crane swung out.

[11:11] But this game is so much more enjoyable and she has so much more fun playing it and

[11:17] I sort of agree.

[11:18] I think that Rick and Morty wear it wins and I've said this, wear this game wins.

[11:24] It's just so much freaking fun and it has so much personality.

[11:29] Sure, it's got quirkiness to it.

[11:31] Sure, it's got some shots that are really difficult.

[11:34] But there's something about this game that's going to make you want to keep hitting start

[11:39] over and over again.

[11:40] I didn't think I'd like it this much.

[11:42] I didn't think I would enjoy it this much and I'm not just justifying it because I own

[11:46] it and I'm not here to sell you one because you can't even buy one.

[11:50] They're all sold out.

[11:51] I'm just saying that I rolled the dice with this game.

[11:54] I didn't think I would like it as much as I do.

[11:57] I didn't think Brenda would get into it and I just didn't think I would click with

[12:01] this game.

[12:02] But what I really love about this game and you're going to see when you get it and you're

[12:06] going to see when you play it.

[12:08] It's just the way the game comes at you.

[12:12] It's the way the game just sort of immerses you in the Rick and Morty world and again,

[12:17] the way you can play it is not complex.

[12:20] It's not like you're doing math.

[12:21] It all makes total sense and you can explain to someone how to play this game so easily

[12:27] and so quickly.

[12:28] Yeah, there are some deeper rule sets when you get into like multipliers and megacies

[12:33] and stuff like that.

[12:35] But for the most part, it is really, really easy.

[12:38] To understand how to play this game.

[12:40] And I think that's an art form when it comes to making modern pinball is how do you make

[12:45] a game that doesn't require like an entirely huge Bible or book to understand the complexity

[12:52] of the way the game works.

[12:55] And I think Rick and Morty does that so successfully.

[12:58] Are there things I wish there were in the game?

[13:00] Do I wish there were more mechanisms?

[13:02] Do I wish this in that?

[13:03] Yeah, I mean, there's moments in this game where I wish there were other ways to get

[13:07] to the damn garage.

[13:08] I won't lie.

[13:09] I wish I could somehow get to the garage from the lower right flipper.

[13:14] It's like, it's like right there.

[13:15] Like we're so used to being able to shoot to the upper left from the lower right flipper.

[13:20] But you can't.

[13:21] The only way to get to the garage is with the left flipper hitting the far right orbit

[13:27] and then off of the upper right flipper, which is the most difficult shot and hitting

[13:31] it off the tip of that flipper to go through the orbit into the garage itself.

[13:37] But you know, look, I'm still learning this game.

[13:39] I'm still learning what this game is about.

[13:42] I've got my scoop fixed.

[13:44] I'm going, am I going, you know, I'm just done OCDing with Pimbal.

[13:48] I'm really just done being this OCD guy.

[13:50] I'm just going to play the game.

[13:52] I'm going to freaking enjoy it.

[13:53] I'm happy just playing the game.

[13:56] I don't think this game even needs any real mods.

[13:59] The only real mod I did in this game was I changed the fan from the power supply in the

[14:04] game.

[14:05] Pimbal Monk makes a mod.

[14:06] I think it's like 20 bucks and it takes the loud noisy fan that is in this game and it

[14:12] replaces it with a much quieter fan.

[14:15] But I will tell you this, if you're thinking of doing this mod and the power supply fan

[14:20] drives you nuts, it is not, I repeat, it is not an easy thing to do.

[14:28] To get the power supply out of the spooky game, it's jammed all the way in the back of

[14:33] the cabinet and you have to unhook the connectors.

[14:36] Now if you do want to do this mod, keep a few things in mind.

[14:41] It may void your warranty, which it probably does.

[14:44] But when you disconnect the power supply, make sure you don't have to disconnect all those

[14:48] red and black wires from the power supply itself.

[14:53] Just disconnect the wire connector that's at the end of those wires.

[14:58] But you will have to, and this is the annoying part.

[15:01] You will have to disconnect the wires that go directly into the back of the power supply

[15:07] that's facing the back of the cabinet.

[15:09] There's only like a half an inch between that and the cabinet.

[15:15] So you're going to have to take off the L bracket.

[15:17] You're going to have to shimmy it out between wires.

[15:20] It was a pain in the ass.

[15:22] It was a pain in the ass.

[15:23] I ended up pulling out the ground wire connector from the fork that it was using.

[15:29] So I was like, oh my god, why did I even start doing this?

[15:33] I should have just lived with the louder fan.

[15:35] But we got it in.

[15:37] We got the new fan in and it is really, really quiet.

[15:40] So if you don't mind doing that work, but I'm telling you, this is not a simple plug-and-play

[15:46] thing.

[15:47] You've got to use a lot of different screwdrivers on the power supply.

[15:51] It's not just one screwdriver.

[15:53] It's two screwdrivers.

[15:54] And then one of them is smaller than the other annoying, annoying, annoying way to sort of

[16:00] make your game quiet.

[16:02] But I will say this, pinball monks instruction manual?

[16:06] Unbelievable.

[16:07] I don't think I've ever seen an instruction manual on how to change a part of a pinball

[16:12] machine or a mod that has been that detail.

[16:15] So thank you so much, a pinball monk for doing that.

[16:18] You know, people ask me like, is the topper annoying?

[16:21] Is the topper loud?

[16:22] And yes, the topper in Rick and Morty is very noisy.

[16:27] Sometimes I'm like, what is that?

[16:29] And it's the topper going.

[16:30] It's the dimension spinning.

[16:32] But here's the good news about the topper.

[16:34] It's freaking free.

[16:35] It didn't cost anything.

[16:37] And it's motorized and it moves and it lights up.

[16:40] I think someone can easily, and someone to do this because spooky gave us this much of

[16:46] the topper.

[16:47] If I were to like look at this game and say, what's one mod that the mod community should

[16:52] be doing?

[16:53] And I mean this, I mean the mod community has been just tacking stuff onto this game that's

[16:57] not really necessary.

[16:58] I don't think this game needs anything.

[17:00] I don't think the figures or the flipper bats or all this stuff do anything to Rick and

[17:05] Morty.

[17:06] I think the best mods in pinball, look at a game and enhance something versus just dropping

[17:13] in a bunch of stuff randomly all over the game.

[17:16] The greatest mod that someone can make for Rick and Morty pinball is to design a topper

[17:22] housing that can sort of sit on top of or frame the existing topper that spooky gave

[17:28] us and create like a three dimensional shadow box that goes over their topper that would

[17:35] also quiet down the motor noise because it's just exposed.

[17:39] And it also is the only ugly part of the game is that when you look at the game from the

[17:45] side, you can see that big motor sticking out with all the wires.

[17:49] It's like probably the ugliest topper to ever look at from the side.

[17:54] It's not bad from the front, but again, it was free.

[17:57] But that is the one mod that someone in the mod community needs to do is just make something

[18:03] to house the topper that is currently sitting on the machine.

[18:07] It's all right there.

[18:08] All you got to do is like make it like a shadow box thing to go over it.

[18:11] So I'm challenging you.

[18:13] Mod community to do this.

[18:14] I can't get over this butter cabinet.

[18:16] I keep looking at it.

[18:18] You got to go butter people.

[18:20] I would, you know, what's, if you had to decide between butter and a cruise man playfield,

[18:25] I still would go butter because here's the, here's the thing at the end of the day you

[18:28] could always go get a cruise man playfield at any time and swap it in.

[18:33] But if you don't go butter, you can't do it.

[18:37] You're really going to want the butter.

[18:38] And I saw John's game at Jack Barron.

[18:41] It's nice.

[18:42] It's nice.

[18:43] It's just no butter.

[18:44] Charlie, she give me a commission on every new butter cabinet order they get moving forward.

[18:49] That says canada.

[18:50] Like if you mentioned canada's name with butter cabinet, you get 10% off.

[18:54] Wouldn't that be great?

[18:55] No, he's not going to do that.

[18:56] I'm not showing for this company.

[18:58] I'm not showing for this company.

[18:59] I just think Scott Denise and spooky have a really fun game.

[19:03] I think people who are in on this game are going to have a lot of fun.

[19:07] Another thing I did today, which I, you know, I said I wasn't going to do this.

[19:10] I said I wasn't going to do this.

[19:12] I said I wasn't going to hype another game.

[19:14] I said I was just going to let it come out.

[19:16] But I did.

[19:17] I had my phone on me and I met up with someone and I said, Hey, man, look, you can't say

[19:23] anything.

[19:24] You can't share it with anyone.

[19:25] But do you want to see guns and roses?

[19:27] Pimball.

[19:28] And I showed it to this pinhead who you will never know who it is who will remain anonymous.

[19:34] And he said to me, the community is going to f in flip out when they see this game.

[19:40] Now that's him hyping it, not me.

[19:43] So you can't blame canada for saying that guns and roses is going to be the big hit that

[19:49] everyone's been waiting for.

[19:50] It was somebody else.

[19:52] He was just speechless when he saw the art and what's in the game.

[19:56] And he's just like, it's going to be f in flipping people's minds when they do it.

[20:00] And I'm going to order two of them is what he said.

[20:03] So there you go.

[20:04] Guns and roses.

[20:05] Now, where is, where is like, where's the follow up to Ken's teaser about innovation?

[20:10] I mean, I see some of you guys continuing to make fun of the fact that they haven't

[20:15] followed up with that teaser video.

[20:18] And I do agree it's a little weird to drop it out there and then go silent.

[20:22] But who cares?

[20:23] Who cares?

[20:24] I'm telling you right now, this game is going to be worth it.

[20:27] You're going to want a guns and roses.

[20:28] Like if you don't want a guns and roses, it's like, then you don't want awesome pinball.

[20:34] And I think guns and roses is going to be the game of the year.

[20:38] I know Rick and Morty's got all this.

[20:40] Hi, Rick and Morty's are really fun game and Rick and Morty is awesome and Rick and

[20:43] Morty might win game of the year, but guns and roses.

[20:46] I don't know, man.

[20:47] Eric is going to drop something in the pinball world that people are also going to love.

[20:52] What I will say is this.

[20:53] It makes me really happy to see the young guns creating the kinds of pinball experiences

[21:00] that are making people super excited and super happy.

[21:03] You got Keith L.

[21:04] I mean, he's not as young as Eric, but they're all new blood in pinball.

[21:08] Keith L. and Eric and Scott Denise.

[21:11] Those three, those three, I think, are bringing the most exciting pinball out into the world.

[21:17] They're trying to make a name for themselves.

[21:20] They're trying new things.

[21:21] They're not going back to the old ways.

[21:24] And I think there's no greater example than that than like, stranger things.

[21:27] It's like Brian Eddie, another fan layout, another, another, another.

[21:31] It's the same formula over and over again.

[21:34] John Borg, I think Ninja Turtles is a great game.

[21:38] I think he did a good job in blending a lot of the things that have worked really well

[21:43] in his other games that people love.

[21:46] But it's still like, there's only so many different John Borg designs.

[21:52] And even if you can mash them up in different ways, it's just you kind of could see this

[21:57] is what John Borg does.

[21:58] And I think what's exciting with these new guys is you can't really anticipate what's

[22:04] going to come from them.

[22:05] And that's why there's so much excitement when we get new blood in pinball.

[22:09] And look, I think there's totally room for a new blood and old blood.

[22:13] But man, if you look at who's really pushing, pushing pinball in new directions and who's

[22:19] really winning over the community, I mean, if you think about the designers that have

[22:23] the biggest fanfares, it is Keith L.

[22:25] Win, it is Eric and it is Scott Denise.

[22:29] To the point where, and I'm going to be totally honest, to the point where these designers

[22:34] are also getting like a pass, like it's almost like you can never say anything bad about

[22:40] them.

[22:41] And I want to say this, I do want to say this, so I do want this show to be a little bit

[22:44] balanced.

[22:45] I think one of the issues when you look at these designers and you fall in love with them

[22:50] and everything they do is golden, I do think it's detrimental to them learning as designers

[22:58] when we don't give them feedback.

[23:01] Because if we don't really share enough feedback at times when it's necessary, then they

[23:06] might repeat similar mistakes over and over.

[23:09] And the example of that is the scoop in Rick and Morty because I heard from all these

[23:14] TNA people that the scoop was very problematic, that the scoop in TNA is the same that's

[23:19] in Rick and Morty, that it would reject half of the time.

[23:22] And I'm like, where was the outcry of this scoop when TNA came out?

[23:26] I didn't see it.

[23:28] And so I think this is what happens is because people love Scott so much, they're reluctant

[23:33] to give them some of that feedback.

[23:36] And so I think moving forward, you know, guys like Scott, like if you hear that this thing

[23:41] is not working that well, you need to figure out a solve so that people like Canada don't

[23:46] have to put washers under his game.

[23:48] And I do agree with people, you should not have to bend stuff, you should not have to

[23:54] put washers.

[23:55] These are things that should have been caught at the design level of the game.

[24:00] And I think they sort of came up with a compromise.

[24:03] But man, I don't think people want to compromise between play field, where and gameplay, right?

[24:09] Figure out a way to give us both.

[24:11] Figure out a way to make the, and here's the thing that always kills me.

[24:14] Wouldn't the easiest way to do it is design that scoop so that it doesn't reject

[24:18] the ball and then give Cliffey a play field to make it play field protector and simply

[24:25] ship the game with with the cliffey installed on the scoop.

[24:30] I still don't understand why people need to wait for Cliffey after the game is released

[24:36] to get these products.

[24:38] Why aren't manufacturers working with Cliffey from the very beginning?

[24:42] I mean, you're working with back alley creations, you're working with mod people to make stuff

[24:47] for the games.

[24:48] For a lot of people out there, the cliffies are a really important mod that they wish they

[24:52] could just have in their game on day one.

[24:54] You know, that was the other thing going through my mind, getting Rick and Morty number

[24:58] 50.

[24:59] I mean, I'm number 50.

[25:00] I think they might be at almost a hundred.

[25:02] Some of you guys out there have months and months and months to go.

[25:07] And so for you guys, you're at the advantage of, well, by then Cliffey will have protectors.

[25:12] And who knows, Chuck might start installing those into the future games.

[25:17] And who knows, like what else will be designed for the game by the time you get yours?

[25:21] You're going to have people who get their games with cruiseman play field.

[25:25] So you'll be able to compare whether or not it's worth it to do that.

[25:29] What my game number 50, I think this game was already built by the time they announced

[25:33] the cruiseman play field thing.

[25:35] Now, would I have added that to my game?

[25:37] I'll tell you this.

[25:39] If I had added the cruiseman on top of this, you're over $10,000 for a Rick and Morty

[25:45] game.

[25:46] And I gotta say it, like there's just comes a point where you're not getting that much

[25:52] more in joint.

[25:53] You're not getting any more enjoyment.

[25:55] It's the same game.

[25:56] A guy that just gets a base level Rick and Morty is having the same exact fun when he's

[26:01] playing the game as someone who has a butter cabinet and all this other stuff going on.

[26:05] Because remember, like, Rick and Morty is just one game.

[26:09] There's no pro version.

[26:10] There's no premium.

[26:11] There's no, there's no like stupid topper for $600 to unlock a mode.

[26:16] You know, the more I was thinking about that, the equivalent of Jurassic Park with that

[26:21] stupid goat mode costing like a few hundred dollars on top of the cost of the topper,

[26:26] that would be like Rick and Morty.

[26:28] Imagine if they did this.

[26:29] Imagine how easy it would have been for spooky to be like, well, you can buy this Rick

[26:33] and Morty topper with a dimension on it.

[26:36] And if you buy it, it comes with an exclusive dimension that you can only visit if you bought

[26:42] the topper.

[26:43] They easily could have pulled a fast one like that and tried to get all 750 people to buy

[26:50] an additional thing with DLC connected to it and they didn't.

[26:54] And I'm just going to say it.

[26:55] I know who's out there advocating that you should just buy this topper and it doesn't matter

[27:02] and it's all subjective.

[27:03] And I just disagree.

[27:05] And I disagree.

[27:06] And you know me, I have been very strident in saying if you support moves like this Jurassic

[27:13] Park topper, you are a moron.

[27:16] If you buy El Vira signature edition, you are a moron.

[27:21] And I know that someone out there has a big problem with me calling people morons, but

[27:26] you are.

[27:28] And if you do that and you support this stuff, I don't care if it's only $600 to you,

[27:34] it's just sending a message to Stern Pimbal and it's only Stern Pimbal doing this.

[27:39] Remember that.

[27:40] It is only Stern Pimbal.

[27:42] The number one Pimbal company in the world, the Pimbal company making the most money

[27:47] in the world.

[27:48] They're the only ones doing this.

[27:50] They are the only ones finding new ways to rip off customers.

[27:55] And I think it's just getting to the point where I'm just getting tired.

[27:59] I'm getting tired of the counterpoint, the counterargument, the other Pimbal media

[28:06] personality.

[28:07] Is it distributor for Stern?

[28:09] And I just don't think ethically.

[28:12] You want to talk ethically.

[28:13] I don't think you can be a media outlet.

[28:16] I don't think you can be a Pimbal media person who is talking to people and trying to give

[28:22] them some sort of objective feedback on something happening.

[28:27] I get it.

[28:28] It's all the subjective category.

[28:30] But how can you really go on the airwaves and give your opinion about something that you're

[28:38] also selling because you're never going to give a negative opinion about the thing you're

[28:45] selling.

[28:46] And then the only negative opinion you ever give is towards the companies and products you

[28:52] don't sell.

[28:54] And to me, isn't it all at this point?

[28:56] Like I've ragged on spooky Pimbal so many times.

[29:02] And here I am with a spooky Pimbal machine in my apartment.

[29:06] I've ragged on Jersey Jack Pimbal so many times.

[29:10] They've made so many stupid mistakes at J.J.P.

[29:14] So many dumb decisions and so many of their games, which is why so many of you don't own

[29:18] Jersey Jack games.

[29:20] And you know who you are.

[29:21] It's much larger than the Jersey Jack fan page that had a ban me because I was just

[29:26] raising some of the issues with the game.

[29:29] Now those guys are suckers because now they're going to miss out on all the guns and roses

[29:32] stuff.

[29:33] But you know what I'm saying?

[29:34] It's like you listen to this show because I'm not biased.

[29:39] I am not biased.

[29:40] If I have told you everything you can expect with Rick and Morty.

[29:44] I haven't I haven't held back.

[29:45] I told you it dimpled.

[29:46] I was wrong.

[29:47] The game dimples.

[29:48] But it still looks great to play field the way it is.

[29:52] It looks like class.

[29:53] It does.

[29:54] The game has some frustrating shots.

[29:56] The game can be brutally hard.

[29:58] But watching Brendan run through the game like this today, I was like, well, it's not

[30:01] that hard.

[30:02] My wife who doesn't play much pinball just got through the three stages of pickle Rick.

[30:07] Like if you can do that, you can accomplish anything in the game.

[30:11] And that's what has her excited.

[30:13] But you know, I know there's been a lot of the other back and forth with the top right.

[30:16] It's just the principle.

[30:17] It's the principle of where we are in pinball.

[30:21] And yes, we all agree on most of this stuff.

[30:24] We all agree that we should just enjoy these games.

[30:27] We all agree that all of pinball is subjective.

[30:30] You know, some guy out there might love his Elvira signature edition.

[30:35] But I can't I can't with with good conscious watch stern pinball charge $15,000 for that

[30:43] POS game.

[30:44] It's a POS.

[30:45] It's it's the same game for $8,000.

[30:49] $7,000 more for nothing.

[30:52] And yet like if you're a distributor for stern, you're hyping it.

[30:56] You're going on the airwaves and saying how great, how happy the buyer is.

[31:00] It's stupid and stupid people are ruining it for everybody else because they're showing

[31:06] stern that it that they can get away with it.

[31:09] And then let's do it to the next game.

[31:11] Let's do it with Ninja Turtles.

[31:12] You know, and that's just where I'm at.

[31:14] That's where I'm at.

[31:15] It's it's I have I will never apologize for calling someone stupid who supports Stern's

[31:21] stupid moves right.

[31:23] Two wrongs don't make a right.

[31:25] They don't and I'm staring at a free topper.

[31:27] I'm staring at a beautiful game and I'm just glad we have options.

[31:32] And I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now, it is one hell of a time to

[31:36] be in pinball.

[31:37] It is one hell of a time to see this tiny company from Benton, Wisconsin go from making one

[31:43] of the ugliest games of all time in America's most haunted to have to see them learn and

[31:48] climb to a game like Rick and Morty.

[31:51] You know, this game was right next to Stranger Things at Jack Bar and I'm like, man, it's

[31:55] at the point now we're like spooky and stern.

[31:57] They're they're they're neck and neck.

[31:59] They're neck and neck with what's in these games.

[32:02] Jersey jacks on another level.

[32:03] I absolutely absolutely Jersey jacks on another level.

[32:07] Their games are more premium than both Stern and spooky.

[32:10] Everybody knows that.

[32:11] It's exciting to see what's going to come from CGC.

[32:14] Guns and roses is going to blow you guys away.

[32:16] I just know that it's going to rock so goddamn hard you guys are going to love it.

[32:19] I know it.

[32:21] I know if look I will if you see guns and roses and you're disappointed in it.

[32:28] Let's see what I'll do.

[32:29] I will.

[32:31] What should I do?

[32:32] What should I do?

[32:33] Well, we'll figure something out.

[32:34] I always never want to say these things because then I think I don't know.

[32:39] I said alien was coming back.

[32:40] Here's the crazy part.

[32:42] Here's the crazy part.

[32:43] Alien is coming back.

[32:45] It really is.

[32:46] I know you think I'm lying, but alien is coming back.

[32:50] The Pimbo brothers are not done.

[32:52] They went to Chicago gaming company and tried to get Chicago gaming company to make the game.

[32:57] Chicago gaming company said no, but it's happening.

[33:01] Trust me.

[33:02] Go ask the people at Chicago gaming company if that happened and they'll confirm it.

[33:06] Hot Wheels is going to be streamed this weekend by Jack Danger.

[33:10] So we finally get to see what's going on over to American Pimbo.

[33:13] But American Pimbo has got three lines.

[33:15] So I don't know are they going to make some of these contract manufactured games?

[33:18] Some of the homebrew stuff we've been seeing at the shows.

[33:21] We've got a lot of stuff coming out deep root.

[33:23] Robert Mueller, Raza Robert.

[33:26] Raza Robert.

[33:26] I should say, Raza Robert.

[33:28] You know, I should give him that nickname.

[33:29] That's coming.

[33:30] You think Robert spent five years and nothing is going to get on the launch pad?

[33:35] Absolutely not.

[33:36] So it's an exciting time.

[33:37] I'm glad I've got this machine, but I'm also glad of what's down the road.

[33:41] I will definitely own a Guns and Roses.

[33:43] Definitely.

[33:45] And Rick and Morty is a lot of fun.

[33:47] I mean, this could be the one two punch of my year.

[33:49] Could be Rick and Morty and G and R.

[33:52] But man, I really want to see what else comes out.

[33:54] Anyway, guys, thank you for following my journey to getting a Pimbo machine.

[33:59] I am now a valid Pimbo podcaster.

[34:02] Nobody can insult me now for not owning a Pimbo machine.

[34:06] I look forward to getting to know this game.

[34:09] I do want to thank all the people at Spooky Pimbo who have been so nice and so helpful.

[34:15] I had a little thing where there's like a little blemish on my monitor,

[34:19] which was just a little bit of the plastic was touching the monitor.

[34:22] Spooky Pimbo made me.

[34:24] They made me a video on how to correct that.

[34:28] They didn't have the video already.

[34:30] They, the guys in the shop made a quick video and Morgan sent it to me.

[34:35] See, that is why you have to kind of love Spooky Pimbo.

[34:40] I think that this is, this is what people want.

[34:43] They want to feel like the company they buy from makes them feel good.

[34:47] And it's always been my thing with Stern.

[34:49] They just, is Stern making you feel good?

[34:51] It is Stern like, with the stuff they're doing lately.

[34:54] Like really?

[34:55] Does it make you feel good?

[34:56] No.

[34:57] You know what makes you feel good?

[34:58] Can they just pinball podcasts and some lady Gaga?

[35:01] Let's get out of here.
