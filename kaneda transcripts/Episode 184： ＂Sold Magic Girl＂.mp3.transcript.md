[00:00] I feel like there are no more pinball wars to fight.

[00:07] I have sold my magic all.

[00:12] After 10 months, I do feel out of danger, getting rid of it.

[00:19] You know, all of us would benefit if we just would surrender.

[00:41] The rumors are true. Magic Girl is gone.

[00:45] We're going to talk about that on this episode of Knitt's Pinball Podcast,

[00:49] along with other stuff and news going on in the Pinball hobby.

[00:54] It's December 7th. New York City Thursday night.

[00:59] The Christmas Tree is lit. Bubba is eating the Christmas tree.

[01:03] It's the holidays. I think a lot of us are looking forward to the holiday time period.

[01:10] I'm having some time off playing some pinball, having some eggnog,

[01:13] and just enjoying friends and family.

[01:16] Let's talk about Magic Girl and talk about why after 10 months of ownership,

[01:22] the time had come for me to say goodbye.

[01:26] To a machine that is really an interesting machine to own.

[01:31] You all know this story.

[01:33] If you listen to this podcast, you've heard all the backstory.

[01:36] You know all about J-pop. You know all about what's going on currently with his situation.

[01:41] I have to say, owning Magic Girl for a 10 month period.

[01:46] It was definitely a tumultuous ownership for someone like me,

[01:53] simply because it was my only pinball machine.

[01:56] For those of you who have played Magic Girl, it is the most visually stunning machine

[02:01] you will ever stand in front of.

[02:03] It doesn't function properly.

[02:06] The software and the mechanisms just don't go together.

[02:09] I don't know if they ever will.

[02:12] Where Magic Girl belongs is where Magic Girl is going.

[02:16] It belongs in a collection.

[02:19] It belongs in a place where an individual has a lot of machines.

[02:24] It belongs to be celebrated and put out there for the world to see.

[02:31] You know because Magic Girl is a piece of pinball history,

[02:34] it is a machine that will always have a very interesting story behind it.

[02:39] It just can't be the only machine in an apartment like mine.

[02:44] I found a really nice gentleman.

[02:46] He saw my ad on eBay.

[02:49] We exchanged nice pleasantries.

[02:51] We came to an agreement on a price.

[02:54] I'm not going to tell you what that price is, but I will tell you this.

[02:57] I lost some money on Magic Girl.

[02:59] I didn't lose a ton of money on Magic Girl, but I lost some money.

[03:03] You have to factor in that I own the machine for a year.

[03:07] How much would it cost to put a Magic Girl on location?

[03:10] Could you charge $2 a play?

[03:12] Then maybe I definitely got my money's worth in terms of the amount I played at.

[03:16] Probably not.

[03:18] I think Magic Girl will continue to be within the pinball universe over the next couple years.

[03:27] I do not think that Deep Root will ever successfully remake Magic Girl.

[03:32] I don't.

[03:33] They might get the rights to Zombietti's artwork.

[03:37] They might be working with John.

[03:39] I just never think you're ever going to see a machine like the Zidware Magic Girl ever come out.

[03:45] If they ever do create something, I think it looks nothing like the Zidware machines that John shipped with American pinball.

[03:53] I think that Deep Root's chances of ever getting this machine out are very slim to none.

[04:00] But if they do pull the rabbit out of a hat, we'll see.

[04:04] It's going to be a couple of years until we see if that ever comes to fruition.

[04:08] I have to say this.

[04:11] I have to say this.

[04:12] The real Magic and Magic Girl is simply the work that Jeremy and Matt Andrews did.

[04:18] It's stunning.

[04:20] John Papaduke is a great designer.

[04:23] He is the greatest creative director.

[04:26] I believe in the history of pinball.

[04:28] He's not an engineer.

[04:30] He can't make mechanisms.

[04:31] He can't make parts.

[04:33] He can't do it all.

[04:35] He tried to do it all.

[04:37] And I almost somewhat feel sorry for the guy because his talents and his skills have really gone underutilized.

[04:49] And in this resurgence of pinball, and it's just kind of crazy that with all these companies and with all these new pinball machines coming out,

[04:57] there's a lack of creative directors and designers in the hobby that John Papaduke just really didn't understand his own weaknesses and his own faults.

[05:08] And because of that, he has nobody to blame but himself for how people view him in this hobby.

[05:16] He is for the most part been ostracized.

[05:19] He's now been signed up by a startup that's never ever built a game.

[05:27] It's almost like if some team drafted Colin Kaepernick now, but it wasn't even an NFL team.

[05:35] I mean, that's sort of what it's like with Deeproot working with John Papaduke now.

[05:40] I really don't know how the story is going to end for him.

[05:44] I don't know how it's going to end for Rosa customers, but I know the owner of my magic girl will be very happy with the machine.

[05:51] It's in great condition. Everything that Kenwork does work.

[05:55] We wrapped it fast Eddie and I wrapped this thing for like almost two hours.

[06:00] If you ever need to ship a pinball machine in the northeast of this country, fast Eddie is your guy.

[06:08] He's in his early 70s, he's a tank, and he wraps machines like nobody else.

[06:15] I mean, this thing had we went from cardboard.

[06:19] It was like furniture blankets, cardboard, shrink, the wrap, the saran wrap, whatever the stuff is called, the shrink wrap.

[06:27] Then we went back to more cardboard, back to more blankets.

[06:30] It ended up leaving here looking like a ginormous black cocoon.

[06:36] It was wrapped better than the game arrived.

[06:39] It's having a long journey to its new home, but I'm happy to say that magic girl is gone.

[06:46] I have to say this, it is a little bit of a relief to finally be done with the saga that is magic girl.

[06:54] I don't think the new owner will experience any of that.

[06:57] I think people who have these machines who can appreciate them will enjoy having them in their collections, but I'm happy to be done with it.

[07:04] We say farewell to the magic girl chapter and my connection to magic girl.

[07:11] I don't have any regrets when I did buy the machine.

[07:18] I thought it would work. I got to own a magic girl. I got to spend almost a year with it.

[07:25] I think it was fun having it in my possession, but I'm happily able to let it go.

[07:33] You may see some magic girl items come up for sale from me.

[07:38] I have two very rare hard to find items that I had bought.

[07:45] The plan for my bedroom initially was to make it a shrine to magic girl.

[07:52] During that planning, I acquired a couple items that are really, really amazing.

[07:57] I think these things are going to be things that just pick more collectors in general are going to want to have.

[08:02] I think I'm going to let them go. I think you're going to want to have them.

[08:06] They're really, really cool.

[08:08] Look forward to those things going up on eBay. I will let you know when that happens.

[08:12] Speaking of letting go, the other thing that I am doing is I am selling because I have no room for it.

[08:20] This one hurts me. This one hurts me.

[08:23] I am selling my tales of the Arabian Knights.

[08:27] It has been reworked, restored by Eddie Kramer in New York.

[08:34] If you don't know Eddie Kramer, he is amazing.

[08:37] The man basically makes stuff look better than you.

[08:42] Eddie has, as you know, my tales of the Arabian Knights was one of these like machines

[08:47] where everything above the play field looked absolutely gorgeous.

[08:51] Everything below it looked terrible.

[08:55] Eddie basically spent countless hours basically restoring the parts,

[09:02] putting all the right parts in, undoing tons of shitty like solder work and hacks.

[09:08] Everything you can think of, he went through and got this machine to where it just looks incredible now.

[09:15] Coupled with all the newer elements of the game, like a CPR gold play field,

[09:20] it's got the color DMD, it's got the impossible to find, leaves a horrific topper.

[09:25] It's got gold near blades, it's got brass plating, it was one of the last machines that Mike Chestnut brass plated.

[09:32] It's got the brass coin door, it's got everything you can think of.

[09:36] I mean, you will not find.

[09:38] You'd be hard pressed to find a tot in that's nicer than this.

[09:41] I mean, it's up there. It's really up there.

[09:44] So if you are interested in buying my tales of the Arabian Knights,

[09:48] please send me an email, a Canadian pinball, that's KAN-EDA pinball at gmail.com,

[09:56] and we can talk price.

[09:58] It's not going to be cheap, I'm not going to just give this thing away, it's not like a fire sale.

[10:03] But for those of you who are just like wondering, you know, it costs money to restore a game,

[10:09] it costs money to buy new parts, it costs money to find some of these items,

[10:13] and then just some items on this machine that good luck finding it,

[10:16] you will not find like a laser-effic topper for tot in, like anywhere,

[10:20] anymore, and they really are amazing.

[10:23] So we'll see. If someone wants a nice tot in, you've got one on the market.

[10:28] I would list it on Pinside, but I'm banned.

[10:30] All right, so that's what's going on.

[10:33] The third part that's going on is Batman 66 will be entering the department very, very soon.

[10:42] I am super excited to take possession of Batman.

[10:45] This game continues, continues to do probably one of the greatest 180s in pinball history.

[10:52] We even saw this week another code update.

[10:57] I mean, isn't it incredible how there is nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,

[11:00] and now the damn is sort of breaking on this game, and much, much, you know,

[11:05] much disturbance credit, and they said this, instead of just doing little minor things every two weeks,

[11:11] they held back, they held back.

[11:13] And now the game is at a point where it's really good, and it's not even done.

[11:18] And there's so much more that is going to go into it.

[11:21] We're only at 0.84, and the latest code update had a really, really cool feature

[11:28] where you can change the television in the game.

[11:33] I haven't played it, so I'm going off for what people say.

[11:37] But you can change the channel for different modes, so like when you're stacking different modes

[11:41] or you're battling different villains, you can go back and forth and change the,

[11:45] I believe it's on the villain vision, right?

[11:48] And you can hit the gadget button and it switches channels, which is really cool,

[11:53] because then all the inserts and everything changes.

[11:55] It's almost basically like you're changing channel on the TV, and when you go to the different channel,

[12:00] it activates the different mode.

[12:02] And I don't think any pimples ever quite done something like this.

[12:06] And again, I think George Gomez's comments a few weeks ago that we haven't seen anything yet

[12:12] are indicative of the amount of passion and time Stern is going to put into this machine.

[12:19] And basically, what's happened now is there's now a new run on Batman 66s.

[12:24] I mean, it's hard to deny that Batman prices are holding really strong.

[12:30] And just to give you an example of that, there, as I mentioned, that there was an LE machine

[12:35] that I knew was still new in box.

[12:37] That machine sold the next day after I mentioned that.

[12:40] It sold for $12,000, like that.

[12:44] Like so quickly where I feel like we could have probably got $13,000 for it.

[12:49] So what does that mean?

[12:51] What does that mean?

[12:52] Another guy emailed me and said he found one locally for $11,500.

[12:56] Now remember, the LE machines when they first came out, they were $10,000.

[13:01] Pretty much $9,500 was the street price on them.

[13:05] Now they're still selling strong.

[13:08] In juxtaposition to that, in juxtaposition for that, a Star Wars LE was $9,000 new.

[13:16] And there was one for sale on eBay.

[13:19] Not eBay, sorry, Pinside.

[13:21] That still hasn't sold.

[13:23] And it's listed for $7,300.

[13:26] So just think about the different direction these two games are going.

[13:30] You have Star Wars declining and you have Batman increasing or really holding its value nicely.

[13:37] Now we've said the reason why I think this is happening is basically there are 80 super LEs and 240 LEs of Batman.

[13:48] They come with what I believe to be the greatest topper, maybe in all of Pimball.

[13:54] And because of that, right?

[13:56] People don't want to let them go.

[13:58] There's something special about this game that makes people want to hold onto them.

[14:03] Now there's a guy who's selling a super LE right now for $15,500 that's still available.

[14:08] But even then, right?

[14:10] He's not selling it for $13,000 or $14,000.

[14:12] He's selling it for $500 more than he paid for it.

[14:16] And it's like that's a really expensive game to begin with.

[14:21] You know, he's not going to budge on it.

[14:23] I think it's an interesting time for him to sell a super LE just considering why not just wait until the code is done.

[14:30] But Star Wars is going to keep heading south.

[14:33] And I've said this, I said a year after Star Wars comes out, you are going to see Star Wars LE's sell for like $6,800.

[14:41] And we're headed in that direction.

[14:43] And the reason why, reason why, not just because I think the game is still a barren, bad theme integration,

[14:50] I think because they made 800 of them.

[14:54] 800 of them.

[14:56] It doesn't feel special.

[14:58] It doesn't feel limited.

[14:59] And I think that's going to continue to cripple the market on Star Wars LE's.

[15:03] I think 600 game of thrones, sorry game of thrones.

[15:07] Guardians of the Galaxy, way too many.

[15:10] I would be surprised if they sell more than 350 or 400 Guardians of the Galaxy LE's.

[15:17] I think there's going to be a lot, a lot of those machines left over in LE trim.

[15:23] Simply because the artwork isn't the best on the LE and everyone's just going to go and get the upgraded armor for like the premium and be fine with it.

[15:32] Because then there's really no other reason to go in on the LE.

[15:36] I think Stern just didn't give you enough special stuff.

[15:40] And I think it's important.

[15:42] I think as we've seen, even if you just give one element, one element that people really, really, really want,

[15:50] like a topper, like the Batman topper, that can be enough to make people not want to let go.

[15:57] The other thing is you can't make too many, right?

[15:59] You got to make just the right amount where people will have fear that they won't be able to get one back

[16:05] if they let it walk.

[16:08] So exciting time for me. I'm really looking forward to being able to hop on a machine.

[16:13] I know this sounds silly, right? Hop on a machine that actually works.

[16:16] But I've gone almost a year with a non-working game.

[16:21] So I'm super, super excited to get back to where most of you are every day.

[16:27] And I think Magic Girl in a weird way has level set me.

[16:30] It makes me appreciate almost all Pimball that works, which is every Pimball in the game, pretty much, but Magic Girl.

[16:37] Because, you know, it's taking me to a place where it's like beyond frustrating that you hit this rock bottom and realize,

[16:46] I think the thing I realize the most coming out of Magic Girl saga is the importance of code,

[16:54] the importance of the software speaking to the hardware.

[16:59] Because, you know, I say this, if Magic Girl just had, if it just had a couple of those mechanisms working, right?

[17:07] If the levitating chamber worked, if the middle mechanism worked,

[17:11] where the ball shot up and held itself in mid-air, right? There's that big magnet there.

[17:16] If just those two things worked and the code supported that,

[17:21] where I could at least place some modes and show people those things, I would still have Magic Girl in my possession.

[17:29] But the fact of the matter is, is it doesn't work.

[17:33] And people have had enough time to look it over and come to the conclusion that making it work is too much work.

[17:43] And that's why Magic Girl is gone.

[17:46] If it did anything magical, I would still have it. If I could just show you one magical thing, I would still have it.

[17:53] But I can't. So it's time to let it go.

[17:56] Alright. What else is going on in Pimball? Probably the dumbest rumor I've ever seen.

[18:01] And Pinside has some real stupid people on it. We know who they are.

[18:05] But the thing with Pinside that's funny is, people could just start any rumor and then it catches on.

[18:09] And because I could just say, oh, there's a rumor Jersey Jack Pimball is going to make big trouble in little China.

[18:15] I heard it. Someone told me, I mean, I could start that rumor on this show easily.

[18:19] And that would carry over to Pinside and everyone would be like, I heard it on this show that big trouble in little China is going to be made.

[18:26] You know, it's just, it's that easy to make up a rumor.

[18:29] But this rumor about Jersey Jack Pimball and Willie Wonka, I think goes down as one of the dumbest rumors ever.

[18:36] And that is that they're going to make Willie Wonka.

[18:39] It's going to be based on the Gene Wilder film, the original, that's the best.

[18:43] But that it's going to be a re-theme of a game, a re-theme.

[18:49] And I'm like, what? And they had like Shrek or some other titles they were going to re-theme.

[18:54] First of all, Jersey Jack Pimball is not going to re-theme a Stern machine.

[18:58] So that's not going to happen. They also aren't going to re-theme one of their older games because they only have four games.

[19:07] You can't re-theme so soon in your product cycle.

[19:11] And there's nothing about Jersey Jack that indicates they would ever even remotely consider this.

[19:18] They have Eric as a designer, they have Pat Lawler as a designer.

[19:22] There's nothing, nothing that indicates this rumor to be true.

[19:26] Do I think they're making Willie Wonka? Yes. Do I think we're going to see it anytime soon?

[19:30] Absolutely not. I think you're going to probably see a music pen.

[19:35] And I think you're going to see Toy Story after Pirates of the Caribbean.

[19:39] And I think the music pen and the rumor being, this is pretty solid.

[19:44] Is I heard there's been one individual hanging around J.J.P.s a few times.

[19:49] And he goes by the name of Slash.

[19:52] So are we going to see a new Guns and Roses Pimball machine made by Jersey Jack?

[19:58] I for one, I for one would love that.

[20:01] I think that would be the best choice.

[20:04] I think a nod in his lifetime Pimball machine would be incredible.

[20:08] I think now that Guns and Roses has even larger catalog, it'd be really cool.

[20:14] I think it'd be great.

[20:17] So we'll see. But Jersey Jack has to eventually make a music pen.

[20:22] Now I mean it's sort of like part of the formula for a successful Pimball company.

[20:26] And guns would just be terrific.

[20:28] I think the original Data East Machine is incredible.

[20:31] But imagine like a modern version with guns and roses.

[20:37] I mean the issue might be like licensing all that music and like getting axel on board to do it all.

[20:42] But I think that could be incredible.

[20:44] And I think much like the original Data East Machine for those of you who aren't aware.

[20:49] But what was really cool about that machine is there's actually like a couple songs on there

[20:54] that were unreleased guns and roses songs.

[20:57] And I think it would be incredible.

[21:00] Incredible, credible, credible.

[21:02] If Jack could get guns to give him like a few tidbits of some of the material that Axel still has

[21:08] during the Chinese democracy era because there are two more albums worth of material that he never released during that era.

[21:16] So super cool. If that happens again like years from now.

[21:20] So I'm not holding my breath.

[21:22] You know speaking of like selling Pimball machines.

[21:25] It's a really bad time for some of the collectors out there that have super high end versions of original games that we know are being remade.

[21:36] There's a gentleman in California, Robert Winter, who's got two gorgeous machines.

[21:42] Two gorgeous machines.

[21:44] He's got an attack from Mars. It's sort of like a really unique machine with new cabinet artwork and fully restored everything.

[21:51] He's trying to sell that for $14,500.

[21:55] And he's got a cactus canyon continued for $15,000.

[22:00] So roughly like $30,000 tied up in two machines that are about to be remade.

[22:09] One is already remade, right? Attack from Mars.

[22:12] So I think a lot of the top of the market, the top of the market guys in some of these machines.

[22:20] We're seeing so many cactus canyons come up for sale.

[22:23] So many monster bashes come up for sale.

[22:26] It's at a point now where everyone needs to realize it's your days of having these like original versions of these games be worth north of like $9,000, $10,000.

[22:39] It's over. It's over. Why would anybody buy an original cactus canyon right now for $15,000?

[22:48] The remake will come out.

[22:50] It will be the same game with better software, newer parts, a better screen, and probably a kick-ass top or like the attack from Mars Topper.

[23:00] All for like $8,000.

[23:04] And that's the thing. It's like you kind of have to be a sucker to pay that, like the $15,000 price for a cactus canyon like he's advertising.

[23:16] Maybe before the remakes, stuff like that would be considered and maybe even sell.

[23:23] We used to see things sell like around that like $16,000, $19,000 for a cactus canyon new in box.

[23:30] But not anymore.

[23:32] Planetary Pimball is completely pulling the carpet out from underneath the high end collector market.

[23:40] And they're going to make everything that people are seeking.

[23:44] They really are. If it's not them, it's going to be someone else.

[23:48] But I think if I was a high end collector, you know, and if I, like if you just love your machines and don't want to sell them, then there's, then you have nothing to worry about.

[23:58] And you think if you're worried about the value and the equity you have in your Pimball machines, I have to imagine you're, you've got to be somewhat worried about what's going on.

[24:10] Now I always wonder, like I want to get like frolic on this show. I wonder what guys like him think who went all in on like every single Stern DMD game for such a long period of time.

[24:21] Because those games continue to plummet in value. I get he's had years of enjoyment, but it's hard not to think about the fact that someone could just probably replicate his collection tomorrow for like 30 or $40,000 less than he paid for that collection.

[24:41] And then suddenly it doesn't start to feel like Pimball is even worth mentioning in the same sentence as an investment, right?

[24:49] We all should have just bought bitcoins instead of pre-ordering, you know, Wizard of Oz.

[24:56] It'd be funny if you looked at like Bitcoin purchases versus Wizard of Oz, you probably, the price of a Wizard of Oz to like back then is probably worth over a million dollars in Bitcoin.

[25:08] I tend to understand Bitcoin, I'm not even going to go down that road. It just fusters me, these like manufactured ways to make money that don't really add any value to the world.

[25:17] So a pin that nobody wants, there's a rumor of a Bon Jovi Pimball machine and it got unanimously shit on.

[25:26] So nobody wants to live on a prayer, nobody wants, you gave love a bad name.

[25:32] So like Bon Jovi to me is sort of like Aerosmith, it's sort of like in that realm of like you can say you don't like it, but it's sort of like guilty pleasure, corny rock and roll.

[25:43] It's fun being at a bar, singing, living on a prayer. Same way like sweet emotion and walk this way.

[25:51] But there's just something about the band themselves that's just always like, I don't know, I always felt they were like corny, you know, like cool dudes would play ACDC guns and roses, you know, Rob Zombie, you know Metallica, that was always seemed like, you know, like guys guys like rock.

[26:11] But like Aerosmith and like Bon Jovi, they always seemed like like rock that, I don't know, like posters were kind of into or just like, you know, I don't know, there's just something about them.

[26:23] They just like, like I always want to be Axeros, I would rather be Axeros and Bon Jovi because he just doesn't have the cool like rock star sort of persona.

[26:32] I mean, he just always seemed like it went like a nice guy, I guess. All right, what else is going on in Pimball guys? Let's see, I'm going on my list of my notes.

[26:41] So would you guys spend $3,520 on a single Pimball play field?

[26:52] Now just think about that for a minute, no Pimball machine, no parts, just a play field for $3,520.

[27:01] There is one for sale on Pinside that is a Indiana Jones new old stock play field that was purchased directly from Ron Kruseman.

[27:16] And it was said to be the only new old stock play field he'd ever seen. It's been clear coded and this was supposed to go into a high end restoration machine, but now you can buy that play field for $3,520.

[27:34] Exactly what this guy paid for it. What do you guys think of that? I mean, look, there are people out there that just collect play fields.

[27:43] There are people out there that want to do high end restorations and this might be of appeal to them. It is insane to think that a single piece of wood with no parts on it is worth that much.

[27:56] I mean, there's like, that's worth more than a lot of machines, right? What would the machine worth that this goes into?

[28:04] The problem with this sort of like new old stock mint pristine, you don't want to use it, right? You don't, you put it into a machine and then aren't you worried that like every single time the ball passes over that play field or takes a hop, you are literally like losing value on your $3,520 play field.

[28:26] And after like a year or so playing on it, it's going to look like every other like pretty nice, you know, restored Indiana Jones play field.

[28:34] So for the maybe for the play field collector guy, it's worth a lot. I know when I see some of these game rooms where people have play fields hanging from the ceilings all over the walls. Incredible. I'll say this though. I'll say this.

[28:49] I know of another play field that's rare than this thing because there's more than one of these out there, but I know one where like I think I got like one of the only ones.

[28:57] All right, enough said there. So let's go into highway pimp on alien. So there's still just this ongoing refund issue that won't go away. We'll talk about it weekly.

[29:12] I think what's happening with alien is this. I think you've got a few of the guys in there who are really supporting the company. That's cool. And there's people championing the machine.

[29:22] I think people are finally starting to ultimately come to the realization that these new investors sort of bid off more than they could chew.

[29:33] And they inherited a company that was in far worse condition than Andrew highway indicated. And you know, there's absolutely probably no way these guys can see a path forward to profit.

[29:49] So then the question becomes if they don't feel like they can get to somewhere where they can make a profit. How long are they going to stick it out?

[30:00] And it seems like the strategy is going to be this that they're going to try and announce game number three at Texas Pimball Festival. And they're going to try and use that announcement to drum up sort of like a new chapter or start a new chapter in the company.

[30:17] Here's the problem with that. And I'm going to talk more about this when I go on Ryan and Marty's show. We're actually going to do the show where we talk about what we think is going to happen next year. But I'll spoil it now for you.

[30:29] The problem is this. If they showcase whatever they talk about Barry all flyers. I can't say it's nothing. Barry O's game. Whatever they say it is. Whatever they say it is. It's probably designed.

[30:42] But how far or how long is it going to take for that machine actually to go into production knowing all the issues they face with alien?

[30:54] Are they going to keep the same platform that Andrew highway put in place that isn't the easiest for them to manufacture?

[31:01] Are they going to still call the company highway Pimball? I mean how long are they going to hold on to this guy's name that creates nothing but sort of ill will within the community?

[31:13] And I don't think they're going to win any points. I really don't because I think they're going to rock up. I think they're going to like trying drum up excitement for this title.

[31:22] And then I think they're going to like be next to like Stern with like real machines that are shipping they're going to be next to

[31:29] PPS that's probably going to show like cactus Canyon that you can have in a couple months. There's going to be like you know Jersey jacks going to be probably shipping prior to the Caribbean around that.

[31:37] And I think these companies that you know maybe four years ago three years ago they could they could get people excited by just showing very little

[31:49] and trying to get people to fall in love with their intentions. And now the market is completely shifted.

[31:56] And people will only give a shit if stuff is real and stuff is now they will only give a shit if stuff is actually like in production.

[32:04] And they will not give you a dime until they feel confident that you can produce this machine and produce it when you say you're going to produce it.

[32:13] And you know the last company people are going to sink money into is highway pinball. I mean the one guy on pinside that it just this is to me this is like the thing that they need to figure out.

[32:25] There is a guy on there who paid in full for both full throttle and alien and they haven't even sent him full throttle.

[32:36] Like at some point at some point whoever these new investors are have to be like we need to at least get the guy game one that he paid for so many years ago.

[32:48] Isn't there a full throttle Ellie somewhere in the world like does Andrew highway even have one. If anything just be like Andrew we're taking your game back from you.

[32:56] We need to send it to this customer sorry we'll give him a discount and here's full throttle Ellie I know it's not new in box but we had one in our vault and you can have it.

[33:07] You know settle up with the dude instead he's you know the guys got a thread like counting the days he's hasn't got a refund.

[33:15] And they have nobody to blame but themselves you know they if these guys are so smart at business they clearly clearly didn't see what they were getting themselves into.

[33:28] And they might be right now they might be saying shit it would have been financially more beneficial to just declare banks rupsy and let this thing collapse.

[33:40] Then do what we're doing now but I get as I said I think it's a it's 100% it's a pride play that they're going through it's all pride driving it.

[33:50] But you know I think it's going to be really really hard for highway pinball moving forward and you know they need to get aliens out and they need to get them out in volume.

[34:01] But it's just really hard with all these other machines shipping now to drum up new interest.

[34:08] You know we haven't heard much from Dutch pinball they're still off trying to figure out how to make this game in China.

[34:15] You know I you know I think they they'll probably figure something out I do I don't think we're never going to see the big Lebowski again.

[34:25] But I just don't think the interest is going to be there anymore for these titles.

[34:32] I would love to see Dutch come up with another title as well. I do think they came at pinball in a really amazing way.

[34:41] I mean think about this is their first title ever and this is a great machine great theme integration.

[34:47] Lot of creativity, lot of imagination. We need more of that in pinball. We need more of that.

[34:52] And Dutch you know for for all their fuck ups. They don't have like a huge factory they don't have like overhead.

[35:02] You know so when they hit pause on making the big Lebowski they didn't have bills stacking up every month.

[35:09] The way Andrew highway did with his huge factory that made nothing.

[35:14] So that's the one silver lining and the one thing that I think should give people some hope is that these guys don't they you know they they the whole hasn't been increasing every month games haven't shipped.

[35:28] It's just they've just been able to hit pause on it. So if they can get games shipping I do think orders for the big Lebowski will will flood in I do.

[35:38] But only if games are in box and only if games are in America right no one's going to be waiting around.

[35:43] Speaking of America and inbox and shipping everyone's favorite pinball company home pin and everyone's favorite pinball leader Mike couldn't refuse chiming in again on pin side.

[36:00] Now a few like months ago Mike went out in a blaze glory said he was deactivating his account and wasn't going to post anymore on pin side.

[36:10] Okay. And he broke his promise and not only did he come back but he did something that only Mike really has the capacity to do.

[36:20] And that is stick his foot in his mouth once again and show everybody why home pin is probably probably looked at as the most missed managed company out there they definitely have the worst marketing and PR going on right now simply because they have an owner who doesn't give a shit like it's just this weird thing.

[36:48] It's like it's so strange to me like why do all the work and then treat people like you don't give a shit like you you really shouldn't ever it's just bad business it's not even about you know skeptics it's not even about like proving people wrong it's not even about being proud of your work.

[37:09] You just should never tell potential customers or potential markets to kind of like fuck off which is kind of what he's done I want to read what he wrote he wrote.

[37:22] We have organized a way to post updates fairly regularly on thunderbirds thread on a C.R.K.

[37:32] First of all like let's deconstruct this. He's organized the way to post up Mike it's just called posting updates like you haven't like solves there's never a difficulty in in in posting updates on a regular basis on a forum it's just called posting you figure out a schedule let's for say for example we're going to post every Friday an update on thunderbirds but I'm glad that he's organized away.

[38:01] He's making his own it was work like they came up with some clever solution to how forms work he then writes for those interested please check out that thread and by those interested I mean those who have a vested interest not random troublemakers who have no money down and no intention of buying a game.

[38:27] Mike at his finest right there he's basically saying if you don't have money in my product stay the fuck out of that thread if you're not going to buy one shut the fuck up is what he's saying to everybody and he knows all too well let me ask Mike one question Mike Mike at home pin I know you listen you gotta listen how could you not listen to the one podcast that calls you out Mike are you in on an alien.

[38:57] Were you in on an alien were you in on some of stern's machines then why did you go into those threats why did you go into highway pinball threads and talk so much shit all the time why did you go into other manufacturers threads and talk your shit and then you have the audacity to post stay out of my threat unless you're going to buy it total hypocrite look and Mike.

[39:27] I don't care if you want to go in and tell other people you think their product is rubbish and shit and what not and this is how it's done and you're not doing it right you revealed your machines the world and the unanimous feedback on it was it was a big piece of shit right now that needs a lot of changes and you heard the feedback and you're making those changes but that criticism is helping you make a better product.

[39:57] Now you could call all those people who are shitting on thunderbirds trolls and and someone doesn't need to be buying a game to have an opinion of a game there are enough people in this hobby that you know they want to play a game first formulate an opinion before they decide to put money down the only people who probably have money down on this game are just people who are obsessed with the thunderbirds.

[40:27] He then goes on the right I will not be posting updates here because there are no machines headed outside Australia and New Zealand for at least the next 12 months so there's no reason to post updates here it just doesn't apply.

[40:46] Once again there's Mike treating the internet like it has borders like countries like pin side is the world number one forum for pinball conversation.

[41:02] Okay let's without a doubt Robin as much as like I don't know why he still wants to ban me for life he's created the best pinball form in the world it is it is the go to place for people to converse to talk about pinball to get excited about pinball.

[41:23] To not post updates about a pinball machine that is new and entering the world on the site the world's largest site where pinball is discussed simply because you say you're not shipping it to anywhere other than Australia and New Zealand is absolutely idiotic and here's why there are a ton of people that are on pin side who live in Australia and New Zealand and there may be people there may be people.

[41:53] Hey Mike there may be people that you might just want to win over and win favor with so that if you do expand you're the they're waiting for you and they they're looking forward to buying your product but by treating it like and here's the dumb thing this is what's so stupid about his approach in update that is posted on Aussie arcade forum will just immediately make its way on to pin side by name.

[42:23] So it's the nature of how the internet works Mike information can't be siloed and contained to one site so it's absolutely idiotic that you would only want to have a dialogue on that site but no dialogue on pin side.

[42:41] So then closes off his statement with probably the most classic mic ism which is he says and I'm just reading word for word all you little trolls can crawl back into your holes and dream up some other rubbish to spout all sign out again now.

[43:03] I mean what is wrong with this guy like seriously like what what is wrong with him I just don't understand why they need to even like go into his own thread call people trolls tell them to shut up and then he's in a cowardly act admitting that he won't even engage and converse with people about his own product.

[43:32] And so I just really for the life of me don't understand this man I just don't I think he's he's now just got like everybody rooting against him he's I think people are saying that he's done it to nobody but himself and it's just silly it's silly because if what Ben heck is is true it said was true that he wants to be a red herring and just make pinball parts that go into other machines nobody's even going to want home pin made parts.

[44:02] In their machines like no one's gonna like if stars like we ain't to deal with home pin to supply parts people are like no like I don't want parts from that asshole so it's just of no benefit to have this negativity and this approach and pinball and I think it's kind of sad and I think Mike needs it might needs like someone who's like a close friend of his to be like dude you've got to just like stop you should apologize you need to like.

[44:32] When people over you're now a leader of a company you're now entering a marketplace that is highly competitive and every fan you have counts right and that's just where we're at with pinball nobody is safe nobody is safe you know I've been hearing some rumors I can't talk about on the show.

[44:54] But I think the financials at even the biggest pinball company I think there are like there are times when these companies are all going through you know difficult financial periods and I think people just assume this hobby is just going to be around all these big companies are going to survive forever.

[45:12] I'm not so sure I'm not so sure you know you know I saw the email from Jerry from P3 he sent out an email saying how there's like P3s and in five I think was like five continents or you know or countries I think was continents and all this and this and this and I said well Jerry how many did you sell how many do you sell.

[45:33] And so we were not we're not we're not disclosing numbers but he was disclosing numbers when he was talking about he was making like 25 at first and then 50 more you know like I nothing to be ashamed of if we we've made 50 so far and they're out and about like you know it's it's it's just it's really hard making pinball it's really hard we know the guys over to American pinball that they're planning to sell a lot of who deenies who deenies all location who deenie will be shipping soon.

[46:02] You know how many who deenies will they ship will they be able to ship enough to meet the numbers they're expecting and if they don't what is that say what does that mean for American pinball right well are they just going to stick it out you need to make a profit in this hobby you know is Jersey Jack in the green.

[46:21] You know I don't know you know there there's a lot of rumors that like the red they were in was really deep they have an investor who's I think a billionaire he might be able to float this forever but at some point at some point.

[46:37] You know nobody wants to lose money in business I do think there's still an untapped side of this hobby that I'm shocked nobody's going after and I'm I'm just I still think it's the high end collector is still not catered to properly nobody knows how to figure out how to cater to the high end collector if I was stern pinball I'm giving them free marketing advice right now I would follow.

[47:07] What they did with the SLE and I would have like stern platinum series I would make very very limited runs of your most desirable themes but really dress them up in a way that makes them unique makes them special and I think you would sell everyone you know I 800 bat star wars is stupid 80 batmans look how look how successful those 80 sold for you you know you don't you don't.

[47:35] You know the whole thing about like people making videos trying to beg to buy one all that stuff you know as much as people complain about that and had problems with it it worked and it when the people say like it upset people who did that upset because everyone I know who wanted one they engaged in that and they got one.

[47:57] I don't think there were many more than you know 80 legitimate buyers that price I would love to have a thread someone to start a pin sight thread who wanted a Batman super Ali that didn't get one can someone start that thread for canada if some here's a deal if somebody starts that threat on pin side who applied for Batman super Ali but didn't get one if it's just if you just start that threat I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to buy Hilton

[48:26] a really nice one hundred dollar hoodie to replace the one he has that he can wear moving forward to all the pinball show so that that a deal if I see that thread go up a hundred dollar hoodie will be purchased for Hilton and it will be dropped off at the pin side booth at T.P.F.

[48:47] you'll you'll see it there you won't be able to miss it it'll be at least a hundred dollar hoodie for Hilton if someone can start that thread for me all right I know it's I wonder if that goes up it they'll pull it down because we we know where this came from.

[49:02] So that's it you know I mean that's where we're at pinball exciting times lots of competition you know we haven't even talked about like Guardian I think that is a new code update we haven't talked about pirates you know and then we're going to do it.

[49:17] The reason why is you know a lot of a lot of what we know we just know and there's not always going to be like the level of news and updates around these games I think guardians is going to end up being one like a B title for Stern I just do I think people will enjoy it but it's not going to be the home run you know I do think my high-end collector idea for Stern is would work imagine this Stern says we're making only only

[49:48] 300 jaws pinball machines and they're twenty thousand dollars each okay before you like say Canadian your jerk you're trying to limit the amount of people who can like have fun with machines okay whatever dudes like they only make a certain number of law for our ease or 4GT's you know there are way more

[50:08] car enthusiasts with money who want a 4GT heck Ford is suing John Cena because he's selling his 4GT after he signed a contract that he couldn't sell it so just work with me here on this if they said we're going to make 300 jaws machines only 300 they're 20 thousand each do you or do you not think they sell everyone

[50:31] all right email me a Canadian pinball at gmail dot com with your answer I have a thousand listeners I'll get like three emails speaking of emails let's let's go to our mail because I feel like maybe I'll get more emails if I just read out what you guys say to me that I'm going to I'm

[50:52] closing the show with this stuff because I know when I used to listen to Nate Shaw used to love it when he would say can they dark Canada so let me read some stuff I've got my I'm going to go after the Robert Mueller email from deep root Jeff Adamson wrote the subject was remember I said like using J pop if you're deep root is like getting Matt Lauer to be a new anchor on a new network he wrote

[51:20] like starting a new talk show with Matt Lauer as the host right up there with doing donuts on Hilton's front lawn one of the funniest things you've ever said in the analogy is quite appropriate well Jeff thank you I did think it was a good analogy I think working with J pop is a silly silly thing to do and I don't think anything good will come of it David Falgran David thank you for being a listen to can he just pinball podcast

[51:50] David wrote congratulations on the Batman 66 looks forward to seeing what you did and listening to your shows after you have a functioning pen you enjoy I finally played a Guardians of the galaxy the voices are a distraction why have a license when you can't have the right voices it's like watching loony tunes without Mel Bunk it's distracting at one point I drained a ball because I looked up at the screen to figure out what I was doing

[52:20] I was thinking about who the hell was talking over overall it has some good shots and I would play it on location quick geography lesson Schaumberg this is the place in Chicago where 257 is it's 30 minutes from Chicago and 10 minutes from Stern and American pinball

[52:40] okay level 257 is owned by midway and is named after the final level in Pac-Man it's a high end mall arcade with bowling and craft beer I will be there on the 15th after watching the new Star Wars with my pack of geeks

[52:56] well Dave thank you enjoy Star Wars thank you for the history lesson on level 257 I kind of realize that because I was looking at pictures of Houdini being dropped off there and there's like this big Pac-Man statue

[53:09] I think it's a cool name for for an arcade

[53:12] Gardens the galaxy voices. They're just gonna be what they are right. I think a lot of people are are just you know sort of down and out on it because of the voices

[53:22] You know, I don't know I think there's too many games with good integration that the games with bad integration

[53:30] Are are really undesirable if that's the right word

[53:35] So I think yeah, I think it was not the right license to go after because of the restrictions

[53:41] All right, I got an email from Brett and Brett said hey Chris good show just acquiring about the Batman elite so Brett

[53:49] I let Brett know where it was. I'm not sure if he's the buyer or not. I got two emails

[53:56] From people about Batman. I got an email from

[54:01] From David

[54:03] Fowl Grant did I already read one from David hold on a second. I did

[54:08] So he said something else about remakes and something about comic book remakes

[54:16] He says the attack from Mars Ellie is the only one I think is worth buying and that's because the improvements are awesome

[54:22] Something else to consider below is my X-Men number one. It's beat up and not even close to mint

[54:29] Under that is an X-Men reprint

[54:32] Which is which is worth like?

[54:35] So one is worth $1,000 and one is worth two dollars. Okay, so here's the deal and I get what he's doing here, right?

[54:43] remakes versus the originals and in almost all other collector sort of hobbies

[54:50] The remake is worth nothing compared to the original

[54:54] You know and like Dave I appreciate you sharing the comic example the same is true with like baseball cars the same is true with

[55:02] Transformer toys, you know

[55:05] Original new-in-box Optimus Prime can be worth thousands of dollars a remake might only do worth a couple hundred

[55:11] I just think there's a ginormous difference

[55:14] between those kinds of things and

[55:18] Pimball machines

[55:20] And there just is because

[55:22] You know even it's just hard to explain it's like

[55:27] Part of what makes like a comic book

[55:31] From the original year came out

[55:33] Part of it is just like

[55:37] You know, it's I mean it's like it's like even hard to even find the words why right like why I don't know

[55:43] It's like the collector world is kind of crazy when you try and sit down and deconstruct it

[55:47] Why is an Optimus Prime toy that's exactly the same?

[55:50] Why is the fact that like one box that just is a little bit different make the thing worth thousands more?

[55:57] And I think it's just this I think it's because that is the thing the original is the one that

[56:05] Was actually in a toy store in

[56:08] 1986 and that is the car that was in the dealership in 1968

[56:14] Right and that is the car that like Carol Shelby actually worked on and that is the car

[56:20] That

[56:22] Or you know, or that is the comic book that like Stanley like drew and it was available like that this this actual thing is survived like 60 years

[56:33] The only reason I don't think it holds as true for Pimball and I just don't is

[56:39] You know older Pimball machines like to have a lot of issues

[56:43] Finding one in good shape costs a lot of money. You can actually make it play exactly the same and also it's just this like

[56:50] People don't really give a shit if you have like the original machine that like

[56:55] like

[56:56] Has the George Ferris art or like Dennis Norman like that came out in 90 like three would Dennis or him and does it like no

[57:03] No one really gives you shit like the people that do give a shit isn't enough but millions of kids

[57:10] Ripped open original transformers like millions of car enthusiasts want the original the problem Pimball is you only have like a

[57:19] Few thousand collectors that really care. It's not enough. It's not enough

[57:24] But again like it's it's the collector world is really wonky and weird, you know, I get it like you could argue this thing both ways

[57:33] Got an email from someone asking about my toad in and

[57:37] Got another email from a guy John Robinson asking about Batman. He found one locally for 11,500

[57:46] So thank you for the notes guys. I'll read more of your your news or your news

[57:51] I will read more of your emails if you send them to me

[57:54] Well, we can start making that more of a recurrent thing on the show. I hope you enjoy this. I hope you have a good weekend

[58:00] the next time we talk

[58:02] Who knows I might have some

[58:04] Some Batman

[58:06] Sort of reviews up for you guys. I'm not sure I'm trying to figure out like when I get this thing

[58:11] So I'll talk to you guys soon have a great weekend and we'll be back

[58:15] Probably Monday or Sunday. We don't know if something breaks we might have some news

[58:19] But I doubt it keep flipping

[58:46] Won't see you

[58:48] No

[58:56] I'll see you again

[59:03] When I
