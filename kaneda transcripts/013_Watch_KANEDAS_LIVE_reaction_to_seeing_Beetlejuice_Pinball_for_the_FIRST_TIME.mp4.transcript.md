[01:33] Got my Manhattan mix in here.

[01:37] Hear that?

[01:38] Yes, some more.

[01:41] Man, we've been waiting for this game for,

[01:43] I feel like we know about this game for a couple of years,

[01:45] but the time is now.

[01:48] The place is here.

[01:50] The hype is big.

[01:53] The expectations are up here.

[01:57] Let's do this.

[01:59] Mm.

[02:04] Oh, man.

[02:05] Manhattan's hit.

[02:08] The hit hard.

[02:10] How are you gonna give away the five?

[02:12] Man, I don't know yet.

[02:13] I really don't know yet.

[02:15] I do not know yet.

[02:17] I will figure that out.

[02:19] And I will,

[02:22] you know, I will, I will do something.

[02:24] You know me, I'm gonna be creative about it.

[02:25] It's not just gonna be your ordinary, do this.

[02:29] It's gonna be something where we make each one a moment.

[02:32] Now, they're gonna be butter cabinet.

[02:35] They're gonna be fully optioned.

[02:37] Everything, everything.

[02:39] This is not a time for,

[02:43] for a half measures.

[02:45] It's a time, if you want a Canadian edition,

[02:47] you're getting everything.

[02:48] The bells and the whistles end the bells.

[02:53] Oh, man.

[02:54] Well, look,

[02:55] I think, look, I just gotta say this.

[02:57] I just gotta say this.

[02:58] Carrie going in front of me with exactly my idea,

[03:01] is that what he did?

[03:02] Did he, did you watch him watch the trailer?

[03:04] Did he take exactly my idea?

[03:10] It is what it is, man.

[03:12] Like, I don't know.

[03:13] Like, it's fun.

[03:14] I think he's Carrie and I'm Canada

[03:17] and having two people see it at the same time is fun.

[03:22] Carrie and Kendra both live with their first impressions,

[03:26] had to pick Canada.

[03:29] Look, everyone's gonna have their first impressions gag.

[03:33] I mean, I think it's great.

[03:34] And don't worry, I'm gonna take these glasses off.

[03:36] I know Bug is probably like, what are you doing?

[03:38] We're not, you're not gonna get the reflection

[03:41] of the trailer and these glasses.

[03:42] This is just to make them nervous a little bit.

[03:47] But I'm excited, bro.

[03:49] I'm excited.

[03:50] This game is like really about to do something

[03:55] I think magnetimists tomorrow.

[03:57] I think there is a moment here

[04:00] that we've all been waiting for.

[04:02] There is a sort of a craving for something

[04:08] to make us feel the magic we know is possible in Kimball.

[04:13] We know a game that had to tell feels like passion

[04:18] detail and just like enthusiasm and a team effort

[04:23] and a family effort, just feeling it, feeling it.

[04:29] You know, over at Stern, they're putting out pancakes.

[04:33] This is Kimball, baby.

[04:35] This is Kimball.

[04:36] Stern's been releasing pancakes for $13,000.

[04:39] You know, the history is amazing.

[04:41] Stern told Franchit of pack his bags.

[04:43] Now look at where he's at.

[04:44] Look at who's got the mojo.

[04:47] The Stern art stuff, the last few Stern art games.

[04:52] Leaving everything to be desired.

[04:55] Leaving everything to be desired.

[04:57] And don't worry, Luke, I'm taking these glasses off

[04:59] when we do it.

[05:00] We're not, and we're going to give people a few minutes

[05:01] to get in here, get in the house, get a drink,

[05:03] pour a cocktail.

[05:06] Pour a cocktail.

[05:07] Let's see this game, baby.

[05:09] I also want to thank the Spooky Family

[05:11] for sending me the feature at video.

[05:14] So what I plan to do is watch it after this.

[05:19] And then we record a podcast, maybe tonight,

[05:22] maybe tomorrow morning, but like, man, it's just,

[05:25] this is like the cats not just out of the bag.

[05:28] The bag is out of the building.

[05:29] The building is out of the country.

[05:30] The country is out of the universe, man.

[05:32] This is the game.

[05:33] This is the game we've been waiting for.

[05:37] You're not worried about that.

[05:38] You want to, Luke, do you want me to keep these glasses on

[05:40] and you want the reflection from Canada's glasses?

[05:43] I thought you want me to take them off.

[05:44] I mean, I'm happy to keep them on.

[05:46] It just makes the room dark.

[05:59] You know, I think everyone's going to have

[06:02] like one hell of a day tomorrow.

[06:04] I mean, the Spooky folks put a couple of million back

[06:07] in the bank, baby.

[06:08] Put a couple of million in the bank.

[06:11] You know, at an extension to that house,

[06:14] order that Corvette, ZR1X, you guys deserved it.

[06:18] Ain't no socialist over there in Benton.

[06:20] We got some real hard work in Americans building

[06:24] a relationship with this pinball community,

[06:27] making us all feel special like we're part of something,

[06:30] part of their family, part of their organization.

[06:33] I'd rather be part of an organization

[06:37] versus being shoveled the SHI T

[06:41] we're getting over there at Stern these days.

[06:43] They know it.

[06:44] Like, we're walking dead code.

[06:46] Yeah, yeah.

[06:47] What do you think we're going to see tomorrow?

[06:49] Not walking dead code.

[06:50] No one's going to care.

[06:51] No one's going to care.

[06:52] This is it, baby.

[06:54] This is it.

[06:55] Now, look, I'll let the Spooky guys decide whether or not.

[06:58] Like, here, let me do this.

[07:00] Let me pull up a video on YouTube

[07:03] and like you tell me if you think like you can see enough.

[07:06] Let's do guns and roses.

[07:10] How about this?

[07:12] So can you see enough in my glasses?

[07:19] You guys want to see the black glasses, yeah.

[07:22] But like, I'm going to tell you right now,

[07:24] like if you want, like, what this is.

[07:30] Just enough.

[07:31] You can do it.

[07:35] It's spookies golf.

[07:38] This is the best word.

[07:46] I have not watched the video.

[07:48] I have not watched the video.

[07:49] I swear on the mother's skull on like children's skulls.

[07:53] I have not watched the video.

[07:56] I haven't seen everybody today.

[08:00] I'm not watching the video until I do this.

[08:02] I want all of you to get my mischievous reaction to this thing.

[08:08] So I can keep these glasses on or I can put them on.

[08:21] I'm going to have to shoot them.

[08:22] I love it.

[08:25] Now, how does it look today?

[08:27] Better say.

[08:28] 49.

[08:31] Take it.

[08:32] I'll take it.

[08:35] All right.

[08:36] It's a matter of.

[08:38] The love reflection.

[08:39] We're not allowed.

[08:40] I just get this good.

[08:41] We good here, we good here, guys.

[08:44] Okay, I think we're good.

[08:46] I think we're good.

[08:47] I've got the video teed up.

[08:49] It's not five o'clock yet.

[08:52] Audio has a fair bit of echo.

[08:55] All right, you know why?

[08:58] Because it's.

[09:00] It's you're hearing the audio.

[09:03] I'll turn my mic around so you can.

[09:07] Here, let's test it.

[09:08] How's this sound?

[09:09] It's just sound better.

[09:10] Ready?

[09:10] Hold on.

[09:21] That better.

[09:25] Yes, sure.

[09:43] I'm doing the original thing.

[09:48] There, there's a way.

[09:54] I'm excited.

[10:01] This is probably black.

[10:09] I like the ear at once.

[10:14] I want you to hear me and my reaction first versus the trailer music.

[10:20] This is about Jackass.

[10:24] This is about my reaction.

[10:27] Can I have a minute?

[10:31] Can I be the focal point for once on my own damn channel?

[10:39] What are my chances of...

[10:41] I thought it's 70.

[10:43] I don't know.

[10:44] Well, the audio is good now because I'm not playing guns and roses in the background.

[10:49] How many people got?

[10:50] We did 86 on Facebook and 82.

[10:52] We have 162 people.

[10:56] How's everybody doing?

[10:58] Should we do it?

[10:59] Should we go?

[11:00] Let's give people five minutes.

[11:01] We're going to go like 505.

[11:03] That's fair.

[11:04] Because people are telling people right now the world is watching me watch this.

[11:10] The world is watching 162 people.

[11:12] I will say the world is watching right now.

[11:15] The world is watching 162 people.

[11:20] I can't believe I'm watching this.

[11:24] Why don't we make Star Wars and mess it up again?

[11:28] Turn your mic up.

[11:30] Why don't you go over to YouTube on Facebook.

[11:34] I don't get it.

[11:35] You guys are late.

[11:37] Come on.

[11:39] It sounds great on YouTube, right?

[11:43] What's that?

[11:45] Is my mic out?

[11:50] What's the matter?

[11:51] Do you want more ice cream?

[11:52] I get a million more ice cream.

[11:54] Where's your bowl?

[11:56] Bring it upstairs.

[31:21] Like they it just feels like a pinball moment. That's just so cool

[31:32] For those of you who are in on this game, I mean I

[31:37] Think you're gonna love it like

[31:39] Is there like a a mechanism this game that's like as impressive? I don't even know what is an impressive mech anymore in pinball

[31:48] But if I look at like jaws and I look at Star Wars and Venom and D&D and this and that like I look at ghost busters this game

[31:59] looks like

[32:01] It's right out of a Valley Williams period game and

[32:07] I think everyone's gonna be very very happy with it. This game is 9,999 dollars

[32:14] There's more going on in this game for sure

[32:18] Then then Harry Potter now look I'm not taking anything away from Potter

[32:24] I look it's still spooky man like I still think and I mean this when I say this I still think Harry Potter CE

[32:32] Is it is still a level above this even like I like I gotta be honest game like it but it's $15,000 Harry Potter CE

[32:40] It should be a little bit a level above it should be it's 50% more money

[32:47] You know like like

[32:48] But this is what's so exciting now about pinball is

[32:53] Everyone's giving you these beautiful options Winchester this

[32:59] Potter

[33:00] The games that nobody wants now are the Stern games

[33:05] Stern needs to punch back and I'm telling you right walking dead does not punch back against this it just doesn't

[33:13] It just doesn't like I just

[33:16] How is the display?

[33:18] They don't really show the display too much in this video because they don't there's not like

[33:24] I'm trying to like go back and see the game from a distance because

[33:30] All right, so I'm looking at the display right now

[33:35] It's got I mean like the is that a camera

[33:41] No, I think that's the I think that's a lock

[33:51] The I mean just Frances artwork. I mean, Frances you son of a bitch

[33:56] You son of it. I'm looking at this game from a distance now this like it starts off with the from a distance it it

[34:02] The top or just you know, it's like beetle juice as the snake with the rattletail is just insane this game from the distance

[34:10] It's just like like I hate you, Frances. I hate what you've done here. You've made

[34:17] This game is beautiful. It's just it's just it's just I don't usually curse. I don't usually curse, but I'm cursing a little bit

[35:21] Just too long I gotta be honest. I'm not selling guns and roses

[35:28] What I'm gonna do with it is

[35:31] Story I don't want to play it anymore. I don't I want my kids to play it in like 16 years, but I don't want to play it anymore

[35:40] I just don't want to play gnr anymore. I don't even know what playing gnr is anymore

[35:44] I don't even know what like you don't have to say like I literally have no desire to play guns or roses ever

[35:51] anymore

[35:53] And I and look I it's just not a I'm not gonna sell it either because I want my kids to enjoy it one day and like I think

[36:02] I think 10 years from now 20 years from now guns and roses will still be like the C's will still I don't know

[36:54] But it looks like it flows great looks like it's a little bit of a

[36:58] Van layout with a little bit of an upper left upper flipper region

[42:18] You know, it's funny gang is oh yeah, should I pinball life? Should I should I raffle these off for like 80,000 dollars a game

[42:28] And then file a like what what do they file like their their taxes and all the sudden it's like no one wants to

[42:33] like I gang I'm not even gonna get on this road, but like

[42:37] literally

[42:38] The amount of pinball pinball life makes more money than anybody in pinball. They make more money than bug and loot

[42:44] They put the games in the hospitals and they own the games they own the games

[42:50] They like literally like they didn't donate the game to the hospital bro

[42:54] Let me slow they get the they're making two and have three times with the game's worth and nobody wants to question any of that

[43:01] I'm just saying man. I'm just saying man like

[43:08] Like it's just something about it just doesn't seem right

[43:12] And I remember when Ken Cromwell did that big fundraiser for project pinball

[43:18] Does that pinball life for project pinball?

[43:20] He did that big fundraiser to raise all that money and then all of a sudden when you start out where the money go

[43:26] Like will he walk us didn't go into those hospitals?

[43:29] pre-owned games

[43:31] All that money goes to maintaining them maintaining games in a children's hospital

[43:37] How much money does that cost?

[43:41] I'm just saying people don't don't get me drinking talking about some of these these fundraisers

[43:48] Cut you got you guys never ask these questions

[43:59] Some show games are gonna be shipped to district. They're all going to districts

[44:03] Bro, they're all being sold tomorrow. You ain't gonna see a epic show game out of show

[44:06] You're not gonna see a show game out of show

[44:10] Like like gang wake up

[44:13] I love bug and loot but come on they they they hand at these districts like another like four games here five games there because they all complain

[44:23] That's that's what those show games are what's the point of a show game of a game that sold out what what to

[44:28] To help the show

[44:30] Like like

[44:32] Spooky didn't even show up to expo

[44:34] They didn't even show up to expo bro

[44:36] They didn't even show up to expo gap was there with six evil deads for sixteen thousand dollars and they sold the F out

[44:44] Where the where those the show games? No, those were serial numbered evil dead games. They were not show games

[44:53] Show games at pinball to be. Yeah, sure fizzy sure see how long those games are turned on

[44:58] I'll tell you this if I if I run into a show game out of show. I'm sitting there for a thousand plays over three days

[45:05] Put a thousand plays on it

[45:08] Reward you know, I got patreon subscribers who actually think that they should get a game because they pay more a month

[45:17] You know, you know this this is what the Manhattan's doing you want me to get another drink in Manhattan

[45:20] And this is like I just start like saying stuff that's like truth serum

[45:24] But I literally have people that think because they spend more a month on my patreon that they should get one of the five games

[45:35] When did I say that was how I was doing things

[45:39] Because here's what's funny to me is like

[45:41] Bro like you could give a hundred bucks a month for five years this game still worth more than that

[45:48] Oh

[45:52] Okay, so it's said people have been on at the longest

[45:55] No, but like I don't I don't I don't I don't think that's fun like it's you know what I'm saying like to just

[46:04] Like to give them a way to because even then the problem tilt with that is I've had way more than five people joined right away

[46:13] You know, so like then I have to go through like

[46:16] You know splitting hairs to no, we're gonna do something like I should literally just like who can ever do the most pull-ups

[46:23] Like one game goes to the person you can do the most pull-ups

[46:26] Like I think I should just announce Neil Neil McRae is not winning that game

[46:29] Right we know this

[46:34] He's he's test driving his 15 million euro boat

[46:38] Oh

[46:42] Are you gonna start charging for memes no

[46:45] Should we get out of the drink let me get another drink let's do this let's do this no long day having slept

[47:08] Oh

[47:19] Oh man

[47:29] Uh, what is this

[47:34] What the heck's going on with my computer

[47:38] Um, I

[47:40] Mean I will say not even not even race. I think if you can beat me in Street Fighter 2 that would be a way to win a machine

[47:47] I think we do that at one of the shows

[47:50] Look gonna have these five games. They're gonna be shipped from spooky to a lucky buyer

[47:57] They're gonna have butter cabinets the top or the whole nine yards

[48:02] Please describe all of the play field

[48:05] Do you guys want me to describe the play field or do you want to do you want to see it for yourself tomorrow?

[48:10] Because I sometimes feel like

[48:52] Yeah, the top is the beetle snake

[48:54] Now

[48:58] Now I'm gonna let me open up now in my um Gmail

[49:02] The feature read by Zach I'm just gonna open it. I just want to see like

[49:08] Um

[49:10] Okay

[49:11] It's a huge file so it will take a while to download okay

[49:18] Okay

[49:21] Let's see how big it is it is

[49:25] 17 gigabytes

[49:28] It's gonna take 15 minutes to download

[49:31] I can't wait to watch it

[49:36] Um

[49:38] If anyone's like in Connecticut wants to drive over I'll show you the trailer

[49:43] Like you're gonna say I'll show you the trailer

[49:48] um

[49:49] Can I let me let me

[49:52] One thing I wish this game did have because I it's an evil dead and maybe this just I

[49:58] I

[49:59] I did I do miss having something on the apron

[50:04] You know, there's there's a couple cockroaches on the apron which you know I always get a little heebie

[50:09] Gb's by the cockroaches in Beetlejuice to begin with I just there's something about cockroaches

[50:13] I don't like I just don't like but there's a couple cockroaches on the apron

[50:16] I

[50:18] That tape player on the apron of evil dead I really like

[50:24] There's nothing on the apron that's interactive on this game

[50:28] Uh, I don't think it's gonna be a big deal. I would like there's so much there's there's like so much happening up north

[50:33] That's so much cooler anyway then apron stuff

[50:39] Um look I think the game

[50:43] looks super awesome and

[50:47] Let me let me not talk about what I think this game is gonna go for second-hand market tomorrow

[50:52] Okay, because like

[50:54] Those 70 games or they're they're they're they're gone and in five minutes two minutes

[51:02] I don't I don't even know like I don't even know like what the

[51:05] What what the eight people manning those phones because you think about like eight people man the phone

[51:10] They're gonna be gone and and they're already I don't know they're just gonna get begun so quick

[51:17] Um, I think that the second hand market on this game let me go back and market it again. I just every time I see my well, you know maybe

[51:28] Um

[51:30] That's not it

[51:42] Uh, I want to get back to the good day. I always want to really see the whole game

[51:52] Um

[52:00] I think um, I'm looking at it now

[52:10] I think second-hand tomorrow

[52:16] Five I think I think five over I think five over all day long

[52:22] Um, you know like as someone who's uh

[52:26] speculated and scout games before

[52:30] Tomorrow's gonna be a really frustrating day for a lot of people they get told no and they're gonna want one and just like five grand

[52:36] So some people means nothing

[52:39] I think this game's gonna end up being like with butter and topper. I just think this game's gonna end up settling around

[52:47] 15 grand 18 grand I mean it and again because I think like

[52:52] I'd rather have one beetle juice than two-stern premiums and and I look at it like that and then that's

[52:58] That's how I look at it um, you know 500 walking dead Ali remastered

[53:05] feels somewhat like

[53:10] man, what is going on here?

[53:14] I don't know if like it just kicked me out or not. Okay, my computer's doing weird stuff. Um

[53:21] I just think five over

[53:25] 999

[53:27] you

[53:31] Robert that makes no sense

[53:33] Robert like why did people say this spooky doesn't want to make one game for three years like again gang

[53:40] I'm being very honest here like there's not like a mech in this game that's blowing me away

[53:46] I just being honest like do you know what I'm saying? I'm not seeing a

[53:52] medieval madness castle mech. I'm not seeing a

[53:56] uh theater of magic trunk. I'm not seeing a toad in disappearing magnet. There's not like a

[54:03] whoa did you see the ball do that because of that mech

[54:09] It's more than some of the parts

[54:11] It's it's a world under glass. It's a world under glass

[54:15] It looks like everything the shoot is really fun. It just it's just like that's kind of what we want and like it does have like

[54:21] I will say the the worm

[54:23] The worm mech is the wow mech in the game and it it looks like it does like two three things

[54:29] Um, it's got drop targets. It's it's like a scoop. It's got more targets at the bottom of it

[54:34] It looks super cool and the way it like moves with the music and with the callouts. It's it's

[54:40] That's gonna be your wow mech in this game

[54:49] um i um

[54:52] Yeah, no, I'm um, I'm I'm like very happy for these guys right now

[55:00] I think pinball is about to take a turn down a different road

[55:05] You know, I've been in this hobby for over 12 years and I I've watched so many games come out

[55:11] I've seen so many beautiful jersey jack games that were boring and sterile

[55:17] I've seen so many stirring games that wowed me

[55:20] I I think sturns best years are behind them

[55:24] And that's the thing I think spooky's best years are in front of them

[55:29] I think barrels is best years are in front of them. I think jjps best years are in front of them

[55:34] I think dutch's best years are in front of them

[55:37] And if if I look at this hobby and totality

[55:40] I want to be on those trains. I want to be on those

[55:44] Those those rides where the best years are in front of them

[55:48] Does anybody actually think the best years of sturn pinball are in front of sturn pinball

[55:54] theme wise

[55:56] price wise value wise leadership wise

[56:01] And that's what it comes down to

[56:04] This game is in this game is like such a beautiful game for a beautiful company at a beautiful time

[56:13] Winchester same thing for barrels beautiful game for a beautiful company at a beautiful time

[56:18] There's so radically different, but they're so cool in their own aspects

[56:23] Um, I'll say this right now. I mean like I'm very impartial

[56:29] I think barrels fit and finish

[56:33] Might even be a level above spookies

[56:36] Just from like certain things, you know spookies got like their pain it like

[56:41] Have a trails and this it's like kind of like their kind of signature the look

[56:47] They're close. They're close

[56:50] But like when I sometimes when I look at a dune machine with that alternate translet's gorgeous

[56:56] But spooky man like this game is just I don't know it doesn't make me

[57:01] Feel like it's lacking anything

[57:04] They need to stop using surfers

[57:08] um

[57:10] I don't disagree with that

[57:12] Harry Potter C is is absolutely stunning. I look I don't like the unlimited run of Harry Potter C's

[57:20] You know, I told us to Brett when I saw my ex pro I don't like

[57:24] I get that you did it

[57:27] But you also in essence are destroying your own like collectability

[57:34] You know what I'm saying when 3000 Harry Potter C's are made

[57:38] Welcome to $10,000 Harry Potter C.E. Land

[57:43] I don't like that. I don't I don't like it. I think it's it's it's weird to have the most expensive model be the most

[57:51] Like like like the most amount of them out there

[57:57] Well, you know like the thing is this I understand too that like a lot of people that buy Harry Potter are just never gonna sell it

[58:05] They're just never gonna sell it

[58:08] You

[58:14] You guys got me drinking some in Addings now like now the truth serum is out

[58:18] You know franches on back to the future to this you guys know this right

[58:22] The dude's doing back to the future

[58:24] And like

[58:25] Like seriously this year is gonna be bookend by a January franche beetle juice and an October franche back to the future

[58:34] Sterns

[58:36] I don't want to say the word sturns

[58:39] Budged

[58:41] Stern is fudged and franche is gonna fudge them

[58:46] It's funny. It's like the irony in all of it is franche is gonna fudge them

[58:50] And you know Jeremy's not gonna talk me ever again. It seems I ruined his family. I don't know

[58:56] I don't know I I ruined people's families because I say I don't like the I don't like two art packages on two games. He didn't do

[59:02] I

[59:04] Can't say that now can't say that

[59:18] Well

[59:21] Yeah, I mean I I demand all of my stern uh text to come at 1242 am

[59:32] Okay, you know it's interesting about the Pokemon poll I put up majority of people don't want it

[59:40] majority of people don't want it. It's not about compensation man. It's about peace of mind

[59:46] How many times have I told you guys this the real measure in life of success is how many days you wake up in a good mood

[59:53] How do you think bug and Luke are waking up tomorrow a few more million in the bank?

[59:58] How do you think Donald Garrison's waking up tomorrow?

[01:00:02] Tired, but feeling good, right?

[01:00:05] How do you think um

[01:00:06] Canate is waking up tomorrow feeling good? How do you think Jeremy Packer is waking up tomorrow? He's not feeling good

[01:00:11] So it doesn't matter if they pay him quarter million a half a million a million. It doesn't matter. He stressed the f out

[01:00:20] and like

[01:00:22] like

[01:00:24] His opportunity

[01:00:26] to win people back

[01:00:28] I

[01:00:30] Don't even know if it's on Pokemon. I have a hard time feeling that Pokemon with all of its artists

[01:00:36] I don't think Jeremy's gonna illustrate that game. I don't know. Maybe he is. I don't know

[01:00:41] But again, like he's not Jeremy's not the poke. I don't know. I don't know. Even though it's going on soon

[01:00:45] I really don't I've sort of like lost

[01:00:49] I've lost the narrative on Stern's

[01:00:52] You know here's the feature at it's 38 minutes. Zach. Many you son of a bitch

[01:01:06] I'm not gonna play it

[01:01:09] This is the battle

[01:01:20] You gotta save my name

[01:01:23] Watching it grow up

[01:01:25] Want to cigarette?

[01:01:28] Trying to cut down my cell

[01:01:39] I

[01:01:44] Personally pretty big fan of Beatles you said was you know, I loved it watching it growing up

[01:01:48] It was one of my favorite movies growing up. So

[01:01:51] Okay, I'm not gonna watch it now, but I can't wait to watch it. I think the feature ads just gonna

[01:01:58] Uh, just make everybody want one and nobody can have one

[01:02:04] I

[01:02:07] Um, I think Stern has sucks since Sega days. Okay. Well, that's stupid thing to say

[01:02:14] To say Surnas sucks since the Sega days is stupid. It made some of the best pinball in the history of pinball

[01:02:19] If not the best pinball collected like come on guys like

[01:02:22] Valley Williams has a few good games Stern has wait. There's way better Stern machines than Valley Williams machines

[01:02:28] So so let's just not say stupid stuff. Let's give credit what credit to do

[01:02:34] Well, like I um

[01:02:39] You know, I've heard this a few times from people that for their own personal sanity they they need to avoid me

[01:02:46] Um, hmm

[01:02:49] I'm behind the paywall. I speak to a few people on Facebook once a week and that's it. It's really easy to avoid me

[01:02:57] Uh, Lord of the Rings is a masterpiece. Everybody knows that

[01:03:03] Everybody knows that

[01:03:06] All right here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna for you guys on uh you guys on Facebook

[01:03:09] I'm just gonna go only to youtube now. So like if you're on Facebook

[01:03:14] By the way, thanks for the 3000 stars who gave these stars. Let's see uh, we've got

[01:03:20] Mark Thornton. Thank you for

[01:03:23] And Mark Thornton gave all the stars and so so much

[01:03:27] Mark Thornton. Thank you for your 3000 stars. I really appreciate it like I was like who gave the 3000 he gave

[01:03:34] thousand three times

[01:03:36] Jerry me posted a comic book cover he did on team and team gezeva for some reason it wasn't overly saturated keeps the special sauce only for Stern

[01:03:47] Oh my god bill brand is is in the house

[01:03:50] um

[01:03:52] Billy Billy do you have a Billy did you get yourself a beetle juice

[01:03:58] Look gang again. I I want to be objective here

[01:04:03] This game just it's beautiful. It's it's it's it feels exactly what I kind of was expecting from spooky

[01:04:11] um, I'm surprised by the level of sculpts and

[01:04:15] 3d kind of

[01:04:17] World Underglass that is in this game. I I think what I love about this game is

[01:04:22] You're not gonna have to mod it to make it look right and I think um Stern and other people out there

[01:04:29] Are everyone's kind of now realizing this like

[01:04:32] It's gonna this is like the Winchester mansion in the back love it right that's I mean what these games really need are those 3d things that just feel

[01:04:44] Really like special in world under glass

[01:04:48] Yeah, Bill. I don't like anyone who slept on this game or getting one like makes no sense

[01:04:54] Yeah, Billy how many of these are you buying for how many of your houses or how many yachts you are you strapping one of these to your Ferrari and doing a

[01:05:00] Wealy and then driving to canadus house

[01:05:02] So the yeah, so the here's a problem with Stern. Here's the problem Stern is gonna have tomorrow

[01:05:08] The problem real simple for Stern tomorrow is that people are gonna put this next to

[01:05:12] Star Wars and they're gonna laugh their asses off

[01:05:15] And they're gonna put it next to walking dead with a stupid heads heads on the slingshots and they're gonna laugh their asses off

[01:05:25] You know Stern is like here's this for 13 and it looks like shit next to a game for nine

[01:05:31] And and the game and spooky's game for if you add up all the butter and the topper

[01:05:38] So for 13 spooky's gonna give you all this and Stern's still gonna give you a topperless game

[01:05:44] And those people are still over there scratching their silly heads wondering

[01:05:49] Why is he saying this stuff about because you guys are ripping us off Stern

[01:05:53] Stern your games are now with top-run accessories are like closer to 15,000 dollars. This game is nine

[01:06:00] 9, 9

[01:06:03] You're walking dead. They didn't like like that barn's not a sculpted barn

[01:06:11] It's still flat plastic

[01:06:23] Um, I yeah, I like what Winchester has I

[01:06:29] Do I like I like both of these games at this time

[01:06:33] Will this game make people like bail on their Winchester's I don't think so. I think they're so radically different

[01:06:40] I think they're so right you know the game that I still don't get excited about is predator like I just I don't know like I nothing in predator excites me

[01:06:50] Walking dead gameplay hey guys news flash walking dead gameplay was revealed 12 years ago

[01:06:58] You

[01:07:03] Walking dead gameplay has been out for 12 years. So what do you expect?

[01:07:08] It's walking dead's AI generated graphics revealed tomorrow

[01:07:14] Pfff

[01:07:16] Bito juice versus Potter for the trippy

[01:07:22] Um

[01:07:24] Yeah, um, you know Kelly that's a great that's a great

[01:07:28] Twippy battle

[01:07:30] I think for artwork

[01:07:32] It's gonna go to beetle juice. I think for mex it goes to beetle juice. I think for

[01:07:40] Layout it might go to Eric

[01:07:47] Metallica remastered

[01:07:49] Steven was done a lot better than the walking dead

[01:07:53] Yeah, I forgot evil dead is also

[01:07:56] Um, evil dead is also in the running for a trippy. What is a trippy? I don't know. I don't even know anymore

[01:08:07] I just want to say this I want to say this I as I have a few man had as the Manhattan courses through my veins

[01:08:16] I've got five beetle juice games. I don't know what to do with

[01:08:20] I don't know what to do with

[01:08:22] Do you guys want to see Brenda's impression first impression of this game when she comes through the door

[01:08:28] Do you want me to like?

[01:08:30] Do you guys want to hang on for a little bit? She'll be home in a little bit

[01:08:34] When Brenda comes through the door should we get an unbiased if you will opinion about this game

[01:08:39] So why don't we do that why don't we just I always hang out here

[01:08:43] I'll keep drinking Manhattan's

[01:08:46] Which will knock me the F out by

[01:08:48] 630

[01:08:50] Every three hours tonight we need to be up to give killian his pain medication. I will say he's doing really well the kids a champ

[01:08:59] You know, I um I want to be serious for a moment

[01:09:03] There's nothing harder for a parent

[01:09:06] Than to watch their child go into surgery at age four and a half ish

[01:09:13] Wake up and crying in pain. It was like really hard to

[01:09:17] To be in that room and Brenda sitting next to him and and he was just

[01:09:24] In a ton of pain and it was really um

[01:09:28] You know when you're a parent you'll do anything you can to

[01:09:32] Relieve the pain of your child

[01:09:35] You know as they get older the only way to relieve their pain is to not raise them to be Gen Z socialist stupid mother effus

[01:09:42] If you want to raise your kids not to be in pain as adults

[01:09:50] Don't raise them to be socialist and actually raise them to understand and respect family values

[01:09:59] I say this all the time we we I'm gonna go on a soapbox a little bit. We've now are living in a world

[01:10:05] We're like literally

[01:10:07] We're telling women that men suck

[01:10:10] You don't need a man

[01:10:12] You don't you don't need a man

[01:10:14] And yet when they do studies the happiest women have families and have children

[01:10:22] And same for the men a sense of purpose a sense of fulfillment a sense of creation

[01:10:31] I I can't tell you how much I love my life and when you know when when when people say

[01:10:37] Be it isn't buying of pins you I don't need I don't have a void in my life

[01:10:42] And I mean this when I say this went when people are buying like 15 20 30 pins. I'm like I don't understand that

[01:10:48] I don't understand that why would anybody need 30 pinball machines

[01:10:53] You're one individual you haven't even seen the end of any of those games a couple nice pins

[01:11:02] Set up in a beautiful house

[01:11:05] That what a pinball machine to me is like it's like a baby grand piano

[01:11:10] It's like the focal point of a room now you can make it the focal point of room or you can put so many in the damn room

[01:11:15] We're like now nothing special

[01:11:21] You know I um

[01:11:23] You know I was at a tome jazz last night my Japanese jazz run I like watching these kids like these these kids are like

[01:11:31] I don't know if they're like on dates

[01:11:33] I love the acronym for the last to speaking in an EDM BG

[01:11:38] Yeah, EDM BGS, but it um

[01:11:41] You know you watch these jenzy kids and like like literally the schools have taught them to be socialists

[01:11:46] Talked them to hate anybody you has money like like they literally think that

[01:11:51] people should

[01:11:53] Like tax

[01:11:55] Anyway, I'm not gonna get into this

[01:11:58] My point is this

[01:12:00] Do whatever makes you waking do whatever makes you wake up in a good mood

[01:12:05] As long as it's legal

[01:12:10] You have a bill you're loaded so bill bills like I got 30 pins bill like you're loaded bill bill you're loaded

[01:12:18] Can't take it with you

[01:12:20] But bill you're loaded like I like I get it bill

[01:12:26] But bill my point is

[01:12:28] That you would be just as happy with five games as you would with 30

[01:12:33] I know this for a backfill like you you barely play the games come on you know this though you're not like

[01:12:39] Like literally how could you even like enjoy 30 machines?

[01:12:44] It's like it doesn't make any sense you can enjoy 30 machines

[01:12:49] You can

[01:12:52] Now what bill needs to say to canator right now is

[01:12:58] Canator are you gonna get me one of those 88

[01:13:01] SLEs of back to the future

[01:13:05] So you so like you think this game was hard to get

[01:13:11] Um 88 SLEs of back to the future

[01:13:16] Guess who's gonna have a maybe some of those

[01:13:19] Guess who might be selling some pinball machines one day soon

[01:13:24] Let me show you guys a question you guys like I honestly have a whole system of like I think I can do my podcast

[01:13:32] And just if you want to place an order with canator. I'll take your order like I'm not I'm not gonna become a show

[01:13:38] I'm not gonna show anybody's games, but I'm gonna do something that is just

[01:13:43] The next evolution of my existence in this hobby, which is like

[01:13:47] Because here's the thing I think it's crazy that I have this huge audience this huge following

[01:13:55] And meanwhile like

[01:13:57] Disters and dealers are making

[01:14:00] $2,000 per game sold and I've done all this work to build this huge community that follows me

[01:14:07] And I can barely make three game sales a month

[01:14:11] So what I'm gonna do is the best of both worlds and I'm not gonna reveal everything yet

[01:14:19] But my whole point to me like if you want one I'll get you on at a good at the best price

[01:14:26] But I'm not gonna tell you I love it or hate it. I'm just gonna just do my show the way I do it like because I'm not doing it to shield for sales

[01:14:34] But I just would ask you if you love canada and my family and canada's pinball podcasts that maybe you just place an order with canada

[01:14:42] But you're gonna see like all of it will be revealed soon enough

[01:14:46] You're gonna see that it's not gonna be some like bye bye bye shield thing. It's just gonna be like

[01:14:52] I'll get you the game at the best price possible and then there might be some like yeah

[01:15:01] No, just just wait just wait to see what I'm gonna do because I because I fundamentally believe

[01:15:06] I fundamentally believe that the entire model

[01:15:10] Is like 30 years old and the people taking advantage of it

[01:15:14] are

[01:15:16] Are like literally getting there. They're literally you'll see you'll see I I'm that's all I'm gonna say

[01:15:29] What would be the benefit to buy from you over other distributors? Well, let me ask your question. Why do you buy from distributors?

[01:15:39] I'll get to the best price. How about that? What else do you want?

[01:15:45] Something goes wrong with the game. Okay, you're covered by warranty

[01:15:49] How many people are buying games from distributors and actually having service calls? I'm curious like how many of you are actually having service calls

[01:16:00] I'll just get to the best price

[01:16:02] I

[01:16:08] Mean I absolutely think it's funny tomorrow. There's gonna literally be

[01:16:16] Okay, how about this I'll take care of you look

[01:16:22] I'm not gonna like snap my fingers and become a flipping out or an automated or a what I'm saying is this

[01:16:28] Canate is getting in on the game

[01:16:32] It's coming

[01:16:33] It's coming

[01:16:35] I've got thousands of people that I've built a community around and

[01:16:42] So like and that's my point is like I litter and when you see what I'm gonna do

[01:16:47] It's gonna be beneficial to both the buyer the customer and the manufacturer

[01:16:53] Because that's the other angle that people like you

[01:16:57] Dude, it is ridiculous the margins

[01:17:01] the margins

[01:17:03] They're making on something that is just drop ship to you

[01:17:08] Like why and no one's trying to like because they're all in on it

[01:17:13] They're all in on it and no one's trying to do something different

[01:17:18] Maybe canate it does something different

[01:17:21] Maybe maybe you will maybe both the you and the manufacturer would be happier doing it this way

[01:17:35] Just get ready

[01:17:37] Just get ready they're all nervous. They're all nervous

[01:17:41] And wait you see how I do it when you see what it's called when you see how it's gonna work like and like it is what it is

[01:17:48] It is what it is

[01:17:50] All right, so Killian is a retro Django welcome brother Killian is upstairs watching movies eating ice cream having his best life

[01:17:57] So everyone's hanging on now

[01:18:02] Everyone's waiting for Brenda to come through this door because when Brenda comes through the door

[01:18:06] I'm gonna play for her the trailer of Beetlejuice and I want you to see what she thinks of it

[01:18:16] Um

[01:18:17] You know who always tells me to become a dealer you know who tells me every day jangus he just joined

[01:18:23] Jangus it's his fall

[01:18:26] You know he tells me every day Chris. What are you doing? What are you doing?

[01:18:32] This is Christopher franchise shirt

[01:18:48] I

[01:18:50] Don't something about franchy art doesn't remind me of like a skull with a pop bumper on the forehead, but I'll wear it he loves it

[01:19:02] Um, of course Brenda seen Beetlejuice you know you know what I have not seen she watched I've not seen the sequel to Beetlejuice yet

[01:19:10] I don't I just like I don't know like I just I don't know I just didn't I love that this game is all Beetlejuice one

[01:19:17] I love that this game is all Beetlejuice one

[01:19:24] I can't wait to call up my my daddy one day and be like daddy daddy

[01:19:31] I need a little money to become a pinball dealer. He's like how much you need bro

[01:19:36] How much you need him like how much you got dad

[01:19:39] How much you got

[01:19:42] Yeah

[01:19:44] Come on all these guys borrowed money to make their companies work

[01:19:56] Great Beetlejuice from one to ten is it's a good question

[01:20:07] Now Bill Bill will talk Bill my my plan is not that because of map my my plan is not about map pricing

[01:20:15] My plan is about

[01:20:18] You'll see I'm not going to give away feel my idea. It's gonna it's gonna change his industry

[01:20:24] It's gonna make people nervous because I mean you think about it like I mean a lot of these dealers have been smart

[01:20:31] They've just been making a lot of content to get orders and get their name out there, but they're they're also like

[01:20:38] They're all playing the same game

[01:20:40] Some are just playing it better

[01:20:42] But now we're about to play the game smarter

[01:20:45] Because it's like

[01:20:48] It's it's obvious what's happening people are making money for nothing and like I get that everyone's in all those headache shipping issues

[01:20:54] But none this is not where this is not where we're gonna win

[01:20:58] Um

[01:21:00] On a one to ten where do I rate Beetlejuice that's a really great question. It's not a ten

[01:21:05] I

[01:21:08] Mean I haven't shot it jangus. It's like just from an overall game and theme integration. I give it a nine and a half

[01:21:16] I ain't nine and a half as a theme integrated pin

[01:21:20] It's as close to I think

[01:21:40] Um, you can bring cast into this I think cast is

[01:21:45] She's giving me a look that makes me think that this is not a good idea, but like

[01:21:51] She also understands that how much this community means to me and you know when the time comes

[01:26:12] Let's see we got here.

[01:26:16] Yeah, the, the, the, the sandworm.

[01:26:22] It's funny that like I didn't realize is that like,

[01:26:26] a sandworm and soda is beetle juice but the beetle juice wanted so much more fun.

[01:26:32] Like I, I mean it like, I,

[01:26:35] barrels got the worm right, but it just feels like it's kind of like a

[01:26:40] Just a little slow.

[01:26:42] This one's much more like.

[01:26:45] One pin house.

[01:26:48] Spooky Luke's still hanging out here.

[01:27:22] like I just want to say this on behalf of guns and roses,

[01:27:25] so it's still an acid like glorious paint.

[01:27:28] Like it's just the problem is they meet so many.

[01:27:30] It's everywhere.

[01:27:31] Like the way cares doesn't shoot great.

[01:27:33] How's the color palette?

[01:27:35] It's insanely good.

[01:27:37] It looks so good.

[01:27:44] Warmeets ball force magnets strong and are.

[01:27:48] Okay.

[01:27:49] Can I preorder from canada ink?

[01:27:54] Yeah, it would be fun to maybe use these five games to kick off my new company.

[01:28:05] More to come on that.

[01:28:06] Not on this game.

[01:28:08] Future games coming.

[01:28:09] Gang.

[01:28:10] I've already got stuff lined up.

[01:28:14] Yeah, the top is the Beetlejuks.

[01:28:23] I'm here.

[01:28:24] Like gang, I'm at your disposal.

[01:28:27] Only one pin for cane dew.

[01:28:32] I can fit about three pins in this house.

[01:28:35] Where can you fit three pins in this house?

[01:28:37] I think I can fit three upstairs in one in the garage.

[01:28:41] I can't go outside.

[01:28:47] I don't know if it's butter is the butter cabinet on the trailer.

[01:28:50] I mean, let's make gang.

[01:28:51] It looks amazing.

[01:28:52] Beetle or evil dead.

[01:28:53] Oh, man.

[01:28:57] Let me go look at evil.

[01:28:59] I be a juice for sure.

[01:29:00] I just like evil that to me is like.

[01:29:04] I just evil just like I just don't have the same level of.

[01:29:10] I'm not.

[01:29:11] No.

[01:29:12] Yeah, I know.

[01:29:13] I'm going to make a smoothie for your brother.

[01:29:18] All right, let me read you some of these inserts on Beetlejuks.

[01:29:21] To death, head shrink.

[01:29:24] Let's play charades singing in the stairwell.

[01:29:30] Day, oh dinner party.

[01:29:32] These are probably the modes.

[01:29:35] Great dig.

[01:29:38] Oath of saeants.

[01:29:41] Infernal room.

[01:29:44] Showtime.

[01:29:52] It's just it's just a beautiful game.

[01:29:56] It's just a beautiful game.

[01:30:01] Is the house in the game?

[01:30:03] That's a good question.

[01:30:05] No, I mean, that's a scope.

[01:30:07] No, the house is not in the game.

[01:30:08] It's a scope.

[01:30:12] If you guys want me to tell you the scopes in the game,

[01:30:15] I'll tell you the scopes in the game.

[01:30:19] The scopes in the game are the Dante's inferno.

[01:30:27] The scopes are the barn with the car going through it.

[01:30:33] Dante's inferno.

[01:30:36] The worm.

[01:30:38] The Beetlejuice grave tombstone.

[01:30:44] There's like a same I name coffin.

[01:30:46] And then there's the Beetleju sign with the arrow going.

[01:30:49] You know, that's so cool.

[01:30:52] The house is not in it.

[01:30:56] There's a lot of time.

[01:31:02] But it's like I'm in the black.

[01:31:04] As a sculpt.

[01:31:05] Yes, yes, yes.

[01:31:07] My own is all over the game.

[01:31:09] Like she's all over the game.

[01:31:12] Is the town model in it?

[01:31:13] I know you guys are thinking the little town model.

[01:31:21] the little town model is not in it.

[01:31:26] Oh, okay, okay, so that's just funny.

[01:31:30] And the upper left in the back box is the now serving number,

[01:31:34] which is kind of funny.

[01:31:36] You know, it's like when he's like waiting to get.

[01:31:39] Let me see.

[01:31:46] There's a couch.

[01:31:48] A tombstone.

[01:31:50] It's really cool gang.

[01:31:52] I got just.

[01:31:54] Let's see.

[01:31:56] Just try not to like.

[01:32:00] Did I?

[01:32:02] Has this been entertaining as carries?

[01:32:04] I didn't even see carries.

[01:32:06] What's on the top of three pop on hers?

[01:32:09] Oh,

[01:32:13] the day was probably the coolest part of the video.

[01:32:18] Okay, on top of the pop bumpers are the.

[01:32:23] It looks like it's the.

[01:32:30] It's like the characters from the shop.

[01:32:33] I can't go to the.

[01:32:38] I'm not on the.

[01:32:40] I'm not having a hard time.

[01:32:48] It's like the green.

[01:32:52] The miss something.

[01:32:54] The green woman with the orange hair.

[01:32:59] They did a little something on the.

[01:33:03] Very stern like on the.

[01:33:06] I'm looking at the apron right now.

[01:33:09] The armor.

[01:33:12] There's like the long nose.

[01:33:19] What's more a world under glass?

[01:33:21] Doon or beetle juice?

[01:33:23] I think they're both.

[01:33:25] I think they're both great world under glasses.

[01:33:28] Tell about the sofa area.

[01:33:31] Okay, so there's like a like a orbit around the sofa.

[01:33:35] I think it's like a rocket in the sofa.

[01:33:38] And it the sofa falls forward to unlock the balls or like release the multiple.

[01:33:45] Let me go look at Doon again.

[01:33:48] I think Doon's got like.

[01:33:50] Doon him.

[01:33:54] The thing with Doon gang.

[01:34:03] Doon.

[01:34:06] Doon just feels like so.

[01:34:15] Like colorless.

[01:34:17] Like when you look at it, like it just.

[01:34:20] I don't like about Doon is like you've got that huge skull to the upper right of like the same with the whole.

[01:34:26] But like it doesn't do anything.

[01:34:28] And so what I like about this beetle juice game is like I don't know all the sculpts like are like attached to something that you something's happening like Doon's got a lot of.

[01:34:39] Like sculpts on top of things that don't do anything.

[01:34:43] You know, and it's like it's like it's like kind of trying to create a world, but there's nothing connected to that world.

[01:34:51] She's making smoothies right now.

[01:34:56] Yeah.

[01:35:02] Um.

[01:35:08] Well, why is one of the featured mechs is so for them.

[01:35:14] Well, the couch is where because here's the thing the couch is isn't the couch in the waiting room.

[01:35:22] A lot of this game is like the waiting room.

[01:35:26] Where beetle juice is on the couch.

[01:35:29] So that's why the sofa is is a mech because it's like you're locking the three characters on the couch.

[01:35:39] So it's the waiting room couch.

[01:35:43] Can people still get one? Yes.

[01:35:45] Tomorrow there will be 70 beetles just games available.

[01:35:48] Okay, here's what I want to do. This has been fun.

[01:35:51] I'm going to let everybody go.

[01:35:53] I'm going to go watch the feature right now and then do a podcast tomorrow morning.

[01:36:00] Anything for the attic.

[01:36:04] It's a good question. There's not the attic.

[01:36:07] There's not the miniature model in the game.

[01:36:10] I don't see that anywhere.

[01:36:14] So no, no miniature attic of the house and all that stuff.

[01:36:23] Gang, this is a lot of fun.

[01:36:27] 70 are from spooky direct tomorrow.

[01:36:30] Okay.

[01:36:33] I just want to say thank you guys for hanging out having a good time.
