[00:00] Alright everybody, welcome to Gnadius Pinball Podcast, we finally have game number one.

[00:24] In the next like 8 weeks we've been talking about it, we're gonna get like 7 new pinball

[00:30] machines and we finally got the trailer, a nice 3 minute video of everything that's

[00:36] gonna be in this P3 multi-morphic portal game.

[00:41] What are my first impressions of this machine?

[00:44] A lot to dissect.

[00:45] I wanna start out my portal first impressions by letting you know, I don't really have like

[00:52] much of a strong opinion about portal as a theme.

[00:56] I can't even remember when I actually played the last portal video game, it was over 10

[01:03] years ago.

[01:04] I don't even know what year or what console it was on, maybe it was PlayStation 2 or the

[01:09] original Xbox, I definitely am aware of it, but it's just not a video game property where

[01:16] I've been sort of playing each installment of it.

[01:20] And I don't kinda think about it like longing for a portal pinball machine, now that being

[01:26] said I wanna talk about this game, what's in it.

[01:31] There's a lot of movement in this game, I'll just saying this, as I was walking by my guns

[01:35] and roses and I was thinking about the portal video with the ramp going up and down and there's

[01:41] movement everywhere on the play field, in the upper half of the play field especially

[01:46] and I'm looking at my guns and roses and I'm like man nothing in G&R even really moves

[01:51] other than a diverter and a record that spins, nothing else.

[01:56] Like there's no movement whatsoever, it's so static and so maybe the argument that we've

[02:02] been having about this P3 multi-morphic platform that there's not enough ability to put like

[02:08] magical pinball fun on top of the screen, maybe we should start to look at this thing

[02:14] a little bit differently.

[02:16] They're putting a lot in it, there's a lot of engineering.

[02:19] So when it comes to portal pinball, I'm looking at the machine right now and let's talk about

[02:24] this game on a few different levels.

[02:27] Let's talk about the theme, do we think this is a good theme for pinball?

[02:31] Let's talk about what's physically in the game, what we saw today.

[02:36] We can talk about the artwork and the game itself like standing back and looking at the

[02:41] game, how do we think the game looks?

[02:43] Is it popping?

[02:44] Is it working for us?

[02:46] And then we can talk about some of the gameplay features that we saw in the video today, a

[02:50] nice three and a half minute video that walked us through the game.

[02:54] Okay, so the first thing we see, I'm going to go from like order of seeing this game,

[02:58] the first thing we see is the artwork on the machine itself and the game has like a very

[03:04] sort of water colored washed out sort of look to it.

[03:09] You know, where a lot of games are trying to be like every colors louder than the color

[03:14] next to it.

[03:15] And we're used to these like really bright colored Skittles stern machines.

[03:19] I do like that they sort of created an art package on this game.

[03:23] That's a little bit different.

[03:24] Again, I'm not super familiar with the portal world.

[03:28] So I'm just assuming that this is the color palette that the portal universe uses in

[03:34] its artistic form.

[03:35] It's very washed out.

[03:37] It doesn't pop as much.

[03:39] Some of the more modern machines we've seen recently.

[03:41] I guess the guy's name is Reginald that like BB eight looking eye figure that talks to you.

[03:47] I think it's really cool that he's in the game.

[03:50] He moves back and forth.

[03:51] I think Mark Silk is the voice in this game.

[03:55] And there's a screen inside that little figure and he moves back and forth and you see like

[04:00] his eye moving and he's like talking to you.

[04:02] And I think that's a really neat feature in this game.

[04:05] There's two versions of this game.

[04:07] There's two versions of this game.

[04:08] And I'm looking at the first version of the game where most of the stuff is happening in

[04:12] the back half of the play field.

[04:14] There's an upper left play field where it goes around in an orbit and it looks like you're

[04:19] charging a momentum jump.

[04:21] And then the ball actually goes through a portal and jumps all the way over to the right side

[04:26] of the game.

[04:27] It looks like there's a ramp up the middle where you lock your balls.

[04:31] All really cool stuff.

[04:32] You know me.

[04:33] I like watching the ball do really cool things.

[04:37] I like when you stand over a pinball machine.

[04:40] You sort of wonder what happens when you get the ball to that area.

[04:44] And so yeah, I mean look, balls jumping around a play field.

[04:47] I'm a big fan of stuff like that.

[04:50] You know in the standard version of the game it does look like all of the action is starting

[04:55] at that top one third of the play field.

[04:58] But then they've got the extended version of this game.

[05:02] And it's interesting.

[05:03] They're now bringing onto the play field.

[05:07] Feels like there's like two more ramps and a flipper.

[05:10] And the right ramp goes up and down so you could shoot underneath it or shoot up to it.

[05:15] There's a lot of added play field that is brought into the game with the extended version

[05:21] of portal.

[05:22] And after watching the video, I mean, how are you not going to get the extended version

[05:27] of this game?

[05:28] I mean, that's the one everybody's going to want.

[05:30] And then I'm looking at the stuff happening on the screen and it is cool.

[05:34] I won't lie.

[05:35] Like it's very dynamic when they play around with like perspective and you feel like you're

[05:41] going down this like tunnel and ramp and roller coaster ride like through the portal universe.

[05:47] A lot of interesting stuff happening in the game when lasers are being fired at you.

[05:55] And this is the kind of like dynamic stuff that I know Jerry always wanted to do on the

[06:00] platform.

[06:01] It just feels like this game is the best utilization of this platform to date.

[06:07] And then I'm looking at the topper on this game, which is a $750 add on and it's more

[06:14] of the same art look and style and feel.

[06:17] Not a lot going on.

[06:18] I was kind of hoping in a game called portal that they were going to have an interactive

[06:23] topper.

[06:24] I was hoping the ball would go through a portal that would land you up inside the topper to

[06:31] have some gameplay element up there.

[06:33] I think that was a missed opportunity.

[06:35] I really do.

[06:36] And we're at the stage now where just layered plastics for $750 seems like a good idea.

[06:43] The one thing I'm worried about is this topper looks really tall.

[06:47] It looks a lot taller than a stern topper.

[06:50] I think the stern rule of thumb is that no topper can be taller than eight inches because

[06:56] that's what most low basement ceilings can allow for.

[07:01] This thing looks a lot taller than that.

[07:04] And I don't like toppers that look too tall.

[07:06] They look a little disproportionate to everything else happening in the game.

[07:10] All right.

[07:11] So here we go.

[07:12] This is game number one.

[07:13] And so what does this machine cost?

[07:15] If you want to get the standard P3 machine, it is $11,620.

[07:22] And if you want to get the full cabinet with the extended edition, it is $12,500.

[07:28] If you just want to buy the standard kit, it's $3,900.

[07:33] Here's where it gets expensive.

[07:34] I think there's one number everybody's going to hone in on.

[07:39] And that is if you own an existing P3 and you want to put the extended edition of portal

[07:47] into your cabinet, you're looking at a $5,500 cost for the modular game alone.

[07:57] That doesn't come with the topper.

[07:58] So right there, this is going to be the main thing people talk about because all of a sudden

[08:04] now that feels like the price of a stern pro.

[08:09] That feels like the entire price of a full pinball machine.

[08:12] If you go on the pin side marketplace right now and you put in $5,500, there will be hundreds

[08:21] of full games you can buy for that much money.

[08:26] So that is where the debate is going to happen around this game.

[08:29] Is it worth it?

[08:31] And does a single modular add on at that much money, does that negate the entire purpose

[08:39] of the multi-morphic platform that if you buy one of these, it's cost effective and will be a

[08:46] cheaper option than buying a separate game.

[08:49] But now the extended version is pretty much the cost of a separate game.

[08:54] Now, some of you might be like, Canada, what are you talking about?

[08:57] A stern pro is like $6,700.

[09:01] A stern premium is $9,700 and a stern alle is $13,000.

[09:06] And you're not wrong.

[09:08] But I think the way we look at pinball now, it's not just about new and box prices.

[09:14] It's for this much money, what can I get in the pinball hobby and $5,500 is a price in which

[09:22] you can get a boatload of really good machines.

[09:26] But for $5,500, you're not going to get, I think, something that looks this innovative,

[09:32] this high tech and this brand new.

[09:34] You're going to get something that's old, that's got some plays on it.

[09:37] You know, I think the feeling I had looking at this game, again, knowing that it's a theme

[09:42] that doesn't pull me in.

[09:43] It's not a take my money now theme.

[09:46] I definitely think the word, the word that I keep coming back to is this game looks really

[09:54] neat, N-E-A-T.

[09:56] It looks neat.

[09:57] Like I want to play it.

[09:58] I want to play it at a show.

[10:00] I want to jump on it.

[10:01] I want to have some fun with it.

[10:02] I think I'll really enjoy it.

[10:04] I don't think I'd ever get to a place where I need to own it simply because of the theme.

[10:09] It's still not, even when I hear Reggie or Reginald talking and all the call outs,

[10:14] it's still Portal, right?

[10:16] It's Portal.

[10:16] Like if you love Portal, here's another great example.

[10:19] This is much like D&D.

[10:20] Like if you love D&D, boy, do I have a game for you.

[10:24] And if you love Portal, boy, do I have a game for you.

[10:28] So it's nice to see that these themes now are being integrated at such a high level.

[10:34] And I mean that.

[10:35] Like this is what Pinball should have always been.

[10:38] This is a great theme integration.

[10:40] This is the right platform for this theme integration.

[10:44] But for a lot of you, it's still going to come down to, is this a theme I really want?

[10:50] Because everyone's going to have their multi-morphic sort of prejudice.

[10:54] Like we all have it.

[10:55] Like, you know, I see people in the thread and Keri Hardy did a great live reveal of this game.

[10:59] And it was like party time at 11am.

[11:02] Not sure that's a great party time, but it was a good conversation.

[11:05] And you can see the P3 owners are like, man, people need to get over their misconceptions

[11:10] around this game.

[11:12] And I don't think there are misconceptions.

[11:14] There's definitely a different feel to a multi-morphic game versus a traditional Pinball machine.

[11:21] The game definitely does unique things that other games can't do.

[11:25] But it also comes at a cost for some people.

[11:28] For some people, the feel just isn't there.

[11:31] Some people don't like using the multiple flipper buttons to use the upper flippers.

[11:36] I know you can kind of change that in the software.

[11:38] But still, that throws some people off.

[11:41] Some people don't like it when the game is off.

[11:43] You're looking down at that blank screen.

[11:46] I don't know if they have like screen saver artwork that you can always have on.

[11:50] Sort of like a Samsung frame artwork that stays on the game so it looks better when the game is off.

[11:55] And also, let's be honest, there's been some quality issues over the years with the platform.

[12:02] I think the earlier builds of multi-morphic are not what they are now.

[12:07] I think the newer games have much less issues.

[12:10] And I think some of that reputation that was established early on with this platform has remained.

[12:17] Canada knows what that's like.

[12:19] Certain people hate Canada from 10 years ago.

[12:22] They don't even listen to the show.

[12:24] And they still are holding on to this toxic thing that doesn't exist anymore on this show.

[12:28] So game number one.

[12:30] Okay, so my overall assessment is I think this game looks neat.

[12:33] The artwork is interesting.

[12:35] It's a little washed out, but I think that's what they were going for.

[12:38] But overall, I think it's a really solid offering from multi-morphic.

[12:45] I also think it's still going to struggle to get people to order it right away for a few reasons.

[12:51] First and foremost, a lot of you just don't want the platform.

[12:54] And I don't think anything is going to change your mind.

[12:56] Even if it was a dream theme, I just don't think anything they do is going to change your mind.

[13:01] So some of you are stuck in that bucket.

[13:03] I also think it's a lot of money.

[13:05] All pinballs a lot of money right now because most of you don't own a multi-morphic.

[13:10] The thought of dropping over $13,000 for the extended version of this game with a topper,

[13:17] you know, that's a lot of money.

[13:19] And you're only going to do that if you want to buy some of the other multi-morphic games.

[13:25] And knowing that there's going to be three to four more major pinball releases over the next

[13:31] month and a half, I don't know why you would go in right away.

[13:35] The other thing is this game has no LE.

[13:39] There's no collector's edition.

[13:42] There's no FOMO.

[13:43] Now they had a limited amount of Princess Brides and Weird Owls, but on this one,

[13:50] they seemingly are going to make as many as they get orders.

[13:55] Even spooky pinball limits its game.

[13:57] So it's interesting that Jerry is not pulling that lever of we're only going to make like

[14:03] 250 extended versions of this game.

[14:06] And it's ostensibly unlimited.

[14:08] Now, when you do that, that's cool.

[14:11] You can do that, but it also creates no urgency.

[14:14] You don't need to order it now.

[14:16] And I think knowing that, why wouldn't you just wait and then get to see what's next from

[14:22] Barrels, from Jersey Jack, from Stern Pinball, from Chicago Gaming Company, from Pinball Brothers.

[14:29] So I'm excited that we've got this new game out in the marketplace today.

[14:33] I think it's a great translation of the theme.

[14:36] I think there's no urgency to order it right now, so you should just wait.

[14:41] And I think at these prices, there's no where for any of these games to go but south.

[14:47] Portal will be a game that you'll be able to get for less than MSRP if you just wait.

[14:53] The state of modern pinball is going to get difficult.

[14:57] It really is.

[14:58] I'm shocked that Jerry didn't think that through a little bit.

[15:02] I think what he's going for for this platform, and that's why the extended modular thing is so

[15:07] expensive, I think he's banking on, this is the best game we've ever made.

[15:13] If you own a P3 platform, you're going to have to buy this game and you're going to want the

[15:18] extended version of this game.

[15:20] And because we don't know how many multi-morphics are out there, let's just say hypothetically,

[15:26] it's 300 machines are out there in the wild.

[15:29] I think he's doing the math that almost all 300 people out there are going to want to order

[15:36] the extended version of this game.

[15:38] And that's $1,650,000 in potential revenue for this company, not profit, but revenue for this company.

[15:48] So I think he's banking on something like that.

[15:50] So this is it.

[15:51] They're the first ones out of the gate.

[15:53] I think this game's got a lot of fun engineering, but still, I think most of us still have to play this.

[15:58] And I think we're going to feel that way over the next month and a half.

[16:01] I think we're going to see a lot.

[16:02] A lot is going to go in front of our eyes.

[16:05] We're going to have a lot of fun conversation and debate, but ultimately,

[16:10] a lot of us are going to have to really, really, really want to own these things.

[16:16] If we're going to want to write checks for $13,000, if we're going to free up room in our game rooms

[16:22] for these machines, I think these games are going to have to check every single box and then some

[16:28] for people to pull the trigger.

[16:30] But for the team over at Multimorphic, I do want to say congratulations.

[16:34] I think a lot of effort went into this.

[16:37] I think there's a lot of creativity I'm seeing, a lot of engineering, and there's a lot more to

[16:42] like about this game than not like.

[16:46] I mean that we have to start congratulating these companies that are making the creative effort

[16:52] to do unique stuff in Pimbal.

[16:54] The moment we stop doing that, we end up with more

[16:58] games like John Wick.

[16:59] We end up with more games like Avatar.

[17:02] Avatar has no toys, no moving things in it, none for $15,000.

[17:07] So I would much rather own a portal than an Avatar.

[17:11] And I mean that.

[17:12] I mean, I'd much rather celebrate and support the companies that are actually trying to put

[17:17] some engineering creativity into their products.

[17:20] So that's it.

[17:21] Game number one is out.

[17:23] I think that was a fair first impression of this game.

[17:26] I think it's going to be a very interesting six weeks as we head into April and all of these

[17:32] games are going to hit and we're going to have to really make up our minds.

[17:36] I think what is going to happen, because there's going to be so many options,

[17:40] we're not going to know where to pull the trigger.

[17:42] I think it's going to make more and more people wait to see everything before you hit go.

[17:48] Harry Potter is going to have FOMO on that CE and so is King Kong LE.

[17:53] But I think everything else, the Barrels game, the Multimorphic game,

[17:58] the Pinball Brothers game, the CGC game, I think all the other stuff,

[18:02] unless it's Potter or Keith Elwyn.

[18:05] I think we're going to have a lot easier time sort of letting the dust settle,

[18:11] jumping on the machine at one of these shows, and then making up our minds on whether or not

[18:16] we want to own it.

[18:18] Everybody, let me know what your feelings are on Portal,

[18:21] Canada, out!
