[00:00] Come Saturday morning, I'm going away with my friend.

[00:08] Some people call me Maurice.

[00:11] Soda, soda, soda, soda, soda, soda.

[00:15] Alright, Saturday morning.

[00:18] Canadian is finally feeling a little bit better.

[00:20] Let's do this.

[00:21] Let's get everybody in the house.

[00:23] Snowing out, I got my snow hat on.

[00:26] We just build Olaf outside.

[00:29] How's everybody doing?

[00:31] Jeremy's in the house.

[00:33] Wouldn't be a show without Jeremy.

[00:35] Let's give everybody a few minutes to rock on in here.

[00:38] And let's do this.

[00:39] What is this?

[00:40] How?

[00:41] Friends just blow us on the back of my chair.

[00:44] How's everybody doing?

[00:46] I mean, I'm about 65% back.

[00:53] Jeffrey, what's up, everybody?

[00:55] Paul's in the house.

[00:57] It's going to be a fun show.

[00:58] We've got a lot to talk about.

[00:59] We've had a lot of stuff going on in the pinball world.

[01:03] A lot of stuff going on in the pinball world.

[01:07] It is snowing out.

[01:09] And I've got my Spies Like Us hat on.

[01:12] It's probably going to get hot wearing this thing inside.

[01:15] So we'll see how long it lasts.

[01:17] Arcade innovations is in the house.

[01:20] Casey's in the house.

[01:22] Tony, Daniel, what's up, people?

[01:26] Ah, the next Sonic movie.

[01:30] I love this thing.

[01:32] It's comfy.

[01:35] It's very comfy.

[01:38] When you get older, I'm losing my eyesight.

[01:40] I feel like I need to start getting glasses.

[01:43] John is in the house.

[01:45] Jack, bar.

[01:47] There's always pinball news.

[01:50] There's always pinball news because every week,

[01:56] these 15 companies are trying to figure out

[02:00] this entire industry.

[02:01] And it's not that it's that hard to figure out.

[02:06] It's really hard to make pinball machines.

[02:08] And we're going to talk all about Haggis Pinball's

[02:14] statement yesterday, which is just confirming what a lot of us

[02:19] have known for a very long time.

[02:20] We're going to talk about the implications of that statement.

[02:23] We're going to talk about the statement itself.

[02:27] I will do a podcast on it this weekend.

[02:29] I'm not going to read the whole thing today.

[02:32] But look, there's a lot of realities happening right now.

[02:36] And there's people that want to live in wishful thinking land.

[02:40] And there's people that want to live in reality.

[02:42] And contrary to what people say about me,

[02:51] I've been called unkind by Damien and this and that,

[02:54] and this and that, and this and that, and this and that.

[02:55] OK.

[02:56] All of these companies, I start out completely open-minded

[03:03] with every single pinball company that develops.

[03:07] You want to say you're a pinball company?

[03:09] I will not just go on a crusade to try to damage your company

[03:15] or your reputation.

[03:16] I am simply covering and analyzing company moves.

[03:20] This is what Canadian Pinball Podcast has always been about.

[03:23] I don't care about tournament play.

[03:25] I don't care about a pathway to wizard modes.

[03:28] I don't care about stern badges.

[03:30] I don't care about any of that stuff.

[03:32] It's not that I don't understand why people like that stuff.

[03:35] It's just I don't find that very interesting to talk about.

[03:38] What I want to talk about is what's going on in the industry.

[03:42] What are these companies doing?

[03:43] What are their moves they're making every month?

[03:46] What is the marketplace like?

[03:47] What's the climate within the community?

[03:49] And to me, that's where pinball is most exciting.

[03:52] That's where the most exciting thing is to cover.

[03:54] That's where the most exciting conversation lies.

[03:56] And you don't need to talk about that for 90 minutes

[04:00] on an episode.

[04:01] Literally every week, there's stuff happening.

[04:04] It is an organic community with things going out the door,

[04:09] prices going up and down, manufacturers announcing stuff,

[04:13] companies giving out statements like yesterday.

[04:16] So look, that's why when a new company comes out, all right,

[04:22] like you're in control of your own destiny, right?

[04:25] A new company is in control of its own destiny.

[04:28] I don't wake up and say, hey, today

[04:29] I'm going to take down Haggis Pinball.

[04:31] Today I'm going to take down Highway Pinball.

[04:35] Today I'm going to say Deeproot is a fraud.

[04:37] I don't do that.

[04:38] What I do is I allow these companies

[04:41] to say what they're going to do.

[04:44] I allow them to showcase their products.

[04:47] And then do you guys want me to take this hat off?

[04:50] Is it too distracting?

[04:52] We'll do it.

[04:52] I should have done a poll.

[04:53] Do you want me to take the hat off?

[04:54] I'll take the hat off.

[04:55] Hold on.

[04:56] Hold on.

[04:56] I'll come back as normal, canada.

[04:57] Hold on.

[04:58] Hold on.

[05:00] Let's do this.

[05:02] It'll be less distracting because I'm

[05:04] about to say some fiery stuff.

[05:07] All right.

[05:08] Let's go more old school.

[05:10] Let's copy a motto with our look here.

[05:12] All right.

[05:13] OK.

[05:16] Leave the hat.

[05:17] You want the hat back on?

[05:19] OK.

[05:20] We'll just go with this canada look.

[05:22] All right.

[05:22] Let's go backwards, Axel Rose.

[05:24] You know what?

[05:25] I want the hat back.

[05:26] I missed the hat.

[05:27] Hold on.

[05:28] It just feels right today.

[05:30] It just feels right with the weather, with the snow.

[05:32] We built a snowman.

[05:33] All right.

[05:34] It goes with the gray, too.

[05:35] Kind of all those together, this color.

[05:38] OK.

[05:38] So basically, every company that comes out,

[05:42] I'm going to give you guys the benefit of the doubt.

[05:44] I'm going to talk about it.

[05:46] And then you think about it.

[05:47] Let's just think about, let's just go down a list.

[05:50] OK.

[05:52] Let's just go down a list of boutique companies

[05:55] and whether or not I called it accurately.

[05:58] All right.

[05:58] Let's start.

[06:02] I mean, Zid, where we all knew was going to fail,

[06:05] we knew that was going to be a failure.

[06:08] When Skip B came out with Predator,

[06:10] I mean, people forget this.

[06:11] People forget this.

[06:13] When Skip B came out with Predator,

[06:15] I was one of the only voices that was like, this is not,

[06:18] this is a scam.

[06:20] Like, there's no way this guy has the license

[06:22] for an Arnold Schwarzenegger game.

[06:24] There's no way it's going to work.

[06:27] This guy is building games in his basement.

[06:29] And this is like 10 years ago, people.

[06:32] And everyone told me to shut up.

[06:34] You had people, like, I'm not going to name names,

[06:37] but people vouching for them.

[06:39] People like, yeah, no way.

[06:41] He's making the games.

[06:42] I've seen it.

[06:43] He has the license.

[06:44] All right.

[06:44] What happened?

[06:45] They failed.

[06:45] OK.

[06:46] Skip B. Then what do we got?

[06:48] Highway pinball.

[06:49] This was really the moment, people.

[06:52] This was really the moment where

[06:54] Canada's credibility was established in the pinball

[06:57] community because I was the only one, the only one that

[07:03] was kicking that can down the road, that Andrew

[07:05] Highway's business model and what he was saying

[07:09] was didn't seem right.

[07:10] And what happened with Highway Pinball

[07:13] was people were giving me inside information

[07:16] on what was happening behind the scenes.

[07:18] And it was terrible.

[07:19] And then Andrew, unlike Damien, Andrew

[07:22] would always put up these videos trying

[07:24] to convince people everything was going well.

[07:27] And man, the ability for this community

[07:29] to be hoodwinked and suckered by businessmen who don't really

[07:34] know what they're doing.

[07:35] It's amazing.

[07:36] All you got to do is say you're going

[07:37] to make a pinball machine.

[07:38] And this intelligent male audience that's in pinball,

[07:42] all of a sudden turns off all common sense

[07:44] and just follows you towards the light

[07:47] and basically will throw money at you,

[07:49] even if you've shown no real ability to know what you're doing.

[07:54] And Highway Pinball did that.

[07:56] And what did I do?

[07:57] I told everybody, this company is going to go under.

[08:01] This company is going to fail.

[08:02] Like nothing they're doing makes sense.

[08:04] Those are staged assembly line videos.

[08:07] And what happened?

[08:09] What happened?

[08:10] Here's the problem, everybody.

[08:12] Is everyone needs to learn one simple thing.

[08:16] Liars are really good at lying.

[08:24] Liars are really good at lying.

[08:27] So it's so weird to me that people

[08:30] mistake transparency for the truth.

[08:33] Transparency is not the truth.

[08:38] It's not.

[08:39] The truth is behind all the rhetoric

[08:43] and all the hubris and all the hyperbole.

[08:46] The truth of what's happening in a pinball company,

[08:50] just because a pinball manufacturer says something

[08:53] doesn't make it true.

[08:57] And we're going to talk about this Haggis statement

[08:59] because it's so funny when people are like,

[09:00] well, I'm just really happy Damien's transparent.

[09:03] What does that mean?

[09:04] Because the statement is all over the place.

[09:08] And if you read between the lines,

[09:10] it seems like the situation is really dire.

[09:14] It doesn't seem like anything good is about to happen

[09:17] for anyone who's in on this ship.

[09:19] And we're going to talk about all of it.

[09:21] Let's just talk about it right now.

[09:23] I don't know why I'm like teeing it up like it's coming.

[09:24] It's coming now.

[09:26] You've been here for 12 minutes.

[09:27] You're getting the heat.

[09:29] So highway pinball.

[09:31] I covered that garbage company, sorry, Dave,

[09:35] but Andrew didn't know what he was doing.

[09:37] Another guy who didn't come from the world of manufacturing

[09:40] didn't know what he was doing.

[09:41] All right, so then what happens there?

[09:43] Then we get highway pinball collapses.

[09:46] Then we got what, Cosmic Carnival, right?

[09:48] Remember that company?

[09:50] I mean, it was like whatever.

[09:52] What is this?

[09:53] Dirty Donnies.

[09:54] I don't even know which company that was.

[09:56] They came and went.

[09:59] Then we've got what?

[10:01] Who the guys that did the,

[10:03] we're going to remake pinball circus

[10:06] and we're going to remake Kingpin, right?

[10:10] What is it?

[10:12] Circus Maximus or pinball circus, whatever those guys are.

[10:16] So look at those guys.

[10:17] They come out, they show one prototype of Kingpin.

[10:21] They sell 250 translates

[10:24] and then they've gone away for five years now.

[10:26] Five years, Suncoast Pinball.

[10:29] Suncoast was Cosmic Carnival.

[10:31] Right, okay, another startup.

[10:34] No pathway to manufacturing.

[10:36] No pathway whatsoever.

[10:38] And again, I wasn't very kind.

[10:40] I was very like, look, I don't understand.

[10:43] Like why are you selling translates?

[10:45] You know, why are you even bringing this game to a show?

[10:47] Like what do you need the money?

[10:50] If you don't need the money, then why are you doing this?

[10:52] Why is it that every single pinball boutique,

[10:55] other than spooky, has always needed to treat its customers

[11:00] like go fund me, Kickstarter investors.

[11:03] If you want to start a company

[11:05] and you want people to buy your products,

[11:08] go to the bank and get a loan, right?

[11:11] Go knock on your rich uncle's door or grandpa,

[11:16] knock off your boomer parents who have all the money

[11:18] and then start your company.

[11:21] But to make your customers,

[11:23] the angel investors of your organization has never worked.

[11:29] It will never work.

[11:30] And that's exactly what we're seeing all over again

[11:32] with Haggis.

[11:33] If people think, why do you think he needs money?

[11:37] Eight months in advance,

[11:39] before eight months before your game goes on the line,

[11:41] just think about the idiocracy of a person

[11:45] who pays in full for a product.

[11:48] Eight months before it goes on the line.

[11:51] Think about what that means.

[11:53] Just use your brain.

[11:54] Like do me a favor, use your brain.

[11:56] What does that mean?

[11:57] That means that in May of 2023,

[12:01] when Damien took people's payment in full,

[12:04] he knew that that person's game, let's say $9,000, right?

[12:09] That person's $9,000 that he collected in May,

[12:14] what was that going towards?

[12:16] Especially, here's what doesn't add up.

[12:19] He keeps talking about how he's got this lean way

[12:22] to manufacture, like Toyota.

[12:24] Like the fact that he's even comparing himself to Toyota,

[12:27] like he's got this lean way to manufacture

[12:30] where he's only ordering parts right when he needs them.

[12:33] So he's not stockpiling parts and it's really efficient

[12:37] and it's the most cost effective way.

[12:39] Sure, Damien, it's really worked out tremendously well

[12:42] for you.

[12:43] If that's the case, where he doesn't need,

[12:45] he doesn't want your parts in his factory

[12:48] until they're needed,

[12:51] then why does he need your money eight months in advance?

[12:56] Does any of that add up?

[12:58] On one side, he's saying,

[13:00] he's built his company around this super efficient way

[13:04] to build games where your money is going to order your parts

[13:08] right when those games get assembled.

[13:10] And then eight months go by

[13:12] and you still don't have your game.

[13:15] It is absolutely ridiculous

[13:17] and you know why he's doing that.

[13:19] Because he needs your money in May, not to build your game.

[13:24] He needs your money in May to pay the vendors

[13:29] to get the parts for the games he has to build in May.

[13:33] Not your game, the games he has to build that month.

[13:37] And so your money is going towards payments

[13:43] that have nothing to do with your game.

[13:45] And you could string that along, right?

[13:47] You could string that business model along only so far,

[13:52] but someone's going to be left holding the bag.

[13:54] Somebody, right?

[13:56] At the end of that eight, nine month production schedule,

[14:00] somewhere the money runs out.

[14:02] And the only way,

[14:04] the only way to keep the money coming in

[14:08] to fulfill all those Fathom orders,

[14:10] what is the thing we've seen every company do

[14:16] that basically has misled and committed

[14:23] like fraud with its customers.

[14:25] What is the one move that Andrew Highway did?

[14:28] John Papadook did it.

[14:30] Every single boutique that is bombed did this move.

[14:35] They announced another game

[14:39] before the game they were building

[14:42] and had to build was complete.

[14:46] They took money on game number two so far in advance

[14:52] to figure out how to get themselves out of the hold

[14:55] they're in on game number one.

[14:57] Andrew Highway did it with Alien.

[14:59] John Papadook did it with Raza.

[15:02] We've seen it time and time again.

[15:06] And so why is it that this is any different?

[15:10] And best believe people,

[15:12] Andrew Highway with all of his,

[15:17] with all of his ineptitude,

[15:21] managed to still screw together a few hundred aliens.

[15:24] Like don't forget this.

[15:26] He still made a few hundred aliens

[15:28] and how many full throttles.

[15:31] You know what I'm saying?

[15:32] Like because games are being built

[15:35] does not mean that the company is gonna survive.

[15:41] Because if you're losing thousands of dollars

[15:44] on every game you screw together

[15:47] and that's why you need new thousands of dollars

[15:51] to build the old orders, it doesn't work.

[15:56] None of it works.

[15:58] And Haggis Pinball has done exactly the same thing.

[16:03] Okay?

[16:05] And I'm just saying this,

[16:06] because when I say this stuff

[16:08] and they're like, well, you're unkind.

[16:11] No, you know what's unkind is lying.

[16:14] And I mean, like look, we can dance around this

[16:18] and my boy Kim Mitchell can say I'm being unfair.

[16:21] We, you could call it any other words you want.

[16:25] But when you're Damien and Marty and you know,

[16:29] you know, like you know,

[16:31] and you're like, you're a smart man.

[16:35] You know when you tell somebody in May,

[16:39] if you pay and fall, I will have you your game in eight weeks.

[16:43] You know what your production schedule is.

[16:46] You know what your capacity is.

[16:49] When you say that and you know

[16:52] it's gonna be more like eight months,

[16:55] you're lying.

[16:58] You're lying.

[17:02] Eight weeks is two months.

[17:05] So you're lying to people

[17:08] and you know you can't get it done.

[17:11] And like it's like, so either you live

[17:13] in this like mixed reality world

[17:16] where your intentions are like combating with reality.

[17:23] And this is the thing.

[17:24] It's like, so look,

[17:27] I get that you opened up a company during COVID

[17:30] but nobody made you.

[17:32] I get that you are, you know,

[17:35] trying to do real estate developments

[17:37] that aren't working out.

[17:38] Nobody made you.

[17:39] I get that you have some money

[17:41] that you made in another career

[17:43] and now you wanna chase your pinball dream

[17:46] with no manufacturing experience.

[17:49] I get that.

[17:50] That's a Hail Mary pathway in life.

[17:55] To go into something you've never done before,

[17:58] to try to compete with people

[18:00] that have decades of experience without learning first.

[18:04] And I'm gonna say something now that's really mean.

[18:07] I will be a little bit mean

[18:08] because you know people are mean to me

[18:11] but I'm sorry people.

[18:13] This thing never should have got past counts.

[18:18] And if it was gonna get past counts,

[18:22] it had to slowly evolve as a company

[18:25] because to me, counts is like your America's most haunted.

[18:29] It was their America's most haunted.

[18:32] They had no business going from counts

[18:37] to then thinking they could sell all of these games,

[18:41] rent this big factory, have all of this space.

[18:45] Like what about counts?

[18:48] Signal to anybody here that this company was ready,

[18:53] that they were ready to take the next leap forward,

[18:56] that they knew what consumers wanted,

[18:58] that they had innovations and a product

[19:01] that people couldn't wait to get.

[19:03] It should have ended at counts.

[19:06] It should have.

[19:07] I mean, even America's most haunted

[19:09] is a better game than counts.

[19:12] And so like, they literally,

[19:15] it's like a child that just learned

[19:18] how to ride a bike with training wheels

[19:20] and now all of a sudden Damien wanted

[19:22] to be in the Tour de France.

[19:25] And it's just like, again,

[19:27] it just never should have gone the way it did.

[19:31] And in the end, in the end,

[19:34] the reason why these companies fail,

[19:36] the reason why is because there's too many cheerleaders

[19:41] that don't tell these men to stop and think a little bit

[19:45] about what they're doing, to maybe slow down,

[19:47] maybe study what Spooky did.

[19:50] They'll study how they evolved.

[19:52] Think about it, if you're a boutique like Damien

[19:54] and you wanna figure out how to succeed

[19:57] the way Spooky did, mirror them, Damien.

[20:01] They didn't do what you did.

[20:03] They didn't do what you did at all.

[20:04] Also Spooky had conditions

[20:07] that were very beneficial to their dreams.

[20:10] They had support from the town.

[20:11] They had very cheap overhead.

[20:13] They had an abundance of local labor

[20:16] that was willing to help them out.

[20:17] They also had people that were industry veterans

[20:20] that they had access to,

[20:21] all of which you didn't have in Australia.

[20:25] So it's just like, look,

[20:28] it's just like at the point now, we're now what?

[20:33] We've been down this road before, now what?

[20:36] Do people deserve a refund?

[20:38] So let's ask that question right now.

[20:40] Let's ask that question right now.

[20:43] We know who they are.

[20:44] We know who the distributors are.

[20:46] You've got Flippin' Out, you've got Nitro

[20:49] and you've got RS Pimbal in France.

[20:51] Those are the three distributors of Haggis Pimbal.

[20:54] They all took money from people on Centaur deposits.

[20:59] They instilled confidence in this company

[21:02] when they took those Centaur deposits.

[21:06] And so now what?

[21:08] Now what happens?

[21:09] Now when Damien drops this letter

[21:12] and says, not only are we not done with fathoms,

[21:17] but we're gonna reduce and slow down

[21:22] the already slowest production happening in all of Pimbal,

[21:26] we're gonna downsize production

[21:30] and we're gonna have to recapitalize and repartner up.

[21:34] What does that even mean?

[21:36] So where are, so I think people deserve a refund.

[21:42] And remember when you were giving money

[21:44] into the distributors and they said,

[21:46] we were not gonna give the money to Haggis Pimbal.

[21:49] And only when Haggis goes under will be responsible.

[21:54] Look, gang, gang, this thing could draw out for years.

[22:00] I feel like Damien's gonna retreat

[22:02] to a much smaller facility.

[22:04] He's probably gonna be screwing together one game a week.

[22:07] And so what?

[22:08] It could take another year to finish the fathoms.

[22:11] If it even happens, it could go into liquidation.

[22:17] Who knows where things go now?

[22:18] I mean, I have no clue, but it's not good.

[22:21] It's not good.

[22:25] Why would anyone get in bed with this company?

[22:27] I said it back then, and I haven't disclosed the things

[22:31] that happened between me and flipping out

[22:33] because when I was covering Haggis back in May

[22:37] and I have all the emails to prove it,

[22:40] I was getting basically legal notices,

[22:44] legal notices that I was saying things incorrectly

[22:47] about their relationship with Haggis,

[22:49] to which I offered to retract or make up anything I said,

[22:54] and they never responded.

[22:56] And I had to have a lawyer look over everything

[22:58] because I was basically being accused of things that,

[23:03] again, now what?

[23:05] Now where we're at?

[23:06] Where are we at now?

[23:08] Where are we at?

[23:09] You took people's money, you gave money to Haggis,

[23:13] and now those people are screwed for how long now?

[23:16] And I said it, what's the point?

[23:18] What was the point of getting in bed with this company

[23:21] that was highly volatile just for another buck?

[23:25] I mean, some of these distributors, like wake up.

[23:28] Like just be happy that you're selling a bunch of stern

[23:32] toppers and making money on those things

[23:35] when you're not doing much work other than putting

[23:37] a postage label on a damn topper box.

[23:40] Like don't get greedy.

[23:42] Like greediness is what's really hurting Pimble.

[23:46] Like, so now they've got a dilemma.

[23:48] The distributors have a dilemma.

[23:50] Now what do they do?

[23:51] What do they do?

[23:53] They don't have the money either.

[23:54] Like someone's gonna lose out here.

[23:57] And let's face it people, just like Highway Pimble,

[24:01] if everybody wanted a refund right now,

[24:04] the Haggis would be over instantly.

[24:06] The company would be out of business in one day

[24:09] if they gave refunds and that's not good.

[24:13] Look, I know this is unfortunate

[24:17] and nobody wants to see these companies fail

[24:19] but you gotta be kidding me people.

[24:20] You gotta be a complete moron.

[24:22] I mean this.

[24:24] You gotta be a complete moron to wire money in fall

[24:28] over to Australia or to a distributor

[24:32] for a company that is doing this.

[24:35] When you can take the same amount of money

[24:38] and go buy a physical machine that's in a box

[24:41] from Spooky today, from Jersey Jack,

[24:45] from Stern, from Chicago Gaming Company,

[24:48] you could call up distributors from all over the world.

[24:52] They have inventory.

[24:54] And until we stop this shenanigans

[24:57] where you're angel investing and kickstarting these boutiques,

[25:02] do you think Dutch Pimble is gonna take pre-order money

[25:07] on Back to the Future like they're gonna need that?

[25:09] No, they're gonna be making the game.

[25:12] And yeah, Centaur, $10,000 and $17,000 for a Centaur.

[25:20] Nobody's buying that game.

[25:22] Nobody, and whichever ones were sold

[25:25] and like a moment of silence

[25:27] for the biggest fools on the planet.

[25:30] These series ticket holder people

[25:33] who gave Damien $4,500 for four titles in advance.

[25:42] Just because the man screwed together a few counts.

[25:46] It's just funny people that in the end,

[25:52] in the end, I will have made more money

[25:55] on Canada's Pinball podcast this year

[25:57] than Haggis Pinball has made.

[26:01] And that's just that.

[26:03] I have no overhead, well, just over,

[26:05] what's over my head and what's in my head.

[26:08] I do three shows a week with Audacity Software,

[26:12] which is free, and I use a $250 microphone

[26:17] and I give Pinball Entertainment and Joy

[26:20] to a few thousand people a week.

[26:23] And I get a little bit of money in return.

[26:25] I don't burn anybody.

[26:27] I do exactly what I say I'm gonna do.

[26:29] I give you guys more entertainment

[26:31] than you'll ever get from Haggis.

[26:32] You know this, I'm more fun than a fathom pinball machine.

[26:35] You know this, this is more fun

[26:36] than a fathom pinball machine.

[26:37] Look, you would never be able to play fathom

[26:40] for the amount of hours you listen to Canada.

[26:42] I'm more fun than some of these machines.

[26:44] You know that.

[26:47] And this is where we're at.

[26:49] And now we're gonna have to hear

[26:50] from these distros what they're gonna do.

[26:52] Now look, it's on them, it's on them.

[26:55] I mean, some of them are on the record

[26:56] for saying they would give refunds.

[26:59] But I do remember them saying

[27:01] they were not gonna send the money to Haggis.

[27:04] Now all of a sudden, they did send the money to Haggis.

[27:09] That's a problem.

[27:10] Now look, none of that's in writing.

[27:13] None of it's in writing.

[27:14] And there's a reason why if you go

[27:16] on the distributor websites gang,

[27:18] like read the terms and conditions of your Centaur order,

[27:22] it's like you're gonna get it one day,

[27:24] we just don't know when.

[27:25] And people still gave money.

[27:27] It's just, that's cool.

[27:30] No, the new Canadian shirt is,

[27:32] Canada always recapitalizing.

[27:35] All right, I recapitalizing.

[27:38] Recapitalizing is the new hedge multi-bomb.

[27:43] It's the phrase of 2024 people.

[27:46] Canada always recapitalizing.

[27:49] All right, I'm always recapitalizing.

[27:53] It's become a joke.

[27:55] It's become a joke.

[27:57] And look, ultimately, Haggis is like,

[28:03] you know what Haggis is like?

[28:04] It's like, do you know in high school,

[28:06] it'd be one thing if the quarterback got in a fight

[28:11] with the best basketball player.

[28:13] Haggis is like the two of the scrawny kids in the school

[28:16] are having it out right now in the playground.

[28:19] Like that's what talking about Haggis is.

[28:22] They're like so small in the pinball space.

[28:26] They're not a mover and a shaker.

[28:28] They're like the two little runs

[28:30] are like slapping each other around by the swing set.

[28:33] Like that's Haggis pinball.

[28:34] And I'm gonna say this, Marty Robbins

[28:38] and all the people that have like,

[28:40] the amount of times he's gone on to pinball interview shows

[28:44] and convinced people everything is fine.

[28:47] In the end, if everything was as good

[28:51] as those two years of interviews and videos

[28:55] and confidence building content that they've pumped out,

[28:58] if they were accurate,

[29:02] we wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.

[29:06] You know what I'm saying?

[29:07] They have to remember something people.

[29:09] Amota, what's up?

[29:11] In May, Damien said he'd have all the fathoms

[29:14] built by the end of the year

[29:16] and sent our production would start in January.

[29:19] The man is still talking about COVID.

[29:22] The man is still bringing up COVID as an excuse.

[29:25] The COVID is over Damien.

[29:27] There's nobody anymore talking about COVID

[29:29] as like the reason why they can't hit in

[29:31] their homework assignment, bro.

[29:33] Oh, you're like, is COVID just hovering over your house?

[29:37] Are you the only company where COVID

[29:39] is impacting the supply chain?

[29:42] Everybody's turned on again, man.

[29:44] Everybody but Haggis.

[29:46] Like in some cruel world,

[29:49] God up there was like,

[29:51] the world can turn back on except for Haggis pinball.

[29:56] If I'm gonna screw anybody over,

[29:58] you know, it's not, it's gonna be Haggis.

[30:02] It's gonna be Haggis.

[30:03] They, let's let everybody go back to business as usual

[30:08] except for Haggis.

[30:09] I'm just not feeling it guys.

[30:12] God's like, I'm not feeling this company

[30:14] and their extra thick play fields,

[30:16] which means they have to manufacture in-house.

[30:20] Every single post and part has to be specially fabricated

[30:25] because the play fields are a little thicker

[30:28] and did nobody think how much more expensive that would be.

[30:33] If we have to absolutely not be able to use standard parts,

[30:38] the cost of making these is gonna be a nightmare.

[30:41] I'm not even drinking and I can tell you that, Damien,

[30:45] at 1034 in New York City, brother, if you do this,

[30:50] if you do this, it's not gonna work out.

[30:54] Maybe just make a normal play field

[30:57] and normal post and normal screws.

[31:00] You know, you're like Andrew Highway,

[31:02] you wanna know how a hex post is made?

[31:04] No, Andrew.

[31:06] I don't wanna know how a hex post is made.

[31:10] I don't even know what a hex post is, brother,

[31:13] but I know what recapitalization is

[31:17] and that ain't good.

[31:18] That ain't good.

[31:20] Don't make me go Billy Madison on this guy.

[31:23] I can do a good Adam Sandler.

[31:24] Damien, come on.

[31:26] It's ridiculous, right?

[31:28] And they're watching right now.

[31:30] They're watching, the haters are watching right now.

[31:31] I mean, one side, I gotta check out Kaneda.

[31:35] He's the only one he's talking like this.

[31:38] Let's get our show ready to respond to him,

[31:41] but he doesn't listen to our show.

[31:44] We have to listen to everything he says

[31:46] and he doesn't even listen to anything we say.

[31:50] He never mentions us once on his show.

[31:54] Why do we keep talking about him?

[31:57] He's living in our heads.

[31:59] Rent free would have been a seven,

[32:02] Twippy, it's gonna be seven.

[32:05] Number seven doesn't count.

[32:07] Number seven doesn't count.

[32:10] Look, people, I do believe in forgiveness.

[32:14] I do believe in letting people,

[32:19] be honest about their situation,

[32:22] but I'll tell you, I'll tell you,

[32:26] there's something about forgiveness should come

[32:29] when you are honestly sorry for what you've done.

[32:33] When people keep bringing up Dutch,

[32:35] and here's the big difference between Dutch and Haggis.

[32:39] I'll tell you the big difference between Dutch,

[32:41] who, by the way, spent about 15% of our lives

[32:46] screwing us over, but they crawled out.

[32:50] Now, there's only one reason why Barry made it work.

[32:53] There's only one reason why Barry could have crawled out

[32:56] of that gutter and he's doing great now,

[32:59] and man, does he have some juggernauts coming,

[33:01] and man, I can't wait.

[33:03] The only reason Barry was able to crawl out of his hole

[33:09] is because he had talent and he had a game

[33:13] that people wanted, okay?

[33:16] That's why they built a spectacular game

[33:22] that people wanted and they just ran out of money

[33:26] or they mismanaged their finances,

[33:28] but they still had the talent.

[33:30] Damien made counts.

[33:32] Damien's first game was counts.

[33:34] I can't even believe I'm saying this.

[33:37] You have a guy that made the Big Lebowski

[33:40] or a guy that made counts,

[33:41] and imagine if you're a venture capitalist

[33:43] and you walk into the room, okay, guys,

[33:45] I'm gonna put my money somewhere,

[33:47] show me what you can make, then show me what you can make,

[33:50] and one dude walks in with the Big Lebowski,

[33:53] which embarrasses the major companies in the entire industry,

[33:57] and the other dude walks in with counts.

[34:01] And then you're gonna show like,

[34:02] I can't even believe,

[34:04] I can't even believe we're having this conversation.

[34:09] It should have ended at counts.

[34:11] That's another T-shirt idea.

[34:14] How many counts sold?

[34:16] One too many, brother, one too many.

[34:21] This is what happens when I'm sick for a week

[34:24] and I come back.

[34:26] Now look, guys, if you like this kind of stuff,

[34:28] come on, kick some stars, brothers, kick some stars.

[34:31] I'm gonna have to make this one a podcast.

[34:34] The audio is gonna become a podcast.

[34:36] This is too good.

[34:36] My paying customers are getting this.

[34:38] This is, you guys are getting too much for free.

[34:40] You're getting too much for free.

[34:42] So look, that's it.

[34:44] That's it.

[34:45] So like Centaur, that's what's funny,

[34:47] is like Centaur can't save you.

[34:49] Centaur can't save this guy.

[34:52] At least Andrew Highway had alien.

[34:54] Dutchess got back to the future.

[34:56] Bro, it's like, okay, what do you got next?

[34:59] What do you got next?

[35:00] If you're an investor, okay, big Lebowski, looks good.

[35:02] What do you got next?

[35:03] Back to the future.

[35:05] All right, all right.

[35:06] Oh, Danny, what do you got next?

[35:07] Well, we're gonna remake Centaur.

[35:10] Huh, the fuck is that?

[35:12] Can you imagine an investor?

[35:14] Back to the future.

[35:15] I get it.

[35:16] Love the movie.

[35:17] Kids love it.

[35:18] Seein' in my whole life.

[35:19] What do you got?

[35:20] Centaur.

[35:22] What's this guy talking about?

[35:23] Centaur?

[35:25] No.

[35:26] No, no, no, no.

[35:29] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[35:31] No, no, no, no, no, no.

[35:32] I'm not doing this.

[35:34] If you sent money in,

[35:37] if you sent money in on the game.

[35:40] Thank you, Mark, for the stars.

[35:43] Look, you can get a Centaur people for like $5,000, $6,000.

[35:46] The guy wants to sell you a Centaur for $10,000 to $17,000.

[35:50] And nobody was like, yo, Dane, yo, Dane, Dane,

[35:55] check it out, bro.

[35:56] Come here, bro.

[35:57] Dane, yo, this, Marty, Marty, why weren't you like,

[36:02] yo, Dane, check it out.

[36:03] I'm on Pinside Marketplace right now.

[36:05] Looks like these Centaurs are going for like 5G's, bro.

[36:09] You really think we're gonna be able

[36:10] to sell these things for 10 to 17?

[36:14] Well, I don't know, man.

[36:15] And Dane's like, I don't know, bro.

[36:16] Like let's just throw in a helmet and a leather jacket.

[36:19] Maybe they'll bite if we do that.

[36:20] I mean, this is like an SNL skit, people.

[36:23] But this is like, it really happened.

[36:25] Like it really happened.

[36:26] They did this.

[36:27] They did this.

[36:29] Don't make me do the Scarface voice.

[36:31] Hey, is this what it's about?

[36:34] Huh?

[36:35] Is this what it's about?

[36:37] Plastic play fields, elongated posts,

[36:42] eight month delays.

[36:43] You need people like me.

[36:45] You need people like me.

[36:47] So you, Kaneda can point at me and say, that's the bad guy.

[36:51] Well, look, we recapitalizing.

[36:53] So say goodnight to the bad guy.

[36:55] All right?

[36:57] You gotta admit people with no notes, no nothing.

[37:00] Like I don't even have like any agenda today.

[37:03] This is pretty good.

[37:04] You're getting some pretty good content.

[37:06] Like some, like later this week,

[37:08] Jen gets me like, oh man, I missed it.

[37:09] It was on fire.

[37:10] Yeah, yeah, you're getting it.

[37:14] I mean, I made more money on this Facebook live

[37:16] than Haggis is gonna make all year.

[37:18] I made about right now like 12 bucks.

[37:21] Thank you for the $12 people.

[37:24] Maybe it's a little bit more than 12 bucks.

[37:26] I think it's like 12 bucks.

[37:29] All right, all right, all right.

[37:30] All right guys, if you enjoyed that, show your love,

[37:33] kick some stars to your board, Kaneda.

[37:36] Let's see how much money we can make

[37:37] more than Haggis does this year.

[37:39] Can we do that?

[37:40] Can we see if we can get to 20,000 stars on this episode?

[37:43] Cause I think if we can get to 20,000 stars,

[37:45] that is more money than Haggis has ever made

[37:47] in the company's history.

[37:48] I mean, it's, and that's like 200 bucks.

[37:50] I think we can get there.

[37:52] I mean, Billy B right now is eating,

[37:55] is eating his like salmon with like caviar on top.

[38:00] He's like, oh, he's like Sabrina,

[38:02] Kaneda wants $20 from us.

[38:04] Just past the crystal, babe,

[38:07] like in the Waterford crystal with the pinkie out.

[38:09] He's like, I can't believe this guy is busking for money.

[38:12] Sabrina, did we wash the third Ferrari today?

[38:16] Didn't we because you know,

[38:17] I noticed a little bit of brake dust

[38:19] on the V12 the other day.

[38:23] Unbelievable, unbelievable.

[38:25] I even have to bust.

[38:28] Guys know what you're getting.

[38:29] I know what's out there.

[38:31] I know what I could be doing with a real category

[38:33] when at least in my time, but you know, it's fun.

[38:35] Fun, I don't want to talk about.

[38:38] All right, what's it talking about?

[38:40] Let's talk about something else.

[38:41] That was a good 40 minute run on Haggis.

[38:45] Yeah, it kind of made my podcast for me.

[38:46] It's just going to air that.

[38:49] It doesn't get up to nine.

[38:51] I feel like she sleeps in plank, Bill.

[38:54] She sleeps in plank.

[38:57] Okay, so look, we got Stern.

[39:00] Let's go to Stern.

[39:01] Let's go to Stern, Ellie's.

[39:03] I'm not going to all be made at once.

[39:06] I don't think we've seen this before.

[39:08] Have we seen a gap in Stern starting in Ellie Run

[39:14] and then stopping it?

[39:15] I don't know if we've seen this before.

[39:18] Part of me feels like,

[39:20] part of me feels like this little

[39:22] Canadian conspiracy theory.

[39:25] I feel like Stern is doing this on purpose.

[39:28] I think they want to control the supply of Ellie's

[39:31] and trickle them out to maintain their value

[39:34] a little bit better.

[39:36] I don't think they want them all to hit it once.

[39:39] I've never seen Stern misorder parts.

[39:43] So I think they might be trying to like manipulate

[39:45] the market a little bit with this pause

[39:48] because there's not many parts that are different

[39:51] from a premium than in Ellie.

[39:54] You've got white powder coated armor.

[39:56] Man, that wouldn't take,

[39:58] like they wouldn't start making them

[39:59] till they had that in house.

[40:01] You've got the 3D Translight or whatever.

[40:04] I don't know.

[40:05] This doesn't seem like they would start

[40:07] pulling that Ellie lever down until they were ready.

[40:11] So I think this is a slow trickle out

[40:15] to make sure that nobody is, you know,

[40:19] instantly losing on their Ellie's

[40:21] to try to preserve some value.

[40:24] They're having issues sourcing the reflective decals.

[40:28] You believe that, Dave?

[40:29] You believe that they can't find a printer

[40:33] to make decals in the United States of America?

[40:37] Huh.

[40:39] Huh.

[40:40] I don't know.

[40:43] Well, who printed the ones that are on the games

[40:45] being made right now?

[40:46] You know, that's what I don't get.

[40:49] Anyway, it probably is just the decal issue though.

[40:55] I'm just, I love conspiracy theories.

[40:57] Let's talk about the shark mod,

[40:59] the one that eats the ball,

[41:01] which Mao's always open.

[41:04] I've been watching it more and more.

[41:06] I've been watching it.

[41:07] And, you know, I give the guy credit.

[41:10] Who made it again?

[41:12] I think he's a member of the Canadian club.

[41:13] Who made the shark?

[41:15] Let's give him some credit here.

[41:17] I want to give him a shout out.

[41:19] So does anyone know who engineered that?

[41:22] I don't know what the name of the company is.

[41:23] Can we write in the comments and I'll say it out loud

[41:26] so everybody knows where to get this mod?

[41:30] I'm waiting for the answer.

[41:32] What do we got?

[41:34] Better than the pro standard alternative.

[41:36] Yeah, it is better than the pro.

[41:39] It definitely changes gameplay.

[41:42] It does look like a labyrinth topper hat.

[41:44] Thank you, Dave.

[41:48] Yeah, I actually thought too that like,

[41:52] it is gonna make jobs much easier to have that.

[41:56] Spooky Luke, man, you joined at the wrong time, man.

[41:58] You're gonna have to go back and watch

[42:00] the last 40 minutes of this show.

[42:03] Interactive pinball.

[42:05] All right, Trent, yeah.

[42:06] Trent, great, I mean, great engineering on that thing.

[42:11] I said it on my show of Satan out,

[42:14] like I'm not a fan of mods that change the design of the game.

[42:20] And the fact that like, if the ball rolls over

[42:23] those optos, it counts as three hits at once.

[42:28] It's feeding the ball into a vuck,

[42:30] which then feeds it right to the,

[42:32] you know, right to the right flipper,

[42:35] where that takes away,

[42:38] that takes away some of the chaos

[42:40] and the randomness of the game.

[42:41] It's making the game easier.

[42:43] There's no way around.

[42:44] It's making the game easier.

[42:45] The Jerry ramp did the same thing in Rick and Morty.

[42:49] And I know people are like,

[42:50] well, it's making the game more fun.

[42:53] Yeah, it's fun to,

[42:58] like ride a bike with training wheels on,

[43:02] but like it's just making the game easier.

[43:05] Now it's $500.

[43:06] Like it's not cheap, feels like it's,

[43:09] in the world of $1,000 toppers.

[43:14] Oh wow, okay, $20,000 is $350.

[43:17] Okay, Hector, thank you for doing the calculations.

[43:19] Well, we're not even close.

[43:24] Like show of hands,

[43:25] like who of you out there is planning on getting this mod?

[43:30] See, I think that, and Bill is just saying this,

[43:33] I think the more we buy these mods,

[43:37] the more we take the onus off of Stern to do it right.

[43:42] I mean, look at Jersey Jack,

[43:44] look at the piano and Elton John.

[43:46] I think it's insane.

[43:47] Like ain't nobody making that as a mod.

[43:50] Ain't nobody making that as a mod.

[43:51] Like they put the effort in.

[43:53] And I'm sorry,

[43:54] but like the fact that we now have to hack up

[43:56] these expensive Stern games

[43:58] to do the work that they should have done at the factory,

[44:01] I don't know why that excites anybody.

[44:04] I really don't.

[44:06] And I think Stern's starting to rely on the mod community,

[44:09] which is why they've stopped sending out

[44:10] season to CIS letters and stuff.

[44:12] They'd rather you do the work

[44:14] because they'll make money off of your work.

[44:17] Wow, Dutch said they're down to their last five EAs.

[44:21] Larry, what's up brother?

[44:23] Here's my take on Jaws.

[44:25] Here's my take on Jaws.

[44:27] I think Jaws is gonna go down just above Avengers

[44:32] when it comes to an Elwynn game.

[44:35] I don't think it's gonna be what people,

[44:39] I think it's a theme that's very one dimensional.

[44:44] I think it shoots just fine,

[44:46] but it doesn't have wow shots.

[44:51] And I mean that.

[44:52] Avengers is way cooler to watch the ball

[44:55] whiz around in the Avengers game.

[44:58] It's way cooler to shoot Jurassic Park and Godzilla

[45:02] than it is to shoot Jaws.

[45:05] You'll see it when you play Jaws.

[45:07] For some reason, everything is in the back of the game.

[45:11] And the balls often, especially with that upper play field,

[45:15] the balls often disappearing into the upper area

[45:20] of the machine.

[45:21] And yeah, like it's diverting and it's whizzing back

[45:24] and the flow is there and the combos are there,

[45:25] but they're not exhilarating to hit.

[45:30] And there's something about seeing the ball go up a ramp

[45:35] that's exciting, seeing the ball whiz around.

[45:38] I mean, one of the most exciting shots in Elton John

[45:41] is when you have that wire form in the upper left

[45:44] where the rocket shoots it out

[45:45] and it goes around that wire form.

[45:47] It's like watching a little roller coaster under glass.

[45:51] And I think Avengers has a lot of that.

[45:54] I think Godzilla has more of that.

[45:56] And I just think Jaws doesn't have that.

[46:00] So, and again, it's not a bad game.

[46:03] It's just not the game we were waiting for.

[46:06] It's not.

[46:07] And it's not the Jaws under glass

[46:09] any of you thought you were gonna get.

[46:12] It's underwhelming considering who worked on it

[46:17] and what they could have done with the theme.

[46:19] It is, gang, it just is.

[46:22] And so like I think Jaws is going to,

[46:26] it's gonna come and go within the pinball community

[46:29] and not really achieve, I think,

[46:34] like a level of success or adoration

[46:37] that other pins are gonna get.

[46:39] And I think that's okay.

[46:42] Elwyn has been done with this game for a while.

[46:45] He's working on his next game.

[46:47] He's probably working on his next two games.

[46:49] He's so prolific.

[46:50] It's okay, right?

[46:51] I mean, it's not like it doesn't,

[46:52] every game is not gonna be the best game ever made.

[46:56] And I also do believe that Jaws

[46:58] is not a great theme for pinball.

[47:00] But when you do make a Jaws pinball machine

[47:03] where the shark doesn't attack or eat the ball,

[47:06] it's highly embarrassing.

[47:08] I mean, that was like the one thing the game needed to do.

[47:11] The same way in like Star Wars,

[47:13] like if you make a Star Wars game

[47:15] and you're not really using magnets

[47:17] to grab the ball and using the force, you failed.

[47:21] You know, I mean, there's like certain themes where

[47:23] if it doesn't do this, what are we doing here?

[47:26] What are we even doing here?

[47:28] You make a toy story game with no toys in it.

[47:31] Like that failed, right?

[47:33] It's just, there's just needs to be like the thing

[47:36] you expect happening in the game based on the theme.

[47:40] And Jaws doesn't deliver that.

[47:42] It doesn't.

[47:43] You all know it.

[47:44] You all know it.

[47:46] But it's really hard sometimes to be honest

[47:49] about some of this stuff because the Stern army

[47:53] and the Elwyn army, and there's a lot of people

[47:56] that just like will never say anything,

[48:00] lukewarm about him or his efforts.

[48:04] I think the game code will get there in the end,

[48:08] but I just don't see the design as being anything really

[48:11] like mesmerizing or like captivating.

[48:15] Jaws still looks better than any game.

[48:17] I don't agree with that, Nolan.

[48:20] I think there's a lot.

[48:21] I think Deadpool looks better.

[48:23] I think Ghostbusters, when you say looks better,

[48:26] Ghostbusters looks better.

[48:30] I think Foo Fighters looks better.

[48:32] I think Godzilla looks better.

[48:34] I think Jurassic Park doesn't look better, but you know.

[48:40] But look, we're about to get some really sexy looking games

[48:43] coming up.

[48:45] And if the whole movie and its protagonist downfall

[48:50] is a metal object in its mouth with a final shot

[48:53] to set it off.

[48:54] Yeah, I know Bill, right?

[48:55] It's like how Stern did not have a shark with a oxygen tank

[49:02] pop up where you get one shot to blow him up.

[49:05] Labyrinth is sexy.

[49:07] Yeah, man, let's talk about there was a fun for a little bit.

[49:10] You know, like I have not played Labyrinth once.

[49:14] I don't think Jack Barr is getting a Labyrinth.

[49:17] I just look forward to playing it.

[49:19] I think the coolest thing in Labyrinth Gang

[49:21] is that screen at the back of the game.

[49:24] I think putting that screen underneath the glass

[49:28] is probably the best innovation in pinball all year.

[49:31] The fact that they got the topper to owners,

[49:36] right around the time they got their game is very impressive.

[49:40] I think Barrel's of Fun is gonna be,

[49:44] I think they're really gonna be a player in this hobby.

[49:48] And I think they're gonna find this really successful

[49:52] white space of a company that's gonna make around

[49:55] a thousand games a year.

[49:57] And I think they're gonna keep the team small.

[50:01] And I think they're gonna pick themes they know people want.

[50:04] And I think they're gonna put certain companies out of business.

[50:09] Look, there's a reason why when Princess Bride was announced,

[50:13] everybody was wishing it was Barrel's of Fun making it not multi-morphic.

[50:19] You know, and that's just like, that's just it.

[50:23] Like, I mean, I feel bad.

[50:26] I don't feel bad because you know what?

[50:30] I don't get, I don't get Jerry's way out of this.

[50:33] I don't I don't know how Jerry gets.

[50:36] I don't know how Jerry's gonna make it.

[50:38] I don't know Jerry's model.

[50:40] I don't know how it works.

[50:41] I think he's got to get at least a thousand people

[50:45] with multi-morphics out in the world to make developing for that kit,

[50:51] like work, but you know, those homebrew development games are not really.

[50:56] I get it. They're cute. They're funny.

[50:58] But like, they're not, you know, they can't compete on the level

[51:03] of like the other games we're playing.

[51:04] And we all know that.

[51:08] I'm I'm I'm really jazzed.

[51:12] Here's what here. Let me let me be candid.

[51:13] I'm really I'm really excited this year to see the tremendous

[51:17] successes and the tremendous failures of pinball.

[51:20] And I think there's going to be nothing in the middle.

[51:23] I think at these prices, you either have a tremendous hit,

[51:26] like maybe the Matrix, maybe Back to the Future will be it.

[51:30] What we know it will be Alice in Wonderland might be a hit.

[51:34] I think we're going to see tremendous failure,

[51:37] failures like American Pinball's Bobby, why do I say Bobby, Berry, oh game.

[51:43] I think that's going to be a huge failure.

[51:45] If all the rumors are true and American Pinball's next game is a Berry,

[51:49] oh food based game, I think it's going to flop tremendously.

[51:54] I think Princess Bride is going to.

[51:58] I don't know. I don't think it's going to do that well,

[52:02] because again, it's you have to get into the entire platform.

[52:07] There's a lot of talent coming out of the homebrew space, Dave,

[52:10] and they're all ending up at Jersey Jack Pinball.

[52:15] And I think Jersey Jack Pinball, you know, is as David Fix would say,

[52:20] is in it for the long haul.

[52:22] I think Jersey Jack Pinball, it's going to take them 10 years,

[52:28] but I think now that they've got the field down and they've got great licenses lined up,

[52:36] and they've got a lot of talent in house.

[52:39] And if they can just not over complicate their games code wise,

[52:45] and if they can just put a little bit more mechanical, wow,

[52:48] I think Jersey Jack Pinball is going to really grow into itself over the next,

[52:56] you know, few years.

[52:57] And they obviously have to grow into their pricing model.

[53:00] Jengas, man, you missed the greatest show of all time, man.

[53:03] You really did.

[53:04] Like you're here like an hour late.

[53:07] I mean, you wanted fire.

[53:09] I didn't just give fire.

[53:12] I scorched earth in Australia on this podcast.

[53:15] I'm a little out of breath.

[53:16] The reason why I'm so am, hey, I love it.

[53:19] I love it when people are like, it's Chris Coloris of Canados Pinball podcast.

[53:24] You see, that's the new thing.

[53:25] Gang, I hear they're doing the dig on me is they're just they're trying to just call me my

[53:29] full name.

[53:29] It's Chris Coloris of Canados Pinball podcast.

[53:35] Yeah, Chris Coloris is here of Canados Pinball podcast.

[53:40] I love it.

[53:41] I love it.

[53:42] They don't want to call me Canada, you know, it's like he's not Iceman.

[53:46] It's Doug Moe Jr.

[53:48] We should all just go by our real names.

[53:50] Like everybody, it's not Rare Hero.

[53:52] It's Greg Colton.

[53:53] It's not what a WB brand is.

[53:55] It's Bill Brand.

[53:56] It's like there should be like a month where everybody has to go by their full name.

[54:02] Let's let everybody Google image everybody and see who they really are.

[54:07] Like I've never hidden who I am.

[54:09] I've never hidden where I work.

[54:10] I've never hidden what I look like.

[54:13] You know, when you saw the Haggis Thread, you finally got to see that pumpkin guy, right?

[54:17] The one who's been like just cheerleading Haggis all these years.

[54:20] The moment I saw that dude, it was like, all right, now it all makes sense.

[54:23] Now it all makes sense.

[54:27] Is Miracle doing Elton Playfields?

[54:28] Yes, I will say this.

[54:32] Elton John Playfield does dimple like a mofo.

[54:36] It is like it looks like a golf ball.

[54:39] The one at Jack Bar already.

[54:41] Because of the speed of that game and there's a lot of airballs, it's a lot of dimples.

[54:47] Now it doesn't bother me as long as it's not chipping and cracking and stuff like that.

[54:54] I love it, Bill.

[54:55] It's just funny to me like the fact that, you know, they don't want to say Kaneda.

[55:02] It's Terry Hogan, not Hulk Hogan.

[55:04] Terry Hogan's here.

[55:08] Oh my God.

[55:10] In the end, people, in the end, just make sure you get your back to the future order.

[55:17] Oh, and I've already been talking with Melissa and I can tell you Kaneda Club is going to

[55:25] exclusively have some back to the futures to sell and also some Alice in Wonderland machines to sell.

[55:32] Now what I mean by that, you're not getting a discount.

[55:36] You're not getting free shipping from me or anything like that.

[55:38] It just means that these games are going to be hard to get and some of my club members

[55:43] might be able to exclusively get on some of these games.

[55:48] And there might be some SLDs happening and we might hold five of those back for Kaneda Club members

[55:53] as just a thank you for being a member of the Kaneda Club.

[55:58] I don't know why that would upset anybody.

[56:00] Am I controversial?

[56:02] What's controversial about me?

[56:04] What's controversial about Chris Kulwuris?

[56:12] Oh, we were upstairs with Killy and building a snowman.

[56:14] It was so much fun.

[56:16] It was actually fun on the roof because there's nobody up there.

[56:18] The snow accumulated.

[56:19] It's like the perfect snow to pack for snowballs and snowmen.

[56:22] And we built an Olaf on the roof of this building.

[56:27] And yeah, that's why I'm wearing this winter hat.

[56:30] Spies like us people.

[56:34] All right.

[56:35] Let's...

[56:37] What else you guys want to talk about?

[56:39] This has been a great hour.

[56:41] We don't have to go the whole 90 minutes.

[56:44] Thank you guys for no stars today.

[56:46] We only got a few people giving stars.

[56:48] Hilton, what's up, brother?

[56:52] Congratulations, Hilton, on getting one of the...

[56:55] I think the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre is on location.

[57:00] How is it, Hilton?

[57:01] Is it...

[57:03] I mean, I don't know.

[57:04] I'm talking to one of the few people who's been able to jump on it.

[57:10] They have 20 stars, 200 stars.

[57:14] I hope that Jack Barr orders...

[57:18] Greg Bones in the house!

[57:20] Greg, welcome, brother.

[57:23] Everybody's welcome here.

[57:24] There's nobody's band.

[57:25] There...

[57:26] I think I've only banned...

[57:28] I've only banned a few...

[57:29] Happy belated birthday, Greg.

[57:32] Now, Greg, we've been talking about haggis.

[57:34] We've been talking about haggis.

[57:35] And I know it's not...

[57:36] It's not anyone's fault at the distributor level.

[57:40] And as I've said, I just wouldn't have got in bed with Damian.

[57:45] That's it.

[57:46] That's it.

[57:47] I don't blame anybody at the distro level.

[57:49] I just never would have sent Damian money.

[57:52] I knew no one's going to argue with that.

[57:54] That is not a...

[57:55] That is...

[57:55] That is nothing anybody would argue with.

[57:58] It's all on the company.

[58:00] It's all on the company to deliver.

[58:02] You just got to be careful who you trust in the pinball manufacturing space.

[58:08] All right.

[58:08] Flows well.

[58:09] I'm very happy with the launch code also.

[58:10] All right.

[58:11] Good.

[58:11] Good.

[58:13] Well, look, you know, it's going to be...

[58:15] I think what's going to be...

[58:16] I mean, everyone should see what Don says about.

[58:19] He's got both.

[58:20] He's got both games coming.

[58:24] It's going to be interesting.

[58:24] Like, to have both games, like, it's going to be funny to go like,

[58:28] man, like, if you've had your fill of Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

[58:34] to move over one and have the same exact layout for...

[58:37] I mean, look, I give him credit.

[58:40] I give him credit.

[58:42] That was a flex, you know, to go over to Spooky and buy both games at once.

[58:47] I wouldn't personally do that.

[58:49] But it's like owning what?

[58:51] A Shrek and a family guy.

[58:56] You could do it.

[58:57] You could do it.

[59:00] But I think I would own one and play the other on location,

[59:04] especially like, especially if you have access to these games.

[59:08] It seems like Don's got pretty easy access to go play these games on location.

[59:14] Location play gang is going to really pick up.

[59:17] I think we're seeing more and more that...

[59:19] I think at these prices, we're seeing more location play.

[59:22] And I think, you know, it's like freaking A.

[59:27] Just if you get in good with the location too,

[59:30] they'll probably like open up for you a little early and, you know,

[59:36] let you play the game at full volume for an hour.

[59:39] I mean, John will let me do that at Jack Bar if I give him a heads up.

[59:44] You know, I mean, can I come play the game for an hour?

[59:48] Sure.

[59:49] Here's 50 bucks.

[59:51] Go home with $13,000 saved.

[59:54] It's a no-brainer.

[59:58] Yeah, there are a lot of locations popping up.

[01:00:01] I think, you know, look, we're in a post-COVID world.

[01:00:03] People want to get out there.

[01:00:04] They want to enjoy life.

[01:00:05] They want to see stuff in real life.

[01:00:09] I wish New York City was more economical to open up something like that.

[01:00:15] John's got a good setup, but it would be hard to make money with the rent

[01:00:20] in Manhattan on a pinball place.

[01:00:22] Like most of the places are older arcade games.

[01:00:26] Jenguz, come on.

[01:00:27] Jenguz charges $3 a play, Jenguz.

[01:00:31] You're ripping off your Denmark's citizens, brother.

[01:00:35] $3!

[01:00:37] Most expensive place on planet Earth to play pinball is in Denmark.

[01:00:40] He's making a killing.

[01:00:43] Three bucks a play.

[01:00:46] Is it three Denmark dollars?

[01:00:48] Or is that US dollars?

[01:00:50] I don't know if there's a difference.

[01:00:54] I haven't been back to Sunshine since they only have four games now.

[01:01:02] Brand new LE and C for $1 a play.

[01:01:07] Yeah, I don't, just curious, Hilton.

[01:01:09] Like, why put an LE on location?

[01:01:13] To me, that move makes no sense.

[01:01:15] Why shove an LE or a CE into a location environment

[01:01:22] when you could just get a premium?

[01:01:26] There's no reason why.

[01:01:28] There's no reason why.

[01:01:31] Because it's fun.

[01:01:34] You know, I think the craziest is when Al put his Batman super LE

[01:01:40] on location in New York City at Pioneer Bar

[01:01:43] and it was absolutely destroyed.

[01:01:47] Like, there are not 80 Batman SLEs out there.

[01:01:50] There's probably like 73.

[01:01:56] Yeah, I get it, Hilton.

[01:01:57] It's a side hustle.

[01:01:59] We all got good jobs.

[01:02:01] If we didn't have good jobs, well, we wouldn't be here.

[01:02:04] You know, you don't see people making like $35,000 a year,

[01:02:07] like making pinball, like talking about collecting pinball machines.

[01:02:13] I mean, some people, maybe, I don't know.

[01:02:15] You couldn't even do it.

[01:02:16] You couldn't even, you couldn't even buy anything.

[01:02:23] Oh, the playfield protectors.

[01:02:25] I love how they annoy everybody.

[01:02:27] What else is going on?

[01:02:28] Like, Princess Bride on a scale of one to 10,

[01:02:30] how excited are you for Princess Bride people?

[01:02:34] Are you excited?

[01:02:36] What's Jerry going to do with the screen?

[01:02:39] It seems like he's got all the assets.

[01:02:43] I'm curious what the mechs are going to be.

[01:02:47] Damn, it's a harsh.

[01:02:50] Ouch.

[01:02:52] Ouch.

[01:02:56] Ouch.

[01:02:58] Minus four.

[01:03:02] Andre in the game.

[01:03:04] Yeah, I feel like, I don't know if I outbrew it.

[01:03:10] It just, you know, it is about pinball.

[01:03:13] Is you want, you want pinball to be this experience, right?

[01:03:18] You, like, certain movies and themes really lend themselves well

[01:03:21] to creating that world under glass.

[01:03:25] But the experience has to have some high energy

[01:03:28] and some, like, like real, like, wow, magical moments to it.

[01:03:34] And I don't know if, like, Princess Bride's gonna, like, deliver on that.

[01:03:38] Like, I don't know.

[01:03:40] It's why Elton John is, like, even though it's simple in its execution,

[01:03:45] it's just fun to, like, plunge a game and have, like, Rocket Man going.

[01:03:51] Like, it just, it's just, the experience of it works really well.

[01:03:57] Jim Hopper.

[01:03:58] He wasn't killed, Jengus.

[01:03:59] He was skinned alive.

[01:04:02] So that's what story you cook up to Hopper and his men.

[01:04:05] The cabinet minister lies.

[01:04:08] All of it.

[01:04:10] You set this up!

[01:04:15] I feel like I've seen Predator about, like, a thousand times.

[01:04:22] I ain't got time to bleed.

[01:04:24] So why didn't you call in the regular army?

[01:04:27] What do you need with us?

[01:04:28] Because some damn fool accused you of being the best.

[01:04:33] Dylan!

[01:04:35] I mean, it just never gets old.

[01:04:39] Um, look, guys, I think we're gonna, I think we're gonna end this one in a little bit,

[01:04:46] unless you want to keep going for 20 more minutes.

[01:04:48] You let me know.

[01:04:49] I mean, I think I gave so much earlier on in this Facebook Live that I'm, like, I'm exhausted.

[01:04:56] And I'm coming off of a week where I've been really sick.

[01:04:59] I still haven't had much food in me in, like, three days.

[01:05:03] And I need to work all weekend.

[01:05:05] We have a big business pitch we're working on.

[01:05:10] Working on, I can't tell you, but it's, I don't know if we're gonna win it.

[01:05:17] We'll see.

[01:05:17] New business is interesting.

[01:05:20] You do your best.

[01:05:21] I mean, you don't, you don't know.

[01:05:23] You don't, you just don't know.

[01:05:26] Um, I think it was a good show today.

[01:05:28] I think it's, we're gonna, we're gonna have more, more to talk about this week.

[01:05:34] Gang, look, have a great weekend.

[01:05:37] And I want to just summarize everything I've been saying though, real quick, like,

[01:05:42] I know that we're here because we love Pinball and we love the community and we love how this

[01:05:50] box of lights brings all of these unique people together in such a fun way.

[01:05:56] And here's the thing.

[01:05:58] Here's the thing.

[01:05:59] While we definitely are excited by new Pinball, more times than not, new companies

[01:06:07] have thrown their hat into the ring and they've taken money and they don't really know

[01:06:14] how to run a pinball manufacturing company.

[01:06:19] Three guesses.

[01:06:20] What are the next three spooky games?

[01:06:22] I, I think that Ben Heck is working on Evil Dead.

[01:06:34] And from there, Hilton, I haven't,

[01:06:40] I haven't really heard of anything other than, you know, I mean, we always get the

[01:06:44] nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead.

[01:06:48] And you know, spooky's done a nice mix of like, comedy.

[01:06:50] So I would maybe something in the, I would, another comedy theme.

[01:06:56] They've been doing well with cartoons.

[01:06:59] So I mean, I like, I would love it if spooky got He-Man.

[01:07:03] I mean, I feel like everyone thinks He-Man is stern and then it was supposed to be American

[01:07:06] Pinball.

[01:07:09] But, no, we'll see.

[01:07:14] Uh, isn't, you know what we didn't talk about?

[01:07:20] Isn't there an all new company making little shop of horrors?

[01:07:28] Did, didn't, didn't Jason Map write that?

[01:07:32] That an all new company, Hilton, good.

[01:07:40] Are you excited for Back to the Future?

[01:07:45] Look, it's, it's a good time to be in the hobby.

[01:07:48] You know, I look with the, you know, like Hilton's excitement has me excited.

[01:07:53] There's just, there's only so much space and there's only so much money, right?

[01:07:57] And I think that's where everything is at.

[01:07:59] I think ultimately we're going to be pulling the trigger on, we're only going to want to

[01:08:05] own games that we want to keep forever.

[01:08:07] I mean, I really think that's what Pinball is going to turn into at these prices and

[01:08:12] everything else will play on location.

[01:08:14] Everything else, we will play at shows.

[01:08:16] Everything else, we will play at a friend's house.

[01:08:17] But unless you really want to own it forever, you're not going to be buying games at

[01:08:22] not at these prices with the stuff coming out.

[01:08:25] And for a game to move out of your house, something really magical has to be made.

[01:08:31] The big challenges, all these manufacturers out there,

[01:08:35] they need to sell product.

[01:08:36] They need to keep the line going.

[01:08:38] So that's why I think there's going to be tremendous successes and tremendous failures

[01:08:43] in this entire hobby.

[01:08:45] And the place I love is on the sidelines to just watch.

[01:08:50] And when something really hits that checks the boxes,

[01:08:54] then I'll open up my checkbook.

[01:08:56] But until then, I'm happy.

[01:08:59] I'm happy to not buy games every month.

[01:09:02] I'm happy to go to Jack Bar,

[01:09:04] spend 20 bucks on an Elton John, have a few drinks, come home, order dinner,

[01:09:11] go to bed, wake up with money.

[01:09:13] All right, everybody, be good.

[01:09:15] I'll give you another minute for stars.

[01:09:17] I mean, it's been bad.

[01:09:18] 1600 stars.

[01:09:20] We used to be like 10,000 stars.

[01:09:23] I used to be somebody when I lit the Pimbal World on fire.

[01:09:33] You know, I will say, I got asked, I'll tell you the truth.

[01:09:38] I got asked Colin asked somebody to ask me to stop making fun of him.

[01:09:44] Do you know this?

[01:09:45] This is a true story.

[01:09:47] He didn't want to reach out to me.

[01:09:49] He reached out to somebody else and said, stop making fun of me.

[01:09:52] Can you ask Anita to stop making fun of me?

[01:09:56] Okay.

[01:09:57] And then you know what I said?

[01:10:00] Because I said I'm not going to make fun of any other content creators other than Colin.

[01:10:03] I said, I'll stop making fun of you when you reinstate me to the database.

[01:10:11] And I'm still not on there.

[01:10:14] He lists every single Pimbal content creator but me.

[01:10:18] Hmm.

[01:10:19] Hmm.

[01:10:20] Huh.

[01:10:25] It's real simple.

[01:10:26] Just put me on the list.

[01:10:28] I'm an internet bully.

[01:10:29] I know.

[01:10:30] All 165 pounds of me coming at everybody.

[01:10:36] As Malcolm X said, I could beat them with my mind more than I can beat them with my body.

[01:10:44] Everybody have a great Saturday.

[01:10:47] This was a lot of fun.

[01:10:48] Thank you for getting my energy levels to the roof.

[01:10:51] We'll be back next Saturday.

[01:10:53] Lots of good podcasts coming this week.

[01:10:55] So thank you for being a member of the club.

[01:10:58] All right, everybody, we'll be back.

[01:11:00] Get to the chopper.

[01:11:02] Sorry, Damien.

[01:11:04] You should have just made the games like you said you would.

[01:11:08] I was going to turn a corner if you got all those fathoms made in January.

[01:11:12] Like you said you would.

[01:11:14] I'm going to go back right now and recapitalize Canadian Pimbal podcast.

[01:11:18] 

[01:11:28] Whoo!

[01:11:28] I refuse

[01:11:32] refuse
