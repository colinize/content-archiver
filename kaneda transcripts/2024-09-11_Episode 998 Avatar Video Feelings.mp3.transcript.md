[00:00] Captain Miro, Senbukane, Bukane.

[00:05] Senbukane, Senbukane, Senbukane, Senbukane, Senbukane.

[00:30] I don't know, I would just have to say after reading people's comments today, I still think

[00:50] everyone is somewhere in the middle.

[00:53] I know I am, I'm like I don't know if I've seen enough to be truly concerned, but I also

[00:59] didn't see anything that just blew me away.

[01:03] Now it's just a 30 second teaser, but we did see everything that's on the play field and

[01:10] we got to see like some mechanisms or lack of mechanisms.

[01:15] We got a lot of wire forms.

[01:17] We've got two like lower play fields or windows looking underneath the play field.

[01:23] There's a buck, there's ramps that like lift up.

[01:26] I think this game, when I look at it, it's really going to sort of create that going

[01:32] from under the ocean coming up into the sky.

[01:36] I think there's going to be a lot of up, down and around happening in this game.

[01:42] I just, I just can't quite put my finger on it, but I was just hoping for a little bit

[01:49] more.

[01:50] Wow.

[01:51] I was hoping to see something that was like, I haven't seen that before.

[01:57] And I'm going to see a lot more of this game on Friday.

[02:00] We're going to see a lot more of this game on Thursday, but now we know that Stern Pimbal

[02:07] is going to stream X-Men tomorrow.

[02:10] So the battle over these two new Pimbal machines, it's kind of interesting to see these two

[02:15] companies go back and forth.

[02:18] And if I had to pick a winner so far, I would say that Stern's X-Men is presenting better

[02:26] so far.

[02:28] Now, that being said, I do think Jersey Jack's Avatar, it's going to be difficult to capture

[02:37] that game's like unique UV lighting and the way it's going to go from twilight to sort

[02:44] of daylight back and forth.

[02:46] I don't really feel like they're going to be able to capture that in video form.

[02:51] I think it's going to be something you're going to have to stand over the machine to

[02:54] truly appreciate it.

[02:57] Where is the upper playfield?

[02:58] Someone is asking me right now.

[03:00] It's interesting to do a podcast and have people commenting at the same time.

[03:04] I don't know.

[03:05] That's the other thing.

[03:06] I'm like, where are the upper playfields?

[03:08] How do you not make an upper playfield where like the banshee grabs the ball and brings

[03:16] it to the Hallelujah Mountains?

[03:18] I just feel like when I look down at this game, a lot of it is based on the second Avatar

[03:26] movie, not the first.

[03:28] And I do feel like that might be a mistake because I do think the first movie is really

[03:35] the iconic one that everybody remembers the most.

[03:39] The second film came out, didn't really hit like the first.

[03:43] Now obviously I think there was probably pressure from the studio to sort of highlight

[03:49] the new movie.

[03:50] And so that's why I think we're getting a lot more happening underneath the playfield.

[03:55] Let me try and screen share right now and we're going to look at this game and let me

[04:00] give my thoughts on the deconstruction of that video.

[04:05] And maybe we should watch the video first right now.

[04:08] So I'm going to play right now the 34 second trailer of the Battle for Pandora.

[04:16] Like really, really quick cuts there.

[04:20] When I first saw it, I was incapable of really processing what I just saw.

[04:27] And I don't know if that works.

[04:29] I don't know if those quick cuts got anybody truly excited about anything they were seeing

[04:35] there.

[04:36] So after 34 seconds, I was left a little underwhelmed.

[04:40] I did feel confident that people were going to like grab screenshots of everything and

[04:45] they did.

[04:46] And I know Jason Knapp put them all up right now.

[04:49] So I'm going to go over to Jason Knapp's site right now.

[04:51] Let's look at these images.

[04:53] So these are the most detailed images of Avatar so far.

[04:56] So we've got the Ellie and the CE edition of the game.

[05:01] They both have blue armor.

[05:03] They look very similar.

[05:05] The CE has that armor that has multiple colors on it.

[05:10] Sort of like the skin of the characters in Avatar.

[05:13] We've got the female character, the back box on the CE with her eyes over the logo looks

[05:20] absolutely incredible.

[05:22] Then we've got this sort of really large topper on the CE that's got screens.

[05:28] I don't think these are leftover screens from Toy Story 4.

[05:33] We know they repurpose them with the Elton John topper, but I think it's an all original

[05:38] new topper that's going to be communicating a lot of information to the player.

[05:43] And then we've got this sort of over the top UV lit version of the game.

[05:50] And this is what I mean by I'm not sure how this is going to feel.

[05:54] It's got this like bi-illuminescent feel to it, but my thing with it is this.

[05:59] I just was hoping there was going to be a little bit more wow.

[06:05] There was going to be a major mechanism like the Trial Life that had the branches and the

[06:11] leaves and maybe like fiber optic sort of lighting to do something unique there.

[06:17] I don't just don't get that sensation of like movement and sort of that organic nature of

[06:26] the worlds of Avatar and Pandora.

[06:30] And I'm not sure that the UV in this game is going to have the same effect that we saw

[06:36] in Stranger Things.

[06:38] And so, you know, we'll have to see.

[06:40] I mean, when I stand over this game, I will have to see now looking at the artwork, you

[06:45] know, flat plastics, you know, not surprising.

[06:48] Jersey Jack hasn't been doing scopes on the sling plastics.

[06:52] You've got this Banshee and this Wireform, lots of Wireforms, lots of flippers.

[06:58] And then there's like this under the play field sort of like mini play field area where

[07:04] there looks like there's a crab and two flippers.

[07:09] You know, I don't know.

[07:11] Now this image of the upper portion of the game is the one I've been looking at a lot.

[07:17] Because when I look at this and I see Wireforms, I see small sculpts of the sort of Hallelujah

[07:25] Mountains, they're really, really small.

[07:27] I see this large vertical up kick over here to the left.

[07:31] Here's what I don't see.

[07:33] I don't see anything that is making my jaw drop.

[07:38] I see this like robotic exoskeleton mech.

[07:41] I saw the arm move up and down, but it looks like a really cheap McFarlane toy that they

[07:47] just found a way to animate, but nothing.

[07:51] And I mean this, nothing in this game right now as I look at the different angles of it,

[07:56] I just don't see a single wow mechanism in the game.

[08:02] And when I think about a single wow mechanism in the game, I'm going to pop over right now

[08:06] and look at X-Men, the uncanny X-Men.

[08:09] I mean just looking down at X-Men next to Avatar, not only is X-Men just an explosion

[08:16] of color and X-Men comic coming at you, you've got this ginormous sentinel mechanism that

[08:23] is the major element of the game and it's like undeniable that X-Men I think comes at

[08:31] you with sort of like OMG a lot more than Avatar does right now.

[08:37] I think the thing is this, as I look at Avatar and then I look at Wizard of Oz, I pulled

[08:43] up Wizard of Oz and I looked at that game right 11 years ago.

[08:47] 11 years ago when you really look at, and I'm going to share a screen again, when you

[08:52] really look at what Jersey Jack put into their games, it's really hard.

[08:58] It's really hard to look at Wizard of Oz and see two upper play fields, the witch that

[09:05] goes up and down, the spinning house, you've got the flying freaking monkey, you've got

[09:11] the upper play field doors that open up, you've got the pop bumper trees, you've got the crystal

[09:17] ball, you've also got the sort of like the little screen to the right was, you've got

[09:21] the state fairs sculpt, it's just this 3D world, the ruby red slippers and I get it,

[09:28] I get it, I know that like Avatar is much more advanced than the Wizard of Oz, but I'm

[09:34] just not seeing anything right now.

[09:38] That sort of jumps out.

[09:40] There's just nothing that's popping off that play field that's really like take my money

[09:46] now and that doesn't mean the game's not going to shoot well.

[09:49] It doesn't mean the game's not going to be like awesome to play.

[09:53] It doesn't mean it's not going to have great flow, but I mean, I can't believe though that

[09:57] Jersey Jack, even in that little video, every time we saw gameplay, it was like multi-ball

[10:05] and if there's one thing that nobody wants to see in a game that Kiefer is coding is

[10:12] more multi-ball.

[10:13] We're going to see more on Thursday, I'm going to go out there and play it on Friday, we're

[10:18] going to get Uncanny X-Men on Wednesday.

[10:21] It's a lot, it's a lot of overload, it's a lot of stuff at once and I really wish in

[10:28] this sea of teasers we've been getting now for two weeks, I think they need to tease

[10:33] the date by which they're going to drop it and reveal it, but you really only get one

[10:38] chance to reveal a game and on the day that Jersey Jack is revealing Avatar, you can't

[10:45] even buy the game because this is still not like the reveal.

[10:50] The reveal is on Thursday, so we're still in this like teaser 30 second video, but you've

[10:56] basically shown enough for people to get excited and to not get excited and in the world of

[11:04] Pimbal, when you finally pull the curtain off, you really want those order banks to be open,

[11:10] you don't want to give people a few days to think about it because when you have a few

[11:14] days to think about it, you're most likely going to talk yourself out of getting one,

[11:20] not into getting one.

[11:22] So we're going to see what happens, is the X-Men stream going to be so amazing that the

[11:27] remaining LEDs are all going to sell out instantly?

[11:30] I don't know, I don't know, but I'm really at the point now, everybody where Jersey

[11:35] Jack has really, since Guns N' Roses had a launch, that really blew us away and Guns

[11:45] N' Roses and even when I look at Guns N' Roses, just the play field just felt like

[11:49] it had more of a creative vision, felt like it had more passion in it.

[11:55] And I'm not saying Mark Sidon's not passionate about Avatar, but I just feel like the subject

[12:01] matter is difficult to nail and what they're bringing to life isn't anything you and I

[12:08] have dreamed about being in a Pimbal machine.

[12:10] So I think it's going to be a game that does not sort of sell out at all.

[12:17] I don't think they're going to sell, if they make a thousand CEs, I don't think they're

[12:22] going to sell very well.

[12:24] A thousand at 15k a pop just feels like a non-starter.

[12:28] And if the same exact game is in the LE and that's 12, I don't know, even as I think about

[12:36] they want that topper to be communicating stuff, I've owned Guns N' Roses now for months,

[12:42] I never look up there.

[12:43] I mean, it's too high.

[12:45] It's too high to have a topper communicate vital information for gameplay.

[12:50] I think it's just going to be more about something visually stunning versus something that's a

[12:55] different game mode or something unique to the CE.

[12:59] That's my thoughts, you know, more to come on it, not a game that is blowing me away,

[13:04] but not a game that is concerning me that much.

[13:08] I just don't see the mix.

[13:10] I don't know if it has magic or not, but I don't see the mechanical engineering.

[13:16] Now look, I bet when you lift up this game with those lower playfields and diverters

[13:22] and subways and Vux and all that stuff, I think we're going to see more in it.

[13:27] Definitely more underneath this playfield from a physical standpoint than Elton John,

[13:32] but I think Jersey Jack is just at this interesting crossroads with the entire hobby.

[13:40] They just really needed a hit right now.

[13:43] They really needed a game to get everybody to see what they're capable of, and I don't

[13:51] feel like this is going to be it.

[13:53] And I might be wrong, and I'm going to go play it, and I'm going to see how I feel when

[13:58] I play it, but man, I want it matrix right now.

[14:01] I want it Beetlejuice.

[14:03] I want it Fifth Element.

[14:04] I want it Akira.

[14:06] I want it Transformers G1.

[14:08] I just think they needed something where the theme alone was enough to give you money.

[14:13] I just don't think they have that here.

[14:16] So we'll see what happens.

[14:18] Obviously, we're going to do a lot more shows this week.

[14:20] Brenda, I'm sorry.

[14:21] Brenda's like walking up the stairs.

[14:22] This is the last time I do this.

[14:23] I don't normally do it live.

[14:24] It wouldn't be a problem.

[14:25] Brenda did not know I was doing it live.

[14:27] I normally am just recording on Audacity.

[14:30] I thought it would be fun to go live and see how this works.

[14:33] It's actually a lot more difficult to do it this way.

[14:37] We're just going to do lives the way we do it on Saturday morning and keep it live only

[14:41] and not try to do a podcast and a live as two kids are trying to be put to bed, and

[14:48] we live in an open layout house.

[14:50] It just doesn't work.

[14:52] The other thing I want to just talk about is X-Men for a little bit, right?

[14:56] And then we'll end the show.

[14:57] So X-Men's got a really creative layout, really unique, and I'm not sure that's going to work

[15:05] for everybody.

[15:06] And we are creatures of comfort.

[15:08] We complain a lot about pinball machines, but let's face it.

[15:12] We want a game that shoots really well, and a lot of times it's easier to walk up to a

[15:17] game where the layout is somewhat familiar.

[15:20] Two flippers at the bottom.

[15:22] Everything's going south to north.

[15:24] Now we've got these three flippers right at the bottom of X-Men.

[15:29] Is that going to be rewarding for people?

[15:31] Are you going to get tired of that?

[15:34] Seeing that second left flipper, that little flipper always going off whenever you're flipping

[15:41] the left side of the game, is that going to be rewarding?

[15:45] Is that mini playfield that danger room going to be exciting?

[15:49] Is letting that ball sort of go through the orbit in the bottom right, swinging around

[15:53] to the left, it looks really cool.

[15:56] It looks really cool, but will it be really fun after 500 plays?

[16:02] So we shall see.

[16:03] I think just both games, just looking at both of them and saying who's winning so far.

[16:10] The battle between X-Men and Avatar.

[16:13] Two themes, by the way, that nobody really, really was dying for.

[16:18] People didn't want more Marvel, and people didn't really want Avatar.

[16:22] I don't think either company has the juggernaut theme, no pun intended with juggernaut being

[16:28] in the game, but neither company has the instant winner on theme.

[16:33] So when we get to integration, and we get to which machine is just presenting itself

[16:38] better within the first week of reveal, it is obviously X-Men.

[16:44] Now look, when they revealed X-Men, they gave us a lot more information.

[16:49] We're going to get that on Thursday.

[16:51] But I think these companies are learning.

[16:53] If you're going to do these teaser campaigns, and your competitors are doing something similar,

[16:59] you've got to be able to pivot in real time.

[17:02] If Stern drops this much information on X-Men, you're not going to be able to hold back and

[17:09] just do these little pictures every day.

[17:12] You're going to lose out.

[17:14] I think Jersey Jack might have waited too long, and a lot of people have ordered X-Men

[17:19] and Ali already are all sales final.

[17:21] I don't think so.

[17:22] If you want to transfer over your X-Men deposit to a dealer that also sells Avatar, I'm sure

[17:29] they will do that for you.

[17:30] Everybody, look, it's a really crazy time in pinball.

[17:34] The prices are really high.

[17:36] I'm not sure any of these games are worth it to be honest, but we're getting better.

[17:41] This is a good game by Stern.

[17:43] This game looks like they made a real effort.

[17:46] Jersey Jack, it feels better than Toy Story.

[17:49] It feels better than Godfather.

[17:52] Not sure it feels as cohesive as Elton John does, but it does feel like there's more

[17:58] in it.

[17:59] Problem with Jersey Jack, yeah, there's more in it, but man, it doesn't feel anywhere near

[18:04] what we got with Pirates and with Waz and even with Hobbit.

[18:09] I still think Jersey Jack struggles a little bit because historically, the machines were

[18:15] loaded.

[18:16] When people look at Avatar and say it's loaded, I don't think it's loaded.

[18:20] I really don't.

[18:21] I think there's a lot of uniqueness in it, but it doesn't strike me as a game where

[18:27] the bomb is back to what it used to be.

[18:29] Just doesn't have that vibe right now.

[18:32] Now, look, we're going to learn a lot more.

[18:35] Everybody have a good night.

[18:37] Don't kill yourselves online arguing about politics as we get to the presidential debate

[18:42] tonight.

[18:43] But more to come this week.

[18:45] I might have to do like a show every day with all the different pinball news that's happening,

[18:49] talking about X-Men tomorrow.

[18:51] Then we're going to get the 20 minute deep dive on Avatar on Thursday and then I fly

[18:55] to Jersey Jack.

[18:56] It's going to be a very interesting three days in pinball.

[18:59] I look forward to covering all of it and thank you for being a subscriber to Canada's Pinball

[19:05] podcast.

[19:06] All right.
