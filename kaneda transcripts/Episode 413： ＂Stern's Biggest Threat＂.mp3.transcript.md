[00:00] Feels like a rainy day and I'm just sort of watching everything going on in the

[00:07] pinball hobby. Listening to all these pinball podcasts and all we're talking

[00:12] about right now. Toppers, under cabinet lighting, signature plates, collector's

[00:21] additions, signature additions, pieces of couches, $15,000 games, $12,500 games. I

[00:32] know we're not talking about amazing mechanisms. We're not talking about

[00:37] seeing a ball do something we've never seen before. We're not talking about

[00:42] dream themes. We've sort of lost in this weird place of like all that matters is

[00:51] cosmetic junk that they're ripping us off for. You know what? We're going to talk

[00:57] on this episode about Canadian pinball podcasts. Who we think can actually

[01:02] challenge Stern to become number two in pinball. And then we're going to talk

[01:08] about deep root and what they're doing and how I think they're falling into the

[01:12] same trap that everyone falls into. And then we're going to talk about what I

[01:17] think is the number one threat for Stern pinball. Are we ready? Let's do it.

[01:47] Welcome to episode 413 of the world's most negative pinball podcast. I'm your

[02:00] host, Canada. We're going to talk about those three topics on this episode of

[02:05] Canada's pinball podcast. And we will prove that you can talk a lot about pinball

[02:09] without taking up a lot of time. So we're going to talk about the you know

[02:13] these these conversations lately on what is the predominant conversation in

[02:18] pinball. And it's kind of sad to me and we'll talk about it that we've sort of

[02:22] we've moved outside of the world under glass. And now we're looking at all the

[02:27] cosmetic things that can be tacked on to a pinball machine as being the value

[02:33] proposition with these high end machines. We're going to talk about that. We're

[02:37] going to talk about deep root pinball because we know in a couple weeks it's

[02:41] a little bit of put up or shut up time for deep root. Is it not? And then we're

[02:45] going to talk about what I think is Stern's biggest challenge. And also who I

[02:50] think can be the number two pinball manufacturer in the pinball world. How's that

[02:54] for a Canada's pinball podcast episode 400 I think in 13. But first we want to

[03:00] wish a very very special friend of the show. A much a much deserved

[03:06] congratulations to Greg Colton Mr. Rare Hero on his new baby girl that was

[03:12] born on October 31st and no he did not name her Elvira because she was born on

[03:18] Halloween. Opal is her name. Greg congratulations my friend always a big

[03:23] friend of the show. Super happy to hear the news. Okay so let's jump right into

[03:28] this because you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a pinball podcast these

[03:32] days. Might include it in which the news is all about like who's got the better

[03:37] top or who's got the better value right for the money. And with all of these

[03:43] games now costing a lot of money. It is not surprising that we are looking at

[03:48] these games and saying hey is it worth $3,000 more to get the collector's

[03:53] edition of Willy Wonka over the limited. You know is Elvira worth $15,000 if

[03:59] only 50 are made and I really I really want to talk from the heart right now

[04:04] and and you know this this is this is all with a caveat that this is a

[04:10] subjective thing and when we talk about value and price we we talk about it a lot

[04:14] and you can't avoid it because we are now in a hobby in which there are a lot of

[04:20] titles that are getting upwards of $10,000 plus and that is insane. These

[04:26] games are now costing almost three times what they did 10 years ago and so we

[04:33] should look at them with a little bit more of a critical eye of are we getting

[04:37] what we pay for. Okay now I look you know me I love a good topper I love a sexy

[04:42] game I love you know games that pop visually from an artistic standpoint and so I

[04:48] don't have a problem with where we're at in pinball I mean I love seeing stuff

[04:52] like the medieval madness topper I love how these companies have to compete

[04:57] with each other in terms of creating the most visually spectacular versions of

[05:03] these games but here's my main thing right now why are our expectations so low

[05:10] of what a company can do when they add an additional $3,000 price to a game so

[05:17] let me let me break it down like this for $3,000 why can a company add another

[05:24] mechanism to the game why can't they well you think about that for a minute how

[05:30] much money would it cost to add an additional mech to a game could they do it for

[05:37] $3,000 because then my head starts to go to a space like they made an entire

[05:42] Lord of the Rings pinball machine every single thing and sold it to us for

[05:48] below $4,000 so when you're adding $3,000 from Willy Wonka Ellie to see why are

[05:57] the only options we have now why are the only things they're thinking about

[06:01] developing are just stick on items that do absolutely zero for gameplay zero and

[06:10] so but we're all we're all now being told that that's all they can do they

[06:14] can't add more and I'm here to tell you right now that I really wish that for

[06:21] the amount of extra money people are spending on these limited or collectors or

[06:26] or signature edition games would actually come with a unique gameplay experience

[06:33] I do think it's kind of sad and I'm saying that's a someone who's looking at a

[06:37] game in which the only real differentiator from a gameplay perspective is an

[06:43] audio file of Adam West saying people's names and same is true with Willy

[06:48] Wonka with Rook Assault but I think for the amount of money we're spending we

[06:53] should start asking for more physical things under the glass that we get for

[07:00] the money and you know even if it's not a new mechanism how about Jersey Jack

[07:07] adds all of those great pinball mods that the community has made into the game

[07:11] so you don't have to go then buy them on top of the twelve thousand five hundred

[07:16] dollars you're spending I mean no game needed it more than Batman with all the

[07:20] mod couple mods that were made for the game but you see what I'm saying is like

[07:24] we're spending all this money and we are basically getting just tack on stuff

[07:29] and when I hear us as a as a community like we're we're discussing under

[07:35] cabinet lighting and a topper to determine whether or not it's worth it for

[07:41] three thousand dollars and we know it's not we know it's not and I'm just saying

[07:46] I think these manufacturers could do more but they won't do more as long as we

[07:52] keep buying all of these high end games and look Elvira selling out for fifteen

[07:57] thousand dollars shows me that they just won't do anything more what's sad

[08:02] about it is this the difference between Elvira Ellie and Elvira signature

[08:09] edition is five thousand dollars so you could buy an Elvira Ellie and put and

[08:16] put next to it a tron pro for the same price or any stern pro machine basically

[08:23] an entire game is worth of R&D and cost could be next to it instead you're

[08:29] getting a little piece of couch okay so can we start asking for more from these

[08:33] manufacturers when they get above ten grand thank you very much ladies and

[08:37] gentlemen we can do it together all right so let's talk about deep root so

[08:41] here's what's gonna happen in about ten days deep root has to finally show us

[08:49] something and we've been pretty light on deep root and for reasons that are

[08:55] simple to understand they have taken no pre-order money so because nobody has

[09:01] money on the line even though they filled the pinball world with tons of

[09:05] hyperbole right they they bragged about how much of an impact they were going to

[09:10] have in 2019 albeit they were a hundred percent wrong on that impact but they

[09:16] haven't taken any money and the other thing they said they were going to do

[09:20] was give the zidware complaints or the zidware buyers a chance to get some

[09:26] money back or stay with a game and they gave money back to anyone who asked for a

[09:32] refund so even though they didn't accomplish any of their manufacturing goals in

[09:38] 2019 they did stay true to their word and they did give money back now giving

[09:44] people a refund that they were not even responsible for those zidware

[09:49] customers we have to applaud them for that because if you think about the rest of

[09:54] the pinball world and the new manufacturers that came out took people's money

[09:58] and then refused to give refunds remember remember good old Kevin Coolick who

[10:03] had a chance to just do the right thing even if he gave people fifty cents back

[10:08] to the dollar it would have been better than what he did which is spent at all

[10:11] and then got away with it he never gave people refunds and you highway struggle

[10:16] to give people refunds we know Barry a Dutch struggle to give people refunds

[10:20] so this company has done right in that aspect okay but but here's where I

[10:25] think deepwood is falling into a trap and I think they're doing and again I

[10:31] don't know very much but here's where I think the mistake lies Robert is smart

[10:36] he knows this industry he knows how to launch a game the right way he's

[10:41] studied it he can see all the good examples of how you do it you don't show an

[10:46] unfinished game okay so to me that is like mistake number one you just don't do

[10:51] that and so that is why I don't understand why we're gonna get you know and it's

[10:56] curious what it's gonna be because if you listen to to his statement it's not

[11:00] final artwork it's not a final designed game I would this could just be like a

[11:05] a white wood with a with a mechanism on it just to test the mechanism right this

[11:11] I don't even know what we're gonna see with these rosy machines are are going

[11:15] to be anything more than just a white wood version of a game and I don't even

[11:19] know if it's gonna be like a white wood because I don't even know if the game

[11:24] is going to be on wood okay I think we could see it on something else we'll see

[11:29] because that sledgehammer might be able to go through a piece of wood so we're

[11:34] we are going to see like a half baked version of a game after they've been

[11:39] working on rasa for two years now that's just two years of him working on

[11:45] rasa John Papaduke was also working on rasa for years magic girl was worked on

[11:50] for five years and the earliest we're gonna see magic girl is 2021 right I mean

[11:56] that these these time frames are insanely long and I think he's probably

[12:02] learning how much harder it is to become a pinball manufacturer right so it I'll

[12:09] never understand what led them to have that expo talk a year ago in which they

[12:13] bragged about what they were gonna do in 2019 but here's mistake number two before

[12:18] you prove you can make game number one before you prove you can put a game in a

[12:23] box and finish title number one they are also going to release a a animation

[12:30] video of game number two that we are being told will be the nicest animation

[12:35] video in pinball history and I'm sure it will be because here's why we don't

[12:40] play pinball for animations this is not a game on a screen this is a game below

[12:48] the glass it's a game in a box that's about physical interacting with a ball and

[12:54] and I think what Robert is doing and I think what deepwood is doing and I don't

[12:59] I don't know what they're doing yet but I'm just saying that pinball is not

[13:04] about what's on the screen it's not it really isn't a lot of recent pinball has

[13:10] become a focus of what's on the screen because of the lack of mechanical stuff in

[13:16] the games so when stern yanks out mechanical stuff and games get really

[13:20] bearing like black night then all of it's about the screen right I mean think about

[13:25] black night for a minute you're battling monsters where the monsters any

[13:28] physical monsters on the game nope they're all on the screen and yes the

[13:33] animations have become very nice in pinball but they're not even close to the

[13:38] animations we see in the video game world they're not even close and so I don't

[13:43] understand the desire to spend a lot of effort on animations when that's not

[13:49] really what pinball people want because if we're truly honest and you love

[13:54] pinball and you play pinball frequently tell me how much can you actually look

[14:00] up at a screen how much when you're playing a game can you see a top or I

[14:05] mean I heard people on podcasts today being like the toppers are so cool and

[14:09] interactive you you barely I don't even notice the Batman top are going off

[14:14] ever ever you don't really notice many toppers any of them I think the only one

[14:19] maybe attack from ours because damn thing is shaking but for the most part the

[14:23] game is below the glass and so for them to boast that we're gonna see the

[14:28] nicest animations I would say to them show me the nicest pinball machine show

[14:34] me pinball magic show me an incredible game and design under the glass I don't

[14:40] care I don't care to see like fancy rasa intro videos I want to see a magical

[14:47] pinball game and if it has amazing animations that's icing on the cake but

[14:53] don't show us the icing until you prove to me you can actually make a good

[14:58] cake and I think that's kind of where deep roots at I think we've seen enough of

[15:03] of like companies boasting about the polish but not being able to make the

[15:11] actual thing right I mean John Papadik was the master of that he polished a

[15:17] game that wasn't even mechanically sound he had all the artwork he paraded the

[15:22] artwork around he made his all fall in love with the outside parts of the cake

[15:28] right the icing on magic girl was the most delicious to look at and then you

[15:33] actually went to take a bite and it was like a cardboard cake with beautiful

[15:38] icing and and I just hope that this company doesn't fall into that right and I

[15:45] see them making these mistakes talking about game two before game one is even

[15:49] shown showing game one before it's complete showing anything when now the new

[15:54] timeline is not sometime into 2020 like we're talking like it sounds like

[16:00] they're not going to ship anything until summer of 2020 all right so we'll

[16:05] see a lot is going to come on deeper to the next couple weeks but the pressure

[16:09] must be mounting on these guys to deliver something something not to like not

[16:16] not to because no one has any money in on them yet the pressure is really this

[16:20] and this is like this is all it's about the pressure is on them not to become

[16:25] the laughing stock of the pinball world and the only reason they would be

[16:30] laughed at significantly is because of all the hyperbole that they told us they

[16:36] were gonna do so I hope they can deliver on that hyperbole but they've raised

[16:42] the bar unnecessarily in all of our minds and now they better deliver so I

[16:47] expect huge things in November and if if the stuff that we see is underwhelming

[16:53] I think they're going to be forgotten quickly unless they can really you know

[16:59] wow us and you know me I want to be wowed with mechanisms not with animations

[17:05] all right so here's what I want to talk about next I want to talk about who do we

[17:10] think become number two in pinball so 2020 without a doubt will be dominated by

[17:15] Stern Pimball I think Stern Pimball is gonna have a 2020 I think it's gonna be

[17:19] Stern's best year in the last five years and I mean that and I think they

[17:23] are going to have juggernaut titles but I think they're actually gonna nail the

[17:27] gameplay too I think they've fumbled Star Wars I think that they've had like

[17:32] B-level titles with monsters Deadpool you know Jurassic Park I think is an A

[17:39] title but not based on the movie you know there's still Jurassic Park at least

[17:43] for sale it hasn't really flown off the shelf I'm gonna talk a little bit about

[17:47] why I think that is it's not about the game itself it's about another factor in

[17:50] pinball right now but who's number two like who do you think is giving Stern the

[17:57] run for the money in 2020 is it gonna be Jersey Jack pinball so we know 2020

[18:02] for Jersey Jack we should see two games guns and roses and toy story and he's

[18:08] also probably gonna still be selling Willy Wonka's so Jack will have maybe maybe

[18:13] three games available new in box which would be great because I really do want to

[18:18] see Jersey Jack pinball give people options now I don't think guns and roses

[18:23] regardless of Eric's magic and it will be magical because he knows what he's

[18:27] doing I don't think guns and roses is going to have the amount of attention

[18:33] that toy story would have just because I think that when you start making music

[18:37] pins there's no way around the fact either you're a fan of the music or you're

[18:42] not and guns and roses as much as I love them and they are huge they are a bit

[18:47] of a polarizing band and they are band that peaked very early and they pretty

[18:53] much haven't had any relevant music since 1992 people that's a long time I

[19:02] mean they kind of are a classic act but I still do love you know everything

[19:07] acts will touch is but but even so music pins are are harder cells for people

[19:12] they just are Willy Wonka you get more universal appeal toy story more universal

[19:18] appeal so Jersey Jack is in a good position to be number two now I think the two

[19:24] companies that are going to battle it out for number two position are Jersey Jack

[19:30] pinball and Chicago gaming company now Chicago gaming company really really

[19:36] interesting company now they've had delays and the delays definitely definitely

[19:41] I've hurt them but who hasn't had delays right but they're about to drop

[19:47] cactus Canyon and I'm hearing the treatment on it is amazing but they're also

[19:52] going to release another pin next year which I think could bump them up and

[19:58] maybe take that number two spot so they're going to make a licensed licensed

[20:03] game that's an original C.G.C. game so that is really interesting that they are

[20:09] going to make something that's not a remake for the first time and they know

[20:15] that there's no point in making a licensed game unless it's a license that

[20:21] people really want and I heard it is a throwback license as well maybe like a

[20:26] retro license I don't know anything else on it but they do need to not only

[20:32] do remakes I think the remake thing will work I think you'll sell one to 2,000

[20:37] easily there's not a lot of R&D and remakes but them introducing an

[20:43] original license game is huge news and we all know this we all know this C.G.C.

[20:49] quality is great and we all know that I think out of all the companies they're the

[20:54] ones that give you the most I think in terms of you know the powder coated

[20:59] armor the mirror blades the toppers they really dress up these machines

[21:03] beautifully and so we will see I think it's Jersey Jack and Chicago gaming

[21:09] company battling it out for number two now if I were to say is there a dark

[21:13] horse in this race and I'm you know like and I don't spooky is gonna be spooky I

[21:19] just don't think spooky wants to be at the volume and can reach the volume of

[21:22] a number two and that's fine I do see them as a smaller you know boutique

[21:27] company and I think they would agree I think number two the potential to be

[21:32] number two could also be American pinballs and they have the manufacturing

[21:38] capability they've learned enough by now to make their third game a hit

[21:43] Davos email to me saying that I would be very surprised by the third title and

[21:49] I think on joy it leads me to get excited about it but I think for these guys

[21:55] it's like they they're gonna hit it out of the park or I think it's it's

[21:59] the beginning of the end because you can't have three strikes I mean three

[22:03] strikes and you're out I mean the metaphor kind of fits especially in pinball

[22:07] after two attempts your third attempt needs to be a home run especially for

[22:11] these guys who know enough by now they they've done nothing but get great

[22:17] feedback from the community on what people want to see in their games and how

[22:21] they could improve their games and it's not a lot it's not a lot of changes

[22:25] they need to make so we will see what is the next game from American pinball so

[22:30] I think those three companies right American pinball

[22:33] sputia sorry Chicago gaming company and Jersey Jack pinball which is funny that

[22:37] we have three big companies vying for the second spot and then where does

[22:42] deep route fall into the mix in 2020 right if they're gonna ship more titles

[22:47] than anyone ever how's that gonna work out all right so here's the thing here's

[22:53] the thing I've been thinking about the most because we talk so much about

[22:56] pricing we talk about mechanisms and we talk about signature plates and we

[23:01] talk about you know code integration the biggest challenge I think to

[23:07] Stern pinball if I'm Stern pinball and I'm in the marketing department or I'm

[23:11] doing market researcher I'm trying to understand you know what's working for

[23:15] us what's working against us what is the biggest challenge at the gate of

[23:20] Stern pinballs you know what what what what would keep me up at night if I was

[23:25] Gary Stern well probably not a lot because he's probably laughing his ass all

[23:28] the way to the bank that he got 50 suckers to buy a virus for 15,000 dollars but

[23:35] here's the biggest challenge the Stern and I think it's not that young kids

[23:39] don't care about pinball it's not that you know internet connectivity has

[23:45] taken so long and people love internet playing in game in the gaming world the

[23:49] biggest challenge is Stern pinball it's not the cost of manufacturing because

[23:55] they have that down it's not you know the prices of pinball machines because we

[24:00] proven to them that were a bunch of suckers that will throw money at them

[24:04] no matter what they make and it happens every time the biggest challenge I

[24:10] I foresee happening in this hobby is one thing and it's one word and that word is

[24:16] space I think we are getting to a point where the biggest challenge for all of

[24:23] us for Stern for consumers for distributors is space people are going to get to

[24:30] a point if they're not there already where they are just out of space to put

[24:36] these games because I I still think most of the pinball buying community is

[24:41] somewhat in a in a place of financial means if you're not you know and I'm

[24:49] talking new in box okay because Gary Stern does not care about second hand

[24:53] sales like new in box modern day pinball manufacturing my biggest

[24:58] concern is that I don't know if my customer base has enough room to absorb all

[25:06] of the games that we have coming out and so then the solution to that problem

[25:12] becomes well we need to find new customers which is going to get harder and harder

[25:17] as much as I know we think pinball is growing it's not growing at that level to

[25:22] absorb the amount of games that even just one manufacturer is making a year

[25:27] let alone five six or seven and you could see it in the community now people are

[25:33] really excited about what's coming out but the biggest dilemma facing most of

[25:38] us isn't can I find the money to buy these games it's where do I put it and so

[25:44] then it creates a scenario in which people need to move a game out of their house

[25:50] to move a game in it's like I got my great friend Adam with this amazing pinball

[25:55] loft in Tribeca and that's his problem it's not like it's not about the money

[26:00] it's the room and then you also want to make sure that you don't overcrowd your

[26:06] space because I do think aesthetically a a game room is is something that when you

[26:11] get it right it's amazing to have but when you over clutter it's terrible and

[26:15] I'm looking at all of you people out there if you have a pinball machine in

[26:20] front of windows that is the worst way to have a machine in a room you should

[26:27] never block windows with a piece of furniture let alone a piece of furniture

[26:31] that is like six feet tall like six and a half feet tall it looks horrible Derek

[26:36] I'm looking at you man I know there's nothing even if there's nothing on the

[26:40] other side of those windows it doesn't matter it looks bad okay but back to my

[26:45] point about space we are seeing more and more people need to sell a game to get a

[26:51] new game in now the problem is is if you have space limitations happening all

[26:58] across the hobby and not just right not just in people's homes in barcades you

[27:03] know they have enough pins and so then you need you need like you need you need

[27:08] you need somewhere for a pin to go for a new one to come in and so then what

[27:13] people list the games for sale right but games are not selling nearly as quickly

[27:18] as they used to they're not because there's just so much and people are waiting to

[27:23] see what's next that they're not rushing to buy what's old so if you ask me

[27:28] to I think what is going to happen in pinball and I think this is gonna happen

[27:33] with a lot of distributors and if I was a distributor like if I was Zach

[27:37] many or Chris at coin taker and I think Nick Parks has this down if I was a

[27:42] distributor I think what's going to happen is more and more distributors are

[27:47] going to help to alleviate the space issues with customers and we're gonna see

[27:52] a lot more used pin sales happening through distributors because if you're

[27:58] distributor and you want to sell you know one of your customers a brand new game

[28:02] well maybe the only way to get it in there is I'll take that old one off your

[28:08] hands like I'll buy back that what let's just say I'll buy back that monsters

[28:12] pro from you but but it's like trading your car in at a dealership you're never

[28:17] gonna get as much money as you would at a private sale but are you willing to

[28:23] wait the amount of time it would take to find that private sale where the

[28:28] distributor will take it off your hands immediately but he's gonna obviously

[28:32] give you a lower amount because he has to resell it to make money so I think

[28:36] we're gonna see a lot of that happening over the next year in pinball because I

[28:41] don't know about you I mean I know about me I'm already like I can fit two

[28:45] machines and I'm out of space and I know look I know a lot of you have a lot of

[28:49] room but even my most wealthy friends in this hobby I know that space is an

[28:54] issue and so then it leads to like a different way we approach and behave in

[29:00] this hobby you start to look at games like well for a game to make its way into

[29:05] my house it has to be a keeper or dream theme something I really want I can't

[29:10] I can't behave the way I could three or four years ago in which I could just buy

[29:15] a game play it sell it you know maybe a couple months later or six months later

[29:21] and only lose 500 bucks no now you're gonna lose two thousand dollars and it

[29:26] might sit and you might not even be able to sell it until you actually you know

[29:31] take a huge hit on it so I think that as we talk about the oversaturation of

[29:37] the market space is a big deal I think it's the biggest challenge for a lot of

[29:43] us I think it's a challenge for manufacturers I think it's a challenge for

[29:46] distributors I think it's a challenge for operators so space and how we manage

[29:51] space will become very interesting now the other part of it is this in life

[29:56] you know sometimes you see this all the time I don't know about you but as I get

[30:01] older having less stuff actually makes me happier more and and and and

[30:09] crowding and creating clutter in your home especially if that clutter is a

[30:14] pinball machine I don't know like it starts to erode away at your peace of mind

[30:19] and your enjoyment and I would always err on the side of less is more like I

[30:26] don't sometimes I'm like well isn't five pinball machines like plenty some

[30:30] people have ten some people have a hundred and fifty some people have one some

[30:33] people have two you know but I would just say you know get as many machines as

[30:38] you can afford and as as the space allows without it looking overly cluttered

[30:44] so you know I'm curious I'm curious because I do we always try to predict right

[30:52] when is there going to be like a market collapse in pinball and I don't think

[30:55] it's ever going to collapse I just think you're gonna have so many titles and I

[31:00] think across the board they're not gonna collapse but you're gonna see a big

[31:05] decrease in in like resale value of games I also think you're gonna see longer

[31:13] wait times to move a game and it's just it's just the the new marketplace and I

[31:19] think that's also gonna create an environment in which people you know just

[31:23] wait to make sure you get something that you really really want because what

[31:28] is the point you know you don't want to lose a lot of money in flipping these

[31:33] games and you don't need to if you can go play them on location or at a

[31:37] friend's house all right so space I think that's the biggest challenge in 2020

[31:40] all right anything else going on in the pinball world that I've missed I didn't

[31:45] talk about Jersey Jack's response to someone's question at at Expo when they

[31:52] asked about the play field issues and I don't know if you saw this but Jack

[31:56] was really like just sort of like very short and kind of annoyed by the question

[32:01] and you know I didn't really want to like pull up the clip and I again I'm not

[32:06] beating a dead horse with the play field issues I'll just say this people have

[32:12] a right to just ask questions about the quality of the games you're making and

[32:18] the products that you're asking money for and I was disappointed to see him answer

[32:24] the question in such a way and in such a manner look I've what I've done on

[32:30] this podcast in terms of bringing the play field issues to light it was never

[32:36] meant to be egregious or can't tankerous it was never meant as a vendetta against

[32:43] anyone I mean I basically said this problem was impacting all of these

[32:48] companies and they all were ignoring us the customer for I thought too long and

[32:54] they were shipping products that were known to be defective and and I know it's

[33:00] not nice for them to have to wake up and fix the problem and spend money

[33:05] fixing it but I just I just think that there was a lack of respect to the

[33:10] customer to answer it like that and I know Jack is a good guy no Jack is a

[33:14] passionate guy but you know sometimes I think he fails to realize that every

[33:20] customer and every customer's like questions about quality you know she'd

[33:25] just be I think approached with a little bit more respect for the question right

[33:30] don't don't it's not it's not personal we just want to make sure that what we're

[33:35] buying is of quality and and and that's that that's that I'll leave it at that

[33:40] I I don't know I still don't know if the problem is fully solved I'm not sure

[33:46] what we can do as customers other than look at the games when we get them and

[33:52] see if there's you know any issues and I haven't really seen the issue pop up

[33:58] as much I know the community would share the issues if if it was happening on

[34:03] Elvira we'd hear about it I haven't seen anybody complain about it on Elvira

[34:07] I haven't seen any new complaints from new Willy Wonka builds so apparently

[34:13] maybe the problem has gone away and that's all we ever wanted on this podcast

[34:18] this negative podcast do you see I love that thread on Pins I wear some guys

[34:22] like ever since he went away it's been great I love that the people who complain

[34:26] about my podcast clearly listen to every show I mean I'm not making anyone

[34:34] listen it's a free pinball podcast we're we're already we're at 35 minutes and

[34:40] we're pretty much done with the show and we've covered off on a lot of stuff

[34:44] that I think is fun to talk about I mean this is what we do I don't understand

[34:48] why people are so upset I think what rubs people the wrong way is we don't

[34:53] universally cheerlead everything going on in the hobby I mean I've been looking

[34:59] or sorry I've been listening to other podcasts and it's like people are like so

[35:03] hesitant to just say the Willy Wonka topper looks like crap compared to the

[35:09] other toppers out there I do I think that is a subpar topper and then you listen

[35:14] to people try to articulate that and it's like they don't want to say anything

[35:17] negative about it and it's that's fine everyone is free to say how they feel

[35:24] about these games and this hobby and look no one is forced to listen to this

[35:29] show or any show but I think that we're not that negative and this show is

[35:34] entertaining and we can cover a lot without meandering around a lot of other

[35:40] stuff okay so everyone thank you for tuning in to the world's most negative
