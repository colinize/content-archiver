[00:00] Don't ever try to tell me how much you care for me.

[00:07] Don't ever try to tell me how you are there for me.

[00:21] Ah, that was some more that unreleased guns and roses remix, Shackler's Revenge.

[00:27] Happy Friday, everybody. Welcome to episode 267 of Canatus Pimball Podcast.

[00:34] It's a Friday and we're almost at PimballExpo 2018.

[00:39] I'm going to give my thoughts about PimballExpo in a little bit on this show.

[00:44] But we have to talk about the tour, the behind the scenes journey of deep root Pimball,

[00:51] that Jeff over at this weekend Pimball encountered a couple weeks ago or a week ago.

[00:57] And he's got his exclusive deep root tour on his website.

[01:01] And so it's interesting to read about it because you're kind of reading the tour of deep root facility.

[01:07] And it seems like it's under construction.

[01:09] But to nobody's surprise, what is happening inside the walls of deep root is that Pimball designing

[01:18] and Pimball creation is occurring.

[01:22] And it's, is anyone surprised?

[01:24] Now here's the thing, I'm really curious.

[01:27] As I've said on my last podcast, I think that deep root has done the right thing

[01:32] by keeping their mouth shut and not showing their cards before they have some cards to show.

[01:40] I will even go on the record to say to Robert Mueller, if you are not ready to show what you've been working on.

[01:47] And if you're not close to production on those said machines, I would not go to TPS.

[01:55] I really felt like it was a strange decision to put TPS on the map as the moment you would reveal your company's work.

[02:07] Because as we see in Pimball, and we're going to talk about this a little bit again in the show, what is the point of revealing stuff

[02:15] if you're not going to ship those games for months?

[02:19] The sweet spot of reveal to ship to hype.

[02:23] It literally is, I would say within two months, you need to ship your Pimball game within two months of revealing it to the world.

[02:32] If you wait longer than that, I think you create fatigue.

[02:37] I think you lose excitement. I think you lose hype.

[02:40] And I think the games start to feel old, and I've seen it, and there's nothing new.

[02:47] Because here's the part that we all will agree on.

[02:50] You will want to buy something that is an impulse buy during a short window of hype, of enthusiasm.

[02:59] I need to have it. I need to have it now.

[03:02] Take Deadpool Ellie, for example.

[03:04] Why are people buying Deadpool Ellie?

[03:07] Is it because they have to have it now?

[03:10] Yes, the only reason people are buying Deadpool Ellie right now is because they will ship it to you right now.

[03:18] When it distributes you calls you up and says, hey, frolic, you want a Deadpool Ellie?

[03:23] I got one, you can have it in three days.

[03:25] Sure, why not? Like, I'll take it.

[03:28] It'll be really, really, really clamoring to get a $9,000.

[03:34] Stern Deadpool, which is pretty much the same game as the pro for almost half the price.

[03:40] But the reason why Stern is so successful in selling their Ellie's is because they make them available.

[03:48] Why do you think Stern makes the Ellie's available right away?

[03:53] Because they know that the hype window is in that short period of time after they reveal and start manufacturing games.

[04:03] They don't want to give you too much time to think about your purchase.

[04:10] Come on, everyone who listens to this podcast, I know you're getting smart enough to realize that this is how marketing works.

[04:19] Grab the money early, lock them in to the thing before they have too much time to think about it.

[04:28] It's also why Jersey Jack completely fumbles this on every marketing level.

[04:36] You know who should get the first 250 pirates of the Caribbean games?

[04:44] The collector edition buyers. Those games should be made first.

[04:50] Jack is so silly.

[04:53] What he's doing now by making the people who spend the most money weight the longest, they bail out.

[05:03] Why do you think?

[05:05] Why do you think there are still collector edition dialed in available?

[05:11] Why do you think?

[05:13] Well, because he made all the Ellie's first and if you really want it one and you had to have one, you go get one.

[05:21] But you know, Stern continues to show us that reveal, release, and get the money early.

[05:28] So back to Deeproot. Let's talk about the Tours.

[05:31] So I mean it was exciting that someone went on the tour.

[05:35] I've been talking to Robert. If I'm down in Texas, I hope to go into Deeproot and see what they're working on.

[05:42] The big news is this.

[05:45] There is like a rumor going around that they're going to make back to the future pinball because of some strange wording that Jeff used to describe it.

[05:57] I want to like, I want to read on, on Pinside, there's this thread about it.

[06:03] Hold on a second because it's like everybody wants back to the future.

[06:07] It is like a theme that we weren't happy with the original back to the future pinball machine from back in the day.

[06:14] And if someone makes a back to the future pinball machine, I think we all can agree it is a take my money now moment.

[06:21] Now here's what Jeff wrote. He said teaser.

[06:26] The license is an 80s movie. People have been craving.

[06:32] All right, so I'm not, you know, that's, that's a big teaser.

[06:37] And he says, look like a throwback to the Bally Williams error.

[06:41] Some looked futuristic. Throwback is one word.

[06:45] Was it deliberately written as back to the maybe not who knows?

[06:50] They were trying to figure out a safe way to add sparks or smoke as a feature to one of the license themes.

[06:56] Sparks or smoke. Wow, that sounds like a spark at the top of the clock tower.

[07:04] It sounds like smoke trail where the DeLorean goes back to the future, doesn't it?

[07:11] Now look, if they figure that out and they figure out how to make a back to the future pinball machine with stuff like that.

[07:19] They will sell 18 million back to the future pinball machines.

[07:25] I mean, let's be honest, we are so used to the world of Stern and the majority of you out there are so used to Stern pinball being the only option in town.

[07:35] What excites me about deep root and look, I hope they make it and I've been saying it on this podcast.

[07:41] I made a decision months ago to not just blame these guys for hiring J-pop.

[07:46] You see it now, the tide has turned on deep root.

[07:50] People have gone from casting them aside, calling them a joke, saying that they are going to fail because of J-pop.

[07:58] Someone put in there like, I'm not going to follow this company because of J-pop and J-pop lost millions.

[08:04] That stuff is getting downvoted now.

[08:07] And it shows that Robert Mueller didn't create Zidware.

[08:12] Robert Mueller didn't steal people's money.

[08:15] Robert Mueller didn't do anything.

[08:17] John Papaduke went off on his own and bid off more than he could chew.

[08:21] But if you think that John's failed business ventures mean that John is not capable of incredible pinball design, I think you're crazy.

[08:32] He is. He's a lunatic, John Papaduke. He's a mad scientist.

[08:36] But let me tell you, who would you rather have designing pinball machines?

[08:41] Mad scientists who are trying to push the boundaries of what's feasible or playing it safe, getting the same damn rinsen repeat formula that we are getting from the number one pinball manufacturer out there.

[08:56] And it's like, show me a Stern mech. Show me a recent Stern mech that really feels like they push the envelope.

[09:05] And look, Stern understands that there is nobody competing with them on manufacturing.

[09:10] But I think the reason why when we hear Jeff's comments about how deep root is really working on all these mechanisms and creativity and world under glass,

[09:24] 80s themes and non 80s themes and there's like an oval room with all this stuff going on.

[09:29] It can't help but make you feel excited that someone is finally creating a little bit of like a willy-wanker workshop for pinball.

[09:41] We're hopefully, hopefully magic pinball is the result. And this, you know, I really feel like I'm excited.

[09:51] I'm also a little nervous and here's why when I hear about like all this stuff going on and all these games being made at deep root, part of me is like just make one good game to start.

[10:03] You don't need to make four or five. You don't need overnight to compete with Stern in terms of volume and cadence.

[10:12] All you need to do, Robert, is show one good game at TPS. You need to just make one good game available for people to buy and you need to be able to ship that game to people in a close time period to when you reveal it.

[10:30] And TPS is going to come up on these guys way faster than they can imagine in terms of like reveal to ship.

[10:37] I know they're also going to expo and I hope they don't show too much at expo. I'm going to talk a little bit about expo in a second.

[10:44] But I think deep root existing in the world has people curious and it has people excited.

[10:54] And look, it has... This is what it's doing to me and you guys can agree or disagree.

[11:03] I think, again, more than ever. Why would I just wait? Why would anyone run and buy any of these games right now?

[11:12] If you just waited six months to see what the Pimball landscape would be, you would have your option of everything.

[11:20] In six months, you would be able to get... If you want it, a pristine version of any Deadpool of any Batman 66, you'll be able to get any Alice Cooper nightmare castle you want.

[11:32] You'll be able to get monsters, you'll be able to get beetles, you'll be able to get... You hopefully you'll know what deep root has in store.

[11:39] You'll be able to get a monster bash remake and for these new games coming out, as we know, what is the point in buying any of them when they all come out with incomplete code?

[11:49] You'll be able to get a pirate to the Caribbean. So if you wait six months and say, I'm just going to wait and see what is available.

[11:57] I think that is a smart thing to do. You're going to be able to get an October fest. You know, the list keeps going on and on and on.

[12:03] So I think when I see these guys rushing to buy like Deadpool LE, really? They follow the hobby.

[12:11] And if it's like if I was going to go into a car and I was going to go get a muscle car and I knew that like five other muscle cars were going to be revealed in a four month period of time, why would I rush and go buy something immediately?

[12:25] So look, the deep root of Tor didn't give us a lot, but it gave us enough to be excited. And I think that's a smart thing for Robert to do is to get a little bit of that buzz going.

[12:38] But again, my final point is Robert and company. You guys don't reveal a game until you are ready or near ready to ship it.

[12:48] I think history has shown us that if you do that, you are going to make it harder on yourselves. There's one caveat to that.

[13:00] If they show it back to the future pinball machine with sparks and smoke in a crazy world under glass, they could make people wait years for it.

[13:09] And they probably would and they would take as much money as planet earth has because people would gobble that up.

[13:17] And I think what excites me about deep root is Stern needs competition. Stern needs competition that's not building wide body games.

[13:26] Nobody really wants wide bodies. Let's be honest. I'm so tired of Jersey Jax wide bodies with screens that are too big. Nobody wants it.

[13:33] You know, Jack refuses to alter his approach. Okay, fine. Keep doing it. Keep making trucks when everybody wants sports cars.

[13:40] I think a standard body game that has a balli Williams like cabinet, which we know deep root has. I think there's going to be a screen with a deep root game.

[13:49] We know that whether it's the whole back box or not, we're not sure. But someone needs to make a game and someone needs to make pins that can actually compete with Stern.

[14:00] Jersey Jax is not doing it. And I think we all know why we say it all the time. They just can't get their act together.

[14:06] Spooky pinball is not even close. They're not competitors for Stern. The games are not there. They're not good enough. They're not quite as good as a Stern pro.

[14:14] But they're an alternative, right? And you'll get your game. But still, Spooky makes you wait 18 months to make 500 games. Stern makes 500 games in what? Like a month? Probably, you know.

[14:25] So it's like apples to oranges. And look, Spooky's not trying to make that many games a month. But it's also just a quality of the game.

[14:31] So nobody. It's like nobody else is giving you any options or alternatives. Montsobash remake sure you could buy it. But it's been out for 20 years.

[14:39] Like what's new about it? Not much. Just a screen. So can deep root do it? Can they do it? What I like about Robert and company is they're fueled by people skepticism.

[14:49] And I think they're angry. I think they want to I want to I think they want to show the world what they can do. And I like companies that have that kind of emotional drive to prove a point.

[15:02] I think that is where magic happens. And because like let's be honest. Do you think Stern when they make these new games is trying to prove how good they can make a pinball machine?

[15:15] I mean, do you and this is nothing. I don't I think I think Stern's focus is on money money money. They know they can make money without having to do too much without having to engineer too much.

[15:30] Stern has learned over the last few years that if they just get the art and the code where it needs to be at launch with the right theme, you'll buy it.

[15:42] I feel like they have a measurement of did we succeed in giving just enough to sell this pen at nine thousand dollars. You know what they're measurement is?

[15:53] It's is did we get frolic to give two thumbs up standing next to an LED. And that is like I feel like Stern's on a mission to see how much they can take out of pinball machines to still get frolic to spend nine thousand dollars and put his damn thumbs up.

[16:09] And I want you know I as I said like Stern and Jersey Jack if they could unite they would make the best pinball machines ever and maybe deep route is going to is going to fill that void.

[16:22] Alright, let's go on. Let's go on from from deep route. What's happening at Stern. So finally somebody has finally revealed in pinside the truth about the Beatles and I haven't said anything.

[16:38] I know Jeff on this week in pinball hasn't said anything Ryan and Marty haven't said anything but someone just wrote it in the thread that the Beatles pinball is going to be a re-theme of sea witch.

[16:54] Alright, you that that is what the Beatles will be. Alright, I've heard this from multiple people at Stern who never want to reveal who they are. They work there but they talk to me. They can go in a wild goose chase trying to find out who it is.

[17:10] They never will. Canators got moles in every organization. It's a little army of mine. My little tattooos out there. But anyway, that is going to be what the Beatles is. You are going to get three versions of the Beatles.

[17:25] They are all going to be the same game. They will have different art packages on them. There will be I don't know if it's going to be premium limited edition super limited edition. I would probably guess that will be the case.

[17:40] I don't think the super limited edition will go as high as 15,000 dollars because is a re-theme of sea witch. If I were to guess.

[17:51] Because remember Batman super Ellie was originally supposed to be 12,000 dollars. They just update to 15 arbitrarily to see people would bite and they did.

[18:01] But here is my guess. Canada predicts the Beatles. See which re-theme will be three editions. Okay. And the game is based on like a hard days night Beatles. It's not yellow submarine. It's like hard days night like that error of Beatles.

[18:19] I don't really know the Beatles, but that's what I'm hearing. There will be three editions. I would guess that you will get a premium at let's say nine that I started. No, the premium will be I would say 7500.

[18:34] You will get an Ellie at nine to 10,000 dollars. And I think you'll get a super early for 12,000 dollars or 12,500. That is what I think will happen.

[18:46] What else do I know about the game? I don't know if they've taken sea witch and like added ramps or like built on top of it. They might possibly have done that.

[18:56] Like for example Batman 66 is a re-theme of Batman the Dark Knight, but they added another ramp. They added the turntable. They changed elements of the game.

[19:08] So if you know re-theme is just starting with the original game what they've done to that original game. I have no clue. I have no clue.

[19:18] But that will be coming. And if we're looking at a timeframe for Beatles, you're looking at a probably February, I would say.

[19:26] All right. I don't really care about Beatles. I don't really care. Some people do. All right. So let's talk about the monsters.

[19:34] Once again on Pinside, I'm seeing like the monsters, cabinet artwork, pops up every now and then they yank it down.

[19:41] I got to give you know Pinside finally yanked down the photos of Monster Bash remake. We'll talk a little bit about that. But the monsters, here's the thing. The monsters will probably most likely not be shown at Expo.

[19:57] And so that leads me to my discussion about Pimbal Expo and why I think going there for most of these manufacturers is stupid.

[20:08] And it's about time that we start calling out some of these unnecessary shows for what they are. And Pimbal Expo used to be the show where these manufacturers would go and show the distributors and the buyers and the arcade host sailors.

[20:26] All the people that needed to know what they were going to buy for that year or the year coming, they would show them the inventory.

[20:34] And this is this was in an error when you know games were like would be put out in public and whitewoods would be tested and games would be in route for a few months to troubleshoot.

[20:45] Like this was back in like the error when it wasn't about home collectors. It wasn't about secrecy. It wasn't about all that shit. And so what is the point of Pimbal Expo in 2018?

[20:58] What is the point really like I don't get why manufacturers continue to go to some of these like yesterday years shows that have no prominence anymore.

[21:11] Waste time money and resources going to Pimbal Expo why I'll give you a good example of that why would spooky why would Charlie Emory waste money and go to Pimbal Expo.

[21:24] I'm not sure if he's going or not but he shouldn't why he's already sold all of his Alice Cooper nightmare castles. So why are you going like you're going to spend money spend resources to take what orders you have no more orders to take on.

[21:40] To take on Alice Cooper's nightmare castle so what is the point of going there you literally have no reason to be spending money or wasting money when you could just stay home and build the games and every day you don't waste resources going to shows is a day those resources are going to building machines like we used to see Dutch Pimbal fly around to every show Andrew highway same thing these guys would go to every show burn money.

[22:09] And then they collapsed and the shows were pointless because people will buy your game you know without needing to go to a show you know like expo do you think people wouldn't have bought big Lebowski once they showed it once and the reviews were incredible like word of mouth is incredible they could have just like said okay now we're just going to like build them all right and we're going to make this many and they would have sold every one so okay so Charlie no point in going.

[22:38] Jersey Jack Pimbal you know I understand why Jack needs to be there is to let people play pirates because he's got a game that is finally shipping you know it was a year ago that he revealed pirates of the Caribbean at expo it is kind of crazy that's that nobody is even unboxing their pirates the Caribbean Pimbal machines in the States a year later I mean it's kind of sad it really is they they totally botched this launch but Jack is a really good player.

[23:08] Being there makes sense sort of kind of and here's the other thing there are other gaming shows going on around the country and some of their names.

[23:18] I'm a little bit right now but there are other shows going on in the country gaming shows that have a far greater attendance than Pimbal expo which again if you're jack and you want to sell pirate the Caribbean what is the point of going to Pimbal expo

[23:36] when you should go to places that have a bigger audience because there's more potential sales there okay so then you got we've got October fest American Pimbal they're going to go and we've we've heard from their marketing and sales guy that they're going to reveal October fest at Pimbal expo and so then the question becomes why are they doing that.

[24:01] Why is the game ready to ship is it going to ship soon I've been hearing that October fest is going to ship sometime in January February but again I just think it's pointless I think these companies are wasting their time literally wasting their time so I actually hit up.

[24:21] The sales and marketing guy at American Pimbal his name I don't want to say wrong Nirmal Vassani and I said to him hey my name is Chris I do a podcast you probably know it I've been talking a lot about October fest American Pimbal I would love for you to come on and talk about your sales and marketing approach for the company and I think it'd be great for people to hear from you you know because they've been hearing from me and I've been skeptical about their sales and marketing decisions and my interviews are always fair and nice.

[24:50] fair and nice so I extended the invite to him and he has not responded so if you know

[24:56] near mall and you are friends with him and you talk to him you should I think you should

[25:02] encourage him to come on canators pinball podcast because I think when we hear from these

[25:07] companies about what why they're doing their things they're doing it only helps them

[25:12] it only helps them and I if I were part of a company and I heard canators pinball podcast

[25:18] saying this and that I would go on this set the record straight but I but all I can do

[25:23] is ask them to come on and you've listened to this show I don't I don't hold back I don't

[25:28] retreat but I also treat every guest with respect and I let them have the stage to tell you

[25:36] the listener why they're doing what they're doing and why you should buy their game and

[25:41] that's the that's the fair way to do it and so if you know him and he wants to come on

[25:45] he can come on at any time but my point is so they're going to show it in October and

[25:50] then when are they going to ship the game and then once they do that forget it all who

[25:53] Dini sales are dead I even saw on Pinside now people are trying to sell who Dini for

[25:59] 6300 bucks and who Dini that's modded for 6300 and still nobody wants it this is a big

[26:07] moment for American pinball this game needs to be a hit there when you're first game

[26:12] which you didn't even make a lot of is is selling for you know won't even sell for 6300

[26:18] it's showing everybody that the market is is is really tough like you need to make a

[26:24] hit or your games a flop like that's just the way it is these days there's no middle ground

[26:29] anymore so they're going to show it all right Stern is not going to bring the monsters

[26:35] like there's going to be Stern is just going to bring Deadpool they are just going to

[26:38] bring Deadpool Deadpool is like just shipping the premiums are just on the line you are

[26:43] not going to go to Expo and see the monsters I guarantee you the monsters will will probably

[26:50] be shown in November they will not show to you at Expo they probably will do some like

[26:55] October 31st like Halloween exclusive with like IGN even though nobody who reads IGN

[27:02] even knows who the fuck the monsters are it's just a bunch of guys that are like 50 and

[27:08] older who are really like into that title but I think that you're not going to see anything

[27:13] on the monsters until November Stern is going to keep milking the Deadpool sales as long

[27:18] as they can and it just you know who else who else is going to be at Expo is Jerry going

[27:24] to spend money and go to Expo with P3 don't do it Jerry why Jerry's been to like every

[27:31] show for like seven years with his games like spending God knows how much money Jerry I

[27:37] just want to take a time machine I want to get in a little miniature version of a Delorean

[27:43] that's inside a deep root game I want someone to spark the little clock tower I want to flames

[27:49] to come from the tires I want to go back in time and tell Jerry seven years ago Jerry you've

[27:56] got a few hundred thousand dollars you're thinking of like disrupting the pinball market Jerry

[28:02] don't do it by Amazon stock today in seven years you're going to turn that two hundred

[28:11] thousand dollars into like millions of dollars your family won't be yelling at you over

[28:17] Thanksgiving that you know you burn through their money you'll be a multi-millionaire because

[28:21] of your investment and then you can go make a pinball machine and still have millions in

[28:27] the bank that's what you should do Jerry it didn't happen we've got P3 if you know so sorry

[28:34] can't can't go back and change time all right so look anyone else going to be at Expo who's

[28:40] going to be at Expo is I think is there like let me let me hit pause right now go to like

[28:43] pinball Expo website and see what the seminars are all right I got it up what we're going

[28:48] to do is I'm going to go through pinball Expo's schedule of events and I'm going to tell

[28:52] you if I give a shit or don't give a shit about what is going on all right Thursday October

[28:59] 18 let's see what we've got no photos or video taping will be allowed no employee okay this

[29:07] is like set up let's see me okay at one thirty p.m. on Thursday you know the hot time slot

[29:15] to get meet team pinball designers of the mafia I mean okay so that's like a third calm there's

[29:23] like I give a shit I don't give a shit like below my fucking head off kind like like okay really

[29:32] really meet the designers of the mafia look at I look I think all of us could agree that we

[29:39] could care less about a game that caused seventy five hundred bucks and looks like a three thousand

[29:46] dollar machine at most I saw that Joe new heart from pinball star is like I've got the founder

[29:53] is addition Joe I love you brother let me break it to you real simple when you say they're only

[30:00] going to make a hundred of these no Joe they're only making ten there there there will never be

[30:05] an in order place for number eleven of pinball mafia okay I'm just I'm just let's just call it

[30:12] like it is only a hundred there there aren't ninety other people out there unless health and

[30:21] mcdingo like clones himself and there's like a hundred health and mcdingo is running around to

[30:25] order these games then there's I don't even think they're going to sell all ten of those founders

[30:30] additions and you I don't even want I literally there there has not been less excitement for a pinball

[30:37] machine in years than the mafia I mean I haven't even like really talks Mac about this game but

[30:44] like I will for just a little bit have these guys ever seen a mafia movie I mean what is with the

[30:50] art on the game it looks like the mafia dude is wearing like a ten gallon cowboy hat I mean I

[30:57] don't get it like it's just it's so weird to me that it's like this adult theme presented in

[31:04] this like comical sort of like cactus canyon kind of art style and it's like a single level

[31:09] game I we're not okay so one thirty who's going to that and it's only a half hour I mean well that

[31:15] makes sense then all right two o'clock this is your brain on pinball and other uses for the silver

[31:21] ball what the fuck is that skip that three o'clock the untold story of the pinball company speakers

[31:42] marketing though I mean I'm not like Todd's never he he's got he's a retailer and he does a

[31:50] great job marketing TNT amusements so I would want to check that out I mean at least marketing peaks

[31:57] my interest and Todd is such a great personality and such an awesome dude I love all the content he's

[32:03] made so I would definitely start at four o'clock that day all right let's see there's just a welcome

[32:08] party do do do do do six o'clock from computers to space invaders speaker Ed Fry's okay I mean maybe

[32:15] I don't know I don't why would people at a pinball show want to see that I don't know number seven the

[32:21] team behind the qubert video game machine well again why why why are like arcade games stuff

[32:29] happening at pinball expel I would skip that 8 30 this is really the first one you're really going

[32:34] to want to see which is what's new at American pinball Joe ball sir and staff so that is where we

[32:40] will get to see October fest again but I could just at 8 30 at night on Thursday I will simply go

[32:49] on the internet and it will be streamed and I'll be able to see everything without having to be

[32:54] there okay then Friday let's see just another pinball troubleshooting lecture Ron Kuhn all right cool

[33:04] wouldn't go to that video game repair tips Jason cop okay again we're a lot of video game repair tips

[33:11] like I thought this is pinball expo number nine nine o'clock again solid state 101 beginners guide

[33:19] to schematics and pinball electronics with Rob Craig all right let's see okay so that's stuff like

[33:26] look it's not of interest to me because I'm never gonna like be a pinball maintenance guy but I

[33:30] understand why at least it's pinball so 9 30 a.m. this is early right the making of spinal tap pinball

[33:38] machine all right so it's home brew machine 11 15 the pinball hall of fame is moving uptown

[33:45] Tim Arnold I know they're moving locations in Vegas I okay cool like I don't do I need a I don't

[33:53] know do I need a 45 minute speech about how you're moving locations one o'clock this week in pinball

[33:59] and straight down the middle a pinball show speakers Jeff Patterson Zach Manion Greg Boone okay so I

[34:08] think they're gonna do like a one o'clock show from the floor nothing like guys nothing is more

[34:14] exciting than watching a pinball podcast live now you can't you like literally there is no

[34:22] better live entertainment than watching three dudes in front of a mic record a pinball podcast I

[34:29] mean I might I might buy tickets to go to Chicago just for that one o'clock I might have to do it

[34:35] all right 145 ironically followed by straight down the middle are there good friends and heavy

[34:42] advertisers for the site pin stadiums taking collectors and operators into the future pin stadium

[34:49] lights we've seen these guys their their products are amazing I have it inside my Batman 66 I don't

[34:57] know how the Orion's belt thing is but like I think they've done something great I think they've

[35:01] lit up pinball machines which needed lights badly all right let's keep going 215 owning and operating

[35:09] the largest video arcade in the USA doc Mac that's cool I I think for a lot of people out there when

[35:16] we get bored of our jobs we have grandiose dreams about opening up an in our cater barcade and I would

[35:21] love to hear from someone who's actually done it the hurdles and challenges that he faced

[35:26] the rise in fall of Illinois pinball I'm not even sure what that means was her I don't I okay all right

[35:34] whatever are you dialed in pat lawler pat I'm not I'm not dialed in I I wake I don't get

[35:45] why he's talking now the game's been out for two years Jersey Jack wants to get people to buy

[35:51] pirates of the Caribbean so I love pat lawler but I don't want to hear from pat lawler again

[35:57] until his next game is out and I and the only question I have for pat lawler is why did you think

[36:02] dialed in would be a theme that would sell pinball machines but look I'd love to have them on the

[36:09] show but you know I don't want to go hear him talk and also like Jack is the most charismatic speaker

[36:14] at J.J.P. when other people talk I'm always like it's like nails on a chalkboard all right 515

[36:20] future worlds with deep root pinball barrio Dennis Norman J.Pop John Norris Robert Mueller is

[36:28] moderating and Quinn Johnson so 515 on Friday is another one I'd want to be at and that so that's

[36:37] like you know again like the the manufacturers who are talking about new stuff it is going to be

[36:43] incredible that when J.Pop takes a stage to see what happens I think people will be respectful I

[36:50] don't think people are going to do but I'd want to I just want to see what J.Pop looks like you know

[36:54] it's like how is he doing you know so it's interesting that's being moderated by Robert though

[37:02] because what's strange about that to me is I should moderate that panel because if you're the guy

[37:10] who runs the company's moderating his own people you know they're going to have to prep for the

[37:16] hard questions and so I hope they're ready for that but I think they will be they they've answered

[37:21] them well I'm seven o'clock pinball expo Hall of Fame inductee ceremony speaker Rob Burke all right

[37:29] all right okay I mean I don't I didn't realize there's like a pinball Hall of Fame where like you

[37:33] can get inducted into it do you think years from now canada will actually make it into the pinball

[37:39] Hall of Fame maybe right the pioneer of pinball podcasting who brought us multiple shows a week

[37:46] he's the only one the only one who is able to get us the stern coffee table book after years of

[37:53] waiting all right let's see um all right then we have 8 30 at night and evening with jersey jack

[38:00] pinball speakers jack and staff let me guess it's gonna be jack it's gonna be Eric it's gonna be

[38:06] Keith it's gonna be a shitty PowerPoint presentation where they tell stories and they show us pictures

[38:12] from the factory same shit different year all right Lloyd Olsen love them fixes everybody's problems

[38:23] can't fix my problems with the booze all right Saturday let's see this is where source to like

[38:30] thin out you got robots making playfields micro Stefan I don't care about playfield manufacturing

[38:40] pinball Chicago and team based league play um could care less a look inside dead flip an AMA speaker

[38:48] and ask me anything with jack danger yeah man I mean jack I love you I love you 11 AM on a

[38:56] Saturday people are gonna be hung over but I'd go to that I love jack danger you know jack showed

[39:04] me his new machine and he asked me if I had any possible themes that he should make the machine

[39:10] I said I have two themes for you jack one is hilton mcdingles journey to get a smartphone so the

[39:16] game would be about you helping hilton mcdingle get a smartphone uh and the whole game would be

[39:23] about collecting uh money for him to finally purchase his smartphone um there's a there's a

[39:29] bash car that I want him to add it would be hilton Subaru where you could bash it and every time you

[39:33] bash the Subaru it gives you some more money um you know there's like there's a show loop every

[39:39] time you hit the show loop it's hilton saying how predators definitely coming out so you hit that

[39:45] and it's like predators definitely coming out predators definitely coming out um and then it's also

[39:50] him shilling highway pinball so it's like and at the end of it the final wizard mode is hilton mcdingle

[39:57] battling uh the t-mobile giant and when he's successful he's handed um a cell phone

[40:05] from the guy wearing the mom jeans and dialed in and I think this is great I think it's a great idea

[40:10] I think this would sell like hotcakes the other theme idea I had for him was just doing a theme

[40:17] based or called Andrew highways two weeks and every single switch in the game activates Andrew

[40:23] highway saying two weeks and you just play the game to see how many times you can get Andrew

[40:28] highway to say two weeks follows our ethos that we want to be able to man and manufacture as much

[40:34] as possible in a two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks

[40:57] all right I think I'm coming at the end of expo we've got thru let's see we got um

[41:03] total nuclear annihilation speakers scott denisi I don't really care I want to know about scott's

[41:10] next game we know that tna has been successful the road to game design with Keith L wind the road

[41:17] it should be called the road to making archer into iron maiden and convincing everyone that

[41:24] it's iron maiden no um you know I'm always curious to hear from game designers and then we've got

[41:29] this is where the stern has like a block then Steve richi pinball confessions with father Steve

[41:36] the making of deadpool with george go miss so stern's got this like block out on saturday of four five six

[41:44] thirty and then eight o'clock is stern arama again I think it's all going to be about deadpool that's

[41:49] why they're ending up with deadpool I like hearing from the stern guys I like it when george gets up

[41:55] there and like calls me out for being full of bullshit so just ask george when you're there guys ask

[42:00] him hey george is beetles going to be a re-theme of sea witch and see what he says

[42:05] can a to pinball podcast your trusted source for exclusive information that nobody else will tell

[42:11] you about and then it's sort of over then you got nothing really happening on sunday that's pinball

[42:17] expo and that is why I will not be there this year it is the same rodeo every year the other shows

[42:24] are better and it's going to be a skip for me I make sense that like stern and those guys are

[42:28] going to be there oh fuck because I just feel my coffee it's in their backyard guys I got to

[42:35] get to work hope you enjoyed this podcast we will talk to you real soon
