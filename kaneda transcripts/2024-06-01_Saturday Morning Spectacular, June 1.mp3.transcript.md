[00:00] What can I say except you're welcome for the tides, the sun, the sky.

[00:07] Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome.

[00:11] I'm just an ordinary, dimmy guy.

[00:13] Cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider, cider.

[00:18] All right, everybody. Welcome to the Saturday morning spectacular.

[00:21] How's everybody doing? It is Saturday morning. We're gonna go around the horn.

[00:25] We're gonna do what we do. We're gonna talk about all things pinball.

[00:28] I might even share some thoughts on all these pinball media and their response to the stern

[00:35] media tour. I don't know about you guys, but ask yourselves. Are you not sick of hearing?

[00:40] Like, people went over there and didn't really see anything new?

[00:44] I mean, I keep reading all of these stories and I'm like, all right,

[00:48] like, Stern bought you some drinks, but what else did we gain in terms of knowledge about

[00:55] this operation? Like, I just want someone to tell me why does a pinball topper cost $2,000?

[01:03] That's the only question I have for George Gomez. What's up, Chad? How's everybody doing?

[01:07] I want to give a big shout out to the 714 club members that have retained their

[01:14] Canada club memberships. It is the first of the month. We're gonna go around the horn.

[01:19] We're gonna talk about everything happening in the pinball world today. How does it sound?

[01:23] Does the mic sound good? Now, look, you guys are not getting the great audio if you're watching

[01:28] on Facebook right now, but if you're a Canadian club member, you're gonna get this show sometime

[01:33] today or tomorrow and I'm gonna upload this and you're gonna be able to hear all of my thoughts

[01:38] in podcast format and they say that $5 a month doesn't get you anything anymore. It gets you

[01:45] the world's favorite pinball podcast. Everybody, can we give a huge Canadians welcome to Kerry Hardy,

[01:54] who is the latest member of the Canada club? Can we give a huge shout out to Jason over at the

[02:02] pinball party who is another new member of the Canada club? And I want to also tell you guys

[02:08] that I threw some support their way this week. I signed up for Kerry Hardy's Patreon and I signed

[02:14] up for Jason's Patreon. So guys, thank you guys for what I believe is still, you guys got some work

[02:22] to do. There's a little bit of shilling going on. I told Kerry Hardy he needs to burn that haggis hat.

[02:28] We need to do a haggis hat burning moment. And I also, I told Jason, I love what his response

[02:34] was to the Stern Media Tour. There's still a bunch of shilling of distros and certain manufacturers

[02:41] that goes on. But for the most part, I respect the fact that when I hear from both of those gentlemen,

[02:48] I'm going to talk about this a little bit on this episode or this spectacular. I still feel like when

[02:54] I hear from them, they are honest with us, right? Like what they say to us is how they honestly feel

[03:02] about a game, about a topic, about a media tour. And that's where I'm at. I'm going to talk a little

[03:08] bit about this in a few minutes, but I want to talk about how we need to get back to

[03:14] content creation where the content creators aren't becoming fake shills. And I'll talk about what I

[03:20] mean about that. But let's go around the horn first because, you know, we don't want to just talk about

[03:24] content creators. It's always boring when we talk about ourselves. We're going to talk about what's

[03:28] going on in pinball. Let's start with American Pinball. So Naps Arcade broke the story about

[03:36] American Pinball possibly becoming a publicly traded company on the Indian Stock Exchange.

[03:44] And to file for a public offering, you have to be transparent about your revenue. What are the

[03:50] assets in your organization? And one of the Aintron public offering sort of line items is this little

[03:59] failed pinball operation run by David Fix that you know as American Pinball. And the numbers

[04:06] are atrocious. And the numbers are atrocious the moment this company launched Galactic Tank Force.

[04:14] And the numbers are even worse with a game called Barrios Barbecue Challenge. Okay, so what this data

[04:22] is showing us is what you and I already know that American Pinball is a joke. And they've been a joke

[04:31] now since this leadership team has been in place. And David Fix and Steve Bowden and Ryan McQuade

[04:41] could not steer a hungry overweight child towards a piece of cake. That is how inept and inadequate

[04:51] they are to run a pinball company. Let me say that again. Steve Bowden, Ryan McQuade and David Fix

[05:00] could not steer an overweight child towards a piece of cake. They don't know what the pinball

[05:08] buying community wants. They don't do any market research. They don't give us themes that anybody

[05:17] wants. They have made games for themselves. They bailed Dennis Nordman out on his dream

[05:25] barn-billed Galactic Tank Force game. That was the worst idea ever. I remember being a T.P.F.

[05:31] when Dennis Nordman did a panel discussion about how he's been dreaming up this tank cabinet idea

[05:38] for like a decade or two. And he showed all these pictures of like these humongous tank cabinets. I

[05:45] mean the tank treads were a good like six to eight inches wide on his initial concept. And as I was

[05:51] watching it I kept thinking to myself oh my god this guy got these suckers to build his idea and

[06:00] not only did they build it they made it much worse but it was hard to make it much worse because it

[06:06] already was one of the worst ideas in the history of pinball. It is absolute stupid to make a game

[06:14] that looks like a tank when the back box is pulled it down. That is the dumbest thing you could ever

[06:21] ideate around. And the even dumber part is that when they saw this stupid idea they went ahead

[06:28] with company resources and made it. And they made it. They actually made the damn thing. It was like

[06:33] a Jurassic Park moment. You know they didn't stop to think if they should they just made it. It's

[06:38] like USOB's actually did it and the game has been a colossal failure and that game ironically has

[06:46] tanked this entire company. So good job David Fixx on building something that absolutely destroyed

[06:53] your company. And then from there they went and made the dumbest game you could ever follow up

[06:59] Tank Force with and that's with Barry O's barbecue challenge. This homage to Barry Osler and the

[07:07] irony in that game is that barely barely Barry didn't even design the game. It was like designed by

[07:16] four different designers and then you look at the game and canada could have designed it blindfolded.

[07:22] There's nothing in the game that's interesting. And so they absolutely have no clue what people

[07:28] want. And you know who I blame. You know who I blame. Mukesh. Mukesh has no idea what he's doing.

[07:35] He's not a pinhead. He's not a pinball fanatic. And you got to remember this people. American

[07:41] pinball's failure is the long end tail of karma and the bad karma. And the reason why this company

[07:50] has failed is because all of this company was created around John Papadouk Jr. People forget

[07:58] that J-pop is the origin story of American pinball. Amtron was making the boards for John's Zidware

[08:07] games. You know there's a lot of rookie podcasters out there that have only been around for a year

[08:13] and they have no idea about any of this. And when they cheerlead these companies they have no idea

[08:20] how stupid it is to cheerlead stuff until you learn your history. Here's a history lesson from

[08:25] canada. J-pop was using Amtron boards. They were out a lot of money because John Papadouk couldn't get

[08:33] his product to market. And so what did they decide to do? People forget this. They brought in J-pop

[08:39] into the Amtron facility and they reinvested $350,000 to build 22 broken Magic Girl games.

[08:53] All right. They had no idea what they were doing. They could not walk down an aisle of J-pop tinkering

[09:00] inside those boxes and realize that they had no idea what he was doing. He had no idea how to

[09:07] make a working game. There was no code for the game. There was nothing. And they actually put

[09:11] those games in boxes and mailed them to customers with a letter that said the following. We have

[09:19] built these games to John Papadouk and Zidware's specifications. You know what that AKA meant?

[09:26] You know what the real meaning was that in? We just sent you a broken, crappy product, but it's not

[09:32] our fault. He made it that way, not us. And we just contract, manufactured a damn thing. That's

[09:39] the beginning of American Pimble. And I'm going to go down a road here. I'm going to pick apart

[09:45] another person. So you've got John Papadouk, a complete moron. Everything he's done is lit money

[09:50] on fire. Okay, then you've got Mukesh, who has no idea how to pinpoint good leadership in Pimble.

[09:57] And from the very beginning, it was like his son or cousin running the company,

[10:02] and they didn't know what they were doing. And then they had this guy like Scott Goldstein.

[10:07] People forget this. Scott Goldstein was like the marketing guy. They fired his ass. Then they fired

[10:12] John Papadouk. Then they brought in Joe Balser to sort of like fix John Papadouk's Houdini.

[10:18] And Balser didn't even create a whitewood. I mean, do people remember this? Balser did not even

[10:24] create a whitewood. He basically built Houdini by eyeballing it. And when the game came out,

[10:30] it showed. The game played like crap. The shots were so tight, he clearly didn't take enough time

[10:37] to dial in the game. And then they idiotically shelved all of the artwork from the Houdini art

[10:45] package that Matt Andrews made that was gorgeous. And then they made this ugly art package. You

[10:50] know why? Because Josh Coogler, the coder, gosh, Coogler, who's only at that time, Coogler's only

[10:57] input into Pimble was his own family Pimble machine. He didn't like the Houdini artwork.

[11:02] And him and Balser, with no artistic eye whatsoever, shelved one of the most beautiful art packages

[11:09] ever in the history of Pimble. They shelved it and made this ugly, dark steampunk Houdini game.

[11:15] And the rest is history. It didn't sell that well. And then they make Oktoberfest, which arguably,

[11:21] when you look at Oktoberfest, it is one of the most packed modern Pimble machines we've had

[11:26] in the last 10 years. And the reason why they made Oktoberfest is because that was Joe Balser's

[11:32] selection to make. And if you know Joe Balser's backstory, I don't know if I'd be making a game

[11:38] that celebrates drinking. I'll stop at that, but you know, don't even want to go down that road

[11:43] because you're not allowed to bring up these things. Okay, so he makes that game arguably,

[11:48] a much better game than Houdini. And then what do they do? They hire the worst art package in the

[11:54] history of Pimble in the Oktoberfest like art package. It looks like somebody vomited over

[12:00] the damn play field. And it just was ugly. You know, I mean, if they could have salvaged that game,

[12:06] if they at least made it look awesome, but it didn't. And then after that, what did they do next?

[12:12] They did hot wheels, right? Okay, so then they are like, all right, Joe Balser, they stripped

[12:16] everything out of hot wheels. Okay, they stripped everything out of hot wheels. No, it's not a low

[12:22] blow, John. It's not a low blow. If you want to, if you want to, I just want, you know, I'm not

[12:27] going to go down this road, John, but if you want to do what some of these people have done,

[12:31] and then we're not allowed to bring it up like multiple times, you know, it's, it's, it's putting

[12:36] people and their families in jeopardy. I'm sorry, you don't get, you don't get immunity from bringing

[12:42] that stuff up, brother. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Absolutely not. Okay, absolutely not. But we're

[12:47] not even going to go down that road. We're already past that. You then make hot wheels, you make hot

[12:52] wheels, and it's like, you make hot wheels, and it's like, you remove all the jumps, all the ramps,

[13:00] all the stuff from the game. All right, you remove all that from the game, and you make this barren

[13:06] game that you want to be successful on location. All right, it doesn't sell well because you removed

[13:12] all the stuff that's hot wheels. Then you go and you make a legends of a hola, and then it's tank

[13:18] force, then it's burials, and that's it. Right. It's like, you could just zoom out and stare at these

[13:25] pinball companies, portfolios, and American Pinball has probably one of the worst portfolios

[13:33] over the last nine years. And after nine years of making games, I don't know why. I don't know why

[13:40] it's been such a miss. Why? Why has it been such a miss? They had all the opportunities in the world

[13:48] to do market research, to bring a game to market that people would want. They seemingly did none of

[13:53] it. And so here we are today, a company with very little value, very little customers, and now

[14:02] Steve Bowden. Okay, Steve Bowden, this guy keeps jumping from company to company. I don't know if

[14:08] they're just paying him with bunk beds and ham sandwiches, but what value? I mean, he was over

[14:13] at Deeproot for years, and people forget this. Again, we're all allowed to forget this. People

[14:18] forget that Steve Bowden got up there as a Deeproot team member and took the microphone, did a media

[14:26] tour with Jeff T. Ollis and everybody. I mean, again, we're just supposed to bury all this.

[14:30] Did a media tour in which he was promoting Deeproot Pinball to get people to put deposits on Raza,

[14:38] and he got up there and remember his phrase, just wait, just wait. You haven't seen anything yet,

[14:44] and he got up on stage in front of everybody and they insulted Stern Pinball. They bragged about how

[14:51] they were going to make more games than any pinball company in the history of pinball,

[14:55] and Steve Bowden was never held accountable for any of that. He never apologized once for his role

[15:03] in aiding and abetting a criminal. Now, I threw a drink in Tim Sexton's face. I apologize. That's

[15:09] jackass move. If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have done it, and I've apologized multiple times

[15:16] for that. When I make a mistake, I will apologize to you. I mean, that's it. If I was aiding and

[15:23] abetting a company that ripped off old women, old ladies, these are grandmas, Robert Mueller

[15:30] stole the life savings of people. He stole the life savings of people and then created Deeproot

[15:38] around that stolen money. Every day, Steve Bowden walked into that company, John Norris,

[15:45] Barry Oh, Dennis Norbin for a little bit. Was in J-pop over there? J-pop? He went into that company

[15:53] every day and didn't see any manufacturing, saw a stupid pin pod, and saw all this dumb innovation,

[16:01] like a lockdown bar screen. He convinced people to go in on the company and never once apologized,

[16:10] and now he's at American Pinball. Ryan McQuade, you know what I heard? I heard from someone who

[16:15] used to work at American Pinball. You want to hear truth on this episode or should we just

[16:20] all turn this off? I hear there's a new podcast maybe coming out that's going to spread

[16:27] pinball happiness. I could just end this whole thing right now and we could go join Colin and the

[16:34] new Pinball Happiness crew and circle jerk this industry in a way that just forgives all of this

[16:41] behavior and just allows these people to rip people off, never have any accountability,

[16:48] and just do what they do best. Champion everything pinball even when they're championing people who

[16:54] are frauds and criminals and all this stuff. Or I could tell you what really went on. I could

[17:01] tell you what really went on. Okay, so now you got Ryan McQuade over there. You want to know what an

[17:05] American Pinball engineer who left the company said he's like nothing's going on over there every day.

[17:11] Ryan McQuade goes into work and he spends most of the day playing video games. Well,

[17:15] it's not surprising he's a video game guy. But where is his game? I heard Cuphead, I don't know.

[17:21] I don't think they're going to make it. I heard that it's like, it's not that great or they don't

[17:26] have the money for the parts. I've heard a lot of rumors. I don't know anything for sure. I haven't

[17:29] seen it, but it doesn't look good. It doesn't look good for American Pinball. And again,

[17:35] I'm just going to say this right now and correct me if I'm wrong people, correct me if I'm wrong.

[17:40] If American Pinball went away tomorrow, would any of you care with what's going on in pinball right

[17:47] now? If American Pinball went away tomorrow, how many of you raise of hands would actually miss

[17:55] them? Are you going to miss Galactic Tank Force, Baryos, Oktoberfest? You wouldn't even feel it.

[18:03] You would miss me more if I went away tomorrow. I mean, there would be more, and this is hard for

[18:09] me to say this, there would be more tears shed in the pinball community if Canada retired versus

[18:17] American Pinball going out of business. I have more followers than they can sell of a single title.

[18:23] And that's sad for them. Believe me, if I was making a pinball company, if I was David Fix,

[18:29] if I was in charge of Mukesh's money, I would be selling more games than people subscribing to

[18:36] Canada's Pinball Podcast. And I say that self-deprecatingly. You should, if you're a pinball manufacturer

[18:44] and you can't sell more games than Canada has Patreon subscribers, you have no business making

[18:52] pinball machines. That should be a motto in the pinball world. It should be on the wall of every

[18:59] single pinball company. That is your first benchmark of success. Will this game sell more units than

[19:08] subscribers to Canada's Pinball Podcast? You know what game will not sell more units than

[19:14] subscribers? John Wick LE. John Wick LE will not sell more than 714 LEs. They will never sell that

[19:25] many. So that is the first topic of today, which is American Pinball. Coming in hot.

[19:32] Canada's coming in hot. I'm reading your commentary, guys. Thank you for hanging out here.

[19:36] I just don't think anyone's going to miss them. I think David Fix and Ryan McQuade and Steve Bowden,

[19:42] every time I see them go live, I get this sense of delusional smugness on their faces.

[19:50] And when David Fix did that, like, I don't know, like alive a few weeks ago, he was like,

[19:55] we're in it for the long haul. And there was like Vishal, I think that was his name,

[20:00] standing there next to them. And you just get the sense, it's like Mukesh has got a lot of money.

[20:06] He doesn't know what he's doing. He's got bad leadership. And they've had enough leadership

[20:12] decisions where at this point in the company's history, after nine years, we should be celebrating

[20:18] American Pinball, not chastising them. And they did it to themselves. They did it to themselves.

[20:26] I mean, it's just that simple. Okay. So, Canada coming in hot. 85, 86 people get to hear it,

[20:33] 1500 people get to hear it later on. All right, what do I want to talk about next? I kind of

[20:38] just want to do this show the way I want to do it. And I hope you guys are on board for it because,

[20:43] you know, I'm feeling feisty. I close on my house on Monday. I'm super excited. The family's doing

[20:52] great. The reason I'm sleeping on a pullout couch is simply this, we've got baby Cassian

[20:59] in this second apartment. We've got a pullout couch in the other apartment. So I sleep in that

[21:04] apartment with Killian. And Brenda does the night shifts in shifts in this apartment with Cassian.

[21:13] And it's been like that for a few weeks. So I'm a little bit irritable. Yeah, it's going to end

[21:19] though. In just a week, we move on June 13th and we close on June 3rd. So super excited. A lot of

[21:28] great stuff going on in my world and in my household. So I'm very thankful. I'm very thankful for each

[21:34] and every one of you and your support. And, you know, I just think it's great. I think it's great

[21:39] what we've built here because this is the next topic I want to talk about. And then I will talk

[21:44] about Stern, what's going on at JJP. But I want to talk, you know what? I'm going to wait. I'm

[21:50] going to wait. We get a little bit more people here in 15 minutes. What I want to talk about in

[21:53] 15 minutes, I want to talk about an ask I have to all pinball content creators. And it's a very,

[22:02] it's a very simple ask. It's something that I hope everyone can just put into practice. And I think

[22:07] if everybody does, I think we'll just get much better pinball content moving forward. And it's

[22:13] not negative. It's just asking everybody to do one simple thing. And that's it. Okay, before we get

[22:18] there, let's talk about this media tour. Raise of hands. Am I the only one who's just, I'm just over

[22:26] the story. I'm glad they did it. I'm glad people went to go see Stern pinball. I don't have, I

[22:33] don't have a problem with it. You know me, I wasn't expecting an invite. So I'm not upset. I didn't

[22:38] get invited. You can listen to all my shows. I've never once complained about not being invited.

[22:43] I didn't do like a crazy ranch show like Albert and then take it down. I'm fine with it. I don't

[22:49] want to be invited to those things because accepting those things is a conflict of interest for me.

[22:57] I always want to remain objective. And I don't want to hold back how I feel because someone gave

[23:03] me pizza and beer. To me, the power to be free and to speak freely is much more valuable to getting

[23:12] free pizza and beer and a, you know, a prom bus to an arcade. Like I don't need that. I can go to

[23:20] Logan's arcade. I can go there on my own. I can go to Jack bar. I can spend my own money on food and

[23:25] drink. But you know, look, here's my thing about this media tour. And I've seen more coverage come

[23:31] from it. I just don't really see anything interesting as a result of it. All I'm reading when I read

[23:38] the stories is how people personally felt about the experience, which is great. Like, you know,

[23:44] you bring in Jason Knapp loved it, Colin, he loved it. You know, we got Ian over at Nudge

[23:50] magazine loved it. There was more content. Everyone who went had a great time. And of course, like,

[23:57] you'd be a moron. And I mean, you'd be a you shouldn't be in this hobby. If you didn't get

[24:02] excited about the world's number one pinball company, giving you an all expense paid trip

[24:09] to come walk through their factory and give you unprecedented access to not only their facility,

[24:16] but their executives and their company. I mean, yeah, if they invited me, I would want to go,

[24:23] but I still wouldn't go. Not on not on that kind of trip. I would accept an invite from Gomez or

[24:31] Seth Davis or Zach Sharp. But it would only have to be me. And the reason why is I would want to

[24:38] get in a room with those gentlemen. And I would really want to have a true heart to heart discussion

[24:44] about everything, you know, everything, I don't want to go there with a group of people because I

[24:49] don't think it would be appropriate for me to have the kind of conversation I want to have with

[24:55] them. And it's not negative. But I just don't think it would be productive on on both fronts

[25:01] for me to visit that place in a group setting. I also think being the world's favorite and

[25:07] number one pinball podcaster for seven years in a row, let's face it, people, I would have taken

[25:12] that trippy easily. I think it's funny to me that after seven years and, you know, building enough

[25:20] of an audience that has enough of an influence that does impact their business, they've absolutely

[25:26] done nothing to build a bridge with me. Nothing. And that's fine. It's fine. Again, I don't,

[25:32] I don't have harsh feelings about it. I've bought stern machines. I've owned stern machines. I love

[25:37] some stern machines. I don't necessarily agree with their business decisions of late. And that is

[25:43] the reason why I think going over there was so strategically timed because I think it's quite

[25:49] obvious that they're in a slump, that John Wick is a terrible selling game. And I don't care if like

[25:57] one outlier distributor wants to convince you otherwise. And that's not even that's not even

[26:02] Zach doing that. You know, I see some, I see some of these distros, man, and they're like,

[26:07] game selling great. They just don't lie to us. I mean, it's not selling great. I just would love

[26:12] to go over there and have a more adult, mature conversation with Stern, because I have some

[26:17] strong opinions and I know they do too. And I think it would be a really great conversation.

[26:24] And I think it would be completely off the record. And that's the kind of meeting I want to have

[26:28] with Stern Pinball. And I'm just going to say this, and I don't mean to say this in a bragging

[26:32] way. But I think I've earned the right. And so have they. I think we both parties have earned the

[26:37] right to have more of a one on one meeting. I do. I just I just think that's the way I would want

[26:44] to interact with them. I don't want to I don't want to, you know, it's just not me. It's not my

[26:49] brand. It's not my style to take your beer and your pizza and just be smiling like a like a little,

[26:55] you know, like a like a, I don't know, like a cheerleader in front of your John Wick Ali's.

[26:59] And we all saw that content. And I get I get it. Like some people are really excited. But I also

[27:06] think that, you know, this media tour was a very thinly veiled attempt to get John Wick sales going.

[27:13] You know, Don bought a John Wick Ali, right? And Don over at Don's pinball podcast, he bought a

[27:18] John Wick Ali. And now I'm not surprised. I mean, he's bought a lot of games recently, and he seems

[27:24] to buy a lot. Now, he's also sponsored by Mad Pinball, which is a distributor. So I highly doubt

[27:30] that Don is paying 13,000 for it. But he bought one, right? And that's part of what you don't hear

[27:38] him really talking about it very much, which is I don't usually he's much more like enthusiastic

[27:43] about his purchases. He just lost three to $4,000 on that game, if he paid full price. And I think

[27:50] that's what is just the reality with this game. To me, it doesn't even matter. I mean, I hate to

[27:58] say this, but it doesn't even matter how the game plays. It doesn't matter what the code is.

[28:05] None of it matters to me, because you're going to end up with a three to $4,000 loss. So I don't

[28:13] care how shiny the translate is. I don't care what the mirrored back glass stained glass window

[28:19] looks like. I don't care that you put blind Elon Musk on the right side of the cabinet.

[28:24] I don't care about, you know, Seth Davis's signature. The reality is, if you buy a John Wick

[28:31] LE, you are losing three to $4,000 by the end of the year. And when Stern builds all 1000 of these

[28:40] games, they're going to be piling up in that warehouse in Chicago that has thousands of

[28:47] unsold Stern LE games. I don't know if they're all LE games, but thousands of unsold new and box

[28:53] games. And so to me, that's the end of the conversation. Why would you? Because it's real

[28:58] simple people. If we turn off common sense and just become shill cheerleaders for the industry,

[29:06] as if we are investors in Stern pinball, why would anybody with common sense buy a John Wick LE

[29:16] for $13,000 when they know looking at James Bond, looking at Foo Fighters and looking at Venom,

[29:25] when they know that every single Stern LE that does not have tremendous demand is going to lose you

[29:34] three to $4,000 within six months? So why would anybody buy it? You know, so if Don wants to

[29:41] lose three to $4,000 more power to him, if you ordered one and you want to lose three to $4,000

[29:48] more power to you, but for $60 a year, you could join Canadian pinball podcast and I will break

[29:56] you of your FOMO. I will break you of needing that game and I will encourage you to wait six months.

[30:05] And by the time six months is up, you will be able, if you want to, to buy a John Wick LE

[30:12] when it's fully coded for $9,000 probably. And why wouldn't you just do that? That just seems

[30:21] like the common sense move. And you know who doesn't want you to approach pinball that way?

[30:29] Stern pinball doesn't, Jersey Jack doesn't, dealers and distributors don't. But why would

[30:36] anybody who makes pinball content be on the side of the manufacturer? Why would anybody who makes

[30:43] pinball content unless they themselves are distributors or dealers? Why would anybody who

[30:50] makes content be advocating for the profitability or the ability to earn more profit unless they

[30:59] had some reason why? Okay, so John Wick LE is just going to be a forgotten game. It's a, you know,

[31:08] it's a tree falling in the forest and that leads us to what's next from Stern. So clearly Stern

[31:14] seems to be in some sort of panic. And the media tour was the first move. The next move is going to be,

[31:22] I think, getting this anniversary edition of Metallica out in July because remember it's

[31:27] June already. So we are going to get in maybe four weeks, maybe six weeks, another Stern machine.

[31:34] I mean, talk about the nailing the coffin for John Wick. And this is what's going to create

[31:40] John Wick price dump so much faster than the end of the year is once they move on to Metallica,

[31:47] the demand for John Wick is going to evaporate. It's already dead, but it's going to be less than zero

[31:54] when Metallica anniversary edition comes out in July. But all of this is indicative of a larger

[32:02] thing happening in our hobby. And I think people forget this, everybody, I want to just say this.

[32:08] I think there's this delusion that Stern pinball can't fail. Like they're just going to be around

[32:15] forever because they're number one. I just want to name a few companies that failed at the height

[32:21] of their pinball operations. And these are major companies. You might know some of them.

[32:26] One of them was called Sega. Another was called Capcom. Another was called Bali Williams. All

[32:34] right. Another was called Gottlieb. All right. So when you say and remember when all those companies

[32:41] failed, Stern pinball was making some of the worst pinball machines in the world. And because all

[32:48] the quality companies just like went out of business or decided to stop making games, the brand that

[32:55] basically was making the worst survived. Now look, that being said, Stern has made some phenomenal

[33:02] games. I mean, some phenomenal games over the years. And they have a phenomenal portfolio. They

[33:09] have the best portfolio in the history of pinball. Their portfolio is better than Bali Williams.

[33:15] They've knocked it out of the park way more times than they've whiffed. But they screwed themselves.

[33:23] Seth Davis and the modern pricing has destroyed Stern pinball in my honest opinion. They've

[33:30] absolutely destroyed and killed their own golden goose. This entire hobby is driven by FOMO. It is.

[33:40] It's driven by FOMO. You need to, when you release a game, you need to create that like one week sales

[33:48] window where like a few thousand people are going to want to get through the door, get their order

[33:54] in, and you need to secure that money. You know why? Because in that first week is when Stern

[34:00] sells all of their allocations to all of their dealers and distros, and they have hundreds of

[34:06] dealers. And so if each one's going to get five or 10 or 20 or 30 LEs, they don't care about you and me.

[34:16] They want to sell through those to distros and dealers. But they got greedy and they overpriced

[34:23] everything. And unless you're a millionaire and you can afford to lose three to four thousand

[34:27] dollars on LEs, because people trust me when I say this, if you have FOMO around a premium,

[34:36] I think you need to go to the doctor. So if you let go of your LE FOMO, which I think is stupid

[34:42] now, I think buying LEs is dumb. LEs are losing the most amount of money out of everything. So if

[34:48] buying an LE is dumb, then why would anyone chase anything new in box that's less than a premium,

[34:55] right? Or a premium or pro? Why? They're going to make premiums forever. And if you buy one brand new,

[35:04] you're basically going to have to wait for the code to be done. And by the time the code is complete,

[35:10] you can easily save yourself a thousand or fifteen hundred bucks. And again, just comes down to common

[35:14] sense. And look, it wasn't like this. It was never like this before. This is what pinball was like

[35:20] before. And again, for some of the newbie content creators, sit down and take notes. Because you

[35:26] weren't around when this was what made all of us fall in love with the hobby. What was around before

[35:33] was a different model. Every LE sold out on day one, every single one, right? And there was 500.

[35:40] So there was always more demand than supply. And so the people that were in this hobby,

[35:45] the longest, have the relationships with the dealers in the distros, and they were able to get one,

[35:50] right? And that was that was the way it should be, right? I've been in this, I've been scratching your

[35:55] back. I've been buying games from you. You're going to hook me up by putting me on your LE list.

[36:00] And even if I don't want that LE, I know that if I get it and I buy every LE, it's never going to

[36:06] lose value. And if I want to move it on, yeah, I could scalp it. And guess who paid the scalping

[36:11] prices? It was never us. It was never the core community. It was never the diehard fans. You

[36:19] know who paid the scalping prices? Guys like Don, newbies. It was newbies who came in who had no

[36:26] idea the game even exists. I would not really don't to be fair. Like it was more like people who

[36:30] didn't even know this hobby existed, right? When I flipped Batman LE and I flipped Ghost Buster's

[36:37] LE for like $2,000 each, you know who bought these games? People that had never bought a game before

[36:43] and they didn't care. They discovered it well after the core community got their hands on the LE.

[36:49] And that's how it always should be. And now what Stern has done is they've increased the supply so

[36:56] much and the price so much that now it's not enticing to anybody. It's not enticing to the core

[37:04] community because you've made so many, nothing is rare, nothing is special and nothing holds value.

[37:09] And it's not enticing to the casual newbie who just discovers it because people are struggling in the

[37:15] real world to pay mortgages and for food and for gala. Like it's just they're not waking up and being

[37:21] like, oh honey, even though we're struggling, I'm going to go buy a $13,000 pinball LE. It's just

[37:26] not going to happen. Yeah, when they were 7,500, sure. But people can't afford to do that consistently

[37:31] now and definitely not three times a year. And so they've kind of ruined it all. They've ruined it

[37:37] all. And like, I've been watching this for 10 years and I don't like how far they took it. And then

[37:45] even as the market softens up and even as people are telling Stern and Jersey Jack like and barrels

[37:52] of fun and spooky, I mean, guys, nobody, there's only been one game that is ostensibly sold out

[38:00] in 2024. There's two games basically, but one was from a year prior. The only two games that

[38:07] really sold out were Pulp Fiction LE and Jaws LE, everything else, everything else, right?

[38:14] Everything else, they've supplied more of them than there is demand. That's not good. That's not

[38:21] good. That's a problem. That's a problem. The only way out now for all of these companies

[38:28] is they need to release bangers that are going to create more demand. And that's why I love

[38:35] covering this hobby because the pressure is on. And Stern Pinball is going to feel more pressure

[38:41] than anybody. They are because this remake of Metallica, it's going to be met with enthusiasm

[38:48] and resistance. They are going to have to, this is a tightrope walk for them because they've got

[38:54] five to 6,000 Metallica owners out there in the world who are going to have feelings about this.

[39:00] Some of them might embrace it and not care. Some of them might feel like Stern is burning them.

[39:06] Some of them, you know, are going to maybe trade up for the new game, but it's not really, I think,

[39:13] the right way to go if you're Stern. If you're a pinball company and you want to make three brand

[39:18] new games a year, that's enough. That's enough. You can't do that and then vault all these older

[39:27] games and torpedo the value of your old buyers. You know, they're burning the candle at both ends.

[39:35] And why am I seemingly the only person who sees this? It just, I just don't get it. Does nobody

[39:43] see this? Does Seth Davis know something I don't about business? Because it sure seems like

[39:49] Stern Pinball is burning the candle at both ends and I think the response has been clear.

[39:54] Like it's not making people happy. Look, Metallica, I'm excited to see it. I think for me, the main

[40:00] thing I'm curious about is what's the art package because Dirty Donnie and Stern are no longer

[40:06] together. I don't even think Dirty Donnie and Metallica are together. And I know Zambietti

[40:11] has done Metallica artwork. So I'm curious to see what this game ends up looking like.

[40:16] Going to be very, very interesting. It's going to be an interesting July. I think June is going

[40:20] to be kind of boring. I think June is boring because I don't think anything is going to happen in

[40:24] June. I don't. I don't think multi-morphics going to get Princess Bride out in June. I don't think

[40:31] anyone cares about Haggis. I know they sense Kelly Daniel, a fully populated play field.

[40:36] That's cool. It doesn't change my mind that Haggis, I still think, is done. I don't think

[40:41] there's any new money coming to bail Damien out. I heard something this week that Damien

[40:48] is looking for an investor so he can move the whole operation to America that he's realized it's

[40:54] too expensive to do this in Australia. Maybe you should have thought of that before you set up shop

[40:59] there, but you know, his family's there. I don't think he's going to find that investor. I think

[41:04] Haggis Pimball is done. I think there's no demand and I think he's evaporated any trust between the

[41:11] community and him. Again, he has nobody to blame but himself. He's the one who built that company

[41:17] on the promise of transparency and he didn't deliver on that. That's on him. I could say all

[41:23] the unkind things I want, but if I was running my company and I promised you I would be transparent

[41:29] and give you weekly updates and let you in on the journey and I took your money and then I

[41:35] absolutely went radio silent for months, I don't think I would deserve your respect. I don't think

[41:41] I would deserve you to be a repeat customer and I think people deserve refunds right now.

[41:49] The reason why I think people deserve refunds right now is I think they were lied to. I think

[41:56] everyone who gave money on Centaur was lied to. They gave that money on the promise that

[42:01] fathoms would be done by the end of the year. They gave that money on the promise that production

[42:07] for Centaur would be in January. Thank you for the stars, Mark. When you lie to people like that

[42:13] and you mislead them, I don't know why you're not accountable. I don't know why.

[42:19] The refunds, Zach promised the refunds if the company went out of business. The company's not

[42:24] out of business. I'm not putting pressure. I think it's Damien who should give the refunds. I think

[42:28] Damien should refund the money to Zach. I've said this and I'll say it again. I'm not mad at anything

[42:34] over at flipping out. I think Damien is the issue. Damien, if you have people Centaur money

[42:42] and you haven't done anything with it, give it back because I'm a little worried that that money

[42:47] is clearly going to be used now for restructuring costs and for finishing the fathom builds and

[42:53] then where does the money come from for Centaur's if you've spent that deposit money elsewhere?

[42:59] We've seen this many times before. It's nothing new. I also think there is definitely blame to go

[43:05] around to the buyers of Centaur. If you bought a Centaur and you sent in money, it is sort of the

[43:12] equivalent of going on a date with Puff Daddy now. If you go on a date with Puff Daddy now

[43:21] and he abuses you, you've got to take some blame because now we know. We know he's an animal.

[43:30] I really do think the same thing of in a lot of ways, Haggis showed us

[43:36] their true colors all throughout the fathom journey. People paid in full for Centaur. They

[43:43] gave the dude $17,500 and I think those people knew better or should have known better.

[43:53] To me Haggis and American Pinball, if we snapped our fingers and they went away tomorrow, nobody

[43:59] misses them. If Jersey Jack went away tomorrow, if Stern went away tomorrow, if CGC went away

[44:05] tomorrow, if Spooky went away tomorrow, I think they'd be severely missed. I think they would

[44:11] always be demand to bring them back. I don't think the same, I don't know, like multi-morphic,

[44:18] they're not in that like, oh, we got to do whatever we can to keep them around. Nope.

[44:22] You got to earn that right. You got to earn the right to be in demand and to be missed and to be

[44:28] forgotten. Any company that can't sell more games than Canada can sell subscriptions is in big trouble.

[44:37] I say that in a self-deprecating way. I have more subscribers than some of these companies

[44:43] can sell games and that's embarrassing for them, not embarrassing for me. Spooky Luke,

[44:50] yeah, I agree. I would be sad too, brother. I want to talk about Spooky for a little bit because

[44:55] Spooky really hasn't made much airtime on my Saturday morning spectaculars in a long time.

[45:03] And I think the reason why I don't talk about Spooky very much is it's just sort of all going

[45:09] pretty well. It's kind of just business as usual. They are making games consistently and I think

[45:17] they have a lot more happy customers than unhappy customers. I don't like either theme and they,

[45:24] I'm just going to be candid. Both themes are not for me and I'm not excited about either theme,

[45:31] but I'm excited that some people are excited and I look and I know they're coming out with

[45:37] themes that are going to be much more exciting for me. And so Spooky Luke and Bug and Team over

[45:44] there, I want to just raise my cup of water but whatever. Consider this, maybe this, just imagine

[45:50] this being champagne. And I want to say congratulations to a company that gets the least

[45:57] amount of airtime on Canada because they don't mess stuff up. That's it. Like when you're not

[46:04] getting talked about on Canada's Saturday morning, you're doing something right. That should be the

[46:08] other motto on a company wall. If we can't sell more games, then Canada has subscribers, we suck.

[46:17] And any week that Canada doesn't mention us is a good week. We're doing stuff right.

[46:24] Okay, we're doing stuff right. I also know that, and I can tell this just because Hilton has been

[46:29] just like verbally masturbating how excited he is about the themes to come, which is exciting.

[46:37] I do know that Spooky Pimball, what they have coming is probably going to

[46:43] catapult them into another level. And I think they know what they have and I think they are so

[46:50] excited to get to it. And I love that. I mean, every game should be a better version of what

[46:56] you've done before. And I don't think we can say that about Stern. I mean, John Wick is not a better

[47:02] version than what Stern did before. I am so tired of hearing about the John Wick assets. I don't want

[47:10] like 45 minutes of video clips. I want an amazing game. And it's just that simple.

[47:19] All right, so what else is going on in the world of pinball? So let me just address real quick,

[47:24] and then I just want to move on because, you know, like in the spirit of camaraderie in the world of

[47:31] pinball content creation in a world in which I think there's divided camps. And I think here's

[47:37] the ask I have from all pinball content creators. And it's just very simple ask. All I ask when you

[47:43] make pinball content is that you be real, right? You be real. And what I mean by being real,

[47:51] I don't mean you have to love everything or hate everything or have, you know, polarizing opinions

[47:59] just to get an audience. What I mean by being real is I just hope that moving forward,

[48:07] pinball content creators can tell us when the mic is on, when the camera is rolling,

[48:15] how they really feel about a game, about maybe a person or maybe an art package or a code or

[48:24] instead of telling everybody privately how you really feel about a game or walking around a show.

[48:31] Let me give you an example. A guy walks around a show tells everybody how he really feels about

[48:38] venom, right? Doesn't like it. He's got a premium. He doesn't think the game is great. You know,

[48:45] to people over beers, you get how they really feel. And then when they do their show and the

[48:52] camera's on and they're recording, they glow about the game and they praise it and they say nothing

[49:00] but positive things because to them being fake to the audience allows them access to these

[49:09] manufacturers. And we know when I think about why would anybody do that? Like why would you,

[49:17] if you just don't like a movie or you didn't enjoy a meal, it's okay to say, hey, like,

[49:25] and in a constructive way, hey, like, here's why I don't like venom or here's, you know, here are

[49:31] the things I would have done differently. You don't have to be a jerk about it like Canada,

[49:35] but I've just noticed lately a lot of that where like, you're going to say privately how you feel

[49:43] and then, you know, and then when you get on the public airwaves, you gush about everything.

[49:48] You know, the other thing that's happened to me recently and, you know, it's just, it's just

[49:53] unfortunate is Brenna's in the house is basically, you know, I've established a lot of friendships

[50:01] in pinball and I've made some great friends and I consider some of you to be some of my best friends

[50:07] and I've loved that about this hobby. I think this hobby brings people together on a level,

[50:12] on a level that is amazing because ultimately the games are not worth the money, but the friendships

[50:18] are priceless. And once you realize that, you know, you realize that, all right, I've already

[50:24] paid my ticket because that's how I think about this hobby. The moment you sort of either own a

[50:29] few games or go to tournaments and shows or join a league night or go to your local operator,

[50:36] the moment you invest a certain amount of time in pinball, it's like your hand's been stamped

[50:41] and you can come and go as you please within the community and you can converse with people on a

[50:48] daily basis in an educated and articulate way about the hobby and why you love it and all this

[50:54] stuff. And that's where it's fun. And it like, and when people are huddled together and they're real,

[51:00] you know, and I see it all the time. I see it at shows. I see it at the bar. I see it on my

[51:05] Canada chat, on Patreon. I see it on pin side. I see it on Facebook. When you really get together

[51:12] and you don't hold back, it's so much more, to me, it's so much more real. It's more engaging. It's

[51:17] more authentic. And again, like I've built some great friendships. Now, recently, recently, you

[51:25] know, one of my best friends, Jengiz, was mad at me because I said that I found Kerry Hardy's video

[51:32] to be funny, right? When this whole gun gate, and I wanted to say this, when you make content,

[51:38] you have to, you have to, when you make content, you have to have some thick skin. And, you know,

[51:44] if you want to put up stuff like Kerry wants to wave a gun around, right, Kerry? I saw that,

[51:49] or use like quotes about Hitler and all the like, you got to have thick skin because people are

[51:53] going to react, right? And as a content creator, you're going to make people react. And so when you

[51:58] do that, and you put up content, the other thing that's going to happen is people are going to

[52:03] punch back, like they're going to make fun of you, like they're going to, they're going to use what

[52:07] you do. I mean, nobody gets made fun of or insult it more than me. And when that happens, you got

[52:12] to have thick enough skin to just take it, right? To just take it, you can punch back, you could

[52:18] ignore it, you can do it ever. But unfortunately, one of my best friends in pinball, you know,

[52:24] decided to not only stop talking to me, not only that, right? He said, I'm never going to share

[52:30] anything with you again, personally. Okay, fine, because I said Kerry's video was funny. But then

[52:35] went on a tour to celebrate all the people he knows hate me, right? Right? Next, next podcast,

[52:44] next video, Don t shirt, then Zach's t, which is cool. Like it's everyone's prerogative to do that.

[52:49] But, you know, unfortunately, when you do that, and you say we're friends, and then you go on a,

[52:54] you know, a tour and hang out with everybody that despises me. In my, in my, in my Italian culture,

[53:03] I, you know, there is a value of loyalty, right? And having some loyalty to friends. And I do mean

[53:09] this. And this is what's always hard in pinball, especially in the content space, especially

[53:13] everywhere is sometimes I think people don't understand the value of loyalty and what that means

[53:19] is, and I'm going to explain another great example is I got my best friend in pinball is Derek,

[53:27] right? Derek Stutzman. He's my best friend in pinball, arguably maybe my best friend in the

[53:33] world. We talk almost every day. And I value his friendship more than any game. And and his,

[53:40] his, his daily connection to me has helped me through so many hard times. And I'm super happy

[53:46] to see he's just moved to California. He got out of pinball right now. And you know who we bought

[53:52] all his games from? Zach many, Zach many, my best friend. Well, not all of his games, but he's bought

[53:58] from Zach before and never once, never once through all of our friendship. Did I ever ask

[54:05] Derek not to buy from Zach, even if Zach and I have had issues, I've never once asked that of

[54:10] them. Now, you know, it might be different if Derek, every time I saw him, he's wearing flipping

[54:14] out T shirts and, and, and, you know, and just doing, you know, three minute ads for flipping

[54:20] out every time, you know, he does, he did some content. But here's, here's the thing. And I want

[54:25] to, I want to explain why, you know, this latest thing has got me a little bit, you know, just,

[54:30] just want to talk about it candidly. So, so if you're going to do that, then I don't want you

[54:36] around anymore. I don't want you around anymore because it's fake. And I don't want to be fake

[54:41] with anybody. And I don't want to be friends with someone who tells me they're not going to be real

[54:45] with me, that they're not going to tell me anything personal, then just go away. And so

[54:51] you're not going to be singing jengas hanging out here anymore. You know, and I'm just over it.

[54:57] I'm over the thin skin nature of some people. I'm over how they take their ball and they go home.

[55:04] And I'm just over all of it. Like if you want to be friends with me, and if I, and if I've upset you,

[55:10] then then be a man and pick up the phone and talk to somebody. But no, it's like the tails are

[55:16] between the legs, then it's celebrating all of my competition. And I don't roll like that.

[55:22] I don't roll like that. And I also don't get down on my knees for anybody, for anybody. And I'm the

[55:28] best friend you can have. And if you have my friendship, Hector, I'm looking at you,

[55:32] Bill Brandis, I'm looking at you, Derek, I'm looking at you, Joe, a body, you get like, and for most

[55:37] of you out there, trust me, we're friends. Like I am, I have there is that I would do anything for

[55:42] my followers, for my fans, for my listeners. But what I won't do is sell out. Okay, I won't. Okay,

[55:51] Bill, you're not on my Patreon. I won't do that. All right. And I'm here to tell you right now

[55:57] that if I ever upset you, or you've got an issue with Canada, it just hit me up. But what I won't do

[56:04] is I won't let, you know, I won't let women into the boys room. I mean, that's the best metaphor I

[56:11] can give you. Either you're going to like, grow up a little bit and have a real conversation about it,

[56:16] but I'm not chasing people down no more. And I know this, and I mean this when I say this,

[56:20] the amount of content that drafts off of this content is kind of funny to me, right? It's just

[56:28] funny to me. And like, and I know that nobody can do this. I know that nobody without any notes,

[56:34] without any, you know, show topics, without any connections to manufacturers on a consistent

[56:41] basis can make content this entertaining or engaging or concise or relevant in pinball.

[56:46] And I know I should probably be doing this in another category, but I love it so much. And

[56:51] here's the thing too, that the ridiculous positioning of stuff is like, we're, we are pinball,

[56:57] we're going to talk about pinball happiness and play it. Whenever you see that, whenever you see

[57:01] people celebrate like positioning their content as positivity, who else did that? Colin, right? Colin

[57:08] did that. We're going to celebrate pinball the positive way. We're going to create a podcast

[57:14] that's about why you pinball happiness. Whenever you see people promote something like that,

[57:20] my only advice to you is run in the other direction because that's not interesting.

[57:28] That's not engaging. And that's not being real because the only reason why we love pinball,

[57:36] other than the games and the people is we love the conversation. And we love the fact that

[57:42] pinball triggers a response from us, both good and bad, positive and negative, right? Without those

[57:50] two forces, we don't have anything. It's not interesting. And that's why I'm committed to

[57:57] each and every one of you to never sell out, to never say, this is the place for pinball positivity.

[58:05] And that's why I kind of am an island in all of this. I am. And Albert and Jason and Kerry and

[58:15] there's people out there, you can see, you know who they are. They're kind of like misfits. We're

[58:20] all kind of like misfits. We don't fit into a group. We just don't. We don't work in mediators

[58:28] with a group of people. We're just kind of like, we would rather sell solo. And that's fine. As I've

[58:36] always said, like, you know, some people play singles, tennis, some people play doubles, some

[58:40] people like big groups, some people like flying solo. I just like being able to wake up, share how

[58:46] I feel about pinball. And that's it. And that's it, right? So that's my take on all that is I think

[58:54] everybody should listen to who they want to listen to. I think everybody should just tell us how you

[59:01] really feel about these things and these games. And I mean this when I say this, I'm not going to talk

[59:05] about this. I'm not tuning in to any new positivity pinball podcast. I'm just ignoring it. You will

[59:12] never hear me talk about it ever again. I give you my word right now, whatever this new happiness

[59:20] pinball entity is, you will never hear me talk about it again. And I'm not listening to a single

[59:26] episode. Okay, because I know that the origins of this stuff is fake. And I don't need to hang out

[59:33] with a bunch of fake shills. Because we got we got Bill Brand is here. We got Ed Robertson. We got

[59:39] we got Jack Danger in the Canadian club. You know, and come on, you don't think Stern pinball

[59:44] listens to Canadian club. Come on, hang it over that media tour like a dark cloud, like a dark

[59:50] cloud, like everyone knows, like everyone knows where the energy is at, everyone knows where the

[59:54] party's at. Ian brother. So Ian and nudge magazine guys love the guy. And you know what, Ian, I think

[01:00:02] maybe it's like an East Coast thing. Is it an East Coast thing? You know, I just think like in the

[01:00:07] East Coast, you know, who's like a cool dude. And I mean this when I say it is Vic, you know,

[01:00:10] over, you know, Vic, Vic's a guy that like, he hacked up his godfather topper, we've been,

[01:00:16] we've been jabbing each other, the Italian dude from Long Island, I called the guy up and we just,

[01:00:21] we had such a good conversation. And he's just a cool dude, you know, I you can't make if some of

[01:00:27] these, if some of these other cheerleaders, if you make fun of them the way I made fun of Vic,

[01:00:33] they would they would go crazy. They would go crazy. Okay. So look, it's going to be a very

[01:00:40] interesting June into July, I think June's going to be a dead month. In fact, I might take a week

[01:00:48] or two off in June, I'm not sure yet when I do the move, we move into the new house June 13.

[01:00:54] It's going to be a little tricky. So I might ask each and every one of you that's a club member,

[01:01:00] maybe can you please give Kimida a week off, a week off just to get everything together

[01:01:05] and not have this break in the day. And I'm trying to do these shows to be more like an hour

[01:01:10] so I don't know I don't think I'm going to do the full 90 minutes. And so I just want to say to

[01:01:15] everybody out there look, look, you know, I've been doing this for 10 years, these companies,

[01:01:20] I think, to say something positive, Elton John is the game of the year. It is the game of the year,

[01:01:26] it is the greatest, most overpriced game of all time. I love that I love the dichotomy of saying

[01:01:32] that is Jersey Jack created the world's greatest, the greatest pinball machine that is also the

[01:01:38] most overpriced pinball machine at the same time, right? At the same time. It's like, it's like the

[01:01:45] most beautiful wife who will make you go bankrupt, right? Is it worth it? Is it worth it? And look,

[01:01:51] hey, the pinball sex might be good enough that buying an Elton John might be worth it. And I love

[01:01:58] the Elton John owners club because it's nothing but good stuff. The John Wick owners club looks like,

[01:02:07] you know, it's rivaling, rival, rival, rival ring, I can't say that word,

[01:02:14] rivaling, rivaling the Thunderbirds owner club. I mean, you could literally put the Thunderbirds

[01:02:20] owner club next to the John Wick owner club and you'd be confused which one you're in. Is this,

[01:02:24] hey guys, is this it? Are we in the right place? Yeah, I think so. There's only like four pages,

[01:02:27] like, okay, yeah, we're in the right place. Yeah, nobody cares. Nobody cares.

[01:02:32] Carrie Hardy is a new club member as of today. I joined Carrie Hardy's Patreon.

[01:02:39] You know, like, I've made fun of Carrie Hardy more than anybody. I mean, I called Carrie Hardy the

[01:02:44] biggest haggis shill ever. I did a whole podcast just lambasting the dude when he unboxed Centaur.

[01:02:53] And I talked to Carrie Hardy today for an hour, grown man, picked up the phone, had a conversation,

[01:03:00] didn't, you know, he didn't run away. He didn't put on my enemy's t-shirts and cry like a B-I-T-C-H.

[01:03:09] He's a man. So thank you, Carrie, for being a man. It's a lost concept these days, you know? No, no.

[01:03:19] You know, in all the context of what I'm going through too, it's funny to me,

[01:03:23] you know, new baby, sleep deprived, one of the greatest moments of my life. And if you were my

[01:03:29] real friend, you wouldn't ignore me and abandon me when I need my friends the most. You know,

[01:03:35] I think one of the reasons why you guys love this podcast and just this show is we start to talk about

[01:03:40] more life things and other things that are more important. And that's the great part.

[01:03:48] And I think, you know, there's going to be times where we talk smack about each other.

[01:03:52] There's going to be times where we jab each other. I mean, I'm an identical twin. My twin brother

[01:03:57] makes fun of me more than you could ever imagine. Whatever you think you could do to insult me,

[01:04:02] pales in comparison to the daily, and I mean this, the daily barrage I get from my twin brother.

[01:04:10] I just bought a new house that cost, I knew I paid 50% more than my bro did for his house,

[01:04:18] but he bought at the right time. His swimming pool is the size of my backyard. Now, you don't think

[01:04:26] I know that when I closed on this house. I said it's a Brenda. I mean, I mean, I'm never going

[01:04:30] to hear the end of it. My brother's swimming pool is bigger than my backyard. And every day,

[01:04:37] he sends text messages reminding me of that. And I could do two things. I could be upset

[01:04:45] or I could just laugh at it because he's not wrong. He's not wrong. And, you know, the reason why

[01:04:51] it doesn't bother me is because I'm so happy with the woman I married. I'm so happy with my

[01:04:58] pinball podcast. I'm so happy with my pinball friends. I'm happy with my job. I get to do what I

[01:05:05] love every day. I get 12 weeks paternity leave. I get paid handsomely to play in the sandbox.

[01:05:13] Would I like to make what Bill Brandis makes today? Absolutely. Do I know how to make what Bill

[01:05:19] Brandis makes every day? No. And that's why I don't. And I'm not begrudging of anybody who makes a

[01:05:26] lot of money. I want rich friends more than poor friends. I've got to be honest. And I want my

[01:05:32] children to row their own boats. I will help them the way my father helped me. I'll leg up on their

[01:05:39] living when they get out of college and in education. And other than that, you're on your own.

[01:05:46] That's how it is. That's how it should be. The only time I've had to ask my father for help

[01:05:55] was with this house. And I'll explain it real quick because I don't know if you guys know this,

[01:06:01] but when you close on a house on a Friday, on a Friday, we sent in an offer and we needed 10%

[01:06:11] of the value of the home Monday at noon, liquid cash. Okay. So I've got my pin money set aside,

[01:06:22] but not that much. And so I called my financial advisor and she said, hey, look, Chris, we've

[01:06:28] got the money. That's not the problem is we have to sell some shares in your portfolio.

[01:06:33] And that will take three days for the money to clear. And we need the money Monday at noon.

[01:06:42] And so this 47 year old pinball podcaster, executive creative director of the world's

[01:06:50] second, maybe third largest now communications agency called up his father and said, hey, dad,

[01:06:57] do you have this much money in cash and could you loan it to us? And I will pay you back on Wednesday.

[01:07:05] And he said, yes. And then I said, how much more do you got? You know, I was like, just thankful.

[01:07:13] And Brenda and I have been in this place lately, as we sort of welcome in this new baby, the level

[01:07:19] of thankfulness that we've felt from not just our family, but from the pinball family, from

[01:07:26] all of you out there who sent in gifts, Hector, your gift, Bill Brandis, your gift.

[01:07:32] We got barrels of fun sent Cassie in a swaddle with his name on it. Like the amount of love and

[01:07:39] thankfulness we have is and trust me when I say this, I will always reciprocate that love. Now,

[01:07:46] if you're barrels of fun, I'm not going to say I like labyrinth as a theme, but I will always

[01:07:53] reciprocate the love you give in different ways. But I won't show your games. I mean,

[01:07:58] just, you know what I'm saying? I will always be respectful to David Van Asse and Blake and the

[01:08:03] team over there. But you can't buy my, you can't buy my positive reviews with a swaddle,

[01:08:10] but you can earn my respect as a man. And that is how I've felt over the last few weeks.

[01:08:18] And look, we're all going to go through tough times and hardship and we do need each other.

[01:08:24] We do need each other. And that's why it's so disappointing for me to have to sort of ex-communicate

[01:08:30] dudes like Jengiz from this community. But I don't need people like that here. I don't need people

[01:08:35] like that, that are going to just abandon and run away. And not just that, run away to people that

[01:08:42] hate you and then all of a sudden be in love with them. Right? I mean, guys like Ian, you know,

[01:08:47] Ian, let, you know, Ian's looking for work right now. And Ian, you know, you're very talented

[01:08:53] and you're an amazing photographer. You know, if you ask me, a guy like Ian is creating better

[01:08:58] pinball content and the photography than anything going out by Stern or Jersey Jack. And I think,

[01:09:05] you know, spooky pinball, some of these pinball companies should really be thinking about

[01:09:10] hiring someone like an Ian or, you know, employing them even on the side as like a side gig

[01:09:16] to create content for them. Because in the end of the day, it's like too many of us

[01:09:21] are giving so many hours away to these companies for free. And then the moment you try to monetize

[01:09:28] anything, look how they came at me. I mean, do you guys remember how the entire pinball content

[01:09:34] space came at me when I turned on Patreon and turned off giving away my life for free?

[01:09:42] They insulted me. They abused me. They dragged my name through the mud. They called me every name

[01:09:49] in the book as a narcissistic, sociopathic nightmare, a toxic human being. I was called a

[01:09:55] cancer. I was called a terrorist. Just think about this for a minute. I was called a terrorist

[01:10:02] by Scott and Josh as those two over at Loser Kid Pinball Podcast. They called me a terrorist.

[01:10:08] Okay, I just think about that for a minute. They called me the same name as a group that flies

[01:10:16] airplanes into buildings and kills civilians. The same name as Hamas that will sneak across the

[01:10:23] border at five in the morning and put babies in microwaves. They associated me with that kind

[01:10:31] of group of people. And what did I do? What did I do? Did I go on and attack of them? No,

[01:10:38] I didn't even do anything to them. And they successfully destroyed the Pinball Award show

[01:10:45] and they successfully took away what I believe was the highlight of Texas Pinball Festival.

[01:10:52] And now they replaced it with nothing. And that's what woke culture is. It's easily offended people

[01:11:02] who want to destroy the things that make people happy and they want to control

[01:11:09] what you get to engage with. They want to control the narrative. They want to remove the things

[01:11:15] that they don't believe in. And they want to use hyperbolic language that overly dramatizes the

[01:11:22] issue. It's like, you know, woke guys like that are at the helm at Disney. It's why Disney's failing.

[01:11:28] Because for 50 years, nobody was offended by Lady and the Tramp. But then all of a sudden,

[01:11:33] you put up disclaimers that this movie is insensitive to certain ethnicities. And now,

[01:11:40] I'm seeing the negativity. You've made it negative. It was never negative before.

[01:11:48] And that's what they've done. Because you know what? Those guys don't listen to my podcast.

[01:11:53] They don't listen to a single one. They don't follow me here. They don't do anything other than

[01:12:01] promote in their way the companies and the manufacturers. And again, it's fine. It's fine.

[01:12:08] But when you call me a terrorist and you call me a cancer, you know, my aunt died of cancer.

[01:12:14] My two aunts died of cancer. And if you've ever lost anybody to cancer, let me tell you something.

[01:12:19] You guys want to talk about like real drama? And again, this is really off the cuff.

[01:12:23] If you've ever been in a hospice of someone who dies of cancer, that is the worst way to go

[01:12:28] imaginable. So when you say that Canada is the worst thing imaginable in pinball content and

[01:12:37] for the pinball hobby, you really should be ashamed of yourselves. And did any of those

[01:12:43] loser kid guys ever apologize to me for calling me a terrorist or a cancer? No. And I wanted to say

[01:12:52] this. If any of these men believe in God or Jesus or are religious, they're all hypocrites and

[01:12:59] they're all fakes because forgiveness and turning the other cheek and trying to make a positive outcome,

[01:13:08] you know, is really the way to go. And I'll tell you this right now. I'm going to forgive

[01:13:12] Jengiz for doing what he did, but only if he asked me for forgiveness, because I think that's

[01:13:19] how it needs to work in life. And the moment Jengiz asked for forgiveness and says, Hey,

[01:13:25] you know, maybe I overreacted and then he's welcome back here any day. But until that day,

[01:13:33] he's not because I'm tired of always being the one who asked to like bow down to other people.

[01:13:40] All right. So everybody look, I know this went a little bit off on a tangent. And I think that's

[01:13:46] one of the reasons why hopefully you enjoy this. We talk about pinball, we talk about life, we talk

[01:13:50] about the interpersonal relationships that happen in this hobby. And that's interesting to me,

[01:13:56] because all of us spend more time than we should in this hobby. And I want to get to know each and

[01:14:02] every one of you a little bit deeper than just the fact that you're not buying John Wick or that

[01:14:06] stern pinballs or ripoff or that Elton John's the greatest rip, greatest game you'll never buy

[01:14:12] because of the price. Like, you know, there's more to us. And if we don't get to that, we don't get

[01:14:17] too much. And for all the fake content creators out there, just keep it real guys, you know, we

[01:14:23] know you don't like a game, it's fine. You don't have to buy everything to earn our attention. You

[01:14:28] don't have to like, you don't have to cheerlead everything a manufacturer does. You're not shareholders

[01:14:33] in these companies. You should be serving your community and your fans. And it does your community

[01:14:39] a disservice. If all you're going to do is hype these companies because you get kickbacks or

[01:14:46] you're sponsored by a distro or your brother is an operator. And that's how you make money.

[01:14:51] Like then that's fine. But like, I can't take what you say seriously. Everybody have a great

[01:14:58] Saturday. This has been a very candid episode of Canada Saturday morning spectacular. To my

[01:15:04] subscribers, guys, thank you. You're going to get all of this in audio form in great quality over

[01:15:11] the next day or two. And I can't wait to close on my house. I'm very blessed to have each and every

[01:15:17] one of you along on this ride with me. I mean that and Albert welcome back to the party. I

[01:15:23] really do mean that I wish no ill will on anybody or anyone. I think life is too short. I think

[01:15:31] we're all going to die before we want to. And if there's one thing that keeps me up at night, it's

[01:15:36] that I'm going to die well before I get to see enough of my my little boy's life. And that that

[01:15:42] I mean, don't make me cry now. I mean, I'm glad I have sunglasses on now because that's the thing

[01:15:46] like if you ever want to see canada cry, have me do the math of how old I'll how old I'll be

[01:15:54] to see my sons be my age and it breaks me down every time. Real life guys, real life. So be good.

[01:16:02] Take care of yourselves. I just got back from the gym. You don't you don't even want to see

[01:16:05] I don't even want to show you canada's dad bod because it's it's it's I'm getting Bruce Lee

[01:16:10] ripped. I'm trying to be as ripped as Bill Brandis and I'll get there Billy. I'll get there. You

[01:16:16] know, I'm going to get there brother one day. Everybody love you. Be good. This was a great

[01:16:21] show. John Ehrlich, my love to the family over there at Jack bar. You know, at the end, let me

[01:16:27] end this show by saying this. John was there when I threw a drink in Tim Sexton's face. I think I

[01:16:34] elbowed John as they I was wearing a Cobra Kai t-shirt, which I think added to my toxic masculine

[01:16:41] moment. And there I was Joe, fresh vodka soda, the whole thing in Tim Sexton's face because I had

[01:16:47] just ordered it. And I and all of a sudden like, and you know, and like, I mean, I know I could

[01:16:52] probably hold my own with some of these dudes solo, but there was like eight dudes on me and I'm

[01:16:56] I just threw back my arms. And I think I hit John and I was like wrestled into the elevator.

[01:17:02] Like it was like Cobra Kai. It was like Ralph Macchio in the shower at karate kid, right? And

[01:17:09] the whole thing was handled poorly by everybody, but mostly by me, right? I was drunk. I mean,

[01:17:14] don't get don't get me wrong. The reason I was drunk and it's no excuse for this behavior is I was at

[01:17:21] dinner with Lyman sheets and Lyman can drink. So we got wasted. And then I rolled in there rooting

[01:17:29] for Lyman's girlfriend Penny. And that's what sparked the whole thing is that the woman that

[01:17:35] Penny was playing against was complaining that I was cheering too loud for Lyman's girlfriend.

[01:17:42] You want to know this is how this all went down. And I didn't realize that there was a blue piece

[01:17:47] of tape on the ground that meant you couldn't cross the line. And there's canada wasted. And Tim

[01:17:54] sexton instead of like calming the situation down, he gets up on a chair and screams canada

[01:18:01] is being kicked out of this tournament security escort him from the building. And then crazy

[01:18:08] levy and I are like, I'm like really levy. Come on, man, like this is ridiculous. I'm just here to

[01:18:12] cheer on penny. I didn't realize those rules about cheering and pimple. And I just see this like

[01:18:18] Tim sexton like with this smug look on his face. And there I am, toxically drunk masculine canada

[01:18:26] wearing a Cobra Kai t-shirt, which takes your toxic masculine a whole personality through the roof.

[01:18:32] And I'm staring at this like $15 drink I just bought. And on the wall on the walk path, boom,

[01:18:38] that was it, boom, like, you know, it was wrong. And it was assault on every level. And I shouldn't

[01:18:44] have done it. And then I got wrestled into the damn elevator. Yeah, there was some footage.

[01:18:50] And like that was it. Like, and then John wrote this scathing a hard like it was like a hard knocks

[01:18:59] heartfelt message to canada on pin side of what an absolute a hole you are for your behavior at the

[01:19:09] show. And John Ehrlich was 100% right, 100% right. And the same John Ehrlich, after we went through

[01:19:21] that, and he saw the worst of me, because this is the thing he saw the worst of me, he saw the

[01:19:27] worst behavior imaginable. And instead of canceling me and saying that's all he ever is, that's all

[01:19:34] you ever will be. That's what loser kid would do to me. That's what Don's pinball podcast would do

[01:19:40] to me. That's what jeng is would do to me. They will take one moment, and they will simply live in

[01:19:47] it forever. They're stuck in that moment of who I am. And instead of doing that, John Ehrlich,

[01:19:53] who saw me at the worst, you know what he did? He got to know me. He got to see that there was more

[01:20:01] than just that. And he forgave me. And we became really good friends. And he used my podcast to

[01:20:09] propose to his wife. And you talk about two ends of the spectrum of what the journey of life could

[01:20:16] become if you actually forgive people and try to see all of them. And I mean that. And for everyone

[01:20:24] who hates me, the reason why they hate me is they don't want to see any of the good. They don't want

[01:20:29] to see any of the good. They don't listen to the show. They don't hang out here. All they want to

[01:20:34] see is what they want to see. And if that's what they want to see, you best damn believe it. I'll

[01:20:39] give it to you. If you want to see a narcissist, you want to see a sociopath, you want to see a

[01:20:44] self-absorbed materialistic loser, I'll give you that. But for those of you who want to see more,

[01:20:51] I'll give you that. And as I've always said, everybody, every terrible thing they say about me,

[01:20:58] but so much more. And so everybody have a great Saturday. This was one of the greatest Saturday

[01:21:04] morning spectaculars I've ever done. And if you feel that way, kick some stars so I can give 40%

[01:21:10] of them to Apple. You know, Jason, Apple's like, dude, you got to do this on a laptop. If you do

[01:21:15] it on a laptop, you don't have to pay Apple all that money. I gave you a 90 minute show,

[01:21:21] hidden hard in the right ways. And gang, this is the best. This is where everybody should be.

[01:21:26] And for the 1500 people or 1800 people, almost 2000 people are going to watch this at some point

[01:21:33] this week. If you're not a member of the Canada club, what are you doing? All right, you need to

[01:21:42] be like Steve Ballmer. I've got four words for you. I love this podcast. All right, that's it. I

[01:21:54] love this podcast. It is the best pinball podcast. It's not even, we have 714 subscribers.

[01:22:01] It's more than every other pinball podcast combined. It doesn't matter if you like me or hate me.

[01:22:08] Just the curious newbie would be like, oh, yeah, maybe I should try it for five bucks.

[01:22:13] Right? I mean, Bill Brandis spends more money on uni in a day than a lifetime of my podcast would

[01:22:20] cost him. Everybody love you. Life is crazy. We're all broken. We're all broken. But you know who's

[01:22:28] not going to fix us? David Fix later. That was good, right? Later.
