[00:00] Happy Monday, ladies and gentlemen!

[00:15] What a year we've had, right?

[00:16] The COVID pandemic that nobody saw coming, guns and roses, Pimball Machine, the greatest

[00:23] music integrated Pimball Machine of all time, Rick and Morty buy spooky Pimball clearly,

[00:28] their finest Pimball Machine to date on a theme that everyone slept on, Rick and Morty

[00:33] sold out in 4 hours.

[00:35] What else happened this year?

[00:36] We got Keith Owens Avengers, which is probably one of the best shooting Stern Pimball

[00:41] Machines of all time.

[00:43] People are loving that game.

[00:44] We've got Playfield issues that just won't go away.

[00:49] We've got Pimball shows that think they're going to take place in March.

[00:52] People are burying their heads in the sand as the COVID cases are now over 100,000 new

[00:59] cases a day.

[01:01] It's been one hell of a year, hasn't it?

[01:03] The reason I'm sort of being reflective right now is I just asked my HR director, how

[01:09] many vacation days or PTO days do I have left in the year?

[01:13] And I want to tell you right now, I have like three and a half weeks of PTO I need to take

[01:18] before the year ends.

[01:19] And I didn't even realize it's mid-November.

[01:23] How fast the months are going, the days are going of our lives right now.

[01:28] And I'm looking at it like that means I'm going to be like basically off the entire month

[01:32] of December if I do it right.

[01:34] I can carry over five days, but you know what I mean.

[01:38] It's been one hell of a year.

[01:40] It really has.

[01:41] And I'll say this, being in a hobby like Pimball has helped many of us get through this year.

[01:47] I mean, all of us were kind of smart if you think about it.

[01:50] We invested in things that actually we needed in 2020.

[01:55] A home entertainment device like a Pimball machine was actually one of the greatest things

[02:01] to have in your house or apartment because Pimball gives you fun at home.

[02:06] You don't have to travel out for it if you have one inside your house.

[02:10] Now all this in mind, the reason why I'm being reflective is I want to tell you right

[02:14] now on episode 531 of Canages Pimball podcast that I myself, I need a break again.

[02:21] I need to take a couple weeks off from Pimball podcasting for a few reasons.

[02:26] One, and I'm just going to call it right now.

[02:28] The Pimball season is over.

[02:30] Someone said this to me today.

[02:31] They're like the Pimball season is over.

[02:34] Everything we're going to see that's major that happens in the Pimball world has already

[02:38] happened.

[02:39] I don't think we're going to see another major thing happen in the Pimball world in 2020.

[02:45] So I don't think we're going to see Led Zeppelin in 2020.

[02:48] We might get Cactus Canyon remake, but is that a major moment?

[02:52] We already know what the game is.

[02:53] So there's not a lot of surprises to come from Cactus Canyon.

[02:57] Of course the code will be updated.

[02:59] The scopes will be beautiful.

[03:01] The artwork will be nicer.

[03:02] The top will be incredible.

[03:04] But for the most part, I just need a break because I feel like the Pimball season is over.

[03:11] I do.

[03:12] And I know that we're all trying to find new stuff to talk about on a weekly basis, but let's

[03:17] face it.

[03:18] For all of my other Pimball podcasters out there, there's not really much new stuff to talk

[03:23] about.

[03:24] And in these periods when there's not a lot of new stuff to talk about, often what happens

[03:29] is a lot of drama starts to develop in this and that.

[03:32] But I'm happy to report that I haven't seen too much Pimball drama happening amongst

[03:37] the content creators in a while.

[03:38] So that's a good thing.

[03:39] I think everyone's been a lot more respectful towards each other.

[03:43] And I really hope that trend continues as we go into 2021.

[03:47] And the other reason why the Pimball season's over is now it's basically like people are

[03:51] just waiting to get their machines.

[03:53] There's a lot of waiting going on to get your stern machines.

[03:56] If you've ordered a stern machine in Avengers Premium, a Jurassic Park, you go down a list

[04:01] of stern titles.

[04:02] People are still waiting on, they're still waiting on Ninja Turtles.

[04:05] They're waiting on a lot of games to be made.

[04:08] So I think there's going to be not a lot of like interesting new unboxings going on.

[04:13] It's going to be more about people finally getting the titles that they ordered a long

[04:17] time ago.

[04:18] You know, look how slow guns and roses is trickling out.

[04:21] I actually thought they would have more games on the line a week than they currently do.

[04:26] I'm not seeing many unboxings of these games.

[04:30] Now it doesn't make the game any worse.

[04:32] It doesn't make the game any less special.

[04:34] I would just like to see more people enjoy what I think is the greatest masterpiece of Pimball

[04:41] in 2020.

[04:42] And I do think that G&R is going to sweep a lot of the categories at the Twippies.

[04:47] I really do.

[04:48] It is one of those games.

[04:49] You really have to play it to really appreciate what they did with the game.

[04:53] And I just don't think it's a game.

[04:55] You can look at a stream of it and understand why people are saying it's so mad.

[05:00] It's magical and so incredible and such an experience unlike any other Pimball machine.

[05:05] So I think you're going to realize the hype is real, but you're going to have to play it

[05:09] in the right situation.

[05:10] And by that, I mean, you're going to have to have a few drinks.

[05:13] You're going to have to be in a dark environment.

[05:15] And you're going to have to have the mindset that you're about to go into a Guns and Roses

[05:19] concert.

[05:20] I remember seeing people playing this machine outside at Coin Takeer, outside in the sunlight.

[05:26] It is like the last place you'd want to put a Guns and Roses Pimball machine to truly

[05:31] experience the light show and the energy of a G&R concert in a box.

[05:36] Now, when it comes to Pimball news, there's not tons of news happening right now, but I

[05:40] did see some news with Dutch Pimball that is a good sign for people out there.

[05:45] So they are moving into a larger facility in which they want to make 10 games a week.

[05:51] Okay.

[05:52] Now, guess who else is making 10 games a week spooky Pimball?

[05:54] So that means it would take Dutch Pimball roughly a year and a half, 18 months to make

[06:00] 750 big Lebowski's.

[06:03] But I think they're only making 500.

[06:05] And right now, the plan is for every three to four games they make, that one of those

[06:10] will go to an EA.

[06:11] And I will say this, if Dutch Pimball can get every EA made hole, can make all of these

[06:18] games and accomplish what I never thought they could, which was pull the rabbit out of

[06:22] the hat and actually figure out a way to rob Peter to pay Paul with this business model

[06:28] of theirs.

[06:29] But if they can figure it out and they can make it work, that is a good thing for Pimball

[06:33] because I've always said this Dutch Pimball and Barry over at Dutch.

[06:38] I do believe Barry is one of the greatest Pimball designers that has been so underutilized

[06:44] because he got trapped in his own nightmare company.

[06:47] He did.

[06:48] I mean, look at Big Lebowski.

[06:50] Still, to this day holds up as probably the best theme integrated game we've seen in

[06:56] the last 10 to 15 years, especially on the playfield side of things.

[07:01] That game has more creativity and brings the big Lebowski to life more than GNR does

[07:07] GNR on the playfield.

[07:08] It's got toys, it's got an upper playfield and a lower playfield.

[07:12] It's got so much in it, it's got to rug that rolls out.

[07:15] I mean, that is what all of us want.

[07:18] We want games to come to life in Pimball form just like the Big Lebowski.

[07:22] Now here's the best news of the day.

[07:25] The coder of the Big Lebowski is rejoining Dutch Pimball to finish the game.

[07:32] This game is only at like 0.52, so if they put a lot more into this game code wise and

[07:38] they really, really make this game deep as well as approachable, which right now it's

[07:44] very approachable, but the game does get stale pretty quickly and that's why we've

[07:48] seen so many people who have received Big Lebowski pass it on.

[07:53] It's really because the code just is too shallow.

[07:55] After a few weeks with the game, there's nothing else to really do or explore in the machine.

[08:01] So they can really get this code deeper and give people more.

[08:04] I think the Big Lebowski is going to go down as one of the greatest Pimball machines of

[08:09] all time.

[08:10] I really do.

[08:11] The coder would make me consider going get one because they are not going to make thousands

[08:15] of these games and that game to me still holds up against any machine I've seen since

[08:22] I've been following Pimball and I think you put it against any machine over the last

[08:25] 10 to 15 years and the Big Lebowski holds up against any of them if the code gets to

[08:31] where it needs to be.

[08:33] So that's good news because the other thing I would love to see I would love to see

[08:37] Barry and Dutch Pimball do another title.

[08:39] No, I don't want another bride of Pimball.

[08:42] I don't think they should do any of those kids anymore, but I would love to see them do

[08:46] another title.

[08:47] You know what I would love to see them do.

[08:48] I'm just going to throw it out there as a suggestion for them if they're listening.

[08:51] I would love to see Barry connect with the Pimball brothers and reimagine alien Pimball

[08:58] in standard body format and bring alien Pimball back into the world and make it magical.

[09:06] The code is there.

[09:07] The code is there.

[09:08] What they've done with the game software wise is phenomenal, but the actual game itself,

[09:14] the highway Pimball version of the game was riddled with problems, riddled with engineering

[09:18] issues and they could have put more special stuff in the game.

[09:22] I always look at alien and I'm like when you look at it, there's still not enough toys

[09:25] in that game like there should have been.

[09:27] There's not.

[09:28] And the toys that are in it don't really work very well.

[09:31] So I would love Barry and the Pimball brothers to sync up and figure out a way to make

[09:37] alien Pimball the sophomore title of Dutch Pimball and do it right and do it justice.

[09:44] Where are the Pimball brothers?

[09:45] I mean, these guys, it's real.

[09:47] They actually made a standard body version of the game and they shopped it around to

[09:52] the different manufacturers and that's the last I've heard about it.

[09:55] But somewhere out there in this world, there's a standard body Pimball brothers version

[10:00] of alien Pimball and I hope we get that theme back because the more I look at Pimball

[10:05] and the more I look at where this industry is going, I really think that all these companies

[10:11] need to realize that we need more themes like alien.

[10:15] We need more themes like guns and roses.

[10:18] We need more themes like the matrix.

[10:20] We need more themes like fifth element, more themes like total recall, more themes like

[10:25] Rambo.

[10:26] We need more themes that are built around what the Pimball buying community wants.

[10:31] We love movies from the 80s and 90s.

[10:34] We love action movies.

[10:36] We love sci-fi movies.

[10:37] We love movies with energy.

[10:39] We love movies that have iconic scenes, iconic actors and iconic call outs.

[10:45] Right?

[10:46] Jurassic Park is an incredible movie to make a Pimball machine around.

[10:49] That's why we've had so many Jurassic Park Pimball machines.

[10:52] But we don't need too many more kitty themes.

[10:55] We don't.

[10:56] I don't need Pac-Man.

[10:58] I really hope Jurassic Jack Pimball is not considering Pac-Man.

[11:01] We don't want the Muppets.

[11:03] I don't.

[11:04] I don't want a Muppets Pimball.

[11:05] I'm sorry.

[11:06] I just not what people want.

[11:08] Let's face it.

[11:09] There's a reason why guns and roses sold so quickly.

[11:12] There's a reason why.

[11:13] It's not just because of what Eric did.

[11:14] It's because it's cool.

[11:15] It's grown man find that theme really cool and it works really well.

[11:19] I think you're going to see Led Zeppelin sales be okay, not as good as guns and roses.

[11:23] The music's not as high energy as GNR.

[11:25] But there are so many themes we're missing.

[11:27] There's so many.

[11:28] There's so many Saturday morning 80s cartoon themes that would be so amazing for Pimball.

[11:32] Where's he man masters of the universe in all this?

[11:35] Where's G1 Transformers in all of this?

[11:38] How do we not have a G1 Transformers Pimball machine by now?

[11:42] Where's Tron 1981?

[11:44] That's the one people want.

[11:45] Where's that?

[11:46] Don't need is more obscure themes that only appeal to the old Commudjans of Pimball.

[11:52] I really can't wait to the old Commudjans of Pimball step down from their positions.

[11:58] We never need it the monsters.

[12:00] This isn't what people want.

[12:01] It's not what people want.

[12:02] It's too niche.

[12:03] It's too old.

[12:05] We need more relevant themes.

[12:06] But we got to nail the relevant themes.

[12:08] We were all so excited when Stranger Things came out, right?

[12:12] How awesome is that show?

[12:13] Then the Pimball machine just failed to capture the excitement around that show.

[12:18] It failed to capture the vibe and the campiness of that 1980s world that we love so much.

[12:23] It just failed to do it.

[12:24] And so for that reason, you know, it just didn't click.

[12:26] Now I will say, I believe this one of the most untapped areas for Pimball.

[12:31] And you could fight me on this all day long.

[12:33] But you can't tell me that nobody can figure out a way to take some of the biggest Broadway

[12:37] shows of all time and make a Pimball machine out of it.

[12:40] I mean this when I say it.

[12:41] And why isn't there a Pimball machine for Phantom of the Opera?

[12:44] I mean the musical Phantom.

[12:46] Why isn't there a Pimball machine for Hamilton after all this popularity?

[12:50] Why doesn't someone go to him and tell him, hey, Lin Manuel, look at Pimball.

[12:54] Let's make a Pimball version of Hamilton and get to the creator.

[12:58] He's a cool dude.

[12:59] You could get to him.

[13:00] You could explain to him how it needs to work.

[13:02] You could show him like look at G and R. Look at this.

[13:04] Let's make your iconic Broadway show into the greatest Pimball experience.

[13:09] And I'm just saying look, maybe that's not the best one.

[13:11] You know what I mean?

[13:12] Why aren't we looking at this stuff?

[13:14] So that's the key to me.

[13:15] It's like this balancing between what is contemporary now that would really translate well into

[13:21] Pimball and what nostalgia things can we reimagine as Pimball machines that we've always wanted.

[13:27] That never got the Pimball treatment back in the day.

[13:30] But the good news is this Pimball is booming.

[13:32] Pimball sales are through the roof.

[13:35] People are waking up to the Pimball love every day.

[13:38] There's hundreds of new people that are probably discovering Pimball.

[13:41] You know, maybe they're discovering content on YouTube.

[13:44] Maybe they're listening to podcasts.

[13:45] Maybe they stumbled upon Pinsite.

[13:47] Maybe they're friend as a Pimball machine that they saw them post on social media.

[13:51] But it's growing.

[13:52] And people's appreciation for Pimball is growing every week, every month, every year.

[13:58] Stern sales are going up every year.

[14:00] They're not going south.

[14:01] And this is a really good thing because as more people come into Pimball, you have larger

[14:06] audiences with larger interest and a variety of interests.

[14:11] And then your buyer base becomes even bigger.

[14:14] So if you bring out the right theme at the right time for the right audience, your sales

[14:19] are going to be in the thousands and thousands and thousands.

[14:23] But the flip side is true.

[14:24] If you come out with themes that people don't really want, your failures will be magnified

[14:28] by that much, right?

[14:30] Think about it.

[14:31] Like how come thousands of people are buying these machines and then you come out with

[14:34] the theme like October Fest and you can't even sell 300.

[14:37] So that's the reality of Pimball.

[14:39] Now you either give people something special that they want or there's no point in even

[14:44] making it.

[14:45] There really isn't.

[14:46] You can't come out in 2020 with Calds and expect to sell 200 of them.

[14:51] And I saw that Haggis announced that they've sold 25 and that's great.

[14:54] I always knew they were going to sell some of them, especially locally.

[14:58] But then the question is, can they afford to just make 25 or 50 after all the work that

[15:03] went into Calds?

[15:04] Do they need to make 200 to break even or make a profit?

[15:08] But they're not going to sell 200.

[15:09] They know that.

[15:10] You know that.

[15:11] But no one will tell them that.

[15:12] Knaiida will say it.

[15:13] But again, I've talked to Damian.

[15:15] He's a really nice guy.

[15:17] But marketing 101.

[15:18] Nobody wants that kind of theme.

[15:20] The artwork's not up to par with where the par is now with artwork.

[15:24] Like the bar has been raised on artwork.

[15:26] And I saw the news today that Ben Heck is looking for an artist to hand draw artwork for

[15:31] his Pimball machine.

[15:32] Well, I don't know why Ben put that on Twitter.

[15:34] Ben, there are so many talented artists out there that you can get for your Pimball machine.

[15:38] And now look, we all know that majority of Pimball art now is hand drawn, which is good.

[15:43] I would love to see more artists come into the Pimball space.

[15:47] I don't think you can have the same artists do games over and over and over again.

[15:52] And it's nothing against Franchie or Zambietti.

[15:55] But it gets stale seeing the same art style over and over and over again.

[16:00] And it also diminishes it being special when it's the same artist work on every machine

[16:06] or every other machine.

[16:08] And I really think they need to start looking at different artists, different art styles.

[16:13] And looking at these games and saying, hey, like this is a blank canvas.

[16:17] It's a blank canvas.

[16:18] And for the most part, most Pimball artwork, it's sort of a stayed within the same sort

[16:22] of realm.

[16:23] But man, walk through a museum.

[16:25] Walk through a museum and see all the different types of artists.

[16:28] There are so many different art styles that Pimball has not even scratched the surface

[16:33] on exploring.

[16:34] And again, it's because it's the old, cramajin way of doing Pimball.

[16:38] I just think there's too many people out there that have a very myopic view of what a Pimball

[16:43] machine can be.

[16:44] And I think if this Pimball podcast stands for anything, it's that the creative opportunity

[16:49] for Pimball is limitless.

[16:51] It's boundless.

[16:52] It really is.

[16:53] I get that you have to put stuff within a certain, you know, you know, you have to put

[16:57] stuff within a certain, you know, square footage of the game itself.

[17:00] But ultimately, the creativity that you can apply to Pimball is much greater than most

[17:07] of the games we get today.

[17:08] And you know that.

[17:10] You know that.

[17:11] You know they can put more mechs in these games, more toys, more interesting things.

[17:15] You're going to tell me that a doctor who mech, which is so freaking cool.

[17:19] We can't pull stuff like that off today.

[17:22] Why can't we?

[17:23] And these games are costing three times, four times as much money as doctor who.

[17:28] And yet you go back and you look at all these games from the 90s and the engineering

[17:32] and the mechanical creativity in those games.

[17:36] Why can't we create more of that today?

[17:38] And we're starting to get there.

[17:39] We're starting to get there.

[17:40] But we're not there yet.

[17:41] The number one Pimball company on the world is not putting stuff in their game that's

[17:46] blowing you away.

[17:47] And you know that.

[17:48] And you know that.

[17:49] And they know that.

[17:50] The only thing that's blowing us away is how expensive these games are becoming, how

[17:54] expensive the accessories are becoming.

[17:56] I mean, it's getting to the point now.

[17:58] If you accessorize a stern machine, you are close to $11 to $12,000 if you buy all of

[18:04] the accessories for these machines.

[18:06] And it's quickly going to get there.

[18:08] And way to they flip the switch on internet way to they flip the switch and get everyone

[18:12] to pay a monthly fee to have internet leaderboards.

[18:15] It's common.

[18:16] They're doing it so wisely.

[18:19] They're getting a huge, huge owner base of these games.

[18:23] And then all of a sudden, that's where their next big revenue stream lies.

[18:27] It's an internet connectivity and monthly subscription fees for the stern network.

[18:32] And it's smart.

[18:33] I would do the same thing if I were them.

[18:35] The amount of money they are leaving on the table.

[18:37] Not just that.

[18:38] The other part that I'm like stern just needs to figure out merchandise.

[18:41] I mean, the amount of merchandise around these themes.

[18:44] But I want to wear merchandise based on the games I love.

[18:47] All right.

[18:48] That's where I feel.

[18:49] I feel like the pinball season is over.

[18:51] I feel like there is a ton of pinball content.

[18:54] So when KnaiDa takes a few weeks off, don't worry.

[18:57] There are so many more shows you can listen to.

[19:00] There's so much.

[19:01] And that's the other part too about pinball podcasting as I go into 2021.

[19:05] I will be honest.

[19:06] It's not as much fun anymore because there's just so much content.

[19:10] There's just so many shows now.

[19:12] We're all talking about the same thing on some level.

[19:15] You wake up and you're like, am I really just going to add another point of view on the

[19:20] same stuff?

[19:21] Like 20, 30 people are talking about every single week.

[19:25] Right.

[19:26] I always say this.

[19:27] In a good year, we get like five to seven new pinball machines in a good year.

[19:30] That means there's only five to seven days in which there's real pinball news to discuss.

[19:35] Five to seven days.

[19:37] And yet here, all of us are filling so many days with pinball content.

[19:41] It does.

[19:42] And I'll be the first to admit it.

[19:44] I think most of the times really just like there's not much to discuss.

[19:49] Like, I bet everyone who does a weekly show on some level just gets burnt out and feels

[19:55] like, well, we just have to keep making the content.

[19:58] So I'm here to take two weeks off.

[20:00] I do think all the pinball podcasters should take breaks.

[20:02] I do.

[20:03] I think it's only healthy for everyone to take some time off.

[20:06] Decompress.

[20:07] Don't even look at pinside for a few weeks.

[20:10] Don't even follow the hobby for a few weeks.

[20:12] Just enjoy your pinball machines.

[20:14] Enjoy talking to your friends about pinball and then come back refreshed.

[20:17] It's just something you're going to need to do before you burn out because we all burn

[20:21] out.

[20:22] Now, when am I going to come back on the air wave?

[20:24] So I was looking at the calendar.

[20:25] I want to take a couple weeks off.

[20:26] So it probably come back November 30th, the Monday after Thanksgiving was at Cyber Monday.

[20:32] So I'll probably come back then.

[20:34] So this will be my last show for a couple weeks, everyone.

[20:36] So I'm going to take a two week break.

[20:38] Okay.

[20:39] So if you are donating to my Patreon page, please don't cancel your donation because I took

[20:44] a two week break.

[20:45] For those of you out there who don't donate to Canadian pinball podcas, I mean, we're getting

[20:48] to a good point now where we have a lot of people contributing.

[20:52] It's Canadian pinball over at Patreon would appreciate any donations.

[20:56] So yeah, unless something major happens in the world of pinball, I expect to take the

[21:00] two weeks off and just recharge and relax.

[21:03] I think I've earned it after 531 episodes of Canadian pinball podcasts.

[21:08] I know people want me to turn those old episodes back on.

[21:12] I'm thinking about it.

[21:13] I am thinking about it.

[21:14] And here's what I want everyone to do.

[21:16] I want everyone out there.

[21:17] If you get new machines, new GNR machines, new Avengers machines, please upload what the

[21:23] quality of those machines is.

[21:25] Please if your quality is great, please share it.

[21:27] If you're having pooling and play field issues, please share that as well.

[21:31] I want as many people as possible to share with the community what their experience is

[21:36] like because we have to help each other out.

[21:40] These games are too expensive now and we wait a long time to get them.

[21:44] And here's the other part we never talk about.

[21:46] The amount of hard work all of us do to be able to afford these pinball machines.

[21:52] The amount of hours we have to put into our careers to cut a check for 12, 5 or 9,500.

[21:58] It's a lot of work and we deserve high quality products.

[22:02] Now, the more we can share what our experiences are with these games, the more we can hold

[22:07] these manufacturers accountable.

[22:09] And I really think we can't forget that point.

[22:12] We need to hold these manufacturers accountable for the stuff they're putting out there.

[22:16] And unless you share your experience good and bad, we won't be able to know what really

[22:22] is going on.

[22:23] Okay.

[22:24] And the last thing I want people to think about in this two week break that I'm taking

[22:27] is put your health and your safety first.

[22:30] There are now 100,000 plus cases of COVID daily in America.

[22:36] 100,000 11 million people in America have caught COVID.

[22:42] 11 million.

[22:43] Okay.

[22:44] We lead the world by far and that's statistic.

[22:46] All right.

[22:47] Now, here's the other thing.

[22:48] If you think pinball shows are going to be happening in March of 2021, I think everyone

[22:53] needs to stop burying their head in the sand around this issue.

[22:57] It is not safe to go to shows in March.

[23:00] The way things are going right now and how is anything going to be different?

[23:04] How is anything going to be different?

[23:06] Come March.

[23:07] Do you think there's going to be widespread availability of some vaccine?

[23:11] It's not happening by March.

[23:13] So I think that the people who are hosting these shows now have a responsibility to put people's

[23:18] health and safety first.

[23:21] And I just don't think these shows are going to happen.

[23:23] And I think the sooner we accept that, the better.

[23:26] I know you want to see your pinball fans and friends.

[23:29] I want to see my pinball fans and friends.

[23:31] I want to hang out at these shows just as bad as you do.

[23:34] But let's be honest here.

[23:36] It's not going to happen.

[23:37] And if it does happen, I think it's irresponsible to hold these shows knowing what we know about

[23:42] this virus, knowing what we know about how people can contract it.

[23:46] It is so irresponsible to have a large pinball gathering.

[23:50] When this thing is still out there, it's still real.

[23:53] And it's not going away by March of 2021.

[23:56] This thing does not cooperate with our social lives.

[24:00] It doesn't cooperate with what we'd like.

[24:02] And it doesn't care how fatigued we are.

[24:04] Because that's the thing.

[24:05] It's all about the fact that as human beings, we are all fatigued by this thing.

[24:11] And it gets worse and worse.

[24:12] And it's going to be a bad holidays for many of us as we miss Thanksgiving.

[24:17] We miss Christmas gatherings.

[24:19] We're going to miss a lot of holiday moments that we cherish.

[24:23] And it's going to suck for all of us.

[24:24] But you know what?

[24:25] It's going to suck even worse if you have to say goodbye to people you love because of

[24:29] this thing.

[24:30] And we're all going to party like it's a print song when we finally have widespread

[24:35] vaccination.

[24:36] And we can get back together to doing the things we love.

[24:39] But we're not there yet.

[24:40] We're not quite there yet.

[24:41] I would say it's not going to be until TPS 2022 in which it's really going to be safe

[24:46] for all of us to get together and enjoy pinball.

[24:48] All right.

[24:49] So just think about that over the next couple of weeks.

[24:51] This has been episode 531 of Canadian pinball podcast.

[24:55] Stay safe.

[24:56] Everybody will talk to you soon.
