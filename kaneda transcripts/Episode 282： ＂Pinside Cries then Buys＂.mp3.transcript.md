[00:00] And at a Qing down, watch it you brain home, you see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gonna come to Qing come

[00:06] Middle America packed in, green to see me on my black skin, number one question they ask him

[00:12] Who can be question you will experience?

[00:21] Welcome to episode 282 of Canada's Pinball podcast, I'm your host canada

[00:27] You know I feel like that's George Gomez sitting in his office watching the Beatles pinball sales roll in and he's like

[00:34] Fuck every question you're asking you know look I want to clarify

[00:39] My stance on the Beatles because I don't have a problem with stern making the Beatles

[00:43] I don't I really don't I don't I think the pinball world has needed a very simple game for a long time that people can

[00:49] Walk up to and play and I think the Beatles does that and I think if you think the Beatles aren't popular

[00:55] I think you need to have your head checked now the issue I've always had with this Beatles pinball machine is

[01:01] Are you getting your money's worth and that is the way I've been looking at the Beatles game?

[01:06] And I think you could argue that for eight thousand dollars

[01:10] It's questionable right? I mean we know the license was expensive to acquire and this is why there hasn't been a Beatles machine in a really really long time

[01:18] But we're gonna find out on this episode

[01:21] If playing the Beatles pinball machine seems to be worth eight thousand dollars and later on in the show

[01:28] I'm going to interview

[01:30] Sean McDermott who is an operator who's down at the Iopas show in Florida who actually had a chance to play the Beatles machine today

[01:38] And we're gonna get his views on the Beatles pinball machine all right

[01:42] So that's coming up later on in the show all right

[01:44] But the main thing I've been looking at is just whether or not you think the

[01:48] twelve thousand dollar or the twenty five thousand dollar diamond edition of this game

[01:53] Makes any logical sense whatsoever and I think it doesn't but again, but again

[02:00] They're not targeting me with this game

[02:03] But I think here's what just makes me laugh is I look at the game like look at the diamond edition of Beatles and tell me one thing

[02:11] For twenty five thousand dollars should this game not have

[02:16] Armor that actually has like lollipop rails on it or laser etched rails on the game

[02:24] Should this game not have a shaker motor should this game not have a topper?

[02:28] I don't even know if the game comes with

[02:31] Stern's anti-reflective glass. I mean the whole thing to me. It's the same game as the eight thousand dollar game

[02:39] All right, but here's the thing here's the thing we're now hearing on

[02:44] Pinside that it sold out that all of the allotment of the Beatles has been spoken for by distributors across the world and

[02:54] And and so I don't know if that's both allotments because we know that they're going to make

[03:01] half of the

[03:02] 1964 games and then they're gonna hit pause you know why they're gonna hit pause is then they're gonna start making a

[03:09] Little game called the monsters in December so we're gonna see the monsters in mid-December and then they're probably gonna turn back on

[03:19] More Beatles at a later date. So

[03:23] What I can't figure out is this though, right? And we've all been sharing our opinions about

[03:29] This game and whether we think it's worth or not or whether or not it's attractive to us

[03:33] But I really don't

[03:35] Understand the people that are really mad at Stern for doing this. Okay, that's what I don't get

[03:43] I've been reading a lot on Pinside and people seem to be like rooting for Stern to fail here

[03:51] Because there seems to be this like over arching desire to see Stern fail

[03:58] Almost as if people want Stern to learn a lesson and I'm here to tell you right now

[04:04] Stern is never gonna learn a lesson because people complain on Pinside Stern is never gonna learn a lesson because

[04:11] You think that they didn't put enough in the machine and then you're gonna show them

[04:16] That you mean business and you're not gonna buy their next game because of that

[04:21] Let me just break it down for all the you real simple Stern makes 75 Pimbal machines a game

[04:26] They put them in boxes and they send them around the world every fucking day the line is going this company is like a monster

[04:34] pumping out

[04:36] Pimbal into the world and everybody else

[04:39] Who tries to do what they do is a fucking joke?

[04:44] All right everyone else who tries to deliver consistent Pimbal machines based on themes you want

[04:52] continually fucks up and so it's hard to tell anyone over at Stern that

[04:59] They're really fucking this up or they're doing this wrong or that you

[05:05] Pinside baby you know how to do it better

[05:09] You know how to do it better and you can read the people

[05:12] It's like they don't want Stern to sell these games. They want

[05:18] Stern to somehow like like fail here and look

[05:22] I don't think they're gonna sell a hundred at twenty five thousand dollars, right?

[05:26] There's not there are not a hundred people out there that are that stupid and I don't think Stern cares

[05:32] If they sell those games for 25,000 or 8,000 the platinum editions and

[05:40] The diamond editions are pretty much

[05:43] Freebies that they're giving to the distributors as a thank you

[05:50] for buying

[05:52] Their games they are basically gifting them these games you have to look at them like that sure

[05:59] You know certain distributors are

[06:03] Pricing them at 25,000 dollars and guess what if they don't sell they'll sell to you for 20 if they don't sell for 20

[06:11] They'll sell to you for 15 and we all know a year from now when the Beatles hype has completely died down

[06:18] And we're all on to the next-turn game every three to four months

[06:23] You'll be able to get these games at a good deal and you know what at least they're out in the world

[06:30] Okay, that's my whole take on it is if you just wait these these crazy quoted prices

[06:38] You guys are all suckers, okay, and I'm gonna say this the reason why I think the Pinside Babies are suckers

[06:44] You all are getting hoodwinked by Stern's marketing department all right

[06:49] I complained about their responsibility of making the most expensive game all time

[06:53] But you guys realize the whole point the whole point of them making a diamond and a platinum edition

[07:01] That doesn't really have anything special in it but charging those crazy prices

[07:07] You know what the reason why they're doing this they might think they're smarter than canada, but they're not

[07:13] The reason why they're doing it is to make the gold edition by which they will make the majority of these games

[07:21] Look like a fucking deal it all of a sudden makes people say well, yeah, that's stupid

[07:28] Those guys are suckers, but I'll go in on a gold because it's the same game. Let me tell you something

[07:33] I bet Stern is making

[07:36] Bank on the gold edition of this machine bank and they're gonna lap all the way to the bank because the

[07:45] Platinum's and the diamonds are just

[07:47] Distractions that are stupid and they know they're stupid and they know there's no real value in them at all

[07:54] All they're designed to do is make you feel like you're getting a bargain a

[08:00] Bargain on the gold even though you're not right you ever go buy like a like carpet like a rug you ever go buy a rug

[08:08] It's always like this rug was originally $40,000. There's now it's $5,000

[08:13] You're like oh yeah take my that is what the diamond edition is meant to do

[08:19] It's meant to get you to buy the gold and they will sell

[08:25] Every single gold edition they make and they won't give a shit that there's a few people complaining about the other editions and

[08:35] They were well forever

[08:37] Forever for years to come people who have diamond editions will never reveal what they paid

[08:44] Because that's just the way it is on this game all right

[08:47] Let's move on I think the crime will continue, but every gold will sell

[08:52] Don't get me wrong all right

[08:54] What is happening else in the pinball world before I air the the impressions from Sean?

[08:59] Look

[09:00] Here's here's something that is that sucks and when you go to the Jersey Jack pinball

[09:07] Pirates of the Caribbean we've waited a year for this game when you go into the owners

[09:12] Thread of pirates of the Caribbean it feels more like a trouble shooting thread than an owners thread

[09:20] And if I was an owner of pirates of the Caribbean collector's edition, which is about to go on the line

[09:27] I'd be really nervous that they're not gonna figure all this stuff out

[09:31] Before you get your game and and it sucks because you know

[09:36] Jack is trying to do so much with pinball, but the quality control

[09:41] Once again is coming back to bite Jack and what Jack doesn't realize is you have to get this shit tighter or

[09:50] people will just

[09:52] Not go in on your game and they'll just wait

[09:56] You know they will just wait and they will experience the product that took you years to make

[10:03] But they'll just wait and get it second-hand until all the issues are ironed out now the problem when that happens is that Jack won't see a

[10:12] Fucking dime of that money and let me give you an example of what I mean by that the

[10:16] The Hobbit all of a sudden now is getting praised as being a great game, all right now

[10:24] Who in the right mind would go buy a fucking black arrow edition of the hobbit for

[10:31] $8400 when I can go get a

[10:33] Smowg

[10:35] Limited edition gold with rad cows playfield protector everything I'd want in a game for around

[10:42] $6,000 all right that's crazy and

[10:47] The Hobbit deals are to be have everywhere and one of the reasons why you can go get the hobbit

[10:54] So cheap now is it's been out forever

[10:59] People who have had it for so long are now tired of it and even though the code is finally good

[11:05] Nobody feels like this game is bolted to my floor and I'm not gonna get rid of it

[11:10] And in fact a lot of people are probably just trying to sell it to get the newer Jersey Jack game pirates of the Caribbean

[11:17] Or they want to get a dialed in or they want to get a monster's or you know what I'm saying? It's like the game's window

[11:24] They they just couldn't get it right and for some reason

[11:28] You know whether it's the quality control issues whether it's the lack of code

[11:33] Whatever it is it always seems like you know by the time you really want to own a Jersey Jack game

[11:40] You can get it, but none of that money will go to helping Jack in his cause and keeping that company

[11:46] profitable where Stern has the exact opposite approach which is so much more effective for Stern

[11:52] Which is they will sell out of their game before you even see it like Stern will sell I mean I I shit you not they will probably sell

[12:03] Something like a thousand a twelve-hundred-and-a-muntars in one week

[12:09] All right one week they will probably get at least that many orders they will sell out of the LEs

[12:15] And they will sell a ton of premiums and they will sell a ton of pros in one week and Jack will spend a few years

[12:24] Trying to sell that many dialed in all right and

[12:27] Look look look. I mean that's just just the way it is. It's crazy. It's crazy

[12:32] He needs marketing help. He needs it badly. He needs to reevaluate all this stuff

[12:38] I just don't see pirates of the Caribbean

[12:41] Demand coming back when people are opening their games and having a ton of issues

[12:47] In fact, I'm going to have one of the pirates of the Caribbean owners on the show to talk about what it's like to open up your game

[12:55] new in box and

[12:57] You have to remove the upper play field you have broken wires you have switch issues

[13:02] There's a jack thing ball issues, you know, there's all these different things

[13:06] I saw someone that has like a decal issue, you know, it's looking I get its pinball and I get that pinball needs to be tweaked

[13:14] but but

[13:17] There haven't even been that many pirates the Caribbean that have been sent out yet and

[13:23] Look at the issues and Stern sends so many more games out and look how few issues they have

[13:30] And I'm gonna talk about this a little bit with with Sean

[13:34] But basically like you have to give Stern credit. They looked at all the things that create headaches for owners and

[13:41] They tried as hard as they could to minimize the kinds of things that would create constant failure

[13:49] Because no matter how much is in your game

[13:52] There's nothing more frustrating than asking someone to open up their new in box game and have to fix stuff

[13:59] That requires a high level of skill to get working again and you know

[14:05] I even heard stuff like the way the wires are bundled

[14:08] Underneath the game and pirates the Caribbean is a little bit of a nightmare to even take apart

[14:14] The upper play field like you have to cut all these zip ties because they didn't think

[14:19] You know how should we bundle the wires to make it easier for customers to have to service this thing and

[14:27] So look I mean I just think like it's it's a shame

[14:32] It really is a shame. I don't think you can send consumers games that require too much tweaking all right

[14:39] Speaking of sending consumers games

[14:41] Chicago gaming company the rumors of them being sold out have been

[14:46] somewhat confirmed by Chicago gaming company. I mean basically what they said is that they're pretty much done

[14:53] With their allotment of

[14:56] 12,500 games in terms of

[15:00] distributors

[15:01] claiming games now that's sell through that doesn't mean sold out that means that

[15:07] distributors placed orders and some of those distributors have sold out of their allotment

[15:13] But it doesn't sound like there's a lot more games that are going to be available

[15:18] Two distributors now I also think a lot of distributors are gonna stock up on this title because it's so popular

[15:25] So I wouldn't worry that you need to buy one like this week or you're gonna get shut out

[15:30] I do think that there is often a a common fallacy and

[15:36] This is spread by distributors and it's a great tactic to call up people and say get them why they last

[15:42] You got you know I'm oh I'm I the phrase I always hear is I've got two left

[15:47] I got two left you want one. I usually keep one for myself. I'll let you have the last one bull shit

[15:52] They're gonna you know I do think these games are gonna sell

[15:55] But I also think they're gonna be available for for maybe a few months and I think people are gonna wait to see about monsters too

[16:02] Speaking of updates

[16:03] This is a crazy turn of events, but Iceman has just texted me that he has purchased a

[16:10] Beatles gold edition and he said it looks cool now

[16:14] That's not proof enough that they're gonna sell every single gold. I don't know what what was you know

[16:19] He was he was start he started the thread that said how bad is it selling?

[16:22] He was the one of the biggest

[16:25] Detractors from Stern making this game and guess what happened he just bought one

[16:30] You know, I mean that's it. That's all pinball is you make something you make it beautiful

[16:35] You make it available and you make the theme something people like and they're gonna buy your product

[16:41] You know that's really all this whole hobby boils down to I

[16:45] heard that there are going to be some

[16:50] Geometry issues addressed with October fest Joe Bolser said that he thinks that some of the shots

[16:56] Could be made a little different that some of them might be a little too hard and some of them just might not make sense

[17:04] You might be hitting some you know some of the things too often or whatnot or putting them

[17:08] You know a scoop underneath a ramp or whatever it was

[17:12] So October Fest has worked to be done and

[17:16] The question I have for the American pinball people is when is this game gonna now ship?

[17:22] Do you really think that Joe Bolser can make geometry changes to the game?

[17:29] Which would also require probably some artwork changes around that geometry changes and they're probably not major changes

[17:36] But when it when is this game going to be like the final version of it?

[17:42] And I think that's a big question I have in my head because all right if you think about it now

[17:47] They need to go back and redo animations. They need to go back and redo the artwork

[17:52] They need to go back and redo some of the shot geometry and the distributors are already taking money on the game

[17:59] I mean just think about how stupid that is for a minute when was the last time?

[18:04] Stern pinball the most successful pinball company in the world showed you a game and

[18:10] Then immediately said all right well we have work to do on the art all right well

[18:14] We have worked to do on some of the shots all right well. We have worked to do on some of the animation well

[18:18] We have worked to do exactly exactly my point

[18:22] You know I look I'm I'm always getting tired of

[18:25] Covering these companies who don't fucking listen they don't fucking do their homework and I'm sorry

[18:32] I'm sorry to be strident, but Joe Balser Josh Kugler normal, you know, double do your fucking homework

[18:40] All right, and by that by that you know what I mean by that

[18:45] Imagine if you're in a classroom and

[18:49] Five different teams have been given the same assignment and that assignment is make a good pinball machine

[18:55] Show me what you think a good pinball machine needs to sell show me what you think a good pinball machine needs to sell

[19:01] Immediately to people and show me, you know

[19:04] You know what you think you're you know you're marketing approach will be to get people to buy your game immediately

[19:11] And here's why I'm just getting fed up with these companies and I don't mean to be this like strident

[19:16] How fucking hard is it to do your homework when your homework has already been done for you all right

[19:25] Stern pinball is in that classroom with American pinball

[19:29] They've already shown American pinball what you have to do to create the right kind of hype and excitement and

[19:37] You know an enthusiasm to make your product succeed and you get one window

[19:44] By which to generate hype and excitement and get people to buy your product and

[19:49] They needed October Fest to be a fucking hit and they needed people to be like take my money now after seeing it at

[19:56] Expo and now they're doing what Stern has never done because they didn't do their fucking homework

[20:04] They didn't do it. They didn't realize the very simple fact that

[20:08] Nobody really wants you to go back and have to rework stuff as much as pinside will tell you

[20:15] Oh show us the game early and listen to feedback and make the game better and that will that will you know

[20:23] That will help you get more sales. Okay

[20:26] Did Chicago gaming company do that with monster bash remake Ellie?

[20:29] Did they show you early what they were working on that day?

[20:32] No, I mean I get they were making a remake of a game. You already knew it was great

[20:35] But do they ever have to do that has Stern ever done that with any of its games that they were hyper successful

[20:41] Absolutely not and this is the one thing that keeps

[20:45] You know messing all these new companies up is they don't do their fucking homework and the homework would tell you well

[20:51] We need great fucking art. We need great art

[20:53] Who had American pinball looked at that game and said you know what is this is good as like zombie Yeti is this is good as

[20:59] Christopher Franschi is this is good as dirty Donnie no, it's not it's not even close

[21:04] Not even close. Oh, that's one strike against us

[21:06] Who who sat over that game and looked at the animations instead of these animations good?

[21:10] Are these on par with with where Stern is at with a 5,000 or pro and if they need to be on par

[21:16] Well, who do we need to hire to make that the case did they do that between Houdini and Octobre Fest?

[21:21] No, they didn't all right

[21:24] What else the shot geometry has Stern ever like released a game and then even with bad shot geometry look at Ghostbusters even with shitty shitty shitty

[21:33] Shot geometry Stern doesn't allow you they don't allow you to see their weaknesses

[21:39] By the time you realize a Stern game has weaknesses. What's happened? You've already fucking bought it

[21:45] They sold out of Ghostbusters

[21:48] Ellie before they even showed it and before people realized it was one of the biggest dogs and pinball history what happened

[21:55] You already had bought it you already had money in with your distributors. You already paid your distributors for it

[22:01] That's genius and

[22:04] The problem now is this now all this stuff has to be addressed with Octobre Fest the 3d sculpts

[22:11] Don't look right the artwork on the cabinets the this the that the this the that they're never gonna get the hype back again

[22:17] They're never gonna get the hype back again and the amount of work required to get this game to feel like as specials like a

[22:23] Monsters will be or a Beatles or you know a monster bash remake Ellie

[22:27] When are they gonna how they gonna recapture any of that? They're not gonna do it. They fucked up

[22:32] They needed to take this second game a lot more

[22:37] Seriously than they did and I'm sorry, but it's not just about like you know them creating like all this like cool stuff in the game

[22:47] Because the sum of the parts has to be on par where everyone else's homework assignment is I'm sorry

[22:54] It's not enough to just put a lot of like mechs in a game if the sum of the parts of the whole package

[23:02] It's just doesn't look good and the problem with it all is like I can't underscore enough

[23:08] How important it is to make a game look good now

[23:12] Everything Stern puts out from now on will be sexy as fuck, okay?

[23:21] Stern's children from now on are all hot and

[23:24] There's nothing that anyone else can do but also make hot kids and you need to make your game

[23:31] Look sexy as fuck and I'm sorry, but like there's no excuse in

[23:35] 2018 for anyone to take a compromise on the art

[23:38] I mean look how nice Alice Cooper nightmare castle looks right would people be like

[23:43] Clamoring for that game if it looked like America's most honoured they wouldn't sell like a hundred of them

[23:49] You know, but we're we're we're basically

[23:53] Mind fucked by the artwork. It looks sexy as fuck. I'll give it a shot

[23:57] You're gonna want it to shoot well because it looks so good

[24:00] But if it doesn't look good, you're not gonna want to get in bed with it

[24:03] And that's the reality of where pinball is in 2018 all right?

[24:08] All right, what else is going on can you just pinball podcast episode 282?

[24:13] Let me air the interview with Sean McDermott in a second. I want to read some

[24:21] Let's see. I do some of my

[24:23] User mail there hasn't been much I thought I'd get more after the

[24:27] After the last podcast, but I think you guys are just enjoying it right you don't even need to you don't even need to write in anymore

[24:34] I've just satiated and scratched every itch you have in the pinball world

[24:40] But let me read a few things here

[24:42] Waiting for my Gmail to load. I'm not even gonna edit this out

[24:45] I might even do a Christopher French long moment of silence hold on a second here we go

[24:50] All right, I won't make you wait any longer. I'm gonna read you an email and then we're gonna do the Sean McDermott interview

[25:00] This is from Joseph Laporte. He says hi Chris. I just listened to episode 281 on the Beatles pinball diamond edition

[25:06] Great podcast as always and kudos for going above and beyond and trying to nail down the price

[25:12] It sounded like you were reading off a prepared script this time

[25:16] Which made your arguments more compelling having said that I can't help but wonder what you expected when you call the dealers

[25:24] As soon as I heard that the Beatles was being sold to the dealers in lots of ten it all made sense on their strategy in my opinion

[25:32] This isn't about marketing. It's about sound business decision

[25:37] We tend to romanticize pinball as collectors, but to stern as a manufacturer

[25:42] It's about moving inventory of wooden boxes with steel ball moving around in it

[25:48] Stern paid a lot for the license so they need to move the inventory fast

[25:52] So they can move on to the other projects and put Beatles behind them by having the dealers commit to the inventory

[25:59] They can do that

[26:00] They also know almost immediately what their ROI is as they move all

[26:05] 1964 machines to the dealers and get the cash in hand

[26:10] Assumantly in 30 days

[26:12] Secondly, we all know the dealers struggle in making a profit selling pinball. That's why almost all of the sell other games

[26:20] Wait, that's why almost all sell other games

[26:23] Stern wants them to put their efforts into selling their products not someone else's

[26:28] What better way than to dangle a carrot to make a big profit?

[26:33] But to get the carrot you have to buy two radishes and seven potatoes the dealers will hold onto the carrot to see who is willing to pay the most for it

[26:43] While getting the opportunity to sell the potatoes to those who aren't willing to pay enough

[26:48] Or the dealers have the opportunity to reward one of their best customers and keep

[26:53] That customer rather than losing them to another dealer. It's just business

[26:58] Well, Joseph first of all

[26:59] Yeah, I think you're right. I think that's exactly what we were getting out earlier in the show as I think that makes total sense right

[27:06] He also goes on to say I should also mention that I believe it is illegal in the US for companies to set a ceiling or a

[27:14] Undealer prices. I think that's considered price fixing

[27:18] That's one of the reasons why we see suggested retail prices rather than firm prices if I'm not mistaken

[27:25] They can set a basement price, but not a ceiling

[27:29] You know that many of the dealers had to be seeing what happened with the supreme machines and those people who made a lot of money flipping them

[27:37] meanwhile

[27:38] They look at their inventory of unsold stern machines and complain to stern about why they don't get the opportunity to make some extra money

[27:47] Rather than some random non-pimbal person with no skin in the game

[27:51] Stern has to protect their relationship with their dealers since if there aren't viable

[27:58] Stern has less outlets to sell machines again. It's just business. So Joseph, let me stop you there

[28:02] I think you're right and I think what they're probably saying is what I've done in this hobby is

[28:09] I can go do a distributor and so can you out there and I can say I would like an iron maiden Ellie

[28:17] Can I have it and the dealer says yes, Chris you can have it for

[28:21] $9,000 or $8,500 whatever I paid the dealer right then I immediately turn around without even taking the machine and

[28:32] Then it can sell it to someone who missed out on it for $12,000

[28:37] And he pays me the $12,000. I give the dealer nine and the dealer sends him the game

[28:46] And that is the basic

[28:49] economics of flipping pinball machines before you even take possession of it now dealers don't like to do that

[28:57] Because dealers get in trouble, but I do agree that you know the pinball distributors have been missing out on the ability to do that

[29:07] during hot title releases

[29:10] But it's also really hard for them to do it in pinball because people complain a lot

[29:15] You know in the car industry I there's still car dealers ships out there with Dodge demon sitting on the showroom floor for

[29:22] $140,000 just waiting for someone who wants it bad enough and they don't care because that car gets them in and they sell those

[29:28] You know customers other things as they walk into the showroom

[29:32] So I guess it's a good thing that the pinball distributors are more

[29:37] Ethical but they're also leaving money on the table. So you're right

[29:39] I think this was an effort to give them something that people couldn't complain about

[29:44] And in essence making the dealer the flipper

[29:48] You know, that's exactly what Stern did here

[29:51] He then goes on to say in the end

[29:54] This strategy makes sense Stern gets to move inventory quickly to pay for an expensive license the dealers get to make a bit more cash

[30:02] At least on the diamond and platinum addition since they are on the front lines of the industry and know the customers

[30:08] We're willing to pay the most the bigger dealers get rewarded the most

[30:12] Since they have the cash flow to be able to finance the machines

[30:15] They end up sharing the risk with Stern and they're

[30:19] Incented to move as many machines as possible since they have to move the gold additions out of inventory

[30:25] I think this will become new pinball business model

[30:29] Especially on machines expected to sell out the question that remains which ones are expected to sell out

[30:36] That's the only place in this whole scenario where marketing plays the pivotal role

[30:41] But it's done at the dealer level in a niche market like this

[30:45] We all know the vast majority of collectors want to flip a machine before they buy it

[30:51] The early adopters don't care

[30:54] This is also why pinball isn't successful through outlets like Amazon the vast majority of buyers need to touch and feel it

[31:02] This requires successful dealers physically located all over that can stay in business and well a 10 trade shows

[31:10] They all need to be around to keep the business viable keep up the good work Chris

[31:15] I don't always agree with your opinions, but at least you have one and I'm afraid to stand behind it

[31:21] Joe Plainfield on pinside well Joseph

[31:24] First of all, thank you. I think that was probably one of the most well articulated

[31:29] Brilliant emails I've ever received and I do think you hit the nail on the head that I think this is just to beginning

[31:39] of stern realizing that the people who should be rewarded

[31:45] For helping them sell the high demand games

[31:49] Are the distributors not the flippers all right takes a guy like me out of the equation

[31:55] So let's say for example the monsters comes out

[31:59] Are we going to see stern say there are

[32:03] 500 L.E.s

[32:05] The only way you can get an L.E. is if you buy x amount of premiums and x amount of pros

[32:12] And the price on the li is up to you to set

[32:17] See what's interesting about this though

[32:20] Is what they set the price of that li because stern has a precedence for nine thousand dollar li's

[32:30] There is no there is nothing

[32:33] That even indicates why a Beatles would be 25,000 dollars

[32:38] But I feel like all the distributors simply could get together and work together

[32:44] To all sell it at the same price now the problem is if one dude quotes me 25 like on my phone call and then that other guy is like

[32:50] Well, I'll take 20 and then some dude tells me he sold it for 12

[32:55] I think that is going to create a lot of market instability for the L.E.s

[33:01] But

[33:02] But if you really want an early of a game that is like sold out

[33:09] Um, you know, wouldn't you rather be able to deal with the distributor and you know versus like a flipper

[33:17] But you know the devil's advocate in me is you're simply empowering

[33:22] The dealers to become the flippers and so I would I would argue that

[33:28] Nobody likes someone trying to make extra profit on something without without doing any of the work

[33:33] And ultimately because this is a niche market. This isn't huge like

[33:37] People who buy cars and other things where there's a lot more people in the marketplace

[33:41] I think the problem is

[33:44] Is if you get too many people overpaying for something that

[33:49] Where the values not there. See that's the big thing for me is like it's hard to just

[33:55] To jump at the hype and pay way over for something

[33:59] When the values not there and it's like the guy who bought iron maiden off me for 12,000 dollars

[34:05] You know, what does he feel like today when I keep seeing the L.E.s now selling for eight?

[34:09] Like he paid four thousand more

[34:12] For a game that he basically could have just waited for and got for four thousand dollars less

[34:19] You know, I like look I'm as a salesman

[34:22] I want to play off the hype. I want to play off people's like desires to have to have it now

[34:29] But as time goes on

[34:32] You know, and there's so many games coming out pretty frequently

[34:35] I don't think you can keep asking people to pay a lot more than a game's value

[34:41] Is and by value, I mean like what's actually in the game

[34:44] All right, but look I don't even think we've seen the ceiling at Stern said we're only making a hundred jaws machines

[34:52] Just a hundred and we're only going to make a hundred jaws machines

[34:56] I think they could sell everyone for fifty thousand dollars. I'm not being crazy here

[35:01] I'm not being crazy only a hundred ever

[35:04] fifty grand

[35:06] Would you buy it?

[35:07] Jaws what if it was back to the future right anyway

[35:11] Great email gonna be interesting to see where Stern goes with this if they're gonna learn a new approach to marketing

[35:18] And cut out the flippers in the middleman and let the distributors get the cheese all right

[35:23] Let me hear the interview with Sean. I think he'll enjoy it and then everyone

[35:27] We'll be back real soon with more episodes of canators pinball podcast

[35:31] All right ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome back to canators pinball podcast Sean McDermott who's an operator

[35:38] um

[35:39] Various coin op machines and Sean's been on the show before but the reason I wanted to have him on tonight

[35:45] Is Sean you are one of the first people in the world

[35:49] To play the ever so polarizing beetles pinball machine right?

[35:54] Yes, sir

[35:55] And it's down there at iop and florida now for for those of you who listen to the show iop

[36:00] Sean is white. It's a coin op convention where they show all the new stuff coming out

[36:05] Yeah, it's like the international amusement parks and ex-bow essentially

[36:10] I don't there's something like that for amusement parks operators and it's a decent show right it's an awesome show

[36:16] Okay, I was kind of confused why beetles was there. I thought it wasn't gonna have a coin door

[36:21] Did it have a coin door? Yeah, yeah, it did. I was surprised. I thought they weren't gonna let us do that

[36:26] So I didn't even care about it

[36:28] I feel like that coin door adds another couple thousand dollars to the value

[36:32] I think after all the debate

[36:34] So they they had two gold editions of the game there right?

[36:39] Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah, they did um

[36:41] And there you know there was people were playing them. There's some excitement about it

[36:45] It's it looks like your average stern pro machine with less stuff right and gold rails right and a higher price

[36:53] Well, what was your impression like so you you've actually seen it with your own eyes and and

[36:58] When you walk over them to the machine just walk us through like what it was like seeing it for the first time

[37:04] What it was like playing it for the first time like you you know a lot about pinball

[37:07] So what what were your impressions of the game?

[37:10] Well, it was a very pretty game, you know

[37:12] It wasn't like the artwork was in horrible

[37:15] I'm not a beetles fan. I was gonna get that out of the way. So

[37:18] It didn't really do anything for me that way just theme goes um

[37:23] I was impressed by the animations of the game

[37:25] They were better than you expect from stern. They weren't you know great

[37:30] They weren't Jersey jack level, but they were a little bit better or at least polished enough

[37:34] Compared to like October fast or something like that

[37:38] But it's a it's a simple game. They asked what they had it set up pretty steep

[37:42] So I don't know if that played a part. It just it seemed odd playing that style of game with the modern stern flippers

[37:49] Um, it just seemed a little off to me

[37:52] But it's it's a it's a simple 80s game really, you know, so I

[37:56] I was it too blown away. I mean, I had more fun playing Deadpool to be honest

[38:01] um

[38:01] But if you're a beetles fan, I could see how you would maybe possibly want this right but as an operator

[38:08] I say no

[38:08] No, as so you say no as an operator so you don't think this game on location would have

[38:14] strong appeal

[38:17] Um

[38:18] It may have appeal, but it will never justify the cost right and and we'll say that you mean

[38:23] The gold edition is

[38:25] $8,000 is the actual that wasn't exactly sure

[38:28] Yeah, that's the why I heard from a couple people I didn't talk to any stern raps. I know zack was there

[38:33] I think the one of the sharp brothers and you know Gary stern was there he's growing a beard for some reason

[38:37] I think he's gonna be Santa Claus

[38:39] but

[38:41] It looked like it in the end, but yeah, at eight thousand dollars. I would go buy

[38:45] Anything else there. I was impressed by like obviously the monster bash the jersey jack stuff of course

[38:51] Right, you know the certain pearls are okay

[38:53] Definitely want to talk about what else you saw at the show, but just on beetles for a few other things

[38:58] Oh, yeah, no, sure. What was the code at were you able to determine what the code number was in the game?

[39:04] No, I was not um

[39:07] It didn't seem like there was any placeholder graphics except for maybe at the high score table and stuff like that

[39:13] If you got a high score that was some placeholder graphics. I had kind of a retro

[39:18] Like it looked like score reels on the display

[39:22] You know and a lot of like flash around the the animations of tax and stuff

[39:27] I wasn't impressed by the music. It was kind of hard to hear it. So I really can't

[39:31] Give honest opinion if the music was decent or not, but it didn't seem like it had any good songs at that

[39:38] I would know, you know

[39:40] Well, you're not a beetles fan. So when it's got like she's got a ticket to ride

[39:44] I heard that playing a lot in some of the video

[39:47] And I think I saw someone posted that the code was 1.04 so this is probably gonna ship to consumers

[39:55] Pretty much finished which I think it which I think is good right? It's it's not gonna be like one of these games that takes two years before it's complete

[40:03] Um

[40:04] Now were you able to activate any of the magnets in the game when you played was it pretty easy to understand what to do in the game?

[40:11] Yeah, it was fairly easy to understand. I did activate the magnet at the top of the

[40:15] At the arch at the top of the orbit

[40:17] I don't exactly know how I did it and I am but there's so much stuff going on and so much stuff to see your mind is just crazy. So

[40:25] I'm pretty much dumbed down to the level of the average, you know

[40:29] Can't catch wills player so

[40:31] Um, it you know hit the drop targets the thing spins in the middle. I was kind of a the magnet

[40:38] Kind of holds the ball in the middle and I was kind of afraid it was gonna drop it straight down the middle on me a few times

[40:43] I didn't really like that. I think that might be kind of a

[40:47] Kind of downside to the game, right

[40:50] But was there any do you notice any dimples in the play field? That's always a big thing

[40:55] I would tell you that the quality is the same as Stern has always done

[40:59] There's nothing nothing anything better, you know, you're not paying for any more quality

[41:04] um, you know, there's the same drop target max. It's the same plastic the same post the same flamin

[41:09] You know, there's nothing there's no extra cold of clear coat on there or something

[41:14] Nothing we've never seen before and

[41:17] What's interesting about this game? So and I've been asking some people this question. I haven't

[41:21] Had an answer, but I'm wondering if you were able to tell

[41:23] Does this even come with the better glass like the anti-reflective glass or I know

[41:29] I do shaker

[41:31] We weren't supposed to film there and I was filming anyway, so I was kind of trying to be secretive about it

[41:37] but um, I did it's the glass look like

[41:41] Dandard glass to me. I didn't notice it didn't have any markings on it or stickers that would say it was anything otherwise

[41:46] I didn't notice any flyers for the game either which is weird

[41:49] Right, I may have missed them. So it seems that for

[41:53] The money though. I mean if you're gonna want a Beatles

[41:56] This eight thousand dollar machine is is the exact same machine as the twelve thousand dollar machine

[42:01] Which is the exact same machine as the twenty five thousand dollar machine?

[42:06] So 25,000 for the diamond edition. That's what yeah, that's what the um distributors are quoting people at if they want to have one of

[42:14] 100 now the more I keep thinking about it

[42:16] It is kind of crazy because the diamond doesn't come with anything

[42:20] more in terms of like

[42:24] Lays or like a hammer shaker or anything. I mean, I think it's just real back glass

[42:29] Apparently this one expensive

[42:31] Yeah, the gold has like gold rails and then the more expensive ones have just the black powder coat right?

[42:37] It's what looks like in the pictures. I'm not now they've got like platinum's got like a sort of like a silver and then the diamond

[42:42] Seems like it has like a sparkly flake silver kind of appearance to it

[42:46] But none of them have like none of them maybe even have like lolly pop rails or anything laser edged for not

[42:50] Not even have anything to protect the button area. No, it's all just like

[42:55] It's it's really it's really interesting that

[42:58] They they literally looks like they didn't go the extra mile to like make the editions much different other than the different art packages

[43:06] Okay, so you're at iapah

[43:08] How much pinball presence was at the show this year?

[43:11] As the total of the show or total of the amusement portion of the show

[43:15] Because the show covers rollercoasters and everything. So I mean

[43:18] Well, no, I mean, well, yeah, I mean what what I'm asking is what was the pinball presence like like who was there Jersey Jack Chicago gaming?

[43:25] What did you see and that was it?

[43:28] Which um the valley dynamo guys had the pigeon bat from Dennis Nordman the

[43:33] That pigeon batty did the zombie. I can never hear about that game. Is it even out? It's been out for a while

[43:38] Yeah, I think it's it's been out in the just my distributors have it

[43:43] um

[43:44] It's it's expensive you know

[43:46] I don't want to say one more thing on the Beatles. Yeah, um, I guess you know the price may be justified if you had a like a super high volume location

[43:54] And you wanted a classic game

[43:57] Versus trying to keep an old 80s game running all the time you know that maybe justified that way

[44:03] If you had us unlike I'm talking extreme volume location like

[44:07] Like a David Buster's or a big FEC where you're you know doing

[44:11] $1,000 a week on it or something so I keep hearing

[44:15] Through the grapevine that's starting to do some sort of

[44:18] Marketing launch in New York City and I keep asking myself like where were they bring it that is worthy of

[44:25] Any moment is the hard rock cafe even still around in Times Square? I don't even think it is. I don't know

[44:33] You wouldn't know

[44:35] That's what I like I could see them trying to put these things

[44:39] And maybe David Busters maybe this this feels like a casual enough pen to put inside of David Busters, but

[44:48] You you follow like the coin op stuff that works well there. I mean with it how does even like

[44:53] Do next to a 20 foot tall Pac-Man machine?

[44:57] I mean yeah the pinball presence if you want to go overall amusement

[45:00] I would say it's total of the whole like stuff that I had to choose from

[45:04] It's like point all 1%

[45:06] You know, it's like it's it's a small little corner. They have a big booth there for for you know for Stern

[45:11] But as booths go there is this pretty small compared to like bettson or ice or bay tech and stuff like that right so

[45:20] You know, I saw a lot of things and

[45:23] Pinball is one of those things that we like to have so we have it

[45:26] But you know when it comes to buying a pin

[45:30] Yeah, I don't know if that if that thing is just the price really that it really gets me you know

[45:34] We have a lot better themes in the pro range

[45:36] That are a hell of a cheaper and I don't see the point I was just um

[45:40] I don't see I was just kind of confused why it was even there

[45:43] I thought was being targeted towards home collectors and things I

[45:47] Last I heard it didn't have a coin door or so right I was surprised even see it there

[45:52] Right right and and so yeah, I mean I guess the the jury is still out on whether or not operators will be putting

[45:59] You know

[46:01] You know like you guys in New York, but the pinball bars that specializing pinball will do it

[46:06] I mean I expect to see this thing at like a sunshine or yeah, you know other very you know

[46:13] Like Logan's arcade in Chicago like the places that have like tons of pens. I mean they always get the the latest and greatest

[46:20] Um, but it is you know, it is an eight thousand dollar

[46:24] Collectible right? I mean we heard Stern say this is instant collectible

[46:29] And do you really want to route in instant collectible?

[46:33] I know no

[46:34] Unless but someone specifically makes us get it

[46:38] You know

[46:39] Yes, that might be the only thing that you know, I have some location that says we need to have this game

[46:43] Or we're we're not gonna have the jukebox and stuff so then yeah, right

[46:47] And so was was pired to the Caribbean at the show or monster

[46:51] Yeah, yeah, I talked to Jack a little bit um, I talked to um

[46:56] the guy from

[46:58] Chicago gaming a little bit

[47:00] The pirates I mean jack's booth was kind of small to be honest. I don't want to say anything bad too much, but

[47:06] You know, it was it was a tiny little corner piece. It compared to Stern, you know like four games five games like that

[47:12] So how many did Stern have?

[47:15] Like a he would they had their big like set up again like where it's like got the

[47:19] Big

[47:21] Six games under that big billboard. They're trying to sell us with their logo on it

[47:25] And then the two beetles and then they had a little area to the wheel and deal right

[47:30] Well if you're an operator though, I mean at the end of the day

[47:34] Stern

[47:35] Gives you the thing you want which is a five thousand dollar theme everybody knows

[47:41] Game to get people the pump dollars into I mean right yeah, no, I mean we had a good luck with guardians

[47:47] We had a guardians um

[47:49] Other than the cabinet working all that stuff, but um

[47:53] But I'm kind of waiting to see what deep roots gonna do. I you know, I'm kind of waiting to see what some of these other guys will do

[47:57] Even though I don't like buying from

[47:59] First first company in other first you know offering as you'd say

[48:05] Just because the company may go bust, you know, we don't do that pre-order thing or nothing as an operator

[48:09] I can't afford to do that sort of thing

[48:11] That's why I don't have any spooky games even though I'm from Wisconsin. I like I like Charlie and I like Ben and all those guys

[48:16] But I just can't afford to have money tied up so

[48:20] But they're not gonna go bust

[48:22] Well any of those things can go bust, you know

[48:25] This business is rough. I've been in it a long time

[48:28] I've seen companies come and go even ones that have been around a long time. I believe some valley, you know, right

[48:34] So what was sponsor bash remake like because I've been hearing nothing but good things about that game from

[48:38] That was a great game. Yeah, I would that if I was gonna spend money on a pin

[48:43] I was probably the one I was gonna get I would probably get this you know the cheaper one

[48:46] because most people don't care um and

[48:50] That would be for the price and the monestep you get I would that one is really impressive

[48:56] You know for the value for money, right? So apples to apples Beatles gold and monster bash remake L. Lee are both

[49:03] 8,000 are you saying that Sean? It's just like

[49:07] Kind of laughable that they're the same price. Yeah, I would I don't want to say laughable because I do like Stern

[49:13] I think they do know what they're doing

[49:15] But they yeah as an operator. I'd just go yeah, right, you know, it's it's laughable. Yeah, I guess

[49:21] But is that as an operator you see that bread even as a home collector or do you think just in general do you see the value being equal or is it

[49:30] And I need to put personally personally. I mean it is pins machines these pin games were selling you know

[49:36] At like 2005 and 2006 at a thousand bucks another selling for eight, you know

[49:41] Clip in a belly Williams stuff. It's five to eight thousand

[49:45] And I just don't see why I mean, I understand people love it and stuff

[49:49] But it's still an old machine, you know, so you know, you can't get parts. You know, you can get parts now

[49:54] But the time you couldn't and it's just um

[49:58] It's been a long day. I'm sorry. I'm kind of with my training, but um

[50:03] The money is just it's it's a little too high for what it is

[50:06] I have to I was I've been needing to go on the show before I came I mean before I came on the show and do the inflation

[50:11] Curriculum or what it should be at I think five or six thousand is probably the max they should be at right

[50:17] Like that's why math that that yeah that the storm pro is in line with where valley Williams games were in the mid 90s right so we haven't

[50:27] Really seen like a cash grab there now the argument then becomes

[50:33] Look what you got in those machines

[50:36] Right no, there's a lot more stuff in the monster bash as value for money goes

[50:41] I mean that would be the one that I would buy or the attack from ours even you know

[50:45] I'm just a little shaky on their electronics. It's a new. It's you know Chicago game has been around

[50:50] We have some other stuff that they built is just not pin games

[50:54] but

[50:55] it's

[50:57] It's just still it's their pinball venture is still kind of new and I'm afraid of getting into it and stuck with this machine

[51:02] Like an alien or something where it just it sits there. I can't get boards. You know, I got a dead piece of wood

[51:07] Right

[51:09] You know something I don't want to do. Stern's been around long enough. You know, I mean they could happen like I said anybody

[51:14] But you know, they've been around long enough that if a little more trust Chicago gaming

[51:18] I would I trust them pretty you know, they're pretty damn good and

[51:23] Like I said there they're what we call a traditional manufacturer, you know, they're not so many epic or odd or something

[51:28] So yeah, I that's a little more street cred for us a little more respect a little more trust

[51:34] So do you think like we know when you're at these shows and there's all these new

[51:38] arcade games. There's all these other like

[51:42] You know coin ops that are really designed. Yeah, there's a lot of amazing stuff

[51:47] Do you kind of feel bad when you see like jack in the corner

[51:51] Trying to make pinball like exciting, but yeah, I kind of bad for him, you know, I know he's

[51:57] Seems like they're struggling a little and

[52:00] He has a great product. It's just it's out of my price range, you know, I mean

[52:05] For they if you could get David Buster is debiting. I think they'd have better luck

[52:10] How many David Busters are there when you get a

[52:13] I want to say there's probably least a couple hundred two hundred to five hundred range. I think

[52:18] There's a lot um

[52:20] Right, I mean they I mean they's but they make a lot of money. So yeah, I don't and Wisconsin. We have two

[52:27] So when you go into a David Busters though, there's like almost nothing in there that can kind of

[52:33] break

[52:35] You know, there's no there's break. That's the stuff breaks they have

[52:38] You know, but it's mostly coin. It's mostly arcade right in like there's some stuff

[52:43] But for the most part, you know, I'm I'm reading this thread and I'm reading the the pirates of the caribbean thread

[52:48] And I'm seeing like out of the box

[52:51] There's like major issues that would keep an operator from turning the game on

[52:57] Yeah, the pinball machines are a little too complex. I mean

[53:00] You know the at David Busters they do have ski ball machines and a lot of mechanical action games

[53:06] That are redemption pieces. They have moving parts, you know balls screens all that stuff can break

[53:11] um, and they have a lot more of them, you know, and it takes a lot more of a beating than

[53:16] So but as a pin moment like a like a jersey jack game has way too much stuff

[53:20] You know for me to even you know, long as it's built good enough and it keeps going. That's fine

[53:24] Um, but I've you know, I was at the Disney parks over the weekend here and they had five

[53:30] um

[53:31] All the all the stern games that had Disney licenses pirates of caribbean and tron all of them

[53:36] Not have a word not a single one

[53:39] Except for the star wars the star wars they they they they just it's sort of worked

[53:43] Right as it was very sad

[53:44] So yeah, I've always said that

[53:47] Pinball on location for the most part unless it's in a pinball bar where the owner is meticulous at maintaining the machines

[53:56] It's just not a very good experience

[53:58] No, it really

[54:02] If you have a poor operator and the one that must be running the ones at the Disney parks must be poor because it's

[54:07] Like all the GI was out on all the games except for the one that was led, which was the star wars

[54:13] Right all the all the general illumination lights were out

[54:15] Then that's just sloppy, you know

[54:18] Where you know flippers don't work stuff like it's just

[54:21] It's pretty and they have a lot of play, right? But still it's it's kind of sloppy operations right

[54:27] What was the coolest thing you saw at the show out even you know even outside of pinball?

[54:33] I had to do with a lot of the VR

[54:35] interactive water slides

[54:39] As for video games go I saw the new halo that was pretty cool they have a new

[54:44] Superbikes racing game, you know, I mean, I can get one of those racing games

[54:49] You know for less than that Beatles so

[54:52] You know, I mean

[54:54] Like apples to apples now not really it's right it's not even close

[54:59] So maybe but maybe you know as we're talking Sean and you we talk about for operators having something that is

[55:07] Simple easy to maintain that will attract people

[55:11] You know, maybe stern is on to something with the Beatles because it is a game that's very

[55:16] Unintimidating to operate. I guess the question is is the theme relevant enough

[55:22] No to drop people in I don't think so maybe it is. I'm not like I said I'm out of Beatles fan and

[55:29] If there's a lot of Beatles fans though, so you put you put because you're a photographer, huh

[55:35] You put Beatles next to halo and you let the kids run in

[55:40] Yeah, but I mean the gamers, you know gamers are different crown too, so

[55:45] Yeah, I don't know it's it's Apple Ed. I don't know I

[55:48] If you get the right location if you had a 50s dive like a 50s theme diner 60s thing

[55:54] You know something like that. That's retro, you know

[55:56] It might do well, you know, it's just the same old thing. It's what we're saying. What were you saying about October fest?

[56:03] Well, you guys I know you and Ben rip that October festival

[56:06] I know you're going off about how it it's only one day there one month of the year or something like that

[56:12] Beer cell built you gotta remember beer cells every day of the year, you know

[56:18] I don't think they I don't think they did the proper amount of it. They just didn't do it right

[56:24] You know, I think it's not really the theme. It's more of the execution. So that's yeah, but I mean like it's like saying

[56:31] People get gifts all year round

[56:34] But Christmas man that thing's in December like same path. It's like calling yeah, but if you make it corny enough and about beer

[56:42] Beer is funny and it just wasn't funny enough and then the artwork was

[56:46] I know you guys pointed out the artwork. That's why it's beer funny

[56:50] Why don't you get lucky get funny you get you get me you put some jokes and if you made it like a ballet Williams game or something where they

[56:56] They had some dirty jokes in there and stuff. No, but it's not that though. It's not dirty

[57:00] I mean, I guess I still haven't already version

[57:02] But even then it's like okay, so let's say they want it to market this game put your best foot forward

[57:08] And they're going to pinball expo which is all older white guys telling dirty jokes for like three four days

[57:15] You bring your dirty joke joke version of the game to get them excited

[57:19] Yeah, I yeah, I mean, I don't know it

[57:23] It wasn't it's not that bad of an idea. It's just them think it was done right

[57:26] I mean don't have to do super offensive jokes. You just have to make it funny, you know, I don't think it was funny

[57:32] And it's just not

[57:34] Yeah, it's just and the art was not good

[57:37] People you guys pointed on all the flaws and as like now I can't unsee them so well

[57:42] They're going back to the drawing board. I know that they're working on it. Balsars working on shots. I know they've

[57:47] Sorry to interrupt I know Todd Tucky did point out he made a point that it will sell overseas very well in a few countries

[57:55] I can't remember which ones but

[57:58] But he's where he's all in on October

[58:02] I don't know. I mean, how many of they got to sell to make a profit though really? I don't know

[58:07] Like I

[58:08] More than the orders of you have all these you have all these like Halloween themed games like monsters

[58:15] You know monster bash and you can look at that like in October only kind of game too really

[58:22] Yeah, I do think that like Elvira monster bash

[58:26] um

[58:27] Alice Cooper's nightmare castle the monsters

[58:31] Yes, and no though like the monsters was a TV show. It's like saying Batman is

[58:35] spooky

[58:36] You know it's like some of these things are like just evergreen kind of fun

[58:42] Properly. Yeah, maybe they should have done October first. I don't know

[58:46] You know look

[58:48] Yeah, I I think there are much better themes out there that would have made more people jump in and it

[58:54] But I think the problem of that game is more than just one thing

[58:59] It's a culmination of like everything just feels like

[59:02] Half

[59:04] Way there compared to where we are that's the thing. It's like you can't launch a game in

[59:09] 2018 with certain elements of that game being really inferior

[59:15] To what your competition is doing

[59:17] So you got to have stellar art you've got to have stellar animation you've got to have a stellar theme

[59:22] You've got to have stellar gameplay

[59:24] Now you if you were to say which one of those things can fall by the wayside

[59:28] I would argue that the easiest thing to get wrong is the gameplay

[59:33] If you actually have like all the rest in place because I think

[59:37] Stern has built an empire

[59:40] on theme art and

[59:43] You know display now where like the actual

[59:47] Design of the games is very very like

[59:50] More pedestrian than

[59:53] You know even old stern games used to be

[59:56] Yeah, I know they've really got it very simplified. It's all about the art and presentation now

[01:00:01] Can you blame them like I don't even blame no, I can't it sells

[01:00:07] No, and it does and people buy it so they know what they're doing

[01:00:10] How you know I literally

[01:00:13] I literally could not walk in the George Gomez's office and say you're fucking this whole thing up

[01:00:19] George like no when he's like Chris people are buying this shit without even saying it

[01:00:26] Yeah, I mean they got something going

[01:00:28] I do feel like I know I'm not the only operator that feels this way that they feels like they've kind of left us behind

[01:00:33] And that's the way it's gone. That's fine

[01:00:35] But we we feel a little bit like we like they don't give a crap about us anymore

[01:00:39] You know and yes, Stern and all the other people because like again like what are you what's your criteria for

[01:00:48] A pimp on manufacturer that could show an operator they care

[01:00:52] Well

[01:00:53] I just it's just

[01:00:54] The way they they target the themes the way

[01:00:58] Um well, it was worth removing the service rails they did put those back after we did bitch a lot

[01:01:04] But it's just they definitely we we can tell the focus is shifted. I don't know how we it

[01:01:08] It just it just feels like it they don't I mean it mirrors and it has the home collector

[01:01:13] Right and that's right. I

[01:01:15] For $5,000 you can go put a ghost busters

[01:01:21] It's Star Wars a deadpool a Batman

[01:01:24] You know and Iron Maid you can put all these amazing themes

[01:01:28] Or you could put

[01:01:31] You know October fest

[01:01:34] Or yeah, no, I'm not saying October Fest is great. I'm just saying that the it could have been better

[01:01:39] I did didn't I'd like a further record. I didn't like who didn't I didn't like it

[01:01:43] I didn't like the art. I didn't like the layout and like in it at all and like the animation nothing about it

[01:01:48] So Sean does anyone do you think anyone is catering to the operator at this stage or is it like I think I think Jack was really trying to in the beginning

[01:01:56] And I think he still sort of is he he has the pin-demption thing which was a good attempt

[01:02:00] He's trying to solve that to David Buster's I'm pretty sure

[01:02:03] And if they would have bought it to have it in grade

[01:02:05] But the problem is and it's always been with pinball manufacturers and trying to make redemption games. They don't understand

[01:02:11] How there's that there's a certain

[01:02:14] amount of skill and knowledge that goes into making redemption games what makes them fun versus a pinball machine

[01:02:20] And that they really don't match you can't just instantly turn a pinball game into a redemption game

[01:02:26] It's because people are driven by different things. They don't want to stand there and play that long as well

[01:02:30] All kinds of different variables that go into it

[01:02:32] But long story short is that they've all these companies have tried to make redemption games in the past Williams has stern has

[01:02:40] And Jersey checked it a little bit

[01:02:43] And they they've all failed and it's just because they they really

[01:02:48] The pinball guys and the rest of the everyone lives in their little bubbles, right?

[01:02:52] So if you don't really get out and look at the rest of the the industry enough you don't

[01:02:58] You know you don't see things clearly

[01:03:01] I mean to me a pinball machine as a redemption machine sounds so idiotic

[01:03:05] I'll explain why like when you go to like David Buster's or carnivals or boardwalks with your friends

[01:03:10] You love doing stuff like the ski ball or the poppish hot basketball where like you're actually playing something social with your friends

[01:03:17] And you're seeing who can get the most tickets to come out who the fuck was it sit there and watch someone try to get the wizard mode to get a lot of tickets and wizard

[01:03:24] Of us it just it takes too long yeah the games just takes too long and have to be like the watch someone play pinball

[01:03:30] No, it's not it's not a game that really belongs to the environment

[01:03:33] That's why they're not there and that's why David Buster is a smart enough to put them there

[01:03:37] They used to have like I said David Buster's used to have more of the traditional bar stuff

[01:03:42] At the locations like billiards tables and darts and stuff and they really kind of got rid of most of that

[01:03:47] And most locations and just focused on the core gambling stuff, you know

[01:03:52] and

[01:03:53] It's what works and it's a sense unfortunate and

[01:03:58] That they just and they really should in my opinion as just my opinion they should have at least some of the traditional machines

[01:04:04] You know like a like a billiards table and at least one dart board dart area for you know at a pinball machine

[01:04:10] What you just want you mean you don't have to have a whole row, but you can have one for the guy who's like

[01:04:14] I don't want to play his crap at least I'll play this, you know

[01:04:16] I don't I don't see the just narrowing the field so much

[01:04:19] So if I'm if I'm the president of David Buster's and I say Sean

[01:04:24] You picked me the one game I should put into all my locations what pinball machine out of any pinball machine of all time would you put in my establishments?

[01:04:33] Hmm, that's a tough question

[01:04:35] Um, well, we want something that wouldn't break right we want something that's instantly recognizable and not too difficult so

[01:04:44] I would actually go with sense pinball's kind of retro anyway. I would go with

[01:04:49] some of the classic belly limb stuff for me they're

[01:04:53] Chicago gaming, you know, I probably like an attack from Mars or something and

[01:04:58] Something maybe possibly some of the stern stuff that's you know, I would just do it more as retro though

[01:05:02] I think we would just cater to those people who are looking for what they had, you know when they're younger so

[01:05:09] It's funny you say that because I think you go we can go in that direction

[01:05:12] We want to give like the pinhead the game that

[01:05:15] They you know put in their top five

[01:05:19] Or you could go like iron man, which is like a scene that all the young you know younger people know

[01:05:25] It's easy pin to understand. It's like not a lot of stuff to break

[01:05:31] Be curious you play your mind. This might blow your mind. I think um I think that

[01:05:37] The best company has a shot of getting something into Damon busters is probably gerry at p3

[01:05:44] Because it's so weird and so new

[01:05:47] That it looks so different that they might have a shot of getting it in there, you know that

[01:05:52] But it's a little too complicated. I think I think they need to make a simple they have a few simple games within their not very good

[01:05:58] nobody but like

[01:06:00] But see the one system where I think redemption would work is gerry's like game where you add each other like head to head

[01:06:10] Yeah, he has the best shot because that works. I mean it's actually a game's not a fun the only thing is you need two of them to connect

[01:06:17] And that's $20,000

[01:06:19] Yeah, but for like, like nothing though. I'm just telling you

[01:06:23] You know they spent 30 what 25,000 of those uh those double halo units, you know

[01:06:30] 150,000 on that Jurassic Park ride so

[01:06:33] 150 grand something like that was off between a hundred and 150 grand

[01:06:37] Oh, no fucking dinosaur for cheaper

[01:06:40] Unbelieve it. Well, it's it's an updateable system. So they're gonna build it. It's a fun ride

[01:06:44] I'm just telling you it's a VR, you know

[01:06:46] But they they can update the software to different things so right and how much is it to ride that that damn thing like 10 bucks 15 bucks

[01:06:54] Five bucks. Okay, per person. I think it's it's eight of a time. Oh, there was when I was there. There was a line

[01:06:59] so right

[01:07:00] It was good. It wasn't half bad. It's not

[01:07:03] It's it's a it wasn't

[01:07:05] It wasn't that wasn't half bad. It was 40 experience. I think it win did everything

[01:07:10] Well, Sean, I want to thank you for coming on um, I do really yeah go on

[01:07:15] There was one more thing I think pinball could do that would probably help if they want to get an operating realm and that would be

[01:07:21] Do you remember the older games like NBA Jam and

[01:07:26] Yes, they had that system where you could log into it right do you know the big buck hunters? They have the car system

[01:07:33] And they keep they track all your stats and I really think that

[01:07:36] Pinball needs something like that. I think Stern can do something like that

[01:07:39] We either buy the car or the QR, you know, scan it with your phone

[01:07:44] And it will track all of your stats and you can earn achievements you ever play

[01:07:48] You do you follow the Japanese stuff a lot right obviously canada

[01:07:51] You know the Japanese arcades they have

[01:07:53] Initial DE and maximum tune and all that stuff and it tracks all your stats your battles and all that stuff

[01:07:59] And you get it ranks and achievements. I think they can introduce something like that

[01:08:03] And I think pinball people would love it. Honestly, it would track it would track all of your tilts all your first games

[01:08:09] What the challenge always becomes

[01:08:12] Is the consistency of the setup of the games you play because you're like everyone's

[01:08:18] Experience is different depending on how the game is set up where that doesn't affect neo geo or

[01:08:25] You know, you know all the arcade games because it's all the same game like there's no way to be like oh in my game

[01:08:32] You know you had the you had like the outposts all the way up and

[01:08:37] Someone else had them down and the angle on this game, you know, that's the only challenge with pinball

[01:08:43] Yeah, I suppose you're right. It's like every Donkey Kong machine plays the same all across the world

[01:08:48] Yeah, you get some jerk at which sheet right

[01:08:50] I mean, yeah, take the glass off of be people all night long

[01:08:52] I'll be like hey, what are you talking about guys? I'm an 18 wizard modes in one night. Just another night for playing pinball

[01:08:58] Yeah, it would be cool if you got something like that that would track your information and you could get achievements and medals and all that stuff

[01:09:04] And we'll keep your name and you would scan it in and put your name up and everything

[01:09:09] My whole thing. It's like pinball so far behind

[01:09:12] Well, that's you know, I was talking about this with someone tonight. It's like it's so far behind

[01:09:16] It's like we look at

[01:09:18] Animation on a screen now and pinball where like wow Beatles looks great and I'm like this is like shit from like the mid 90s

[01:09:25] This animation like nothing is like current

[01:09:30] But we're so impressed because we basically had what was ostensibly a t.i. 82 calculator graphics

[01:09:39] All throughout the 90s with DMDs like it's like it's it's amazing how low our expectations are and yet the price of them is so high

[01:09:50] There anything anything blows this way like oh my god. You got a decent artist. This is the greatest thing ever now take my money 10 grand

[01:09:57] Here you go like there's no good artist in the world

[01:10:00] The new halo game you can you can get a card and go to the arcade and play it and get achievements there and then it reflects on your Xbox live account

[01:10:08] You know big big but halo is a billion dollar franchise and all but it's still this pinball is so far behind in like the arcade world

[01:10:16] You know all this stuff I was talking about trek and stances like from the 90s, you know, I mean

[01:10:20] Because it's but you're right. It's still an old thing pinball and as long as stern pinball

[01:10:26] What can sell games out without people even seeing it there is no need for them to do any of this innovation

[01:10:34] And you know what I don't think they're wrong. I don't think you even need to do this innovation

[01:10:38] I think they're just gonna keep doing what they're doing and you know the only thing that will take stern down is a better

[01:10:44] Better pinball experience

[01:10:46] Not like more whiz-bang gadgetry around pinball

[01:10:51] So we'll see

[01:10:52] Well at the very least we could have you know internet-connected machines and what a no-one organized tournaments

[01:10:58] I mean dark machines have had this for a lot of novel content right in electronic device connected to something called the internet

[01:11:06] Yeah, no, it's just I mean I love stern and this it's all good

[01:11:09] But I have dark machines from 10 years ago that even 20 years ago now they connect to the internet to take league scores and stuff like that

[01:11:17] Right to the start, you know, I mean but again without any of that in there right Sean?

[01:11:22] Yeah, my money now take my money now

[01:11:24] Well, that's I mean, that's what it is and it's you know, it's the way it is

[01:11:28] You think sure once I have to deal with like creating servers and then creating like a whole online infrastructure

[01:11:33] I heard they were gonna do all they were gonna do some internet stuff, you know

[01:11:36] But I guess there's no motivation to do it. So I don't blame them, you know, I mean they'll get to it

[01:11:42] But again, I mean it's 2018 and we're talking about like connecting to the internet for pinball

[01:11:48] Yeah, I know hey, we're up to usb drives. Yeah, no, I know amazing which you still though. I love it usb drives

[01:11:54] I still have to like take I have to take the

[01:11:57] The key out of the lock box. I have to get into the

[01:12:02] You flip down the speaker grill. I have to take out the translate. I have to like

[01:12:06] Like literally they couldn't just put the usb plug somewhere easier

[01:12:11] In fairness just for fairness

[01:12:14] A lot of the arcades software from raw thrills and stuff is even worse

[01:12:18] Top grade right

[01:12:20] Like Sega gave away the whole day tommy game on accident without the same thing

[01:12:26] So you have to get a whole new key and stuff from them. It's even more painted

[01:12:31] But so I don't just I just don't upgrade them this easier

[01:12:34] Right, but they're game grade away though. Here's here's a thing. I'm glad you're down there

[01:12:39] I love the report you gave us from ioppa enjoy the warm weather. It's cold and dark here in New York

[01:12:46] Let's get you back on the show soon, but I think everyone appreciates

[01:12:50] One of the first hand accounts of beetles pinball and I also think you know coming from an operator's point of view

[01:12:56] I always think that

[01:12:59] You know you guys have a different take on what appeals to you in pinball, but I also think

[01:13:04] You also are the people that expand pinball to the masses because let's be honest

[01:13:09] pinball is not expanding because

[01:13:11] You know a bunch of rich dudes throw them in their basement

[01:13:14] No, yeah, and it's I want to we try to have it around at least so kids can experience it

[01:13:19] That never seen it before there maybe it is they don't have a rich uncle

[01:13:23] Right me actually more that but maybe it is maybe a bunch of other rich guy friends come over and say hey

[01:13:27] I want what this guy has and who knows who knows I think it's all a guessing game all I know is

[01:13:34] I think stern is doing

[01:13:35] Just enough to sell tons of pinball and they know that and I don't think there's a lot of innovation that they need to do to get more sales

[01:13:44] They have some really good themes though. I mean we can't we cannot come they good presentation good art absolutely

[01:13:49] Absolutely well Sean thank you. I appreciate your time and we'll talk real soon. Thanks. Gonna see you later. All right

[01:14:05] Oh
