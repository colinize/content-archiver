[00:00] Look, I'm not gonna say I told you so, but I told you so that Steve Richie was gonna

[00:22] go over to Jersey Jack Pimble.

[00:24] I'm not gonna say I told you so, but I told you that Lyman Sheets is no longer at Stern,

[00:29] and he is most likely gonna be working on some new games probably with CGC.

[00:33] We're gonna talk about that.

[00:35] So on episode 604, let's talk about this news today that should be like ground breaking,

[00:42] cosmic shifting, seismic shifting.

[00:45] The Pimball universe is turned upside down the king.

[00:49] Mr. Steve Richie walks into Jersey Jack Pimble in what is arguably the most awkward video

[00:57] I might have seen on the entire internet in the history of the internet, and he met Pat

[01:02] Lawler and the team over at Jersey Jack Pimble, and this is how the world got confirmation

[01:08] that Steve Richie has left Stern Pimble.

[01:11] He walked into Jersey Jack Pimble with Jack Winari wearing sunglasses, and now the entire

[01:17] Pimball world knows that Jersey Jack Pimble has another designer.

[01:22] The one thing Jersey Jack Pimble doesn't need is another designer, so how are we supposed

[01:28] to process this news?

[01:30] What is this gonna mean for the Pimball world?

[01:32] When are we gonna see Steve Richie's efforts in a Jersey Jack machine?

[01:36] We know this company can't make two games in a year.

[01:39] This is not the problem they need it to solve, and probably the most hilarious item of the

[01:45] day.

[01:46] Inside the press release, in which they announce iconic designer Steve Richie is joining

[01:51] Jersey Jack Pimble.

[01:53] There is a line in which Jersey Jack says that they are the industry leaders in Pimball

[01:59] quality.

[02:00] Let me repeat that.

[02:01] They're the industry leaders in Pimball quality.

[02:04] Look I know it's just a boilerplate, hype yourself company kind of line, but man how

[02:09] can they even?

[02:10] Who read over that press release and was like well maybe we should take this part out.

[02:16] The rest of this is true, Guns and Roses has sold well, Steve Richie is an iconic designer,

[02:21] we do put more innovation into our games, but I don't think in good faith we can tell

[02:26] people that we are the industry leaders in quality.

[02:31] How did that get out the door?

[02:32] But anyway, let's talk about this move.

[02:33] So what do I think about Steve Richie making his sort of like NWO like WCW entrance into

[02:41] Jersey Jack Pimball?

[02:42] Didn't it feel like that?

[02:43] Remember when you were a kid and you watched wrestling and someone defected over to the

[02:47] other side?

[02:49] And it just felt like that.

[02:50] It just felt like that, right?

[02:51] The moment that Hulk Hogan turned into Hollywood Hogan and became a bad guy.

[02:56] Now I'm not sure like this is like the bad guy move, but this is definitely a switching

[03:00] sides, right?

[03:01] This is definitely changing teams.

[03:04] This is Jack Guinari getting the guy who was at the top of the pyramid over in the Stern

[03:09] world, but here's the thing.

[03:11] Everybody knows that Steve Richie was not pumping out the best games over at Stern Pimball.

[03:17] So it's a little bit of a weird acquisition on that front as well.

[03:20] This isn't the designer that's going to make people do back flips because Steve is a

[03:25] designer that's all about speed and flow.

[03:29] And Jersey Jack Pimball is a company that doesn't make games that are fast or games that

[03:33] have great flow.

[03:35] So if you add those two things up, they don't add up.

[03:38] Now you could make the argument that that's why they're bringing Steve Richie on board

[03:42] to make Jersey Jack games play better, to make them feel better.

[03:46] And we'll see if he can do that with the hardware he has at his disposal.

[03:51] I still think there's something wrong with Jersey Jack Pimball flippers and the way they

[03:55] feel.

[03:56] Are they going to change that?

[03:57] Will that be one of the things that Steve Richie brings to the table?

[04:01] So it's a little bit of a weird move on that front, right?

[04:03] It's like the styles, like their styles are so different.

[04:06] Steve Richie's style of Pimball and Jersey Jack's style of Pimball, they just don't add

[04:12] up.

[04:13] Okay.

[04:14] It's also been a really, really, really, really long time.

[04:16] And Steve Richie has done anything memorable or wowed people by putting a ton into his

[04:22] games.

[04:23] And that's exactly what Jersey Jack Pimball tries to do with each game, right?

[04:27] Is put as much as they can under that glass.

[04:30] Now here is the part, when would we see a Steve Richie game?

[04:33] I mean, it is 2021 and they are going to be making guns and roses for the next year.

[04:38] And then 2022 will most likely be Toy Story.

[04:41] And then you get to 2023, 2024, right?

[04:44] Isn't Eric Minier's game up after Toy Story?

[04:48] So is Steve Richie going to slot in front of Eric's next game?

[04:52] And I bet if you did a show of hands, how many of you want to see Steve Richie's next

[04:57] game in front of Eric Minier's next game?

[05:01] Nobody would raise their hands.

[05:03] So it becomes a very questionable move of how is this adding value to the organization

[05:11] over at Jersey Jack Pimball?

[05:13] Whenever you make an acquisition like this, the whole point of an acquisition like this

[05:18] is that you are solving a problem your company has.

[05:21] But they don't have a design problem.

[05:24] That's why it's so hard to get excited about this because it's not doing anything for

[05:29] them.

[05:30] There is nothing that Jersey Jack Pimball lacks in the design department.

[05:34] They have two incredible designers in Pat Lawler and Eric Minier.

[05:38] The department that Jersey Jack Pimball needs help with is the manufacturing department

[05:43] and the quality department.

[05:46] So none of this will help impact that.

[05:49] So knowing that and knowing that Steve Richie's game won't be on the line until sometime in

[05:54] 2024, maybe 2025, how is it in 2021?

[06:00] We're supposed to get excited about this news.

[06:03] It's definitely a big move, but I think for so many people out there, you kind of

[06:08] look at Steve Richie even Pat Lawler and you look at the video, right?

[06:12] You look at this video and it looked like and I don't mean to be mean, but man, it looked

[06:16] really awkward.

[06:18] It looked like two guys, two old cramudgins sitting there talking about how Pimball is the

[06:26] center of the universe.

[06:27] When you look at the video, it just doesn't exude this vibrant energy and the future of

[06:33] Pimball is here, right?

[06:35] That vibrant energy of Eric Minier hanging with Ken Cromwell and slash this sort of like

[06:41] contemporary Pimball company that's going to rock and roll into the future.

[06:45] Now we get this like three older guys and there's something wrong with being older, but

[06:50] this didn't seem like the right way to do it.

[06:52] Like Marching there, Pats over to the left, kind of awkwardly then he moves and stands

[06:57] behind Steve and they didn't really sort of embrace it.

[07:01] You know, you kind of want it, Jack Winari, Steve Richie and Pat Lawler.

[07:05] Like if they all got like in a huddle and locked arms and we're jumping up and down

[07:09] and be like, we're going to change Pimball, get ready everybody and then just cut to a

[07:12] black screen and be like coming soon like the all new Jersey Jack Pimball.

[07:17] Like something like that, like I just thought that doing it on Facebook live, which makes

[07:22] it even more awkward, wasn't the right way to do it.

[07:26] People are going to deconstruct this video.

[07:28] People know, Canadian is going to make fun of a video like this and Canada is making fun

[07:31] of a video like this.

[07:33] Because as you know, marketing is something that does matter and every time you put your

[07:37] company out there, you got to do something that connects and you got to do something that

[07:42] translates the vibe of your company.

[07:45] Like you're building a brand every time you do something official like this and I just

[07:49] felt like it was really awkward.

[07:51] I felt really awkward watching it and I don't know.

[07:54] I don't think a lot of people will say that.

[07:56] I always got to be the bad guy, but it was really awkward.

[07:58] So look, this move we knew it was coming and I want to give a shout out to the two people

[08:03] that broke this news.

[08:05] I want to give a shout out to Rob T on Pinside.

[08:08] He put up the thread a week ago that said this was happening.

[08:12] So Rob T gets the credit for breaking this news.

[08:15] I want to give a shout out to Kerry Hardy because it was his video that went up.

[08:20] I think a day before I did my podcast in which he said that Steve Richie was most likely

[08:25] going to J.J.P.

[08:26] He also talked about Lyman Sheets.

[08:29] So those two guys get credit for putting this information into the world.

[08:33] For those of you out there who think what we do in terms of sharing this information before

[08:38] the press release goes live, I don't know what to tell you.

[08:41] I will always be the pinball podcast or that we'll talk about stuff, news, rumors, and

[08:47] speculation when I hear it.

[08:48] I get that there's a good old boy club that knows all this information.

[08:52] I get that there are circle of people that are all friends with each other.

[08:57] That's sign NDAs and know all of this stuff days and weeks before anybody else.

[09:02] And that's great.

[09:03] That's not me.

[09:04] I'm on the outside looking in.

[09:05] The reason why this show is number one is because we're on the outside looking in.

[09:09] Because when this news breaks, I don't have to be nice to my friends who put out the press

[09:13] release.

[09:14] I can tell you how I really feel.

[09:16] And this move really isn't as big as it looks.

[09:18] It's not.

[09:19] And I'll tell you this.

[09:20] The equation is, is Stern pinball going to be impacted by Steve Richie leaving?

[09:25] And the answer is 100,000% they're not.

[09:29] This is not going to hurt Stern pinball at all.

[09:31] If anything, this is going to give new designers over at Stern pinball a chance to show us

[09:36] what they can do.

[09:37] It's going to give Keith L. Win more slots on the roster.

[09:40] John Borg, more slots on the roster.

[09:42] If George Gomez wants to go back in, he can go back in.

[09:45] Steve Richie games would come out and they would underwhelm.

[09:48] And they have underwhelmed for many, many years.

[09:51] Now I will say this, the pressure is now going to be on Steve Richie to deliver.

[09:55] Because he's going over to a place that doesn't have a low bomb.

[09:59] So we're going to see what he can do.

[10:01] If his game comes out and it is like, oh my god, incredible.

[10:06] Load it with toys and got great flow.

[10:08] And he shows us what he can do.

[10:09] This will be either Steve Richie's redemption moment or it will be his retirement.

[10:15] I mean that.

[10:16] There's no other way he's going to go with this.

[10:19] This game is either going to redeem him or it will send him into retirement.

[10:24] And it is that kind of move.

[10:26] This isn't like let's get Steve Richie and give him a few chances at the plate.

[10:29] No, Steve's been in this long enough.

[10:32] He's had the excuse of the low Stern bomb over and over again.

[10:36] Now it's not going to be an excuse.

[10:37] He's either going to hit it out of the park or he's going to strike out.

[10:41] There's no middle ground here.

[10:42] There's no middle ground here.

[10:43] And I'm excited because he's got to feel that pressure.

[10:47] And that pressure is good because I mean it.

[10:50] Pressure is something that drives people to do something incredible and make their mark

[10:55] without pressure, without feeling that anxiety that I have to do something now to stand

[11:00] up to this moment.

[11:01] Right.

[11:02] If I'm going to strut through that door like Conor McGregor and all black and put my

[11:05] sunglasses on, now he has to deliver.

[11:08] Right.

[11:09] Now he has to deliver.

[11:10] And Jack's move.

[11:11] Will it pay off?

[11:12] Jack Winari's dream of having Steve Richie pay off.

[11:15] And I can't wait to see it.

[11:16] The only problem is this.

[11:18] We're all going to be two to three years older when we finally see it.

[11:22] Will we care when we finally see it?

[11:24] And here's the scary part.

[11:25] Will the world go into a recession before we see it?

[11:29] That is the dark cloud that is going to come towards this industry.

[11:33] All these expensive games.

[11:35] We're going to be oversaturated with titles and inflation is real.

[11:39] The economy has been way too good.

[11:41] But everyone made money during COVID, unless you were in the service industry, all the

[11:45] rich got richer.

[11:46] But there will come a time.

[11:48] The recession is going to hit.

[11:50] It's just a matter of when, right?

[11:52] Will the pinball industry be able to keep going for two, three, four, five more years?

[11:56] They sure as hell are staffing up like it will.

[11:58] So we'll see.

[11:59] We'll see.

[12:00] Nobody knows.

[12:01] Nobody knows what the future holds.

[12:03] But over at Stern Pinball, I bet they don't care at all.

[12:06] Stern Pinball clobbers everybody with manufacturing.

[12:09] Now here's an interesting rumor I heard.

[12:11] And I got an email in my inbox and it said, Stern's next game is going to be from a brand

[12:17] new designer.

[12:18] Nobody knows.

[12:19] Okay.

[12:20] Now take that for what it's worth.

[12:22] Do you think Stern Pinball has a brand new designer that hasn't designed a game before?

[12:26] Here's my guess.

[12:27] Here's my guess.

[12:28] And I don't know if this is true or not.

[12:30] I would guess that Steve Richie's protégé, Tim Sexton, who's been following Steve

[12:35] on a few titles.

[12:36] Do you think Tim Sexton will jump into the design ring and design a pinball machine?

[12:42] That is my guess.

[12:43] I think if anyone knew over at Stern is going to design a machine, I think it might be Tim.

[12:47] But I could be completely wrong.

[12:48] I am just making this up on the spot.

[12:50] But I am hearing that there will be a new designer that throws his hat into the ring over

[12:55] at Stern Pinball.

[12:56] The interesting part I heard was it's going to be the next game.

[13:00] But what happened to Keith L. Wins Godzilla being next and is Stern going to hold that?

[13:04] I don't know.

[13:05] I really don't know.

[13:06] I don't know their schedule.

[13:08] I know L. Wins game has to be coming up very, very shortly.

[13:13] But you heard it here first.

[13:14] There might be a game in front of Keith L. Wins game.

[13:17] So take that for what it's worth.

[13:19] So Steve Richie, over at Jersey Jack Pinball, I think it's more of a head scratcher than

[13:23] it is like, oh my god, they went and got him.

[13:26] Like if Eric Manier went over to Stern, that would be incredible.

[13:30] If Keith L. Wins went over to Jersey Jack Pinball, that would be incredible.

[13:34] Here's what I think is going to happen.

[13:36] Pinball poaching season is upon us.

[13:39] In any industry, when you want to gain a competitive advantage, you go out and you get talent.

[13:45] The best way to get ahead is to go get people who know how to do it and do it better than

[13:50] you currently do it.

[13:51] That is why David Fix went out and got Dennis Norton in over Joe Ballsor.

[13:56] Dennis Norton, I think, makes better games than Joe Ballsor right now.

[14:00] And so I think Pinball poaching season is just starting.

[14:05] I think it is going to sweep through this industry like we've never seen before over the next

[14:09] 12 months.

[14:10] I think you're going to see more people trading places in Pinball.

[14:14] I think more and more Pinball people, especially coders and designers, are going to wake up and

[14:20] they're going to realize their market value.

[14:23] As we see these games making millions of dollars for these companies and millions of dollars

[14:27] is on the table if you can make a good Pinball machine and it's not just stern Pinball, right?

[14:32] Look at spooky Pinball.

[14:33] Look at all the money they're making right now.

[14:35] If you are a good Pinball designer, there is no reason why you should not retire somewhat

[14:41] wealthy in the world.

[14:43] It's a very, very niche skill set, but it is a niche skill set that is making millions

[14:49] of dollars and millions of dollars are on the table.

[14:52] And I think you're going to see people like Eric Minier wake up and say, am I making

[14:56] enough for my game that just made this much money for Jersey Jack Pinball?

[15:01] Is he happy enough with what he makes?

[15:04] Now if you want to go get Eric Minier, I bet you can if you double his salary and I bet

[15:09] his salary is not incredibly high.

[15:12] Same thing with Keith L. when same thing with Zombie, as much as there's loyalty, there

[15:17] is also something called people will take care of themselves.

[15:21] And it's not about being disloyal.

[15:23] It's not.

[15:24] Everyone who's worked in corporate America or anywhere knows that every once in a while,

[15:29] you need to go for a big land grab.

[15:32] You need to and you need to strike when the iron is hot.

[15:35] You need to make sure you capitalize your career when you're on top of your game.

[15:40] When you come out with a game like Guns and Roses, that's a good moment to march in there

[15:45] and either get a big raise or see what someone else in the industry will pay you.

[15:50] There's a lot of very, very wealthy men who have pinball dreams and aspirations and some

[15:54] of those men actually have pinball companies.

[15:57] So I think David Fix is going to poach more and more and more.

[16:02] And I think once American pinball gets their manufacturing lines started, I think he's

[16:07] going to have a good selling point to other designers to come over and join the AP party

[16:12] and they're going to need it.

[16:13] I know they're working with junior designers and I know they're working with Dennis Normand

[16:18] and here's what I hope happens over at AP.

[16:20] I hope one of those junior designers, I hope one of those junior designers designs the

[16:26] next blockbuster game.

[16:28] I hope it comes from someone we've never heard.

[16:30] I'm so tired of the same names over and over and over again.

[16:34] I will admit it when I see Pat Lawler and Steve Richie, I'm like, come on.

[16:38] There's got to be somebody who's young and hungry that can out design these two guys,

[16:43] that can out think pinball in modern times, that can make a contemporary world under glass

[16:48] that blows away what these guys did.

[16:51] These guys are not even doing what they did back in the Valley Williams days.

[16:54] So where is the young energy?

[16:56] Where is the enthusiasm?

[16:58] Where is the desire to make a name for yourself?

[17:01] These guys don't need to make a name for themselves.

[17:03] They've already made a name for themselves.

[17:06] It's like when I watched Guns and Roses take the stage in Hershey, Pennsylvania this past

[17:09] weekend, I was so bored.

[17:11] I'm like, this is the worst iteration of GNR ever.

[17:14] Look at them.

[17:15] They're like these old guys just strutting around the stage.

[17:17] It's like a novelty act, but none of the energy, none of the drive, none of the hunger

[17:21] was there in any of the band members.

[17:24] It's like they're just going through the motions and guess what?

[17:26] They're making more money now than they ever made.

[17:30] It's sad to me because that's not why people loved Guns and Roses.

[17:34] I feel the same way about pinball.

[17:36] I think there are thousands of pinball fans out there that want to fall in love with

[17:40] new designers, with new coders, with a new approach to pinball.

[17:44] If you keep having the same people make the same games over and over and over again, how

[17:48] do you expect to get more creativity into pinball?

[17:52] How do you expect there to be more innovation in pinball?

[17:55] How do you expect there to be different kinds of games if we keep going back to the same

[17:59] creative well over and over and over again?

[18:02] Okay, so let's see what happens.

[18:04] Let's see what happens.

[18:05] The other news that I said is that Lyman Sheets was stepping down from Stern Pinball and

[18:09] that is now confirmed and people have confirmed this and I said this and people jumped down

[18:14] my back for saying this and it was accurate.

[18:17] The other thing I said is that I think Lyman Sheets is applying his efforts to cactus

[18:21] canyon remake and might be helping out CGC on some of their titles and then I was told

[18:26] by Ryan White that he is not an employee of CGC.

[18:31] I think Ryan's trying to do a little bit of a spin.

[18:33] I do.

[18:34] I think he's trying to get me to retract that news on a technicality because I think he

[18:38] wants to reveal to the world that Lyman Sheets, the greatest coder in the history of pinball,

[18:44] which he is, I think he wants to have that moment where he reveals to the world that Lyman

[18:50] Sheets is working on cactus canyon remake and I think he's trying to get me to retract

[18:54] it because by a technicality he's not an employee at CGC.

[18:59] So I'm going to go on the record and say that I firmly believe that Lyman Sheets's skill

[19:05] set will be on cactus canyon remake.

[19:08] I would be shocked if it is not and my sources who told me this are pretty damn accurate.

[19:14] Now he's not an employee at CGC.

[19:16] He's a contractor or freelancer but I think Ryan's trying to spin it on a technicality.

[19:22] The same way Michael Grant over at AP said to me, legends of Ahala is not the next game.

[19:27] So can you please take that down?

[19:29] So I did.

[19:30] But if it's rampage quest for Ahala and it's the same game, I think that's why AP Stalin

[19:35] is like, how do we name this thing something else?

[19:37] Because I told Canadian it wasn't legends of Ahala.

[19:40] So look Lyman Sheets leaving Stern pinball is arguably much bigger news than Steve

[19:45] Richie joining Jersey Jack pinball.

[19:47] It is.

[19:48] If Lyman Sheets joined Jersey Jack pinball to help Keith out, that would be much better

[19:53] news because then they'd have the two greatest coders in the history together again.

[19:57] So Lyman leaving is horrible.

[19:59] Lyman leaving sucks because Lyman's games are amazing.

[20:03] And I just hope he continues to make pinball machines and I could see Lyman Sheets going

[20:07] over and helping AP out, maybe helping his friend Dennis Nordman out.

[20:12] I could see Lyman Sheets being this sort of floating creative mind in the world of pinball

[20:17] coding.

[20:18] And whenever a project is out there that interests him, I really hope Lyman Sheets sits down

[20:23] with them and says, look, here's the deal.

[20:26] If I were Lyman, you can't do it hourly.

[20:28] You can't pay that man hourly because he takes years.

[20:31] If I were him, I would have a flat fee of what it's worth for me to code a game.

[20:39] Look I would have a base level.

[20:40] For me to code your game, I'm telling you right now I'm looking at a quarter million dollars

[20:45] or more.

[20:46] For me to code your pinball machine and if I'm Lyman Sheets with my pet agree, I would

[20:51] say to them probably more because think about it.

[20:53] If it takes him two years to fully code a game, which I don't think it takes him that long.

[20:57] And if it did and he charged $250,000, that's only $125,000 a year.

[21:05] That's not enough for a guy like Lyman Sheets.

[21:07] So I would look at it more like on an annual basis.

[21:10] I think this guy needs to make at least a quarter million dollars a year coding games.

[21:14] And if I were him, my sales pitch would be quite simply this.

[21:18] If you make a Lyman Sheets game, no matter what the theme is, you're going to sell a lot

[21:22] of machines.

[21:23] And I'm guarantee you that anything Lyman Sheets touches in the pinball world will sell

[21:28] at least at least 2000 units.

[21:32] I mean that unless it's like October fest, but even he could probably salvage October

[21:37] fest, right?

[21:38] But that's the thing is I think it makes sense for him to go this way.

[21:40] I think it makes sense for him to sell his skill set and work on projects that he's

[21:45] passionate about.

[21:46] Now my fear is this.

[21:47] Here's my biggest fear.

[21:49] Stern pinball will still put the best themes in front of everybody.

[21:53] They gave Steve Richie the best themes.

[21:55] They gave Lyman Sheets great themes.

[21:57] I'm a little bit worried when you leave Stern pinball.

[22:00] What a lot of people are going to realize when they leave Stern pinball is there's something

[22:04] that's actually more impressive than them.

[22:06] There's something much more popular than them.

[22:09] There's something much greater than them at play.

[22:12] And that is the IP.

[22:15] Stern has the greatest IP in the history of pinball.

[22:18] Stern gives each of its designers and coders such a leg up by giving them the best themes

[22:24] to work on.

[22:26] And it's a privilege to work on such exciting themes.

[22:29] And I think that's going to be the big issue.

[22:31] When you leave Stern pinball, you leave that marketing muscle behind.

[22:36] And that marketing muscle I hate to say it is actually more important than any designer,

[22:42] than any coder, than anything else out there.

[22:45] Stern pinball could announce tomorrow that they have back to the future.

[22:48] And it could be a total design dog with horrible monsters like shallow code.

[22:53] And it wouldn't matter.

[22:55] They would sell a few thousand units and be able to make those few thousand units in

[22:59] just a few weeks.

[23:00] That's the power of Stern pinball.

[23:02] And here's the other crazy part.

[23:04] Because Stern pinball has that power, they probably don't pay people incredibly well.

[23:10] And I don't know this for a fact.

[23:12] But because they know they are the only real shop in town, they can get away with that

[23:17] because that's where their value lies.

[23:20] It's like when I remember going to work, when I was a brand new employee in the world,

[23:24] everybody wanted to work at MTV.

[23:26] And I just saw they had their 40 year anniversary.

[23:29] But it was the most exciting place to work.

[23:31] You were in Times Square.

[23:33] You had TRL, Total Request live going on.

[23:36] You had Downtown Julie Brown.

[23:37] You had all these hosts.

[23:39] Everyone wanted to work at MTV.

[23:41] And if you got a job at MTV, they paid you $15,000 a year because they knew they had

[23:47] what everybody wanted.

[23:48] They didn't have to pay you a lot.

[23:49] They had thousands of resumes coming through the door for these positions.

[23:53] And that's the thing.

[23:54] Stern pinball is the same way.

[23:55] It's like they're just such a big well oiled machine that nobody, not one person, not

[24:00] two people, nobody could really leave Stern pinball.

[24:04] Nobody could really leave Stern pinball and hurt their bottom line.

[24:07] I think there's only one person.

[24:09] If they departed Stern pinball, people would be like Stern isn't trouble.

[24:13] People would be like, I don't know what the future holds for Stern.

[24:16] And you know who it is.

[24:17] And it's George Gomez.

[24:18] As long as they have George Gomez at the helm of the ship, none of these designers,

[24:23] artists and coders are really make or break for Stern.

[24:26] They will find someone new to put in.

[24:28] And I mean, even if Keith L. Winliffe, they would be fine.

[24:32] Even if John Borgleff, they would be fine.

[24:34] And they know that because they have such a well oiled manufacturing machine.

[24:39] That's all about manufacturing.

[24:41] If you can make a pinball machine based on a hot theme, the game will sell.

[24:45] Give me an example.

[24:46] Email me at canadapinball.com and you tell me a hot theme that so many people loved and

[24:53] wanted in pinball that came out and had a sales flop.

[24:57] It hasn't happened.

[24:58] It hasn't happened.

[24:59] Don't say hobbit.

[25:00] I'm going to stop you before you say hobbit because the hobbit movies were atrocious

[25:04] and Lord of the Rings fans hated them.

[25:07] So please don't email me the hobbit.

[25:09] Alright, so look, I think pinball poaching season will begin.

[25:12] I think you're going to see more and more people shuffle up the decks.

[25:15] I think American pinball is probably going to be the next company that acquires more and

[25:19] more people.

[25:20] And I think it's exciting, but I will say this, the future of pinball is the youth.

[25:26] We need to get more young people designing games and bringing their ideas to pinball.

[25:31] I look at a guy like Ryan McQuade, a young guy who builds Sonic the Hedgehog pinball in

[25:37] his basement.

[25:39] And there are more creative ideas in that game than half of the new games that came out

[25:44] this year.

[25:45] And that is what we need more of.

[25:47] The people with the passion building these games in their basements are putting more into

[25:52] them than all of these older designers that already have their legacy.

[25:58] They're already getting the word iconic put next to their name and press releases.

[26:02] That's not what I want.

[26:04] We all want the young, hungry designers to make a name for themselves.

[26:08] We want the young, hungry coders to code pinball moments into these games that wow us.

[26:14] Wouldn't you like to see a new coder approach pinball a little bit differently to try to

[26:18] bring storytelling into a pinball machine a little bit differently?

[26:22] This has been episode 644 of Canada's pinball podcast.

[26:25] It's been a pleasure talking to you guys from Ireland doing Facebook lives.

[26:30] And I'm not here to hurt anyone's career in pinball.

[26:33] I'm not here to metal with these personnel announcements.

[26:36] But if I hear about these announcements, of course I'm going to cover it.

[26:40] This is what I do.

[26:41] There are other places that might respect this news and let them tell it themselves.

[26:46] I am not in the business of letting these companies tell you the news.

[26:50] If I hear stuff, I will tell it.

[26:53] If they want to try to work with me on stuff, they know how to get in touch with me.

[26:56] I'm Nate Pinball at gmail.com or 5th Twippy at gmail.com.

[27:00] I'll talk to you soon.
